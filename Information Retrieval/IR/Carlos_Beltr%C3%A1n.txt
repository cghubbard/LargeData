Carlos Iván Beltrán (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkarloz βelˈtɾan]; born April 
24, 1977) is a Puerto Rican professional baseball outfielder who is a free 
agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City 
Royals, Houston Astros, New York Mets, San Francisco Giants, St. Louis 
Cardinals, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers. Beltrán was the American 
League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 1999 while with the Royals. He has been 
named to nine MLB All-Star Games, and has won three Gold Glove Awards and 
two Silver Slugger Awards. Beltrán is the fifth player to reach both 400 
home runs and 300 stolen bases and just the fourth switch hitter with 400 
home runs. He is also a member of the 30–30 club, as he has hit 30 home 
runs and stolen 30 bases in the same season. Beltrán is among the best 
all-time statistical hitters in postseason games, which has earned him 
nicknames such as "the new Mr. October", "Mr. October, Jr.", "Señor Octubre", 
and "the real Mr. October" from the media.[1][1][2][3] He has broken the 
1.000 OPS mark in four different playoff series. Beltrán also has a 100% 
stolen base percentage (11/11) during the playoffs, which are the most 
stolen bases without being caught.[4] Despite his individual postseason 
success, he has never won a World Series, only having reached the 2013 
World Series with the Cardinals. In his youth, Beltrán excelled in many 
sports, with volleyball and baseball being his favorites. At his father's 
urging, he gave up volleyball to concentrate on baseball when he was seventeen. 
He graduated from Fernando Callejo High School in 1995.[citation needed] 
The Kansas City Royals selected Beltrán in the second round of the 1995 
Major League Baseball draft. After he signed, the Royals assigned him to 
the Gulf Coast Royals of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. In 1996, he 
played for the Spokane Indians of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, 
and the Lansing Lugnuts of the Class A Midwest League. In 1997 he spent 
the entire season playing for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class A-Advanced 
Carolina League. He began the 1998 season with Wilmington, and received 
a promotion to the Wichita Wranglers of the Class AA Texas League.[citation 
needed] Beltrán made his Major League debut on September 14, 1998, playing 
15 games. Unlike many players, he never played in Triple-A, the Omaha team. 
In 14 games of the 1998 baseball year, Beltran got 16 hits, 5 doubles, 
3 triples, and 7 RBI's with a .276 batting average during his time in the 
Majors. By 1999, he won the job as the Royals' starting center fielder 
and leadoff hitter. He displayed significant power by midsummer, and was 
moved to the #3 slot in the batting order. Beltrán won the American League 
Rookie of the Year award, batting .293 with 22 home runs, 108 runs batted 
in (RBIs) and 27 stolen bases in 156 games played. On September 27, 1999, 
Beltran made the final out at Tiger Stadium striking out against relief 
pitcher Todd Jones as the Detroit Tigers beat the Royals 8–2.[citation 
needed] Injuries restricted Beltrán to 98 games during the 2000 season 
and he slumped to .247, losing his center field position to the popular 
Johnny Damon. After Damon was traded to the Oakland Athletics following 
the season, Beltrán regained his job in 2001 and recaptured his rookie 
form. He batted .306 with 24 home runs and 101 RBIs in that season, followed 
by lines of .273-29-105 in 2002 and .307-26-100 in 2003.[citation needed] 
In 2003, Beltrán batted .194 in April. His luck changed in 2004, as Beltrán 
began the year with eight home runs and 19 RBIs and was selected as American 
League Player of the Month for April.[5][6] In the first 69 games of the 
2004 season, Beltrán batted .278 with 15 homers, 51 RBI, and 14 stolen 
bases. Playing for a small market club and represented by agent Scott Boras, 
Beltrán endured trade rumors through the 2003 and 2004 seasons. As the 
end of his contract neared, the two sides failed to negotiate a longterm 
deal. Following an interleague doubleheader loss to the last-place Montreal 
Expos, Royals' general manager Allard Baird informed reporters that he 
was preparing to dismantle the team and rebuild it for the 2005 season.[citation 
needed] On June 24, 2004, the Royals traded Beltrán to the Houston Astros 
in a three-team deal, which also sent relief pitcher Octavio Dotel from 
the Astros to the Oakland Athletics, while the Royals picked up Oakland 
minor leaguers (pitcher Mike Wood and third-baseman Mark Teahen) and Astros' 
catcher John Buck.[citation needed] While still a Royal, Beltrán had been 
selected as an AL starting outfielder for the 2004 All-Star Game. After 
NL starter Ken Griffey, Jr., went on the disabled list, Beltrán was named 
his substitute. Beltrán became the first player ever to be selected for 
one All-Star team but play for the other.[citation needed] For the rest 
of the 2004 season with the Astros, Beltrán played 90 games batting .258 
with 23 home runs, 53 RBI, and 28 stolen bases. Overall in 2004 combined 
with both teams he played for, Beltrán played 159 total games with a .267 
batting average, 38 home runs, 104 RBI, 42 stolen bases, and 121 runs scored. 
In the 2004 MLB playoffs, Beltrán tied Barry Bonds' single postseason-record 
with eight home runs. He hit one in each of the first four games of the 
National League Championship Series (NLCS) against the St. Louis Cardinals, 
including the game-winner in Game 4. Counting his two home-run performance 
in Game 5 of the previous playoff round in the National League Division 
Series (NLDS) against the Atlanta Braves, Beltrán clubbed at least one 
home run in a record-setting five consecutive postseason games,[7] eclipsed 
only by Daniel Murphy's home runs in six consecutive postseason games in 
2015.[8] In 12 games in the 2004 playoffs, Beltrán batted .435 with 14 
RBI and 21 runs scored.[9] Following the 2004 season, Beltrán became a 
free agent. The New York Yankees were tipped as favorites and Beltrán allegedly 
offered them a $19 million discount. The Yankees declined and the crosstown 
New York Mets signed him to a seven-year, $119-million contract, the biggest 
in franchise history at the time. It became the tenth contract in baseball 
history to surpass $100 million.[citation needed] On August 11, 2005, in 
a game against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park, Beltrán was seriously 
injured after colliding head-to-head with fellow Mets outfielder Mike Cameron 
when both were diving to catch a ball in shallow right center field. Cameron 
missed the rest of the season with a concussion, temporary loss of vision, 
and two broken cheekbones. Beltrán suffered vertigo for a while, although 
both players eventually recovered. A quadriceps injury bothered him most 
of the season and limited his speed. In 582 at bats, Beltrán's stats included 
career lows in batting average (.266), home runs (16), RBIs (78), runs 
scored (83), and stolen bases (17). Despite the limited participation, 
he was still voted to his second All-Star team. Beltrán played for Puerto 
Rico in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, joining Carlos Delgado, Bernie 
Williams, Javier Vázquez, Iván Rodríguez and others on the team managed 
by St. Louis Cardinals third base coach José Oquendo. His 2006 season was 
an upgrade on his first year in New York. Boosted by 10 home runs in May, 
he surpassed his home run total from the previous year before the season 
was half over. Beltrán's performance secured him a spot in the 2006 All-Star 
Game, his third. Five other Mets joined him, including three as starters. 
Beltrán was a standout for the NL as the only batter with multiple hits, 
along with two stolen bases. He scored the go-ahead run that gave the National 
League a 2–1 lead in the third inning, though the American League won the 
game.[10] He hit grand slams in consecutive games on July 16 and 18, becoming 
the 22nd player to do so. Another grand slam at the end of July made him 
only the third Met to hit three in one season. Beltrán continued to produce 
with a walk-off home run against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 22, 
off Cardinals closer Jason Isringhausen. It was Beltrán's second walk-off 
of the season, following a 16th-inning gamewinner against the Phillies. 
Beltrán's 41 home runs tied the Mets' single season record for homers, 
matching Todd Hundley's total in 1996. His 127 runs scored gave him sole 
possession of the Mets' single season franchise mark. He and teammate José 
Reyes won the Silver Slugger Award at their respective positions. He also 
tied for the major league lead in times reached base on an error (13).[11] 
Beltrán's defense was also recognized during the 2006 season, as he received 
his first Gold Glove award. He made only two errors in 372 chances to give 
him a .995 fielding percentage, and recorded 13 outfield assists and six 
double plays. He also won a Fielding Bible Award as the top fielding center 
fielder in MLB.[12] Beltrán came fourth in the National League MVP award 
voting, behind winner Ryan Howard, Albert Pujols, and Lance Berkman. Returning 
to the playoffs, Beltrán hit three home runs in the NLCS, bringing his 
career playoff total to 11 home runs in 22 games.[citation needed] However, 
with the bases loaded and two outs in the ninth inning Game 7 of the NLCS 
against the Cardinals, Beltrán struck out looking against Adam Wainwright, 
ending the New York Mets season. In 2007, Beltrán hit below .230 from May 
to July. However, he improved in August and September, finishing with a 
.276 batting average and 112 RBIs. Batting .282 in September with eight 
home runs, 27 RBIs and 22 runs scored, he was not one of the prime culprits 
in the Mets' painful collapse down the stretch. In July, he made his fourth 
All-Star Game appearance and upon the conclusion of the season, won his 
second straight Gold Glove award. In the final game before the All-Star 
game Beltrán connected his 15th home run of the season.[13] On August 29, 
Beltran collected all five RBIs for the Mets including a grand slam with 
two outs in the 9th to give the Mets a 5–2 lead.[14] The Mets would win 
this game 5–4. Beltran hit the last and only Mets home run in the final 
regular season game at Shea Stadium (the last home run would belong to 
Dan Uggla). The home run was a two run shot that tied the game 2–2 against 
the Florida Marlins. Beltrán won his third straight Gold Glove award in 
the outfield for the Mets. He also won his second Fielding Bible Award 
as the top MLB center fielder in 2008.[15] Beltrán recorded his 1,000th 
RBI against Scott Olsen (Washington Nationals) with a triple in the third 
inning on April 24, 2009.[16] In the voting for the 2009 All Star Game, 
Beltrán was third among NL outfielders (2,812,295 votes), trailing only 
Ryan Braun (4,138,559) and Raúl Ibáñez (4,053,355).[17] On January 13, 
2010, Beltrán had surgery on his knee and was originally expected to miss 
8–12 weeks. The procedure was performed by Beltrán's personal physician 
Dr. Richard Steadman.[18] The Mets stated that the surgery was done without 
their consent, and the team expressed their disappointment with Beltrán's 
decision.[19] However, Beltrán's agent, Scott Boras, claimed that the Mets 
consented to the procedure.[20] Beltrán played his first game of the 2010 
season on July 15.[21] On May 12, 2011, playing against the Colorado Rockies, 
Beltrán hit three two-run home runs in a 9–5 Mets' victory. It was the 
first three-home run game of his career, and he became only the eighth 
Mets hitter in history to hit three home runs in a single game. In the 
first 98 games of 2011, Beltrán batted .289 with 15 homers and 66 RBI. 
On July 28, 2011, the Mets traded Beltrán to the San Francisco Giants in 
exchange for pitching prospect Zack Wheeler. The Mets also sent $4 million 
cash to the Giants to cover Beltrán's remaining $6.5 million contract, 
which expired at the end of the 2011 season.[22][23] The day after the 
trade, Beltrán got his first hit with the Giants (an RBI single to left 
field in the first inning), going 1-for-5 while playing right field against 
the Cincinnati Reds. The Giants eventually lost to the Reds 4–3 in thirteen 
innings. On September 14, Beltrán hit two solo home runs against San Diego 
Padres' starting pitcher Mat Latos. The shot gave him 20 home runs for 
the season and 300 for his career. Prior to this game, Beltrán had never 
hit against Latos. Both home runs were hit to the right side of the field 
with Beltrán batting from the left side. The 299th hit the arcade, and 
the 300th landed in McCovey Cove which increased the "Splash Hit" count 
to 59. Both home runs proved to be crucial, as the Giants swept the Padres 
in a 3-game series, with a score of 3–1. His home runs in the series accounted 
for 4 out of the 14 runs. For the rest of the 2011 season with the Giants, 
Beltrán played 44 games batting .323 with 7 home runs and 18 RBI. Overall 
in 2011 combined with both teams he played for, Beltrán played 142 total 
games batting .300 with 22 home runs and 84 RBI. On December 22, 2011, 
Beltrán agreed to a two-year deal with the St. Louis Cardinals worth $26 
million which included a full no-trade clause.[24] After Beltrán signed 
with the Cardinals, he attained numerous milestones, personal as well other 
firsts. On Opening Day, April 4, Beltran recorded the first-ever hit in 
a regular season game at Marlins Park against Josh Johnson of the Miami 
Marlins. He was named NL Player of the Week on May 14 after he hit .360 
(9-for-25) with six home runs, 13 RBIs, eight runs, 30 total bases for 
a 1.200 slugging percentage and 1.648 OPS in the previous six games. He 
hit safely in five of the six games and homered in four of them. It was 
his ninth career weekly award, and sixth in the NL.[25] On June 1, in his 
first game in New York after leaving the Mets, the crowd gave him a standing 
ovation.[26] In one notable moment, a Beltrán batted ball touched the outside 
part of the foul line but was ruled a foul ball in a game in which former 
teammate, Johan Santana, was credited with throwing the first no-hitter 
in Mets' history.[27] Two weeks later (June 15), batting against his another 
former team in the Kansas City Royals, Beltrán stole second base in the 
second inning to become the first switch-hitter in MLB history to attain 
300 home runs and 300 stolen bases. He is the eighth player overall to 
reach the 300–300 club.[28] The Mets announced on June 18, 2012, that Beltrán 
was selected as the starting center fielder for 50th Anniversary Mets All-Time 
Team.[29] In a June 29 home game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates, Beltrán 
recorded a single in the third inning for his 2,000th hit, becoming the 
270th player in MLB history to do so. The day after he got his 2,000th 
hit, Beltrán collected his 400th double, becoming the 170th player to do 
so. Beltrán played in his 2,000th game on July 11, 2013.[30] In October, 
Beltrán was the recipient of the Roberto Clemente Award, becoming the fourth 
Cardinals player to win it, joining Albert Pujols, Ozzie Smith, and Lou 
Brock.[31] Beltrán filed for free agency after the World Series ended on 
October 30.[32][33] On November 9, Beltrán declined a one-year, $14.1 million 
qualifying offer from the Cardinals, making him a free agent.[34] On December 
6, 2013, Beltrán agreed to a three-year, $45 million deal to join the New 
York Yankees, despite receiving a $48 million offer from another team.[35] 
The deal became official on December 19, 2013.[36][37] On April 13, 2014, 
Beltrán played at first base for the first time in his professional career 
after Francisco Cervelli left the game due to a hamstring injury. On the 
night of May 12, 2014, Beltrán experienced soreness in his right elbow. 
It was revealed that the elbow had a bone spur and was immediately given 
a cortisone shot. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 15, 
2014. He was activated on June 5, 2014. To prevent any further damage to 
the elbow, he was used mostly as a designated hitter for the remainder 
of the season. On September 16, 2014, Beltrán left the team for an indefinite 
period of time due to his wife's miscarriage.[38] Limited to 109 games 
in 2014, Beltrán batted .233 with 15 home runs and 49 RBI. On October 1, 
2014, Beltrán officially underwent surgery to remove loose pieces and a 
bone spur in his right elbow, which required 12 weeks to recover. The procedure 
was performed by Yankees head team physician, Dr. Christopher Ahmad. Beltrán 
got off to a slow start in 2015, batting around .200 through April. He 
slowly improved throughout the season and in September had a batting average 
over .280. On August 14 against the Blue Jays, Beltrán hit a pinch hit 
go-ahead 3 run homerun in the 8th inning. It proved to be the game winner 
and temporarily put the Yankees back in 1st place. On August 17, he had 
a game tying home run in the 6th against the Twins. He reached 500 career 
doubles on August 31 against the Boston Red Sox.[39] On April 25, 2016, 
Beltrán became the 84th player to make 10,000 career plate appearances. 
He collected his 2,473rd career hit on April 27 against the Texas Rangers 
to pass Ted Simmons for tenth place on the all-time list for switch-hitters.[40] 
Beltrán hit his 400th career home run against the Chicago White Sox on 
May 15,[41] the 54th player in MLB history to do, fourth switch hitter, 
the third Puerto Rican-born player, and the fifth to do so with 300 stolen 
bases and 500 doubles.[42] On May 28, Beltrán homered for his 2,500th career 
hit off Matt Moore of the Tampa Bay Rays, joining Roberto Clemente, Ivan 
Rodriguez and Roberto Alomar as just the fourth Puerto Rican-born player 
to reach the milestone, and the 99th player overall to reach 2,500 hits. 
He became the fourth player, after Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds and Willie 
Mays, to reach 2,500 hits, 400 homers, 300 stolen bases and 1,000 walks.[43] 
On June 7, Beltrán became the 38th player all time to record 1,000 career 
extra base hits.[44] He was selected to his ninth All-Star Game at Petco 
Park in San Diego.[45] In a 5−3 loss to the Boston Red Sox on July 15, 
he became the 55th player, and fourth switch-hitter, to reach 1,500 RBI 
for his career.[46] On August 1, 2016, the Yankees traded Beltrán to the 
Texas Rangers for prospects Dillon Tate, Erik Swanson, and Nick Green.[47] 
Beltrán hit his first home run for Texas on August 3 against Baltimore, 
also scoring his 1,500th run on the play.[48] Beltrán is married to his 
wife Jessica, and has two daughters.[38]Beltrán is the cousin of outfielder 
Reymond Fuentes.[49] Beltran is also a Christian. While sliding into second 
base for his 300th steal, joining the 300–300 club on June 15, 2012, a 
cross necklace popped out of his jersey, and after the game, he told a 
reporter that "all the glory" was God's.[50] In 2004, Beltran was one of 
twenty four athletes who endorsed George W. Bush's reelection campaign.[51] 
Since establishing his foundation, Beltrán began a fund with part of his 
salary, intending to establish a high school focused on developing young 
athletes.[52] Construction of the Carlos Beltrán Baseball Academy began 
in 2009, being established in the municipality of Florida, Puerto Rico.[52] 
Beltran donated over $4 million to the academy, built on 20 acres (81,000 m2) 
of land donated by the local government.[53] The school opened in 2011, 
and graduated its first class in June 2013.[54] It accepts students between 
the ages of 14 to 18 years, with a curriculum that includes instruction 
by MLB players.[52] Beltrán maintains homes in Port Washington, New York 
and Manatí, Puerto Rico. Beltrán is currently represented by sports agent
