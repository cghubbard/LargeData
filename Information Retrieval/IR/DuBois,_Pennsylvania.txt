DuBois /ˈduːbɔɪz/ DOO-boys is a city in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, 
United States, 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Pittsburgh. The population 
was 7,794 at the 2010 census.[1] It is the principal city in the DuBois, 
PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. DuBois is also one of two principal cities, 
the other being State College, that make up the larger State College-DuBois, 
PA Combined Statistical Area. Settled in 1812 and platted in 1872, DuBois 
was incorporated as a borough in 1881 and as a city in 1914. The town was 
founded by John Rumbarger, for whom the town was originally named. The 
Rumbarger Cemetery is all that survives of this original settlement. The 
town was later renamed for local lumber magnate John DuBois,[2] who came 
from a longstanding American family of French Huguenot descent. In 1938, 
his nephew, John E. DuBois, donated the family mansion and estate as a 
permanent home for the DuBois Campus of Penn State University.[3] While 
DuBois was founded as a lumber town, the mining of bituminous coal quickly 
became the chief industry in DuBois. Over the years there have been numerous 
unsuccessful attempts to combine the city with the surrounding Sandy Township. 
Combined, the population of DuBois and Sandy Township is approximately 
18,000 people. The Commercial Hotel, since demolished, was listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places in 1985, and the DuBois Historic District 
was listed in 1997.[4] DuBois is located in northwestern Clearfield County

the most important tract of virgin timberland to be found in Pennsylvania 
and is a 35-mile drive from DuBois. Major Israel McCreight of DuBois was

Forest State Park, the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve 
a natural landmark. Cook Forest features 27 marked trails totaling some 
29 miles for hiking. The terrain is of rolling hills and cool valley streams. 
Special scenic areas are the old growth forest, Fire Tower/Seneca Point 
and the Clarion River. Among Cook Forest's primary attractions is the "Forest 
Cathedral" area of old growth white pine and hemlock, some trees of which 
top 180 feet. About 5,000 acres are open to hunting, trapping, and the 
training of dogs during established seasons. Common game species are deer, 
wild turkey, bear, and squirrel. The Clarion River flows along the park 
border and provides fishing for trout, warm-water game fish and panfish. 
Many visitors enjoy canoeing or kayaking down the river. DuBois is building 
a strong reputation for local entertainment and the arts in the tri-county 
area. DuBois is the hometown of educational entertainment specialist Gene 
Allen, known for his character education programs for schools and libraries.[24] 
More traditional arts can be found at the Winkler Gallery of Fine Arts, 
founded by local artist Perry Winkler. The Winkler Gallery of Fine Arts 
opened its doors in December 2003 as a co-op for local artists to display 
and sell their work to the public. The gallery hosts the annual DuBois 
Arts Festival. Along with supporting the local artist community, the gallery 
provides art education for the residents of the DuBois area through artist 
workshops in several mediums such as stained glass, silk painting, and 
watercolors.[25] Theater groups "Reitz Theater Players" and "Cultural Resources 
Inc." perform a selection of theater productions each year at the Paul 
G. Reitz Theater in downtown DuBois.[26] There seems to be some debate 
as to exactly when Frank Hahne came to DuBois and broke ground on his own 
facility. One source claims 1898, another 1897. It seems most likely that 
this occurred between April and the end of 1896. It was on April 16, 1896, 
that the DuBois Weekly Courier reported: "Some new developments in connection 
with the brewery may be looked for in the near future." There were a number 
of reasons Hahne chose the DuBois site for his facility, but the most frequently 
cited was the excellence of the water supply. He purchased 2,300 acres 
(9.3 km2) surrounding the local reservoir to protect the watershed from 
pollution. By 1906, the brewery had four products on the market: DuBois 
Wurzburger, Hahne's Export Pilsener, DuBois Porter, and DuBois Budweiser. 
The Budweiser name would be at the center of controversy for 60 years between 
DuBois Brewing and Anheuser-Busch. The DuBois brands soon traveled far 
and wide for a brewery of its size, ranging up to 150 miles (240 km) away 
and selling well in Buffalo, Erie and Pittsburgh. The brewery's 300-barrel 
kettle was kept busy churning out brands, while the left-over grain materials 
were pressed and sold for cattle feed and grist mills in the rural areas 
surrounding DuBois. As with many other American breweries, DuBois Brewing 
moved right along until 1918 and the advent of Prohibition. The brewery 
shifted production to "near beer" and soft drinks and opened the H&G Ice 
Company. According to the April 7, 1933, DuBois Courier, the brewery won 
the honor of being one of only two breweries in the entire nation that 
had never violated or been suspected of violating the Prohibition laws 
since the 18th Amendment went into effect. As a result, DuBois Brewing 
Company was issued license number G-2, allowing them to resume brewing 
immediately upon the enaction of the 21st Amendment. Frank Hahne died in 
1932, and the brewery was passed to his only son, Frank Hahne Jr., whose 
own only son died in infancy, leaving the family without an heir. Hahne 
Jr. sold the brewery to Pittsburgh Brewing in 1967. The brewery was torn
