The Chicago White Sox are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Chicago, Illinois. They play in the American League Central division. 
Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the White Sox have selected 
65 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player 
Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning amateur 
baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball 
clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous 
season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving 
the first pick.[1] In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous 
off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] Of the 
65 players picked in the first round by the Chicago White Sox, 31 have 
been pitchers, the most of any position; 20 of them were right-handed, 
while 11 were left-handed. Twelve outfielders, eight catchers, five shortstops, 
five third basemen, and four first basemen were also taken. The team has 
never drafted a player at second base.[3] Fourteen of the players came 
from high schools or universities in the state of California, and Florida 
follows with eight players.[3] The White Sox have also drafted six players 
from their home state of Illinois.[3] One player has won a championship 
with the team; Aaron Rowand (1998) was part of the 2005 World Series championship 
team.[4] Frank Thomas (1989) was a member of the Chicago White Sox for 
16 years, including the 2005 season, but was not part of the World Series 
roster due to injury.[5] Thomas is also the only first-round draft pick 
to win the Most Valuable Player Award, winning the honor in both 1993 and 
1994.[6] One pick, 1987 selection Jack McDowell, has won the Cy Young Award 
with the team; he won it in 1993.[7] The White Sox had the first overall 
selection twice in the draft, which they used on Danny Goodwin (1971) and 
Harold Baines (1977). The White Sox have made 16 selections in the supplemental 
round of the draft and 5 compensatory picks since the institution of the 
First-Year Player Draft in 1965.[3] These additional picks are provided 
when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[2][8][V] 
or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous 
year.[9] The White Sox have failed to sign three of their first-round picks: 
Danny Goodwin (1971), Steve Buechele (1979), and Bobby Seay (1996). The 
White Sox did not receive any compensation for Goodwin or Buechele, but
