As player As coach Clyde Ellsworth "Buzzy" Wares (March 23, 1886 – May 
26, 1964) was an American Major League Baseball shortstop during the second 
decade of the 20th century and a longtime coach in the Majors. Born in 
Newberg Township, Michigan, Wares attended Kalamazoo College. He stood 
5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) (178 cm), weighed 160 pounds (72.6 kg), and threw and 
batted right-handed. Wares played only one month and one full season of 
Major League ball. He came to the St. Louis Browns of the American League 
late in the 1913 campaign, and stayed through 1914. He appeared in 90 games, 
and batted .220 in 250 at bats, with 55 hits, no home runs and 24 runs 
batted in. His manager, however, was Branch Rickey, and when Rickey was 
the general manager of the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League, 
he hired Wares as a coach in 1930. Wares would remain on the Redbirds' 
staff through 1952, a string of 23 consecutive seasons, during which time 
St. Louis won seven NL pennants and five World Series. Wares worked under 
eight different Cardinal managers in that span. During his minor league 
playing career (1905–20), Wares twice led his league in fielding percentage, 
although he did commit a league-leading 107 errors in 224 games played 
for Oakland of the Pacific Coast League in 1910. That season, however, 
Wares led the PCL with 790 assists, and had 1,287 total chances, for a 
fielding percentage of .917. Buzzy Wares died at age 78 in South Bend,
