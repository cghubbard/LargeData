As player As manager John Michael "Red" Corriden (September 4, 1887 – September 
28, 1959) was a player, coach, manager and scout in American Major League 
Baseball. A shortstop and third baseman in his playing days, Corriden appeared 
in 223 big league games with the St. Louis Browns (1910), Detroit Tigers 
(1912) and Chicago Cubs (1913–15), batting .205 with 131 hits. He was born 
in Logansport, Indiana. He had an important role in the 1910 Chalmers Award 
batting title controversy. When playing third base, he was ordered by catcher 
Jack O'Connor to play back, giving Nap Lajoie a good chance to beat out 
bunts for hits that could help win the award for Lajoie instead of the 
widely hated Ty Cobb, who had been leading in the batting average race 
prior to the last-day's doubleheader, .385 to .376. After his playing career 
ended, Corriden coached and managed in the minor leagues during the 1920s. 
In 1932 he was named a coach with the Cubs. As a Major League coach for 
the next 17 years, Corriden would assist managers such as Rogers Hornsby, 
Charlie Grimm, Gabby Hartnett, Leo Durocher and Bucky Harris with the Cubs 
(1932–40), Brooklyn Dodgers (1941–46) and New York Yankees (1947–48) — 
working for five pennant-winning teams. The Yankees' "raiding" of Corriden 
and Chuck Dressen from the coaching staff of Durocher's Dodgers was one 
of the factors in the public feud between Durocher and Yankee president 
Larry MacPhail that spilled into print in early 1947. When a newspaper 
column under Durocher's name accused MacPhail of allowing known gamblers 
to use his box seats at spring training games in Havana, Cuba, Commissioner 
of Baseball Happy Chandler initiated an investigation that resulted in 
Durocher's suspension for the entire '47 campaign. Corriden left the Yankees 
after the 1948 season. He began 1950 in the familiar role of coach for 
the Chicago White Sox when his only MLB managing chance occurred. On May 
26, 1950, with the Sox only 8–22 and last in the American League, skipper 
Jack Onslow was dismissed and Corriden finished out the season. Under Corriden, 
the White Sox won only 52 of 124 games, but climbed two places, finishing 
sixth. He returned to the Dodgers in 1951, as a scout. His son, John M. 
Jr., an outfielder in professional baseball, had a brief major league trial 
as a pinch runner with Brooklyn in 1946. Corriden died in Indianapolis, 
Indiana, at 72 from a heart attack suffered while watching the 1959 National 
League playoff series between the Milwaukee Braves and the Dodgers on television.
