Smithtown is a town in Suffolk County, New York, United States, on the 
North Shore of Long Island. The population was 117,801 at the 2010 census. 
The census-designated place (CDP) of Smithtown lies within the town's borders. 
Smithtown originally, known as "Smithfield",[citation needed] was first 
settled around 1665. Local legend has it that, after rescuing a Native 
American chief's kidnapped daughter, Richard Smith was told that the chief 
would grant title to all of the land Smith could encircle in one day "on 
a bull". Smith chose to ride the bull on the longest day of the year (summer 
solstice), to enable him to ride longer "in one day". The land he acquired 
in this way is said to approximate the current town's location. There is 
a large anatomically correct[3] statue of Smith's bull, known as Whisper, 
at the fork of Jericho Turnpike (New York State Route 25) and St. Johnland 
Road (New York State Route 25A). The border between Smithtown and the town 
of Huntington is partially defined by Bread and Cheese Hollow Road (Suffolk 
County Road 4), so named after Bread and Cheese hollow, which according 
to legend is where Smith stopped on his ride to have a lunch of bread and 
cheese. The road is reputed to follow part of his original ride. The border 
between Smithtown and Huntington was also the site of Fort Salonga, a British 
fort that was the site of a battle of the American Revolution during 1781.
