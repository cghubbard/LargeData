As player As manager Robert Daniel Kennedy (August 18, 1920 – April 7, 
2005) was a right fielder/third baseman, manager and executive in Major 
League Baseball. From 1939 to 1957, Kennedy played for the Chicago White 
Sox (1939–42, 1946–48, 1955–56, 1957), Cleveland Indians (1948–54), Baltimore 
Orioles (1954–55), Detroit Tigers (1956) and Brooklyn Dodgers (1957). He 
batted and threw right-handed. After his playing career, Kennedy managed 
the Chicago Cubs (1963–65) and Oakland Athletics (1968). His son, former 
major league catcher Terry Kennedy, was a four-time All-Star and minor 
league manager. Kennedy was born in Chicago. A line-drive hitter, he was 
blessed with a strong and accurate throwing arm. On June 22, 1937, the 
night before the White Sox signed him, Kennedy was working as a 16-year-old 
popcorn vendor at Comiskey Park during the World Heavyweight Boxing Title 
between Joe Louis and James J. Braddock. Kennedy debuted a year later, 
and became the starting third baseman in 1940. In 1940, he became the first 
teenaged major leaguer since 1900 to play 150 games in a season.[1] After 
a break of three years to serve in the military during World War II, he 
returned, to play mostly in right field. In the 1948 midseason Kennedy 
was sent to Cleveland in the same trade that brought Pat Seerey to Chicago. 
Kennedy hit .301 the rest of the year and became a member of the last World 
Championship Indians team. His most productive season came in 1950, when 
he posted career-highs in batting average (.291), runs (79), hits (157) 
and doubles (27). The same season, he started two triple plays from the 
right field, matching Indians left fielder Charlie Jamieson's two triple 
plays of 1928. Kennedy was traded to the newly relocated Baltimore Orioles 
in 1954. On July 30, he belted the first grand slam for Baltimore against 
Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds. In 1955, Kennedy was purchased by the White 
Sox and sent to Detroit in 1956. Released in April 1957, he signed as a 
free agent with the White Sox, for his third stint with the club. A month 
later, he was selected off waivers by the Brooklyn Dodgers, being released 
at the end of the season. Following his retirement, he was a scout and 
farm system director for the Indians,[2] and manager of the Triple-A Salt 
Lake City Bees. In 1962, Kennedy was named to the Cubs' College of Coaches 
and designated as "head coach" for an indefinite period. The Cubs had experimented 
with having a committee of coaches run the team on the field since 1961. 
After the 1963 Cubs posted their first winning record in 17 years, Kennedy 
began to assert a more traditional managerial authority over the team. 
He served as head coach from 1963 until June 13, 1965, posting a 162–198 
record. He served as special assistant to Cub general manager John Holland, 
manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers' Double-A Albuquerque affiliate, and 
a coach with the Atlanta Braves until 1968. In 1968, when the Athletics 
moved from Kansas City to Oakland, Kennedy was their first manager.[3] 
Oakland finished sixth in a 10-team league with an 82–80 record, a notable 
improvement from the 62–99 last-place 1967 Athletics. It was also the franchise's 
first winning season since 1952, when the team was still in Philadelphia. 
According to the 1972 book Mustache Gang, authored by Ron Bergman, on the 
last day of the season Kennedy walked into Charlie Finley's office, expecting 
an extension. Five minutes later, Kennedy had been fired. After that, he 
spent six years (1970–75) as director of player development and director 
of player personnel of the St. Louis Cardinals, and 1976 as a member of 
the Seattle Mariners' start-up baseball operations team preparing for the 
club's 1977 debut in Major League Baseball. Kennedy then returned to Chicago 
for 4½ seasons, beginning in 1977, as the Cubs' general manager. He was 
released from the position in May 1981.[2] Rounding out his baseball career, 
Kennedy then served as a senior baseball operations executive for the Houston 
Astros (1982–85) and San Francisco Giants (1986–92),[2] assisting his former 
Cleveland teammate Al Rosen, then the president or general manager of those 
teams. In a 16-season playing career, Kennedy was a .254 hitter with 63 
home runs and 514 RBI in 1,483 games. As a manager, he posted a 264–278 
record in two-plus seasons. Bob Kennedy died in Mesa, Arizona, at age of
