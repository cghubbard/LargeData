Executive of the Year, 2003 Brian R. Sabean (born July 1, 1956), as of 
2015, is the executive vice president of baseball operations of the San 
Francisco Giants. He served as the team's general manager for eighteen 
seasons, from 1997 to 2014. He succeeded general manager Bob Quinn. The 
Giants had a winning record in thirteen of the eighteen seasons in which 
Sabean served as general manager.[1] Prior to his tenure, the team had 
suffered losing seasons in five out of six years. He is a native of Concord, 
New Hampshire. Sabean attended Concord High School and Eckerd College (of 
St. Petersburg, Florida), playing with former major leaguer Joe Lefebvre 
on both schools' baseball teams.[2] Prior to starting his scouting career, 
Sabean was an assistant baseball coach at Saint Leo University in 1979 
and University of Tampa from 1980 to 1982.[3] He was promoted to head coach 
in 1983 and led Tampa to its first-ever NCAA regional tournament appearance 
in 1984.[3] Sabean began his involvement in Major League Baseball as a 
scout for the New York Yankees organization in 1985. Sabean was promoted 
to Director of Scouting in 1986 and Vice President of Player Development/Scouting 
in 1990.[3] With the Yankees, he drafted or signed as amateurs the likes 
of Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, J. T. Snow, Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte.[4][5] 
Sabean joined the Giants in 1993, serving as assistant to the general manager 
and vice president of scouting/player personnel. Sabean served one year 
as senior vice president of player personnel in 1995 before his promotion 
to general manager in 1996.[3] When Sabean replaced Bob Quinn in 1996, 
the team was in disarray, finishing last place in the National League West 
with 94 losses.[6][7] Sabean is often credited for the team's turnaround,[8] 
but his first major decision was very controversial at the time, trading 
fan favorite Matt Williams to the Cleveland Indians for José Vizcaíno, 
Joe Roa, Julián Tavárez and Jeff Kent. Sabean received so much criticism 
in San Francisco for the trade[9] that he had to defend himself in the 
media, declaring, "I am not an idiot."[10][11] The trade looked better 
in hindsight as Kent tallied over 100 RBIs in each of six seasons with 
the Giants and was named National League MVP in 2000, while Williams was 
traded again after one season with the Indians.[12][13] Sabean also signed 
free-agent centerfielder Darryl Hamilton and traded for first baseman J. 
T. Snow,[8] and bolstered the pitching staff with a midseason trade with 
the Chicago White Sox to acquire three pitchers.[14] In 1997, the Giants 
won their first N.L. West title since 1989, finishing with a 90–72 record, 
the first of eight straight winning seasons.[15] This eight-year stretch 
was one of the more successful in Giants franchise history, with the Giants 
averaging 92 wins per season.[16] During these years, Sabean's strategy 
was to trade away young prospects for veteran position players while developing 
the organization's pitching talent.[17][18] Sabean traded away many prospects 
that never materialized into major leaguers in exchange for experienced 
major leaguers during late season pushes toward the playoffs.[19][20] These 
trades have included All-Stars Jeff Kent, Jason Schmidt, Robb Nen, Kenny 
Lofton, Andrés Galarraga, Ellis Burks, Joe Carter, Roberto Hernández, Wilson 
Álvarez, and José Mesa.[19] After the Giants narrowly lost the 2002 World 
Series, Sabean was forced to dramatically retool. The Giants lost several 
key players, including Jeff Kent, Reggie Sanders, Jay Witasick, David Bell, 
and Aaron Fultz to free agency. Sabean signed veterans José Cruz, Jr., 
Neifi Pérez, Edgardo Alfonzo, and Ray Durham to replace some of the free 
agents the Giants lost.[21] He also traded away fan favorite Russ Ortiz 
(to the Braves for Damian Moss) and Liván Hernández, the losing pitcher 
of Game 7 of the 2002 World Series.[22] Sabean hired Felipe Alou to replace 
fan favorite Dusty Baker who became the manager of the Chicago Cubs. Despite 
these major roster moves, the Giants won 100 games in 2003. Sabean was 
named Executive of the Year by the Sporting News in 2003, the first time 
a member of the Giants organization had received that award since Al Rosen 
in 1987.[23] The trade of Moss and Kurt Ainsworth for Sidney Ponson, which 
Sabean arranged late in the 2003 season, was criticized by some Giants 
fans and columnists.[17] Ponson returned to the Orioles after only a few 
months on the Giants, during which he posted a 3–6 record and 3.71 ERA 
in the regular season,[24] and one poor start in the postseason.[25] In 
addition, as time went on, Sabean's trade of Francisco Liriano, Boof Bonser, 
and Joe Nathan for A. J. Pierzynski at the end of the 2003 season drew 
more criticism.[26] Pierzynski remained on the Giants for one year, while 
Nathan developed into one of baseball's premier closers. Liriano became 
an All-Star in 2006, his rookie season, though he suffered injury later 
that year and would not be a productive starter until 2010.[27] After the 
Giants narrowly missed the playoffs in 2004, fans began to criticize Sabean 
for his player personnel moves.[28] Sabean continued to build a team of 
veterans around Barry Bonds but some of them began to achieve below expectations. 
Edgardo Alfonzo did not put up the same offensive numbers as he did when 
he was with the New York Mets.[29] Second baseman Ray Durham spent more 
time on the disabled list than he had previously in his career. In 2004, 
the Giants had not developed a homegrown position player since 2000.[19] 
Sabean defended himself in a press conference, dismissing his critics as 
a "lunatic fringe".[28] Some fans took up "lunatic fringe" as a rallying 
cry, printing up T-shirts with the phrase and wearing them to the ballpark.[citation 
needed] Still, the 1997–2004 stretch was still a very successful time in 
Giants history with eight straight winning seasons. That time period overlapped 
with the Giants moving into Pacific Bell Park in downtown San Francisco. 
Because the ballpark was privately financed, the Giants were dependent 
on high attendance rates to pay their mortgage and remained in constant 
"win-now" mode.[28][30][31][32] Prior to the 2004 season, Sabean faced 
some criticism for his offseason moves, especially for not signing a closer 
to replace the injured Robb Nen and the departing Tim Worrell, and for 
not signing a power hitter to protect Barry Bonds in the lineup.[33] The 
critics' concerns were borne out as Matt Herges struggled in the closer 
role, and without protection, Barry Bonds set single-season records with 
232 walks and 120 intentional walks. Following the season, Sabean attempted 
to address both of these problems, signing Armando Benítez as the team's 
new closer[34] and Moisés Alou to protect Bonds.[35] However, both Benítez 
and Bonds spent significant time on the disabled list, and 2005 was the 
first losing season of Sabean's tenure. Sabean faced increasing criticism 
that the Giants' success was more related to Bonds than him, and that he 
was too enamored with older players.[36] In November 2004, The Hardball 
Times calculated average ages and win shares for all Major League Baseball 
teams and found that the Giants had the second-highest Win Share Age at 
33.0, and consistently placed in the top five over the past several seasons.[37] 
One Hardball Times writer predicted that the Giants' aging players would 
stop producing in the future.[38] In addition to Barry Bonds, Sabean has 
contracted the services of aging veterans such as Reggie Sanders, Marquis 
Grissom, Michael Tucker, Omar Vizquel, Moisés Alou, Mike Matheny, Steve 
Finley (via trade), Randy Winn, J. T. Snow, Matt Morris, Armando Benítez, 
and Tim Worrell during his tenure. After his contract expired, Giants manager 
Felipe Alou criticized Sabean's strategy of signing older players, saying, 
"I don't believe one manager enjoys having players die in their hands," 
in reference to several older players whose careers ended with the Giants.[39] 
During this period, Sabean followed a strategy of avoiding high draft picks, 
telling the San Francisco Chronicle, "Quite frankly, we're very reluctant 
to overspend in the draft. We're cautious in that regard because it's so 
fallible. Our focus is spending as much as we can and being as wise as 
we can at the major-league level and using the minor leagues as a supplement 
and not necessarily leaning on it totally. Teams that are allowed to have 
a three-to- five-year plan and allowed to lose or explain to their fans 
they're in a rebuilding mode have a greater latitude than we do. We always 
have to be in a reloading mode".[19] The Giants ranked 22nd in baseball 
on money spent in the draft and internationally between 2000 and 2004.[19] 
On several occasions, Sabean's signing of veteran players before the arbitration 
deadline cost the team future draft picks. In 2004, Sabean forfeited the 
team's number one pick to sign Michael Tucker.[17] In 2005, the Giants 
didn't pick until the fourth round after surrendering their first three 
selections to sign Benítez, Mike Matheny, and Omar Vizquel.[40] The Giants 
did draft and sign first-round pitcher Tim Lincecum in the 2006 draft. 
Among early draft picks the Giants have used in Sabean's tenure, the majority 
were used on pitching talent (also see: Jesse Foppert, Kurt Ainsworth, 
Jerome Williams, Matt Cain, and Noah Lowry). Following losing seasons in 
2005 and 2006 and his signing of Barry Zito to a controversial record-setting 
contract, many fans and media commentators speculated that Sabean's job 
could be in jeopardy if the team did not improve in 2007.[41] Team president 
Peter Magowan declared before the start of 2007 season that all Giants 
employees were on the "hot seat".[42] However, the Giants rewarded Sabean 
with a two-year contract extension through the 2009 season following the 
All-Star break despite the Giants being in last place in the National League 
West.[42][43][44] In previous years, Sabean had been under some pressure 
to put a team that could "win now" around Barry Bonds instead of rebuilding. 
Consequently, some critics have blamed Giants ownership and Peter Magowan 
for the Giants' losing seasons instead of Sabean.[45][46] After the 2006 
season, Magowan and Sabean acknowledged that the previous strategy was 
no longer working, with Sabean saying, "Older and experienced hasn't worked."[47] 
Pursuing a rebuilding strategy, the Giants did not re-sign Bonds after 
the 2007 season[48] and drafted Madison Bumgarner and Buster Posey in the 
first round of the 2007 and 2008 drafts, respectively.[49] In 2009, with 
a re-stocked farm system and a surprise 88-win season, the Giants extended 
Sabean's contract through the 2011 season.[50] In 2010, several key trades 
and free agent signings by Sabean such as Aubrey Huff, as well as Sabean's 
trade of starting catcher Bengie Molina to the Texas Rangers in May to 
open up the catcher's spot for rookie Buster Posey, paid off as the Giants 
won the National League West for the first time since 2003 with a 92–70 
record. Midseason acquisitions included Javier López, Pat Burrell, and 
Cody Ross. Despite being heavy underdogs in the NLCS and World Series, 
the Giants defeated the Atlanta Braves in four games in the National League 
Division Series, and the two time defending National League Champion Philadelphia 
Phillies in six games in the National League Championship Series. They 
then defeated the Texas Rangers in five games in the World Series for the 
team's first title in San Francisco, and the first title for the organization 
since 1954.[51] In 2012, the Sabean traded for Melky Cabrera[52] and Ángel 
Pagán[53] in the offseason and acquired Marco Scutaro and Hunter Pence 
before the trading deadline.[54] Buster Posey was named National League 
MVP, and Scutaro was named MVP of the 2012 NLCS as the Giants went on to 
win the World Series again in 2012, beating the Detroit Tigers in a four-game 
sweep. In 2014, the Giants won the World Series for the third time in five 
seasons, defeating the Kansas City Royals in seven games, with Madison 
Bumgarner earning both NLCS and World Series MVP honors and setting a record 
for most postseason innings pitched.[55][56] In a contrast from Sabean's 
earlier years, the Giants' entire postseason infield was filled with home-grown 
talent: catcher Buster Posey, first baseman Brandon Belt, second baseman 
Joe Panik, shortstop Brandon Crawford, and third baseman Pablo Sandoval.[57] 
In April 2015, Sabean was promoted to Executive Vice President of Baseball 
Operations, ceding day-to-day operations to Bobby Evans while taking on 
a more active role in player evaluations.[58] Sabean's 18 years as the 
Giants' general manager was the longest run by a general manager in the 
club's history, surpassing Spec Richardson (seven seasons, 1975–81), Al 
Rosen (seven seasons, 1986–92) and Tom Haller (five seasons, 1981–85). 
Sabean had the longest tenure with the same club among active general managers. 
During his tenure, the Giants won three World Series (2010, 2012, and 2014), 
four National League pennants (2002, 2010, 2012, and 2014), five National 
League West Division flags (1997, 2000, 2003, 2010, and 2012), two National 
League Wild Cards (2002, 2014), and forced a National League Wild Card 
tie-breaker game with Chicago in 1998. On two other occasions, the club 
was eliminated from post season contention on the last day of the season. 
He guided the club to seven post season berths—the club's most since it 
made eight appearances in a 14-season span from 1911 to 1924. From 1997 
to 2014, the Giants recorded the third-best winning percentage in the National 
League (.534, 1,556–1,358), behind only the Braves and Cardinals.[59] His 
.534 career winning percentage ranks 10th all-time among all general managers 
since 1950 who served at least 10 years.[60] In late 2007 and early 2008, 
Sabean and Giants owner Peter Magowan drew some criticism in the Mitchell 
Report when it was revealed Giants trainer Stan Conte came to Sabean and 
told him he suspected Bonds trainer Greg Anderson was distributing steroids 
and Giants management didn't investigate or tell Major League Baseball.[61] 
Conte had been approached by a player.[61] In the January 2007 Congressional 
hearings on performance enhancing drugs, Congressman Henry Waxman asked 
Commissioner Bud Selig to discipline Sabean and Magowan for their culpability.[62] 
Some sports insiders argued that Magowan and Sabean actions on steroids 
was not any different from other clubs at the time.[61] In June 2011, Sabean 
was the subject of controversy over comments he made regarding Scott Cousins 
after Cousins' collision with Giants catcher Buster Posey, which resulted
