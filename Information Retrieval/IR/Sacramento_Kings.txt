The Sacramento Kings are an American professional basketball team based 
in Sacramento, California. The Kings compete in the National Basketball 
Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Western Conference Pacific 
Division. The Kings are the only team in the major professional North American 
sports leagues located in Sacramento. The team played its home games at 
the Sleep Train Arena from 1988 to 2016; beginning with the 2016–17 season, 
the Kings will play home games at the Golden 1 Center. The Kings are the 
oldest franchise in the NBA, and one of the oldest continuously operating 
professional basketball franchises in the nation. They originated in Rochester, 
New York as the Rochester Seagrams (a semi-professional team) in 1923 and 
joined the National Basketball League in 1945 as the Rochester Royals.[7] 
They jumped to the Basketball Association of America, forerunner of the 
NBA, in 1948. As the Royals, the team was often successful on the court, 
winning the NBA championship in 1951. However, they found it increasingly 
difficult to turn a profit in the comparatively small market of Rochester, 
and relocated to Cincinnati in 1957, becoming the Cincinnati Royals. In 
1972, the team relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, and was renamed as the 
Kansas City-Omaha Kings because it initially split their home games between 
Kansas City and Omaha, Nebraska. In 1975, the Kings ceased playing home 
games in Omaha and simply became the Kansas City Kings. The team again 
failed to find success in that market, and moved to Sacramento in 1985. 
The Royals defected to the NBL's rival, the Basketball Association of America, 
in 1948. In 1949, as a result of that year's absorption of the NBL by the 
BAA, the Royals became members of the newly formed NBA along with the Fort 
Wayne Pistons, Minneapolis Lakers, and Indianapolis (Kautskys) Jets. A 
year later, the BAA absorbed the remaining NBL teams to become the National 
Basketball Association. The move to the BAA took away Rochester's profitable 
exhibition schedule, and placed it in the same Western Division that Minneapolis 
was in. Of the two best teams in pro basketball, only one of them could 
play in the league finals from 1949 to 1954. Minneapolis, with George Mikan, 
was almost always a little better at playoff time than the Royals. With 
their smallish arena and now-limited schedule, the Royals became less profitable 
even as Harrison maintained a remarkably high standard for the team, which 
finished no lower than second in its division in both the NBL and BAA/NBA 
from 1945 to 1954. Harrison knew that the NBA was outgrowing Rochester, 
and spent most of the 1950s looking for a buyer for his team. The Royals 
won the NBA title in 1951 by defeating the New York Knicks 4 games to 3. 
It is the only NBA championship in the franchise's history. However, the 
title did not translate into profit for the Royals. The roster turned over 
in 1955, except for Bobby Wanzer; the team moved to the larger Rochester 
War Memorial. Now a losing team filled with rookies, the Royals still did 
not turn a profit. Meanwhile, the NBA was putting pressure on Harrison 
to sell or relocate his team to a larger city. With this in mind, the 1956–57 
season was the Royals' last in Rochester. The Royals' stay in Rochester 
featured the services of nine future members of the Basketball Hall of 
Fame, one member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and a Hollywood Walk 
of Famer: Al Cervi, Bob Davies, Alex Hannum, Les Harrison, Red Holzman, 
Arnie Risen, Maurice Stokes, Jack Twyman, Bobby Wanzer, Otto Graham, Chuck 
Connors and Jack McMahon. In April 1957, the Harrison brothers moved the 
Royals to Cincinnati. This move followed a well-received regular season 
game played at Cincinnati Gardens on February 1, 1957. The change of venue 
had been said to have been suggested by Jack Twyman and Dave Piontek, who 
were two of several roster players on the new Royals from that region. 
Cincinnati, which had a strong college basketball fan base and no NFL franchise 
to compete with, was deemed the best choice for the Harrisons. The Royals 
name continued to fit in Cincinnati, often known as the "Queen City". During 
the team's first NBA draft in Cincinnati, the team acquired Clyde Lovellette 
and guard George King. They teamed with the 1–2 punch of Maurice Stokes 
and Twyman to produce a budding contender in the team's very first season 
in the Queen City. Injury to Marshall and the loss of star guard Si Green 
to military service dropped the team into a tie for second place in the 
NBA Western Division during the 1957–58 season's second half. In the season's 
finale, All-Pro star Maurice Stokes struck his head when he fell after 
pursuing a rebound. He shook off the effects of the fall, even as he had 
briefly been unconscious. After Game One in the playoffs three days later, 
Stokes' head injury was greatly aggravated by airplane cabin pressure during 
the flight back to Cincinnati for Game Two. He suffered a seizure and was 
permanently hospitalized, a tragedy that greatly shook the team. Stokes, 
a tremendous talent who could play center, forward and guard, was 2nd in 
the NBA in rebounds and 3rd in assists, a double-feat only Wilt Chamberlain 
has matched for a full season. Without Stokes, the team nearly folded. 
Fellow All-Star Twyman rose to All-Pro level the next two seasons for Cincinnati, 
even as the team posted two 19-win seasons. The 1958–59 Cincinnati team 
featured five rookies, with Lovellette, King and other key players having 
left the team in the wake of Stokes' tragic injury. The Harrisons, under 
pressure to sell to a local group, sold to a local ownership headed by 
Thomas Woods. The fact that Stokes was simply dumped by the team and the 
new ownership infuriated many. Jack Twyman came to aid of his teammate 
and even legally adopted Stokes. Raising funds for Stokes' medical treatment, 
Twyman helped him until his death in April 1970. The 1973 feature film 
Maurie, which co-starred actors Bernie Casey and Bo Svenson, dramatized 
their story. Shooting often for the beleaguered team, Twyman was the second 
NBA player to average 30 points per game for an NBA season. Twyman and 
Stokes were later named Hall of Famers. In 1960, the team was able to land 
local superstar Oscar Robertson. Robertson led a team that included Twyman, 
Wayne Embry, Bob Boozer, Bucky Bockhorn, Tom Hawkins and Adrian Smith over 
the next three seasons. The Royals reversed their fortunes with Robertson 
and rose to title contender. An ownership dispute in early 1963 scuttled 
the team's playoff chances when new owner Louis Jacobs booked a circus 
for Cincinnati Gardens for the week of the playoff series versus the champion 
Boston Celtics. The Royals home games were at Xavier University's home 
Schmidt Field House. In late 1963, another local superstar, Jerry Lucas, 
joined the team. The Royals rose to second-best record in the NBA. From 
1963 to 1966, the Royals contended strongly against Boston and the Philadelphia 
76ers, but won no titles. The team's star players throughout the 1960s 
were Oscar Robertson and Jerry Lucas. Robertson met with individual success, 
averaging a triple-double in 1961–62 and winning the Most Valuable Player 
award in 1964. Robertson was a league-leading scorer and passer each season. 
Lucas was Rookie Of the Year in 1964, led the league in shooting, and later 
averaged 20 rebounds per game over three seasons. Both were All-NBA First 
Team selections multiple times. The team failed to keep promising players 
and played in the tough NBA East division, dominated by the Boston Celtics, 
even as a Baltimore team played in the West Division for three years, denying 
the team likely visits to the NBA Finals. In 1966, the team was sold to 
Max and Jeremy Jacobs. That same season, the Royals began playing some 
of their home games in neutral sites such as Cleveland (until the Cavaliers 
began play in 1970), Dayton and Columbus, Ohio which was the norm for the 
rest of the Royals tenure in the Queen City. New coach Bob Cousy traded 
Lucas in 1969. Robertson was traded to Milwaukee in 1970, where he immediately 
won an NBA title. The declining franchise left Cincinnati shortly thereafter, 
moving to Kansas City in 1972. The Royals, on moving to Kansas City, renamed 
themselves the Kings to avoid confusion with the Royals baseball team. 
The team initially divided its home games between Kansas City and Omaha 
until 1975, when it abandoned the Omaha market. During that time the team 
was officially called the "Kansas City-Omaha Kings". The move from Omaha 
marked the opening of the 16,785-seat Kemper Arena in Kansas City. During 
the first days the Kings played at the 7,316-seat Municipal Auditorium 
in Kansas City and the 9,300-seat Omaha Civic Auditorium in Omaha. The 
team netted a new superstar in Nate Archibald, who led the league in scoring 
and assists in the 1972–73 season. The Kings later played several home 
games in St. Louis during the early 1980s to large crowds. While still 
in Cincinnati, the Kings introduced a most unusual uniform design, which 
placed the player's surname below his number. The design remained intact 
through the first several seasons of the team's run in Sacramento, even 
when the shade of blue on the road uniforms was changed from royal blue 
to powder blue, and the script '"Kansas City"' which adorned the road jerseys 
was scrubbed after the move in favor of a repeat of the "Kings" script 
on the home shirts. The Kings' back jersey template was later adopted by 
the WNBA and the NBA Development League, as well the NBA during the All-Star 
Game since 2006. The Kings had some decent players throughout. Tom Van 
Arsdale, the shooting forward, "Jumpin" Johnny Green, and Matt Guokas helped 
Archibald in the first year in Kansas City. Toby Kimball was a fan favorite. 
Jimmy Walker teamed with Archibald as the Kings made the playoffs the second 
year. Sam Lacey, an effective passing center, became one of the most dependable 
players in the league. Archibald became the first player to lead the league 
in scoring and assists in the first season in Kansas City. However, the 
management traded Archibald, and wasted high draft picks. Bob Cousy gave 
way to Phil Johnson, who was fired midyear in 1977 and replaced by Larry 
Staverman, a player on the team on two separate occasions when it was in 
Cincinnati and who later became the Cleveland Indians groundskeeper. The 
Kings finally achieved some success in their new home when they hired Cotton 
Fitzsimmons as coach. Fitzsimmons won the Midwest Division in 1978–79 with 
rookie point guard Phil Ford, who was NBA Rookie of the Year in 1979. Kansas 
City was led by shooting guard Otis Birdsong, strong on both offense and 
defense, all-around shooting forward Scott Wedman, and passing center Sam 
Lacey, who had a trademark 25-foot (7.6 m) bank shot. They drew an average 
of 10,789 fans to Kemper Arena that season, the only time during their 
tenure in KC that average attendance was in five figures (the attendance 
at the peak was only two-thirds of Kemper's capacity). Most Kansas City 
sports fans preferred to spend their entertainment dollar on the Royals, 
who won the American League West division championship four times in five 
seasons between 1976 and 1980, and reached the 1980 World Series. The Kings 
made the playoffs in 1979–80 and again in 1980–81, despite finishing the 
1980–81 regular season at 40–42. The Kings made a run in the 1981 NBA Playoffs, 
reaching the Western Conference finals. Ernie Grunfeld played the point 
in this run in place of an injured Ford, as KC used a slow half-court game 
to win the first two rounds. Power forward Reggie King had a remarkable 
series, dominating the opposition. After upsetting the Phoenix Suns by 
winning Game 7 at Phoenix in the Conference Semifinals and becoming the 
2nd NBA road team to do so after leading series 3–1, they bowed to the 
Houston Rockets (who also went 40-42 in the 1980–81 regular season) in 
five games in the Conference Finals. Lacey, the last remaining Cincinnati 
Royal to play for the Kings, was completely dominated in the low post by 
Rockets superstar Moses Malone, who won the first of three consecutive 
NBA Most Valuable Player awards in 1980–81. However, a series of bad luck 
incidents prevented the team from building on its success. Cleveland Cavaliers 
owner Ted Stepien lured Wedman and Birdsong away with big contract offers. 
In 1979, the roof literally fell in at Kemper Arena because of a severe 
storm, forcing the team to play most of the 1979–80 season at the much 
smaller Municipal Auditorium. The ownership group sold the team to Sacramento 
interests for $11 million. The general manager was fired in a scandal in 
which he was found to be reusing marked postage stamps. When the Kings 
rehired Joe Axelson as general manager, they brought back the man who had 
previously traded Oscar Robertson, Norm Van Lier, Nate Archibald and Jerry 
Lucas, and used the third pick in the ABA dispersal draft on Ron Boone. 
Axelson stayed on after the Kings left Kansas City where, in their last 
game ever, fans wore Joe Axelson masks. Axelson later said he hoped his 
plane would never touch down in Kansas City. Axelson became the first general 
manager in the history of sports to fail with the same franchise in four 
different cities: Cincinnati, Kansas City, Omaha and Sacramento. He was 
not fired for good until he rehired coach Phil Johnson, whom he had fired 
in mid-season in Kansas City ten years before. The Kings also had the misfortune 
of entering this period competing with the Kansas City Comets for the winter 
sports dollar, when the Comets were led by marketers—the Leiweke brothers. 
Their final season, 1984–85, resulted in a 31–51 record as fans stayed 
away from Kemper Arena in droves, with average attendance of 6,410. Long-time 
ABA and NBA star, Don Buse, played his final professional season for the 
Kings. The Kings moved to their current home of Sacramento, California 
in the 1985–86 NBA season, with their first Sacramento season ending in 
the first round of the Western Conference 1986 NBA Playoffs. The starting 
lineup was Reggie Theus, LaSalle Thompson, Mark Olberding, Terry Tyler, 
and Mike Woodson, with Larry Drew, Eddie Johnson, Otis Thorpe, and Joe 
Kleine coming off the bench. However, despite fan loyalty the Kings saw 
little success in subsequent seasons, and the team did not make the playoffs 
again until the 1996 NBA Playoffs in the 1995–96 NBA season. Some of their 
failure was attributable to misfortunes such as the career-altering car 
crash suffered by promising point guard Bobby Hurley in 1993, and the suicide 
of Ricky Berry during the 1989 off-season; some was attributed to poor 
management such as the long tenure of head coach Garry St. Jean and the 
selection of "Never Nervous" Pervis Ellison with the first overall pick 
in the 1989 NBA draft. Current Kings television broadcaster Jerry Reynolds 
(1987, 1988–90) and NBA legend Bill Russell (1987–88) were the earliest 
head coaches. Ricky Berry was selected by the Kings in the first round, 
18th pick overall in the 1988 NBA draft. He had a dazzling rookie year 
in the 1988–89 season shooting 40.6% from three-point range. The Kings 
also drafted Vinny Del Negro (selected by the Kings in the second round, 
29th overall pick in the 1988 NBA draft) and acquired Rodney McCray from 
the Houston Rockets. In his first year with the Kings, McCray made (1988 
NBA All-Defensive First Team). It was the first season the Kings would 
play without Reggie Theus and LaSalle Thompson (both part in the original 
team from Kansas City) or Joe Kleine (selected by the Kings as first round, 
sixth pick overall in the 1985 NBA draft). Thompson was drafted by the 
Kings in the first round, fifth overall pick in the 1982 NBA draft. It 
was also the last year that Michael Jackson (selected by the New York Knicks 
in the second round, 47th pick overall in the 1986 NBA draft but who played 
his entire career with the Kings) and Ed Pinckney (selected 10th overall 
by the Phoenix Suns in the 1985 NBA draft and played for the Kings from 
1987 to 1989) played for the Kings. On February 23, 1989, Brad Lohaus and 
Danny Ainge were traded to the Kings from the Boston Celtics for Joe Kleine 
and Ed Pinckney. In June of the 1989 off-season, Lohaus was then acquired 
by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1989 NBA Expansion Draft. In August 
of the 1989 off-season, Berry was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot 
wound at his home in Fair Oaks, California just weeks before his 25th birthday 
following an argument with his wife. Following the loss of Ricky Berry, 
1989–90 season featured Pervis Ellison, who was first overall pick in the 
1989 NBA draft by the Kings, and acquisition Wayman Tisdale (from the Indiana 
Pacers, second pick overall in the 1985 NBA draft). An injury kept Ellison 
on the sidelines for 48 of 82 games of his rookie year, after which he 
was traded to the Washington Bullets. Tisdale would go on to play for the 
Kings for five years. It was the last season that Danny Ainge, Kenny Smith 
(who had an impressive showing in the 1990 NBA Slam Dunk Contest), Rodney 
McCray, Harold Pressley (selected by the Kings in the first round, 17th 
overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft), Vinny Del Negro, Greg Kite, and Ralph 
Sampson played for the Kings. In 1990, Ainge was traded to the Portland 
Trail Blazers, Kenny Smith was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, and Rodney 
McCray was traded to the Dallas Mavericks. Lionel Simmons – or L-Train 
– was drafted by the Kings in the 1990 NBA draft in the first round, 7th 
pick overall. In his first season, he made the NBA All-Rookie First Team. 
He would go on to play his entire career (1990–1997) with the Kings and 
had 5,833 career points. Antoine Carr (acquired from the Atlanta Hawks) 
played for the Kings in the 1990–91 NBA season and then was traded to the 
San Antonio Spurs. Free agent Leon Wood, who would later become an NBA 
official, played for the Kings but was let go on Christmas Eve of 1990.[8] 
Also notable that Bill Wennington was acquired from the Dallas Mavericks 
and played for the Kings for the 1990–91 season and after a successful 
career with the Chicago Bulls returned to the Kings for his final season 
in 1999–2000. The early 1990s were difficult for the Kings. Sacramento 
was known for having strong fan support, and while they won over 60% of 
their home games, the team struggled on the road, going 1–40 on the road 
in a single season. But prayers were answered when they acquired Mitch 
Richmond, who previously played for the Golden State Warriors. The former 
NBA Rookie of the Year was selected as an All-Star six times while making 
the All-NBA Second Team three times. Garry St. Jean was chosen as new coach 
in 1992 and coached the team all the way through 1997, where he was replaced 
by Eddie Jordan. During the 90's Sacramento had other stars like Spud Webb, 
Kurt Rambis, Wayman Tisdale, Walt Williams, Olden Polynice and Brian Grant, 
but they only lasted with the team for a few years. After the 1992–93 season, 
Rambis was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. After the 1993–94 season, 
Tisdale was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After the 1994–95 season, Webb 
was traded to the Atlanta Hawks for Tyrone Corbin. Midway through the 1995–96 
season, Williams was traded to the Miami Heat for Billy Owens (who was 
drafted by the Kings in 1991, and traded to Golden State for Richmond). 
After the 1996–97 season, Grant became a free agent and signed with the 
Portland Trail Blazers. One accomplishment the team achieved under St. 
Jean during their tenures was a playoff appearance in 1996. The series 
was lost 3–1 to the Seattle SuperSonics who, led by Gary Payton and Shawn 
Kemp, finished as that year's conference champions. They did not make a 
playoff appearance again while Richmond was still on the Kings. He was 
soon traded along with Otis Thorpe to the Washington Wizards for Chris 
Webber in May 1998. Although Richmond was lost, this trade proved to be 
one of the keys to finally achieving playoff success after so many seasons 
of mediocrity. The Kings began to emerge from mediocrity with the draft 
selection of Jason Williams in the 1998 NBA draft, the signing of Vlade 
Divac, and the trade for Chris Webber prior to the lockout-shortened season 
of 1998–99. These acquisitions coincided with the arrival of Peja Stojaković 
from Serbia, who had been drafted in 1996. Each of these moves was attributed 
to general manager Geoff Petrie, who has won the NBA Executive of the Year 
Award twice. Led by new head coach Rick Adelman, and aided by former Princeton 
head coach Pete Carril, the Kings' Princeton offense impressed others for 
its quick style and strong ball movement. Some criticized the Kings for 
their poor team defense, Williams's "flash over substance" style with its 
many turnovers, and Webber's failure to step up in important match-ups. 
Still, they quickly garnered many fans outside of California, many of whom 
were drawn to the spectacular pairing of Williams and Webber. In 1998–99, 
they went 27–23, their first winning season in nearly twenty years and 
their first since moving to Sacramento. The new arrivals Webber, Williams, 
and Divac all played key roles in this resurgence; Divac ranked near the 
top of the team in most statistics, Webber led the league in rebounds and 
was named to the All-NBA Second Team, and Williams was named to the NBA 
All-Rookie First Team. In the playoffs, they were matched up against the 
defending Western Conference Champions, the Utah Jazz. After winning Game 
1 by 20 points, the Jazz surrendered two consecutive playoff games to the 
Kings. They would turn the series around, however, and win the last two 
to keep the Kings from advancing in the playoffs. In 1999–2000, the Kings 
went relatively quiet; their only notable transaction was the acquisition 
of former Orlando Magic shooting guard Nick Anderson. They finished 8th 
in the Western Conference with a respectable 44–38 record and were matched 
up with the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. Once 
again, however, the Kings failed to advance, losing the series 2–3 against 
the Lakers. The following season, the Kings traded starting small forward 
Corliss Williamson to the Toronto Raptors for shooting guard Doug Christie, 
a move made to improve the subpar defense. They also drafted Turkish power 
forward Hedo Turkoglu, further improving their bench rotation. Stojakovic 
moved into the starting small forward role, where he and Webber proved 
to complement each other extremely well, and as the Kings continued to 
improve, their popularity steadily rose, culminating in a February 2001 
Sports Illustrated cover story entitled "The Greatest Show on Court" with 
Williams, Christie, Stojakovic, Webber, and Divac gracing the cover. That 
year, they went 55–27, their best in 40 years. In the playoffs, they won 
their first series in 20 years, defeating the Phoenix Suns three games 
to one, before being swept in the second round by the Lakers, who eventually 
won the NBA Championship. In July 2001, the Kings made a major move. Jason 
Williams was traded, along with Nick Anderson, to the Vancouver Grizzlies 
for Mike Bibby and Brent Price. Despite Williams's often spectacular play, 
the Kings had grown tired of his recklessness and turnovers; Bibby would 
provide much more stability and control at the point guard position. This 
move was complemented by the re-signing of Webber to a maximum-salary contract, 
securing their superstar long term. With Bibby taking over for Williams, 
they had their best season to date in 2001–02. Though not as exciting or 
flashy as they had been in previous years with Williams, the team became 
much more effective and disciplined with Bibby at the helm. They finished 
with a league-best record of 61–21, winning 36 of 41 at home. After easily 
winning their first two playoff matchups against the Stockton and Malone-led 
Jazz and the Dirk Nowitzki-led Dallas Mavericks, respectively, the Kings 
went on to play the archrival and two-time defending champion Los Angeles 
Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, regarded as one of the greatest 
playoff matchups in history. In a controversial series,[9] the Kings lost 
in seven games, one game away from what would have been the first NBA Finals 
and professional sports championship in Sacramento history. This was a 
crushing blow to the Kings; after losing to their archrivals in a highly 
controversial series, the team would begin to decline and age in the years 
that followed. Many commentators and journalists would question the decisions 
made by the referees during Game 6, specifically that the Lakers were awarded 
a staggering 27 free throws in the fourth quarter, many of which came from 
what were in retrospect proved to be no-calls.[10] Following Game 6 even 
print newspapers began to question the legitimacy of the game. Most notably, 
the New York Post ran a front cover with a headline entitled "Foul Play"; 
it also published a related article suggesting that the game was rigged.[11][12] 
NBA analyst David Aldridge (then working for ESPN) spoke on the game: The 
2002 Western Conference finals left many fans wondering whether the Kings 
could have gone on to win a title, and debate would continue for many years 
after the events of the series.[14] Later, due to allegations raised by 
former NBA referee Tim Donaghy, the NBA set up a review of the league's 
officiating. Lawrence Pedowitz, who led the review, concluded that while 
Game 6 featured poor officiating, there was no concrete evidence that the 
game had been fixed.[15] The Kings went 59–23 and won the division during 
the following season, seeking to avenge their playoff loss to the Lakers. 
After easily dispatching the Stockton and Malone-led Jazz in the first 
round and winning Game 1 against the Dirk Nowitzki-led Dallas Mavericks 
in the second round, the Kings appeared to be on the brink of another Western 
Conference Finals berth. However, Chris Webber sustained a devastating 
knee injury in Game 2, and the Kings lost in a gut-wrenching seven-game 
series. Webber's knee required major surgery. He returned mid-season in 
2003–04 a season in which the Kings were seeking another chance to avenge 
their playoff loss to the Lakers, but without his quickness and athleticism, 
which had been the focal point of his style of play, it wasn't the same. 
Despite that, the Kings still managed to defeat the Dirk Nowitzki-led Dallas 
Mavericks in the first round and after winning Game 1 against the Kevin 
Garnett-led Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round, the Kings appeared 
to be on the brink of their second Western Conference Finals berth in three 
years, but unfortunately the Kings ended the season on a sour note with 
a heartbreaking defeat to the Kevin Garnett-led Minnesota Timberwolves 
in a hard fought seven game series. The 2004–05 season marked change for 
the Kings, who lost three starters from the famed 2002 team. In the off-season 
of 2004, Divac signed with the Lakers, which prompted the Kings to sign 
Brad Miller to start at center. Early in the season, Christie was traded 
to the Orlando Magic for Cuttino Mobley, and in February, Webber was traded 
to the Philadelphia 76ers for three forwards (Corliss Williamson, Kenny 
Thomas, and Brian Skinner). Thomas and Skinner failed in their attempt 
to replicate Webber's impact, and as a result the team's record suffered. 
The Kings lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. 
The 2005 off-season continued with changes, when they traded fan-favorite 
Bobby Jackson for Bonzi Wells and acquired free agent Shareef Abdur-Rahim. 
The 2005–06 season started poorly since the Kings had a hard time establishing 
team chemistry. Newcomers Wells and Abdur-Rahim made major contributions 
early, but both were injured and missed a significant number of games. 
As the Kings' season continued, general manager Petrie decided to make 
a major move. Stojakovic was traded for Ron Artest, a talented yet volatile 
forward known for his temper. Despite doubts that he would be able to replace 
the huge production of Stojakovic, Artest and the Kings went 20–9 after 
the 2006 NBA All-Star break, the second best post-All-Star break record 
that season. Despite a winning record of 44–38, it was clear that they 
were not the same team of years past. The Kings were seeded 8th in the 
Western Conference playoffs and were matched up in the first round against 
the San Antonio Spurs. Though the Kings were surprisingly competitive, 
the Spurs eliminated them 4–2. This was the end of their era of competitiveness 
and to date, their last winning season. The 2006 off-season began with 
the disturbing news that head coach Rick Adelman's contract would not be 
renewed. The Kings named Eric Musselman as his replacement. In 2006–07, 
the disappointing play of the Kings was coupled with the distraction of 
legal troubles. Coach Eric Musselman pleaded no contest to DUI charges 
early in the season, while Artest got into trouble for neglect of his dogs, 
and was later accused of domestic assault. The Kings relieved Artest of 
basketball duties, pending investigation, then later reinstated him. They 
finished the season 33–49 (their worst in 9 years) which landed them in 
fifth place in the Pacific Division. They posted a losing record (20–21) 
at home for the first time since 1993–94. Their season included a seven-game 
losing-streak that lasted from January 4 to January 19. The Kings missed 
the 2007 NBA Playoffs, the first time in eight seasons. Musselman was fired 
in April. The Kings' future appeared to rest on the shoulders of Kevin 
Martin, who was a lead candidate for 2007 NBA Most-Improved Player of the 
Year. The 2007 off season was a time of change. Head coach Musselman was 
replaced by former Kings player, Reggie Theus. The Kings selected Spencer 
Hawes with the 10th overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft. In addition, they 
acquired Mikki Moore from the New Jersey Nets. Martin signed a contract 
worth $55 million, extending his period with the team for five more years. 
The Kings lost key players over the off-season, with backup Ronnie Price 
leaving for the Utah Jazz, and Corliss Williamson retiring. They claimed 
fourth-year Beno Udrih off waivers from Minnesota. Udrih quickly assumed 
the starting position for an injured Bibby. It was announced in February 
that the Kings had traded Bibby to the Atlanta Hawks for Tyronn Lue, Anthony 
Johnson, Shelden Williams, Lorenzen Wright and a 2nd round draft pick. 
The move was presumably made to clear cap space. Bibby had been last player 
from the Kings team that reached the Western Conference Finals in 2002. 
The Kings improved by 5 games and finished the 2007–08 season 38–44, and 
missed the playoffs by a bigger margin (12 games) than the previous season 
(8 games). They went 26–15 at home and 12–29 on the road. After selling 
out every home game since 1999, the 2007–08 season sold out only three 
games at ARCO Arena with attendance averaging 13,500 fans per home game, 
almost 4,000 below capacity. Following a quiet 2008 off-season, it was 
confirmed on July 29, 2008 that the Kings would trade Artest and the rights 
to Patrick Ewing, Jr. and Sean Singletary to the Houston Rockets in exchange 
for former King Bobby Jackson, Donté Greene, a future first round draft 
pick, and cash considerations[16] for Rashad McCants and center Calvin 
Booth. Reggie Theus was fired in the middle of the 2008–09 season, giving 
way to Kenny Natt as the interim head coach. The Kings continued to struggle 
under Natt, ending up with the NBA's worst record for the 2008–09 season 
at 17–65. On April 23, 2009, Kings' Vice President Geoff Petrie announced 
the firing of Natt and his four assistants, Rex Kalamian, Jason Hamm, Randy 
Brown and Bubba Burrage.[17] Despite having the best odds to win the top 
overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft, the Kings obtained the 4th overall 
pick, the lowest they could possibly pick, to the outrage of many fans. 
Along with new head coach Paul Westphal, they selected Tyreke Evans. With 
the 23rd pick, they selected Omri Casspi from Israel. On April 27, 2010, 
Evans was the first Sacramento era player to receive the NBA Rookie of 
the Year Award. Evans also became the 4th player in NBA history, joining 
Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James, to average 20 points, 
5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie. On June 24, 2010, the Kings 
selected DeMarcus Cousins with the 5th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They 
also selected Hassan Whiteside, with the 33rd pick of the 2010 NBA draft. 
Despite the excellent play of Cousins and Evans, both of whom were front-runners 
in Rookie of the Year voting[18][19] and received All-Rookie First Team 
honors,[20][21] the Kings still ranked near the bottom of the NBA, going 
25–57 in Evans' rookie year, and 24–58 in Cousins' rookie year. Much of 
this was due to the poor fit of the roster around Evans and Cousins, and 
the uninspired coaching of Westphal. The 2010–11 season was marked with 
uncertainty towards the end of the season. Frustrated by the lack of progress 
towards an arena and dwindling profits from other businesses, the Maloofs 
sought an immediate relocation of the franchise to Anaheim. The move seemed 
certain towards the end of the year, with Grant Napear and Jerry Reynolds 
emotionally signing off at the final home game vs. the Los Angeles Lakers. 
But after a vote by the NBA board of Governors, the relocation effort was 
ended, to the glee of the fans. In the 2011 NBA draft the Kings traded 
for the draft rights of Jimmer Fredette in a three-team deal with the Charlotte 
Bobcats and the Milwaukee Bucks, with the Kings receiving John Salmons 
sending Beno Udrih. This move was heavily panned by fans and media; by 
moving down in the draft and losing longtime starter Udrih for the unproductive 
Salmons, most found it difficult to find a bright spot in the deal. Westphal 
would shortly be fired, with Warriors assistant Keith Smart hired as his 
replacement. Around this time, the team took the slogan "Here we rise!" 
for its marketing campaign. Amidst various relocation rumors and locker 
room tensions, the Kings had yet another unsuccessful season. One of their 
few bright spots was rookie Isaiah Thomas. Due to criticisms about his 
height (5'9" in shoes) and playmaking ability, Thomas slipped to the 60th 
and final pick of the draft. Despite this, and the presence of college 
superstar Fredette, Thomas earned the starting spot, finishing the season 
with averages of 11 points and 4 assists per game and earned a selection 
to the NBA All-Rookie team. In the 2012 NBA draft they selected Thomas 
Robinson out of Kansas. Because of an unproductive rookie season by Robinson, 
he was traded with Francisco García and Tyler Honeycutt to the Houston 
Rockets in exchange for Patrick Patterson, Toney Douglas and Cole Aldrich.[22] 
On May 16, 2013, the Maloof family reached agreement to sell the Sacramento 
Kings to a group led by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Vivek Ranadivé 
for a then-record NBA franchise valuation of $535 million. Ranadivé, 55, 
named Raj Bhathal, 71, founder of Tustin-based Raj Manufacturing,[23] one 
of the largest swimwear companies in the nation, as one of the investors 
in a consortium to buy a majority stake in the Kings from the franchise's 
longtime owners, the Maloof family, for a reported $348 million. The group 
fought off a rival bid that would have moved the team to Seattle after 
the NBA's Board of Governors rejected investor Chris Hansen's bid to relocate 
the team.[24][25] The new owners intend to keep the team in Sacramento.[26] 
On May 28, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the sale, ending 
several years of efforts by other cities to take possession and move the 
Kings out of Sacramento.[27][28] On May 31, 2013, the Kings closed escrow, 
finalizing the sale to the Ranadivé group at a record valuation of $534 
million, beginning a new era for the franchise.[29] Plans were already 
underway to move forward on an arena, as the Downtown Plaza was reportedly 
being sold to the Sacramento ownership group. A month later, on July 30, 
Turner Construction was selected to be the builder of the arena. Once the 
sale had closed and ownership was transferred to Ranadivé, the Kings began 
making changes to the management and staff. Geoff Petrie[30] and Keith 
Smart[31] were released; Mike Malone[32] and Pete D'Alessandro[33] were 
brought in to replace them. Corliss Williamson, Brendan Malone, Chris Jent, 
and Dee Brown were brought in as assistant coaches. On July 10, NBA executive 
Chris Granger was hired as team president. On September 23, 2013, Shaquille 
O'Neal purchased a minority share of the team, jokingly dubbing the team's 
new organization the "Shaqramento Kings". These hires coincided several 
roster moves. In the 2013 NBA draft on June 27, the Kings selected Kansas 
shooting guard Ben McLemore, who was widely projected to go top-five, with 
the seventh overall pick. They also selected point guard and former McDonald's 
All-American Ray McCallum, Jr. from the University of Detroit with the 
36th pick. One week later, on July 5, the Kings sent former NBA Rookie 
of the Year Tyreke Evans to the New Orleans Pelicans in a three-team deal 
involving Robin Lopez, Greivis Vásquez, Jeff Withey, Terrel Harris, and 
picks. On July 9, the Kings traded a future second-round draft pick to 
the Bucks in exchange for defensive small forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, 
and on July 15, the Kings signed Carl Landry, who had played a stint with 
the team in its previous ownership, to a 4-year deal worth $28 million. 
The 2013–14 season was widely anticipated by Kings fans. Playing their 
first game on October 30, against the Nuggets, the Kings won 90–88, despite 
being without projected starters Landry and Mbah a Moute. They were led 
by a 30-point, 14 rebound performance from DeMarcus Cousins, and a putback 
dunk by Jason Thompson with under a minute to play which sealed the victory 
for the Kings. After the poor play of starting forwards John Salmons and 
Patrick Patterson through November, the Kings sought a change. On November 
26, newly acquired Luc Richard Mbah a Moute was traded for power forward 
Derrick Williams. Nearly two weeks later, on December 8, they acquired 
Rudy Gay in a blockbuster seven-player deal that sent the struggling Patterson 
and Salmons to Toronto along with Chuck Hayes and off-season acquisition 
Greivis Vásquez. Quincy Acy and Aaron Gray were also sent to the Kings. 
The organization sought to add depth to their lineup during the 2014 off-season 
to complement the Kings' star duo DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay.[34] Sacramento 
added Darren Collison, Ryan Hollins and Ramon Sessions through free agency 
signings, as well as drafting Nik Stauskas prior to the start of the 2014–15 
season. After an 11–13 start to the 2014–15 season, head coach Michael 
Malone was fired by the Sacramento Kings organization. Tyrone Corbin filled 
in for the Kings until Hall of Fame coach George Karl replaced him in February 
2015. On January 30, 2015, DeMarcus Cousins was named to replace the injured 
Kobe Bryant as a Western Conference All-Star in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game. 
Cousins' selection marked the first time a Kings player earned All-Star 
honors since Brad Miller and Peja Stojaković represented Sacramento in 
2004.[35] On March 3, 2015, the Kings announced former Sacramento center 
Vlade Divac as the new vice president of basketball operations.[36] Following 
the end of Sacramento's 29–53 season for 2014–15, The Kings made aggressive 
off-season moves in drafting Willie Cauley-Stein and acquiring Rajon Rondo, 
Kosta Koufos, Marco Belinelli, and Caron Butler in preparation for the 
2015–16 season.[37][38] The initial Rochester Royals logo featured a blue 
and white shield with the word "ROCHESTER" on the top, with a white banner 
with the word "ROYALS" on it. From the beginning the road uniforms were 
blue with the city name written in front, while home uniforms were white 
with the team name written in front. Red accents were added later in their 
Rochester tenure. Upon moving to Cincinnati in 1957, the team logo became 
a basketball with a cartoon face. The basketball was depicted as wearing 
a crown with the city of Cincinnati within it. The word "CINCINNATI" was 
featured above the logo while the word "ROYALS" was below. The crown also 
had the team name on it. This logo was white with blue outlines. The uniforms 
remained blue on the road and white at home, again with red accents and 
the city/team name designation on the respective uniforms. In the late 
1960s the Royals wore a uniform with the team name written vertically on 
the left side, with the number on the right. In 1971, the team would adopt 
a red crown with a blue half-basketball below it. The word "CINCINNATI", 
in blue, was placed above the logo. The word "ROYALS", in white, was placed 
on the crown. The logo change also reflected on the uniforms, now featuring 
a script 'Royals' in front with red numbers. However, blue names and numbers 
at home, and white names and numbers on the road were written at the back 
of the uniform, with the unusual arrangement of the number above the name 
being used for the first time. For the 1972–73 season, the renamed and 
relocated Kansas City-Omaha Kings kept their uniforms and logos, with the 
exception of the name change. After settling in Kansas City for good in 
1975, the Kings changed their road uniforms back to reading the city name 
in front. Beginning with the 1981–82 season, the road uniforms reverted 
to the team name in front, while numbers in front took on the same color 
schemes as the numbers in the back. Following their move from Kansas City 
in 1985 the Kings still used the same color scheme of red, white and blue. 
The logo of a crown atop a bottom half of the basketball was also carried 
over. However, the shades of blue used on their home and road uniforms 
were different for five seasons. The home uniforms use royal blue, while 
the road uniforms use powder blue. The striping patterns were also different 
between the two uniforms, with the script "Kings" wordmark on the sides 
of the road shorts, and basic side stripes on the home uniforms. Carrying 
over from Kansas City was the unusual placing of player names at the bottom 
of the number at the front of the uniforms The uniforms changed slightly 
in 1990, with royal blue now used on the road; the shorts now incorporate 
the Kings logo, and the name and number switch places to a more standard 
basketball jersey. The player names were now in a standard monotone serif 
font which was used by several NBA teams. This version would mark the last 
time the classic script "Kings" wordmark was used until 2005. In 1994, 
the Kings radically changed their look, adopting a new color scheme of 
purple, silver, black and white.[39] The uniform set consists of one wide 
side stripe running through the right leg of the shorts, with the primary 
Kings logo prominently featured. The home uniform is in white, while the 
road uniform is in black (by later coincidence, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings 
would use that exact color scheme). From 1994 to 1997, a half-purple, half-black 
uniform, featuring checkerboard side panels, was used as an alternate uniform, 
which was panned by fans. However, the uniform was revived for the 2012–13 
season during Hardwood Classics Nights. A new purple uniform, which shares 
the same template from the home and road uniforms, was introduced in the 
1997–98 season. Before the start of the 2002–03 NBA season, the Kings changed 
their uniforms once again. This set included a modernized version of the 
"Kings" script on the home jersey, and the city name on the purple road 
jersey. The side stripes now run through the uniform. In the 2005–06 season 
they introduced a gold alternate uniform, featuring the classic script 
"Kings" wordmark. However, this alternate lasted only two seasons. In 2008, 
the team introduced a new style of uniforms, with the names switching designations 
with a modernized "Kings" script on the road jersey in black text, and 
"Sacramento" on the home jersey still in white text. In doing this, the 
Kings became unique; most professional franchises place the team nickname 
on the home jerseys and the city name on the road jerseys. The numbers 
are black on both uniforms. The side panels were revamped, now only featured 
on the shorts and at the top half of the uniform. Before the 2011–12 season 
a black alternate uniform was introduced, sharing the same template as 
the home and road uniforms, but with the classic script "Kings" wordmark 
and silver numbers. For the 2014–15 season, the Kings made a few tweaks 
to their home and away uniforms. While the team kept the 2008-era template, 
they brought back the 1994–2002 "Kings" script from the primary logo on 
both uniforms, along with purple (home) and white (away) numbers. The black 
alternate uniform was kept without any alterations. In addition, the crown 
logo at the back was replaced by the NBA logo, while a gold tab above it 
represents the franchise's 1951 NBA championship.[40] The team announced 
it would wear an updated version of the powder blue 1985–90 uniforms 10 
times during the season, including at the last home game at Sleep Train 
Arena, April 9 vs. the Oklahoma City Thunder.[41] For the 2016–17 season, 
the Kings are changing their brand once more, adopting a logo reminiscent 
of their 1971–1994 design and dispatching of the black from their logo 
while keeping the purple and silver.[42] The Kings unveiled their new uniforms 
on June 15, 2016, featuring four different designs. Both the home white 
and purple away uniforms feature a modernized "Kings" script, an updated 
crown on top, and gray side stripes. The so-called 'City' uniforms are 
similar to the away uniforms, except that the abbreviation "SAC" in gray 
appears in front. The black 'Global' uniforms substitute the crown for 
a standing lion crest on top, along with a solid gray side stripe on the 
right and the primary logo on the left leg. All uniforms feature a baby 
blue collar, stitches, and tab that says "Sacramento Proud", a nod to the 
franchise's first few seasons in Sacramento.[43][44] Beginning with the 
2017–2018 season, the jerseys will be sponsored by Blue Diamond Growers.[45] 
Since the 1997–98 season, the official Kings mascot is Slamson the Lion.[46][47] 
Previous to that, the Kings mascot was "The Gorilla." Prior to moving to 
Ohio, the Royals' biggest rival was the Syracuse Nationals. That team went 
on to become the Philadelphia 76ers. This left upstate New York without 
a team until the Buffalo Braves were established in 1970. This third attempt 
did not last, with the Braves moving to San Diego, California in 1978 to 
become the San Diego Clippers. In 1970, the Cleveland Cavaliers were established. 
This brought a new rival for the Royals, as well as a new team in Ohio. 
This rivalry did not last, and the Royals moved to Kansas City only a few 
years later. Although the NBA previously had a team in St. Louis, Missouri 
in the form of the St. Louis Hawks, that team moved to Atlanta in 1968, 
thus preventing a potential new rivalry for the Kings. This made the Kings 
the first team in the state in four years. 13 years later, the Kings moved 
to California, leaving Missouri without a team. The rivalry with the Los 
Angeles Lakers began when the Kings traded for Chris Webber in 1998. Featuring 
matchups such as Vlade Divac vs. Shaquille O'Neal, it became one of the 
most competitive in the NBA, climaxing when the two teams met in the 2002 
Western Conference Finals.[48] From that point on, injuries and trades 
would dull the rivalry,[49] though it has begun to emerge again with the 
Kings drafting center DeMarcus Cousins, and the Lakers trading for center 
Dwight Howard.[50] Both teams, however, have had a lack of success, with 
the Kings failing to make the playoffs and the Lakers being swept in the 
first round as the number 7 seed in the 2013 playoffs and losing many of 
their star players to injuries (Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash) or free agency 
(Howard to the Houston Rockets) in the following season.[51] Roster • Transactions
