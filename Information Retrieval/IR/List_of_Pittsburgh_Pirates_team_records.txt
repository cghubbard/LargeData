The Pittsburgh Pirates are a professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania. They compete in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's 
(MLB) National League (NL). Founded in 1882 as Allegheny, the franchise 
has been variously known throughout its history as the Pittsburgh Alleghenys 
(1887–1889), the Pittsburg Innocents (1890) and the Pittsburg Pirates (1891–1911) 
until becoming the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1912. The list below documents 
players and teams that hold particular club records. In 134 seasons from 
1882 through 2015, the team has won over 10,000 games and five World Series 
championships. The team has appeared in 18 postseasons and has won nine 
league pennants. Roberto Clemente owns the most career batting records 
with five. Ralph Kiner, Arky Vaughan and Paul Waner each own three single-season 
batting records. Bob Friend owns the most career pitching records and Ed 
Morris the most single-season pitching records, both with six. In their 
history, the Pittsburgh Pirates have set three Major League Baseball records. 
In 1912, Chief Wilson hit an MLB-record 36 triples and, on May 30, 1925, 
the team collectively hit a major league-record eight triples in a single 
game. In addition, six no-hitters have been thrown in the history of the 
franchise, with the most recent on July 12, 1997. The Pirates also hold 
the MLB—and North American professional sports—record for most consecutive 
losing seasons with 20. The stretch began with the 1993 season and concluded 
with the 2012 season, at which point the Pirates recorded a winning record 
and a playoff berth in the 2013 season. Statistics are current through
