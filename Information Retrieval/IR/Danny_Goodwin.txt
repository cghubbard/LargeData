Danny Kay Goodwin (born September 2, 1953) is a retired Major League Baseball 
player who played from 1975 to 1982 for the California Angels, Minnesota 
Twins, and Oakland Athletics. Goodwin, who played a majority of his games 
as a designated hitter, is the only player to be the first overall pick 
in the Major League draft in two separate years.[1] Goodwin was initially 
drafted first overall in the 1971 MLB draft by the Chicago White Sox,[1] 
but chose to attend Southern University and A & M where Lou Brock had previously 
attended, as would future Brewer 2B Rickie Weeks. Four years later, he 
was again selected with the first overall pick by the California Angels. 
He appeared in 252 games for three teams over the next seven years. He 
then played in 61 games at first base and two in the outfield, all for 
the Minnesota Twins, with his other appearances as a designated hitter.[1] 
In between, he played for the Nankai Hawks in Japanese Professional League 
in 1986.[2] In 2011, Goodwin became the first player from a historically 
African American university to be inducted into the National College Baseball
