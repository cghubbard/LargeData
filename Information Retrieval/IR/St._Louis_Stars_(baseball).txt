The St. Louis Stars, originally the St. Louis Giants, were a Negro league 
baseball team that competed independently from as early as 1906 to 1919, 
and then joined the Negro National League (NNL) for the duration of their 
existence. After the 1921 season, the Giants were sold by African-American 
promoter Charlie Mills to Dick Kent and Dr. Sam Sheppard, who built a new 
park and renamed the club the Stars. As the Stars, they eventually built 
one of the great dynasties in Negro league history, winning three pennants 
in four years from 1928 to 1931. After the demise of the original Stars, 
there were two attempts to resurrect the St. Louis Stars name. A one-season 
bust in 1937, and a reasonably successful team that lasted from 1938 to 
1943 which was also based variously in Indianapolis, New Orleans and Harrisburg, 
Pennsylvania. In 1906, Charles A. Mills,[1] an African-American bank messenger 
and baseball fan who wanted to upgrade the team, approached Conrad Kuebler, 
a white man who owned a ballpark, and convinced him to invest in the team. 
He then persuaded the Leland Giants to visit St. Louis to play his team. 
Mills discovered that the Leland Giants' star third baseman, Dick Wallace 
wanted a change of scenery and persuaded him to join the St. Louis Giants 
as the team's playing manager. Wallace stayed with the team for most of 
its existence and assembled a core of veterans, including Ben Taylor, shortstop 
Joe Hewitt, first baseman Tullie McAdoo, catcher/outfielder Sam Bennett, 
pitchers Bill Drake and Bill Gatewood, and outfielders Jimmie Lyons and 
Charles Blackwell. Though they were a good club, winning the St. Louis 
City League championship in 1912 and 1913, they couldn't break the grip 
of the Chicago American Giants and, later, the Indianapolis ABCs on the 
unofficial western championship of black baseball. In 1920, the Giants 
finished sixth in the eight-team NNL with a 25-32 record. For the next 
season, St. Louis acquired center fielder Oscar Charleston from Indianapolis. 
Led by an historic season by Charleston (the latest research shows him 
batting .436, with 12 home runs and a league-leading 32 stolen bases in 
62 games), who was nearly matched by Blackwell (.430), and with Bill Drake 
contributing 16 wins, the Giants surged to second place with a 40-28 record. 
In October, they played a best-of-seven series with the second-place St. 
Louis Cardinals in Sportsman's Park, and lost four games to one even though 
Cardinals' star Rogers Hornsby did not participate. That would be both 
the club's high point and its swan song, as Mills gave up the NNL's St. 
Louis franchise that winter. In 1922 most of the Giants' roster would play 
for the new St. Louis Stars. Mills organized new, independent teams using 
the St. Louis Giants moniker, frequently signing old Giants' players. That 
team toured the east coast in both 1924 and 1928. An African-American industrial 
league team used the name in the late 1930s (it was also known as the St. 
Louis Titanium Giants), counting eventual major leaguer Luke Easter among 
its players. The Stars inherited almost the entire roster of the 1921 Giants 
(who had finished in second place), with the exception of Hall of Fame 
center fielder Oscar Charleston. Without Charleston, the Stars dropped 
to fourth place in 1922, though with a creditable 35-26 record. In 1923 
they slipped badly, finishing with 28 wins and 44 losses, good for only 
sixth place. Midway through the year they acquired several players from 
the Toledo Tigers when that team folded, including new manager Candy Jim 
Taylor. A 37-year-old third baseman, Taylor tied for the 1923 league lead 
with 20 home runs (19 hit in St. Louis). More importantly, over the next 
few years Taylor put together one of the most impressive assemblages of 
talent in Negro league history, including Cool Papa Bell, whom Taylor converted 
from a left-handed pitcher into a brilliant defensive center fielder and 
leadoff man; Mule Suttles, first baseman and all-time Negro league home 
run king; Willie Wells, considered by many historians to be John Henry 
Lloyd's only serious rival as greatest shortstop in Negro league history; 
and Ted Trent, pitcher and wielder of one of the most effective curve balls 
in the league. In 1924, the Stars improved to 42-34 and fourth place. The 
next year they won the second-half title with an impressive 38-12 record 
after only narrowly losing the first half (69-27 overall), but lost the 
playoff series to Bullet Rogan and the Kansas City Monarchs. When Taylor 
left to manage the Detroit Stars and Cleveland Elites in 1926, the Stars 
slumped to 49-30, good for third place overall, though Mule Suttles enjoyed 
an historic season at bat. According to John Holway's Complete Book of 
the Negro Leagues, he hit .498, and led the NNL in doubles (27), triples 
(21), and home runs (27, the all-time Negro league single season record). 
He returned in 1927, and in 1928 the Stars took over the league, winning 
the first half going away, and compiling the best overall record by a good 
margin (66-26). They defeated the Chicago American Giants, second-half 
winners (and Negro league world champions for two years running) in an 
exciting playoff series, 5 games to 4. The Stars continued their winning 
ways in 1929, but were just edged out in both halves of the season by the 
Kansas City Monarchs, despite Willie Wells's 27 home runs (tying Suttles's 
1926 record). The following year they took their second NNL pennant, defeating 
the Detroit Stars in the playoff. In 1931, the Stars were awarded the pennant 
when the league disintegrated partway through the season; unfortunately, 
the club folded along with the league. The Giants originally played at 
Giants Park the first month and a half of the 1922 season, and occasionally 
played some games in the 1920s at three nearby parks: Vandeventer Lot II, 
Easton Street Park and Market Street Park.[2] The Stars played in Stars 
Park, located at the southeast corner of Compton and Laclede avenues (38°37′56″N 
90°13′34″W﻿ / ﻿38.632193°N 90.226014°W﻿ / 38.632193; -90.226014), was the 
primary home baseball park of the Stars from 1922 to 1931. It was completed 
in mid-season 1922 as one of the few ballparks built expressly for the 
Negro leagues. It had a capacity of 10,000 people.[2] The park became famous 
for its 269-foot left field wall, built to accommodate a trolley car barn. 
Despite special rules that in some seasons counted home runs hit over the 
car barn as ground-rule doubles, the park proved very friendly to power 
hitters over the years. Below are the three men who played for the St. 
Louis Stars and were later inducted into the National Baseball Hall of 
Fame. After the player's name is their primary position, years played with 
the Stars and year inducted into the Hall of Fame. An asterisk denotes 
the Stars were also their primary team. In 1937, another club named the 
St. Louis Stars joined the Negro American League as a charter member, but 
this was an entirely different organization. They disbanded for the 1938 
season due to financial difficulties. The third incarnate of the Indianapolis 
ABCs relocated to St. Louis for the 1939 season in the NAL. This club suffered 
continual financial woes and resorted to splitting their home games between 
St. Louis and New Orleans in 1940 and 1941 (as the New Orleans–St. Louis 
Stars). In 1942, Allen Johnson, owner of the New Orleans-St. Louis Stars, 
quit the Negro American League to become part owner of the New York Black 
Yankees in the Negro National League. He brought George Mitchell along 
as business manager.[3] A dispute ensued about whether he was allowed to 
transfer the Stars players to the Black Yankees; the leagues decided that 
he could transfer ten players, with the remaining nine players to be distributed 
among Negro American League teams.[4] In 1943, Johnson and Mitchell established 
a new Negro National League franchise in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, although 
they played under the Harrisburg–St. Louis Stars moniker because the majority 
of the players had previously played for the St. Louis Stars.[5] By mid-season, 
they were in conflict with league officials over signing players that were 
reserved by other teams, and they received permission to drop out of the 
league in July to barnstorm as the "Bond Bombers" to raise funds for war 
bonds.[6] They disbanded for good after the 1943 season. The reincarnate 
clubs played their St. Louis home games at Metropolitan Park (1937) and 
South End Park (1939, 1941);[2] their New Orleans home games at Pelican 
Stadium (1941);[7] and their Harrisburg home games at Island Stadium (1943).[8] 
The St. Louis Cardinals have honored the Stars by wearing replica uniforms 
during regular-season baseball games on several occasions, including July 
4, 1997 (at home vs. Pittsburgh), August 1 and 2, 1998 (at Atlanta), June 
29, 2003 (at Kansas City), August 12, 2006 (at Pittsburgh), and August 
14, 2007 (at Washington), and July 23, 2011 (at Pittsburgh). Coordinates:
