2013, CBS Sports rolled out its previous graphics and animation package 
that was first used in the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLVII. Additionally, 
in compliance with the Active Format Description #10 code, CBS Sports switched 
to a 16:9 aspect ratio letterbox presentation used for all sports programming, 
including the SEC on CBS and the NFL on CBS broadcasts. On November 30, 
2015, CBS Sports released a new logo in order to coincide with the network's 
coverage of Super Bowl 50. The network also created a new on-air graphics 
package that debuted as part of the network's Super Bowl week programming. 
Following the game, the graphics package began to be utilized across all 
of their programming events, including their joint production of NCAA March 
Madness with Turner Sports.[1][2] The Masters, which retains heavy production 
control over their event, will continue to use the network's older graphical 
style originally unveiled in 2007. Also, the network's Thursday Night Football 
game broadcasts will continue to use the graphical style originally used 
since its debut in 2014. CBS Sports Network is a sports-oriented American 
digital cable and satellite channel that is operated by CBS Corporation 
through CBS Sports. Launched as the National College Sports Network in 
2002, then renamed as College Sports Television in 2003, CBS's then-parent 
company Viacom acquired the network in 2005 and later renamed it CBS College 
Sports Network in 2008. The network had always focused on college sports, 
but in 2011, CBS rebranded the network as CBS Sports Network as a move 
to reposition the network to include mainstream sportsâ€”including coverage 
of minor professional sports leagues such as the Arena Football League 
and Major League Lacrosse, although college sports are still aired frequently 
by the network. CBS Sports Radio is a sports radio network that launched 
on September 4, 2012 with hourly sports news updates. It began offering
