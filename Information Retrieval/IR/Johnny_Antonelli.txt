John August Antonelli (born April 12, 1930) is an American former left-handed 
starting pitcher who played for the Boston and Milwaukee Braves, New York 
and San Francisco Giants, and Cleveland Indians. Antonelli received the 
biggest bonus in history to that point when he signed with the Braves for 
$52,000 in 1948.[1] He then served in Korea and became a regular in 1953. 
He was later dealt to the Giants along with several other players for Bobby 
Thomson. In the 1954 season, Antonelli went 21â€“7, led the league in ERA 
(2.30), was selected an All-Star, and led the Giants to a pennant, facing 
the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. Antonelli started and won Game 
2, then came into Game 4 as a reliever to shut down an Indian rally, as 
the Giants pulled off a sweep. Antonelli pitched well for several more 
years, making four straight All-Star teams from 1956 to 1959. After his 
four All-Star appearances, he spent one more year with the Giants (1960) 
before being traded to the Cleveland Indians with Willie Kirkland for Harvey 
Kuenn. He split the 1961 season between the Indians and the Braves before 
his retirement in 1962 after having been recently acquired by the New York 
Mets. Antonelli said he was "tired of traveling" and wanted to be home 
with his family.[1] After his baseball career, Antonelli returned to Rochester 
and for many years ran a chain of Firestone Tire stores bearing his name.
