The Minnesota Twins are an American professional baseball team based in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and play in the Central Division of Major League 
Baseball's American League. The team is named after the Twin Cities area 
of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. One of the American League's eight 
charter franchises, the club was founded in Kansas City, Kansas in 1894 
as the Kansas City Blues before moving to Washington, D.C. and renamed 
Senators. In 1905 the team changed its official name to the Washington 
Nationals.[1] The name "Nationals" would appear on the uniforms for only 
2 seasons, and would then be replaced with the "W" logo for the next 52 
years. The media often shortened the nickname to "Nats". Many fans and 
newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the "Senators" 
nickname. Over time, "Nationals" faded as a nickname, and "Senators" became 
dominant. Baseball guides would list the club's nickname as "Nationals 
or Senators", acknowledging the dual-nickname situation. In its 108-year 
history, the franchise has employed 29 managers[2] and won 3 World Series 
championships. Seven managers have taken the franchise to the postseason. 
Ron Gardenhire, manager of the Twins from 2002–2014, led them to six playoff 
appearances, the most in their franchise history.[3] Two managers have 
won the World Series with the franchise: Bucky Harris, in 1924 against 
the New York Giants;[4] and Tom Kelly, in 1987 against the St. Louis Cardinals[5] 
and 1991 against the Atlanta Braves.[6] The Kansas City Blues were a team 
that played in the Western League from 1894 to 1899. That league was reorganized 
and renamed The American League by Ban Johnson in 1900 and played as a 
minor league that year. Its intention, however, was to compete with the 
National League as a "Major" league, which it then began doing so in 1901. 
The Blues, along with four of the seven other teams, made that move and 
were part of the reorganization. However, when the American League began 
its Major League status in 1901, the Blues team had relocated to Washington 
and officially became the Washington Senators. The name "Twins" derives 
from the popular name of the region, the Twin Cities. Knowing about the 
bitter century-long rivalry between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Griffith 
was determined not to alienate fans in either city by naming the team after 
one city or the other. Instead, he proposed to name his team the Twin Cities 
Twins[citation needed]. However, after a meeting with state officials, 
a decision then unprecedented in American professional baseball was made.[7] 
The team would be named after its home state and became known as the Minnesota 
Twins on November 26, 1960. The NFL expansion Minnesota Vikings had announced 
their name on September 27, 1960. This was one month before the Senators 
moved to Minnesota. Later, the California Angels (now the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim), Texas Rangers (coincidentally, the relocated expansion Senators), 
Florida Marlins (now the Miami Marlins), Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks 
would follow their lead. However, the original "Twin Cities Twins" TC logo 
was kept until 1987, when the Twins adopted their current uniforms. By 
this time, the Twins felt they were established enough that they could 
place an "M" on their caps without making St. Paul think it stood for Minneapolis. 
The "TC" logo returned to one version of the home uniforms in 2002, as 
did the team's original cartoon logo: two players representing the area's 
two minor league teams displaced by the Twins—the Minneapolis Millers and 
St. Paul Saints—shaking hands over the Mississippi River, which runs between 
the two cities. The Twins have returned to the classic "TC" logo on all 
uniforms for the 2014 season. The Twins were eagerly greeted in Minnesota 
when they arrived in 1961. They brought a nucleus of talented players: 
Harmon Killebrew, Bob Allison, Camilo Pascual, Zoilo Versalles, Jim Kaat, 
Earl Battey, and Lenny Green. Tony Oliva, who would go on to win American 
League batting championships in 1964, 1965 and 1971, made his major league 
debut in 1962. That year, the Twins won 91 games, the most by the franchise 
since 1933. The Twins of manager Sam Mele won 102 games and the American 
League Pennant in 1965, driven by the exciting play of superstar slugger 
Killebrew and batting champion Oliva, the 21 pitching victories by Mudcat 
Grant, and the flashy play of league MVP Zoilo Versalles. However, they 
were defeated in the 1965 World Series by the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven 
games; each home team had won until Game 7, when Sandy Koufax shut out 
the Twins 2–0 in Minnesota. The Twins scored a total of two runs in their 
four losses, and were shut out three times, twice by Koufax. Although disappointed 
with the near-miss, the championship drive cemented the team's relationship 
with the people of Minnesota. The Twins would wait 22 years to return to 
the World Series; they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games 
in the 1987 Series. In 1967, the Twins were involved in one of the closest 
pennant races in baseball history. Heading into the final weekend of the 
season, the Twins, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, and Detroit Tigers 
all had a shot at clinching the American League championship. With two 
games left to play, the Twins were one game on top of the Red Sox in the 
standings; moreover, the two remaining games each team had to play happened 
to be against each other. Unfortunately for Minnesota baseball fans, the 
Red Sox won both games and clinched their first pennant since 1946, finishing 
with a 92–70 record. The Twins and Tigers both finished a game behind, 
at 91–71, while the White Sox were three games out, at 89–73. Rod Carew 
was named the American League Rookie of the Year. In 1969, Billy Martin 
was named manager. Martin pushed aggressive base running, with Carew stealing 
home seven times.[8] The Twins won the American League West, led by Carew 
(.332, his first batting title), Oliva (.309, 24 HR, 101 RBI) and league 
MVP Killebrew (49 HR, 140 RBI).[9] Unfortunately, the Twins were swept 
by the Baltimore Orioles, who had set a franchise record of 109–53, in 
the first American League Championship Series. The Orioles would lose to 
the "Miracle Mets" in the 1969 World Series. Martin was fired after the 
season following an August 1969 fight in Detroit with 20-game winner Dave 
Boswell and outfielder Bob Allison, in an alley outside the Lindell A.C. 
bar. However Bill Rigney led the Twins to a repeat division title in 1970, 
behind the star pitching of Jim Perry (24-12), the A.L. Cy Young Award 
winner, while the Orioles again won the Eastern Division Championship behind 
the star pitching of Jim Palmer. Once again, the Orioles won the A.L. Championship 
Series in a three-game sweep,[10] and this time they would win the World 
Series. The team continued to post winning records through 1971, winning 
the first two American League West division titles. However, they then 
entered a decade-long slump, finishing around .500 for the next eight years. 
Tony Oliva and Rod Carew continued to provide offensive power, but Killebrew's 
home run production decreased, as injuries impacted his effectiveness, 
and the pitching staff languished. Killebrew's final season with the Twins 
was the 1974 season. Owner Calvin Griffith faced financial difficulty with 
the start of free agency. While other owners had fortunes made in other 
businesses, Griffith's only income came from baseball. He ran the Twins 
as a family-owned business, employing many family members, and had to turn 
a profit each season. Stars Lyman Bostock and Larry Hisle left as free 
agents after the 1977 season and prompted the trade of Rod Carew after 
the 1978 season. In the early 1980s, The Twins fell further, winning only 
37% of its games from 1981 to 1982. They had their worst season in Minnesota 
in 1982, with a 60–102 record, the worst the franchise had since the 1904 
season (that team went 38–113). It was the first (and last until 2016) 
100-loss season in Minnesota. From their arrival in 1961 through 1981, 
the team played its games at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, a suburb 
south of the Twin Cities. The Mall of America now occupies the spot where 
the "Old Met" stood, complete with home plate and the seat where Harmon 
Killebrew hit a 520-foot home run; both of those landmarks are located 
inside of Nickelodeon Universe. The 1982 season brought the team indoors, 
into Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which was located in downtown Minneapolis 
near the Mississippi River. In 1984, Calvin Griffith sold the Twins to 
Minneapolis banker Carl Pohlad. In 1985, Minnesota hosted the All-Star 
Game at Metrodome, with the National League winning the game 6-1 over the 
American League. Future World Series MVP Jack Morris was the losing pitcher 
for the American League. After several losing seasons in the Dome, a nucleus 
of players acquired during the waning years of the Griffith regime (Kent 
Hrbek, Tom Brunansky, Gary Gaetti, Frank Viola) combined with a few good 
trades (Bert Blyleven), intelligent free agent acquisitions (Al Newman, 
Roy Smalley), and a rising star in Kirby Puckett, combined to return the 
team to the World Series for the first time since 1965, defeating the Detroit 
Tigers (who won the World Series three years earlier) in the ALCS along 
the way. The dynamic play of the new superstars electrified the team and 
propelled the Twins to a seven-game victory over the St. Louis Cardinals 
to win the 1987 World Series. All games in the 1987 series were won by 
the home team. The 1987 Twins set a record for fewest regular season victories 
by a World Series champion with 85 and a .525 winning percentage. This 
record was broken by the 2006 Cardinals, who won the World Series after 
going 83–78 during the regular season and a .513 percentage. While their 
56–25 record at Metrodome was the best overall home record for 1987, the 
Twins had an appalling 29–52 mark away from Metrodome and they only won 
nine road games after the All-Star break. The Twins won more games in 1988, 
but could not overcome the powerhouse division rival Oakland Athletics 
(who in turn lost the 1988 World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers), even 
though pitcher Frank Viola won the Cy Young Award in that year. 1989 saw 
a decline in the win column although Puckett would win the batting title 
that season. The Twins surprisingly did quite poorly in 1990, finishing 
last in the AL West division with a record of 74–88, 29 games behind the 
Athletics, the eventual World Series runner-up. 1991 brought breakout years 
from newcomers Shane Mack, Scott Leius, Chili Davis, and rookie of the 
year Chuck Knoblauch, along with consistently excellent performances from 
stars Hrbek and Puckett. The pitching staff excelled as well, with 20-game 
winner Scott Erickson, closer Rick Aguilera, and newly acquired free agent, 
St. Paul native Jack Morris, having all-star years. The Twins defeated 
the Toronto Blue Jays in five games to win the 1991 ALCS and the Atlanta 
Braves 4 games to 3 to win the nail-biting 1991 World Series, which is 
considered by many to be the greatest of all time.[11] Game 6 is widely 
considered to be one of the greatest World Series games ever played. Facing 
elimination, and with the score tied 3-3 in the bottom of the 11th inning, 
Kirby Puckett stepped up to the plate and drove the game-winning home run 
into the left field seats to force a decisive Game 7. The home run was 
Puckett's only walk-off home run of his career. In the final and deciding 
game, Jack Morris pitched a 10-inning shutout, viewed by many baseball 
historians as one of the greatest pitching performances in a 7th game of 
the World Series, to beat the Braves 1–0 and bring home the championship 
to Minnesota. 1991 was considered to be the first season that any team 
that ended in last place the previous year advanced to the World Series; 
both the Twins and Braves accomplished the unprecedented feat. ESPN rated 
the 1991 World Series as the best ever played in a 2003 centennial retrospective 
of the World Series. As with the 1987 World Series, which the Twins also 
won, all 7 games were won by the home team. The Twins were the first World 
Series champion to lose three away games and still win the series by winning 
all four home games; doing it in 1987 and again in 1991. The Arizona Diamondbacks 
duplicated this feat in 2001, when they became the first National League 
team to do so. 1992 saw another superb Athletic team that the Twins could 
not overcome, despite a 90–72 season and solid pitching from John Smiley. 
After that season, the Twins again fell into an extended slump, posting 
a losing record each year for the next eight years: 71–91 in 1993, 50–63 
in 1994, 56–88 in 1995, 78–84 in 1996, 68–94 in 1997, 70–92 in 1998, 63–97 
in 1999 and 69–93 in 2000. From 1994 to 1997 a long sequence of retirements 
and injuries hurt the team badly, and Tom Kelly spent the remainder of 
his managerial career attempting to rebuild the Twins. Puckett after the 
1995 season was forced to retire at age 35 due to loss of vision in one 
eye from a central retinal vein occlusion.[12] He retired as the Twins' 
all-time leader in career hits, runs, doubles, and total bases. At the 
time of his retirement, his .318 career batting average was the highest 
by any right-handed American League batter since Joe DiMaggio. Puckett 
was the fourth baseball player during the 20th century to record 1,000 
hits in his first five full calendar years in Major League Baseball, and 
was the second to record 2,000 hits during his first ten full calendar 
years. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year 
of eligibility. In 1997, owner Carl Pohlad almost sold the Twins to North 
Carolina businessman Don Beaver, who would have moved the team to the Piedmont 
Triad (Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point) area of the state. The defeat 
of a referendum for a stadium in that area and a lack of interest in building 
a stadium for the Twins in Charlotte killed the deal. In 1998, management 
cleared out the team of all of its players earning over 1 million dollars 
(except for pitcher Brad Radke) and rebuilt from the ground up; the team 
barely avoided finishing in last place that year, finishing just five games 
ahead of the Tigers and avoiding the mark of 100 losses by eight games. 
Things turned around, and from 2001 to 2006, the Twins compiled the longest 
streak of consecutive winning seasons since moving to Minnesota, going 
85–77 in 2001, 94–67 in 2002, 90–72 in 2003, 92–70 in 2004, 83-79 in 2005, 
and 96–66 in 2006. From 2002 to 2004, the Twins compiled their longest 
streak of consecutive league/division championships ever (previous were 
the 1924 World Champion-1925 AL Champion Senators and the 1969–70 Twins). 
Threatened with closure by league contraction (along with the Montreal 
Expos) in 2002, the team battled back to reach the ALCS before being eliminated 
4-1 by that year's eventual World Series champion Anaheim Angels. Their 
streak of three straight division titles, along with some bitterly fought 
games, have helped to create an intense rivalry with the Chicago White 
Sox in recent years, starting with 2000 when the Sox clinched the division 
at Metrodome, and heating up especially in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008. In 
2006, the Twins came from 12 games back in the division at the All-Star 
break to tie the Detroit Tigers for the lead in the 159th game of the season. 
With the Tigers having won the season head-to-head by 11 games to 8, the 
Twins needed a Tiger loss and a Twins win in order to take sole possession 
of first place and win the division outright, and got both on the last 
day of the season, when the Tigers lost their third straight game at home 
to the last place Kansas City Royals in a 10–8 game in 12 innings. After 
their win against the Chicago White Sox, the Minnesota Twins and somewhere 
between 30,000 and 40,000 fans watched the Tigers-Royals game on Metrodome's 
jumbotrons. This was the first time in major league history that a team 
has won a division or league outright on the last day of the regular season 
without ever having had sole possession of first place earlier. The magical 
season came to a sudden end, however, as the Twins were swept 3–0 by Oakland 
in the divisional championship series, while Detroit went on as a wild 
card entry, beat the Yankees 3–1 in their divisional series, and went on 
to play the A's. The Tigers would sweep the A's 4–0 in the ALCS and lose 
the 2006 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals, who coincidentally broke 
the record held by the Twins for the worst regular season record by a World 
Series champion (having gone 83–79). The Twins are the first team in Major 
League history to sweep the Player of the Month, Pitcher of the Month, 
and Rookie of the Month awards, accomplishing this feat in June 2006 with 
catcher Joe Mauer, pitcher Johan Santana, and rookie pitcher Francisco 
Liriano respectively. Also in 2006, the club became one of the most decorated 
in recent baseball history, with Justin Morneau's MVP following the AL 
Cy Young Award won by Johan Santana and the AL batting title by Joe Mauer. 
The last team to accomplish this was the 1962 Los Angeles Dodgers. In addition, 
center fielder Torii Hunter was awarded the Rawlings Gold Glove Award for 
his defense in the 2006 season, and Mauer and Morneau each received a Silver 
Slugger Award for the offense as catcher and first baseman respectively. 
A new nickname was unintentionally introduced by White Sox manager Ozzie 
Guillén, who called the Twins "Little Piranhas" as they gobbled up wins 
in July through August in the 2006 season. In 2007, the Twins sometimes 
played an animated sequence of piranhas munching under that caption, in 
situations where the Twins were scoring runs via "small ball". In 2008, 
the Twins finished the 162-game season tied with the White Sox, who won 
a rained out game against the Detroit Tigers to face the Twins in Chicago 
in a 1-game playoff to reach the ALDS. Nick Blackburn pitched for the Twins, 
giving up 1 run in 6 and 1/3 innings of baseball, allowing a solo home 
run to Jim Thome. The Twins lost the game and missed the playoffs while 
the White Sox went on to lose to the eventual American League champion 
Tampa Bay Rays in four games. This was the last Major League Baseball tiebreaker 
playoff game whose site was determined by a coin flip. Beginning with the 
2009 season, sites for tiebreaker games were determined by the regular 
season head-to-head record between the teams involved. Had this rule been 
in place for the 2008 season, the Twins-White Sox tiebreaker would have 
been played at the Metrodome. In the 2009 season (the final season at the 
Metrodome) the Twins would go on to tie the Tigers for the division at 
season's end and then played a one-game playoff in Minnesota because Minnesota 
had a better head to head record with Detroit, a choice made in response 
to the previous year. The Twins beat the Tigers 6-5 in 12 innings on a 
walk-off single by Alexi Casilla, but the season ended with the Twins getting 
swept 3-0 in the first round of the playoffs by the eventual World Series 
champion Yankees. It marked the third time in the 2000s that the Yankees 
had swept the Twins in the Division Series (as they had done so in 2003 
and 2004). Over the past 10 years, the Twins have argued that the lack 
of a modern baseball-dedicated ballpark has stood in the way of producing 
a top-notch, competitive team. However, it is generally believed that Metrodome 
played a key role in the two World Series they have won while in Minnesota. 
Metrodome's painfully high decibel levels (as high as 125 decibels—the 
same as a jet airliner taking off), as well as its many quirks (such as 
the artificial turf and the white roof) gave the Twins a huge home field 
advantage. The Twins won every one of their home games in their two World 
Series victories. Although it was built in 1982, by the start of the 1990s 
it was already considered obsolete because it had few revenue-generating 
luxury suites. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Twins were often rumored 
to be moving to such places as New Jersey, Las Vegas, Portland, Oregon, 
the Raleigh–Durham area, and others in search of a more financially competitive 
market. The team was nearly contracted (disbanded) in 2002, a move which 
would have eliminated the Twins and the Montreal Expos, now the Washington 
Nationals, franchise. The Twins survived largely due to a court decision 
which forced them to play out their lease on Metrodome. In October 2005 
the Twins went back to state court asking for a ruling that they have no 
long-term lease with the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, the 
owner of Metrodome where the Twins currently play. In February 2006 the 
court ruled favorably on the Twins motion. Thus, the Twins were not obligated 
to play in Metrodome after the 2006 season. This removed one of the roadblocks 
that prevented contraction prior to the 2002 season and cleared the way 
for the Twins to either be relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season 
if a new deal was not reached. For a long time, the Twins wished to move 
from Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome to a site behind Target Center within 
the next half decade, claiming that Metrodome generated too little revenue 
for the Twins to be competitive. In particular, the Twins received very 
little revenue from luxury suite leasing (as the majority are owned by 
the co-tenant Minnesota Vikings) and only a small percentage of concessions 
sales; also, the percentage of season-ticket-quality seats in Metrodome 
was said to be very low compared to other stadiums, and the capacity of 
the stadium is far too high for baseball. However, attempts to spur interest 
and push legislative efforts towards a new stadium repeatedly failed prior 
to 2006. The Dome was thought to be an increasingly poor fit for all three 
of its major tenants (the Twins, the Vikings and the University of Minnesota 
Golden Gophers football team). On May 21, 2006, the Twins' new stadium 
received the approval of the Minnesota House of Representatives, with a 
vote of 71–61, and then received approval from the Senate, with a vote 
of 34–32, after 4:00 AM on the second-to-last day of the 2006 legislative 
session. The bill moved on to Governor Tim Pawlenty, who signed it during 
a special pre-game ceremony at Metrodome on May 26, 2006 (the Twins played 
the Seattle Mariners that night) on what will be the first home plate installed 
in the new stadium. On January 5, 2009, owner Carl Pohlad died at the age 
of 93. Pohlad's three sons inherited the team, with Jim Pohlad assuming 
control of day-to-day operations and acting as principal owner. The Pohlad 
family invested significant sums of their own money into construction of 
Target Field, and is expected to retain ownership of the team.[13] After 
the inaugural season at Target Field, batters complained about the trees 
in center field. Claiming that they were distracting, the Twins had them 
removed and relocated. Target Field was built in what was a parking lot 
at the north end of downtown Minneapolis within walking distance of the 
Target Center. On September 15, 2008 the Twins announced that they had 
sold naming rights to the Target Corporation and that the stadium would 
be known as Target Field. The Metro Light Rail was extended to the ballpark 
area with a connection to the Northstar Commuter Rail, which terminates 
at the ballpark. Preliminary plans called for a seating capacity of 40,000 
seats and 72 suites. There are approximately 34 rest rooms compared to 
only 16 in Metrodome. The concourses are open to the playing field with 
a view of the downtown Minneapolis skyline from every seat in the park. 
There is no retractable roof on the stadium which would have added about 
$200 million on to the cost which was $522 million.[citation needed] This 
received some objection due to the potentially harsh game conditions in 
early April (similar to other northern pro baseball teams such as the White 
Sox, Cubs, Tigers, Indians, Red Sox, etc.) and the potential risk of resulting 
lost revenue. The official groundbreaking for the stadium, originally scheduled 
for 2 August 2007, was postponed to August 30 due to the collapse of the 
I-35W Mississippi River bridge. With the new ballpark bill, a provision 
was signed into law that allows the state of Minnesota the right of first 
refusal to buy the team if it is ever sold, and requires that the name, 
colors, World Series' trophies and history of the team remain in Minnesota 
if the Twins are ever moved out of state (a reaction to the loss of the 
Minnesota North Stars to Dallas in 1993). This is similar to what the city 
of Cleveland did with the NFL's Cleveland Browns in 1995 when Art Modell 
moved them to Baltimore and renamed them the Ravens, as well as Seattle 
with the 2008 relocation of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics to Oklahoma City 
where the club was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder (though in the latter 
case, the Thunder retained the Sonics' history and will "share" it with 
any future Seattle NBA franchise). Target Field opened on January 4, 2010
