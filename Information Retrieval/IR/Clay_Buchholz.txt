Clay Daniel Buchholz (born August 14, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher with the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
On September 1, 2007, in just his second major league start, he recorded 
a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles, becoming the third MLB pitcher 
since 1900 to throw a no-hitter in his first or second start.[1] He is 
the first Red Sox rookie and 17th Red Sox pitcher to pitch a no-hitter.[1] 
He stands 6'3" and weighs 190 lbs. Raised in Lumberton, Texas, Buchholz 
played baseball for the local youth baseball leagues, and then for the 
Lumberton High School Raiders coached by Mark Brevell.[2] Buchholz began 
his college career in 2004 at McNeese State University.[3][4] He was subsequently 
dismissed from the McNeese baseball team after stealing 29 laptop computers 
from a middle school and selling them on the McNeese State University campus. 
Buchholz then transferred to Angelina College. In 2005, while competing 
for the Roadrunners, Buchholz appeared in 15 games, winning 12 and losing 
1.[5] His 1.05 ERA, seven complete games, and 129 strikeouts all stand 
as team records (through the 2010 season). He was also named an All-American 
in 2005.[6] Buchholz was drafted by the Red Sox in the supplemental first 
round of the 2005 draft. The Red Sox obtained their supplemental pick, 
the 42nd overall, as compensation for losing free agent Pedro Martínez 
to the New York Mets.[5] Buchholz pitched 41 1⁄3 innings for the Lowell 
Spinners of the New York–Penn League, compiling a record of 0–1 with 45 
strikeouts in 15 starts. He then pitched for the Wilmington Blue Rocks 
(Class-A Advanced) and the Greenville Drive (Class-A). Between the two 
teams, Buchholz struck out 140 and walked 33 in 119 innings while going 
11–4. Buchholz started his first spring training game in 2007 against the 
Tampa Bay Rays. He pitched 4 2⁄3 innings, gave up seven hits and three 
runs, and recorded three strikeouts. While competing for the Portland Sea 
Dogs in 2007, Buchholz played in fifteen games, winning seven and losing 
two. His success led to his selection for the All-Star Futures Game at 
AT&T Park. Buchholz was promoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox, the Triple-A 
affiliate of the Red Sox, on July 8, 2007. He finished the Triple-A season 
with a 1–3 record while recording 55 strikeouts, 13 walks, and a 3.96 era 
over eight starts in 38 2⁄3 Triple-A innings. Buchholz made his Major League 
debut with the Boston Red Sox against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
on August 17, 2007 at Fenway Park. The Sox won the game 8–4 and he picked 
up the win, going six innings and giving up four runs (three earned). After 
the game, however, Buchholz was optioned to the Sox' Triple-A team in Pawtucket. 
"I got my feet wet", he said to a reporter. "I hope I can come back in 
September and help out."[7] Before Buchholz' first major league start, 
Red Sox manager Terry Francona said: "This kid can come up and pitch a 
no-hitter, and he's going to go back down... If he throws a no-hitter I 
may send him back with a present. But he's going back."[8] In only his 
second career major league start on September 1, 2007, he became the first 
Boston Red Sox rookie to throw a no-hitter when he blanked the Baltimore 
Orioles 10–0. He threw 115 pitches, struck out nine, walked three, and 
hit Nick Markakis.[9] After the game, Buchholz told the media, "It's amazing. 
That's all I can say ... I'm in a blur right now." According to the Elias 
Sports Bureau, Buchholz became the third pitcher since 1900 to pitch a 
no-hitter in his first or second major league start. Bobo Holloman did 
it in his first start on May 6, 1953, for the St. Louis Browns at home 
against the Philadelphia Athletics, and Wilson Álvarez did it in his second 
start on August 11, 1991, for the Chicago White Sox at Baltimore.[9] Buchholz 
became the eleventh Red Sox pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Fenway Park 
history, and the seventeenth[10] in Red Sox history. Following the game, 
general manager Theo Epstein and manager Terry Francona each independently 
confirmed that they had spoken by phone to each other in the seventh and 
eighth innings concerning Buchholz' pitch count. He had not thrown more 
than 98 pitches in a game all year, and was threatening to significantly 
exceed that total if he finished the game. Epstein reported that in no 
way would Buchholz have been allowed to face a batter after reaching 120 
pitches, expressing concern about excessive pitches potentially damaging 
such a young and inexperienced arm. Buchholz finished the game with 115 
pitches, allowing Francona to escape what would have been an unpleasant 
decision to remove a pitcher from the game in which he was throwing a no-hitter.[11] 
Buchholz' no-hitter was the third of a record-setting four caught by Jason 
Varitek. The first two were for Hideo Nomo and Derek Lowe (in which the 
final score was also 10–0); the fourth was Jon Lester's on May 19, 2008, 
against the Kansas City Royals, which was also the first no-hitter in major 
league play after Buchholz'. Buchholz pitched in two more games after the 
no-hitter, earning a win while pitching three innings of relief at Baltimore 
on September 6,[12] and taking a loss after a start of 4 2⁄3 innings at 
Toronto on September 19.[13] When Buchholz experienced shoulder fatigue, 
Red Sox management made a decision to shut him down for 2007. Buchholz 
was left off the postseason roster but was eligible to receive his first 
championship ring as the Red Sox eventually won the 2007 World Series in 
a four-game sweep over the Colorado Rockies.[14] Red Sox pitching coach 
John Farrell stated that Buchholz would most likely be in line for 180–190 
innings in the 2008 season.[15] On May 15, Buchholz was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list as the result of a torn fingernail.[16] He was optioned to 
Triple-A Pawtucket following the injury, and remained there for several 
weeks to work on his fastball. On July 11, he was recalled to Boston and 
was part of their regular pitching rotation, though he did not record a 
single win after his return. On August 20, as the Red Sox were trying to 
sweep the Orioles, the team that Buchholz had no-hit the preceding year, 
he gave up a 4–0 lead by allowing three runs in the second inning and two 
more in the third. He was removed after only pitching 2 1⁄3 innings. In 
his previous start, he had only lasted three innings. In 2008, the Red 
Sox were 3–12 in Buchholz' fifteen starts. After the game, Buchholz was 
demoted to Double-A Portland. Buchholz stated "I've never had a streak 
like this", and "I've never been one to say the pressure was too much for 
me, but I've felt like I've had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying 
to be perfect and trying to do everything as well as I could to help this 
team win".[17] Following the 2008 season, Buchholz pitched in the Arizona 
Fall League. Following spring training, Buchholz was optioned to Triple-A 
Pawtucket.[18] In his eighth start at Pawtucket in 2009, Buchholz took 
a perfect game into the ninth inning against the Louisville Bats, but it 
was denied after a leadoff single; ultimately, he pitched a one-hit shutout.[19] 
After a July 12 win before the All-Star break, Red Sox manager Terry Francona 
announced that Buchholz would be activated to pitch against the Toronto 
Blue Jays on July 17, in order to give more time off to the starters who 
were in the All-Star game.[20] Buchholz went on to win the game, pitching 
five and two thirds innings, allowing four hits with one run, while walking 
three and striking out three. It was his first major league win since May 
2, 2008. The Red Sox pitching staff floundered in the second half of the 
year. Wakefield, Beckett and Lester were the only dependable starters in 
the first half (John Smoltz, Daisuke Matsuzaka and Brad Penny all had losing 
records). While Lester remained effective in the second half, Beckett began 
to struggle, and when All-Star Tim Wakefield was placed on the disabled 
list, Buchholz replaced him in the rotation. Buchholz' pitching down the 
stretch played a large role in helping the Red Sox make it into the playoffs 
(along with a strong return from Matsuzaka). He finished the season 7–4 
with a 4.21 ERA and 68 strikeouts in 16 starts. Buchholz delivered a strong 
first half of the 2010 season. On the strength of his 10–4 record, and 
a 2.45 ERA, he was selected to the American League All-Star Team. In the 
month of June, Buchholz went 3–1 with a 1.84 ERA, including a five-hit 
shutout at Baltimore on June 4[21] — his first shutout since his 2007 no-hitter, 
which, coincidentally, was also against Baltimore . On the road in the 
season's first half, he went 5–1 with a 1.70 ERA. Though earning a spot 
on the roster, Buchholz was not called upon to pitch in the All-Star Game; 
he pulled a hamstring June 26 during an interleague game against the San 
Francisco Giants and was placed on the disabled list. He made his first 
start after his stint on the DL on July 21 against Gio Gonzalez of the 
Oakland Athletics, pitching four innings, giving up five earned runs, with 
two strikeouts and three walks in a 6–4 loss. Buchholz returned to his 
pre-injury form after the start in Oakland by going 4–0 in August with 
a 1.03 ERA and winning the AL pitcher of the month award. Buchholz finished 
the season with a 17–7 record and 2.33 ERA, thereby finishing second in 
ERA to Félix Hernández.[22] Buchholz finished sixth in the voting for the 
American League Cy Young Award, also won by Hernandez.[23] Buchholz began 
the season as the number three starter in the Red Sox rotation. On April 
10, Buchholz signed a 4-year contract extension, worth nearly $30 million.[24] 
On June 16, he went on the disabled list unexpectedly and in August it 
was reported that he had a stress fracture in his back. He then missed 
the rest of the season.[25] In 2011, Buchholz made 14 starts going 6-3 
with a 3.48 ERA. Buchholz started the 2012 season 8-2, winning four consecutive 
decisions. However, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list after he 
was hospitalized with a "gastrointestinal situation", stated then-manager 
Bobby Valentine. On August 16, Buchholz pitched an immaculate inning against 
the Baltimore Orioles in the sixth inning. He went on to win the game 6-3 
in eight innings of work.[26] On June 26, he was diagnosed with esophagitis, 
an inflammation that damages tissues of the esophagus. For the 2012 year, 
Buchholz made 29 starts with an 11-8 record and a 4.56 ERA. On April 14, 
Buchholz took a no-hitter into the top of the eighth inning against the 
Tampa Bay Rays before allowing a hit. Buchholz went on to finish the month 
of April with a 5-0 record, followed by picking up his sixth win in his 
first start of May. This made his ERA in those six starts 1.01, to go with 
a win in every appearance. In April he was named Pitcher of the Month along 
with Matt Harvey. Buchholz had a 9-0 record until being placed on the disabled 
list on June 18 due to a neck strain that had been bothering him since 
June 9,[27] causing him to be out until September 10. Buchholz won 3 of 
his 4 starts after returning from injury, finishing the regular season 
with a record of 12-1. In the postseason, Buchholz made 4 starts despite 
re-aggravating his shoulder injury and won his first World Series ring 
when the Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in six games.[28] Buchholz 
struggled to start the 2014 season, posting a 7.02 ERA through two months. 
He finished the year with a 8-11 record and a 5.34 ERA. He was the only 
pitcher on the Red Sox Opening Day rotation not to be traded. Buchholz 
made his first Opening Day start for the Red Sox on April 6 against the 
Philadelphia Phillies.[29] He ended the season with a 7-7 record in 18 
starts, compiling an ERA of 3.26 and a WHIP of 1.21 with 107 strikeouts.[30] 
Once again, his season was cut short by injury. Buchholz made his first 
start on April 6 against the Cleveland Indians.[31] During the rest of 
his starts, he compiled an ERA of 6.35 and a WHIP of 1.46 with 35 strikeouts. 
After his start on May 26 against the Colorado Rockies, the Red Sox announced 
that he would be moved to the bullpen. On June 19, he was moved back into 
the rotation. On July 2, Buchholz recorded a 21-2 loss against the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim, one of the worst in MLB history, giving him 
a 3-9 record for the 2016 season as of that night. The Red Sox announced 
on July 4 after a 12-5 win against the Texas Rangers that Clay Buchholz 
would again be moved to the bullpen.[32][33][34][35] Buchholz throws a 
four-seam fastball (90–94 mph) topping out at 96 and has reached 99 in 
the past, a two-seam fastball (89–93), a cutter (87–91), a curveball (75–79), 
and a straight changeup (78–81). Since 2010, he has not thrown a slider 
(78–81). In 2012, he threw a handful of splitters to left-handed hitters, 
but the pitch was thrown just 2% of the time the whole season.[36] His 
most commonly thrown pitch when ahead in the count is his 11–5 curveball. 
His repertoire does not vary greatly between left-handers and right-handers. 
Buchholz has never compiled large strikeout totals, but his changeup does 
have a high whiff rate of 45%.[37] Buchholz has regularly supported the 
Jimmy Fund charity while a Red Sox. In November 2006, when he was Red Sox 
minor-league pitcher of the year, Buchholz was announced as a member of 
the New Stars for Young Stars team. In 2010, he was named Jimmy Fund Co-captain 
with Tim Wakefield. He signed on for the same role in 2011. He and Wakefield 
are the 2011 Spokesplayers for the Rally Against Cancer. [38] In March 
2011, he partnered with Charity Wines to release his own wine label under 
the Longball Cellars brand. Proceeds from sales of his ChardonClay chardonnay 
support the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber. He partners with teammate Jon Lester, 
who is also releasing a Charity Wine, called CabernAce, to raise money 
for the Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.[39] On November 14, 2009 he 
married Lindsay Clubine, a model on the TV show Deal or No Deal who was 
featured in People magazine's "100 Most Beautiful People."[40] Their first 
child, a daughter named Colbi Dawn, was born on August 4, 2010.[41] He
