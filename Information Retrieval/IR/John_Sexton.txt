John Edward Sexton (born September 29, 1942) is an American lawyer and 
academic. Sexton served as the fifteenth President of New York University, 
from 2002 to 2015. From 1988 to 2002, he served as Dean of the NYU School 
of Law, during which time NYU became one of the top five law schools in 
the country according to U.S. News and World Report. From January 1, 2003 
to January 1, 2007, he was the Chairman of the Board of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York; in 2006, he served as chair of the Federal Reserve System's 
Council of Chairs. Sexton graduated from Brooklyn Prep, a Jesuit high school, 
in 1959. He holds a B.A. in history (1963), an M.A. in comparative religion 
(1965), and a Ph.D. in history of American religion (1978) from Fordham 
University, as well as a J.D. (1979) magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, 
where he was Supreme Court Editor of the Harvard Law Review. From 1966 
to 1975, he taught religion at St. Francis College in Brooklyn, New York, 
where he was chair of the Religion Department. In 1977, he incorporated 
the John Sexton Test Preparation Center in the New York City area, which 
offered test preparation services for exams such as the GMAT and LSAT. 
According to a government report, it served 6,500 students and had revenue 
of over $650,000 in 1979.[1][2] From 1961 to 1975, Sexton coached the debate 
team at St. Brendan's High School, a Catholic girls' school in Brooklyn, 
New York, leading the team to five national championships and numerous 
invitational titles. He was named to the National Forensic League Hall 
of Fame in 2003. In 2005, the Barkley Forum at Emory University presented 
him with a Golden Anniversary Coaching Award recognizing him as a top high 
school debate coach of the past 50 years. Still an avid proponent of interscholastic 
debate, he is chairman of the board of Associated Leaders of Urban Debate 
(ALOUD), which seeks to bring debate activities to underserved communities 
in America's urban areas. After graduating from Harvard Law School, he 
clerked for judges Harold Leventhal and David L. Bazelon of the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1979-80, 
and he clerked for Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger 
in 1980-81. Sexton joined the faculty of the New York University School 
of Law in 1981; he received tenure in 1983. Sexton has written several 
books and many articles, including Redefining the Supreme Court's Role: 
A Theory of Managing the Federal Judicial Process (with Samuel Estreicher 
(Yale University Press, 1986)), and the 141-page A Managerial Theory of 
the Supreme Court's Responsibilities: An Empirical Study published in the 
NYU Law Review (with Samuel Estreicher) in October 1984. This book and 
study were the centerpiece of a national debate over the creation of a 
new intermediate court to fit between the Supreme Court of the United States 
and the state supreme courts and the United States courts of appeals.[3] 
Sexton co-edited Civil Procedure: Cases and Materials (along with John 
Cound, Jack Friedenthal, Helen Hershkoff, and Arthur R. Miller) a widely 
used textbook on civil procedure. In 1988, Sexton was named dean of the 
New York University School of Law, succeeding Norman Redlich. During his 
deanship, NYU’s School of Law rose to number five in the U.S. News & World 
Report rankings of law schools; an emphasis on faculty recruitment reduced 
the student faculty ratio from 19:1 to 12:1; the Hauser Global Law School 
Program [4] was established; the school became among the most selective 
in the U.S. (average LSAT scores rose from the 94th to the 97th percentile; 
average GPAs rose from 3.54. to 3.66); and in 1998 the school completed 
the then-largest fundraising campaign in the history of legal education 
($185 million). In 2000, Kent D. Syverud, then-dean of the Vanderbilt University 
Law School, called John Sexton the most effective dean of his generation.[5] 
Sexton was named the 15th president of New York University by NYU's Board 
of Trustees on May 8, 2001, about two months after then-President L. Jay 
Oliva announced that he was stepping down. "I am a very fortunate man," 
Sexton told the New York Daily News in an article published the next day. 
He assumed the post of president on May 17, 2002, one day after the 2002 
All-University Commencement, and his official installation occurred on 
September 26, 2002. In 2009, NYU’s Board of Trustees asked him to stay 
on as president until 2016, and Sexton accepted. While serving as president, 
Sexton also actively taught; in 2008-09, he taught two courses for NYU 
undergraduates – a fall freshman seminar on the Supreme Court’s church 
and state cases, and a spring class for upperclassmen called “Baseball 
as a Road to God” (which he discussed at length in a conversation on Bill 
Moyers Journal).[6] In addition, he taught a year-long course on the American 
Constitution, religion, and government for the Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed 
Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan Scholars Program (outstanding undergraduate 
students in United Arab Emirates’ institutions of higher learning who are 
selected for special academic and leadership opportunities). During his 
presidency, NYU was named the “number one dream school” four times by The 
Princeton Review.[7] In 2014, NYU received a record number of prospective 
applicants for freshman admission for the seventh straight year in a row.[8] 
As president, Sexton wrote a number of “Reflections” on the nature of higher 
education and challenges facing universities.[9] He has also discussed 
the nature of the university extensively on The Open Mind (TV series).[10] 
He appeared as a guest on The Colbert Report on December 6, 2006; during 
his time in the studio, he gave Stephen Colbert a hug.[11] He appeared 
again on The Colbert Report on March 7, 2013 to promote his book Baseball 
as a Road to God.[12] In May 2010, Sexton was profiled by Bloomberg Businessweek 
in an article that focused on his priorities for New York University.[13] 
In its 25th anniversary issue in June 2010, Crains New York Business named 
Sexton one of its 25 People to Watch.[14] In July 2010, he appeared on 
Charlie Rose (talk show) to discuss the global network university, NYU's 
Abu Dhabi campus, and the state of public discourse, among other topics.[15] 
In addition to his duties as NYU president, Sexton teaches a full faculty 
course-load.[16] A book based on one the courses -- "Baseball as a Road 
to God"—was published in 2013.[17] During Sexton's presidency: In 2004, 
Sexton announced a program – the Partners Plan - to expand tenured and 
tenure-track faculty in the arts and sciences by 20 percent,[25] the largest 
such expansion in the University's history. As of fall 2009, faculty hires 
under the Partners Plan included totaled 245, including 124 hires to replace 
departing faculty and 121 new hires to expand the arts and science faculty.[citation 
needed] In 2008, NYU successfully finished what was then the largest completed 
fundraising campaign in higher education.[26] The Campaign for NYU, with 
a stated goal of raising $2.5 billion, ultimately raised over $3 billion. 
In 2009, NYU’s fundraising continued to exceed $1 million per day in spite 
of the economic crisis.[citation needed] In October 2007, NYU announced[27] 
the creation of New York University Abu Dhabi,[28] the first such campus 
to be operated abroad by a major research university. The school, which 
the university is referring to as the “world’s honors college,”[29] is 
recruiting top students and faculty from around the world,[30] and began 
classes in the fall of 2010. NYU Abu Dhabi is led by Vice Chancellor Al 
Bloom, who took on the post in 2009 after 18 years as president of Swarthmore 
College.[31] NYU Abu Dhabi recruited an outstandingly strong first freshman 
class, which was notable for its selectivity (189 students were accepted 
out of 9,048 applicants worldwide (an acceptance rate of 2.1 percent), 
with a 79.4 percent yield), its geographic diversity (the class of 150 
students will include students from 39 countries on six continents), and 
the academic qualifications of its students (at the classes’ 75th percentile, 
the SAT critical reading score was 770 (ranking it fifth among US universities) 
and the math score was 780 (ranking it sixth); the median SAT score (on 
the 1600 scale) was 1470). The recruitment of the class was reported on 
in an article in The New York Times on June 21, 2010.[32] Newsweek magazine 
carried a Q+A with Sexton about the Abu Dhabi campus in August 2008.[33] 
In August 2009, Sexton discussed the emergence of NYU as a Global Network 
University in an interview[34] on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition 
– Sunday with David Greene, as well as in two articles[35] in Abu Dhabi’s 
English-language newspaper, The National (Abu Dhabi). During Sexton’s presidency, 
the percentage of NYU students studying abroad has increased to over 40 
percent, and the Institute of International Education recognized NYU as 
sending more students abroad than any other US university.[36] The number 
of Study Abroad sites doubled, including the first sites in Asia and Africa. 
In fall 2009, NYU opened its latest site in Tel Aviv. In addition to its 
portal campus in Abu Dhabi, NYU currently operated ten Global sites on 
five continents.[37] In addition to its global sites, individual NYU schools 
and programs operate some two dozen international programs, including NYU’s 
Tisch School of the Arts’ TischAsia in Singapore.[38] The Stern School 
of Business implemented global components in its undergraduate curriculum.[39] 
The NYU School of Law established an LL.M. joint degree program [40] with 
the National University of Singapore. Sexton discussed the idea of the 
Global Network University at length in late 2009 with Richard Heffner on 
The Open Mind (TV series).[41] "The New Global University" was a topic 
of the British Council's Going Global conference in March 2010, at which 
Sexton was invited to speak.[42] At the events marking the announcement 
of Gordon Brown as NYU's first Global Distinguished Leader in Residence 
in December 2010, he discussed the Global Network University concept at 
length.[43] In March 2011, NAFSA: Association of International Educators 
recognized NYU with its Senator Paul Simon Award for Campus Internationalization,[44] 
and Fast Company (magazine) named NYU #1 on its list of education innovators, 
citing the opening of NYU Abu Dhabi.[45] On March 28, 2011, the University 
announced the creation of New York University Shanghai, a research university 
with a liberal arts and science college in China’s financial capital, the 
first American university with independent legal status approved by the 
Chinese Ministry of Education, and the result of a partnership between 
NYU and Shanghai.[46] In April 2011, at the U.S. State Department's US-China 
Consultation on People-to-People Exchange, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
cited NYU's announcement about the opening of NYU Shanghai, and praised 
John Sexton's work on the project.[47] On July 11, 2011, in response to 
the detention of law-abiding democracy advocates by the government of the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Sexton's suggestion that such detention 
was appropriate to the UAE's "security concerns," Human Rights Watch asked 
Sexton to publicly retract his statements on the matter.[48] He did not 
respond to this request. Both Sexton’s own transition reports[49] and the 
Middle States Accreditation Report[50] cited the need to enhance the experience 
of NYU undergraduates. Since Sexton’s appointment, NYU put in place the 
award-winning[51] 24/7 Wellness Exchange,[52] specialized programming in 
student dorms,[53] and novel resources to assist students.[54] In addition, 
NYU’s Student Health Center[55] has been a pioneer in depression screening 
among college students.[56] In 2002, Sexton’s transition teams identified 
the need for improved and better coordinated planning.[49] In June 2008, 
the NYU published Framework 2031,[57] which reviewed and addressed the 
key issues, concerns, and opportunities the University would confront over 
the two-plus decades leading to its bicentennial. Increases in the size 
of the student body and program development that began to accelerate in 
the 1990s sparked resistance in the Greenwich Village neighborhood, as 
community members opposed NYU's expansion projects. In 2007, NYU began 
a space planning process with intensive community involvement to provide 
a roadmap for aligning the University’s academic needs and its growth through 
2031; the process included a number of open houses to provide for community 
input.[58] In April 2010, the University announced NYU 2031: NYU in NYC, 
a long-term, city-wide strategic framework for how and where NYU should 
develop space for its academic mission. The strategy envisioned the addition 
of as much as 6,000,000 sq ft (560,000 m2) of space over more than two 
decades, but recognized that all of NYU's space needs could not be accommodated 
within its neighborhood; therefore NYU 2031: NYU in NYC called for fully 
half of the growth to be spread over three locations outside Greenwich 
Village—along Manhattan's Eastside health corridor, in Downtown Brooklyn, 
and on Governors Island—and half in or near its core.[59] In March 2011, 
NYU announced updates to its plans to expand over the coming two decades, 
and in particular its proposal for the two "superblocks" near its campus 
core.[60] Following editorial support by several New York City newspapers, 
including the New York Times,[61] The New York Daily News[62] The New York 
Post,[63] Crain's New York Business[64] and the New York Observer,[65] 
and the approval of the New York City Planning Commission,[citation needed] 
the New York City Council overwhelmingly voted approval (44-1 in favor) 
of the NYU 2031 proposals in July 2012.[citation needed] Sexton has held 
a number of leadership positions in major higher education organizations. 
While Dean of the NYU School of Law, Sexton served as president of the 
Association of American Law Schools. In 2009, Sexton served as chair of 
the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, vice-chair and 
chair-designate of the American Council on Education, and chair of the 
New York Academy of Sciences. He is also a member of the board of the Association 
of American Universities, a member of the board of the National Association 
of Independent Colleges and Universities, and a member of the board of 
the Institute of International Education.[citation needed] In 2008-09, 
Sexton co-chaired (with Rick Trainor, the principal of King's College London) 
the US-UK Study Group on Higher Education in a Global Environment,[66] 
a working group of university presidents constituted by British Prime Minister 
Gordon Brown. In August 2008, Sexton was cited in Newsweek magazine in 
a piece called “The Campus of the Future”.[67] In October 2009, Sexton 
was suggested as a recipient of a prize for leadership on the Washingtonpost.com 
site [68] by Paul R. Portney, dean of the Eller College of Management at 
the University of Arizona. In November 2009, Time (magazine) named Sexton 
one of the 10 Best College Presidents.[69] In March 2010, Sexton was named 
Chair of the American Council on Education[70] In December 2010, Sexton 
was cited in the On Leadership section of The Washington Post for his efforts 
as president of NYU.[71] In 2011, Sexton led a blue ribbon panel assembled 
by the American Council on Education that issued a report on the competitiveness 
of U.S. universities and the global higher education environment.[72] Sexton 
was interviewed by sociologist Jonathan VanAntwerpen for chapter four of 
the book Shakespeare, Einstein, and the Bottom Line: The Marketing of Higher 
Education (David L. Kirp et al.).[73] He was also interviewed by Stephen 
Nelson about universities and their place in public dialogue for the book 
Leaders in the Labyrinth.[74] He has also discussed issues relating to 
the academy several times on The Open Mind (talk show).[75] Sexton currently 
serves on the Council of Presidents for the University of the People. His 
experience has helped build the frameworks in establishing the world's 
first non-profit, tuition-free, online academic institution that seeks 
to revolutionize higher education by making college-level studies accessible 
to students worldwide. In recent years, there has been controversy at NYU 
over the issue of collective bargaining and union representation for graduate 
teaching assistants (TAs) as well as research assistants (RAs). In 2001, 
NYU signed the first and only collective bargaining agreement for TAs at 
a private university.[76] In July 2004 in a case involving Brown University, 
the National Labor Relations Board reversed its 2000 ruling involving NYU 
and – reverting to long-standing prior precedent—determined that graduate 
students are not workers.[77] In the spring and summer of 2005, there were 
discussions between NYU and the United Auto Workers (which represented 
the TAs) to try to come to terms on a new contract. Ultimately, this proved 
unsuccessful, and NYU decided not to negotiate a second contract [78] with 
the Graduate Student Organizing Committee, sparking a strike among graduate 
assistants in late 2005 and criticism of Sexton. GSOC called off the strike 
in 2006.[79] In 2009, NYU’s Graduate School of Arts & Science – home to 
most of the NYU's fully funded graduate students — modified its financial 
aid packages for graduate students to eliminate assistantship duties; thereafter, 
graduate students who wished to teach could do so (with additional compensation 
beyond their graduate study stipends) as adjunct faculty, who are unionized 
at NYU.[80] In November 2013, NYU and the UAW announced a joint agreement 
to recognize a graduate student union; in March 2015, the two sides reached 
agreement on a contract. During Sexton’s presidency, NYU also became involved 
in a disagreement with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education 
(FIRE). FIRE claimed that NYU wrongly (but constitutionally, since NYU 
is a private school) suppressed the display of Mohammad cartoons in April 
2006, which were planned to accompany an event sponsored by an NYU student 
organization, the Objectivist Club. The student organizers had been given 
a choice by the University: the cartoons could be displayed, in which case 
the event would have to be an NYU-only event, open to the 60,000 member 
NYU community; or the Club could choose not to display the cartoons, in 
which case the event could be open to the general public as well. The Objectivist 
Club chose the latter format. In a letter, Sexton challenged FIRE claims.[81] 
In both the NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai campuses, NYU, under Sexton, 
has insisted on having full discretion over academic matters and that the 
principles of academic freedom prevail. Regarding NYU's establishment of 
campuses in countries where strong restrictions exist on free public expression, 
Sexton has suggested that academic freedom and the right to political expression 
are easily distinguishable from one another: "I have no trouble distinguishing 
between rights of academic freedom and rights of political expression," 
he said. "These are two different things." [82] Following editorial support 
by several New York City newspapers, including the New York Times,[61] 
The New York Daily News[62] The New York Post,[63] Crain's New York Business[64] 
and the New York Observer,[65] and the approval of the New York City Planning 
Commission,[citation needed] the New York City Council overwhelmingly voted 
approval (44-1 in favor) of the NYU 2031 proposals in July 2012.[citation 
needed] Some members of the faculty[who?] claimed that the administration 
of New York University, in seeking approvals for the NYU 2031 plan, would 
create a development project that would remove large tracts of open space 
from Greenwich Village and create a construction zone on and off for years 
to come. Out of 170 academic departments in the University, 37 passed resolutions 
against the NYU 2031 plan, including a majority of the departments in the 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences; in response, Sexton indicated in a University 
Senate meeting in spring 2012 that he would establish a presidential working 
group, composed largely of faculty selected by the Faculty Senators Council 
and the schools and chaired by the head of the Faculty Senators Council, 
to review space and development issues. That group, the University Space 
Priorities Working Group, began its work in fall 2012.[83] It completed 
its work in March 2014. In its final report, the group found that NYU did 
indeed have a pressing need for additional academic space, determined that 
the University's plans for a new facility were within it financial means, 
and recommended that the University with a new facility on the site of 
the Coles Sports and Recreation Center. A faculty organization called "Faculty 
Against the Sexton Plan" was formed to fight the administration's plans.[84] 
The plan, which had prompted contentious public meetings within the Greenwich 
Village community during the approvals process, was, as noted above, ultimately 
approved by the New York City Council by a vote 44-1.[85] That group was 
one of a number of plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the University over 
the plan; in October 2014, the Appellate Division of the New York State 
Supreme Court ruled for NYU and the City and against the plaintiffs.[86] 
On March 15, 2013, Sexton lost a vote of no confidence among NYU Faculty 
of Arts and Sciences, by a vote of 52% to 39% with 8% abstaining; with 
a total of 83% voter participation.[87] Subsequently, faculty of the Gallatin 
School, the Steinhardt School, and the Tisch School also passed votes of 
no confidence. However, the NYU Board of Trustees reaffirmed their support 
for Sexton;[88] moreover, the faculty of the NYU School of Law passed a 
faculty vote of confidence in Sexton by 59-2 (with 3 abstentions), the 
Faculty Council at the School of Medicine passed a resolution of support 
for Sexton by 28-9, and the School of Social Work voted down a motion of 
no confidence by 20-12 (with 9 abstentions).[89] The University has stated 
that he will retire as the university's president after his contract expires 
in 2016, after 14 years as president, 14 years as Law School dean, and 
seven years as a faculty member.[citation needed] In the 2007-8 school 
year, the NY Post reports, Sexton received $1.3 million in executive compensation 
for his service as president of the university.[90] His salary has increased 
since then to $1.5 million. Sexton will receive a length of service bonus 
of $2.5 million in 2015.[91] He also will receive $800,000 annually in 
retirement.[92] Sexton is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences and President of the New York Academy of Sciences.[93] He is a 
member of the Council on Foreign Relations. In March 2015, Sexton was honored 
with the Theodore Hesburgh Award by the American Council on Education and 
the TIAA-CREF Institute. The award is given annually to a college or university 
president in recognition of outstanding leadership. In 2002, an endowed 
professorship – the John Edward Sexton Professorship of Law – was created 
in his honor at the NYU School of Law. In 2003, the 60th anniversary edition 
of NYU’s Annual Survey of American Law was dedicated[94] to Sexton. In 
July 2008, he was named a Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur. He has received 
honorary degrees from Hamilton College, the University of Warwick in the 
UK, Fordham University, St. John's University (New York), the University 
of Rochester, St. Francis College, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Saint 
Joseph's College (New York), the University of Surrey, King's College London, 
the University of Strathclyde, and in 2016 he received an honorary doctorate 
from Felician University. Sexton was named the Brooklyn Prep “Alumnus of 
the Year” in 1995 and he was selected as the featured speaker Harvard Law 
School Forum Speaker in 2005.[95] He is a fellow of the Foreign Policy 
Association based in New York City.[citation needed] John Sexton serves 
as a member of the Advisory Board of the Genesis Prize Foundation.[96] 
Sexton's marriage to author Kathleen B. Jones, a student whom he met while 
a debate coach at St. Brendan's High School[97] was annulled after five 
years. Jones described the marriage as a "storybook romance" between a 
"young debate coach" and an "even younger star debater" in her non-fiction 
book Living Between Danger and Love.[98] He met Lisa E. Goldberg, who became 
his wife in 1976, while they were both students at Harvard Law School. 
Ms. Goldberg, who became president of the Charles H. Revson Foundation, 
died suddenly of a brain aneurysm on January 21, 2007 at age 54.[99] He 
eulogized her at a memorial service in February 2007.[100] Sexton's older 
child, Jed, is a Harvard graduate and aspiring actor. He is married to 
Danielle DeCrette, a former administrative employee at NYU Law.[101][102][103][104] 
They have three daughters: Julia, Ava, and Natalie. Sexton's younger child 
is Katherine Lodgen Sexton, a graduate of Yale and the NYU School of Law.[105] 
She married Eric Gurian in December 2013.[106] Thomas Oliphant's New York 
Times Bestseller Praying for Gil Hodges briefly mentions that Sexton grew 
up as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. In fact, Sexton is such a well-known baseball 
fan that he was an early participant in Rotissere (or Fantasy) Baseball, 
as a member of the Eddie Gaedel Baseball League. Sexton was one of a number 
of celebrities who reminisced about their baseball memories on the HBO 
special Brooklyn Dodgers - Ghosts of Flatbush. In July 2009, Sexton threw 
out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals Game.[107] He teaches "Baseball 
as a Road To God" at NYU and in 2013 wrote a book of the same name.[108] 
Over the years, Sexton has been the subject of several public profiles 
in prominent media venues. In September 2009, he was featured in The New 
York Times’ Sunday Routines section.[109] He is a Roman Catholic.[109] 
In March 2010, he was interviewed by Bill Moyers on the PBS Public Broadcasting 
Service show Bill Moyers Journal.[110] In May 2010, he was the subject 
of a NY1 profile on One on 1 with Budd Mishkin.[111] In Sept. 2013, he
