Steven Norman "Steve" Carlton (born December 22, 1944), nicknamed "Lefty", 
is a former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched from 
1965 to 1988 for six different teams in his career, but it is his time 
with the Philadelphia Phillies where he received his greatest acclaim as 
a professional and won four Cy Young Awards. He was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1994. Carlton has the second-most lifetime strikeouts of 
any left-handed pitcher (4th overall), and the second-most lifetime wins 
of any left-handed pitcher (11th overall). He was the first pitcher to 
win four Cy Young Awards in a career. He held the lifetime strikeout record 
several times between 1982 and 1984, before his contemporary Nolan Ryan 
passed him. One of his most remarkable records was accounting for nearly 
half (46%) of his team's wins, when he won 27 games for the last-place 
(59-97) 1972 Phillies. He is the last National League pitcher to win 25 
or more games in one season,[1] as well as the last pitcher from any team 
to throw more than 300 innings in a season.[2] He also holds the record 
with the most career balks of any pitcher, with 90 (double the second on 
the all-time list, Bob Welch). Carlton was born and raised in Miami, Florida, 
where he played Little League and American Legion Baseball during his youth. 
He attended North Miami High School, and later Miami Dade College. In 1963, 
while a student at Miami-Dade, he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals for 
a $5,000 bonus.[3][4][N 1] Carlton debuted with the St. Louis Cardinals 
as a 20-year-old in 1965 and by 1967 was a regular in the Cardinals rotation. 
An imposing 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) man with a hard fastball and slider, 
Carlton was soon known as an intimidating and dominant pitcher. Carlton 
enjoyed immediate success in St. Louis, posting winning records and reaching 
the World Series in 1967 and 1968. On September 15, 1969, Carlton struck 
out 19 New York Mets, while losing to the Mets, 4–3, setting the all-time 
modern-day record at that time for strikeouts in a nine-inning game. That 
season, he finished with a 17–11 record with a 2.17 ERA, second lowest 
in the NL, and 210 strikeouts. A contract dispute with the Cardinals (he 
had made $26,000 in 1969 and was holding out for $50,000, as opposed to 
the Cardinals' contract offer for just $31,000)[nb 1]made Carlton a no-show 
at spring training in 1970. He proceeded to go 10–19 with a 3.73 ERA, leading 
the NL in losses. In 1971, he became a 20-game winner for the first time, 
going 20–9 with a 3.56 ERA. Following a salary dispute, Cardinals owner 
Gussie Busch ordered Carlton traded. Eventually, he was traded to the Philadelphia 
Phillies before the 1972 season for pitcher Rick Wise.[6] The trade is 
now considered one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history.[7] However, 
at the time, the trade appeared to make sense from the Cardinals' perspective. 
Carlton had won 77 games to Wise's 75, and both were considered among the 
game's best pitchers. Tim McCarver, who had caught for Carlton in St. Louis 
and for Wise in Philadelphia, described the trade as "a real good one for 
a real good one." He felt Carlton had more raw talent, but Wise had better 
command on the mound.[8] Although Wise would stay in the majors for another 
11 years (though only two of them were with the Cardinals), the trade is 
now reckoned as an epoch-making deal for the Phillies, as well as one of 
the worst trades in Cardinals history. In Carlton's first season with Philadelphia, 
he led the league in wins (27), complete games (30), strikeouts (310), 
and ERA (1.97), despite playing for a team whose final record was 59–97. 
His 1972 performance earned him his first Cy Young Award and the Hickok 
Belt as the top professional athlete of the year. His having won 46% of 
his team's victories that season is a record in modern major league history. 
Carlton attributed his success to his grueling training regimen, which 
included Eastern martial arts techniques, the most famous of which was 
twisting his fist to the bottom of a 5-gallon bucket of rice.[9] Some highlights 
of Carlton's 1972 season included starting the season with 5 wins and 1 
loss, then losing 5 games in a row, during which period the Phillies scored 
only 10 runs.[10] At this point he began a 15-game winning streak. After 
it ended at a 20–6 record, he finished the final third of the year with 
7 more wins and 4 losses, ending with 27 wins and 10 losses. Carlton also 
completed 30 of 41 starts.[11] During the 18 games of the winning streak 
(3 were no-decisions), Carlton pitched 155 innings, allowed 103 hits and 
28 runs (only 17 in the 15 winning games), issued 39 walks, and had 140 
strikeouts. From July 23, 1972 to August 13, 1972 he pitched five complete 
game victories, allowed only 1 unearned run while only giving up 22 hits 
in 45 innings, and threw four shutouts.[12] He had a fastball, a legendary 
slider, and a long looping curve ball; and later a change-up, then a screwball. 
Baseball commentators during 1972 regularly remarked that Carlton's slider 
was basically unhittable, while Pittsburgh Pirates slugger Willie Stargell 
once remarked, "Hitting Steve Carlton's slider is like trying to drink 
coffee with a fork".[13] He was also a good hitter for a pitcher; at times 
he pinch-hit for the Phillies during 1972. Carlton slumped in 1973, losing 
20 games. The media's questioning of his unusual training techniques led 
to an acrimonious relationship between them and Carlton, and by 1976 he 
severed all ties with the media, refusing to answer press questions for 
the rest of his career with the Phillies.[14] This reached a point where, 
in 1981, while the Mexican rookie Fernando Valenzuela was achieving stardom 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers, a reporter remarked, "The two best pitchers 
in the National League don't speak English: Fernando Valenzuela and Steve 
Carlton."[15] In 1994 he agreed to an interview with writer Pat Jordan 
at his home in Durango, Colorado. The result was the story "Thin Mountain 
Air" in the April 1994 issue of Philadelphia magazine.[16] Carlton continued 
to enjoy many years of success with the Phillies, winning the Cy Young 
Award in 1972, 1977, 1980, and 1982, and pitching the Phillies to the best 
string of post-season appearances in club history. Carlton was the first 
pitcher to win four Cy Young Awards, a mark later matched by Greg Maddux, 
and exceeded by Roger Clemens and Randy Johnson. His Cy Young Award in 
1972 was by unanimous vote, and he finished fifth in balloting for the 
National League MVP. Gradually the Phillies improved their team, and won 
the National League East three consecutive times from 1976 to 1978. In 
1980, Carlton helped the Phillies win their first World Series, personally 
winning the final game.[17] Carlton won a Gold Glove Award for his fielding 
in 1981, and helped the Phillies to another pennant in 1983, but they lost 
to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.[18] On September 13, 1982, 
for the fourth time in his career, Steve Carlton hit a home run and tossed 
a complete game shutout in the same game. He is the only pitcher to have 
done so in three different decades.[citation needed] On September 23, 1983, 
in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Carlton won the 300th game of 
his career, becoming the 16th pitcher to accomplish the feat.[19] Over 
a three-year period between 1982–1984, Carlton was involved in an interesting 
pitching duel with Nolan Ryan and Gaylord Perry, in which they often traded 
places at the top of the all-time strikeout list. At the start of the 1983 
season, the 55-year-old mark of the great Walter Johnson still stood at 
3,508 strikeouts,[20] but now there were three pitchers who would start 
the season within 100 strikeouts of Johnson: Nolan Ryan (3,494), Gaylord 
Perry (3,452), and Carlton (3,434). Ryan would be the first to surpass 
Johnson on April 22, 1983 against the Montreal Expos. However a stint on 
the disabled list shortly after he set the record, combined with a spectacular 
season by Carlton, allowed Carlton to make up ground and on June 7, 1983, 
Carlton passed Ryan as the all-time strikeout king with 3,526 to Ryan's 
3,524. There would be 14 lead changes and one tie that season, often after 
each of their respective starts, before the season ended with Carlton leading 
3,709 to 3,677. Gaylord Perry, aging and in his final season, was never 
a huge factor, although he later passed Johnson to finish his career with 
3,534 strikeouts. Since then five other pitchers have surpassed Johnson's 
mark and he has fallen to ninth place on the all-time strikeout list. There 
would be five more lead changes and a tie in 1984 before Carlton ran out 
of gas. His last-ever lead in the all-time strikeout race was after his 
start on September 4, 1984, when he struck out four Cubs to lead Ryan by 
three (3,857 to 3,854). Although the season ended with a mere two-strikeout 
lead for Ryan (3,874 to 3,872), Carlton had an injury-riddled season in 
1985 and an even worse season in 1986 before being released by the Phillies 
just 18 strikeouts short of 4,000. After being released by the Phillies, 
Carlton joined the San Francisco Giants; he also broke his self-imposed 
boycott of the media, giving a press conference after signing with the 
team. Unfortunately, Carlton mostly pitched ineffectively — except for 
seven shutout innings in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, in which 
he also hit a 3-run homer, for his only win as a Giant. Overall, he went 
1–3 with a 5.10 ERA in six games for the Giants, hanging around just long 
enough to collect his 4,000th strikeout (against Eric Davis), before announcing 
his retirement. Carlton's retirement was brief: he almost immediately signed 
with the Chicago White Sox for the remainder of the 1986 season. He was 
surprisingly effective, going 4–3 with a respectable 3.69 ERA, but was 
not offered a contract for 1987. Overall, Carlton's 1986 numbers (with 
three teams) were a 9-14 win-loss record, with a 5.10 ERA. In 1987, Carlton 
joined the Cleveland Indians, where his most notable achievement was teaming 
up with Phil Niekro in a game against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, 
where they became the first teammates and 300-game winners to appear in 
the same game. Both were ineffective in a 10–6 Yankee victory. It would 
be Carlton's first and only pitching appearance in Yankee Stadium, having 
spent the majority of his career in the National League before the inception 
of interleague play. (He was selected to the 1977 National League All-Star 
team which was held in Yankee Stadium, but he didn't appear in the game.) 
Carlton was traded to the Minnesota Twins in late July 1987, where he was 
yet again ineffective. He went a combined 6–14 with a 5.74 ERA for both 
the Indians and Twins. However, the Twins, who had been a bad team for 
most of the 1980s, would go on to a surprising win in the 1987 World Series, 
albeit without Carlton on the postseason roster, to earn him a third World 
Series ring and a trip to the White House to meet President Reagan along 
with his teammates. Interestingly, when Carlton was photographed with his 
teammates at the White House, newspapers listed each member of the team 
with the notable exception of Carlton. Instead, Carlton was listed as an 
"unidentified Secret Service agent."[21] The Twins brought him back in 
1988 but he lasted only a month (0-1 with a 16.76 ERA in four games) before 
being released. He attempted to find work in 1989 but found no takers. 
The closest thing to an offer was the New York Yankees offering him the 
use of their facilities for training purposes but no spot on the spring 
training team. Nolan Ryan would pitch until 1993 and would extend his strikeout 
lead over Carlton to almost 1,600 before retiring. Carlton would eventually 
fall to third and then fourth place on the all-time strikeout list after 
Roger Clemens and Randy Johnson passed him. A ten-time All-Star, Carlton 
led the league in many pitching categories. He struck out 4,136 batters 
in his career, setting a record for a left-handed pitcher (since surpassed 
by Randy Johnson), and holds many other records for both left-handed and 
Phillies pitchers. His 329 career wins are the eleventh most in baseball 
history, behind Greg Maddux, Roger Clemens, and Warren Spahn among pitchers 
of the live-ball era (post-1920). He is also second (behind Bob Gibson) 
in major league history for the most consecutive starts with at least six 
innings pitched (69), which was snapped in April 1982.[22] Carlton picked 
144 runners off base, by far the most in Major League Baseball since pickoff 
records began being collected in 1957. Jerry Koosman is second with 82.[23] 
He never threw a no-hitter, but pitched six one-hitters. Carlton was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994 with 96% of the vote, one of the highest 
percentages ever. The Phillies retired his number 32 in 1989, and honored 
him with a statue outside Citizens Bank Park in 2004. In 1998, The Sporting 
News ranked him number 30 on its list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. 
In 1999, he was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. 
Despite his career-long rivalry with Ryan, Carlton maintains his greatest 
rival was Tom Seaver. His losing 19-strikeout effort against the Mets was 
a microcosm of his career against them. While he posted 30 wins against 
them during his career, they bested him 36 times. Carlton appeared in an 
episode of Married... with Children, playing himself in an episode where 
former athletes humiliate Al Bundy while filming a shoe commercial. In 
the episode, Bud asks him for an autograph and he is shown writing with
