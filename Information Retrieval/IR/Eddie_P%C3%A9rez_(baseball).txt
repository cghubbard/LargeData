As Player As Coach Eduardo Rafael Pérez (born May 4, 1968) is a Venezuelan-American 
former professional baseball player and current First Base coach.[1][2] 
He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Atlanta Braves, 
Cleveland Indians and the Milwaukee Brewers. He batted and threw right-handed. 
Pérez is the current bullpen coach for the Atlanta Braves.[2] He was known 
for being pitcher Greg Maddux's personal catcher during his tenure as a 
player with the Braves.[3] Pérez was signed by the Atlanta Braves as an 
amateur free agent in 1986.[1] He spent eight seasons in the Braves' minor 
league system, eventually progressing to their Triple-A affiliate, the 
Richmond Braves.[4] In 1994, he was named the Most Valuable Player of the 
Venezuelan Winter League.[3] He posted a .265 batting average with 19 doubles 
and 40 runs batted in with Richmond in 1995, earning a late season call 
up to Atlanta.[4] Pérez made his major league debut with the Braves on 
September 10, 1995.[1] In his first game as a starting player on September 
15, he hit a home run for his first major league hit.[5][6] Pérez made 
the post-season roster, but didn't get to play as the Braves went on to 
win the 1995 World Series.[1] Pérez served as the Braves' back up catcher 
behind Javy Lopez, but by June 1996, he had taken on the role of personal 
catcher for Greg Maddux, a job previously held by Charlie O'Brien who had 
been granted free agency during the off-season.[7] The Braves went on to 
win the National League pennant before losing to the New York Yankees in 
the 1996 World Series.[8] On September 17, 1997, Pérez hit a grand slam 
home run against the San Francisco Giants, enabling the Braves to tie a 
major league team record with 11 grand slams in one season.[9] With Pérez 
as his catcher, Maddux ended the year with a 2.20 earned run average, second 
best in the National League, as the Braves once again clinched the National 
League East Division crown.[10] The Braves swept the Houston Astros in 
three games in the 1997 National League Division Series before losing to 
the eventual world champion Florida Marlins in the 1997 National League 
Championship Series.[11][12] Pérez had his best year in 1998 when he posted 
a .336 batting average along with a .404 on-base percentage in 61 games.[1] 
He committed only 1 error in 305 total chances for a .997 fielding percentage.[1] 
His working relationship with Maddux continued to improve with Maddux leading 
the National League with 5 shutouts, and a 2.22 earned run average.[13] 
The Braves once again claimed the National League East Division crown and 
defeated the Chicago Cubs in three games in the 1998 National League Division 
Series.[14] Pérez hit an eighth-inning grand slam home run in the decisive 
Game 3 of the series.[15] However, the Braves' season ended when they lost 
to the San Diego Padres in the 1998 National League Championship Series.[16] 
In 1999, Pérez was thrust into a starting role when Javy Lopez suffered 
an injury to a ligament in his right knee in late July and was lost for 
the season.[17] He stepped in with a .249 batting average along with 7 
home runs, 30 runs batted in, and finished fourth in the league in fielding 
percentage and in range factor.[1] The Braves won their fifth consecutive 
National League East Division title and then defeated the Houston Astros 
in four games in the 1999 National League Division Series.[18] In the 1999 
National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, Pérez, normally 
known for his defensive skills, became an offensive standout. He hit a 
home run in Game 1 to help the Braves win 4–2.[19] He followed with a two-run, 
sixth-inning home run in Game 2 that broke a 2–2 tie.[20] Pérez contributed 
a two-run single in the deciding Game 6 as the Braves won 10–9 in 11 innings.[21] 
He totaled 10 hits in 20 at bats for a .500 batting average along with 
2 home runs and 5 runs batted in to earn him the League Championship Series 
Most Valuable Player Award.[22][23] After an emotionally draining National 
League Championship series, the Braves were swept by the New York Yankees 
in four games in the 1999 World Series.[24] In May 2000, Pérez suffered 
a torn rotator cuff and missed the entire season.[25] He re-injured the 
same shoulder in March of 2001 and only appeared in 5 games that season.[26] 
In March 2002, Pérez was traded to the Cleveland Indians who were in need 
of a backup catcher.[27] Pérez became expendable after the Braves acquired 
catcher Henry Blanco.[27] Pérez spent the 2002 season as backup to Einar 
Diaz and was granted free agency at the end of the year.[1] In January 
2003, he signed a contract to play for the Milwaukee Brewers.[1] Pérez 
was in a platoon system alongside Keith Osik in which he started three 
out of every five games.[28] He was hitting for a .315 batting average 
by mid-season, but tapered off to finish the season with a .271 average 
along with career-highs in home runs (11) and runs batted in (45).[29] 
In December 2003, Pérez signed a contract to return to play for the Braves.[30] 
He served as a backup catcher to Johnny Estrada in 2004 and 2005. On May 
18, 2004, he was the last out of Randy Johnson's perfect game, being called 
upon to pinch-hit for pitcher Mike Hampton because of excellent career 
numbers against Johnson (6 hits in 13 at-bats).[31] Nonetheless, he struck 
out to end the perfect game.[32] He suffered tendinitis in his right shoulder 
during the 2005 season and was placed on the disabled list for most of 
the season.[33] While on the disabled list, Perez's duties as catcher were 
taken over by Brian McCann who eventually took over as the Braves' starting 
catcher. He returned to make one final major league appearance as a pinch 
hitter on September 27, 2005 at the age of 37.[34][35] In an eleven-year 
major league career, Pérez played in 564 games, accumulating 386 hits in 
1,525 at bats for a .253 career batting average along with 40 home runs, 
172 runs batted in and a .297 on-base percentage.[1] He ended his career 
with a .991 fielding percentage.[1] In 2006, Pérez was a player-coach for 
the Double-A Mississippi Braves.[4] Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox named 
Pérez as his bullpen coach for the 2007 season.[36] When Fredi Gonzalez 
was named the Braves manager for the 2011 season, he retained Pérez as 
his bullpen coach. After the Braves fired [Fredi Gonzalez] he was moved 
to be the current first base coach for the new manager Brian Snitker. [2] 
Pérez was hired as the manager for the Águilas del Zulia of the Venezuelan 
Winter League for two seasons, 2008-2010.[37] He rejoined the team in the 
2014 season.[38] In 2015, Pérez managed the Tigres de Aragua[39] On August 
13, 2014, Pérez, his wife, and his daughter became naturalized U.S. citizens. 
Pérez, who will retain his Venezuelan citizenship, has lived in the Atlanta 
area since 1994.[40][41] Pérez's son Andres was drafted in the 36th round
