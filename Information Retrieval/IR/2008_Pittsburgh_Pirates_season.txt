The 2008 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the 127th season of the franchise. 
It was the first under new president Frank Coonelly, general manager Neal 
Huntington, and manager John Russell. Unable to improve on their 68–94, 
last place finish during the 2007 season, the Pirates had not had a winning 
record or made it to the playoffs since 1992, and finished 67–95 for their 
16th straight losing season. The season was the final of play-by-play announcer 
Lanny Frattare, whose 33 year tenure as Pirates' broadcaster was the longest 
in franchise history.[2][3] On November 5, 2007, John Russell was introduced 
as the Pirates manager, replacing Jim Tracy.[4] Team management cited three 
areas that the franchise hoped to improve: "refocused emphasis on fundamentals", 
holding players to a higher standard, and signing younger players.[5] The 
Pirates won their season opener against the Atlanta Braves, by the score 
of 12–11, in 12 innings.[6] The Pirates played their home opener against 
the division-rival Chicago Cubs on April 7, losing 10–8, also in 12 innings.[7] 
The Pirates started out the season with a 7–7 record after the first half-month; 
however, after a five-game losing streak they began to struggle, finishing 
out April with an 11–16 record. The Pirates losing continued as they dropped 
three of four to the Washington Nationals to begin May. The team fought 
back, winning six straight games—the most consecutive since 2004,[8] to 
bring their record within one victory of a .500 record. Throughout the 
remainder of May the team struggled, but never fell more than four games 
under .500. Throughout the early months of the season closer Matt Capps 
was perfect, getting saves in 15 consecutive opportunities. However, on 
June 10, Capps gave up a two-run home run to the Nationals, losing his 
first decision of the season.[9] In addition, Capps would blow saves in 
two of his next three appearances; however, he achieved his first win of 
the season after an extra-inning victory over the Baltimore Orioles.[10] 
Pittsburgh went 6–9 in interleague play,[11] including two wins against 
the New York Yankees who returned to Pittsburgh for the first time since 
the 1960 World Series.[12] On July 12, in a game against the St. Louis 
Cardinals, the Pirates came back to win a game that they trailed by six 
runs in the seventh inning. It was only the second time in the past 25 years 
that the Pirates won at home after scoring runs in the seventh, eighth, 
ninth, and extra innings.[13] The Pirates finished out the remainder of 
July with a 6–9 record—50–58 overall. On the final day of July, the Pirates 
made a deal with the Yankees to send outfielder Xavier Nady and pitcher 
Dámaso Marte in return for Jeff Karstens, Daniel McCutchen, Ross Ohlendorf 
and José Tábata.[14] Later in the day the team became involved in a three-team 
deal in which the Pirates sent Jason Bay to the Boston Red Sox in return 
for four players from the Los Angeles Dodgers.[15] The Pirates won seven 
of the first 18 games in August before dropping ten consecutive games to 
close out the month. Pittsburgh entered the final month of the season 21 games 
below the .500 mark. On September 7, the Pirates lost their 82nd game of 
the season, tying them with the Philadelphia Phillies as the only two franchises 
in professional sports history to have losing records in 16 consecutive 
seasons.[16][17] The Pirates concluded their season on September 28 with 
a victory against the San Diego Padres.[18] The team became the second 
in the Pirates' 122-year history to have no pitchers to win 10 games.[19] 
The performance of the pitchers lead the team to fire pitching coach Jeff 
Andrews after the season.[20] Infielders Coaches (October 29, 2007 – March
