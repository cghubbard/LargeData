As player As coach Mark Steven Kotsay (born December 2, 1975) is an American 
professional baseball coach and a former outfielder. In 2016, he served 
as the bench coach for the Oakland Athletics. During his active career, 
he appeared in 1,914 games for the San Diego Padres, Florida Marlins, Athletics, 
Atlanta Braves, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers. 
Born in Whittier, but raised in Santa Fe Springs California,[1] Kotsay 
played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton. Kotsay spent the summer 
of 1994 playing for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League. 
In 1995, Kotsay won the Golden Spikes Award and was the Most Outstanding 
Player of the College World Series, as CS-Fullerton won its third Series 
championship. In addition to being an outfielder, Kotsay was a closer in 
college; he pitched the final five outs to clinch his team's CWS title. 
Kotsay was a consensus choice as an All-American in 1995 and 1996. Kotsay 
was selected by the Florida Marlins as the 9th pick of the 1996 Major League 
Baseball Draft. Kotsay appeared in 14 games for the Florida Marlins in 
1997 before taking over as the team's center fielder in 1998. He was moved 
to right field after Gary Sheffield was traded, a position better suited 
for the strong throwing arm which Kotsay regularly showed off. As a rookie, 
he led all National League outfielders with 20 assists, and led them again 
in his second year with the same number. In 2000, he led all right fielders 
with 13 assists. At the plate, Kotsay was an average hitter during these 
years, hitting around .280 with occasional power and the occasional stolen 
base. Kotsay was traded in 2001, barely a week before Opening Day, to the 
San Diego Padres as part of a deal for Matt Clement and Eric Owens. Moved 
back to center field, Kotsay improved his hitting, but he recorded only 
four outfield assists. This can be largely attributed to the fact that 
few chose to run on Kotsay. Over the next two seasons, however, Kotsay 
was defensively back on form, leading all National League center fielders 
in that category. Kotsay hit .291 with a .807 OPS in 2001 and .292 with 
a .810 OPS in 2002. After his batting average slipped to .266 with a .726 
OPS in 2003, Kotsay was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Terrence Long 
and Ramón Hernández. With Oakland in 2004, Kotsay batted a career best 
.314 hitting second in the A's lineup. Displaying his customary strong 
arm afield, he led American League center fielders with 11 assists. On 
July 9, 2005, the Athletics announced that Kotsay and the team had come 
to terms on a three-year, $29 million contract extension.[2] The extension 
kept Kotsay under contract with the Athletics through the 2008 season and 
included a no-trade clause through the 2006 season. News of the contract 
extension ended speculation that Kotsay would be traded to a team in need 
of a starting center fielder, such as the New York Yankees. On Mother's 
Day, May 14, 2006, Kotsay was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished 
a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. He was one of a handful 
of players to hit a pink bat home run. The 2006 season marked Kotsay's 
first-ever appearance in a postseason game, as the Oakland Athletics clinched 
the 2006 AL West Division title. On October 4, he hit his first postseason 
home run against Minnesota Twins pitcher Dennys Reyes for a two run inside-the-park 
home run which scored Jason Kendall that put the Oakland A's ahead 4 to 
2, leading his team to win Game 2 of the ALDS. Kotsay underwent back surgery 
during spring training 2007, and missed the first two months of the 2007 
campaign. On January 14, 2008, after passing a physical, Kotsay was officially 
traded to the Atlanta Braves along with $5.3 million of his $7.3 million 
salary from the Athletics for Joey Devine and prospect Jamie Richmond. 
On August 14, 2008, Kotsay became the first Atlanta Brave to hit for the 
cycle since Albert Hall did it in 1987. He doubled to right in the 7th 
inning against Bob Howry of the Chicago Cubs. The double that completed 
the cycle was also Kotsay's 1,500th career hit. He would hit another single 
in the 9th inning to have his third career 5-hit game and first since 2005. 
However, despite the great effort, the Braves lost to the Cubs 11–7. On 
August 27, 2008, Kotsay was traded to the Boston Red Sox for minor league 
outfielder Luis Sumoza.[3] Kotsay quickly became the Red Sox's preferred 
first baseman after third baseman Mike Lowell was lost for the season due 
to injury and Kevin Youkilis was moved to third. Supplanting Sean Casey, 
he was the regular first baseman throughout the playoffs. He finished the 
Sox regular season batting .226/.286/.345 in 84 at-bats, and he batted 
.250/.250/.325 in the playoffs. Despite the poor totals, he was frequently 
referred to throughout 2008 as someone who hit baseballs hard right at 
someone, a hard-luck hitter. On January 15, 2009, Kotsay signed a one-year 
deal to return to the Red Sox. He underwent back surgery to remove a displaced 
disc in February 2009 but did not miss significant time.[4] On July 24, 
2009, Kotsay was designated for assignment by the Red Sox to free up a 
roster spot for newly acquired Adam LaRoche. On July 28, 2009, Kotsay was 
traded to Chicago White Sox for minor league outfielder Brian Anderson 
and cash considerations. On November 5, 2009, he was re-signed by the White 
Sox for a one-year, $1.5 million deal.[5] In 2010, Kotsay appeared in 107 
games, primarily as a designated hitter and first-baseman, hitting .239/.306/.376. 
On February 1, 2011, Kotsay agreed to sign a one-year contract with the 
Milwaukee Brewers. The contract was worth $800,000 plus $450,000 in incentives. 
Kotsay served as a utility player, mostly as a reserve outfield and pinch 
hitter. In 2011, he batted .270 with 3 home runs in 233 at-bats.[6] Through 
2011, he was fourth of all active major leaguers in career outfield assists, 
with 120.[7] On November 15, 2011, Kotsay signed a one-year deal, worth 
$1.25 million, with the San Diego Padres.[8] Kotsay began the year on the 
disabled list with a calf strain. He made his regular season debut on April 
17, 2012. He had another stint on the disabled list in May with a lower 
back strain.[9] On August 12, 2012, Kotsay signed a one-year extension 
to stay with the Padres through 2013 for $1.3 million. Kotsay was hitting 
.275/.333/.363 with 1 HR and 9 RBI in 55 games before the deal.[10] Kotsay 
made 26 starts in the field and had 51 appearances as a pinch hitter, batting 
.259/.314/.357 overall. His 13 pinch-hits tied him for second in the Major 
Leagues.[11] In 2013, Kotsay made 23 starts in the field at the corner 
outfield spots and first base but appeared in 104 games, mostly as a pinch 
hitter. He finished the season hitting .194/.253/.226 in 155 at-bats. On 
September 14, Kotsay announced he would retire after the 2013 season.[12] 
Kotsay was honored in a special ceremony in his final home game at Petco 
Park on September 26.[13] Kotsay joined the Padres front office in 2014 
as a special assistant.[14] On December 1, 2014, the Padres announced Kotsay 
as their new hitting coach, replacing Phil Plantier. On November 12, 2015, 
the Oakland Athletics named Mark Kotsay their new bench coach, replacing 
Mike Aldrete. Kotsay and his wife Jamie have three children. Kotsay attended 
Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe Springs, California where he excelled 
in football and baseball. Often referred to as the "Human Toaster" for 
his rocket fire arm and consistent toasting of runners at the plate from 
his domain in center field, as well as his "Don't mess with me" attitude. 
Kotsay is a devout Roman Catholic. His father, Steve Kotsay, is a retired
