As player As pitching coach Manabu Kitabeppu (北別府 学, Kitabeppu Manabu?), 
(July 12, 1957 in Soo, Kagoshima, Japan) is a Japanese former professional 
baseball pitcher, the first-round draft pick of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 
in 1975 and one of the most famous Japanese right-handed pitchers. He was 
known as the "Precision Machine" (精密機械, Seimutsu-Kikai?) because from his 
perfect control pitching, and his nickname was Pei-San (ペイさん). He struggled 
his first few seasons, then went 17-11 with a 3.58 ERA to make his first 
All-Star team in 1979. It was the first of five consecutive All-Star picks 
for Kitabeppu, who helped the team to a Japan Series title in 1980. In 
1982 Kitabeppu went 20-8 with a 2.43 ERA, easily his best year to that 
point. He led the Central League with 267.3 innings, won the most games 
on the mound and was fourth in ERA. He won his first Eiji Sawamura Award 
that season and also was named to the Best Nine. His streak of All-Star 
selections ended in 1984, though he continued to pitch well in '84 and 
'85. In 1986 Kitabeppu had his best season, going 18-4 with a 2.43 ERA. 
He led the circuit once again in victories, won his only ERA crown, led 
in complete games (17) and shutouts (4), won his only Gold Glove and in 
addition to the Best Nine and Sawamura, won his only MVP award as the Carp 
returned to the Japan Series, but failed to win. Kitabeppu again was an 
All-Star in '88 but posted losing records from '87 through '89, once with 
an ERA of 5.48. The former star allowed the most runs in 1988 (87) and 
the most homers (22). The next season he again surrendered the most home 
runs, also 22. In 1989 he was in the minor leagues for the first time in 
his career. He emerged resurgent from his trials and after a decent season 
in 1990, in 1991 he went 11-4 with a 3.38 ERA. He made his seventh All-Star 
team in 1992, with 14 wins in 22 decisions, and a 2.58 ERA. It was his 
lowest ERA and most victories since his MVP season of '86. The Carp made 
their third Japan Series of the Kitabeppu era, but lost to the Seibu Lions. 
Still just 34, Kitabeppu reached 200 career wins. It was his last good 
season – he would pitch 24 more games, going 9-9, with ERAs over 5 each 
time, before retiring. His career line with Hiroshima was 213-141 with 
a 3.67 ERA. Since Kitabeppu, only one pitcher in Nippon Pro Baseball (Kimiyasu 
Kudoh) has reached 200 victories. Kitabeppu ranks 17th all-time in wins, 
20th in innings (3,113), 26th in strikeouts (1,757), 9th in hits allowed 
(3,225) and 4th in homers surrendered (380, the Central League record). 
After retiring, Kitabeppu became an announcer and then the pitching coach
