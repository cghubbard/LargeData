The history of the Jews in Cincinnati occupies a prominent place in the 
development of Jewish secular and religious life in the United States. 
Cincinnati is not only the oldest Jewish community west of the Allegheny 
Mountains but has also been an institutional center of American Reform 
Judaism for more than a century. The American Israelite, the longest-running 
Jewish weekly still published in the country, opened for business in the 
city in 1854. The first identifiable Jew who settled in Cincinnati was 
Joseph Jonas, an English emigrant who arrived in the city via Philadelphia 
in 1817.[1] Jonas, a young man, decided to leave his home in Exeter, England, 
with the avowed intention of settling in Cincinnati. Friends in Philadelphia 
originally endeavored to dissuade him from going to a place so isolated 
from all association with his coreligionists. However, Jonas reassured 
them that he would succeed. For the first two years, he was the only Jew 
in the Midwestern town. In 1819, Jonas was joined by three others, Lewis 
Cohen of London, Barnet Levi of Liverpool, and Jonas Levy of Exeter. On 
the High Holidays in the autumn of 1819, these four men, together with 
David Israel Johnson of Brookville, Indiana, (a frontier trading-station) 
conducted the first Jewish service west of the Appalachians. Similar services 
were held the next three years. Newcomers continued to arrive, the early 
settlers being mostly Jews from England. The first Jewish child born in 
Cincinnati, Frederick A. Johnson (June 2, 1821), was the son of the above-mentioned 
David Israel Johnson and his wife, Eliza. This couple, also English, had 
removed to Cincinnati from Brookville, where they had first settled. The 
first couple to be married were Morris Symonds and Rebekah Hyams, whose 
wedding was celebrated on September 15, 1824. The first death in the community 
was that of Benjamin Leib (or Lape) in 1821. This man, who had not been 
known as a Jew, when he felt death to be approaching, asked that three 
of the Jewish residents of the town be called. He disclosed to them that 
he was a Jew. He had taken a Noachide spouse, and had reared his children 
as Noachides, but he begged to be buried as a Jew. There was no Jewish 
burial-ground in the town. The few Jews living in the city at once proceeded 
to acquire a small plot of ground to be used as a cemetery and buried him 
there. It is known as the Old Jewish Cemetery, Cincinnati, this plot, which 
was afterward enlarged, was used as the cemetery of the Jewish community 
till the year 1849, after the Cholera epidemic.[2] At present this cemetery 
(oldest west of the Alleghenies) is situated in the heart of the city, 
on Chestnut Street near Central Avenue, in the Old West End. There were 
not enough settlers to form a congregation until the year 1824, when the 
number of Jewish inhabitants of the town had reached about twenty. On January 
4 that year a preliminary meeting was held to consider the advisability 
of organizing a congregation. Two weeks later, on January 18, the Congregation 
B'ne Israel was formally organized; those in attendance were Solomon Buckingham, 
David I. Johnson, Joseph Jonas, Samuel Jonas, Jonas Levy, Morris Moses, 
Phineas Moses, Simeon Moses, Solomon Moses, and Morris Symonds. On January 
8, 1830, the Ohio General Assembly granted the congregation a charter whereby 
it was incorporated under the laws of the state. For twelve years, the 
congregation worshiped in a room rented for the purpose; but, during all 
this time, the small congregation was exerting itself to secure a permanent 
home. Appeals were made to the Jewish congregations in various parts of 
the country. Philadelphia, Charleston, and New Orleans lent their assistance. 
Contributions were even received from Portsmouth, England, whence a number 
of Cincinnatians had emigrated, and from Barbados in the West Indies. On 
June 11, 1835, the cornerstone of the first synagogue was laid; and on 
September 9, 1836, the synagogue was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies. 
The members of the congregation had conducted the services up to this time. 
The first official reader was Joseph Samuels. He served a very short time, 
and was succeeded by Henry Harris, who was followed in 1838 by Hart Judah. 
The first benevolent association was organized in 1838 with Phineas Moses 
as president: its object was to assist needy coreligionists. The first 
religious school was established in 1842, Mrs. Louisa Symonds becoming 
its first superintendent. This school was short-lived. In 1845, a Talmud 
Torah school was established, which gave way the following year to the 
Hebrew Institute, established by James K. Gutheim. This also flourished 
but a short time; when Gutheim departed for New Orleans, the career of 
the institute closed. During the 1830s, quite a number of German Jews arrived 
in the city. On September 19, 1841, the B'ne Yeshurun congregation was 
organized by the Germans, and was incorporated under the laws of the state 
February 28, 1842. The first reader was Simon Bamberger. In 1847, James 
K. Gutheim was elected lecturer and reader of the congregation. He served 
till 1848, and was succeeded by H. A. Henry and A. Rosenfeld. In April 
1854, Isaac Mayer Wise became the first rabbi of the B'ne Yeshurun congregation. 
In that same year, Wise’s brother-in-law, Edward Bloch, followed Wise to 
Cincinnati, and eventually founded a printing company that evolved into 
Bloch Publishing Company, the oldest Jewish publishing company in the U.S., 
which remained in Cincinnati until it moved to New York City in 1901.[3] 
In 1866, the congregation built the architecturally notable Plum Street 
Temple, now known as the Isaac M. Wise Temple. The B'ne Israel congregation 
hired Max Lilienthal in June 1855. These leadership appointments gave the 
Jewish community of Cincinnati a commanding position. Owing to their efforts, 
Cincinnati became a center of Jewish life in America and the seat of a 
number of organizations that were national in scope. The institutions of 
Reform Judaism, namely, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC, 
1873), the Hebrew Union College (HUC, 1875), the Hebrew Sabbath-School 
Union (1886), and the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR, 1889) 
were all founded in Cincinnati. In 1951, the UAHC (now called the Union 
for Reform Judaism) moved its headquarters to the demographic center of 
American Jewry in New York City [4] Dr. Lilienthal died in office April 
5, 1882. He was succeeded as rabbi of the Congregation B'ne Israel by Raphael 
Benjamin, who served till November 1888, when David Philipson, took charge 
of the congregation. Dr. Wise served as rabbi of the B'ne Yeshurun congregation 
till the day of his death, March 26, 1900; being succeeded by his associate, 
Dr. Louis Grossman. Dr. Grossman had been preceded as associate rabbi by 
Rabbi Charles S. Levi, who served from September 1889 to September 1898. 
The other congregations of the city, which continued to adhere to Orthodoxy, 
were the Adath Israel, organized in 1847; the Ahabath Achim, organized 
in 1848; and the Sherith Israel, organized in 1855. There were also a number 
of smaller congregations. Each of these congregations conducted its own 
religious school, and there were also two free religious schools; one holding 
its sessions in the schoolrooms of the Mound Street Temple (B'ne Israel), 
and the other, conducted under the auspices of the local branch of the 
Council of Jewish Women, meeting at the Jewish Settlement. One of these 
congregations enjoys the distinction of having petitioned overseas halakhic 
authority Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin regarding the appropriate manner 
in which to inaugurate a Torah scroll in the synagogue. [R. Berlin's response 
is published in his She'elot Uteshuvot Meshiv Davar, I, no. 16, and possesses 
practical halakhic ramifications until today, as explained by Rabbi J. 
David Bleich in the latter's Contemporary Halakhic Problems V, p. 386.] 
A large Talmud Torah school was conducted by the Talmud Torah Association 
on Barr Street. Night classes for various English and industrial branches 
of study were a feature of the work of the Jewish Settlement. The Jewish 
Kitchen Garden Association conducted a large school for girls in the building 
of the United Jewish Charities every Sunday morning, where instruction 
is given in dressmaking, millinery, housekeeping, cooking, stenography, 
typewriting, and allied subjects. An industrial school for girls was conducted 
during the summer months in the vestry-rooms of the Plum street temple 
(B'ne Yeshurun), and one for boys during the school year in the Ohio Mechanics 
Institute building. There was a training-school for nurses in connection 
with the Jewish Hospital. The Jewish charities of Cincinnati were exceptionally 
well organized. All the relief and educational agencies joined their forces 
in April 1896, and formed the United Jewish Charities. This body comprised 
the following federated societies: Hebrew General Relief Association, Jewish 
Ladies’ Sewing Society, Jewish Foster Home, Jewish Kitchen Garden Association, 
Boys’ Industrial School, Girls’ Industrial School, and Society for the 
Relief of Jewish Sick Poor. The United Charities also granted an annual 
subvention to the Denver Hospital for Consumptives and to the local Jewish 
Settlement Association. The seat of the National Jewish Charities is also 
in Cincinnati, where the national organization was called into being in 
May 1899. Besides the United Jewish Charities, Cincinnati supported the 
Jewish Hospital and the Home for the Jewish Aged and Infirm, and was one 
of the largest contributors to the Jewish Orphan Asylum at Cleveland. The 
Jews of Cincinnati participated actively in civic life and filled many 
local positions of trust, as well as state, judicial, and governmental 
offices. Henry Mack, Charles Fleischmann, James Brown, and Alfred M. Cohen 
were elected members of the State Senate, and Joseph Jonas, Jacob Wolf, 
Daniel Wolf, and Harry M. Hoffheimer served in the State House of Representatives. 
Jacob Shroder was judge of the court of common pleas for a number of years, 
and Frederick S. Spiegel held the same position as of 1902. Julius Fleischmann 
was the mayor of the city. Nathaniel Newburgh was appointed appraiser of 
merchandise by President Cleveland during his first administration, and 
Bernhard Bettmann was collector of internal revenue since 1897. Lewis S. 
Rosenstiel, a grandson of Frederick A. Johnson—the first Jew born in the 
city, was the founder and chairman of Schenley Industries and was the nation’s 
largest distiller for half of the twentieth-century. In 1900, the estimated 
Jewish population of the city stood around 15,000, in a total population 
of 325,902.[citation needed] By 2008, the estimated Jewish population of 
the Cincinnati metropolitan area stood around 27,000.[5] The first Jewish 
newspaper published in Cincinnati was the English-language The Israelite, 
established 1854. It was founded by Rabbi Wise and (after its initial issues, 
which were published by Charles F. Schmidt), it began to be published by 
Edward Bloch with the issue of July 27, 1855. Rabbi Wise also founded (and 
Bloch published) the German-language Die Deborah in 1855. The Israelite 
was renamed The American Israelite in 1874. Rabbi Wise’s son Leo Wise took 
over as its publisher from 1883–1884, and then he did so again, permanently, 
in 1888. The American Israelite still exists and is said to be the longest-running 
Jewish newspaper in the United States.[3] Another newspaper, The Sabbath 
Visitor, established 1874, was discontinued in 1892. The B. Manischewitz 
Company, LLC was founded by Rabbi Dov Behr Manischewitz, in Cincinnati 
in 1888. Their original product, the square matzah revolutionized matzoh 
making, previously the process used was to hand roll the matzoh and trim 
the edges. In the late 1800s Jewish Russian immigrant Izzy Kadetz settled 
in Cincinnati, and offered his flair for cooking at the renowned St. Nicolas 
Hotel. A Cincinnati culinary institution, Izzy's Deli opened in 1901 as
