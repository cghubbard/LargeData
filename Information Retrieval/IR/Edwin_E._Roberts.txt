Edwin Ewing Roberts (December 12, 1870 â€“ December 11, 1933) was a United 
States Representative from Nevada. He was born in Pleasant Grove, Sutter 
County, California. He attended the public schools and graduated from the 
State normal school in San Jose, California, in 1891. He taught school 
at Hollister, California, 1891-1897 and at Empire, Nevada, 1897-1899. He 
then studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1899 and commenced practice 
in Carson City, Nevada and also engaged in the newspaper publishing business. 
He was district attorney of Ormsby County from 1900 to 1910. He was elected 
as a Republican to the 62nd and the three succeeding Congresses. On April 
5, 1917 he voted against declaring war on Germany. He did not seek renomination 
in 1918, but was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate, 
losing to Charles B. Henderson by a vote of 12,197 to 8.053. After leaving 
Congress Roberts was elected mayor of Reno in 1923 and held that office 
until his death. His son-in-law was Walter Johnson, one of the greatest 
pitchers in the history of baseball. Johnson would himself run for congress 
as a Republican in 1940, but lost in a close election. Johnson married 
Roberts' only daughter, Hazel, in the congressman's Washington home on 
June 24, 1914. The chaplain of the senate presided over the ceremony.[1]
