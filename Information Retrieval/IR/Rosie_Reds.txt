The Rosie Reds, also known as Rosie Reds, Inc. is a philanthropic and social 
organization focused around the Cincinnati Reds.[1][2] The organization 
was founded by a group of local Cincinnati women in June 1964 in response 
to the Reds' then-owner Bill DeWitt's proposal to move the team to San 
Diego.[3] The group was formed by local residents Jeanette Heinze, Marge 
Zimmer, Ketty Kennedy, and Kate McIntyre, who had initially taken part 
in a committee formed by the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce to 
discuss ways to prevent the team moving.[4] The women decided that one 
of the ways to prevent the move was to show support for the team by showing 
up for games, both at home and on the road, which ended up being influential 
in the decision to keep the team in Cincinnati.[3] Management for the Cincinnati 
Reds responded to the Rosie Reds by donating tickets to club members, sending 
speakers to club events, and by promoting the Rosie Reds during games.[4] 
This boosted interest in membership and in 1971, during the days of The 
Big Red Machine, many men began requesting to join the Rosie Reds.[3][5] 
In 2004 Tom Juengling became the president of the Rosie Reds, a position 
that had traditionally been held by a female member. Juengling held the 
position until 2006.[4] In 2014 the Rosie Reds were honored with an exhibit 
in the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum.[3] The name "Rosie" is 
an acronym for "Rooters Organized to Stimulate Interest and Enthusiasm 
in the Cincinnati Reds".[6] The organization annually awards baseball endowments 
or scholarships, along with an award of $2,500 to the Powel Crosley Junior 
- Kid Glove Association.[4] The Rosie Reds also support the Annual Kid 
Glove games held at Great American Ball Park. The organization's mascot, 
named Rosie Reds, is a female anthropomorphic baseball wearing a Cincinnati
