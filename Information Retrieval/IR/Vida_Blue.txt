Vida Rochelle Blue Jr. (born July 28, 1949) is a former Major League Baseball 
left-handed pitcher. During a 17-year career, he pitched for the Oakland 
Athletics (1969–77), San Francisco Giants (1978–81; 1985–86), and Kansas 
City Royals (1982–83). He won the American League Cy Young Award and Most 
Valuable Player Award in 1971. He is a six-time All-Star, and is the first 
of only four pitchers in major league history to start the All-Star Game 
for both the American League (1971) and the National League (1978); Roger 
Clemens, Randy Johnson and Roy Halladay later duplicated the feat.[1] Blue, 
the oldest of six children, was born and raised in Mansfield in DeSoto 
Parish in northwestern Louisiana. His father worked as a laborer in an 
iron foundry. In high school, Blue pitched for the baseball team and also 
was the quarterback for the football team. In his senior year, he threw 
for 3,400 yards and completed 35 touchdown passes while rushing for 1,600 
yards in football. Also in his senior year, Blue threw a no-hitter. In 
seven innings pitched one game, Blue had 21 strikeouts.[2] He received 
several offers to play college football, but after his father died suddenly 
Blue signed a contract with the Oakland A's.[3] Blue benefited from coverage 
by Jerry Byrd of the since defunct Shreveport Journal, one of the first 
white sportswriters to report on black athletes in the middle 1960s.[4] 
Unlike many southpaws, Blue was a power pitcher who worked fast and pounded 
the strike zone. He threw an occasional curveball to keep hitters off balance 
and an above average change-up, but his signature pitch was a blistering 
fastball that could dial up to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h).[5] In The 
Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers, all-time hits leader Pete Rose stated that 
Blue "threw as hard as anyone" he had ever faced,[6] and baseball historian 
Bill James cited Blue as the hardest-throwing lefty, and the second hardest 
thrower of his era, behind only Nolan Ryan.[7] In 1970, after spending 
the season in the minor leagues with the Iowa Oaks of the American Association, 
Blue was called up in September, making two starts that provided a glimpse 
of what was to come. On September 11, he shut out the Kansas City Royals 
3–0, giving up only one hit, to Pat Kelly in the eighth inning. Ten days 
later, he no-hit the Minnesota Twins, 6–0, at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, 
the lone baserunner coming on Harmon Killebrew's fourth-inning walk.[8][9] 
Blue had a 24–8 record in 1971, winning both the Cy Young and MVP awards. 
He was the first Athletic to win the latter award since another pitcher, 
Bobby Shantz, in 1952 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics.[10][11][12][13] 
He also led the American League in complete games (24), shutouts (8) and 
earned run average (1.82).[14] That season, the Athletics won the American 
League West title for the franchise's first postseason berth since the 
Philadelphia Athletics in the 1931 World Series. He got off to a blistering 
start, going 10-1 when he linked up with Boston's Sonny Siebert, who was 
9-0, in a dramatic May matchup in Boston. The game was won by Siebert and 
the Red Sox 4-3, and remains what is considered one of the most dramatic 
games in Fenway Park history. He was the youngest American League player 
to win the MVP Award in the 20th century.[15] He was the starting pitcher 
for the American League in the 1971 All-Star Game, and for the National 
League in the 1978 All-Star Game. In 1971 he became the only player ever 
to be a starting pitcher in the league opener (against the Washington Senators), 
the All-Star Game and the playoff opener (against the Baltimore Orioles) 
in the same season. In 1971, he was on the covers of Sports Illustrated 
and Time magazine.[16] In 1972, his success in baseball led Blue to a small 
role in the film Black Gunn, starring Jim Brown. After Blue's breakthrough 
season in 1971, he and Athletics owner Charlie Finley clashed over his 
salary. Blue held out, missing much of the year, and ended up with a 6–10 
record. He didn't make the Athletics' post-season starting rotation, instead 
pitching mainly in relief. Against the Cincinnati Reds in the 1972 World 
Series he made four appearances, including a save in Game 1, a blown save 
in Game 4, and a loss in a spot-starting role in Game 6. Blue returned 
to form to win 20 games in 1973, 17 games in 1974, and 22 games in 1975, 
as an integral member of the Oakland Athletics' five straight American 
League Western Division pennants from 1971 to 1975, and three consecutive 
World Championships in 1972, 1973, and 1974. Perhaps his finest postseason 
performances were four innings of shutout relief work against the Detroit 
Tigers to save Game 5 of the 1972 American League Championship Series and 
a complete-game 1-0 shutout against the Orioles in Game 3 of the 1974 ALCS. 
On September 28, 1975, Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad and Rollie Fingers 
combined to no-hit the California Angels 5-0. The no-hitter is, as of 2014, 
one of only four to be pitched on the final day of a regular season, the 
others being Mike Witt's perfect game in 1984, Henderson Álvarez's no-hitter 
in 2013, and Jordan Zimmermann's no-hitter on September 28, 2014. Blue 
also became the first no-hit pitcher to also pitch in a combined no-hitter; 
he has since been joined by Chicago White Sox hurlers John 'Blue Moon' 
Odom and Francisco Barrios, the California Angels' Mark Langston and Mike 
Witt, the Atlanta Braves' Kent Mercker, Mark Wohlers, and Alejandro Peña, 
and Kevin Millwood and Cole Hamels of the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1976, 
baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn vetoed an attempt by Oakland A's owner 
Charlie Finley to sell Blue to the New York Yankees, and in 1978, Kuhn 
cancelled a proposed trade of Blue to the Cincinnati Reds. In both instances, 
Kuhn said the trades would be bad for baseball because they would benefit 
already powerful teams without making them give up any significant talent 
in return. At the end of the 1976 season, nearly the entire A's roster 
of star players from Oakland's championship teams left with baseball's 
new free agency, or were traded off by Finley, leaving Blue, who was still 
under contract with Oakland, to mentor a new team of primarily rookies 
and other young players. In 1978, Blue was traded to the San Francisco 
Giants. In 1978, Blue won 18 games as he led the Giants to 89 wins and 
a third-place finish in the National League West Division, which was won 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers. His great year was rewarded as he won the Sporting 
News National League Pitcher of the Year. He, along with Chili Davis, were 
the last players before Ichiro Suzuki to wear their given name on the back 
of their uniforms instead of their surname, both having done so with the 
Giants. Blue battled drug addiction over the course of his career. After 
the 1983 season, he and former teammates Willie Wilson, Jerry Martin and 
Willie Aikens pleaded guilty to attempting to purchase cocaine. In 1985, 
he testified in the Pittsburgh drug trials. His troubles with substance 
abuse seem to haunt this former great pitcher, as he faced multiple DUI 
charges in 2005.[17] Blue also made a name and career after baseball for 
himself in the San Francisco Bay Area by donating his time to many charitable 
causes, mostly promoting baseball in the inner city. In 1971, Blue accompanied 
Bob Hope on his USO Christmas tour of Vietnam and other military installations. 
Vida currently lives in San Francisco and is active in promoting the sport 
of baseball. He is currently a baseball analyst for Comcast SportsNet Bay 
Area, the TV home of the San Francisco Giants. Pitching Blue remains active, 
working for numerous charitable causes including Safeway All Stars Challenge 
Sports,[18] automobile donations,[19] celebrity golf tournaments,[20] and
