The 1966 Chicago Cubs season was the 95th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 91st in the National League and the 51st at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished tenth and last in the National League with a record of 59â€“103, 
36 games behind the NL Champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Cubs would not 
lose 100 or more games in a season for another 46 seasons. One of the defining 
trades in Cubs history occurred on April 21, when the Cubs acquired future 
Cy Young Award winner Ferguson Jenkins in a trade with the Philadelphia 
Phillies. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: G = Games played; AB =
