Donald Charles "Jake" Mauer (born December 20, 1978) is a former Minor 
League Baseball player, and former NCAA Division III baseball standout. 
He is currently the manager of the Cedar Rapids Kernels. As senior in 2001, 
he set the University of St. Thomas season record for hits with 83, and 
is the school's career leader in hits (243), runs (181) & games (187). 
He was inducted into the St. Thomas Athletic Hall of Fame in 2007. Mauer 
was selected by the Minnesota Twins in the 23rd round of the 2001 Major 
League Baseball Draft (677 overall), the same draft that his younger brother 
and current Twins first baseman, Joe Mauer, was selected number one overall.[1] 
In five seasons in the Twins' farm system, Mauer compiled a .256 batting 
average with 82 runs batted in and no home runs. After an elbow injury 
forced Mauer to retire following the 2005 season, he accepted a job as 
a Minor League coach with the Twins, and in 2008, was promoted to manager 
of the Gulf Coast League Twins. In Mauer's two seasons at the helm, the 
GCL Twins went 69-42, finishing in second and first, respectively, in the 
Gulf Coast League's Southern division. On October 21, 2009, he was named 
manager of the Fort Myers Miracle following Jeff Smith's promotion to the 
double A New Britain Rock Cats.[2] Mauer's success in the Gulf Coast League 
did not carry over to the Florida State League, as he led the team to a 
64-74 record his first season at the helm, its worst record since finishing 
61-74 in 2004. Following the Twins' agreement to add the Cedar Rapids Kernels 
as the team's Low-A affiliate in November 2012, Mauer was named the team's 
manager.[3] The Mauers have a third brother, Billy, who signed with the 
Twins as an undrafted free agent in 2003, and pitched in the organization 
for three seasons before chronic shoulder problems forced him to retire 
from the game. He ended his minor league career with a 3-4 record and 3.66 
earned run average in 43 games.[4] Their cousin is NBA referee Ken Mauer. 
Jake resides in Shoreview, Minnesota with his wife, Rachel, and daughter,
