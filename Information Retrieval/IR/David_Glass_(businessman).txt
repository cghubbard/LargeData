David Dayne Glass (born September 2, 1935)[1] is the former President and 
Chief Executive Officer of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. He is currently the owner 
and Chief Executive Officer of the Kansas City Royals. David Glass joined 
the company in 1976. In his position as Executive Vice President of Finance 
for Wal-Mart Stores, he administered the overall financial and accounting 
responsibilities of the company prior to his appointment as Vice Chairman 
and Chief Financial Officer. He served in that role until 1984 when he 
was named President and Wal-Mart’s Chief Operating Officer. Along with 
Rob Walton, in 1985 Glass managed development of Retail Link program, Walmart's 
proprietary trend-forecasting software.[2] In 1988 he was named Wal-Mart’s 
Chief Executive Officer, stepping down from the position in January 2000. 
Glass was active in the company’s growth from 123 stores in 1976 to its 
more than 4,000 nationally and internationally in 2005. Glass was named 
Retailer of the Year by members of the retail industry in 1986 and 1991 
and was inducted into the Retail Hall of Fame in August 2000. Glass has 
been a member of the Board of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. since 1977. Glass became 
the interim CEO and chairman of the Royals on September 23, 1993, following 
the death of the founding owner, Ewing Kauffman.[3] Under Glass' leadership, 
the board cut the payroll from $41 million to $19 million. During the Major 
League Baseball strike of 1994-1995, Glass opposed any settlement with 
the players' union without a salary cap, and supported the use of strike 
breaking "replacement" players, despite a court ruling that the use of 
replacement players violated federal labor law.[4] On April 18, 2000, Glass 
became sole owner of the Royals, purchasing the organization from the Kauffman 
estate for $96 million.[3] The Royals board approved his offer despite 
a competing bid of $120 million by Miles Prentice.[4] However, MLB rejected 
Prentice's offer because he didn't have enough net worth to withstand substantial 
losses. With none of the area's wealthy families willing to even consider 
making a bid for the Royals—or any other existing or prospective professional 
team in Kansas City—Glass was the only credible bidder who was interested 
in keeping the team in town.[5] An original stipulation of the sale was 
that any profits from Glass' sale of the Royals must go to charity, but 
that clause has since expired.[6] For much of his tenure as owner, Glass 
was criticized for bringing the same cost-cutting management style he used 
at Wal-Mart to the Royals. While he garnered large profits, the Royals 
were barely competitive for most of the early part of the new millennium.[4] 
Glass' management is cited for transforming the Royals from a perennial 
playoff contender in the 1970s and 1980s, to one of the worst teams in 
Major League Baseball during the 1990s and early 2000s.[4][7] Glass created 
a controversy on 9 June 2006 by revoking the press credentials of two reporters 
who had earlier asked pointed questions to Royals management.[8] The harsh 
move to avoid criticism infuriated many within the press and led to a backlash 
of articles that extended far beyond the Kansas City sports community.[9] 
The Royals have had four winning seasons during his ownership: 2003, 2013, 
2014 and 2015. In 2014, the Royals won 89 games and reached the 2014 Major 
League Baseball Playoffs for the first time in 29 years. They eventually 
advanced to the World Series for the first time since 1985.[10] The Royals 
would finish the following year with the best regular-season record in 
the American League, and a second consecutive victory in its championship 
series.[11] He would help lead the Royals to their second World Series 
title in franchise history. The son of Marvin Glass and Myrtle Van Winkle, 
Glass was born on a farm in Oregon County, Missouri and grew up in Mountain 
View, Missouri. He then graduated from Missouri State University in Springfield, 
Missouri.[1] Glass and his wife, Ruth, are the parents of three children, 
Dan, Don and Dayna, all of whom serve on the Royals' Board of Directors.
