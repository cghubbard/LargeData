As player As coach As manager Gene William Lamont (born December 25, 1946) 
is a former catcher and manager in Major League Baseball who managed the 
Chicago White Sox (1992–1995) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1997–2000). He batted 
left-handed and threw right-handed. Lamont is currently the bench coach 
for the Detroit Tigers. Lamont was a Chicago Cubs fan all his life, growing 
up in Kirkland, Illinois and attending Western Illinois University. He 
was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 1st round, as the 13th pick, 
of the 1965 amateur draft, and came up with them as a September call-up 
in 1970, when he had 13 hits in 44 at bats. The following year, he had 
only 15 at-bats and only 1 hit. In his biggest year, he had 92 at-bats, 
playing as a backup to Tigers catcher Jerry Moses. After 1975, his major 
league career, spent entirely with the Tigers, was over. He bounced around 
in the minors, on triple-A Evansville (with such players as Tom Brookens 
and Jerry Manuel) before stopping. He ended with a lifetime batting average 
of .233, with 4 home runs and 14 RBI in 87 games played. He had 37 hits 
in 159 at-bats, and stole 1 base. The highlight of his time as a player 
had been a home run in his first at bat of his career off the Boston Red 
Sox' Cal Koonce. However, his career would go on as a manager, beginning 
soon in 1977 with the Kansas City Royals as a manager, managing their single-A 
Fort Myers team for two years. After that, he guided double-A Jacksonville 
Suns to a championship in 1982 and again in 1983, being named Southern 
League Manager of the Year in the former. Finally after two seasons with 
the triple-A Omaha Royals in the minors, he had worked his way up to the 
majors, serving as a third base coach for Jim Leyland's 1986 Pirates team. 
By the early '90s, with the Pirates emergence as a contender, Lamont was 
being considered by some teams for a managing job. In 1992, Jeff Torborg 
left the White Sox to take the managing job with the New York Mets, and 
Lamont was named manager of Chicago. That year, the Sox did well, finishing 
86–76, 3rd in the American League's Western Division. However, the following 
year the White Sox finished 94-68 under Lamont and were first in the AL 
West for the first time since they won 99 games in 1983 under Tony La Russa. 
His team consisted of such stars as Frank Thomas, Robin Ventura, Ellis 
Burks, Jack McDowell, Alex Fernandez, Jason Bere, and Wilson Álvarez. Lamont 
took home the AL Manager of the Year award that year, and the team lost 
in the American League Championship Series to the soon-to-be champs, the 
Toronto Blue Jays. In 1994, a baseball strike took place. When it began, 
the White Sox had the best record in the division; but the team did not 
fare as well the following year, starting out with an 11–20 record before 
Lamont was fired and replaced by Terry Bevington. Lamont returned to the 
Pirates and began coaching again, before Leyland left in 1997, giving Lamont 
the job of manager once again. He was the first Pirates manager to have 
been a catcher during his playing career since Billy Meyer (1948–1952). 
Amazingly, in his first year Lamont finished second with a young, inexperienced 
team that was widely predicted to finish last. His team often upset many 
NL teams vying for playoff spots. He came in 2nd place in the manager of 
the year voting behind Dusty Baker of the San Francisco Giants. There was 
no continued success for the Pirates though, finishing in last place in 
the Central in 1998. After the terrible 2000 season, Lamont was fired and 
replaced by Lloyd McClendon. He has a career record of 553–562, barely 
below .500 at .496, despite the many bad Pirates seasons. His all-time 
record in Chicago was 258–210, and he was 295–352 in Pittsburgh. Lamont 
had two first-place finishes, including the strike shortened year. Lamont 
returned to coaching, with the Red Sox and the Astros. He has been a coach 
with the Tigers since the 2006 season.[1] On November 12, 2011, Lamont 
was interviewed for the manager position for the Boston Red Sox after the 
Red Sox declined to exercise Terry Francona's 2012 option for manager. 
Lamont joined Torey Lovullo, Sandy Alomar, Jr., Pete Mackanin, and Dale 
Sveum vying for the managerial position.[1][2] As of November 27, only 
Lamont and Bobby Valentine were still in contention for the position. On 
November 29, it was reported that Valentine would be the new Red Sox manager. 
In 2013, Lamont was moved to the dugout as the bench coach and was replaced
