Jennie Lynn Finch (born September 3, 1980[1]) is an American, former collegiate 
All-American, right-handed softball pitcher and first baseman originally 
from La Mirada, California. She pitched for the Arizona Wildcats, the USA 
national softball team[2] and the Chicago Bandits.[3] Finch won the 2001 
Women's College World Series and helped lead Team USA to the gold medal 
at the 2004 Summer Olympics[4] and a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[2] 
Time magazine described her as the most famous softball player in history.[2] 
In 2010, Finch retired from softball to focus on her family. In August 
2011, she started work as a color analyst for ESPN doing National Pro Fastpitch 
and college softball games.[5][6] Finch is ranked in several categories 
for both the Wildcats in the Pac-12 and the NCAA Division I. Finch was 
born in La Mirada, California. Finch has two older brothers, Shane and 
Landon. She began playing softball at age five[7] and pitching at age eight.[8] 
Her father was her first pitching coach. Growing up, Finch was a bat girl 
for the University of California, Los Angeles.[9] At La Mirada High School, 
Finch lettered four times in softball and twice each in basketball and 
volleyball.[10] As a senior, she was the captain of all three sports.[1] 
As a sophomore, she was an All-California Interscholastic Federation Division 
II choice in softball[10] and All-Suburban League selection.[10] In 2016, 
La Mirada retired her jersey number—the school's first for a softball player.[11] 
Finch majored in communications.[12] Finch began her career on February 
5, 1999, winning a run-rule game against the UIC Flames.[13] She achieved 
a career high in doubles and threw her first career no-hitter during the 
NCAA tournament on May 21 vs. the Texas State Bobcats.[14] Though they 
made the World Series, Finch and the Wildcats were eventually eliminated 
by the DePaul Blue Demons on May 29.[15] For her sophomore year, Finch 
was named a 2000 National Fastpitch Coaches Association First Team All-American 
and First Team All-Pac-10.[16][17][18] She also threw three no-hitters 
and led the Wildcats in home runs and slugging percentage and achieved 
a career best in hits and batting average. Finch began the year with a 
21 consecutive game win streak; in a 10–2 run-rule over the Southern Miss 
Golden Eagles on February 6 to a shutout win over Cal State Northridge 
Matadors on April 13.[19] After suffering her only losses in back-to-back 
games, Finch finished the year 8–0 starting a new streak with an April 
29 victory vs. the Oregon Ducks that would span the next two seasons.[20] 
Finch's 23rd and 29th wins were over the No. 1 Washington Huskies, the 
latter began a 35 scoreless inning streak, after allowing runs in the fourth 
inning she shutout the team the rest of the way for a 4–2 margin on May 
27.[21][22] As a junior in 2001, Finch was again named First Team for the 
NFCA and the conference, adding the Pitcher of The Year award.[23][24][25] 
She would also hoist the Honda Sports Award for Softball Player of the 
Year.[26] Finch's season ERA, wins and shutouts were and still do rank 
top 10 for the school. Along with a no-hitter and career highs in WHIP 
and RBIs, Finch opened the season with 31 consecutive scoreless innings 
spanning 6 wins that combined with the innings from her last game in 2000, 
was a career best 35 before being snapped in the second inning by a leadoff 
home run vs. McNeese State Cowgirls on February 24.[27] On March 30, Finch 
hit two home runs and a double in an 11–1 romp of the Oregon Ducks to drive 
in a career best 9 RBIs, which tied her third all-time in the NCAA for 
a single game.[28] On April 8, Finch won her third game over a No. 1 team, 
the UCLA Bruins.[29] Finch and the Wildcats were the No. 1 seed in the 
NCAA tournament and made it to the World Series for a third straight year 
with Finch in the circle. She recorded victories over the California Golden 
Bears and the Oklahoma Sooners to reach the finals. In a 1–0 shutout of 
the UCLA Bruins, Finch set an NCAA record with a perfect season capped 
with the National Championship. Finch also had a hit in the game and was 
named MVP for the series.[30] The victory extended her win streak to 40 
consecutive games along with the 8 to end the 2000 season. For a final 
season, Finch was named 2002 First Team for the NFCA and the Pac-10 conference 
as well as Pitcher of The Year and Honda Player of The Year.[31][32][33] 
Finch tossed three no-hitters and broke the season strikeouts record, while 
her wins and shutouts were and remain top-10 school records. Beginning 
on February 9 vs. the Cal State Fullerton Titans, Finch matched her own 
record of 35 consecutive scoreless innings that was broken in a 13–1 mercy 
win over the Northern Iowa Panthers on February 23.[34][35] Finch set several 
records in single games beginning with a new NCAA record by winning her 
51st consecutive game.[36] A near-capacity crowd filled Rita Hillenbrand 
Memorial Stadium and chants of "Jennie" echoed throughout the crowd in 
the 6–0 victory over Cal State Northridge.[36] Finch said, "It's significant 
and it's nice. But it doesn't even come close to the team goal of winning 
a national championship."[36] For one of her no-hitters, Finch posted her 
100th career victory over the Notre Dame Fighting Irish on March 14.[37] 
Later on March 24, she struck out 15 of the ULL Ragin' Cajuns for a career 
best in regulation; the Wildcats won, 7–2.[38] On April 17, Finch won a 
1–0 shutout in 9-innings and struck out 19 Oklahoma Sooners to tie a then 
school record.[39] The Wildcat then beat the No. 1 UCLA Bruins by one run 
on April 6 to start the year 20–0 and set an NCAA record with 60 straight 
wins dating back to the 2000 season, including four wins over the No. 1 
ranked team.[40] To open a return trip to the WCWS as defending champion, 
Finch shutout the Nebraska Cornhuskers and ended the game with her 1,000th 
career strikeout.[41] In the semifinals of the World Series, Finch hit 
her 50th career home run off Leslie Malerich to score the winning run and 
help herself beat the FSU Seminoles in 11-innings.[42] The Wildcats suffered 
a 6–0 loss in the championship to the California Golden Bears. Finch left 
the program the career leader in strikeouts, shutouts, innings pitched 
and tied for no-hitters (8), while ranking in the top-10 in most other 
pitching categories. She also was top-10 in home runs, RBIs and walks; 
she remains top-10 in several pitching and the walks all-time lists.[43] 
She currently is 6th and 7th in winning percentage (0.881%) for a career 
in the now-named Pac-12 and the NCAA.[44][45] Her jersey number, 27 (the 
date of her parents' first date),[46] was retired by the University of 
Arizona in a pre-game ceremony at Hillenbrand Stadium on May 9, 2003.[47][not 
in citation given] Finch had a 2–0 win–loss record in the 2004 Athens Summer 
Olympics, striking out 13 batters in eight innings while giving up only 
one hit, one walk and no runs.[48] Her pitching helped lead the American 
team to the gold medal.[46] The U.S.A. team started its bid for a fourth 
straight gold medal at the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing with Finch pitching 
four no-hit innings in an 11–0 victory over Venezuela.[49] Finch then pitched 
5 shutout innings in a 7–0 victory over Chinese Taipei[50] and two more 
shut out innings in a 9–0 victory over China.[50] However, the U.S. lost 
3–1 to Japan in the final game and came home with a silver medal.[51] After 
the loss, Finch said, "I feel like we let USA softball down. Many women 
have worn this uniform, and accepted nothing but gold."[51] Along with 
baseball, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided in 2005 to 
drop softball from the Olympics, making 2008 possibly the last time the 
sport is played in the Olympics.[52] A crusader for softball's reinstatement 
for the 2016 Olympics, Finch said that "[i]t deserves to be an Olympic 
sport."[53] After the final game, Finch said: Over 140 countries play this 
game. ... you don't have to be six-four. You don't have to be 200 pounds. 
We have all different shapes and sizes. The sport tests so many athletic 
abilities, from hand-eye coordination, to speed, to agility, to quickness. 
We're finally at the pinnacle, we've finally been established. Please don't 
take this away."[51] Finch pitched for the Chicago Bandits of the National 
Pro Fastpitch (NPF) softball league. She was named NPF's Co-Pitcher of 
the Year in 2005, sharing the award with teammate Lauren Bay. She also 
threw her first career no-hitter in a win over the Stratford Brakettes 
that same year.[54][55] On May 29, 2007, in a 1-0 12-inning loss to the 
Rockford Thunder, Finch struck out 17 and combined with Cat Osterman for 
a total of 41 strikeouts to set a single game record for the combined total.[56] 
Finch holds the league's season ERA crown, which she set that same year. 
She pitched a perfect game for the Bandits in 2009 against the Philadelphia 
Force[3] and another perfect game on July 9, 2010 against the Akron Racers.[57] 
That year, Finch was named All-NPF.[58] The Chicago Bandits played their 
home games in Elgin, Illinois, where Finch has many fond memories. On May 
29, 2016, Finch was the guest manager of the Atlantic League's Bridgeport 
Bluefish for the day, thus becoming the first woman to manage a professional 
baseball team.[59] The team played and won one game.[59] In 2002, ESPN 
called Finch the "runaway winner" of the Best Dressed competition at the 
Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Awards.[60][61] In 2003, Finch 
received the most votes in an ESPN online poll as the most attractive female 
athlete.[60] In 2004, People magazine named Finch one of its "50 Most Beautiful 
People", the only female athlete in the list.[62] "This is truly amazing 
to be recognized by People magazine for this honor," Finch said.[62] "It 
is really special to be included among some of the most famous and beautiful 
people in the world. I still have a hard time believing that I was selected 
as part of this group."[62] Finch has modeled swimwear for the Sports Illustrated 
Swimsuit Edition in 2005.[46][63] Finch was offered lucrative contracts 
to disrobe for Playboy and Maxim magazine, but turned them down.[64] This 
Week in Baseball signed Finch as a co-host.[64] In a segment called the 
Jennie Challenge, Finch pitches to Major League Baseball players and often 
strikes them out.[64] In softball, the mound is closer to home plate than 
baseball and Finch's pitches are the equivalent of a 98 mph pitch.[64] 
"Some big-timers refuse to face her," Cal Ripken, Jr. says. "Many feel 
it could be embarrassing."[64] In an interview with ESPN, Finch explained, 
"I was throwing them mostly rise balls and change-ups. They've never seen 
a pitch like that, you know? With the closer distance from the mound, I 
think it really surprises them how fast the pitch gets there. And especially 
with the rise – when they're used to that over-the-top release point – 
there is nothing else like it. The ball movement throws them off."[65] 
In the 2004 Pepsi All-Star Softball Game, Finch struck out Albert Pujols, 
Mike Piazza and Brian Giles.[66] "I never touched a pitch," said Giles.[48] 
"Her fastball was the fastest thing I've ever seen, from that distance. 
It rises and cuts at the same time."[48] In 2006, Finch appeared in Season 
One of Pros vs Joes on Spike TV, a show in which sports stars compete with 
ordinary people.[67][68] She was the first woman to appear on the show.[68] 
Finch appeared on an episode of The Real Housewives of Orange County.[69] 
In 2008, Finch was featured as a contestant on The Celebrity Apprentice 
where she selected International Breast Cancer Research Foundation as her 
charity.[70][71] She was fired by Donald Trump in the fourth week of the 
season.[72] In 2008, Finch also served as the Grand Marshal of the nationally 
televised McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade in downtown Chicago.[73] Finch 
pitched for the National League in the 2010 Legends and Celebrities Softball 
Game, at Angel Stadium,[74] the 2011 game at Chase Field,[75] and the 2015 
game at Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati. In 2011, Finch co-authored 
Throw Like a Girl: How to Dream Big and Believe in Yourself, with Ann Killion. 
The book is a collection of life lessons Finch learned growing up playing 
sports.[76] On November 6, 2011, just four and a half months after giving 
birth to son Diesel, Finch finished the New York Marathon with a time of 
4:05:26, raising $30,000 for the New York Road Runners Youth Program.[77] 
Finch married then-Major League Baseball pitcher Casey Daigle on January 
15, 2005.[78] Daigle proposed to Finch on the softball field at the University 
of Arizona, her alma mater.[78] According to Finch, "He blindfolded me 
and took me to the mound and said, 'You have been the queen of the diamond 
for four years. Now I want you to be the queen of my heart.'"[78] They 
have two sons; Ace Shane, born on May 4, 2006[4] and Diesel Dean, born 
on June 19, 2011.[79] Finch welcomed her daughter Paisley Faye on January 
12, 2013.[80] Finch is an avid fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers.[8] Finch 
is a Christian. Finch turned down large financial offers to appear in magazines 
like Playboy because of her Christian faith, saying she wanted to be a 
role model for young women.[81] Finch has spoken about her faith, saying: 
"It’s so important to find hope in [Jesus] and live for a higher purpose: 
to share about Him."[82] On July 20, 2010, Finch announced her retirement 
from softball to focus on her family.[5] "I just feel like it gets harder 
and harder every year with Ace getting older and time away from my husband 
and even family events such as birthdays and friends' weddings and things 
that I've always just missed out on because of softball," Finch said in 
an interview with the Associated Press.[5] Said Finch, "This whole career 
has been way more than I ever even imagined or dreamed. The opportunities 
that I'd be able to enjoy and appreciate and be a part of, it's been incredible."[5] 
In her final start with the US National Team, Finch struck out 12 and only 
allowed three singles including two infield ones.[83] She continued playing 
with the Chicago Bandits until the National Pro Fastpitch season ended 
in August.[83] Finch was the most dominant and recognizable softball pitcher 
of her era.[5][83] Combined with her pitching skills, Finch's beauty and 
charm landed her a place in the mainstream[5] to become a pop culture icon.[83] 
"She set the standard for softball in a new era of being able to be feminine 
and play this sport," U.S. outfielder Jessica Mendoza said.[5] "Not that 
you have to be feminine to play this sport, but I see hundreds of thousands 
of little girls now with glitter headbands, hot pink bats, makeup. ... 
when I was growing up, it wasn't like that."[5] According to Mike Candrea, 
her coach at Arizona and through two Olympics, "Jennie has transformed 
this sport, touched millions of young kids in many different ways – whether 
it's fashion, whether it's the way she plays the game – but through it 
all she's been very humble."[83] A Chicago Tribune editorial commented, 
"She leaves with a spotless personal reputation, an intent to keep promoting 
softball, and the knowledge that she has inspired other girls and women
