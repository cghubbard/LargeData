The 2014 Boston Red Sox season was the 114th season in the team's history. 
The Red Sox entered the 2014 season as the defending champions, having 
won the 2013 World Series, but quickly returned to their mediocre ways 
of 2012, finishing last in the American League East. They were the first 
defending champions to finish last in their division the next season since 
the Florida Marlins in 1998. They also became the first MLB team to finish 
last in one season, win the World Series the next, and finish last again 
the following season.[1] Boston's first game was Monday, March 31 in Baltimore; 
they closed the season at home for the first time since 2010, against the 
Yankees on Sunday, September 28.[2] The Red Sox played their last year's 
World Series opponent St. Louis Cardinals in interleague play in early 
August at Busch Stadium.[3] Other interleague match-ups included 2013 postseason 
participants Atlanta, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.[3] The Red Sox finished 
2014 with a record of 71–91, only two wins better than their disastrous 
2012 campaign under Bobby Valentine, in which they finished 69–93. Their 
combined 2012–14 regular season record is 237–249, a .488 winning percentage, 
in spite of their 2013 world championship season. Infielders Coaches Reference:[2]
