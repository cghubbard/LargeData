Curtell Howard Motton (/ˈmoʊtən/ MOH-tən; September 24, 1940 – January 
21, 2010) was an American Major League Baseball outfielder. Mainly a reserve 
left fielder and pinch hitter, he was with the Baltimore Orioles when they 
won three consecutive American League pennants and a World Series from 
1969 to 1971. He was nicknamed Cuz (short for cousin) because of his outgoing 
manner. Motton played baseball at Encinal High School in Alameda, California, 
the same school that produced Willie Stargell and Tommy Harper.[2] He completed 
his education at Santa Rosa Junior College[3] and the University of California 
in Berkeley, CA. Motton signed as an amateur free agent by the Chicago 
Cubs on July 20, 1961. After only one full campaign with the St. Cloud 
Rox in 1962, in which he hit .291 with 13 home runs and 69 runs batted 
in, he was selected by the Orioles in the 1962 first-year draft. Both he 
and Paul Blair powered the offense of the Harry Dunlop-managed Stockton 
Ports when they won the 1963 California League championship. Motton led 
the team in batting with a .333 average.[4] He spent the next 1½ years 
away from the Orioles organization when he served in the United States 
Army at Fort Richardson. He managed to play organized baseball in 1964 
with the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks, which also featured Tom Seaver, 
Graig Nettles and Rick Monday. He returned to the Orioles' farm system 
in 1965, and made his major league debut during the 1967 season. Motton 
saw the most playing time in his career in 1968 when he platooned in left 
field with Curt Blefary. For the season, he batted only .198 with eight 
home runs and 25 RBIs, however, perhaps as a sign of things to come, he 
set a record by hitting a pinch hit home run[5] in consecutive pinch hit 
at-bats on May 15[6] and May 17.[7] In 1969, infielder Don Buford was converted 
into an outfielder, relegating Motton to pinch hitting duties. Motton shined 
in his new role, batting .303 with six home runs and 21 RBIs for the season. 
Perhaps his most memorable pinch hit at-bat came on October 5 against the 
Minnesota Twins in the 1969 American League Championship Series. With the 
score tied at zero in the eleventh inning, Motton singled in Boog Powell 
for the only run of the game.[8] Motton remained with the Orioles through 
1971, winning a World Series with the team in 1970. Prior to the start 
of the 1972 season, Motton was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for a player 
to be named later and cash. Expected to compete for one of the starting 
outfield jobs,[9] he ended up being beat out by John Briggs and Joe Lahoud. 
Motton was critical of manager Dave Bristol over his lack of playing time, 
and was traded to the California Angels for minor league pitcher Archie 
Reynolds just over a month into the season.[10] He batted just .156 for 
his two clubs, and began the 1973 season assigned to the Angels' triple 
A affiliate, the Salt Lake City Angels. After batting just .152 in 28 games 
for Salt Lake, the Angels released Motton, and he returned to the Orioles. 
Motton appeared in just seven more games for the Orioles over the next 
two seasons. Motton died after a long battle with stomach cancer at his
