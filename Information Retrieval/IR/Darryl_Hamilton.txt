Darryl Quinn Hamilton (December 3, 1964 – June 21, 2015) was an American 
professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Milwaukee Brewers (1988, 1990–95), Texas Rangers (1996), San Francisco 
Giants (1997–98), Colorado Rockies (1998–99) and New York Mets (1999–2001). 
Hamilton prepped at Louisiana State University Laboratory School in Baton 
Rouge and then attended Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana. 
Hamilton was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 11th round of the 
1986 Major League Baseball draft and signed a contract with them on June 
12, 1986.[1] He made his professional debut that season with the Helena 
Gold Sox of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, hitting .391 in 65 games.[2] 
In 1987 with the Stockton Ports of the Class A California League, he hit 
.328 in 125 games with eight homers and 61 RBI,[2] on a team that was rated 
one of the top farm teams in Brewers history.[3] He began 1988 with the 
Denver Zephyrs of the Class AAA American Association, where he hit .325 
in 72 games.[2] Hamilton made his MLB debut on June 3, 1988, as a defensive 
replacement for Robin Yount in the top of the seventh against the California 
Angels. In his first at-bat, in the bottom of the inning, he singled to 
center field off of Stew Cliburn of the Angels for his first major league 
hit.[4] He hit his first home run off of Bret Saberhagen of the Kansas 
City Royals on July 19, 1988.[5] In 44 games with the Brewers during the 
second half of the 1988 season, Hamilton hit .184.[1] His most notable 
moment that season was during his first start in left field, on September 
3, he collided with shortstop Dale Sveum while chasing a blooper over third 
base. They collided with such force that Sveum's leg snapped, causing him 
to miss the rest of the season and all of the 1989 season and derailing 
his career.[6] Hamilton avoided injury but spent the entire 1989 season 
back in the minors with the Zephyrs, where he hit .286 in 129 games.[2] 
In 1990, despite missing time with injuries, Hamilton played in 89 games 
and hit .295.[1] He was awarded with the Brewers "Unsung Hero Award" in 
1990[7] and the "Good Guy Award" in 1991[8] when he hit .311 in 122 games[1] 
while still dealing with an assortment of injuries.[9] Hamilton stole 41 
bases for the Brewers in 1992, while hitting .298 in 128 games.[1] The 
Brewers as a team stole 256 bases, which was almost 100 times more than 
the second place American League (AL) team.[10] In a game on August 29, 
1992, the Brewers set an AL record by recording 31 hits in a single game 
in a 22–2 rout of the Toronto Blue Jays. Hamilton had four hits and five 
RBI in that game.[11] When long-time Brewer star Paul Molitor left via 
free agency before the 1993 season,[12] Hamilton became more important 
to the Brewers offense.[13] He had some more injuries this season,[14] 
but Hamilton still led his team in batting average (.310), hits (161), 
singles (130) and stolen bases (21)[1] and was awarded with the team's 
"Harvey Kuenn Award."[15] The Brewers decision to move Hamilton from right 
field into center field for the 1994 season contributed to Hall of Famer 
Robin Yount's decision to retire after the 1993 season.[16] In 1994, Hamilton 
played in only 36 games (hitting .262)[1] before he was shut down for the 
season and underwent reconstructive elbow surgery.[17] Despite missing 
most of the season, the Milwaukee chapter of the Baseball Writers Association 
voted him the recipient of the "Michael Harrison Award" for community service.[18] 
Hamilton was also one of the Brewers player representatives during the 
leadup to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike.[19] In his final season 
as a member of the Brewers, in 1995, Hamilton played in 112 games and hit 
.271 with 11 stolen bases. In his seven seasons with the team, he had an 
overall .290 batting average in 666 games and hit 23 home runs, drove in 
253 RBI and stole 109 bases.[1] After the 1995 season, the Brewers declined 
Hamilton's $2.5 million contract option, making him a free agent. Hamilton 
filed a grievance against the Brewers, claiming that he was benched in 
the weeks of the season in order to keep him from reading 550 plate appearances 
which would have automatically picked up the option. The grievance was 
resolved in an undisclosed negotiated settlement.[20] Hamilton signed with 
the Texas Rangers on a one-year, $1.3 million, contract on December 14, 
1995, for the 1996 season.[1] He was critical of the Brewers when he signed 
with the Rangers, saying they weren't interested in building a winning 
team.[21] Hamilton played in a career best 148 games with the Rangers and 
was their regular starting center fielder.[22] He hit .293 with six homers 
and 51 RBI and also stole 15 bases.[1] He described his experience with 
the Rangers as "great."[21] Hamilton didn't make a single error all season 
and led all center fielders in putouts as the Rangers put a premium on 
defense that season.[22] The Rangers won the American League West division 
and the first playoff berth in franchise history.[23] In the 1996 American 
League Division Series against the New York Yankees, Hamilton had three 
hits in 19 at-bats as the Rangers dropped the series three games to one 
.[24] Hamilton signed a two-year contract with the San Francisco Giants 
on January 10, 1997.[25] On June 12, he got the first hit in the first-ever 
regular-season interleague game, when the Giants defeated the Rangers 4-3.[26] 
In 125 games, Hamilton had a .270 batting average, five homers, 43 RBI 
and 15 stolen bases.[1] In the 1997 National League Division Series, Hamilton 
was hitless in five at-bats as the Giants were swept in three games by 
the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins.[27] He followed that 
up by playing in 97 games for the Giants in 1998 and hitting .294.[1] The 
Giants traded Hamilton and Jim Stoops to the Colorado Rockies for Ellis 
Burks on July 31, 1998. Hamilton was surprised by the trade, wanting to 
complete his contract in San Francisco.[28] In 51 games he hit .335.[1] 
He re-signed with the Rockies after the 1998 season for one year and $3.6 
million[1] and played in 91 games in the 1999 season with an OBP of .374 
for them.[1] Hamilton was traded to the New York Mets with Chuck McElroy 
for Rigo Beltrán, Brian McRae, and Thomas Johns on July 31, 1999.[29] He 
played with the Mets through the 2001 season. In his three seasons with 
them he played in 150 games and hit .283.[1] Hamilton and the Mets played 
in the post-season in both 1999 and 2000. In 1999, the Mets made the playoffs 
as a result of winning a one game playoff against the Cincinnati Reds.[30] 
Once in, they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 1999 National League 
Division Series[31] before losing to the Atlanta Braves in six games in 
the National League Championship Series. Hamilton had six hits in 17 at-bats 
in that series.[32] In 2000, the Mets defeated the San Francisco Giants 
in four games in the 2000 National League Division Series[33] and the St. 
Louis Cardinals in five games in the 2000 National League Championship 
Series.[34] Hamilton was a part-time player in the series, with only five 
at-bats in the division series and two in the championship series.[1] In 
the 2000 World Series against the New York Yankees was hitless in three 
at-bats with two strikeouts as the Yankees won the series in five games.[35] 
Hamilton was disappointed with his playing time during the playoffs and 
had a meeting with manager Bobby Valentine during spring training the following 
year to discuss his reduced playing time.[36] Things did not improve for 
him and he asked for his release at the end of June,[37] and it was granted 
on July 11, 2001.[1] He signed a minor league contract with the Rockies 
a week later, but was released on July 25[1] after four games with the 
Colorado Springs Sky Sox.[2] He retired at the end of the 2001 season.[citation

and 454 RBI in 1328 games. As an outfielder, he collected 2711 putouts 
and 45 assists, committing only 14 errors in 2770 total chances, for a 
.995 fielding percentage.[1] Hamilton was a notorious ground ball hitter, 
rarely struck out, drew a significant number of walks, and was a speedy 
runner who stole 41 bases in 1992 for the Brewers. He holds the American 
League records for consecutive errorless chances (541) and errorless games 
(229).[citation needed] Hamilton worked for MLB Advanced Media from 2003 
to 2006 and also worked for NBC Sports Network's "Sports Talk" and KPRC-TV 
in Houston.[38] Also in Texas, Hamilton lent his voice to KFNC and KGOW.[39] 
At the conclusion of the 2006 baseball postseason, Hamilton began working 
in the Major League Baseball Commissioner's Office of On-Field Operations, 
reporting to Vice President Bob Watson.[citation needed] In 2012 Hamilton 
was named as a color analyst for a limited series of Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim games to be broadcast nationally by Compass Media Networks radio[40] 
and in 2013 he joined the MLB Network as an on-air analyst.[38] In 2014 
Hamilton served as a part-time color analyst on Brewers radio broadcasts, 
rotating with Craig Counsell and Jerry Augustine to call games with Joe 
Block when primary announcer Bob Uecker was absent.[41] Darryl was married 
in 1994 to Access Hollywood anchor Shaun Robinson, but they divorced.[42] 
Hamilton married fashion model Ursaline Steinke in 2000, with whom he had 
two sons, Donovan and Julian.[43] At the time of his death, Darryl was 
living in an affluent neighborhood in suburb of Houston, Texas in a house 
belonging to his girlfriend, Monica Jordan. Jordan, a graduate of Florida 
State University and University of Houston Law Center, was an attorney 
who had been employed by Enron and Halliburton. The couple had a son together 
in 2014.[44] Around 4:45 p.m. on June 21, 2015, Hamilton, 50, and his girlfriend, 
Monica Jordan, 44, were found dead in their Pearland, Texas house, in what 
appeared to be a murder-suicide. Investigators said it appeared Hamilton 
had been shot more than once and Jordan died from a self-inflicted gunshot 
wound. Hamilton and Jordan's 13 month-old child was found alive by police 
in the home and taken into the custody of Texas Child Protective Services.[45] 
According to Pearland police, there did not appear to have been a struggle 
and the incident "occurred just inside the front door." A third party called 
9-1-1.[44] According to Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri Yenne, Jordan 
previously pleaded guilty to felony arson arising from a 2008 incident 
in which she burned down the house in which she had been living with her 
then-husband. Jordan allegedly had suspected her then-husband of cheating 
on her and chased him around the house while trying to douse him in gasoline.[39]
