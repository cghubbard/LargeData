Anthony Michael "Tony" Lazzeri (December 6, 1903 – August 6, 1946) was 
an American professional baseball second baseman during the 1920s and 1930s, 
predominantly with the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball. He was 
part of the famed "Murderers' Row" Yankee batting lineup of the late 1920s 
(most notably the legendary 1927 team), along with Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, 
and Bob Meusel. He was also the first person to hit two grand slams in 
one game in 1936 vs Athletics. Lazzeri was born and raised in San Francisco, 
California. He dropped out of school to work with his father as a boilermaker, 
but at the age of 18, began to play baseball professionally. After playing 
in minor league baseball from 1922 through 1925, Lazzeri joined the Yankees 
in 1926. He was a member of the original American League All-Star team 
in 1933. He was nicknamed "Poosh 'Em Up" by Italian-speaking fans, from 
a mistranslation of an Italian phrase meaning to "hit it out" (hit a home 
run). Lazzeri is one of only 14 major league baseball players to hit for 
the natural cycle (hitting a single, double, triple and home run in sequence) 
and the only player to complete a natural cycle with a grand slam.[1] Lazzeri 
was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the 
Veterans Committee in 1991. Lazzeri was born on December 6, 1903, to Augustine 
and Julia Lazzeri, who had emigrated from Italy. They lived in the Cow 
Hollow district of San Francisco. Augustine worked as a boilermaker.[2] 
At age 15, Lazzeri was expelled from school. He began to work with his 
father, earning $4.50 a day ($71 in current dollar terms).[2] Lazzeri also 
played semi-professional baseball and trained to become a prizefighter.[2] 
A friend of Lazzeri convinced Duffy Lewis, who managed the Salt Lake City 
Bees of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), to allow Lazzeri to tryout for 
the team in 1922. Lazzeri made the team, earning $250 a month ($3,540 in 
current dollar terms) as a utility infielder. He batted .192 in 45 games, 
and was demoted to the Peoria Tractors of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League 
in 1923 to gain more experience.[2] Lazzeri batted .248 with 14 home runs 
in 135 games for Peoria, before being recalled to Salt Lake City. Starting 
at shortstop for the Bees in 1924, Lazzeri batted .285 with 16 home runs. 
However, Lewis gave the starting shortstop role to Pinky Pittenger, and 
sent Lazzeri to the Lincoln Links of the Western League, where he batted 
.329 with 28 home runs in 82 games.[2] Returning to Salt Lake City under 
new manager Oscar Vitt in 1925, Lazzeri batted .355 with 60 home runs and 
222 runs batted in (RBIs), the most RBIs in professional baseball history.[2] 
That year he became one of what are today four Pacific Coast League hitters 
to have had a 30 home runs, 30 stolen bases season, along with Joc Pederson 
(2014), Frank Demaree (1934), and Lefty O'Doul (1927).[3] Though Salt Lake 
City had a working agreement with the Chicago Cubs, the Cubs passed on 
Lazzeri due to his epilepsy. The Cincinnati Reds passed on Lazzeri as well. 
Bill Essick, a scout for the New York Yankees, convinced Ed Barrow, the 
Yankees' general manager, to sign Lazzeri. Barrow agreed after receiving 
confirmatory reports from other scouts, including Ed Holly and Paul Krichell, 
as well as ensuring that Lazzeri's insurance policy would cover his illness.[2] 
After the 1925 season, Barrow purchased Lazzeri from Salt Lake City in 
exchange for the rights to Frank Zoeller and Mack Hillis and $50,000 ($675,806 
in current dollar terms). Lazzeri signed a contract with the Yankees worth 
$5,000 ($67,581 in current dollar terms).[2] Lazzeri debuted in the major 
leagues in 1926 as a member of the Yankees. Manager Miller Huggins moved 
Lazzeri from shortstop to second base. Huggins paired Lazzeri with Mark 
Koenig, also a rookie, as his double play combination.[2] In his rookie 
season, playing all 155 games, Lazzeri hit 18 home runs and had 114 RBIs. 
He finished third in the American League (AL) in home runs behind Babe 
Ruth and Al Simmons, and tied for third in RBIs with George Burns, trailing 
only Ruth.[2] The Yankees reached the 1926 World Series, losing to the 
St. Louis Cardinals. In a bases loaded situation in the seventh inning 
of the deciding game, Grover Cleveland Alexander struck out Lazzeri to 
save the series for the Cardinals.[2][4] With the 1927 Yankees, known as 
"Murderer's Row" due to the strength of their batting lineup, Lazzeri batted 
.309 with 18 home runs and 102 RBIs. He finished third in the AL in home 
runs, behind only teammates Ruth and Lou Gehrig. The Yankees finished the 
season with an 110–44 win-loss record, and defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in the 1927 World Series.[2][4] Baseball experts solicited by Billy Evans 
named Lazzeri the consensus best second baseman in the AL.[5] He suffered 
a muscle injury that threatened to end his season.[6] Nevertheless, Lazzeri 
returned to the team, and hit a key double off of Alexander in the 1928 
World Series, which the Yankees won.[7] Despite the games he missed, Lazzeri 
tied Joe Judge for third place in Most Valuable Player voting, with the 
award being won by Mickey Cochrane.[7][8][9] Lazzeri had his career-high 
batting average of .354 in 1929. He hit two home runs for the Yankees in 
the 1932 World Series. In 1933, Lazzeri was named to appear in the first 
MLB All-Star Game, representing the AL against the National League (NL).[2] 
He suffered a knee injury during the 1934 season.[10] Lazzeri set an AL 
single-game record on May 24, 1936, when he recorded eleven RBIs.[11] That 
month, he also set records for most home runs in three consecutive games 
(6) and four consecutive games (7).[2] He hit a grand slam during the 1936 
World Series, only the second grand slam in World Series history.[12] Lazzeri 
scored the deciding run in the 1937 World Series, as the Yankees defeated 
the New York Giants.[13] As a member of the Yankees through 1937, he averaged 
79 runs, 14 home runs, 96 RBIs and 12 stolen bases, including seven seasons 
with over 100 RBI and five seasons batting .300 or higher (including a 
high of .354 in 1929). During this period, the Yankees won six American 
League pennants (1926, 1927, 1928, 1932, 1936 and 1937) and five World 
Series championships (1927, 1928, 1932, 1936 and 1937). The Yankees released 
Lazzeri following the 1937 season.[14] He signed with the Cubs as a player-coach 
for the 1938 season.[15] Though he received little playing time, the Cubs 
won the NL championship and appeared in the 1938 World Series against the 
Yankees, which the Yankees won.[2] The Cubs released Lazzeri after the 
season, and he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the 1939 season.[16] 
However, the Dodgers released him on May 13, after he batted .282 in 14 
games.[17][18] The next day, Lazzeri signed with the New York Giants, to 
replace George Myatt and Lou Chiozza at third base.[18] Lazzeri received 
his release on June 7.[19] Lazzeri then returned to minor league baseball, 
where he managed the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League for 
the remainder of the 1939 season[20] and entire 1940 season. He played 
for the San Francisco Seals of the PCL in 1941,[21][22] and was released 
after the season.[23] He played for and managed the Portsmouth Cubs of 
the Piedmont League in 1942.[2] Lazzeri served as player-manager of the 
Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League in 1943,[24][25] posting a .271 
batting average in 58 games.[2] He was asked to resign after the season.[26] 
Before the 1923 season, Lazzeri married Maye Janes. The couple had one 
child, David Anthony Lazzeri, who was born in 1931.[2] Lazzeri died at 
age 42 from a fall caused, according to the coroner, by a heart attack[27][28] 
in his Millbrae, California, home. He was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1991 by the Veteran's Committee. Many believe Lazzeri's fall 
was actually caused by an epileptic seizure rather than a heart attack.[29] 
Although his offensive production was overshadowed by the historic accomplishments 
of teammates such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio, Lazzeri is 
still considered one of the top hitting second basemen of his era. Koenig 
considered Lazzeri the team's most valuable player.[7] He finished his 
career with a .292 batting average, 986 runs, 178 home runs, 1191 RBI and 
148 stolen bases. Despite his hitting 60 home runs in an extended PCL season 
in 1925, Lazzeri never hit more than 18 home runs in a major league season 
(a mark he reached four times). Lazzeri holds the American League record 
for most RBI in a game with 11, set May 24, 1936, as he also became the 
first major league player to hit two grand slams in one game. He holds 
the major league record of 15 runs-batted-in in consecutive games (one 
more than Rudy York in 1946 and Sammy Sosa in 2002). He also set major 
league records of six home runs in three consecutive games, and seven in 
four consecutive games. Lazzeri continues to share the consecutive-game 
American League record, but the three-game record was topped by Shawn Green 
of the Dodgers (seven in 2002) and the four-game mark was broken by Ralph 
Kiner of the Pittsburgh Pirates (eight in 1947). Lazzeri is also the only 
player in major league baseball to hit a natural cycle with the final home 
run being a grand slam on June 3, 1932.[30] In a 1976 Esquire magazine 
article, sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument 
Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Lazzeri was the second 
baseman on Stein's Italian team. The Veterans Committee elected Lazzeri
