James Jerome O'Toole (January 10, 1937 – December 26, 2015) was an American 
professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago White Sox during his 10-year career.[1] 
After graduating from Chicago's Leo High School, O'Toole attended the University 
of Wisconsin–Madison. He made his Major League debut with the Reds after 
only one minor league season, with the 1958 Nashville Vols, where he led 
the AA Southern Association in wins (20), innings pitched, strikeouts and 
bases on balls. From 1961–64, he won 19, 16, 17 and 17 games for the Cincinnati 
Reds, from 1961 to 1963 respectively 3rd, tied for 8th, and tied for 10th 
in the National League. He played a crucial role in Cincinnati's 1961 National 
League championship, when he won 19 of 28 decisions, with an earned run 
average of 3.10, second in the National League behind Warren Spahn. He 
was named Player of the Month for September with a 5–0 record, 2.53 ERA, 
and 37 strike outs. He finished 10th in MVP voting. Though pitching effectively 
in the 1961 World Series, with an earned run average of 3.00, O'Toole lost 
his two decisions to Whitey Ford in games 1 and 4, as the New York Yankees 
bested the Reds in five games.[1] In 1963, he was the starting pitcher 
of the National League in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game (his 
only appearance at the Summer Classic), pitching 2 innings and allowing 
1 earned run, not involved in the decision. O'Toole later said that being 
selected as the starting pitcher by San Francisco Giants manager Alvin 
Dark was one of the proudest moments of his career.[1] In 1964, he continued 
as an elite pitcher, with a career-best earned run average of 2.66, 6th 
in the National League, and a win-lost percentage of .708, third in the 
National League behind Sandy Koufax and Juan Marichal, two members of the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. O'Toole played in Cincinnati 
until his final season, 1967, spent with his hometown team, the Chicago 
White Sox, but was ineffective due to arm troubles. O'Toole tried to return 
with a 1969 expansion team, the Seattle Pilots, but was cut in spring training 
before the season began. O'Toole married Betty Jane Wall, his high school 
sweetheart, on July 2, 1960. They had 11 children.[2][1] After his baseball 
career ended, O'Toole had a successful second career in Cincinnati real 
estate sales and remained active in the community, supporting charities 
and participating in local events including the 2015 St. Patrick's Day 
parade where he served as the grand marshal.[1] O'Toole died on December
