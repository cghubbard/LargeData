The phrase "Brock for Broglio" is sometimes used in the sport of baseball 
to signify a trade that in hindsight, turns out to be an extremely lopsided 
transaction.[1] The names in the phrase refer to Lou Brock and Ernie Broglio 
respectively, the centerpieces of a June 15, 1964, six-player deal: Brock, 
Jack Spring and Paul Toth were traded from the Chicago Cubs to the St. 
Louis Cardinals in exchange for Broglio, Bobby Shantz, and Doug Clemens.[1] 
It was thought initially the Cubs had done better in the deal, as Broglio 
was coming off some impressive seasons while pitching for the Cardinals, 
while Brock had been considered a disappointment for the Cubs.[1] Almost 
immediately the effects of the trade were felt, as Brock batted .348 for 
the Cardinals and led them to winning the 1964 World Series. Brock also 
helped the Cardinals to another World Series title in 1967, a pennant in 
1968, and played successfully for St. Louis through 1979, amassing 3,023 
hits and 938 stolen bases (at the time becoming baseball's all-time leader 
in stolen bases) en route to his Hall of Fame election in 1985. Meanwhile, 
Broglio went only 4-7 with a 4.04 ERA for the Cubs, and by 1966 was out 
of Major League Baseball. Broglio did not tell anyone at the time, but 
he was suffering from an injured elbow since the second half of the 1963 
season, and in November 1964, had his ulnar nerve reset.[1] This is sometimes 
referred to as the most lopsided trade in baseball history.[2][3] An association 
of Cubs fans in the Washington, D.C. area, which includes national political 
leaders and journalists, occasionally recognizes bad decision-making with 
the "Brock-for-Broglio Judgment Award"â€”presented, for example, to Saddam
