San Juan (/ˌsæn ˈhwɑːn/; Spanish pronunciation: [saŋ ˈxwan], Saint John) 
is the capital and most populous municipality in the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States. As of the 2010 
census, it had a population of 395,326 making it the 46th-largest city 
under the jurisdiction of the United States. San Juan was founded by Spanish 
colonists in 1521, who called it Ciudad de Puerto Rico ("Rich Port City"). 
Puerto Rico's capital is the second oldest European-established capital 
city in the Americas, after Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic.[5] 
Several historical buildings are located in San Juan; among the most notable 
are the city's former defensive forts, Fort San Felipe del Morro and Fort 
San Cristóbal, and La Fortaleza, the oldest executive mansion in continuous 
use in the Americas. Today, San Juan is Puerto Rico's most important seaport,[6] 
and is the island's manufacturing,[citation needed] financial, cultural, 
and tourism center. The population of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, 
including San Juan and the municipalities of Bayamón, Guaynabo, Cataño, 
Canóvanas, Caguas, Toa Alta, Toa Baja, Carolina and Trujillo Alto, is about 
2 million inhabitants; thus, about half the population of Puerto Rico now 
lives and works in this area.[7] San Juan is also a principal city of the 
San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area. The city has been the 
host of events within the sports community, including the 1979 Pan American 
Games, 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games, events of the 2006, 2009 
and 2013 World Baseball Classics, the Caribbean Series and the Special 
Olympics and MLB San Juan Series in 2010. In 1508, Juan Ponce de León founded 
the original settlement which he called Caparra. It was named after the 
Province of Caceres in Spain, the birthplace of Nicolás de Ovando, then 
the Governor of Spain's Caribbean territories,[8] Today it is part of the 
Pueblo Viejo sector of Guaynabo, just to the west of the present San Juan 
metropolitan area. A year later, the settlement was moved to a site then 
called Puerto Rico, Spanish for "rich port" or "good port", after its similar 
geographical features to the town of Puerto Rico of Gran Canaria in the 
Canary Islands.[9] In 1521, the newer settlement was given its formal name, 
Puerto Rico de San Juan Bautista. The ambiguous use of San Juan Bautista 
and Puerto Rico for both the city and the island in time led to a reversal 
in practical use by most inhabitants: by 1746 the name for the city (Puerto 
Rico) had become that of the entire island, leading to the city being identified 
as Puerto Rico de Puerto Rico on maps of the era.[10] On the other hand, 
the name for the island (San Juan Bautista) became the name for the city 
only after the occupation of the island by the United States.[11][12] San 
Juan, as a settlement of the Spanish Empire, was used by merchant and military 
ships traveling from Spain as the first stopover in the Americas. Because 
of its prominence in the Caribbean, a network of fortifications was built 
to protect the transports of gold and silver from the New World to Europe. 
Because of the rich cargoes, San Juan became a target of the foreign powers 
of the time.[13] The city was witness to attacks from the English led by 
Sir Francis Drake in 1595 (in what is known as the Battle of Puerto Rico) 
and by George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, in 1598. Artillery from San 
Juan's fort, El Morro, repelled Drake; however, Clifford managed to land 
troops and lay siege to the city.[14] After a few months of English occupation, 
Clifford was forced to abandon the siege when his troops began to suffer 
from exhaustion and sickness. In 1625 the city was sacked by Dutch forces 
led by Captain Balduino Enrico (also known as Boudewijn Hendricksz/Bowdoin 
Henrick), but El Morro withstood the assault and was not taken. The Dutch 
were counterattacked by Captain Juan de Amezquita and 50 members of the 
civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El 
Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico with 
a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of Amezquita.[15][unreliable 
source?] The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans who defeated 
those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers 
of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and 
save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza 
and the city ablaze. Captains Amezquita and Andre Botello decided to put 
a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's 
front and rear guard. They drove Enrico and his men from their trenches 
and into the ocean in their haste to reach their ships.[16] The British 
attack in 1797, during the French Revolutionary Wars, led by Sir Ralph 
Abercromby (who had just conquered Trinidad). His army laid siege to the 
city but was forced to withdraw in defeat as the Puerto Rican defenses 
proved more resilient than those of Trinidad. Various events and circumstances, 
including liberalized commerce with Spain, the opening of the island to 
immigrants as a direct result of the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815, and 
the colonial revolutions, led to an expansion of San Juan and other Puerto 
Rican settlements in the late 18th and early 19th century. On May 8, 1898, 
United States Navy ships, among them the USS Detroit, USS Indiana, USS New 
York, USS Amphitrite, USS Terror and USS Montgomery, commanded by Rear 
Admiral William T. Sampson arrived at San Juan Bay.[17][18] The USS Yale 
captured a Spanish freighter, the Rita in San Juan Bay, thus being the 
first hostile encounter between the warring sides in Puerto Rico. On May 
9, Yale fought a brief battle with an auxiliary cruiser of Spain, name 
unknown, resulting in a Spanish victory. Around this time, Captain Ángel 
Rivero Méndez was assigned the command of the Spanish forces in the fortress 
of San Cristóbal in San Juan. On May 10, the Yale returned to San Juan 
Bay, Rivero-Méndez ordered his men to open fire upon the USS Yale using 
an Ordoñez 15 centimeter cannon, thus becoming the first attack against 
the Americans in Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War.[19] For his 
actions, Captain Rivero-Mendez was awarded the "Cruz de la Orden de Merito 
Militar" (The Cross of the Order of the Military Merit) first class.[19] 
The residents of San Juan were furious with Rivero and blamed him for the 
destruction caused to their city by the American bombardments. Nothing 
came of those accusations and Capt. Rivero-Méndez was ordered to turn over 
the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry 
A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed.[19] 
On July 25, General Nelson A. Miles landed at Guánica (in southwestern 
Puerto Rico) with 3,300 soldiers in what was known as the Puerto Rican 
Campaign. The American troops found some resistance and engaged the Spanish 
and Puerto Rican troops in battle, the most notable of these the battles 
of Yauco and Asomante. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended 
August 13, 1898, after President William McKinley and French Ambassador 
Jules Cambon, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice.[20][21] 
Spain ceded the island to the United States later the same year by signing 
the Treaty of Paris. Camp Las Casas, located in the district of Santurce, 
served as the main training camp for the Puerto Rican soldiers prior to 
World War I and World War II; the majority of the men trained in this facility 
were assigned to the "Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry" which was renamed 
the 65th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army by the Reorganization 
Act of June 4, 1920. The 65th Infantry was deactivated in 1956 and became 
the only unit ever to be transferred from an active Army component to the 
Puerto Rico National Guard.[22] Lieutenant Teófilo Marxuach (Retired as 
a Lieutenant Colonel), a native of Arroyo, Puerto Rico, fired the first 
shot in what is considered to be the first shot of World War I fired by 
the regular armed forces of the United States against any ship flying the 
colors of the Central Powers[23] Marxuach, who was a member of the "Porto 
Rico Regiment of Infantry" and Officer of the Day, on March 25, 1915, opened 
fire on the Odenwald, an armed German supply vessel, when it was trying 
to force its way out of San Juan's bay.[24] The shots ordered by Lt. Marxuach 
were the first fired by the United States in World War I.[25] In 1919, 
Félix Rigau Carrera, "El Aguila de Sabana Grande" (The Eagle from Sabana 
Grande), the first Puerto Rican pilot, became the first native Puerto Rican 
to fly an aircraft in the island when he flew his Curtiss JN-4 from Las 
Casas. At the time, the area was used by the military as an air base and 
it was also Puerto Rico's first commercial airport, and Rigau Carrera was 
allowed to perform his historic flight from the air field.[26] Camp Las 
Casas was eventually closed down, and in 1950 a public housing project 
by the name of Residencial Fray Bartolome de Las Casas was constructed 
on its former location. On January 2, 1947, the people of San Juan elected 
Felisa Rincón de Gautier (also known as Doña Fela) (1897–1994) as their 
mayor. Thus, she became the first woman to be elected as the mayor of a 
capital city in any of The Americas.[27] During the Cold War era, she ordered 
the establishment of the island's first Civil Defense system under the 
directorship of Colonel Gilberto José Marxuach (Teófilo's son).[28] Rincón 
de Gautier served as mayor until January 2, 1969. On October 30, 1950, 
San Juan was the scene of the San Juan Uprising, one of many uprisings 
which occurred in various towns and cities in Puerto Rico, by the Puerto 
Rican Nationalist Party against the governments of Puerto Rico and the 
United States. Among the uprising's main objective was to attack "La Fortaleza" 
(the Governors mansion) and the United States Federal Court House Building 
in Old San Juan. In accordance to the planned uprising in San Juan, a group 
of nationalists were supposed to attack simultaneously the gubernatorial 
mansion La Fortaleza, where Puerto Rican governor Luis Muñoz Marín resided, 
and the United States Federal Court House which is located close to an 
area called "La Marina" in Old San Juan. The La Fortaleza battle, which 
ensued between the nationalists and the police lasted 15 minutes, and ended 
when four of the five attackers were killed.[29] On March 8, 1948 the city 
government of San Juan officially adopted as the city's first flag an orange 
field, in the center of which is the Coat of Arms of the City. The orange 
color was based and taken from Father Diego de Torres Vargas' text and 
it reads : "Escudo de armas dado a Puerto Rico por los Reyes Católicos 
en el año de 1511, siendo Procurador un vecino llamado Pedro Moreno. Son : 
un cordero blanco con su banderilla colorada, sobre un libro, y todo sobre 
una isla verde, que es la de Puerto Rico, y por los lados una F y una I, 
que quiere decir Fernando e Isabel, los Reyes Católicos que se las dieron, 
y hoy se conservan en el estandarte real, que es de damasco anaranjado, 
con que se ganó la ciudad" ("Coat of Arms given to Puerto Rico by the Catholic 
Monarchs in the year 1511 being Procurator a vecino named Pedro Moreno. 
They are: a white lamb with a red flag, on top of a book, and everything 
above a green island, which is Puerto Rico...which is of orange damask, 
with which the city was won"). It appears that the color was changed from 
orange to white at some point.[30] 17th-century Spanish painting commemorating

(1950) Coat of arms of San Juan San Juan is located along the north-eastern 
coast of Puerto Rico. It lies south of the Atlantic Ocean; north of Caguas 
and Trujillo Alto; east of and Guaynabo; and west of Carolina. The city 
occupies an area of 76.93 square miles (199.2 km2), of which, 29.11 square 
miles (75.4 km2) (37.83%) is water. San Juan's main water bodies are San 
Juan Bay and two natural lagoons, the Condado and San José.[31] San Juan 
has a tropical monsoon climate and enjoys an average temperature of 81.0 °F 
(27.2 °C) although 90 °F (32 °C) or higher temperatures are seen on an 
average 79 days annually, more commonly occurring during the wetter months 
of the northern summer, especially if the winds come from the south. In 
the winter, temperatures can drop to around 60 °F (16 °C), though the average 
winter low is 71 °F (22 °C). The coolest temperature officially recorded 
was 60 °F (16 °C) on March 3, 1957, and the hottest was 98 °F (37 °C) on 
October 9, 1981;[32] the record cold daily maximum is 71 °F (22 °C) on 
February 4, 1935, while the record warm daily minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) 
on August 11, 1995, the most recent of four occasions.[33] Rainfall is 
well-distributed throughout the year, but the months of January, February, 
and March are the driest; as March averages just 1.95 inches (49.5 mm) 
of rain, the city falls under the tropical monsoon category.[34] Rainfall 
averages 56.35 inches (1,431.3 mm), falling on an average 198.5 days per 
year;[33] despite this dampness, the city averages 2,970 hours of sunshine 
per year, or just over ⅔ of the possible total.[35] Annual rainfall has 
historically ranged from 35.53 in (902 mm) in 1991 to 89.50 in (2,273 mm) 
in 2010.[33] The architecture of San Juan is very diverse, due to its size 
and all the cultural influences received during its existence. The oldest 
part of the city, known as Old San Juan, mostly features the influence 
of Spanish architecture. This part of the city is comprised by a network 
of setted roads usually surrounded by ancient, two-storied houses built 
on masonry. Some colonial structures have been restored and serve either 
as government offices or museums. Some examples are the Ballajá Barracks, 
which now serve as museum and headquarter of several cultural organizations; 
La Fortaleza, which has served as the residence of the Governor of Puerto 
Rico since the 16th Century; and the Ancient Welfare Asylum, which now 
houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, among others. Old San Juan 
also features several public squares, like the Plaza de Armas, located 
in front of San Juan City Hall; and cathedrals, like the Cathedral of San 
Juan Bautista.[38] Old San Juan is also notable for being partly enclosed 
by massive walls and fortifications built by the Spanish government. The 
architecture is more varied in other districts of the city. The district 
of Santurce features a lot of influence from art deco, while the districts 
of Hato Rey feature more modern structures. What is now known as Old San 
Juan occupied the western end of a rocky islet, the Isleta de San Juan, 
at the mouth of San Juan Bay. During the 20th century, the main population 
centers surged well beyond the walls of the old city and onto Puerto Rico's 
main island, and merged with the existing settlements east and south of 
Old San Juan. With the annexation of Río Piedras in 1951, the municipality 
of San Juan grew four times its previous size. As a result, the city is 
now composed of a variety of districts and neighborhoods. San Juan is now 
subdivided into 18 districts (barrios),[39] 16 of which fall within the 
former municipality of Río Piedras. Eight districts are further subdivided 
into sectors (sub-barrios), including two districts in the area that covered 
the original municipality of San Juan. The 18 districts are: During the 
Spanish colonial times most of the urban population resided in what is 
now known as Old San Juan. This sector is located on the western half of 
a small island called the Isleta de San Juan, which is connected to the 
mainland by two bridges and a causeway. The small island, which comprises 
an area of 47 square miles (120 km2), also hosts the working-class neighborhood 
of Puerta de Tierra and most of Puerto Rico's central government buildings, 
including the Commonwealth's Capitol. The main central part of the city 
is characterized by narrow streets made of blue cobblestone and picturesque 
colonial buildings, some of which date back to the 16th and 17th century. 
Sections of the old city are surrounded by massive walls and several defensive 
structures and notable forts. These include the 16th-century Fort San Felipe 
del Morro and the 17th-century Fort San Cristóbal, both part of San Juan 
National Historic Site, and the 16th-century El Palacio de Santa Catalina, 
also known as La Fortaleza, which serves as the governor's mansion.[40] 
Other buildings of interest predating the 20th century are the Ayuntamiento 
or Alcaldía (City Hall), the Diputación Provincial and the Real Intendencia 
buildings, which currently house the Puerto Rico Department of State,[41] 
the Casa Rosa, the San José Church (1523) and the adjacent Hotel El Convento, 
the former house of the Ponce de León family known as Casa Blanca, the 
Teatro Tapia, the former Spanish barracks (now Museum of Ballajá), La Princesa 
(former municipal jail, now headquartering the Puerto Rico Tourism Company), 
and the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery, located just outside 
the city walls.[42][43][44] The Cathedral of San Juan Bautista (construction 
began in the 1520s) is also located in Old San Juan, and contains the tomb 
of the Spanish explorer and settlement founder Juan Ponce de León.[45] 
Old San Juan, also known as the "old city", is the main cultural tourist 
attraction in Puerto Rico; its bayside is lined by dock slips for large 
cruise ships. East of Old San Juan lies the wealthy tourist-oriented neighborhood 
of Condado, which occupies land that used to be owned by entrepreneur Pablo 
Ubarri Capetillo, a Spanish railroad developer and Count of San José de 
Santurce under the Spanish colonial period. Beaches such as nearby Ocean 
Park, popular with swimmers, surfers and kitesurfers, are found all along 
the district's Atlantic coastline which is also the locus of numerous hotels.[46] 
Near Condado are two separate business districts, Santurce and Miramar. 
Miramar is mainly a residential area rising south of the Condado Lagoon. 
It comprises the former barrio of Miraflores, as well as drained marshland 
and landfill over which was built San Juan's first airport, the Isla Grande 
airport, which was renamed Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport in honor 
of Major Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci (USAF). Miramar now hosts the Puerto 
Rico Convention Center as well as some of San Juan Harbor's cruise ship 
piers. In 2005 Miramar was designated an historical district of Puerto 
Rico.[47] Santurce, originally named San Mateo de Cangrejos (Saint Matthew 
of the Crabs), was a settlement for freed African slaves during the early 
days of the city. After Pablo Ubarri sought permission to link San Juan 
with Río Piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878, the time it took to 
travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization 
and growth of the district. At the beginning of the twentieth century an 
electric trolley was installed, the township was split into three parts, 
and its main settlement, merged with the city, was renamed using the Spanish 
spelling of Santurtzi (Saint George in Basque), Ubarri's birthplace in 
Vizcaya, Spain. The "Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico" (Puerto Rico Museum 
of Art)[48] and other important cultural venues are located in Santurce. 
South of Santurce is Hato Rey, part of the former municipality of Río Piedras. 
Hato Rey was grazing ground for cattle owned by the royal government (hence 
its name, the King's Herd in Spanish) as early as the 16th century,[49] 
and is now considered the financial center of the island. A section of 
this district is often referred to as Milla de Oro (actually 0.47 miles 
or 0.76 kilometres long) due in part to the many banks and businesses located 
there.[49] In the southern part of the city is the socially diversified 
community of Río Piedras. Founded in the mid-1850s, Río Piedras was a separate 
town which hosted sugar cane plantations and the estates of some of San 
Juan's wealthiest inhabitants (as well as their working class staff). The 
Spanish colonial governors also had their summer home there on land which 
eventually gave way to the main campus of the University of Puerto Rico. 
In 1951 the municipalities of San Juan and Río Piedras were merged to redefine 
San Juan's current city limits. Today Río Piedras comprises the largest 
area of the municipality of San Juan.[50] and is home to the "Plaza del 
Mercado" (Río Piedras Marketplace), the main campus and the Medical Sciences 
campus of the University of Puerto Rico and the San Juan Botanical Garden. 
San Juan is the largest city in Puerto Rico by population.[52] From 1899 
to 1950 the municipality of San Juan excluded the township of Río Piedras. 
For this reason, population data and land area for the period make reference 
only to the Antiguo San Juan and Santurce barrios, or subdivisions, of 
San Juan. The old municipality of Río Piedras constituted the third most 
populated city of Puerto Rico at the time of its annexation in 1951. Its 
strategic location south of the capital served as a junction for all the 
principal ways of transportation of the island and as a geographical entry 
to San Juan, which are factors that prompted Río Piedras's dramatic urban 
development in the 20th century. According to the 2010 Census, the racial 
composition of San Juan was as follows: Among the Hispanic and Latino population, 
Puerto Ricans are, unsurprisingly, the largest group; they make up 87.5% 
of San Juan's Hispanic population. People of Dominican descent made up 
12.2% of the Hispanic population, while those of Cuban descent formed 1.7% 
of the Hispanic populace. Other Hispanic and Latino groups collectively 
formed 3.2% of San Juan's Hispanic population. There are 13,304 whites 
of non-Hispanic origin living in San Juan; 10,571 blacks of non-Hispanic 
origin living in San Juan. Non-Hispanic whites and blacks form 3.2% and 
2.6% of San Juan's population respectively. There are also approximately 
562 Asians of non-Hispanic origin in San Juan; they make up only 0.1% of 
the population. However, Asians of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin together 
number at 6,342. The vast majority of Asians in San Juan are of Chinese 
descent; of the 6,342 Asians, 4,928 are Chinese. Chinese comprise 1.4% 
of the population. The only other sizable Asian group in San Juan are Indian 
Americans; there are 698 people of Indian descent in the city, forming 
0.2% of the population. There are very small numbers of people of Filipino, 
Japanese, and Vietnamese ancestry; none of these groups number more than 
100 members.[53] According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, 
87.5% of San Juan's population was native and 12.5% were foreign-born. 
Of the native population, 86.9% were born in Puerto Rico or the United 
States, of which 75.6% were born in Puerto Rico and 8.9% were born in the 
United States. The remaining 0.7% were born in a U.S. territory or were 
born abroad to American parents. The remaining 11.9% of the population 
were born outside the United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories. 
In recent years, an increasing number of Americans not of Hispanic ancestry 
(both of African American and of White American descent) have moved to 
San Juan. In addition, a large number of Stateside Puerto Ricans have settled 
in the city upon their return to Puerto Rico. There is also a growing West 
Indian population, both of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin. In terms of 
ancestry, 23,875 people claimed American ancestry, which is equivalent 
to 5.8% of San Juan's population. Other sizable ancestry groups included 
those of Italian descent, French descent, and West Indian descent. People 
of Italian descent numbered at 1,694, forming 0.4% of the population; people 
of French descent numbered at 1,064, forming 0.2% of the population. Finally, 
those of West Indian descent numbered at 1,393, forming 0.3% of San Juan's 
population. Approximately 1,026 people claimed Sub-Saharan African ancestry; 
719 claimed Irish ancestry; 646 claimed German ancestry; 431 claimed Arab 
ancestry, and 346 claimed English ancestry. There are many other ancestry 
groups in San Juan, but they are very scant.[54] San Juan experienced significant 
economic growth following World War II. During this period the city underwent 
an industrial revolution.[55] The city's economy relies mostly on companies 
dedicated to the manufacture of several products, including: Chemical substances 
(bleach and house cleaning products); medicines; rum and other beverages; 
fertilizers; electric tools; electronic devices; plastics, textiles, and 
food-based products.[55] Tourism is also a key industry, based on San Juan's 
proximity to Puerto Rico's main airport, the Luis Muñoz Marín International 
Airport.[55] The tourism focus of the city is located in the district of 
Condado Beach where there are luxurious hotels.[55] Historical locations 
such as El Morro, Old San Juan and El Cuartel de Ballaja are promoted in 
tourism campaigns. The district of Hato Rey contains a corporate sector 
known as "La Milla de Oro", (The Golden Mile) which serves as the headquarters 
of local and international banks. San Juan's Hato Rey district is often 
referred to as the "Wall Street of the Caribbean", due to the influence 
of the area on Puerto Rico and the Caribbean's economy.[49] Seaborne Airlines 
is headquartered on the 9th floor of the World Plaza Building in San Juan.[56] 
Technological advances after World War II in the development of the airliner, 
coupled with the island's climate and natural setting, have transformed 
San Juan into the springboard for tourism around the island, and has made 
the rest of the Caribbean known throughout the world during the last fifty 
years.[57] Today the capital features hotels, museums, historical buildings, 
restaurants, beaches and shopping centers. In San Juan there are tourist 
attractions, including: Old San Juan, Ocean Park, Isla Verde and Condado. 
Places and monuments emphasized in tourism campaigns include: Old San Juan, 
promoting the historic nature of its colonial buildings and narrow streets 
covered by adoquine, a blue stone cast from furnace slag; they were brought 
over as ballast on Spanish ships.[55] This includes the city's ancient 
defensive wall and forts, most notably El Morro and the Castle of San Cristóbal.[55] 
On January 23, 1984 both of these edifices were catalogued as being part 
of humanity's cultural patrimony.[55] The restaurants and art galleries 
in the zone are visited by tourists.[55] The local universities are promoted 
as historic places, most notably the campus of University of Puerto Rico 
located in Río Piedras, which is the oldest university on the island being 
founded in 1903. San Juan is the birthplace of artists and musicians, locally 
known as Sanjuaneros, who have significantly influenced Puerto Rican culture. 
During the 20th century, the musical aspect of the city was influenced 
by performers including Afro-Caribbean dancer and choreographer Sylvia 
del Villard and José Enrique Pedreira who became a composer of Puerto Rican 
Danzas. International musicians such as opera singer Justino Díaz and Grammy 
Award winners Ramón Ayala (Daddy Yankee) and Ricky Martin were born in 
the city. Other notable residents include writers Giannina Braschi and 
Tomas Blanco, award-winning actors Raúl Juliá and Benicio del Toro, and 
comedian José Miguel Agrelot. Rafael Cordero (1790–1868), was influential 
in the development of Puerto Rican education and has been once renowned[by 
whom?] as " The Father of Public Education in Puerto Rico". The city is 
also the home of contemporary and classic art museums. The Puerto Rico 
Arts Museum owns the largest collection of contemporary art in Puerto Rico, 
housing over 1,100 permanent art pieces and displaying temporary exhibitions 
containing artwork from various locations through Latin America.[58] The 
Puerto Rico Museum of Contemporary Art, located in Santurce, specializes 
in contemporary artwork from Latin America and the Caribbean. The paintings 
displayed in the permanent exhibition are either acquired by the museum's 
administrative personnel or donated by artists and collectors. They are 
judged by a panel of painters, art critics, and scholars before being displayed.[59] 
Other museums such as the Pablo Casals Museum, the Book Museum, Americas 
Museum and the National Gallery display historic items and artwork alongside 
contemporary art.[60][61] Miscellaneous museums such as the Children's 
Museum and the Bacardi Distillery (also known as the "Rum Cathedral") in 
nearby Cataño appeal to different audiences through interactive exhibitions.[62][63] 
As one of Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities, San Juan's government consists 
of two branches, the executive and the legislative. Those citizens eligible 
to vote directly elect a mayor and the municipal assembly for four-year 
terms. The municipal government is housed in City Hall or Casa Alcaldia, 
which is located at 153 San Francisco Street, facing the Plaza de Armas 
at the center of Old San Juan.[64] City Hall was constructed based on Madrid's 
City Hall starting in 1604 and finally completed in 1789.[64] The executive 
branch is headed by a popularly elected mayor. The office is currently 
held by Carmen Yulín Cruz, who was elected at the 2012 general election. 
Before her, Jorge A. Santini held the position for 12 years. In addition 
to running the city's day-to-day operations and supervising associated 
departments, the mayor is responsible for appointing a secretary-auditor 
and a treasurer. San Juan's Municipal Legislature is made up of 17 municipal 
legislators, elected at-large, which represent the city's population.[65] 
San Juan is also the seat of the Puerto Rico Senatorial district I, which 
is represented by two Senators.[66] In 2012, José Nadal Power and Ramón 
Luis Nieves were elected as District Senators.[67] In 2010 there were 201 
slayings in San Juan, a rate of around 50 per 100,000 residents. Law enforcement 
in San Juan is the joint responsibility of the Department of Police and 
Public Safety, also known as the San Juan Police Department and the Puerto 
Rico Police Department.[68] The Municipal Police, originally known as the 
"San Juan Municipal Guard", was created in 1521 and has active military 
and law enforcement functions, until 1980 when act #77 created municipal 
law enforcement agencies in Puerto Rico. It currently employs over 1,000 
sworn officers plus civilian staff.[69] San Juan is home to many of Puerto 
Rico's institutions of higher learning. The University of Puerto Rico Río 
Piedras Campus is located in San Juan, along with the University of Puerto 
Rico's Medical Sciences Campus. Other colleges located in San Juan are 
the University of the Sacred Heart, the Polytechnic University of Puerto 
Rico, the Ana G. Méndez University System's Metropolitan University, the 
Metropolitan Campus of the Inter American University of Puerto Rico, the 
Carlos Albizu University, the Evangelic Seminary of Puerto Rico and the 
Center for Advanced Studies on Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. There are 
smaller colleges located in the city, including the ICPR Junior College, 
the Instituto de Banca y Comercio and the International Junior College, 
located in Santurce.[70] There are also several technical schools based 
in San Juan, including the Technological College of San Juan, the Liceo 
de Artes y Ciencias, Ramirez College of Business and Technology, and the 
Puerto Rico Technical Junior College. The Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music 
and the School of Fine Arts in Old San Juan specialize in education that 
promotes the fine arts and music.[70] Also, San Juan is home to 136[citation 
needed] public schools operated by the Puerto Rico Department of Education. 
Most of the specialized schools operated by the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico are located in San Juan. These schools emphasize topics such as Science 
and Math, Radio and Television, Arts, Trade, Music, and Sports, but also 
include other subjects such as Spanish, English, and Social Studies in 
their curriculum. In addition to dozens of state-run elementary, intermediate, 
and high schools, the government of the city of San Juan operates two bilingual 
schools, including one sports-magnet school, the first municipal-run schools 
in Puerto Rico.[citation needed] Several private schools are located in 
San Juan, including Robinson and St. John's schools in the Condado, Perpetuo 
Socorro in Miramar, St. John's Episcopal, Santa Mónica and Academia San 
Jorge in Santurce, Commonwealth High School, La Merced and Espíritu Santo 
in Hato Rey, Escuela Josefita Monserrate de Selles, San Antonio, Colegio 
San Ignacio de Loyola, San José in Río Piedras and Cupeyville, St. Mary's, 
Boneville and Cupey Maria Montesory School in Cupey. The Port of San Juan 
is the fourth busiest seaport in the Western Hemisphere, ranked among the 
top 17 in the world in terms of container movement. It is also the largest 
home-based cruise port in the world with over a dozen cruise ships. It 
is the second busiest port in cruise volume after Miami. The Metropolitan 
Area is served by two airports. The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, 
San Juan's primary commercial airport, is located eight miles (12.9 km) 
from Old San Juan in the neighboring municipality of Carolina. The airport 
accommodates more than 30 domestic and international airlines and is the 
busiest airport in the Caribbean. It is often referred to as "The Gateway 
to the Caribbean" because it serves as the main connection to the island 
and the rest of the Caribbean for the United States and vice versa. The 
area's secondary airport is the Fernando Ribas Dominicci Airport, which 
is located directly across the San Antonio Creek or Cano San Antonio from 
Old San Juan in the Isla Grande district.[71] Dominicci Airport is used 
mainly by general aviation aircraft, charter flights, and some domestic 
commercial flights. It used to be the city's and also the island of Puerto 
Rico's main international gateway until the opening of Luis Muñoz Marin 
International Airport. It is now also widely used by the Isla Grande Flight 
School and Caribbean Flight Center, the only flight school on the island. 
At 4,300 vehicles per paved mile, San Juan has by far the highest density 
of vehicles on the road of any country in the world.[72] The city is served 
by five limited-access expressways and highways and numerous arterial avenues 
and boulevards, but continues to suffer from severe traffic congestion.[73] 
The Metropolitan Bus Authority (Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses or 
AMA in Spanish) provides daily bus transportation to residents of San Juan, 
Guaynabo, Bayamón, Toa Baja, Trujillo Alto, Cataño and Carolina through 
30 fixed routes. Its fleet consists of 277 regular buses and 35 handicap-accessible 
buses. AMA's ridership is estimated at 112,000 on weekdays.[74] There is 
also a daily ferry service, known as the Cataño Ferry (La Lancha de Cataño), 
which operates between Old San Juan and the town of Cataño.[75] In an attempt 
to decrease vehicle dependency and road congestion, the city built a metro 
system dubbed "Tren Urbano" ("Urban Train"). The 10.7-mile (17.2 km) line 
connects to 16 stations.[76] The project, which opened in late 2004, cost 
$2.25 billion and was more than $1 billion over budget and four years late. 
The Tren Urbano has received less ridership than was originally projected 
and has not significantly reduced the city's automobile traffic, despite 
a reported 7.5% ridership increase in 2006 over 2005. There is a planned 
project to build a "interurban light rail system" connecting the cities 
of San Juan and Caguas.[77] Increased investment in public transportation, 
however, has not changed the fact that San Juan is an automobile reliant 
city and its fast growth has sparked urban sprawl. As of mid-2010, the 
government has approved plans for a redesign of this Puerto Rican city, 
featuring a new mass transit system, new roads and intersections, and more 
beach access points. No cars will be allowed inside the oldest part of 
city (Old San Juan). The plans hope to remedy previous poor urban planning 
in the oldest section of the city, the Isleta, while curbing reliance on 
motor vehicles. The plans for redevelopment also hope to make the city 
more appealing in order to attract new residents, as San Juan has suffered 
from a shrinking population over the past 60 years.[78] San Juan has an 
elaborate system of triage, hospital, and preventive care health services. 
The municipal government sponsors regular health fairs in different areas 
of the city focusing on health care for the elderly and the disabled. There 
are 20 hospitals in San Juan, half of them operated by the government. 
The largest hospital in San Juan and most important of Puerto Rico and 
the Caribbean[citation needed] is the Rio Piedras Medical Center, or Centro 
Medico de Rio Piedras in Spanish. This hospital, founded in 1956, is operated 
by the Medical Services Administration of the Department of Health of Puerto 
Rico. It is made up of eight other hospitals. The city of San Juan operates 
10 hospitals. Of these, nine are Diagnostic and Treatment Centers located 
in communities throughout San Juan. The main hospital is located at Centro 
Medico. These 10 hospitals are: Also, there are 10 private hospitals in 
San Juan. These are: Teams based in San Juan have been notably successful 
in athletic competition. The Santurce Crabbers won the National Superior 
Basketball League championship in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2003 during 
this period being recognized as a dynasty. The San Juan Senators and the 
Santurce Crabbers were the two major baseball teams in the city, winning 
the championship of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League a total 
of seventeen times. The Santurce Crabbers are located third among teams 
with more championships in the Caribbean Series, winning championships 
in the 1951, 1953, 1955, 1993 and 2000 editions of the tournament. The 
city has also been the host of events within the sports community; some 
examples include: The recently built $28-million San Juan Natatorium is 
beginning to attract islandwide and regional swim meets, as well winter 
training by top-rated mainland U.S. colleges and universities, including 
the United States Military Academy at West Point and the United States 
Naval Academy at Annapolis. In July 2007, the San Juan Golf Academy and 
its golf driving range began operating atop the city's former sanitary 
landfill in Puerto Nuevo and will eventually include the city's first and 
only 9-hole golf course. San Juan is twinned with:[89] Nation: States:
