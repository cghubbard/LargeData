Brian Reed Doyle (born January 26, 1955 in Glasgow, Kentucky) is a former 
Major League Baseball infielder who played for the New York Yankees and 
Oakland A's. He played primarily as a second baseman. Although a reserve 
for most of his career, Doyle starred in the 1978 World Series for the 
World Champion Yankees that beat the Los Angeles Dodgers. Doyle was drafted 
by the Texas Rangers in the 1972 amateur draft. Before playing a game for 
the Rangers he was traded to the Yankees along with Greg Pryor in exchange 
for Sandy Alomar.[1] Doyle joined the Yankees in 1978. He played parts 
of three seasons for the Yankees as a reserve infielder through 1980. However, 
when Willie Randolph was injured for the 1978 World Series, Doyle filled 
in as the Yankee second baseman. In six World Series games, he batted .438 
with seven hits in 16 at bats, one double, four runs scored and two runs 
batted ins, helping the Yankees to their second straight World Series victory. 
After the end of the 1980 season, Doyle was selected by the Oakland Athletics 
in the Rule 5 draft. He played for the Athletics in 1981, his last season 
in the Major Leagues. Doyle played 110 games in his career, with a batting 
average of .161 and one home run. His brother, Denny, also played in the 
major leagues. His twin brother, Blake, played only in the minor leagues 
before becoming a major league coach. In 1978, Brian and his brothers founded 
Doyle Baseball, a baseball school.[2] In the 1990s, Doyle was diagnosed 
with leukemia, and was later on diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 2015.[3] 
Doyle is mentioned in the Showtime series Billions, Season 1, Episode 3 
"Yum Time" when hedge fund manager, Bobby Axelrod, gives trusty but untested 
trader, Donny, more responsibility by tripling his accounts saying "You're 
going to be our Brian Doyle" and continues to explain Doyle's .161 lifetime
