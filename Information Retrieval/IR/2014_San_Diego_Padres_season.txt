The 2014 San Diego Padres season was their 46th season in Major League 
Baseball (MLB), and their 10th at Petco Park. They finished the season 
with a 77–85 record, the 11th worst in the majors. After winning the season 
opener and starting the season 1–1, the Padres never returned to .500.[1] 
San Diego entered the season with the highest payroll in franchise history, 
yet still ranked in the bottom third in MLB.[1] They finished the season 
with its best home record (48–33) since the opening of Petco in 2004. They 
tied their World Series team of 1984 with 48 home wins, which had only 
been exceeded by its 1978 team and their pennant-winning 1998 squad.[2]
