Home Away The Metropolitanos of Havana was a baseball team in the Cuban 
National Series. The Metros, also known as the Guerreros (Warriors), had 
historically been a poor team, though they were ostensibly the heir to 
the Habana teams of the pre-revolutionary Cuban League. It was one of two 
teams based in the city of Havana – the other being the more successful 
Industriales. Frequently, the National Series removed several of the best 
players from the Metropolitanos squad and sent them to Industriales.[1] 
Players including René Arocha, Osvaldo Fernández, Yasser Gomez, Enrique 
Diaz, Yadel Martí and Antonio Scull had begun their careers with the Guerreros, 
only to be sent later to the Leones. The Metropolitanos ceased operations 
at the end of the 2011–12 Series Nacional. Also: Osvaldo Fernández Guerra,
