As Player As Manager John Henry Neun (October 28, 1900 – March 28, 1990) 
was an American first baseman for the Detroit Tigers and the Boston Braves 
from 1925 to 1931. Although never an everyday player (he never played more 
than 97 games a season), Neun entered baseball immortality on May 31, 1927 
against the Cleveland Indians, when he caught a line drive from Homer Summa, 
stepped on first to retire Charlie Jamieson, and despite shouts from his 
shortstop to throw him the ball, raced towards second base to retire Glenn 
Myatt, completing the seventh unassisted triple play in MLB history, and 
the first such play to end a game. Neun turned the triple play as a first 
baseman and not a second baseman or shortstop, one day after Jimmy Cooney 
of the Chicago Cubs had done so. On July 9, 1927, playing against the New 
York Yankees, Neun had five base hits and five stolen bases.[1] He is the 
only player since at least 1914 to have at least five of each in one game.[2] 
Nevertheless, he stole only 41 bases in his career. A switch-hitter who 
threw left-handed, Neun batted .289 with two home runs in 945 at bats during 
his seven-year Major League Baseball career. In 1935, after retiring as 
a player, Neun began managing in the New York Yankees' farm system, and 
from 1938 through 1941, he piloted the AA Newark Bears, winning International 
League regular season championships in 1938 (104 wins) and 1941 (100 wins) 
and the 1938 playoff title. He then spent two seasons as skipper of the 
Yanks' other top affiliate, the Kansas City Blues of the American Association 
(where he won another regular-season pennant, in 1942), before joining 
the New York coaching staff in 1944. In September 1946, he was hired as 
the manager of the Yankees, replacing Bill Dickey. His stint in New York 
lasted only 14 games (8-6) through the third-place Yankees' final regular 
season game. During the offseason, he was hired by the Cincinnati Reds 
as the successor to Hall of Fame manager Bill McKechnie. Neun had a record 
of 117–137 in parts of two seasons. He was dismissed after 100 games in 
1948 in favor of Bucky Walters. He continued working in the game, and into 
his eighties was a scout and instructor for the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite 
their joint fame, Neun and Jimmy Cooney never actually met, as they were 
playing in different leagues. (They did face each other in a minor league 
game in 1929, but didn't exchange words.) Finally, nearly six decades later, 
in 1986, Sports Illustrated arranged a conference call between the two.[3] 
Neun died of pancreatic cancer in his birthplace of Baltimore at age 89.[4]
