Yankees HOPE Week (Helping Others Persevere & Excel Week) is an annual 
program run by the New York Yankees that celebrates "individuals, families, 
or organizations worthy of support".[1] Every Yankees player participates 
in the program with the "goal [of] personally connect[ing] with individuals 
in the settings of their greatest personal accomplishments."[2] It was 
started in 2009 "with the purpose of performing acts of goodwill to provide 
encouragement to more than just the recipient of the gesture."[3] It takes 
place every year in the summer. HOPE Week was started in 2009. The Yankees 
said "this event is unique in that every player on the roster, along with 
Manager Joe Girardi, will participate."[4] In 2009, the program, which 
ran from July 20–24, honored a United States Army veteran of the 82nd Airborne 
Division who lost use of his arms and legs to Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS). 
The veteran and his wife and son were invited to watch batting practice 
from the field before the game. They were surprised by a party in a suite 
in Yankee Stadium with several players and their friends and family.[5] 
Several Yankees surprised two men who overcame learning and developmental 
diseases at their place of work at a law firm in New York, where they are 
mail room employees.[6] Other Yankees visited a sixth-grade Little Leaguer 
who has cerebral palsy but helps coach his team.[7][8] After the July 24th 
game, the Yankees hosted a nighttime carnival for people from Camp Sundown, 
which is for those who suffer from Xeroderma Pigmentosum, a rare disease 
in which the body cannot repair cells damaged by UV light; sufferers have 
to avoid exposure to sunlight.[9] The kids arrived at the game after sundown, 
but because of a rain delay, the game had not started, so they saw the 
game and did the event with the Yankees until sunrise.[10] The 2010 program 
ran from August 16–20. Manager Joe Girardi visited Jane Lang, a blind woman 
who attends about 30 Yankees game a season, at her home and invited her 
to meet the players at that evening's game.[11][12] A man from Sierra Leone, 
who has provided for his family since he was eight, immigrated to the U.S., 
and received a scholarship to go to college threw out the ceremonial first 
pitch before a game, while a 13-year-old quadruple amputee was thrown a 
pool party with several Yankees.[13] In 2011, the Yankees held a barbecue 
with children from Tuesday's Children, an organization that supports children 
who lost parents on September 11th.[14] Several Yankees (including Derek 
Jeter, Jorge Posada, and CC Sabathia) took survivors of the 2010 Haiti 
earthquake on a tour of New York City and met Archbishop Timothy Dolan.[15] 
Other Yankees went to a Broadway performance by a 27-year-old who survived
