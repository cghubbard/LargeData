Busch Memorial Stadium, also known as Busch Stadium II, was a multi-purpose 
sports facility in St. Louis, Missouri that operated for 40 years, from 
1966 through 2005.[5] The stadium served as the home of the St. Louis Cardinals 
National League baseball team for its entire operating existence, while 
also serving as home to the National Football League's Cardinals team for 
22 seasons, from 1966 through 1987. It opened four days after the last 
baseball game was played at Sportsman's Park (which had also been known 
since 1953 as Busch Stadium). The stadium was designed by Sverdrup & Parcel 
and built by Grün & Bilfinger.[6] Edward Durell Stone designed the roof, 
a 96-arch "Crown of Arches".[7] The Crown echoed the Gateway Arch, which 
had been completed only a year before Busch Stadium opened. It was one 
of the first multipurpose "cookie-cutter" facilities built in the United 
States, popular from the early 1960s through the early 1980s. Its final 
event was the sixth game of the 2005 NLCS on October 19.[8] The stadium 
was demolished by wrecking ball in late 2005 and part of its former footprint 
is occupied by its replacement stadium—the new Busch Stadium (aka Busch 
Stadium III), located just south. The baseball Cardinals had played at 
Sportsman's Park since 1920. They originally were tenants of the St. Louis 
Browns of the American League. Although the Cardinals had long since passed 
the Browns as St. Louis' favorite team, they had wanted to get a stadium 
of their own as early as 1920. In 1958, Charles Farris, the city's head 
of development, proposed a new stadium downtown as the core of a plan to 
revive a 31-block area of the business district. The original design of 
the stadium had called for a baseball-only format, but the design was altered 
to accommodate the football Cardinals, who had moved in from Chicago after 
the 1959 season and shared Sportsman's Park/Busch Stadium with the baseball 
Cardinals.[citation needed] With support from the local Chamber of Commerce, 
the Civic Center Redevelopment Corporation was established in September 
1959; it was given power of eminent domain, which it used to condemn the 
city's small Chinatown, the Grand Theater (a strip club), and various warehouses 
and flophouses.[1] Groundbreaking occurred on May 25, 1964,[2] and construction 
took just under two years. The plan also included parking garages, a hotel 
(a Stouffer's hotel), and office buildings.[1] A few years later, it also 
became the new home of the Spanish Pavilion from the 1964 New York World's 
Fair.[9] The stadium opened on May 12, 1966, one month into the baseball 
season, as Civic Center Busch Memorial Stadium. However, the "Civic Center" 
part was almost never used, and most people called it simply Busch Memorial 
Stadium. The stadium's grass was replaced with AstroTurf in 1970,[10] in 
part because St. Louis' notoriously hot summers made it difficult to keep 
the grass alive. The Cardinals retained the traditional dirt skin infield 
for eight seasons, then converted to sliding pits when the surface was 
replaced for the 1978 baseball season.[11][12] With artificial turf, the 
playing conditions at Busch Stadium were among the hottest in baseball,[13] 
with temperatures well above the local official readings.[14][15] Anheuser-Busch 
bought the stadium in 1981 for $53 million and renamed it simply Busch 
Stadium; the price included the parking garages.[1] Over the years the 
grounds became home to bronze statues of Stan Musial, Enos Slaughter, Dizzy 
Dean, Rogers Hornsby, Red Schoendienst, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, James "Cool 
Papa" Bell, George Sisler, Jack Buck, and Ozzie Smith.[citation needed] 
Following Busch's last 1995 event—the Rams' October 22 game prior to the 
opening of the now-Dome at America's Center—the Cardinals retrofitted it 
into a baseball-only stadium. A large section of the upper deck outfield 
seats was closed, replaced with a hand-operated scoreboard and flags commemorating 
the Cardinals' retired numbers. The stadium's original natural grass field 
was restored, and the outfield walls were repainted green from their original 
blue.[16] Busch Memorial Stadium was originally slated to be imploded like 
most modern-day stadium demolitions to be able to finish construction on 
the new stadium in time for the 2006 season. Due to fear of damaging the 
nearby Metro subway and stadium station, it was decided to tear down the 
stadium with a wrecking ball, piece-by-piece, over a period of a few weeks. 
Demolition of the stadium began at 3:07 p.m. CST on November 7 and was 
completed shortly after midnight on December 8, 2005. Part of the footprint 
of the old stadium is now occupied by the outfield of the current stadium. 
The Cardinals had planned to build Ballpark Village on the site of the 
stadium ($320 million for the first phase). It was to consist of boutiques 
and restaurants, condominium apartments anchored by the new headquarters 
of Centene Corporation — all to be built in time for the All-Star Game 
in 2009. None of the construction had occurred until groundbreaking ceremonies 
on February 8, 2013, and locals derisively referred to its rain soaked 
unfinished status before that date as "Lake DeWitt"—after Cardinal President 
William DeWitt, Jr. The Cardinals in March 2009 announced the site would 
be used for a softball field and parking during the game.[17] Busch Stadium 
was also the home of the St. Louis Cardinals of the National Football League 
for 22 seasons, from 1966 through 1987. The stadium was one of the smaller 
facilities in the NFL, never seating more than 60,000. After efforts to 
get a larger stadium failed, owner Bill Bidwill moved the team to Phoenix, 
Arizona after the 1987 season. The football Cardinals never hosted a playoff 
game during their 28 seasons in St. Louis. The "Gridbirds" made only three 
playoff appearances during that stretch, losing on the road against the 
Minnesota Vikings in 1974, Los Angeles Rams in 1975, and Green Bay Packers 
in 1982. They did win the third place Playoff Bowl after the 1964 season, 
upsetting Vince Lombardi's Packers 31–24 at the Orange Bowl in Miami. Busch 
Stadium was also briefly the home of the St. Louis Rams, who relocated 
from Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California. Completion of their new home, 
the new and nearby Trans World Dome (later renamed the Dome at America's 
Center) was delayed, so the Rams played the first half of the 1995 season 
at Busch Stadium, with four home games, the last on October 22. The new 
indoor venue hosted its first NFL game on November 12, 1995. In its opening 
year, Busch Stadium hosted the All-Star Game, a 2–1 National League victory 
in 10 innings, most for the notable humidity and 105 °F (41 °C) temperatures. 
The stadium hosted World Series games in six different seasons: 1967, 1968, 
1982, 1985, 1987, and 2004. The Cardinals won the World Series in 1967 
and 1982 while playing in the stadium (the seventh game of the 1982 Series 
was won at Busch). The 1968 and 2004 World Series were clinched in Busch 
Stadium by visitors: the Detroit Tigers in the seventh game and the Boston 
Red Sox in a four-game sweep, respectively. The stadium was also the site 
of Mark McGwire's historic 62nd home run of the 1998 season that broke 
Roger Maris' single-season record, and also of McGwire's 70th of that season, 
for a record which lasted until Barry Bonds surpassed it in 2001. The dimensions 
in center and the power alleys had been altered from time to time over 
the years. Initially the park was very favorable to pitchers, with spacious 
outfield dimensions. Consequently, its design (as well as the Astroturf 
surface) was favorable to the Cardinals' style of play for most of the 
time from the 1960s through the 1990s, which emphasized good baserunning 
and extra-base hits. Later changes attempted to make the outfield better 
balanced between pitching and power hitting.[12] Before the 1996 season, 
the stadium was retrofitted to become a baseball-only stadium. Part of 
the top deck in center field was permanently closed, and in 1997, flags 
were put in place to honor the team's retired numbers and pennants.[19] 
Even before then, the stadium had come under less scorn from baseball purists 
than other cookie-cutter stadiums built during the same era, partly because 
the "crown of arches" gave it a more traditional look than its cousins.[12] 
The baseball diamond was oriented southeast by east (home to center field); 
the new stadium is aligned east-northeast, the recommended orientation.[20]
