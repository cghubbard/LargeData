Eddie Einhorn (January 3, 1936 – February 24, 2016) was minority owner 
and Vice Chairman of the Chicago White Sox. Einhorn grew up in a Jewish 
family in Paterson, New Jersey, the son of Mae (née Lippman) and Harold 
B. Einhorn[1] and has resided in Alpine, New Jersey.[2] Einhorn produced 
the nationally syndicated radio broadcast of the NCAA Men's Division I 
Basketball Championship in 1958. In 1960, he founded the TVS Television 
Network to telecast college basketball games to regional networks at a 
time that the sport was of no interest to the national networks. The first 
broadcast was a semi-final game between Bradley University vs. St. Bonaventure 
University in the 1960 National Invitation Tournament from Madison Square 
Garden. Einhorn helped put together the first national broadcast of college 
basketball for the Game of the Century between the Houston Cougars and 
UCLA Bruins in 1968. He later sold his interest in the network and became 
the head of CBS Sports. Later, he would co-found subscription TV channel 
Sportsvision, which, after a number of sales and restructurings, eventually 
became cable network Sportschannel. Einhorn's TVS network carried the World 
Football League in its inaugural 1974 season. He would later emerge in 
the United States Football League; as the proposed owner of the league's 
dormant Chicago franchise, Einhorn was one of the most outspoken supporters 
of the proposed, but ultimately failed, move to fall in 1986. He was formerly 
the owner of the IWA wrestling promotion in United States in 1975. The 
promotion was originally intended to be the first one to run cards nationally 
and promoted mainly in the midwest and even ran cards in the Carolinas. 
Einhorn died on February 24, 2016 at the age of 80 from complications following 
a stroke.[3] During the 2016 season, the White Sox will wear a memorial 
patch on their uniforms in honor of Einhorn, a black diamond with "Eddie"
