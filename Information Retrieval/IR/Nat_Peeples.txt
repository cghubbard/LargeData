Nathaniel Peeples (June 29, 1926 – August 30, 2012) was a professional 
baseball outfielder in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. He played in the Negro 
Leagues and in minor league baseball. Peeples was born in Memphis, Tennessee. 
He attended LeMoyne-Owen College. He played for the Memphis Red Sox (in 
1948),[1] Kansas City Monarchs and Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American 
League.[2] Peeples spent ten seasons in the minor leagues, from 1951 to 
1960. He began his career in the Brooklyn Dodgers system, playing there 
from 1951 to 1953. He joined the Milwaukee Braves system in 1953 and remained 
there until 1959. He briefly joined the Chicago Cubs system in 1959 and 
last played in the Mexican League in 1960.[3] In 1954, Peeples played briefly 
for the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association. Though he played 
only two games with the team, his stay was notable for he became the only

Braves of the South Atlantic League, prematurely ending his stay with the 
Atlanta squad after a two-week stint.[4] Other sources say it was Peeples' 
lack of ability that earned his demotion to Jacksonville.[2] In 1957, with 
the Corpus Christi Clippers of the Big State League, Peeples hit .314 with 
25 home runs, 116 runs scored and 99 RBI, leading the league in the latter 
two categories and finishing second in home runs, behind Don Miles' 28. 
The following year, with the Austin Senators of the Texas League, he hit 
.259 with 21 home runs, 79 RBI and 23 stolen bases, finishing second in 
the league in steals, behind Rod Kanehl.[3] Peeples died at the age of
