Louis Rodman Whitaker, Jr. (born May 12, 1957), nicknamed "Sweet Lou", 
is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) player. Whitaker was a second baseman 
for the Detroit Tigers from 1977 to 1995. Along with teammate Alan Trammell, 
Whitaker was part of the longest running "double play" combination in major 
league history. Whitaker first played with shortstop Alan Trammell while 
with the old Double-A Montgomery Rebels. The two first played together 
in the major leagues when they were both called up to Detroit at the end 
of the 1977 season. Both players became starters by the end of April 1978. 
They would remain teammates until Whitaker retired in 1995. Trammell and 
Whitaker also made a cameo appearance together on the television show Magnum, 
P.I. starring Tom Selleck, as themselves, during the 1983 season.[1] In 
1978, Whitaker won the American League Rookie of the Year Award, hitting 
.285 with 71 runs, and a .361 on-base percentage. Whitaker enjoyed a strong 
season in 1983, hitting for a .320 average with 12 home runs, 72 runs batted 
in (RBI), and 94 runs. That year he made the first of five consecutive 
All-Star appearances. In 1984, Whitaker and the Tigers won the World Series. 
The day Detroit clinched the Series, the second eldest of Whitaker's four 
daughters was born. In 1985, Whitaker set a record for Detroit second basemen 
with 21 home runs and, in 1986, was a member of a Tigers infield in which 
every member hit at least twenty home runs. He hit a career-best 28 homers 
in 1989, one of four times he reached the 20-HR plateau, upping his record 
for the most homers in a season by a Tiger second baseman. Whitaker now 
shares the season record with Ian Kinsler, who hit 28 homers in 2016 as 
the Tigers regular second baseman.[2] Whitaker reached two career milestones 
in 1992, recording both his 2,000th hit and his 200th home run. Along with 
his American League contemporaries Frank White and Willie Randolph, Whitaker 
set the standard for defensive play at his position throughout the 1980s.[citation

hit a ball over the roof of Tiger Stadium.[citation needed] Whitaker was 
an immensely popular player in Detroit and during his career was greeted 
by chants of "LOUUUUUUUUUU", which sounded a lot like boos at Tiger Stadium. 
He was an effective leadoff man, adept at drawing walks (averaging 81 BB 
per 162 games), quick on the bases, and able to drive the ball with power 
to all fields. In his 19-year career, Whitaker batted .276 with 244 home 
runs, 1,084 RBI, 1,386 runs, 2,369 hits, 420 doubles, 65 triples, and 143 
stolen bases in 2,390 games. He also recorded a 1.089 walk-to-strikeout 
ratio. He retired following the 1995 season and became an instructor with 
the Tigers during their spring training sessions in Lakeland, Florida, 
where he helped coaching hitters through the 2009 season. He and the Tigers 
parted ways in 2010 by mutual agreement.[3] Whitaker was selected to the 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game five times: 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 
and 1987. In the 1985 All-Star Game, Whitaker forgot to pack his uniform. 
Making this discovery just before the game, he had to make do with replica 
merchandise available for purchase at the park. He obtained an adjustable 
mesh hat and a blank jersey. He finished off his outfit by scrawling his 
number on the back in magic marker (or, by some accounts, having a fan 
do so for him). The Smithsonian requested the jersey and it remains a part 
of their collection.[4] During the 1986 All-Star Game, Whitaker was one 
of the five players struck out consecutively by National League pitcher 
Fernando Valenzuela, tying Carl Hubbell's mark. Whitaker ranks among the 
Tigers' all-time leaders in many categories, including the following: Although 
the team had not officially retired Whitaker's jersey, there was some debate[5] 
among fans on social media outlets and on sportstalk radio when it was 
announced in August 2013 that newly acquired infielder Jos√© Iglesias would 
take over the number. Iglesias was the first player to wear jersey #1 since 
Whitaker's retirement in 1995. Whitaker is ineligible for election into 
the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers' Association of America; 
he did not receive the required five percent of the votes in his first 
year of eligibility (in 2001). Despite having statistics comparable to 
other second basemen in the Hall of Fame (including contemporary Ryne Sandberg, 
a third-year inductee), Whitaker was dismissed from the ballot after receiving 
fifteen votes, or 2.9%. This surprised many observers, including Bill James,[6] 
who named Whitaker the thirteenth-best second baseman of all time in The 
Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract. Whitaker will be eligible for
