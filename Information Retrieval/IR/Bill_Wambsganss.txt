William Adolf Wambsganss (March 19, 1894 – December 8, 1985) was a second 
baseman in Major League Baseball. From 1914 through 1926, Wambsganss played 
for the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, and Philadelphia Athletics. 
He is best remembered for making one of the most spectacular defensive 
plays in World Series history, an unassisted triple play. Wambsganss was 
a native of Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Concordia College and studied 
for the ministry before entering professional baseball.[1] In a 13-season 
career, Wambsganss posted a .259 batting average with seven home runs and 
519 run batted in in 1492 games played. Due to his long surname, Wambsganss 
was often called "Wamby" by headline writers. Wambsganss was the regular 
second baseman of the Cleveland Indians for ten years. Over a thirteen-year 
Major League career, he amassed 4,269 assists with 3,420 putouts and turned 
605 double plays. He committed only 375 errors in 8,064 chances for a significant 
.954 fielding percentage. Batting from the second or eighth spot, Wambsganss 
averaged 74.2 runs per year from 1919 to 1923. He scored a career-high 
89 runs in 1922. He hit a career-high .295 in 1918 and hit .290 in 1923, 
his last season with Cleveland. He was sent to the Boston Red Sox in the 
same trade that brought first baseman George Burns to the Indians. In 1924 
with Boston, Wambsganss hit .275 and collected career-highs in hits (174) 
and runs (93). After a sub-par season in 1925, he was sold to the Philadelphia 
Athletics. He finished his Major League career with the A's in 1926, batting 
.352 in 54 games. In game five of the 1920 World Series played at League 
Park, Wambsganss caught a fifth-inning line drive batted by Clarence Mitchell, 
stepped on second base to retire Pete Kilduff, and tagged Otto Miller coming 
from first base, to complete the first, and to date, only unassisted triple 
play in World Series history. Earlier in the game, Wambsganss' teammate 
Elmer Smith hit the first grand slam in World Series history off Brooklyn 
Robins pitcher Burleigh Grimes, in the first inning with none out. The 
historic blast scored Charlie Jamieson, Wambsganss, Tris Speaker, and Smith. 
Brooklyn fell to the Indians in an 8–1 loss. Cleveland winning pitcher 
Jim Bagby helped himself by hitting a three-run home run in the third. 
It was the first home run hit by a pitcher in modern World Series history. 
After the World Series, Cleveland fans presented Wambsganss with a medal 
to commemorate the unassisted triple play. The medal was lost the following 
April while Wambsganss was traveling aboard a train.[2] After his last 
year in the Major Leagues, Wambsganss played for Triple-A Kansas City of 
the American Association. After coaching New Orleans of the Southern League 
in 1930, he returned to the Kansas City club as manager in 1931.[3] Additionally, 
he managed for four seasons in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball 
League (AAGPBL) for the Fort Wayne Daisies (1945–46) and the Muskegon Lassies 
(1947–48).[4] In November 1988, Wambsganss and the rest of the AAGPBL received 
recognition when the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New 
York dedicated a permanent display to the entire league.[citation needed] 
The gymnasium at Concordia Theological Seminary is named in honor of him. 
When interviewed in the 1960s by Lawrence Ritter for the classic oral history 
The Glory of Their Times, Wambsganss recalled: "Funny thing, I played in 
the big leagues for 13 years, 1914 through 1926, and the only thing that 
anybody seems to remember is that once I made an unassisted triple play 
in a World Series. Many don't even remember the team I was on, or the position 
I played, or anything. Just Wambsganss-unassisted triple play! You'd think 
I was born on the day before and died on the day after." Wambsganss died 
of heart failure in Lakewood, Ohio on December 10, 1985. He was 91 years 
old. Wambsganss was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland.[5] In the 
1958 film Teacher's Pet, Clark Gable and Gig Young argue whether Wambsganss'
