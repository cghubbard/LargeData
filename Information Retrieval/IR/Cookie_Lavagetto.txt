As player As manager Harry Arthur "Cookie" Lavagetto (December 1, 1912 
– August 10, 1990) was a third baseman, manager and coach in American Major 
League Baseball. He was the pinch hitter whose double ruined Bill Bevens' 
no-hitter in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series and gave his Brooklyn Dodgers 
a victory over the New York Yankees, a game known as The Cookie Game. On 
October 3, 1947 at Ebbets Field, Bevens was ahead 2–1 going into the bottom 
of the ninth inning, and got two outs. He had surrendered no hits — an 
unprecedented World Series achievement at the time — but two runners were 
on base from Bevens' ninth and tenth walks of the game. Lavagetto was summoned 
by Dodger pilot Burt Shotton to hit for Eddie Stanky, and with no balls 
and one strike cracked an opposite-field double off the right field wall 
to break up the no-hitter and score the two Dodger runners (pinch runners 
Al Gionfriddo and Eddie Miksis) for a 3–2 Brooklyn win. It was Lavagetto's 
only hit of the series (won by the Yankees in seven games), and his last 
as a big leaguer. Lavagetto was born in Oakland, California. Nicknamed 
"Cookie" after an owner of the Oakland Oaks, his first professional team, 
he played ten seasons in the National League with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1934–36) and Brooklyn Dodgers (1937–41; 1946–47), missing four full seasons 
due to military service during World War II. A right-handed batter and 
thrower, he hit .269 in 1,043 games; his best season was 1939, when he 
hit .300 with 87 runs batted in for Brooklyn. After being released by the 
Dodgers following the 1947 Series, Lavagetto returned to Oakland to finish 
his playing career with the Oaks (1948–50). When Oakland manager Chuck 
Dressen was named the field leader of the Dodgers in 1951, Lavagetto accompanied 
him and returned to Brooklyn as one of his coaches. He was an aide to Dressen 
with Brooklyn (1951–53) and the Pacific Coast League Oaks (1954), and followed 
him a third time as a member of the coaching staff when Dressen became 
manager of the Washington Senators in 1955.[1] But on May 7, 1957, with 
the Senators foundering in last place, Dressen was fired and Lavagetto 
named his successor. The team improved slightly, but finished last in 1957, 
1958 and 1959. Finally, in 1960, Lavagetto's Senators rose to fifth place 
in the eight-team American League. The club featured promising young players 
such as Harmon Killebrew, Jim Kaat, Earl Battey and Bob Allison, as well 
as veteran pitcher Camilo Pascual, just entering his prime. But the Senators' 
encouraging 1960 season came too late to keep the franchise in Washington; 
owner Calvin Griffith moved the club to Minneapolis–St. Paul, where it 
became the Minnesota Twins. Lavagetto was the first manager in Twins' history, 
but he did not finish the 1961 season. With the Twins mired in ninth place 
in the new ten-team AL, he took a seven-game leave of absence in early 
June and then returned to the helm. But he was fired June 23 with the club 
still in ninth place. He was replaced by coach Sam Mele, under whom the 
Twins became pennant contenders in 1962 (finishing in second place to the 
Yankees) and pennant winners in 1965. Lavagetto, as manager for the so-called 
"Griffs", won 271 and lost 384 (.414). Lavagetto then returned to the coaching 
ranks with the New York Mets (1962–63), and — back home in the Bay Area 
— the San Francisco Giants (1964–67). He died in his sleep at his home
