Richard J. "Dickey" Pearce (February 29, 1836 â€“ September 18, 1908) was 
an American professional baseball player[1] and one of the sport's most 
famous early figures. He was born in Brooklyn, New York, and began playing 
with the Brooklyn Atlantics in 1856. He continued his career in the National 
Association and the early years of Major League Baseball. It is possible 
Pearce was one of the first baseball players to earn money for playing 
the game professionally. Pearce is given credit for pioneering the shortstop 
position. Pearce introduced his "tricky hit" to baseball, known today as 
the bunt. For much of his career, the rules permitted the ball to roll 
foul and still be a hit.[2] Pearce played professionally for 22 years, 
spanning the generation from the game's beginnings to the National League. 
In the June 30, 1868 edition of the St. Louis Times, the paper said of 
him: "Pearce has been noted as a superior shortstop for ten years and to-day 
has no equal in the base ball field. He bats with great judgment and safety..."
