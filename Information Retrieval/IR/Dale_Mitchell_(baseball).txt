Loren Dale Mitchell (August 23, 1921 – January 5, 1987) was an American 
left fielder in Major League Baseball. From 1946 through 1956, Mitchell 
played for the Cleveland Indians (1946–1956) and Brooklyn Dodgers (1956). 
He batted and threw left-handed. A native of Colony, Oklahoma, Mitchell 
was a standout at the University of Oklahoma from 1942 to 1946, with a 
career batting average of .467 and a senior season average of .507. Both 
marks are still Sooner records. Mainly a line drive hitter to all parts 
of the field, Mitchell hit .432 in 11 games for the Indians in his rookie 
season in 1946. He became a regular in 1947 and hit .300 or better six 
of the next seven seasons. In 1948, Mitchell hit for a career-high .336 
average, had 204 hits, led the league in singles (162), and led the Indians 
to victory in the 1948 World Series. He finished third in the 1948 American 
League batting race behind Ted Williams (.369) and Lou Boudreau (.355). 
In 1949, Mitchell led the AL in hits (203), singles (161) and triples (23), 
struck out only 11 times in 640 at-bats, and made his first appearance 
in the All-Star Game. He received his second All-Star nod in 1952, and 
in 1954 led the Indians to an AL record 111 wins in a 154-game season and 
the American League pennant. Mitchell posted a career .312 batting average, 
41 home runs and 403 RBIs in eleven seasons in major league baseball. For 
the period between 1943 and 1960, only Williams and Stan Musial hit for 
higher averages. A good contact hitter as well, he struck out only 119 
times in 3,984 at-bats and received 346 walks, for an outstanding 2.91 
walk-to-strikeout ratio, the eighth best ratio in major league history. 
Mitchell played for the Cleveland Indians in all but 19 of the 1127 regular-season 
games in which he appeared. Near the end of the 1956 season, the Brooklyn 
Dodgers purchased Mitchell's contract from Cleveland. Mitchell is perhaps 
best remembered, however unfairly, for making the final out in Don Larsen's 
perfect game during the 1956 World Series for the New York Yankees against 
Mitchell's new team, the Dodgers. Mitchell, pinch-hitting for Brooklyn 
pitcher Sal Maglie, took a called third strike to end the only perfect 
game in Series history. Mitchell, who is tied for seventh place as one 
of the all-time toughest hitters to strike out (34-1 ratio), always maintained 
that the third strike he took was really a ball. In his final at-bat as 
a big leaguer, he grounded out pinch-hitting in Game Seven of the Series, 
which the Yankees won. Dale Mitchell died in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1987 at 
the age of 65. The L. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park at the University of
