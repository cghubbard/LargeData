Robert Keith Dibble (born January 24, 1964) is an American former Major 
League Baseball (MLB) pitcher and television analyst. Between 1988 and 
1995, Dibble played for the Cincinnati Reds, Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee 
Brewers. He was a two-time All-Star who recorded 89 saves during his career. 
Since retiring as a player, Dibble has held several roles in sports television 
broadcasting. Dibble was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He attended catholic 
St. Thomas Jr. High school. He is a graduate of Southington High School 
in Southington, Connecticut. Dibble's father, Walt Dibble, was a longtime 
radio news director at WDRC and later WTIC in Hartford, Connecticut. Dibble 
was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round of the 1983 amateur 
draft, and he made his debut with the Reds on June 29, 1988. On June 4, 
1989, Dibble struck out three batters on nine pitches in the eighth inning 
of a 5–3 win over the San Diego Padres. Dibble is one of 41 pitchers in 
Major League history to accomplish the nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning, 
a feat known as an immaculate inning. He was an MLB All-Star in 1990 and 
1991, and was the 1990 NLCS Most Valuable Player (along with fellow "Nasty 
Boy" Randy Myers). In 1990, Dibble and the Reds won the World Series by 
beating the Oakland Athletics in four consecutive games. Dibble recorded 
his 500th career strikeout in fewer innings—368—than any other pitcher 
in modern baseball history up to that point (a record that is currently 
held by Craig Kimbrel). During his career Dibble was known for his temper. 
During a game in July 1989, he hit Mets second basemen Tim Teufel in the 
back with a pitch; Teufel then charged Dibble, causing a benches clearing 
brawl. After saving a game in April 1991 despite giving up two runs in 
relief, Dibble threw a baseball 400 feet into the center-field seats at 
Cincinnati, inadvertently striking a woman.[1][2][3] He was also involved 
in a brawl in 1991 with Astros shortstop Eric Yelding.[2][4] Later in the 
1991 season, he was caught attempting to throw a baseball into the back 
of Cubs outfielder Doug Dascenzo as he ran down the first base line and 
was subsequently ejected from the game.[5] Dibble also was involved in 
a brawl with manager Lou Piniella in the Reds clubhouse after a game in 
1992.[6] Dibble required surgery to his pitching arm in 1994, and missed 
the entire season as a result. Dibble signed with the Milwaukee Brewers 
and also played with the Chicago White Sox. He signed with the Chicago 
Cubs at the end of the 1995 season, but did not appear in a game. He signed 
with the Florida Marlins for the 1996 season, but missed the entire year 
due to injury,[7] and retired soon after. In 1998, Dibble joined ESPN as 
a baseball analyst, working mostly on Dan Patrick's radio show. He worked 
on The Best Damn Sports Show Period as a co-host until 2008, when he left 
to join FOX on their Saturday baseball program as an analyst. Dibble also 
spends time as a co-host/analyst of First Pitch on XM Channel 175/Sirius 
channel 210. He formerly hosted The Show (on the same channel) with Jody 
McDonald. Dibble served as co-analyst (with Kevin Kennedy) for FOXSports.com 
on a weekly video segment entitled "Around the Bases." Dibble also is a 
co-host with former Major League player Denny Hocking on Fox Sports Radio 
Sunday night programming. In 2009, Dibble signed a three-year contract 
to replace Don Sutton as the color voice of the Washington Nationals on 
MASN.[8] While broadcasting a game in August 2010, Dibble drew negative 
attention for focusing on a group of female spectators in the Nationals 
crowd, and questioning their focus on the game.[9][10] He later apologized 
for the comments.[11] Later in the month, Dibble criticized Nationals rookie 
pitcher Stephen Strasburg for missing a start due to an injury: "Suck it 
up, kid. This is your profession. You chose to be a baseball player. You 
can't have the cavalry come in and save your butt every time you feel a 
little stiff shoulder, sore elbow."[11][12] It was revealed shortly afterward 
that Strasburg had torn an elbow ligament and required Tommy John surgery.[13][14] 
Dibble took a few days off from MASN after making the comments, and on 
September 1, 2010, MASN announced that Dibble would no longer be calling 
Nationals games.[15][16][17] After losing his job with the Nationals, Dibble 
apologized for the Strasburg comments on his radio show.[18] In April 2011, 
Dibble said in an interview on FoxSports.com that the reason for his dismissal 
was because of an email Strasburg's father sent to the Lerner Family, the 
owners of the Nationals.[19] Dibble also continued to express his belief 
that Strasburg should have pitched through his pain.[20][21] Strasburg 
denied the claim about his father's e-mail, and Stan Kasten, the president 
of the Nationals, called Dibble's account "fictional" and "sad".[21][22] 
As of October 31, 2011, Dibble became a member of Mike North's talk radio 
show. Dibble had a brief stint as the varsity baseball head coach at Calabasas 
High School in Calabasas, California.[23] He was fired from his head coaching 
job on March 27, 2013, only ten games into the season.[24] As of December 
18, 2013, he, along with Amy Van Dyken, were replaced on Fox Sports Radio's 
Fox Sports Tonight. Dibble currently calls Los Angeles Angels games for 
Compass Media.[25] On March 27, 2014, Dibble became the host of the 3-7PM 
(Eastern) sports talk show on WUCS 97.9 FM and WAVZ 1300 AM in the ESPN 
stations in Hartford and New Haven, CT respectively. He joined interim 
host Paul Nanos who filled in when Mike Bower’s contract was not renewed. 
Up until the end of October the show was billed as “The Rob Dibble Show 
with Paul Nanos”. In October, the show was renamed “The Rob Dibble Show”.[26]
