Michael Brent Cuddyer (/kəˈdaɪər/; born March 27, 1979) is an American 
former professional baseball outfielder who played 15 seasons in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Colorado Rockies, and New 
York Mets. He batted and threw right-handed. Cuddyer was a two-time MLB 
All-Star, and won a Silver Slugger Award in 2013, when he led the National 
League in batting average. Cuddyer announced his retirement after the 2015 
season. Cuddyer was born in Norfolk, Virginia and is a 1997 graduate of 
Great Bridge High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he was a standout 
athlete in baseball, basketball, and football as well as student body president 
and National Honor Society member.[1] Cuddyer was named Virginia's Player 
of the Year and Gatorade National baseball Player of the Year in 1997. 
He was also a member of USA Today's All-Star and the USA Junior National 
teams in 1997. During his high school career, he played American Legion 
Baseball and was named the 2014 American Legion Graduate of the Year.[2] 
Cuddyer was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 1st round (9th pick) 
of the 1997 amateur draft,[3] but did not sign until August. Consequently, 
he did not make his professional debut until 1998 when he was assigned 
to the Fort Wayne Wizards in the single-A Midwest League. Showing the tools 
that made him a first round draft pick and regularly named to the Baseball 
America's top minor league prospects,[4] Cuddyer made steady progress through 
the Twins' minor league system and made his Major League Baseball debut 
on September 23, 2001 after hitting .301 with 30 home runs and 87 RBI in 
141 games at AA New Britain. After hitting .309 with 20 home runs in 86 
games at AAA Edmonton, Cuddyer would be called back up with the Twins for 
the 2002 stretch drive and would be named to the post-season roster where 
he would hit over .300 against the Oakland A's and the Anaheim Angels. 
Despite playing over half of his 676 minor league games at third base and 
another 166 games at second, prior to the 2004 season Cuddyer got most 
of his playing time as an occasional fill-in in the outfield. During 2004, 
Cuddyer started to see more time in the majors in the infield, playing 
second and third base. After the departure of veteran Twins third baseman 
Corey Koskie to the Toronto Blue Jays by way of free agency in 2005, Cuddyer 
became the Twins' starting third baseman. However, he struggled at third 
base and was relegated to a reserve role for much of 2005, although he 
did hit .263 with 12 home runs for the second season in a row. Cuddyer 
underwent surgery to repair a tear in his right lateral meniscus in October 
2005. The Twins then extended his contract on January 21, 2006, giving 
him a one-year deal worth $1.3 million. After beginning the 2006 season 
on the bench, Cuddyer emerged as a regular in right field and in the cleanup 
spot of the Twins batting order. He finished second to Justin Morneau in 
RBI for the Twins in 2006. Prior to the 2008 season, Cuddyer re-signed 
with the Twins with a three-year $24 million contract, with a $10.5 million 
club option for 2011. On April 4, 2008, Cuddyer suffered a dislocated right 
index finger after sliding headfirst into third base. He also suffered 
a laceration on the knuckle after getting stepped on by Kansas City Royals 
third baseman Alex Gordon.[5] He was put on the 15-day disabled list and 
was activated on April 25 against the Texas Rangers. On his second game 
after being activated, Cuddyer hit a three-run home run off Rangers' Scott 
Feldman, his first of the 2008 season. On May 22, 2009 Cuddyer hit for 
the cycle in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. Three months later, 
on August 23, 2009, Cuddyer hit two home runs in the same inning, the seventh 
inning of the Twins' game against the Kansas City Royals, becoming the 
53rd player in Major League Baseball to accomplish this feat.[6] He is 
the only player in major league history to have performed both offensive 
rarities in the same baseball season. During September and October 2009, 
Cuddyer moved back into the infield playing first base filling in for Justin 
Morneau. Cuddyer returned to the outfield at the start of the 2010 season, 
but also found playing time at first and third base. On July 3, 2011, Cuddyer 
was named an All-Star for the first time as a managers' pick. On July 25, 
Cuddyer became the first Twins position player to pitch in a game in 21 
years when he was inserted in the eighth inning of a Twins loss against 
the Texas Rangers, in which they lost 20-6. The right-hander gave up a 
double to Mike Napoli, a bloop single to Mitch Moreland, and walked Ian 
Kinsler with one out to load the bases. Cuddyer then retired Elvis Andrus 
on a fly ball and David Murphy on a pop-up for a scoreless inning. The 
last Twins position player to pitch was outfielder John Moses against the 
California Angels on July 31, 1990.[7] On December 16, 2011, Cuddyer signed 
a three-year, $31.5 million deal with the Colorado Rockies.[8] He chose 
to wear number 3 in order to honor Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew, with 
whom he had grown close within the Twins organization before Killebrew's 
death.[9] In 2013, Cuddyer set a personal best with a 27-game hitting streak, 
the longest in Rockies history to that point. Cuddyer was also named an 
All-Star for the second time in his career. Cuddyer finished the 2013 regular 
season with a .331 batting average to win the batting title by 10 points 
over Atlanta's Chris Johnson. It was the 34-year-old outfielder's first 
batting title as the highest Cuddyer had hit in a season before 2013 was 
.285. On August 17, 2014, Cuddyer again hit for the cycle, becoming the 
30th player to hit for the cycle more than once and just the third player 
in history, after John Olerud and Bob Watson, to hit for the cycle in both 
the American and National Leagues. Cuddyer signed a two-year contract with 
the New York Mets on November 10, 2014 worth $21 million.[10] On July 24, 
2015 Cuddyer was put on the 15 day disabled list due to a bone bruise in 
his left knee.[11] With the Mets in 2015, Cuddyer appeared in the first 
World Series of his career, but the team would lose the series four games 
to one to the Kansas City Royals. On December 11, 2015, Cuddyer announced 
his retirement via an article on The Players' Tribune titled "Play Hard 
and Dream Big".[12] Michael is the son of Henry Cuddyer and Marcia Harris.[13] 
He has a younger sister named Katie.[14] He married Claudia Rente, an English 
teacher, on November 11, 2006.[15] She has worked for both Hickory High 
School[16] and Great Bridge High School.[17][18] Son, Casey Jonathan, was 
born on June 20, 2008,[19] and fraternal twin daughters, Chloe and Madeline, 
were born on December 6, 2011.[20][21] Due to a childhood virus, Cuddyer 
has been deaf in his left ear since he was eleven years old. However, he 
insists that his partial deafness has never interfered with his ability 
to hear teammates on the field and he does not view himself as hearing
