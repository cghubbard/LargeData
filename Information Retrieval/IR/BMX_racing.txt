BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was 
derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built 
off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting 
gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made 
of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, 
about 15 feet (4.6 m) wide and has large banked corners that help the riders 
maintain speed. The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional 
and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning 
the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications 
among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system 
over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, 
with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist 
for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old. There 
are two BMX racing bikes sizes. One is the 20" wheel bike. This bike is 
common with minors and is currently the most common class. The Cruiser 
bikes are any bikes with a 24" wheel. However, any bikes that have a wheel 
larger than 24" will still be considered Cruisers. Cruisers are more common 
with older racers and is rapidly growing. The cruiser style bike tends 
to be easier to jump and rolls better while the 20" is seemingly more agile.[1] 
While BMX racing is an individual sport, teams are often formed from racers 
in different classifications for camaraderie and often for business exposure 
of a sponsoring organization or company. BMX racing rewards strength, quickness, 
and bike handling. Many successful BMX racers have gone on to leverage 
their skills in other forms of bicycle and motorcycle competitions.[1] 
There are all types of BMX jumps, ranging from small rollers to massive 
step-up doubles. There are pro straights which are for junior and elite 
men. They are all doubles which range from about 6 m to 12 m, while "Class" 
straights have more flow and have many more range of jumps.[1] The Starting 
hill marks the start of the track. Most BMX Tracks have a gate. The starting 
hill will normally provide all the speed for the remainder of the race. 
Generally, the larger the hill, the faster, so pro hills are much larger 
than the amateur ones. A jump of which's landing is at a higher point than 
the jump itself Turns are at an angle. Therefore, you can easily turn without 
having to brake. The double are two hills close to each other. A hill, 
then followed by a shorter hill. A small hill, normally in groups. A flat 
jump, normally for learning to jump. BMX racing became a medal sport at 
the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing under the UCI sanctioning body. Sanctioning 
bodies in the United States are the American Bicycle Association (ABA) 
and the National Bicycle League (NBL). The ABA is certified under the UCI 
(International Cycling Union), which is recognized by the Olympic Committee.[1] 
A sanctioning body is a private (in the United States and most Western 
Nations) governing body which controls a sport or specific discipline thereof. 
One or more sanctioning bodies may operate in a sport at any given time, 
often with subtle rule variations which appeal to regional tastes. They 
make and enforce the rules, and decide the qualifications and responsibilities 
of the participants, including the players, owners, and operators of facilities. 
In legal terms, they are an intermediary between the participants and higher 
governing bodies such as (in cycling) the Union Cycliste Internationale 
(UCI) and National Governing Bodies such as USA Cycling. Sanctioning bodies 
mete out discipline and punishments, as well as bestow awards and rankings 
of their participants. In the Bicycle Motocross context, sanctioning bodies 
are chiefly responsible for providing insurance coverage and other "back 
office" services to local tracks. They also keep points on riders' performance 
throughout the year, and undertake the production of a national racing 
series (which is typically 18-22 weekends per year). Riders are permitted 
to race at the sanctioning body's affiliated tracks and national events 
via the purchase of an annual membership which costs (in the US) US$45 
(ABA) to US$55 (NBL). As part of their administrative "service provider" 
role, BMX sanctioning bodies also determine the rules of competition, such 
as clothing requirements, age and gender divisions (or "classes"), as well 
as the rules and protocol for advancement in proficiency classes (Novice, 
Intermediate, Expert, A Pro, AA Pro, Vet Pro in ABA, and Rookie, Novice, 
Expert, Super-Ex, Elite, Masters in NBL). BMX Racing has had many sanctioning 
bodies over its 40-year history as an organized sport, the first being 
Scot Breithaupt's Bicycle United Motocross Society (BUMS), created in the 
early 1970s (see below). Since then, there have been dozens of regional, 
national, and international sanctioning bodies, some of them associated 
with or owned by another. Most are defunct or have been merged into larger, 
more successful organizations, but a handful still exist in their original 
forms and are prospering. In the US, loyalty to one sanctioning body or 
another is a fundamental example of brand loyalty, where devotees of one 
vigorously assert the superiority of their chosen body overall others. 
Two ABMXA sanctioning bodies that formed in the history of BMX in Australia: 
The first one was formed in May 1975 by Bob Smith, an Australian businessman 
and two of his friends. He open the first BMX track in Australia on May 
17, 1975 on the Gold Coast in Tallebudgera, Queensland adjacent to the 
Tally Valley Golf Club. He had admired BMX through the American magazines 
his son brought home.[2] The second ABMXA was formed in April 1981 from 
three regional Australian BMX organizations: The Victoria BMX Association; 
(VBMXA), the Queensland BMX Association (QBMXA) and the New South Wales 
BMX Association (NSWBMXA). It was Australia's representative to the IBMXF 
in the 1980s. The National Bicycle Association was a third, separate Australian 
sanctioning body. It was formed in December 1981 and had branches in different 
countries around the world. By the summer of 1982 it had 20,000 members 
worldwide and 950 members in the Australian states of Victoria and New 
South Wales.[3] Despite sharing a common name this association had nothing 
to do with the original United States–based National Bicycle Association 
that was formed in California in 1974 and ironically merged with the National 
Bicycle League and ceased operations as an independent body in December 
1981, the same month and year the Australian namesake was formed. BMX Australia 
(BMXA) is the current sanctioning body for BMX in Australia. Currently 
- Cycling Canada http://www.cyclingcanada.ca/ is the Federal Sanctioning 
body for all Canadian cycling disciplines (including BMX) under the UCI. 
Some tracks and Provinces have chosen BMX Canada over the Provincial UCI 
representative. Here are the different choices that are available in Canada, 
Alberta - ABA -Alberta BMX Association. http://www.albertabmx.com/ British 
Columbia - Cycling BC. http://cyclingbc.net/bmx/ Saskatchewan - http://www.saskcycling.ca/BMX.html 
Quebec - http://www.fqsc.net/BMX (please add others) All Ontario tracks 
and some BC tracks are sanctioned by an American corporation - USA BMX 
(also known as ABA) under the assumed name BMX Canada - http://www.bmxcanada.org 
These tracks run rules separate from the UCI but offer similar race structure 
and age categorization. BMX Canada offers full support to their affiliated 
tracks, including point tracking, marketing materials, an in-house magazine 
and a coaching/retention program. Results from these races run under the 
USA BMX/BMX Canada name are used in the team selection process for Provincial 
and National teams. La Fédération Française de Bicrossing, which in English 
translates to The French Federation of Bicrossing (FFB) was created on 
March 1, 1978 by Marcelle Seurat, a motorcycle importer and distributor. 
At first its primary purpose was to promote BMX and its products[4] On 
May 17, 1980 it held is first race in Beaune, France. This organization 
would cease to exist in early 1981 after only acquiring 100 members.[5] 
L'Association Française de Bicrossing, which in English translates to the 
French Association of Bicrossing (FAB), was founded by Raymond Imbert, 
Rene Nicolas, Denis Mourier, Bernard Nicolas, Fabrice Pérez, Gerard Hinault 
and Pascal Giboulot on March 1, 1981. On January 1, 1990, the AFdB joined 
the FFC. On March 4, 1993, BMX was recognized as an important sport by 
the French Ministry for sports. Today the official French BMX Sanctioning 
body is now the Fédération Française de Cyclisme (FFC), or in English the 
French Cycling Federation (FCF)[1]. It has almost 10,000 members.[6][7] 
The Associazione Italiana BMX, which in English translates to Italian BMX 
Association, was founded in December 1981 by Aldo Gandolfo,[8] an Italian 
journalist and sport promoter. In 1983 the A.I.BMX joined the I.BMX.F.[9] 
and held the first official Italian BMX race.[8] In 1984, the A.I.BMX held 
the first Italian international race in Pinerolo[8][10] and organized the 
first Italian participation in European Championships.[8] In 1985 Galdolfo 
left the Association, which was refounded with a new statute and a new 
board of directors.[11] In 1988 the A.I.BMX concluded an agreement with 
the UISP in order to unify their respective national championships and 
in 1989 ceased the activity. The Unione Italiana Sport per Tutti, which 
in English translates to Italian Sport For All Association, is an amateur 
sport association which conducted an official BMX racing activity from 
1985 to 1990, mainly developed in Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna. In 1988 
concluded an agreement with the A.I.BMX in order to unify their respective 
national championships and in 1991 ceased the BMX activity. The Federazione 
Ciclistica Italiana (FCI), which in English translates to Italian Cycling 
Federation, is the national governing body of cycle racing in Italy and 
started conducting official BMX activity in 1984.[8] It was a big promoter 
of BMX racing within the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme 
(FIAC) and in 1985 held the first FIAC World Championship in Jesolo (near 
Venice).[11] Every year the FCI organize the National Championship (held 
in a single race normally on the first Sunday of July) and a season-long 
competition called Circuito Italiano BMX (seven rounds in 2008, with the 
same point system as the UEC European Championship) open to Italian and 
foreign riders.[12] The first sanctioning body in the Netherlands was called 
the Stichting Fietscross Nederland (SFN) (in English the Dutch Bicycle 
Motocross Foundation (DBMXF)) and was co-founded on October 19, 1978 by 
Gerrit Does and Louis Vrijdag. It held its first race on April 21, 1979.[4] 
In December 1980 it was folded into the KNWU (see below) but a second incarnation 
was created in 1987 called the Stichting Fietscross Promotie Nederland 
(the Dutch BMX Promotion Foundation) to promote Dutch racing in the Netherlands. 
This second "SFN" was dessoved in 1997.[13] On December 16, 1980 the SFN 
was integrated into the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Wielren Unie (KNWU) (in 
English the Royal Dutch Cycling Federation (RDCF)),[14] the Dutch cycling 
sanctioning body that was the governing body for all types of cycling and 
represents the Netherlands as a member of the UCI. Some of the then-existing 
local tracks in 1980 did not become a member of the KNWU. Operating for 
a while independently, they formed another sanctioning body in 1987, the 
Nederlandse Fietscross Federatie (NFF), (in English the Dutch Bicycle Motocross 
Federation (DBMXF)). Both organizations function as sanctioning bodies 
for BMX racing. The UKBMXA was created in April 1980 by David Duffield 
as first as a way of promoting BMX in England. On August 30, 1980 it held 
its first BMX race in Redditch, England.[14] This sanctioning body would 
later become affiliated with the IBMXF and represent England in the IBMXF 
sanctioned events including the European and World Championships. In the 
summer of 1985 it merged with the National Bicycle Motocross Association 
(NBMXA) with the UKBMXA being the dominant partner with its name carrying 
on.[15] In November 1989 UKBMX Association (UKBMXA) and the British BMX 
Association (BBMXA) merged and formed the English Bicycle Association (EBA). 
This combination would represent England in the IBMXF. The EBA merged with 
the British Cycling Federation (BCF) which had represented all other aspects 
and disciplines of English bicycle racing other than BMX. This organization 
is now known as British Cycling. British Cycling now represents all aspects 
of sport cycling in the United Kingdom including BMX within the UCI. *Not 
to be confused with the now-defunct United States–based National Bicycle 
Motocross Association (NBmxA) (1972–1981) that was formerly known as the 
National Bicycle Association (NBA) and was the first BMX sanctioning body 
in the world. The British NBMXA ceased operations in the summer of 1985.[15] 
On July 10, 1969, a group of boys riding their Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycles 
in Palms Park in West Los Angeles wanted to race. A park attendant, Ronald 
Mackler, a teenager with motorcycle motocross (MX) experience, helped them 
organize. Palms Park became to BMX as Elysian Fields is to American baseball, 
for at that moment Bicycle Motocross racing was born. By 1973, entrance 
fees of US$4.50 (which included a US$1.00 insurance fee for the year) for 
a 10-week season of Thursday-night racing was charged, and the top three 
racers in the season were given trophies. Then a new season of 10 weeks 
would start the following Thursday. The track operated well into the 1980s 
largely unchanged;, including the lack of a modern starting gate. The first 
BMX proto sanctioning body was the Bicycle United Motocross Society (BUMS) 
founded by Scot Breithaupt in Long Beach, California on November 14, 1970, 
when he was fourteen years old. On that day he put on his first ad hoc 
BMX race. At first BUMS simply referred to the transients that congregated 
in the field around 7th and Bellflower Streets where the track was located, 
but later Scot turned it into the acronym BUMS. The first race had 35 participants, 
who paid Scot a quarter (US25 cents) each for the privilege. At the next 
race 150 kids showed up. Since he was a motorcycle racer he knew even at 
thirteen the importance of a sanctioning body and how races were run and 
organized. He used his personal trophies that he won racing motocross motorcycles 
as awards for the winning competitors. He gave out membership cards, wrote 
the rulebook and had a points system for scoring and proficiency level 
promotion. He ran the first state championship in 1972, when he was all 
of 16 years old. Also due to his racing experience, he knew how to lay 
out a particularly exciting course. The track was about 1,350 feet (410 m) 
long and much more demanding than today's typical BMX course. It was more 
akin to what the professionals race on in special Pro sections of track 
at large events today, including water holes and high dropoffs. Indeed, 
this early track resembled more closely a shortened mountain biking course 
than today's comparatively well groomed BMX tracks. With the aforementioned 
exception of pro sections, today's tracks for the most part are pretty 
tame by comparison due to insurance concerns by the sanctioning bodies. 
The National Bicycle League even went so far as to ban double jumps in 
1988. This first structured sanctioning body would eventually grow to seven 
tracks in California. This is what made him different from other track 
operators at the time: he did not just start one track but several others 
under a single jurisdiction of rules and regulations, all the requirements 
of a sanctioning body. Among the firsts credited to BUMS was the first 
professional race in 1975 at Saddleback Park with a US$200 purse. Breithaupt 
also promoted in a joint venture with the new National Bicycle Association 
(NBA) (which was established the year before) what would later be called 
"Nationals" with the Yamaha Bicycle Gold Cup series in 1974. They were 
three separate qualifying races held at three separate tracks in California 
sponsored and heavily promoted by Yamaha Motor Company Ltd. to decide the 
first "National" No. 1 racer at a fourth and final race at the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. It was an achievement of import in the infancy of BMX, but it 
was not a true national since virtually all the events were held in California 
and almost all racers were Californians. It would be left for other innovators 
to create a true national event. Many followed Ronald Mackler, Rich Lee 
and Scot Breithaupt, opening impromptu often short-lived tracks sometimes 
within preexisting Motorcycle Motocross tracks; but with the exception 
of Breithaupt, the operators were independent "organizations" that operated 
individual tracks without any cohesion. What was needed was a governing 
body that would standardize and give direction and purpose to the grab 
bag of these amateur-run (in that these operators did not have this enterprise 
as the main concern of their lives) tracks. The first official BMX sanctioning 
body was the National Bicycle Association (NBA) started by Ernie Alexander 
in 1972. Like Scot Breithaupt, he had motorcycle motocross in his background, 
and like Scot he was a promoter but a professional one with his American 
Cycle Enterprises (ACE). He was also a former Hollywood stunt man who promoted 
races at the famous Indian Dunes, built and managed by Walt James, where 
many movies and TV shows were filmed. In 1970 he noticed a group of kids 
trying to organize a bicycle race with their Schwinn Sting-Rays. Being 
familiar with motorcycle racing, he lent the kids a hand. He later opened 
the Yarnell track, a steep downhill course every bit as treacherous by 
today's standards as Scot Breithaupt's BUMS track—if not more so. In 1972 
he created the National Bicycle Association, modeled on the existing American 
Motorcycle Association (AMA). It was Mr. Alexander who built a truly nation-spanning 
professional sanctioning body for BMX. Mismanagement irreparably damaged 
its reputation, including such practices as not reporting points totals 
in time, running races late and behind schedule, deliberately scheduling 
its own events opposite the events of other sanctioning bodies to weaken 
their attendance, and a less-than-attentive attitude to members.[citation 
needed] In its last two years it went through a name change to National 
BMX Association (NBmxA) in 1979. It tried to reorganize in 1981, starting 
new tracks and by most accounts had a spark of new energy and enthusiasm, 
but still suffered lack of ridership (racers were committed to other point 
races with the other sanctioning bodies). This was to no avail. The NBA, 
suffering financial difficulties, ceased sanctioning its own races and 
started joint operations and did merge its membership (but did not merge 
its management) with the NBL after the 1981 season. Mr. Alexander did try 
at least one more foray into the sport he helped to pioneer: he started 
the World Wide Bicycle Motocross Association (WWBMXA) in Chatsworth, California 
in 1981. Unfortunately it did not last more than two racing seasons. In 
the United States today there are two major national sanctioning bodies 
for BMX racing. One is the National Bicycle League (NBL), a nonprofit organization 
started in 1974 by George Edward Esser (September 17, 1925 – August 31, 
2006). It was originally based in Pompano Beach, Florida, in the US, but 
now its headquarters is located in Hilliard, Ohio. George Esser was exposed 
to BMX by his son Greg Esser, who was famous within the sport and one of 
the sport's earliest superstars and first professionals. Like Ernie Alexander 
and Scot Breithaupt before him, he was a promoter who created the NBL as 
the BMX auxiliary to the National Motorcycle League (NML), now-defunct, 
when he became dissatisfied with how the races were run. The NBL started 
in Florida, and while it expanded rapidly on the East Coast of the United 
States and for most of its early history, it had only a few tracks west 
of the Mississippi River. That changed in 1982 when it inherited the membership 
and tracks of the defunct National Bicycle Association (NBA) which had 
ceased sanctioning its own races and then went into partnership with the 
NBL. The NBL acquired all the NBA tracks in the nation including all those 
west of the Mississippi. As a result, it became a nation-spanning sanctioning 
body like the ABA. In 1997 the NBL joined USA Cycling, a sanctioning body 
that has long supported road race, mountain biking and other cycling disciplines 
in the United States, tracing its roots back to 1920. The resulting organization 
is the National Federated body that represents cycling in the United States. 
USA Cycling is part of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) also known 
as UCI Cycling, the Switzerland-based international governing body that 
oversees virtually all aspects of cycling around the world (see International 
Sanctioning bodies below). The NBL had a previous association with the 
UCI through its affiliations with the defunct NBL sister organization, 
the International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF), which was also 
co-founded by Mr. Esser. The UCI absorbed IBMXF in 1993 through its amateur 
cycling division, Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC), 
which in the prior five years held joint World Championships for BMX with 
the IBMXF (See International Sanctioning bodies below). On May 17, 2011 
The NBL announced that a letter of agreement was signed and approved by 
their Board of Directors, to merge operations with the ABA. The merged 
organization would be controlled by ABA ownership, and would be called 
USA BMX. After a month of wrangling, and negotiation between the parties, 
the final documents were signed on June 18, 2011. That day was the first 
time in more than 35 years that the sport of BMX Racing was run under a 
single sanctioning body in North America. The following week, the NBL Midwest 
National in Warsaw, Indiana was the first event to be run under the USA 
BMX banner (though was still an NBL-branded event, as part of their 2011 
national series). The 2011 NBL Grand National was the final NBL race of 
all-time, held September 3–4, 2011 and dubbed "The Grand Finale." The second 
current national sanctioning body is the American Bicycle Association (ABA), 
created by Gene Roden and Merl Mennenga in 1977, originating in Chandler, 
Arizona, USA. Mennenga thought at the time that the kids and their families 
were being cheated by unscrupulous promoters (not the aforementioned individuals). 
As the NBA was declining, the ABA inherited many of its tracks and members 
making the ABA within two years the largest, albeit youngest, and the first 
truly nation-spanning sanctioning body. It was the ABA which introduced 
the "Direct Transfer System" that shortened the duration of race events. 
The ABA also started the team trophy concept to award trophies and prizes 
to the bicycle shop and factory teams with the best race results over a 
season. It was also the first to install electronic gates for its starting 
line with "Christmas tree" style lights (reminiscent of drag racing), to 
ensure fairer starts. It also started the BMX Hall of Fame, now called 
the National BMX Hall of Fame, recognizing the pioneers and industry visionaries 
of the sport. Today it is the largest sanctioning body in the world (a 
position it won as early as 1979 when it surpassed the NBL and the old 
NBA in numbers) with an estimated 60,000 members and 272 affiliated tracks 
in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It is technically an international 
organization, but does not bill itself as one, based on its mandate to 
grow BMX in the United States, unlike its predecessor, the International 
Bicycle Motocross Association (IBMX), and its chief early rival, the NBA, 
both of which had international aspirations. The ABA brand stands to be 
retired at the close of the 2011 season, becoming USA BMX as part of its 
merger with the rival National Bicycle League (NBL). Along with the majors 
and pioneers, there were other BMX governing bodies, both national and 
regional and past and present. Among them were the Bicycle Motocross League 
(BMXL); the United Bicycle Racers Association (UBR) (1977–1983); the United 
States Bicycle Motocross Association (USBA) (1984–1986), which merged with 
the ABA at the end of the 1986 racing season after financial trouble made 
it unsustainable; the International Cycling Association (ICA), which was 
started in part by professional racer Greg Hill in 1990; and the Southeast 
Region-based National Pedal Sport Association (NPSA) (1975–1988). They 
are all gone now, but they did affect, for good or ill, the American BMX 
scene. The International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) was founded 
on April 3, 1981 by Gerrit Does, a former motocross racer and Dutch citizen. 
He introduced BMX to the Netherlands in 1974 after seeing it in the United 
States. He also started the first European BMX sanctioning body the Stichting 
Fietscross Nederland (SFN) (the Dutch Bicycle Motocross Foundation (DBMXF) 
in English) in the Netherlands in 1978. George Esser, the same man who 
founded the American-based National Bicycle League (NBL) in 1974 was the 
co-founder of the IBMXF, after Mr. Does approached the NBL to begin preparations 
for the new body in December 1980 with the representatives of sanctioning 
bodies from Canada, Colombia, Japan, Panama, and Venezuela as well as representing 
his native the Netherlands. The IBMXF was a Waalre, the Netherlands-based 
body that conducted international events including its own World Championship 
event until its formal merger with the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) 
amateur cycling division the Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme 
(FIAC) in 1996 to form the largest international sanctioning body. The 
UCI championships have since superseded the old IBMXF championships and 
unlike the old FIAC BMX championships it has a pro class. The NBL was affiliated 
with the UCI through its previous ties with the IBMXF and its merger with 
the FIAC. In the old days of the IBMXF when you raced an IBMXF sanctioned 
race you received NBL state points and points that went toward your international 
standing, but no national NBL points that counted toward contention for 
national number one plates. The World Championship title was open to 16 
& over Experts and older amateurs in the 20" class as well as Pros in the 
20" class. There is a class in European BMX called Superclass. In this 
class, which is ahead of Expert and the last step before going pro, amateurs 
race for and win money, an odd contradiction of the generally accepted 
definition of amateur. However, no racer in Superclass could win more than 
US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. This class has been carried 
over in the UCI after the merger with the IBMXF. In the United States IBMXF 
affiliate the NBL, Superclass is the equivalent of the old "B" pro class 
and "A" pro is now called the Elite as per UCI practice. However, for the 
first few years the IBMXF while there was a pro class, the professionals 
did not race for money but trophies just like the amateurs and the prestige 
of being declared World Champions with its associate side benefits in marketing. 
It was not until 1987 did the pro race for award purses at the IBMXF World 
Championships. Among the European standards of racing the IBMXF observed 
is the rule that racers must stay within their lanes until 25 feet (7.6 m) 
out of the gate. This is to prevent racers from throwing elbows at each 
other and to eliminate major crashes before they even get to the first 
jump. However, on tracks with short straights those who must start from 
the outside lanes are at a serious disadvantage since they cannot begin 
moving inside to shorten the distance before the first turn. As a result, 
many races could be won or lose by lane assignment even before the race 
begins. In the first year of the IBMXF World Championship in 1982 after 
having your standard racers to decide the World Champions in the various 
Classes, both Amateur and Professional, an overall World Champion was decided 
by racing all of the class winners including the Pro Champion and Amateur 
champion in a single race called the Trophy Dash. In 1982, Greg Hill, the 
professional World Champion refused to race the Amateur World Champion 
the American Nelson Chanady, claiming that there was no point to it. Nelson 
Chanady raced and won the Trophy Dash without Hill's participation, capturing 
the Overall title. However, since Mr. Hill did not race, the World Championship 
title lost a considerable amount of luster, since American professional 
racers were regarded collectively as the best in the world with Mr. Hill 
being among the best of them. Because of this lost of stature due to Mr. 
Hill not racing that final race in 1982, the Trophy Dash to determine the 
World Champion was abolished and in 1983 when the American professional 
Clint Miller won the World Professional Championship he was also considered 
the overall World Champion. On January 1, 1993 the IBMXF and the Fédération 
Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC), the amateur governing branch 
of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) which handled Olympic Cycling, 
merged formally after having held joint World Championships since July 
22, 1991 in Sandness, Norway (FIAC had been holding its own separate BMX 
World Championships starting 1986). After a further three year transition 
time in which the European and World Championships where credited as "IBMXF/FIAC" 
the UCI held its first official BMX World Championship in 1996 in England. 
It has continued to hold BMX European and World Championships ever since. 
The Fédération Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme (FIAC) which in English 
stands for International Amateur Cycling Federation, which was based in 
Rome, Italy, was the amateur cycling arm of the UCI. It had direct ties 
to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It had no professional division. 
That was the purview of its professional counterpart based in Luxembourg, 
the Fédération Internationale de Cyclisme Professionnel (FICP), also operated 
by the UCI. However, a class of paid amateurs called the Superclass is 
allowed even though it may contradict the accepted notions of what an amateur 
is. However, members of the Supercross class could not win more than US$200 
per event and keep their amateur standing. In any case, with the allowance 
of professionals in the Olympics this has largely become a moot point. 
USA Cycling, formerly the United States Cycling Federation (USCF) as it 
was known at the time, was the American affiliate of FIAC. However, it 
did not have a BMX division at this time. The NBL worked through the then 
independent IBMXF. Today after purchasing the NBL USA Cycling the NBL represents 
BMX in the UCI through USA Cycling. FIAC started holding its own BMX World 
Championships in 1984. At the time the IBMXF and FIAC were two separate 
International sanctioning bodies that both held BMX World Championships. 
However, the IBMXF's was far more prestigious, professionally competently 
run and established than FIAC. This was because FIAC refused help from 
either the IBMXF and the American for profit American Bicycle Association 
(then as now only one non-profit BMX sanctioning body per nation is recognized 
by the UCI as representing BMX in a nation. In the United States's case 
it was and is the NBL), both far more experienced at the time in running 
BMX races. In some nations if you race in the IBMXF circuit (see above) 
you could not race in the FIAC circuit and vice versa, akin to not being 
allowed to race NBL if you race the ABA circuit if they had such rules 
in America. FIAC had odd (to Americans) conventions and rules in conducting 
races, most likely grafted on from road racing in which was FIAC's only 
experience. For instance not only did you race three times to determine 
average positions in the motos to advance the best four riders to the next 
stage in racing, something Americans were familiar if they raced NBL, you 
also, if the class was big enough, raced the eighths, quarters and semis 
also three times and the best racers qualified for the Main. Then if you 
did qualify for the Main, you had to race the Main five times to find the 
final ranking of racers. In the US only the Professionals in the 20" class 
raced the Main multiple times and only three times at that in either the 
ABA or NBL. If anything this put a premium on consistency and lowered the 
luck factor to a bare minimum. However, it was very time consuming even 
at races scheduled over two days. For a sanctioning body then new to BMX, 
it was pretty efficient in terms of running an event (taking into consideration 
the multiple qualifying runs). However, because of its inexperience it 
was plagued with tracks of inferior quality, both in terms of difficulty, 
they were deemed far too easy for venues of an international event; and 
the building materials used, for example during the 1988 Championships 
in Mol, Belgium the track was built out of white sand, which became particularly 
boggy in the turns. "It feels like riding on the beach" [16] was a refrain 
from many American racers. This inexperience of track construction was 
rectified by 1991 when the FIAC and the IBMXF started holding combined 
World Championship series in 1991 after four years of holding separate 
championship events. The two bodies formally unified in 1993 (FICP was 
disbanded along with the FIAC by the UCI). After a three-year transition 
period, The UCI held its first World Championship in 1996 after absorbing 
the IBMXF and abolishing FIAC. With the increasing relaxation of the rules 
of Professionalism in the IOC, the merged governing body, run directly 
by the UCI, retained the professional division. The Union Cycliste Internationale 
(UCI) or in English the International Cycling Union, is a Switzerland-based 
international sanctioning body created in 1900 which has had its own international 
BMX racing program since 1982 (through FIAC) and have been holding World 
Championships for BMX racing since 1996. The UCI also supports Mountain 
Bike, Track, Road Race Cycling, and Cyclo-Cross. The UCI through its amateur 
division FIAC, held championships were separate and distinct from the International 
Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) World Championships until they started 
to hold the World Championships jointly starting in 1991 (see above). The 
American sanctioning body the National Bicycle League (NBL) was affiliated 
with the UCI via the old IBMXF which the NBL was a part of. With the merger 
of the IBMXF with FIAC, they in turn being folded into the UCI, and the 
NBL joining the USA Cycling directly, the NBL was affiliated with the UCI 
from 1996 to 2008. Beginning with the 2009 season, the ABA took over as 
the USA affiliate of UCI. Riders are qualified to the annual UCI BMX World 
Championships through participation and qualifying in their own National 
Championship Race. In the USA, this Championship race occurs in Desoto, 
TX on the Saturday of the ABA Supernationals (which are run on a Friday/Sunday 
schedule) in Mid March. The sanctioning bodies have slightly different 
rules for qualifications of advancement in races between skill levels and 
age classification. For instance the ABA and the NBL uses different rules 
of qualifying for mains from the motos. The ABA uses almost an all or nothing 
system called the Transfer System while the NBL uses a cumulative scoring 
scheme called the Moto System. Below is the general rules, structure of 
advancement within the American Bicycle Association unless otherwise noted, 
but the generalities are similar between the sanctioning bodies. Racers 
in the 20" class are grouped with others of the same relative age and experience 
levels; Novice, Intermediate, Expert, Veteran, "A" Pro, "AA" Pro in the 
ABA; Rookie, Novice, Expert, Elite Masters, "B" Pro (Superclass) and "A" 
Pro (Elite) in the NBL. They range from 5 & under Novice to 28 & over Expert 
in the ABA and from 5 & under Rookie to 35 & over Expert in the NBL. Cruiser 
Class (bicycles with 24" or greater diameter wheels) and the girl classes 
are not divided up into skill classes, only age classes in both the NBL 
and the ABA. The Cruiser class age brackets for example range from 9 & 
under to 51 & over for males, 10 & under to 41 & over for females in the 
ABA; and 9 & under to 55 & over males, 10 & under to 40 & over females 
in the NBL. In a typical day a racer will race several times with their 
group to determine the day's finishing order and awards. The qualifying 
rounds, called Motos (called heats in other types of racing) determines 
the number of racers in the finals which are called Mains, up to eight 
racers. The sizes and number of motos at a skill level and age group is 
determined by the number of racers who register for that race and in that 
skill level and age group. Usually a racer gets three chances to qualify. 
As stated in the previous section, the two sanctioning bodies generally 
use two different methods of moving racers from the qualifying rounds to 
the Main (although there is some overlap), the Transfer System, the method 
generally used by the ABA; and the Moto System, the NBL's choice. In the 
transfer system usually one to three people are transferred to the main 
depending on the size of the class. For instance, in the ABA transfer system 
a group of say eight racers sign up for the 17-18 Intermediate class. That 
is more than enough to have three motos (four is the minimum). Moto #1 
will have all eight racers. The first two finishers qualify for and do 
not race again until the Main. Moto #2 will be a second heat for the remaining 
six racers; again, the first two across the finish line from that group 
will go the Main. Finally, a third moto of the remaining four riders is 
run, from which the first two racers across the finish line will be taken 
to the Main, forming a six-man Main. The last two racers do not qualify 
(DNQ) and therefore do not race in the Main, do not collect any points, 
trophies, a chance to take a step in advancement to a higher amateur level 
or if they are professionals, prize money. The NBL and the international 
UCI uses the "Olympic" or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the 
Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race 
is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining how well you do with 
all the registered participant riders in your class racing all three times. 
It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your 
points total, the more likely you will advance. For instance if you come 
in 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty 
to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the 
quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If you come 
in Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men in your class translates 
to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races 
the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person 
who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would have a 
much better shot at making the Main than you. Even the person who came 
in 2nd+6th+6th or 35+25+35=95 would have a better shot even if you won 
the final moto. In larger races in both the ABA and NBL, then a 2nd moto 
of the same class but different racers is run right behind the first group. 
They also race three times but instead of the winners going to the Main 
they face their first group counterparts (who also went through the three-moto 
shake out) in the semi finals called the Semi-Main. Then the qualifiers 
face off in the Main. The same for races large enough for quarterfinals 
or Quarter-Mains, 1/8s and even 1/16s. The Amateurs, once they get to the 
mains usually only race once for the top points and the trophy. The Professionals 
on the other hand run multiple cumulative Mains just like in the qualifying 
motos for the points, trophy and most important, prize money. This is both 
NBL and ABA practice. Like during the qualifying motos the points you earn 
in each running of the Pro Main are tied into the position you finish in 
each of the three motos. Cumulative scoring rewards consistency. The better 
the racer you are, the more consistent you will be. The transfer system 
lets you capitalize on the mistakes of others. The better the racer you 
are, the fewer the mistakes you make. One major drawback in cumulative 
scoring is that it is more complicated task in keeping track than in the 
transfer system. In the 1980s at least two national level scoring scandals 
(one in 1985) in which the national professional number one was decided 
after the Grand nationals underlined this. There was also a scoring mix 
up during the 1983 NBL Grand National in which it was thought Brian Patterson 
was the winner for two weeks but after a recount initiated after Eric Rupe 
protested gave Eric Rupe the number one for 1983. An even larger scoring 
scandal occurred in 1985 in which pro racer Peter Loncarevich apparently 
beat Greg Hill for the number one pro racer by a mere 3 points. Greg Hill's 
wife Nancy (who was the bookkeeper for Greg Hill's BMX bicycle company 
Greg Hill Products) kept an independent accounting of the season points 
of Mr. Hill's closest competitors and detected an error. At his wife's 
urging Mr. Hill ask for and received an audit of the points and the NBL 
confirmed the error had taken place and awarded Mr. Hill the pro title 
for 1985.[17] The Transfer System on the other hand, was never popular 
with the racers. While very efficient and less error prone than the cumulative 
method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish 
line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would 
only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the 
races are big enough to race the mains (on the other hand you get to relax 
a little without the anxiety of doing poorly in the next two qualifying 
motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of 
BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do 
well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you 
are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual 
race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in 
entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto. 
Among the Pros the Cumulative method is preferred. Not only because they 
get to race more, it lessens the chance of luck playing as a factor in 
any given race event. In 1985 Greg Hill staged a personal boycott of ABA 
nationals in part of his dislike of the transfer system. Cumulative scoring 
is not only used in the ABA and NBL pro qualifying motos but in the mains, 
in which the pros are required to race the mains three times to win points 
and prize money. Cumulative scoring, also known as Olympic scoring, is 
used by the UCI in their international BMX program and was used in the 
2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China for both amateurs and professionals. 
The ABA continues to use the Transfer System for its amateur classes. The 
first ostensive goal of a BMX racer is to become the number one amateur 
racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up 
into several Districts depending how many participants and how spread out 
they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people 
in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having 
a sense of accomplishment if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing 
his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. 
Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity 
of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season 
for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in 
the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what 
skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular 
races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total 
for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points 
you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for 
the Main). In the Amateur class, advancement to a higher skill level depends 
on your success in your present skill level. For instance at the ABA local 
level you start out as a Novice. From Novice eight local career first places 
in the Mains will advance you to Intermediate Class. From Intermediate 
twenty five local career first place wins in the Main is required to graduate 
to the Expert class. From there as in most other sports, it is voluntary 
to go professional. The Main will determine the winner that day and 1st, 
2nd, 3rd, 4th and sometimes 5th-place trophies and who gets how many points 
added to his total which determines his ranking in his district. The number 
of points a racer gets after a race is usually determined by his place 
in the Main. On the local level, first place Novice class will get the 
winner 25 points, 2nd place 20 and so on with 8th getting only 3 points. 
The more points a racer has the higher his ranking and thus the lower the 
number he gets to wear on his front number plate the following season. 
For instance say in ABA New York District #1 a racer had the 10th most 
points out of 200 racers in his district at the finish of the 2005 season. 
He will then be entitled to have the number "10" on his number plate for 
that district during the 2006 season. The Skill level class you belong 
to also affects how many points you get. The winners of the Expert Classes 
on the local level will get 100 points while the winning Intermediates 
will get 50 points and the winners of the Novice classes only 25 points. 
Second, third et al. placers would get lower points in proportion. The 
7th place Expert finishers will get only 20 points, the equivalent of second 
place in the Novice class. In all classes and skill levels racers also 
receive the same number of points depending on how many are in their class 
and age group. These are called participant points. For instance if eight 
riders participate in 17-18 Intermediate class, all those who make the 
mains will get 8 points, including the last place finisher. If the class 
has 15 racers, all who make the main will get 15 points. So the winner 
of the Intermediate class will get 15 points for the fifteen racers in 
that class on top of the 50 points for winning for a total of 65 points. 
There are separate point scoring for cruiser and girl classes and separate 
point tables for state and national rankings. Points for those events are 
gathered in a similar fashion as on the district, i.e. local, level. Other 
important factors affect the point totals. Some local special event races 
are double or even triple point races, doubling or tripling the points 
each position in the Mains each racer would normally get. points are awarded, 
so an Expert winner could look forward to collecting 400 points for winning 
his class in addition to bonus points and participant points. To compete 
on a National level for national titles you must compete in Nationals. 
Nationals have their own separate points tables that are accumulated by 
the racers similarly to local district points. However the points rewarded 
are not the same amount. For instance 240 National points are awarded to 
the first place Expert winner as well as his 300 district triple points, 
but his national points are not added to his district points or vice versa. 
Like in local races he or she is also awarded participant points. The amateur 
with the most National points at the end of the year is the overall National 
number one (#1) racer and gets to wear a #1 on his number plate at national 
events the following season. Professionals are not affected since they 
have their own points system and table separate from the amateurs for the 
number one pro title. In the NBL there is no overall #1 amateur, only a 
number one title for their age group, so a racer in say 17 expert that 
has most points can wear a national #1 plate even if the number one rider 
in 12 expert actually has more points. Again, the professionals have their 
own points system for number one pro. There is yet another points table 
for State/Provincial wide events for the State/Provincial Championship. 
However, instead of wide gap points between winners and those who follow 
and between skill levels, they are quite close i.e. for first place in 
Expert, Intermediate and Novice it is 20, 19, and 18 respectively. Also, 
it is only a one-point difference between places i.e. 20 points for first 
and 19 points for second place in Expert. The same for the Novice and Intermediate 
levels. Also unlike on the National and District level no participant points 
are awarded. In the NBL, the points received for moto points in the cumulative 
"Olympic" system at the national and regional level are similar as on the 
district level. Nationals can also affect your skill level ranking. On 
the local level it takes eight career wins to transfer from Novice to Intermediate; 
from Intermediate to Expert 25 career wins are necessary. On the national 
level only five career wins are required in both cases. This is because 
of the much higher quality of competition found on the national level. 
All of the aforementioned applies with minor variations to the Girls and 
Cruiser Classes. A fourth class of racing in BMX which are held at local 
and national events are called Opens. Opens are largely exhibition and 
are a chance to test yourself and practice against better competition without 
jeopardizing your point standings. You must be registered to race in a 
points race to sign up for the Open events. No points are awarded for Opens 
although trophy places are and the moto qualification rounds are similar 
to the point races. These are races with more flexible skill level and 
age requirements. In Opens there are no Novice, Intermediate and Expert 
divisions. All amateur skill levels are free to participate. The age groupings 
are generally broader, for example 13-14 open class as opposed to 13 Intermediate 
and 14 Intermediate being separate groupings for those ages in the points 
races. Girls may also participate in the male Open class within the proper 
age ranges. However expert boys are not allowed in these "Mixed" opens. 
Then an Expert Open is held in that event. The pros are excluded from racing 
with the amateurs if enough pros are at hand to race that a separate Pro-Open 
class can be created. If not, then the pros can race in the amateur Open 
with some restrictions. This is called a Pro-Am event. Except for the Pro-Am 
exception the Expert racers usually wins the open class. Even if there 
are Pros in the Open, it is not unusual for an older Expert-17-18 age class 
for example-to win since many have the talent and speed to be a pro but 
have not yet taken the opportunity, partly because once you go Pro, you 
can go back to amateur only under very strict circumstances. There are 
separate Open divisions for Cruisers where similar rules apply. Sometimes 
an exhibition race is held after all the meaningful races are run with 
all the amateur class winners from Novice up to Expert and including the 
Open, girls classes and perhaps Cruiser classes race together once. This 
is called the Trophy Dash. Like in the Open Classes, no points are rewarded 
in this case, just a chance for bragging rights and to match yourself up 
against people that are at a higher skill level. Only one race for a single 
first-place trophy is awarded. As in the Opens the Expert usually wins 
with the Intermediate winner pulling one out every once in a while. Novices 
usually win only when a major, catastrophic pile up occurs on the track 
and even then the mass smash up has to happen quite close to the finish 
line. There are professional rankings in BMX. In the ABA the two major 
ones are the "A" and "AA" classifications in the 20" division. The Professionals 
are the only class allowed to compete for cash prizes. The first level 
is pro. To become an "A" pro you have to hold at least an Expert skill 
level rating and be at least 15 years old to be issued a Pro Membership 
card by the ABA. If you are a professional BMXer with another BMX sanctioning 
body you will be recognized as a Pro by the ABA and barred from competing 
in ABA sanctioned amateur classes. Once you become a pro BMX racer, you 
cannot go back to amateur status except under stringent circumstances. 
What's more by turning BMX Pro you very likely be disqualifying yourself 
from other armature sports depending on the state and federal laws that 
apply. If you winnings exceed US$3000 in a season at national events the 
racer will be promoted to "AA" pro. "A" pro and "AA" pros race in separate 
classes generally, but if there are too few of one or the other type of 
pro to race separately-four is the minimum-then they race together in a 
combined class. This occurs generally in at large multi-point local district 
races but usually not at Nationals. Pro ranking points are similar to the 
National armateur points awards. "A" Pros get the equivalent of National 
Intermediate points. i.e. 120 for first, 100 points for second etc. "AA" 
Pro get Expert equivalent points i.e. 240 for first etc. Both like in the 
amateur classes get participant points if the racer makes the Main. The 
person with the most points in a season will be District Pro #1, the same 
is true to become state Pro #1. However, on the national level not only 
you must receive the most points, you must race in at least 10 nationals 
plus the Grand Nationals, the ABA's multi-day season ending event, for 
the best 10 of your finishes will go toward your national rankings. For 
example, if you participate in 13 national events, your best 10 will be 
considered and your worst three disregarded. You must meet this qualification 
on the national level to wear National numbers one though ten on your number 
plate the following year. The rules are similar for Pro Cruiser and Pro 
Girls classes. There is a fourth class of pro called Veteran Pro. These 
are professionals in the 20" class that are at least 30 years old and generally 
past their racing prime but still love to compete. Most of the rules that 
apply to the "A" and "AA" pros apply to the "Vet" Pros except that they 
are required to race in only six national events plus the Grand Nationals 
and are classified as "A" Pros and get "A" Pro points, However, they can 
win unlimited prize money as a Vet pro on this "A" Pro level without the 
requirement of moving up to "AA" pro upon winning US$3000 in a season. 
Some Vet Pros are retired "AA" pros that have come back to the sport. In 
those cases they had to go through a reclassification process with certain 
criteria having to be met, including written permission from conventional 
"A" Pros. "Vet" Pros cannot compete for the National #1 Championship. Many 
participants in BMX racing have left their mark. Most are pure racers while 
some promoted and sponsored races; others have created unique maneuvers 
and invented or helped design equipment as well have raced themselves. 
They have done it over the near 40-year history of the sport during distinct 
eras. These are just a few. Pioneering "Old School"* BMX racers from the 
US include: D.D. Leone Each racer is sourced on his/her individual page. 
US "Mid school" racers and racers whose careers started during the "Old 
School" era but were not part of the pioneering 1970's generation include: 
Each racer is sourced on his/her individual page. Notable international 
Old and "Mid School"* BMX racers: Each racer is sourced on his/her individual 
page. Newer "Mid School" and "New/Current School"* racers include: Each 
racer is sourced on his/her individual page. *Generally speaking the "Old 
School" generation is from 1969, the very beginning of BMX to 1987 or 1988, 
during the first major slump in the popularity of BMX racing and the height 
of popularity of Old School Freestyling. "Mid School" is generally considered 
to be from 1988 to 1999, which includes the first slump in Freestyle BMX 
in 1988-89 and the resurgence of BMX racing beginning in 1990 and it really 
taking off again in 1993. "New/Current School" or today's BMX is considered 
to be from 2000 to the present day with the emphasis on Dirt Jumping contest 
and streetstyle and deemphasis on racing. With the racers, it will not 
be perfect demarcations. Some Old Schoolers raced well into the Mid School 
era of the 1990s, like Pete Loncarevich and Greg Hill. There are a few 
Old Schoolers still racing in the Veteran and Masters classes today, Eric 
Rupe to name one. Many Mid Schoolers like Warwick Stevenson and Randy Stumpfhauser 
are racing well into the New/Current School era. A significant number of 
top New Schoolers started during the "Mid school" era like Donny Robinson 
and Bubba Harris, so there is bleed over. As time goes by the year definitions 
of eras of "Mid" and "New School" will change, especially Mid School, but 
"Old School" will most likely always refer to the sports first 18–19 years 
when the pioneers began it, set the rules, promoted it, constructed the 
precedent setting equipment, set the records and conventions, raced it, 
and largely retired from it in terms of serious Senior Pro competition. 
CDNE=Class did not exist. TDNE=Title did not exist. Note: Dates reflect 
the year the racers *won* their plates, not the year they actually *raced* 
their No.1 plates. In other words, David Clinton won his No.1 plate in 
1974 entitling him to race with #1 on his plate for the 1975 season. John 
George then won the No.1 plate in 1975 and raced with #1 on his plate during 
the 1976 racing season. Pro* Nat.#1 Men Pro Cruiser Nat.#1 Men Amat. Nat.#1

in Arizona did the NBA have any districts outside of California) and John 
George in 1975 and before him David Clinton in 1974 where the district 
champions at the end of those seasons that made them National No.1s by

was considered #1 overall amateur or professional. The NBL did have a pro 
class in 1977, 1978 & 1979 but the title of National Number One Professional 
was not created until the 1980 season when the pros and the 16 Experts 
were separated and the pros earning separate points (in the form of purse 
money won) from the amateurs. Prior to 1980 the pros, due to the comparatively 
small number of them, competed with the 16 Experts and were able to earn 
amateur titles. ***Title Did Not Exist The title plate for this class did 
exist under the title of "B" pro (which was created for the 1981 season), 
but it was not until 1990 when the name was changed to "Superclass" and 
it became a pro/am class were the racers of that class given an opportunity 
to win a separate year end overall National #1 plate title separate from 
the pure Pro and the pure amateur classes. Amateurs competed for prizes 
and Pros could compete for a limited amount purses. Also beginning in the 
1990 season "Pro Cruiser" was renamed "Super Cruiser" and "A" Pro "All 
Pro". In 1996 Super Cruiser was renamed "Pro Cruiser" once again and "All" 
Pro reverted to "Pro Class" This was to harmonize NBL nomenclature with 
UCI/IBMXF labels. Because of this the NBL would change the name of its 
pro Classes many times during the 1990s, They even began calling there 
senior pro class "AA" and the junior pros "A" just like the ABA beginning 
in the year 2000. Continuing the name shuffle the senior male pro class 
was officially known as Elite Men and the junior men "A" pro until the 
end of the 2006 season. Beginning with the 2007 season the junior "A" pro 
class was called "Super X" (SX). The single level pro females are called 
Elite Women. Beginning with the 2006 season the NBL ceased offering an 
independent year end title for both the "A" pro class and the Pro Cruisers. 
In the case of Pro Cruiser it was an end of a long era with the Pro Cruiser 
No.1 title going back to 1981 when Brent Patterson first won the class. 
In 2007 the junior pro class was rechristened "Super X" and an independent 
year end number one plate was reestablished. ****Title Discontinued †(AM)=Amateur. 
From 1981 to 1984 the girl's National No.1 title was amateur. Between 1985 
and 1987 a girl's pro class was established but that division was discontinued 
between 1988 and 1996 due to lack of participants and those National No.1 
women titles were again amateurs. From 1997 to the present the title is 
a professional one once again. ‡(Sup)=Superclass. Superclass was a Pro/Am 
class. Note: Dates reflect the year the racers *won* their plates, not 
the year they actually *raced* their No.1 plates. In other words, Stu Thomsen 
won his No.1 title in 1979 entitling him to race with #1 on his plate for 
the 1980 season. Brent Patterson then won the No.1 plate in 1980 and raced 
with #1 on his plate during the 1981 racing season. Pro Nat.#1 Men (AA)

the 1979 season the #1 plate holder was considered #1 overall amateur or 
professional. The ABA did have a pro class in 1977 & 1978 but the title 
of National Number One Professional was not created until the 1979 season 
when the pros and the 16 Experts were separated and the pros earning separate 
points (in the form of purse money won) from the amateurs. Prior to 1979 
the pros, due to the comparatively small number of them, competed with 
the 16 Experts and were able to earn amateur titles. **Title Did Not Exist. 
While the ABA did start its pro cruiser class in 1981 the title pro cruiser 
National Number One did not exist until 1987. http://okeeheeleebmx.com/
