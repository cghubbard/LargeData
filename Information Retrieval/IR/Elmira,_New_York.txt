Elmira /ˌɛlˈmaɪrə/ is a city in Chemung County, New York, US. It is the 
principal city of the Elmira, New York Metropolitan Statistical Area, which 
encompasses Chemung County, New York. The population was 29,200 at the 
2010 census. It is the county seat of Chemung County. The City of Elmira 
is in the south-central part of the county, surrounded on three sides by 
the Town of Elmira. It is in the Southern Tier of New York, a short distance 
north of the Pennsylvania state line. This was long an area inhabited by 
indigenous people. In historic times, it was occupied by the Cayuga nation 
of the Iroquois Confederacy, also called the Kanawaholla.[1] They had some 
relations with Europeans and English over fur trading, but were relatively 
isolated from the encroaching settlements. During the American Revolutionary 
War, the Sullivan Expedition of 1779 was mounted against the four Iroquois 
nations who had allied with the British and Loyalist forces. It fought 
a combined British-Iroquois force at the Battle of Newtown, south of the 
current city, in which Sullivan and his forces were victorious.[2] After 
the conclusion of the war, the Iroquois and the new United States made 
a treaty at Elmira in 1791 to settle territorial disputes in the region.[3] 
Most of the Seneca emigrated under pressure with the other Iroquois to 
Canada, where they resettled on land provided by the British Crown. The 
first European-American settler in Elmira was captain Abraham Miller of 
the Continental Army. He built a cabin after resigning just before the 
Revolutionary War. Miller's Pond and Miller Street are named after him 
and are near the location of his house.[4] The New York legislature established 
the Township of Chemung, now Chemung County, in 1788. The settlement of 
Newtown was soon established at the intersection of Newtown Creek and the 
Chemung River. In 1792, the settlement at Newtown joined with the Wisnerburg 
and DeWittsburg settlements to form the village of Newtown. In 1808, the 
village officially changed its name to the Town of Elmira, at a town meeting 
held at Teal's Tavern. It is said the town was named after tavern owner 
Nathan Teal's young daughter, but that story has never been confirmed. 
In any case, the City of Elmira, also called "The Queen City", was incorporated 
in 1864 from part of the town of Elmira and the village of Elmira. The 
remaining part of the town of Elmira exists still, surrounding the city 
on the west, north and east. The city and town share an intricately entwined 
history. According to Amos B. Carpenter's Family History book printed in 
1898, Elmira is named after Major General Matthew Carpenter's daughter. 
This occurred according to the book in 1821 at the constitutional convention 
which Matthew was a delegate to. Elmira served as a transportation hub 
for New York's Southern Tier in the 1800s, connecting commercial centers 
in Rochester and Buffalo with Albany and New York City, via the canal system 
and railroads. The city was the southern terminus of the Chemung Canal 
(completed in 1833); later, the Junction Canal was constructed to connect 
Elmira with Corning, facilitating transport of coal from the Pennsylvania 
mines via the Northern branch of the Susquehanna Canal system. In 1849, 
the New York and Erie Railroad was built through Elmira, giving the area 
a New York City to Buffalo route. In 1850, the Elmira and Jefferson Railroad 
gave the area a route north and the Elmira and Williamsport Railroad a 
route south in 1854. This made the city a prime location for an Army training 
and muster point early in the Civil War. In 1872 the Utica Ithaca and Elmira 
Railroad was begun, eventually creating a route to Cortland and Syracuse 
via Horseheads, Breesport and VanEtten. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western 
Railroad was completed in 1884, which competed with the Erie's New York 
City to Buffalo line. A great deal of the 30-acre (120,000 m2) Union installation, 
known as Camp Rathbun, fell into disuse as the Civil War progressed, and 
the camp's "Barracks #3" were converted into a Civil War prisoner of war 
camp in the summer of 1864. The camp, in use from June 6, 1864 until autumn 
1865, was dubbed "Hellmira" by its inmates. Towner's history of 1892 and 
maps from the period indicate the camp occupied a somewhat irregular parallelogram, 
running about 1,000 feet (300 m) west and approximately the same distance 
south of a location a couple of hundred feet west of Hoffman Street (Foster 
Avenue?) and Winsor Avenue, bordered on the south by Foster's Pond more 
or less, on the north bank of the Chemung River. In the months the site 
was used as a camp, 12,123 Confederate soldiers were incarcerated; of these, 
2,963 died during their stay from a combination of malnutrition, prolonged 
exposure to brutal winter weather and disease directly attributable to 
the dismal sanitary conditions on Foster's Pond and lack of medical care. 
The camp's dead were prepared for burial and laid to rest by the sexton 
at Woodlawn National Cemetery, ex-slave John W. Jones. At the end of the 
war, each prisoner was given a loyalty oath and given a train ticket back 
home; the last prisoner left the camp on September 27, 1865. The camp was 
closed, demolished and converted to farmland. Woodlawn Cemetery, about 
2 miles (3 km) north of the original prison camp site (bounded by West 
Hill, Bancroft, Davis and Mary Streets), was designated a "National Cemetery" 
in 1877. The prison camp site is today a residential area. As Elmira grew, 
so did the citizens' concern about increased crime after the end of the 
war; the idea of constructing a reformatory within the city had been discussed 
for some years. Finally, lands on which the present-day Elmira Correctional 
Facility resides, approximately 280 acres (1.1 km2) in all (north of Bancroft 
across the street from Woodlawn Cemetery), were purchased in 1869 and 1870 
by the state legislature, specifically for construction of the reformatory 
and an armory. These lay within the boundaries of the town of Elmira, rather 
than the city. Around the same time, Dr. Eldwin Eldridge purchased a large 
tract of wilderness (~ 100 acres (0.4 km2)) with a small pond, also within 
the township and developed it into a fabulous garden spot. His sudden death 
in 1876 put paid to his plans to develop the land further. After his death, 
Dr. Eldridge's estate granted access to the parkland to Elmira residents 
and tourists. In 1889, the city purchased the land, calling it Eldridge 
Park in the doctor's honor. The park this time held a nearly 15-acre (61,000 m2) 
lake in its center, along with marble statuary, flower gardens, fountains, 
driving and walking paths and a labyrinth. In 1890, along with Eldridge 
Park, the reformatory and armory, the city added a well-populated area 
known as "Carr's Corners", an area bounded by Hoffman, West Hill and Hillcrest 
(old Carr Road) - and appears to include the residential area around and 
to the south of Woodlawn National Cemetery.[citation needed]. In 1950, 
the population of the City of Elmira peaked at about 50,000, which represented 
57 percent of Chemung County’s total population at that time. Today, the 
City has approximately 30,000 residents, which represents 34 percent of 
Chemung County’s total population. This population decline is due to the 
national decline in railroads and manufacturing as well as a population 
shift to the outer suburbs around Elmira. The Elmira Metro area has nearly 
100,000 in population. The population decline began during the recession 
of the early 1970s during which several large employers (Ann Page, American 
Bridge, General Electric, American LaFrance, Westinghouse and Remington 
Rand) either closed their factories or moved to other states. The decline 
was exacerbated by the flood of 1972, during which many of the downtown 
businesses and single-family homes were destroyed or replaced by subsequent 
Urban Renewal projects in the Chemung River flood plain. Today, the primary 
manufacturing employers are: Anchor Glass Container Corporation,[5] headquartered 
in Tampa, Florida, is located in the old Thatcher Glass facility in Elmira 
Heights. Anchor Glass produces a diverse line of flint, amber, green and 
other colored glass containers of various types and designs for the beer, 
food, beverage and liquor markets in North America. Anchor Glass is now 
wholly owned by the Ardagh Group S.A..[6] CAF-USA Inc[7] has its main U.S. 
plant in Elmira Heights on the site of the former American Bridge Company. 
CAF USA is a subsidiary company of Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles, 
a Spanish manufacturer of passenger rail products (including trains, high-speed 
trains, locomotives, light rail vehicles and other rail equipment). CAF-USA 
Inc trains are typically designed for North America's market, based on 
Spanish design and technologies. Elmira Heat Treating,[8] established in 
1962 and located in Elmira, offers a wide variety of heat treatment technologies 
to both domestic and international customers such as Hilliard Corp., Ford 
Motors, General Signal and others. Hardinge, Inc. (formerly Hardinge Brothers),[9] 
established in 1890 and now headquartered in Elmira, manufactures precise 
turning machines for the domestic and international market. Starting in 
1995, Hardinge began expanding their product line and over the years has 
acquired L. Kellenberger & Co. AG,[10] Hauser-Tripet-Tschudin AG,[11] Jones 
& Shipman,[12] and Usach Technologies, Inc.[13] In 2004 they also acquired 
Bridgeport,[14] world-famous for its milling machines and machining centers. 
Hilliard Corporation,[15] established in 1905, has two locations in Elmira 
and serves the international market in filters, brakes, clutches and starters 
for a variety of industrial and commercial uses as well as consumer equipment 
from Polaris and MTD.[16] Kennedy Valve,[17] located in Elmira since 1905, 
is one of the world's largest manufacturers of products for waterworks 
distribution, potable and wastewater treatment, and fire protection system 
projects. They are most famous for their fire hydrants which can be found 
around the world. Kennedy Valve was acquired by McWane in 1925.[18] Trayer 
Products,[19] established in 1929, is located in Elmira and manufactures 
parts mostly for the heavy truck industry; primarily truck chassis parts 
such as king pins and shackles. On July 26, 2012, an EF1 tornado touched 
down near Cottage Drive off of Route 352 and traveled through Golden Glow 
and the rest of the city. Moderate damage was seen after the storm passed 
and hundreds of trees and power lines were blown down. No one was injured. 
The tornado was 0.5 miles (0.80 km) wide and took the city by surprise 
as this area has not been prone to tornadic activity. Elmira is at 42°5′23″N 
76°48′34″W﻿ / ﻿42.08972°N 76.80944°W﻿ / 42.08972; -76.80944 (42.089874,

has an area of 7.6 sq mi (19.6 km2), of which, 7.3 sq mi (19.0 km2) of 
it is land and 0.27 sq mi (0.7 km2) of it (3.56%) is water. The Chemung 
River flows eastward through the city. Elmira is built almost entirely 
in the flood plain of the Chemung River and has suffered many floods, the 
worst from Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Newtown Creek, flowing from the north, 
joins the Chemung River at the city's southeast corner. New York State 
Route 17, The Southern Tier Expressway, connects with the city at Exit

Statistical Area (or Elmira MSA) is frequently used for statistical information 
such as labor rates and includes all of Chemung County with a population 
in 2000 of 90,070. The Elmira MSA was ranked as the 59th safest place to 
live out of 344 Metro Areas in 2005 by Morgan Quitno Press [2]. The three 
largest ethnic groups in Elmira are Irish, German and Italian. [3] The 
city government is a Council-Manager form of government in which the City 
Manager is the primary administrator of the City. There is one mayor elected 
at large and six council members elected from each of six council districts. 
The term of office of the mayor and councilmembers was 2 years until a 
referendum passed in 2003 extended the terms to 4 years (4 year terms began 
after the 2007 election). The mayor and councilmembers are all part-time 
employees. The City Manager, City Clerk, City Chamberlain, City Assessor, 
and Corporation Counsel are all appointed by the City Council. All remaining 
department heads serve at the request of the City Manager. The city has 
125 miles (201 km) of road, 210 miles (340 km) of water lines, and 175

It is featured on an Entrance sign erected in 2003 into the City from Exit 
56 of the Southern Tier Expressway along with other honored Elmirans including 
(L to R) Brian Williams, Hal Roach, Ernie Davis, Mark Twain, Eileen Collins, 
John Jones, and Tommy Hilfiger. The slogan was designated by Mayor Stephen 
Hughes following the conclusion of a slogan contest in which Marlin Stewart, 
Alan and Barbara Hutchinson, and James Lloyd were recognized for their 
contributions to the winning slogan. On at least two hilltops near the 
city (mostly on Harris Hill to the northwest) pioneer pilots established 
the sport of gliding in America. Harris Hill is the site of the National 
Soaring Museum. These sites are now recognized as National Landmarks of 
Soaring. The John Brand Jr. House, John Brand Sr. House, Buildings at 104-116
