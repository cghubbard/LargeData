George Lange Kelly (September 10, 1895 – October 13, 1984), nicknamed "Long 
George" and "High Pockets",[1][2] was a Major League Baseball (MLB) first 
baseman. He played most of his MLB career for the New York Giants (1915–1917, 
1919–1926), but also played for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1917), Cincinnati 
Reds (1927–1930), Chicago Cubs (1930), and Brooklyn Dodgers (1932). Kelly 
is a two-time World Series champion (1921 and 1922). He led the National 
League in home runs once (1921) and runs batted in twice (1920 and 1924), 
and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973. However, his selection 
is regarded as controversial, as many believe he is undeserving of the 
recognition and was only elected by the Veterans Committee because it consisted 
of his former teammates.[3][4][5][6] Kelly began his professional career 
for the Victoria Bees of the Class-B Northwestern League in 1914 and 1915.[7] 
During the 1915 season, he was purchased by the New York Giants from Victoria 
for $1,200 (equal to $28,117 today).[1] The Giants were rebuilding their 
team, and they saw Kelly as a possible replacement for Fred Merkle.[2] 
However, he played sparingly for the Giants in his first MLB seasons, appearing 
in only 17 games in 1915 and 49 games in 1916. He was selected off waivers 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 25, 1917 to back up Honus Wagner, but 
did not hit sufficiently.[2] The Pirates waived Kelly, and he was reclaimed 
by the Giants from the Pirates on August 4, 1917.[1] The Giants optioned 
Kelly to the Rochester Hustlers of the Class-AA International League, where 
he played the rest of the 1917 season.[7] Kelly did not play professionally 
in 1918 due to his military service.[2] The Giants sold Kelly to Rochester 
before the 1919 season to acquire Earl Smith.[8][9] Finding success in 
Rochester, Kelly was purchased by the Giants in 1919 when Hal Chase was 
suspended.[2] He became a regular in the Giants line-up in 1920, when he 
had a league-leading 94 runs batted in (RBIs).[1] He led the league in 
assists and putouts in 1920 and 1921; his 1,759 putouts in 1920 remains 
a league record.[2] Kelly batted in 100 or more runs for four consecutive 
seasons and hit for a batting average of .300 or higher six consecutive 
seasons.[1] He opened the 1921 season with at least one hit and one RBI 
in eight consecutive games, a record that stood until it was broken by 
Jorge Cantú in 2010.[10] The Giants appeared in the World Series in 1921, 
1922, 1923, and 1924, winning in 1921 and 1922. Kelly set a National League 
record with seven home runs in six consecutive games in 1924, which has 
since been matched by Graig Nettles, Walker Cooper, and Willie Mays.[11] 
In the final series of the 1924 season, the Giants were playing the Philadelphia 
Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers. Jimmy O'Connell offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to 
intentionally lose the games. Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to 
Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually led to the lifetime suspension 
of O'Connell and Giants coach Cozy Dolan by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis. O'Connell implicated Kelly, Frankie Frisch, and Ross Youngs as 
co-conspirators.[12] However, Commissioner Landis cleared Kelly, Frisch 
and Youngs of any wrongdoing.[13] That following offseason, Kelly, Sam 
Bohne and other Major League Baseball (MLB) players agreed to play professional 
basketball with O'Connell.[14] National League (NL) president John Heydler 
insisted that anyone who played with O'Connell could be suspended.[15] 
The Giants were also displeased with Kelly's arrangement, as they were 
concerned about the chance he could injure himself in non-baseball activity.[14] 
However, Kelly had not played in any games at that point. He was removed 
from the roster and thus avoided suspension by MLB.[16] Kelly, naturally 
a first baseman, saw regular time as a second baseman in 1925 when Frisch 
injured his hand, while backup Bill Terry began playing first base.[2] 
With the emergence of Terry, who requested a trade so that he could receive 
more playing time,[17] and Giants manager John McGraw desiring an improvement 
in the outfield, Kelly was traded to the Cincinnati Reds prior to the 1927 
season for Edd Roush.[18] The Reds traded Roush due to a contract dispute.[19] 
With Wally Pipp at first base for the Reds, Kelly was slated to play center 
field.[19] The Reds released Pipp before the 1929 season, and Kelly returned 
to first base.[20] Kelly was released by the Reds on July 10, 1930, and 
signed by the minor-league Minneapolis Millers of the Class-AA American 
Association.[1] The Millers traded Kelly to the Chicago Cubs for Mal Moss 
and a player to be named later (Chick Tolson) late in the 1930 season to 
fill in for the injured Charlie Grimm.[2] Kelly he was released by the 
Cubs in February 1931.[1] He returned to the Millers for the 1931 season, 
and participated in a tour of Japan along with Frisch, Lou Gehrig, Mickey 
Cochrane, Al Simmons, Lefty Grove, and Rabbit Maranville, among others.[21] 
In April 1932, the Millers traded Kelly to the Brooklyn Dodgers for Pea 
Ridge Day.[1] With the Dodgers, he filled in for the injured Del Bissonette.[8] 
Kelly played his final MLB game on July 27, 1932.[1] He returned to the 
International League to finish the 1932 season with the Jersey City Skeeters, 
and played the 1933 season for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League 
before retiring.[7] Kelly was known as an excellent defensive first baseman. 
His positioning and footwork on hits to the outfield became the standard 
method for teaching future first basemen to handle relays.[2] Frisch considered 
Kelly the finest first baseman he had seen.[22] Kelly also had a reputation 
as a clutch hitter. McGraw said there was no player he preferred to have 
bat in a big situation.[2] Waite Hoyt considered him dangerous in clutch 
situations.[22] "His arm was so tremendous that he was directed to be the 
relay man on throws from the outfield. His arm was better, in fact, than 
any of today's players I can think of." To be inducted in the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame, a player must receive at least 75% of the vote from 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) or the Veterans Committee.[4] 
Kelly was on the BBWAA ballot seven times, never coming close to being 
elected, and never garnering more than 1.9% of the vote. By year, voting 
results for Kelly were: 1947 (one vote, 0.6%), 1948 (two votes, 1.7%), 
1949 (one vote, 0.7%), 1956 (two votes, 1.0%), 1958 (two votes, 0.8%), 
1960 (five votes, 1.9%), and 1962 (two votes, 0.6%). Despite the lack of 
support from the BBWAA, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1973 by 
the Veterans Committee.[22] At the time of Kelly's election, the writers' 
ballot was voted on by approximately 400 writers, while the Veterans Committee 
had a membership of twelve former players and executives.[4] The selection 
of Kelly was controversial, as many felt Kelly was not worthy of enshrinement 
in the Hall.[3] According to the BBWAA, the Veterans Committee was not 
selective enough in choosing members.[4] Charges of cronyism were levied 
against the Veterans Committee.[5] When Kelly was elected, the Veterans 
Committee included two of his former teammates, Bill Terry and Frankie 
Frisch, who also shepherded the selections of Giants teammates Jesse Haines 
in 1970, Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, Ross Youngs in 1972, Jim 
Bottomley in 1974, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976.[23] This led to the Veterans 
Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years.[3] Baseball historian 
Bill James, while ranking Kelly as the 65th greatest first baseman of all-time, 
also cites Kelly as "the worst player in the Hall of Fame".[6] Kelly served 
as a coach for the Cincinnati Reds, managed by former teammate Chuck Dressen, 
from 1935 to 1937.[2] Former teammate Casey Stengel hired Kelly to coach 
the Boston Braves from 1938 to 1943.[2] He returned to the Reds' coaching 
staff in 1947 and 1948.[24] He coached the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific 
Coast League in 1949.[24] In 1954, Kelly managed the independent Wenatchee 
Chiefs in the Western International League.[7] A native San Franciscan, 
Kelly remained in the San Francisco Bay Area, living in Millbrae, California 
following his playing career.[24] Kelly's brother, Ren Kelly, uncle, Bill 
Lange, and cousin, Rich Chiles, also played in MLB.[24] Kelly suffered 
a stroke on October 5, 1984 and died on October 13 at Peninsula Hospital 
in Burlingame, California.[25] He is interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery
