Grant Robert Balfour (born 30 December 1977) is an Australian former professional 
baseball relief pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 
Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers, Tampa Bay Devil Rays / Rays, and Oakland 
Athletics. He is the all-time save leader and strikeout leader among Australian 
MLB pitchers,[1] and holds the Oakland Athletics consecutive save record 
at 44. Notable as one of only a handful of Australian-born Major League 
Baseball players, Balfour spent his first years at school attending Kings 
Langley Public School and high school years at William Clarke College in 
Kellyville, New South Wales. Balfour made his major league debut with the 
Minnesota Twins in 2001 and played with them until 2004. After missing 
2005 with an injury, he played in the Cincinnati Reds organization in 2006. 
After a three-year absence, Balfour made his return to the major leagues 
on 18 July, 2007, in the 8th inning with the Milwaukee Brewers. He relieved 
Chris Capuano in a 2–2 tie with the Arizona Diamondbacks, striking out 
Chris Young, the first hitter he faced. With two outs in the 8th, he hit 
a batter and walked another before giving up a three-run home run to Mark 
Reynolds, giving the Diamondbacks a 5–2 lead. Balfour would finish the 
8th and 9th inning and take the loss in relief, having given up three earned 
runs in the 5–2 defeat.[2] The Brewers designated Balfour for assignment 
on 27 July 2007, and traded him to the Tampa Bay Rays that day for Seth 
McClung.[3] He finished the season in the Rays' bullpen and was re-signed 
to a one-year deal.[4] He came into 2008 spring training as a long shot 
to make the Rays' bullpen. Despite a solid spring training, he eventually 
lost for on the final spot and was designated for assignment.[5] He cleared 
waivers and accepted an outright assignment to Durham on 3 April 2008.[6] 
He was recalled from Triple-A Durham on 29 May 2008.[7] He earned a save 
on 31 May against the Chicago White Sox, retiring Brian Anderson to end 
the game in a Rays 2–0 win.[8] In a series sweep against the Chicago Cubs 
at Tropicana Field, he was credited with two of the three wins – the first 
on 16 June, relieving Scott Kazmir with the score 1–1 and bases loaded, 
pitching 1 1⁄3 perfect innings in a 3–2 win;[9] the second on 18 June, 
entering the game trailing 1–2, and pitching 1 2⁄3 innings, recording three 
strikeouts, in a game the Rays won 8–3.[10] He finished 2008 with a 1.54 
ERA, a 6–2 record, 4 saves out of 5 opportunities, 14 holds, and 82 strikeouts 
over 58 1⁄3 IP in 51 appearances. He helped the Rays win their first divisional 
title and American League pennant (against the Boston Red Sox), losing 
to the Phillies in the World Series, In 2009, he chose to skip the 2009 
World Baseball Classic because the Rays asked him not to play for Australia 
while he was still under contract.[11] That season was much less successful 
for the Rays, who finished 84–78, 19 games behind the New York Yankees. 
Although he pitched considerably more innings and games pitched, he finished 
a disappointing 5–4, with 4 saves and a 4.81 ERA for the season with 69 
strikeouts compared to the previous season's 82. Balfour is known to shout 
at himself while on the mound and use profanity to fire himself up. On 
2 October 2008, during Game 1 of the ALDS, he was involved in an exchange 
of words with Chicago White Sox shortstop Orlando Cabrera. With the bases 
loaded and two outs, his first pitch to Cabrera was outside for ball one. 
Cabrera then kicked the dirt in front of the batter's box in the direction 
of the pitcher's mound and according to Balfour, Cabrera told him to "throw 
it over the plate." Unaware of Balfour's behavior while pitching, Cabrera 
was under the impression that he was the one being yelled at. The at-bat 
continued and ended with Cabrera striking out. Balfour stormed off the 
mound, yelling at Cabrera as he walked to the dugout. Balfour stated after 
the game that he told Cabrera to "go sit down" and that he "might have 
mixed one or two words in with it." Deemed a misunderstanding between the 
two, there were no further incidents in the series, with Balfour getting 
the final out as the Rays won three games to one.[12] In December 2009, 
he signed a new contract with Tampa Bay, worth $2.05 million over one year.[13] 
On 18 January 2011, Balfour signed a 2-year, $8 million contract with the 
Oakland Athletics.[14] On 20 March 2012, he was named the Athletics' closer 
over Brian Fuentes.[15] Balfour held the closer role for the early part 
of the 2012 season but was demoted after a few blown saves to the role 
of setup man. In early August, Balfour regained the closer role from Ryan 
Cook.[16] Balfour went 3–2 in 75 appearances with 24 saves in 74 2⁄3 innings 
pitched in 2012. On 29 October, the Athletics decided to exercise their 
option for Balfour worth $4.5M.[17] On 8 July 2013, Balfour set the record 
for most consecutive saves for the Athletics, earning his 41st in a 2–1 
win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.[18] He was selected later in the month 
as a replacement All-Star pitcher for teammate Bartolo Colón.[19] In 65 
appearances, Balfour finished the year 38-41 in save opportunities, going 
1-3 with a 2.59 ERA as the team's closer, striking out 72 in 62.2 innings 
with a .206 OBA. He pitched three scoreless innings in the ALDS against 
the Tigers, getting one win and one save. In Game 3 of the 2013 ALDS against 
the Detroit Tigers, Balfour began cursing at Victor Martinez, who then 
answered back, leading to both benches clearing. Balfour claimed that Martinez 
gave him a "viral death stare" prior to exchanging words as he composed 
it on Twitter. The A's would go on to win the game 6-3 but lost the series 
in 5 games.[20] On 17 December 2013, Balfour came to an agreement with 
the Baltimore Orioles on a two-year $15 million deal.[21] However, on 19 
December 2013, it was revealed that the deal was in serious jeopardy as 
a result of issues that came up during his physical.[22] On 20 December, 
the Orioles announced that they would not be signing him and that they 
would look elsewhere for relief help.[23] Balfour responded that he was 
perfectly healthy and other doctors who examined him disputed the Orioles 
interpretation of his physical results. He said he would consider filing 
a grievance with the players association.[24] Balfour subsequently agreed 
to a two-year contract with the Rays, worth $12 million.[25] After starting 
the 2014 season with a 6.46 ERA in 24 games, Balfour was removed from the 
closer role on 9 June 2014.[26] He was designated for assignment by the 
Rays on April 18, 2015,[27] and released on April 29.[28] Several days 
after the team released him, Balfour signed a minor league deal back with 
the Rays.[29] While pitching with Triple-A Durham, Balfour held a 2.79 
ERA in eight games, owning a 11:4 K:BB ratio over 9 2/3 innings. He opted 
out of his contract on May 28.[30] On 29 April 2016, Balfour announced 
his retirement.[31] Balfour's father, David, was a rugby player and general 
manager and owner of the Sydney Blue Sox. David was diagnosed with pancreatic 
cancer in 2010[32] and died on 10 March 2015.[33] Balfour was inducted
