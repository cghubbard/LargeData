Fogel Field was a baseball stadium, located in Hot Springs, Arkansas. The 
site was also known as Fordyce Field and Holder Field.[3][4] Fogel Field 
was built in 1912 as a spring training site for Major League Baseball teams. 
The field was named for Horace Fogel, President of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Fogel Field hosted the Phillies (1912) and the Pittsburgh Pirates (1921–1923, 
1926). The Kansas City Monarchs (1928), Homestead Grays (1930–1931) and 
Pittsburgh Crawfords (1932-1935) of Negro League Baseball also used Fogel 
Field as their spring training. Several minor league teams from the American 
Association utilized Fogel Field as well: Indianapolis Indians (1926–1927), 
Milwaukee Brewers (1927–1931) and St. Paul Saints (1934–1935) . The Montreal 
Royals of the International League (1932) trained at Fogel Field. Beginning 
with the spring of 1886, when the Chicago White Stockings' (today's Chicago 
Cubs) President Albert Spalding, the founder of A.G Spalding, and player/manager 
Cap Anson brought their players to Hot Springs, Arkansas. The concept was 
for players to have training and improved fitness before the start of the 
regular season. This move gave credit to Hot Springs being called the "birthplace 
of spring training baseball."[3][5][6] After the White Stockings had a 
successful season in 1886, winning the National League Pennant, other teams 
began bringing their players to Hot Springs.[6][7] The St. Louis Browns, 
New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Spiders, Detroit Tigers, 
Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, New York Highlanders, Brooklyn Dodgers 
and Boston Red Sox were among the early squads to arrive in Hot Springs. 
Needing venues to play, Whittington Park, Majestic Park and Fogel Field 
(1912) were all built in Hot Springs specifically to host Major League 
teams.[8] Later, Sam Guinn Field was built in 1933 at 497 Crescent Avenue 
to host Negro League Spring Training Teams.[9][10] After the Hot Spring 
Baseball Grounds were used for other purposes, that left Whittington Park 
and Majestic Park as the only two fields in Hot Springs. Fogel Field was 
than built by the Hot Springs Park Company in 1912 to meet the demand. 
Philadelphia Phillies' President and owner Horace Fogel secured the field 
for his franchise and the field was named after him. The Phillies used 
the field for the 1912 season. Located directly across the street from 
Whittington Park, Fogel Field had a small grandstand. Besides the Phillies, 
and Pirates, the park was utilized by teams using Whittington Park, due 
to its convenient proximity. Hall of famers such as Babe Ruth, Cy Young, 
Honus Wagner, Grover Cleveland Alexander and Pie Traynor were among the 
roster of players to play at the site.[3][11] Fogel was banned from baseball 
after the 1912 season for saying that umpires favored the New York Giants 
and were treating the Phillies unfairly. Thereafter, the park was called 
Fordyce Field for a time, renamed after the nearby Fordyce Bathhouse, just 
as Majestic Park had a namesake in the Majestic Hotel.[12][13][14] On St. 
Patrick's Day, 1918, Babe Ruth, played the field for the first time in 
a spring training game. Playing at Whittington Park with the Boston Red 
Sox, Ruth hit a home run that traveled an estimated 573 feet. The home 
run sailed over Whittington Avenue, landing in the Arkansas Alligator Farm, 
which still exists, mostly unchanged. Fogel Field sits just adjacent to 
the Alligator Farm. At the time, Ruth had exclusively been a successful 
left-handed pitcher, but in part due to his home run that day, he soon 
switched to hitting. Today, the Alligator Farm has a marker recognizing 
the Ruth home run, near the marker for Fogel Field.[15][16][17] After the 
Phillies, with Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, in 1912, 
the Pirates followed at Fegel Field in 1921, having utilized Whittington 
Park for many years. The Pirates (1921–23, 1926) trained with rosters that 
included Baseball Hall of Famers Rabbit Maranville, Kiki Cuyler, Charlie 
Grimm, Joe Cronin, Paul Waner, Pie Traynor and Max Carey. Major League 
teams eventually migrated to the warmer climates of Florida and Arizona 
for spring training. Fogel Field became then the spring training site for 
Negro League and Minor League teams. The Negro League Kansas City Monarchs 
(1928), Homestead Grays (1930–31) and Pittsburgh Crawfords (1932–35) utilized 
the site. The 1935 Pittsburgh Crawfords have been called one of the best 
teams ever assembled. Indianapolis, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Montreal were 
Minor League franchises that utilized Fogel Field for spring training.[2] 
From 1938-1941 the Hot Springs Bathers used the field for batting practice 
and other practices, as their Whittington Park home field was just across 
the street.[18] The Pittsburgh Crawfords of the Negro Major Leagues utilized 
Fogel Field for spring training from 1932-35. The 1935 Crawfords team has 
been called one of the greatest teams ever assembled, eventually winning 
the 1935 Negro League World Series. With a roster full of stars and future 
Hall-of Fame players, the 1935 Crawfords were nicknamed "the best team 
money could buy," as many of their players came from other clubs. Their 
1935 roster contained Baseball Hall of Fame Inductees Cool Papa Bell, Josh 
Gibson, Oscar Charleston and Judy Johnson.[19][20][21] The Negro League 
Homestead Grays, which represented the borough of Homestead, Pennsylvania, 
located 7 miles from Pittsburgh, held spring training at the Field in 1930 
and 1931. On their roster were numerous Hall of Fame players: Cool Papa 
Bell, Josh Gibson, Oscar Charleston, Jud Wilson, Bill Foster, Judy Johnson, 
Smokey Joe Williams and Willie Wells. Franchise owner Cum Posey was also 
inducted into the Hall of Fame.[22] The 1928 Monarchs who used Fogel Field 
had Baseball Hall of Fame Inductees Andy Cooper and Bullet Rogan.[23] Among 
other minor league teams, the 1935 St. Paul Saints trained at the site. 
A pitcher for the squad was Monty Stratton. Stratton was portrayed by Jimmy 
Stewart in The Stratton Story. An All-Star pitcher for the Chicago White 
Sox, Stratton lost his leg in an accident during the height of his career 
and pitched afterwards with a prosthetic leg.[24][25][26] From 1933–38, 
the annual Ray Doan Baseball School was held in Hot Springs, with Fogel 
Field utilized as one site for the hundreds of campers. Doan's school drew 
hundreds of younger players annually, with 1938 drawing 450 players. Doan 
had many noteworthy players on his instructional staff, including Rogers 
Hornsby, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Red Faber, Dizzy Dean, George Sisler, 
Bob Feller, Tris Speaker and Burleigh Grimes.[3][27] Legendary female athlete 
Babe Didrickson, attended in 1933. At the time Didrickson was the reigning 
Olympic Gold Medalist hurdler in the 1932 Summer Olympic Games and she 
went on to major success in professional golf.[28] In 1939, Rogers Hornsby 
took over for Doan in Hot Springs and created the Rogers Hornsby Baseball 
College which operated until the 1950s, continuing to utilize Fogel Field.[11] 
The first recognized Umpire School was held in conjunction with both baseball 
schools, starting in 1935. Drawing aspiring umpires, the George Barr Umpire 
School was the first of its kind and was operated by Major League umpire 
George Barr. Future Major League Umpires Bill McKinley and Scotty Robb 
were attendees, as was war hero Harry Ladner.[29][30] The National Baseball 
Hall of Fame library has a series of photos of the baseball schools and 
Cassidy Lent, Reference Librarian at the Hall of Fame, wrote the feature 
School Days in Arkansas, highlighting the baseball schools with mention 
of their use of Fogel Field.[3] Memorabilia from the Umpire School, baseball 
schools and George Barr's umpiring career are on display at the Oklahoma 
Sports Hall of Fame. The items were donated by George Barr.[31] The George 
Barr Umpire School and the Hornsby Baseball School were featured in the 
March 10, 1947 issue of Life.[32][33] Fogel Field is featured in The First 
Boys of Spring, a 2015 documentary on Hot Springs Spring Training produced 
by Larry Foley. The film is narrated by Hot Springs area native, actor 
Billy Bob Thornton.[34][35][36] The documentary began airing nationally 
on the MLB Network in February, 2016.[37] The grass field still exists 
at the site and is used by the Arkansas Alligator Farm for overflow parking.[38] 
There are two plaques at the site. The plaques are part of the Hot Springs 
Baseball Historic Trail and recognize Fogel Field and Babe Ruth. The ballpark 
plaque reads: This field, also known as Fordyce Field, was constructed 
in 1912 by the Hot Springs Park Company to meet the demand of over 250 
major leaguers training in Hot Springs. The Philadelphia Phillies’ owner 
Horace Fogel, leased the field for his team. The Phillies’ roster included 
pitching legend Grover Cleveland Alexander and slugging outfielders Gavvy 
Cravath and Sherwood Magee. The training ground was also later used by 
the Pittsburgh Pirates.[4][12] The plaque for Babe Ruth says the following: 
Ruth trained here nine times and became a very familiar face around Hot 
Springs. He hiked the mountains, took the baths, played golf, patronized 
the casinos, and visited the racetrack. On March 17, 1918 (St. Patrick’s 
Day), he launched a mammoth home run from Whittington Park that landed 
on the fly, inside the Arkansas Alligator Farm. It has been measured at
