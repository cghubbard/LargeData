Michael Ray Bourn (born December 27, 1982) is an American professional 
baseball center fielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, Houston Astros, Atlanta Braves, 
Cleveland Indians, Arizona Diamondbacks and Baltimore Orioles. He has also 
been a member of the United States national baseball team. Bourn was raised 
in Houston, Texas, where he attended Nimitz High School and the University 
of Houston, playing baseball. He was named to the NL All-Star team in both 
2010 and 2012 and won consecutive Gold Glove Awards in 2009 and 2010. Bourn 
also led the MLB in stolen bases in 2011, and led the National League in 
stolen bases from 2009–2011. He is currently 157th place on the all-time 
Major League Baseball stolen base list with 326. Michael Ray Bourn was 
born in Houston, Texas on December 27, 1982, the first of two sons to parents 
Carrie and Raymond. As a child, Michael played three sports, baseball, 
basketball and football.[1] His Little League team was coached by his father. 
Teammates included Carl Crawford. At the age of 10, his father had him 
facing 85-mile-per-hour (137 km/h) pitching in a batting cage.[2] Bourn 
attended Nimitz High School in Houston. He earned a scholarship to play 
college baseball at the University of Houston for the Houston Cougars baseball 
team, competing in NCAA Division I. He played with the Cougars for three 
seasons. While he displayed little power, collecting only two home runs 
and 23 extra-base hits in 644 at-bats, he won attention from professional 
scouts by posting a .431 on-base percentage and stealing 90 bases in 119 
attempts.[3] He was named to the All-Tournament Team at the 2002 Conference 
USA Baseball Tournament, in which Houston was the runner-up.[4] In June 
2003, following his junior year, the Philadelphia Phillies drafted Bourn 
in the fourth round, with the 115th overall selection of baseball's first-year 
player draft. Bourn signed shortly after the draft, and was assigned to 
play for the Batavia Muckdogs of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn 
League. In 2004, Bourn was the starting center fielder with the Lakewood 
BlueClaws of the Class A South Atlantic League. Bourn ended the season 
with a .433 on-base percentage and an OPS of .903, earning 85 bases on 
balls in 109 games. He also stole 57 bases in 63 attempts – a success rate 
of over ninety percent. Following the season, he was named to Baseball 
America's Top Ten Prospects list for the Phillies organization.[citation

Class AA Eastern League, and was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Red Barons of the Class AAA International League late in July 2006. In 
early September 2006, Bourn took a brief hiatus from his professional obligations 
to play for the USA Olympic qualifying team, for whom he hit two home runs 
to help Team USA defeat Cuba in the gold-medal game. Bourn was then promoted 
to the expanded major league roster. He was sent to home plate to bat only 
11 times during the month of September, but was used frequently as a pinch 
runner as the Phillies competed for the National League's wild card position 
(ultimately coming up two games short) to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Disappointingly, 
he stole only one base in three attempts during the month, and was memorably 
tagged out after accidentally oversliding second base on a steal attempt 
in a late-season loss against the Washington Nationals on September 26, 
2006.[5] After a strong performance during spring training in 2007, Bourn 
won a position on the Phillies' major league roster to begin the year. 
He was used sparingly, appearing primarily as a frequent defensive replacement 
in left field for Pat Burrell. On July 15, 2007, Bourn hit his first career 
home run as the Phillies recorded their 10,000th franchise loss by losing 
to the St. Louis Cardinals 10–2.[6] On July 27, Bourn was in the Phillies' 
starting lineup for the first time due to injuries to both Chase Utley 
and Aaron Rowand, and had his first 4-hit game in an 8–1 rout of the Pirates, 
in which he scored two runs. Bourn finished third among all NL rookies 
with 18 stolen bases, and was caught only once.[7] He batted .277. On November 
7, 2007 Bourn was traded along with Geoff Geary and Mike Costanzo to the 
Houston Astros for Brad Lidge and Eric Bruntlett.[8] Houston's General 
Manager, Ed Wade, declared Bourn as the 2008 Astros' leadoff hitter and 
starting center fielder, effectively moving Hunter Pence to right field. 
Bourn stole 41 bases in 2008. Among players who had enough plate appearances 
to qualify, Bourn's OPS was the worst in the Majors in 2008. He finished 
the season with a .229 batting average and a major league-low .288 on-base 
percentage and a major league-low OPS of .588, while striking out 111 times 
in his 467 at-bats.[9] In 2009 spring training, Bourn led all players in 
steals, with 13, while being caught twice. Bourn had a major turnaround 
year, as he finished with 61 stolen bases, which was the most in the National 
League and second in the Majors only to the 70 steals by Jacoby Ellsbury, 
to go along with a .285 BA and a .354 OBP in 157 games, as well as 27 doubles 
and 12 triples (tied for second most in the Majors with Stephen Drew) in 
606 ABs. Bourn's OPS went from .588 in 2008 to .738 in 2009, which was 
the eighth best improvement in the Majors.[10] His much improved play prompted 
former manager Cecil Cooper to informally name him the club MVP before 
he was fired.[11] The Houston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America formally named Bourn the Astros 2009 team MVP shortly after 
the end of the season.[12] Changing his uniform number to 21, Bourn followed 
up his breakout season with another successful year in 2010, being elected 
to the National League All-Star team[13] and was in the outfield when the 
final out of the game was recorded. Bourn suffered an oblique injury on 
September 19 while swinging at a pitch,[14] causing him to miss the final 
3 weeks of the season. He finished the year hitting .265 with a .341 on-base 
percentage and a .346 slugging percentage. He won a Fielding Bible Award 
for his statistically based defensive excellence in center field during 
the year.[15] He was later awarded his second consecutive Gold Glove award 
on November 10.[16] In July 2011, prior to the trade deadline, Bourn was 
traded to the Atlanta Braves for Jordan Schafer, Brett Oberholtzer, Paul 
Clemens and Juan Abreu. Bourn finished 2011 with a career best .294 batting 
average and 61 stolen bases (39 with the Astros and 22 with the Braves).[17] 
Bourn was named a candidate in the All-Star Final Vote, with the winner 
being added to the 2012 MLB All-Star Game roster. Bourn finished second 
behind David Freese[18] but was added to the roster a day later as a replacement 
for the injured Ian Desmond.[19] In 2012, Bourn hit .274 and with a .739 
OPS for the Braves. He stole 42 bases and hit a career high nine home runs. 
His 155 strikeouts were a new career high.[20] Bourn finished 18th in the 
voting for the N.L. MVP.[21] In November, Bourn rejected the Braves $13.3 
million qualifying offer and became a free agent.[22] On February 11, 2013, 
Bourn agreed to a four-year, $48 million contract with the Cleveland Indians 
that includes a vesting option for 2017, which would be met if he records 
550 plate appearances in the final guaranteed year, 2016.[23] He is the 
Tribe's first player to wear a number 24 on his back since Grady Sizemore 
from 2004 to 2011. Bourn played in 130 games in 2013, as he battled injuries 
throughout the season. He had 23 steals, which was his lowest total since 
2007,[24] when he was with the Philadelphia Phillies. On May 27, 2014, 
Bourn robbed White Sox captain Paul Konerko of a two-run homer in the 8th 
inning.[25] The Indians lost that game 2–1. On May 30, Bourn collected 
his 1,000 career hit in eventual win over the Colorado Rockies.[26] Two 
days later on June 1, Bourn hit a walk-off two-run home run to lead the 
Indians to a 6–4 win over and three–game sweep of the Rockies.[27] Bourn 
struggled offensively to begin the 2015 season. On April 26 against the 
Detroit Tigers, he was dropped from the leadoff spot in the lineup for 
the first time as a Cleveland Indian as a result of his struggles, batting 
ninth instead.[28] On August 7, 2015, the Indians traded Bourn and Nick 
Swisher with cash considerations to the Atlanta Braves for Chris Johnson.[29] 
He was designated for assignment on April 2, 2016,[30] and released on 
April 14.[31] Bourn signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue 
Jays on April 22, 2016.[32] He was assigned to the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue 
Jays, and hit .257 in 9 games before being released on May 7.[33][34] On 
May 10, 2016, Bourn signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[35] 
The Diamondbacks assigned Bourn to the Mobile BayBears of the Class AA 
Southern League.[36] After playing in five games for Mobile, the Diamondbacks 
promoted Bourn to the major leagues.[37] In 89 games with the Diamondbacks, 
Bourn slashed .262/.307/.373 with 21 extra-base hits while driving in 30 
runs and stealing 13 bases. The Diamondbacks traded Bourn to the Baltimore 
Orioles for Jason Heinrich on August 31, 2016.[38] Bourn made an immediate 
impact with the O's with his offense, speed and defense, including an outfield 
assist to end the game in a 5-4 win against the Rays to preserve teammate 
Zach Britton's perfect season as a closer. Michael has one son, Bryson,
