The 1927 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 46th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri, and its 36th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
92â€“61 during the season and finished second in the National League. In 
a deal that shocked the baseball world, the Cardinals traded long-time 
star Rogers Hornsby on December 20, 1926, to the New York Giants for Frankie 
Frisch and Jimmy Ring. The deal was held up because Hornsby, as part of 
his contract as the manager of the Cardinals (he was a player-manager at 
the time), owned several shares of stock in the Cardinals. Cardinals owner 
Sam Breadon offered Hornsby a sum for the stock considerably lower than 
what Hornsby demanded for it, and neither would budge. Eventually, the 
other owners of the National League made up the difference, and the trade 
went through.[citation needed] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders
