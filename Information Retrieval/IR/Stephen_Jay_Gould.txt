Stephen Jay Gould (/ɡuːld/; September 10, 1941 – May 20, 2002) was an American 
paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and historian of science. He was 
also one of the most influential and widely read writers of popular science 
of his generation.[1] Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard 
University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New 
York. In 1996 Gould was also appointed as the Vincent Astor Visiting Research 
Professor of Biology at New York University, where he divided his time 
teaching there and at Harvard. Gould's most significant contribution to 
evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he 
developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972.[2] The theory proposes that most 
evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which 
is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The 
theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that 
evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change 
in the fossil record.[3] Most of Gould's empirical research was based on 
the land snail genera Poecilozonites and Cerion. He also contributed to 
evolutionary developmental biology, and has received wide praise for his 
book Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, 
sociobiology as applied to humans, and evolutionary psychology. He campaigned 
against creationism and proposed that science and religion should be considered 
two distinct fields (or "magisteria") whose authorities do not overlap.[4] 
Gould was known by the general public mainly from his 300 popular essays 
in the magazine Natural History,[5] and his books written for both the 
specialist and non-specialist. In April 2000, the US Library of Congress 
named him a "Living Legend".[6] Stephen Jay Gould was born and raised in 
the community of Bayside, a neighborhood of the northeastern section of 
Queens in New York City. His father Leonard was a court stenographer and 
a World War II veteran in the United States Navy. His mother Eleanor was 
an artist whose parents were Jewish immigrants living and working in the 
city's Garment District.[7] When Gould was five years old his father took 
him to the Hall of Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History, 
where he first encountered Tyrannosaurus rex. "I had no idea there were 
such things—I was awestruck," Gould once recalled.[8] It was in that moment 
that he decided to become a paleontologist. Raised in a secular Jewish 
home, Gould did not formally practice religion and preferred to be called 
an agnostic.[9] When asked directly if he was an agnostic in Skeptic magazine, 
he responded: If you absolutely forced me to bet on the existence of a 
conventional anthropomorphic deity, of course I'd bet no. But, basically, 
Huxley was right when he said that agnosticism is the only honorable position 
because we really cannot know. And that's right. I'd be real surprised 
if there turned out to be a conventional God. Though he "had been brought 
up by a Marxist father",[10] he stated that his father's politics were 
"very different" from his own.[11] In describing his own political views, 
he has said they "tend to the left of center."[12] According to Gould the 
most influential political books he read were C. Wright Mills' The Power 
Elite and the political writings of Noam Chomsky.[12] While attending Antioch 
College in the early 1960s, Gould was active in the civil rights movement 
and often campaigned for social justice.[13] When he attended the University 
of Leeds as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations 
outside a Bradford dance hall which refused to admit black people. Gould 
continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked.[14] Throughout 
his career and writings, he spoke out against cultural oppression in all 
its forms, especially what he saw as the pseudoscience used in the service 
of racism and sexism.[15] Interspersed throughout his scientific essays 
for Natural History magazine, Gould frequently referred to his nonscientific 
interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected baseball cards and remained 
a New York Yankees fan throughout his life.[16] As an adult he was fond 
of science fiction movies, but often deplored their poor storytelling and 
presentation of science.[17] His other interests included singing baritone 
in the Boston Cecilia, and he was a great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan 
operas.[18] He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm 
for architecture, and enjoyed city walks. He often traveled to Europe, 
and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully 
to his tendency to put on weight.[19] Gould married artist Deborah Lee 
on October 3, 1965.[20] Gould met Lee while they were students together 
at Antioch College.[8] They had two sons, Jesse and Ethan, and were married 
for 30 years.[21] His second marriage in 1995 was to artist and sculptor 
Rhonda Roland Shearer.[20] In July 1982, Gould was diagnosed with peritoneal 
mesothelioma, a deadly form of cancer affecting the abdominal lining and 
frequently found in people who have been exposed to asbestos or rock dust. 
After a difficult two-year recovery, Gould published a column for Discover 
magazine entitled, "The Median Isn't the Message", which discusses his 
stunned reaction to discovering that, "mesothelioma is incurable, with 
a median mortality of only eight months after discovery."[22] He then describes 
the true significance behind this number, and his relief upon realizing 
that statistical averages are merely useful abstractions, and by themselves 
do not encompass the full range of variation. The median is the halfway 
point, which means that 50% of people will die before eight months, but 
the other half will live longer, potentially much longer. He then needed 
to determine where his personal characteristics placed him within this 
range. Given that the cancer was detected early, he was young, optimistic, 
and had the best treatments available, Gould reasoned that he should be 
in the favorable half of the upper statistical range. After an experimental 
treatment of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, 
and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients. Gould 
was also an advocate of medical cannabis. When undergoing his cancer treatments 
he smoked marijuana to help alleviate the long periods of intense and uncontrollable 
nausea. According to Gould, the drug had a "most important effect" on his 
eventual recovery. He later complained that he could not understand how 
"any humane person would withhold such a beneficial substance from people 
in such great need simply because others use it for different purposes."[23] 
On August 5, 1998 Gould's testimony assisted in the successful lawsuit 
of HIV activist Jim Wakeford, who sued the Government of Canada for the 
right to cultivate, possess, and use marijuana for medical purposes.[24] 
Gould survived for 20 years until another cancer ended his life. Gould 
died on May 20, 2002, from a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, a form 
of cancer which had spread to his brain, liver, and spleen.[25] This cancer 
was unrelated to his abdominal cancer.[26] He died in his home "in a bed 
set up in the library of his SoHo loft, surrounded by his wife Rhonda, 
his mother Eleanor, and the many books he loved."[27] Gould began his higher 
education at Antioch College, graduating with a double major in geology 
and philosophy in 1963.[28] During this time, he also studied at the University 
of Leeds in the United Kingdom.[29] After completing graduate work at Columbia 
University in 1967 under the guidance of Norman Newell, he was immediately 
hired by Harvard University where he worked until the end of his life (1967–2002). 
In 1973, Harvard promoted him to professor of geology and curator of invertebrate 
paleontology at the institution's Museum of Comparative Zoology. In 1982 
Harvard awarded him the title of Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology. 
The following year, 1983, he was awarded a fellowship at the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science, where he later served as president (1999–2001). 
The AAAS news release cited his "numerous contributions to both scientific 
progress and the public understanding of science."[30] He also served as 
president of the Paleontological Society (1985–1986) and of the Society 
for the Study of Evolution (1990–1991). In 1989 Gould was elected into 
the body of the National Academy of Sciences. Through 1996–2002 Gould was 
Vincent Astor Visiting Research Professor of Biology at New York University. 
In 2001, the American Humanist Association named him the Humanist of the 
Year for his lifetime of work. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the 
Darwin-Wallace Medal, along with 12 other recipients. (Until 2008, this 
medal had been awarded every 50 years by the Linnean Society of London.[31]) 
Early in his career, Gould and Niles Eldredge developed the theory of punctuated 
equilibrium, according to which evolutionary change occurs relatively rapidly, 
alternating with longer periods of relative evolutionary stability.[2] 
Although Gould coined the term "punctuated equilibria" the idea was first 
presented in Eldredge's doctoral dissertation on Devonian trilobites and 
in an article published the previous year on allopatric speciation.[32] 
According to Gould, punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar "in the 
central logic of Darwinian theory."[11] Some evolutionary biologists have 
argued that while punctuated equilibrium was "of great interest to biology 
generally,"[33] it merely modified neo-Darwinism in a manner that was fully 
compatible with what had been known before.[34] Other biologists emphasize 
the theoretical novelty of punctuated equilibrium, and argued that evolutionary 
stasis had been "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" and "had a 
major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology."[35] Comparisons 
were made to George Gaylord Simpson's work in Tempo and Mode in Evolution 
(1941), which describes the paleontological record as being characterized 
by mostly gradual change (horotely), but also included slow (bradytely), 
or rapid (tachytely) rates of evolution. Both punctuated equilibrium and 
phyletic gradualism are not mutually incompatible, and examples of each 
have been documented in different lineages. The debate between these two 
models is often misunderstood by non-scientists, and according to Richard 
Dawkins has been oversold by the media.[36] Some critics jokingly referred 
to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as "evolution by jerks",[37] which 
prompted Gould to describe phyletic gradualism as "evolution by creeps."[38] 
Gould made significant contributions to evolutionary developmental biology,[39] 
especially in his work Ontogeny and Phylogeny.[28] In this book he emphasized 
the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: 
neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is 
slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. 
Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development 
by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. 
Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues 
to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.[40] Gould 
was a champion of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental 
pathways, as well as other non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather 
than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human 
brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe 
such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist 
Elisabeth Vrba.[41] Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines 
an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. 
In 1975, Gould's Harvard colleague E. O. Wilson introduced his analysis 
of animal behavior (including human behavior) based on a sociobiological 
framework that suggested that many social behaviors have a strong evolutionary 
basis.[42] In response, Gould, Richard Lewontin, and others from the Boston 
area wrote the subsequently well-referenced letter to The New York Review 
of Books entitled, "Against 'Sociobiology'". This open letter criticized 
Wilson's notion of a "deterministic view of human society and human action."[43] 
But Gould did not rule out sociobiological explanations for many aspects 
of animal behavior, and later wrote: "Sociobiologists have broadened their 
range of selective stories by invoking concepts of inclusive fitness and 
kin selection to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of 
altruism—previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory 
of social behavior... Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have 
success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic 
Darwinism to a realm where it should apply."[44] With Richard Lewontin, 
Gould wrote an influential 1979 paper entitled, "The Spandrels of San Marco 
and the panglossian paradigm",[45] which introduced the architectural term 
"spandrel" into evolutionary biology. In architecture, a spandrel is a 
curved area of masonry which exists between arches supporting a dome. Spandrels, 
also called pendentives in this context, are found particularly in Gothic 
churches. When visiting Venice in 1978, Gould noted that the spandrels 
of the San Marco cathedral, while quite beautiful, were not spaces planned 
by the architect. Rather the spaces arise as "necessary architectural byproducts 
of mounting a dome on rounded arches." Gould and Lewontin thus defined 
"spandrels" in the evolutionary biology context, to mean any biological 
feature of an organism that arises as a necessary side consequence of other 
features, which is not directly selected for by natural selection. Proposed 
examples include the "masculinized genitalia in female hyenas, exaptive 
use of an umbilicus as a brooding chamber by snails, the shoulder hump 
of the giant Irish deer, and several key features of human mentality."[46] 
In Voltaire's Candide, Dr. Pangloss is portrayed as a clueless scholar 
who, despite the evidence, insists that "all is for the best in this best 
of all possible worlds". Gould and Lewontin asserted that it is Panglossian 
for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as atomized things that 
had been naturally selected for, and criticised biologists for not granting 
theoretical space to other causes, such as phyletic and developmental constraints. 
The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features 
in nature, remains a controversial topic in evolutionary biology.[47] An 
illustrative example of Gould's approach can be found in Elisabeth Lloyd's 
case study suggesting that the female orgasm is a by-product of shared 
developmental pathways.[48] Gould also wrote on this topic in his essay 
"Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples"[49] prompted by Lloyd's earlier work. 
Gould favored the argument that evolution has no inherent drive towards 
long-term "progress". Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as 
a ladder of progress, leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, 
the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get 
more complex and ultimately more like humankind. Gould argued that evolution's 
drive was not towards complexity, but towards diversification. Because 
life is constrained to begin with a simple starting point (like bacteria), 
any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed 
distribution and therefore be perceived to move in the direction of higher 
complexity. But life, Gould argued, can also easily adapt towards simplification, 
as is often the case with parasites.[50] In a review of Full House, Richard 
Dawkins approved of Gould's general argument, but suggested that he saw 
evidence of a "tendency for lineages to improve cumulatively their adaptive 
fit to their particular way of life, by increasing the numbers of features 
which combine together in adaptive complexes. ... By this definition, adaptive 
evolution is not just incidentally progressive, it is deeply, dyed-in-the-wool, 
indispensably progressive."[51] Gould never embraced cladistics as a method 
of investigating evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he 
was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details 
in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 
1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply 
quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the 
methods to be used in interpreting these fossils.[52] Around this time 
cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary 
biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made 
it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their 
characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase 
chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of 
analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.[53] Most of Gould's 
empirical research pertained to land snails. He focused his early work 
on the Bermudian genus Poecilozonites, while his later work concentrated 
on the West Indian genus Cerion. According to Gould "Cerion is the land 
snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 
600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really 
species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon 
which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like 
golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the 
evolution of form, and the problem of how it is that you can get this diversity 
amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting 
one. And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the 
evolution of form."[54] Given Cerion's extensive geographic diversity, 
Gould later lamented that if Christopher Columbus had only cataloged a 
single Cerion it would have ended the scholarly debate about which island 
Columbus had first set foot on in America.[55] Gould is one of the most 
frequently cited scientists in the field of evolutionary theory. His 1979 
"spandrels" paper has been cited more than 5,000 times.[56] In Paleobiology—the 
flagship journal of his own speciality—only Charles Darwin and George Gaylord 
Simpson have been cited more often.[57] Gould was also a considerably respected 
historian of science. Historian Ronald Numbers has been quoted as saying: 
"I can't say much about Gould's strengths as a scientist, but for a long 
time I've regarded him as the second most influential historian of science 
(next to Thomas Kuhn)."[58] Shortly before his death, Gould published The 
Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002), a long treatise recapitulating 
his version of modern evolutionary theory. In the film Beauty and Consolation 
Gould remarked, "In a couple of years I will be able to gather in one volume 
my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because 
it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. 
That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far 
too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals—very different 
from my popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation to me 
because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about 
evolution that I've struggled with all my life."[59] Gould became widely 
known through his popular essays on evolution in the Natural History magazine. 
His essays were published in a series titled This View of Life (a phrase 
from the concluding paragraph of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species) starting 
from January 1974 and ended in January 2001, amounting to a continuous 
publication of 300 essays.[5] Many of his essays were reprinted in collected 
volumes that became bestselling books such as Ever Since Darwin and The 
Panda's Thumb, Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, and The Flamingo's Smile. 
A passionate advocate of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically 
on the subject, trying to communicate his understanding of contemporary 
evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings 
is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. 
He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of 
baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. 
Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published 
book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).[16] Although a proud Darwinist, 
Gould's emphasis was less gradualist and reductionist than most neo-Darwinists. 
He fiercely opposed many aspects of sociobiology and its intellectual descendant 
evolutionary psychology. He devoted considerable time to fighting against 
creationism, creation science, and intelligent design. Most notably, Gould 
provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in McLean 
v. Arkansas. Gould later developed the term "non-overlapping magisteria" 
(NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion could not comment 
on each other's realm. Gould went on to develop this idea in some detail, 
particularly in the books Rocks of Ages (1999) and The Hedgehog, the Fox, 
and the Magister's Pox (2003). In a 1982 essay for Natural History Gould 
wrote: Our failure to discern a universal good does not record any lack 
of insight or ingenuity, but merely demonstrates that nature contains no 
moral messages framed in human terms. Morality is a subject for philosophers, 
theologians, students of the humanities, indeed for all thinking people. 
The answers will not be read passively from nature; they do not, and cannot, 
arise from the data of science. The factual state of the world does not 
teach us how we, with our powers for good and evil, should alter or preserve 
it in the most ethical manner.[60] The anti-evolution petition A Scientific 
Dissent From Darwinism spawned the National Center for Science Education's 
pro-evolution counterpart Project Steve, which is named in Gould's honor.[61] 
Gould also became a noted public face of science, often appearing on television. 
In 1984 Gould received his own NOVA special on PBS.[62] Other appearances 
included interviews on CNN's Crossfire, NBC's The Today Show, and regular 
appearances on the Charlie Rose show. Gould was also a guest in all seven 
episodes of the Dutch talk series A Glorious Accident, in which he appeared 
with his close friend Oliver Sacks.[63] Gould was featured prominently 
as a guest in Ken Burns's PBS documentary Baseball, as well as PBS's Evolution 
series. Gould was also on the Board of Advisers to the influential Children's 
Television Workshop television show 3-2-1 Contact, where he made frequent 
guest appearances. In 1997 he voiced a cartoon version of himself on the 
television series The Simpsons. In the episode "Lisa the Skeptic", Lisa 
finds a skeleton that many people believe is an apocalyptic angel. Lisa 
contacts Gould and asks him to test the skeleton's DNA. The fossil is discovered 
to be a marketing gimmick for a new mall.[64] During production the only 
phrase Gould objected to was a line in the script that introduced him as 
the "world's most brilliant paleontologist".[65] In 2002 the show paid 
tribute to Gould after his death, dedicating the season 13 finale to his 
memory. Gould had died two days before the episode aired. Gould received 
many accolades for his scholarly work and popular expositions of natural 
history,[66] but a number of biologists felt his public presentations were 
out of step with mainstream evolutionary thinking.[67] The public debates 
between Gould's supporters and detractors have been so quarrelsome that 
they have been dubbed "The Darwin Wars" by several commentators.[68][69] 
Eminent British evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith was among Gould's 
strongest critics. Maynard Smith thought that Gould misjudged the vital 
role of adaptation in biology, and was critical of Gould's acceptance of 
species selection as a major component of biological evolution.[70] In 
a review of Daniel Dennett's book Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Maynard Smith 
wrote that Gould "is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the 
state of evolutionary theory."[71] But Maynard Smith has not been consistently 
negative, writing in a review of The Panda's Thumb that "Stephen Gould 
is the best writer of popular science now active... Often he infuriates 
me, but I hope he will go right on writing essays like these."[72] Maynard 
Smith was also among those who welcomed Gould's reinvigoration of evolutionary 
paleontology.[34] One reason for criticism was that Gould appeared to be 
presenting his ideas as a revolutionary way of understanding evolution, 
and argued for the importance of mechanisms other than natural selection, 
mechanisms which he believed had been ignored by many professional evolutionists. 
As a result, many non-specialists sometimes inferred from his early writings 
that Darwinian explanations had been proven to be unscientific (which Gould 
never tried to imply). Along with many other researchers in the field, 
Gould's works were sometimes deliberately taken out of context by creationists 
as "proof" that scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved.[73] 
Gould himself corrected some of these misinterpretations and distortions 
of his writings in later works.[74] As documented by Kim Sterelny in his 
book Dawkins vs. Gould, Gould disagreed with Richard Dawkins about the 
importance of gene selection in evolution. Dawkins argued that the primary 
"batttleground" of natural selection as a driver of evolution is competition 
among genes (or replicators), while Gould seemed to place multi-level selection, 
including selection amongst cell lineages, organisms, demes, species, and 
clades on and equal importance to competition between genes in evolution.[69] 
Dawkins also said that Gould deliberately played down the difference between 
rapid gradualism and macromutation in his theory of punctuated equilibrium.[75] 
A more complete discussion of Gould's theory of punctuated equilibrium 
can be found in Dawkins's The Blind Watchmaker, Unweaving the Rainbow, 
as well as a chapter in Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea. In his memoir 
Brief Candle in the Dark, Dawkins noted in reference to Gould, that often 
the media can leave the public with a much amplified sense of "controversy" 
amongst scientists, as a technique to "sell copy", which does not help 
scientists clarify their opinions and reach a common understanding. Gould's 
interpretation of the Cambrian Burgess Shale fossils in his book Wonderful 
Life emphasized the striking morphological disparity (or "weirdness") of 
the Burgess Shale fauna, and the role of chance in determining which members 
of this fauna survived and flourished. He used the Cambrian fauna as an 
example of the role of contingency in the broader pattern of evolution. 
His view was criticized by Simon Conway Morris in his 1998 book The Crucible 
of Creation.[76] Conway Morris stressed those members of the Cambrian fauna 
that resemble modern taxa. He also promoted convergent evolution as a mechanism 
producing similar forms in similar environmental circumstances, and argued 
in a subsequent book that the appearance of human-like animals is likely.[77] 
Paleontologist Richard Fortey noted that prior to the release of Wonderful 
Life, Conway Morris shared many of Gould's sentiments and views. It was 
only after publication of Wonderful Life that Conway Morris revised his 
interpretation and adopted a more progressive stance towards the history 
of life.[78] Paleontologists Derek Briggs and Richard Fortey have also 
argued that much of the Cambrian fauna may be regarded as stem groups of 
living taxa,[79] though this is still a subject of intense research and 
debate, and the relationship of many Cambrian taxa to modern phyla has 
not been established in the eyes of many palaeontologists. Richard Dawkins 
also disagreed with Gould's view that new phyla suddenly appeared in the 
Cambrian fauna, arguing: The extreme Gouldian view—certainly the view inspired 
by his rhetoric, though it is hard to tell from his own words whether he 
literally holds it himself—is radically different from and utterly incompatible 
with the standard neo-Darwinian model. ... For a new body plan—a new phylum—to 
spring into existence, what actually has to happen on the ground is that 
a child is born which suddenly, out of the blue, is as different from its 
parents as a snail is from an earthworm. No zoologist who thinks through 
the implications, not even the most ardent saltationist, has ever supported 
any such notion.[80] Gould also had a long-running public feud with E. 
O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists concerning the disciplines 
of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, both of which Gould 
and Lewontin opposed, but which Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and Steven 
Pinker advocated.[81] These debates reached their climax in the 1970s, 
and included strong opposition from groups like the Sociobiology Study 
Group and Science for the People.[82] Pinker accuses Gould, Lewontin, and 
other opponents of evolutionary psychology of being "radical scientists", 
whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science.[83] 
Gould stated that he made "no attribution of motive in Wilson's or anyone 
else's case" but cautioned that all human beings are influenced, especially 
unconsciously, by our personal expectations and biases. He wrote: I grew 
up in a family with a tradition of participation in campaigns for social 
justice, and I was active, as a student, in the civil rights movement at 
a time of great excitement and success in the early 1960s. Scholars are 
often wary of citing such commitments. … [but] it is dangerous for a scholar 
even to imagine that he might attain complete neutrality, for then one 
stops being vigilant about personal preferences and their influences—and 
then one truly falls victim to the dictates of prejudice. Objectivity must 
be operationally defined as fair treatment of data, not absence of preference.[84] 
Gould's primary criticism held that human sociobiological explanations 
lacked evidential support, and argued that adaptive behaviors are frequently 
assumed to be genetic for no other reason than their supposed universality, 
or their adaptive nature. Gould emphasized that adaptive behaviors can 
be passed on through culture as well, and either hypothesis is equally 
plausible.[85] Gould did not deny the relevance of biology to human nature, 
but reframed the debate as "biological potentiality vs. biological determinism." 
Gould stated that the human brain allows for a wide range of behaviors. 
Its flexibility "permits us to be aggressive or peaceful, dominant or submissive, 
spiteful or generous… Violence, sexism, and general nastiness are biological 
since they represent one subset of a possible range of behaviors. But peacefulness, 
equality, and kindness are just as biological—and we may see their influence 
increase if we can create social structures that permit them to flourish."[85] 
Gould was the author of The Mismeasure of Man (1981), a history and inquiry 
of psychometrics and intelligence testing, generating perhaps the greatest 
controversy of all his books and receiving both widespread praise[86] and 
extensive criticism,[87] including claims of misrepresentation.[88] Gould 
investigated the methods of nineteenth century craniometry, as well as 
the history of psychological testing. Gould claimed that both theories 
developed from an unfounded belief in biological determinism, the view 
that "social and economic differences between human groups—primarily races, 
classes, and sexes—arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, 
in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology."[89] The book was 
reprinted in 1996 with the addition of a new foreword and a critical review 
of The Bell Curve. In 2011, a study conducted by six anthropologists reanalyzed 
Gould's claim that Samuel Morton unconsciously manipulated his skull measurements,[90] 
and concluded that Gould's analysis was poorly supported and incorrect. 
They praised Gould for his "staunch opposition to racism" but concluded, 
"we find that Morton's initial reputation as the objectivist of his era 
was well-deserved."[91] Ralph Holloway, one of the co-authors of the study, 
commented, "I just didn't trust Gould. ... I had the feeling that his ideological 
stance was supreme. When the 1996 version of 'The Mismeasure of Man' came 
and he never even bothered to mention Michael's study, I just felt he was 
a charlatan."[92] The group's paper was reviewed in the journal Nature, 
which recommended a degree of caution, and notes that "because they couldn't 
measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities 
that Morton reported represent his sample accurately."[93] The journal 
stated that Gould's opposition to racism might have biased his interpretation 
of Morton's data, but also noted that "Lewis and his colleagues have their 
own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the University 
of Pennsylvania, and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied 
skull collection freed from the stigma of bias."[93] The group's paper 
was critically reviewed in the journal Evolution & Development by philosopher 
of science Michael Weisberg, also of the University of Pennsylvania. Weisberg 
argues that "most of Gould's arguments against Morton are sound. Although 
Gould made some errors and overstated his case in a number of places, he 
provided prima facia evidence, as yet unrefuted, that Morton did indeed 
mismeasure his skulls in ways that conformed to 19th century racial biases."[94] 
Biologists and philosophers Jonathan Kaplan, Massimo Pigliucci, and Joshua 
Banta also published a critique of the groups's paper, arguing that many 
of its claims were misleading and the re-measurements were "completely 
irrelevant to an evaluation of Gould's published analysis." They also argue 
that both Morton and Gould's statistical methods on which skulls to include 
and which to exclude, and how they computed averages, "were both inappropriate."[95] 
In his book Rocks of Ages (1999), Gould put forward what he described as 
"a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to ... the supposed 
conflict between science and religion."[96] He defines the term magisterium 
as "a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for 
meaningful discourse and resolution."[96] The non-overlapping magisteria 
(NOMA) principle therefore divides the magisterium of science to cover 
"the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does 
it work in this way (theory). The magisterium of religion extends over 
questions of ultimate meaning and moral value. These two magisteria do 
not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry."[96] He suggests that "NOMA 
enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural 
stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism" and that NOMA is "a sound position 
of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill 
in both magisteria."[96] However, this view has not been without criticism. 
For example, in his book The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins argues that 
the division between religion and science is not as simple as Gould claims, 
as few religions exist without claiming the existence of miracles, which 
"by definition, violate the principles of science."[97] Dawkins also opposes 
the idea that religion has anything meaningful to say about ethics and 
values, and therefore has no authority to claim a magisterium of its own.[97] 
He goes on to say that he believes Gould is disingenuous in much of what 
he says in Rocks of Ages.[98] Similarly, humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz 
argues that Gould was wrong to posit that science has nothing to say about 
questions of ethics. In fact, Kurtz claims that science is a much better 
method than religion for determining moral principles.[99] Gould's publications 
were numerous. One review of his publications between 1965 and 2000 noted 
479 peer-reviewed papers, 22 books, 300 essays,[7] and 101 "major" book 
reviews.[1] A select number of his papers are listed online. The following 
is a list of books either written or edited by Stephen Jay Gould, including 
those published posthumously, after his death in 2002. While some books 
have been republished at later dates, by multiple publishers, the list
