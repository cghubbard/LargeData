Eddie Dean Watt (born April 4, 1941 in Lamoni, Iowa) is a former Major 
League Baseball relief pitcher. The 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m), 197 lb (89 kg) 
right-hander was signed by the Baltimore Orioles as an amateur free agent 
on September 5, 1961. He played for the Orioles (1966–1973), Philadelphia 
Phillies (1974), and Chicago Cubs (1975). Watt started just 13 out of the 
411 games he appeared in, all during his rookie season. He was 2–5 as a 
starter and 7–2 with 4 saves as a reliever for the 1966 World Series Champion 
Orioles. He did not appear in any of the four World Series games against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jim Palmer, Wally Bunker, and Dave McNally all 
pitched complete games, and the team needed only one relief appearance, 
provided in record fashion by Moe Drabowsky.[1] In 1969 the Orioles won 
the American League pennant and were upset in the World Series by the New 
York Mets. Watt contributed to Baltimore's 109–53 regular season record 
with a career-high 16 saves and a career-low 1.65 earned run average in 
71 innings. Watt was an important part of Baltimore's 1970 Championship 
season though it was not one of his best seasons statistically. He won 
7 games and saved 12 with a 3.25 ERA in 53 appearances. He was the losing 
pitcher in the Orioles' 6–5 defeat to the Cincinnati Reds in Game 4 of 
the 1970 World Series. With the Orioles leading 5–3, he entered the contest 
in relief of Jim Palmer, who had allowed a walk to Tony Pérez and a single 
to Johnny Bench to open the top of the eighth inning. Watt surrendered 
a three-run homer to Lee May, the first batter he faced.[2] The Orioles 
eventually won the Series, but the loss prevented them from sweeping the 
Reds in four straight games. He was consistently effective during seven 
seasons of pitching exclusively in relief for Baltimore. From 1967 to 1973 
he averaged 46 appearances, 67 innings, and 10 saves with an ERA of 2.40. 
On December 7, 1973 Watt was purchased by the Philadelphia Phillies for 
an estimated $70,000. In 1974 he appeared in 42 games for the Phils, going 
1–1 with 6 saves and a 3.99 ERA. He was released by Philadelphia just before 
Opening Day in 1975, and he hooked on briefly with the Chicago Cubs, making 
his last major league appearance on June 14, 1975. He spent most of the 
season with the Wichita Aeros of the American Association. Career totals 
include a record of 38–36 in 411 games pitched, 13 games started, 1 complete 
game, 240 games finished, 80 saves, and an ERA of 2.91. In 659.2 innings 
he gave up just 37 home runs, an average of about one per 18 innings, and 
had a very low WHIP of 1.188. He had a batting average of .190 in 100 at 
bats with 3 home runs, hit against Johnny Podres, Frank Kreutzer, and Sam
