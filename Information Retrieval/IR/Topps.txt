The Topps Company, Inc., manufactures chewing gum, candy and collectibles. 
Based in New York, New York,[1] Topps is best known as a leading producer 
of basketball cards, football cards, baseball cards, hockey cards and other 
sports and non-sports themed trading cards. Topps itself was founded in 
1938,[2] but the company can trace its roots back to an earlier firm, American 
Leaf Tobacco. Founded in 1890 by Morris Shorin, the American Leaf Tobacco 
Co. imported tobacco to the United States and sold it to other tobacco 
companies. (American Leaf Tobacco should not be confused with the American 
Tobacco Company, which monopolized U.S.-grown tobacco during this period.)[citation 
needed] American Leaf Tobacco encountered difficulties during World War 
I, as it was cut off from Turkish supplies of tobacco, and later as a result 
of the Great Depression. Shorin's sons, Abram, Ira, Philip, and Joseph, 
decided to focus on a new product but take advantage of the company's existing 
distribution channels. To do this, they relaunched the company as Topps, 
with the name meant to indicate that it would be "tops" in its field. The 
chosen field was the manufacture of chewing gum, selected after going into 
the produce business was considered and rejected. At the time, chewing 
gum was still a relative novelty sold in individual pieces. Topps’ most 
successful early product was Bazooka bubblegum, which was packaged with 
a small comic on the wrapper. Starting in 1950, the company decided to 
try increasing gum sales by packaging them together with trading cards 
featuring Western character Hopalong Cassidy (William Boyd); at the time 
Boyd, as one of the biggest stars of early television, was featured in 
newspaper articles and on magazine covers, along with a significant amount 
of "Hoppy" merchandising. When Topps next introduced baseball cards as 
a product, the cards immediately became its primary emphasis. The "father 
of the modern baseball card" was Sy Berger.[3] In the autumn of 1951, Berger, 
then a 28-year-old veteran of World War II, designed the 1952 Topps baseball 
card set with Woody Gelman on the kitchen table of his apartment on Alabama 
Avenue in Brooklyn.[4] The card design included a player's name, photo, 
facsimile autograph, team name and logo on the front; and the player's 
height, weight, bats, throws, birthplace, birthday, stats and a short biography 
on the back. The basic design is still in use today. Berger would work 
for Topps for 50 years (1947–97) and serve as a consultant for another 
five, becoming a well-known figure on the baseball scene, and the face 
of Topps to major league baseball players, whom he signed up annually and 
paid in merchandise, like refrigerators and carpeting. The Shorins, in 
recognition of his negotiation abilities, sent Sy to London in 1964 to 
negotiate the rights for Topps to produce Beatles trading cards. Arriving 
without an appointment, Sy succeeded by speaking in Yiddish to Brian Epstein, 
the Beatles’ manager. Berger hired a garbage boat to remove leftover boxes 
of 1952 baseball cards stored in their warehouse, and rode with them as 
a tugboat pulled them off the New Jersey shore. The cards were then dumped 
into the Atlantic Ocean.[5] The cards included Mickey Mantle's first Topps 
card, the most valuable card of the modern era. No one at the time, of 
course, knew the collector's value the cards would one day attain. Currently, 
a pack of 1952 Topps baseball cards is worth at least $5,000. Since 2012, 
Topps began creating digital sports cards, starting with the Topps Bunt 
baseball card downloadable app.[6] Today, they have expanded that market 
into other apps that include Topps Huddle football app, Topps Kick soccer 
app, and the extremely popular Star Wars Card Trader app that was released 
this year. The company began its existence as Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., 
a partnership between the four Shorin brothers. It later incorporated under 
New York law in 1947. The entire company originally operated at the Bush 
Terminal in Brooklyn, but production facilities were moved to a plant in 
Duryea, Pennsylvania, in 1965. Corporate offices remained at 254 36th Street 
in Brooklyn, a location in the waterfront district by the Gowanus Expressway. 
In 1994, the headquarters relocated to One Whitehall Street in lower Manhattan. 
After being privately held for several decades, Topps offered stock to 
the public for the first time in 1972 with the assistance of investment 
banking firm White, Weld & Co. The company returned to private ownership 
when it was acquired in a leveraged buyout led by Forstmann Little & Company 
in 1984. The new ownership group again made Topps into a publicly traded 
company in 1987, now renamed to The Topps Company, Inc. In this incarnation, 
the company was incorporated in Delaware for legal reasons, but company 
headquarters remained in New York. Management was left in the hands of 
the Shorin family throughout all of these maneuverings. Criticism of the 
company's financial performance and flat stock price led two hedge funds 
holding 7.4% of the stock to launch a proxy fight in July 2006. Calling 
for better management of the company as the Topps Full Value Committee, 
they tried to place three members on the company's board of directors at 
the annual shareholder meeting. In a compromise with Topps, the three dissident 
shareholders were elected to the Topps board to replace two directors running 
for re-election, while CEO Arthur Shorin (son of Joseph) stayed on as a 
tenth member of the board. The battle extended into 2007 with a $385 million 
buyout offer led by the firms Madison Dearborn and Tornante (an investment 
company started by former longtime Disney CEO Michael Eisner). The price 
of $9.75 per share was endorsed by Topps executives, but the dissident 
board members felt it undervalued the company and pushed to shop for other 
bidders. This led to discussions of a potential merger with the rival Upper 
Deck Company, which was prepared to buy Topps for $10.75 per share (a total 
of about $425 million). Topps management decided to reject this offer, 
citing concerns about the financing and potential antitrust regulation; 
Upper Deck pursued it for several more months but as a hostile takeover 
bid. Upper Deck eventually withdrew its offer, complaining that Topps had 
impeded any reasonable efforts toward a merger. Meanwhile, a vote on the 
lower bid was delayed in the aftermath of Upper Deck's withdrawal, allowing 
management more time to lobby for shareholder support. The buyout was eventually 
approved in a special shareholders meeting by nearly two-thirds of the 
shares voting. The result was close, however, as the bloc voting for the 
deal was only a narrow majority of total shares outstanding, including 
those not voted (a requirement to complete the deal). On October 12, 2007, 
Topps was acquired by Michael Eisner's Tornante Company and Madison Dearborn 
Partners.[7] Under Eisner's direction, Topps began to expand into the entertainment 
and media business with plans for a Bazooka Joe movie. Former television 
executive Staci Weiss began working with Tornante to develop projects based 
on Topps properties, including Garbage Pail Kids, Wacky Packages, Dinosaurs 
Attack!, Mech Warrior and Attax.[8] Topps has a European division, which 
is based in Milton Keynes, UK. From this office products are launched across 
Europe, including Spain, France, Germany, Norway, and Italy. This division 
also co-ordinates products launches across the numerous other international 
markets including the Far East, Australia, and South Africa. In 1994 Merlin 
acquired the Premier League license allowing the company to exclusively 
publish the only official Premier League sticker and album collection in 
the UK. The initial success of the Premier League stickers and album collection 
was so great that it took even Merlin by surprise, with reprint after reprint 
being produced. In 1995, The Topps Company Inc. completed its takeover 
of Merlin Publishing. Merlin’s official company name changed to Topps Europe 
Limited, its products still carried the Merlin brand until 2008 as it was 
easily recognized by consumers. Topps Europe Limited continues to produce 
a wide and varied range of sports and entertainment collectables across 
Europe. Its range of products now includes stickers, albums, cards and 
binders, magazines, stationery, and temporary tattoos. Topps Europe Ltd 
has continued to launch hugely successful products across Europe. Some 
of the most successful licenses have included WWE, Pokémon, Doctor Who, 
High School Musical and SpongeBob. Premier League stickers and albums are 
now in their 18th year Match Attax, the official Premier League trading 
card game, is the biggest selling boys collectable in the UK two years 
running. Being sold across the globe in a number of countries, the collection 
also holds the title of the biggest selling sports collectable in the world. 
It is estimated that around 1.5 million children collect it in the UK, 
and 2.5 million children in the world. In the spring of 2008, Topps acquired 
the exclusive rights to the DFL Deutsche Fussball Liga GmbH for trading 
cards and stickers until the Bundesliga Season 2010/11. Bundesliga Match 
Attax was launched in January 2009 and is now available in over 40,000 
stockists. The collection is the first of its kind in Germany and has become 
one of the biggest selling collections in the country. As of February 2016 
Topps Match Attax dominated the secondary UK card trading market occupying 
two out of the top three spots on the www.stickerpoints.com 'most popular 
soccer collection' list. [9] In 1951, Topps produced its first baseball 
cards in two different sets known today as Red Backs and Blue Backs. Each 
set contained 52 cards, like a deck of playing cards, and in fact the cards 
could be used to play a game that would simulate the events of a baseball 
game. Also like playing cards, the cards had rounded corners and were blank 
on one side, which was colored either red or blue (hence the names given 
to these sets). The other side featured the portrait of a player within 
a baseball diamond in the center, and in opposite corners a picture of 
a baseball together with the event for that card, such as "fly out" or 
"single." Topps changed its approach in 1952, this time creating a much 
larger (407 total) set of baseball cards and packaging them with its signature 
product, bubblegum. The company also decided that its playing card model 
was too small (2 inches by 2-5/8 inches) and changed the dimensions to 
2-5/8 inches by 3-3/4 inches with square corners. The cards now had a color 
portrait on one side, with statistical and biographical information on 
the other. This set became a landmark in the baseball card industry, and 
today the company considers this its first true baseball card set. Many 
of the oil paintings for the sets were rendered by artist Gerry Dvorak, 
who also worked as an animator for Famous Studios. In 1957, Topps shrank 
the dimensions of its cards slightly, to 2-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches, 
setting a standard that remains the basic format for most sports cards 
produced in the United States.[5] It was at this time Topps began to use 
color photographs in their set. The cards were released in several series 
over the course of the baseball season, a practice Topps would continue 
with its baseball cards until 1974. However, the last series of each year 
did not sell as well, as the baseball season wore on and popular attention 
began to turn towards football. Thus cards from the last series are much 
scarcer and are typically more valuable (even commons) than earlier series 
of the same year. Topps was left with a substantial amount of surplus stock 
in 1952, which it largely disposed of by dumping many cards into the Atlantic. 
In later years, Topps either printed series in smaller quantities late 
in the season or destroyed excess cards. As a result, cards with higher 
numbers from this period are rarer than low numbers in the same set, and 
collectors will pay significantly higher prices for them. The last series 
in 1952 started with card No. 311, which is Topps' first card of Mickey 
Mantle, and remains the most valuable Topps card ever (and the most valuable 
post-1948 card). The 1952 Topps Mantle is often mistakenly referred to 
as Mickey's rookie card, but that honor belongs to his 1951 Bowman card 
(which is worth about a third of the 1952 Topps card). The combination 
of baseball cards and bubblegum was popular among young boys, and given 
the mediocre quality of the gum, the cards quickly became the primary attraction. 
In fact, the gum eventually became a hindrance because it tended to stain 
the cards, thus impairing their value to collectors who wanted to keep 
them in pristine condition. It (along with the traditional gray cardboard) 
was finally dropped from baseball card packs in 1992, although Topps began 
its Heritage line, which included gum, in the year 2001. During this period, 
baseball card manufacturers generally obtained the rights to depict players 
on merchandise by signing individual players to contracts for the purpose. 
Topps first became active in this process through an agent called Players 
Enterprises in July 1950, in preparation for its first 1951 set. The later 
acquisition of rights to additional players allowed Topps to release its 
second series. This promptly brought Topps into furious competition with 
Bowman Gum, another company producing baseball cards. Bowman had become 
the primary maker of baseball cards and driven out several competitors 
by signing its players to exclusive contracts. The language of these contracts 
focused particularly on the rights to sell cards with chewing gum, which 
had already been established in the 1930s as a popular product to pair 
with baseball cards. To avoid the language of Bowman's existing contracts, 
Topps sold its 1951 cards with caramel candy instead of gum. However, because 
Bowman had signed many players in 1950 to contracts for that year, plus 
a renewal option for one year, Topps included in its own contracts the 
rights to sell cards with gum starting in 1952 (as it ultimately did). 
Topps also tried to establish exclusive rights through its contracts by 
having players agree not to grant similar rights to others, or renew existing 
contracts except where specifically noted in the contract. Bowman responded 
by adding chewing gum "or confections" to the exclusivity language of its 
1951 contracts, and also sued Topps in U.S. federal court. The lawsuit 
alleged infringement on Bowman's trademarks, unfair competition, and contractual 
interference. The court rejected Bowman's attempt to claim a trademark 
on the word "baseball" in connection with the sale of gum, and disposed 
of the unfair competition claim because Topps had made no attempt to pass 
its cards off as being made by Bowman. The contract issue proved more difficult 
because it turned on the dates when a given player signed contracts with 
each company, and whether the player's contract with one company had an 
exception for his contract with the other. As the contract situation was 
sorted out, several Topps sets during these years had a few "missing" cards, 
where the numbering of the set skips several numbers because they had been 
assigned to players whose cards could not legally be distributed. The competition, 
both for consumer attention and player contracts, continued until 1956, 
when Topps bought out Bowman. This left Topps as the dominant producer 
of baseball cards for a number of years. The next company to challenge 
Topps was Fleer, another gum manufacturer. Fleer signed star Ted Williams 
to an exclusive contract in 1959 and sold a set of cards oriented around 
him. Williams retired the next year, so Fleer began adding around him other 
mostly retired players in a Baseball Greats series, which was sold with 
gum. Two of these sets were produced before Fleer finally tried a 67-card 
set of currently active players in 1963. However, Topps held onto the rights 
of most players and the set was not particularly successful. Stymied, Fleer 
turned its efforts to supporting an administrative complaint filed by the 
Federal Trade Commission, alleging that Topps was engaging in unfair competition 
through its aggregation of exclusive contracts. A hearing examiner ruled 
against Topps in 1965, but the Commission reversed this decision on appeal. 
The Commission concluded that because the contracts only covered the sale 
of cards with gum, competition was still possible by selling cards with 
other small, low-cost products. However, Fleer chose not to pursue such 
options and instead sold its remaining player contracts to Topps for $395,000 
in 1966. The decision gave Topps an effective monopoly of the baseball 
card market. That same year, however, Topps faced an attempt to undermine 
its position from the nascent players' union, the Major League Baseball 
Players Association. Struggling to raise funds, the MLBPA discovered that 
it could generate significant income by pooling the publicity rights of 
its members and offering companies a group license to use their images 
on various products. After initially putting players on Coca-Cola bottlecaps, 
the union concluded that the Topps contracts did not pay players adequately 
for their rights. MLBPA executive director Marvin Miller then approached 
Joel Shorin, the president of Topps, about renegotiating these contracts. 
At this time, Topps had every major league player under contract, generally 
for five years plus renewal options, so Shorin declined. After continued 
discussions went nowhere, the union before the 1968 season asked its members 
to stop signing renewals on these contracts, and offered Fleer the exclusive 
rights to market cards of most players (with gum) starting in 1973. Although 
Fleer declined the proposal, by the end of the year Topps had agreed to 
double its payments to each player from $125 to $250, and also to begin 
paying players a percentage of Topps's overall sales. The figure for individual 
player contracts has since increased to $500. As a byproduct of this history, 
Topps continues to use individual player contracts as the basis for its 
baseball card sets today. This contrasts with other manufacturers, who 
all obtain group licenses from the MLBPA. The difference has occasionally 
affected whether specific players are included in particular sets. Players 
who decline to sign individual contracts will not have Topps cards even 
when the group licensing system allows other manufacturers to produce cards 
of the player, as happened with Alex Rodriguez early in his career. On 
the other hand, if a player opts out of group licensing, as Barry Bonds 
did in 2004, then manufacturers who depend on the MLBPA system will have 
no way of including him. Topps, however, can negotiate individually and 
was belatedly able to create a 2004 card of Bonds. In addition, Topps is 
the only manufacturer able to produce cards of players who worked as replacement 
players during the 1994 baseball strike, since they are barred from union 
membership and participation in the group licensing program. A semblance 
of competition returned to the baseball card market in the 1970s when Kellogg's 
began producing "3-D" cards and inserting them in boxes of breakfast cereal 
(originally Corn Flakes, later Raisin Bran and other Kellogg's brands). 
The Kellogg's sets contained fewer cards than Topps sets, and the cards 
served as an incentive to buy the cereal, rather than being the intended 
focus of the purchase, as tended to be the case for cards distributed with 
smaller items like candy or gum. Topps appears not to have considered the 
Kellogg's cards a threat and took no action to stop them. The Topps monopoly 
on baseball cards was finally broken by a lawsuit that let Fleer and another 
company, Donruss, enter the market in 1981. Fleer and Donruss began making 
large, widely distributed sets to compete directly with Topps, packaged 
with gum. When the ruling was overturned on appeal in August 1981, Topps 
appeared to have regained its monopoly, but both of its competitors instead 
began packaging their cards with other baseball items — logo stickers from 
Fleer, and cardboard puzzle pieces from Donruss. The puzzles, created by 
baseball artists Dick Perez for Perez Steele, included Warren Spahn, Hank 
Aaron, Mickey Mantle and a dozen others.[10] Other manufacturers later 
followed, but Topps remains one of the leading brands in the baseball card 
hobby. In response to the competition, Topps began regularly issuing additional 
"Traded" sets featuring players who had changed teams since the main set 
was issued, following up on an idea it had experimented with a few years 
earlier. While "Traded" or "Update" sets were originally conceived to deal 
with players who changed teams, they became increasingly important for 
another reason. In order to fill out a 132-card set (the number of cards 
that fit on a single sheet of the uncut cardboard used in the production 
process), it would contain a number of rookie players who had just reached 
the major leagues and not previously appeared on a card. They also included 
a few single cards of players who previously appeared in the regular set 
on a multi-player "prospects" card; one notable example is the 1982 Topps 
Traded Cal Ripken, Jr.. Since a "rookie card" is typically the most valuable 
for any given player, the companies now competed to be the first to produce 
a card of players who might be future stars. Increasingly, they also included 
highly touted minor league players who had yet to play in the major leagues. 
For example, Topps obtained a license to produce cards featuring the U.S. 
Olympic baseball team and thus produced the first card of Mark McGwire 
prior to his promotion to the major league level, and one that would become 
quite valuable to collectors for a time. This card from the 1984 squad 
appeared in Topps's regular 1985 set, but by the next Olympic cycle the 
team's cards had been migrated to the "Traded" set. As a further step in 
this race, Topps resurrected its former competitor Bowman as a subsidiary 
brand in 1989, with Bowman sets similarly chosen to include a lot of young 
players with bright prospects. Also beginning in 1989 with the entry of 
Upper Deck into the market, card companies began to develop higher-end 
cards using improved technology. Following Topps' example, other manufacturers 
now began to diversify their product lines into different sets, each catering 
to a different niche of the market. The initial Topps effort at producing 
a premium line of cards, in 1991, was called Stadium Club. Topps continued 
adding more sets and trying to distinguish them from each other, as did 
its competitors. The resulting glut of different baseball sets caused the 
MLBPA to take drastic measures as the market for them deteriorated. The 
union announced that for 2006, licenses would only be granted to Topps 
and Upper Deck, the number of different products would be limited, and 
players would not appear on cards before reaching the major leagues. Although 
most of its products were distributed through retail stores and hobby shops, 
Topps also attempted to establish itself online, where a significant secondary 
market for sports cards was developing. Working in partnership with eBay, 
Topps launched a new brand of sports cards called etopps in December 2000. 
These cards are sold exclusively online through individual "IPOs" (or, 
"Initial Player Offering") in which the card is offered for usually a week 
at the IPO price. The quantity sold depends on how many people offer to 
buy, but is limited to a certain maximum. After a sale, the cards are held 
in a climate-controlled warehouse unless the buyer requests delivery, and 
the cards can be traded online without changing hands except in the virtual 
sense. Topps also acquired ThePit.com, a startup company that earlier in 
2000 had launched a site for online stock-market style card trading. The 
purchase was for $5.7 million cash in August 2001 after Topps had earlier 
committed to invest in a round of venture capital financing for the company. 
This undertaking was not very successful, however, and Topps unloaded the 
site on Naxcom in January 2006. The amount of the transaction was not disclosed, 
but Topps charged a $3.7 million after-tax loss on its books in connection 
with the sale. Topps grabbed collectors' attention early in 2007 when the 
new card of Yankees' shortstop Derek Jeter was found to have been altered 
to include an image of Mickey Mantle standing in the dugout and President 
George W. Bush walking through the stands. In 2009, Topps become the first 
official baseball card of MLB in over thirty years. The first product to 
fall under the deal was the 2010 Topps Baseball Series 1. The deal gives 
Topps exclusivity for the use of MLB and club trademarks and logos on cards, 
stickers and some other products featuring major league players. Although 
Topps did not invent the concept of baseball cards, its dominance in the 
field basically allowed the company to define people's expectations of 
what a baseball card would look like. In addition to establishing a standard 
size, Topps developed various design elements that are considered typical 
of baseball cards. Some of these were the company's own innovations, while 
some were ideas borrowed from others that Topps helped popularize. One 
of the features that contributed significantly to Topps' success beginning 
with the 1952 set was providing player statistics. At the time, complete 
and reliable baseball statistics for all players were not widely available, 
so Topps actually compiled the information itself from published box scores. 
While baseball cards themselves had been around for years, including statistics 
was a relative novelty that fascinated many collectors. Those who played 
with baseball cards could study the numbers and use them as the basis for 
comparing players, trading cards with friends, or playing imaginary baseball 
games. It also had some pedagogical benefit by encouraging youngsters to 
take an interest in the underlying mathematics. The cards originally had 
one line for statistics from the most recent year (i.e. the 1951 season 
for cards in the 1952 set) and another with the player's lifetime totals. 
Bowman promptly imitated this by putting statistics on its own cards where 
it had previously only had biographical information. For the first time 
in 1957, Topps put full year-by-year statistics for the player's entire 
career on the back of the card. Over the next few years, Topps alternated 
between this format and merely showing the past season plus career totals. 
The practice of showing complete career statistics became permanent in 
1963, except for one year, 1971, when Topps sacrificed the full statistics 
in order to put a player photo on the back of the card as well. Although 
the 1971 set was an aborted experiment in terms of putting photos on card 
backs (they would not return until 1992), that year was also a landmark 
in terms of baseball card photography, as Topps for the first time included 
cards showing color photographs from actual games. The cards themselves 
had been in color from the beginning, though for the first few years this 
was done by using artist's portraits of players rather than actual photographs 
and until 1971, Topps used mostly portrait or posed shots. The 1971 set 
is also known for its jet black borders, which because they chip so easily, 
makes it much more difficult to find top grade cards for 1971. The black 
borders would return for Topps' 1985 football set and 2007 baseball set. 
After starting out with simple portraits, in 1954 Topps put two pictures 
on the front of the card – a hand-tinted 'color' close-up photo of the 
player's head, and the other a black-and-white full-length pose. The same 
basic format was used in 1955, this time with the full-length photo also 
hand-tinted. For 1956, the close-up tinted photo was placed against a tinted 
full-background 'game-action' photo of the player. The close-up head shots 
of some individual players were reused each year. From 1957 on, virtually 
all cards were posed photographs, either as a head shot or together with 
a typical piece of equipment like a bat or glove. If using such a prop, 
the player might pose in a position as if he were in the act of batting, 
pitching, or fielding. Photographs did not appear in sharp focus and natural 
color until 1962. However, that year also saw problems with the print quality 
in the second series, which lacked the right proportion of ink and thus 
gave the photographs a distinctly greenish tint. The affected series of 
cards was then reprinted, and several players were actually shown in different 
poses in the reprinting. Although Topps had produced error cards and variations 
before, this was its largest single production glitch. In the absence of 
full-color action photography, Topps still occasionally used artwork to 
depict action on a handful of cards. Starting in 1960 a few cards showed 
true game action, but the photographs were either in black-and-white or 
hand-tinted color. These cards were primarily highlights from the World 
Series; in addition to basic cards of individual players, Topps sets commonly 
include cards for special themes — the 1974 tribute to Hank Aaron as he 
was about to break Babe Ruth's career home run record is one example. The 
1972 set finally included color photographs, which were used for special 
"In Action" cards of selected star players. Thereafter, Topps began simply 
mixing game photography with posed shots in its sets. Baseball artist Dick 
Perez was commissioned to paint art cards for Topps beginning in 2006. 
His art card series include Turkey Reds, Allen & Ginter One on One cards 
and a series of Special Cards." [11] When used for the cards of individual 
players, some of the early action photography had awkward results. The 
photos were sometimes out of focus or included several players, making 
it difficult to pick out the player who was supposed to be featured on 
the card. In a few cases, a misidentification meant that the player didn't 
even appear in the picture. These problems diminished as Topps' selection 
of photographs gradually improved. Before statistics, biographical information, 
and commentary became the dominant element on the backs of cards, Topps 
also featured artwork there. This primarily involved using various types 
of cartoons drawn by its stable of artists. These appeared on card backs 
as late as 1982, but gradually declined in the prominence of their placement 
and the proportion of cards on which they appeared. In 1993, Topps finally 
managed again to incorporate a player photo on the back as well as the 
front of the card, after some competitors had been doing so for a number 
of years. The pictures and information on baseball cards sold during one 
season came primarily from earlier seasons, so Topps used various tactics 
to give its cards a greater sense of staying current with the times. Before 
coming up with the idea of a "Traded" set, the company still tried to produce 
cards of players with their new team if they changed teams in the offseason. 
This was sometimes accomplished by showing the player without any team 
cap, or by airbrushing out elements of the former team's logo on his uniform. 
Cards for rookies could also be prepared by airbrushing over their minor-league 
uniforms in photos. In one case, Topps even got too far in front of events, 
as in 1974 it showed a number of players as being with the "Washington 
Nat'l Lea." franchise, due to expectations that the San Diego Padres would 
relocate to the vacant Washington, D.C. market. The team designation was 
the only change, as no new nickname for the franchise had been selected. 
When the move failed to materialize, Topps had to replace these with cards 
showing the players still as Padres. On rare occasions, Topps has issued 
special cards for players who had either died or had been injured. The 
1959 set had card 550 as "Symbol Of Courage – Roy Campanella", with a color 
photo of the paralyzed former Dodger in his wheelchair and a black-and-white 
photo of him in uniform inserted to the upper left. The 1964 set issued 
cards for two recently deceased players: Ken Hubbs of the Cubs with a different 
"In Memoriam" front design compared to standard cards, and Colts pitcher 
Jim Umbricht's regular card with a special note on the back about his April 
1964 death from cancer. In October 2006, Topps was prepping for its annual 
updated/traded card release, which featured Cory Lidle in a Yankees uniform. 
After Lidle's tragic death, the cards were pulled and subsequently released 
with "In Memoriam" on its front. In addition to baseball, Topps also produced 
cards for American football in 1951, which are known as the Magic set. 
For football cards Bowman dominated the field, and Topps did not try again 
until 1955, when it released an All-American set with a mix of active players 
and retired stars. After buying out Bowman, Topps took over the market 
the following year. Since then, Topps has sold football cards every season. 
However, the emergence of the American Football League in 1960 to compete 
with the established National Football League also allowed Topps' competitors, 
beginning with Fleer, to make inroads. Fleer produced a set for the AFL 
in 1960, then featured both leagues for one year before focusing on the 
AFL again. Philadelphia Gum then secured the NFL rights for 1964, forcing 
Topps to go for the AFL and leaving Fleer with no product in either baseball 
or football. Although more competitive for a time, the football card market 
was never as lucrative, so the other companies did not fight as hard over 
it. After the AFL-NFL Merger was agreed to, Topps became the only major 
football card manufacturer beginning in 1968. In spite of the lack of competition, 
or perhaps to preempt it, Topps also created two sets of cards for the 
short-lived United States Football League in the 1980s. Many NFL legends 
had their first ever cards produced in the USFL sets. These players include 
Steve Young, Jim Kelly, and Reggie White. This resulted in a controversy 
when these players debuted in the NFL. Many wondered if the USFL cards 
should be considered rookie cards because the league did not exist anymore. 
The situation continued until growth in the sports card market generally 
prompted two new companies, Pro Set and Score, to start making football 
cards in 1989. Throughout the 1970s until 1982, Topps did not have the 
rights to reproduce the actual team logos on the helmets and uniforms of 
the players; curiously, these could be found on the Fleer sets of the same 
era, but Fleer could not name specific player names (likely an issue of 
Topps holding the National Football League Players Association license 
and Fleer holding the license from the league). As a result, helmet logos 
for these teams were airbrushed out on a routine basis. Topps also makes 
cards for other major North American professional sports. After football, 
its next venture was into ice hockey, with a 1954 set featuring players 
from the four National Hockey League franchises located in the U.S. at 
the time: the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings and 
New York Rangers. In 1958, the O-Pee-Chee Company of London, Ontario, Canada, 
entered into an agreement with Topps to produce NHL cards (the 1957–58 
series) and Canadian football cards (the 1958 series). O-Pee-Chee then 
started printing its own hockey and football cards in 1961. Similarly, 
the Topps Company struck agreements with Amalgamated and British Confectionery 
in the United Kingdom and Scanlen's in Australia. In 1967, with the major 
expansion of six new NHL teams to the United States, the Topps Company 
produced a new hockey card set that paralleled the 1966–67 O-Pee-Chee hockey 
design (the basic television design was in fact first used for 1966 Topps 
American football series). Starting in 1968–69, the Topps Company started 
printing an annual Topps hockey set that was similar to the annual O-Pee-Chee 
hockey set. The Topps and O-Pee-Chee hockey sets shared a similar design 
from 1968–69 to 1981–82 and from 1984–85 to 1991–92. Topps first sold cards 
for basketball in 1957,[5] but stopped after one season. The company started 
producing basketball cards again in 1969 and continued until 1982, but 
then abandoned the market for another decade, missing out on printing the 
prized rookie cards of Michael Jordan and other mid- and late-1980s National 
Basketball Association stars. Topps finally returned to basketball cards 
in 1992, several years after its competitors. This would be perfect timing, 
because 1992 was the rookie year of Shaquille O'Neal. In the United Kingdom, 
where football stickers have been popular over roughly the same period 
of time as trading cards, Topps acquired the old Amalgamated and British 
Confectionery firm in 1974, bringing its production methods and card style 
to Britain. Under its Merlin brand, it has the licence to produce stickers 
for the Premier League and the national team. Its main competition is the 
Italian firm Panini. Topps make 'Topps Premier League' stickers and Match 
Attax Trading card game. In 2008, Topps gained the rights to production 
of WWE trading cards. They were aptly titled Slam Attax, a play on words 
of the previously popular football trading card game Match Attax (also 
made by Topps). The first set was released in late 2008 in the U.K., and 
it was then later released in the United States in mid-2009, this later 
proved to be a pattern for subsequent Slam Attax sets and variations, with 
the U.K. getting an earlier release than the U.S. In 2008, [12] Topps and 
Zuffa, LLC signed an exclusive agreement to produce Mixed Martial Arts 
trading cards. Among the included cards were current and former athletes 
from the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Originally, Topps was purely a 
gum company, and its first product was simply called "Topps gum". Other 
gum and candy products followed. In imitation of Bowman and other competitors, 
Topps eventually began producing humor products unrelated to sports. This 
included stickers, posters (Wanted Posters, Travel Posters), media tie-ins 
(Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In), book covers (Batty Bookcovers) and toys (Flying 
Things), plus offbeat packaging (Garbage Candy). More recently, the company 
published comic books and games. The longest-lived Topps product line remains 
Bazooka bubblegum, small pieces of gum in patriotic red, white, and blue 
packaging. Bazooka was introduced in 1947 as a bar of gum that sold for 
five cents. Unlike the gum sold with baseball cards, it was of better quality 
and capable of selling on its own merit. In 1953, Topps began selling smaller 
penny pieces with the Bazooka Joe comic strip on the wrapper as an added 
attraction. Even though baseball cards became the company's primary focus 
during this period, Topps still developed a variety of candy items. For 
quite a few years, the company stuck within familiar confines, and virtually 
all of these products involved gum in some way. Sales declined significantly 
in the 1970s, however, when this relatively hard gum was challenged by 
Bubble Yum, a new, softer form of bubblegum from Life Savers. In recent 
years, Topps has added more candy items without gum. One particular focus 
has been lollipops, such as Ring Pops. However, Topps has complained that 
increasing public attention to childhood nutrition undercuts its candy 
sales. Under pressure by shareholders, the company considered selling off 
its confectionery business in 2005, but was unable to find a buyer to meet 
its price and decided to cut management expenses instead. Other brands 
include Push Pop, Baby Bottle Pop, and Juicy Drop Pop. As its sports products 
relied more on photography, Topps redirected its artistic efforts toward 
non-sports trading cards, on themes inspired by popular culture. For example, 
the Space Race prompted a set of "Space Cards" in 1958. Topps has continued 
to create collectible cards and stickers on a variety of subjects, often 
targeting the same adolescent male audience as its baseball cards. In particular, 
these have covered movies, television series, and other cultural phenomena 
ranging from The Beatles to the life story of John F. Kennedy. The many 
Star Wars card series have done well, with a few exceptions. Future screenwriter 
Gary Gerani ("Pumpkinhead') joined the company in 1972 and became the editor/writer 
of almost all movie and television tie-in products, most notably the numerous 
"Star Wars" sets, while also creating and helming original card properties 
such as 1988's "Dinosaurs Attack!". Many Topps artists came from the world 
of comics and continued to work in that field as well. The shift from sports 
to other topics better suited the creative instincts of the artists and 
coincided with turmoil in the comic book industry over regulation by the 
Comics Code Authority. Beginning at Topps when he was a teenager, Art Spiegelman 
was the company's main staff cartoonist for more than 20 years. Other staffers 
in Topps' Product Development Department at various times included Larry 
Riley, Mark Newgarden, Bhob Stewart and Rick Varesi. Topps' creative directors 
of Product Development, Woody Gelman and Len Brown, gave freelance assignments 
to leading comic book illustrators, such as Jack Davis, Wally Wood and 
Bob Powell. Spiegelman, Gelman and Brown also hired freelance artists from 
the underground comix movement, including Bill Griffith and Kim Deitch 
and Robert Crumb. Jay Lynch did extensive cartooning for Topps over several 
decades. Drawing on their previous work, these artists were adept at things 
like mixing humor and horror, as with the Funny Monsters cards in 1959. 
The 1962 Mars Attacks cards, sketched by Wood and Powell and painted by 
Norman Saunders, later inspired a Tim Burton movie. A tie-in with the Mars 
Attacks film led to a 1994 card series, a new 100-card "archives" set reprinting 
the 55 original cards, plus 45 new cards from several different artists, 
including Norm Saunders' daughter, Zina Saunders. Among Topps' most notable 
achievements in the area of satire and parody have been Wacky Packages, 
a takeoff on various household consumer products, and Garbage Pail Kids, 
a parody of the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. Another popular series was the 
Civil War News set, also with Norman Saunders' artwork. Earlier, particularly 
in the early and mid-60s, Topps thrived with several successful series 
of parody and satire cards for a variety of occasions, usually featuring 
artists who also worked at Mad Magazine. There were several insult-valentine 
card series, plus a series of insult epigram cards called Wacky Plaques, 
several series of well-known-product advertising parody cards, a set of 
cards featuring the 'mad car-driver cartoons' of artist Big Daddy Roth, 
and a card-sticker series of fanciful bizarre 'rejected aliens' from other 
planets, among other semi-subversive outrageous over-the-top concepts designed 
for the semi-rebellious adolescent boomer market. Although baseball cards 
have been Topps' most consistently profitable item, certain fads have occasionally 
produced spikes in popularity for non-sports items. For a period beginning 
in 1973, the Wacky Packages stickers managed to outsell Topps baseball 
cards, becoming the first product to do so since the company's early days 
as purely a gum and candy maker. Pokémon cards would accomplish the same 
feat for a few years starting in 1999. In the absence of new fads to capitalize 
on, Topps has come under pressure from stock analysts, since its sports 
card business is more stable and has less growth potential. In 2015 Topps 
started to expand its non-sports category by adding more TV shows, as well 
as sci-fi with its brand new Star Wars line (expanding into its own Topps 
virtual card app, similar to Topps BUNT, as well as Doctor Who, with regular 
autographs as well as vintage cut autographs, screen-worn relics, and more. 
Topps worked together with the Disney Channel to create trading cards of 
High School Musical,[13] High School Musical 2,[14] High School Musical 
3,[15] and Hannah Montana.[16] Drawing on its established connections with 
artists, in 1993 Topps created a division of the company to publish comic 
books. Known as Topps Comics, its early efforts included several concepts 
from retired industry legend Jack Kirby, known collectively as the "Kirbyverse". 
Topps Comics particularly specialized in licensed titles with tie-ins to 
movies or television series, though it also published a few original series. 
Its longest-running and best-selling title was The X-Files, based on the 
Fox TV show. These comic books featured former Marvel Comics editor Jim 
Salicrup as its editor-in-chief. Some of the more famous titles included 
The X-Files, Lone Ranger and Tonto by Timothy Truman, Xena, Mars Attacks, 
and Zorro, which introduced the famous comics character Lady Rawhide. With 
sales stagnating, the company decided to pull out of the comics business 
in 1998. The Topps Pokémon cards were purely for entertainment, pleasure 
and collecting, but a new niche of collectible card games was also developing 
during this period (a Pokémon trading card game was produced simultaneously 
by Wizards of the Coast). Topps made its first foray into the world of 
games in July 2003 by acquiring the game company WizKids[17] for $29.4 
million in cash, thus acquiring ownership of the rights to the well-known 
gaming universes of BattleTech and Shadowrun.[18] By inventing yet another 
niche, the constructible strategy game Pirates of the Spanish Main, this 
unit managed to reach profitability. Topps shut down Wizkids operation 
in November 2008 due to the economic downturn, terminating the brand while
