Worcester County is a county located in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. 
As of the 2010 census, the population was 798,552,[1] making it the second-most 
populous county in Massachusetts while also being the largest in area. 
The largest city and traditional county seat is the city of Worcester.[2] 
Worcester County is included in the Worcester, MA-CT Metropolitan Statistical 
Area as well as the Boston-Worcester-Providence, MA-RI-NH-CT Combined Statistical 
Area. Worcester County was formed from the eastern portion of colonial 
Hampshire County, the western portion of the original Middlesex County 
and the extreme western portion of the original Suffolk County. When the 
government of Worcester County was established on April 2, 1731, Worcester 
was chosen as its shire town (later known as a county seat). From that 
date until the dissolution of the county government, it was the only county 
seat. Because of the size of the county, there were fifteen attempts over 
140 years to split the county into two counties, but without success. Initially, 
Lancaster was proposed as the seat of the northern county; later, Petersham 
was proposed once and Fitchburg was proposed repeatedly, most recently 
in 1903. Perhaps as a concession, in August 1884 the Worcester County Registry 
of Deeds was split in two, with the Worcester Northern registry placed 
in Fitchburg. Worcester County is one of 8[3] of the 14 Massachusetts counties, 
which has had no county government or county commissioners since July 1, 
1998, when county functions were assumed by state agencies at local option 
following a change in state law.[4] The County has an elected county sheriff, 
county prosecutor, and court officials, administered under the state department 
of public safety. The state correctional system in the County is known 
as the Worcester County Jail or "House of Corrections" at West Boylston, 
and the Worcester County District courts (state administered) are housed 
at Worcester, Fitchburg and other district courts within county boundaries.[4] 
The Worcester County district attorney is a county-wide position even though 
the district includes one town from a neighboring county. In Massachusetts, 
Sheriffs have more limited roles than most states and are responsible for 
corrections, court service and bailiffs and jail release programs.[4] County 
Sheriffs in Massachusetts are elected to six-year terms.[4] The Worcester 
County Sheriff is Lewis Evangelidis, (R), and the Worcester County District 
Attorney is Joseph Early (D).(see the info-box at lower right for elected 
officials at county level). The Worcester County 4 H fair is in its 63rd 
year in 2014 with the fairgrounds at Spencer. Worcester County has one 
commercial airport at Worcester. The Worcester County Conservation District 
has countywide boundaries.[5] The County has a regional planning commission. 
Massachusetts law allows regional compacts, traditional counties and other 
governmental entities.[4] Traditional County governments in the state include: 
Norfolk, Bristol, Dukes, Nantucket, and Plymouth Counties. Barnstable County, 
which is Cape Cod, functions as a modern regional county government. Suffolk 
County which is mainly Boston is under the Boston City Council. The Massachusetts 
General Laws describe this relationship of county government and the options 
for abolishing county governments and/or chartering regional governmental 
compacts in subchapter 34 B.[4] Four other new county compacts have been 
created by the state legislature and these are in Hampshire, Franklin, 
Barnstable Counties, and a regional planning council level for Berkshire 
County. Thus 9 of 14 Counties have some form of county regional governments. 
Worcester County could exercise that option if it chooses for example, 
for public safety and, or preparedness due to its rather large geography, 
by a request to and a special act of the legislature, by local referendum 
or by one of three mechanisms. See the references for the state statute, 
and the League of Women Voters link. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 
the county has a total area of 1,579 square miles (4,090 km2), of which 
1,511 square miles (3,910 km2) is land and 68 square miles (180 km2) (4.3%) 
is water.[8] It is the largest county in Massachusetts by area. The county 
is larger geographically than the entire state of Rhode Island even including 
Rhode Island's water ocean limit boundaries. The county constitutes Central 
Massachusetts, separating Western Massachusetts on one side from Eastern 
Massachusetts and the Greater Boston area on the other side. It stretches 
from the northern to the southern border of the state. The geographic center 
of Massachusetts is in Rutland. Worcester County is one of two Massachusetts 
counties that borders three different neighboring states; the other being 
Berkshire County. They are also the only two counties to touch both the 
northern and southern state lines. In 1990 Worcester County had a population

communities that are included on the list are reflective if the census 
designated locations and villages were included as cities or towns. Data 
is from the 2007-2011 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.[20][21][22] 
Villages are census division, but have no separate corporate existence 
from the towns they are in. Coordinates: 42°21′N 71°55′W﻿ / ﻿42.35°N 71.91°W﻿
