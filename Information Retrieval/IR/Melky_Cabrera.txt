Melky Astacio Cabrera (born August 11, 1984) is a Dominican professional 
baseball left fielder for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He has also played for the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Kansas 
City Royals, San Francisco Giants, and Toronto Blue Jays. While primarily 
a left fielder throughout his career, Cabrera also spent a significant 
amount of his playing time as a center fielder for the Royals and Yankees. 
Cabrera signed with the Yankees as an amateur free agent. He made his MLB 
debut for the Yankees in 2005. After playing as a fourth outfielder, the 
Yankees included him in a trade to the Braves after the 2009 season. Struggling 
with the Braves in 2010, he was released, and signed by the Royals in 2011. 
Recommitting himself to the game, Cabrera had a strong year with the Royals, 
and was traded to the Giants for the 2012 season. In 2012, Cabrera made 
his first All-Star Game appearance, winning the All-Star Game MVP Award. 
One month later, Cabrera received a 50-game suspension after testing positive 
for high levels of testosterone. Cabrera was signed by the New York Yankees 
on November 14, 2001, at age 17, receiving a $175,000 signing bonus.[1] 
He played for the Staten Island Yankees in the Class A Short-Season New 
York–Penn League in 2003, batting .283 with 31 runs batted in (RBI) in 
67 games. In 2004, he was promoted to the Battle Creek Yankees of the Class 
A Midwest League, hitting .333 with 16 RBIs in 42 games.[1] He was promoted 
to the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, where 
he hit .288 with 51 RBIs in 85 games to finish the season. In 2005, Cabrera 
started off with the Trenton Thunder of the Double-A Eastern League, hitting 
.275 with 60 RBIs in 106 games. At the end of June, he was promoted to 
the Columbus Clippers of the Triple-A International League, where he hit 
.324 with three homers and 11 RBIs in nine games.[2][3] On July 7, he made 
his major league debut in center field at Yankee Stadium against the Cleveland 
Indians.[4] He collected his first major league hit, a single, in his third 
at-bat that day.[5] The next day he went 2-for-3 against Cleveland Indians 
pitcher Cliff Lee, scoring his first major league run, but then went 0-for-his-next-13 
and made costly miscues,[6] including one on July 15, 2005 against the 
Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, misplaying a Trot Nixon fly ball that resulted 
in an inside-the-park home run during a 17–1 defeat. He was sent down to 
Triple-A Columbus the next day for 17 games and then demoted again, back 
to Double-A Trenton to finish out the season.[7] Cabrera played 6 Major 
Leagues games batting .211. Cabrera saw a lot of time in spring training 
of 2006 with starting outfielders Johnny Damon and Bernie Williams playing 
in the World Baseball Classic. He impressed the Yankees by hitting .349 
in 16 games, but was ultimately sent down to Triple-A Columbus at the start 
of the season.[8] He started the season strongly at Triple-A Columbus, 
hitting .385 with 4 home runs and 24 RBIs in just 31 games before being 
called up on May 9, 2006 after left fielder Hideki Matsui broke his wrist 
and was on the disabled list until September 12, 2006. Cabrera replaced 
him in left field, and hit .318 in May with his first 10 career RBIs and 
two career stolen bases. On May 30, 2006, batting leadoff for only the 
second time in his career, he recorded his first career 4-hit game, going 
4-for-6.[9] He slumped in June, but hit his first major league home run 
on June 15.[10] On June 6, 2006, in the 8th inning of a 2–1 game against 
the Red Sox, he made an outstanding catch in left-center, leaping over 
the wall to take a home run away from Boston slugger Manny Ramírez.[11] 
This play earned Cabrera a "This Year In Baseball" award (voted on by the 
fans) for the outstanding play of the 2006 season.[12] Cabrera heated up 
again in July, hitting .313 with 14 RBIs. He had his first career five-RBI 
game on July 5, with his first career grand slam.[13] On the 18th, he hit 
his first career walk-off home run.[14] At 22, he was the second youngest 
Yankee ever to hit a walk-off home run, to the 21-year-old Mickey Mantle 
in 1953.[15] He finished the 2006 season tied for second in the league 
with 12 outfield assists.[16] In 130 games, Cabrera batted .280 with 7 
home runs and 50 RBI. Cabrera was slotted as fourth outfielder at the beginning 
of the 2007 season. He struggled, batting only .200 in April and .254 in 
May with limited playing time. He was batting .223 on the season when Jason 
Giambi went on the disabled list on June 1, 2007, giving him more playing 
time as Damon assumed Giambi's role of designated hitter and Cabrera took 
over center field from Damon. After this, he hit .320 with 3 of his 5 home 
runs and 21 of his 36 RBIs. He also had a 13-game hitting streak from July 
1 to 17. While Bobby Abreu was struggling that month, Cabrera hit second 
to enable Derek Jeter to hit third and cemented himself as the Yankees' 
starting center fielder, causing Giambi to compete with Damon for DH at-bats 
after returning from the DL. Cabrera had a career-high hitting streak of 
19 games, while continued to get his share of walks. Prior to the July 
31 trade deadline, the Texas Rangers offered Yankee GM Brian Cashman their 
closer, Éric Gagné, in exchange for Cabrera, but Cashman declined[17] and 
Cabrera went on to tie for third in outfield assists (16) for the season.[16] 
In 150 games to finish 2007, Cabrera batted .273 with 8 home runs and 73 
RBI. Cabrera was involved in a bench-clearing brawl against the Tampa Bay 
Rays in a 2008 spring training game. MLB claimed to have seen video showing 
Cabrera punching superstar Tampa third baseman Evan Longoria during the 
brawl, and suspended him for two games along with teammate Shelley Duncan. 
Third base coach Bobby Meacham and hitting coach Kevin Long were also fined 
an undisclosed amount for their actions in the brawl. Cabrera was a less-than-adequate 
hitter for the Yankees in 2008. His fielding and strong throwing arm in 
center field could not make up for his poor batting average. In early August, 
Yankee manager Joe Girardi demoted him to fourth outfielder, making Damon 
the everyday center fielder again. On August 15, 2008, Cabrera was demoted 
to Triple-A's Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees,[18] but recalled him on September 
5. Playing 129 games in 2008, Cabrera finished with a .249 batting average, 
8 home runs, and 37 RBI. After the 2008 season, the Yankees came close 
to trading Cabrera to the Milwaukee Brewers for veteran outfielder, Mike 
Cameron.[19] Remaining with the Yankees, Cabrera competed with Brett Gardner 
for the starting center field job[20] which Gardner won, relegating Cabrera 
to a backup role by manager Girardi once again.[21] On April 22, however, 
Cabrera hit the first walk-off hit in the New Yankee Stadium, a 2-run homer 
in the bottom of the 14th, for a 9–7 Yankee win. By late April, with Gardner 
slumping and Cabrera's streak of stellar play, Cabrera once again became 
the starting center fielder.[22] He won the Major League Baseball Clutch 
Performer of the Month of May.[23] On August 2, 2009, he became the first 
Yankee to hit for the cycle since Tony Fernandez did on September 3, 1995.[24] 
The home run was his 10th of the season, a new personal high. He also collected 
his 200th career RBI in the game,[citation needed] and finished the season 
with a .274 batting average, 13 home runs, and 68 RBI in 154 games. The 
Yankees finished the year with a 103-59 record and eventually won the World 
Series over the Philadelphia Phillies, giving Cabrera his first championship 
title and the Yankees their 27th title overall. On December 22, 2009, the 
Yankees traded Cabrera to the Atlanta Braves with Mike Dunn and pitching 
prospect Arodys Vizcaino for Javier Vázquez and Boone Logan,[25] with whom 
he signed a one-year deal worth $3.1 million with the Braves, avoiding 
arbitration.[26] Cabrera hit .255 with 4 home runs and 42 RBIs in 115 games 
for the 2010 Braves, and went 0-for-8 in the 2010 NLDS against the San 
Francisco Giants, who won the series three games to one.[27] He batted 
eighth for the Braves [28] and was described as "pudgy" and not diligent 
enough about his career to keep his weight down.[29] The Braves released 
him on October 19.[30] On December 9, 2010, Cabrera signed a one-year, 
$1.25 million contract with the Kansas City Royals,[31] eager for an opportunity 
to start consistently and hit in the middle of the lineup.[28] In his 2011 
breakout season, he set career highs in RBIs (87), runs scored (102), stolen 
bases (20), home runs (18) and batting average (.305), while finishing 
fourth in the American League in hits with 201 [32] and becoming the sixth 
Royal to record at least 200 hits in a season.[33] On November 7, 2011, 
the Royals traded Cabrera to the San Francisco Giants for talented but 
erratic southpaw Jonathan Sánchez and minor league pitcher Ryan Verdugo,[34] 
seeking to bolster their starting rotation and free up center field for 
Lorenzo Cain.[35] Cabrera started 2012 with a .275 career average,[36] 
but on May 29 he surpassed Willie Mays for most hits in the month of May 
in San Francisco Giants history with 50.[37] The next night, he tied Randy 
Winn's San Francisco record for most hits in any month with 51.[38] His 
hot hitting earned him one of the three starting outfielder positions for 
the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Kansas City with 7,521,784 
votes, the highest number received by a National League (NL) outfielder 
that year.[39] He singled in the first and hit a two-run homer in the fourth 
(the only round-tripper of the game) and was voted the All-Star Game MVP 
in the NL's 8–0 shutout win, going 2-for-3 with the two RBIs.[40] He was 
the fifth Giant player to be honored as All-Star Game MVP.[41] On August 
15, 2012, Cabrera was suspended for 50 games without pay for testing positive 
for high levels of testosterone, suggesting usage of MLB-proscribed performance-enhancing 
drugs. He admitted using a banned substance and was forced to accept the 
suspension. The suspension was effective immediately, meaning that Cabrera 
would take no further part for the remainder of the 2012 season. The suspension 
would also rule him out to start the 2013 season or if the Giants play 
enough games in the postseason (if the team clinched).[42] Prior to his 
suspension, he led the majors with 159 hits and was second in the NL with 
a .346 batting average. He ended his suspension-shortened season with 11 
home runs, 10 triples, 60 RBI and 13 stolen bases in 18 opportunities.[36][43] 
One of Cabrera's associates purchased a website for $10,000 and falsified 
its contents in a way that would have allowed Cabrera to challenge his 
suspension by claiming that the positive test was caused by a substance 
sold through that website, but MLB officials and federal investigators 
used forensics to trace the website back to Cabrera.[44][45][46] At his 
own request, Cabrera was ruled ineligible to win the 2012 NL batting title.[a][47] 
As the Giants clinched a postseason berth, Cabrera's suspension officially 
expired during the 2012 National League Championship Series. Although the 
suspension expired, the team decided to shut down Cabrera for the remainder 
of the postseason and revert him to the restricted list. The Giants would 
then go on to win the 2012 World Series over the Detroit Tigers. Despite 
his suspension, Cabrera received a 2012 World Series ring for his contributions 
to the team before his suspension.[49] Cabrera signed a two-year contract 
for $16 million with the Toronto Blue Jays on November 19, 2012.[50][51] 
In a game against the Detroit Tigers on April 9, 2013, Cabrera recorded 
his 1,000th career hit, a single off starter Anibal Sanchez. Cabrera battled 
a sore hamstring and quadriceps muscle through the first two months of 
the regular season, but the injuries did not warrant time on the disabled 
list.[52] Cabrera was occasionally removed from games in the later innings 
to rest his legs. In early June, it was reported that Major League Baseball 
would be pursuing suspensions for players implicated in the Biogenesis 
scandal, which Cabrera was reported to be a part of by Biogenesis founder 
Anthony Bosch. Numerous other high profile players were also implicated 
in the scandal, including Alex Rodriguez, Ryan Braun, and Nelson Cruz. 
Cabrera could have faced supplemental discipline regardless of the fact 
that he served a 50-game suspension at the end of the 2012 regular season, 
as MLB planned to further suspend players involved in the scandal for trying 
to cover their use of banned substances by using pseudonyms to purchase 
Biogenesis products[53] or for falsely denying any involvement whatsoever.[54] 
Cabrera responded to the speculation about a second suspension, saying 
"If they suspend me again, I think that would be a harsh punishment because 
I already served my sentence. But it's up to them. I believe I've already 
served my sentence, especially missing the playoffs. That's what hurt me 
the most."[55] Cabrera was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 27 
due to left knee tendinitis. Fan and player favorite Munenori Kawasaki 
was called up to take Cabrera's roster spot.[56] Cabrera returned from 
the disabled list on July 21 and played in 10 games before going back on 
the 15-day DL with irritation in his left knee. Neil Wagner was recalled 
to take Cabrera's roster spot.[57] On August 5, 2013, Cabrera was among 
several players previously linked to Biogenesis who were not given suspensions 
following the resolution of the Biogenesis scandal.[58][59] It was reported 
on August 8 that Cabrera would be out of the lineup until at least September 
for a left knee injury.[60] Manager John Gibbons told reporters on August 
22 that Cabrera would not play for the rest of the season.[61] On September 
7, Toronto general manager Alex Anthopoulos told reporters that Cabrera 
had undergone a successful surgery to remove a benign tumor from his lower 
spine on August 30, and that a full recovery was expected.[62] Shortened 
to 88 games in 2013, Cabrera batted .279 with 3 home runs and 30 RBI. Having 
recovered from his offseason surgery, Cabrera played fully in 2014 spring 
training, and lead the majors in hits and doubles during the spring with 
30[63] and 10 respectively.[64] He hit his only home run in the final game 
of spring training, a two-run shot to help the Blue Jays win 2–0 over the 
New York Mets on March 29 in Montreal.[65] On April 4, 2014, Cabrera became 
the first MLB player to bat against Masahiro Tanaka, and hit a lead-off 
solo home run off of him.[66] He would go on to record a four-game home 
run streak, besting his total of home runs from the previous season (3 
in 88 games played).[67] Cabrera broke a Blue Jays team record on April 
13, by hitting in his 13th consecutive game to open the season.[68] He 
would continue his hot hitting to open the season, setting another new 
Blue Jays franchise record for hits prior to May 1, when he recorded his 
40th hit in a game against the Kansas City Royals on April 29.[69] On May 
1, he and teammate Mark Buehrle were named the co-winners of the Honda 
Player of the Month Award for April.[70] Cabrera recorded his 500th career 
RBI on July 26, 2014, to aid the Blue Jays in breaking their 17-game losing 
streak at Yankee Stadium. On August 10, Cabrera drew a team-record 5 walks 
in a 6–5 win over the Detroit Tigers in 19 innings; the longest game in 
franchise history. He also became the first player to reach base 8 times 
in one game (the aforementioned 5 walks along with 3 hits) since Hall-of-Famer 
Rod Carew did so in 1972.[71] In a game against the Boston Red Sox on September 
5, Cabrera was injured while diving back to first base in the third inning 
and left the game.[72] He remained in the game but came out during his 
next at-bat in the sixth inning and was taken for x-rays, where it was 
determined that he had broken his right little finger and would require 
surgery,[72] ending his 2014 season.[73] At the time of his injury, he 
had 171 hits, second in the league to Jose Altuve, and had a .301 batting 
average. Coming to the end of his two-year contract with the Blue Jays, 
Cabrera expressed a desire to re-sign with Toronto.[74] On November 1,[75] 
the Blue Jays extended a qualifying offer to Cabrera for $15.3 million, 
which he later rejected.[76] After the 2014 season, Cabrera signed a three-year, 
$42 million contract with the Chicago White Sox.[73][77][78] In his first 
season with the White Sox in 2015, Cabrera played 158 games batting .273 
with 36 doubles, 12 home runs, and 77 RBI. In the offseason, Cabrera lives 
in Miami.[28] Cabrera and Robinson Canó became close friends as teammates 
in the minor leagues.[79] He has a son in the Dominican Republic named 
Melky Jr. and two daughters who live with their respective mothers in New 
York and Orlando.[80] His nickname around the Yankee clubhouse was "Leche" 
which is Spanish for "milk."[81][82] As a Giant he had a cheering section 
called the "Melkmen" in the AT&T Park stands during his record 51 hits 
in May 2012. They disbanded after his 50-game suspension.[83] Cabrera is
