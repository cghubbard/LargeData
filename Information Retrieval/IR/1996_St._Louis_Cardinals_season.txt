The St. Louis Cardinals 1996 season was the team's 115th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 105th season in the National League. During the 
first year of the William DeWitt, Jr. era, the Cardinals went 88-74 during 
the season and won their first-ever National League Central division title 
by six games over the Houston Astros. They beat the San Diego Padres in 
the NLDS, but fell in 7 games to the Atlanta Braves in the NLCS. DeWitt, 
along with Drew Bauer and Fred Hanser had bought the Cardinals from Anheuser-Busch 
during the 1995-96 offseason. Legendary veteran shortstop Ozzie Smith, 
announced during the season that it would be his last season in the Major 
Leagues, and veteran outfielder Willie McGee, brought back to the Cards 
as a free agent. Though the tension between Smith, and exciting youngster 
Royce Clayton, acquired in a trade, grew thick and troublesome at times 
as they shared time at shortstop, both players had good seasons. McGee 
came off the bench and started when needed. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos
