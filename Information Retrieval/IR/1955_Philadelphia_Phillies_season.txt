The 1955 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in American baseball. 
It was the first season for Phillies' manager Mayo Smith. Prior to the 
season, the Phillies were seen to have strong pitching with ace Robin Roberts 
but did not have power hitters to match pennant favorites Brooklyn, New 
York, or Milwaukee,[1] behind whom the Phillies finished in fourth place 
with a record of 77 and 77. Prior to the 1955 season, the Phillies purchased 
the 50-foot-tall (15 m) Ballantine Beer electronic scoreboard from Yankee 
Stadium for $175,000 from the Yankees. It was placed in right-center field 
at Connie Mack Stadium. This scoreboard was used through the final year 
at the ballpark.[2] In March 1955, the Phillies began spring training play 
at Clearwater's Jack Russell Stadium. The stadium was dedicated on March 
10, 1955.[3] Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick, National League president 
Warren Giles, American League president Will Harridge, Clearwater mayor 
Herbert M. Brown, and other city dignitaries were in attendance.[4] The 
Phillies played their first game at the stadium on the day of the dedication. 
Robin Roberts started for the Phillies against the Detroit Tigers. The 
Phillies won 4–2 on a two-run double by Willie Jones before 4,209 attendees.
