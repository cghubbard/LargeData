Whiteyball is a style of playing baseball that was developed by former 
Major League Baseball manager Whitey Herzog. The term was coined by the 
press during the 1982 World Series to describe the style of Herzog's St. 
Louis Cardinals. The team won the Series without a typical power hitter, 
instead using speed on the base paths, solid pitching, excellent defense, 
and line drive base hits. Whiteyball was well-suited to the fast, hard 
AstroTurf surface that Busch Memorial Stadium had at the time, which created 
large, unpredictable bounces when the ball hit it at sharp angles. In his 
book "White Rat", Herzog says the approach was a response to the spacious, 
artificial surface stadiums of the time. He said of the media's dismay 
at his teams' success: They seemed to think there was something wrong with 
the way we played baseball, with speed and defense and line-drive hitters. 
They called it "Whitey-ball" and said it couldn't last. Herzog used this 
strategy until he left the Cardinals in 1990. A 2012 sports article described 
Whiteyball as follows: Herzog used many switch-hitters such as Ozzie Smith, 
Willie McGee, Tom Herr, Terry Pendleton, Vince Coleman, José Oquendo, Garry 
Templeton, Ted Simmons, Luis Alicea, Mike Ramsey, Tony Scott, and Félix 
José along with Willie Wilson and U L Washington when he managed in Kansas 
City.[3] Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost used his own version of Whiteyball
