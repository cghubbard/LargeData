Brian Nikola Anderson (born March 11, 1982) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He played all or part of five seasons in Major League 
Baseball with the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox as an outfielder, 
a position he played professionally until before the 2010 season. He also 
played for the Kansas City Royals and New York Yankees organizations as 
a pitcher. Anderson is a graduate of the University of Arizona and Canyon 
del Oro High School in Oro Valley, Arizona, a suburb of Tucson. All-Star 
second baseman Ian Kinsler of the Texas Rangers was his best friend and 
teammate in high school,[1] where they played with Scott Hairston and the 
brothers Chris and Shelley Duncan. Anderson was named the top pro prospect 
in Arizona and ranked 27th in the nation by Baseball America. He was named 
to the Baseball America and USA Today Second-Team All-America team as a 
junior. Anderson was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the first round 
(15th overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. He made his major 
league debut on August 16, 2005, and appeared in 13 games for the White 
Sox. That offseason, Chicago traded Aaron Rowand to the Philadelphia Phillies 
in a deal that brought Jim Thome to Chicago, clearing the way for Anderson 
to become the starting center fielder. In 2006, Anderson showed himself 
to be a gifted defensive outfielder, though he struggled offensively, finishing 
with a .225 batting average despite signs of improvement in the second 
half of the season and some corrections in his swing mechanics.[2] Anderson 
did not commit an error at the Major League level until August 18, 2006 
against the Minnesota Twins, ending his streak of 110 errorless games. 
On May 20, 2006, Brian was ejected from an interleague game against the 
Chicago Cubs for fighting with Cubs first baseman John Mabry. Anderson 
was fined and served a five-game suspension. Anderson lost his starting 
job to Darin Erstad in 2007, and after only 17 at-bats was sent down to 
the White Sox' AAA affiliate, the Charlotte Knights.[3] At Charlotte, Anderson 
hit for a .255 average before his season ended with an injury, a disappointment 
in contrast to his 2005 season in which he hit .295. He eventually earned 
a spot back on the major-league roster in 2008 as a backup outfielder after 
a superb spring training changed the organization's negative perceptions 
of his effort.[4] Anderson again made the major-league roster in 2009 as 
a backup outfielder, with DeWayne Wise starting in center field.[5] However, 
Anderson retrieved the starting job after Wise was injured in April. On 
July 28, 2009, Anderson was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Mark Kotsay 
and cash considerations. He was non-tendered after the season. On December 
23, 2009, Anderson signed a 1-year, $750,000 contract with the Kansas City 
Royals. After spring training, Anderson informed the Royals that he wanted 
to become a pitcher.[6] The Royals allowed Anderson to become a pitcher 
in the low minors. Anderson began the 2010 season with the Rookie-level 
Arizona Royals and was later promoted to the Burlington Bees, followed 
by the Omaha Royals. Anderson signed a minor league contract with an invitation 
to 2011 spring training with the New York Yankees.[7] He started off the 
season with the Double-A Trenton Thunder, recording one win, three holds, 
and a 1.17 earned run average (ERA) in seven appearances. He was placed 
on the disabled list on May 4, and was later released by the Yankees on 
May 27.[8] On February 26, 2012, Anderson signed a minor league contract 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers with an invitation to spring training. On 
March 31, he was released. On April 7, 2012, Anderson signed a minor league 
contract with the Colorado Rockies. He was released 8 days later. On January 
15, 2015, Anderson attempted a comeback as a position player and signed 
a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. He was released on
