Mifflin County is the Penn State football team. In professional football, 
loyalties divide between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Philadelphia Eagles.

territories, though Baltimore Ravens games are also available through Harrisburg-based 
stations. The most popular baseball teams are the Pittsburgh Pirates and 
Philadelphia Phillies. Historically, football has been the most popular 
high school sport, but over the past decade, the most successful teams 
have been in boys and girls basketball[citation needed]. In the past, high 
school wrestling was more popular than basketball. Although basketball 
is now more popular than wrestling, wrestling remains more popular in Mifflin 
County and in Central Pennsylvania in general than in most parts of the 
United States[citation needed]. The girls field hockey team is one of the 
most successful high school teams.[citation needed]. As the schools combined, 
the competition grew harder as they faced the mid Penn conference[citation 
needed]. Under Pennsylvania law, there are four types of incorporated municipalities:
