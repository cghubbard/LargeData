Germantown is an urbanized census-designated place in Montgomery County, 
Maryland. With a population of 90,676 as of 2013 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, 
Germantown is the third most populous place in Maryland, after the city 
of Baltimore, and the census-designated place of Columbia, Maryland. If 
Germantown were to incorporate as a city, it would become the second largest 
incorporated city in Maryland, after Baltimore.[2][3] Germantown is located 
approximately 25–30 miles (40–48 km) outside of the U.S. capital of Washington, 
D.C., and is an important part of the Washingtonian metropolitan area. 
The original plan for Germantown divided the area into a downtown and six 
town villages:[4] Gunners Lake Village, Kingsview Village,[5] Churchill 
Village, Middlebrook Village,[6] Clopper's Mill Village, and Neelsville 
Village.[citation needed] The Churchill Town Sector at the corner of Maryland 
Route 118 and Middlebrook Road most closely resembles the downtown, or 
center, of Germantown, due to the location of the Upcounty Regional Services 
Center, the Germantown Public Library, the Black Rock Arts Center, the 
Regal Germantown Stadium 14, and a pedestrian shopping that features an 
array of restaurants. Three exits to Interstate 270 are less than one mile 
away, the Maryland Area Regional Commuter train is within walking distance, 
and the Germantown Transit Center that provides Ride On shuttle service 
to the Shady Grove station of the Washington Metro's Red Line. Germantown 
has the assigned ZIP codes of 20874 and 20876 for delivery and 20875 for 
post office boxes. It is the most populous Germantown in Maryland and is 
the only "Germantown, Maryland" that is recognized by the United States 
Postal Service, although there are others: one in Anne Arundel County, 
one in Baltimore County, and one in Worcester County.[7] In the 1830s and 
1840s, the central business area was focused around the intersection of 
Liberty Mill Road and Clopper Road. Several German immigrants set up shop 
at the intersection and the town became known as "German Town", even though 
most residents of the town were of English or Scottish descent.[8] Germantown 
did not have a public school until after the end of the American Civil 
War. During that time, education was handled at homes. In 1868, a one-room 
schoolhouse was built on Maryland Route 118, near Black Rock Road, which 
hosted children from both Germantown and neighboring Darnestown. In 1883, 
a larger one-room schoolhouse was built closer to Clopper Road. Another, 
newer school was constructed in 1910, on what is now the site of Germantown 
Elementary School. This school had four rooms, with two downstairs and 
two upstairs, with each room housing two grade levels. After the eighth 
grade, the students would head via train to nearby Rockville, for further 
education.[9] Although it avoided much of the physical destruction that 
ravaged other cities in the region, the American Civil War was still a 
cause of resentment and division among residents of Germantown. Many Germantown 
residents, particularly those of German ancestry, were against slavery 
and had sons fighting for the Union Army. In contrast, other residents 
of Germantown, particularly those of English ancestry, owned slaves, and 
even those who weren't slave-owners had sons fighting for the Confederate 
Army. As a result, many people in Germantown, who were once on friendly 
terms with each other, made an effort not to interact with each other, 
such as switching churches, or frequenting a store or mill miles away from 
the ones they would normally do business with.[10] Late in the summer and 
fall of 1861, there were more than twenty thousand Union Army soldiers 
camped to the west of Germantown, in neighboring Darnestown and Poolesville. 
Occasionally, these soldiers would come to Germantown and frequent the 
stores there. In September 1862 and in June 1863, several regiments of 
Union Army soldiers marched north on Maryland Route 355, on their way to 
the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Gettysburg, respectively. In 
July 1864, General Jubal Early led his army of Confederate soldiers down 
Maryland Route 355 to attack the Union capital of Washington, D.C. Throughout 
the course of the war, Confederate raiders would often come through the 
Germantown area. Local farmers in the Germantown area lost horses and other 
livestock to both Union and Confederate armies.[11] On April 20, 1865, 
George Atzerodt, a co-conspirator in the assassination of U.S. President 
Abraham Lincoln, was captured in Germantown. He was assigned by John Wilkes 
Booth to assassinate U.S. Vice President Andrew Johnson, but did not do 
it and instead fled Washington, D.C., on the night of the Lincoln assassination. 
He was captured at the farm of his cousin Hartman Richter, on Schaeffer 
Road near Clopper Road. Atzerodt was hanged on July 7, 1865, along with 
Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, and David Herold at Washington, D.C.'s Fort 
McNair.[12][13] George Atzerodt had come to the town with his family from 
Prussia when he was about nine years old. When he was about 14 his father 
moved the family to Virginia, but George still had many friends and relatives 
in Germantown. He was living in Port Tobacco during the Civil War, and 
supplementing his meager income as a carriage painter by smuggling people 
across the Potomac River in a row boat. This clandestine occupation brought 
him into contact with John Surratt and John Wilkes Booth and he was drawn 
into a plot to kidnap President Lincoln. On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes 
Booth gave George Atzerodt a gun and told him that he was to kill the vice 
president, Andrew Johnson, which he refused to do. George panicked when 
he found out that Booth had shot President Lincoln and made his way to 
his cousin's, Hartman Richter's, house in Germantown to hide. He was discovered 
there by soldiers three days after the assassination and[14] was hanged 
with other conspirators on July 7. The wooden structure of the Bowman Brothers 
Mill fell victim to a fire in 1914, but four years later, the owners were 
back in business again, selling the mill to the Liberty Milling Company, 
a brand new corporation. Augustus Selby was the first owner and manager 
of the new Liberty Mill, which opened in 1918. Electricity was brought 
into Liberty Mill and also served the homes and businesses nearby, making 
Germantown the first area in the northern portion of Montgomery County 
to receive electricity.[15] In 1935, professional baseball player Walter 
Perry Johnson, who played as a pitcher for the Washington Senators (now 
the Minnesota Twins), purchased a farm on what is now the site of Seneca 
Valley High School. Used as a dairy farm, Johnson lived there with his 
five children and his mother, as his wife died, until his death in 1946.[16] 
"Feed the Liberty Way" was used as a slogan for Liberty Mill which, with 
eight silos, became the second largest mill in all of Maryland, supplying 
flour to the United States Army during World War II. Cornmeal and animal 
feed were also manufactured at Liberty Mill, and a store at the mill sold 
specialty mixes, such as pancake and muffin mix.[17] In January 1958, the 
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was relocated from its location in downtown 
Washington, D.C. to Germantown, which was considered far enough from the 
city to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack.[18] The facility now operates 
as an administration complex for the U.S. Department of Energy and headquarters 
for its Office of Biological and Environmental Research. Marshall Davis 
owned a farm located where Interstate 270 and Germantown Road intersect 
today.[19] After Interstate 270 divided his farm in two, Davis decided 
to sell the last of his land to the International Development Corporation 
for about $1,300 per acre in 1955.[19] Fairchild-Hiller Corporation bought 
the land for about $4,000 per acre in 1964, and it built an industrial 
park on the land four years later.[19] Harry Unglesee and his family sold 
their farm near Hoyles Mill Road for less than $1,000 per acre in 1959.[19] 
Other farmers soon sold their land to developers and speculators as well.[19] 
The Germantown Master Plan was adopted in 1967.[20] The plan for the 17-square-mile 
(44 km2) area included a dense central downtown area and less dense development 
surrounding it.[6] In 1974, the Montgomery County Council approved an amended 
plan written by the Montgomery County Planning Board.[20] The amended plan 
included a downtown area and six separate villages, each comprising smaller 
neighborhoods with schools, shopping areas, and public facilities.[6] The 
amended plan also included the construction of a third campus for Montgomery 
College near the downtown area.[6] During the 1970s, Wernher von Braun, 
a German rocket scientist during World War II, worked for the aerospace 
company Fairchild Industries, which had offices in Germantown, as its Vice 
President for Engineering and Development. Von Braun worked at Fairchild 
Industries from July 1, 1972 until his death. Following the end of World 
War II, the Liberty Mill went into disrepair, and was finally destroyed 
by an arsonist in 1971.[21] In 1974, the completion of a sewer line helped 
the development and growth of Germantown.[22] The Germantown Campus of 
Montgomery College opened on October 21, 1978. At the time, it consisted 
of two buildings, 24 employees, and 1,200 students. Enrollment had increased 
to five thousand students by 2003, with eighty employees across four buildings. 
A steel water tower modeled after the Earth can be seen from orbiting satellites 
in outer space. As of 2008, a forty-acre bio-technology laboratory was 
nearing completion.[23] Since the early 1980s, Germantown has experienced 
rapid economic and population growth, both in the form of townhouses and 
single-family dwellings, and an urbanized "town center" has been built. 
Germantown was the fastest growing zip code in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan 
area and Maryland in 1986, and the 1980s saw a population growth of 323.3% 
for Germantown.[24] In 2000, the Upcounty Regional Services Center (now 
the Sidney Kramer Upcounty Regional Services Center)[25] opened in Germantown, 
and a 16,000 square feet section of the first floor was home to the Germantown 
Public Library for several years.[26][27] In 2000 the Maryland SoccerPlex 
opened in Germantown. The sports complex includes nineteen natural grass 
fields, three artificial fields, a 5,200 seat soccer stadium with lighting 
and press box, eight indoor convertible basketball/volleyball courts. Two 
miniature golf courses, a splash park, a driving range, an archery course, 
community garden, model boat pond, two BMX courses, tennis center, and 
a swim center are also located within the confines of the complex. The 
soccerplex is the current home of the Washington Spirit of the National 
Women's Soccer League. In March 2001, Germantown's only movie theater, 
the Sony 6, located at the Germantown Commons Shopping Center, closed down 
as part of a closure of 112 movie theaters across the United States by 
Loews Cineplex, leaving Germantown without a movie theater of its own. 
As a result, local residents frequented a movie theater in Kentlands or 
one at The Rio in Gaithersburg. Over a year later, on May 3, 2002, the 
Hoyts Cinema 14, now the Regal Germantown Stadium 14, opened, and Germantown 
now had its own movie theater once again.[28][29] A DSW footwear retail 
store now sits on the site of the former Sony 6 theater. In June 2002, 
it was announced that a Staples and Best Buy store would open at Germantown's 
Milestone Shopping Center later that fall. Opening later that year, the 
Best Buy store replaced a Homeplace store that had closed down in 2001 
following that company's disbandment.[30][31] In 2007, at a cost of 19 
million dollars, the Germantown Public Library moved from the Upcounty 
Regional Services Center to its current location, at a separate 44,193 
square foot facility at the nearby Germantown Town Center.[26] In 2000, 
Germantown had a population of 55,419, according to the 2000 United States 
Census. Ten years later, at the time of the 2010 United States Census, 
Germantown had experienced a 55.9% growth in population, growing from 55,419 
to 86,395. On August 14, 2011, a 7-Eleven convenience store in downtown 
Germantown fell victim to a flash mob robbery, in which nearly forty people 
walked into the store, grabbed merchandise, and subsequently fled with 
the stolen goods, all without paying. The incident garnered widespread 
attention in the United States and internationally.[32] On September 29, 
2013, the Upcounty Regional Services Center in Germantown was renamed as 
the Sidney Kramer Upcounty Regional Services Center, after Sidney Kramer, 
the Montgomery County executive from 1986 to 1990.[25] Holy Cross Health 
opened a 237,000-square-foot (22,000 m2) hospital on the campus of Montgomery 
College in October 2014. The 93-bed hospital is projected to eventually 
bring 5,000 jobs to the area.[33] Despite its size, Germantown has never 
been incorporated formally as a town or a city. It has no mayor or city 
council and is thus governed by Montgomery County. It is represented by 
Democrat Craig L. Rice in the Montgomery County council.[34] The U.S. Department 
of Energy has its headquarters for the Office of Biological and Environmental 
Research in Germantown. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was moved from 
its location in downtown Washington, D.C. to the present-day U.S. Department 
of Energy building in Germantown, due to fears of a Soviet nuclear attack 
on the U.S. capital. At the time, Germantown was believed to be far enough 
from Washington, D.C. to avoid the worst effects of a nuclear strike on 
the city. The facility now operates as an administration complex for the 
U.S. Department of Energy. Library Systems & Services, Qiagen North America, 
Earth Network Systems Inc., Digital Receiver Technology Inc.,[35] and Hughes 
Network Systems have their headquarters in Germantown.[36] Wabtec, Xerox, 
General Electric Aviation, WeatherBug, and Proxy Aviation Systems[37] all 
have offices in Germantown. Germantown is located approximately 428 feet 
above sea level, at 39°11′N 77°16′W﻿ / ﻿39.183°N 77.267°W﻿ / 39.183; -77.267. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total 
area of 10.9 sq mi (28.0 km²), of which, all but 0.039 sq mi (0.1 km2) 
(0.46%) of which is land. Germantown lies within the humid subtropical 
climate zone (Köppen Cfa), with hot, humid summers, cool winters, and generous 
precipitation year-round. Its location above the fall line in the Piedmont 
region gives it slightly lower temperatures than cities to the south and 
east such as Washington, D.C. and Silver Spring. Summers are hot and humid 
with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. July is the warmest month, with 
an average temperature of 77 °F (25.0 °C). Winters are cool but variable, 
with sporadic snowfall and lighter rain showers of longer duration. January 
is the coldest month, with an average temperature of 33.5 °F (0.8 °C). 
Average annual rainfall totals 40.36 in (103 cm).[citation needed] As of 
2013 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, Germantown had a population of 
90,676. As of the census of 2010, there were 86,395 people, and 30,531 
households residing in the area. The population density was 8,019 people 
per square mile (3,096.6/km²). The racial makeup of the area was 36.3% 
White, 21.8% African American, 0.2% Native American, 19.7% Asian, 0.03% 
Pacific Islander, 0.3% from other races, and 3.3% from two or more races. 
Hispanic or Latino of any race were 18.4% of the population. There were 
20,893 households out of which 41.2% had children under the age of 18 living 
with them, 49.8% were married couples living together, 13.7% had a female 
householder with no husband present, and 32.4% were non-families. 23.5% 
of all households were made up of individuals and 1.8% had someone living 
alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 
2.80 and the average family size was 3.19. In the area, the population 
was spread out with 28.9% under the age of 18, 7.7% from 18 to 24, 43.0% 
from 25 to 44, 17.3% from 45 to 64, and 3.1% who were 65 years of age or 
older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females there were 94.9 
males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.6 males. The 
median income for a household in Germantown was $76,061 as of a 2010 estimate 
by the website, City-Data.[40] 6.5% of the population and 3.5% of families 
were below the poverty line. Out of the total people living in poverty, 
5.9% are under the age of 18 and 9.9% are 65 or older. Public schools in 
Germantown are part of the Montgomery County Public Schools system. Montgomery 
College, the largest higher education institution in Montgomery County, 
has a campus in Germantown. Germantown is bisected by Interstate 270 and 
has a station on the MARC train commuter service's Brunswick Line, which 
operates over CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision. The station building itself, 
at the corner of Liberty Mill Road and Mateny Hill Road, is a copy of the 
original 1891 structure designed by E. Francis Baldwin for the Baltimore 
and Ohio Railroad. The current building was rebuilt after it was burned 
down by arson in 1978. The Montgomery County public transit bus system, 
Ride On, serves Germantown with approximately 20 bus routes and operates 
a major transit hub in Germantown, known as the Germantown Transit Center. 
Also, a light rail system (the Corridor Cities Transitway) is under evaluation 
which would, when completed, connect the terminal of the Washington Metro 
Red Line at Shady Grove Station near Gaithersburg to Germantown and continue 
on northward to Clarksburg. The BlackRock Center for the Arts is located 
in the downtown Germantown, at the Germantown Town Center. The BlackRock 
Center for the Arts also sponsors the Germantown Oktoberfest, an annual 
festival held every year in the fall, which includes various genres of 
music, including traditional German folk, rock and pop. The Harmony Express 
Men's Chorus is a 4-part a cappella men's chorus based in Germantown. The 
band Clutch is also from Germantown, MD. The Maryland SoccerPlex sports 
complex is located in Germantown. The arena now hosts the Washington Spirit 
of the National Women's Soccer League as well as amateur, collegiate, and 
regional soccer tournaments. The Germantown Historical Society (GHS) was 
formed in 1990 as a non-profit organization with a mission to educate the 
public about local history and preserve local historic sites. The GHS office 
and future museum is located in the historic Germantown Bank (1922) at 
19330 Mateny Hill Road, across from the MARC railroad station. The GHS 
offers lectures on local history and has traveling exhibits about Germantown. 
It also sells the books, Liberty Mill T-shirts, and other souvenirs. The 
main fundraiser for the organization is the Germantown Community Flea Market, 
held on the first Saturday of the month April through November in the MARC 
parking lot, Rt. 118 and Bowman Mill Drive, featuring more than 150 vendors.[42] 
Germantown is served by a news and information website called Germantown 
Pulse.[43] Germantown veterans are served by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 
American Legion Post 295.[44] American Legion Post 295 sponsors Cub Scout 
Pack 436, a Venturing Crew and is establishing a Sea Scout Ship. American 
Legion Boys State and American Legion Baseball have been longtime programs
