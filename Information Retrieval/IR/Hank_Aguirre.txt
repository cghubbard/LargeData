Henry John "Hank" Aguirre (January 31, 1931 – September 5, 1994) was a 
Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher who played with the Cleveland Indians 
(1955–57), Detroit Tigers (1958–67), Los Angeles Dodgers (1968), and Chicago 
Cubs (1969–70). He went on to become a successful businessman in Detroit, 
Michigan. His last name was typically pronounced "ah-GEAR-ee." Nicknamed 
"Mex" because he was of Mexican descent, Aguirre was born on January 31, 
1931, in Azusa, California to Jenny Alva and Joseph Aguirre. Joseph was 
born in Jalisco, Mexico in 1902 and emigrated with his family during the 
time of the Mexican Revolution. Joseph and Jenny had seven children. In 
his youth, Hank Aguirre worked for his father's business, the Aguirre Tortillas 
Factory in San Gabriel. He made, packaged and delivered tortillas. At 4 
a.m., the young Aguirre would make deliveries — mostly running — before 
school. He graduated from Mark Keppel High School in Alhambra, California, 
in 1949, but his "goofy feet" (his words) prevented him from being selected 
to be part of the baseball team. Hank graduated from East Los Angeles College 
in 1951. As a rookie for the Cleveland Indians in 1956, Aguirre struck 
out Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams the first time he faced him. After 
the game, Aguirre asked Williams to autograph the ball. Reluctantly, Williams 
complied. A couple of weeks later Aguirre faced Williams again. This time 
the "Splendid Splinter" smashed Aguirre's first offering for a home run. 
While circling the bases, Williams yelled to Aguirre, "Get that ball, and 
I'll sign it, too." He pitched in the big leagues for 16 years for four 
different teams. Before the 1958 season began, Aguirre was traded to the 
Detroit Tigers, where he remained for 10 years from 1958 to 1967. Aguirre 
was principally a relief pitcher until 1962. During a 1962 game at Yankee 
Stadium, Tigers manager Bob Scheffing used him as a starter when Don Mossi 
had arm trouble. Scheffing wanted a left-hander to pitch against the Yankees, 
and he chose Aguirre. Aguirre joined the Tigers starting rotation and finished 
the 1962 season with a 2.21 earned run average (ERA) in 42 games (22 as 
a starter), the best in Detroit since Hal Newhouser in 1946. Having pitched 
over 100 innings (216 in total) for the first time in his career, Aguirre 
led the Major Leagues in ERA (0.33 points lower than Sandy Koufax who was 
second best), won 16 games, and was selected to the American League All-Star 
team. He also led the American League in WHIP (walks plus hits per innings 
pitched) with a 1.051 average. Aguirre also finished 17th in the 1962 American 
League Most Valuable Player voting. Aguirre lost his spot in the Tigers 
starting rotation in 1966, and returned to the bullpen. Before the start 
of the 1968 season, Aguirre was traded by the Tigers to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for a player to be named later. In one season with the Dodgers, 
Aguirre allowed only three runs in 39 1⁄3 innings for a 0.69 ERA. Despite 
the good season, Aguirre was released by the Dodgers and spent the final 
two seasons of his big league career pitching for Leo Durocher's Chicago 
Cubs, where he was a combined 4–0 in 1969 and 1970. In 16 MLB seasons, 
Aguirre finished with a record of 75–72 in 1,375 2⁄3 innings pitched, with 
856 strikeouts and an ERA of 3.24. Aguirre spent three years (1972–74) 
as a coach for the Cubs, including 1973 as bullpen coach and 1974 as pitching 
coach.[1] Aguirre had a reputation as one of baseball's worst-hitting pitchers. 
He had an .085 lifetime average, going 33-for-388 at the plate, with no 
home runs, striking out 236 times while drawing 14 walks. In 1979, with 
the encouragement and support of Jack Masterson, an executive with Volkswagen 
of America, and attorney John Noonan, Aguirre founded Mexican Industries, 
Inc. The company, based in Detroit, operated as a labor-intensive, minority-oriented 
enterprise that supplied specialized parts to American automobile manufacturers. 
After a difficult start, Mexican Industries thrived during the 1980s, becoming 
a multimillion-dollar business and creating hundreds of jobs (primarily 
for the Hispanics of southwestern Detroit's "Mexicantown"). In 1987 Aguirre 
was named "Businessman of the Year" by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.[2] 
Hank Aguirre died on September 5, 1994, following a two-year battle with 
prostate cancer. He is buried in San Gabriel in the churchyard of the (Roman 
Catholic) Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, "where he worshiped as a boy."[3] 
Upon his death, control of the privately owned company Aguirre had founded 
passed to his adult children. In 1999, Mexican Industries, Inc., was unionized 
(following several unsuccessful attempts over the previous two decades) 
by the United Auto Workers labor union under Bob King. In 2001, the firm 
filed for bankruptcy, laid off its workers, and subsequently closed its 
doors. According to union activists, "Workers blame[d] the owners, not 
only for hostility toward their union but for mismanaging the company."[4]
