Morgantown is a city in and the county seat of Monongalia County, West 
Virginia. Situated along the banks of the Monongahela River, Morgantown 
is the largest city in North-Central West Virginia, and the base of the 
Morgantown, West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area. It has a permanent 
population of 29,660 per the 2010 census, with West Virginia University 
adding several thousand seasonal residents to the city and surrounding 
area from September through May. Morgantown is best known as the home of 
West Virginia University and the one-of-a-kind Morgantown Personal Rapid 
Transit system. Morgantown is closely tied to the Anglo-French struggle 
for this territory. Until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, what is now known 
as Morgantown was greatly contested by settlers and Native Americans, and 
by the British and the French. The treaty decided the issue in favor of 
the British, but Indian fighting continued almost to the beginning of the 
American Revolution. Zackquill Morgan, son of Morgan Morgan, and his brother 
David entered the area of Virginia that would become Morgantown in about 
1767, although others such as Thomas Decker are recorded as attempting 
settlements in the area earlier or at about the same time. As well, several 
forts were built in the area during this time: Fort Pierpont near the Cheat 
River, in 1769; Fort Coburn, near Dorsey's Knob, in 1770. Fort Morgan, 
at the present site of Morgantown, in 1772; Fort Dinwiddle, north several 
miles at Stewartstown, in 1772; Fort Martin, several miles north on the 
Monongahela River, in 1773; Fort Burris in the present-day Suncrest area 
of Morgantown, in 1774; and Fort Kern in the present-day Greenmont area 
of Morgantown, in 1774, in addition to other, smaller forts. Zackquill 
Morgan settled the area about 1772 by establishing a homestead near present-day 
Fayette Street and University Avenue. Morgan fought in both the French 
and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of 
colonel. By 1783, following his wartime duties, Colonel Morgan commissioned 
Major William Haymond to survey his land and divide it into streets and 
lots. Colonel Morgan then received a legal certificate for 400 acres (1.6 km2) 
in the area of his settlement near the mouth of Decker's Creek. 50 acres 
(200,000 m2) were appropriated for Morgan's Town by the Virginia General 
Assembly in October 1785. On February 3, 1838, the Virginia General Assembly 
enacted a municipal charter incorporating the city, now with a population 
of about 700, as Morgantown, Virginia. The town became part of the newly 
created state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863, through the Reorganized 
Government of Virginia. Notable early structures still standing in Morgantown 
as of 2012 include the Old Stone House, built in 1795 by Jacob Nuce on 
Long Alley (the modern-day Chestnut Street)[6] and the John Rogers family 
home on Foundry Street, built in 1840 and occupied as of 2011 by the Dering 
Funeral Home.[7] During the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Transportation 
built an experimental personal rapid transit system in the city, citing 
the area's variable seasonal climates and geographic elevations as factors 
in testing the technology's viability. The Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit 
(PRT) has been in use since 1975. University students use the system for 
free to travel between the spread-out campuses. Morgantown is located 75 
miles (121 km) south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 208 mi (335 km) north-northwest 
of Washington, D.C., 204 mi (328 km) east of Columbus, Ohio, and 156 mi 
(251 km) northeast of Charleston, West Virginia. Morgantown is just south 
of the Mason–Dixon line. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 10.62 square miles (27.51 km2), of which, 
10.17 square miles (26.34 km2) is land and 0.45 square miles (1.17 km2) 
is water.[2] Morgantown lies in the transition between a humid subtropical 
(Köppen Cfa) and humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), with four distinct 
seasons. Winters are cool to cold with a January daily mean temperature 
of 31.3 °F (−0.4 °C), an average seasonal snowfall of 21.0 inches (53 cm) 
and 1.7 nights of sub-0 °F (−18 °C) readings. Summers are hot and humid 
with a July daily mean temperature of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C) and 12 days of 
90 °F (32 °C)+ highs annually. Precipitation is generous, with winter being 
the driest period and May through July the wettest. Extreme temperatures 
range from −20 °F (−29 °C) on January 16, 1972, up to 108 °F (42 °C) on 
July 25, 1892, although, as of 2013[update], 100 °F (38 °C)+ temperatures 
have only been recorded nine times since record-keeping began in 1877, 
five of which occurred in 1892 alone. Morgantown is made up of several 
neighborhoods, some of which had been independent towns that were annexed 
by the city as it continued to grow. Neighborhoods include First Ward, 
Woodburn, South Park, Jerome Park, South Hills, Second Ward, Greenmont, 
Suncrest, Evansdale, Wiles Hill, Sunnyside, Sabraton, the Mileground, and 
North Hills. While some of these, such as the Mileground, Easton, and Sabraton, 
are in part or entirely outside the city limits, they are still considered 
part of Morgantown. The City of Morgantown contained an estimated 31,073 
residents in 2014.[10] The Morgantown MSA contains roughly 117,000[citation 
needed] permanent residents, including over 30,000[11] full-time students 
at West Virginia University. Fort Burris was erected in 1774 in what became 
the Suncrest area of Morgantown. The fort was a settler's blockhouse located 
in what as of 2010 is the Summers Masonic Lodge at the intersection of 
Burroughs and Windsor streets. During 1885–1888, the land in the Evansdale/Suncrest 
area was agricultural, with farms of 400–1,000 acres (1.6–4.0 km2). Drummond's 
Chapel was named after a minister who then moved to Missouri. The Evans 
Farm was located on land near Riverview Drive and 8th Street and was named 
for Colonel John Evans, who fought in the American Revolution with Morgantown 
founder Zack Morgan. The Krepps farmhouse was located on land where the 
West Virginia University Creative Arts Center, Engineering and Agricultural 
buildings would later be built. Dilley Farm was located on the other side 
of 8th street. The Van Voorhis Farm was large. Down Collins Ferry Road 
was the Anderson Farm. The Jacobs Farm was below Elmhurst and Mulberry. 
Trolley cars determined how far people lived outside of the city, and did 
not reach to what is now Suncrest. By 1920, however, cars were becoming 
common. In 1923, the Monongahela Development Company bought land from Krepps 
and most others else in the area. Suncrest Park bought Sears Roebuck house 
plans and divided Suncrest into three areas: Fairfield Street, Suncrest 
Park and Suncrest. No African-Americans, Jews or immigrants were permitted 
to buy land there. In 1928, the Suncrest Home Association developers gave 
30 acres (120,000 m2) for what became Krepps Park. A civic group built 
facilities and the park was given to Morgantown, which made some improvements. 
By 1937, Suncrest needed a town government to pave streets and provide 
water and sewer. Dr. Julian Leach, a WVU plant pathologist, was elected 
mayor; Bill Hart was a later mayor. Suncrest finally became part of Morgantown. 
In 1940 the Dupont industrial park around the Kenmore Street area built 
100 homes with six different floor plans. From 1947 to 1950, Gunnison homes 
were built in the Mulberry and Lake Street areas. The development of the 
DuPont Ordnance Works during World War II in Westover resulted in a large 
number of prefabricated homes being constructed in Suncrest. Old Suncrest 
and Suncrest Addition were among the names given to various subsections 
of this growing community. The names of some streets reflected the community's 
participation in various service organizations, such as Civitan, Kiwanis, 
Lions and Rotary. Before Suncrest became part of Morgantown in 1949, it 
had first been incorporated in 1937 as the town of Suncrest; the name came 
from a developer who looked out one morning and saw the sun crest over 
a hill. The area from University Avenue to the university's medical school 
held a racetrack at one point. When there was talk of building a medical 
school in West Virginia, Charleston and Huntington vied for it, but Morgantown 
offered to give 60 acres (240,000 m2) and provide a county hospital. A 
cemetery with 200 graves near what is now Ruby Memorial Hospital had to 
be relocated to the West Run area. Around 1928, there was an airport near 
where the West Virginia University Coliseum was later built. Suncrest students 
attend three or four schools throughout their K-12 education, starting 
at Suncrest Primary School or North Elementary School, Suncrest Middle 
School and Morgantown High School depending on where they live. In 2000, 
the White House Millennium Council designated Suncrest as a Millennium 
Community.[citation needed] Sunnyside, located just north of downtown Morgantown, 
is an older neighborhood adjacent to West Virginia University's downtown 
campus. The neighborhood is bounded by University Avenue to the east and 
Campus Drive to the south. Close to the downtown campus of West Virginia 
University and for decades known as a neighborhood of student housing, 
is also the scene of many off-campus parties and post-game celebrations 
including, until 1995,[12] to the unsanctioned annual back-to-school block 
party that would annually draw upward of 10,000 revelers to celebrate the 
start of fall classes.[13] The university and city put an end to the tradition 
that year[12] after two students, Monica Potter of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
and Jason Callahan of Pennsauken, New Jersey, were shot in the leg the 
previous year.[14] The City of Morgantown and West Virginia University 
jointly established the Sunnyside Up Project: Campus Neighborhoods Revitalization 
Corporation, dedicated to the redevelopment of this area. The first step 
was to create a comprehensive revitalization plan, which was published 
in fall 2004.[15] The university's Summit Hall Dormitory and the Honors 
Hall Dormitory are located in the southern part of the neighborhood. First 
Ward is located south of High Street in Morgantown. First Ward Elementary 
School was formerly located there; however, it was demolished and the playground 
area converted to Jack Roberts Park, one of two parks in the area along 
with White Park. Both include recreational facilities. The city's reservoir 
is in this neighborhood and sports several biking and hiking trails on 
almost all sides. White Park is the location of the Morgantown Municipal 
Ice Arena and also features athletic fields and wooded hiking trails. The 
Mountaineer Mall, Morgantown's first mall, is located here, as are South 
Middle School and the Monongalia County Technical Education Center. The 
Wharf District is located along the west side of First Ward, on the banks 
of the Monongahela River. South Park is across Deckers Creek from downtown 
Morgantown. Originally farmland, it was one of the first suburbs of Morgantown. 
In the early 20th century, South Park experienced a housing boom, with 
wealthy and influential citizens settling there. The neighborhood is home 
to Morgantown High School, built in 1924 and later expanded. The neighborhood 
is designated a historic district by the National Register of Historic 
Places. Woodburn used to be farmland on the hills to the east of downtown 
Morgantown. It encompasses the area enclosed by Richwood Avenue in the 
south and Willey Street in the north. Monongalia Avenue serves as the western 
boundary and the eastern boundary begins in the south at the intersection 
of Richwood Avenue and Darst Street, and continues north until Darst intersects 
with Willey Street at the beginning of the Mileground. While it used to 
be home to small hillside farmsteads, Woodburn grew into a typical city 
neighborhood in the late 19th century. Many of the street names, such as 
Louise Avenue, James Street, and Ridgeway Avenue, are named for early farm 
families, and many of the original farmhouses remained standing in the 
first decade of the 21st century. The area saw a rapid growth in population 
at the beginning of the 20th century as home to tinsmiths from Wales who 
came to work in the tinplate mill that later became the Sterling Faucet 
plant in Sabraton. A trolley line ran the length of Richwood Avenue and 
originally connected downtown with Sabraton. The Welsh community was active 
in the Methodist Church at the intersection of High Street and Willey Street, 
and held picnics in Whitemoore Park, the main green space in Woodburn.[16] 
Many of these immigrants retained the Welsh language, and as late as the 
1930s it was common to hear Welsh spoken on the streets of Woodburn and 
the community was known for carrying on a traditional eisteddfod every 
year. Woodburn Elementary School was the neighborhood school built in 1910. 
Following World War II, many new families came to Woodburn, attracted by 
the parkland, close proximity to downtown, community atmosphere, and nearby 
school. In 1950, Tom and Anna Torch opened the Richwood Avenue Confectionery, 
a corner store and lunch counter that served beer in large Weiss goblets 
from the Morgantown Glassworks. When they sold the operation in 1963 to 
Mario and Rose Spina, the establishment was nicknamed "Marios Fishbowl" 
in honor of the goblets. A neighborhood newspaper was published here in 
the 1980s. Primarily residential, Jerome Park is located to the east of 
Woodburn. In 2012, the city bought two acres that include the old Jerome 
Park Elementary School playground, and made it a park called the Paul Preserve. 
The neighborhood also contains Whitemoore Park. The site of the tinplate 
mill that later became the Sterling Faucet plant, this neighborhood in 
its early days was connected to downtown Morgantown by a trolley line that 
ran the length of Richwood Avenue. Its amenities include the recreation 
area Marilla Park.[17] Following the 2010 census, Monongalia County (with 
county seat Morgantown) and neighboring Preston County were acknowledged 
as a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) by the United States government. 
Estimates from 2010 put the Metropolitan Statistical Area population at 
129,709; as of July 2013, the estimate was 136,133. Of the 10 largest cities 
in West Virginia, only Morgantown and Martinsburg have shown positive population 
growth since the 2010 census, with Morgantown growing from 29,660 to a 
2012 estimate of 31,000.[21] West Virginia University constitutes 913 acres 
(3.69 km2) of the city and vicinity, and with the fall 2012 enrollment 
added an additional population of 29,707 students. According to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, Morgantown had some of the lowest unemployment rates 
in the United States as of early 2009. As of the census[3] of 2010, there 
were 29,660 people, 11,701 households, and 3,827 families residing in the 
city. The population density was 2,916.4 inhabitants per square mile (1,126.0/km2). 
There were 12,664 housing units at an average density of 1,245.2 per square 
mile (480.8/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 89.7% White, 4.1% African 
American, 0.1% Native American, 3.4% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.6% 
from other races, and 2.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of 
any race were 2.6% of the population. There were 11,701 households of which 
12.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 23.1% were married 
couples living together, 6.5% had a female householder with no husband 
present, 3.1% had a male householder with no wife present, and 67.3% were 
non-families. 36.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.1% 
had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 2.05 and the average family size was 2.71. The median 
age in the city was 22.6 years. 8.2% of residents were under the age of 
18; 52.1% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 18.4% were from 25 to 44; 
13.1% were from 45 to 64; and 8.1% were 65 years of age or older. The gender 
makeup of the city was 53.5% male and 46.5% female. As of the census of 
2000, there were 26,809 people, 10,782 households, and 4,183 families residing 
in the city. The population density was 2,736.0 people per square mile 
(1,056.2/km²). There were 11,721 housing units at an average density of 
1,196.2 per square mile (461.8/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 
89.48% White, 4.15% African American, 0.17% Native American, 4.15% Asian, 
0.05% Pacific Islander, 0.51% from other races, and 1.48% from two or more 
races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.54% of the population. There 
were 10,782 households out of which 15.0% had children under the age of 
18 living with them, 29.1% were married couples living together, 7.0% had 
a female householder with no husband present, and 61.2% were non-families. 
37.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.5% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.08 and the average family size was 2.76. Morgantown's age distribution, 
which is heavily influenced by the presence of West Virginia University, 
is: 11.1% under the age of 18, 44.7% from 18 to 24, 20.4% from 25 to 44, 
13.5% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median 
age was 23 years. For every 100 females there were 104.7 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.0 males. The median income 
for a household in the city was $20,649, and the median income for a family

The per capita income for the city was $14,459. About 15.0% of families 
and 38.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 23.3% 
of those under age 18 and 8.3% of those age 65 or over. The West Virginia 
Black Bears are a minor league baseball team based in Morgantown. The team 
plays in the Pinckney Division of the New York–Penn League, and are affiliated 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Games are played at the Monongalia County 
Ballpark in nearby Granville.[26] The inaugural Morgantown Marathon was 
held in September 2015. The 42.195 km (26.2 mi) course winds through Morgantown's 
seven wards and is characterized by its elevation changes. Official times 
from the Morgantown Marathon can be used for Boston Marathon qualification. 
In addition to the full marathon race, the Morgantown Marathon also includes 
The Mountain Mama 8k and a half-marathon. The city is served by Monongalia 
County Schools. Public elementary schools in Morgantown and its surrounding 
area include Cheat Lake, North, Brookhaven, Ridgedale, Mountainview, Mylan 
Park, Skyview, and Eastwood. There are four middle schools: Mountaineer 
Middle, South, Westwood, and Suncrest.[27] The city's two high schools 
are University High School, the mascot of which is the Hawks, and Morgantown 
High School, whose mascot is the Mohigans. The latter's name is that of 
a non-existent Native American tribe whose name is a combination of the 
words Morgantown (MO) High (HIG) Annual (AN), which was the school's yearbook. 
The Native American mascot and logo were adopted because of the close relation 
to the name Mohican, a real Native American tribe.[28] Notable Morgantown 
High School alumni include screenwriter–film director Lawrence Kasdan (class 
of 1966), actor Don Knotts (class of 1942), college football coach Tommy 
Bowden (class of 1972), and TV college football analyst Terry Bowden (class 
of 1974). As of April 2005, Monongalia County Schools employed 897 professional 
personnel and 490 service personnel, and carries an enrollment of 10,076 
students, including 156 adult students at the Monongalia County Technical 
Education Center. Three of Monongalia County's 23 schools have earned Exemplary 
Achievement status, according to the West Virginia Office of Educational 
Performance Audits' (OEPA) report issued November 2004. In 2004, Suncrest 
Middle became a National Blue Ribbon School for the No Child Left Behind 
Act. Other private schools include: Covenant Christian School, Maranatha 
Christian Academy, Morgantown Christian Academy, Trinity Christian School, 
St. Francis Elementary/Middle School, and the alternative, non-religious 
Morgantown Learning Academy. While informal schools existed from Morgantown's 
earliest days,[29] the town established a one-story, coeducational, Virginia 
common school in July 1803, that students attended on a tuition basis.[30] 
On Nov. 29, 1814, the Virginia General Assembly incorporated Monongalia 
Academy, the county's first public school.[31] Supported by obligatory 
surveyors' fees, the male-only institution was the equivalent of a modern-day 
high school.[32] The Academy moved to a new two-story building in 1830, 
with principal Jonathan Haddock offering courses in geography, surveying, 
and navigation in addition to traditional subjects. Presbyterian minister 
Reverend James Robertson Moore was principal during the Academy's 1852–1864 
heyday, when its enrollment included students from 14 states.[33] In 1867, 
the Academy closed, and donated its land toward the establishment of West 
Virginia University. The Virginia Assembly in March 1831 authorized the 
creation of the Morgantown Female Academy. Proceeds from the sale of the 
original Monongalia Academy building funded construction of a two-story 
school at Bumbo Lane (the modern-day Fayette Street) and Long Alley (the 
modern-day Chestnut Street). This school opened April 1, 1834.[34] After 
the Assembly approved a charter change in 1838, the school became known 
as the Methodist Academy.[35] This prompted local Presbyterians to create 
the Woodburn Female Seminary, for which the Monongalia Academy's Rev. Moore 
also served as principal. The seminary closed in 1866, and its assets, 
like those of the Monongalia Academy, were donated toward the future university. 
Following the 1863 creation of West Virginia, the new state's first legislature 
created a public-school system. The act provided for the education of "free 
colored children", and was adapted three years later to mandate education 
for all African-American children. However, a two-tier system was created: 
White children attended a regular term (at the second former Monongalia 
Academy building, purchased in 1867 from West Virginia Agricultural College, 
the future West Virginia University), only a short term was provided for 
African-Americans, who met at St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church, 
on Beechurst Avenue.[36] In the late 19th and early 20th century, rural 
educational reformer Alexander Wade lived in Morgantown and was involved 
in establishing a system of graded education for country schools that was 
later adopted across the rest of the United States.[37] A Roman Catholic 
elementary school, Saint Francis de Sales, began sometime prior to 1915 
as a two-room school in a house on McLane Avenue in the Seneca neighborhood, 
and run by lay teacher Miss Sterbutsal, who became Sister M. Isabelle of 
the Sisters of St. Joseph. In October 1915, the pastorate of Father Peter 
Flynn arranged for Ursuline nuns from Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1918, 
under principal Sister M. Isadore, the school moved to a new building on 
Beechurst Avenue, adjacent to St. Theresa's Church. On June 9, 1990, the 
grade school moved into the former St. Francis Central High School building,[38] 
and eventually into newly built facility at 41 Guthrie Lane.[39] Its mascot 
is the Trojan.[38] The Beechurst Avenue building was demolished in 2003.[citation 
needed] St. Francis Central High School existed for several decades on 
Birch Street in the Evansdale neighborhood until that campus was taken 
over by the elementary school on June 9, 1990.[38] Its mascot was the Trojans,[citation 
needed] and its football field was named for Father Flynn.[citation needed] 
The West Virginia University Foundation purchased its building and land 
in July 2003, formally selling it to WVU for $11 million in August 2004, 
with the university then announcing it intended to use the football and 
adjacent baseball fields as intramural recreation area.[40] Through January 
2006, the building housed the St. Francis middle and elementary schools.[citation 
needed] WVU is a public land-grant university, founded in 1867. With an 
operating budget of approximately $980 million as of 2015,[41] it also 
has $150 million annually in sponsored contracts and research grants conducted 
by faculty members. Fall 2014 enrollment was 31,976, with students from 
all 55 state counties, 50 states plus the District of Columbia, and 89 
other nations. 2008 Basic figures regarding the student body: The 2015–2016 
curriculum is supported by 15 colleges and schools offering 193 bachelor's, 
master's, doctoral, and professional degree programs in the arts and sciences; 
business and economics; creative arts; engineering and mineral resources; 
human resources and education; journalism; law; agriculture, forestry, 
and consumer sciences; dentistry; medicine; nursing; pharmacy; physical 
education; plus programs at Potomac State College.[43] Morgantown has two 
newspapers. The Dominion Post is a privately owned newspaper which is published 
daily. The university-owned and student-run college newspaper, The Daily 
Athenaeum, is published on weekdays while classes are in session, and is 
provided free of charge on campus and to many businesses around Morgantown. 
There are also other local quasi-newspapers such as the Post Extra and 
the Morgantown Times, which typically feature a few local news stories 
and an abundance of advertisements. Both are free of charge and mass-mailed 
throughout the Morgantown area. Morgantown Municipal Airport is one of 
West Virginia's few commercial airports. It is located approximately 3 
miles (4.8 km) northeast of the downtown along U.S. Route 119. The only 
active rail line near Morgantown is owned by Norfolk Southern with CSX 
trackage rights and serves a mine located northwest of Rivesville, West 
Virginia. Coal is the major commodity, with a train serving local chemical 
industries such as Tanner and Addivant (formerly Chemtura)[44] that require 
tank cars. These are trucked in and then loaded onto high side gondolas 
or bulkhead flat cars. Conrail was split by Norfolk Southern and CSX in 
1999. CSX pays for half of the cost of maintenance for the line. CSX uses 
it mostly to bring trains from Grafton to load at Consol's Bailey Mine 
and for direct access to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Morgantown relies heavily 
on the Monongahela River for shipping coal and other products. The river 
is fully navigable from its mouth at the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, past 
Morgantown upstream to Fairmont. Morgantown Lock and Dam, located in the 
southern part of the city, helps to provide a continuous pool heading upstream 
towards the Hildebrand Lock and Dam, and the Opekiska Lock and Dam. Point 
Marion Lock and Dam, the next downstream dam, is responsible for most of 
the river's pool in Morgantown. Most of Morgantown is accessible by Mountain 
Line Transit Authority bus system.[45] Most service operates Monday-Saturday 
from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a very limited service operating on Sunday during 
the WVU school year. MountainLine's Grey Line bus operates every day of 
the year between Clarksburg, West Virginia and Pittsburgh International 
Airport. Morgantown also has the Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) 
system. The system has five stations (Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, 
and Medical) covering 8.65 miles (13.9 km). Electric service is provided 
by Mon Power, natural gas services by Dominion Resources, and water and 
sewage by the Morgantown Utility Board. Cable television and cable Internet 
are provided by Comcast Communications. Landline telephone and DSL services 
are offered by Frontier Communications (due to a recent acquisition from 
Verizon Communications[46][47][48]), with West Side Telecommunications 
telephone and DSL service available in some areas. Trash pickup in the 
Morgantown area is provided by Republic Services. The City of Morgantown 
has adopted a weekly recycling program, as part of the Clean Community 
Concept,[49] an initiative by the city government. Morgantown is twinned 
with Morgantown established Friendship City relations with Quanshan District, 
Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China, in 2012.[56] The cable television network MTV announced 
in October 2006, that it would tape an eight-episode reality TV series, 
Show Choir, following Morgantown High School's show choir, which performs
