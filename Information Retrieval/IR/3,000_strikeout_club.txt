In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 3,000 strikeout club is the group of 
pitchers who have struck out 3,000 or more batters in their careers. Walter 
Johnson was the first to reach 3,000, doing so in 1923, and was the only 
pitcher at this milestone for 50 years until Bob Gibson recorded his 3,000th 
strikeout in 1974. In total, 16 pitchers have reached 3,000 strikeouts 
with John Smoltz, the most recent club member, joining in 2008.[1] Steve 
Carlton and Randy Johnson are the only left-handed pitchers in this group.[2][3] 
Randy Johnson was the quickest pitcher to 3,000 strikeouts, taking fewer 
games pitched or innings pitched than any other pitcher.[4] César Gerónimo 
is the only player struck out by two different pitchers for their 3,000th 
strikeout, first by Gibson in 1974 and then Nolan Ryan in 1980.[5] The 
Chicago Cubs are one of two franchises to see multiple pitchers record 
their 3,000th strikeout on their roster, first Ferguson Jenkins in 1982 
and then Greg Maddux in 2005. The Minnesota Twins also had two pitchers 
reach the milestone with their team – Walter Johnson joined the club while 
the franchise was called the Washington Senators, then Bert Blyleven joined 
in 1986 with the team in Minnesota. Ten 3,000 strikeout pitchers are also 
members of the 300 win club.[6] Seven pitchers from this club were named 
amongst the one hundred greatest players in MLB history as part of the 
All-Century Team, four of whom were eventually voted as starters for the 
team by fan vote.[7][8] Membership in the 3,000 strikeout club is often 
described as a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[9][10] 
Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, and John Smoltz are the most recently elected 
individuals, all voted in during 2015 balloting.[11] Of the sixteen eligible 
members of the 3,000 strikeout club, fourteen have been elected to the 
Hall. The two who have appeared on a Hall of Fame ballot but have not yet 
been elected, Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling, both made their first appearances 
on the ballot for the 2013 elections. Each received only about half of 
the total votes needed for induction, with Schilling earning slightly more 
votes than Clemens.[12] Clemens' future election is seen as uncertain because 
of his alleged links to use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).[13] 
The current and near-future eligibility of many players linked to PED use, 
combined with voting restrictions in Hall of Fame balloting, has been cited 
as the source of a "backlog" in future Hall elections.[14][15] Eligibility 
requires that a player has "been retired five seasons" or deceased for
