James Michael Wolf (born July 24, 1969) is a Major League Baseball umpire. 
He joined the major league staff in 1999 after working in the Arizona Rookie 
League, the South Atlantic League, the California League, the Texas League 
and the Pacific Coast League.[1] He wears uniform number 28.[2] On October 
4, 2001, Wolf served as third base umpire when Rickey Henderson broke Ty 
Cobb's runs scored record.[3] Wolf drew criticism from ESPN announcers 
after he ejected Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Ted Lilly at the start of 
a game on June 10, 2007 against the Atlanta Braves. Wolf ruled that Lilly 
had intentionally thrown at the batter's head, and immediately ejected 
the pitcher. While such a penalty is uncommon without a formal warning 
to both teams, such action is permitted by baseball's rules.[4] On May 
9, 2010, Wolf was the home plate umpire for Dallas Braden's perfect game. 
His crew also officiated Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game on June 
2, 2010. On July 9, 2011, Wolf was the home plate umpire when Derek Jeter 
got his 3,000th hit against the Tampa Bay Rays. Wolf missed several months 
during the 2013 season due to an apparent back injury. He worked a rehab 
assignment at Triple-ACharlotte the weekend of July 18–19 en route to a 
return to the Major Leagues.[5] On August 2, 2015, Wolf was involved in 
a series of controversial events in a game between the Toronto Blue Jays 
and the Kansas City Royals. According to National Post sportswriter John 
Lott, "Umpire Jim Wolf lost control of the game."[6] The controversy was 
based upon a warning by Wolf to both teams after Blue Jays batter Josh 
Donaldson was struck by a pitch in the first inning by Edinson Vólquez. 
The benches were cleared after a number of pitches could have resulted 
in the Royals' pitcher's ejection, and did not, but a pitch by the Blue 
Jays' relief pitcher Aaron Sanchez that hit Alcides Escobar immediately 
resulted in Sanchez being ejected. Former Blue Jays catcher and current 
Sportsnet baseball analyst Gregg Zaun criticized Wolf for his inability 
to enforce the warning that was issued in the first.[7] Wolf was the right 
field umpire for the single-game playoff to decide the NL's 2007 wild card 
team, has officiated four Division Series (2007, 2010, 2014, 2015), two 
League Championship Series (2011,2016) and one World Series (2015). He 
has also worked one All-Star Game (2010). Wolf is married and resides in 
Ahwatukee, Arizona. His younger brother Randy was a pitcher in the major 
leagues from 1999 until 2015. To avoid a conflict of interest, Jim Wolf 
would be removed from assignments if his crew was assigned to work any
