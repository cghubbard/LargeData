The Carolina League was an "outlaw" professional baseball league in the 
Piedmont region of North Carolina.[1] Drawing from the textile mills and 
milling towns in that region, the league was independent, meaning that 
it was not a part of the National Association of Professional Baseball 
Leagues, the body that governed minor-league baseball during the league's 
lifetime. The Carolina League was the successor to the short-lived 1935 
Carolina Textile League. The league's independent status led to the league 
being branded as an "outlaw" league by supporters of the NAPBL, and the 
league's practice of allowing players to freely leave their contracts to 
play for teams in other leagues, was unorthodox at the time. Additionally, 
players on various teams were often given year-round no-show jobs in the 
team owners' various mills with salaries that supplemented their earnings 
from baseball. There was no cap to salaries for Carolina League players, 
and there were no limits to how many players with professional experience 
could play on any given team, a sharp difference from previous "mill leagues".[2] 
This added incentive caused several players in NABPL leagues to moonlight 
as Carolina League players, often under assumed names. When caught by NABPL 
officials, moonlighting players were often banned from play in NAPBL leagues, 
effectively putting on hold or ending their professional careers. Professional 
players such as Fred Archer and Vince Barton did stints with the Carolina 
League while on hiatus from Major League Baseball.[2] In addition, the 
NAPBL combatted the insurgent influence of the Carolina League by installing 
an eight-team class-D league, the North Carolina State League in towns 
near Carolina League teams. The league folded in 1938 due to pressure from 
"organized" baseball, and many of the league's players went on to play 
in NABPL leagues, with some, such as Dick Culler and Grey Clarke going 
on to achieve prominence in the major leagues.[2] The following teams were
