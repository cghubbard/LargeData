Hideki Irabu (伊良部 秀輝, Irabu Hideki?, May 5, 1969 – July 24, 2011) was a 
Japanese professional baseball player of Japanese and American mixed ancestry. 
He played professionally in both Japan and the United States. He joined 
New York Yankees to much fanfare, but his career struggled. He died in 
2011 of an apparent suicide. Irabu was born on May 5, 1969 in Hirara (present: 
Miyakojima),[1] Okinawa, Japan then administered by the government of the 
United States. His father was an American service member whom Hideki never 
knew. Hideki's mother, Kazue, a native of Miyako, later married a restaurateur, 
Ichiro Irabu, from Osaka. Irabu raised Hideki as his son in Amagasaki, 
Hyōgo Prefecture.[2][3] Irabu pitched for the Lotte Orions, who later became 
the Chiba Lotte Marines, of the Pacific League from 1988 to 1996. He was 
known as a high-speed pitcher and in 1993, he threw a 158 km/h (98 mph) 
fastball against Kazuhiro Kiyohara of the Seibu Lions. This was the fastest 
clocked pitch in all of Japanese Professional Baseball (NPB) until 2005, 
when the record was broken by Marc Kroon of the Yokohama BayStars. It remains 
the Pacific League record.[4][5] Irabu led the Pacific League in wins in 
1994 (15) and in ERA in 1995 and 1996 (2.53 and 2.40, respectively). He 
also led the Pacific League in strikeouts in 1994 and 1995 (239, 239, and 
167 respectively).[6] In 1997, the San Diego Padres purchased his contract 
from the Chiba Lotte Marines. The criticisms of this sale from other MLB 
teams, who wished to bid on Irabu, led to the creation of the posting system 
currently used by Japanese and MLB teams.[7] Irabu, however, refused to 
sign with the Padres, saying he would only play with the Yankees. For the 
negotiating rights to Irabu, the Yankees offered the Padres a choice of 
one from a list of players including Brian Boehringer, David Weathers, 
Chris Cumberland, Andy Fox, and Matt Luke. The Padres would eventually 
include him as a player-to-be-named-later in a trade that involved Homer 
Bush and Irabu going to the New York Yankees in exchange for Rafael Medina, 
Rubén Rivera, and $3 million in cash.[8] The Yankees signed him to a $12.8 
million, four-year contract, and after only eight minor league games, the 
Yankees put him in their rotation.[9] Irabu made his highly publicized 
debut on July 10, 1997, drawing almost twice as many fans that night as 
they averaged for weeknight games.[10] He played with the Yankees from 
1997 through 1999, winning two World Series rings (1998, 1999) despite 
only pitching in one postseason game and having no postseason decisions. 
George Steinbrenner publicly expressed disgust at his weight, at one point 
calling him a "fat pussy[11] toad" after he failed to cover first base 
on a ground ball during a spring training game. Steinbrenner refused to 
let Irabu accompany the team to Los Angeles, but two days later, Steinbrenner 
apologized and allowed Irabu to join the team.[12] 1998 was Irabu's best 
season in MLB, featuring career bests in games started (28), complete games 
(2), innings pitched (173), wins (13), and ERA (4.06).[13] After the 1999 
season, he was traded to the Montreal Expos for Ted Lilly, Christian Parker, 
and Jake Westbrook.[1] He started only 14 games for the Expos in 2000 and 
2001, pitching 71⅓ innings with a 6.69 ERA and only 2 wins against 7 losses.[13] 
In 2002, he signed as a free agent to pitch for the Texas Rangers as a 
closer.[13] At the end of the year, Irabu moved back to Japan to pitch 
in the Hanshin Tigers' starting rotation for the 2003 season, helping the 
team win the Central League pennant for the first time since 1985. When 
Major League Baseball opened its 2004 season in Tokyo, he pitched against 
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Over the course of six MLB seasons, Irabu's career 
totals are 126 games, 514 innings, 34 wins, 35 losses, 16 saves, 405 strikeouts, 
and a 5.15 ERA.[13] His Japanese totals for eleven seasons are 273 games, 
1,286 1⁄3 innings, 72 wins, 69 losses, 11 saves, 1,282 strikeouts, and 
a 3.55 ERA. In April 2009, Irabu had come out of retirement and made a 
contract with Long Beach Armada of the independent Golden Baseball League. 
He posted a 5–3 record in 10 starts, with an ERA of 3.58. In 65 innings 
Irabu struck out 66 batters while walking just 19. In August, he announced 
his intention to return to the Japanese professional leagues,[14] and began 
playing for the semi-professional Kōchi Fighting Dogs.[3] On August 20, 
2008, Irabu was arrested on the suspicion of assaulting the manager of 
a bar in Umeda, Osaka. He was upset that his credit card was not accepted 
in the bar. At the time of the suspected assault, Irabu had consumed at 
least 20 glasses of beer. Irabu admitted to the assault, the bartender 
sustained no injuries, and Irabu paid the bill with another credit card.[15] 
Irabu was arrested for DUI on May 17, 2010, in Redondo Beach, California.[16] 
The press release of his arrest states he resided at the time in Rancho 
Palos Verdes.[17] Irabu was found dead in his home in Los Angeles on July 
27, 2011, in an apparent suicide. He was reported to have hanged himself.[18] 
He left behind his wife and two children.[19] Irabu's autopsy showed he 
was inebriated at the time of his death. He was reportedly despondent because
