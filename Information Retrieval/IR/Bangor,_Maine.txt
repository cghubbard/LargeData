Bangor (/ˈbæŋɡɔːr/ BANG-gor) is a city along the Penobscot River in the 
U.S. state of Maine. The city proper has a population of 33,039, while 
the Bangor metropolitan area has a population of 153,746. Modern Bangor 
was established by European Americans in the mid-1800s, based on the lumber 
and shipbuilding industries. As the city was located on the Penobscot River, 
logs could be floated downstream from the Maine North Woods and processed 
at the city's water-powered sawmills, then shipped from Bangor's port to 
the Atlantic Ocean 30 miles downstream, and from there to any port in the 
world. With their wealth, the lumber barons built elaborate Greek Revival 
and Victorian mansions and the 31-foot high statue of Paul Bunyan. Today, 
Bangor's economy is based on services and retail, healthcare, and education. 
Founded as Condeskeag Plantation, Bangor was incorporated as a New England 
town in 1791, after the end of the American Revolutionary War. There are 
more than 20 communities worldwide named Bangor, of which 15 are in the 
United States and named after Bangor, Maine by settlers in other areas. 
The reason for the choice of name is disputed[6] but it was likely either 
from the eponymous Welsh hymn or from either of two places of that name 
in the British Isles: Wales and Northern Ireland, from where many immigrants 
traveled to the United States.[7] The final syllable is pronounced gor, 
not ger. In 2015, local public officials, journalists, doctors, policemen, 
photographers, restaurateurs, TV personalities and Grammy-winning composers 
came together to record the YouTube video How To Say Bangor.[8] Bangor 
has a port of entry at Bangor International Airport, also home to the Bangor 
Air National Guard Base. Historically Bangor was an important stopover 
on the great circle route air route between the U.S. East Coast and Europe. 
Bangor has a humid continental climate, with cold, snowy winters, and warm 
summers. The Penobscot people have inhabited the area around present-day 
Bangor for at least 11,000 years[9] and still occupy tribal land on the 
nearby Penobscot Indian Island Reservation. They practiced some agriculture, 
but less than peoples in southern New England where the climate is milder,[10] 
and subsisted on what they could hunt and gather.[11] Contact with Europeans 
was not uncommon during the 1500s because the fur trade was lucrative and 
the Penobscot were willing to trade pelts for European goods. The site 
was visited by Portuguese explorer Estêvão Gomes in 1524 and by Samuel 
de Champlain in 1605.[12] The Jesuits established a mission on Penobscot 
Bay in 1609, which was then part of the French colony of Acadia, and the 
valley remained contested between France and Britain into the 1750s, making 
it one of the last regions to become part of New England. In 1769 Jacob 
Buswell founded a settlement at the site. By 1772, there were 12 families, 
along with a sawmill, store, and school, and in 1787 the population was 
567. In September 1787 a petition, signed by 19 residents, was sent to 
the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts requesting that 
this designated area be named Sunbury. On the back of it was written "To 
the care of Dr. Cony, Hallowell". This petition was rejected before 6 October 
1788, as the town referred to itself as Penobscot River, west side.[13] 
In 1779, the rebel Penobscot Expedition fled up the Penobscot River and 
ten of its ships were scuttled by the British fleet at Bangor. The ships 
remained there until the late 1950s, when construction of the Joshua Chamberlain 
Bridge disturbed the site. Six cannons were removed from the riverbed; 
five of which are on display throughout the region (one was thrown back 
into the river by area residents angered that the archeological site was 
destroyed for the bridge construction).[6] In 1790, the Kenduskeag Plantation 
could no longer defer incorporation from the General Court of Massachusetts 
and in June Rev. Seth Noble hand delivered the petition for incorporation 
to the State House in Boston. He left the name for the town blank so he 
could obtain tentative approval. He chose the name of a popular hymn known 
to be a favorite of Governor John Hancock. He then wrote in Bangor. The 
incorporation was received on 25 February 1791 and was signed by John Hancock.[13] 
During the War of 1812, Bangor and Hampden were looted by the British. 
Maine was part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts until 1820, when it 
voted to secede from the state and was admitted to the Union under the 
Missouri Compromise as the 23rd state. Bangor was near the lands disputed 
during the Aroostook War, a boundary dispute with Britain in 1838–39. The 
passion of the Aroostook War signaled the increasing role lumbering and 
logging were playing in the Maine economy, particularly in the central 
and eastern sections of the state. Bangor arose as a lumbering boom-town 
in the 1830s, and a potential demographic and political rival to Portland, 
Maine. For a time, Bangor was the largest lumber port in the world, and 
the site of furious land speculation that extended up the Penobscot River 
valley and beyond.[14] In 1861, after the outbreak of the American Civil 
War, a Unionist mob attacked and ransacked the offices of the Democratic 
newspaper the Bangor Daily Union. they threw the presses and other materials 
thrown into the street and burned. Editor Marcellus Emery escaped unharmed. 
He did not resume publishing until after the end of the War.[15] During 
the American Civil War, the locally mustered 2nd Maine Volunteer Infantry 
Regiment was the first to march out of Maine in 1861. It played a prominent 
part in the First Battle of Bull Run. The 1st Maine Heavy Artillery Regiment, 
mustered in Bangor and commanded by a local merchant, lost more men than 
any other Union regiment in the war (especially in the Second Battle of 
Petersburg, 1864). The 20th Maine Infantry Regiment held Little Round Top 
in the Battle of Gettysburg. A bridge connecting Bangor with Brewer is 
named for Chamberlain, the regiment's leader, who was one of eight Civil 
War soldiers from Penobscot County towns to receive the Congressional Medal 
of Honor.[16] Bangor's Charles A. Boutelle accepted the surrender of the 
Confederate fleet after the Battle of Mobile Bay. A Bangor residential 
street is named for him. A number of Bangor ships were captured on the 
high seas by Confederate raiders in the Civil War, including the Delphine, 
James Littlefield, Mary E. Thompson and Golden Rocket.[17] The Penobscot 
River Maine North Woods drainage basin above Bangor was unattractive to 
settlement for farming, but well suited to lumbering. Winter snow allowed 
logs to be dragged from the woods by horse-teams. Carried to the Penobscot 
or its tributaries, log driving in the snowmelt brought them to waterfall-powered 
sawmills upriver from Bangor. The sawn lumber was then shipped from the 
city's docks, Bangor being at the head-of-tide (between the rapids and 
the ocean) to points anywhere in the world. Shipbuilding was also developed.[18] 
Bangor capitalists also owned most of the forests. The main markets for 
Bangor lumber were the East Coast cities. Much was also shipped to the 
Caribbean and to California during the Gold Rush, via Cape Horn, before 
sawmills could be established in the west. Bangorians subsequently helped 
transplant the Maine culture of lumbering to the Pacific Northwest, and 
participated directly in the Gold Rush themselves. Bangor, Washington; 
Bangor, California; and Little Bangor, Nevada, are legacies of this contact.[18] 
By 1860, Bangor was the world's largest lumber port, with 150 sawmills 
operating along the river. The city shipped over 150 million boardfeet 
of lumber a year, much of it in Bangor-built and Bangor-owned ships. In 
the year 1860, 3,300 lumbering ships passed by the docks.[6] Many of the 
lumber barons built elaborate Greek Revival and Victorian houses that still 
stand in the Broadway Historic District. Bangor has many substantial old 
churches, and shade trees. The city was so beautiful it was called "The 
Queen City of the East." The shorter Queen City appellation is still used 
by some local clubs, organizations, events and businesses.[19] In addition 
to shipping lumber, 19th-century Bangor was the leading producer of moccasins, 
shipping over 100,000 pairs a year by the 1880s.[20] Exports also included 
bricks, leather, and even ice (which was cut and stored in winter, then 
shipped to Boston, and even China, the West Indies and South America).[6] 
Bangor had certain disadvantages compared to other East Coast ports, including 
its rival Portland, Maine. Being on a northern river, its port froze during 
the winter, and it could not take the largest ocean-going ships. The comparative 
lack of settlement in the forested hinterland also gave it a comparatively 
small home market.[21] In 1844 the first ocean-going iron-hulled steamship 
in the U.S. was named The Bangor. She was built by the Harlan and Hollingsworth 
firm of Wilmington, Delaware in 1844, and was intended to take passengers 
between Bangor and Boston. On her second voyage, however, in 1845, she 
burned to the waterline off Castine. She was rebuilt at Bath, returned 
briefly to her earlier route, but was soon purchased by the U.S. government 
for use in the Mexican–American War.[22] Bangor continued to prosper as 
the pulp and paper industry replaced lumbering, and railroads replaced 
shipping.[23] Local capitalists also invested in a train route to Aroostook 
County in northern Maine (the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad), opening that 
area to settlement. Bangor's Hinkley & Egery Ironworks (later Union Ironworks) 
was a local center for invention in the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
A new type of steam engine built there, named the "Endeavor", won a Gold 
Medal at the New York Crystal Palace Exhibition of the American Institute 
in 1856. The firm won a diploma for a shingle-making machine the following 
year.[24] In the 1920s, Union Iron Works engineer Don A. Sargent invented 
the first automotive snow plow. Sargent patented the device and the firm 
manufactured it for a national market.[25] Bangor is located at 44°48′13″N 
68°46′13″W﻿ / ﻿44.80361°N 68.77028°W﻿ / 44.80361; -68.77028 (44.803, −68.770).[26] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area 
of 34.59 square miles (89.59 km2), of which 34.26 square miles (88.73 km2) 
is land and 0.33 square miles (0.85 km2) is water.[2] A potential advantage 
that has always eluded exploitation is the city's location between the 
port city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the rest of Canada (as well as New 
York). As early as the 1870s, the city promoted a Halifax-to-New York railroad, 
via Bangor, as the quickest connection between North America and Europe 
(when combined with steamship service between Britain and Halifax). A European 
and North American Railway was actually opened through Bangor, with President 
Ulysses S. Grant officiating at the inauguration, but commerce never lived 
up to the potential. More recent attempts to capture traffic between Halifax 
and Montreal by constructing an East–West Highway through Maine have also 
come to naught. Most overland traffic between the two parts of Canada continues 
to travel north of Maine rather than across it.[27] The destruction of 
downtown landmarks such as the old city hall and train station in the late 
1960s Urban Renewal Program is now considered to have been a huge planning 
mistake. It ushered in a decline of the city center that was accelerated 
by the construction of the Bangor Mall in 1978 and subsequent big-box stores 
on the city's outskirts.[32] Downtown Bangor began to recover in the 1990s, 
with bookstores, cafe/restaurants, galleries, and museums filling once-vacant 
storefronts. The recent re-development of the city's waterfront has also 
helped re-focus cultural life in the historic center.[33] Bangor is on 
the banks of the Penobscot River, close enough to the Atlantic Ocean to 
be influenced by tides. Upstream, the Penobscot River drainage basin occupies 
8,570 square miles in northeastern Maine. Flooding is most often caused 
by a combination of precipitation and snowmelt. Ice jams can exacerbate 
high flow conditions and cause acute localized flooding. Conditions favorable 
for flooding typically occur during the spring months.[34] In 1807 an ice 
jam formed below Bangor Village raising the water 10 to 12 feet above the 
normal highwater mark[35] and in 1887 the freshet caused the Maine Central 
Railroad Company rails between Bangor and Vanceboro to be covered to a 
depth of several feet.[35] Bangor’s worst ice jam floods occurred in 1846 
and 1902. Both resulted from mid-December freshets that cleared the upper 
river of ice, followed by cold that produced large volumes of frazil ice 
or slush which was carried by high flows forming a major ice jam in the 
lower river. In March of both years, a dynamic breakup of ice ran into 
the jam and flooded downtown Bangor. Though no lives were lost and the 
city recovered quickly, the 1846 and 1902 ice jam floods were economically 
devastating, according to the Army Corps analysis. Both floods occurred 
with multiple dams in place and little to no ice-breaking in the lower 
river. The United States Coast Guard began icebreaker operations on the 
Penobscot in the 1940s, preventing the formation of frozen ice jams during 
the winter and providing an unobstructed path for ice-out in the spring.[36] 
Long-term temperature records show a gradual warming since 1894, which 
may have reduced the ice jam flood potential at Bangor. In the Groundhog 
Day gale of 1976 a storm surge went up the Penobscot, flooding Bangor for 
three hours.[37] At 11:15 am, waters began rising on the river and within 
15 minutes had risen a total of 3.7 metres (12 ft) flooding downtown. About 
200 cars were submerged and office workers were stranded until waters receded. 
There were no reported deaths during this unusual flash flood.[38] Bangor 
has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb), with cold, snowy winters, 
and warm summers, and is located in USDA hardiness zone 5a.[39] The monthly 
daily average temperature ranges from 17.0 °F (−8.3 °C) in January to 68.5 °F 
(20.3 °C) in July.[40] On average, there are 21 nights annually that drop 
to 0 °F (−18 °C) or below, and 57 days where the temperature stays below 
freezing, including 49 days from December through February.[40] There is 
an average of 5.3 days annually with highs at or above 90 °F (32 °C), with 
the last year to have not seen such temperatures being 2014.[40] Extreme 
temperatures range from −32 °F (−36 °C) on February 10, 1948 up to 104 °F 
(40 °C) on August 19, 1935.[40] The average first freeze of the season 
occurs on October 7, and the last May 7, resulting in a freeze-free season 
of 152 days; the corresponding dates for measurable snowfall, i.e. at least 
0.1 in (0.25 cm), are November 23 and April 4.[40] The average seasonal 
snowfall for Bangor is approximately 66 inches (170 cm), while snowfall 
has ranged from 22.2 inches (56 cm) in 1979–80 to 181.9 inches (4.62 m) 
in 1962−63; the record snowiest month was February 1969 with 58.0 inches 
(147 cm), while the most snow in one calendar day was 30.0 inches (76 cm) 
on December 14, 1927.[40] Measurable snow occurs in May occurs about one-fourth 
of all years, while it has occurred just once (1991) in September.[40] 
A snow depth of at least 3 in (7.6 cm) is on average seen 66 days per winter, 
including 54 days from January to March, when the snow pack is typically 
most reliable. As of 2008, Bangor is the third most populous city in Maine, 
as it has been for more than a century. As of 2012, the estimated population 
of the Bangor Metropolitan Area (which includes Penobscot County) is 153,746, 
indicating a slight growth rate since 2000, almost all of it accounted 
for by Bangor.[43] As of 2007, Metro Bangor had a higher percentage of 
people with high school degrees than the national average (85% compared 
to 76.5%) and a slightly higher number of graduate degree holders (7.55% 
compared to 7.16%). It had much higher number of physicians per capita 
(291 vs. 170), because of the presence of two large hospitals[44] Historically 
Bangor received many immigrants as it industrialized. Irish-Catholic and 
later Jewish immigrants eventually became established members of the community, 
along with many migrants from Atlantic Canada. Of 205 black citizens who 
lived in Bangor in 1910, over a third were originally from Canada.[45] 
As of the census[3] of 2010, there were 33,039 people, 14,475 households, 
and 7,182 families residing in the city. The population density was 964.4 
inhabitants per square mile (372.4/km2). There were 15,674 housing units 
at an average density of 457.5 per square mile (176.6/km2). The racial 
makeup of the city was 93.1% White, 1.7% African American, 1.2% Native 
American, 1.7% Asian, 0.3% from other races, and 2.0% from two or more 
races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.5% of the population. There 
were 14,475 households of which 24.2% had children under the age of 18 
living with them, 32.8% were married couples living together, 12.6% had 
a female householder with no husband present, 4.2% had a male householder 
with no wife present, and 50.4% were non-families. 37.9% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 12.4% had someone living alone who was 
65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.10 and the average 
family size was 2.76. The median age in the city was 36.7 years. 17.8% 
of residents were under the age of 18; 16% were between the ages of 18 
and 24; 26% were from 25 to 44; 25.8% were from 45 to 64; and 14.4% were 
65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.2% male 
and 51.8% female. Major employers in the region include:[46] Bangor is 
the largest market town, distribution center, transportation hub, and media 
center in a five-county area whose population tops 330,000 and which includes 
Penobscot, Piscataquis, Hancock, Aroostook, and Washington counties. Bangor's 
City Council has approved a resolution opposing the sale of sweat-shop-produced 
clothing in local stores.[49] Outdoor activities in the Bangor City Forest 
and other nearby parks, forests, and waterways include hiking, sailing, 
canoeing, hunting, fishing, skiing, and snowmobiling. Bangor Raceway at 
the Bass Park Civic Center and Auditorium offers live, pari-mutuel harness 
racing from May through July and then briefly in the fall. Hollywood Slots, 
operated by Penn National Gaming, is a slot machine facility. In 2007, 
construction began on a $131-million casino complex in Bangor that houses, 
among other things, a gambling floor with about 1,000 slot machines, an 
off-track betting center, a seven-story hotel, and a four-level parking 
garage. In 2011, it was authorized to add table games. Bangor Air National 
Guard Base is a United States Air National Guard base. Created in 1927 
as a commercial field, it was taken over by the U.S. Army just before World 
War II. In 1968, the base was sold to the city of Bangor, Maine, to become 
Bangor International Airport but has since continued to host the 101st 
Air Refueling Wing, Maine Air National Guard, part of the Northeast Tanker 
Task Force. In 1990, the USAF East Coast Radar System (ECRS) Operation 
Center was activated in Bangor with over 400 personnel. The center controlled 
the over-the-horizon radar's transmitter in Moscow, Maine, and receiver 
in Columbia Falls, Maine. With the end of the Cold War, the facility's 
mission of guarding against a Soviet air attack became superfluous, and 
though it briefly turned its attention toward drug interdiction, the system 
was decommissioned in 1997 as the SSPARS system installation—the successor 
to the PAVE PAWS installation—in Massachusetts' Cape Cod Air Force Station 
reservation fully took over. Many buildings and monuments are listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places. The city has also had a municipal 
Historic Preservation Commission since the early 1980s.[51] Bangor contains 
many Greek Revival. Victorian, and Colonial Revival houses. Some notable 
architecture: The bow-plate of the battleship USS Maine, whose destruction 
in Havana, Cuba, presaged the start of the Spanish–American War, survives 
on a granite memorial by Charles Eugene Tefft in Davenport Park. Bangor 
has a large fiberglass-over-metal statue of mythical lumberman Paul Bunyan 
by Normand Martin (1959). There are three large bronze statues in downtown 
Bangor by sculptor Charles Eugene Tefft of Brewer, including the Luther 
H. Peirce Memorial, commemorating the Penobscot River Log-Drivers; a statue 
of Hannibal Hamlin at Kenduskeag Mall; and an image of "Lady Victory" at 
Norumbega Parkway. The abstract aluminum sculpture "Continuity of Community" 
(1969) on the Bangor Waterfront, formerly in West Market Square, is by 
the Castine sculptor Clark Battle Fitz-Gerald. The U.S. Post Office in 
Bangor contains Yvonne Jacquette's 1980 three-part mural "Autumn Expansion". 
A 1962 bronze commemorating the 2nd Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment by 
Wisconsin sculptor Owen Vernon Shaffer stands at the entrance to Mt. Hope 
Cemetery. Since 2002, Bangor has been home to Little League International's 
Senior League World Series. Bangor was home to two minor league baseball 
teams affiliated with the 1995-98 Northeast League: the Bangor Blue Ox 
(1996–97) and the Bangor Lumberjacks (2003–04). Even earlier the Bangor 
Millionaires (1894–96) played in the New England League. Vince McMahon 
promoted his first professional wrestling event in Bangor in 1979. In 1985, 
the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship changed hands for the first 
time outside of Puerto Rico at an IWCCW show in Bangor.[54] The Penobscot 
is a salmon-fishing river; the Penobscot Salmon Club traditionally sent 
the first fish caught to the President of the United States. From 1999 
to 2006, low fish stocks resulted in a ban on salmon fishing. Today, the 
wild salmon population (and the sport) is slowly recovering. The Penobscot 
River Restoration Project is working to help the fish population by removing 
some dams north of Bangor.[55] The Kenduskeag Stream Canoe Race, a white-water 
event which begins just north of Bangor in Kenduskeag, has been held since 
1965. Bangor is the county seat of Penobscot County. Since 1931, Bangor 
has had a Council-Manager form of government. The nine-member City Council 
is a non-partisan body, with three city councilors elected to three-year 
terms each year. The nine council members elect the Chair of the City Council, 
who is referred to informally as the mayor, and plays the role when there 
is a ceremonial need. In 2007, Bangor was the first city in the U.S. to 
ban smoking in vehicles carrying passengers under the age of 18.[56] In 
2012, Bangor's City Council passed an order in support of same-sex marriage 
in Maine. In 2013, the City of Bangor also signed an amicus brief to the 
United States Supreme Court calling for the federal Defense of Marriage 
Act to be struck down.[57] Voter registration In 2008 Bangor's crime rate 
was the second-lowest among American metropolitan areas of comparable size.[59] 
As of 2014 Bangor had the third highest rate of property crime in Maine.[60] 
The arrival of Irish immigrants from nearby Canada beginning in the 1830s, 
and their competition with locals for jobs, sparked a deadly sectarian 
riot in 1833 that lasted for days and had to be put down by militia. Realizing 
the need for a police force, the town incorporated as The City of Bangor 
in 1834.[61] In the 1800s, sailors and loggers gave the city a reputation 
for roughness; their stomping grounds were known as the "Devil's Half Acre".[62] 
The same name was also applied, at roughly the same time, to The Devil's 
Half-Acre, Pennsylvania. Although Maine was the first "dry" state (i.e. 
the first to prohibit the sale of alcohol, with the passage of the "Maine 
law" in 1851), Bangor managed to remain "wet". The city had 142 saloons 
in 1890. A look-the-other-way attitude by local police and politicians 
(sustained by a system of bribery in the form of ritualized fine-payments 
known as "The Bangor Plan") allowed Bangor to flout the nation's most long-standing 
state prohibition law.[63] In 1913, the war of the "drys" (prohibitionists) 
on "wet" Bangor escalated when the Penobscot County Sheriff was impeached 
and removed by the Maine Legislature for not enforcing anti-liquor laws. 
His successor was asked to resign by the Governor the following year for 
the same reason, but refused. A third sheriff was removed by the Governor 
in 1918, but promptly re-nominated by the Democratic Party. Prohibitionist 
Carrie Nation had been forcibly expelled from the Bangor House hotel in 
1902 after causing a disturbance.[64] In October 1937, "public enemy" Al 
Brady and another member of his "Brady Gang" (Clarence Shaffer) were killed 
in the bloodiest shootout in Maine's history. FBI agents ambushed Brady, 
Shaffer, and James Dalhover on Bangor's Central Street after they had attempted 
to purchase a Thompson submachinegun from Dakin's Sporting Goods downtown.[65] 
Brady is buried in the public section of Mount Hope Cemetery, on the north 
side of Mount Hope Avenue.[66] Until recently, Brady's grave was unmarked. 
A group of schoolchildren erected a wooden marker over his grave in the 
1990s, which was replaced by a more permanent stone in 2007.[67] Newspapers 
have been published in Bangor since 1815. Almost thirty dailies, weeklies, 
and monthlies had been launched there by the end of the American Civil 
War.[15] The Bangor Daily News was founded in the late 1800s, and is one 
of the few remaining family-owned newspapers left in the United States. 
The Maine Edge is published from Bangor. Bangor has more than a dozen radio 
stations and seven TV stations, including WLBZ, WABI-TV, WABI-DT2), WVII, 
WBGR-LP, and WFVX-LD. Maine Public Broadcasting Network, licensed to Orono, 
is the area's Public Broadcasting Service station. Radio stations in the 
city include WKIT-FM and WZON. WHSN is a non-commercial alternative rock 
station licensed to Bangor and run and operated by staff and students at 
the New England School of Communications at Husson University. Bangor sits 
along interstates I-95 and I-395; U.S. highways US 1A, US 2, US Route 2A; 
and state routes SR 9, SR 15, SR 15 Business, SR 100, SR 202, and SR 222. 
Three major bridges connect the city to neighboring Brewer: Joshua Chamberlain 
Bridge (carrying US 1A), Penobscot River Bridge (carrying SR 15), and the 
Veterans Remembrance Bridge (carrying I-395). Daily intercity bus service 
from Bangor proper is provided by two companies. Concord Coach Lines connects 
Bangor with Augusta, Portland, several towns in Maine's midcoast region, 
and Boston, Massachusetts. Cyr Bus Lines provides daily service to Caribou 
and several northern Maine towns along I-95 and Route 1.[70] The area is 
also served by Greyhound, which operates out of Dysart's Truck Stop in 
neighboring Hermon. West's Bus Service provides service between Bangor 
and Calais.[71] In 2011, Acadian Lines ended bus service to Saint John, 
New Brunswick, because of low ticket sales.[72] The BAT Community Connector 
system offers public transportation within Bangor and to adjacent towns 
such as Orono. There is also a seasonal (summer) shuttle between Bangor 
and Bar Harbor. Freight service is provided by Pan Am Railways. Passenger 
rail service was provided most recently by the New Brunswick Southern Railway, 
which in 1994 discontinued its route to Saint John, New Brunswick. Rail 
accidents: Bangor International Airport (IATA: BGR, ICAO: KBGR) is a joint 
civil-military public airport on the west side of the city. It has a single 
runway measuring 11,439 by 200 ft (3,487 by 61 m). Bangor is the last (or 
first) American airport along the great circle route between the U.S. East 
Coast and Europe, and in the 1970s and '80s it was a refuelling stop, until 
the development of longer-range jets in the 1990s.[27] Bangor is home to 
two large hospitals, the Eastern Maine Medical Center and the Catholic-affiliated 
St. Joseph Hospital. As of 2012, the Bangor Metropolitan Statistical Area

Brunswick (part of the Second cholera pandemic) sent as many as eight hundred 
poor Irish immigrants walking to Bangor. This was the beginning of Maine's 
first substantial Irish-Catholic community. Competition with Yankees for 
jobs caused a riot and resulting fire in 1833.[61] n In 1849-50 the Second 
cholera pandemic reached Bangor itself, killing 20–30 within the first 
week.[78] 112 had died by Oct, 1849 [79] The final death toll was 161.

in most cases were poor Irish immigrants.[80] In 1872 a smallpox epidemic 
closed local schools.* 1918: The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, which was
