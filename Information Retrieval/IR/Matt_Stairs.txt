Matthew Wade Stairs (born February 27, 1968) is a Canadian former professional 
baseball outfielder, first baseman, and designated hitter, who holds the 
record for most pinch-hit home runs in Major League Baseball (MLB) history 
with 23.[1] His pinch-hit home run in the eighth inning of Game 4 in the 
2008 National League Championship Series off the Los Angeles Dodgers reliever 
Jonathan Broxton was called "one of the most memorable home runs in Phillies 
history".[2] In November 2016, he was hired by the Philadelphia Phillies 
to be their hitting coach. In his career, Stairs played for more teams 
than any position player in MLB history (12 (technically 13 teams but 12 
franchises as he played for the Montreal Expos and Washington Nationals); 
Octavio Dotel holds the record for pitchers and all players at 13).[3] 
He was the second Canadian-born player ever to hit more than thirty-five 
home runs in a season and only the second to hit more than 25 home runs 
and drive in more than 100 runs in back-to-back seasons. He ranks either 
first or second in power hitting categories for Canadian major leaguers. 
Stairs also holds the all-time MLB record of home runs hit as a pinch-hitter 
with 23. His ability to pinch hit has made him a valuable asset to several 
teams and earned him the nickname "Matt Stairs – Professional Hitter". 
Stairs, Larry Walker, Justin Morneau, Jason Bay and Joey Votto are the 
only Canadian MLB players to hit at least 200 career home runs.[4] On February 
4, 2015, Stairs was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.[5] Growing 
up in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Stairs showed athletic ability at an 
early age, playing Beaver League baseball a year before his age eligibility 
and excelling in hockey. After playing Bantam & Midget baseball, at age 
16 and 17, he played for the local Marysville Royals of the New Brunswick 
Senior Baseball League and was voted "Rookie of The Year" in 1984 and the 
league's Most Valuable Player in 1985. He was also named Nova Scotia Senior 
Baseball League MVP in 1987 and '88 while playing for the Fredericton Schooners. 
He attended the National Baseball Institute (NBI) in Vancouver, British 
Columbia for one year and played for Canada at the 1987 World Amateur Championships 
in Italy where he was named to the "World All-Star" team. In 1988, he joined 
the Canadian Junior National team after graduating from Fredericton High 
School. From there he went on to play for the Canadian Olympic Team at 
the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. On January 17, 1989, Stairs 
was signed as an international free agent by the Montreal Expos. Stairs 
was then assigned to low single-A Jamestown Expos where he played second 
and third base. He played Double-A ball in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania for 
the Harrisburg Senators where he led the league in hitting and was voted 
the Eastern League's 1991 Most Valuable Player. In 1992 and 1993, he moved 
up to Triple-A (Indianapolis and Ottawa, respectively), with only brief 
appearances in the majors. Over his career, Stairs has played for six other 
minor league teams: The Indianapolis Indians (Triple-A) in 1992, the Ottawa 
Lynx (Triple-A) in 1993, the New Britain Red Sox (Double-A) in 1994, the 
Pawtucket Red Sox (Triple-A) in 1995, the Edmonton Trappers (Triple-A) 
in 1996 and a few rehab games for the Nashville Sounds (Triple-A) in 2003. 
His totals in the minors include a .291 batting average with 46 home runs 
and 237 RBI.[6] On June 8, 1993, Stairs's contract was purchased by the 
Chunichi Dragons of the NPB. He played 60 games for the Dragons that season, 
hitting .250, with 6 home runs in 142 at bats. Stairs began his Major League 
career in 1992 with the Montreal Expos, with whom he played sporadically 
throughout the season. On December 15, 1993, he was re-signed as a free 
agent by Montreal. He ended up only playing in 19 games for the Expos from 
1992 to 1993. He was sold on February 18, 1994 to the Boston Red Sox and 
assigned to Double-A New Britain for the 1994 season. He started the 1995 
season with the Pawtucket farm club until being called up to the major 
leagues in June 1995. He played in 39 games for the Red Sox, hitting .261 
with 1 HR and 17 RBI. At the end of the season, he accepted an offer to 
play with the Oakland Athletics after becoming a free agent. Stairs had 
the best years of his career playing for the Athletics. He was called up 
from Triple-A Edmonton in 1996, after crushing International League pitching 
to a tune of a .344 average with 8 homeruns and 41 RBI over the first 51 
games. In 1998, he finished 17th in the American League in the MVP race 
with a .258 batting average, 38 home runs and 102 RBI. He played mostly 
in right field and as a designated hitter, alongside superstars Rickey 
Henderson, Mark McGwire, and Jose Canseco, throughout his tenure in Oakland. 
In his July 5, 1996 debut with Oakland, Stairs tied a major league record 
with six runs batted in during one inning. That first inning performance 
included a grand slam and a two-run single.[7] (subsequently broken by 
Fernando Tatís in 1999). In 1998, he finished 17th in the American League 
in the MVP race with a .258 batting average, 38 home runs and 102 RBI. 
After five seasons with the Athletics, during which he hit 122 home runs 
and drove in 315 RBI, he was traded on November 20, 2000 to the Chicago 
Cubs for minor league pitcher Eric Ireland. The trade was largely seen 
as a cost-cutting move by the cash-strapped Athletics—Stairs was set to 
earn $3.2 million for the 2001 season, and his production had dropped in 
2000, hitting just .227 with 21 home runs and 81 RBI. He was the first 
baseman for the Cubs in 2001. He had an OBP of .358 and hit 17 HRs and 
drove in 61 runs in 128 games. After 2001, he signed with the Milwaukee 
Brewers as a free agent for the 2002 season. In 2002, Stairs had a similar 
season to the previous one with the Cubs. He finished the season with 16 
home runs, but still had a low batting average, hitting .244. He elected 
to sign with the Pittsburgh Pirates the following season. 2003 was a strong 
year for Stairs. He had the best batting average of his career, hitting 
.292 in 128 games playing as a first baseman and outfielder. He also hit 
20 home runs and drove in 57 runs. Stairs's 2003 season included a 3-game 
series back in Canada against the Blue Jays. In the three games at Rogers 
Centre (then called the Skydome), Stairs had 5 hits in 8 at-bats which 
included 2 long home runs.[8] Stairs enjoyed three solid years with the 
Kansas City Royals after signing with them following the '03 season. Despite 
being on one of the worst teams in baseball, Stairs helped some of the 
younger players like John Buck and David DeJesus to adjust to the majors. 
He hit 39 home runs in his two-and-a-half years in Kansas City. On July 
31, 2006 at the trade deadline, Stairs was dealt to the Texas Rangers for 
Jose Diaz. The Rangers hoped that Stairs could provide some veteran leadership 
on their club, but he just played in 26 games before being waived by the 
Rangers in 2006. He was picked up off waivers by the Detroit Tigers on 
September 15, 2006. On the day he was claimed, he immediately went to Detroit, 
arriving at Comerica Park halfway through the game and immediately took 
Marcus Thames's place in the lineup. The Tigers picked up Stairs in hopes 
that his experience could help them hold their division lead. The Tigers 
lost their division lead on the final day of the season, but still clinched 
the Wild Card. Since he was acquired after August 31, the deadline for 
play-off eligible players, he was unable to play for the Tigers during 
the playoffs. The Tigers went on to win the AL Pennant and lost in the 
World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. He did not re-sign with the Tigers 
following the season. On December 7, 2006, Stairs and the Toronto Blue 
Jays agreed to a one-year minor-league contract with an invitation to spring 
training. He made the team and saw significant playing time as the fourth 
outfielder, and replaced Lyle Overbay at first base during Overbay's time 
on the DL. The 2007 season rejuvenated Stairs's career, due to increased 
playing time following injuries to Reed Johnson and Overbay. Unexpectedly 
playing every day, he performed well above expectations, providing consistency 
at the plate and a valuable veteran presence in the Toronto dugout; team 
manager John Gibbons publicly stated "I don't know where we'd be without 
him".[9] As of September 4, Stairs had the highest slugging average on 
the Jays at .606 and the highest batting average, hitting .312. On August 
8, 2007, Stairs became the first Toronto Blue Jays player to hit five consecutive 
doubles in five at bats, and the first Major Leaguer to double in five 
straight at-bats in fourteen years since Charles Johnson accomplished the 
feat in 1993.[10] As of September 8, 2007, Stairs was playing quite well 
for the Blue Jays, with a team leading .315 average on the season and a 
.989 OPS. He finished the season batting .289 with 21 home runs and 64 
RBIs—good numbers for a 39-year-old with only about 400 at bats in the 
year. On November 2, 2007, Stairs and the Jays agreed on a two-year contract 
worth $3,250,000,[11] which included a $1.25 million signing bonus and 
$1 million in each of the 2 seasons. With performance bonuses, Stairs could 
make as much as $3.50 million based on plate appearances. Though his age 
and increasingly poor speed earned him a reputation as a defensive liability 
in the outfield, he still possessed a strong throwing arm, and was considered 
a perfectly capable fielder at first. In 2008, Stairs initially platooned 
in left field with Shannon Stewart; however, upon the club's release of 
Frank Thomas, Stairs became the everyday DH for the ball club. Stairs was 
designated for assignment on August 28, 2008. On August 30, 2008, Stairs 
was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for Fabio Castro.[12] Stairs hit 
his first career postseason home run on October 13, 2008 in Game 4 of the 
2008 National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers 
off Jonathan Broxton, allowing the Phillies to take the lead and win the 
game. In the 2009 season, he once again made it to the World Series.[13] 
He won the first World Series ring of his 16-year career on October 29, 
2008, when the Phillies won the series against the Rays, 4 games to 1. 
On April 12, 2009, Stairs's game-winning home run against the Colorado 
Rockies was the last home run called by legendary broadcaster Harry Kalas, 
who died unexpectedly less than 24 hours later. Stairs faced Broxton again 
in the ninth inning of Game Four of the 2009 NLCS rematch between the Phillies 
and Dodgers at Citizen's Bank Park in Philadelphia. Broxton pitched around 
Stairs, walking him on four pitches. The Phillies won the game later in 
the inning on a walk-off double by Jimmy Rollins, on which Stairs' pinch-runner 
Eric Bruntlett scored. During his time with the team, T-shirts were marketed 
which touched on Stairs' pinch-hitting prowess in clutch situations. They 
used a warning which can be found in many elevators: "In Case of Emergency, 
Use Stairs."[14] On January 23, 2010, Stairs agreed to a minor league contract 
with the San Diego Padres with an invite to spring training hoping to crack 
their 25-man roster out of spring as a left-handed bat off the bench.[15][16] 
On August 21, Stairs hit his 21st home run as a pinch hitter to break a 
tie with Cliff Johnson for the Major League record. On December 14, 2010, 
the Washington Nationals signed Stairs to a non-guaranteed minor league 
contract, which included an invitation to Major League Spring training.[17][18] 
After spring training, he was placed on the 25-man roster and went north 
with the team. Mostly used as a pinch-hitter, with four appearances at 
first base, in 65 at-bats he had 10 hits and two RBIs.[19] He was designated 
for assignment on July 27, 2011.[20] He was released on August 1[21] and 
announced his retirement two days later.[22] On November 2, 2016, Stairs 
was hired as the new hitting coach for the Philadelphia Phillies.[23] Noted 
baseball analysts Bill James and Joe Posnanski have theorized that Stairs 
is probably a far more talented hitter than his career stats suggest. Stairs 
didn't have 500 plate appearances until age 29, at which point he recorded 
100 RBI seasons and an adjusted OPS of over 130 two years in a row- and 
never saw 500 at-bats again. James contends, "You put him in the right 
park, right position early in his career ... he's going to hit a LOT of 
bombs." Possibly, Posnanski contends, enough to have been worthy of Hall 
of Fame consideration.[24] In January 2012, Stairs accepted a job with 
the NESN sports news station to work as a Boston Red Sox studio analyst.[25] 
On February 11, 2014, the Phillies announced that Stairs and fellow former-Phillie 
Jamie Moyer would join the team's television broadcasting crew as color 
analysts, following the dismissal of Gary Matthews and Chris Wheeler. Stairs 
currently works with play-by-play commentator Tom McCarthy and in-game 
reporter Gregg Murphy, and occasionally with Ben Davis.[26] He is married 
to Lisa Astle of Fredericton with whom he has three daughters, Nicole, 
Alicia and Chandler.[27] He lives in Fredericton and was named the coach 
of the High School ice hockey team in 2012, a job he had often referred 
to as his dream.[28] Stairs was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports
