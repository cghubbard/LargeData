Frederick (Fred) Lillywhite (1829–1866) was a sports outfitter and cricketing 
entrepreneur, who organised the first overseas cricket tour by an English 
team and published a number of reference works about cricket. Lillywhite 
was born in Hove, Sussex on 7 July 1829. He was the third son of (Frederick) 
William Lillywhite (1792–1854), the Sussex bowler known as the "Nonpareil" 
("unrivalled"); younger brother of the batsman and umpire John Lillywhite 
(1826–74); and cousin of James Lillywhite (1842–1929) who captained England 
in the first Test match played against Australia in Melbourne in 1877. 
Fred and John Lillywhite, as well as their elder brother, James (b. 1825), 
all went into business as sports outfitters. Perhaps because of this multiplicity 
of Lillywhites, latter day accounts of their non-cricketing activities 
sometimes conflict as to who did what. What is clear is that Fred was a 
manager, probably from 1848 to 1855, in the firm of Lillywhite Brothers, 
a tobacconist and sports outfitter in Islington, then on the outskirts 
of London.[1] The Lillywhites' father died in 1854 and was buried in Highgate 
Cemetery, North London. The following year Fred went into partnership with 
the Sussex all-rounder, John Wisden (1826–84), with whom he established 
a tobacconist and outfitter in New Coventry Street, near Leicester Square, 
in the West End of London. This partnership did not survive the tour to 
the United States and Canada in 1859 that Lillywhite (though not himself 
a player) organised and of which Wisden was a prominent member. By 1860 
James Lilywhite (the elder brother) was cricketing coach at Cheltenham 
College, Gloucestershire, where he also ran an outfitters. John Lillywhite, 
who had also joined the 1859 tour, was then running a cricketing warehouse 
near Euston Square, London. This was the forerunner of the present Lillywhites, 
established in Haymarket in 1863, that, following its acquisition in 1922 
by I H Benedictus, moved to the Criterion site in Piccadilly Circus in 
1925. In 1848 (still not 20) Fred Lillywhite had produced the first edition 
of his The Guide to Cricketers (known popularly as "Fred's Guide"[2]) which 
was published until the year of his death in 1866. This was, in many respects, 
the forerunner of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, founded by John Wisden in 
1864, which has since been published annually, reaching its 100th edition 
in 1963 and 149th in 2012. From 1867 "Fred's Guide" was incorporated in 
James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Companion (first published in 1865 and known 
as the "Green Lily") which continued in that form until 1880.[3] In 1865 
the Marylebone Cricket Club withdrew its support for Lillywhite's Guide. 
This falling out with the cricketing establishment seems to have arisen 
from the trenchancy of some of Lillywhite's observations. Significantly, 
in 1866, Wisden noted that "John Wisden & Co have avoided making remarks 
upon the play or players". In the 1865 edition Lillywhite proposed that 
the standard height of the wicket should be raised from 27 inches to "28, 
29, or even 30 inches out of the ground" to help avoid what he regarded 
as excessively high scores. This recommendation was implemented over sixty 
years later, in 1931, when the height was increased by an inch and the 
stumps were also widened.[4][5] The touring party of 1859 left Liverpool 
on the SS Nova Scotian on 7 September and returned on 11 November. Its 
members, in addition to Wisden and John Lillywhite, were the captain George 
Parr (1826–91), Julius Caesar (1830–78), William Caffyn (1828–1919), Robert 
Carpenter (1830–1901), Alfred Diver (1824–1876), James Grundy (1824–1873), 
Tom Hayward (1835–76), John Jackson (1833–1910), Tom Lockyer (1826–1869) 
and H. H. Stephenson (1833–1896), who later led the first private tour 
by an England XI to Australia in 1861. Fred Lillywhite travelled with his 
groundside tent and printing press. His role on the tour has been described 
as that of "scorer, reporter, and mentor, not to say Nestor".[6] The team 
won all five official matches against a 22 of Lower Canada (by 8 wickets 
at Montreal, Quebec on 26–27 September), a 22 of the United States (by 
an innings and 64 runs at Hoboken, NJ on 3–5 October), a different 22 of 
the United States (by 7 wickets at Philadelphia on 10–12 October), a 22 
of Lower Canada (by 10 wickets at Hamilton, Ontario on 17–19 October) and 
a further 22 of the United States (by an innings and 68 runs at Rochester, 
NY on 21–25 October). There were also some exhibition matches and an impromptu 
game of baseball when a match in New York was interrupted by snow. The 
team made two excursions to view the Niagara Falls. Lillywhite's detailed 
account of the tour, The English Cricketers' Trip to Canada and the United 
States, was published in 1860 and reprinted over a century later, in 1980. 
There was coverage also in the 13th edition of his Guide to Cricketers 
and Caffyn gave an account in a memoir, Seventy-one Not Out, published 
at the end of the century. After his break with Wisden, Lillywhite was 
based at the Kennington Oval, home of Surrey County Cricket Club, from 
where, in 1862, he published Scores and Biographies, a major reference 
work about cricket since 1772. He published also various scoring books 
and sheets, as well as scorecards of matches. Lillywhite died on 15 September
