Dann James Bilardello (born May 26, 1959, in Santa Cruz, California) is 
a former Major League Baseball (MLB) catcher and current manager of the 
Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League in the St. Louis Cardinals 
minor league system. A product of Cabrillo College in Aptos, California, 
Bilardello has managed Cardinals minor league affiliates since 2010. Drafted 
by the St Louis Cardinals in the 1st round of the 1978 MLB amateur draft, 
Bilardello made his MLB début with the Cincinnati Reds on April 11, 1983. 
His rookie season was his best showing at the plate with a .238 batting 
average, nine home runs and 38 runs batted in in 109 games. The next season, 
his 41.5% caught stealing percentage led the National League. In 1985, 
he improved on that rate at 48.8% – catching 20 of 41 would-be base stealers 
– although this time he finished third. He was a poor hitter throughout 
his career as he received the most playing time in his rookie season. Playing 
in a total of eight MLB seasons, Bilardello appeared in his final game 
with the San Diego Padres on October 4, 1992. His minor league playing 
career spanned a total of 16 seasons from 1978 to 1984. Following his playing 
career, Bilardello managed a different team in each of four seasons in 
the Los Angeles Dodgers minor league system from 2002–2005. All teams were 
between the rookie to advanced A-level. Later, he served as a roving instructor 
for the Cardinals. After being named the manager of the Cardinals Short 
Season A level New York–Penn League affiliate Batavia Muckdogs in 2010, 
Bilardello led the team to the Pinckney Division championship that season. 
He managed Batavia until 2012. He received a promotion in 2013 to take 
the same post with the Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League A-ball. On November 
7, 2013, the Cardinals again promoted Bilardello to guide the advanced 
A-level Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League.[1] Bilardello's
