Canton is the largest city in Fulton County, Illinois, United States. The 
population was 14,704 at the 2010 census,[4] down from 15,288 as of the 
2000 census. The Canton Micropolitan Statistical Area covers all of Fulton 
County; it is in turn part of the wider Peoria-Canton, IL Combined Statistical 
Area (CSA). Canton is located in northeastern Fulton County at 40°33′28″N 
90°02′03″W﻿ / ﻿40.557737°N 90.034264°W﻿ / 40.557737; -90.034264.[5] Illinois 
Routes 9 and 78 pass through the downtown together. IL 9 leads east 8 miles 
(13 km) to Banner near the Illinois River and west 27 miles (43 km) to 
Bushnell, while IL 78 leads north 10 miles (16 km) to Farmington and south 
11 miles (18 km) to Little America in the Illinois River valley. According 
to the 2010 census, Canton has a total area of 8.063 square miles (20.88 km2), 
of which 7.9 square miles (20.46 km2) (or 97.98%) is land and 0.163 square 
miles (0.42 km2) (or 2.02%) is water.[6] Canton was founded in 1825 by 
settler Isaac Swan, who believed his new town and Canton, China, were antipodes.[2] 
Abundant coal and labor, and the proximity of railroads and the Illinois 
River made Canton a factory town. The major manufacturing plant in town 
was P&O (Parlin & Orendorff) Plow Works, later International Harvester, 
which closed in 1983. In 1997, the 30-acre (120,000 m2) plant was destroyed 
by an arson fire, leaving the former industrial heart of the city a smoldering 
ruin, which has since been leveled. The town's employers now include the 
Illinois state prison named the Illinois River Correctional Center, the 
city's Graham Hospital, Cook Medical, Spoon River College and retail stores. 
Founder Isaac Swan, his infant child, and three other people died in a 
devastating tornado of June 1835. "Isaac Swan and his child were found 
in the wreckage of their cabin, the baby dying in its mother's arms,"[7][8] 
leading some to conclude that the tornado represented divine retribution 
for the city allowing a circus performance the previous week. The city 
was hit by another F-3 tornado on July 23, 1975. Two people were killed, 
and the storm caused major damage to the downtown area.[9] A circus had 
visited the city just one week prior, the first circus to entertain in 
Canton since 1835. In November, 1975, the Canton City Council passed an 
ordinance banning circuses within the city limits in perpetuity. Much of 
the city, particularly the northern portion, has been undermined by room 
and pillar extraction of coal that took place in the 1800s.[10] Sinkholes 
occasionally have occurred, leading to loss of property, but no documented 
injuries or deaths. Areas afflicted by mine subsidence have been cleverly 
redeveloped as parkland and recreational lakes. Central Illinois Energy, 
a locally financed cooperative, began planning for a corn-fermentation 
ethanol plant in 2002. Construction and finance delays resulted in its 
opening in 2007, approximately 4 miles (6 km) south of the city. Beset 
by financial problems and construction delays on the plant, the cooperative 
declared bankruptcy. Central Illinois Energy's assets were bought by a 
private company, construction was completed, and the plant began production 
in the summer of 2008, renamed Riverland Biofuels.[11] The plant was shuttered 
again in 2010, and its facilities purchased by Aventine Renewable Energy. 
High grain prices have led to its continued idling, although production 
could be restarted on short notice. In December 2008, Cook Medical announced 
that it would open a new medical device factory at the old International 
Harvester site. Company owner William "Bill" Cook had grown up in Canton 
and wanted to do something to help revitalize his home town community. 
Some of the costs related to Cook Medical were planned to be paid for with 
state funds: a $750,000 Community Development Assistance Program grant 
from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and a 
$1.1 million grant from the Illinois Department of Transportation for infrastructure 
improvements near the plant.[12] Scott Eells, the chief operating officer 
for Cook Group, has said that the factory will eventually be 45,000 square 
feet (4,200 m2), with more than 300 employees. Bill Cook had previously 
announced he was buying and renovating several old Canton buildings, including 
the 1883 Randolph Building on the town square.[13] Canton is served by 
a daily newspaper, The Daily Ledger, as well as by WBYS & WCDD radio and 
a free monthly community magazine, Canton Area Communities Magazine. Canton 
is a part of the Peoria viewing area, covered by news stations WEEK (NBC), 
WHOI (ABC), WMBD (CBS), WTVP (PBS), and WYZZ (Fox). Three Springfield news 
stations—WICS (ABC), WRSP (FOX), and WAND (NBC)—are also within range.
