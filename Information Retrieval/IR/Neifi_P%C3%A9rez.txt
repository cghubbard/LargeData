Neifi Neftali Pérez (/ˈneɪfi/ or /ˈnɛfi/; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈneifi]; 
born June 2, 1973 in Villa Mella, Dominican Republic) is a former Major 
League baseball player. He stands 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighs 175 pounds 
(79 kg). He was a switch hitter who threw right-handed. During his career, 
he played with the Colorado Rockies, Kansas City Royals, San Francisco 
Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Detroit Tigers. Pérez was originally signed by 
the Colorado Rockies in 1992. Frequently praised for his defensive skills, 
Pérez reached the major leagues in 1996 and become the Rockies' shortstop 
for good in 1997. Over the next three years, he scarcely missed a game 
and won a Gold Glove in 2000. During 2001, he was traded to the Kansas 
City Royals, where he also played in 2002. The trade proved to be unpopular 
with both teams, and Pérez joined the San Francisco Giants for 2003 and 
2004. He lost his starting job during the 2004 season and was released 
during that year. Pérez then signed with the Chicago Cubs, whom he finished 
the season with and spent most of the next two years with. He was the Cubs' 
starting shortstop in 2005 but was used as a reserve player in 2006 before 
getting traded to the Detroit Tigers during the year. He finished his career 
in 2007 with the Tigers. As a Tiger, he turned a double play which saved 
Justin Verlander's no-hitter, but he also had a series of positive tests 
for amphetamines which effectively ended his career. As a child, Pérez 
played for Liga Mercedes in the Dominican Republic.[1] The Colorado Rockies 
signed him as an undrafted free agent in 1992 at the age of 18. Assigned 
to the single-A Bend Rockies for the 1993 season, Pérez posted a .260 batting 
average and stole 19 bases. The Rockies, confident in Pérez's potential, 
promoted him to the single-A Central Valley Rockies.[2] Pérez exhibited 
strong defensive skills, executing the first unassisted triple play in 
the history of the California League in a game against the Bakersfield 
Blaze.[3] Pérez batted just .239 on the year but made the California League 
All-Star game and was considered to be one of the Rockies' top prospects 
on the basis of his defense. Rockies player development chief Dick Balderson 
expressed confidence that Pérez's hitting would improve: "He's got all 
the skills...He's just in a rush right now, like most young guys."[4] Pérez 
moved up to the double-AA New Haven Ravens where he batted .253 and improved 
his fielding percentage to .967 and was considered the Rockies' top prospect 
at shortstop.[5] The Rockies promoted Pérez to triple-A Colorado Springs 
Sky Sox at the end of the 1995 season with the intention of bringing him 
up to the major leagues the next year.[6] In fact, although Pérez was invited 
to 1996 spring training, he spent most of year with the Sky Sox and was 
not called up until the end of August, making his major league debut on 
August 31. In his season with the Sky Sox, his batting average had improved 
to .316. Commented Rockies manager Don Baylor: "He is the guy who had the 
year that traditionally earns a call up. I want to see what he can do."[7] 
Pérez hit .156 over 17 games and returned to the Sky Sox for the beginning 
of the 1997 season. Although invited to 1997 spring training Pérez did 
not make the 25-man roster and once again returned to the Sky Sox for the 
first half of the season, where he batted .363 with a .975 fielding percentage. 
In mid-June the Rockies summoned him in place of Jason Bates, this time 
for good. Pérez batted .291 on the year and gradually replaced Walt Weiss 
as the starting shortstop.[8] Pérez remained Colorado's primary shortstop 
for the next three seasons (1998–2000), appearing in all but five games. 
His batting average hovered around .280 (.274, .280, .287) and he averaged 
thirty doubles a year. His fielding percentage never dropped below .975 
and he won a Gold Glove for the 2000 season. Despite his later reputation 
for anemic hitting, Pérez managed several offensive feats with the Rockies. 
On July 25, 1998, he hit for the cycle against the St. Louis Cardinals.[9] 
In 1999 he tied Bobby Abreu and José Offerman for the most triples in Major 
League Baseball with 11.[10] Pérez got off to a strong start in 2001 but 
there was doubt over his future with Colorado. The Rockies had offered 
him a 4-year, $17 million contract which he had rejected; accepting a 1-year 
$3.55 million deal via arbitration.[11] In the end the Rockies dealt Pérez 
to the Kansas City Royals as part of a three-way deal in which the Royals 
sent Jermaine Dye to the Oakland Athletics who then sent Mario Encarnación, 
José Ortiz and Todd Belitz to Colorado. Denver Post sportswriter Woody 
Paige criticized the move, calling Pérez "the best shortstop in the National 
League" who was "an extraordinary defensive player, a capable offensive 
player and a classy team player."[12] Pérez arrived in Kansas City amid 
widespread anger over the departure of fan-favorite Dye.[13] Facing off 
against Dye in one of his first games as a Royal, Pérez took the low-key 
approach: "I'm just going to play my game."[14] Pérez finished out the 
2001 season in Kansas City, batting .241 over 49 games. Pérez started at 
shortstop for the 2002 season but his batting average sank to .236, leading 
sportswriters to question whether the rarefied air at Coors Field had inflated 
Pérez's numbers. Pérez also may have sealed his fate by refusing to enter 
a late-season game at the request of manager Tony Peña. At the end of the 
year the Royals were looking to move Pérez and his $4.1 million salary; 
he was eventually claimed off waivers by the San Francisco Giants and signed 
a two-year, $4.25 million contract.[15][16] At the Giants Pérez hoped for 
a fresh start; rumors had swirled in Kansas City about problems in the 
clubhouse, and it was no secret that the trade had been deeply unpopular 
in both Denver and Kansas City. Commented Pérez: "I feel happy here. I 
like the National League. I was happy in Colorado and I am happy here."[17] 
Pérez hit .256 over the course of the 2003 season; an improvement on his 
previous season but a far cry from the Colorado days. Pérez returned for 
the 2004 season, but the situation in San Francisco had become uncomfortable. 
Although signed as a starter at second base, he quickly became backup to 
José Cruz, Jr., while he lost out at shortstop to Deivi Cruz. His batting 
average slumped to .232. He had a staunch defender in manager Felipe Alou, 
but in the end he was the "odd man out" and the Giants released him on 
August 14, 2004.[18] Almost immediately the Chicago Cubs signed Pérez to 
a minor-league contract. The Cubs assigned Pérez to the triple-A Iowa Cubs, 
but he played only ten games before being called up to the expanded roster 
on September 1. Pérez became a much needed spark plug in the lineup, going 
6 for 6 in his first 6 at-bats as a Cub and providing a needed backup to 
the ailing Nomar Garciaparra. In 23 games with the Cubs he hit .371.[19] 
The Cubs re-signed Pérez to a one-year contract worth $1 million, with 
up to an additional $1.5 million in bonuses.[20] Manager Dusty Baker made 
Pérez the everyday shortstop in 2005 to replace Garciaparra, mainly on 
the strength of his defensive skills.[21] His impatience at the plate led 
to a walk percentage of 3.1%, the worst in the National League.[22] Pérez 
finished the season batting .274, and his play at short won rave reviews 
from Baker: "It's hard to play better shortstop defensively than Neifi 
has."[23] In the off-season the Cubs signed Pérez to a two-year, $5 million 
contract.[24] For the 2006 season Pérez lost the starting job at shortstop 
to Ronny Cedeño, and found himself playing a mixture of second base and 
short behind Cedeno and Todd Walker. Meanwhile, Pérez's batting average 
sagged to .254, while his on-base percentage, never high, had fallen to 
.266. In late August the Cubs traded him to the Detroit Tigers for minor-league 
catcher Chris Robinson. The Tigers were seeking a replacement for their 
injured second baseman, Plácido Polanco, who had separated his shoulder.[25] 
Pérez arrived in Detroit during the pennant chase which ended with their 
loss in the 2006 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. Pérez faced almost 
immediate criticism from fans after getting off to a .157 start, and manager 
Jim Leyland felt obliged to come to his defense: "These guys making a big 
deal about Neifi Pérez and Omar Infante don't know what they're talking 
about. They got no clue."[26] Pérez made 21 appearances during the regular 
season, with a batting average of .200 and an OBP of .235. He appeared 
in three games during the playoffs but never reached base. The Tigers retained 
Pérez for the 2007 season, although Leyland acknowledged that Pérez would 
have to improve his play: "I recommended that we trade for him. I take 
responsibility. I don't want people to get the wrong impression. I like 
Neifi Pérez, but he did not perform well. It's that simple."[27] Pérez, 
however, continued to struggle, posting a .172 batting average over the 
33 games he played in a Tigers' uniform. One bright spot came on June 12, 
2007, when he saved Justin Verlander's no-hitter against the Milwaukee 
Brewers by turning a possible base hit into an inning-ending double play.[28] 
On July 6, 2007, Pérez was suspended 25 games by MLB for a second positive 
test for amphetamines; on August 3 he was suspended an additional 80 games 
for a third positive test.[29] On October 31, 2007, Pérez filed for free 
agency, ending his association with Tigers.[30] In February 2008 there 
was talk of the Colorado Rockies signing Pérez to a minor league contract 
worth $750,000, which manager Clint Hurdle characterized as a "lifeline." 
In the end Colorado backed out, citing younger players competing for the 
same position.[31] Pérez has also had a significant foreign career. He 
participated in the Caribbean Series and was named the Series MVP in 1998 
and 1999. In 2012, he was inducted into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of 
Fame. He played in the Dominican Professional Baseball League for Leones 
del Escogido with personal success, batting over .300.[32][33] In 2004, 
he helped Escogido score 18 runs in an inning.[34] In 2006, he played in 
the Dominican Republic-Puerto Rico All-Star Game.[35] Pérez's poor offense 
after Colorado traded him to the Royals overshadowed his defensive skills. 
He was widely criticized because of his low on-base percentage (career 
.297) and lack of power. Nate Silver, a baseball statistician who analyzed 
Pérez's statistics (specifically value over replacement player (VORP)), 
concluded that Pérez had a negative impact on the teams he played for.[36][37] 
Chicago sportswriter Bruce Miles called Pérez "one of the worst offensive
