The culture of the United States of America is primarily Western, but is 
influenced by African, Native American, Asian, Polynesian, and Latin American 
cultures. It also has its own social and cultural characteristics, such 
as dialect, music, arts, social habits, cuisine, and folklore. The United 
States of America is an ethnically and racially diverse country as a result 
of large-scale migration from many countries throughout its history.[1] 
Its chief early European influences came from English settlers of colonial 
America during British rule. Due to colonial ties with Britain that spread 
the English language, British culture, legal system and other cultural 
inheritances, had a formative influence. Other important influences came 
from other parts of Europe, especially Germany.[2] Original elements also 
play a strong role, such as Jeffersonian democracy.[3] Thomas Jefferson's 
Notes on the State of Virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic 
cultural critique by an American and was written in reaction to the views 
of some influential Europeans that America's native flora, fauna, including 
humans, were degenerate.[3] American culture includes both conservative 
and liberal elements, scientific and religious competitiveness, political 
structures, risk taking and free expression, materialist and moral elements. 
Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. individualism, 
egalitarianism, and faith in freedom and democracy), American culture has 
a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic 
diversity. The flexibility of U.S. culture and its highly symbolic nature 
lead some researchers to categorize American culture as a mythic identity;[4] 
others see it as American exceptionalism.[citation needed] It also includes 
elements that evolved from Indigenous Americans, and other ethnic cultures—most 
prominently the culture of African Americans, cultures from Latin America, 
and Asian American cultures. Many American cultural elements, especially 
from popular culture, have spread across the globe through modern mass 
media. The United States has traditionally been thought of as a melting 
pot. However, beginning in the 1960s and continuing on in the present day, 
the country trends towards cultural diversity, pluralism, and the image 
of a salad bowl instead.[5][6][7] Due to the extent of American culture, 
there are many integrated but unique social subcultures within the United 
States. The cultural affiliations an individual in the United States may 
have commonly depend on social class, political orientation and a multitude 
of demographic characteristics such as religious background, occupation 
and ethnic group membership.[1] Semi-distinct cultural regions of the United 
States include New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, the Southern United 
States, the Midwestern United States and the Western United States—an area 
that can be further subdivided, on the basis of the local culture into 
the Pacific States and the Mountain States. The western coast of the continental 
United States consisting of California, Oregon, and the state of Washington 
is also sometimes referred to as the Left Coast, indicating its left-leaning 
political orientation and tendency towards social liberalism. Southern 
United States are informally called "the Bible Belt" due to socially conservative 
evangelical Protestantism, which is a significant part of the region's 
culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally 
higher there than the nation's average. This region is usually contrasted 
with the mainline Protestantism and Catholicism of the northeastern United 
States, the religiously diverse Midwest and Great Lakes, the Mormon Corridor 
in Utah and southern Idaho, and the relatively secular western United States. 
The percentage of non-religious people is the highest in the northeastern 
state of Vermont at 34%, compared to the Bible Belt state of Alabama, where 
it is 6%.[8] Strong cultural differences have a long history in the U.S. 
with the southern slave society in the antebellum period serving as a prime 
example. Not only social, but also economic tensions between the Northern 
and Southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the South 
to declare itself an independent nation, the Confederate States of America; 
thus initiating the American Civil War.[9] David Hackett Fischer theorizes 
that the United States is made up today of four distinct regional cultures.[10] 
The book's focus is on the folkways of four groups of settlers from the 
British Isles that emigrated from distinct regions of Britain and Ireland 
to the British American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries. Fischer's 
thesis is that the culture and folkways of each of these groups persisted, 
albeit with some modification over time, providing the basis for the four 
modern regional cultures of the United States. According to Fischer, the 
foundation of American culture was formed from four mass migrations from 
four different regions of the British Isles by four distinct socio-religious 
groups. New England's earliest settlement period occurred between 1629 
and 1640 when Puritans, mostly from East Anglia in England, settled there, 
forming the New England regional culture. The next mass migration was of 
southern English cavaliers and their working class English domestic servants 
to the Chesapeake Bay region between 1640 and 1675. This facilitated the 
development of the Southern American culture. Then (between 1675 and 1725), 
thousands of English and Welsh Quakers, led by William Penn, settled in 
the Delaware Valley followed by large numbers of German Lutherans. This 
settlement resulted in the formation of what is today considered the "General 
American" culture, although, according to Fischer, it is really just a 
regional American culture, even if it does today encompass most of the 
U.S. from the mid-Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast. Finally, Scotch-Irish, 
English and Scottish settlers from the borderlands of Britain and Ireland 
migrated to Appalachia between 1717 and 1775. They formed the regional 
culture of the Upland South, which has since spread west to such areas 
as West Texas and parts of the U.S. Southwest. Fischer suggests that the 
U.S. today is not a country with one General American culture and three 
or more regional sub-cultures. He asserts that the country is composed 
of just regional cultures, and that understanding that helps one to understand 
many things about modern American life. Fischer also makes the point that 
the development of these regional cultures derived not only from where 
exactly the settlers first came, but when they came. Fischer asserts that 
during different periods of time, a population of people will have very 
distinct beliefs, fears, hopes and prejudices, and that various groups 
of settlers brought these feelings to the New World where they more or 
less froze in time in America, even if they eventually changed in their 
place of origin. Continuing the work of Fischer, Colin Woodard, in his 
book American Nations,[11] claims an existence of eleven rival regional 
cultures in North America, based on the cultural characteristics of the 
original settlers of these regions. These regions are: Yankeedom, New Netherland, 
The Midlands, Tidewater, Greater Appalachia, The Deep South, New France, 
El Norte, The Left Coast, The Far West and First Nation (a region in parts 
of northern Canada and Alaska, and Greenland). According to Woodard, these 
regions cross and disregard formal state or even country borders. For example, 
he compares the Mexican border with the Berlin wall, saying that "El Norte 
in some ways resembles Germany during the Cold War: two peoples with a 
common culture separated by a large wall." Although the United States has 
no official language at the federal level, 28 states have passed legislation 
making English the official language and it is considered to be the de 
facto national language. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 97% 
of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language 
spoken at home. More than 300 languages besides English have native speakers 
in the United States—some of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples 
(about 150 living languages) and others imported by immigrants. Spanish 
has official status in the commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the state of 
New Mexico; Spanish is the primary spoken language in Puerto Rico and various 
smaller linguistic enclaves.[12] According to the 2000 census, there are 
nearly 30 million native speakers of Spanish in the United States. Bilingual 
speakers may use both English and Spanish reasonably well but code-switch 
according to their dialog partner or context. Some refer to this phenomenon 
as Spanglish. Indigenous languages of the United States include the Native 
American languages, which are spoken on the country's numerous Indian reservations 
and Native American cultural events such as pow wows; Hawaiian, which has 
official status in the state of Hawaii; Chamorro, which has official status 
in the commonwealths of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands; Carolinian, 
which has official status in the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; 
and Samoan, which has official status in the commonwealth of American Samoa. 
American Sign Language, used mainly by the deaf, is also native to the 
country. The national dialect is known as American English, which itself 
consists of numerous regional dialects but has some shared unifying features 
that distinguish it from other national varieties of English. There are 
four large dialect regions in the United States—the North, the Midland, 
the South, and the West—and several smaller dialect regions such as those 
of New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. A standard dialect called "General 
American" (analogous in some respects to the received pronunciation elsewhere 
in the English-speaking world), lacking the distinctive noticeable features 
of any particular region, is believed by some to exist as well; it is sometimes 
regionally associated with the vaguely-defined "Midwest". The following 
information is an estimation as actual statistics constantly vary. According 
to the CIA,[13] the following is the percentage of total population's native 
languages in the United States: The right to freedom of expression in the 
American constitution can be traced to German immigrant John Peter Zenger 
and his legal fight to make truthful publications in the Colonies a protected 
legal right,[relevant? – discuss] ultimately paving the way for the protected 
rights of American authors.[14][15] In the eighteenth and early nineteenth 
centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. 
During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the 
eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary 
tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. 
However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production 
usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition.[citation 
needed] America's first internationally popular writers were James Fenimore 
Cooper and Washington Irving in the early nineteenth century. They painted 
an American literary landscape full of humor and adventure. These were 
followed by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, Ralph 
Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Henry David Thoreau who established 
a distinctive American literary voice in the middle of the nineteenth century. 
Mark Twain, Henry James, and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the 
century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, 
would be recognized as America's other essential poet. Eleven U.S. citizens 
have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, including John Steinbeck, William 
Faulkner, Eugene O'Neill, Pearl S. Buck, T. S. Eliot and Sinclair Lewis. 
Ernest Hemingway, the 1954 Nobel laureate, is often named as one of the 
most influential writers of the twentieth century.[16] A work seen as capturing 
fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman 
Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn 
(1885), and F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925)—may be dubbed 
the "Great American Novel". Popular literary genres such as the Western 
and hardboiled crime fiction were developed in the United States. In the 
late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American artists primarily 
painted landscapes and portraits in a realistic style. A parallel development 
taking shape in rural America was the American craft movement, which began 
as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution. Developments in modern art 
in Europe came to America from exhibitions in New York City such as the 
Armory Show in 1913. After World War II, New York emerged as a center of 
the art world. Painting in the United States today covers a vast range 
of styles. American painting includes works by Jackson Pollock, John Singer 
Sargent, and Norman Rockwell, among many others. Architecture in the United 
States is regionally diverse and has been shaped by many external forces, 
not only English. U.S. architecture can therefore be said to be eclectic, 
something unsurprising in such a multicultural society.[17] In the absence 
of a single large-scale architectural influence from indigenous peoples 
such as those in Mexico or Peru, generations of designers have incorporated 
influences from around the world. Currently, the overriding theme of American 
Architecture is modernity, as manifest in the skyscrapers of the 20th century. 
Early Neoclassicism accompanied the Founding Father's idealization of European 
Enlightenment, making it the predominant architectural style for public 
buildings and large manors. However, in recent years, suburbanization and 
mass migration to the Sun Belt has allowed architecture to reflect a Mediterranean 
style as well.[citation needed] Theater of the United States is based in 
the Western tradition and did not take on a unique dramatic identity until 
the emergence of Eugene O'Neill in the early twentieth century, now considered 
by many to be the father of American drama. O'Neill is a four-time winner 
of the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the only American playwright to win 
the Nobel Prize for literature. After O'Neill, American drama came of age 
and flourished with the likes of Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Lillian 
Hellman, William Inge, and Clifford Odets during the first half of the 
twentieth century. After this fertile period, American theater broke new 
ground, artistically, with the absurdist forms of Edward Albee in the 1960s. 
Social commentary has also been a preoccupation of American theater, often 
addressing issues not discussed in the mainstream. Writers such as Lorraine 
Hansbury, August Wilson, David Mamet and Tony Kushner have all won Pulitzer 
Prizes for their polemical plays on American society. The United States 
is also the home and largest exporter of modern musical theater, producing 
such musical talents as Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, Cole 
Porter, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein, George and Ira Gershwin, Kander 
and Ebb, and Stephen Sondheim. Broadway is one of the largest theater communities 
in the world and is the epicenter of American commercial theater. The United 
States is represented by various genres of dance, from ballet to hip-hop 
and folk. American music styles and influences (such as rock and roll, 
jazz, rock, techno, country, hip-hop, rap) and music based on them can 
be heard all over the world. Music in the U.S. is diverse. It includes 
African-American influence in the 20th century. The first half of this 
century is famous for jazz, introduced by African-Americans in the south. 
In the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, rock was prevalent. The cinema of 
the United States, often generally referred to as Hollywood, has had a 
profound effect on cinema across the world since the early twentieth century. 
While the Lumiere Brothers are generally credited with the birth of modern 
cinema, it is American cinema that has emerged as the most dominant force 
in the industry. Its history can be separated into four main periods: the 
silent film era, classical Hollywood cinema, New Hollywood, and the contemporary 
period. Actor James Dean, who appeared in films during the classical Hollywood 
era until his untimely death, is widely regarded as an American cultural 
icon of teenage disillusionment. American independent cinema was revitalized 
in the late 1980s and early 1990s when another new generation of moviemakers, 
including Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh, Kevin Smith, and Quentin Tarantino 
made movies like, respectively: Do the Right Thing; Sex, Lies, and Videotape; 
Clerks; and Reservoir Dogs. In terms of directing, screenwriting, editing, 
and other elements, these movies were innovative and often irreverent, 
playing with and contradicting the conventions of Hollywood movies. Furthermore, 
their considerable financial successes and crossover into popular culture 
reestablished the commercial viability of independent film. Since then, 
the independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more 
influential in American cinema. Many of the major studios have capitalized 
on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar films; for example 
Fox Searchlight Pictures. To a lesser degree in the early 21st century, 
film types that were previously considered to have only a minor presence 
in the mainstream movie market began to arise as more potent American box 
office draws. These include foreign-language films such as Crouching Tiger, 
Hidden Dragon and Hero and documentary films such as Super Size Me, March 
of the Penguins, and Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 
9/11. Television is a major mass media of the United States. Household 
ownership of television sets in the country is 96.7%,[18] and the majority 
of households have more than one set. The peak ownership percentage of 
households with at least one television set occurred during the 1996–97 
season, with 98.4% ownership.[19] As a whole, the television networks of 
the United States are the largest and most syndicated in the world.[20] 
As of August 2013, approximately 114,200,000 American households own at 
least one television set.[21] Due to a recent surge in the number and popularity 
of critically acclaimed television series, many critics have said that 
American television is currently enjoying a golden age.[22][23] There is 
a regard for scientific advancement and technological innovation in American 
culture, resulting in the flow of many modern innovations. The great American 
inventors include Robert Fulton (the steamboat); Samuel Morse (the telegraph); 
Eli Whitney (the cotton gin, interchangeable parts); Cyrus McCormick (the 
reaper); and Thomas Edison (with more than a thousand inventions credited 
to his name). Most of the new technological innovations over the 20th and 
21st centuries were either first invented in the United States, first widely 
adopted by Americans, or both. Examples include the lightbulb, the airplane, 
the transistor, the atomic bomb, nuclear power, the personal computer, 
the iPod, video games, online shopping, and the development of the Internet. 
This propensity for application of scientific ideas continued throughout 
the 20th century with innovations that held strong international benefits. 
The twentieth century saw the arrival of the Space Age, the Information 
Age, and a renaissance in the health sciences. This culminated in cultural 
milestones such as the Apollo moon landings, the creation of the Personal 
Computer, and the sequencing effort called the Human Genome Project. Throughout 
its history, American culture has made significant gains through the open 
immigration of accomplished scientists. Accomplished scientists include: 
Scottish-American scientist Alexander Graham Bell, who developed and patented 
the telephone and other devices; German scientist Charles Steinmetz, who 
developed new alternating-current electrical systems in 1889; Russian scientist 
Vladimir Zworykin, who invented the motion camera in 1919; Serb scientist 
Nikola Tesla who patented a brushless electrical induction motor based 
on rotating magnetic fields in 1888. With the rise of the Nazi party in 
Germany, a large number of Jewish scientists fled Germany and immigrated 
to the country, including theoretical physicist Albert Einstein in 1933. 
In the years during and following WWII, several innovative scientists immigrated 
to the U.S. from Europe, such as Enrico Fermi, who came from Italy in 1938 
and led the work that produced the world's first self-sustaining nuclear 
chain reaction. Post-war Europe saw many of its scientists, such as rocket 
scientist Wernher von Braun, recruited by the United States as part of 
Operation Paperclip.[relevant? – discuss] Education in the United States 
is and has historically been provided mainly by government. Control and 
funding come from three levels: federal, state, and local. School attendance 
is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels 
(often known outside the United States as the primary and secondary levels). 
Students have the options of having their education held in public schools, 
private schools, or home school. In most public and private schools, education 
is divided into three levels: elementary school, junior high school (also 
often called middle school), and high school. In almost all schools at 
these levels, children are divided by age groups into grades. Post-secondary 
education, better known as "college" in the United States, is generally 
governed separately from the elementary and high school system. In the 
year 2000, there were 76.6 million students enrolled in schools from kindergarten 
through graduate schools. Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged 
academically "on track" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade 
level). Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2 million (10.4 percent) 
were attending private schools. Among the country's adult population, over 
85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a bachelor's 
degree or higher.[24] Among developed countries, the U.S. is one of the 
most religious in terms of its demographics. According to a 2002 study 
by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, the U.S. was the only developed nation 
in the survey where a majority of citizens reported that religion played 
a "very important" role in their lives, an opinion similar to that found 
in Latin America.[25] Today, governments at the national, state, and local 
levels are a secular institution, with what is often called the "separation 
of church and state". Although participation in organized religion has 
been diminishing, the public life and popular culture of the United States 
incorporates many Christian ideals specifically about redemption, salvation, 
conscience, and morality. Examples are popular culture obsessions with 
confession and forgiveness, which extends from reality television to twelve-step 
meetings. Americans expect public figures to confess and have public penitence 
for any sins, or moral wrongdoings they may have caused. According to Salon, 
examples of inadequate public penitence may include the scandals and fallout 
regarding Tiger Woods, Alex Rodriguez, Mel Gibson, Larry Craig, and Lance 
Armstrong.[26] Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established 
by English settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination 
or persecution: Pennsylvania was established by Quakers, Maryland by Roman 
Catholics, and the Massachusetts Bay Colony by Puritans. Separatist Congregationalists 
(Pilgrim Fathers) founded Plymouth Colony in 1620. They were convinced 
that the democratic form of government was the will of God.[27] They and 
the other Protestant groups applied the representative democratic organisation 
of their congregations also to the administration of their communities 
in wordly matters.[28][29] Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania 
added religious freedom to their democratic constitutions, becoming safe 
havens for persecuted religious minorities.[30][31][32] The first Bible 
printed in a European language in the Colonies was by German immigrant 
Christopher Sauer.[33] Nine of the thirteen colonies had official public 
religions. By the time of the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, the United 
States became one of the first countries in the world to codify freedom 
of religion into law, although this originally applied only to the federal 
government, and not to state governments or their political subdivisions.[citation 
needed] Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia 
Statute for Religious Freedom, the framers of the United States Constitution 
rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically 
denied the central government any power to enact any law respecting either 
an establishment of religion, or prohibiting its free exercise. In following 
decades, the animating spirit behind the constitution's Establishment Clause 
led to the disestablishment of the official religions within the member 
states. The framers were mainly influenced by secular, Enlightenment ideals, 
but they also considered the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups 
who did not want to be under the power or influence of a state religion 
that did not represent them.[34] Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration 
of Independence said: "The priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always 
in alliance with the despot."[35] The following information is an estimation 
as actual statistics constantly vary. According to the Pew Research Center's 
Religious Landscape Survey,[36] the following is the percentage of followers 
of different religions in the United States: The United States observes 
holidays derived from events in American history, Christian traditions, 
and national patriarchs. Thanksgiving is the principal traditionally American 
holiday. It evolved from the English Pilgrim's custom of giving thanks 
for one's welfare. Thanksgiving is generally celebrated as a family reunion 
with a large afternoon feast. Christmas Day, celebrating the birth of Jesus 
Christ, is widely celebrated and a federal holiday, though a fair amount 
of its current cultural importance is due to secular reasons. European 
colonization has led to some other Christian holidays such as Easter and 
St. Patrick's Day to be observed, though with varying degrees of religious 
fidelity. Independence Day (also known as the Fourth of July) celebrates 
the anniversary of the country's Declaration of Independence from Great 
Britain. It is generally observed by parades throughout the day and the 
shooting of fireworks at night. Halloween is thought to have evolved from 
the ancient Celtic/Gaelic festival of Samhain, which was introduced in 
the American colonies by Irish settlers. It has become a holiday that is 
celebrated by children and teens who traditionally dress up in costumes 
and go door to door trick-or-treating for candy. It also brings about an 
emphasis on eerie and frightening urban legends and movies. Additionally, 
Mardi Gras, which evolved from the Catholic tradition of Carnival, is observed 
in New Orleans, St. Louis, Mobile, Alabama, and numerous other towns. Federally 
recognized holidays are as follows: Fashion in the United States is eclectic 
and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are 
reflected in their clothing, particularly those of recent immigrants, cowboy 
hats and boots and leather motorcycle jackets are emblematic of specifically 
American styles. Blue jeans were popularized as work clothes in the 1850s 
by merchant Levi Strauss, a German-Jewish immigrant in San Francisco, and 
adopted by many American teenagers a century later. They are worn in every 
state by people of all ages and social classes. Along with mass-marketed 
informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably one of US culture's primary 
contributions to global fashion.[41] Though informal dress is more common, 
certain professionals, such as bankers and lawyers, traditionally dress 
formally for work, and some occasions, such as weddings, funerals, dances, 
and some parties, typically call for formal wear. The United States has 
few laws governing given names. Traditionally, the right to name your child 
or yourself as you choose has been upheld by court rulings and is rooted 
in the Due Process Clause of the fourteenth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution and the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. A few restrictions 
do exist. Restrictions vary by state, but most are for the sake of practicality 
(for example: limiting the number of characters due to limitations in record 
keeping software). This freedom, along with the cultural diversity in the 
United States has given rise to a wide variety of names and naming trends. 
Creativity has also long been a part of American naming traditions and 
names have been used to express personality, cultural identity, and values[42][43] 
Naming trends vary by race, geographic area, and socioeconomic status. 
African Americans, for instance, have developed a very distinct naming 
culture.[43] Both religious names and those inspired by popular culture 
are common.[44] Since 1820, American schools focused on gymnastics, hygiene 
training, and care and development of the human body.[citation needed][dubious 
– discuss] In the 1800s, colleges were encouraged to focus on intramural 
sports, particularly track, field, and, in the late 1800s, American football. 
Physical education was incorporated into primary school curriculums in 
the 20th century.[45] Baseball is the oldest of the major American team 
sports. Professional baseball dates from 1869 and had no close rivals in 
popularity until the 1960s. Though baseball is no longer the most popular 
sport,[46] it is still referred to as "the national sport". Also unlike 
the professional levels of the other popular spectator sports in the U.S., 
Major League Baseball teams play almost every day. The Major League Baseball 
regular season consists of each of the 30 teams playing 162 games from 
April to September. The season ends with the postseason and World Series 
in October. American football, known in the United States as simply "football," 
now attracts more television viewers than any other sport and is considered 
to be the most popular sport in the United States.[47] The 32-team National 
Football League (NFL) is the most popular professional American football 
league. The National Football League differs from the other three major 
pro sports leagues in that each of its 32 teams plays one game a week over 
17 weeks, for a total of 16 games with one bye week for each team. The 
NFL season lasts from September to December, ending with the playoffs and 
Super Bowl in January and February. Its championship game, the Super Bowl, 
has often been the highest rated television show, and it has an audience 
of over 100 million viewers annually.[citation needed] College football 
also attracts audiences of millions. Some communities, particularly in 
rural areas, place great emphasis on their local high school football team. 
American football games usually include cheerleaders and marching bands, 
which aim to raise school spirit and entertain the crowd at half-time. 
Basketball is another major sport, represented professionally by the National 
Basketball Association. It was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts in 
1891, by Canadian-born physical education teacher James Naismith. College 
basketball is also popular, due in large part to the NCAA men's Division 
I basketball tournament in March, also known as March Madness. Ice hockey 
is the fourth leading professional team sport. Always a mainstay of Great 
Lakes and New England-area culture, the sport gained tenuous footholds 
in regions like the American South since the early 1990s, as the National 
Hockey League pursued a policy of expansion.[48] Lacrosse is a team sport 
of American and Canadian Native American origin and is the fastest growing 
sport in the United States.[49] Lacrosse is most popular in the East Coast 
area. NLL and MLL are the national box and outdoor lacrosse leagues, respectively, 
and have increased their following in recent years. Also, many of the top 
Division I college lacrosse teams draw upwards of 7–10,000 for a game, 
especially in the Mid-Atlantic and New England areas. The sport called 
"football" in many countries is typically called soccer in the United States. 
A twenty-team professional league, Major League Soccer, plays from March 
to October, but its television audience and overall popularity lag behind 
other American professional sports.[50] However, soccer is very popular 
as a participation sport, particularly among youths, and the US national 
soccer teams are competitive internationally. Boxing and horse racing were 
once[when?] the most watched individual sports, but they have been eclipsed 
by golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[citation needed] Other popular 
sports are tennis, softball, rodeo, swimming, water polo, fencing, shooting 
sports, hunting, volleyball, skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding, cycling, 
MMA, roller derby, wrestling, weightlifting and rugby. Relative to other 
parts of the world, the United States is unusually competitive in women's 
sports, a fact usually attributed to the Title IX antidiscrimination law, 
which requires most American colleges to give equal funding to men's and 
women's sports.[51] Despite that, however, women's sports are not nearly 
as popular among spectators as men's sports. The United States enjoys a 
great deal of success both in the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, 
constantly being ranked in the top rankings. Homecoming is an annual tradition 
of the United States. People, towns, high schools and colleges come together, 
usually in late September or early October, to welcome back former residents 
and alumni. It is built around a central event, such as a banquet, a parade, 
and most often, a game of American football, or, on occasion, basketball, 
wrestling or ice hockey. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary. 
However, they usually consist of a football game, played on the school's 
home football field, activities for students and alumni, a parade featuring 
the school's marching band and sports teams, and the coronation of a Homecoming 
Queen. American high schools commonly field football, basketball, baseball, 
softball, volleyball, soccer, golf, swimming, track and field, and cross-country 
teams as well. The cuisine of the United States is extremely diverse, owing 
to the vastness of the continent, the relatively large population (1/3 
of a billion people) and the number of native and immigrant influences. 
Mainstream American culinary arts are similar to those in other Western 
countries. Wheat and corn are the primary cereal grains. Traditional American 
cuisine uses ingredients such as turkey, white-tailed deer venison, potatoes, 
sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup, indigenous foods employed 
by American Indians and early European settlers. The types of food served 
at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the 
family's own cultural heritage. Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar 
to that of their country of origin, and Americanized versions of these 
cultural foods, such as American Chinese cuisine, Tex-Mex (Mexican-American 
cuisine) or Italian-American cuisine often eventually appear; an example 
is Vietnamese cuisine, Korean cuisine and Thai cuisine. German cuisine 
has a profound impact on American cuisine, especially mid-western cuisine; 
potatoes, noodles, roasts, stews, cakes, and other pastries are the most 
iconic ingredients in both cuisines.[7] Dishes such as the hamburger, pot 
roast, baked ham, and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived 
from German cuisine.[52][53] Different regions of the United States have 
their own cuisine and styles of cooking. The state of Louisiana, for example, 
is known for its Cajun and Creole cooking. Cajun and Creole cooking are 
influenced by French, Acadian, and Haitian cooking, although the dishes 
themselves are original and unique. Examples include Crawfish Etouffee, 
Red Beans and Rice, Seafood or Chicken Gumbo, Jambalaya, and Boudin. Italian, 
German, Hungarian and Chinese influences, traditional Native American, 
Caribbean, Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general 
American repertoire. It is not uncommon for a "middle-class" family from 
"middle America" to eat, for example, restaurant pizza, home-made pizza, 
enchiladas con carne, chicken paprikas, beef stroganof and bratwurst with 
sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week. Soul food, developed by 
African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans 
elsewhere. Syncretic cuisines such as Louisiana creole, Cajun, Pennsylvania 
Dutch, and Tex-Mex are regionally important. Iconic American dishes such 
as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from 
the recipes of various immigrants and domestic innovations. French fries, 
Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted 
from Italian sources are consumed.[54] Americans generally prefer coffee 
to tea, and more than half the adult population drinks at least one cup 
a day.[55] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making 
orange juice and milk (now often fat-reduced) ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[56] 
During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%;[54] frequent 
dining at fast food outlets is associated with what health officials call 
the American "obesity epidemic." Highly sweetened soft drinks are popular; 
sugared beverages account for 9% of the average American's daily caloric 
intake.[57] Hamburgers, fries, and doughnuts are considered American foods.[58][59] 
Some representative American foods Traditional Thanksgiving dinner with 
turkey, dressing, sweet potatoes, and cranberry sauce. A cream-based New 
England chowder, traditionally made with clams and potatoes. A Caesar salad 
containing croutons, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, olive oil, Worcestershire, 
and pepper. Creole Jambalaya with shrimp, ham, tomato, and Andouille sausage. 
Chicken Fried Steak (alternatively known as Country Fried Steak) California 
club pizza with avocados and tomatoes. A submarine sandwich, which includes 
a variety of Italian luncheon meats. American style breakfast with pancakes, 
maple syrup, sausage links, bacon strips, and fried eggs. A hot dog sausage 
topped with beef chili, white onions and mustard. A barbecue pulled pork 
sandwich with coleslaw as the side dish. A meatloaf with a tomato sauce 
topping. An apple cobbler dessert. Family arrangements in the United States 
reflect the nature of contemporary American society, as they always have. 
Although the nuclear family concept (two-married adults with biological 
children) holds a special place in the mindset of Americans, it is single-parent 
families, childless couples, and fused families which now constitute the 
majority of families.[citation needed] A person may grow up in a single-parent 
family, go on to marry and live in childless couple arrangement, then get 
divorced, live as a single for a couple of years, remarry, have children 
and live in a nuclear family arrangement.[1][60] The nuclear family... 
is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of "family..." 
The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer 
seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we 
see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). 
Thus has arisen the term postmodern family, which is meant to describe 
the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families 
and child-free couples.- Brian K. Williams, Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom, 
Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships, 2005.[60] Single-parent households 
are households consisting of a single adult (most often a woman) and one 
or more children. In the single-parent household, one parent typically 
raises the children with little to no help from the other. This parent 
is the sole "breadwinner" of the family and thus these households are particularly 
vulnerable economically. They have higher rates of poverty, and children 
of these households are more likely to have educational problems.[citation 
needed] Other changes to the landscape of American family arrangements 
include dual-income earner households and delayed independence among American 
youths. Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income 
earner, most commonly the husband, the vast majority of family households 
now have two-income earners.[citation needed][clarification needed] Another 
change is the increasing age at which young Americans leave their parental 
home. Traditionally, a person past "college age" who lived with their parent(s) 
was viewed negatively, but today it is not uncommon for children to live 
with their parents until their mid-twenties. This trend can be mostly attributed 
to rising living costs that far exceed those in decades past. Thus, many 
young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid-20s. This 
topic was a cover article of TIME magazine in 2005.[citation needed] Exceptions 
to the custom of leaving home in one's mid-20s can occur especially among 
Italian and Hispanic Americans, and in expensive urban real estate markets 
such as New York City,[61] California,[62] and Honolulu,[63] where monthly 
rents commonly exceed $1000 a month. Historically, Americans mainly lived 
rural lives, with a few important cities of moderate size. Following World 
War II, however, Americans began living in increasing numbers in the suburbs, 
belts around major cities with higher density than rural areas, but much 
lower than urban areas. This move has been attributed to many factors such 
as the automobile, the availability of large tracts of land, the convenience 
of more and longer paved roads, increasing violence in urban centers (see 
white flight), and the lower expense of housing.[citation needed] These 
new single-family houses were usually one or two stories tall, and often 
were part of large contracts of homes built by a single developer and often 
with little variation (sometimes referred to as cookie cutter houses or 
homes). Houses were separated. The resulting low-density development was 
given the pejorative label urban sprawl.[citation needed] This has changed;[how?][when?] 
white flight has reversed, as Yuppies and upper-middle-class, empty nest 
Baby Boomers return to urban living, usually in condominiums, such as in 
New York City's Lower East Side, Chicago's South Loop and Miami's Brickell 
Neighborhood. The result has been the displacement of many poorer, inner-city 
residents.[citation needed] American cities with housing prices near the 
national median have also been losing the middle income neighborhoods, 
those with median income between 80% and 120% of the metropolitan area's 
median household income. Here, the more affluent members of the middle 
class, who are also often referred to as being professional or upper middle 
class, have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs. This 
trend is largely attributed to the Middle-class squeeze, which has caused 
a starker distinction between the statistical middle class and the more 
privileged members of the middle class.[64] In more expensive areas such 
as California, however, another trend has been taking place where an influx 
of more affluent middle-class households has displaced those in the actual 
middle of society and converted former middle-middle-class neighborhoods 
into upper-middle-class neighborhoods.[65] The population of rural areas 
has been declining over time as more and more people migrate to cities 
for work and entertainment. The great exodus from the farms came in the 
1940s; in recent years fewer than 2% of the population lives on farms (though 
others live in the countryside and commute to work). Electricity and telephone, 
and sometimes cable and Internet services are available to all but the 
most remote regions. About half of Americans now live in what is known 
as the suburbs. The suburban nuclear family has been identified as part 
of the "American Dream": a married couple with children owning a house 
in the suburbs. This archetype is reinforced by mass media, religious practices, 
and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo-Saxon cultures. 
One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban 
living is the housing occupied by the families. The suburbs are filled 
with single-family homes separated from retail districts, industrial areas, 
and sometimes even public schools. However, many American suburbs are incorporating 
these districts on smaller scales, attracting more people to these communities.[citation 
needed] Housing in urban areas may include more apartments and semi-attached 
homes than in the suburbs or small towns. Aside from housing, the major 
differences from suburban living are the density and diversity of many 
different subcultures, and retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with 
housing in urban areas.[citation needed] Due to the low overall population 
density and urban sprawl, the United States is one of the few developed 
nations where most people commute by car. The rise of suburbs and the need 
for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularization of automobiles. 
In 2001, 90% of Americans drove to work in cars.[66] Lower energy and land 
costs favor the production of relatively large, powerful cars. The culture 
in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with motels and 
drive-in restaurants. Outside of relatively few urban areas, it is considered 
a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars. New York City is 
the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households 
do not own a car.[66] In the 1950s and 1960s subcultures began to arise 
around the upgrading and racing American automobiles and turning them into 
hot rods. Later, in the late 1960s and early 1970s Detroit manufacturers 
began making muscle cars and pony cars to cater to the needs of richer 
Americans seeking hot rod style, performance and appeal. Though most Americans 
in the 21st century identify themselves as middle class, American society 
and its culture are considerably fragmented.[1][67][68] Social class, generally 
described as a combination of educational attainment, income and occupational 
prestige, is one of the greatest cultural influences in America.[1] Nearly 
all cultural aspects of mundane interactions and consumer behavior in the 
U.S. are guided by a person's location within the country's social structure. 
Distinct lifestyles, consumption patterns and values are associated with 
different classes. Early sociologist-economist Thorstein Veblen, for example, 
said that those at the very top of the social ladder engage in conspicuous 
leisure and conspicuous consumption. Upper-middle-class persons commonly 
identify education and being cultured as prime values. Persons in this 
particular social class tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects 
authority, knowledge and thus credibility. They often tend to engage in 
the consumption of so-called mass luxuries, such as designer label clothing. 
A strong preference for natural materials and organic foods and a strong 
health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the upper middle 
class. American middle-class individuals in general value expanding one's 
horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater 
leisure and travels. Working-class individuals take great pride in doing 
what they consider to be "real work" and keep very close-knit kin networks 
that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability.[1][69][70] 
Working-class Americans and many of those in the middle class may also 
face occupation alienation. In contrast to upper-middle-class professionals 
who are mostly hired to conceptualize, supervise, and share their thoughts, 
many Americans have little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace.[72] 
As a result, white collar professionals tend to be significantly more satisfied 
with their work.[73][74] More recently,[when?] those in the center of the 
income strata, who may still identify as middle class, have faced increasing 
economic insecurity,[75] supporting the idea of a working-class majority.[76] 
Political behavior is affected by class; more affluent individuals are 
more likely to vote, and education and income affect whether individuals 
tend to vote for the Democratic or Republican party. Income also had a 
significant impact on health as those with higher incomes had better access 
to health care facilities, higher life expectancy, lower infant mortality 
rate and increased health consciousness.[citation needed] This is particularly 
noticeable with black voters who are often socially conservative, yet overwhelmingly 
vote Democratic.[77][78] In the United States occupation is one of the 
prime factors of social class and is closely linked to an individual's 
identity. The average work week in the U.S. for those employed full-time 
was 42.9 hours long with 30% of the population working more than 40 hours 
a week.[79] The Average American worker earned $16.64 an hour in the first 
two quarters of 2006.[80] Overall Americans worked more than their counterparts 
in other developed post-industrial nations. While the average worker in 
Denmark enjoyed 30 days of vacation annually, the average American had 
16 annual vacation days.[81] In 2000 the average American worked 1,978 
hours per year, 500 hours more than the average German, yet 100 hours less 
than the average Czech. Overall the U.S. labor force is one of the most 
productive in the world, largely due to its workers working more than those 
in any other post-industrial country (excluding South Korea).[71] Americans 
generally hold working and being productive in high regard; being busy 
and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem.[70] 
Race in the United States is based on physical characteristics & skin color 
and has played an essential part in shaping American society even before 
the nation's conception.[1] Until the civil rights movement of the 1960s, 
racial minorities in the United States faced institutionalized discrimination 
and both social and economic marginalization.[82] Today the U.S. Department 
of Commerce's Bureau of the Census recognizes four races, Native American 
or American Indian, African American, Asian and White (European American). 
According to the U.S. government, Hispanic Americans do not constitute 
a race, but rather an ethnic group. During the 2000 U.S. Census, Whites 
made up 75.1% of the population; those who are Hispanic or Latino constituted 
the nation's prevalent minority with 12.5% of the population. African Americans 
made up 12.3% of the total population, 3.6% were Asian American and 0.7% 
were Native American.[83] The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution—ratified on Dec 6, 1865—abolished slavery in the United States. 
The northern states had outlawed slavery in their territory in the late 
18th and early 19th century, though their industrial economies relied on 
raw materials produced by slaves. Following the Reconstruction period in 
the 1870s, an apartheid regulation emerged in the Southern states named 
the Jim Crow laws that provided for legal segregation. Lynching was practiced 
throughout the U.S., including in the Northern states, until the 1930s, 
while continuing well into the civil rights movement in the South.[82] 
Chinese Americans were earlier marginalized as well during a significant 
proportion of U.S. history. Between 1882 and 1943 the United States instituted 
the Chinese Exclusion Act barring Chinese immigrants from entering the 
U.S. During the second world war roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans, 62% 
of whom were U.S. citizens,[84] were imprisoned in Japanese internment 
camps by the U.S. government following the attacks on Pearl Harbor, an 
American Military Base, by Japanese troops. Due to exclusion from or marginalization 
by earlier mainstream society, there emerged a unique sub-culture among 
the racial minorities in the United States. During the 1920s, Harlem, New 
York became home to the Harlem Renaissance. Music styles such as jazz, 
blues, rap, rock and roll, and numerous folk-songs such as Blue Tail Fly 
(Jimmy Crack Corn) originated within the realms of African American culture, 
and were later on adopted by the mainstream.[82] Chinatowns can be found 
in many cities across the country and Asian cuisine has become a common 
staple in mainstream America. The Hispanic community has also had a dramatic 
impact on American culture. Today, Catholics are the largest religious 
denomination in the United States and out-number Protestants in the South-west 
and California.[85] Mariachi music and Mexican cuisine are commonly found 
throughout the Southwest, and some Latin dishes, such as burritos and tacos, 
are found everywhere in the nation. Economic variance and substantive segregation, 
is commonplace in the United States. Asian Americans have median household 
income and educational attainment exceeding that of other races. African 
Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans have considerably lower income 
and education than do White Americans or Asian Americans.[86][87] In 2005 
the median household income of Whites was 62.5% higher than that of African 
American, nearly one-quarter of whom live below the poverty line.[86] 46.9% 
of homicide victims in the United States are African American.[82][88] 
After the attacks by Muslim terrorists on September 11, 2001, discrimination 
against Arabs and Muslims in the U.S. rose significantly. The American-Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) reported an increase in hate speech, 
cases of airline discrimination, hate crimes, police misconduct, and racial 
profiling.[89] It is customary for Americans to hold a wake in a funeral 
home within a couple days of the death of a loved one. The body of the 
deceased may be embalmed and dressed in fine clothing if there will be 
an open-casket viewing. Traditional Jewish and Muslim practice include 
a ritual bath and no embalming. Friends, relatives and acquaintances gather, 
often from distant parts of the country, to "pay their last respects" to 
the deceased. Flowers are brought to the coffin and sometimes eulogies, 
elegies, personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited. Otherwise, the 
attendees sit, stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer. Kissing 
the corpse on the forehead is typical among Italian Americans[90] and others. 
Condolences are also offered to the widow or widower and other close relatives. 
A funeral may be held immediately afterwards or the next day. The funeral 
ceremony varies according to religion and culture. American Catholics typically 
hold a funeral mass in a church, which sometimes takes the form of a Requiem 
mass. Jewish Americans may hold a service in a synagogue or temple. Pallbearers 
carry the coffin of the deceased to the hearse, which then proceeds in 
a procession to the place of final repose, usually a cemetery. The unique 
Jazz funeral of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing 
during the procession. Mount Auburn Cemetery (founded in 1831) is known 
as "America's first garden cemetery."[91] American cemeteries created since 
are distinctive for their park-like setting. Rows of graves are covered 
by lawns and are interspersed with trees and flowers. Headstones, mausoleums, 
statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves. Cremation 
is another common practice in the United States, though it is frowned upon 
by various religions. The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an 
urn, which may be kept in a private house, or they are interred. Sometimes 
the ashes are released into the atmosphere. The "sprinkling" or "scattering" 
of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony, often taking place at 
a scenic natural feature (a cliff, lake or mountain) that was favored by 
the deceased. A so-called death industry has developed in the United States 
that has replaced earlier, more informal traditions. Before the popularity 
of funeral homes, people usually held wakes in the Parlour rooms of private 
houses.[citation needed] Marriage laws are established by individual states. 
The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one 
another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over 
by a religious figure such as a minister, priest, or rabbi, depending upon 
the faith of the couple. In traditional Christian ceremonies, the bride's 
father will "give away" (hand off) the bride to the groom. Secular weddings 
are also common, often presided over by a judge, Justice of the Peace, 
or other municipal official. Same-sex marriage is legal in all states. 
Polygamy is universally banned. Divorce is the province of state governments, 
so divorce law varies from state to state. Prior to the 1970s, divorcing 
spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or sin 
like abandonment or adultery; when spouses simply could not get along, 
lawyers were forced to manufacture "uncontested" divorces. The no-fault 
divorce revolution began in 1969 in California; New York and South Dakota 
were the last states to begin allowing no-fault divorce. No-fault divorce 
on the grounds of "irreconcilable differences" is now available in all 
states. However, many states have recently required separation periods 
prior to a formal divorce decree. State law provides for child support 
where children are involved, and sometimes for alimony. "Married adults 
now divorce two-and-a-half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and 
four times as often as they did 50 years ago... between 40% and 60% of 
new marriages will eventually end in divorce. The probability within... 
the first five years is 20%, and the probability of its ending within the 
first 10 years is 33%... Perhaps 25% of children ages 16 and under live 
with a stepparent."[92] The median length for a marriage in the U.S. today 
is 11 years with 90% of all divorces being settled out of court. White 
Americans (non-Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino) are the racial majority 
and have a 72% share of the U.S. population, according to the 2010 US Census.[93] 
Hispanic and Latino Americans comprise 15% of the population, making up 
the largest ethnic minority.[94] Black Americans are the largest racial 
minority, comprising nearly 13% of the population.[93][95] The White, non-Hispanic 
or Latino population comprises 63% of the nation's total.[94] Throughout 
most of the country's history following independence from Great Britain, 
the majority race in the United States has been Caucasian, and the largest 
racial minority has been African-Americans. This relationship has historically 
been the most important one since the founding of the United States. Currently, 
most African-Americans are descendants of African slaves imported to the 
United States, though some are more recent immigrants or their descendants. 
Slavery existed in the United States at the time of the country's formation 
in the 1770s. The U.S. banned importation of slaves in 1808. Slavery was 
partially abolished by the Emancipation Proclamation issued by president 
Abraham Lincoln in 1862 for slaves in the Southeastern United States during 
the Civil War. Slavery was rendered illegal by the passage of the Thirteenth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution. Jim Crow Laws prevented full 
use of African American citizenship until the 20th century. The Civil Rights 
Movement in the 1960s and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed official 
or legal segregation in public places or limited access to minorities. 
Relations between white Americans and other racial or ethnic groups have 
been a source of tension at various times in U.S. history. With the advent 
of European colonization, and continuing into the early years of the republic, 
relations between whites and Native American was a significant issue. In 
1882, in response to Chinese immigration due to the Gold Rush and the labor 
needed for the Transcontinental Railroad, the U.S. signed into law the 
Chinese Exclusion Act which banned immigration by Chinese people into the 
U.S. In the late 20th century, the growth of the Hispanic population in 
the U.S., fueled largely by Mexican immigration, generated debate over 
policies such as English as the official language and reform to immigration 
policies. A huge majority of Americans of all races disapprove of racism. 
Nevertheless, some Americans continue to hold negative racial/ethnic stereotypes 
about various racial and ethnic groups. Professor Imani Perry, of Princeton 
University, has argued that contemporary racism in the United States "is 
frequently unintentional or unacknowledged on the part of the actor",[96] 
believing that racism mostly stems unconsciously from below the level of 
cognition.[97] American attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages 
have evolved considerably throughout the country's history. In the 19th 
century, alcohol was readily available and consumed, and no laws restricted 
the use of other drugs. Attitudes on drug addiction started to change, 
resulting in the Harrison Act, which eventually became proscriptive. A 
movement to ban alcoholic beverages, called the Temperance movement, emerged 
in the late 19th century. Several American Protestant religious groups 
and women's groups, such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union, supported 
the movement. In 1919, Prohibitionists succeeded in amending the Constitution 
to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Although the Prohibition period did result 
in lowering alcohol consumption overall,[citation needed] banning alcohol 
outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery 
industry was replaced by criminal gangs that trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition 
was repealed in 1933. States and localities retained the right to remain 
"dry", and to this day, a handful still do. During the Vietnam War era, 
attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an 
18-year-old could be drafted to war but could not buy a beer. Since 1980, 
the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. 
The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated 
with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New 
York was the first state to enact tough drunk-driving laws in 1980; since 
then all other states have followed suit. All states have also banned the 
purchase of alcoholic beverages by individuals under 21. A "Just Say No 
to Drugs" movement replaced the more liberal ethos of the 1960s. This led 
to stricter drug laws and greater police latitude in drug cases. Drugs 
are, however, widely available, and 16% of Americans 12 and older used 
an illicit drug in 2012.[98] Since the 1990s, marijuana use has become 
increasingly tolerated in America, and a number of states allow the use 
of marijuana for medical purposes. In most states marijuana is still illegal 
without medical prescription. Since the 2012 general election, voters in 
the District of Columbia and the states of Colorado, Washington, Oregon, 
and Alaska approved the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. 
Marijuana is classified as illegal under federal law. De Tocqueville first 
noted, in 1835, the American attitude towards helping others in need. A 
2011 Charities Aid Foundation study found that Americans were the first 
most willing to help a stranger and donate time and money in the world 
at 60%. Many low-level crimes are punished by assigning hours of "community 
service", a requirement that the offender perform volunteer work;[99] some 
high schools also require community service to graduate. Since US citizens 
are required to attend jury duty, they can be jurors in legal proceedings. 
From the time of its inception the military played a decisive role in the 
history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was 
forged out of the victorious First Barbary War, Second Barbary War, and 
the War of 1812. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military 
force and not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army 
become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted 
following World War II and during the onset of the Cold War, created the 
modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level 
Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military 
Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the 
Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National 
Security Council. The U.S. military is one of the largest militaries in 
terms of number of personnel. It draws its manpower from a large pool of 
paid volunteers; although conscription has been used in the past in various 
times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972. As of 2011, 
the United States spends about $550 billion annually to fund its military 
forces,[100] and appropriates approximately $160 billion to fund Overseas 
Contingency Operations. Put together, the United States constitutes roughly 
43 percent of the world's military expenditures. The U.S. armed forces 
as a whole possess large quantities of advanced and powerful equipment, 
along with widespread placement of forces around the world, giving them 
significant capabilities in both defense and power projection. There is 
and has been a strong military culture among those on active duty, those 
not on active duty, and veterans. In sharp contrast to most other developed 
nations, firearms laws in the United States are permissive and private 
gun ownership is common; almost half of American households contain at 
least one firearm.[101] In fact, there are more privately owned firearms 
in the United States than in any other country, both per capita and in 
total.[102] Rates of gun ownership vary significantly by region and by 
state; gun ownership is most common in Alaska, the Frontier Strip, the 
Mountain States, and the South, and least prevalent in Hawaii, the island 
territories, California, and the Northeast megalopolis. Gun ownership tends 
to be more common in rural than in urban areas.[103] Hunting, plinking 
and target shooting are popular pastimes, although ownership of firearms 
for purely utilitarian purposes such as personal protection is common as 
well. In fact, personal protection was the most common reason given for 
gun ownership in a 2013 Gallup poll of gun owners, at 60%.[104] Ownership 
of handguns, while not uncommon, is less common than ownership of long 
guns. Gun ownership is considerably more prevalent among men than among 
women; men are approximately four times more likely than women to report 
owning guns.[105] In the federal government of the United States, responsibilities 
that are usually in a cultural minister's portfolio elsewhere are divided 
among the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, the Federal 
Communications Commission, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the 
U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the U.S. 
Department of State, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National 
Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the Library of
