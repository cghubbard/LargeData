Jared Michael "Skip" Schumaker (/ˈʃuːmɑːkər/ SHOO-mah-kər; born February 
3, 1980) is an American former professional baseball second baseman and 
outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Cincinnati Reds. Schumaker graduated 
from Aliso Niguel High School[1] before a short, two-year career at the 
University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2001, his only year with regular 
playing time, Schumaker had 100 total hits for a batting average of an 
even .400, while achieving 41 RBI. He was selected in the 5th round of 
the 2001 MLB Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. Schumaker spent the remainder 
of 2001 with the short-season New Jersey Cardinals, and in 2002 he had 
158 hits for the Potomac Cannons. His minor-league career advanced from 
Single-A in 2003, when he was promoted to the Tennessee Smokies, where 
he spent two full seasons. A .316 batting average in 2004 was enough to 
give him a shot with the Cardinals during spring training in 2005. After 
spending the first two months of the season in Memphis, Schumaker made 
his major-league debut on June 8 against the Boston Red Sox at Busch Stadium. 
Schumaker entered the game as a pinch-hitter for the pitcher, Chris Carpenter, 
and was struck out by David Wells. Schumaker remained with the club until 
June 14, failing to pick up a hit in five at bats. On August 10, he was 
called back up to the Cardinals and picked up his first major-league hit 
two days later in a pinch-hit appearance against the Chicago Cubs. On September 
8, 2005, Schumaker went over into the stands and made a great catch.[2] 
In 27 Major League games of 2005, Schumaker batted .250 with an RBI. Schumaker 
hit his first Major League home run on April 5, 2006, in a game against 
the Philadelphia Phillies. He played in 28 regular-season games in 2006 
for St. Louis, but did not appear in the postseason. He would still receive 
his first career championship ring as the Cardinals bested the Detroit 
Tigers in 5 games of the 2006 World Series.[3] Schumaker became a capable 
leadoff hitter and a strong defensive outfielder with an above-average 
arm. However, he has difficulty against left-handers; from 2007 to 2009, 
he had a .210 batting average, a .278 on-base percentage, and a .226 slugging 
percentage against them.[4] He had six hits in seven at bats against the 
New York Mets on July 26, the first Cardinal to do so since Terry Moore 
against the Boston Braves on September 5, 1935. Combined, Schumaker and 
his teammate, Albert Pujols, were the first pair of Cardinals to hit five 
or more hits each since Charlie Gelbert and Taylor Douthit against the 
Chicago Cubs on May 16, 1930.[5] On February 9, 2009, Cardinal 2nd baseman 
Adam Kennedy was released by the club,[6] which sparked discussion about 
placing Schumaker as the regular second baseman in 2009. Schumaker, who 
played shortstop in high school and college[7] began working out with Cardinals 
third base coach Jose Oquendo in spring training to prepare.[8] Schumaker 
would go on to become the Cardinals' starting second baseman during the 
2009 season. On February 8, 2010, Schumaker signed a two-year deal with 
the Cardinals worth $4.7 million, buying out his final arbitration years.[9] 
On August 9, 2010, Schumaker hit his first major league grand slam against 
the Cincinnati Reds. On August 23, 2011, he made his major league pitching 
debut when he came in as a reliever in the top of the 9th. He faced 5 batters, 
striking out 2, walking 1, and giving up a 2 run home run to Aaron Miles. 
After a great performance in the NLDS against the Philadelphia Phillies 
in which he drove in Rafael Furcal for the only run in the Cardinals' 1-0 
victory in Game 5, Schumaker was left off the National League Championship 
Series roster due to an oblique injury. He was added back to the 25-man 
roster for the 2011 World Series against the Texas Rangers and won his 
second championship title after the Cardinals won the series after a deciding 
7 games. Schumaker signed another 2-year deal with the Cardinals on December 
12, 2011, for $3 million.[10] On December 12, 2012, the St. Louis Cardinals 
traded Schumaker to the Los Angeles Dodgers for minor league shortstop 
Jake Lemmerman.[11][12] He played in 125 games for the Dodgers, hitting 
.263. He also pitched two scoreless innings for the Dodgers during the 
season. On November 18, 2013, Schumaker signed a 2-year, $5 million contract 
with the Cincinnati Reds with a club option for 2016. He attributed his 
choice to their playoff contention in recent years.[13] The deal was finalized 
on November 26. In February 2016, Schumaker signed a minor league contract 
with the Padres that included an invitation to Major League spring training. 
On March 9, Schumaker announced his retirement.[14] Schumaker 5 feet 10 inches 
(1.78 m) and currently weighs 195 pounds (88 kg). He bats left-handed and 
throws right-handed.[15] Schumaker resides in Ladera Ranch, California. 
He and his wife, Lindsey, have two children, son Brody Hudson and daughter 
Presley Rowan.[16] When Schumaker was 5 years old and living in southern 
California, he had a chance encounter with Tommy Lasorda and Orel Hershiser 
at a restaurant, both of whom signed his baseball glove with "To a future 
Dodger..."[17] When he reached the Major Leagues with the Cardinals, Schumaker 
was given uniform number 55, which "happened to be Orel's number and I 
stuck with it."[17] When he joined the Dodgers in 2013, he initially wore
