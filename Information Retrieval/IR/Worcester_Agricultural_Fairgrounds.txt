Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds was a 20-acre (80,000 m²) site in Worcester, 
Massachusetts in the 19th century. It was bounded by Highland Street (north), 
Sever Street (east), Cedar Street or William Street (south – sources vary), 
and Agricultural (later Russell) Street (west). The grounds were just east 
of the large public park called Elm Park. Today, the former fairgrounds 
property contains a grid of streets, and many homes and businesses, including 
Becker College. The Fairgrounds was home to an agricultural fair and to 
a horse trotting race track, usually called the Driving Park. "Driving" 
was a commonly used synonym for trotting, long before the term "driving" 
came to be associated primarily with the not-yet-invented automobile. The 
grounds are known today mainly as the home ballpark of the National League's 
Worcester Worcesters from 1880 to 1882. As a major league ballpark it is 
usually referred to as Agricultural County Fair Grounds or Worcester Driving 
Park Grounds. During the game of June 12, 1880, Worcester pitcher Lee Richmond 
threw the first perfect game in major league history. There is a granite 
post commemorating the perfect game on the Becker College campus. The last 
game for the local major league club was played on September 29, 1882, 
with Troy defeating Worcester, 10–7. But a new Driving Park hosted one 
more major league game in 1887, a home game for Washington against Boston 
that was relocated because John Gaffney of Worcester served as Washington 
field manager that season. The Worcester Driving Park Grounds had also 
hosted one game for the Boston Red Stockings of the National Association 
on October 30, 1874.[1] Coordinates: 42°16′08″N 71°48′47″W﻿ / ﻿42.269°N
