The Houston Astros' 2004 season was the 43rd in club history, their 43rd 
in the National League (NL), eleventh in the National League Central division, 
and fifth at Minute Maid Park. They hosted that year's All-Star Game, the 
first at Minute Maid Park. Despite a 44–44 record, Phil Garner replaced 
Jimy Williams as manager during the season. The Astros finished second 
in the Central division and captured the NL wild card. The Astros won a 
postseason series for the first time in franchise history by defeating 
the Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series (NLDS), scoring 
an NLDS-record 36 runs. Roger Clemens won the NL Cy Young Award, becoming 
the fourth pitcher to win the award in both leagues,[1] and the only one 
with seven overall.[2] When he hit his sixth career grand slam against 
the Milwaukee Brewers on April 9, first baseman Jeff Bagwell tied a club 
record.[7] Starting pitcher Roger Clemens was named National League Pitcher 
of the Month in April after going 5–0 in a win–loss record (W–L) with a 
1.95 earned run average (ERA), 32 strikeouts and 14 bases on balls in 32 1⁄3 
innings pitched. In just one start did he allow more than one run.[8] Clemens 
passed Steve Carlton to move into then-second place behind Nolan Ryan on 
the all-time strikeout list on May 6 against the Pittsburgh Pirates in 
a 6–2 victory while striking out nine and bringing his career total to 
4,140.[9] In May, outfielder Lance Berkman produced a .785 slugging percentage 
with 24 runs batted in (RBI), winning his first career National League 
Player of the Month honors.[10] In a three-team deal involving the Kansas 
City Royals and Oakland Athletics, the Astros acquired center fielder Carlos 
Beltrán. The Royals sent Beltrán to Houston for minor league catcher John 
Buck and cash. The A's sent minor leaguers pitcher Mike Wood and first 
baseman Mark Teahen to the Royals. The Astros sent relief pitcher Octavio 
Dotel to the A's. Dotel, the Astros' closer, had a 0–4 W–L with a 3.12 
ERA in 34 1⁄3 innings pitched, 50 strikeouts and 14 saves in 17 opportunities. 
He had replaced Billy Wagner in that role following his trade to Philadelphia 
in the previous off-season.[11] The Astros fired manager Jimy Williams 
and replaced him with Phil Garner at the All-Star break. With a 44–44 record, 
the team had been slumping after spending the first month and a half of 
the season in first place in the National League Central division. That 
was considered a disappointment due to hopes of reaching the World Series 
after signing free agent starting pitchers Clemens and Pettitte, and acquiring 
Beltrán weeks earlier.[12] The 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game 
was the 75th playing of the midseason exhibition baseball game between 
the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL). The 
game was held on July 13, 2004 at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, the 
Houston Astros' home stadium. The previous All-Star Game held in Houston 
was in 1986 in the Astrodome. In the Home Run Derby, Miguel Tejada of the 
Baltimore Orioles defeated Berkman in the final round, 5–4. Tejada established 
records of both 27 home runs overall, and 15 in a single round, while Berkman 
hit the longest home run of the competition at 497 feet (151 m).[13] Three 
members of the Astros were in the starting lineup; Roger Clemens, who had 
played in the 1986 All-Star Game, was the starting pitcher, Jeff Kent was 
at second base, and Berkman was one of the three outfielders starting in 
the game. Beltrán, first named to the American League team before the trade, 
was added to the National League team as a reserve. The game had an attendance 
of 41,886 and boxing legend Muhammad Ali threw the ceremonial first pitch 
of the game. The final result was the American League defeating the National 
League 9-4, thus awarding an AL team (which would eventually be the Boston 
Red Sox) home-field advantage in the World Series. A triple play and a 
seven-run seventh inning on August 19 against Philadelphia highlighted 
an Astros 12–10 win. With the Phillies leading 7–2, Todd Pratt grounded 
into a bases-loaded triple play in the fifth inning, Houston's first in 
13 years. Berkman, Craig Biggio, and Eric Bruntlett each homered in the 
seventh inning.[14] Bagwell recorded his 200th career stolen base on August 
30 against the Cincinnati Reds to become the tenth player in MLB history 
to reach that plateau while hitting 400 home runs. On September 18, Bagwell 
collected his 1,500th career RBI with a single in the third inning against 
the Brewers. Two innings later, he homered for his 1,500th run scored, 
becoming just 29th player in MLB history and first Astro to reach both 
milestones. Bagwell finished with 27 home runs, stopping a streak of eight 
consecutive seasons with at least 30 but extending a streak of 12 with 
at least 20.[7] The Astros won 36 of their final 46 games to win the National 
League wild card.[15] After the Astros acquired Beltrán from the Royals, 
he played 90 games batting .258 with 23 home runs, 53 RBI, and 28 stolen 
bases. His combined totals in 2004 included 159 games with a .267 batting 
average, 38 home runs, 104 RBI, 42 stolen bases, and 121 runs scored. Infielders 
Coaches In Game 3, Bagwell hit his first career postseason home off Mike 
Hampton in the first inning in a 4–2 extra-inning loss.[20] After seven 
failed attempts[21] in 43 years of franchise history to win a playoff series, 
the Astros defeated the Atlanta Braves in five games for their first.[22] 
Behind the quartet dubbed the "Killer B's" – composed of Bagwell, Beltrán, 
Berkman and Biggio – who batted .395 (34-for-86) with eight home runs, 
21 RBI and 24 runs scored, the Astros' offense ignited, scoring an NLDS-record 
36 runs. Beltrán homered four times in this series.[23] The Astros faced 
the St. Louis Cardinals in the playoffs for the first time in 2004 in the 
National League Championship Series (NLCS). By hitting one home run in 
each of the first four home runs in the NLCS, including the game-winner 
in Game 4, Beltrán tied Barry Bonds' record for home runs in single postseason-record 
with eight, continuing a strong performance from the NLDS. Counting a two 
home-run performance in Game 5 of the NLDS, that gave Beltrán at least 
one home run in a record-setting five consecutive postseason games,[24] 
later eclipsed by Daniel Murphy's home runs in six consecutive postseason 
games in 2015.[25] Cardinals center fielder Jim Edmonds hit the game-winning 
home run off Dan Miceli in the 12th inning of Game 6, for a 6–4 final score 
and forcing a Game 7. It was the third game Miceli lost of the 2004 postseason.[26]
