Putnam is a town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. The population 
was 9,584 at the 2010 census. It is home to WINY, an AM radio station. 
Putnam, originally known as Aspinock, then part of Killingly, is a New 
England mill town incorporated in 1855. Created from sections of Killingly, 
Pomfret, and Thompson, the town was named in honor of Revolutionary War 
General Israel Putnam. Putnam was a key contributor in providing clothing 
and other goods to the Civil War soldiers. There were numerous mills and 
a train ran through the town, providing transportation for the goods being 
produced. On August 19, 1955, Putnam was devastated by floods from torrential 
downpours caused by two hurricanes, which hit Connecticut within the span 
of a week. Hurricane Connie affected Connecticut on August 13, dropping 
between four and six inches (152 mm) of rain across the state. Hurricane 
Diane soaked the state with 14 inches (360 mm) of rain on August 18–19. 
The result was flooding in many of the state's rivers, including the Quinebaug 
River. The resulting torrent of water destroyed homes, businesses and factories. 
Floating magnesium barrels burst, lighting up the night. The railroad bed 
was washed away. Toward the end of the twentieth century, the town took 
advantage of the empty mills and underutilized downtown commercial buildings 
to develop a large antique center. Antique shops line Main Street and other 
areas in town. In 2006, the town made national news after an individual 
was shot twice by masked robbers while waiting in a group overnight outside 
a local Wal-Mart for the release of the PlayStation 3 video game console. 
The alleged perpetrators were apprehended.[1] Putnam was also the unlikely 
base of operations for the All-Russian Fascist Organization, a pre-war 
Russian emigre group that advocated fascism for the country under Anastasy 
Vonsyatsky.[2] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has 
a total area of 20.4 square miles (52.8 km²), of which, 20.3 square miles

town is drained by the Quinebaug River, which runs north and south through 
the center of town. A tributary of the Quinebaug, the Five Mile River,
