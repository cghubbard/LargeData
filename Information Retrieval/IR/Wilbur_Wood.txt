Wilbur Forrester Wood, Jr. (born October 22, 1941) is an American former 
professional baseball player. He was a pitcher in Major League Baseball 
for seventeen years, most notably with the Chicago White Sox where he earned 
163 of his 164 wins.[1] A knuckleball specialist, he threw left-handed, 
and batted right-handed. In 1960, Wood was signed out of Belmont, Massachusetts 
high school by the Boston Red Sox.[1] He pitched on-and-off for them for 
a few seasons before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in late September 
1964. After two seasons with Pittsburgh, he was traded to the White Sox 
after the 1966 season.[2] When he arrived, knuckleball specialist Hoyt 
Wilhelm advised him to use his knuckleball exclusively. Taking Wilhelm's 
advice, Wood's career took off, first as a relief pitcher, and then as 
a starting pitcher. With the White Sox, Wood became well known as a durable 
workhorse, and one of the last pitchers to consistently throw well over 
300 innings in a season. As a relief pitcher in 1968, Wood set the major 
league record (since broken) of 88 games pitched in a season. He converted 
to starting pitcher in 1971, and continued to display unusual durability. 
During the years 1971-74, Wood averaged 45 games started and 347 innings 
pitched, winning a total of 90 games, while losing 69.[1] He led the American 
League in games started in each year from 1972 through 1975, and he was 
the league leader in both wins and innings pitched in 1972 and 1973.[3][4][5][6] 
Wood finished second in the 1972 voting for the American League Cy Young 
Award, losing a close vote to Gaylord Perry.[7] Wood's resilience, which 
was attributed to the less stressful nature of the knuckleball delivery, 
led to some unusual feats of endurance. On May 28, 1973, while pitching 
for the White Sox against the Cleveland Indians, Wood pitched the remainder 
of a 21-inning carryover game that had been suspended two nights earlier, 
allowing only two hits in five innings to earn the victory. He then started 
the regularly scheduled game and pitched a four-hit complete game shutout, 
earning two wins in the same night. Later that season, on July 20, Wood 
started both ends of a doubleheader, making him the last pitcher to do 
so.[8] He lost both of those games. The knuckleball is also difficult to 
control, and in 1977, Wood tied a record by hitting three consecutive batters 
in the first inning. Wood was seriously injured in a game against the Detroit 
Tigers in Tiger Stadium, May 9, 1976, when Ron LeFlore, the Tigers' center 
fielder, hit a vicious line drive back toward the pitchers mound. The ball 
struck Wood's left knee forcibly, shattering his kneecap. He had surgery 
the next day, but the outlook was bleak. Many predicted that he would never 
pitch again, but after considerable rehabilitation, he did some pitching 
for two more seasons with the White Sox. However, he showed few signs of 
his former mastery. He retired in 1978, moving back to his native New England. 
In a seventeen-year major league career, Wood compiled a 164-156 record 
with a 3.24 ERA in 661 games played.[1] He had 1,411 strikeouts in 2,684 
innings pitched. He compiled 24 shutouts and 114 complete games in 297 
games started.[1] He was also the last pitcher in American League history
