Erie County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2010 census, 
the population was 919,040.[1] The county seat is Buffalo.[2] The county's 
name comes from Lake Erie, which in turn comes from the Erie tribe of Native 
Americans who lived south and east of the lake before 1654. To the north 
of the Canada–US border is the province of Ontario. Erie County is part 
of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The county's southern part 
is known as the Southtowns.[3] When counties were established in New York 
State in 1683, present-day Erie County was Indian territory and not part 
of New York. Significant European settlement began ca. 1800 after the Holland 
Land Company extinguished Indian claims to the land, acquired the title 
to eight western-most counties of Western New York, surveyed their holdings, 
established towns, and began selling lots. At this time, all of Western 
New York was part of Ontario County. In 1802, Genesee County was created 
out of Ontario County. In 1808, Niagara County was created out of Genesee 
County. In 1821, Erie County was created out of Niagara County, encompassing 
all the land between Tonawanda Creek and Cattaraugus Creek.[4] The first 
towns formed in present-day Erie County were the Town of Clarence and the 
Town of Willink. Clarence comprised the northern portion of Erie county, 
and Willink the southern part. Clarence is still a town, but Willink was 
quickly subdivided into other towns. When Erie County was established in 
1821, it consisted of the towns of Amherst, Aurora, Boston, Clarence, Collins, 
Concord, Eden, Evans, Hamburg, Holland, Sardinia, and Wales. The county 
has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places 
listings in Erie County, New York.[5] In 1861, the hamlet of Town Line 
in the Town of Lancaster, voted 85 to 40 to secede from the Union and join 
the Confederate States of America; it sent five soldiers for the Confederate 
Army, and did not officially rejoin the Union until January 1946. The Town 
Line Fire Department supports the slogan "Last of the Rebels" due to their 
Confederate ties. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a 
total area of 1,227 square miles (3,180 km2), of which 1,043 square miles 
(2,700 km2) is land and 184 square miles (480 km2) (15%) is water.[6] Erie 
County is in the western portion of upstate New York, bordering on the 
lake of the same name. It is the most populous county in upstate New York 
outside of the New York City metropolitan area. The county also lies on 
the international border between the United States and Canada, bordering 
the Province of Ontario. The northern border of the county is Tonawanda 
Creek. Part of the southern border is Cattaraugus Creek. Other major streams 
include Buffalo Creek (Buffalo River), Cayuga Creek, Cazenovia Creek, Scajaquada 
Creek, Eighteen Mile Creek and Ellicott Creek. The county's northern half, 
including Buffalo and its suburbs, is relatively flat and rises gently 
up from the lake. The southern half, known as the Southtowns,[3] is much 
hillier and is the northwesternmost foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. 
The highest elevation in the county is a hill in the Town of Sardinia that 
tops out at around 1,940 feet (591 m) above sea level. The lowest ground 
is about 560 feet (171 m), on Grand Island at the Niagara River. The Onondaga 
Escarpment runs through the northern part of Erie County. As of the census[12] 
of 2010, there were 919,040 people residing in the county. The population 
density was 910 people per square mile (351/km²). There were 415,868 housing 
units at an average density of 398 per square mile (154/km²). The racial 
makeup of the county was 82.18% White, 13.00% Black or African American, 
0.61% Native American, 1.46% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 1.42% from 
other races, and 1.31% from two or more races. 3.27% of the population 
were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 19.6% were of German, 17.2% Polish, 
14.9% Italian, 11.7% Irish and 5.0% English ancestry according to Census 
2000. 91.1% spoke English, 3.0% Spanish and 1.6% Polish as their first 
language. There were 380,873 households out of which 29.60% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 46.50% were married couples living 
together, 13.70% had a female householder with no husband present, and 
36.10% were non-families. 30.50% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 12.50% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 3.04. In 
the county the population was spread out with 24.30% under the age of 18, 
8.70% from 18 to 24, 28.40% from 25 to 44, 22.70% from 45 to 64, and 15.90% 
who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 
100 females there were 91.60 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 87.80 males. The median income for a household in the county 
was $38,567, and the median income for a family was $49,490. Males had 
a median income of $38,703 versus $26,510 for females. The per capita income 
for the county was $20,357. About 9.20% of families and 12.20% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 17.30% of those under age 18 and 
7.80% of those age 65 or over. Erie County is home to the Buffalo Bills 
football team, the Buffalo Sabres hockey team, the Buffalo Bandits lacrosse 
team, and the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball team. The city also 
features a zoo, a botanical garden, a science museum, an historical museum, 
and the famous Albright-Knox Art Gallery. The Erie County Fair held every 
August in the Town of Hamburg, is one of the largest county fairs in the 
country. Plans to merge Erie County with the City of Buffalo have been 
suggested, which proponents say would eliminate much of the extensive bureaucracy 
and political and municipal subdivisions among the various towns, cities, 
and villages in the county. The result would be a consolidated city-county 
controlled by a single government, effectively making Buffalo's borders 
and population contiguous with Erie County's. These plans have proven very 
controversial; opposition has come from residents of the rural villages 
on the borders of Erie County, who feel the plan would not benefit them, 
and the suburbs, which want to avoid the financial troubles of Buffalo 
and Erie County while simultaneously benefiting from the amenities of close 
proximity to a large population base.[14] The county legislature has 11 
members. There are five Democrats, five Republicans and one Conservative 
Party (New York), who caucuses with the Republicans The Erie County Department 
of Parks, Recreation and Forestry was established in 1925 with four parks 
spanning 2,280 acres (9.2 km2). As of 2003, the county managed 38 properties, 
totaling approximately 11,000 acres (45 km2) of land. Management objectives 
include providing and maintaining recreational space and the conservation 
of the county's natural and historic resources.[16] A 2003 Master Plan 
identified several broad categories of parks operated by the county, including 
heritage parks, waterfront parks, conservation parks, special purpose parks 
and forest management areas.[16] Erie County's heritage parks include the 
five original county parks that were established during the 1920s and 1930s. 
These parks are examples of multiple-use sites with significant scenic, 
natural and historic features. Each park has unique man-made structures 
of historical character, many constructed as part of the Works Progress 
Administration movement in the 1930s.[17] Waterfront parks include the 
significant scenic sites and recreational trail systems along the county’s 
Lake Erie shoreline.[17] These largely-undeveloped parks are managed primarily 
for conservation of the natural environment and passive nature-based outdoor 
recreation activities. These lands are intended to generally remain in 
a natural state.[17] Special purpose parks have unique characteristics 
that provide specific recreational functions within the county's park system.[17] 
Forest management areas are managed by the Erie County Bureau of Forestry, 
which was established in 1927. These areas include several thousand acres 
of mostly-coniferous plantation style forest, much of which was planted 
on abandoned farmland by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. 
These areas are located mostly in the rural southern portion of the county.[18] 
These lands have limited recreation potential, mostly in the form of trails. 
Management of these lands is focused on natural resource conservation, 
in addition to potential commercial resource extraction of timber products 
or maple syrup.[17][18] Coordinates: 42°45′N 78°47′W﻿ / ﻿42.75°N 78.78°W﻿
