The Detroit Tigers' 1989 season was a season in American baseball. The 
Tigers finished at 59â€“103 in the AL East, the worst record in the major 
leagues. In August, pitcher Charles Hudson, driving drunk, slammed his 
Mercury Cougar into a telephone pole in a Detroit suburb. He broke his 
left leg and his right knee needed reconstructive surgery. Hudson would 
later discuss how he began to drink as he struggled in his baseball career. 
He would not pitch in the major leagues again and the Tigers released him 
in November 1989.[7] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
