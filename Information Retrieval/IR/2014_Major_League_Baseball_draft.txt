The 2014 Major League Baseball (MLB) First-Year Player Draft was held from 
June 5 through June 7, 2014, to assign amateur baseball players to MLB 
teams. The first two rounds were conducted on June 5, followed by rounds 
three through ten on June 6, and the last 30 rounds on June 7.[1] It was 
broadcast from Studio 42 of the MLB Network in Secaucus, New Jersey. The 
draft order was the reverse order of the 2013 MLB regular season standings. 
As the Astros finished the 2013 season with the worst record, they had 
the first overall selection for the third consecutive year.[2] In addition, 
the Toronto Blue Jays got the 11th pick, as compensation for failing to 
sign Phil Bickford, the 10th overall selection of the 2013 MLB Draft.[1] 
The St. Louis Cardinals got bumped from #30 to #31 because although tied 
with the Boston Red Sox for most wins in the 2013 regular season, the Red 
Sox had fewer wins in 2012.[3] Kansas City Royals first round draft pick 
Brandon Finnegan made his Major League debut on September 6, 2014, the 
first player to reach the majors from the 2014 draft class, with Carlos 
Rodon the second. Rodon first appeared for the Chicago White Sox on April 
21, 2015. Finnegan became the first player to play in both the College 
World Series, for TCU, and the MLB World Series, for Kansas City, in the 
same year. Kyle Schwarber was the first position player to reach the majors
