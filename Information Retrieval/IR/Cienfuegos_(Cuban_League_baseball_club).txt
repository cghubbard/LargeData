The Petroleros de Cienfuegos (Cienfuegos Oilers) first participated in 
the Cuban Professional League championship during the 1926-27 season. Although 
representing the south coast city of Cienfuegos, the team played their 
home games in Havana. Cienfuegos did not play in the 1927-28 season, contending 
again from 1928-29 through 1930-31. After eight long years of absence, 
Cienfuegos reappeared in the 1939-40 tournament. In the 1949-50 season, 
the team was renamed as the Elefantes de Cienfuegos (Cienfuegos Elephants). 
"The pace of the elephant is slow but crushing", exclaimed the slogan of 
the Cienfuegos franchise that contended until the 1960-61 season. Following 
the 1959 Cuban Revolution, political tensions rose with the Fidel Castro 
government. In March 1961, one month after the regular season ended, the 
new Cuban regime decreed the abolition of professional baseball in Cuba. 
In 26 Championships in which Cienfuegos participated, the team won five 
league titles in 1929-30, 1945–46, 1955–56, 1959–60 and 1960–61, ending 
second 6 times, third 7 times, and fourth 8 times, posting a 732-793 record 
for a .480 average. Cienfuegos also won the Caribbean Series championship 
in 1956 and 1960. Some notable Cienfuegos players include George Altman, 
José Azcue, Gene Bearden, Cool Papa Bell, Bob Boyd, Leo Cárdenas, Sandalio 
Consuegra, Martín Dihigo, Tony González, Adolfo Luque, Sal Maglie, Seth 
Morehead, Ray Noble, Alejandro Oms, Camilo Pascual, Pedro Ramos, Cookie
