The Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum is an entity established by 
Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds franchise that pays homage to the 
team's past through displays, photographs and multimedia. It was instituted 
in 1958 to recognize the career of former Cincinnati Reds players, managers 
and front-office executives. The Reds first teamed up with the Cincinnati 
Chapter of Commerce in 1958 to promote the inductions, which were voted 
on by Reds fans. Nevertheless, no induction took place in 1985, and starting 
in 1989, the discontinuation of the ceremonies lasted for nine years. In 
1998, Reds executive John Allen revived the inductions and turned over 
voting to the local chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America, 
which also votes annually for the team's Most Valuable Player and pitcher. 
The museum opened September 25, 2004, next to Great American Ball Park. 
It has more than 15,000 square feet (1,400 m2) of exhibit space on two 
floors and is open year-round. The museum showcases such unique items such 
as World Series trophies (from 1975, 1976 and 1990), the scorebook from 
the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings (baseball's first professional team), 
MVP trophies of Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan, a gallery of the Reds Hall 
of Fame plaques and other items. Rick Walls took over the role of museum 
executive director on August 1, 2007, for Greg Rhodes (the museum's first 
executive director), who remained with the Cincinnati Reds as team historian. 
Currently, the Hall of Fame section is home to 81 inductees. These inductees 
include players, managers & executives who were involved in Cincinnati's 
baseball legacy, which dates back to 1869, the year the original Cincinnati 
Red Stockings took the field. Inductions take place every other year. In 
2010 The Hall featured a Pete Rose Exhibit, focusing on the playing career 
of baseball's all time hits leader, currently under a lifetime ban from 
baseball. Artifacts include: the bat and ball from hit 4192; balls from 
hits leading up to 4192; artifacts from the Crosley and Riverfront/Cinergy 
years; gloves that Pete wore playing outfield, 2nd base, 3rd base, and 
1st base; a uniform shirt from Pete's High School (Western Hills – also 
the alma mater of major leaguers Don Zimmer, Eddie Brinkman, Russ Nixon, 
and others); baseball cards from Pete's career; Sports Illustrated covers 
of Pete; the "wall of balls" representing all 4256 of Pete's hits; and 
other items. In 2009 the museum launched its Crosley Field exhibit honoring 
the team's former ballpark. The Reds Hall of Fame and Museum kicked off 
2011 in grand style with several exciting new exhibits. Visitors to the 
Museum will enjoy six exciting new exhibits headed by the year's feature 
exhibit, Johnny Bench: Baseball's Greatest Catcher. Also new in 2011 was 
an exhibit that looked back on the Reds' memorable 2010 season, a 50th 
anniversary tribute to the 1961 National League Champion Reds (opening 
May 2011), and an exhibit that celebrates the 1980s, one of the most colorful 
decades in club history, an all-time Reds leaderboard display and a special 
homage to Sparky Anderson. The Reds Hall of Fame unveiled and a statue 
of Hall of Famer Johnny Bench on September 17, 2011. The statue of Bench, 
one of the stars of the Big Red Machine, features him in a throwing motion 
toward an imaginary second base. September 17, was the anniversary of Johnny 
Bench Night at Riverfront Stadium in 1983, when Bench drove fans wild with 
a two-run, tying home run in the third inning.[1] Coordinates: 39°05′50″N
