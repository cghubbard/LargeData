Thomas Kevin Layne (born November 2, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher with the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He has also played in MLB for the San Diego Padres and Boston Red Sox. 
Layne attended Fort Zumwalt South High School in St. Peters, Missouri, 
where he played baseball and soccer.[1][2] He then enrolled at Southwestern 
Illinois College where he played college baseball for two years. He then 
played at the University of Central Missouri for one year before transferring 
to Mount Olive College in Mount Olive, North Carolina, where he played 
for the Mount Olive Trojans. In 2007, Layne was named an All-American and 
Carolinas-Virginia Athletic Conference Baseball Pitcher of the Year.[3] 
The Arizona Diamondbacks drafted Layne in the 26th round of the 2007 MLB 
Draft. Layne progressed steadily up the minor league ladder over five seasons 
in the Diamondbacks' system and was promoted to the Triple-A Reno Aces 
in early 2011. Over three seasons, Layne had posted a 3.82 earned run average 
(ERA) working exclusively as a starter in Double-A for the Diamondbacks, 
but struggled in his time at Triple-A, accumulating a 6.21 ERA in 15 games 
started and 17 relief appearances in 2011. The San Diego Padres acquired 
Layne from the Diamondbacks on May 3, 2012, for cash considerations.[4] 
Layne made 5 starts and notched a 7.77 ERA for the Triple-A Tucson Padres 
before he was demoted to the Double-A San Antonio Missions and began working 
out of the bullpen. Layne was noted as having a "rubber arm" and he enjoyed 
having the chance to pitch every day, so he welcomed the transition to 
a reliever role.[5] Layne had more success at Double-A, posting a 3.28 
ERA and 36 strikeouts in 35 2⁄3 innings. The Padres promoted Layne to the 
major leagues on August 14.[6] Layne made his Major League debut the same 
night against the Atlanta Braves, striking out the side in his one inning.[5] 
Layne remained with the Padres for the rest of 2012, working out of the 
bullpen. He didn't allow a run in his first 11 appearances. Layne earned 
his first win as a Major Leaguer on September 4 when he struck out Adrian 
Gonzalez, Matt Kemp, and Hanley Ramirez in order in the 10th inning.[7] 
Layne finished the season with a 3.24 ERA and 25 strike-outs versus 3 walks 
in 16 2⁄3 innings over 26 appearances. Layne was designated for assignment 
on October 25, 2013. Layne signed a minor league deal with the Boston Red 
Sox on November 10, 2013. He was called up for the night game of a day-night 
doubleheader against the Baltimore Orioles on July 5, 2014.[8]After the 
game, he was optioned to the Triple A Pawtucket Red Sox.[9] As a result 
of a number of trades at the 2014 trade deadline, Layne was recalled back 
to the Boston Red Sox.[10] In 2016, Layne pitched to a 3.77 ERA in 34 games 
for the Red Sox. After they acquired Fernando Abad at the trade deadline, 
the Red Sox designated Layne for assignment on August 2[11] and released 
him on August 6.[12] The New York Yankees signed Layne on August 9.[12] 
Layne is the youngest of four brothers. He still resides in his home in
