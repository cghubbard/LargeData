The 1971 Cincinnati Reds season consisted of the Reds finishing in a fourth 
place tie with the Houston Astros in the National League West, with a record 
of 79-83, 11 games behind the NL West champion San Francisco Giants. The 
Reds were managed by Sparky Anderson, and played their first full season 
of home games at Riverfront Stadium, which had opened at mid-season in 
the previous year. This was the team's only losing season of the 1970s.
