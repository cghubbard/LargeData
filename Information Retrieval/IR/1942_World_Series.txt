The 1942 World Series featured the defending champion New York Yankees 
against the St. Louis Cardinals, with the Cardinals winning the Series 
in five games for their first championship since 1934 and their fourth 
overall. The 1942 Cardinals set a franchise record for victories with 106. 
Every Cardinal—except for Harry Gumbert—was a product of the team's farm

was the Yankees' first since the 1926 World Series, also to the Cardinals. 
They had won eight Series in the interim (a record for most consecutive 
series won between losses) and had won 32 out of 36 World Series games 
in that period, including five sweeps (1927 vs. the Pirates, 1928 vs. the 
Cardinals, 1932 and 1938 vs. the Cubs and 1939 vs. the Reds). NL St. Louis

snapped a 2–2 tie with a two-run homer to give the Cardinals the lead and 
the Series. 1942 World Series (4–1): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over New
