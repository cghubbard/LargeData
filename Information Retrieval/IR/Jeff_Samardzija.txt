Jeffrey Alan Samardzija (/səˈmɑːrdʒə/; born January 23, 1985), nicknamed 
The Shark, is an American professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco 
Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played college baseball and football 
for the University of Notre Dame, and was recognized as an All-American 
wide receiver. Previously, he played in MLB for the Chicago Cubs from 2008 
to 2014, the Oakland Athletics in 2014, and the Chicago White Sox in 2015. 
Jeff's father, Sam Samardzija, was a semi-professional hockey player, and 
his older brother, Sam Samardzija Jr., Jeff's current representation, was 
an All State football and baseball player who attended Indiana University 
and is now a sports agent in Major League Baseball.[1] When Samardzija 
was in high school his mother, Debora Samardzija, died of a fatal respiratory 
disease.[2] Samardzija grew up in Valparaiso, Indiana, where he attended 
Valparaiso High School, and was a letterman in football, basketball, and 
baseball. In football, he was a three-time first team All-State honoree, 
and was twice named the team's Most Valuable Player. After his junior year, 
he was invited to participate in the Indiana football All-Star game. In 
baseball, he was a first team All-State honoree. He graduated from Valparaiso 
High School in 2003. Samardzija accepted an athletic scholarship to attend 
the University of Notre Dame, where he played for the Notre Dame Fighting 
Irish football team from 2003 to 2006, and the Fighting Irish baseball 
team from 2004 to 2006. He made his first impact at Notre Dame as a right-handed 
pitcher for the baseball team, finishing second in the Big East Conference 
in both earned run average (ERA) (2.95) and opponents' batting average 
(.209), and being named a Freshman All-American by Collegiate Baseball 
Magazine. He continued to play baseball at Notre Dame until he was selected 
by the Chicago Cubs in the 5th round (149th overall) of the 2006 Major 
League Baseball Draft. In football, he was a reserve for his first two 
seasons, catching a total of 24 passes. He first started at the 2005 Insight 
Bowl at the end of his sophomore season. He emerged as a star in the 2005 
season, ending the regular season with 77 catches – 15 of them for touchdowns 
– for 1215 yards and making numerous All-America Teams. He set single-season 
school records in both receiving yardage and touchdown receptions. Samardzija 
caught a touchdown pass in each of Notre Dame's first eight games in 2006, 
giving him the school record for consecutive games with a touchdown reception. 
Samardzija made 78 catches for 1,017 yards and 12 touchdowns in 13 games 
in the 2006 season to finish as the all-time Fighting Irish leader in reception 
yards with 2,593.[3] He made the Football Writers Association of America 
All-America Team following the 2006 season. Samardzija was selected as 
one of the three finalists for the Fred Biletnikoff Award, for the nation's 
top wide receiver in both 2005 and 2006. Although initially planning to 
play both in the NFL and MLB, Samardzija announced after being selected 
in the Major League Draft that he would take his name out of the NFL Draft 
and play baseball. On January 19, 2007, Samardzija announced he would forgo 
the NFL Draft and commit to a baseball career. Samardzija signed a five-year 
deal to play baseball with the Chicago Cubs. The deal had a no-trade clause 
and a club option for a sixth and seventh year. If the club option were 
exercised, the total value of the deal would have been $16.5 million.[4] 
On June 23, 2008, Samardzija was promoted to Triple-A Iowa after posting 
a 3–5 record in Tennessee with a 4.86 ERA.[5] In his career in Triple-A 
Iowa, he has posted a 4–1 record and a 3.13 ERA, with 40 strikeouts and 
16 walks.[6] On July 25, 2008, Samardzija was called up to join the bullpen 
of the Chicago Cubs to replace Kerry Wood, who was placed on the DL.[7] 
He made his MLB debut the same day against the Florida Marlins, striking 
out the first batter he faced in the 7th inning. Chicago Cubs Manager Lou 
Piniella was impressed with Samardzija's major league debut, saying he 
may never see the minors again.[8] On July 27, 2008, Samardzija recorded 
his first career major league save against the Florida Marlins.[9] In 2009, 
Samardzija was optioned to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs after failing to make 
the team out of spring training.[10] However, he was quickly called back 
up only a few games into the season.[11] He quickly returned to Des Moines 
to pitch for the Iowa Cubs, after posting an 8.10 ERA in 5 appearances. 
He made his first major league start on August 12 against Pedro Martínez 
of the Philadelphia Phillies, a 12–5 loss. In March 2010 Samardzija returned 
to the Cubs and pitched his first game in exhibition on March 13, 2010.[12] 
He pitched in four regular season games in April and compiled an 18.90 
ERA before being sent back down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs in order to make 
space for Ted Lilly on the Cubs roster. In 2011, Samardzija made the opening 
day roster as a reliever.[13] During the 2011 season Samardzija, statistically 
had his best season posting an 8-4 record and an ERA of 2.97[14] In 2012 
Jeff was named a pitcher in the Cubs rotation and was solid going 9-13 
with a 3.81 ERA and 180 strikeouts. On March 3, 2013 Samardzija was named 
the opening day starter.[15] He threw his first major league shutout on 
May 27, 2013 against the Chicago White Sox, allowing two hits and two walks.[16] 
He began 2014 as a hardluck pitcher. He set a major league record for lowest 
ERA (1.46) by a winless pitcher through his first 10 starts. The 1.46 ERA 
was the latest league-leading ERA by a winless pitcher since Bruce Sutter's 
0.89 ERA on June 7, 1977.[17] Samardzija won his eleventh start of the 
season by striking out a season-high 10 San Francisco Giants.[18] On June 
18, 2014, the Cubs offered Samardzija a five-year, $85 million deal which 
he rejected.[19] On July 6, 2014, he was revealed as a National League 
All-Star, but was not eligible to play because he was traded to an American 
League team.[20] On July 5, 2014, Samardzija, along with Jason Hammel, 
was traded to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for top shortstop Addison 
Russell, pitcher Dan Straily, outfielder Billy McKinney, and a player to 
be named later.[21] In his debut on July 6, he went seven innings with 
five strikeouts, allowing one run and four hits.[22] On December 9, 2014 
the Athletics traded Samardzija along with Michael Ynoa to the Chicago 
White Sox in exchange for Marcus Semien, Chris Bassitt, Rangel Ravelo and 
Josh Phegley.[23] Samardzija and the White Sox on January 16, 2015 agreed 
to a one-year deal for $9.8 million avoiding arbitration.[24] Samardzija 
made his first start for the White Sox on April 6, 2015 during opening 
day against the Kansas City Royals. He allowed 5 runs including a home 
run by Alex Ríos in 6 innings as the White Sox lost to the Royals, 10–1.[25] 
During another game against the Royals on April 23, Samardzija was one 
of five players to be ejected for his role in a bench-clearing brawl.[26] 
On April 25, Samardzija was suspended 5 games.[27] On July 9, 2015, he 
pitched a complete game shutout and allowed only four hits in a 2–0 victory 
over the Toronto Blue Jays at US Cellular Field. This was his first complete 
game shutout victory for the White Sox and the second of his major league 
career.[28][29] On September 21, Samardzija pitched a complete-game one-hit 
shutout against the Detroit Tigers on only 88 pitches; the only baserunner 
was Victor Martinez, who singled to lead off the fifth inning, and no batter's 
count went to three balls.[30] Despite the strong finish, Samardzija tied 
for the American League lead in home runs allowed (29) and led the league 
in earned runs allowed (118). Overall, Samardzija finished 11–13 with a 
4.96 ERA.[31] After the season, Samardzija revealed that had been inadvertently 
tipping his pitches, leading to his poor performance.[31] On December 9, 
2015, Samardzija signed a five-year, $90 million contract with the San 
Francisco Giants.[32] He earned his first win as a Giant on April 13, 2016, 
yielding only two earned runs and six hits in 8 innings pitched at Coors 
Field.[33] Samardzija earned his first home win as a Giant on April 22, 
pitching 7 2⁄3 innings while giving up only one earned run against the 
Miami Marlins.[34] Samardzija also matched his career-high for a season 
of 3 RBIs in the game.[34] On July 29 at AT&T Park, Samardjiza struckout 
his one-thousandth career batter. On July 31 at AT&T Park, in a 3-1 win 
over the Washington Nationals and in support of fellow rotation mate Matt 
Cain's one-hundredth career win, another fellow rotation mate Madison Bumgarner 
pinch-hit for him after Cain threw five no-hit innings on ninety-three 
pitches. Bumgarner would hit an opposite-field leadoff double off the bricks, 
becoming the first Giants pitcher to record a pinch-hit double in a pitch-hitting 
appearance since Ray Sadecki did so in 1967, according to CSN Bay Area. 
The Giants inserted Samardzija as a pinch-runner and would score later 
in the inning, marking the first occurrence in a San Francisco Giants game 
that a pinch-hitting pitcher reached base, was substituted for by a pinch-running 
pitcher, and scored a run.[35][36][37] Samardzija has thrown as many as 
seven types of pitches in his career, but as of 2016, he uses six. They 
are as follows: a four-seam fastball (93–97 mph), two-seam fastball (92–96), 
cutter (91–93), slider (84–86), splitter (85–87) and a curveball (79-82). 
He is comfortable throwing all of his pitches to right-handed hitters, 
but he tends not to throw the cutter to left-handed hitters. Against both 
right-handed and left-handed hitters, the splitter is by a wide margin 
his most commonly thrown pitch in 2-strike counts. As of August 2016, Samardzija 
re-inserted the curveball into his repertoire, a pitch he had not used 
in almost 4 years. [38][39] Samardzija is of Serbian heritage.[40] His 
grandparents emigrated from Europe in the 1940s.[41] Several of Samardzija's 
Notre Dame baseball teammates nicknamed him "Shark" during his career at
