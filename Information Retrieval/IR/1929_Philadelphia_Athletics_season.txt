The 1929 Philadelphia Athletics season involved the A's finishing 1st in 
the American League with a record of 104 wins and 46 losses. After finishing 
in second place to the New York Yankees in 1927 and 1928, the club won 
the 1929 pennant by a large 18-game margin. The club went on to win the 
World Series over the NL champion Chicago Cubs, four games to one. Led 
by longtime owner-manager Connie Mack, the Athletics dominated during the 
regular season. Mack had purchased quite a few players from the Baltimore 
Orioles minor league club, and many of them would contribute to the A's 
1929–31 dynasty.[citation needed] The most famous of these players was 
ace Lefty Grove. In 1929, Grove led the American League in ERA and strikeouts 
on his way to a 20–6 record. Big George Earnshaw was the number two pitcher 
on the squad. He led the league in wins (24) and was second in strikeouts. 
Led by these two, Philadelphia allowed the fewest runs of any AL team. 
On the offensive side, the A's boasted Hall of Famers Mickey Cochrane, 
Jimmie Foxx, and Al Simmons. Simmons beat out Babe Ruth for the RBI crown 
in 1929. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters Note:

AL Philadelphia Athletics (4) vs. NL Chicago Cubs (1) [2] Al Simmons and 
the 1929–1931 Athletics were the subject of an August 19, 1996, cover-story 
in Sports Illustrated with the teaser, "The Team that Time Forgot". Author 
William Nack wrote, "according to most old-timers who played in that era, 
the 1927 and '28 Yankees and the 1929 and '30 Athletics matched up so closely 
that they were nearly equal, with the A's given the nod in fielding and 
pitching and the Yankees in hitting."[4] On August 16, 2009, the Oakland 
Athletics celebrated the 80th anniversary of the 1929 team by wearing 1929 
home uniforms against the Chicago White Sox. First pitches were thrown 
out by Kathleen Kelly, the granddaughter of Connie Mack, and Jim Conlin, 
the grandson of Jimmie Foxx.[5] The A's won the game on a walk-off home
