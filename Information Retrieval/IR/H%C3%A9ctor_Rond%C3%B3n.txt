Héctor Luis Rondón (born February 26, 1988) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). Rondón 
signed as an international free agent with the Cleveland Indians. He had 
Tommy John surgery in 2010 and fractured his elbow in 2011.[1] Rondón was 
selected by the Chicago Cubs from the Indians in the 2012 Rule 5 Draft.[2] 
He made the Cubs' 2013 Opening Day roster and made his major league debut 
on April 3. In his first season with the Cubs, he had a 2-1 record with 
a 4.77 ERA with 44 SO. After struggles by Cubs closer José Veras early 
in the 2014 season, Rondón was named the new Cubs closer. He had a breakout 
2014 season. He earned two saves in the 2015 National League Division Series 
against the St. Louis Cardinals, including a save in the series-clinching 
game 4.[3] With the addition of Aroldis Chapman in late July 2016, Rondon 
was moved to the setup role in the bullpen. Rondon finished 2016 with a 
2-3 record and a 3.53 ERA in 54 appearances. The Cubs won the 2016 World 
Series over the Cleveland Indians, ending the Cubs' 108-year drought.[4] 
Rondon relies mostly on three pitches. He has relied primarily on his four-seam 
fastball which has great arm-side, running movement (97 mph) and slider 
(86 mph), also mixing in a sinker (97 mph). He also rarely throws a changeup
