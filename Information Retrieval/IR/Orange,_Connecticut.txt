Orange is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The population 
was 13,956 at the 2010 census.[1] The town is governed by a Board of Selectmen. 
The Paugusset, an Algonquian people, once lived in the area that is now 
Orange. In 1639, the Rev. Peter Prudden purchased the land from the Indians 
for six coats, ten blankets, one kettle, twelve hatchets, twelve hoes, 
two dozen knives and a dozen small mirrors.[2] When originally settled 
by English colonists, Orange was simply the northern and eastern district 
of the now neighboring city of Milford; however, by 1822, the population 
of the area had grown to the point where residents desired to form their 
own separate community, thus forming the town of Orange. The town is named 
after William III of England, who was Prince of Orange from birth. William 
is remembered for succeeding James II, deposed in the Glorious Revolution 
of 1688. James II had been considered a despot in Connecticut; he had famously 
and unsuccessfully commissioned Edmund Andros to seize Connecticut's Charter.[3] 
The town continued to grow throughout the 19th century. As early as 1848, 
a separation of Orange and West Haven was considered. It was not until 
1921 that the two were officially separated by act of the Connecticut General 
Assembly and the new city of West Haven was formed out of the southeastern 
portion of Orange.[3] This gave the remnant town of Orange a very rural 
feel, as the bulk of the urbanized population was ceded to West Haven. 
In the post-war years, however, Orange began suburbanizing at a rapid pace. 
Early roads through the area included the Boston Post Road (now U.S. Route 
1) and the Derby Turnpike (now Connecticut Route 34). The turnpike was 
originally an Indian path. A toll road through Orange, from New Haven to 
Derby, was built starting in 1800. The toll house was located in Orange; 
tolls ended in 1887.[4] The New Haven and Derby Railroad ran through Orange 
starting in 1871, with a station in Orange. At its peak, there were eleven 
trains per day in each direction along with one freight train. The advent 
of a trolley from New Haven to Derby (starting in 1904 and running until 
1937) hastened the end to rail service (in 1925).[4] Later, the construction 
of the Wilbur Cross Parkway and Interstate 95 brought highways through 
the area. As of the census of 2000,[10] there were 13,233 people, 4,739 
households, and 3,895 families residing in the town. The population density 
was 770.0 people per square mile (297.2/km²). There were 4,870 housing 
units at an average density of 283.4 per square mile (109.4/km²). The racial 
makeup of the town was 94.08% White, 0.79% Black or African American, 0.08% 
Native American, 3.84% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.32% from other 
races, and 0.88% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race 
were 1.44% of the population. There were 4,739 households out of which 
35.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 73.1% were married 
couples living together, 6.7% had a female householder with no husband 
present, and 17.8% were non-families. 15.7% of all households were made 
up of individuals and 10.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of 
age or older. The average household size was 2.77 and the average family 
size was 3.09. In the town the population was spread out with 24.6% under 
the age of 18, 4.3% from 18 to 24, 24.5% from 25 to 44, 26.7% from 45 to 
64, and 19.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 
years. For every 100 females there were 94.5 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 91.1 males. The median income for a household 
in the town was $79,365, and the median income for a family was $88,583. 
Males had a median income of $58,946 versus $41,563 for females. The per 
capita income for the town was $36,471. About 2.1% of families and 2.5% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.4% of those 
under age 18 and 4.3% of those age 65 or over.[11] Orange is served by 
the regional Amity Regional High School in Woodbridge.[13] Orange exhibits 
its rural roots at the annual Orange Country Fair. This event originally 
ran from 1898 to 1912 and was revived in 1975. It has continued since then 
featuring horse, oxen and tractor pulls as well as exhibits of animals, 
flowers, fruits, vegetables and baked goods.[14] In early August, the town 
also promotes the Orange Volunteer Fireman's Carnival, which raises funds 
to support the volunteer fire department. Both events are held at the fairgrounds 
at High Plains Community Center near the center of town. Orange was the 
home of the first computer camp,[15][16] held at the local Amity Jr. High 
School in 1977. During the Cold War, Orange served as a location for the 
permanent deployment of Nike missiles for the defense of Greater New Haven. 
The former site of the Nike missiles has since served (from the late 1950s 
onward) as the home of the 103rd Air Control and Warning Squadron, later 
to become the 103rd Tactical Control Squadron and as it remains today the 
103rd Air Control Squadron, a part of the Connecticut Air National Guard.[17][18] 
In the early nineteenth century, settlers from Orange founded Orange, Ohio, 
then part of Connecticut's Western Reserve. On August 18, 2005 the Orange 
Little League Girls softball team lost the championship game of the Little 
League Softball World Series to a team from McLean, Virginia.[19][20] On 
March 15–17, 2009, Orange hosted the 2009 ConnJam, a Boy Scout event in 
which over 3,000 Boy Scouts from the Connecticut Yankee Council attended 
events and camped over the weekend.[21][22] Orange is the home of the North 
American headquarters of Pez candies.[23][24] It is also the home of the 
headquarters of Southern Connecticut Gas[25] and the headquarters of The 
United Illuminating Company.[26] Tangoe, Inc., a provider of telecommunications 
management software, is headquartered in Orange.[27] Orange was the home 
of the US headquarters of Saab-Scania from 1972 until 1992 when the company 
relocated to Norcross, Georgia.[28] From 1973-2010, Hubbell, a manufacturer 
of electrical products, was headquartered in Orange.[29] In February 2013, 
the University of New Haven announced plans to purchase the former Hubbell 
headquarters buildings to redevelop as a graduate school campus.[30] Yale's 
West Campus is located on the Orange-West Haven town line, on a 136-acre 
property that was formerly occupied by Bayer. In August 2013, the Yale 
School of Nursing will relocate to a building on the West Campus that is 
mostly on the Orange side of the town border.[31] About three percent of 
the 17 square miles in the town is farmed.[32] One such farm, Field View 
Farm, has been operated by the Hine family since 1639.[33][34] The town 
has extensive retail development along the Boston Post Road corridor.[32] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area 
of 17.4 square miles (45.1 km²), of which 17.2 square miles (44.5 km²) 
is land and 0.2 square miles (0.6 km²), or 1.38%, is water. The town limits 
include Wooster Island in the Housatonic River. *Consolidated borough and
