The Atlanta Braves are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in 
Atlanta, Georgia. They play in the National League East division. Officially 
known as the "First-Year Player Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary 
mechanism for assigning players from high schools, colleges, and other 
amateur clubs to its franchises. The draft order is determined based on 
the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record 
receiving the first pick.[1] In addition, teams which lost free agents 
in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary 
picks.[2] Since the establishment of the draft in 1965, the Braves have 
selected 56 players in the first round. Of those 56 players, 27 have been 
pitchers, the most of any position; 15 of these were right-handed, while 
12 were left-handed. The Braves have also selected eight outfielders, seven 
shortstops, five catchers, four third basemen, three first basemen, and 
two second basemen in the initial round of the draft.[3] The franchise 
has drafted nine players from colleges or high schools in the state of 
Florida, more than any other state. Eight more selections have come from 
their home state of Georgia.[3] Two selections have come from outside the 
50 United States: Luis Atilano (2003) is from the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, and Scott Thorman (2000) is from Ontario, Canada. Four of these players 
have won a World Series championship with the Braves—Kent Mercker, Steve 
Avery, Chipper Jones, and Mike Kelly—all as part of the 1995 championship 
team. The team's 1974 selection, Dale Murphy, won consecutive National 
League Most Valuable Player Awards (NL MVP) in 1982 and 1983,[4] the Lou 
Gehrig Memorial Award in 1985, and the Roberto Clemente Award in 1988.[5] 
Bob Horner, the Braves' 1978 selection, won the National League Rookie 
of the Year Award in the same year.[6] Chipper Jones, drafted by the Braves 
in 1990, won the NL MVP Award in 1999.[7] The Braves have held the first 
overall pick twice; in 1978 they used it to select Horner, and in 1990 
they chose Chipper Jones. Atlanta has made 13 selections in the supplemental 
round of the draft. They have also received three compensatory picks since 
the first draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team 
loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[2][8][V] 
or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous 
year.[9] The Braves failed to sign 1995 selection Chad Hutchinson, for 
which they received the 35th overall pick in the 1996 draft, which they
