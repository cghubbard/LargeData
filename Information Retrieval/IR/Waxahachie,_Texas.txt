Waxahachie (/ˌwɒksəˈhætʃi/ WOK-sa-HATCH-ee, unlike the Waxahatchee Creek 
in Alabama) is the county seat of Ellis County, Texas, United States, and 
lies just beyond the southern suburbs of Dallas. The population was 29,621 
at the 2010 census,[4] with an estimated population of 32,344 in 2014.[5] 
Some sources state that the name means "cow" or "buffalo" in an unspecified 
Native American language.[6] One possible Native American origin is the 
Alabama language, originally spoken in the area of Alabama around Waxahatchee 
Creek by the Alabama-Coushatta people, who had migrated by the 1850s to 
eastern Texas. In the Alabama language, waakasi hachi means "calf's tail" 
(the Alabama word waaka being a loan from Spanish vaca).[7] That there 
is a Waxahatchee Creek near present-day Shelby, Alabama, suggests that 
Waxahachie, Texas, shares the same name etymology. Many place names in 
Texas and Oklahoma have their origins in the Southeastern United States, 
largely due to migration and/or forced removal of various southeastern 
Indian tribes. The area in central Alabama that includes Waxahatchee Creek 
was for hundreds of years the home of the Upper Creek moiety of the Muscogee 
Creek Nation. Again, this would suggest a Muscogee Creek language origin 
of Waxahachie. "Waxahachie" therefore may be an anglicized pronunciation 
of the Muscogee compound word Wakvhvce from the Muscogee words Wakv (meaning 
"cow" derived from the Spanish vaca) and the Muscogee word Hvce (meaning 
"tail").[8] A second etymology that has been suggested for the name is 
insisted on by speakers of Wichita, the language of the tribe which used 
to live in the area but now lives mostly around Anadarko, Oklahoma. Wichita 
people claim the name comes from their word waks'ahe:ts'i (the apostrophe 
represents a glottal stop, like the middle sound in "oh oh"; "a" is schwa 
("uh"); "e:" sounds almost like the "a" of "hat"; "ts" before "i" in this 
language often sounds like "ch" to English speaking ears; "i" has the continental 
value, like the one in English "machine"). It means "fat wildcat".[9] Waxahachie 
was founded in August 1850 as the seat of the newly established Ellis County 
on a donated tract of land given by early settler Emory W. Rogers, a native 
of Lawrence County, Alabama, who migrated to Texas in 1839.[6][10] It was 
incorporated on April 28, 1871, and in 1875 the state legislature granted 
investors the right to operate a rail line from Waxahachie Tap Railroad 
to Garrett, Texas, which greatly increased the population of Waxahachie.[11] 
From 1902 to 1942, Waxahachie was the home of Trinity University, which 
was a Presbyterian-affiliated institution founded in 1869. Its present-day 
location is San Antonio. The town is the namesake of the former United 
States Naval Ship Waxahachie (YTB-814). In 1988, the area around Waxahachie 
was chosen as the site for the Superconducting Super Collider, which was 
to be the world's largest and most energetic particle accelerator, with 
a planned ring circumference of 54.1 miles (87.1 km). Seventeen shafts 
were sunk and 14.6 miles (23.5 km) of tunnel were bored[12] before the 
project was canceled by Congress in 1993. The climate in this area is characterized 
by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to 
the Köppen Climate Classification system, Waxahachie has a humid subtropical 
climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.[13] As of the census[2] of

Waxahachie became popular with the movie industry. The majority of Tender 
Mercies, a 1983 film about a country western singer, was filmed in Waxahachie. 
Director Bruce Beresford deliberately avoided the city's picturesque elements 
and Victorian architecture, and instead filmed more rural locations that 
more closely resembled the West Texas area. The Texas town portrayed in 
Tender Mercies is never specifically identified.[29] Mercies starred Robert 
Duvall, who won the 1983 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the 
film. The 1984 film Places in the Heart starring Sally Field was also filmed 
in Waxahachie. Unlike Mercies, it was filmed deliberately in the town square 
and utilized the Victorian and plantation homes still intact in the area. 
Field won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1985 for her role in the 
film. The 1985 film The Trip to Bountiful starring Geraldine Page was also 
filmed in Waxahachie. Page won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1986
