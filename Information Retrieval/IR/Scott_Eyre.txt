Scott Alan Eyre (born May 30, 1972[1]) is a former left-handed pitcher 
in Major League Baseball. Scott Eyre attended the College of Southern Idaho 
in Twin Falls, Idaho and was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 9th round 
of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. He was traded to the Chicago White 
Sox in 1994 and made his major league debut in Chicago on August 1, 1997. 
He would finish the 1997 season making 11 starts, going 4-4 in 60.2 innings. 
The following season, Eyre would split the season between the rotation 
and the bullpen, appearing in 33 games while making 17 starts. Eyre had 
the worst season of his young career, going 3-8 while walking 64 batters 
in 107 innings of work for the White Sox. In 1999, Eyre had a 7.56 ERA 
in 21 games while in 2000 he only appeared in 13 games, going 1-1 for the 
second straight season. Eyre was traded in 2000 to the Toronto Blue Jays 
for Gary Glover.[2][3] In his first season with Toronto, Eyre saved 2 games 
in 15 games. In 2002, Eyre made 3 spot starts while also making 46 relief 
appearances for the Blue Jays, going 2-4 with a 4.97 ERA. Eyre was selected 
off waivers from the Blue Jays by the San Francisco Giants in 2002.[4] 
He made the transition to the National League impressively as he had a 
1.59 ERA in 21 games for the Giants. In 2003, Eyre appeared in 74 games 
with a 3.32 ERA. He was rewarded with a 2-year contract extension after 
the season.[5] In 2004 Eyre appeared in 83 games while in 2005 he led the 
Majors in appearances, pitching in 86 games. On November 18, 2005, Eyre 
signed a three-year contract with the Chicago Cubs and pitched his way 
to an ERA of 3.38. He was one of the more consistently used relievers on 
a pitching staff that often struggled. He was used mainly in 7th and 8th 
inning situations in tandem with Bob Howry with Eyre being used more often 
in lefty vs. lefty situations. Eyre has noted that Lou Piniella could not 
remember his name for the longest time and called him "Stevie" for a while, 
jokingly, even after he learned Scott's real name. According to Cubs play-by-play 
broadcaster Len Kasper, Piniella has since begun intentionally pronouncing 
his name "Stevie Aye-er."[citation needed] During a game against the Houston 
Astros on September 12, 2007, Eyre left the Cubs’ bullpen, and wandered 
around Minute Maid Park. WGN’s cameras eventually spotted him watching 
the game through an opening in the stadium’s score board.[6] On June 15, 
2008, in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Eyre allowed a 1-out sac 
fly run, ending his streak of 33 consecutive appearances without allowing 
a run, a Cubs franchise record. On August 5, 2008, Eyre was designated 
for assignment to make room for Kerry Wood, who was coming off the disabled 
list.[7] He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies two days later for 
Brian Schlitter.[8][9] However, the move allowed Eyre to win his first 
World Series ring when the Phillies won the 2008 World Series. In November, 
2008, following the World Series, Scott re-signed with the Phillies as 
a free-agent, and was signed through the 2009 season. On November 12, 2009, 
Eyre was granted free agency. On January 7, 2010, Scott Eyre retired from 
the MLB.[10] Eyre's brother, Willie, is also a Former pitcher in the major 
leagues. They also have another, younger brother, Robert Grace, who is 
playing in the minor league system of the San Francisco Giants. All three 
are pitchers. Eyre was one of the victims of the $8 billion fraud perpetrated 
by wealth manager Allen Stanford. In February 2009 Eyre admitted that he 
was broke and had to receive an advance on his salary from the Phillies.[11] 
Eyre publicly acknowledged that he has adult attention-deficit disorder.[12] 
Currently Eyre is the pitching coach for his kids high school baseball 
team in Bradenton, Florida. Last year (Spring of 2016) Eyre and former 
major leaguer Scott Sauerbeck (the head coach of the team) were able to 
improve the teams record to 15-5, which was a significant improvement for
