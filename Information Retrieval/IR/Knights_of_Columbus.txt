The Knights of Columbus is the world's largest Catholic fraternal service 
organization. Founded by Father Michael J. McGivney in New Haven, Connecticut, 
in 1882, it was named in honor of the mariner Christopher Columbus. Originally 
serving as a mutual benefit society to low-income immigrant Catholics, 
it developed into a fraternal benefit society dedicated to providing charitable 
services, promoting Catholic education and Catholic public policy positions, 
and actively defending Catholicism in various nations.[1][2][3] There are 
1,883,598 members[4] in nearly 15,000 councils,[5] with 302 councils on 
college campuses.[4] Membership is limited to "practical"[6] Catholic men 
aged 18 or older. Membership consists of four different degrees, each exemplifying 
a different principle of the Order. The Order is a member of the International 
Alliance of Catholic Knights.[7] Councils have been chartered in the United 
States (including the territories of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and 
Guam), Canada, the Philippines, Mexico, Poland, the Dominican Republic, 
Panama, the Bahamas, Cuba, Guatemala, Saipan, South Korea, Ukraine, Lithuania, 
and on US military bases around the world.[8] The Knights' official junior 
organization, the Columbian Squires, has over 5,000 circles and the Order's 
patriotic arm, the Fourth Degree, has more than 2,500 assemblies.[9] For 
their support for the Church and local communities, as well as for their 
philanthropic efforts, Pope John Paul II referred to the Order as a "strong 
right arm of the Church."[10] In 2015, the Order gave over US$175 million 
directly to charity and performed over 73.5 million man-hours of voluntary 
service.[11] Over 413,000 US pints (195,000 l; 344,000 imp pt) of blood 
were donated in 2010.[12] The Order's insurance program has more than 2 
million insurance contracts, totaling more than US$100 billion of life 
insurance in force. This is backed up by $21 billion in assets as of 2014.[5] 
Within the United States on the national and state level, the Order is 
active in the political arena lobbying for laws and positions that uphold 
the Catholic Church's positions on public policy and social issues. The 
Knights were founded during the Golden age of fraternalism in the United 
States. Michael J. McGivney, an Irish-American Catholic priest, founded 
the Knights of Columbus in New Haven, Connecticut. He gathered a group 
of men from St. Mary's Parish for an organizational meeting on October 
2, 1881, and the Order was incorporated under the laws of the state of 
Connecticut on March 29, 1882.[2] Although the first councils were all 
in that state, the Order spread throughout New England and the United States 
in subsequent years. By 1889, there were 300 councils comprising 40,000 
knights. Twenty years later, in 1909, there were 230,000 knights in 1,300 
councils.[13] The Order was intended as a mutual benefit society. These 
organizations, which combined social aspects and ritual were especially 
flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century, the so-called 
"Golden Age of Fraternalism.[14]" As a parish priest in an immigrant community, 
McGivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner 
died, and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans 
left behind. He also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care 
for his family when his father died.[15] However, Roman Catholics In the 
late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal 
organizations and other organized groups that provided social services[16] 
and papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics participating 
as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney wished to provide them an 
alternative. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism were not 
incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud 
of their American-Catholic heritage.[17] McGivney traveled to Boston to 
examine the Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to Brooklyn to 
learn about the recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of 
which offered insurance benefits. He found the latter to be lacking the 
excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with 
the secret societies of the day. He expressed an interest in establishing 
a New Haven Court of the Foresters, but the charter of Massachusetts Foresters 
prevented them from operating outside their Commonwealth. McGivney's committee 
of St. Mary's parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original.[18] 
The name of Columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to Anglo-Saxon 
Protestant leaders, who upheld the explorer (a Catholic Genovese Italian 
working for Catholic Spain) as an American hero, yet simultaneously sought 
to marginalize recent Catholic immigrants. In taking Columbus as their 
patron, they were expressing their belief that not only could Catholics 
be full members of American society, but were instrumental in its foundation.[19] 
McGivney had originally conceived of the name "Sons of Columbus", but James 
T. Mullen, who would become the first Supreme Knight, successfully suggested 
that "Knights of Columbus" would better capture the ritualistic nature 
of the new organization.[20] By the time of the first annual convention 
in 1884, the Order was prospering. The five councils throughout Connecticut 
had a total of 459 members. Groups from other states were requesting information.[21] 
The Charter of 1899 included four statements of purpose, including: "To 
promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall 
be desirable and proper, and by such lawful means as to them shall seem 
best."[22] The new charter showed members' desire to expand the organization 
beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society. The original insurance 
system devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death 
benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, and when the number 
of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the 
rate of increase.[23] Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. 
As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the 
course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older.[24] 
There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could 
not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 
weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars[25]). If he remained 
sick after that, the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of 
money given to him.[26] From the very early days of the Order, members 
wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members;[27] 
this issue was discussed at the National Meeting of 1899.[28] As early 
as 1886 Supreme Knight James T. Mullen had proposed a patriotic degree 
with its own symbolic dress.[29] The K of C established the Grand Cross 
of the Knights of Columbus but awarded it only to Cristobal Colón y de 
La Cerda, Duke of Veragua and descendant of Columbus, when he visited the 
US in 1893.[27] About 1,400 members attended the first exemplification 
of the Fourth Degree at the Lenox Lyceum in New York on February 22, 1900.[27][28] 
The event was infused with Catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that 
"celebrated American Catholic heritage".[30] The two knights leading the 
ceremony, for example, were the Expositor of the Constitution and the Defender 
of the Faith.[30] The ritual soon spread to other cities.[27] The new Fourth 
Degree members returned to their councils, forming assemblies composed 
of members from several councils. Those assemblies chose the new members.[31] 
In 1903, the Board of Directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying 
patriotism Order-wide, using the New York City model.[27] There was from 
early on a "desire to receive within its ranks only the best", and each 
candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest 
attesting that he had received Holy Communion within the past two weeks.[32] 
Not long after the establishment of the Fourth Degree, during the nadir 
of American race relations, a bogus oath was circulated claiming that Fourth 
Degree Knights swore to exterminate Freemasons and Protestants, as well 
as flay, burn alive, boil, kill, and otherwise torture anyone, including 
women and children, when called upon to do so by church authorities.[33][34] 
"It is a strange paradox", according to some commentators, that the degree 
devoted to patriotism should be accused of anti-Americanism.[35] The "bogus 
oath" was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the Jesuits more 
than three centuries earlier.[36] The Ku Klux Klan, which was growing into 
a powerful force through the 1920s, spread the bogus oath far and wide 
as part of their campaign against Catholics.[37][38][39] During the 1928 
Presidential election, the Klan printed and distributed a million copies 
of the oath in an effort to defeat Catholic Democratic candidate Al Smith. 
Thomas S. Butler, US Representative from Pennsylvania, read it into the 
Congressional Record.[40] The bogus oath was refuted by the Committee of 
Public Information, a war-time propaganda agency of the US Government.[35] 
Misunderstanding Catholicism, the Klan alleged that Knights were only loyal 
to the Pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the United States 
government.[41] Across the country, local, state, and the Supreme Councils 
offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath 
was authentic.[42] No one could, but that did not stop the Klan from continuing 
to publish and distribute copies. Numerous state councils and the Supreme 
Council believed that this "violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated 
by mercenary motives", and that publication would stop if fines were imposed 
and jail time assessed; they began suing distributors for libel.[41] This 
caused an end to such publication. As the Order did not wish to appear 
motivated by a "vengeful spirit", it asked for leniency from judges when 
sentencing offenders.[41] To help combat this misconception of what the 
Fourth Degree was about, the actual oath taken by Fourth Degree members 
was submitted to various groups of prominent non-Catholic men around the 
country for them to examine. Many made public declarations attesting to 
the loyalty and patriotism of the Knights.[43] After examining the true 
oath, a committee of high-ranking California Freemasons, a group singled 
out for violence in the bogus oath, declared in 1914: The ceremonial of 
the Order [of the Knights of Columbus] teaches a high and noble patriotism, 
instills a love of country, inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds 
up the Constitution of our Country as the richest and most precious possession 
of a Knight of the Order.[44] After World War I, many Americans had a revival 
of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about "foreign" 
values; they expected public schools to teach children to be American. 
Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common 
American culture, and in 1922, the voters of Oregon passed the Oregon Compulsory 
Education Act. The law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, 
including Catholic schools.[45][46] It was promoted by groups such as the 
Knights of Pythias, the Federation of Patriotic Societies, the Oregon Good 
Government League, the Orange Order, and the Ku Klux Klan.[47] The Compulsory 
Education Act required almost all children in Oregon between eight and 
sixteen years of age to attend public school by 1926.[47] Roger Nash Baldwin, 
an associate director of the ACLU and a personal friend of then-Supreme 
Advocate and future Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart, offered to join forces 
with the Order to challenge the law. The Knights of Columbus pledged an 
immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to 
defeat it.[48] The case became known as Pierce v. Society of Sisters, a 
seminal United States Supreme Court decision that significantly expanded 
coverage of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. In a unanimous 
decision, the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, 
not the state, had the authority to educate children as they thought best.[49] 
In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States, a lingering 
anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence 
was prevalent throughout the country. To combat the animus targeted at 
racial and religious minorities, including Catholics, the Order formed 
a historical commission which published a series of books, among other 
activities. The "Knights of Columbus Racial Contributions Series" of books 
included three titles: The Gift of Black Folk, by W. E. B. Du Bois, The 
Jews in the Making of America by George Cohen, and The Germans in the Making 
of America by Frederick Schrader.[50] As the 20th century progressed, some 
councils in the United States became integrated, but many were not. Church 
officials and organizations encouraged integration. By the end of the 1950s, 
Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart was actively encouraging councils to accept 
black candidates.[51] In 1963, Hart attended a special meeting at the White 
House hosted by President John F. Kennedy to discuss civil rights with 
other religious leaders. A few months later, a Notre Dame alumnus' application 
was rejected by a local council because he was black. Six council officers 
resigned in protest, and the incident made national news. Hart declared 
that the process for membership would be revised at the next Supreme Convention, 
but died before he could see it take place.[52] The 1964 Supreme Convention 
was scheduled to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans. A few days 
before the Convention, new Supreme Knight John W. McDevitt learned the 
hotel only admitted white guests and immediately threatened to move to 
another venue. The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order. The Convention 
amended the admissions rule to require one-third of those voting to reject 
a new member. In 1972 the Supreme Convention amended its rules again, requiring 
a majority of members voting to reject a candidate.[53] In 1997, the cause 
for McGivney's canonization was opened in the Archdiocese of Hartford, 
and then was placed before the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 
2000. The Father Michael J. McGivney Guild was formed in 1997 to promote 
his cause and currently has more than 140,000 members.[54] Membership in 
the Knights of Columbus does not automatically make one a member of the 
guild, nor is membership restricted to Knights; members must elect to join. 
On March 15, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI approved a decree recognizing McGivney's 
"heroic virtue", significantly advancing the priest's process toward sainthood. 
McGivney may now be referred to as the "Venerable Servant of God". If the 
cause is successful, he would be the first priest born in the United States 
to be canonized as a saint.[55] The Order is dedicated to the principles 
of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism. A First Degree exemplification 
ceremony, by which a man joins the Order, explicates the virtue of charity. 
He is then said to be a First Degree Knight of Columbus; after participating 
the subsequent degrees, each of which focuses on another virtue, he rises 
to that status. Upon reaching the Third Degree, a gentleman is a full member. 
Priests do not participate directly in Degree exemplifications as laymen 
do, but rather take the degree by observation.[citation needed] The first 
ritual handbook was printed in 1885, but contained only sections teaching 
Unity and Charity.[56] Supreme Knight Mullen, along with primary ritual 
author Daniel Colwell, believed that the initiation ceremony should be 
held in three sections "in accord with the 'Trinity of Virtues, Charity, 
Unity, and Brotherly love'".[56] The third section, expounding Fraternity, 
was officially adopted in 1891.[56] After taking their third degree, knights 
are eligible to receive their fourth degree, the primary purpose of which 
is to foster the spirit of patriotism and to encourage active Catholic 
citizenship. Fourth degree members, in addition to being members of their 
individual councils, are also members of Fourth Degree assemblies which 
typically comprise members of several councils. As of 2013[update], there 
were 3,109 assemblies worldwide.[57] Fewer than 18% of Knights join the 
Fourth Degree, which is optional, and whose members are referred to as 
"Sir Knight". Of a total 1,703,307 Knights in 2006, there were 292,289 
Fourth Degree Knights.[9] This number increased to 335,132 in 2013.[57] 
A waiting period of one year from the time the third degree was taken was 
eliminated in 2013, and now any Third Degree Knight is eligible to join 
the Fourth Degree.[57] A new Military Overseas Europe Special District 
was established in 2013 to oversee assemblies of military personnel serving 
on that continent.[57][58] Over 100 Department of Defense civilian employees 
and active-duty personnel based in Germany, Italy, and Britain took part 
in a special Fourth Degree Exemplification Ceremony at Ramstein Air Force 
Base in Germany in 2013,[57][58] and in that year exemplifications were 
also held in Camp Zama, Japan, and Yongsan Garrison in Seoul, Korea, where 
there are existing assemblies.[58] Knights volunteer at 136 of the 153 
Veteran's Affairs Medical Centers.[57] Fourth Degree Knights may optionally 
purchase and wear the full regalia and join an assembly's Color Corps. 
The Color Corps is the most visible arm of the Knights, as they are often 
seen in parades and other local events wearing their colorful regalia. 
Official dress for the Color Corps is a black tuxedo, baldric, white gloves, 
cape, and naval chapeau. In warm climates and during warm months, a white 
dinner jacket may be worn, if done as a unit.[59] Baldrics are worn from 
the right shoulder to left hip and are color specific by nation. In the 
United States, Panama, and the Philippines, baldrics are red, white, and 
blue. Red and white baldrics are used in Canada and Poland; red, white, 
and green in Mexico; and blue and white in Guatemala.[60] Service baldrics 
include a scabbard for a sword and are worn over the coat while social 
baldrics are worn under the coat.[60] The colors on a Fourth Degree Knight's 
cape and chapeau denote the office he holds within the Degree. Faithful 
Navigators and Past Faithful Navigators are permitted to carry a white 
handled silver sword. Masters and Vice Supreme Masters, as well as Former 
Masters and Former Vice Supreme Masters, are also denoted by their gold 
swords.[59] Charity is the foremost principle of the Knights of Columbus. 
In 2013, the Order gave more than $170.1 million directly to charity and 
performed over 70.5 million man hours in volunteer service. According to 
Independent Sector, this service has a value of more than $1.6 billion. 
The total charitable contributions, from the past decade, ending December 
31, 2013 rose to $13.8 Billion. Finally in 2013, Knights of Columbus, on 
an average per member basis, donated $91.80 and contributed 38 hours of 
community service.[61] More than $1.2 million were donated to Habitat for 
Humanity in 2012, in addition to 1.4 million volunteer hours.[57] Over 
42,000 winter coats were distributed in 2012 to children in cold weather 
areas as well.[57] The very first ever national blood drive was sponsored 
by the Order in 1938.[57] In 2012, council blood drives attracted more 
than 423,000 donors.[57] United in Charity, a general, unrestricted endowment 
fund, was introduced at the 2004 Supreme Council meeting to support and 
ensure the overall long-term charitable and philanthropic goals of the 
Order. The fund is wholly managed, maintained, and operated by Knights 
of Columbus Charities, Inc., a 501(c)(8) charitable organization.[62] Before 
United in Charity was formed, all requests for funds were met with the 
general funds of the Order or in combination with specific appeals.[63] 
The Vicarius Christi Fund has an endowment of $20 million and has earned 
more than $35 million since its establishment in 1981 for the Pope's personal 
charities. The Knights' Satellite Uplink Program has provided funding to 
broadcast a number of papal events, including the annual Easter and Christmas 
Masses, as well as the World Day of Peace in Assisi, World Youth Days, 
the opening of the Holy Door at St. Peter's Basilica for the Millennial 
Jubilee, Pope John Paul II's visit to Nazareth, and several other events. 
In missionary territories the Order also pays for the satellite downlink.[65] 
The Order also has eleven separate funds totaling $18 million to assist 
men and women who are discerning religious vocations pay tuition and other 
expenses.[66] The multimillion-dollar Pacem in Terris Fund aids the Catholic 
Church's efforts for peace in the Middle East. In 2012, $1.8 million was 
given by state and local councils to seminaries, with an additional $5.9 
million in direct assistance to seminarians.[57] A further $20 million 
went to church facilities and $7.4 million to Catholic schools from state 
and local councils.[57] The Knights have a tradition of supporting those 
with physical and developmental disabilities. More than $382 million has 
been given over the past three decades to groups and programs that support 
the intellectually and physically disabled,[9] with $4.1 million donated 
in 2012 alone.[57] One of the largest recipients of funds in this area 
is the Special Olympics.[57] In 2012, there were more than 107,000 Knights 
who donated 315,000 hours of service at nearly 20,000 Special Olympics 
events.[57] Individual councils donated $3.7 million to the Special Olympics 
in 2013.[57] The Order's support for the Special Olympics goes back to 
the very first games in 1968.[57] In 2012, more than 5,000 wheelchairs 
were distributed in 10 countries in a partnership with the Global Wheelchair 
Mission.[57] Aside from their other charitable activities, The Knights 
of Columbus gave significant charitable contributions to the people of 
Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in January 2010. The 
Order also donated 1,000 wheelchairs to the people of Haiti in partnership 
with the Global Wheelchair Mission.[67] Recognizing that the need was still 
great in Haiti some seven months after the disaster, the Knights of Columbus 
partnered with Project Medishare in August 2010 for an initiative entitled, 
"Healing Haiti's Children". The initiative, backed by a more than $2.5 
million commitment from the Knights of Columbus provides free prosthetic 
limbs and a minimum of two years of rehab to every child who suffered an 
amputation from injuries sustained during the earthquake.[57][68] As of 
2013[update], more than 800 children had already been aided by the program.[57] 
After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a local council in Newtown, 
Connecticut, established a program asking people to pray a minimum of three 
Hail Marys for the victims and their families. Over 100,000 people pledged 
to say 3.25 million prayers.[57] More than $500,000 was donated to Hurricane 
Sandy relief efforts, and $202,000 to victims of the April 2012 tornadoes 
in Oklahoma.[57] After West Fertilizer Company explosion in Texas, nearly 
a quarter of a million dollars were raised.[57] In total, more than $3.3 
million were donated by individual councils for disaster relief in 2012.[57] 
The Order offers a modern, professional insurance operation with more than 
$100 billion of life insurance policies in force and $19.8 billion in assets 
as of June 2013[update],[69] a figure more than double the 2000 levels.[57][69] 
Nearly 80,000 life certificates were issued in 2013, almost 30,000 more 
than the Order's closest competitor, to bring the total to 1.73 million.[57] 
The program has a $1.8 billion surplus.[57] Over $286 million in death 
benefits were paid in 2012 and $1.7 billion were paid between 2000 and 
2010.[57] This is large enough to rank 49th on the A. M. Best list of all 
life insurance companies in North America.[70] Since the founding of the 
Order, $3.5 billion in death benefits have been paid.[71] Premiums in 2012 
were nearly $1.2 billion, and dividends paid out totaled more than $274 
million.[57] Over the same time period, annuity deposits rose 4.2%, compared 
to an 8% loss for the industry as a whole.[57] Every day in 2012 more than 
$10 million was invested, for a total of $2.7 billion on the year, and 
an annual income of $905 million.[57] The Order maintains a two prong investment 
strategy. A company must first be a sound investment before stock in it 
is purchased, and secondly the company's activities must not conflict with 
Catholic social teaching.[57] The Order also provides mortgages to churches 
and Catholic schools at "very competitive rates" through its ChurchLoan 
program.[57] Products include permanent and term life insurance, as well 
as annuities, long term care insurance, and disability insurance.[69] The 
insurance program is not a separate business offered by the Order to others 
but is exclusively for the benefit of members and their families.[72] According 
to the Fortune 1000 list, the Knights of Columbus ranked 900 in total revenue 
in 2011[73] and, with 1,504 agents, was 909th in size in 2013.[57] All 
agents are members of the Order.[citation needed] The Order's insurance 
program is the most highly rated program in North America.[57] For 38 consecutive 
years, the Order has received A. M. Best's highest rating, A++.[57][74] 
Only two other insurers in North America have received the highest ratings 
from both A. M. Best and Standard & Poor's. Additionally, the Order is 
certified by the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association for ethical 
sales practices.[9] Standard & Poor's downgraded the insurance program's 
financial strength/credit rating from AAA to AA+ in August 2011 not due 
to the Order's financial strength, but due to its lowering of the long-term 
sovereign credit rating of the United States to AA+.[75][76][nb 1] Additionally, 
the insurance program has a low 3.5% lapse rate of the 1.7 million members 
and their families who are insured.[57][69] As of 2013[update] there were 
1,843,587 knights, and membership has grown each year for 41 consecutive 
years. Each member belongs to one of 14,606 councils around the world. 
In the 2012 fraternal year, 229 new councils were established, including 
two in the Ukraine, eight in Mexico, 10 in Poland, 13 in Canada, 80 in 
the Philippines, and 117 in the United States. In addition, there is a 
"round table"[nb 2] presence in Lithuania.[57] Knights of Columbus councils, 
Fourth Degree assemblies, and Columbian Squire circles have similar officers. 
In the councils, officer titles are prefixed with "Worthy", while in assemblies 
officer titles are prefixed with "Faithful". In addition to the Columbian 
Squires' officers listed below, there is an adult position of "Chief Counselor" 
that helps oversee the circle.[77] (*Appointed annually by each council's 
Grand Knight or assembly's Navigator) (**Appointed for a 3-year term by 
the Supreme Knight) The Supreme Council is the governing body of the Order 
and is composed of elected representatives from each jurisdiction. In a 
manner similar to shareholders at an annual meeting, the Supreme Council 
elects seven members each year to the Supreme Board of Directors for three-year 
terms. The twenty-one member board then chooses from its own membership 
the senior operating officials of the Order, including the Supreme Knight.[78] 
Fourth degree members belong to one of 3,109 assemblies, including 75 created 
in 2012.[57] The first assembly in Europe was established in 2012,[57] 
and in 2013 a new assembly for Boston-area college councils was created 
at Harvard University.[79] As of 2013[update] there were 335,132 Fourth 
Degree members, including 15,709 who joined the ranks of the Patriotic 
Degree the year before.[57] In 1898, Keane Council 353 was established 
at The Catholic University of America, though in later years it moved off 
campus.[80][nb 3] The University of Notre Dame Council 1477 was founded 
in 1910,[81] and was followed by the councils at Saint Louis University 
and Benedictine College.[82] In 1919, Mount St. Mary's College and Seminary 
Council 1965 became the first council attached to a college and seminary, 
at what is now Mount St. Mary's University.[83][84] In each autumn since 
1966, the Supreme Council has hosted a College Council Conference at their 
headquarters in New Haven, Connecticut.[85] Awards are given for the greatest 
increases in membership, the best Youth, Community, Council, Family, and 
Church activities, and the overall Outstanding College Council of the year. 
The most recent winner of the Outstanding College Council Award was The 
Catholic University of America Council.[86] Since its founding, the Knights 
of Columbus has been involved in evangelization. In 1948, the Knights started 
the Catholic Information Service (CIS) to provide low-cost Catholic publications 
for the general public as well as for parishes, schools, retreat houses, 
military installations, correctional facilities, legislatures, the medical 
community, and for individuals who request them. Since then, CIS has printed 
millions of booklets, and thousands of people have enrolled in CIS correspondence 
and on-line courses.[87] The Order sponsors a number of international awards. 
The first, the Gaudium et Spes Award, is named after the document from 
the Second Vatican Council, and is the highest honor bestowed by the Order. 
It "is awarded only in special circumstances and only to individuals of 
exceptional merit" and comes an honorarium of $100,000.[88] Since its institution 
in 1992, it has only been awarded five times. The award "recognizes individuals 
for their exemplary contributions to the realization of the message of 
faith and service in the spirit of Christ as articulated in the document 
for which it is named".[88] The second international award, also only given 
"when merited", is the Caritas Award. Named for the theological virtue 
alternatively translated as either charity or love, it recognizes "extraordinary 
works of charity and service". It has been awarded once since its establishment 
in 2013.[89] The Saint Michael Award was established in conjunction with 
the Caritas Award to recognize members of the Order who have exemplified 
a lifetime of service on behalf of the Knights of Columbus.[89] Additionally, 
at its annual convention each year, the Order recognizes other individuals 
and councils with awards. These include the Family of the Year award, and 
prizes for the best activities in the categories of church, community, 
council, culture of life, family, and youth. Additionally, top selling 
general and field insurance agents are recognized, as are top recruiting 
individuals and councils.[89] While the Knights of Columbus support political 
awareness and activity, United States councils are prohibited by tax laws 
from engaging in candidate endorsement and partisan political activity 
due to their non-profit status.[90] Public policy activity is limited to 
issue-specific campaigns, typically dealing with Catholic family and life 
issues. The Order has adopted resolutions advocating a Culture of Life,[91] 
defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman,[92] in defense 
of religious liberty,[93] and promoting faithful citizenship.[94] In 1926, 
a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with President Calvin Coolidge 
to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in 
Mexico. The Order subsequently launched a $1 million campaign to educate 
Americans about the attacks on Catholics and the Church in the Cristero 
War.[95] Twenty-five martyrs from the conflict would eventually be canonized, 
including six knights.[96] Several decades later, in 1954, lobbying by 
the Order helped convince the U.S. Congress to add the phrase "under God" 
to the Pledge of Allegiance. President Dwight Eisenhower wrote to Supreme 
Knight Luke E. Hart thanking the Knights for their "part in the movement 
to have the words 'under God' added to our Pledge of Allegiance".[97] Similar 
lobbying convinced many state legislatures to adopt October 12 as Columbus 
Day and led to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's confirmation of Columbus 
Day as a federal holiday in 1937.[98] On April 9, 2006, the Board of Directors 
commented on the "U.S. immigration policy [which] has become an intensely 
debated and divisive issue on both sides of the border between the U.S. 
and Mexico". They called "upon the President and the U.S. Congress to agree 
upon immigration legislation that not only gains control over the process 
of immigration, but also rejects any effort to criminalize those who provide 
humanitarian assistance to illegal immigrants, and provides these immigrants 
an avenue by which they can emerge from the shadows of society and seek 
legal residency and citizenship in the U.S.".[99] The Knights have also 
been active in political campaigns across the United States in the area 
of gay marriage, contributing over $14 million to help maintain the definition 
of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In 2008, they were 
the largest single donor in support of Proposition 8. A financial contribution 
of over $1 million was made to support the successful initiative to define 
marriage within the California State Constitution as a union solely between 
a man and a woman.[100][101] The Knights have also made financial contributions 
of $1 million to support similar ballot campaigns in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, 
and Washington.[3][102] In a 2005 attempt to stop the Canadian parliament 
from legalizing gay marriage, the Order funded a campaign that included 
800,000 postcards encouraging members of parliament to reject the measure.[103] 
As it was in the United States, this effort was criticized by some gay 
marriage supporters. Also in 2005, a local Knights of Columbus council 
in Canada was fined $2,000 by the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal.[104] 
The council's Hall Manager signed a contract for the use of their facilities 
with Tracey Smith and Deborah Chymyshyn, but canceled it and returned their 
money after they became aware that it was for a lesbian wedding reception.[104] 
The tribunal found that the local council did not have to rent the hall 
if in so doing they would violate their religious beliefs, but "could have 
taken additional steps that would have recognized the inherent dignity 
of the complainants and their right to be free from discrimination". Instead 
of simply canceling the appointment, the court said, the council could 
have directed the complainants to other halls and assisted them in finding 
another place to hold their event.[104] Following the Mexican Revolution, 
the new government began persecuting the Church. To destroy the Church's 
influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted 
into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics which 
resulted in the death of thousands, including several knights who were 
later canonized.[105] Leaders of the Order began speaking out against the 
Mexican government, and Columbia, the official magazine of the Knights, 
also ran articles critical of the regime. The November 1926 cover of Columbia 
portrayed Knghts carrying a banner of liberty and warning of "The Red Peril 
of Mexico", the Mexican legislature banned both the Order and the magazine 
throughout the country.[106] The Knights of Columbus invites the head of 
state of every country they operate in to the Supreme Convention each year.[107] 
In 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon gave the keynote address at the States 
Dinner; Secretary of Transportation and Knight John Volpe was responsible 
for this first appearance of a U.S. President at a Supreme Council gathering.[108] 
President Ronald Reagan spoke at the Centennial Convention in 1982.[95] 
President George H.W. Bush appeared in 1992. President Bill Clinton sent 
a written message while he was in office, and President George W. Bush 
sent videotaped messages before he attended in person at the 2004 convention.[109] 
President Barack Obama has also sent written messages during his term in 
office.[110] John F. Kennedy, the only Catholic to be elected President 
of the United States, was a Fourth Degree member of Bunker Hill Council 
No. 62 and Bishop Cheverus General Assembly. Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart 
visited Kennedy at the White House on Columbus Day, 1961. The president 
told Hart that his younger brother, Ted Kennedy, had received "his Third 
Degree in our Order three weeks before". Hart presented Kennedy with a 
poster of the American Flag with the story of how the Order got the words 
"under God" inserted in the Pledge of Allegiance.[111] In 1959, Fidel Castro 
sent an aide to represent him at a Fourth Degree banquet in honor of the 
Golden Jubilee of the Order's entry into Cuba. Supreme Knight Hart attended 
a banquet in the Cuban Prime Minister's honor in April of that year sponsored 
by the Overseas Press Club and later sent him a letter expressing regret 
that they were not able to meet in person.[112] Reagan also presented the 
Order with a President's Volunteer Action Award at the White House in 1984.[95] 
The Knights of Columbus were among the groups that welcomed Pope Benedict 
XVI on the South Lawn of the White House on April 16, 2008, the pontiff's 
81st birthday, during his visit to the U.S.[113] Many famous Catholic men 
from all over the world have been Knights of Columbus. In the United States, 
some of the most notable include John F. Kennedy; Ted Kennedy;[111] Al 
Smith;[115] Sargent Shriver;[116] Samuel Alito; John Boehner;[117] Ray 
Flynn;[118] Jeb Bush;[119] and Sergeant Major Daniel Daly,[120] a two-time 
Medal of Honor recipient, once described by the commandant of the U.S. 
Marine Corps as "the most outstanding Marine of all time".[121] Many notable 
clerics are also Knights, including Cardinal William Joseph Levada, prefect 
of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith; Cardinal Sean O'Malley, 
Archbishop of Boston; and Cardinal Jaime Sin, former Archbishop of Manila. 
In the world of sports, Vince Lombardi, the famed former coach of the Green 
Bay Packers;[122] wrestler Lou Albano;[123] James Connolly, the first Olympic 
gold-medal champion in modern times;[124] Floyd Patterson, former heavyweight 
boxing champion;[125] and baseball legend Babe Ruth[126] were all knights. 
On October 15, 2006, Bishop Rafael Guizar Valencia (1878–1938) was canonized 
by Pope Benedict XVI in Rome. In 2000, six other Knights were declared 
saints by Pope John Paul II.[127] The emblem of the Order was designed 
by Past Supreme Knight James T. Mullen and adopted at the second Supreme 
Council meeting on May 12, 1883. Shields used by medieval knights served 
as the inspiration, and the emblem consists of a shield mounted on a Formée 
cross, which is an artistic representation of the cross of Christ. This 
represents the Catholic identity of the Order.[128] Mounted on the shield 
are three objects: a fasces; an anchor; and a dagger. In ancient Rome, 
the fasces was carried before magistrates as an emblem of authority. The 
Order uses it as "symbolic of authority which must exist in any tightly-bonded 
and efficiently operating organization".[128] The anchor represents Christopher 
Columbus, patron of the Order. The short sword, or dagger, was a weapon 
used by medieval knights. The shield as a whole, with the letters "K of 
C", represents "Catholic Knighthood in organized merciful action".[128] 
The Fourth Degree emblem features a dove, a cross, and a globe. In the 
tradition of the Knights these symbols "typify the union of the three Divine 
Persons in one Godhead, referred to as the most Blessed Trinity".[128] 
The red, white, and blue are taken from the American flag and represent 
patriotism, the basic principle of the Fourth Degree. Styled with the continents 
of the western hemisphere in white, the blue globe represents God the Father. 
A red Isabella cross, for the queen who sponsored Columbus, serves as a 
symbol of God the Son. The white dove is a symbol of peace and God the 
Holy Spirit. Columbus' name in Italian (Colombo) also means "dove".[128] 
The emblem of the Squires symbolizes the ideals which identify a squire. 
On the arms of a Maltese cross are the letters "P", which represents the 
physical development necessary to make the body as strong as the spirit; 
"I", which stands for the intellectual development needed for cultural 
and mental maturity; "S", which represents the spiritual growth and practice 
of our faith; and "C", which stands for the development of citizenship 
and civic life. The larger letters: "C", representing Christ and also Christopher 
Columbus; "S", the Squires; and "K", the Knights of Columbus, by whom the 
Squires program is sponsored, are intertwined in the center of the cross. 
They are the three foundations of the program.[citation needed] The Latin 
motto, "Esto Dignus", encircles the emblem. Translated into English, it 
means "Be Worthy". Many councils also have women's auxiliaries.[129] At 
the turn of the 20th century two were formed by local councils and each 
took the name the Daughters of Isabella.[130] Using the same name, both 
groups expanded and issued charters to other circles but never merged. 
The newer organization renamed itself the Catholic Daughters of the Americas 
in 1921 and both have structures independent of the Knights of Columbus.[131] 
Other groups are known as the Columbiettes. In the Philippines, the ladies' 
auxiliary is known as the Daughters of Mary Immaculate.[132] The Knights' 
official junior organization is the Columbian Squires. Founded in 1925 
in Duluth, Minnesota, this international fraternity for boys 10–18 has 
grown to over 5,000 circles.[133] According to Brother Barnabas McDonald, 
F.S.C., the Squires' founder: "The supreme purpose of the Columbian Squires 
is character building."[77] Squires have fun and share their Catholic faith, 
help people in need, and enjoy the company of friends in social, family, 
athletic, cultural, civic and spiritual activities. Through their local 
circle, Squires work and socialize as a group of friends, elect their own 
officers, and develop into Catholic leaders.[134] When Squires process 
in a color guard, they wear blue cape, similar to those worn by members 
of the Fourth Degree, and black berets.[135] Each circle is supervised 
by a Knights of Columbus council or assembly, and has an advisory board 
made up of either the Grand Knight, the Deputy Grand Knight and Chaplain, 
or the Faithful Navigator, the Faithful Captain, and Faithful Friar.[77] 
Circles are either council based, parish based, or school based, depending 
on the location of the circle and the Knight counselors.[77] The Squire 
Roses are a youth sorority run by individual state councils for Catholic 
girls between the ages of 10 and 19. Founded by Russell DeRose and the 
Virginia State Council of the Knights of Columbus in 1996, the Roses are 
a sister organization to the Squires.[136] The Knights of Columbus is a 
member of the International Alliance of Catholic Knights, which includes 
fifteen fraternal orders such as the Knights of Saint Columbanus in Ireland, 
the Knights of Saint Columba in the United Kingdom, the Knights of Peter 
Claver in the United States, the Knights of the Southern Cross in Australia 
and New Zealand, the Knights of Marshall in Ghana, the Knights of Da Gama 
in South Africa, and the Knights of Saint Mulumba in Nigeria.[7] The Loyal 
Orange Institution, also known as the Orange Order, is a similar organization
