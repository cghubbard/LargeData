The Philadelphia Phillies are an American professional baseball franchise 
based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They are the oldest continuous, one-name, 
one-city franchise in all of professional American sports, dating back 
to 1883.[2] The Phillies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member 
club of the National League (NL) East division. Since 2004, the team's 
home has been Citizens Bank Park, located in South Philadelphia. The Phillies 
have won two World Series championships (against the Kansas City Royals 
in 1980 and the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008) and seven National League pennants, 
the first of which came in 1915. The franchise has also experienced long 
periods of struggle. Since the first modern World Series was played in 
1903, the Phillies played 77 consecutive seasons (and 97 seasons from the 
club's establishment) before they won their first World Series—longer than 
any other of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues for the first 
half of the 20th century. The 77 season drought is the fourth longest World 
Series drought in Major League Baseball history. The longevity of the franchise 
and its history of adversity have earned it the dubious distinction of 
having lost the most games of any team in the history of American professional 
sports.[3] Despite the team's lack of success historically, they are one 
of the more successful franchises since the start of the Divisional Era 
in Major League Baseball. The Phillies have won their division 11 times, 
which ranks 6th among all teams and 4th in the National League, including 
five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011. The franchise was founded 
in Philadelphia in 1883, replacing the team from Worcester, Massachusetts 
in the National League. The team has played at several stadiums in the 
city, beginning with Recreation Park and continuing at Baker Bowl; Shibe 
Park, which was later renamed Connie Mack Stadium in honor of the longtime 
Philadelphia Athletics manager; Veterans Stadium; and now Citizens Bank 
Park. The team's spring training facilities are located in Clearwater, 
Florida, where its Class-A minor league affiliate Clearwater Threshers 
plays at Bright House Field. Its Double-A affiliate is the Reading Fightin 
Phils, which plays in Reading, Pennsylvania, and its Triple-A affiliate 
is the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, which plays in Allentown, Pennsylvania. 
After being founded in 1883 as the "Quakers", the team changed its name 
to the "Philadelphias", after the convention of the times. This was soon 
shortened to "Phillies".[4] "Quakers" continued to be used interchangeably 
with "Phillies" from 1883 until 1890, when the team officially became known 
as the "Phillies". Though the Phillies moved into a permanent home at Baker 
Bowl in 1887,[2] they did not win their first pennant until nearly 30 years 
later, after the likes of standout players Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, 
and Ed Delahanty had departed. Player defections to the newly formed American 
League, especially to the cross-town Philadelphia Athletics, would cost 
the team dearly over the next several years. A bright spot came in 1915, 
when the Phillies won their first pennant, thanks to the pitching of Grover 
Cleveland Alexander and the batting prowess of Gavvy Cravath, who set what 
was then the modern major-league single-season record for home runs with 
24.[5] Poor fiscal management after their appearance in the 1915 World 
Series, however, doomed the Phillies to sink back into relative obscurity; 
from 1918 to 1948 they only had one winning season. Though Chuck Klein 
won the Most Valuable Player Award in 1932 and the National League Triple 
Crown in 1933, the team continued to flounder at the bottom of the standings 
for years.[6] After lumber baron William B. Cox purchased the team in 1943, 
the Phillies rose out of the standings cellar for the first time in five 
years. As a result, the fan base and attendance at home games increased. 
But it soon became clear that not all was right in Cox's front office. 
Eventually Cox revealed that he had been betting on the Phillies and he 
was banned from baseball. The new owner, Bob Carpenter, Jr., scion of the 
Delaware-based DuPont family, tried to polish the team's image by unofficially 
changing its name to the "Bluejays". However, the new moniker did not take, 
and it was quietly dropped by 1949.[7] Instead, Carpenter turned his attention 
to the minor league affiliates, continuing an effort begun by Cox a year 
earlier; prior to Cox's ownership, the Phillies had paid almost no attention 
to player development. This led to the advent of the "Whiz Kids", led by 
a lineup of young players developed by the Phillies' farm system that included 
future Hall of Famers Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts.[8] Their 1950 season 
was highlighted by a last-day, pennant-clinching home run by Dick Sisler[9] 
to lead the Phillies over the Brooklyn Dodgers and into the World Series, 
where they were swept by the New York Yankees, four games to none (although 
each game was close). In contrast, the Philadelphia Athletics finished 
last in 1950 and long-time manager Connie Mack retired. The team struggled 
on for four more years with only one winning season before abandoning Philadelphia 
under the Johnson brothers, who bought out Mack. They began play in Kansas 
City in 1955.[10] As part of the deal selling that team to the Johnson 
brothers, the Phillies bought Shibe Park, where both teams had played since 
1938.[8] Many thought that the Whiz Kids, with a young core of talented 
players, would be a force in the league for years to come.[11][12] However, 
it was not to be, as the team finished with a 73–81 record in 1951, and 
(except for 2nd-place tie in 1964) did not finish higher than third place 
again until 1975.[13] Their lack of success was partly blamed on Carpenter's 
unwillingness to integrate his team after winning a pennant with an all-white 
team. The Phillies were the last National League team to sign a black player, 
a full 10 years after Jackie Robinson made his debut for the Dodgers.[14] 
Their competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: 
in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in 
the majors since 1900. Though Ashburn and Roberts were gone, the 1964 Phillies 
still had younger pitchers Art Mahaffey, Chris Short, and rookie Ray Culp; 
veterans Jim Bunning and screwballer Jack Baldschun; and fan favorites 
Cookie Rojas, Johnny Callison, and NL Rookie of the Year Richie Allen. 
The team was 90-60 on September 20, good enough for a six-and-a-half-game 
lead in the pennant race with 12 games to play. However, the Phillies lost 
10 games in a row and finished one game out of first, losing the pennant 
to the St. Louis Cardinals. The "Phold of '64" is frequently mentioned 
as the worst collapse in sports history.[16] One highlight of the season 
occurred on Father's Day, when Jim Bunning pitched a perfect game against 
the New York Mets, the first in Phillies history.[17] At the end of the 
decade, in October 1970, the Phillies played their final game in Connie 
Mack Stadium and prepared to move into newly built Veterans Stadium, wearing 
new maroon uniforms to accentuate the change. While some members of the 
team performed admirably during the 1970s, the Phillies still clung to 
their position at the bottom of the National League standings. Ten years 
after "the Phold", they suffered another minor collapse in August and September 
1974, missing out on the playoffs yet again. But the futility would not 
last much longer. They had a run of three straight division titles from 
1976 to 1978.[18] That run was led by pitchers Steve Carlton, Gene Garber, 
outfielder Greg Luzinski, and infielders Mike Schmidt and Larry Bowa. The 
Phillies won the NL East in 1980 after the departure of Garber, but behind 
pitcher Steve Carlton, outfielder Greg Luzinski, and infielders Mike Schmidt, 
Larry Bowa, and recently acquired Pete Rose. In a memorable NLCS, with 
four of the five games going into extra innings, they fell behind 2–1 but 
battled back to squeeze past the Houston Astros on a tenth-inning, game-winning 
hit by center fielder Garry Maddox, and the city celebrated its first pennant 
in 30 years.[19] Facing the Kansas City Royals in the 1980 World Series, 
the Phillies won their first World Series championship ever in six games 
thanks to the timely hitting of Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose. Schmidt, who 
was the National League MVP that 1980 season, also won the World Series 
MVP award on the strength of his 8-for-21 hitting (.381 average), including 
game-winning hits in Game 2 and the clinching Game 6. This sixth, final 
game was also significant because it remains "the most-watched game in 
World Series history" with a television audience of 54.9 million viewers.[20] 
Thus, the Phillies became the last of the 16 teams that made up the major 
leagues from 1901 to 1961 to win a World Series.[21] After their Series 
win Ruly Carpenter, who was given control of the team in 1972 when his 
father stepped down as team president, sold the team to a group which was 
headed by long time Phillies executive Bill Giles for $32.5 million in 
1981. The Phillies would return to the playoffs that season, in which the 
season was split in half due to a players' strike. They were defeated in 
the first ever National League Division Series by the Montreal Expos in 
five games. Mike Schmidt won his second consecutive NL MVP award that year. 
In 1982 the team finished 3 games behind the St. Louis Cardinals in the 
East Division narrowly missing the playoffs. Steve Carlton would capture 
his fourth career NL Cy Young Award that year with 23 wins. For the 1983 
season the Phillies returned to the playoffs beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in the NLCS in four games to capture their fourth NL pennant. They lost 
to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series in 5 games. John Denny was 
named the 1983 NL Cy Young Award winner. Following their loss to the Orioles 
in the 1983 World Series the team would follow with near playoff misses 
and a rapid drop back into the basement of the National League over the 
next five seasons.[19] In 1989 Mike Schmidt retired from the Phillies and 
thus the last member of the 1980 championship team was gone. Over the next 
three seasons the Phillies would continue to miss the playoffs and finished 
dead last in the majors for the 1992 season. The 1993 Phillies started 
the season by going 17–5 in April and finishing with a 97–65 season. They 
beat the Atlanta Braves in the 1993 National League Championship Series, 
four games to two, to earn the fifth NL pennant in franchise history, only 
to be defeated by the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays 
in the 1993 World Series.[22] Toronto's Joe Carter hit a walk-off home 
run in Game 6 to clinch another Phillies loss.[23] The 1994–95 Major League 
Baseball strike was a blow to the Phillies' attendance and on-field success, 
as was the arrival of the Braves in the division due to league realignment. 
Several stars came through Philadelphia, though few would stay, and the 
minor league system continued to develop its young prospects, who would 
soon rise to Phillies fame. In 2001, the Phillies had their first winning 
season in eight years under new manager Larry Bowa, and their season record 
would not dip below .500 again from the 2003 season onward.[24] In 2004, 
the Phillies moved to their new home, Citizens Bank Park,[25] across the 
street from the Vet. Charlie Manuel took over the reins of the club from 
Bowa after the 2004 season, and general manager Ed Wade was replaced by 
Pat Gillick in November 2005. Gillick reshaped the club as his own, sending 
stars away in trades and allowing the Phillies' young core to develop. 
After the franchise lost its 10,000th game in 2007,[3] its core of young 
players, including infielders Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, and Jimmy Rollins 
and pitcher Cole Hamels, responded by winning the National League East 
division title, but they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the Division 
Series.[26] After the 2007 season, they acquired closer Brad Lidge. In 
2008, the Phillies clinched their second straight division title[27] and 
defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the Division Series to record the franchise's 
first post-season victory since winning the 1993 NLCS. Behind strong pitching 
from the rotation and stellar offensive production from virtually all members 
of the starting lineup, the Phillies won the 2008 National League Championship 
Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers; Hamels was named the series' Most 
Valuable Player. The Phillies would then go on to defeat the Tampa Bay 
Rays in 5 games for their second World Series title in their 126-year history. 
Hamels was named both NLCS MVP as well as World Series MVP after going 
4–0 in the postseason that year. Gillick retired as general manager after 
the 2008 season and was succeeded by one of his assistants, Rubén Amaro, 
Jr. After adding outfielder Raúl Ibañez to replace the departed Pat Burrell, 
the Phillies retained the majority of their core players for the 2009 season. 
In July, they signed three-time Cy Young Award winner Pedro Martínez and 
acquired 2008 American League Cy Young winner Cliff Lee before the trade 
deadline. On September 30, 2009, they clinched a third consecutive National 
League East Division title for the first time since the 1976–78 seasons. 
The team continued this run of success with wins over the Colorado Rockies 
in the NLDS (3 games to 1) and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS (4 games 
to 1), to become the first Phillies team to win back-to-back pennants and 
the first National League team since the 1996 Atlanta Braves to have an 
opportunity to defend their World Series title. The Phillies were unable 
to repeat the 2008 World Series victory. Although the Phillies won game 
1 of the Series in New York, they ultimately were defeated in the series 
by the New York Yankees, 4 games to 2. Nevertheless, in recognition of 
the team's recent accomplishments, Baseball America named the Phillies 
as its Organization of the Year.[28] On December 16, 2009, they acquired 
starting pitcher Roy Halladay from the Toronto Blue Jays for three minor-league 
prospects,[29] and traded Cliff Lee to the Seattle Mariners for three prospects.[30] 
On May 29, 2010, Halladay pitched a perfect game against the Florida Marlins.[d] 
In June 2010, the team's scheduled 2010 series against the Toronto Blue 
Jays at Rogers Centre was moved to Philadelphia, because of security concerns 
for the G-20 Summit. The Blue Jays wore their home white uniforms and batted 
last as the home team, and the designated hitter was used.[31] The game 
was the first occasion of the use of a designated hitter in a National 
League ballpark in a regular-season game; Ryan Howard was the first player 
to fill the role.[32] The 2010 Phillies won their fourth consecutive NL 
East Division championship[33][34] despite a rash of significant injuries 
to key players, including Ryan Howard,[35] Chase Utley,[36] Jimmy Rollins,[37] 
Shane Victorino,[38] and Carlos Ruiz.[39] After dropping seven games behind 
the Atlanta Braves on July 21, Philadelphia finished with an MLB-best record 
of 97–65.[40] The streak included a 20–5 record in September, the Phillies' 
best September since winning 22 games that month in 1983,[41] and an 11–0 
run in the middle of the month.[42] The acquisition of pitcher Roy Oswalt 
in early August was a key step, as Oswalt won seven consecutive games in 
just over five weeks from August 11 through September 17.[42] The Phillies 
clinched the division on September 27, behind a two-hit shutout by Halladay.[43] 
In Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series, Halladay threw the 
second no-hitter in Major League baseball postseason history, leading the 
Phillies over the Cincinnati Reds, 4–0. (The first was New York Yankee 
pitcher Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series.[44]) Halladay's 
no-hitter was the fifth time a pitcher has thrown two no-hitters in the 
same season, and was also the first time that one of the two occurred in 
the postseason. The Phillies went on to sweep the Reds in three straight 
games. In the 2010 National League Championship Series, the Phillies fell 
to the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants in six games. 
On September 17, 2011, the Phillies won their fifth consecutive East Division 
championship,[45] and on September 28, during the final game of the season, 
the team set a franchise record for victories in a season with 102 by beating 
the Atlanta Braves in 13 innings, denying their division rivals a potential 
wild card berth.[46] Yet the Phillies lost in the NLDS to the St. Louis 
Cardinals – the team that won the National League Wild Card as a result 
of the Phillies beating the Braves. The Cardinals subsequently beat the 
Brewers in the NLCS and won the 2011 World Series in 7 games. The 2012 
Phillies experienced an up and down season. They played .500 ball through 
the first two months, but then slumped through a 9–19 stretch in June where 
they ended up at the bottom of the NL East by midseason. With any hope 
dimming, the Phillies traded key players Shane Victorino and Joe Blanton 
to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Hunter Pence to the San Francisco Giants 
before the trade deadline. A hot start in the second half of the season 
put the Phillies back on the postseason hunt, but any hope was eventually 
extinguished with a loss to the Washington Nationals on September 28, costing 
the Phillies the postseason for the first time since 2006. During the 2013 
season, the team struggled again, and was unable to consistently play well 
for the majority of the season. On August 16, 2013, with the team's record 
at 53-68, the Phillies fired manager Charlie Manuel, who had managed the 
team since 2005.[47] Phillies third base coach, Ryne Sandberg, was promoted 
to Interim manager. Manuel spent over nine years as the manager, leading 
Philadelphia to its first World Series victory in nearly 30 years. Manuel 
amassed an overall record of 780-636, making him the manager with the most 
wins in the franchise's history. The 2013 Phillies ended up with a record 
of 73-89, their first losing season since 2002. In 2015 Sandberg resigned 
as manager and bench coach Pete Mackanin was brought in as interim manager. 
Also in 2015 general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. was fired and Andy McPhale 
was brought in as the interim GM.[citation needed] One of the few bright 
spots of the 2014 Phillies season happened on September 1 against division 
rival Atlanta Braves, when starter Cole Hamels, and relievers Jake Diekman, 
Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon combined for a no-hitter in Turner Field, 
for 7-0 victory over Atlanta. On June 16, 2015, veteran outfielder Jeff 
Francoeur was called in to pitch in an interleague game against the Baltimore 
Orioles in which the Orioles were winning 17-3 going into the seventh inning. 
Francoeur pitched two innings while giving up one hit, two runs (earned), 
three walks, and struck out one. The Phillies were forced to use Francoeur 
because they had used all other pitchers available for the night. On July 
25, 2015, in what would be his final start for the Phillies before being 
traded, Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs 5–0 at Wrigley Field, striking 
out 13 and only giving up two walks, both to Dexter Fowler and besting 
the Cubs' Jake Arrieta—himself a no-hit pitcher a month later, on August 
30 of that season.[48] It was the first no-hitter against the Cubs since 
Sandy Koufax's perfect game in 1965, and first at Wrigley since the Cubs' 
Milt Pappas in 1972.[49] On July 31, 2015 Cole Hamels was dealt to the 
Texas Rangers along with Jake Diekman and cash for Matt Harrison, Jerad 
Eickhoff, Jorge Alfaro, Nick Williams, Alec Asher, and Jake Thompson.[50][51] 
On October 14, Andy MacPhail was officially named the 17th President of 
Baseball Operations in Philadelphia Phillies history.[52] The current team 
colors, uniform, and logo date to 1992. The main team colors are red and 
white, with blue serving as a prominent accent. The team name is written 
in red with a blue star serving as the dot over the "i"s, and blue piping 
is often found in Phillies branded apparel and materials. The team's home 
uniform is white with red pinstripes, lettering and numbering. The road 
uniform is traditional grey with red lettering/numbering. Both bear a script-lettered 
"Phillies" logo, with the aforementioned star dotting the "i"s across the 
chest, and the player name and number on the back. Hats are red with a 
single stylized "P".[55] The uniforms and logo are very similar to those 
used during the "Whiz Kids" era from 1950 to 1969. The Phillies and their 
National League compadres, the St. Louis Cardinals, are the only teams 
in Major League baseball to utilize chain stitching in their chest emblem. 
In 2008, the Phillies introduced an alternate, cream-colored uniform during 
home day games in tribute to their 125th anniversary. The uniforms are 
similar to those worn from 1946 through 1949, featuring red lettering bordered 
with blue piping and lacking pinstripes.[56] The accompanying cap is blue 
with a red bill and a red stylized "P." The uniforms were announced on 
November 29, 2007, when Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins, pitcher Cole 
Hamels, and Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts modeled the new uniforms.[57] 
For the 2009 season the Phillies added black, circular "HK" patches to 
their uniforms over their hearts in honor of broadcaster Harry Kalas, who 
died April 13, 2009, just before he was to broadcast a Phillies game. From 
Opening Day through July 26, 2009, the Phillies wore 2008 World Champions 
patches on the right sleeve of their home uniforms. In 2010, the Phillies 
added a black patch with a white "36" on the sleeves of their jerseys to 
honor Roberts, who died on May 6. Roberts' No. 36 had been previously retired 
by the team. In 2011, the Phillies added a black circular patch with a 
'B' in honor of minority owners Alexander and John Buck, who died in late 
2010. In 2015, the Phillies added a black circular patch with a white "SLB" 
in memory of minority owner Sara L. Buck, who died on August 23, 2014. 
In 2016, the Phillies added a red alternate uniform to be used for mid-week 
afternoon games. The Phillies are one of four teams in Major League Baseball 
that do not display the name of their city, state, or region on their road 
jerseys, joining the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, St. Louis Cardinals, 
and the Tampa Bay Rays. The Phillies are the only team that also displays 
the player's number on one sleeve except on the alternate jersey, in addition 
to the usual placement on the back of the jersey. The Phillies were an 
early adopter of the batting practice jersey in 1977, wearing a maroon 
v-necked top with the "Phillies" script name across the chest, as well 
as the player name and number on the back and a player number on the left 
sleeve, all in white. Larry Bowa, Pete Rose, and Mike Schmidt wore this 
maroon batting jersey in place of their road jersey during the 1979 All-Star 
Game in Seattle. Currently, during spring training, the Phillies wear solid 
red practice jerseys with pinstriped pants for Grapefruit League home games. 
The red jerseys are worn with grey pants on the road. From 1970 to 1991, 
the Phillies sported colors, uniforms, and a logo that were noticeably 
different from what had come before, or since, but that were widely embraced 
by even traditionally minded fans. A dark burgundy was adopted as the main 
team color, with a classic pinstripe style for home uniforms. Blue was 
almost entirely dropped as part of the team's official color scheme, except 
in one area; a pale blue (as opposed to traditional grey) was used as the 
base-color for away game uniforms. Yet the most important aspect of the 
1970 uniform change was the adoption of one of the more distinctive logos 
in sports; a Phillies "P" that, thanks to its unique shape and "baseball 
stitched" center swirl, remained instantly recognizable and admired, long 
after its regular use had ended. It was while wearing this uniform style 
and color motif that the club achieved its most enduring success, including 
a World Series title in 1980 and another World Series appearance in 1983.[55] 
Its continued popularity with fans is still evident, as even today Phillies 
home games can contain many fans sporting caps, shirts, and/or jackets 
emblazoned with the iconic "P" and burgundy color scheme. The current Phillies 
team has worn the burgundy and powder blue throwbacks whenever their opponents 
are wearing throwback uniforms from that era. In 1979, the Phillies front 
office modified the uniform into an all-burgundy version with white trimmings, 
to be worn for Saturday games.[58] They were called "Saturday Night Specials" 
and were worn for the first and last time on May 19, 1979,[59] a 10–5 loss 
to the Expos.[60] The immediate reaction of the media, fans, and players 
alike was negative, with many describing the despised uniforms as pajama-like. 
As such, the idea was hastily abandoned.[61] Mike Schmidt did wear the 
uniform during the MLB All-Star Tour of Japan following the 1979 season. 
The final appearance on field (to date) of this uniform was during the 
closing ceremonies at Veterans Stadium on September 28, 2003. There was 
a rather large procession of players during the post game ceremony, most 
in uniform. Former pitcher Larry Christenson, the starting pitcher in the 
original game, came out wearing this old burgundy uniform, and was the 
only one to do so. Another uniform controversy arose in 1994 when the Phillies 
introduced blue caps on Opening Day which were to be worn for home day 
games only.[62] The caps were unpopular with the players, who considered 
them bad luck after two losses and wanted them discontinued. Management 
wanted to keep using the caps as planned, as they sold well among fans. 
A compromise was reached as the players agreed to wear them for weekday 
games while returning to the customary red caps for Sunday afternoon games.[63] 
In all, the Phillies wore the "unlucky" blue caps for seven games in 1994, 
losing six (the lone victory a 5-2 triumph over the Florida Marlins on 
June 29).[64] A different blue cap was introduced in 2008 as part of the 
alternate home uniform for day games, a throwback to the late 1940s. The 
rivalry between the New York Mets and the Phillies was said to be among 
the "hottest" rivalries in the National League.[65][66] The two National 
League East divisional rivals have met each other recently in playoff, 
division, and wild card races. Aside from several brawls in the 1980s, 
the rivalry remained low-key before the 2006 season,[67] as the teams had 
seldom been equally good at the same time. Since 2006, the teams have battled 
for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006 and contended in 
2007 and 2008, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles 
from 2007 to 2011.[68] The Phillies' 2007 Eastern Division Title was won 
on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with seventeen 
games remaining. The City Series was the name of a series of baseball games 
played between the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League and the 
Phillies that ran from 1903 through 1955. After the A's move to Kansas 
City, Missouri in 1955, the City Series rivalry came to an end. The teams 
have since faced each other in Interleague play (since its introduction 
in 1997) but the rivalry has effectively died in the intervening years 
since the A's left Philadelphia. In 2014, when the A's faced the Phillies 
in inter-league play at O.Co Coliseum, the Athletics didn't bother to mark 
the historical connection, going so far as to have a Connie Mack promotion 
the day before the series while the Texas Rangers were in Oakland.[69] 
The first City Series was held in 1883 between the Phillies and the American 
Association's Athletics.[70] When the Athletics first joined the American 
League, the two teams played each other in a spring and fall series. No 
City Series was held in 1901 and 1902 due to legal warring between the 
National and American Leagues. The rivalry between the Phillies and the 
Pittsburgh Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries 
in the National League.[71][72][73] The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh 
Pirates entered National League play in their fifth season of 1887, four 
years after the Phillies.[74] The Phillies and the Pirates had remained 
together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During 
the period of two-division play (1969 to 1993), the two National League 
East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, 
reigning exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the 
early 1990s,[74][75] the Pirates 9, the Phillies 6; together, the two teams' 
15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships 
during that span.[76] After the Pirates moved to the National League Central 
in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the 
rivalry has diminished.[73] However, many fans, especially older ones, 
retain their dislike for the other team and regional differences between 
Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry.[77] The rivalry 
between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins in the National 
Hockey League is also fiercely contested.[77][78] Five Phillies have won 
MVP awards during their career with the team. Mike Schmidt leads with three 
wins, with back-to-back MVPs in 1980 and 1981, and in 1986 as well. Chuck 
Klein (1932), Jim Konstanty (1950), Ryan Howard (2006), and Jimmy Rollins 
(2007) all have one.[79] Pitcher Steve Carlton leads the team in Cy Young 
Award wins with four (1972, 1977, 1980, and 1982), while John Denny (1983), 
Steve Bedrosian (1987), and Roy Halladay (2010) each have one.[79] Four 
Phillies have won Rookie of the Year honors as well. Jack Sanford won in 
1957, and Dick Allen won in 1964. Third baseman Scott Rolen brought home 
the honors in 1997, while Howard was the most recent Phillies winner in 
2005.[80] In doing so, Howard became only the second player in MLB history 
to win Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in consecutive years, 
Cal Ripken, Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles being the first.[81] Of the 15 
players who have hit four home runs in one game, three were Phillies at 
the time (more than any other team). Ed Delahanty was the first, hitting 
his four in Chicago's West Side Park on July 13, 1896. Chuck Klein repeated 
the feat nearly 40 years later to the day, on July 10, 1936, at Pittsburgh's 
Forbes Field. Forty years later, on April 17, 1976, Mike Schmidt became 
the third, also hitting his in Chicago, these coming at Wrigley Field. 
From 1978 to 2003, the Phillies inducted one former Phillie and one former 
member of the Philadelphia Athletics per year. Since 2004 they have inducted 
one Phillie annually. Players must be retired and must have played at least 
four years with the Phillies or Athletics. The last ten years' inductees 
to the Wall of Fame are listed below: In 1983, rather than inducting a 
player into the Wall of Fame, the Phillies selected their Centennial Team, 
commemorating the best players of the first 100 years in franchise history.

two additional players with the letter "P."[94] Grover Cleveland Alexander 
played with the team in the era before Major League Baseball used uniform 
numbers, and Chuck Klein wore a variety of numbers with the team during 
his career. Of the six players with retired numbers, five were retired 
for their play with the Phillies and one, 42, was universally retired by 
Major League Baseball when they honored the 50th anniversary of Jackie 
Robinson's breaking the color barrier. The Phillies have supported amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis research (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) with the 
"Phillies Phestival" since 1984.[103] The team raised over US$750,000 for 
ALS research at their 2008 festival, compared with approximately $4,500 
at the inaugural event in 1984;[103] the event has raised a total of over 
$10 million in its history.[104] The ALS Association of Philadelphia is 
the Phillies' primary charity,[105] and the hospitals they support include 
Pennsylvania Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, and Hahnemann 
University Hospital.[103] Former Phillies pitchers Geoff Geary (now with 
the Houston Astros), who lost a friend to the disease,[106] and Curt Schilling, 
who retired with the Boston Red Sox,[107] are both still involved with 
the Phillies' cause. Phanatic about Education The Philadelphia Phillies 
have shown themselves to be a big supporter of reading and overall education, 
using baseball in a positive way to help support education for students. 
The Phillies have a reading incentive program called Phanatic About Reading, 
which is designed to encourage students from kindergarten to eighth grade 
to read for a minimum of 15 minutes a night. This reading program is to 
help students with their literacy skills and comprehension. Phillies Phundamentals 
is another educational program, offered through after-school and summer 
camps, that is designed to make learning fun and support academic skills 
by using baseball. The Phillies celebrate teachers during their annual 
Teacher Appreciation Night.[108] Phillies fans have earned a reputation 
over the years for their occasional unruly behavior. In the 1960s, radio 
announcers for visiting teams would frequently report on the numerous fights 
breaking out in Connie Mack Stadium.[citation needed] Immediately after 
the final game at the old park, many fans ran onto the field or dislodged 
parts of the ballpark to take home with them.[110] Later, at Veterans Stadium, 
the 700 Level gained a reputation for its "hostile taunting, fighting, 
public urination and general strangeness."[111] Phillies fans are known 
for harsh criticism of their own stars such the 1964 Rookie of the Year 
Richie Allen and Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt. The fans, however, 
are just as well known for heckling the visiting team. Los Angeles Dodgers 
pitcher Burt Hooton's poor performance during game three of the 1977 NLCS[112] 
has often been attributed to the crowd's taunting.[113] J. D. Drew, the 
Phillies' first overall draft pick in the amateur draft of 1997, never 
signed with the Phillies following a contract dispute with the team, instead 
re-entering the draft the next year to be drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals.[114] 
Phillies fans were angered over this disrespect and hurled debris, including 
two D batteries, at Drew during an August 1999 game.[115] Subsequent visits 
by Drew to Philadelphia continue to be met with sustained booing from the 
Phillies fans. Many sports writers have noted the passionate presence of 
Phillies fans, including Allen Barra, who wrote that the biggest roar he 
ever heard from Philadelphia fans was in 1980 when Tug McGraw, in the victory 
parade after the World Series, told New York fans they could "take this 
championship and shove it."[116] When the Phillies moved to Veteran's Stadium, 
they hired a group of young ladies to serve as ushers. These women wore 
maroon-colored outfits featuring hot pants and were called the Hot Pants 
Patrol.[117] The team also introduced a pair of mascots attired in colonial 
garb, named Philadelphia Phil and Phyllis. In addition to costumed characters, 
animated Phil and Phyllis figures mounted on the center field facade would 
"hit" the Liberty Bell after a Phillie home run. This pair of mascots never 
achieved any significant level of popularity with fans and were eventually 
discontinued.[117] In 1978, the team introduced a new mascot, the Phillie 
Phanatic, who has been called "baseball's best mascot", which has been 
much more successful and has become closely associated with the marketing 
of the team.[118] In Phillies fan culture, it is also not unusual to replace 
an "f" with a "ph" in words, such as the Phillie Phanatic.[119] The club 
surpassed 100 consecutive sellouts on August 19, 2010, selling out over 
50% of their home games and averaging an annual attendance of over 3.1 
million fans since moving to Citizens Bank Park;[120] on April 3, 2011, 
the team broke the three-game series attendance record at the ballpark, 
having 136,254 fans attend the opening weekend against the Houston Astros.[citation 
needed] In 2011 and 2012, the Phillies led the league in attendance with 
3,680,718 and 3,565,718 fans, respectively, coming out to watch Phillies 
baseball.[121][122][123][124][125] The records of the Phillies' last ten 
seasons in Major League Baseball are listed below. Lost NLCS (Giants) 4–2

has employed 51 managers.[130] The duties of the team manager include team 
strategy and leadership on and off the field.[131] Seven managers have 
taken the Phillies to the postseason, with Danny Ozark and Charlie Manuel 
each leading the team to three playoff appearances. Manuel and Dallas Green 
are the only Phillies managers to win a World Series: Green in 1980 against 
the Kansas City Royals; and Manuel in 2008 against the Tampa Bay Rays.[132] 
Charlie Manuel is the longest-tenured manager in franchise history, with 
1,416 games of service in parts of nine seasons (2005–2013).[133] The records 
and accomplishments of the last seven Phillies' managers are shown below. 
Statistics current through 2015 season As of 2016, the Phillies' flagship 
radio stations are WIP-FM (94.1 FM) and WPHT (1210 AM), both owned by CBS 
Radio.[145] Scott Franzke and Jim Jackson provide play-by-play on the radio, 
with Larry Andersen as the color commentator. Meanwhile, NBCUniversal (a 
unit of Philadelphia-based Comcast) handles local television broadcasts 
through its properties Comcast SportsNet,[146] WCAU, and Comcast Network. 
Tom McCarthy calls play-by-play for the television broadcasts, with Ben 
Davis, Mike Schmidt and Matt Stairs providing color commentary. Spanish 
language broadcasts are on WDAS (1480 AM) with Danny Martinez on play-by-play 
and Bill Kulik and Juan Ramos on color commentary. Other popular Phillies 
broadcasters through the years include By Saam from 1939 to 1975, Bill 
Campbell from 1962 to 1970, Richie Ashburn from 1963 to 1997, and Harry 
Kalas from 1971 to 2009.[147] Kalas, a 2002 recipient of the Ford Frick 
Award and an icon in the Philadelphia area, called play-by-play in the 
first three and last three innings on television and the fourth inning 
on the radio until his death on April 13, 2009. At Citizens Bank Park, 
the restaurant built into the base of the main scoreboard is named "Harry 
the K's" in Kalas's honor. After Kalas's death, the Phillies' TV-broadcast 
booth was renamed "The Harry Kalas Broadcast Booth". It is directly next 
to the radio-broadcast booth, which is named "The Richie 'Whitey' Ashburn 
Broadcast Booth". When the Phillies win at home, Kalas' rendition of the 
song "High Hopes", which he would sing when the Phillies had clinched a 
playoff berth or advanced in the playoffs, is played as fans file out of 
the stadium. In addition, when a Phillies player hits a home run a recording 
of Kalas' famous "That ball is outta here!" home run call is played. The 
sole exception is Chase Utley, once the subject of another famous Kalas 
call, "Chase Utley, you are The Man!", which is played when Utley hits 
a homer. In 2011, the Phillies unveiled a statue of Harry Kalas at Citizens 
Bank Park. The statue was funded by Phillies fans and designed and constructed 
by a Phillies fan. The Phillies' public-address (PA) announcer is Dan Baker, 
who started in the 1972 season.[148][149] In 2011, the Phillies spent $10 
million to upgrade the video system at Citizens Bank Park, including a 
new display screen in left field, the largest in the National League.[150][151]
