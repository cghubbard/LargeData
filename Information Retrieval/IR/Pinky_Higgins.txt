Michael Franklin "Pinky" Higgins (May 27, 1909 – March 21, 1969) was an 
American third baseman, manager, front office executive and scout in Major 
League Baseball who played for three teams and served as manager or general 
manager of the Boston Red Sox during the period of 1955 through 1965. He 
batted and threw right-handed. Higgins was born in Red Oak, Texas. He was 
nicknamed "Pinky" as a baby, and according to some reports detested it. 
Alternatively, he was called by either of his given names. He signed some 
autographs as Frank Higgins, but was predominantly known as Mike, especially 
later in his career. Higgins graduated from W. H. Adamson High School in 
Dallas, where he played on the 1926 state championship runner-up team. 
He attended the University of Texas at Austin before beginning his career 
with the Philadelphia Athletics on June 25, 1930. After only 24 at bats 
that year, he did not play in the majors again until 1933, when he began 
to play full-time for the A's. In his rookie season of 1933, he batted 
.314 with 13 home runs and 99 RBIs. He hit for the cycle on August 3 in 
a 12–8 win over the Washington Senators. The A's of that year finished 
third in the American League. By 1938, when he was traded to the Boston 
Red Sox for fellow third baseman Billy Werber, he was not only considered 
one of the better-hitting third basemen in the league but led them in batting 
average in 1933 and 1934. In his first two years with the Bosox (1937 and 
1938), he hit over .300 with a career-high 106 RBIs in both years. In June 
1938, he set (and still holds) a major league record with base hits in 
12 consecutive at bats, accomplishing the feat over 14 plate appearances 
because he also received two bases on balls during that streak. His mark 
was tied by Walt Dropo in 1952, who made his 12 straight knocks in 12 appearances, 
with no bases on balls in between. He would next head to the Detroit Tigers 
in a trade for submarine pitcher Elden Auker, where he would spend the 
majority of his playing career. It was also where his hitting numbers dropped 
while his power numbers still stayed fairly strong, but not in the same 
realm as his career-high of 23 homers with Philadelphia in 1935. Boston 
got Higgins back in mid-1946 as the team's regular third baseman, winning 
the AL pennant by 12 games (but losing the 1946 World Series to the Cardinals 
in seven). The Red Sox then released him, and he retired to become a manager 
in the Red Sox farm system. His final numbers included a .292 batting average 
with 140 home runs and 1,075 RBIs. He accumulated 1,941 career hits in 
6,636 at bats, and made the All-Star team three times (1934, '36, '44). 
Higgins played in two World Series: one with Detroit in 1940 and one with 
Boston in 1946, losing both in seven but amassing a .271 Series batting 
average with 1 home run (for Detroit), 8 RBIs (6 for Detroit and 2 for 
Boston) and 13 hits in 48 at bats. Higgins started his managing career 
with the Class B Roanoke Red Sox of the Piedmont League in the Red Sox 
farm system in 1947. After eight seasons of managing in the minors — including 
four (1951–54) at the helm of the Red Sox' AAA affiliate, the Louisville 
Colonels of the American Association — he became Boston's skipper in 1955. 
Before taking the Red Sox promotion, he was under consideration as manager-in-waiting 
for the Baltimore Orioles, where fellow Texan and former Tiger teammate 
Paul Richards had just been installed as the O's general manager and field 
manager in September 1954.[1] Higgins' first team saw a hot July and August 
but a September debacle and a fourth-place finish. Although he had winning 
first- division teams through 1958 and Ted Williams won two more batting 
titles (1957–58), the Red Sox never seriously contended — never finishing 
less than 12 games in arrears of the first-place New York Yankees. In 1959, 
with the 40-year-old Williams injured (and turning in the only sub-.300 
season of his career), the Red Sox lost 42 of their first 73 games,[2] 
and on July 3, Higgins was replaced as manager by Billy Jurges, a coach 
with the Washington Senators (and former star shortstop of the Cubs in 
the 1930s). However, he stayed in the organization as special assistant 
to Bosox owner Tom Yawkey, a personal friend. After a promising end to 
the 1959 season, Jurges' Red Sox plummeted into last place in the opening 
weeks of the 1960 campaign. Jurges was fired on June 10, 1960; then, after 
coach Del Baker handled the Red Sox for seven games, Higgins was re-installed 
as manager; but the pitching-poor Red Sox continued to lose. Nonetheless, 
on September 30, 1960 he was signed to a three-year contract extension 
as field manager and given control of all player personnel in the Boston 
organization — effectively adding the responsibilities of general manager 
(without the formal title) to his managerial role.[3] He hung up his uniform 
and joined Boston's front office full-time as executive vice president 
and general manager after the 1962 campaign, finishing his managerial career 
with a record of 560–556 (.502) in 1,119 games. His best finish was third 
place, in 1957 and 1958, although his best winning percentage was achieved 
in both 1955 and 1956 with 84–70 (.545) fourth-place finishes. He was 53 
when he retired from managing. As a skipper, Higgins was known for being 
well liked by players and very easygoing. He would not go out to the mound 
to talk to his pitcher very often and in fact once said, "I don't believe 
in that business of walking out to the mound every time a pitcher's in 
trouble. You can't tell him anything new." Higgins' record as a general 
manager, like his managing record, was mediocre. During the 1960 offseason, 
he traded 6 ft 6 1⁄2-in (1.99 m) starting pitcher Frank Sullivan to the 
Philadelphia Phillies for another tall right-hander, 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) 
Gene Conley, who was also Bill Russell's backup center for the Boston Celtics; 
Conley would give Higgins two healthy seasons and win 15 games in 1962. 
But apart from swapping shortstops with Paul Richards' Houston Colt .45s, 
acquiring Eddie Bressoud for Don Buddin, Higgins made no significant trades 
during the remainder of his two-year (1961–62) tenure as both manager and 
supervisor of playing personnel. Once he was named full-time general manager, 
in the autumn of 1962, he did make a few major trades, one of them netting 
slugger Dick Stuart from the Pittsburgh Pirates, but they did not materially 
improve the club on the field. He made no further major deals until after 
the 1964 campaign, when he sent Stuart to the Phillies for left-handed 
starting pitcher Dennis Bennett, who suffered from a sore arm and would 
win only 12 games (losing 13) in 286⅓ innings over 2½ seasons in a Boston 
uniform. Higgins also clashed with his managerial successor, Johnny Pesky, 
who had been personally chosen by Yawkey. By the end of the 1964 season, 
Higgins had pushed Pesky aside, replacing him with his own man, Billy Herman. 
The Red Sox continued to struggle at the major-league level, and in 1965 
they lost 100 games for the only time during the Yawkey era for lack of 
pitching. But meanwhile, in their farm system directed by Neil Mahoney, 
they were amassing talent (including African-American players such as outfielder 
Reggie Smith, first baseman George Scott and third baseman Joe Foy) who 
would lead them to an improbable AL pennant in 1967, aided and abetted 
by 21-game winner Jim Lonborg and Triple Crown winner Carl Yastrzemski. 
Higgins, however, was finally ousted by Yawkey on September 16, 1965, ironically 
the same day 21-year-old Boston righthander Dave Morehead threw a no-hitter. 
He then joined Houston as a scout, hired by old friend and teammate Richards. 
It would be his last job in baseball. Red Sox historians often single out 
Higgins, along with Yawkey, when they discuss the root of the club's reputation 
for resisting racial integration. The Red Sox were the last (in 1959) of 
the then 16 major league teams to play a black player and fielded an all-white 
team from Jackie Robinson's Brooklyn Dodger debut in 1947 through Higgins' 
first managerial term. He was quoted by one Boston baseball writer, the 
late Al Hirshberg, as saying, "There'll be no niggers on this ball club 
as long as I have anything to say about it."[4] He also reportedly called 
sportswriter Cliff Keane "a fucking nigger-lover"[5] after hearing Keane 
praise the talents of White Sox outfielder Minnie Miñoso, a Cuban of African 
descent. The Red Sox' first African American player, utility infielder 
Pumpsie Green, was recalled from the minor leagues in July 1959, during 
Jurges' brief tenure as pilot. But Higgins had no control over the big 
league roster until he became Red Sox manager in 1955, and the club's hostility 
toward breaking the color line appeared to be in place well before then 
under Yawkey and his front office bosses, Eddie Collins and Joe Cronin.[6] 
When Higgins returned to his managerial post and then assumed player personnel 
responsibilities, from mid-1960 through late in 1965, he oversaw an integrated 
roster and acquired a few nonwhite players (outfielders Román Mejías, Lenny 
Green, Al Smith and Willie Tasby and infielders Billy Harrell and Félix 
Mantilla). Tasby was enthusiastic about playing for Higgins when he was 
quoted in a Boston newspaper in late 1960. (He spent only a half-year with 
the Red Sox before his selection in the 1960 Major League Baseball expansion 
draft.) On February 27, 1968, Higgins was arrested in Simsboro in Lincoln 
Parish in north Louisiana, for the death with his car of George W. Killen 
(1903–1968),[7] a World War II veteran and a member of a road crew of the 
Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, and the injury 
of three others. Higgins sustained two heart attacks between conviction 
and sentencing. He pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and was 
sentenced to four of five possible years for the offense.[8] Higgins was 
sent to the Louisiana State Penitentiary in West Feliciana Parish in early 
January 1969 to begin his sentence. "I know that he has a very enviable 
record. It's just one of those tragic cases", said District Attorney Ragan 
Madden.[9] Higgins was paroled after serving only two months. The day after 
he was paroled, he died of a heart attack in Dallas, Texas, at the age
