The Lowell Spinners are a Short-Season A minor league baseball affiliate 
of the Boston Red Sox. Founded in 1996 after Clyde Smoll moved the Elmira 
Pioneers to Lowell, Massachusetts, the Spinners play in the New York–Penn 
League, which has a Short-Season A classification with 76 games a year, 
38 of which are at home. The official mascots of the Spinners are Canaligator, 
Allie-Gator, and Millie-Gator. They were introduced on January 19, 1996, 
July 8, 1999, and Opening Day 2006, respectively.[1] For the 1996 and 1997 
seasons, the Spinners played at Stoklosa Alumni Field. Since 1998, they 
have played at Edward A. LeLacheur Park in Lowell.[2] Drew Weber was the 
team owner from 1997 until June 2016, when it was purchased by Dave Heller.[2] 
The Spinners set a minor-league record in the 2000 season, as they sold 
every home ticket for every home game.[3]This began a streak of sold-out 
home games. The streak was broken on August 30, 2010, at 413 games.[3] 
[2] On August 21, 2003, the Spinners sponsored a Jack Kerouac bobblehead 
giveaway.[4] Kerouac was a Lowell native, and played football for Lowell 
High School.[5] The bobblehead was accepted by Cooperstown in 2005, the 
first time a literary icon was accepted there.[6] The bobbleheads were 
so popular that many more were made than originally intended, raised $10,000 
for the Jack Kerouac Scholarship Fund.[6] The enshrinement also made media 
headlines as far away as Los Angeles.[7] The giveaway was repeated on August 
7, 2012 when the film adaptation of On the Road was released.[5] The dolls 
had a bobble head as well as a "bobble arm."[8] The bobbleheads were also 
available online for ordering, and as the game was sponsored by the UMass 
Lowell English Department, their departmental scholarships received the 
proceeds from the online orders.[9] A third Kerouac bobblehead, featuring 
Kerouac in his Lowell High football uniform, was given out on July 25, 
2013.[10] In 2005, the Spinners created the "Yankees Elimination Program." 
They offered to pay for the uniforms to all Little Leagues and youth softball 
teams in New England so that they would change all teams named "Yankees" 
into "Spinners". Over the next five years, 150 teams in New England made 
the switch. The Spinners also invited the youth teams to play at LaLecheur 
Park, and assisted in other fundraising initiative for those teams. In 
2010, the program was limited to 75 teams on first-come first serve basis, 
and it was estimated that over $70,000 had been donated into youth baseball 
and softball programs through the initiative. Spinners VP and GM Tim Bawmann 
said,“The Yankees Elimination Promotion was originally built as a fun promotion 
in response to parents' stories of children losing interest in the game 
after facing taunts simply for playing in a Yankees uniform.”[11] Spinners 
games are currently broadcast on Lowell talk station WCAP. For the 2007 
season they were on WLLH, another Lowell AM radio station, which at the 
time was an ESPN Radio affiliate. The games returned to WCAP the next season.[12][13][14] 
On September 1, 2008, the Spinners reached the New York–Penn League playoffs 
for the first time capturing the Stedler Division title. They reached the 
playoffs again in 2009. In October 2014 the Red Sox agreed to extend their 
player development contract with the Spinners for two more years through 
the 2016 season.[15] In November of 2015, the contract was extended again 
through the 2018 season.[16] In the 2016 season, the Spinners ended with 
a franchise-best record of 47 wins, and tied their record for home wins 
(25). RF Tyler Hill won the NYPL batting title, and he and third baseman 
Bobby Dalbec became the first Spinners players to win Player of the Month 
awards. The Spinners won the Stedler Division title, but were swept by 
the Hudson Valley Renegades in the semifinals 2-0.[17] Boston Red Sox pitching 
prospect Jason Groome also made his first start for the team in the playoffs 
after being promoted from the Gulf Coast League.[18] A full list of Spinners 
players who played in the major leagues, with their debut dates, is maintained 
on the team website.[19] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager
