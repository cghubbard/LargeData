Robert Vernon "Bob" Walk (born November 26, 1956) is a former Major League 
Baseball pitcher. Nicknamed "The Whirly Bird," Walk spent his career pitching 
for the Philadelphia Phillies (1980), Atlanta Braves (1981–1983), and Pittsburgh 
Pirates (1984–1993). During his rookie season in Philadelphia, he recorded 
11 regular season wins and a victory in Game One of the 1980 World Series, 
his Phillies defeating the Kansas City Royals in six games. Traded to the 
Braves, he bounced between the main club and AAA until being released in 
March 1984. He was signed to a minor league contract by the Pirates and 
led the Pacific Coast League in ERA and wins in 1985, earning a trip back 
to the majors. He was named to the All-Star team in 1988 when he won 12 
games and posted a 2.71 ERA. In his waning years, Walk served as a spot 
starter and swingman for the Pirates' teams that won three straight NL 
East titles from 1990-1992. His most memorable outing being when manager 
Jim Leyland removed him from the bullpen and named him a surprise starter 
in Game Five of the 1992 NLCS against Atlanta. He tossed a complete game 
three-hitter to stave off elimination in a series which the Pirates would 
eventually lose in seven games. He was also the pitcher who was warmed 
up in the bullpen when Francisco Cabrera hit the two-run, game-winning 
single against Stan Belinda, which won the series for Atlanta. Despite 
both Walk and Cabrera being right-handers, Leyland opted to keep Belinda 
(despite having walked Berryhill to load the bases and giving up a deep 
fly ball to Ron Gant) to pitch to Cabrera. On June 30, 2007, the Pittsburgh 
Pirates honored Walk with a Stadium Give Away bobble head night during 
a game against the Washington Nationals. He is currently an announcer for 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on Root Sports Pittsburgh and radio. He is also
