Joseph O'Neal Christopher (born December 13, 1935 in Frederiksted, U.S. 
Virgin Islands) is a former outfielder who played in Major League Baseball 
from 1959 through 1966. Listed at 5' 10", 175 lbs., he batted and threw 
right-handed. Christopher reached the majors in 1959 with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, spending three years with them before moving to the New York Mets 
(1962–65) and Boston Red Sox (1966). While in Pittsburgh, Christopher was 
used as a backup in all three outfield positions for Bob Skinner (LF), 
Bill Virdon (CF) and Roberto Clemente (RF). He was first called up when 
Clemente was injured, making his debut in nothing less than Harvey Haddix’s 
pitching masterpiece of 12 perfect innings on May 26, 1959. As a member 
of the 1960 World Series Champion Pirates, he was a utility player, pinch-running 
in three games and scoring two runs (games 2 and 5). Christopher became 
the Mets’ fifth pick in the 1961 MLB Expansion Draft. In 1964 he enjoyed 
easily his finest season as a major-leaguer, hitting .300 with 16 home 
runs, 76 RBI, 78 runs, 163 hits, 26 doubles, and eight triples in 154 games, 
all career-highs. He had a career-best day on August 19, collecting two 
triples, a double, and a home run in an 8–6 victory over his former Pirates 
teammates. Then, on September 25 he broke up the no-hit bid of Cincinnati 
Reds pitcher Jim Maloney at Shea Stadium. His second-inning single was 
the only hit against Maloney, who had to settle for a 3–0 shutout. Christopher 
played briefly in 1966 for the Red Sox and was dealt with pitcher Earl 
Wilson to the Detroit Tigers, who sent Julio Navarro as part of the package. 
Although Christopher’s major league career had come to an end on June 9, 
1966 (he never played for Detroit), he stayed active in the minors through 
1968. He also played winter baseball in Dominican Republic, Mexico and 
Puerto Rico. In an eight-season career, Christopher was a .260 hitter with 
29 home runs and 173 RBI in 638 games, including one five-hit game and
