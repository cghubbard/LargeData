Professional sports, as opposed to amateur sports, are sports in which 
athletes receive payment for their performance. Professional athleticism 
has come to the fore through a combination of developments. Mass media 
and increased leisure have brought larger audiences, so that sports organizations 
or teams can command large incomes.[1] As a result, more sportspeople can 
afford to make athleticism their primary career, devoting the training 
time necessary to increase skills, physical condition, and experience to 
modern levels of achievement.[1] This proficiency has also helped boost 
the popularity of sports.[1] Most sports played professionally also have 
amateur players far outnumbering the professionals. Baseball originated 
before the American Civil War (1861-1865). A humble game played on sandlots 
in particular, scoring and record-keeping gave baseball gravity. "Today," 
notes John Thorn in The Baseball Encyclopedia, "baseball without records 
is inconceivable." In 1871 the first professional baseball league was created.[2] 
By the beginning of the 20th century, most large cities in the eastern 
United States had a professional baseball team. The teams were divided 
into two leagues, the National and American teams. During the regular season, 
a team played only against other teams within its league. The most victorious 
team in each league was said to have won the "pennant;" the two pennant 
winners met after the end of the regular season in the World Series. The 
winner of at least four games (out of a possible seven) was the champion 
for that year. This arrangement still holds today, although the leagues 
are now subdivided and pennants are decided in post-season playoff series 
between the winners of each division.[2] Baseball became popular in the 
1920s, when Babe Ruth led the New York Yankees to several World Series 
titles and became a national hero on the strength of his home runs (balls 
that cannot be played because they have been hit out of the field). One 
of the most noteworthy players was the Brooklyn Dodgers' Jackie Robinson, 
who became the first African-American player in the major leagues in 1947. 
Prior to Robinson, black players had been restricted to the Negro League.[2] 
Starting in the 1950s, major league baseball expanded its geographical 
range. Western cities got teams, either by luring them to move from eastern 
cities or by forming expansion teams with players made available by established 
teams. Until the 1970s, because of strict contracts, the owners of baseball 
teams also virtually owned the players; since then, the rules have changed 
so that players can become free agents, within certain limits, to sell 
their services to any team. The results have been bidding wars and stars 
who are paid millions of dollars a year. Disputes between the players' 
union and the owners have at times halted baseball for months at a time.[2] 
Japan has also seen a prominent professional baseball circuit develop known 
as Nippon Professional Baseball, which was founded in 1934 and emerged 
as an international force after World War II. NPB is considered to be the 
highest caliber of baseball outside of the U.S. major leagues, and the 
best Japanese talent can emigrate to the U.S. by way of the posting system. 
Other prominent countries to play the game include South Korea (where their 
league has its own posting system with Major League Baseball), Mexico, 
Latin America, and the Caribbean states. The game of American football 
was professionalized in the 1890s as a slow, and initially covert, process; 
William Heffelfinger and Ben "Sport" Donnelly were the first to secretly 
accept payment for playing the game in 1892.[citation needed] Regional 
leagues in Chicago, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York had coalesced in the 
1900s and 1910s, most of which gave way to the first truly national football 
league, the American Professional Football Association, in 1920.[citation 
needed] By 1920, pro football remained overshadowed by the college game. 
The first game involving an APFA team took place on September 26, 1920, 
at Douglas Park in Rock Island, Illinois, as the hometown Independents 
flattened the St. Paul Ideals 48-0. The first head-to-head battles in the 
league occurred one week later as Dayton topped Columbus 14-0 and Rock 
Island pasted Muncie 45-0. Forward passes were rare, coaching from the 
sidelines was prohibited and players competed on both offense and defense. 
Money was so tight that Halas carried equipment, wrote press releases, 
sold tickets, taped ankles, played and coached for the Decatur club. As 
opposed to today’s standard 16-game schedule, clubs in 1920 scheduled their 
own opponents and could play nonleague and even college squads that counted 
toward their records. With no established guidelines, the number of games 
played—and the quality of opponents scheduled—by APFA teams varied, and 
the league did not maintain official standings.[3] The Buffalo All-Americans, 
Chicago Tigers, Columbus Panhandles and Detroit Heralds joined the league 
before the end of the season, raising the total number of teams to 14, 
but the inaugural season was a struggle. Games received little attention 
from the fans—and even less from the press. According to Robert W. Peterson’s 
book "Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football," APFA games averaged crowds 
of 4,241. The association bylaws called for teams to pay a $100 entry fee, 
but no one ever did. Muncie played only one game before dropping out before 
the end of the season, which concluded on December 19. At the conclusion 
of the season there were no playoffs (that innovation, although New York's 
regional league had used it, would not arrive until 1933) and it took more 
than four months before the league even bothered to crown a champion. Much 
as college football did for decades, the APFA determined its victor by 
ballot. On April 30, 1921, team representatives voted the Akron Pros, who 
completed the season undefeated with eight wins and three ties while yielding 
only a total of seven points, the champion in spite of protests by the 
one-loss teams in Decatur and Buffalo, who each had tied Akron and had 
more wins. The victors received a silver loving cup donated by sporting 
goods company Brunswick-Balke-Collender. While players were not given diamond-encrusted 
rings, they did receive golden fobs in the shape of a football inscribed 
with the words "World Champions." Forgotten in the collective sports memory 
that the league’s official record books listed the 1920 championship as 
undecided until the 2013. The whereabouts of the Brunswick-Balke-Collender 
Cup, only given out that one time, are unknown. The legacy of two APFA 
franchises continues on, however. The Racine Cardinals now play in Arizona, 
and the Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago in 1921 and changed their name 
to the Bears the following year. Ten APFA players along with Carr are enshrined 
in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which opened its doors in 1963 not far 
from the Canton automobile dealership that gave birth to the NFL in 1920.[4] 
The APFA, by 1922 known as the National Football League, has remained the 
predominant professional football league in the United States, and, effectively, 
the entire world. The evolution from a haphazard collection of teams in 
big and small cities to the much more rigid structure it is in the present 
was gradual; the smaller markets were squeezed out in the late 1920s and 
early 1930s, a championship game was established in 1933, a draft was established 
in 1936, and schedules were standardized in the 1930s. A competing league 
has historically arisen to attempt to challenge the NFL's dominance every 
10 to 15 years, but none managed to maintain long-term operations independent 
of the NFL and only two—the All-America Football Conference of the late 
1940s and the American Football League of the 1960s—were strong enough 
to successfully compete against the league before the NFL subsumed their 
operations. Minor league football, although their leagues' memberships 
were unstable, began to arise in the late 1930s and remained viable as 
a business model up into the 1970s. A major factor in the NFL's rise to 
dominance was its embrace of television early in the sport's history. As 
college football heavily restricted the rights of its teams to broadcast 
games (a policy eventually ruled to be illegal in 1984), the NFL instead 
allowed games to be televised nationwide, except in a team's home city; 
the restriction was softened in the early 1970s, by which point the NFL 
had secured broadcast deals with all of the major television networks, 
another major factor in the inability of any competing league to gain traction 
since then. The related sport of Canadian football was eventually professionalized 
by the 1950s, which saw the evolution of the Canadian Football League. 
The CFL, despite losing all games in a series of contests against the NFL, 
was considered to be at least comparable in talent to the American leagues 
of the 1960s (its lone game against an AFL squad was a victory). Because 
Canada has a tenth of the population of the United States, the ability 
to make money from television was much lower, and although some of the 
cities of Canada were comparable to the major markets of the U.S., teams 
in places such as Saskatchewan and Hamilton were in markets quite small 
compared to even the small markets of the NFL, thus the CFL now pays noticeably 
less than other major professional leagues, but still more than enough 
to be considered fully professional. The rise of indoor American football 
beginning in the late 1980s has allowed for smaller-scale professional 
football to be viable. Ice hockey was first professionalized in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania in the early 1900s (decade). As Canadians made up the vast 
majority of hockey players, early American professional leagues imported 
almost all of their talent before Canadian leagues began to form in the 
wake of a mining boom, depriving the U.S. leagues and teams of talent. 
Two distinct circuits formed: the Pacific Coast Hockey Association in western 
Canada and the northwestern U.S., and the National Hockey Association of 
central Canada, both of which competed for the then-independent Stanley 
Cup. The NHA's teams reorganized as the National Hockey League in 1917, 
and the West Coast circuit died out by the mid-1920s. The NHL expanded 
to the United States in the 1920s, focusing on the northeastern and midwestern 
states. By the mid-1930s, the league had been set into six markets: Boston, 
New York City, Chicago and Detroit in the U.S., and Toronto and Montreal 
in Canada. These Original Six cities would be the only cities with NHL 
franchises from 1935 to 1967. During this time, the NHL was both stagnant 
and restrictive in its policies, giving teams territorial advantages, having 
teams with multiple owners in the same family (thus allowing the best players 
to be stacked onto certain teams), and restricting its players' salaries 
through reserve clauses. This stagnation allowed other leagues to arise: 
the Western Hockey League soon became the de facto major league of the 
western states and provinces, and the second-tier American Hockey League 
emerged in a number of midwestern markets the NHL had neglected, in addition 
to a handful of small towns. Amid pressure from television networks that 
were threatening to offer the WHL a contract, the NHL doubled in size in 
1967, beginning a period of expansion that lasted through much of the 1970s. 
The last major challenger to the NHL's dominance was the World Hockey Association, 
which successfully broke the NHL's reserve clause in court, drove up professional 
hockey salaries, and continued to pressure the older league into expansion. 
The WHA merged four of its remaining teams into the NHL in 1979, but had 
to give up most of its players, as they were still under NHL contract and 
had to return to their original teams. The NHL made its last pronounced 
realignment in the 1990s, moving most of the WHA teams out of their markets 
and establishing a number of new teams in the southern United States. In 
Europe, the introduction of professionalism varied widely, and the highest-caliber 
league on the continent, the Soviet Championship League (proven to be at 
least equal to or better than the NHL in the 1970s), was officially composed 
of semi-professional works teams paid for their association with industries 
or government agencies (the Red Army squad employed members of the armed 
forces, and the Soviet Union often drafted the best hockey players in the 
country to serve on the squad). The modern-day descendant of the Soviet 
league, the Kontinental Hockey League, is fully professional and has a 
number of teams outside of Russia, to the point where it has the resources 
to sign NHL veterans. Other European countries such as Germany, Sweden, 
Switzerland, Norway, Finland, and Austria also have prominent professional 
leagues. Basketball was invented in 1891 and the first professional leagues 
emerged in the 1920s. The Basketball Association of America was established 
in 1946 and three years later became the modern National Basketball Association. 
The NBA was slower to establish dominance of the sport than other sports 
in the U.S., as it would not do so until 1976, when it absorbed four teams 
from the American Basketball Association. Professional basketball has the 
advantages of much smaller rosters than other professional sports, allowing 
the sport to be viable in smaller cities than other sports. Professional 
basketball leagues of varying caliber can be found around the world, especially 
in Europe and South America. Professional athleticism is seen as a contradiction 
of the central ethos of sport, competition performed for its own sake and 
pure enjoyment, rather than as a means of earning a living.[1] Consequently, 
many organisations and commentators have resisted the growth of professional 
athleticism, saying that it was so incredible that it has impeded the development 
of sport. For example, rugby union was for many years a part-time sport 
engaged in by amateurs, and English cricket has allegedly suffered in quality 
because of a "non-professional" approach.[1] An important reason why professional 
sports has been resisted in history was that organisations for professional 
sports usually did not submit to the international sports federations, 
and could have their own rules.[citation needed] For example, the National 
Basketball Association was formerly not a member of the FIBA. Men involved 
in professional sports can earn a great deal of money at the highest levels. 
For instance, the highest-paid team in professional baseball is New York 
Yankees.[5] Tiger Woods is the highest paid athlete totaling $127,902,706 
including his endorsement income,[6] which massively exceeds what he earns 
from tournament golf. Woods recently became the world's first athlete to 
earn a billion dollars from prize money and endorsements.[7] It would have 
taken the salary of 2,000 1980s professional golfers each making $58,500 
to match up with Tiger Woods’ current salary. Samuel Eto'o is the world's 
second highest earning athlete and the highest paid footballer in the world, 
raking in £35.7 million (over $54 million) a year excluding off-field earnings.[8] 
The top ten tennis players make about $3 million a year on average. Much 
of the growth in income for sports and athletes has come from broadcasting 
rights; for example, the most recent television contract for the NFL is 
valued at nearly US$5 billion per year.[9] Women in the U.S., on the other 
hand, make much less, for example as of 2014, the WNBA enforced a maximum 
salary of US$107,000 for star players (coaches could earn double that).[10] 
According to investopedia.com, a male star like Kobe Bryant or Lebron James 
can individually earn a salary larger than every player in the WNBA combined.[11] 
Outside of the highest leagues, however, the money professional athletes 
can earn drops dramatically, as fan bases are generally smaller and television 
revenues are nonexistent. For instance, while the National Football League's 
teams can afford to pay their players millions of dollars each year and 
still maintain a significant profit, the second-highest American football 
league in the United States, the United Football League, has consistently 
struggled to pay its bills and has continually lost money despite allotting 
its players only US$20,000 a year.[12][13][14] In the United States and 
Canada, most lower-end professional leagues run themselves as affiliated 
farm teams, effectively agreeing to develop younger players for eventual 
play in the major leagues in exchange for subsidizing those players' salaries; 
this is known as the minor league system and is most prevalent in professional 
baseball and professional ice hockey. Otherwise, the league may be required 
to classify itself as semi-professional, in other words, able to pay their 
players a small sum, but not enough to cover the player's basic costs of 
living. Many professional athletes experience financial difficulties soon 
after retiring, due to a combination of bad investments, careless spending, 
and a lack of non-athletic skills. In the United States, some of these 
problems are mitigated by the fact that the college sports system ensures 
most professional athletes receive a college education with no student 
debt, a legacy that provides them with a career path after their sports 
career ends; the wear and tear of a career in pro sport, in contrast, can 
cause physical and mental side effects (such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, 
a condition that has seen a massive rise in public awareness in the 2010s) 
that can harm a former professional athlete's employability. In the NFL 
average annual salaries by position in 2009 were:[15] The average salary 
of a player in the Chinese Super League was about ¥10.7 million (£1 million) 
for the 2011 season, up from ¥600,000 in the 2010 season.[17] The highest 
paid player for the 2011 Chinese Super League season was Dario Conca of 
Guangzhou Evergrande who received an annual salary of ¥66.4 million ($10.5 
million) after income tax, putting him among the highest paid players in 
the world.[18] The highest paid player for the 2011-2012 Russian Premier 
League season was Samuel Eto'o of Anzhi Makhachkala, who at the end of 
the 2011-12 season was expected to receive a total salary of RUB 900.2 
million (£35.7 million) after income tax, making Eto'o the second highest 
earning athlete in the world and the highest paid footballer in the world 
followed by Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimović.[8][19][20] The average 
salary of a player in the German Bundesliga was about €3.3 million (£2.5 
million) for the 2010-2011 season, up from €2.5 million in the 2009-2010 
Bundesliga season.[21] The highest paid player for the 2010-2011 Bundesliga 
season was Franck Ribéry of Bayern Munich who received a salary of €6.3 
million after income tax.[22] In the Italian top league, Serie A, the average 
salary was about €5 million for the 2010-2011 Serie A season, up from €1 
million in the 2005-2006 Serie A season.[23] The highest paid player for 
the 2010-2011 Serie A season was Zlatan Ibrahimović of A.C. Milan who received 
a salary of €25.9 million after income tax and which also includes Ibrahimović's 
bonuses and endorsements.[24] Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona is the world's 
second highest paid player receiving a salary of £29.6 million (over US$45 
million) a year after income taxation and which also includes the incomes 
of Messi's bonuses and endorsements.[25] In the Spanish La Liga, the average 
salary for the players of Lionel Messi's club FC Barcelona was €6.5 million 
for the 2010-2011 La Liga season, up from €5.5 million for the 2009-2010 
La Liga season.[25] The average salary of a player in the English Premier 
League was about £1.2 million in the 2007-2008 Premier League season, up 
from £676,000 in 2006-2007 Premier League season. Top players such as John 
Terry and Steven Gerrard can make up to £7 million per year with the players 
of Premier League club Manchester City F.C. receiving an average salary 
of £7 million for the 2010-2011 Premier League season, up from £5.5 million 
in the 2009-2010 Premier League season.[26][27] Players in lower divisions 
make significantly less money. In 2006-2007 season the average salary of 
a player in the Championship (the second tier of the English football pyramid) 
made £195,750 while the average salary for Football League and League Two 
(tier 4) was £49,600.[26] The highest salary in Major League Soccer in 
2015 was the $7.2 million paid to Kaká, who plays for the newly formed 
Orlando City SC.[28] Kaká was signed as a beneficiary of MLS' Designated 
Player Rule, which was instituted in 2007 for the express purpose of attracting 
international stars. This rule is sometimes informally called the "Beckham 
Rule," after now-retired English star David Beckham, the first player signed 
under its provisions.[29] When the rule was instituted, each team had one 
"Designated Player" slot with a salary cap charge of $400,000, but no limit 
on actual salary paid.[29] Since then, the number of Designated Players 
per team has increased to three, with each counting for $387,500 of cap 
room in 2014.[30] The league's average salary is about $283,000 per year, 
but the median salary is closer to $110,000.[31] MLS' minimum player salary 
will increase in 2016 from $60,000 to $62,500 for most players, and roster 
players #25-28 will see their minimum salary increase from $50,000 to $51,500.[32][33] 
In 1970, the average salary in Major League Baseball in the U.S. and Canada 
was $20,000 ($122,074 inflation-adjusted). By 2005, the average salary 
had increased to $2,632,655 ($3,195,161 inflation-adjusted) and the minimum 
salary was $316,000 (adjusted: $383,518).[34] In 2012 the average MLB salary 
was $3,440,000, the median salary was $1,075,000, and the minimum salary 
had grown to four times the inflation-adjusted average salary in 1970 ($480,000).[35]
