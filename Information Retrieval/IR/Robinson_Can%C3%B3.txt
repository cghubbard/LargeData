Robinson José Canó Mercedes (Spanish pronunciation: [kaˈno]; born October 
22, 1982) is a Dominican-American professional baseball second baseman 
for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball. He made his MLB debut 
with the New York Yankees in 2005 and played for them through 2013. Canó 
is a seven-time All-Star (2006, 2010–2014, 2016) and five-time Silver Slugger 
Award winner (2006, 2010–2013). He won two Gold Glove Awards (2010, 2012) 
and has been named American League Player of the Month twice (September 
2006, April 2010). In 2011, Canó won the Home Run Derby. He was a member 
of the Yankees' 2009 World Series championship team over the Philadelphia 
Phillies and also the Dominican Republic's 2013 World Baseball Classic 
championship team, for which he won the tournament's most valuable player 
award. His team's win made him and fellow WBC teammates Octavio Dotel and 
Santiago Casilla three of the four players to have won both a World Series 
and World Baseball Classic, joining Daisuke Matsuzaka and later joined 
by Koji Uehara. His father, José Canó, signed with the New York Yankees 
as an amateur free agent in 1980 and pitched in the Yankees' and Atlanta 
Braves minor league systems before making his Major League debut and pitching 
six games for the Houston Astros in 1989. Robinson was named after baseball 
legend Jackie Robinson.[1] Canó was born in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican 
Republic, and grew up in the Dominican Republic, though he lived in New 
Jersey for three years. He spent seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in the 
Newark school system, attending Barringer High School for one year.[2] 
When his family moved back to the Dominican Republic, Canó attended San 
Pedro Apostol High School in San Pedro de Macorís, where he played for 
the school's baseball and basketball teams.[3] In the Dominican Winter 
Baseball League he plays for his hometown team, the Estrellas Orientales.[4] 
After graduating from high school, Canó was signed by the Yankees in 2001 
as an amateur free agent, receiving a signing bonus of over $100,000.[5] 
He began playing in their minor league system that season, debuting with 
the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and the Staten 
Island Yankees of the Class-A Short Season New York–Penn League. Canó played 
for Staten Island and the Greensboro Bats of the Class-A South Atlantic 
League in 2002. Canó played for the Tampa Yankees of the Class-A Advanced 
Florida State League and Trenton Thunder of the Class-AA Eastern League 
in 2003, by which point he was viewed as a top prospect.[6] Canó appeared 
in the 2003 All-Star Futures Game.[6] Canó was one of the five prospects 
offered to the Texas Rangers to complete the Yankees' acquisition of Alex 
Rodriguez before the 2004 season. The Rangers selected Joaquín Árias instead.[5][7][8] 
Canó began the 2004 season with Trenton, receiving a promotion to the Columbus 
Clippers of the Class-AAA International League. When the Kansas City Royals 
began to seek trade offers for Carlos Beltrán, the Yankees moved Canó to 
third base in an effort to showcase Canó for the Royals.[5] The next month, 
the Yankees attempted to trade him to the Arizona Diamondbacks as part 
of a package to acquire Randy Johnson.[5] He began the 2005 season with 
Columbus. Canó was called up to the Major Leagues on May 3, 2005, while 
hitting .330 in 108 at bats with Columbus, and took over second base from 
Tony Womack.[9] Canó belted his first career grand slam this season as 
well. He finished second in American League Rookie of the Year balloting 
to Huston Street of the Oakland Athletics.[3] Canó finished the year, however, 
with the third-worst walk percentage in the league, 3.0%.[10] During 2005, 
manager Joe Torre compared Canó to Hall of Famer Rod Carew. Torre clarified 
that he meant that Canó "reminded" him of Carew, in terms of his build, 
presence at the plate, and smoothness in his swing.[11] In 2006, Canó led 
the American League (AL) All-Star balloting at second base, but could not 
play after being placed on the disabled list for a strained hamstring. 
After his return from injury, however, on August 8, 2006, Canó led the 
league in batting average, doubles, and runs batted in.[12] During late 
September 2006, Canó accumulated enough at-bats to once again qualify for 
the AL batting race. Canó was rewarded the AL Player of the Month award 
for September.[3] Canó finished 2006 with the third best batting average 
in the AL (.342, just 2 points behind teammate shortstop Derek Jeter and 
five points behind Minnesota Twins catcher Joe Mauer), and 9th in the league 
in doubles (41). He also led the AL in batting average on the road (.364; 
96/264) and after the 6th inning (.353; 55/156). He had the third-worst 
walk percentage in the league at 3.6%.[13] Canó received three votes for 
AL MVP.[14] In 2007, Canó gave up his number 22 to Roger Clemens, choosing 
to wear the number 24, a reversal of Jackie Robinson's number 42, in tribute 
to him.[15] After a slow start to the 2007 season which saw him hit a meager 
.249 through May 29, Canó found his stroke batting .385 in the month of 
July with 6 HR and 24 RBI to raise his season average to .300 by the end 
of the month. He finished 2007 sixth in the league in games played (160), 
ninth in triples (7), and tenth in hits (189), doubles (41), and at bats 
(670). He was the only batter in the top 10 in doubles in the AL in both 
2006 and 2007. On January 24, 2008, Canó signed a contract extension for 
$28 million over the next four years in the 2008 through 2011 seasons. 
The deal also includes options for the Yankees for the 2012 and 2013 seasons, 
worth $27 million.[16] Canó struggled early in the 2008 season, hitting 
only .151 in April with just 7 RBIs. He improved later in the year, hitting 
.300 from May through August.[citation needed] Canó recorded the final 
walk-off hit in Yankee Stadium history by singling in the winning run in 
the bottom of the 9th inning in the Yankees 1–0 victory over the Orioles 
on September 20, 2008. In the final game at Yankee Stadium the next night 
(September 21, 2008), Canó recorded the final RBI in Stadium history with 
his sacrifice fly in the 7th inning, scoring Brett Gardner with the Stadium's 
final run. Canó missed only five games over the 2007 and 2008 seasons, 
and was one of only three Yankees to hit a home run as a pinch hitter.[17] 
In 2009, Canó hit .320 with 204 hits, 25 home runs and 85 RBIs.[18] Canó 
ranked in the top ten among players in the American league in hits, extra 
base hits, total bases, at bats, doubles, batting average, runs scored, 
and triples. It was his first year hitting over 20 HRs. His 200th hit against 
the Boston Red Sox to clinch the AL East Division made him and Derek Jeter 
the first middle infield duo in MLB history to both have 200 hits in the 
same season.[19] His 204 hits ranked third for hits during the 2009 season, 
and first among all second basemen. Canó also led second basemen in batting 
average.[18] Canó also played in 161 games which was the most games played 
by a player during the 2009 season.[18] He also hit his first career walk-off 
home run: a 3-run walk-off home run on August 28 against the White Sox.[20] 
On November 4, Canó threw out Shane Victorino for the final out of the 
2009 World Series.[21] With the departure of Hideki Matsui, Canó was moved 
into the fifth spot in the batting order.[22] For his early season performance, 
Canó was named the American League Player of the Month for April 2010.[23] 
He was elected as the starting second baseman in the 2010 Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game and was selected to participate in the 2010 Home 
Run Derby;[24] however, he withdrew due to a minor injury.[25] He finished 
the season with a milestone 200 hits and 100+ RBIs (109). Canó has performed 
ably in the middle of the lineup, replacing Matsui and Alex Rodriguez while 
Rodriguez was on the disabled list, as he has improved his batting with 
runners in scoring position.[26] Canó hit .343 with 4 home runs and 6 RBIs 
in the 2010 postseason. He finished the season with a .996 fielding percentage, 
the best for a second baseman in MLB, committing only 3 errors in 158 games. 
He turned 114 double plays and recorded 341 putouts. Canó won the American 
League Gold Glove Award for second basemen in 2010, the first by a Yankee 
second baseman since Bobby Richardson's five-year run from 1961 to 1965. 
Canó also won the American League Silver Slugger Award for second basemen 
with a batting average of .319, 29 home runs and 109 runs batted in.[27] 
In addition, he finished third in the voting for American League MVP.[citation 
needed] Canó had a rough first half to his defensive season. By July, he 
had committed twice as many errors as he had in his entire Gold Glove-winning 
2010 season, in which he had three.[citation needed] Canó was selected 
for the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game as a starting second baseman, 
and was chosen to participate in the 2011 Major League Baseball Home Run 
Derby. With his father pitching, Canó won the derby, setting a record for 
home runs in the final round with 12 home runs despite having an additional 
four outs remaining.[28] Facing the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on August 
10, Canó fell a single short of hitting for the cycle. It marked the second 
time in his career that he missed the cycle by a single (the first being 
in 2005).[29] Canó finished the 2011 season had 188 hits and a career high 
in RBIs with 118. In Game 1 of the 2011 American League Division Series, 
Canó hit a grand slam in the bottom of the 6th inning to put the Yankees 
up 8–1. It marked his fourth grand slam of the year, including the regular 
season. He sandwiched the home run between two run-scoring doubles, giving 
him 6 total RBI for the game.[30] The Yankees would eventually lose the 
division series in a 5-game span. While Canó hit only one home run in April, 
he recovered to hit 7 homers in May, and a career-high 11 home runs in 
June. He returned to compete in the 2012 Major League Baseball Home Run 
Derby but was not able to repeat the previous year's victory. Instead, 
he hit zero home runs and finished in last place, and was booed by the 
Kansas City fans for not having chosen the Royals' Billy Butler to participate 
in the competition after previously stating that he would choose a Royal. 
He became the 9th player to fail to hit a HR in the Derby, and first since 
Brandon Inge did in 2009. On July 20, 2012, Canó extended his career-high 
hitting streak to 23 games with a single off of Oakland Athletics pitcher 
Tommy Milone in a 3–2 Yankees loss. And, in the last 10 games of the season, 
he went on a ferocious tear, going 24 for 39 for an .615 average with 3 
home runs, 7 doubles and 14 RBI.[31] Canó finished the 2012 season with 
a .313 batting average, 48 doubles, 33 home runs, and 94 RBI. Canó performed 
poorly during the postseason. Over his first eight games in the 2012 ALDS 
and ALCS, he batted .083 (3-for-36), including a stretch from October 9–16 
when he was hitless after 29 at-bats, the longest hitless streak for any 
single year of the postseason play in MLB history.[31] In the Game 4 finale, 
when the Tigers' sweep of the Yankees was complete, again Canó went 0–4, 
and his 2012 postseason average dropped to .075 (3-for-40).[32] On October 
29, the Yankees exercised Canó's club option for 2013 for $15 million, 
keeping him away from free agency for another year.[33] On April 13, 2013, 
Canó made his first career appearance at shortstop. He began the first 
half of the 2013 season with a .302 batting average, 21 home runs, and 
65 RBI. He was named the American League captain for the 2013 home run 
derby.[34] During his only plate appearance of the 2013 All-Star Game, 
he was hit by a pitch thrown by Matt Harvey and suffered a right quad contusion. 
Cano left the game and was replaced by Dustin Pedroia. He only played for 
two pitches. On August 20, Canó hit his 200th career home run, a three-run 
blast to center field off of Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Esmil Rogers at 
Yankee Stadium. During the 2013 season, Canó batted .314 with 190 hits, 
27 home runs, and 107 RBI in 160 games played. In December 2013, Canó signed 
a 10-year, $240 million contract with the Seattle Mariners.[35][36][37] 
Cano was offered a 7-year, $175 million contract to return to the Yankees, 
but turned it down in search of a longer deal. Canó made his debut for 
the Mariners on March 31, going 2–4 with a double. Canó recorded his first 
RBI for the Mariners on April 2. On July 6, Canó was named the American 
League starting second baseman for the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game. This marked Canó's 6th career All Star section, and his 5th consecutive.[38] 
Canó finished the season with a .314 batting average with 14 HR and 82 
RBI.[citation needed] During August, he began to suffer from gastrointestinal 
symptoms that were later diagnosed as resulting from an intestinal parasite.[39] 
After the season, Canó traveled to Japan to join a team of MLB All-Stars 
playing against All-Stars of Nippon Professional Baseball in the 2014 Major 
League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.[40] He fractured a toe during the 
series, requiring 3–4 weeks to heal.[41] Canó suffered through acid reflux 
during the 2015 season, which resulted from the treatment of the parasite. 
He was not named to the 2015 All-Star Game roster, ending a streak of five 
consecutive years as an All-Star.[42] He hit .287 with 21 home runs, 34 
doubles, and 79 RBIs in 156 games during the 2015 season, but improved 
in the second half of the season, batting .330. After the 2015 season, 
Cano had surgery to repair a sports hernia.[43] On May 7, 2016, Canó hit 
his 250th career home run, joining Joe Gordon, Alfonso Soriano, and Jeff 
Kent as only second basemen to reach 250 career home runs within the first 
12 years of his career.[44] He was selected to his seventh All-Star Game, 
played at Petco Park in San Diego.[45] On August 28, Canó reached 30 home 
runs for the second time in his career, hitting it against the Chicago 
White Sox.[46] In 161 games, Canó finished the season with a .298 batting 
average, 195 hits, 33 doubles, 39 home runs, and 103 RBI. Canó has participated 
for his native country, Dominican Republic, in the previous two World Baseball 
Classic (WBC) tournaments, held in 2009 and 2013. In the 2013 edition, 
Canó batted 15-for-32 (.469). The Dominican Republic defeated Puerto Rico 
3–0 in the finals to win the championship and became the first undefeated 
team in the tournament's history. Canó was named the Most Valuable Player 
of the Classic.[47] He joined teammates Octavio Dotel and Santiago Casilla 
as part of the four players to ever have won a World Series and World Baseball 
Classic, after Daisuke Matsuzaka completed the feat. The four were later 
joined by a fifth, Koji Uehara. Canó is noted for his charity work. Hackensack 
University Medical Center (in New Jersey) named a pediatric rehabilitation 
ward after him.[53] Cano has a son, also named Robinson, who lives with 
his mother in the Dominican Republic.[54] On November 13, 2012, Canó became
