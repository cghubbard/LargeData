As player As manager Charles Augustus "Kid" Nichols (September 14, 1869 
– April 11, 1953) was a Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher who played 
for the Boston Beaneaters, St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies 
from 1890 to 1906. A switch hitter who threw right-handed, he was listed 
at 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) and 175 pounds (79 kg). He is a member of 
the Baseball Hall of Fame. Nichols played minor league baseball for three 
teams until September 1889, when he signed for the Boston Beaneaters. After 
making his debut the following season and spending twelve seasons with 
the Beaneaters, Nichols spent a two-year sojourn in the minor leagues. 
He was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1904 and subsequently played 
for the Philadelphia Phillies, with whom he played his final game on May 
18, 1906. He is most famous for being the youngest pitcher to join the 
300 win club.[1] Nichols was born on September 14, 1869 in Madison, Wisconsin. 
His parents were Robert and Christina Nichols. His father had worked as 
a butcher and owned a grocery store with several locations in Madison. 
Robert had at least four children from a prior marriage to a woman named 
Sarah, who died of tuberculosis in 1859. Robert and Christina had several 
children together. Nichols's four-year-old sister Fannie died several years 
before Nichols was born; she accidentally set herself on fire while playing 
with matches.[2] The family moved from Madison to Kansas City, Missouri 
when Nichols was a child. While his siblings worked in the family butcher 
shop, Nichols pursued baseball.[3] Before he turned 18 years old, Nichols 
had debuted in the minor leagues with the 1887 Kansas City team in the 
Western League, earning an 18-12 win-loss record that season. He spent 
1888 between Kansas City of the Western Association and Memphis of the 
Southern League, finishing the year with a combined 27-10 record. In 1889, 
he registered a 39-8 record for the Omaha Omahogs of the Western Association.[4] 
Nichols entered the major leagues in 1890 with the Boston Beaneaters. Nichols 
recorded a 27–19 win-loss record, a 2.23 ERA and 222 strikeouts, beginning 
a string of ten consecutive seasons with 20 wins or more. Nichols also 
had a major league record seven 30-win seasons in this time (1891–1894, 
1896–1898) with a career high of 35 in 1892. The Beaneaters won several 
pennant races during Nichols' tenure, finishing in first place five times 
between 1891 and 1898. The team had 102 wins per season in 1892 and 1898, 
which stood as franchise highs until 1998. Baseball-Reference.com calculates 
that Nichols led the team in wins above replacement in 1890 and 1892 through 
1898.[5] Nichols had his first losing season in 1900, when he went 13–16. 
He improved to 19–16 the following year. After the 1901 season, Nichols 
purchased an interest in a minor league franchise in Kansas City. He left 
the Beaneaters to manage and pitch for the Kansas City club, where he won 
a total of 48 games in 1902 and 1903. After a two-year hiatus from the 
major leagues, Nichols returned to the 20-win plateau for the eleventh 
and final time in his career in 1904 for a new team, the St. Louis Cardinals. 
He finished his career in 1906 with the Philadelphia Phillies, who picked 
him up off waivers in 1905. Nichols retired with 361 wins, 208 losses, 
1,873 strikeouts and a 2.95 ERA. Nichols's win total was exceeded at the 
time only by Cy Young. His win total is the seventh highest total in major 
league history. His 5056 1⁄3 innings pitched ranks 11th all-time. He was 
the youngest pitcher to win 300 games,[1] reaching that milestone at the 
age of 30.[6] After baseball, Nichols dabbled in the motion picture industry, 
partnering with Joe Tinker in a business that distributed movies to theatres 
in the midwest. An accomplished bowler, Nichols also opened bowling alleys 
in the Kansas City area. He won Kansas City's Class A bowling championship 
at age 64.[7] Nichols was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1949. 
He was said to have been proud of two things: his Hall of Fame selection 
and the fact that he had never been replaced in a game by a relief pitcher.[8] 
In October 1952, the 83-year-old Nichols was admitted to Menorah Hospital 
in Kansas City to investigate a complaint with his neck. Doctors ordered 
tests, but Nichols would not submit to them until after the seventh game 
of the World Series ended. He was later diagnosed with carcinomatosis, 
cancer that had spread throughout his body. He died on April 11, 1953.[9]
