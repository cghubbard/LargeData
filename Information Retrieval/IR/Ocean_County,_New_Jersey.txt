Ocean County is a county located along the Jersey Shore in the U.S. state 
of New Jersey. Its county seat is Toms River,[2][5] which, like the county 
itself, has been one of the fastest growing areas of the state since the 
1990s. Ocean County had a Census-estimated population of 588,721 in 2015, 
a 2.1% increase from the 576,567 enumerated in the 2010 United States Census,[4] 
having increased by 65,651 (+12.8%) from the 2000 Census population of 
510,916,[6] surpassing Union County to become the fifth-most populous county 
in the state and making Ocean County the fastest growing in the state of 
New Jersey in terms of increase in the number of residents and second-highest 
in percentage growth.[7] Ocean County was established on February 15, 1850, 
from portions of Monmouth County, with the addition of Little Egg Harbor 
Township which was annexed from Burlington County on March 30, 1891.[1] 
The most populous place was Lakewood Township, with 92,843 residents at 
the time of the 2010 Census (up 32,491 since 2000, the largest population 
increase of any municipality in the state), while Jackson Township, covered 
100.62 square miles (260.6 km2), the largest total area of any municipality 
in the county.[8] Ocean County is located 50 miles (80 km) east of Philadelphia, 
70 miles (110 km) south of New York City, and 25 miles (40 km) north of 
Atlantic City, making it a prime destination for residents of these cities 
during the summer. As with the entire Jersey Shore, summer traffic routinely 
clogs local roadways throughout the season. Ocean County is part of the 
New York metropolitan area, and is home to many tourist attractions frequently 
visited by Delaware Valley residents, especially the beachfront communities 
of Seaside Heights, Long Beach Island, Point Pleasant Beach, as well as 
Six Flags Great Adventure, which is the home of the world's tallest and 
second-fastest roller coaster, Kingda Ka. Ocean County is also a gateway 
to New Jersey's Pine Barrens, one of the largest protected pieces of land 
on the East Coast. According to the United States Census Bureau, the county 
had as of the 2010 Census a total area of 915.40 square miles (2,370.9 km2), 
the second-largest county in New Jersey (behind Burlington County), of 
which 628.78 square miles (1,628.5 km2) of land (68.7%) and 286.62 square 
miles (742.3 km2) of water (31.31%).[8][9] Much of the county is flat and 
coastal, with many beaches. The highest point is one of three unnamed hills 
(one in Jackson Township, the other two in Plumsted Township) that reach 
at least 230 feet (70 m) in elevation.[10] The lowest elevation in the 
county is sea level. It is also home to many beaches on the Jersey Shore, 
such as Beach Haven, Ship Bottom, Surf City, Harvey Cedars and Barnegat 
Light. In recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Toms 
River have ranged from a low of 22 °F (−6 °C) in January to a high of 85 °F 
(29 °C) in July, although a record low of −19 °F (−28 °C) was recorded 
in January 1982 and a record high of 105 °F (41 °C) was recorded in July 
1999. Average monthly precipitation ranged from 3.30 inches (84 mm) in 
February to 4.79 inches (122 mm) in March.[11] Areas closer to the coast 
typically experience more mild winters and cooler summers due to the Atlantic 
Ocean's influence. At the 2010 United States Census, there were 576,567
