Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsanto ðoˈmiŋɡo] meaning "Saint 
Dominic"), officially Santo Domingo de Guzmán, is the capital and largest 
city in the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the 
Caribbean by population.[5] In 2010, its population was counted as 965,040,[1] 
rising to 2,908,607 when its surrounding metropolitan area was included.[4] 
The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional ("D.N.", 
"National District"), itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province. 
Founded by Bartholomew Columbus in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama 
River and then moved by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the 
river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement 
in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in 
the New World. Santo Domingo is the site of the first university, cathedral, 
castle, monastery, and fortress in the New World. The city's Colonial Zone 
was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[6][7] Santo Domingo was 
called Ciudad Trujillo (Spanish pronunciation: [sjuˈðað tɾuˈhiʎo]), from 
1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, 
named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city 
resumed its original designation. Santo Domingo is the cultural, financial, 
political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, 
with the country's most important industries being located within the city. 
Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's 
harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, 
and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures 
are high year round, with a cool breeze around winter time. Prior to the 
arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the native Taíno people populated 
the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti 
(land of high mountains), and which Columbus later named Hispaniola, including 
the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory 
consisted of five chiefdoms: Marién, Maguá, Maguana, Jaragua, and Higüey.[8] 
These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, 
Caonabo, Bohechío, and Cayacoa. Dating from 1496, when the Spanish settled 
on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became 
the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded 
the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement 
in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I.[9] In 1495 it was 
renamed "Santo Domingo", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came 
to be known as the "Gateway to the Caribbean" and the chief town in Hispaniola 
from then on.[10] Expeditions which led to Ponce de León's colonization 
of Puerto Rico, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando 
Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco Núñez de Balboa's sighting of the 
Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo. In June 1502,[11] Santo 
Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicolás 
de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama 
River.[12] The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive 
wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared 
a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In 1586, Francis Drake captured the city 
and held it for ransom.[13] Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish 
dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century 
by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside 
of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked 
the city of Santo Domingo, but was defeated. The English troops withdrew 
and took the less guarded colony of Jamaica, instead.[14] In 1697, the 
Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion 
over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. From 1795 to 1822 the 
city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. The city 
was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles, it was briefly captured 
by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again 
reclaimed by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of 
an independent nation after the Criollo bourgeois within the country, led 
by José Núñez de Cáceres, overthrew the Spanish crown. The nation was unified 
with Haiti just two months later. The city and the colony lost much of 
their Spanish-born peninsular population as a result of these events which 
caused a great deal of instability and unrest.[13][15][16] On 27 February 
1844 Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when it gained 
its independence from Haitian occupation, led by Dominican nationalist 
Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political 
factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country 
had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of 19 March, Battle 
of 30 March, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of 
the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with 
city streets named after them.[17] In 1861 Spain returned to the country, 
having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the 
latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange 
for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration 
War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the country was free again after 
Spain withdrew. Over the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and 
the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions, power changes, and 
occupation by the United States, 1916–24. The city was struck by hurricane 
San Zenón in 1930, which caused major damage.[18] After its rebuilding, 
Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of dictator 
Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Following his assassination 
in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo. It was the scene of 
street fighting during the 1965 United States occupation of the Dominican 
Republic. The year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, 
of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of America. The Columbus Lighthouse – 
Faro a Colón – was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, 
with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos.[19] The Ozama 
river flows 148 kilometres (92 miles) before emptying into the Caribbean 
Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the 
city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. 
The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located. The average 
temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade 
winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to 
these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences 
the heat that one may expect to find. December through March are the coolest 
months with hot days with less humidity and fresh nights (temperatures 
of 17 to 19 °C (63 to 66 °F)). July through September are the warmest. 
Santo Domingo averages 1,445 millimetres (56.9 in) of rain annually. Its 
driest months are from November through April, however, due to the trade 
winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. 
Because its driest month is just below 60 millimetres (2.4 in), Santo Domingo 
falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the Köppen climate 
classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo 
is very susceptible to hurricanes. The lowest recorded temperature has 
been 13.0 °C (55.4 °F) and the highest 39.5 °C (103.1 °F). Many of Santo 
Domingo's most notable landmarks are located within the Zona Colonial district 
of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The Colonial Zone, 
bordered by the Río Ozama, also has an impressive collection of early 16th 
century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that 
reflect the architectural style of the late Middle Ages. The city's most 
important historical buildings include the Catedral Santa María La Menor, 
called La Catedral Primada de América, America's First Cathedral, which 
states its distinction; the Alcázar de Colón, America's first castle, once 
the residence of Viceroy of the Indies Don Diego Colón, a son of Christopher 
Columbus; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery 
in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales, in a monumental complex 
that includes the former Palace of the Governors and the building of the 
former Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest 
fortress in the Americas; the Pantéon Nacional, a former Jesuit edifice 
now hosting the remains of various renowned Dominicans; and the Dominican 
Convent, the first convent in the Americas. On the north end of Calle Las 
Damas, the restored and expanded Plaza de España is bordered by Las Atarazanas 
(former naval yard, now a museum) and a number of small shops and restaurants. 
This area was the first European commercial center in the Americas, and 
is still a hub of activity today. The Alcázar de Colón, having once been 
the colonial palace of the Columbus family—beginning with his son Diego 
– is now a museum displaying period furniture and decorations. The building 
was originally built in 1510, and restored to its current appearance in 
1952. A 700 million US dollar investment was made in the Port of the Ozama 
river adjacent to the Ciudad Colonial aiming to turn Santo Domingo into 
a port of call for luxury cruise ships and including a privately owned 
marina. The project is being completed by Sans Soucí Ports S.A. The city 
proper of Santo Domingo is subdivided into incorporated areas (neighbourhoods) 
called sectores which could be considered as small urban towns. All sectores 
are serviced directly by the municipal mayor's office. Sector regions: 
The demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas 
of the country, except that the population of immigrants (mainly Haitians) 
is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and 
the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like 
most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though 
there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well 
as a large immigrant community. In fact, over 20% of the city's population 
is immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants 
from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the 
city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly 
Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian 
people) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers 
of Venezuelans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as US born Dominicans 
returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the 
city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is 
also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. 
The city is one of the most economically developed cities in Latin America. 
Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan 
area. Santo Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican 
Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme 
Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in 
the metropolitan area. The city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del 
Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions.[22] 
The current mayor of Santo Domingo is David Collado. The "Policía Nacional" 
(National Police) and "Policia Turística" (Tourist Police) (POLITUR) are 
tasked with enforcing city safety. The city is the center of economic activity 
in the Dominican Republic. It is where most of the country's wealth is 
concentrated and the seat of the national legislature, judicial, and executive 
government. Many national and international firms have their headquarters 
or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international 
firms and franchises such as Ikea, Goldcorp and Barrick due to its geographic 
location and economic stability. The infrastructure is suitable for most 
business operations. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete 
globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. Santo Domingo and the 
Dominican Republic as whole enjoy a modern and extensive telecommunications 
system liberalized in the late 1990s which has benefited from extensive 
foreign investment. This has attracted numerous call centers in recent 
years. Santo Domingo not only has an excellent telecommunications infrastructure 
but also a sizeable bilingual population that speaks English. The city's 
economic growth can be witnessed in the extensive vertical growth experienced 
across many of its neighborhood. The construction boom is reflected in 
the many high density residential towers, shopping malls, elevated highways, 
the metro expansion and overall increase in commercial activity. Santo 
Domingo has a thriving middle class contrasting with the significant pockets 
of poverty that remain as challenges for the future. Marginalized slum 
conditions exist mostly in the northeast quadrant of the city with smaller 
pockets extending across the city. Areas of extensive development include 
the Poligono Central, which is bordered by the Avenida John F. Kennedy 
northward 27 February Avenue south, Avenida Winston Churchill to the west 
and Avenida Máximo Gómez to the east, and is characterized by its mixed 
development and its very active nightlife. Santo Domingo has areas of high 
development, among them Serralles, Naco, Arroyo Hondo, Piantini, Urb Fernandez, 
Ens. Julieta, Paraiso, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, 
where most of the middle class can be found. Bella Vista and La Esperilla 
are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue 
belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known 
for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s. The performing arts 
are very important in Santo Domingo. The city has its own symphonic orchestra, 
chamber orchestra, opera company, ballet company, folkloric company, and 
national theater, including a number of smaller groups. The Plaza of culture 
is the center of activity, but there are concerts, ballet, folklore, and 
other performances throughout the city. Casa de Teatro is the gathering 
place of avant garde artists, actors, and musicians. It stages art and 
literature exhibitions and offers painting, drama, and dancing courses 
and monthly contests for poetry, short stories, and other forms of literature. 
Santo Domingo is the location of numerous museums, many of which are located 
in the Zona Colonial district.[19] In the Zona Colonial is the Museum of 
Alcázar, in Diego Colon's restored palace,[23] the Museum of the Casas 
Reales, with artefacts of the colonial period and a collection of ancient 
weapons donated by Trujillo,[24] the Naval Museum of the Atarazanas, in 
the former naval yards, Museo de la Catedral, Museo Memorial de la Resistencia 
Dominicana, documenting the struggle for freedom during the regimes of 
Trujillo and Balaguer, Museo Duarte, dedicated to the hero of Dominican 
independence, and the World of Ambar Museum. Plaza de la Cultura also houses 
the city's most important cultural venues, including the Teatro Nacional 
(National Theater) and various museums; the Palacio Nacional, which houses 
the Presidency of the Dominican Republic; the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace 
of Fine Arts), a neoclassical building that is the permanent home of the 
country's National Symphony Orchestra; and the Boulevard 27 de Febrero, 
a pedestrian promenade located on the busy Avenida 27 de Febrero, which 
displays works of art from prominent Dominican artists and sculptors. Another 
attraction is the Centro Olímpico Juan Pablo Duarte, a sports complex in 
the center of Santo Domingo. This complex was used during the 2003 Pan 
American Games. In the Plaza de la Cultura are the Museum of the Dominican 
Man, with artifacts from the pre-Columbian Taíno civilization, the National 
Museum of History and Geography, the Museum of Natural History and the 
Museum of Modern Art. Other museums include the Museo Bellapart, a prominent 
private collection of 19th- and 20th-Century Dominican painting and sculpture 
and the Museo Prehispanico, a major private collection of pre-Columbian 
Taíno art.[25] The city has various parks, many of which are relatively 
large. Santo Domingo (D.N) is surrounded by the Santo Domingo Greenbelt. 
Mirador Norte Park lies in the north of the city, close to Villa Mella 
and Mirador Sur Park is located in the southwest section of the city. Mirador 
del Este is located on the East bank of the Ozama river and it is the seat 
of the Columbus Lighthouse. Independencia Park and Colón Park are located 
in Zona Colonial. Other notable parks include: Private: Public: Nonprofit: 
There are eighteen universities in Santo Domingo, the highest number of 
any city in the Dominican Republic. Established in 1538, the Universidad 
Autónoma de Santo Domingo (UASD) is the oldest university in the Americas 
and is also the only public university in the city.[26][27] Santo Domingo 
holds the nation's highest percentage of residents with a higher education 
degree.[citation needed] Other universities include: Santo Domingo is the 
terminus for four of the five national highways. The city is connected 
to the southwest of the country by the national highway DR-2 (Avenida George 
Washington and Autopista 30 de Mayo), and with the cities of the country's 
northwest by DR-1 (Expreso Kennedy, Corredor Duarte), which serves as a 
direct link to the city of Santiago de los Caballeros. DR-3 (Expreso 27 
de Febrero/Autopista de Las Américas) connects Santo Domingo directly to 
the east of the country, including the cities of San Pedro de Macorís, 
La Romana, and major tourist sites such as Punta Cana and Bávaro, and to 
the Samaná Province (in the northeast) via the Samana Highway. In the city, 
motoconchos (motorcycle taxis), guaguas/voladoras (low quality public buses), 
and carros públicos/conchos (shared taxis) are common modes of transport.
