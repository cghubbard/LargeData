As player As manager Philip Ramond Regan (born April 6, 1937) is a former 
Major League Baseball player and manager, who currently serves as the pitching 
coach for the New York Mets' high A Florida State League affiliate, the 
St. Lucie Mets. During the 1966 season, when he was Walter Alston's favorite 
arm out of the Los Angeles Dodgers bullpen, teammate Sandy Koufax nicknamed 
him "The Vulture" due to his knack for earning wins in late-inning relief 
situations.[1] Regan earned varsity letters in basketball, football, and 
baseball at Wayland High School in Wayland, Michigan. After one year at 
Western Michigan University, he signed with the Detroit Tigers in 1956. 
He compiled a 61-42 record and 3.76 earned run average as a starting pitcher 
in the Tigers' farm system before earning a call up to the majors midway 
through the 1960 season. He made his major league debut on July 19 against 
the Washington Senators. Entering the game already behind 3-0, he allowed 
just two hits in five innings of work, including a home run to Harmon Killebrew.[2] 
He made his first career start in the second game of a doubleheader with 
the Baltimore Orioles on July 23. He left the game with two outs in the 
ninth inning with the score tied at three, and the bases loaded. Relief 
pitcher Clem Labine walked Jim Gentile to drive in the winning run, and 
hand Regan his first career loss.[3] Splitting his time between starts 
and relief appearances, he was 0-4 with a 4.50 ERA his rookie season. His 
first career win also came against Baltimore during his second season in 
the big leagues, when he went 10-7 with a 5.25 ERA.[4] Over six seasons, 
Regan went 42-44 with a 4.50 ERA for the Detroit Tigers. He was 0-4 with 
a 4.99Â ERA in 1965 when he was demoted to triple A Syracuse. He earned 
a call up that September, and made two appearances, but it was while he 
was with Syracuse that Regan learned of interest in him from the Dodgers 
organization.[5] Regan called Tigers General Manager Jim Campbell asking 
to be traded, and on December 15, 1965, he was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for infielder Dick Tracewski.[6] With Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, 
Claude Osteen and Don Sutton in the starting rotation, Regan was used strictly 
as a reliever with the Dodgers. He responded by going 14-1 with a 1.62 
ERA, 88 strikeouts in 116 innings pitched and a National League leading 
21 saves to help the Dodgers capture the NL pennant by a game and a half 
over the San Francisco Giants. The Sporting News named him the NL Reliever 
of the Year and NL Comeback Player of the Year in 1966. He also earned 
the only All-Star nod in his career, but did not appear in the game.[7] 
He appeared in two games of the 1966 World Series, allowing just one base 
runner via walk, and retiring the other five he faced.[8] Regan won his 
first two decisions in 1967 to give him fifteen consecutive wins before 
finally losing to the Houston Astros on May 15.[9] He won both games of 
a doubleheader with the New York Mets on April 21, 1968.[10][11] Two days 
later, he was traded with Jim Hickman to the Chicago Cubs for Jim Ellis 
and Ted Savage.[12] Regan provided similar heroics for his new team. In 
his first two appearances as a Cubs, he saved both games of an April 28 
doubleheader with the Houston Astros.[13] Despite missing the first fourteen 
games of the Cubs' schedule, Regan led all of Major League Baseball with 
25 saves in 1968 on his way to capturing a second Sporting News Reliever 
of the Year Award. He was involved in a bizarre incident on August 18 against 
the Cincinnati Reds. Regan apparently had good stuff that day, too good 
for home plate umpire Chris Pelekoudas. Despite no illegal substances being 
found on the ball, Pelekoudas called fourteen illegal pitches on Regan 
based simply on the movement of the ball. Regan met with NL President Warren 
Giles August 20, and was absolved of any wrongdoing.[14] The incident earned 
Regan a reputation that followed him the rest of his career.[15] During 
the twilight of his career, Regan found his workload diminishing rapidly. 
Through May 1972, Regan had pitched just four innings for the Cubs. He 
asked to be traded or released, and on June 2, his wish was granted. Regan's 
contract was sold to the crosstown Chicago White Sox.[16] He appeared in 
ten games for the Chisox, going 0-1 with a 4.05 ERA before his release 
on July 20. The only shutout of Regan's career came on May 10, 1963 against 
the Cleveland Indians. He also hit his only career home run in the 14-0 
drubbing of the Tribe.[17] Immediately, upon retirement, Regan went into 
coaching. He accepted his first coaching job at Grand Valley State University 
in his home state of Michigan simply because it was close to home.[18] 
He was head coach from 1973 to 1982, winning the Great Lakes Conference 
title and the NAIA District 23 Championship twice each.[19] His work at 
Grand Valley earned him a call from Seattle Mariners General Manager Dan 
O'Brien.[20] After spending the 1983 season as the Mariners' minor league 
pitching instructor and advance scout, he was promoted to major league 
pitching coach in 1984.[21] His tenure in Seattle was interrupted by a 
two-game suspension in 1985 when he bumped umpire Darryl Cousins during 
a bench clearing brawl between the M's and California Angels on August 
12.[22] He resigned from his position with the Mariners following the 1986 
season.[23] In 1987, he began a six-year stint with the Dodgers as their 
major league special assignment and advance scout. He was up for the Florida 
Marlins managerial job in 1992, but withdrew his name from consideration.[24] 
A year later, he joined the Cleveland Indians as pitching coach during 
the strike-shortened 1994 season. In 1995, he received his only major league 
managerial stint,[25] managing the Baltimore Orioles to a 71-73 record. 
After just one season at the helm, he was fired, and replaced by Davey 
Johnson.[26] The remainder of his professional coaching career is summarized
