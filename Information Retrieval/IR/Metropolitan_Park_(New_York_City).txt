Metropolitan Park is a former baseball ground located in East Harlem, Manhattan, 
New York. The ground was the part-time home to the New York Metropolitans 
of the American Association in 1884. The wooden ballpark was built a few 
blocks east and south from their first home, the original Polo Grounds, 
on a piece of land bounded by 109th Street (north), the East River (east), 
107th Street (south), and First Avenue (west). The Mets played their first 
game at Metropolitan Park on May 13, 1884, amid a degree of publicity.[1] 
However, the field proved unsatisfactory and the Mets returned to the Polo 
Grounds for games starting on July 17, 1884, except when the New York Giants 
were playing at home.[2] The final Mets game played at Metropolitan Park 
was on August 23, 1884.[3] The Mets then returned to their original Polo 
Grounds venue, in time to win the American Association pennant. Coordinates:
