Euro League Baseball (ELB) is a professional baseball league in Europe 
founded by the European Association of Professional Baseball (EAPB). The 
winner of an ELB season is awarded the Gregory Hallman trophy.[2] ELB played 
its inaugural season in 2016 with three teams: Draci Brno, Haar Disciples 
and Buchbinder Legionäre Regensburg.[3] The first championship was awarded 
to Draci Brno. EAPD holds a 60% stake in Euro League Baseball Ltd. which 
is the operator of the EBL and holds all naming and media rights as well 
as all partnership and sponsor contracts regarding Euro League Baseball. 
EAPB President Wim van den Hurk is the CEO of Euro League Baseball Ltd. 
The inaugural ELB season in 2016 was contested by three teams: Draci Brno, 
Haar Disciples, Buchbinder Legionäre Regensburg.[3] Each team played a 
total of 8 regular season games (4 at home and 4 away) between April and 
July.[14] A team called Amsterdam Baseball was founded with the purpose 
to compete in ELB, and to be run by the league. The backbone of the team 
was supposed to be players from Amsterdam Pirates, but also some previously 
retired players like Dirk van 't Klooster and Chris Mowday.[15] However, 
when the season was already well underway, Amsterdam Baseball had to withdraw 
from the league due to pressure from the European and Dutch baseball federations. 
This left the league with only three teams for its inaugural season.[16]
