Luis Emilio Gonzalez (born September 3, 1967 in Tampa, Florida), nicknamed 
"Gonzo",[1] is a former Major League Baseball outfielder. Gonzalez spent 
his best years with the Arizona Diamondbacks and was one of the most popular 
players in that organization's history. He delivered the game-winning hit 
in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series off Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees 
to give the Diamondbacks their first and only World Series championship 
to date. Gonzalez grew up in the West Tampa neighborhood of Tampa, Florida. 
He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1985 along with childhood 
friend Tino Martinez.[2] After high school, he attended the University 
of South Alabama, where he earned Baseball America's All-Freshman Second 
Team honors. He was drafted by the Houston Astros in the fourth round of 
the 1988 amateur draft. Gonzalez played American Legion Baseball for Post 
248. Other Post 248 alumni include Lou Piniella, Tony La Russa, Tino Martinez 
and Gary Sheffield. Gonzalez made his major league debut on September 4, 
1990. He finished the rest of the 1990 season with 4 hits (2 doubles). 
The year of 1991 became the first full season of Gonzalez's career. During 
1991, he batted .254 with 13 home runs and 69 RBI. In 1992, he batted .243 
with 10 home runs and 55 RBI. In 1993, he batted .300 with 15 home runs, 
72 RBI, and an NL leading 10 sacrifice flies. In 1994, he batted .273 with 
8 homers and 67 RBI. His 1995 season began with a .258 batting average, 
6 homers and 35 RBI. Gonzalez along with Scott Servais were traded to the 
Chicago Cubs for Rick Wilkins. Gonzalez finished the 1995 season with the 
Cubs by batting .290 with 7 homers and 34 RBI. Overall in 1995, Gonzalez 
had a .276 average, 13 homers and 69 RBI combined while he played with 
the Astros and Cubs. In 1996, Gonzalez batted .271 with 15 homers and 79 
RBI. Gonzalez signed a one-year deal to return to the Astros in 1997. During 
1997, he batted .258 with 10 homers and 68 RBI. Gonzalez signed a one-year 
deal for the Tigers in 1998. In 1998, he batted .267 with 23 homers and 
71 RBI. In 1999, Gonzalez was traded to the Diamondbacks for Karim Garc√≠a. 
Gonzalez began to become a star during his tenure with Arizona. He helped 
the Diamondbacks into title contention immediately, hitting a career-best 
.336 in 1999, leading the NL in hits with 206 and helping them win the 
National League's western division that season before the team fell to 
the New York Mets in a divisional playoff series. He was selected to his 
first All-Star Team in 1999. In 2000, the Diamondbacks came in third place 
in their division. He also blasted 31 home runs and cracked 192 hits. In 
2001, Gonzalez astonished many when he hit 57 home runs, his personal best 
for one season and almost twice as many as he hit in any other season. 
The total is the third most in National League history for a left-handed 
batter (behind Barry Bonds's record 73, which also came in 2001, and Ryan 
Howard, who hit 58 in 2006). Gonzalez was selected to his second All-Star 
Team and finished second in the National League in hits with 198. Gonzalez 
also won the Home Run Derby that year. The Diamondbacks reached the World 
Series that year and faced off against the New York Yankees, who featured 
Gonzalez's childhood friend Tino Martinez starting at 1st base.[2] In the 
climactic moment, Gonzalez came to the plate in the bottom of the 9th inning 
of game 7, with the score even at 2-2, the bases loaded and 1 out. The 
Yankee pitcher was Mariano Rivera, one of the game's most feared closers 
with an especially good record in the postseason (Rivera had never blown 
a save chance in a World Series before, or since). Gonzalez swung at Rivera's 
0-1 pitch and hit the game-winning bloop single into left field that sealed 
the first franchise World Series title for Arizona. He was also selected 
to All-Star Teams in 2002 and 2003. During the 2002 season, Gonzalez received 
publicity as a piece of gum chewed by Gonzalez during a spring training 
game was sold for $10,000 on April 15, 2002.[3] The buyer was Curt Mueller, 
owner of Mueller Sports Medicine Inc., manufacturer of the gum, Quench.[4] 
On May 22, 2004, Gonzalez got his 2,000th career hit in a game against 
the Florida Marlins, though his season ended early when he had Tommy John 
surgery in August.[5] In 2005, he was selected to his fifth All-Star Team. 
On April 18, 2006, he got his 500th career double, becoming the 20th player 
in Major League history to hit 500 doubles and 300 home runs. On May 13, 
2006,[6] he passed Babe Ruth for 38th place all-time for the most doubles 
hit in league history. On June 15, 2006, The Arizona Republic printed an 
interview by columnist E. J. Montini with Diamondback managing general 
partner Ken Kendrick. In the interview, Kendrick mentioned whispers of 
alleged steroid use by Gonzalez; in the interview Kendrick never directly 
accused Gonzalez of using performance-enhancing drugs.[7] The interview 
came 8 days after Diamondback relief pitcher Jason Grimsley was released 
by the team after the team learned that federal agents had searched his 
home looking for evidence that he was a distributor of human growth hormone 
and other performance-enhancing drugs. On June 16, 2006 an angry Gonzalez 
called a press conference to deny that he had ever used steroids.[8] On 
September 14, 2006, the Diamondbacks announced that they would not pick 
up the team option of $10 million to re-sign Gonzalez after the 2006 season.[9] 
On December 7, Gonzalez signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for $7 million for the 2007 season.[10] Gonzalez hit his first 
home run as a Dodger on Sunday, April 8, 2007 versus Barry Zito of the 
San Francisco Giants. He hit two home runs in that game. In his only season 
with the Dodgers, he was productive offensively, but struggled defensively. 
Many times throughout the season, he would be taken out late in the game 
due to his bad defense. Towards the end of the season, he was benched in 
favor of Matt Kemp, a top Dodger prospect at the time. He was upset about 
it and publicly said he was not interested in returning to the Dodgers 
before the season was even over. He hit .278 with 15 home runs and 68 RBI 
in 2007. On February 7, 2008, he signed with the Florida Marlins. The deal 
was reportedly worth $2 million for 1 season.[11] Gonzalez played in 136 
games for the Marlins in 2008, batting .261. Gonzalez announced his retirement 
on August 29, 2009 and joined the Diamondbacks front office as a special 
assistant to the president.[12] In 2010, the Diamondbacks further announced 
that Gonzalez would be the first Diamondbacks player to have his number, 
#20, retired on August 7.[13] With businessman and entrepreneur Anthony 
Conti, Gonzalez has founded IsTalking, LLC, a Phoenix-based company that 
develops new social networking Web sites exclusively for college students. 
The company launched a new social network with Arizona State University 
called ASUIsTalking.com.[14] He has also formed a partnership with the 
ASU Alumni Association to be the exclusive online social-network for its 
250,000 members. Gonzalez has served as a color commentator on ESPN Radio's 
broadcasts of National League Division Series games in recent years, and 
also worked on Fox Sports' television broadcast of the 2006 National League 
Championship Series. Gonzalez formerly owned and operated a restaurant 
called Gonzo's, located in oldtown/downtown Gilbert, Arizona. It then changed 
name several times, and as of March, 2007, it is called "The Grain Belt". 
The restaurant closed in 2009. In 2012, Postinos opened its 3rd Arizona 
location in its place. Gonzalez is a prominent member of the U.S.Republican 
Party. As a resident of Arizona, he wrote a letter of endorsement for Arizona's 
Junior Senator, Jon Kyl, who won his bid for re-election in 2006.[15] He 
also endorsed Arizona's other Senator, 2008 GOP Presidential Nominee John 
McCain, over former congressman J.D. Hayworth in 2010.[16] Gonzalez was 
also the Celebrity face for a cornfield maze in Queen Creek, Arizona for 
the Schnepf Farms' annual Celebrity Maze. Gonzalez is the first local celebrity 
featured. Oprah Winfrey, Larry King and Jay Leno were featured in the past.[17] 
Gonzalez currently serves as a member of the board of the Baseball Assistance 
Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major 
League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical 
hardships. The Diamondbacks built a Little League ballfield in his honor 
at Tempe Beach Park in Tempe, Arizona. Gonzalez was inducted into the Hispanic 
Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on July 9, 2011 at the MLB All-Star 
Fan Fest in Phoenix. Gonzalez and his family (which includes wife Christine 
and triplets Megan, Jacob and Alyssa) are residents of Scottsdale, Arizona.
