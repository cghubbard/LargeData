Edward Frank Mierkowicz (born March 6, 1924), nicknamed "Butch" and "Mouse," 
is a former Major League Baseball outfielder who played four seasons with 
the Detroit Tigers (1945, 1947â€“48) and St. Louis Cardinals (1950). Born 
in Wyandotte, Michigan, Mierkowicz was the son of a factory worker who 
made gaskets. He lettered in three sports at Roosevelt High School in Wyandotte 
and caught the eye of legendary Detroit scout, Wish Egan, during a high 
school baseball game. But upon graduating from high school, Mierkowicz 
was called up by the Army in 1942. Mierkowicz was discharged after contracting 
rheumatic fever and was signed by Egan and the Detroit Tigers. Mierkowicz 
played in Hagerstown, Maryland in 1944 and in Buffalo in 1945. At the end 
of the 1945 season, with the Tigers in a pennant race, Mierkowicz was called 
up. He played in 10 games in his rookie season, batting .133 for a Tigers 
team that won the 1945 World Series. Mierkowicz stayed with the team for 
the World Series and was put in as a defensive replacement for Hank Greenberg 
in the 9th inning of Game 7.[1] Mierkowicz did not bat in the Series but 
he received a World Series ring in his rookie season.[1] In 1946, Mierkowicz 
spent most of the season in the minor leagues with Buffalo, but he did 
play in 21 games with the Tigers, batting .190. In 1948, he appeared in 
3 games. He finished his major career on April 19, 1950 with the St. Louis 
Cardinals. He struck out in his one and only at bat for the Cardinals. 
Mierkowicz continued to play professional baseball until 1957, including 
stints in Cuba, Mexico, and the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast 
League in 1955. After his baseball career ended, Mierkowicz worked for 
24 years at a waste treatment plant in Wyandotte, Michigan. He retired 
in 1984. He said his Major League career "was like a cup of coffee but 
no cream" but added that "God gave me the ability to play ball. Made a 
pretty good living. We didn't make a lot of money, but it was a lot of 
fun."[1] With the death of Virgil Trucks in 2013, Mierkowicz became the 
last living Tiger to play in the 1945 World Series and the last player 
to have played against the Cubs in a World Series until 2016.[1] There 
are no living players who played in an earlier World Series for the winning
