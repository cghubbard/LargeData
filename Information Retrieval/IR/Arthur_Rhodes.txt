Arthur Lee Rhodes, Jr. (born October 24, 1969) is a former Major League 
Baseball left-handed relief pitcher. Rhodes played high school baseball 
at La Vega High School in Waco, Texas. He was drafted by the Baltimore 
Orioles in the 2nd round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft. During 
his 1991 season with the class AA Hagerstown Suns, Rhodes was selected 
as Eastern League Pitcher of the Year. Rhodes made his MLB debut with the 
Orioles in 1991, and then spent 12 years in the Baltimore organization 
before being granted free agency after the 1999 season. After signing and 
playing with the Seattle Mariners for four years, he signed with the Oakland 
Athletics. A's manager Ken Macha first used him as a closer after years 
as a successful setup man in Seattle, but he failed in this capacity with 
a number of blown saves and was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, along 
with Mark Redman and cash for catcher Jason Kendall and cash after the 
one season with the Athletics. In the same offseason, the Pirates traded 
him on to the Cleveland Indians for Matt Lawton, and as he did in Seattle 
became the top setup man for the Tribe. On January 27, 2006, after one 
year in Cleveland, the Indians traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies 
for outfielder Jason Michaels. On January 24, 2007, Rhodes was re-signed 
by the Mariners to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring 
training by the Mariners, but injured his pitching arm, underwent Tommy 
John surgery and missed the entire 2007 season, becoming a free agent after 
the season. On January 15, 2008, the Mariners once again signed him to 
a minor league deal and invited him to spring training. He didn't make 
the team to start the season, but on April 14 was added to the active roster. 
On July 31, 2008, the Mariners traded him to the Florida Marlins in exchange 
for pitching prospect Gaby Hernandez.[1] On December 12, 2008, Rhodes signed 
a two-year deal with the Cincinnati Reds.[2] On June 29, 2010, his major 
league record-tying streak of 33 scoreless appearances was broken by Phillies 
slugger Raúl Ibáñez. In 2010, Rhodes was selected to his first All-Star 
Game in his 20th major league season. He was the fifth player to go to 
his first All-Star Game after age 40, joining Satchel Paige, Connie Marrero, 
Jamie Moyer and Tim Wakefield. On December 23, 2010, Rhodes signed a one-year 
deal with the Texas Rangers with a vesting option for 2012. He was designated 
for assignment on August 2, 2011[3] and was released on August 8. On August 
11, he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. Given the late signing, the 
Rangers had to pay most of his salary, with the Cardinals responsible for 
only a pro-rated league minimum for the remainder of the year. Because 
the Cardinals and Rangers faced each other in the 2011 World Series this 
created an unusual situation, with the Rangers paying most of the salary 
of a player trying to deny them a world championship. This also resulted 
in Rhodes being eligible to receive a World Series ring no matter who won.[4] 
The Cardinals won the World Series against the Texas Rangers in 7 games. 
Rhodes, who pitched in three games in this Series, joined Lonnie Smith 
as the only players to play in a World Series for the winning team against 
the team he had played for earlier in the season (Smith played on the 1985 
World Series-winning Kansas City Royals after having been traded from the 
Cardinals, whom the Royals defeated in the Series, earlier in the season). 
Through 2011, Rhodes was second among active pitchers in games played (900), 
and seventh in hits per 9 innings pitched (7.828) and strikeouts per 9 
IP (8.730).[5] While he had been the tenth-youngest player in the AL as 
a rookie in 1991, he was the third-oldest player in the AL in 2011.[5] 
According to the Baseball Almanac, he also holds the major league record 
for most holds in a career, with 215 as of 2010,[6] but has increased his 
lead to 231 by the end of the 2012 season.[7] Rhodes officially announced
