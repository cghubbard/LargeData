John Henry "Jack" Drees[1] was an American sportscaster who worked for 
ABC and CBS, as well as various stations in Chicago. Drees was born on 
February 8, 1917 in Chicago.[1] He attended Austin High School and the 
University of Iowa, where he was an all-Big Ten center on the Iowa Hawkeyes 
men's basketball team.[2] After graduating, he went to work for WJJD in 
Chicago as a secondary baseball play-by-play announcer to John Harrington.[3] 
His first day on the air was May 23, 1938.[2] In addition to baseball, 
Drees also called National Football League games and horse races from Sportsman's 
Park for WJJD and sister station WIND.[2][3] Although he had never seen 
a horse race prior to calling one, Drees became "the most accurate and 
respected horse race announcer in the country" according to Jack Brickhouse.[2] 
During World War II, Drees served 35 months in the United States Navy.[3] 
He served 33 months at sea as a gunnery officer on a merchant ship and 
rose to the rank of lieutenant.[2][4] After the war, Drees returned to 
WJJD and WIND, but the stations had dropped their sports coverage.[4] He 
later moved to Los Angeles, where he called horse races and served as Public 
Relations director for the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football 
Conference.[3] After the league folded in 1949, he returned to Chicago, 
where he called horse races and college football.[3][4] Drees first television 
role was co-hosting Pabst Blue Ribbon Bouts with Russ Hodges.[3] His television 
broadcast of the 1963 Sonny Liston-Floyd Patterson world heavyweight championship 
fight drew the largest audience in history up to that point.[2] In 1954 
he was hired by ABC to announce college football games with Tom Harmon. 
In 1960, he was hired by CBS to call St. Louis Cardinals football games.[4] 
In 1967/68 he called Super Bowl I and II for the CBS Radio Network.[2] 
In addition to NFL games, Drees also called college football, golf, and 
horse races for CBS. He returned to ABC, and in 1972, hosted a 5-minute 
daily broadcast on the American Information Radio Network. During the 1960s, 
Drees broadcast the Illinois state high school basketball tournaments on 
WGN-TV. He also hosted a program on WGN-TV called "Sports Unlimited".[2] 
He was the play-by-play voice for Chicago White Sox telecasts on WFLD from 
1968 through 1972. His broadcast partners were Dave Martin (1968), Mel 
Parnell (1969), Billy Pierce (1970) and Bud Kelly (1971â€“1972).[5] In 1974 
Drees and James C. Mullen published a book entitled Where Is He Now? Sports 
Heroes of Yesterday - Revisited. From 1977 to 1985 he worked for WKRG-TV 
in Mobile, Alabama.[1] In 1986 he retired to Dallas.[2] Drees died on July 
27, 1988 of cancer at his Dallas home. He was 71 years old.[2][4] Drees 
and his wife Mary were married on August 16, 1939. They had three children.[1]
