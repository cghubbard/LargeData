WPIX The New York Yankees' 1983 season was the 81st season for the Yankees. 
The team finished in third place in the American League Eastern Division 
with a record of 91-71, finishing 7 games behind the Baltimore Orioles. 
New York was managed by Billy Martin. The Yankees played their home games 
at Yankee Stadium. For the fourth straight spring training, the Yankees 
played an exhibition game at the Louisiana Superdome. On March 27, 1983, 
the Yankees beat the Toronto Blue Jays 2 to 1 behind six shutout innings 
from Doyle Alexander. Attendance was 15,129 for the game.[9] The Pine Tar 
Game refers to a controversial incident that took place in an American 
League baseball game played between the Kansas City Royals and New York 
Yankees on July 24, 1983. Playing at New York's Yankee Stadium, the Royals 
were trailing 4-3 with two outs in the top of the ninth and U L Washington 
on first base. In the on deck circle, George Brett was heard remarking 
to a teammate, "Watch this baby fly" as he shook his bat. He then came 
to the plate and connected off Yankee reliever Rich "Goose" Gossage for 
a two-run home run and a 5-4 lead. As Brett crossed the plate, New York 
manager Billy Martin approached home plate umpire Tim McClelland and requested 
that Brett's bat be examined. Earlier in the season, Martin and other members 
(most notably, third baseman Graig Nettles, who as a member of the Minnesota 
Twins, recalled a similar incident involving Thurman Munson) of the Yankees 
had noticed the amount of pine tar used by Brett, but Martin had chosen 
not to say anything until the home run. With Brett watching from the dugout, 
McClelland and the rest of the umpiring crew inspected the bat. Measuring 
the bat against the width of home plate (which is 17Â inches), they determined 
that the amount of pine tar on the bat's handle exceeded that allowed by 
Rule 1.10(b) of the Major League Baseball rule book, which read that "a 
bat may not be covered by such a substance more than 18 inches from the 
tip of the handle." [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
