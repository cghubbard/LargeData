William Yale Giles (born September 7, 1934 in Rochester, New York) is the 
Honorary National League President, chairman emeritus, and former[1] part 
owner of Major League Baseball's Philadelphia Phillies. He is the son of 
former National League president Warren C. Giles.[2] His baseball career 
began in his father's former organization, the Cincinnati Reds, during 
the 1950s and he was among a group of Reds executives (including former 
Cincinnati general manager Gabe Paul and MLB executive Tal Smith) who helped 
to found the Houston Astros when they debuted as the Colt .45s in 1962.[3] 
Sporting News' 1962 Official Baseball Guide and Record Book, published 
in the Colt .45s' maiden season, lists Giles as the club's traveling secretary 
and publicity director.[4] Subsequently, he became promotions director, 
and focused on that role after the renamed team moved into the Astrodome 
in 1965. Giles started with the Phillies as the vice president of business 
operations in 1969. He worked his way up in the organization, with stops 
as executive vice president and president, before becoming the chairman 
in 1997.[5] He became chairman emeritus in 2015, being succeeded as chairman 
by David Montgomery.[6] Giles was also part of the ownership group that 
bought the Phillies from the Carpenter family in 1981.[2] The group is 
composed of Giles, Montgomery, Claire S. Betz, Tri-Play Associates (Alexander 
K. Buck, J. Mahlon Buck Jr. and William C. Buck), and Double Play Inc. 
(John S. Middelton).[7] Mahlon Buck died in 2011.[8] The group reportedly 
purchased the team for $30 million. As of April 2008, the Phillies were 
valued at over $481 million by Forbes magazine.[9] Giles is also honorary 
president of the National League—the same job his father held on an official 
full-time basis. One of the honorary president's tasks is to present the 
Warren C. Giles Trophy—which is named after Giles' father, Warren—to the 
NLCS winner.[10] Other duties of the honorary league president include 
representing the league at the All-Star Game and the Postseason, among
