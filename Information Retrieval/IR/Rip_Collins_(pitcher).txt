Harry Warren (Rip) Collins (February 26, 1896 — May 27, 1968) was an American 
Major League Baseball player whose career as a starting pitcher for the 
New York Yankees (1920–21), Boston Red Sox (1922), Detroit Tigers (1923–27) 
and St. Louis Browns (1929–31) lasted eleven years. Collins batted and 
threw right-handed. A Texas native, Collins was born in the small city 
of Weatherford, a longtime seat of Parker County. Attending Texas A&M University, 
Collins was a four-sport star, chiefly known for his ability as a football 
punter. He was on the team when the heavily favored Longhorns took the 
field against the Aggies in 1915. Collins punted the ball twenty-three 
times that afternoon for an average of fifty-five yards per kick, that 
resulted in thirteen fumbles by Longhorns’ return men. One fumble set up 
the only touchdown scored that day, a run by Collins. The final score was 
13–0. In 1919, Collins became a starting pitcher for Double-A Dallas Rangers 
of the Texas League. A year later, he joined the New York Yankees. Collins 
was a 14-game winner three times during his majors career, in his 1920 
rookie season with the Yankees, for the Boston Red Sox in 1922, and with 
the Detroit Tigers in 1924. A member of the 1921 American League champion 
Yankees team, he relieved in Game Three of the World Series won by the 
New York Giants in seven games. He finished his major league career with 
the St. Louis Browns in 1931. Rip and his former Texas A&M Aggie teammate 
Topper Rigney both played together for the Detroit Tigers from 1923 to 
1925. In an 11-season career, Collins posted a 108–82 record with 569 strikeouts 
and a 3.99 ERA in 1712-1/3 innings pitched. Collins returned to the Texas 
League in 1933 to play one season with Fort Worth Cats and then retired 
from baseball. Following his playing career Collins joined the Texas Ranger 
Division. He was elected Travis County sheriff in 1940 and served for eight 
years. Then became police chief of the Brazos County city of Bryan in 1950 
and retired from law enforcement work in 1959. In the first years of Little 
League Baseball in Bryan, Chief Collins was one of the first managers.
