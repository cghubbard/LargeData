Baseball NSW is the governing body of baseball within New South Wales (NSW). 
Baseball NSW is governed by the Australian Baseball Federation. It is located 
in Rooty Hill in Greater Western Sydney, and is based at Blacktown Olympic 
Park.[1] Baseball NSW is responsible for selecting the NSW Patriots team 
to compete in the Claxton Shield; an annual, national baseball competition 
currently contested between the five mainland states of Australia. It governs 
all levels of baseball in the state, and directly runs the NSW Major League, 
considered to be the top level of competition in the state and the source 
of the majority of Australian-based players selected for the NSW Patriots.
