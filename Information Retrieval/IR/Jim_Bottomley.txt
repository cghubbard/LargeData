As player As manager James Leroy Bottomley (April 23, 1900 – December 11, 
1959) was an American professional baseball player. A first baseman, Bottomley 
played in Major League Baseball from 1922 through 1937 for the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, and St. Louis Browns. He also served as player-manager 
for the Browns in 1937. Playing for the Cardinals against Brooklyn at Ebbets 
Field on September 16, 1924, he set the all-time single game RBI record 
with 12.[1] Born in Oglesby, Illinois, Bottomley grew up in Nokomis, Illinois. 
He dropped out of high school at the age of 16 to raise money for his family. 
After playing semi-professional baseball, the Cardinals scouted and signed 
Bottomley. He won the League Award, given to the most valuable player, 
in 1928, and was a part of World Series championship teams in 1926 and 
1931. He played for the Cardinals through the 1932 season, after which 
he was traded to the Reds. After playing for Cincinnati for three years, 
he played two more seasons with the Browns. After finishing his playing 
career with the Browns, Bottomley joined the Chicago Cubs organization 
as a scout and minor league baseball manager. After suffering a heart attack, 
Bottomley and his wife retired to raise cattle in Missouri. Bottomley was 
nicknamed "Sunny Jim" because of his cheerful disposition. Bottomley was 
elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 by the Veterans Committee 
and to the Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014. Bottomley was born on April 
23, 1900, to Elizabeth (née Carter) and John Bottomley in Oglesby, Illinois. 
His family later moved to Nokomis, Illinois, where Bottomley enrolled in 
grade school and Nokomis High School.[2] He dropped out when he was 16 
years old in order to help support his family financially. Bottomley worked 
as a coal miner, truck driver, grocery clerk, and railroad clerk. His younger 
brother, Ralph, died in a mining accident in 1920.[3] Bottomley also played 
semi-professional baseball for several local teams to make additional money, 
earning $5 a game ($79 in current dollar terms).[3][4] A police officer 
who knew Branch Rickey, the general manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, 
saw Bottomley play, and recommended Bottomley to Rickey.[3] Rickey dispatched 
scout Charley Barrett to investigate Bottomley. The Cardinals decided to 
invite Bottomley to a tryout in late 1919, and signed him to a $150-a-month 
($2,051 in current dollar terms) contract.[3] Bottomley began his professional 
career in minor league baseball in 1920. That year, Bottomley played for 
the Mitchell Kernels of the Class-D South Dakota League, posting a .312 
batting average in 97 games, as Barrett continued to scout him.[5] He also 
played six games for the Sioux City Packers of the Class-A Western League. 
During his time in the minor leagues, the media began to call Bottomley 
"Sunny Jim", due to his pleasant disposition.[3] The next season, Bottomley 
played for the Houston Buffaloes of the Class-A Texas League.[3] Bottomley 
suffered a leg injury early in the season which became infected, and impeded 
his performance during the season. Bottomley managed only a .227 batting 
average in 130 games and struggled with his fielding. Unable to sell Bottomley 
to Houston for $1,200 after the season ($15,947 in current dollar terms), 
Rickey sold Bottomley to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class-AA International 
League for $1,000 ($13,289 in current dollar terms).[6] Fully recovered 
from his leg injury in 1922, Bottomley batted .348 with 14 home runs, 15 
triples, and a .567 slugging percentage for the Chiefs. After the season, 
the Cardinals purchased Bottomley from the Chiefs for $15,000 ($212,416 
in current dollar terms).[3] Bottomley made his Major League Baseball debut 
for the St. Louis Cardinals on August 18, 1922. Replacing Jack Fournier, 
Bottomley batted .325 in 37 games. The Cardinals named Bottomley their 
starting first baseman in 1923. As a rookie, Bottomley batted .371, finishing 
second in the National League (NL) behind teammate Rogers Hornsby, who 
batted .384. His .425 on-base percentage also finished second in the NL 
behind Hornsby, while he finished sixth in slugging percentage, with a 
.535 mark. His 94 runs batted in (RBIs) were tenth-best in the league.[7] 
Bottomley posted a .316 batting average in 1924.[3] In a game against the 
Brooklyn Dodgers on September 16, 1924, Bottomley set the major league 
record for RBIs in a single game, with 12, breaking Wilbert Robinson's 
record of 11, set in 1892. Robinson was serving as the manager of the Dodgers 
at the time.[3][8] This mark has since been tied by Mark Whiten in 1993.[9] 
Finishing the season with 111 RBIs, placing third in the NL, Bottomley's 
14 home runs were seventh-best in the NL, while his .500 slugging percentage 
was good for tenth.[10] Bottomley hit .367 in 1925, finishing second in 
the NL to Hornsby. He led the NL with 227 hits, while his 128 RBIs were 
third-best, and his .413 on-base percentage was seventh-best in the league.[11] 
Bottomley batted .298 during the 1926 season, with an NL-leading 120 RBIs. 
His 19 home runs placed second in the NL, behind Hack Wilson's 21, while 
his .506 slugging percentage was sixth-best.[12] He batted .345 in the 
1926 World Series, as the Cardinals defeated the New York Yankees.[3] In 
1927, Bottomley finished the season with 124 RBIs, fourth best in the league, 
and a .509 slugging percentage, finishing sixth in the NL.[13] Bottomley 
hit .325 with 31 home runs and 136 RBIs in 1928, leading the league in 
home runs and RBIs.[14] He also became the second Major League player in 
history to join the 20–20–20 club. That year, he won the League Award, 
given to the most valuable player of the NL.[15] The Cardinals reached 
the 1928 World Series, and Bottomley batted .214 as they lost to the New 
York Yankees.[16] In 1929, Bottomley hit 29 home runs, finishing seventh 
in the NL, while his 137 RBIs were fifth-best, and his .568 slugging percentage 
placed him in eighth.[17] After having what manager Gabby Street considered 
a "poor year" in 1930,[18] Bottomley struggled in the 1930 World Series, 
batting .045 in 22 at-bats, as the Cardinals lost to the Philadelphia Athletics. 
Following the series, Bottomley described his World Series performance 
as "a bust as far as hitting goes".[19][20][21] Amid questions about Bottomley's 
status with the Cardinals heading into the 1931 season, he demonstrated 
renewed hitting ability during spring training.[22] Despite the presence 
of Ripper Collins, a superior fielder who transferred to the Cardinals 
from the Rochester Red Wings of the International League, Street announced 
that Bottomley would remain the starting first baseman.[23] However, Bottomley 
suffered an injury and struggled early in the 1931 season after returning 
to the game, and it appeared that he might lose his job to Collins, who 
filled in for Bottomley during his injury.[24] Bottomley returned to form 
after his return, and he finished the season with a .3482 batting average, 
placing third behind teammate Chick Hafey's .3489 and Bill Terry's .3486, 
the closest batting average finish in MLB history.[3] His .534 slugging 
percentage was the sixth best in the league.[25] The Cardinals reached 
the 1931 World Series, with Bottomley batting .160, as the Cardinals defeated 
the Athletics.[26] That offseason, other teams began to attempt to trade 
for either Bottomley or Collins.[27] Bottomley batted .296 in 1932, though 
he only played in 91 games.[3] After the 1932 season, the Cardinals traded 
Bottomley to the Cincinnati Reds for Ownie Carroll and Estel Crabtree, 
in an attempt to partner Bottomley with Chick Hafey in developing a more 
potent offensive attack. Bottomley had also sought Cincinnati's managerial 
position that offseason, which instead went to Donie Bush.[28][29] Bottomley 
threatened to quit baseball in a salary dispute with the Reds, as he attempted 
to negotiate a raise from his $8,000 salary ($146,488 in current dollar 
terms), a reduction from the $13,000 salary ($225,851 in current dollar 
terms) he earned with the Cardinals the previous year.[30] He and the Reds 
eventually came to terms on a one-year contract believed to be worth between 
$10,000 and $13,000.[31] Bottomley finished eighth in the NL with 83 RBIs 
in 1933, and ninth with 13 home runs.[32] In three seasons with the Reds, 
Bottomley failed to hit higher than .283 or record more than 83 RBIs in 
a season. Bottomley left the Reds during spring training in 1935 due to 
a salary dispute,[33] deciding to return to the team in April.[34] Before 
the 1936 season, the Reds traded Bottomley to the St. Louis Browns of the 
American League (AL), who were managed by Hornsby, for Johnny Burnett.[35] 
During a July road trip, Bottomley announced his retirement as a result 
of an injured back;[36][37] however, he changed his mind and decided to 
remain with the team.[38] Bottomley batted .298 for the 1936 season.[3] 
Bottomley decided to return to baseball in 1937.[39] When the Browns struggled 
during the 1937 season, beginning the season with a 25–52 win-loss record, 
the Browns fired Hornsby and named Bottomley their player-manager.[3][40] 
Bottomley led the Browns to 21 more victories, as the team finished the 
season in eighth place, with a 46–108 record. The Browns trailed the seventh 
place Athletics by 9 1⁄2 games, and were 56 games out of first place. As 
a player, Bottomley batted .239 in 65 games during the 1937 season.[3] 
Bottomley was among the ten oldest players in the AL that year.[41] The 
Browns did not retain Bottomley after the 1937 season,[42] replacing him 
with Street, who served as his first assistant during the 1937 season.[43] 
In 1938, Bottomley served as the player-manager of Syracuse. After a bad 
start to the season, and with team president Jack Corbett not adding capable 
players, Bottomley resigned and was replaced with Dick Porter.[44] Bottomley 
also indicated that he did not want to continue playing.[45] Bottomley 
also holds the single-season record for most unassisted double plays by 
a first baseman, with eight. Bottomley is also known as the only man to 
be sued for hitting a home run when a fan was hit by the ball when he was 
not looking. He had over 100 RBIs in each season from 1924 to 1929. Bottomley 
was the second player in baseball history to hit 20 or more doubles, triples, 
and home runs in one season (Frank Schulte being the first)[46] and the 
first of two players (Lou Gehrig being the other) to collect 150 or more 
doubles, triples, and home runs in a career.[47] Bottomley married Elizabeth 
"Betty" Browner, who operated a St. Louis beauty parlor, on February 4, 
1933.[48] The couple had no children.[3] After he retired from baseball 
in 1938, Bottomley and his wife moved to the Bourbon, Missouri, area, where 
he raised Hereford cattle.[3] In 1939, Bottomley became a radio broadcaster, 
signing a deal with KWK, an AM broadcasting station, to broadcast Cardinals 
and Browns games.[49][50] Bottomley returned to baseball as a scout for 
the Cardinals in 1955.[51] In 1957, he joined the Chicago Cubs as a scout[52] 
and managed the Pulaski Cubs of the Class D Appalachian League. While managing 
in Pulaski, Bottomley suffered a heart attack. The Bottomleys moved to 
nearby Sullivan, Missouri.[3] Bottomley died of a heart ailment in December 
1959.[53] He and his wife Betty were interred in the International Order 
of Odd Fellows Cemetery, Sullivan, Missouri.[3] Bottomley was elected to 
the Baseball Hall of Fame posthumously in 1974 by the Veterans Committee. 
The Baseball Writers' Association of America charged that the Veterans 
Committee was not selective enough in choosing members.[54] Charges of 
cronyism were levied against the Veterans Committee.[55] When Bottomley 
was elected, the Veterans Committee included Frankie Frisch, a teammate 
of Bottomley's with the Cardinals. Frisch and Bill Terry, also a member 
of the Veterans Committee at the time, shepherded the selections of teammates 
Jesse Haines in 1970, Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, Ross Youngs 
in 1972, George Kelly in 1973, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976.[56] This 
led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years.[57] 
In 2014, the Cardinals announced Bottomley among 22 former players and 
personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum 
for the inaugural class of 2014.[58] The city park in Sullivan is named 
for Bottomley.[3] A museum in Nokomis, Illinois, the Bottomley-Ruffing-Schalk 
Baseball Museum, is dedicated to Bottomley and fellow Hall of Famers Ray
