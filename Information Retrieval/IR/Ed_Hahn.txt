William Edgar Hahn (August 27, 1875 – November 29, 1941) was an outfielder 
in Major League Baseball from 1905 to 1910. He played for the Chicago White 
Sox and New York Highlanders. Hahn, who was born in Nevada, Ohio, started 
his professional baseball career at the age of 27 in the Cotton States 
League. In August 1905, he was batting .305 for the New Orleans Pelicans[1] 
and was purchased by the American League's Highlanders. He got off to a 
slow start in 1906 and was sold to the White Sox.[2] He became the team's 
starting right fielder. Hahn batted just .227 for the season but ranked 
third in the league in walks (72) and hits by pitches (11).[3] His style 
of play fit right in with the White Sox, who were known as "the Hitless 
Wonders."[4] The White Sox won the pennant and faced the heavily favored 
Chicago Cubs in the 1906 World Series. Hahn, the team's leadoff hitter,[4] 
was the first batter of the series. He went 0 for 6 during the first two 
games. In game 3, he was hit in the face by a Jack Pfiester curveball and 
suffered a broken nose. He walked to the Cook County Hospital, which was 
a block away, for treatment.[5] The next day, he was back on the field 
for game 4, wearing a rubber air hose on his nostril. He received "loud 
and long" cheers from the crowd at his appearance.[6] After getting hit, 
Hahn went 6 for 14 (.429) against the Cubs' pitching.[7] He scored two 
runs in game 5 and two more in game 6 as the White Sox pulled off one of 
the biggest upsets in World Series history.[8] It was the team's first 
Series win.[9] 1907 was Hahn's best season in the major leagues. He finished 
in the league's top five in runs (87) scored, walks (84), and hits by pitches 
(12), while batting .255. He also led all outfielders with a .990 fielding 
percentage.[3] Hahn had another solid year in 1908. However, he hit poorly 
in 1909 and 1910 and then went down to the minors. In 1911, he was a player-manager 
for the Mansfield Brownies of the Ohio–Pennsylvania League. He then played 
five seasons for the Western League's Des Moines Boosters before retiring.[1] 
Hahn had owned a pottery business during the offseasons.[2] After his baseball 
days were over, he became a night watchman for a cement company plant in
