As Player As Manager Benjamin Harrison Taylor (July 1, 1888 – January 24, 
1953) was an American first baseman and manager in baseball's Negro leagues. 
Taylor played for the Birmingham Giants,[1] Chicago American Giants, Indianapolis 
ABC's,[4] St. Louis Giants, Bacharach Giants, Washington Potomacs, Harrisburg 
Giants, and Baltimore Black Sox. His playing career played lasted from 
1908 to 1929. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Taylor 
was born in Anderson, South Carolina. He was the youngest of four brothers 
who all became famous in baseball, including C.I., Candy Jim and Johnny 
"Steel Arm". Taylor initiated his career as a pitcher for the Birmingham 
Giants in 1908. After playing for the St. Louis Giants (1911–12), New York 
Lincoln Giants (1912) and Rube Foster's Chicago American Giants (1913–14), 
Taylor made his name playing for the team one of his brothers, C.I. Taylor, 
managed and owned, the Indianapolis ABCs. Following a 1915 season in which 
he hit .308, he set Cuba ablaze, hitting .500 in winter league play. He 
took that hot bat into the 1916 championship season. Ben went 11-for-18 
in the World Series, stealing three bases in five games. Other than a 1919 
season split between Hilldale and a managerial stint with the Bacharach 
Giants, Ben played with the ABCs from 1914 to 1922. In that final season, 
he replaced C.I. as manager, following his death. In 1923, Taylor organized 
the Washington Potomacs, bringing brother Johnny along as pitching coach. 
The team joined the new Eastern Colored League in its inaugural season 
the following year. Defensively, he was good on ground balls and could 
execute all the plays at first, making the other infielders look good by 
digging out low throws and making difficult plays with such ease that they 
appeared routine. Ben continued as a player/manager, joining Harrisburg 
in 1925 and the Baltimore Black Sox from 1926 to 1928. He was then traded 
to the Bacharach Giants in exchange for their manager Dick Lundy prior 
to the 1929 campaign, the final season of his playing career. In all but 
one of his first 16 seasons, Taylor batted over .300. During his career, 
he was also a manager and excellent teacher of young players. It was from 
him that Buck Leonard learned to polish and refine his skills as a first 
baseman. He continued to coach and manage until 1940. After retiring, Taylor 
was an active businessman, operating a poolroom and acquiring the rights 
to print and sell game programs at Baltimore Elite Giants games. In a 1949 
Philadelphia Evening Bulletin article, Oscar Charleston selected Ben Taylor 
as his first baseman on his all-time All-Star team. In 1952, as the Negro 
League's decline was in rapid motion, the Pittsburgh Courier polled its 
readers to name the greatest players of the Negro leagues. They eventually 
named 5 teams plus honorable mentions. Among those honored, Taylor was 
awarded 2nd team, first base. He died at age 64 in Baltimore, Maryland.
