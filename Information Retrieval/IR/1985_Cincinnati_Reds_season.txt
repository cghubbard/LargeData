The Cincinnati Reds' 1985 season consisted of the Cincinnati Reds attempting 
to win the National League West. The Reds finished in second place, 5Â½ 
games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. This year, the Reds adopted an alternate 
uniform. Reds pitcher Tom Browning became the last 20th Century pitcher 
to win 20 games in his rookie year.[1] On September 11, 1985, Rose was 
thought to have broken Ty Cobb's all-time hits record with his 4,192nd 
hit, a single to left-center field off San Diego Padres pitcher Eric Show. 
A subsequent independent review of Cobb's hits, however, revealed that 
two of them were double-counted.[2][3] As a result, it has been suggested 
that Pete Rose actually broke the all-time hits record against the Cubs' 
Reggie Patterson with a single in the first in the Reds 5-5 called game 
against Chicago on September 8. Infielders Manager Coaches Note: Pos =
