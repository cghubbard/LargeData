San Diego County is a county located in the southwestern corner of the 
state of California, in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the population 
was 3,095,313.[5] making it the second-most populous county in California 
and the fifth-most populous in the United States. Its county seat is San 
Diego,[6] the eighth-most populous city in the United States. It is the 
south-westernmost county in the 48 contiguous United States. San Diego 
County comprises the San Diego-Carlsbad Metropolitan Statistical Area.[7] 
The San Diego-Carlsbad, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area as the 17th most 
populous metropolitan statistical area and the 18th most populous primary 
statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.[8][9] San Diego 
is also part of the San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan 
area shared between the United States and Mexico. Greater San Diego ranks 
as the 38th largest metropolitan area in the Americas. San Diego County 
has 70 miles (110 km) of coastline. Most of the county has a mild Mediterranean 
climate to semiarid climate, though there are mountains that receive frost 
and snow in the wintertime.[10] There are also 16 naval and military installations 
of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and the U.S. Coast Guard in San Diego 
County. These include the Naval Base San Diego, Marine Corps Base Camp 
Pendleton, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, and Naval Air Station North 
Island. From north to south, San Diego County extends from the southern 
borders of Orange County and Riverside County to the Mexico–United States 
border and Baja California. From west to east, San Diego County stretches 
from the Pacific Ocean to its boundary with Imperial County. The area which 
is now San Diego County has been inhabited for more than 10,000 years by 
Kumeyaay (also called Diegueño), Luiseño, Cupeño and Cahuilla Indians.[11] 
In 1542, the Portuguese-born explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, sailing 
for Spain, claimed San Diego Bay for the Spanish Empire, and he named the 
site San Miguel.[12] In November 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno surveyed the 
harbor and what are now Mission Bay and Point Loma and named the area for 
Saint Didacus, a Spaniard more commonly known as San Diego.[13] European 
settlement in what is now San Diego County began with the founding of the 
San Diego Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá by Spanish soldiers 
and clerics in 1769.[14] This county was part of Alta California under 
the Viceroyalty of New Spain until the Mexican declaration of independence. 
From 1821 through 1848 this area was part of Mexico. San Diego County became 
part of the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo 
in 1848, ending the U.S.-Mexican War. This treaty designated the new border 
as terminating at a point on the Pacific Ocean coast which would result 
in the border passing one Spanish league south of the southernmost portion 
of San Diego Bay, thus ensuring that the United States received all of 
this natural harbor. San Diego County was one of the original counties 
of California, and it was created at the time of California statehood in 
1850.[15]:221 At the time of its establishment in 1850, San Diego County 
was relatively large, and included all of southernmost California which 
was south and east of Los Angeles County. As such it included areas of 
what are now Inyo County and San Bernardino County, as well as all of what 
is now Riverside County and Imperial County.[15]:221 During the later part 
of the 19th century, there were numerous changes in the boundaries of San 
Diego County, when various areas became separated for the counties mentioned 
above. The most recent changes were the establishments of Riverside County 
in 1893[15]:207 and Imperial County in 1907.[15]:113 Imperial County was 
also the last county to be established in California, and after this division, 
San Diego no longer extended from the Pacific Ocean to the Colorado River, 
and it no longer covered the entire border between California and Mexico. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 4,526 
square miles (11,720 km2), of which 4,207 square miles (10,900 km2) is 
land and 319 square miles (830 km2) (7.0%) is water.[16] The county is 
larger in area than the combined states of Rhode Island and Delaware.[17] 
San Diego County has a varied topography. On its western side is 70 miles 
(110 km) of coastline.[18] Most of San Diego between the coast and the 
Laguna Mountains consists of hills, mesas, and small canyons. Snow-capped 
(in winter) mountains rise to the northeast, with the Sonoran Desert to 
the far east. Cleveland National Forest is spread across the central portion 
of the county, while the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park occupies most of 
the northeast. Although the western third of the county is primarily urban, 
the mountains and deserts in the eastern two-thirds of the county consist 
primarily of undeveloped backcountry. Most of these backcountry areas are 
home to a native plant community known as chaparral. San Diego County contains 
more than a million acres (4,000 km²) of chaparral, twice as much as any 
other California county.[19] North San Diego County is known as North County; 
the exact geographic definitions of "North County" vary, but it includes 
the northern suburbs and sometimes certain northern neighborhoods of the 
City of San Diego. The eastern suburbs are collectively known as East County, 
though most still lie in the western third of the county. The southern 
suburbs and southern detached portion of the city of San Diego, extending 
to the Mexican border, are collectively referred to as South Bay. Periodically 
the area has been subject to wildfires that force thousands to evacuate. 
The most recent are the May 2014 San Diego County wildfires; before them 
was the Witch Creek Fire in 2007 and the Cedar Fire in 2003. California 
defines a fire season in which fires are most likely to occur, usually 
between the months of late July and late October (which are the driest 
months of the area). Signs are posted in numerous spots of the county providing 
information on the level of threats from fires based on weather conditions.[citation 
needed] Under the Köppen climate classification system, the San Diego area 
straddles areas of Mediterranean climate (CSa) to the north and semi-arid 
climate (BSh) to the south and east.[20] As a result, it is often described 
as "arid Mediterranean" and "semi-arid steppe". San Diego's climate is 
characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual 
precipitation falling between November and March. The city has mild, mostly 
dry weather, with an average of 201 days above 70 °F (21 °C) and low rainfall 
(9–13 inches (23–33 cm) annually). Summer temperatures are generally warm, 
with average highs of 70–78 °F (21–26 °C) and lows of 55–66 °F (13–19 °C). 
Temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) only four days a year. Most rainfall 
occurs from November to April. Winter temperatures are mild, with average 
high temperatures of 66–70 °F (19–21 °C) and lows of 50–56 °F (10–13 °C). 
The climate in the San Diego area, like much of California, often varies 
significantly over short geographical distances resulting in microclimates. 
In San Diego's case this is mainly due to the city's topography (the Bay, 
and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly 
during the "May gray/June gloom" period, a thick marine layer will keep 
the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast, but will yield to 
bright cloudless sunshine approximately 5–10 miles (8.0–16.1 km) inland. 
This happens every year in May and June.[21] Even in the absence of June 
gloom, inland areas tend to experience much more significant temperature 
variations than coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a moderating influence. 
Thus, for example, downtown San Diego averages January lows of 50 °F (10 °C) 
and August highs of 78 °F (26 °C). The city of El Cajon, just 10 miles 
(16 km) northeast of downtown San Diego, averages January lows of 42 °F 
(6 °C) and August highs of 88 °F (31 °C).[22][23] Rainfall along the coast 
averages about 10 inches (25 cm) of precipitation annually, which occurs 
mainly during the cooler months of December through April. Though there 
are few wet days per month during the rainy period, rainfall can be heavy 
when it does occur. However, the rainfall is greater in the higher elevations 
of San Diego. Some of the higher areas of San Diego can receive 11–13 inches 
(28–33 cm) of rain a year. There are 7 official wilderness areas in San 
Diego County that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. 
Four of these are integral parts of Cleveland National Forest, whereas 
three are managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Some of these extend 
into neighboring counties (as indicated below): There are 236 mountain 
summits and peaks in San Diego County[33] including: Half of the county's 
population lives in San Diego and Chula Vista. In 2000, only about 3% of 
San Diego County residents left the county for work while 40,000 people 
commuted into the metropolitan area.[34] The 2010 United States Census 
reported that San Diego County had a population of 3,095,313. The racial 
makeup of San Diego County was 1,981,442 (64.0%) White, 158,213 (5.1%) 
African American, 26,340 (0.9%) Native American, 336,091 (10.9%) Asian 
(4.7% Filipino, 1.6% Chinese, 1.4% Vietnamese, 3.2% Other Asian), 15,337 
(0.5%) Pacific Islander, 419,465 (13.6%) from other races, and 158,425 
(5.0%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 991,348 
persons (32.0%).[45] As of 2009, the racial makeup of the county was 79.4% 
White American, 5.6% Black or African American, 1% Native American, 10.4% 
Asian, 0.5% Pacific Islander, 10.3% from other races, and 3.6% from two 
or more races. 31.3% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 
67.0% spoke only English at home; 21.9% spoke Spanish, 3.1% Tagalog and 
1.2% Vietnamese. As of 2009 Census Bureau estimates, there were 3,053,793 
people, 1,067,846 households, and 663,449 families residing in the county. 
The population density was 670 people per square mile (259/km²). There 
were 1,142,245 housing units at an average density of 248 per square mile 
(96/km²). In 2000 there were 994,677 households out of which 33.9% had 
children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.7% were married couples 
living together, 11.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 33.3% were non-families. 24.2% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.73 and the average family size was 3.29. As 
of 2000, in the county the population was spread out with 25.7% under the 
age of 18, 11.30% from 18 to 24, 32.0% from 25 to 44, 19.8% from 45 to 
64, and 11.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 
years. For every 100 females there were 101.2 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 99.7 males. According to the 2000 Census, the 
median income for a household in the county was $47,067, and the median 
income for a family was $53,438. Males had a median income of $36,952 versus 
$30,356 for females. The per capita income for the county was $22,926. 
About 8.9% of families and 12.4% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 16.5% of those under age 18 and 6.8% of those age 65 or 
over. Much of the county's high-income residents are concentrated in the 
northern part of the city of San Diego. The San Diego metropolitan area 
has two places with a both a population of over 50,000 per capita income 
of over $40,000: Carlsbad and Encinitas. The county's largest continuous 
high-income urban area is a triangle from a first point on the northern 
edge of Carlsbad, a second point southeast of Escondido, and a third point 
on the southern edge of La Jolla. It contains all or most of the cities 
of Carlsbad, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Del Mar, and Poway in addition to 
a substantial portion of northern San Diego.[46] The Government of San 
Diego County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution, 
California law, and the Charter of the County of San Diego.[47] Much of 
the Government of California is in practice the responsibility of county 
governments such as the Government of San Diego County. The County government 
provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, 
law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, 
public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the 
local government for all unincorporated areas.[48] Some chartered cities 
such as San Diego and Chula Vista provide municipal services such as police, 
public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, and zoning. Other cities 
such as Del Mar and Vista arrange to have the County provide some or all 
of these services on a contract basis. The county government is composed 
of the elected five-member Board of Supervisors, several other elected 
offices and officers including the Sheriff, the District Attorney, Assessor/Recorder/County 
Clerk, and Treasurer/Tax Collector, and numerous county departments and 
entities under the supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer such 
as the Probation Department. In addition, several entities of the government 
of California have jurisdiction conterminous with San Diego County, such 
as the San Diego Superior Court. Under its foundational Charter, the five-member 
elected San Diego County Board of Supervisors is the county legislature. 
The board operates in a legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial capacity. 
As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated 
areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant 
ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, 
it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial 
body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process. 
As of January 2013 the members of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors 
are: For several decades, ending in 2013, all five supervisors were Republican, 
white, graduates of San Diego State University, and had been in office 
since 1995 or earlier. The Board was criticized for this homogeneity, which 
was made possible because supervisors draw their own district lines and 
are not subject to term limits.[49] (In 2010 voters put term limits in 
place, but they only apply going forward, so that each incumbent supervisor 
can serve an additional two terms before being termed out.[50]) That pattern 
was broken in 2013 when Slater-Price retired; she was replaced by Democrat 
Dave Roberts, who won election to the seat in November 2012 and was inaugurated 
in January 2013.[51] The San Diego County Code is the codified law of San 
Diego County in the form of ordinances passed by the Board of Supervisors. 
The Administrative Code establishing the powers and duties of all officers 
and the procedures and rules of operation of all departments. The county 
motto is "The noblest motive is the public good." County government offices 
are housed in the historic County Administration Center Building, constructed 
in 1935-1938 with funding from the Works Progress Administration.[52] As 
of June 2013, there are 1,556,739 registered voters in San Diego County. 
Of those, 547,897 (35.2%) are registered Democratic, 526,306 (33.8%) are 
registered Republican, 401,340 (25.8%) declined to state a political party, 
51,993 (3.3%) are registered American Independence Party, 11,657 (0.7%) 
are registered Libertarian, 7,675 (0.5%) are registered Green, and 4,012 
(0.3%) are registered Peace & Freedom.[54] San Diego County has historically 
been a Republican stronghold. The Republican presidential nominee carried 
the county in every presidential election from 1948 through 2004, except 
in 1992 when Bill Clinton won a plurality. In 2008, Barack Obama became 
the first Democratic presidential candidate to win a majority of votes 
in San Diego County since World War II; he won a majority of county votes 
again in 2012. The city of San Diego itself is more Democratic than the 
county's average and has voted for Democrats in each presidential election 
since 1992. Various cities within the county are swing areas that have 
split their votes in elections since 2000. One unique feature of the political 
scene is the use of Golden Hall, a convention facility next to San Diego's 
City Hall, as "Election Central." The County Registrar of Voters rents 
the hall to distribute election results. Supporters and political observers 
gather to watch the results come in; supporters of the various candidates 
parade around the hall, carrying signs and chanting; candidates give their 
victory and concession speeches and host parties for campaign volunteers 
and donors at the site; and television stations broadcast live from the 
floor of the convention center.[55] The atmosphere at Election Central 
on the evening of election day has been compared to the voting portion 
of a political party national convention.[56] On Nov 4, 2008 San Diego 
County voted 53.8% for Proposition 8 which amended the California Constitution 
to ban same-sex marriages, thus restoring Proposition 22 which was overturned 
by a ruling from the California Supreme Court. However the city of San 
Diego, along with Del Mar, Encinitas, and Solana Beach, voted against Proposition 
8.[57] In the U.S. House of Representatives, San Diego County is split 
between five congressional districts:[58] In the California State Assembly, 
San Diego County is split between seven legislative districts:[59] In the 
California State Senate, San Diego County is split between four legislative 
districts:[60] The following table includes the number of incidents reported 
and the rate per 1,000 persons for each type of offense. Arising from an 
effort by the state government to identify regional economies, San Diego 
County and Imperial County are part of the Southern Border Region, one 
of nine such regions. As a regional economy, the Southern Border Region 
is the smallest but most economically diverse region in the state. However, 
the two counties maintain weak relations and have little in common aside 
from their common border.[63] San Diego County's agriculture industry was 
worth $1.85 billion in 2013,[64] and is one of the top five egg producing 
counties in the United States.[65] In 2013, San Diego County also had the 
most small farms of any county in the United States, and had the 19th largest 
agricultural economy of any county in the United States.[66] According 
to the San Diego Farm Bureau, San Diego County is the United States leading 
producer of avocados, and nursery crops.[67] Tourism plays a large part 
in the economics of the San Diego metropolitan area. Tourists are drawn 
to the region for a well rounded experience, everything from shopping to 
surfing as well as its mild climate. Its numerous tourist destinations 
include Horton Plaza, Westfield UTC, Seaport Village, Westfield Mission 
Valley and Fashion Valley Mall for shopping. SeaWorld San Diego and Legoland 
California as amusement parks. Golf courses such as Torrey Pines Golf Course 
and Balboa Park Golf Course. Museums such as the San Diego Museum of Man, 
San Diego Museum of Art, Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, San Diego Natural 
History Museum, USS Midway Museum, and the San Diego Air and Space Museum. 
Historical places such as the Gaslamp Quarter, Balboa Park and Old Town 
San Diego State Historic Park. Wildlife refuges, zoos, and aquariums such 
as the Birch Aquarium at Scripps, San Diego Zoo's Safari Park, San Diego 
Zoo and San Diego-La Jolla Underwater Park. Outdoor destinations include 
the Peninsular Ranges for hiking, biking, mountainboarding and trail riding. 
Surfing locations include Swami's, Stone Steps Beach, Torrey Pines State 
Beach, Cardiff State Beach, San Onofre State Beach and the southern portion 
of Black's Beach. The region is host to the second largest cruise ship 
industry in California which generates an estimated $2 million annually 
from purchases of food, fuel, supplies, and maintenance services.[68] In 
2008 the Port of San Diego hosted 252 ship calls and more than 800,000 
passengers.[69] San Diego County contains three public state universities: 
University of California, San Diego; San Diego State University; and California 
State University, San Marcos. Major private universities in the county 
include University of San Diego (USD), Point Loma Nazarene University (PLNU), 
Alliant International University (AIU), and National University. Within 
the county there are 24 public elementary school districts, 6 high school 
districts, and 12 unified school districts. There are also 5 community 
college districts.[70] There are two separate public library systems in 
San Diego County: the San Diego Public Library serving the city of San 
Diego, and the San Diego County Library serving all other areas of the 
county. In 2010 the county library had 33 branches and two bookmobiles; 
circulated over 10.7 million books, CDs, DVDs, and other material formats; 
recorded 5.7 million visits to library branches; and hosted 21,132 free 
programs and events. The San Diego County Library is one of the 25 busiest 
libraries in the nation as measured by materials circulated.[71][72] San 
Diego is the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Eleventh Naval District and 
is the Navy's principal location for West Coast and Pacific Ocean operations.[73] 
Naval Base San Diego, California is principal home to the Pacific Fleet 
(although the headquarters is located in Pearl Harbor). NAS North Island 
is located on the north side of Coronado, and is home to Headquarters for 
Naval Air Forces and Naval Air Force Pacific, the bulk of the Pacific Fleet's 
helicopter squadrons, and part of the West Coast aircraft carrier fleet. 
The Naval Special Warfare Center is the primary training center for SEALs, 
and is also located on Coronado. The area contains five major naval bases 
and the U.S. Marines base Camp Pendleton. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton 
is the major West Coast base of the United States Marine Corps and serves 
as its prime amphibious training base.[74] It is located on the Southern 
California coast, bordered by Oceanside to the south, San Clemente to the 
north, and Fallbrook to the east. The culture of San Diego is influenced 
heavily by American and Mexican cultures due to its position as a border 
town, its large Hispanic population, and its history as part of Spanish 
America and Mexico. The area's longtime association with the U.S. military 
also contributes to its culture. Present-day culture includes many historical 
and tourist attractions, a thriving musical and theatrical scene, numerous 
notable special events, a varied cuisine, and a reputation as one of America's 
premier centers of craft brewing. The most popular sports teams in the 
San Diego metropolitan area are the two major professional sports teams 
— the NFL's Chargers and MLB's Padres — and the college sports teams of 
the San Diego State Aztecs. The following table shows all sports teams 
in the San Diego metropolitan area that average over 8,000 fans per game: 
San Diego County is served by many newspapers. The major regional paper 
is The San Diego Union-Tribune, also known as U-T San Diego, is ranked 
23rd in the country (by daily circulation) as of March 2013.[75] The Union-Tribune 
serves both San Diego County and neighboring Imperial County. The former 
North County Times, based in Escondido and serving portions of Riverside 
County and North County, was purchased by the Union-Tribune in 2012 and 
closed down. For about a year after absorbing the North County Times the 
Union-Tribune published a North County edition,[76] but the regional edition 
was later abandoned.[77] The Los Angeles Times is also delivered in portions 
of the county. Many of the area's cities, towns and neighborhoods have 
their own local newspapers; the Union Tribune bought eight local weeklies 
in 2013 and is continuing to publish them as independent local newspapers.[77] 
The San Diego Daily Transcript reports business and legal news. Privately 
published papers like the Military Press Newspaper and the Navy Dispatch 
serve the military community both on and off base. County Television Network 
is a public-access television cable channel, offering a "hometown blend 
of C-SPAN, the Lifetime, History, Travel, and Discovery channels" for the 
county, and funded by fees paid by cable companies.[78] San Diego County 
has 18 federally recognized Indian reservations, more than any other county 
in the United States.[79] Although they are typical in size to other Indian 
reservations in California (many of which are termed "Rancherías"), they 
are relatively tiny by national standards,[citation needed] and all together 
total 200.2 square miles (518.5 km²) of area. The population ranking of 
the following table is based on the 2010 census of San Diego County.[80]
