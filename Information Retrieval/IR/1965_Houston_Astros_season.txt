The 1965 Houston Astros season was the franchise's first season in the 
Houston Astrodome, as well as its first season as the Astros after three 
seasons known as the Colt .45s. It involved the Houston Astros finishing 
in ninth place in the National League with a record of 65–97, 32 games 
behind the eventual World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Astros 
were managed by Lum Harris. On December 1, The Houston club changed its 
nickname from Colt .45s to Astros. The move resulted from objections by 
the Colt Firearms Company to the club's sales of novelties bearing the 
old nickname.[citation needed] Despite the trademark issues, the "Astros" 
nickname matched the futuristic ambiance of the revolutionary domed stadium. 
The nickname was also appropriate since Houston was, by then, the home 
of NASA's astronaut program. The scoreboard retained subliminal references 
to the old nickname, as it featured electronically animated cowboys firing 
pistols, with the "bullets" ricocheting around the scoreboard, when an 
Astros player would hit a home run. Early on, the groundskeepers also wore 
astronaut spacesuits to promote that futuristic image. On April 9, the 
former Houston Colt .45s took the field and officially became the Houston 
Astros. They inaugurated indoor baseball in the Astrodome with a 2–1 exhibition 
win over the New York Yankees. The stadium was designed as a defense against 
the oppressive heat and humidity of the Houston summer. Loosely based on 
the old Roman Colosseum, the Astrodome was dubbed the Eighth Wonder of 
the World. As with many stadiums of that era, such as RFK Stadium and Shea 
Stadium, the Astrodome was a multi-purpose stadium, designed for both football 
as well as baseball. Besides its roof, the Astrodome was revolutionary 
for a number of other reasons. It was one of the first stadiums to have 
individual, theatre-type seats for every seat in the venue. Additionally, 
it was one of the first stadiums to have luxury seats and club seating, 
at the time a relatively new concept in sports venues. It also had an "exploding 
scoreboard", which would show various animations after a home run or a 
win, as well as messages and advertising. Rookie Joe Morgan set club marks 
for at-bats, runs, hits and triples. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note:
