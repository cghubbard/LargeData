The 1951 Philadelphia Phillies finished in fifth place. The team had won 
the 1950 National League pennant but in the United Press' annual preseason 
poll of sportswriters, only 18 out of 168 writers picked the team to repeat 
as pennant winners; the Giants received 81 votes and the Dodgers 55.[1] 
Those two teams wound up tied, with the Phillies 23 games behind. [1] [2] 
[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The 1951 All-Star Game was originally awarded to 
the Philadelphia Phillies. The City of Detroit was celebrating the 250th 
anniversary of its founding in 1701 and requested to host the year's All-Star 
Game. Although the National League was scheduled to host the game in '51, 
the game was moved to Detroit's Briggs Stadium to coincide with the city's 
celebration. The Phillies instead hosted the 1952 All-Star Game at Shibe 
Park.[4] Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
