Alexander "Alick" Joy Cartwright Jr. (April 17, 1820 – July 12, 1892) is 
referred to as a "father of baseball". The rules of the modern game were 
thought to be based on the Knickerbocker Rules developed by Cartwright 
and a committee from his club, the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club, in 1845, 
although this is disputed.[1] With the myth of Abner Doubleday inventing 
baseball debunked, Cartwright was inducted into the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame as a pioneering contributor 46 years after his death.[2][3] Although 
it has been stated in secondary sources that Cartwright was officially 
declared the inventor of the modern game of baseball by the 83rd United 
States Congress on June 3, 1953,[2][4][5][6] the Congressional Record, 
the House Journal, and the Senate Journal from June 3, 1953 did not mention 
Cartwright.[7] Cartwright was born in 1820 to Alexander Cartwright, Sr. 
(1784-1855), a merchant sea captain, and Esther Rebecca Burlock Cartwright 
(1792-1871). Alexander Jr. had six siblings. He first worked at the age 
of 16 in 1836 as a clerk for a Wall Street broker, later doing clerical 
work at the Union Bank of New York. After hours, he played bat-and-ball 
games in the streets of Manhattan with volunteer firefighters. Cartwright 
himself was a volunteer, first with Oceana Hose Company No. 36, and then 
Knickerbocker Engine Company No. 12.[8] Cartwright's ancestor Edward Cartwright 
immigrated from Devonshire, England to New England around 1661.[9][10] 
Cartwright married Eliza Van Wie, from Albany, on June 2, 1842.[8] A fire 
destroyed the Union Bank in 1845, forcing Cartwright to find other work. 
He became a bookseller with his brother, Alfred.[8] Cartwright led the 
establishment of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club (after the Knickerbocker 
Fire Engine Company) in 1842. The Knickerbockers played a brand of bat-and-ball 
game often called "town ball" or "round ball," but in New York more usually 
"base ball," somewhat similar to but not identical to the English sport 
of rounders, on a field at 4th Avenue and 27th Streets. In 1845, Cartwright 
and a committee from his club drew up rules converting this playground 
game into a more elaborate and interesting sport to be played by adults. 
The major precepts included the stipulations that foul territories were 
to be introduced for the first time, and the practice of retiring a runner 
by hitting him with a thrown ball was forbidden.[12] Cartwright is also 
erroneously credited for introducing flat bases at uniform distances, three 
strikes per batter, and nine players in the outfield.[13] However, modern 
scholarship has cast doubt on the originality of these rules, as information 
has come to light about the New York clubs that predated the Knickerbockers, 
in particular the rules devised by William R. Wheaton for the Gotham Club 
in 1837. Baseball historian Jeffrey Kittel has concluded that none of the 
Knickerbocker Rules of 1845 was original, with the possible exception of 
three-out innings.[14] As MLB's Official Historian John Thorn wrote, Cartwright 
has "a plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame on which every word of substance 
is false. Alex Cartwright did not set the base paths at ninety feet, the 
sides at nine men, or the game at nine innings." [15] The first clearly 
documented match between two baseball clubs under these rules took place 
on June 19, 1846, at Elysian Fields in Hoboken, New Jersey. In this match, 
the Knickerbockers lost to the "New York Nine" by a score of 23 to 1.[16] 
Some authors have also questioned the supposed "first game" under the new 
rules. The Knickerbockers' scorebook shows intra-club games during 1845; 
the New York Base Ball Club played at least three games against a Brooklyn 
club in 1845 also, but the rules used are unknown. Those who have studied 
the score-book have concluded that the differences in the games of 1845 
and 1846, compared with the specifications of the Knickerbocker rules, 
are minimal.[citation needed] In 1849, Cartwright headed to California 
for the gold rush, and then continued on to work and live in the Kingdom 
of Hawaii. His family came to join him in 1851: wife Eliza Van Wie, son 
DeWitt (1843–1870), daughter Mary (1845–1869), and daughter Catherine (Kate) 
Lee (1849–1851). In Hawaii, sons Bruce Cartwright (1853–1919) and Alexander 
Joy Cartwright III (1855–1921) were born. Some secondary sources claim 
Cartwright set up a baseball field on the island of Oahu at Makiki Field 
in 1852, but Nucciarone states that before 1866, the modern game of baseball 
was not known or even played in Honolulu.[17] Also, she states that during 
Cartwright's lifetime he was not declared or documented as an originator 
of baseball in Hawaii.[17] Cartwright served as fire chief of Honolulu 
from 1850 through June 30, 1863.[18] He was an advisor to King David Kalākaua 
and Queen Emma. Cartwright died on July 12, 1892, six months before the 
overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. One of the leaders of the overthrow 
movement was Lorrin A. Thurston who played baseball with classmate Alexander 
Cartwright III at Punahou School. He was buried in Oahu Cemetery.[16] After 
about two decades of controversy, invention of America's "national game" 
of baseball was attributed to Abner Doubleday by the Mills Commission (1905–1907). 
Some baseball historians promptly cried foul and others joined throughout 
the 20th century.[citation needed] Cartwright was inducted into the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1938. New York City librarian Robert W. Henderson documented 
Cartwright's contributions to baseball in his 1947 book Bat, Ball, and 
Bishop.[19] Although there is no question that Cartwright was a prominent 
figure in the early development of baseball, some students of baseball 
history have suggested that Henderson and others embellished Cartwright's 
role. The primary complaint is that touting Cartwright as the "true" inventor 
of the modern game was an effort to find an alternative single individual 
to counter the "invention" of baseball by Abner Doubleday.[15] Cartwright 
was the subject of a 1973 biography, The Man Who Invented Baseball, by 
Harold Peterson.[20] He was the subject of two biographies written in 2009. 
Jay Martin's Live All You Can: Alexander Joy Cartwright & the Invention 
of Modern Baseball supports Cartwright as the inventor of baseball, while 
Alexander Cartwright: The Life Behind the Baseball Legend by Monica Nucciarone 
credits Cartwright as one of the game's pioneers but not its sole founder.[21][22] 
The 2004 discovery of a newspaper interview with fellow Knickerbocker founder 
William R. Wheaton cast doubt on Cartwright's role. Wheaton stated that 
most of the rules long attributed to Cartwright and the Knickerbockers 
had in fact been developed by the older Gotham Club before the Knickerbockers' 
founding.[15] In 1938, Makiki Field in Honolulu was renamed Cartwright 
Field.[23] The Cartwright Cup is awarded to the Hawaii state high school 
baseball champions each year.[24] In 2016, experts verified the authenticity 
of a set of documents titled "Laws of Base Ball" written in 1857 by New 
York Knickerbockers president Daniel "Doc" Adams after a discussion with 
executives of 14 other New York-area clubs. The documents established the 
rules of the game, including nine innings, nine players on the field and 
90-foot basepaths. Cartwright was not a participant at the 1857 meeting,
