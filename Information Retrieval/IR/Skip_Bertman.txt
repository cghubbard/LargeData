J. Stanley "Skip" Bertman (born May 23, 1938) is a former college baseball 
coach and athletic director at Louisiana State University (LSU). He led 
the LSU Tigers baseball team to College World Series Championships in 1991, 
1993, 1996, 1997, and 2000. Bertman spent his collegiate playing days as 
an outfielder and catcher at the University of Miami, in Coral Gables, 
Florida, from 1958–1960. While a player at UM, Bertman earned his B.A. 
in health and physical education. He later received his master's degree 
from UM in 1964. In 11 seasons as head baseball coach at Miami Beach High 
School, Bertman's team won a State Championship and was State runner-up 
twice. Bertman was named Florida High School Coach of the Year three times. 
Based in part on these coaching credentials, Bertman went on to work as 
associate head coach at the University of Miami for eight seasons (1976–1983) 
under Ron Fraser. During this time, the Hurricanes won the national championship 
in 1982. Bertman was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall 
of Fame in 1994. Bertman began coaching at LSU in 1984 and would transform 
LSU into a baseball power house, guiding the Tigers to 16 NCAA Tournament 
appearances, 11 College World Series appearances, 7 SEC Championships and 
5 NCAA Baseball National Championships in his 18 seasons as the LSU Head 
Coach. His teams also drew large crowds to LSU's Alex Box Stadium, as the 
Tigers led the nation in collegiate baseball attendance in each of his 
final six seasons (1996–2001). He also served as head coach of the 1996 
U.S. Olympic team, which captured the bronze medal in Atlanta. In 2001, 
the section of South Stadium Drive between River Road and Nicholson Drive-site 
of the original Alex Box Stadium- was renamed Skip Bertman Drive. Bertman's 
No. 15 jersey was also retired at LSU. Bertman has been inducted, in June 
2002, into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the 
American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in January 2003, and 
was a member of the inaugural class of the College Baseball Hall of Fame 
on July 4, 2006. On May 17, 2013, during a pre-game ceremony that also 
celebrated the 20th anniversary of Bertman's 1993 National Championship 
team, the field at Alex Box Stadium was officially dedicated "Skip Bertman 
Field." It will now be known as Alex Box Stadium, Skip Bertman Field. In 
a Baseball America poll published in 1999, Bertman was voted the second 
greatest college baseball coach of the 20th century, trailing Rod Dedeaux 
of Southern California. In six years as LSU's director of athletics, Bertman 
added to his impressive list of on-the-field achievements. Under his direction, 
LSU enjoyed arguably the greatest athletics year in the history of the 
institution in 2003–04. Three teams won national championships, nine teams 
finished in the nation's top ten, and fourteen teams ranked in the top 
25. LSU teams also enjoyed improved grade point averages across all sports, 
making the LSU student-athlete experience a success on and off the fields 
of competition. Bertman oversaw a massive upgrade to LSU's athletics complex 
throughout his tenure. Working hand in hand with the Tiger Athletic Foundation, 
Bertman has already helped oversee the completion of the Cox Communications 
Academic Center for Student-Athletes while launching renovations to Tiger 
Stadium and the Pete Maravich Assembly Center, the construction of a new 
Football Operations Center and in 2009, the opening of new stadiums for 
the baseball and softball teams. Construction is in progress on new practice 
facilities for the basketball and gymnastics teams. Bertman also moved 
to implement a seat contribution program in Tiger Stadium to fund facility 
improvements and ensure the financial stability of the LSU Athletics Department 
for the next decade. Bertman was named LSU's athletics director on January 
19, 2001, responsible for an athletic budget of $52 million. He succeeded 
Joe Dean, a former Tiger basketball standout who held the position for 
14 years. On June 4, 2006, Bertman fired his successor as LSU's baseball 
coach, Raymond "Smoke" Laval, after the Tigers went 35–24 overall and 13–17 
in the SEC, failing to reach the NCAA tournament for the first time since 
1988. Laval led the Tigers to the College World Series in 2003 and 2004, 
but tailed off in his final two seasons, losing the 2005 regional championship 
game at home to Rice before the disastrous 2006 campaign. Bertman speculated 
that he would consider a return to the dugout if he could not find a suitable 
candidate to replace Laval, but the job was eventually given to former 
Notre Dame coach Paul Mainieri. Mainieri would lead the Tigers to the 2009 
College World Series championship, the sixth baseball national championship 
in school history and the first not won with Bertman as head coach. Bertman 
presided over two football national championship seasons as athletic director. 
The Tigers won the 2003 BCS championship under coach Nick Saban. When Saban 
left at the end of the 2004 season to coach the Miami Dolphins of the National 
Football League, Bertman moved quickly to hire Oklahoma State coach Les 
Miles. Miles led LSU to a consensus national championship in 2007 despite 
losing triple overtime games to Kentucky and Arkansas. Other success in 
Bertman's tenure included five consecutive trips to the NCAA women's basketball 
Final Four (2004–08) under four different coaches, an appearance in the 
men's basketball Final Four in 2006, a trip to the Women's College World 
Series in softbal in 2004, and six NCAA outdoor track championships (three 
men, three women). The LSU Board of Supervisors approved Bertman's three-year 
contract extension. Bertman's new extension, which was approved without 
discussion, called for the former coach to be paid $425,000 annually beginning 
July 1, 2007, and ending June 30, 2010. Bertman, who served as Athletic 
Director since leaving his coaching position after the 2001 baseball season, 
stepped down in 2008 to become athletic director emeritus as dictated by 
his contract. As athletic director emeritus, Bertman's role primarily involved 
fundraising.[1] Bertman led Team USA to a bronze medal in the 1996 Summer 
Olympic Games. The team finished the Olympic Games with a 6–1 record on 
a victory over Nicaragua. National Collegiate Baseball Championships: 2000,
