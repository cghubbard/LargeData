The wild card was established for Major League Baseball's playoffs in 1994 
with the intention of helping the best teams that did not win their division 
to still have a chance to win the World Series. The restructuring of both 
the American and National Leagues from two divisions each to three made 
it necessary to either give one team a bye in the first round of playoffs, 
or create the wild card for the best second-place team. In addition, the 
wild card guaranteed that the team with the second best record in each 
league would qualify for the playoffs, even if they were in the same division 
with the team having the best record. Beginning in 2012 a second wild card 
team was added to each league. The two wild card teams in each league face 
each other in a one-game playoff, the winner advancing to meet the number 
one seed in the Division Series. As of October 2016, the AL East has produced 
18 of 26 wild-card teams; the AL West is second with five teams, while 
the AL Central has qualified three wild-card teams. As of 2015, two AL 
wild-card teams went on to win the World Series (Anaheim in 2002 and Boston 
in 2004), two teams won the AL pennant but lost the World Series (Detroit 
in 2006 and Kansas City in 2014), and six other teams won the division 
series but lost the championship series. ** In 2013, the Texas Rangers 
and the Tampa Bay Rays finished the season with the identical records of 
91–71. A one-game playoff was held and the Rays won it 5–2 over the Rangers
