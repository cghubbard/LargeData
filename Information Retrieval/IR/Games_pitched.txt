In baseball statistics, games pitched (denoted by GP, or GamesG in tables 
of only pitching statistics) is the number of games in which a player appears 
as a pitcher; a player who is announced as the pitcher must face at least 
one batter, although exceptions are made if the pitcher announced in the 
starting lineup is injured before facing a batter, perhaps while batting 
or running the bases in the top of the first inning, before the opposing 
team comes to bat. The statistic is also referred to as appearances, usually 
to refer to the number of games a relief pitcher has pitched in. Listed 
are all Major League Baseball players with at least 1000 games pitched. 
LaTroy Hawkins is the most recent player to reach the 1,000 games mark.
