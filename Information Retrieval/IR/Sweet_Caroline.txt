"Sweet Caroline" is a song written and performed by American recording 
artist Neil Diamond and officially released on September 16, 1969,[1][2] 
as a single with the title "Sweet Caroline (Good Times Never Seemed So 
Good)". It was arranged by Charles Calello,[3] and recorded at American 
Sound Studio in Memphis, Tennessee. The song reached #4 on the Billboard 
chart and eventually went platinum for sales of one million singles.[4] 
In the autumn of 1969, Diamond performed "Sweet Caroline" on several television 
shows. It later reached #8 on the UK singles chart in 1971. In a 2007 interview, 
Diamond stated the inspiration for his song was John F. Kennedy's daughter, 
Caroline, who was eleven years old at the time it was released.[5][6] Diamond 
sang the song to her at her 50th birthday celebration in 2007.[7] On December 
21, 2011, in an interview on CBS's The Early Show, Diamond said that a 
magazine cover photo of Caroline Kennedy as a young child on a horse with 
her parents[8] in the background created an image in his mind, and the 
rest of the song came together about five years after seeing the picture.[9] 
The song has proven to be enduringly popular, and as of November 2014 has 
sold over two million digital downloads in the United States.[10] There 
are three distinct mixes of this song. The original mono 45 mix had a louder 
orchestra and glockenspiel compared to the stereo version on the Brother 
Love's Travelling Salvation Show LP. The third version was a remix found 
only on the initial CD release of Diamond's His 12 Greatest Hits.[11] This 
version has the orchestra mixed down and has the background vocals mixed 
up. It has a longer fade as well. A live version of the song is on his 
Hot August Night LP. "Sweet Caroline" has been played at Fenway Park, home 
of Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox, since at least 1997,[12] and 
in the middle of the eighth inning at every game since 2002.[13] On opening 
night of the 2010 season at Fenway Park, the song was performed by Diamond 
himself. "Sweet Caroline" was played at Penn State Nittany Lions football 
games at Beaver Stadium until August 2012, halting after the Penn State 
child sex abuse scandal.[14][15] Performances at Beaver Stadium resumed 
in September 2013, however.[16] On April 16, 2013, the day after the Boston 
Marathon bombing, the New York Yankees—longtime Red Sox rivals—announced 
they would play the song during their home game, preceded by a moment of 
silence, as a tribute to the victims.[17] On Saturday, April 20, 2013, 
during the 8th inning of the Red Sox-Kansas City game in Fenway Park, Neil 
Diamond led the crowd in a rendition of the song. The song was sung at 
sporting events across the country after the Boston Marathon bombings, 
in efforts to show solidarity with those affected by the tragedy. It was 
also played right before the start of the Hamburg Marathon in Hamburg, 
Germany, on Sunday, April 21, 2013, subsequent to a minute of silence.[18] 
The song was also played before the start of the Stockholm Marathon in 
Stockholm, Sweden, on Saturday, June 1, 2013, as a tribute to those affected 
by the Boston Marathon bombings. On April 25, 2013, "Sweet Caroline" was 
played following a tribute to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing 
during the NFL Draft. Diamond has announced that he will donate all royalties 
from sales of the song since the marathon bombings to the One Fund Boston 
charity to help the people most affected by the bombings.[19] Diamond said 
that sales of the song surged nearly 600 percent in the week after the 
bombings, to 19,000 copies, up from 2,800 the week before.[20] The University 
of Pittsburgh also has a tradition of singing the song at their home football 
games, started in 2008.[21] Pitt students have made it "Pitt-centric", 
by shouting "Let's Go Pitt" during the distinctive 3 horn notes after the 
words "Sweet Caroline" and then "I've been inclined" in the song's chorus, 
and also cheering "Go Pitt" 3-4 times immediately after the words "(good 
times never seemed) so good" in the chorus. In the 2015 NFL season it became 
the theme song for the Carolina Panthers. Rugby league team Castleford
