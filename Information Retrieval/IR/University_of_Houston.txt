The University of Houston (UH) is a state research university and the flagship 
institution of the University of Houston System.[6] Founded in 1927, UH 
is the third-largest university in Texas with nearly 43,000 students.[4] 
Its campus spans 667 acres in southeast Houston, and was known as University 
of Houston–University Park from 1983 to 1991.[7][8] The Carnegie Foundation 
classifies UH as a doctoral degree-granting institution with "highest research 
activity."[9][10][11] The U.S. News & World Report ranks the university 
No. 194 in its National University Rankings, and No. 103 among top public 
universities.[12][13] UH is one of four public universities in Texas with 
a Phi Beta Kappa chapter.[14][15] The university offers more than 280 degree 
programs through its 14 academic colleges on campus—including programs 
leading to professional degrees in law, optometry, and pharmacy.[16][17][18][19] 
The institution conducts $150 million annually in research, and operates 
more than 40 research centers and institutes on campus.[20][21] Interdisciplinary 
research includes superconductivity, space commercialization and exploration, 
biomedical sciences and engineering, energy and natural resources, and 
artificial intelligence. Awarding more than 9,000 degrees annually, UH's 
alumni base exceeds 260,000.[4][22] The economic impact of the university 
contributes over $3 billion annually to the Texas economy, while generating 
about 24,000 jobs.[23] The University of Houston hosts a variety of theatrical 
performances, concerts, lectures, and events. It has more than 400 student 
organizations and 17 intercollegiate sports teams.[24] Annual UH events 
and traditions include The Cat's Back, Homecoming, and Frontier Fiesta. 
The university's varsity athletic teams, known as the Houston Cougars, 
are members of the American Athletic Conference and compete in the NCAA 
Division I in all sports. The football team regularly makes bowl game appearances, 
and the men's basketball team has made 19 appearances in the NCAA Division I 
Tournament—including five Final Four appearances. The men's golf team has 
won 16 national championships—the most in NCAA history. The University 
of Houston began as Houston Junior College (HJC). On March 7, 1927, trustees 
of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) Board of Education unanimously 
passed a resolution that authorized the founding and operating of a junior 
college. The junior college was operated and administered by HISD.[25][26] 
Originally HJC was located in San Jacinto High School and offered only 
night courses.[27] Its first session began March 7, 1927, with an enrollment 
of 232 students and 12 faculty.[25] This session was primarily held to 
educate the future teachers of the junior college, freshmen were not permitted 
to enroll. A more accurate date for the official opening of HJC is September 
19, 1927, when enrollment was opened to all persons having completed the 
necessary educational requirements.[28] The first president of HJC was 
Edison Ellsworth Oberholtzer, who was the dominant force in establishing 
the junior college.[25][29] The junior college became eligible to become 
a university in October 1933 when Governor of Texas, Miriam A. Ferguson, 
signed House Bill 194 into law. On April 30, 1934, HISD's Board of Education 
adopted a resolution to make the school a four-year institution, and Houston 
Junior College changed its name to the University of Houston.[28] UH's 
first session as a four-year institution began June 4, 1934, at San Jacinto 
High School with an enrollment of 682. In 1934, the first campus of the 
University of Houston was established at the Second Baptist Church at Milam 
and McGowen. The next fall, the campus was moved to the South Main Baptist 
Church on Main Street—between Richmond Avenue and Eagle Street—where it 
stayed for the next five years.[28] In May 1935, the institution as a university 
held its first commencement at Miller Outdoor Theatre.[30] In 1936, heirs 
of philanthropists J. J. Settegast and Ben Taub donated 110 acres (0.45 km2) 
to the university for use as a permanent location.[31] At this time, there 
was no road that led to the land tract, but in 1937, the city added Saint 
Bernard Street, which was later renamed to Cullen Boulevard.[30] It would 
become a major thoroughfare of the campus. As a project of the National 
Youth Administration, workers were paid fifty cents an hour to clear the 
land. In 1938, Hugh Roy Cullen donated $335,000 (equivalent to $5,641,146.57 
in 2015) for the first building to be built at the location. The Roy Gustav 
Cullen Memorial Building was dedicated on June 4, 1939, and classes began 
the next day. The first full semester of classes began officially on Wednesday, 
September 20, 1939.[28] In a year after opening the new campus, the university 
had about 2,500 students. As World War II approached, enrollment decreased 
due to the draft and enlistments. The university proposed to be in a new, 
highly unusual training activity of the United States Navy, and was one 
of six institutions selected to give the Primary School in the Electronics 
Training Program.[32] By the fall of 1943, there were only about 1,100 
regular students at UH; thus, the 300 or so servicemen contributed in sustaining 
the faculty and facilities of the Engineering College. This training at 
UH continued until March 1945, with a total of 4,178 students.[33] On March 
12, 1945, Senate Bill 207 was signed into law, removing the control of 
the University of Houston from HISD and placing it into the hands of a 
board of regents.[28] In 1945, the university—which had grown too large 
and complex for the Houston school board to administer—became a private 
university. In March 1947, the regents authorized creation of a law school 
at the university. In 1949, the M.D. Anderson Foundation made a $1.5 million 
gift to UH for the construction of a dedicated library building on the 
campus. By 1950, the educational plant at UH consisted of 12 permanent 
buildings. Enrollment was more than 14,000 with a full-time faculty of 
more than 300.[25] KUHF, the university radio station, signed on in November. 
By 1951, UH was the second-largest university in the State of Texas and 
was the fastest growing university in the United States and is now looking 
to be recognized as a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) 
with having a full yard restored on campus in Spring 2016 .[34] In 1953, 
the university established KUHT—the first educational television station 
in the nation—after the four-year-long Federal Communications Commission's 
television licensing freeze ended.[25] During this period, however, the 
university as a private institution was facing financial troubles. Tuition 
failed to cover rising costs, and in turn, tuition increases caused a drop 
in enrollment. After a lengthy battle between supporters of the University 
of Houston, led by school president A.D. Bruce,[35] and forces from state 
universities geared to block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on May 
23, 1961, enabling the university to enter the state system in 1963.[25] 
As the University of Houston celebrated its 50th anniversary, the Texas 
Legislature formally established the University of Houston System in 1977. 
Philip G. Hoffman resigned from his position as president of UH and became 
the first chancellor of the University of Houston System. The University 
of Houston became the oldest and largest member institution in the UH System 
with nearly 30,000 students. On April 26, 1983, the university appended 
its official name to University of Houston–University Park; however, the 
name was changed back to University of Houston on August 26, 1991.[7][8] 
This name change was an effort by the UH System to give its flagship institution 
a distinctive name that would eliminate confusion with the University of 
Houston–Downtown (UHD), which is a separate and distinct degree-granting 
institution that is not part of the University of Houston.[7] In 1997, 
the administrations of the UH System and the University of Houston were 
combined under a single chief executive officer, with the dual title of 
Chancellor of the UH System and President of the University of Houston. 
Arthur K. Smith became the first person to have held the combined position. 
As of 1997, the University of Houston System Administration has been located 
on campus in the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building. On October 15, 2007, Renu 
Khator was selected for the position of UH System chancellor and UH president.[36] 
On November 5, 2007, Khator was confirmed as the third person to hold the 
dual title of UH System chancellor and UH president concurrently, and took 
office in January 2008.[37] In January 2011, the University of Houston 
was classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 
as a research university with very high research activity.[9][10][11] The 
campus of the University of Houston is located in southeast Houston, with 
an official address of 4800 Calhoun Road. It was known as University of 
Houston–University Park from 1983 to 1991.[7][8] The campus spans 667-acre 
(2.70 km2) and is roughly bisected by Cullen Boulevard—a thoroughfare that 
has become synonymous with the university. The university campus includes 
numerous green spaces, fountains, and sculptures, including a work by famed 
sculptor Jim Sanborn. Renowned architects César Pelli and Philip Johnson 
have designed buildings on the UH campus.[38] Recent campus beautification 
projects have garnered awards from the Keep Houston Beautiful group for 
improvements made to the Cullen Boulevard corridor.[39] The University 
of Houston (UH) is the flagship institution of the University of Houston 
System (UHS). It is a multi-campus university with a branch campus located 
in Sugar Land. The University of Houston–Clear Lake (UHCL), the University 
of Houston–Downtown (UHD), and the University of Houston–Victoria (UHV) 
are separate universities; they are not branch campuses of UH. The University 
of Houston's campus framework has identified the following five core areas 
and districts: inner campus, the Arts District, the Professional District, 
the Wheeler District, and the Stadium District. In addition, the campus 
contains several outlying areas not identified among the four districts. 
The inner campus contains the academic core of the university and consists 
of the M.D. Anderson Library, the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, 
the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics including the Physics Department, 
the College of Technology, and the Honors College. The interior of the 
campus has the original buildings: the Roy G. Cullen Building, the Old 
Science Building, and the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building. Academic and research 
facilities include the Cullen Performance Hall, the Science and Engineering 
Research and Classroom Complex, and Texas Center for Superconductivity, 
and various other science and liberal arts buildings. This area of campus 
features the reflecting pool at Cullen Family Plaza, the Lynn Eusan Park, 
and various plazas and green spaces. The Arts District is located in the 
northern part of campus and is home to the university's School of Art, 
the Moores School of Music, the School of Theatre and Dance, the Gerald 
D. Hines College of Architecture, and the Valenti School of Communication. 
The district also has the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Performing 
Arts which houses the Lyndall Finley Wortham Theatre, the main stage of 
the School of Theatre and Dance, and Moores Opera Center. Other facilities 
include the Dudley Recital Hall and the Organ Recital Hall in the Fine 
Arts Building, the Quintero Lab Theatre in the School of Theatre and Dance, 
and the Moores Opera House and Choral Recital Hall in the Moores School 
of Music Building. The Professional District is located northeast and east 
of the university campus. The district has facilities of the University 
of Houston Law Center, the Cullen College of Engineering, and the C.T. 
Bauer College of Business. This area of campus is home to Calhoun Lofts, 
which is an upper-level and graduate housing facility. The East Parking 
Garage is located on the east end of the district. Adjacent to the district 
is the University Center (UC), the larger of two student unions on campus. 
The Wheeler District is located in the southern portion of the campus, 
along Wheeler Avenue and east of Cullen Boulevard. This area has undergraduate 
dormitories, the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management, 
and the College of Optometry. Dormitory facilities include the twin 18-story 
Moody Towers, Cougar Village, and the Quadrangle which has the following 
five separate halls: Oberholtzer, Bates, Taub, Settegast, and Law. Adjacent 
to the Moody Towers and Lynn Eusan Park is the Hilton University of Houston 
Hotel. The university's Energy Research Park is a research park specializing 
in energy research, consisting of 74 acres and 19 acres of undeveloped 
land.[40] Much of the physical property was originally developed in 1953 
by the oilfield services company Schlumberger as its global headquarters. 
It was acquired by the university in 2009.[41] The University of Houston 
Libraries is the library system of the university. It consists of the M.D. 
Anderson Library and three branch libraries: the Music Library, the Weston 
A. Pettey Optometry Library, and the William R. Jenkins Architecture and 
Art Library. In addition to the libraries administered by the UH Libraries, 
the university also has the O'Quinn Law Library and the Conrad N. Hilton 
Library. The campus has the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Performing 
Arts, which houses the Lyndall Finley Wortham Theatre and Moores Opera 
Center. The Cullen Performance Hall is a 1,544 seat proscenium theater 
which offers a variety of events sponsored by departments and organizations 
at the university in addition to contemporary music concerts, opera, modern 
dance, and theatrical performances put on by groups in and outside the 
Houston area. The Blaffer Gallery exhibits the works of both visiting artists 
and those of students in the university's School of Art. The 264,000 ft² 
(25,000 m²) Campus Recreation and Wellness Center, which is home to the 
nation's largest collegiate natatorium, was recognized by the National 
Intramural-Sports Association as an outstanding facility upon its completion 
in 2004.[42][43] The LeRoy and Lucile Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting 
houses the studios and offices of KUHT Houston PBS, the nation's first 
public television station;[44] KUHF (88.7 FM), Houston's NPR station; the 
Center for Public Policy Polling; and television studio labs. The 200,000 sq ft 
(19,000 m2) Science and Engineering Research and Classroom Complex (SERCC) 
was designed by architect César Pelli.[45] It houses facilities for many 
interdisciplinary research programs at UH, including bionanotechnology. 
The university has an on-campus Hilton hotel that is part of the Conrad 
N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management. This hotel was established 
with a donation by the founder of Hilton Hotels, Conrad N. Hilton, and 
is staffed by students in the College of Hotel and Restaurant Management. 
The University of Houston operates a branch campus in Sugar Land. The campus 
was founded in 1995 as a higher education "teaching center" of the University 
of Houston System. It was originally named the "Fort Bend Institute" and 
later the "University of Houston System at Fort Bend" prior to its name 
as the "University of Houston System at Sugar Land." In 2002, the campus 
was moved to its current 250-acre area on University Boulevard at U.S. 
Highway 59 with the opening of the Albert and Mamie George Building. On 
April 23, 2009, a $37 million USD facility was opened on the campus dubbed 
"Brazos Hall" housing the Sugar Land campus of Wharton County Junior College. 
Originally approved in May 2006, the Fort Bend County Libraries system 
opened their University Branch at the UHSL campus on November 10, 2011. 
The library serves as a joint-use facility between both the public and 
university students. On November 16, 2011, the University of Houston System 
announced that the University of Houston as an institution would replace 
the university system as the administrative entity for the teaching center, 
effectively making it a branch campus of the university. The University 
of Houston (UH) is one of four separate and distinct institutions in the 
University of Houston System, and was known as University of Houston–University 
Park from 1983 to 1991.[7][8] The University of Houston (UH) is the flagship 
institution of the University of Houston System (UHS). It is a multi-campus 
university with a branch campus located in Sugar Land. The University of 
Houston–Clear Lake (UHCL), the University of Houston–Downtown (UHD), and 
the University of Houston–Victoria (UHV) are stand-alone universities; 
they are not branch campuses of UH. The organization and control of the 
University of Houston is vested in the Board of Regents of the University 
of Houston System. The board has all the rights, powers, and duties that 
it has with respect to the organization and control of other institutions 
in the System; however, UH is maintained as a separate and distinct institution. 
The president is the chief executive officer (CEO) of the University of 
Houston, and serves concurrently as chancellor of the University of Houston System. 
The chancellor is the CEO of the UH System, and the position is appointed 
by its board of regents. As of January 2008, Renu Khator has been president 
of the University of Houston and chancellor of the UH System. The administrations 
of the University of Houston and the UH System are located on the university 
campus in the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building. The Chancellor/President resides 
in the Wortham House, provided by the Board of Regents of the University 
of Houston System as part of the chancellor/president's employment contract.[46] 
The mission of the University of Houston is to "discover and disseminate 
knowledge through the education of a diverse population of traditional 
and nontraditional students, and through research, artistic and scholarly 
endeavors, as it becomes the nation's premier public university in an urban 
setting."[47] The university offers 282 degree programs: 111 bachelors; 
121 masters; 47 research doctorates; and three professional doctorate degrees 
in law, optometry, and pharmacy.[16][17][18][19] Awarding more than 9,000 
degrees annually, UH's alumni base exceeds 260,000 and is the largest in 
the Houston area.[4][22] UH is one of four public universities in Texas 
with a Phi Beta Kappa chapter.[14][15] The University of Houston's faculty 
includes three-time Pulitzer Prize winner Edward Albee, National Medal 
of Science recipient Paul Chu from the Physics Department, and Nobel Peace 
Prize Laureate Jody Williams. The College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences 
has the Creative Writing Program, which was founded by alumnus Donald Barthelme 
and offers degrees in poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. The Gerald D. Hines 
College of Architecture is one of only 36 schools to have an accreditation 
from the National Architectural Accrediting Board.[48] The University of 
Houston's academic colleges are as follows: In August 2016, the Texas Higher 
Education Coordinating Board approved the creation of the Hobby School 
of Public Affairs.[49] The school, named in honor of former Texas Lt. Gov. 
Bill Hobby, builds on the existing educational and research programs of 
the Center for Public Policy, which was founded at UH in 1981. The designation 
officially moves the Master of Public Policy Degree from the UH College 
of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences to the Hobby School of Public Affairs 
and approves the addition of a Master of Public Policy degree as a dual 
degree with the Graduate College of Social Work’s Master of Social Work. 
The University of Houston was ranked the 31st top college in the United 
States by Payscale and CollegeNet's Social Mobility Index college rankings.[58] 
The U.S. News & World Report ranks the university No. 194 in its National 
University Rankings, and No. 103 among top public universities.[12][13] 
The Princeton Review has listed UH as one of America's best colleges.[59] 
The institution ranks in the Top 50 American Research Universities, and 
is among the Top 300 in the global Academic Ranking of World Universities.[60][54] 
The University of Houston Law Center was ranked 58th among the nation's 
"Best Law Schools" in U.S. News & World Report in 2012.[61] U.S. News & 
World Report ranked the C.T. Bauer College of Business as the top Undergraduate 
Business Program in Houston, third among public universities in the state 
of Texas, and 43rd in the nation among public universities. In 2002, the 
Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management ranked third 
in the nation in hospitality management by the Journal of Hospitality & 
Tourism Education.[62] The Wolff Center for Entrepreneurship at the C.T. 
Bauer College of Business is the No. 1 ranked undergraduate program for 
Entrepreneurship in the nation. The program has been ranked by The Princeton 
Review and Entrepreneur magazine as No. 1 for 2008, 2010, and 2011; and 
No. 2 in 2007 and 2009. The Carnegie Foundation classifies the University 
of Houston as a doctoral degree-granting institution with "highest research 
activity."[9][10][11] The designation makes UH one of only six public universities 
in Texas with that classification.[9][10][63] The university conducts $150 million 
annually in academic and scientific research, and operates more than 40 
research centers and institutes on campus.[20][21][64] Through these facilities, 
UH maintains partnerships with government, health care and private industry.[65] 
Areas of interdisciplinary research include nanotechnology, superconductivity, 
space commercialization and exploration, biomedical sciences and engineering, 
energy and natural resources, and artificial intelligence.[66][67][68][69] 
Six interdisciplinary research clusters enable scholars to exchange ideas 
and explore research areas and to work with industry, other research organizations, 
and the community. University of Houston research clusters include: Arts 
and Human Enrichment, Bio-Med Sciences and Engineering, Community Advancement 
and Education, Complex Systems/Space Exploration, Energy and Natural Resources, 
and Nano-Materials.[70] The University of Houston is notable for its diverse 
student body, and U.S. News & World Report ranks UH as the second-most 
ethnically diverse research university in the United States.[71] With 42,704 
students in the fall 2015 semester, the university has significant numbers 
of Asian American and Hispanic students. Its international student population 
is primarily from Asia.[4] Located in the Fine Arts Building, Blaffer Art 
Museum is a contemporary art museum dedicated to emerging, mid-career, 
and underrepresented artists and bodies of work through exhibitions, publications, 
and public programs. Its educational programs include public lectures, 
artists' talks, docent tours, audio guides, and youth programs such as 
Studio Saturday, Summer Arts, and the Young Artist Apprenticeship Program. 
The Cullen Performance Hall is a 1,544 seat proscenium theater located 
near Entrance 1. The hall offers a variety of events sponsored by departments 
and organizations at the university in addition to contemporary music concerts, 
opera, modern dance, and theatrical performances put on by groups in and 
outside the Houston area. The Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music 
presents concerts in various campus venues: Dudley Recital Hall and the 
Organ Recital Hall in the Fine Arts Building, and in the Moores Opera House 
and Choral Recital Hall in the music building. Musical events range from 
opera to jazz with performers including students, faculty, and guest artists. 
The School of Theatre and Dance offers a subscription series of five plays 
each year. Works by classical and modern dramatists, as well as new musical 
collaborators, are seen in full productions or "gypsy runthroughs." The 
School of Art exhibits young artists several times a year, including the 
Master of Fine Arts exhibition held traditionally near the end of the spring 
semester in the Blaffer Art Museum. The School of Art also hosts presentations 
by numerous visiting artists and art historians throughout the academic 
year. Fifteen percent of UH students live on campus.[72] UH has several 
on campus dormitories: Moody Towers, The Quadrangle, Cougar Village I & II, 
Cougar Place, Calhoun Lofts, Bayou Oaks, Cullen Oaks, and Cambridge Oaks. 
Moody Towers, frequently just called "The Towers," is one of the tallest 
complexes on campus and the largest area of residence halls. Each of the 
two towers consists of eighteen stories and together house 1,100 students. 
The Towers feature a newly renovated dining hall. The rooms in The Towers 
are scheduled to be renovated during the summer of 2011. The Quadrangle, 
also known as "The Quad," is the oldest housing area on campus and consists 
of several coed dorm halls: Bates, Law, Oberholtzer, Settegast, and Taub. 
Oberholtzer Hall features a smaller, albeit cozy dining hall. The Quadrangle 
houses 800 students. The rooms in The Quads are scheduled to be renovated 
during the summer of 2011.[73] In August 2009, Calhoun Lofts—a new university-owned 
and operated residential facility aimed at graduate and professional students—opened 
and includes retail stores, lecture halls, and recreation facilities. Cougar 
Village I & II are new freshman/Honors College dorm which opened in August 
2010 and August 2013, respectively. The dormitory features themed floors 
with kitchens and lounges, a tutoring center, computer labs, multi-purpose 
rooms, study areas, a convenience store, a laundry facility, and a fitness 
center. Cougar Village I & II are exclusive only to freshman and Honor 
College students.[74] In addition to traditional dormitories, Cougar Place 
was an apartment-style housing complex consisting of 400 units. Cougar Place 
has since been demolished as of 2013[update] and has been replaced with 
a new on-campus housing complex for sophomores.[73] The university has 
privately owned apartment complexes on campus: Cullen Oaks, Bayou Oaks, 
and Cambridge Oaks. The official student newspaper is The Cougar, formally 
The Daily Cougar, and has been published since 1927.[28] Students also 
produce the Houstonian magazine, which acts as a yearbook; "Cooglife," 
a monthly lifestyle magazine; and "Transitions," a magazine for freshmen 
and transfer students. The UH Student Video Network, a student-run network, 
appears on the University of Houston cable network. COOG Radio, the University 
of Houston's student-run college radio station, made its debut on August 
29, 2011.[75] The seal of the University of Houston, officially adopted 
in 1938, is a stylized version of the coat-of-arms of General Sam Houston. 
The first official version was placed on the floor of the Roy Gustav Cullen 
Building.[76] The official colors of the University of Houston are scarlet 
red and albino white. These were the colors of Sam Houston's ancestor, 
Sir Hugh, and were adopted by UH at the same time as the official seal. 
Scarlet red symbolizes courage or inner strength to face the unknown, and 
white symbolizes the goodness and purity of spirit embodied in helping 
one's fellow man.[77] Cougar Red Friday is part of the ongoing Keep Houston 
Red initiative at the University of Houston. Students and staff are encouraged 
to wear red shirts on Friday to show pride and passion for the university.[78] 
The school's official mascot is a cougar, which was adopted in 1947 and 
later named Shasta.[79] The university owned a series of female cougars, 
but this tradition ceased in 1989, upon the death of Shasta V. When a cougar 
cub was orphaned in Washington State and moved to the Houston Zoo in 2011, 
the university adopted it as its first live male cougar mascot.[80] The 
Frontiersmen - initially exclusive to members of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, 
but later opened membership to the entire student body - is a group of 
students who participate in university events to drive school spirit. At 
football games, the Frontiersmen—donning cowboy hats, Wrangler Jeans, and 
dusters for attire—run across the field with the university's flag and 
the Flag of Texas after each score. Frontier Fiesta—a re-creation of a 
19th-century Western town, with music, food and historical exhibits—is 
a major event on campus each spring semester. The student-led festival 
is a part of a long-standing tradition dating back to the 1940s established 
by Gan Bey which later became the Sigma Chi Fraternity's Epsilon Xi chapter 
at UH.[81] Frontier Fiesta attained widespread notoriety when the Sigma 
Chi variety show performance known as "Bella Union" garnered national attention 
on the cover of Life (magazine) as "The Greatest College Show on Earth" 
and soon-after drew crowds numbered in the tens of thousands from all across 
the country to participate in the festivities. As Frontier Fiesta grew 
it eventually evolved into what we know today as the Houston Livestock 
Show and Rodeo. Although, there is still an annual "Frontier Fiesta" held 
on UH's campus - the Houston Rodeo is today's closest resemblance to the 
original Frontier Fiesta. The BLAZE is an oil field warning siren that 
was chosen to represent the university's ties to the petroleum industry. 
The purchase of the siren was completed in 1991. The Sigma Chi Fraternity 
has been in charge of the siren and gave it the name "The BLAZE" in honor 
of its fallen brother, David Blazek. Cougar First Impressions—a program 
headed by the UH Staff Council—takes place every year on the first two 
days of classes, when faculty and staff turn out to welcome new and returning 
students.[82] The Cougar Paw is a popular hand sign used by University 
of Houston students, faculty, alumni, and athletics fans to represent camaraderie 
and support. The Cougar Paw tradition was adopted through several athletics 
events between the University of Houston and the University of Texas. The 
University of Houston and the University of Texas played their first football 
game against one another in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members 
of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge of taking care of Shasta I, 
the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's 
front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, 
several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players 
by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars 
were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been 
using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using 
the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts.
