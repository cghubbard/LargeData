The Braves are a Major League Baseball team that was originally based in 
Boston. They moved to Milwaukee in 1953 before moving to their current 
home, Atlanta in 1966. They played in the National League since its formation 
in 1876. At various points in the history in Boston, they were known as 
the Beaneaters, the Doves, the Rustlers and the Bees. During the 20th century 
until their move to Milwaukee, they played their home games primarily at 
two home ball parks – South End Grounds until 1914, and Braves Field from 
1915 through 1952. They also played some home games at Fenway Park in 1914 
and 1915, including Opening Day of 1915. Their home ball park in Milwaukee 
was County Stadium. The first game of the new baseball season for a team 
is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an 
honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching 
staff that season,[1] though there are various strategic reasons why a 
team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day.[2] The Braves used 
40 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 80 National League 
seasons they played prior to moving to Atlanta. The Braves won 46 of those 
games against 42 losses in those Opening Day starts. They also played two 
tie games.[3] Warren Spahn had the most Opening Day starts for the Boston 
and Milwaukee Braves with ten between 1952 and 1964. Kid Nichols made six 
Opening Day starts between 1893 and 1901. Jim Whitney (1881–1885) and John 
Clarkson (1888–1892) each had five Opening Day starts. Tommy Bond (1877–1880), 
Vic Willis (1900–1904), Dick Rudolph (1915–1917, 1919), Al Javery (1942–1945) 
and Johnny Sain (1946–1949) each made four Opening Day starts. Irv Young 
(1906–1908), Bob Smith (1927–1929) and Ed Brandt (1932, 1934, 1935) each 
had three such starts. Other pitchers with multiple Opening Day starts 
for the Boston and Milwaukee Braves were Charles Radbourn, Jack Stivetts, 
Hub Perdue, Joe Oeschger, Joe Genewich, Danny MacFayden and Lew Burdette. 
Prior to moving to Atlanta, the Braves played in the World Series four 
times. The played in the World Series as the Boston Braves in 1914 and 
1948, and as the Milwaukee Braves in 1957 and 1959.[4] They won the World 
Series in 1914 and 1957.[4] Their Opening Day starting pitchers in World 
Series years were Lefty Tyler in 1914, Sain in 1948, and Spahn in 1957 
and 1958.[5][6][7][8] They lost their Opening Day game in 1914, 1948 and 
1958, and won in 1957.[5][6][7][8] In addition, the franchise won the National 
League championship eight times during the 19th century, prior to the existence 
of the modern World Series.[9] Nichols was the team's Opening Day starting 
pitcher in three of those season, Clarkson and Bond in two of those seasons 
each, and Whitney was the Opening Day starting pitcher in one such season. 
Jesse Barnes made an Opening Day start for the Braves against the New York 
Giants in 1925, after having made an Opening Day start for the Giants against 
the Braves in 1920.[10][11] Spahn is the only pitcher to make an Opening 
Day start for both the Boston Braves and the Milwaukee Braves. Tony Cloninger, 
who made the last Opening Day start for the Milwaukee Braves in 1965 and 
the first for the Atlanta Braves in 1966, is the only pitcher to make an
