Byron Ellis Browne (born December 27, 1942) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. He played with the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, St. Louis 
Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies between 1965 and 1972. Browne was signed 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent on September 9, 1962 
then was drafted by the Cubs from the Pirates in the 1963 first-year draft. 
In his first Major League Baseball at-bat on September 9, 1965, Browne 
lined out in the second inning of Sandy Koufax's perfect game. He played 
in parts of three seasons with the Cubs, hitting .236 with 16 home runs 
in 134 games. He also led the league in strikeouts in 1966 with 143. Browne 
was traded by the Cubs to the Astros on May 4, 1968 in return for Aaron 
Pointer but only played in 10 games with the Astros, totaling three hits 
in 19 at-bats. The Cardinals purchased him from the Astros on February 
12, 1969 where he appeared in 22 games while hitting .226 spending most 
of the season in AAA with the Tulsa Oilers. Browne, along with Curt Flood, 
Tim McCarver and Joe Hoerner, was traded to the Phillies for Richie Allen, 
Cookie Rojas, and Jerry Johnson on October 7, 1969. Challenging Major League 
Baseball's reserve clause, Flood's refused the trade and his subsequent 
lawsuit against Major League Baseball went all the way to the U.S. Supreme 
Court which in 1972 ruled against Flood. By 1975, however, arbitration 
effectively reversed the Court's verdict, voiding the clause, which led 
to today's free agency system among major league professional athletes. 
From 1970 to 1972, Browne was a member of several mediocre Philadelphia 
Phillies teams. Although a few teammates described Browne as having the 
best natural power on the team, he seldom delivered, particularly in the 
clutch. To some cynics, his chief contribution was the refreshing breeze 
on hot and humid South Philadelphia evenings which emanated from his regular 
swings and misses.[citation needed] In 183 games for the Phillies he hit 
.237. Browne's son Byron Browne, Jr. played 10 years in the Milwaukee Brewers
