The Brooklyn Tip-Tops were a team in the short-lived Federal League of 
professional baseball from 1914 to 1915. The team was named by owner Robert 
Ward, who owned the Tip Top Bakery. They were sometimes informally called 
the Brooklyn Feds or BrookFeds due to being the Brooklyn team of the Federal 
League. The Tip Tops played in old Washington Park, which the Brooklyn 
Dodgers had abandoned after the 1912 season to move to Ebbets Field. The 
team finished a disappointing 4th in 1914. Federal League officials believed 
it was important to have a successful franchise in the New York City area 
and when the Indianapolis Hoosiers were transitioned to Newark, New Jersey, 
the "Federal League Ty Cobb", as 1914 FL batting champ Benny Kauff was 
known, was placed on the Brooklyn roster. In 1915, Kauff led the league 
with a .342 batting average and 55 stolen bases, but the Tip-Tops still 
finished in seventh place. The Newark and Brooklyn FL teams played three 
holiday doubleheaders during the 1915 season where one game was in Newark 
and the second was in Brooklyn. On September 19, 1914, Tip-Top Ed Lafitte 
threw the only no-hitter in Federal League history, beating the Kansas 
City Packers 6-2. Had the Federal League (FL) lasted just one more season, 
night baseball might have been introduced two decades earlier. The Tip 
Tops had announced plans for the 1916 season to play some games at night.
