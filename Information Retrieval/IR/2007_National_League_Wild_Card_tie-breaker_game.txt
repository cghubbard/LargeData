The 2007 National League wild-card tie-breaker game was a one-game extension 
to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2007 regular season, played between the 
San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies of the National League's (NL) West 
Division to determine the NL wild card. It was played at Coors Field in 
Denver, Colorado, on October 1, 2007. The Rockies won the game 9–8 in thirteen 
innings on a controversial play at home plate. The game was necessary after 
both teams finished the season with identical win–loss records of 89–73. 
The Rockies won a coin flip late in the season, which awarded them home 
field for the game. Upon winning, the Rockies advanced to the NL Division 
Series where they swept the Philadelphia Phillies. After advancing, they 
swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL Championship Series, winning their 
first pennant in franchise history. However, the Rockies were, in turn, 
swept in the 2007 World Series by the Boston Red Sox, ending their season. 
In baseball statistics the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season 
game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season 
statistics. The 2007 season saw heavy competition between the Padres and 
the Arizona Diamondbacks for the National League West divisional title. 
The Padres spent 52 days with at least a share of the lead, while the Diamondbacks 
spent 89 total days atop the division and ultimately won by a game with 
a record of 90–72.[1][2] The Rockies spent just three days, last on April 
6, with a lead in the division.[3] Notably the Diamondbacks scored 20 fewer 
runs than their pitchers allowed,[2] one of just five teams in MLB history 
to make the playoffs despite being outscored during the season.[4] In addition 
to the divisional race, the competition over the wild card continued to 
the last day of the season. Six teams in the 2007 National League finished 
within five games of one another: the aforementioned Diamondbacks, Padres, 
and Rockies along with the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, and Chicago 
Cubs.[5] The Diamondbacks, Phillies, and Cubs won the Western, Eastern, 
and Central divisions respectively.[5] Meanwhile, the 2007 Mets underwent 
what was described in the New York Times as "one of the biggest collapses 
in baseball history", becoming the first team with a seven-game divisional 
lead with only 17 games remaining to finish outside of first place, losing 
the Eastern division to the Phillies on the final day of the season.[6][7] 
Also, at 88–74, the Mets finished a single game behind the Rockies and 
Padres' 89–73 record in the wild-card race.[8] While the Padres had been 
a consistent presence amongst the league's top teams during the 2007 season, 
the Rockies finished the first half with a .500 record of 44–44.[1][3] 
They propelled themselves into the wild-card race, however, by going 46–29 
in the second half of the season including a Rockies' season-best 11-game 
winning streak from September 16 through September 27 and ultimately tied 
the Padres regular season record.[1][3] With the Rockies and Padres holding 
the best non-division winning records in the league[5] a tie-breaker was 
necessary to determine the wild-card winner. A coin flip conducted earlier 
that September set the Rockies' home park of Coors Field as the location 
for the game.[9] Box score for Monday October 1, 2007—5:37 p.m. (MT) at 
Coors Field in Denver, Colorado The starting pitcher matchup saw eventual 
Cy Young Award and Major League Baseball Triple Crown winner Jake Peavy 
against the Rockies Josh Fogg, who teammate Matt Holliday nicknamed "Dragon 
Slayer" for his strong performances against ace starters throughout the 
season.[10][11] The Rockies opened the bottom of the first inning with 
a leadoff double by Kaz Matsui, followed by a Troy Tulowitzki single and 
a walk to Matt Holliday to load the bases. Matsui scored on a sacrifice 
fly by Todd Helton and Garrett Atkins made the game 2–0 with a single which 
scored Tulowitzki. Yorvit Torrealba later added to that lead, leading off 
the bottom of the second inning with a solo home run. The Padres took the 
lead in the top of the third, however, loading the bases via singles from 
Peavy and Scott Hairston and a walk to Brian Giles. Adrian Gonzalez then 
hit a grand slam home run, making the score 4–3. This was Gonzalez' first 
career grand slam.[12] Khalil Greene then singled, advanced to third base 
on a double by Josh Bard, and scored on a ground out by Brady Clark. Helton 
homered in the bottom of the inning to close the gap to 5–4 in favor of 
San Diego.[13] The score remained the same through the fifth inning. Fogg 
was relieved by Taylor Buchholz in the top of the fifth and, following 
a double by Tulowitzki, Peavy allowed the game-tying run to score on a 
Holliday single. Seth Smith, pinch hitting for the pitcher in the bottom 
of the sixth, hit a triple and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Matsui 
to give the Rockies a 6–5 lead. The Rockies' Garrett Atkins appeared to 
homer in the bottom of the seventh, extending the Rockies lead, but umpires 
ruled that the ball hit padding on the outfield wall, which was still in 
play, and awarded Atkins a double.[12][14] Jamey Carroll pinch ran for 
Atkins, but no runs scored in the inning. The Rockies brought in closer 
Brian Fuentes in the top of the 8th, but the Padres re-tied the game when 
Geoff Blum singled to lead off the inning, advanced to second base on a 
wild pitch, and scored on a double by Brian Giles. This was Fuentes' seventh 
blown save of the season.[13] The game remained tied through nine innings, 
forcing extra innings. There too the game stayed tied until the top of 
the 13th inning when Giles singled off of Jorge Julio and scored on a home 
run by Scott Hairston. Ramón Ortiz relieved Julio and no further runs scored 
in the inning, but the Padres entered the bottom of the 13th with an 8–6 
lead. The Padres brought in Trevor Hoffman to secure the game and a wild-card 
victory.[15] However, Hoffman blew the save, allowing doubles to Matsui 
and Tulowitzki and a triple to Holliday which tied the game 8–8. Hoffman 
then intentionally walked Todd Helton leaving baserunners at first and 
third base. Carroll then hit a line drive to right fielder Brian Giles. 
Holliday tagged up at third and slid headfirst on a close play at home 
plate. Home plate umpire Tim McClelland ruled Holliday safe on the sacrifice 
fly, and the Rockies won the game 9–8.[13] During the final play Padres 
catcher Michael Barrett attempted to block home plate from Holliday's slide 
while receiving the ball on a throw from Brian Giles.[16] Holliday arrived 
at the plate before the ball did and the ball bounced away from Barrett.[16] 
Some controversy arose after the game as to whether Holliday had actually 
touched home plate or if Barrett had successfully blocked him. Several 
sportswriters, such as Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports and Mark Kiszla of 
The Denver Post, said outright that Holliday never touched the plate.[17][18] 
Kiszla referred to the moment humorously, saying "When folks retell this 
story 100 years from now, he still will not have touched home plate."[18] 
Padres manager Bud Black and first base umpire Ed Montague both agreed 
with McClelland's safe call.[16] Barrett said he was unsure but "never, 
ever second-guessed Tim McClelland at home plate."[16] If McClelland had 
ruled Holliday had not touched the plate during his slide Barrett would 
have had the chance to tag out Holliday, preventing the winning run. Colorado's 
win clinched the team's second post-season berth in franchise history,[19] 
and the first for their first baseman Todd Helton.[14] The Rockies swept 
the Phillies in the 2007 National League Division Series and the Diamondbacks 
in the 2007 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to win the franchise's 
first National League pennant.[14][20] This streak, in combination with 
the Rockies performance at the end of the season, meant the Rockies had 
won 21 of their last 22 games.[21] The last National League team to win 
20 of 21 games at any point in the season were the 1936 New York Giants.[21] 
The Rockies also opened the playoffs with seven straight wins, the 1976 
Cincinnati Reds were the only other team in major league history to do 
so.[21] The Rockies moved on to the 2007 World Series with their NLCS win, 
where they were swept by the Boston Red Sox.[20] The game counted as a 
regular season game in baseball statistics.[22] If Matt Holliday had gone 
0 for 5 in the game he would have lost the batting title to Chipper Jones.[23] 
However, Holliday went 2 for 6 and won the title with a batting average 
of .340. Also, Holliday's triple and run batted in (RBI) in the 13th gave 
him 137 RBI in total, winning the RBI crown over Ryan Howard by 1.[23] 
Holliday's teammate Tulowitzki believed Holliday was the league's most 
valuable player,[24] but he ultimately finished a close second to the Phillies' 
Jimmy Rollins in the Most Valuable Player Award voting.[25] Also, Padres' 
starter Jake Peavy increased his earned run average (ERA) from 2.36 to 
2.54 in the game and added six strikeouts to his season total.[26] Peavy 
ultimately won the National League wins, strikeout, and ERA titles.[27][28] 
These titles combined to give Peavy a pitching Triple Crown and he went 
on to win the Cy Young Award unanimously.[29] Finally, despite an error 
in the game, the Rockies set the single-season major league record for 
team fielding percentage (.98925), breaking the 2006 Boston Red Sox mark
