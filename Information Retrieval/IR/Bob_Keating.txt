Robert M. Keating (September 22, 1862 – January 19, 1922), was a Major 
League Baseball pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles. He appeared in one game 
for the Orioles on August 27, 1887—pitching a complete game, allowing 16 
runs on 16 hits in the loss. An arm injury ended his career and he became 
an inventor, starting off by inventing various shaving devices. In 1897, 
he started the R.M. Keating Company which manufactured bicycles, through 
his Keating Wheel Works subsidiary. Keating had some success for a time 
with his bicycle business and may even have invented the first motorcycle, 
though the company apparently folded before any were released.[1] He also 
invented the rubber home plate, still in use today.[2] Media related to
