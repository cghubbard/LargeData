Jacob Cauthen "Jake" Westbrook (born September 29, 1977) is an American 
former professional baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball. He is known 
as a sinker ball pitcher and has also hit a grand slam home run.[1] During 
his career he played for the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and St. 
Louis Cardinals. He was selected to one All-Star game and won a World Series 
championship in 2011. Westbrook was born on September 29, 1977, in Athens, 
Georgia. His father, Cauthen, played baseball and basketball at the University 
of Georgia, where Jake signed a letter of intent (but never attended because 
he signed with the Colorado Rockies).[2] He has an older sister, Jill.[1] 
Westbrook attended Madison County High School. He tossed 5 no-hitters and 
one perfect game in his high school career. During his senior season, Westbrook 
was 9–1 with a 1.11 ERA and 110 strikeouts in 63 innings. On March 28, 
2008, Westbrook appeared at his high school alma-mater to speak and give 
thanks as they retired his high school #12 jersey during a home baseball 
game. Westbrook married his high school sweetheart, Heather Daniels, on 
December 12, 1998. The couple has two sons — Jacob Parker (born September 
27, 2005) and Keaton Daniels Westbrook (born November 15, 2007),[1] a daughter 
(born September 9, 2010), and a fourth child born October 2012. They reside 
in Danielsville, Georgia.[2] and also have a home in Germantown, Tennessee. 
Westbrook was a first round draft pick (21st overall) in the 1996 Major 
League first-year player draft by the Colorado Rockies. Following the draft, 
18-year-old Westbrook began his pro career with the Arizona Rockies, the 
Rookie league affiliate of the Rockies in the Arizona League. He pitched 
in 11 games in Mesa, before moving up to the Class A-Short Season Portland 
Rockies in the Northwest League. For the 1997 season, Westbrook was promoted 
to the Class A Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League. He went 
14–11 with a 4.29 ERA in 27 starts. On November 18, 1997, the day after 
the 1997 Major League Baseball expansion draft, the Rockies traded Westbrook 
along with fellow minor leaguers John Nicholson and Mark Hamlin to the 
Montreal Expos for infielder Mike Lansing. The Expos assigned Westbrook 
to the Jupiter Hammerheads, their Class A-Advanced affiliate in the Florida 
State League. In 1998, he went 11–6 for the Hammerheads with a 3.26 ERA 
in 27 starts. In 1999, he went 11–5 with a 3.92 ERA in 27 starts for the 
Harrisburg Senators, the Double-A club in the Eastern League. Following 
three consecutive 27 start seasons, Westbrook was traded in the off-season. 
On December 22, 1999, the Expos traded him with two players to be named 
later to the New York Yankees for Hideki Irabu. (Montreal Expos eventually 
sent Ted Lilly (March 17, 2000) and Christian Parker (March 22, 2000) to 
the Yankees to complete the trade.) [3] The Yankees assigned Westbrook 
to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers in the International League. He went 
5–7 with an 4.65 ERA in 15 starts. Westbrook made his spring debut and 
allowed 3 runs in 3 innings, still Joe Torre was pleased with what he had 
seen from the 22-year-old Westbrook.[4] In his major league debut on June 
17, 2000, and his first start at Yankee Stadium for the Yankees against 
the Chicago White Sox, he did not make it past the second inning.[1] He 
appeared in three games for the Yankees as a rookie, two starts and once 
out of the bullpen, going 0–2 with a 13.50 ERA. On June 29, 2000, the Yankees 
traded Westbrook with fellow sinker ball pitcher Zach Day and outfielder 
Ricky Ledée to the Cleveland Indians for outfielder/designated hitter David 
Justice in their quest to eventually win the 2000 World Series. However, 
Westbrook cracked a rib at some point while he was pitching, so his 2000 
season was cut short.[1] In 2001, the Indians invited him to spring training. 
He shuttled back and forth between Cleveland and Triple-A Buffalo Bisons 
in the International League. He did well in Buffalo, amassing an 8–1 record 
in 12 starts. But he struggled with his role, going a lackluster 4–4 in 
Cleveland out of the bullpen and in six spot starts. In 2002, Westbrook 
caught a break. He became a regular part of the Cleveland pitching staff 
that was in transition, as the Tribe went 74–88, finishing 3rd in American 
League Central Division and getting coach Charlie Manuel sacked midway 
through the season (76 games). He also signed a three-year contract with 
the team.[1] For the 2003 season, Westbrook converted back to starter, 
going 7–10 with a 4.33 ERA, ending the year as the team's fourth starter. 
After beginning the season in the Indians bullpen, Westbrook earned a spot 
in the Indians rotation in late May.[5] Westbrook was named to the All-Star 
team in 2004, when he won 14 games with a 3.38 ERA. After becoming a full-time 
starter in 2004, the sinkerballer won at least 14 games in three consecutive 
seasons. In 2006, he induced more double plays (35) than any other pitcher 
in the majors. In April 2007, Westbrook signed a three-year, $33 million 
contract extension with the Indians, which was intended to keep him in 
Cleveland through the 2010 season. After being placed on the 15-day DL 
in April 2008, Westbrook came back to pitch his first game for the Indians 
on May 28. After the start, Westbrook began to feel soreness in his elbow, 
but was optimistic that he would be able to make his next start. On June 
7, 2008, the Tribe announced that he would be undergoing Tommy John surgery 
and be out of action for 10–14 months, ending his 2008 season. Westbrook 
also spent the entire 2009 season on the 60-day DL, still recovering from 
the surgery.[6] He pitched in 4 games of winter ball in Puerto Rico during 
the end of the 2009 season, testing his surgically repaired elbow before 
the 2010 season.[7] He returned to action as the Indians' 2010 Opening 
Day starter. Through 21 starts, he was 6-7 with 1 complete game. On July 
31, 2010, Westbrook was part of a three-team trade involving the Indians, 
St. Louis Cardinals, and San Diego Padres. He went to the Cardinals along 
with Class A left-hand pitcher Nick Greenwood and cash, while the Tribe 
received Double-A right-handed pitcher Corey Kluber from San Diego. The 
Padres got outfielder Ryan Ludwick. Westbrook, who had nearly $4 million 
remaining in his 2010 salary and another $2 million bonus because of the 
trade, agreed to forgo part of the bonus to make the deal happen. He was 
6–7 with a 4.65 ERA in 21 starts with the Indians prior to the trade.[8][9] 
Between Cleveland and St. Louis, Westbrook finished 10–11 with a 4.22 ERA 
in 33 starts. He went 4–4 with St.Louis following the trade. On November 
16, 2010, Westbrook and the St. Louis Cardinals agreed to a two-year $16.5 
million deal with a mutual 2013 option and a blanket no-trade clause. On 
August 31, 2011, Westbrook hit his first career home run, a grand slam 
against the Milwaukee Brewers.[10] In 2011, although he had a 12–9 record, 
Westbrook sported a 4.66 ERA while inducing a career high 73 walks in 183.1 
innings. Westbrook was initially left off the Cardinals' 2011 playoff roster. 
However, after the Cardinals' bullpen faced a heavy load in the National 
League Division Series and the National League Championship Series, Westbrook 
was added to the World Series Roster.[11] Westbrook pitched in two games 
and recorded a win in the pivotal game six, when the Cardinals came from 
behind to win in extra innings while facing elimination.[12] Westbrook 
improved upon his 2011 performance by recording 13 wins before suffering 
an injury that kept him out of the last month of the season and missing 
the 2012 playoffs. He finished the 2012 season with a 13-11 record and 
a 3.97 ERA, his first season since 2004 with an ERA under 4.00 in a full 
season. On July 24, 2013, Westbrook won his seventh game of the season, 
pitching seven innings while going 3–3 with a walk and a stolen base.[13] 
On October 31, 2013, the Cardinals declined their $9.5 million option on 
Westbrook for the 2014 season, making him a free agent.[14] Hampered by 
injuries after the All-Star break, Westbrook saw little action in the last 
months of the season and was left off the Cardinals post-season roster.[15] 
Westbrook finished his Cardinal career with a 36-32 win / loss record and 
a 4.27 ERA over three seasons.[15] On February 14, 2014, he announced his 
retirement from baseball.[16] Westbrook is a sinkerballer, throwing the 
pitch more than 60% of the time. It sits in the low 90s, averaging about 
91 mph. He also throws a slider/cutter in the mid-high 80s, as well as 
a changeup and curveball around 80 mph. Westbrook uses his slider on both 
lefties and righties, but throws the curveball only to righties and the 
changeup only to lefties.[17][18] In 2013, Westbrook added a split finger
