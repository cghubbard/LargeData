Inside baseball is a strategy in baseball developed by the 19th-century 
Baltimore Orioles team and promoted by John McGraw.[1] In his book, My 
Thirty Years of Baseball, McGraw credits the development of the "inside 
baseball" to manager Ned Hanlon.[2] In the 1890s, this kind of play was 
referred to as "Oriole baseball" or "Baltimore baseball". [3] It is an 
offensive strategy that focuses on teamwork and good execution. It usually 
centers on tactics that keep the ball in the infield: walks, base hits, 
bunts, and stolen bases. One such play, where the batter deliberately strikes 
the pitched ball downward onto the infield surface with sufficient force 
such that the ball rebounds skyward, allowing the batter to reach first 
base safely before the opposing team can field the ball, remains known 
as a Baltimore Chop. Another term in use in the 1890s for this style was 
"scientific baseball", referring to calculated one-run game strategies 
based on intelligent, cooperative actions of the players. An article in 
The New York Times published in 1911 described "scientific baseball": Scientific 
baseball of to-day – "inside ball" they call it – consists in making the 
opposing team think you are going to make a play one way, then shift suddenly 
and do it in another.[4] McGraw in his book writes: "So-called inside baseball 
is mostly bunk. It is merely working out of definite plans that the public 
does not observe". This strategy did not rely on big hits and home runs[1] 
and became the primary offensive strategy during the dead-ball era. The 
equivalent modern term is "small ball". Critics also note that the reputation 
of the Orioles for the "inside baseball" grew only in retrospect. At the
