As player As coach Michael Vaughn Hatcher (born March 15, 1955) is a former 
Major League Baseball player and coach. Most notably, he was Kirk Gibson's 
replacement for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1988 World Series, batting 
.368 (7/19) with two home runs and five RBI. Hatcher was born in Cleveland, 
Ohio and is a graduate of Mesa High School in Mesa, Arizona.[1] After playing 
high school baseball for Mesa High School, Hatcher attended Mesa Community 
College where he was named All-American twice in both football and baseball. 
His football jersey #81 was later retired. After starring at community 
college level he attended the University of Oklahoma, where he played both 
football and baseball. He was drafted twice (in 1974 in the 12th round 
by the Houston Astros and in 1976 in the 2nd round by the New York Mets) 
before signing with the Dodgers in 1977 (after being selected in the 5th 
round of the June draft).[2] After signing, Hatcher was assigned as an 
outfielder to the Clinton Dodgers in the Class A Midwest League.[3] The 
following season, Hatcher spent time playing for both San Antonio in the 
Class AA Texas League and AAA Albuquerque. Both stops would see him split 
time between the outfield and thirdbase â€“ presaging his major league career 
in which he would see time not only at all three outfield positions, but 
also first and thirdbase. After hitting .371 with 10 home runs, 93 RBI, 
and 88 runs for Albuquerque, Hatcher made his major league debut on August 
3, 1979 subbing in for Ron Cey at 3B.[4] Hatcher was credited with an RBI 
after taking a bases-loaded walk in the 7th inning. Hatcher would hit .269 
in 33 games for the Dodgers in 1979. Hatcher would start the 1980 season 
knocking around AAA pitching (hitting .359 in 43 games) before again being 
called up to the parent club. Hatcher would only hit .226 for the Dodgers 
and despite averaging well over .350 in the minors, his major league stats 
to date were 2 HR, 10 RBI, 13 runs, and a .249 batting average in 179 plate 
appearances. On March 30, 1981, the Dodgers traded Hatcher and two minor 
leaguers to the Minnesota Twins for veteran outfielder Ken Landreaux He 
played with the Twins from 1981 to 1986, hitting .284 in 672 games and 
then returned to the Dodgers as a free agent on April 10, 1987. He is admired 
for his fun-loving approach to playing baseball, particularly on the World 
Champion 1988 Dodger team, and was featured in various presentations to 
the tune of the "Mickey Mouse Club" song. He would sprint to first base 
after drawing walks, like Pete Rose, and garnered a lot of media attention 
in the 1988 World Series by hitting a first-inning home run in Game 1 and 
sprinting full-speed around the bases instead of jogging. This prompted 
NBC broadcaster Joe Garagiola to say "He's the cover of The Saturday Evening 
Post!" and "He's running like he's afraid they're going to take it off 
the board!" Hatcher had only hit one home run in that 1988 season, but 
hit two in the World Series. Hatcher was famously portrayed on 1986 Fleer 
and 1991 Upper Deck baseball cards with his "giant glove".[5] He remained 
with the Dodgers through 1991, spending his last season back in AAA, before 
retiring. Following his playing days, Hatcher was a coach for the Texas 
Rangers in 1993 and 1994, the manager of the Rookie League Great Falls 
Dodgers in 1996 and 1997 and began 1998 as the manager of the Single-A 
San Bernardino Stampede before becoming the hitting coach for the Dodgers 
in mid-season. In 2000, he became the hitting coach for the Los Angeles 
Angels, under manager Mike Scioscia, Hatcher's teammate from the 1988 World 
Championship team. He was fired by the Angels on May 15, 2012, after the 
team started the season 16-21.[6] The Dodgers hired Hatcher in June as 
a special assistant to the General Manager.[7] Hatcher's position was not
