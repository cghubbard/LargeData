Christopher Brian Johnson (born December 7, 1990) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Johnson was part of the No. 1 recruiting class by Baseball America at the 
University of Florida and was named a freshman All-American by Baseball 
America, Yahoo! Sports, National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association, 
and Louisville Slugger in 2010. Johnson also played for the collegiate 
national Team USA baseball squad in the summer of 2010. Johnson was one 
of only two freshmen in the entire country, the other being Gator teammate 
Nolan Fontana, to play for Team USA.[1] Johnson graduated from Cocoa Beach 
High School in Cocoa Beach, Florida in 2009 and was coached during his 
high school baseball career by Matt Kellam and Rich Coleman.[2] Johnson 
was named First-Team All-State in Florida in 2008 and 2009.[3] Johnson 
was a five-year letterman for the Minutemen and was the Florida Today Baseball 
Player of the Year in 2008 and 2009.[4] (Previous POYs include Prince Fielder 
in 2002 and Clint Hurdle in 1975). Johnson finished with 352 strikeouts 
in 252.2 career innings and a career BA of .481 with 98 runs, 40 doubles, 
21 home runs and 95 RBI.[5] Johnson also fired a 17-strikeout no-hitter 
vs. Space Coast High School in his senior year.[4] Johnson was the No. 
84 ranked player in the USA by Baseball America in 2009.[4] He was drafted 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 27th round of the 2009 MLB draft but 
did not sign and went to college instead. Johnson served as the No. 2/3 
starting pitcher for the University of Florida Gators baseball team in 
2010. Johnson's pitching repertoire features a low 90's fastball, changeup, 
and curveball. Johnson turned down the Los Angeles Dodgers to go to UF.[6] 
He helped lead the Gators to their first College World Series (CWS) appearance 
since 2005. The Gators were ranked as high as No. 2 in the country by Baseball 
America.[7] Johnson was also named to the John Olerud Award watch list.[8] 
The award, given to the top two-way player in America, was won by Mike 
McGee of Florida State University. The Gators were eliminated by Florida 
State University 8–5 in the CWS and finished with a regular season record 
of 47–17. Johnson finished the season with a .405 batting average, five 
doubles, four home runs and 21 RBIs. In his pitching statistics, he finished 
with a 6–4 record in 14 starts, 14 walks, 51 strikeouts and 73.2 innings 
pitched for a 4.03 ERA.[4] Johnson won the John Olerud Award in 2012 as 
the best two-way player in college baseball.[9] Johnson played for Team 
USA in the summer of 2010. Johnson finished second in appearances for the 
summer season with seven and he finished with the third-best ERA at 0.63 
ERA. Johnson, the youngest player on the 23-man roster, finished with a 
1–0 record, one save, 16 strikeouts, five walks and one earned run allowed 
in 14.1 innings pitched.[25] Johnson helped lead Team USA to a second-place 
finish in the 2010 International University Sports Federation World Baseball 
Championships. They fell to Cuba 4–3 in the championship game in Tokyo, 
Japan on August 7, 2010.[26] The Boston Red Sox selected Johnson in the 
first round, with the 31st pick, of the 2012 MLB draft. He signed with 
the Red Sox on June 27,[27] and received a signing bonus of $1,575,000.[28] 
Johnson made his professional debut with the Lowell Spinners of the Class 
A-Short Season New York–Penn League after he signed. Due to his heavy workload 
with Florida, the Red Sox limited Johnson's appearances for the rest of 
the season. He appeared in four games for Lowell, and had his season end 
prematurely when a line drive broke the orbital bones in his face during 
the annual Futures at Fenway event.[29] In 2013, Johnson began the season 
with the Greenville Drive of the Class A South Atlantic League, and received 
a promotion to the Salem Red Sox of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League 
in August. The Red Sox assigned Johnson to Salem at the beginning of the 
2013 season. After making five starts for Salem, the Red Sox promoted him 
to the Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League in May.[30] The 
Red Sox named Johnson their Minor League Pitcher of the Year at the end 
of the season.[31] Johnson opened the 2015 season with the Pawtucket Red 
Sox of the Class AAA International League. During the midseason, Johnson 
was included in the International League roster for the Triple-A All-Star 
Game.[32] Following an injury to Clay Buchholz, Johnson made his major 
league debut with the Red Sox on July 21, getting the loss in a 7-3 game 
against the Houston Astros. He gave up four earned runs, four walks, and 
three strikouts while pitching 4.1 innings.[33] Johnson's sister, Brooke, 
was a four-year letterman (2006–2009) for the Florida Gators softball team.[34] 
Johnson's older brother, Billy Jr., played four years of college baseball, 
finishing his career with Flagler College.[35] Brian's father, Billy Johnson, 
played football for Florida State University in the 1970s [36] Brian's 
uncle, Joe Williams, was the former head coach for Florida State University,
