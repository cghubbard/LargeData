Middlefield is a town in Middlesex County, Connecticut, United States. 
The population was 4,203 at the 2000 census. The town includes the village 
of Rockfall Middlefield, in Middlesex County, is so named because it is 
halfway between Middletown and Durham, and Middletown and Meriden. For 
such a small community, Middlefield has an abundance of wonderful history 
that goes back to the late 17th century and many first settlers of Connecticut. 
The Old North Burying Ground was established for those living west of Middletown 
and the first burial was in 1738. Middlefield became a Town in 1866 by 
an act of the Connecticut Legislature. The town was previously part of 
the City of Middletown. Charles R. "Charlie" Augur was the longest-serving 
First Selectman of the town, having served five terms. Dr. Harold Ellsworth 
Smith was Middlefield's physician for many years. Middlesex County was 
created on May 2, 1785 from Hartford and New Haven counties. The county 
was named for Middlesex, England. Middlesex County is in south-central 
Connecticut. It is bordered to the south by Long Island Sound and to the 
southwest by the Hammonasset River, and the Connecticut River bisects the 
county from north to south. Other waterways are the Menunketesuck River, 
the Moodus Reservoir, and Bashan Lake. The topography is mostly upland 
terrain, with river valleys and coastal lowlands. Parklands include Cockaponset 
State Forest, Meshomasic State Forest Preserve, and Hurd and Devil's Hopyard 
state parks. The Western Nehantic Indians inhabited the area when John 
Winthrop the Younger established the Puritan settlement of Saybrook in 
the 1630s. Later renamed Old Saybrook, it was where David Bushnell invented 
and built the Turtle (1775), a submarine used during the American Revolution. 
The county was formed in 1785 and named for Middlesex, England. Essex, 
a center of shipbuilding from the 1720s to the 1840s, was raided during 
the War of 1812. There is no county seat because the state abolished county 
government in 1960. The largest city is Middletown, home of Wesleyan University 
(founded 1831). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town 
has a total area of 13.3 square miles (34 km2), of which, 12.7 square miles 
(33 km2) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2) of it (4.65%) is 
water. The west side of Middlefield is flanked by the Metacomet Ridge, 
a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound 
to nearly the Vermont border. Notable mountains of the Metacomet Ridge 
in Middlefield include Higby Mountain and Besek Mountain. The 50 mile Mattabesett 
Trail traverses the ridge. The Nature Conservancy manages the summit and 
ledges of Higby Mountain. Middlefield offers many seasonal activities. 
Residents can also go ice-skating on one of the many ponds located at the 
edge of Peckham Park. In the summer Peckham Park has little league baseball 
games going on almost everyday of the week. The smaller kids can play on 
the jungle gym or play basketball and soccer. Some other summer activities 
could be golfing on one of the two local golf courses or go to the beach 
located on Lake Beseck just off of Route 147. Residents can also enjoy 
picking fruit, playing golf, shopping, and eating at Lyman Orchards. Middlefield, 
along with Durham, CT, forms Regional School District 13. It offers a traditional

gun sight. The crosshairs represent the gun sight manufacturing that has 
taken place in Middlefield for many years. The four quadrants of the gun 
sight are broken into different aspects of the town of Middlefield. The
