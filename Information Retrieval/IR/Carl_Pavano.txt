Carl Anthony Pavano (born January 8, 1976) is an American former professional 
baseball player. A right-handed pitcher, Pavano played in Major League 
Baseball from 1998 to 2012 for the Montreal Expos, Florida Marlins, New 
York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, and Minnesota Twins. He was a member of 
the 2003 World Series champions and appeared in the 2004 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game. Born in New Britain, Connecticut, Pavano graduated from 
Southington High School in Southington, Connecticut, the alma matter of 
former major league pitcher Rob Dibble. Pavano's retired jersey (14) still 
hangs (unretired as of 2011). At Southington, Pavano led the baseball team 
to a state championship in 1994.[1] Pavano was selected by the Boston Red 
Sox in the 13th round of the 1994 amateur draft. In 1996, with the A level 
Michigan Battle Cats, he was 6–6 with a 3.44 ERA in 22 starts. This earned 
him a number of honors including Baseball America first team Minor League 
All-Star, Double-A All-Star, Eastern League All-Star & Pitcher of the Year 
and Red Sox minor league player of the year. In 1997, with the AA Trenton 
Thunder, he was 16–5 with a 2.63 ERA in 26 starts and was selected as a 
Triple-A All-Star. In November 1997, he was sent to Montreal, along with 
pitcher Tony Armas, Jr., in a trade that brought Pedro Martínez to Boston. 
Pavano made his Major League debut on May 23, 1998 by starting and pitching 
seven strong innings against the Philadelphia Phillies. He allowed one 
run and struck out six while allowing no walks. He recorded his first win 
on June 2, 1998 when he pitched 7.1 innings, also against the Phillies. 
Pavano is well known for giving up Mark McGwire's 70th home run in the 
1998 season. He pitched four and one-half seasons for the Expos, making 
78 starts and had a record of 24–35 and an ERA of 4.83. Pavano was traded 
to the Florida Marlins in the middle of the 2002 season (with Graeme Lloyd, 
Mike Mordecai and Justin Wayne) for Cliff Floyd, Wilton Guerrero and Claudio 
Vargas. Despite having been plagued by injuries, Pavano became an important 
part of Florida's starting rotation and had a highly successful postseason 
in 2003 for the World Series-Champion Marlins. He started Game 4 of the 
Series against the Yankees, holding New York to one run over eight innings 
in a game the Marlins would go on to win, 4–3, in extra innings. Pavano 
followed up his playoff exploits with his best season to date in 2004, 
posting an 18–8 record and a 3.00 ERA. Pavano became a free agent following 
the season and, despite receiving bigger offers from Boston, Detroit, and 
Cincinnati, chose to accept a four-year contract worth $39.95 million with 
the New York Yankees on December 20, 2004.[2][3] Pavano began the 2005 
season with quality starts in seven of his first 10 appearances, compiling 
a 4–2 record and a 3.69 ERA. However, in June of that year, he injured 
his right shoulder and went on the disabled list. Pavano made 17 starts 
and finished 4–6 with a 4.77 ERA. The Yankees expected him to be healthy 
for the 2006 season, but Pavano began the season on the disabled list after 
bruising his buttocks in a spring training game. He did not pitch at all 
in the Majors in 2006, making only minor league rehab starts. On August 
15, 2006, Pavano broke two ribs in an automobile accident after he hit 
another vehicle with his Porsche in West Palm Beach, Florida.[4] Also involved 
in the wreck was Gia Allemand, who Pavano was dating at the time.[4] However, 
he did not tell the Yankees about the incident until August 28, the day 
they informed him that they planned for him to come off the disabled list 
to play that Thursday.[5] In spring training in 2007, Yankees pitcher Mike 
Mussina said that Pavano needed to prove that he wanted to pitch for the 
team. Mussina said he did not believe he was the only Yankee who felt this 
way. "It didn't look good from a player's and teammate's standpoint," Mussina 
said of Pavano's injuries. "Was everything just coincidence? Over and over 
again? I don't know." Manager Joe Torre explained that the amount of work 
Pavano needed to do in repairing his clubhouse image was "sizable." [6] 
Later that season, after ace Chien-Ming Wang injured his right hamstring 
late in spring training, the Yankees chose Pavano to start on Opening Day 
against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Yankee Stadium. On April 15, 2007, 
Pavano was placed on the 15-day DL with what was described as an "elbow 
strain". On May 23, 2007, it was reported that Pavano would opt for Tommy 
John surgery in his elbow. In December 2007, the Yankee organization asked 
Pavano to accept a minor league contract to clear space on their 40-man 
roster, Pavano's agent, Tom O'Connell, stated that he would consider the 
request, but he later turned it down. O'Connell also stated that Pavano's 
rehabilitation was going faster than expected and he might be available 
to pitch at the Major League level by mid-summer 2008.[7] On July 29, 2008, 
Pavano made his first rehab start since his Tommy John surgery for the 
Charleston RiverDogs, allowing one hit and one walk in two scoreless innings.[8] 
Pavano made his first start of the 2008 season during the Yankees series 
against the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday August 23, 2008, pitching 5 innings, 
giving up 3 earned runs on 7 hits, 1 walk and 5 strikeouts in the Yankees 
5–3 win.[9] He made his second start of the season against the Toronto 
Blue Jays on August 29 and was victorious pitching 6 innings in the Yankees 
2–1 win.[10] Since his first stint on the disabled list, Pavano did not 
endear himself to his Yankee teammates, and he stated that he would not 
visit the team when they played in Tampa Bay, near where he was rehabilitating. 
Meanwhile, Pavano's agent Tom O'Connell – the fourth agent the right-hander 
has gone through in his career – believed that Pavano would still be a 
desired commodity on the free-agent market that winter, even with his injury 
history. "Carl's a 1–2 starter. Those guys don't grow on trees. Those guys 
are very rare, 200-inning guys are very rare in this game, and they're 
the ones that make the money. And he did it two years in a row, before 
he got hurt, and I'm sure he's going to do it again," O'Connell said.[11] 
During a game Pavano started on September 14, he allowed three earned runs 
and five hits before he left the mound in the sixth inning following a 
visit by the trainer and manager Joe Girardi. Pavano was pitching to Eric 
Hinske with one out and a runner on first when he got the mound visit. 
After a short discussion, Pavano walked off the field as the sellout crowd 
showered him with boos. It was reported as a "left hip injury."[12] During 
his final season with the Yankees, following the spate of injuries that 
landed him repeatedly on the disabled list, Pavano came to be referred 
to derisively by the New York media as "American Idle." On January 6, 2009, 
Pavano signed a one-year deal with the Cleveland Indians worth $1.5 million 
with a possible $5.3 million in incentives.[13] On August 7, 2009, Pavano 
was traded to the Minnesota Twins,[14] for whom he started the crucial 
third game against the Yankees in the 2009 American League Division Series 
(ALDS).[15] Following the season, Pavano filed for free agency, but later 
accepted the Twins' offer of salary arbitration.[16] He ended up having 
his best season since 2004. During the stretch from May 29 to August 13, 
Pavano complied a record of 11–2 with an ERA of 2.79, including twice throwing 
back-to-back complete games in which one was also a shutout. He went 17-11 
with an ERA of 3.75 over the course of the season (in which he also threw 
221 innings) and helped the Twins runaway with the Central Division title. 
However, in the playoffs Pavano lost Game 2 of the 2010 ALDS to the Yankees 
at Target Field 5–2, and the Twins were swept in three games to end the 
season. For 2010, Pavano was named the Twins' Pitcher of the Year, receiving 
the Joseph W. Haynes Award.[17] On January 19, 2011, Pavano agreed to a 
2-year contract with the Twins. He was paid $8 million in 2011 and $8.5 
million in 2012, along with up to $500,000 in incentives.[18] Pavano was 
the opening day starter for the Twins on April 1. He gave up 7 earned runs 
over 4+ innings to the Toronto Blue Jays.[19] On May 1, 2011, after performing 
poorly against the Kansas City Royals, Pavano took a bat to a trashcan 
in the Minnesota Twins dugout after being removed in the sixth inning of 
a 10-3 loss. Pavano responded by saying "That's as frustrated as I can 
get. It actually felt pretty good. I just kept whaling away with it. The 
(bat) wouldn't break. I couldn't break a bat in the dugout and I couldn't 
break any out there (on the mound). It was embarrassing." [20] Pavano's 
stats as of his May 8 start were 2–4 and an ERA of 6.64, the highest of 
any Twins pitcher at this point in the season.[21] However, on May 13, 
2011, Pavano threw 5 1/3 scoreless innings against the Blue Jays but got 
the no decision in the Twins 2–0 loss.[22] His pitching continued to improve 
through late May and early June. Pavano recorded his 100th win in a complete 
game 2-run performance on June 3 against Kansas City, and he pitched another 
complete game win 12 days later against the White Sox. Pavano continued 
the season with mixed success. He finished with a 9–13 record and a 4.30 
ERA, closing out the Twins' season with a shutout of Kansas City Royals. 
Of the five starting pitchers for the Twins in 2011, Pavano was the only 
one who remained in the rotation for the entire season. Francisco Liriano, 
Brian Duensing, Nick Blackburn, and Scott Baker all missed starts due to 
injuries. Pavano was again the opening day starter for the Twins in 2012. 
He announced his retirement from baseball on February 26, 2014.[23] Pavano 
was a sinkerballer. He threw his sinker and less-used four-seam fastball 
in the mid-to-upper 80s. He also had a slider and changeup, the former 
primarily used against right-handed hitters and the latter primarily against
