The 2011 Baseball World Cup was an international baseball tournament held 
from October 1 to October 15, 2011.[1] It was the 39th and final Baseball 
World Cup. The International Baseball Federation selected Panama to host 
the tournament, turning down bids from Chinese Taipei[2] and Venezuela.[3][4] 
The Netherlands defeated Cuba 2–1 to win their first World Cup title, and 
the first by a European nation since the inaugural event in 1938 won by 
Great Britain.[5] Sixteen teams qualified for the tournament, placing high 
enough in regional tournaments that doubled as qualifying tournaments for 
the event or by automatic qualification by hosting the tournament.[6] The 
16 participating teams were divided into two round robin pools, the top 
four of each pool advancing to the second round, in which each qualified 
team played each of the qualified teams from the other pool. The top two 
teams in the standings after the second round then qualified for the championship 
final. Standings were determined by the win-loss records over all games 
played within a pool. In case of a tie, the order of the teams tied was 
determined by, in this sequence, (a) the win-loss record of the games played 
among the tied teams (=head-to-head HTH), (b) the highest difference between 
the ratios of runs scored per offensive innings and runs allowed per defensive 
innings (=Team's Quality Balance TQB), (c) the highest difference between 
the ratios of earned runs scored per offensive innings and earned runs 
allowed per defensive innings (ERTQB), (d) the highest batting average 
in the games played among the tied teams, (e) a coin flip.[7] Panama City 
was the primary city for the event, and also the host of Group 1, while 
Aguadulce, Coclé; Santiago de Veraguas; and Chitré, Herrera Province were 
host to Group 2.[8] The tournament was marred by inclement weather, causing 
a number of rainout games that had to be made up, increasing the pressure 
on the tournament schedule. In the end, eleven of the sixteen second-round 
games needed to be played within two days, requiring teams to play doubleheaders 
of games shortened to seven innings,[9] and the bronze medal game in the 
final round had to be canceled to allow the final to be played.[10] *Canada 
awarded third place and bronze medal by rule C12 of the IBAF tournament 
rules,[11] which states that the ordinary tie-breaking procedure applies 
in case of a rainout in the final round.[12] The IBAF announced the following
