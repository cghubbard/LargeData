As Player As Manager Achievements Joseph Salvatore Altobelli (born May 
26, 1932) is an American former player, manager and coach in Major League 
Baseball. In 1983, he succeeded Hall of Famer Earl Weaver as manager of 
the Baltimore Orioles and led the team to their sixth American League pennant 
and their third (and most recent) World Series championship. In 2009, Altobelli 
ended his involvement in professional baseball, retiring after over a decade 
as a color commentator for the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings. Born and raised 
in Detroit, Altobelli earned All-City recognition in football, basketball 
and baseball while attending Eastern High School.[1][2] He married Patsy 
Ruth Wooten in 1952; they had six children. As a player, Altobelli was 
a slugging first baseman and outfielder who enjoyed his greatest success 
at the AAA level. He batted only .210 in 166 games for the Cleveland Indians 
(1955, 1957) and Minnesota Twins (1961), with five home runs and 28 runs 
batted in. However, he was frequently in the double-digits in homers as 
an AAA player. As a member of the Montreal Royals, he led the 1960 International 
League (IL) in homers (31) and RBI (105). He batted and threw left-handed.[3] 
In 1951, as a member of the Daytona Beach Islanders, he ran up a 36-game 
hitting streak that stood as the Florida State League record until Harold 
Garcia's 37-gamer for the Clearwater Threshers in 2010.[4] In between, 
Altobelli played winter baseball in Venezuela in a span of three seasons. 
He claimed a batting title with a .378 average for the Gavilanes de Maracaibo 
champion team in the 1955–56 season, and later posted two solid campaigns 
with the Oriente (1956–57) and Valencia clubs (1960–61).[5] In 1966, Altobelli 
began an 11-year apprenticeship as a manager in the Baltimore farm system, 
culminating in six seasons (from 1971 to 1976) managing the Rochester Red 
Wings of the IL. During his tenure, the Red Wings finished first four times. 
In 1977, Altobelli got his first big league managing job, leading the San 
Francisco Giants. Although his 1978 club finished 16 games above .500 and 
in third place in the National League West Division, Altobelli was dismissed 
in 1979, his third season, with a mark of only 225–239 (.485) as Giants' 
manager.[6] He then joined the New York Yankees as manager of their AAA 
farm club, the Columbus Clippers.[6] After another first-place IL finish 
in 1980, Altobelli became a Yankees coach from 1981 to 1982, working under 
Gene Michael, Bob Lemon and Clyde King.[6] Before the 1983 season, Altobelli 
was named successor to Weaver after his 14½-season career as Baltimore's 
manager. Altobelli led the O's to 98 wins, the AL East championship, then 
a three-games-to-one triumph over the Chicago White Sox in the American 
League Championship Series. The Orioles then dominated the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the 1983 World Series, winning in five games.[6] The Orioles 
fell to fifth in the AL East in 1984, despite playing eight games over 
.500. In May 1985, when they continued to tread water at 29–26, Altobelli 
was let go.[citation needed] Weaver came out of retirement to win 53 of 
the remaining 105 games.[6] Altobelli then returned to coaching. He worked 
with the Yankees again (from 1986 to 1987), then served under Don Zimmer 
with the Chicago Cubs from 1988 to 1991, and filled in as interim manager 
for one game when Zimmer was fired in 1991 before being replaced by Jim 
Essian.[6] He then returned to Rochester and took over as general manager 
of the Red Wings in 1991, a position he held for three years. He then served 
as special assistant to the club president until 1997.[6] In 1998 he began 
serving as color commentator for Red Wings home-game broadcasts. In early 
2009 he announced his retirement, making 2009 the first year he was out
