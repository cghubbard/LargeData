WPIX SportsChannel NY The 1979 New York Yankees season was the 77th season 
for the franchise in New York and its 79th season overall. The season was 
marked by the death of their starting catcher, Thurman Munson, on August 
2. The team finished with a record of 89-71, finishing fourth in the American 
League East, 13.5 games behind the Baltimore Orioles, ending the Yankees' 
three-year domination of the AL East. New York was managed by Billy Martin, 
and Bob Lemon. The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. In January 1979, the 
Yankees attempted to acquire first baseman Rod Carew from the Minnesota 
Twins in exchange for Chris Chambliss, Juan Beníquez, Dámaso García, and 
Dave Righetti, but the deal fell through.[1] Carew was later traded to 
the California Angels. On August 6, the Yankees flew to Ohio to attend 
Thurman Munson's memorial service, then flew back to New York play the 
Orioles on Monday Night Baseball.[6] Bobby Murcer hit a three run home 
run in the bottom of the seventh inning, then drove in two more runs in 
the ninth with a single off former Yankee Tippy Martinez to account for 
all five Yankee runs in a 5-4 win.[7] After the game, Murcer gave the bat 
to Munson's widow.[6] On September 12, Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red 
Sox joined the 3,000 hit club with a single off Jim Beattie of the Yankees.[8] 
The same game also marked the final appearance at Fenway Park for Hall 
of Fame pitcher Catfish Hunter. On September 18, pitcher Bob Kammeyer set 
a single-season record by giving up eight earned runs without recording 
an out in his only game of the season. It was his last major league appearance. 
Munson was frequently homesick, and took flying lessons so that he could 
fly home to his family in Canton on off-days. On August 2, 1979, he was 
practicing takeoffs and landings in his new Cessna Citation I/SP jet at 
the Akron-Canton Regional Airport. On the fourth touch-and-go, Munson failed 
to lower the flaps for landing and allowed the aircraft to sink too low 
before increasing engine power, causing the jet to clip a tree and fall 
short of the runway. The plane then hit a tree stump and burst into flames, 
killing Munson (who was trapped inside) and injuring two other companions. 
It is believed that the inability to get out of the plane, and the ensuing 
asphyxiation, is what killed Munson, rather than injuries sustained on 
impact or burns (the two passengers survived). He was 32 years old.[9] 
Munson's sudden death was major news across the nation and especially sorrowed 
the baseball community. Munson was survived by his wife, Diana, and their 
three children. The day after his death, before the start of the Yankees' 
four-game set with the Baltimore Orioles in the Bronx, the Yankees paid 
tribute to their fallen captain in a pre-game ceremony during which the 
starters stood at their defensive positions, save for the catcher's box, 
which remained empty. At the conclusion of Robert Merrill's musical selection, 
the fans (announced attendance 51,151) burst into a 10-minute standing 
ovation. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Infielders
