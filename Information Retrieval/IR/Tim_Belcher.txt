Timothy Wayne Belcher (born October 19, 1961)[1] is a retired Major League 
Baseball (MLB) pitcher. He won the Sporting News Rookie Pitcher of the 
Year Award in 1988 for the National League. He was also the pitching coach 
for the Cleveland Indians. During his 14-year baseball career, Belcher 
pitched from 1987–2000 for seven different ballclubs: the Los Angeles Dodgers 
(1987–1991), Cincinnati Reds (1992–1993), Chicago White Sox (1993), Detroit 
Tigers (1994), Seattle Mariners (1995), Kansas City Royals (1996–1998), 
and Anaheim Angels (1999–2000). Belcher played high school baseball at 
Highland High School and intercollegiate varsity baseball at Mount Vernon 
Nazarene College in Mount Vernon, Ohio. He was the first draft pick in 
the 1983 Major League Baseball Draft, selected by the Minnesota Twins. 
However, he refused to sign with the Twins, and instead was selected in 
the 1984 supplemental draft by the New York Yankees. He was picked up by 
the Oakland Athletics in the compensation pool. After climbing through 
the A's system to Triple-A, he was traded to Los Angeles on September 3, 
1987, as the "player to be named later" in the Rick Honeycutt transaction. 
He made his MLB debut on September 6 as a Dodger.[2] Belcher was a member 
of the 1988 Dodgers team that won the World Series, defeating the Oakland 
Athletics. Belcher won one game in the World Series after winning twice 
in the National League Championship Series. The next year he led the National 
League with 10 complete games and MLB with eight shutouts – the most since 
Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox the previous year, while placing in 
the top ten in wins and ERA. He was the last starting pitcher in the majors 
to have more than five shutouts, until 2011, when Cliff Lee of the Philadelphia 
Phillies had six on the season. However, his stay in Los Angeles proved 
brief, as he was traded to the Reds in 1991 as a part of the Eric Davis 
multi-player transaction. He tied a career high with 15 wins for the Reds, 
but was dealt again, this time to the White Sox in the middle of the 1993 
season at the trading deadline. He won Game Four of the American League 
Championship Series in relief against the Toronto Blue Jays. Filing for 
free agency, he signed with the Tigers for 1994, but led the American League 
in losses with 15 that strike-shortened year. He returned in 1995 to the 
Reds on a one-year minor-league contract, but was soon dealt by them a 
second time, this time in May to the Mariners. New York Yankees superstar 
shortstop Derek Jeter got his first major league hit off Belcher in the 
Kingdome on May 30, 1995. At the end of the regular season, Belcher lost 
two post-season games, the only two playoff losses he suffered in his career; 
after Game 2 of the 1995 American League Division Series, he assaulted 
a cameraman in the locker room area for filming him after giving up a game-winning 
home run to Yankee catcher Jim Leyritz. Again becoming a free agent, he 
signed with the Royals for the 1996 season, spending the next three years 
with Kansas City and leading the team in wins each season. On June 5, 1999, 
Belcher was involved in an on-field brawl at Dodger Stadium. At the time 
a member of the Anaheim Angels, Belcher was pitching when then-Los Angeles 
Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park attacked him after being tagged out after 
a bunt play. Park claimed that Belcher had tagged him too hard on the just-concluded 
play and asked him about the incident. Belcher remarked with racist comments 
causing Park to kick him.[3] Belcher played his final game on September 
30, 2000. He retired in spring training in 2001, his effectiveness gone 
following a series of injuries. On November 6, 2009, Belcher was named 
pitching coach for the Cleveland Indians after spending the last eight 
seasons in the Indians organization as a Special Assistant to Baseball 
Operations. In 2012, he resumed this position with the Indians, which he 
currently holds as of June 2014. Belcher resigned his position as pitching
