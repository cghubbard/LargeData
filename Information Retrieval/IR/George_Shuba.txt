George Thomas "Shotgun" Shuba (December 13, 1924 – September 29, 2014) 
was a utility outfielder and left-handed pinch hitter in Major League Baseball 
who played seven seasons for the Brooklyn Dodgers. His seven seasons included 
three World Series as well as a World Series championship in 1955. He was 
the first National League player to hit a pinch-hit home run in a World 
Series game.[1] Shuba is often remembered for his symbolic role in breaking 
down Major League Baseball's tenacious "color barrier".[2] While playing 
for a farm team in the 1940s, Shuba offered a congratulatory handshake 
to teammate Jackie Robinson, who went on to become the first African American 
to play in a major league game since the late 19th century.[2] The moment 
was captured in a well-known photograph dubbed A Handshake for the Century 
for featuring the first interracial handshake in a professional baseball 
game.[2] In the early 1970s, Shuba's major league career was featured in 
a chapter of Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, a tribute to the 1950s Brooklyn 
Dodgers.[1] Kahn observed in his book that Shuba earned his nickname, "Shotgun", 
by "spraying line drives with a swing so compact that it appeared as natural 
as a smile".[3] Shuba was born the youngest of 10 children to Slovak immigrants 
in Youngstown, Ohio, a steel-manufacturing town with a strong tradition 
of amateur and minor league baseball.[2] His father, Jan Shuba, emigrated 
from eastern Czechoslovakia in 1912. Jan Shuba was 45 years old at the 
time of George's birth, and he did little to encourage his son's interest 
in sports.[4] As a child, George Shuba attended Holy Name Elementary School, 
a parochial school on the city's heavily Eastern European west side.[2] 
Shuba was an avid baseball player throughout his youth, and he usually 
served as a second baseman in neighborhood games.[5] In 1943, when he was 
17 years old, he participated in a tryout for the Brooklyn Dodgers and 
eventually signed a contract.[6] As Shuba later recalled, an ear injury 
sustained while being disciplined by a teacher prevented him from entering 
the U.S. Army during World War II. He would gain valuable experience playing 
for minor league clubs throughout the war years.[2] After signing a contract 
with the Dodgers, Shuba played for farm teams in New Orleans and Mobile.[7] 
He later recalled that his father opposed the move, because he "thought 
I should go and work in the mills like him".[6] Shuba pursued his goal, 
however, developing his "natural" swing by practicing for hours with a 
rope that was tied to the ceiling.[2] He made knots in the rope where the 
strike zone would be and swung a bat at the rope 600 times a day. This 
rigorously observed ritual prepared Shuba to compete in the major leagues,[2] 
where his powerful line drives later earned him the nickname, "Shotgun".[2] 
In the mid-1940s, Shuba was recruited by the Montreal Royals, a major farm 
team for the Brooklyn Dodgers.[2] The New York Times described the historic 
day: On the afternoon of April 18, 1946, Robinson became the first black 
player in modern organized baseball when he made his debut with the Dodgers’ 
Montreal Royals farm team in their International League opener against 
the Jersey City Giants. In the third inning, Robinson hit a three-run homer 
over the left-field fence. When he completed his trip around the bases, 
Shuba, the Royals’ left fielder and their next batter, shook his hand. 
Congratulating a home-run hitter was a commonplace ritual, but Shuba's 
welcome to a smiling Robinson was captured in an Associated Press photograph 
that has endured as a portrait of racial tolerance.[8] The moment was described 
as the first interracial handshake in North American baseball's recent 
history.[9] Despite a record that seemed to merit promotion, he spent the 
1947 and 1948 baseball seasons with the minor league Mobile Bears.[10] 
Shuba later told Roger Kahn that in 1947, he hit 21 home runs and knocked 
in 110 runs.[10] The next year, Shuba worked up a batting average of .389.[10] 
In response, Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey complained that Shuba's 
"power fell off", adding that the team needed "someone who can hit them 
over that short right-field wall in Ebbets Field".[10] Frustrated, Shuba 
returned to Mobile in the spring of 1948.[10] "What could I say?" Shuba 
explained in an interview with Kahn. "As long as he could option me, you 
know, send me down but keep me Dodger property, Rickey would do that so's 
he could keep some other guy whose option ran out. Property, that's what 
we were. But how many guys you know ever hit .389 and never got promoted?"[10] 
Shuba made his major league debut with the Dodgers on July 2, 1948. At 
the peak of his playing career, Shuba delivered a pinch-hit homer in the 
1953 World Series opener, which the New York Yankees won 9–5. Ultimately, 
he worked up a career batting average of .259 on 211 hits in 814 trips, 
with 125 RBIs, 106 runs scored, and 45 doubles and 24 homers.[1] Playing 
for the Dodgers, Shuba watched as teammate Jackie Robinson won the league's 
MVP (1949).[2] A recent feature article noted that Shuba's "best year was 
in 1952 when he batted .305 (78-for-256) with nine homers, 40 RBIs and 
40 runs scored".[1] Knee surgery, however, reduced his effectiveness after 
that season.[11] Shuba played his final game on September 25, 1955.[12] 
He appeared in the seventh and final game of that year's World Series; 
he pinch-hit for Don Zimmer in the sixth inning and grounded out for the 
final out. The Dodgers defeated the Yankees on Johnny Podres' 2-0 shutout 
for what would be the franchise's only World Championship in its Brooklyn 
history (the Dodgers would move to Los Angeles after the 1957 season). 
Shuba remained single during his professional baseball career. Roger Kahn 
wrote in The Boys of Summer that the young player spent his years with 
the Dodgers as "a bachelor living alone and apart from the rest of the 
players".[3] After retiring from Major League Baseball, Shuba returned 
to Ohio, where he met his future wife. The couple settled in Austintown, 
a suburb of Youngstown. Shuba and his wife, Katherine, who was nine years 
his junior, raised three children.[13] Despite the visibility he gained 
as a professional athlete, Shuba remained deeply connected to his ethnic 
and religious roots. Kahn recalled that during a visit to the Shuba household 
in the early 1970s, the ex-ballplayer recited a mealtime prayer in the 
Slovak language. Shuba explained to Kahn that his father had recited the 
prayer before every family meal.[13] Shuba lived in the Youngstown area 
since his retirement from Major League Baseball in 1955. In the early 1970s, 
he was interviewed at his Austintown home by Roger Kahn, who was conducting 
research for The Boys of Summer, a literary tribute to the 1950s Brooklyn 
Dodgers.[1] Over the years, Shuba received recognition for his symbolic 
role in promoting interracial harmony in professional baseball. A 2006 
article that appeared in the Chicago Tribune noted that he continued to 
take pride in the photograph of his groundbreaking handshake with teammate 
Robinson. A copy of the photo hung behind his favorite living room chair.[9] 
During a 1996 interview with a Youngstown news reporter, Shuba recalled 
his impressions of the legendary Robinson: "To me, Jackie was like all 
the other guys, a player who came to play and we knew he would be a good 
one, but what me or anyone else at the time didn't know was how good he 
would be".[14] In a 2007 reference to Robinson's courage and determination, 
Shuba credited the other player with imparting "a lesson about life that 
I have never forgotten".[1] That same year, Shuba highlighted the event 
in his memoir, My Memories as a Brooklyn Dodger, which he co-wrote with 
Youngstown-area writer Greg Gulas.[15] On September 18, 2007, Youngstown's 
Borts Ball Field, a west side recreational spot that Shuba frequented as 
a child, was renamed as the George "Shotgun" Shuba Field at Borts Park.[15][16] 
Shuba died on September 29, 2014, at the age of 89.[17] He was the last 
living Brooklyn Dodger who appeared in the final game of the 1955 World
