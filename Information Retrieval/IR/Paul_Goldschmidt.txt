Paul Edward Goldschmidt (born September 10, 1987), nicknamed "Goldy", is 
an American professional baseball first baseman for the Arizona Diamondbacks 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut with the Diamondbacks 
in 2011. Goldschmidt is a four-time MLB All-Star. He has won the National 
League Hank Aaron Award, Gold Glove Award, and Silver Slugger Award. Paul 
Goldschmidt was born in Wilmington, Delaware, and grew up in The Woodlands, 
Texas, a suburb of Houston. He attended The Woodlands High School and attended 
Texas State University to play college baseball for the Texas State Bobcats 
baseball team. He was twice named the Southland Conference hitter of the 
year (2008 and 2009), once named Southland player of the year (2009)[1] 
and was a third-team All-American as a junior in 2009 after hitting .352 
with 18 home runs and 88 runs batted in (RBIs) in 57 games played.[2] Goldschmidt 
set records for home runs (36), doubles (45), walks (110) and RBI (369) 
during his three-year career at Texas State. The Arizona Diamondbacks selected 
Goldschmidt in the eighth round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft.[3] 
In 2009 he excelled in Rookie League for the Missoula Osprey, hitting .334 
and 18 home runs along with 62 RBI in his first half-season of professional 
baseball. He continued his success the following year in the California 
League, where he was selected as an all-star as well as the league's Most 
Valuable Player. He was also named the Arizona Diamondbacks Minor League 
Player of the Year.[4] In 2011, he was again named the Diamondbacks' player 
of the year, a Baseball America first-team Minor League All-Star, Double-A 
all-star first baseman, Southern League all-star first baseman, and Southern 
League Most Valuable Player.[5] Overall, Goldschmidt hit .317 with a .407 
on-base percentage and 83 home runs in two and a half minor league seasons. 
Goldschmidt was called up to the majors on August 1, 2011, becoming the 
first Texas State position player to play in the major leagues.[6] At the 
time of his call-up, he was leading the minors with 30 home runs. Goldschmidt 
tallied a base hit in his first at-bat on August 1, and hit his first home 
run the next day off San Francisco Giants pitcher Tim Lincecum. In his 
rookie season, Goldschmidt batted .250 with 8 home runs and 26 RBI in 48 
games. In Game 3 of the NLDS playoffs against the Brewers, Goldschmidt 
hit a grand slam home run to extend the team's lead in its first victory 
of the series. His homer was the third grand slam by a rookie in MLB postseason 
history.[7] The Diamondbacks lost the series in five games, and Goldschmidt 
batted .438 with 6 RBI and an OBP of .526. In 2012, Goldschmidt played 
145 games and batted .286 with 20 home runs, 82 runs, 82 RBIs, 43 doubles, 
and 18 stolen bases. Goldschmidt hit his first career regular-season grand 
slam on June 1 off of Chicago Cubs pitcher Carlos MÃ¡rmol at Wrigley Field. 
Four days later, Goldschmidt hit another grand slam off St. Louis Cardinals 
reliever Maikel Cleto. Goldschmidt hit a third grand slam on August 20, 
2013 against pitcher J. J. Hoover of the Cincinnati Reds. During the 2013 
MLB season, Goldschmidt was selected to the National League all-star team. 
Goldschmidt collected one of only three hits for the National League team, 
and the only extra-base hit, when he doubled with two outs in the ninth 
inning. On August 13, he hit a game-tying home run against the Baltimore 
Orioles in the bottom of the ninth inning to send the game into extra innings. 
Goldschmidt then hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the eleventh, 
becoming the first Diamondbacks player to record game-tying and walk-off 
home runs in the same game. In 160 games that season, he would compile 
a .302 batting average, 36 home runs, and 125 RBI. In 2014, Goldschmidt 
batted .300 with 19 home runs, 75 runs, and 69 RBIs before a broken hand 
ended his season on August 1. Goldschmidt was the starting first basemen 
for the NL in the 2014 MLB All-Star Game. On June 10, 2015, Goldschmidt 
hit his 100th career home run against Brett Anderson of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. He is now 6th on the Diamondbacks' all-time home run list.[8] 
Later that year Goldschmidt would again be the starting first baseman for 
the NL in the All-Star Game. Goldschmidt would bat a .321 batting average 
with 33 home runs and 110 RBI in 2015. He would win his second Gold Glove 
Award and Silver Slugger Award.[9] In 2016, Goldschmidt batted .297 with 
24 home runs, 106 runs, and 95 RBIs in 579 at-bats. Goldschmidt was again 
named to the NL All-Star Team, to play in San Diego where he went 0 for 
3, recording a fielder's choice in the ninth inning. Goldschmidt met his 
future wife, Amy, during his freshman year at Texas State; the couple married 
in October 2010.[10] On September 2, 2015, Goldschmidt's son, Jake, was 
born.[11][12] Goldschmidt is a Christian.[13][14] In September 2013, Goldschmidt 
graduated from University of Phoenix with a Bachelor of Science degree
