Dwayne Keith Murphy (born March 18, 1955) is a former Major League Baseball 
player who spent most of his career playing for the Oakland Athletics as 
an outfielder. He was the first base coach for the Toronto Blue Jays during 
the 2013 season,[1] and retired after that season. Murphy was drafted by 
the Oakland Athletics in 1973 and made his Major League debut in 1978. 
He spent nine years with the Athletics and played under managers, Billy 
Martin, Sparky Anderson, and Tony La Russa.[2] The A's made the playoffs 
in 1981, where they lost to the New York Yankees in the American League 
Championship Series. In those playoffs, Murphy hit .421 and hit one home 
run in six games. Murphy's biggest offensive year came in 1984, where he 
hit 33 home runs and drove in 88 runs. Murphy also drew many walks which 
led to a very high on-base percentage, and had excellent speed on the base 
paths. He stole 26 bases in both 1980 and 1982.[3] He was also one of the 
best defensive outfielders of his time, receiving six consecutive Gold 
Gloves from 1980 through 1985. Murphy had a signature play where his hat 
blew off his head virtually every time he made a spectacular catch. It 
occasionally even happened on routine fly balls and it eventually became 
Murphy's trademark.[4] During most of his career in Oakland, he batted 
second in the lineup behind hall-of-famer Rickey Henderson. Henderson credits 
Murphy for helping him set the single-season stolen-base record of 130 
steals in 1982.[5] Murphy finished his career with 166 home runs, 609 runs 
batted in, a .356 on-base percentage, 100 stolen bases, and 6 Gold Glove 
awards in 1360 games. After retirement as a player, Murphy became a coach 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks from 1998 to 2003. He was the Diamondbacks' 
hitting coach when they won the World Series in 2001. In 2005 and 2006 
he became hitting coach for the Syracuse Skychiefs, the Triple-A affiliate 
of the Toronto Blue Jays. He was promoted to first base coach for the Blue 
Jays in 2008 when manager Cito Gaston took over for John Gibbons.[6] Murphy 
was born in Merced, California, about 120 miles from Oakland. After graduating 
from Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, California, Murphy was drafted 
in the 15th round in the 1973 draft by the Oakland Athletics, after turning 
down a football scholarship from Arizona State University.[7] He came up 
to the majors for the first time in 1978 at age 23. He would spend the 
large bulk of his career with Oakland. Murphy struggled in his rookie year. 
While he only played in 60 games that season, he managed to collect just 
10 hits in 52 plate appearances (giving him an .182 batting average) and 
he did not hit a home run. His numbers improved as he became the A's everyday 
center fielder. His power numbers grew as well. The Athletics in the early 
1980s had an outfield of Murphy, Rickey Henderson, and Tony Armas, and 
many fans saw it as the best young outfield in baseball. Murphy hit second 
in the lineup throughout most of his career with the A's batting behind 
Rickey Henderson. Henderson credits Murphy for helping him set the single-season 
stolen-base record of 130 steals in 1982. After Henderson stole his 119th 
base that season, he pulled the base up out of the ground and kept it. 
Afterwards, in an interview, he said, "If I could break this base in half, 
I'd give the other half to Dwayne Murphy."[5] Murphy also credits Henderson 
with helping him have a good career. "I took a lot of pitches for him", 
Murphy said. "He made my career, I believe, because I let him steal and 
that put me in a position to knock in runs. I loved to watch him play. 
Let him steal second, let him steal third, knock him in. It gave me a respectable 
career." Like Henderson, Murphy also had good speed. He stole 26 bases 
in both 1980 and 1982. He also had good power numbers. His biggest offensive 
year came in 1984, when he hit 33 home runs and drove in 88 runs. He was 
one of the best defensive players in the game, winning an incredible six 
straight Gold Gloves from 1980 to 1985. His signature play became a trademark 
of sorts for him – his hat blowing off his head on virtually every play 
he made, from tracking down routine fly balls to making spectacular catches 
deep in the Valley.[2] After nine years in Oakland, he spent his final 
two seasons with the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies. He played 
in 49 games with the Tigers in 1988, hitting .250 and hitting four home 
runs. In his final season with the Phillies, he hit just .218 and hit 9 
home runs. In 1990, he joined the Yakult Swallows in Japan. Injuries limited 
his effectiveness, and the Swallows released him in August. Following his 
playing career, Murphy began a coaching career. He coached with the Arizona 
Diamondbacks from 1998 to 2003, including serving as hitting coach in 2001, 
when the Diamondbacks won the World Series. In 2005 he was hired by the 
Toronto Blue Jays as a hitting coach, first for the Blue Jays' triple-A 
affiliate, the Syracuse SkyChiefs, and then later as a "roving" instructor, 
visiting all the team's minor league clubs to help players with hitting. 
He held that position when he was named the team's first base coach on 
June 20, 2008, in the wake of Cito Gaston's nomination to replace the fired 
John Gibbons as Blue Jay manager. Blue Jays' outfielder Adam Lind has an 
intimate relationship with Murphy, "He keeps me loose", Lind says. "He 
can dish it out and take it, too. Some coaches you have more of a formal, 
professional relationship with. With him, you have fun. He talks about 
how good he was, and I tell him how bad he is. Yeah, he had a good career. 
At least that's what he keeps telling me."[8] On October 30, 2009 he became 
the Blue Jays' hitting coach, following the retirement of Gene Tenace.[9] 
On November 24, 2012, Murphy was appointed as the Blue Jays' first base 
coach and outfield coach when Chad Mottola became their hitting coach.[10]
