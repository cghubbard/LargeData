Bethpage is a hamlet located on Long Island within the Town of Oyster Bay 
in Nassau County, New York, United States, as well as a census-designated 
place (CDP) with borders slightly different from those of the hamlet. The 
CDP's population was 16,429 at the 2010 United States Census.[1] The area 
is served by the Bethpage Post Office, ZIP code 11714, whose boundaries 
are slightly different from that of the CDP. The area is also served by 
the Bethpage Union Free School District, the boundaries of which include 
parts of some surrounding hamlets, including parts of Old Bethpage, Plainview, 
and Plainedge. The Town of Hempstead, on its website, includes a small 
part of Bethpage hamlet that is in the Levittown census-designated place.[2] 
The name Bethpage comes from the Quaker Thomas Powell, who named the area 
after the Biblical town Bethphage, which was between Jericho and Jerusalem 
in the Holy Land. Present-day Bethpage was part of the 1695 Bethpage Purchase. 
An early name for the northern section of present-day Bethpage was Bedelltown,[3][4] 
a name that appeared on maps at least as late as 1906.[5] On maps just 
before the arrival of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), the name Bethpage 
appears for a community now included in both the post office district and 
school district of the adjacent community of Farmingdale.[6] In 1841,[7] 
train service began to Farmingdale station, near a new settlement less 
than a mile eastward from what had previously appeared on maps as Bethpage. 
Schedules at that time do not mention Bethpage as a stop, but have a notation 
"late Bethpage".[8] On an 1855 map,[9] the location identified as Bethpage 
has shifted slightly westward to include a nearby area now called Plainedge. 
Between 1851[10] and 1854,[11] the LIRR initiated a stop within present-day 
Bethpage at a station then called Jerusalem Station, and on January 29, 
1857 a local post office opened, also named Jerusalem Station.[12][13] 
LIRR schedules listed the station also as simply Jerusalem.[14][15] Residents 
succeeded in changing the name of the post office to Central Park, effective 
March 1, 1867 (respelled as Centralpark from 1895 to 1899).[12][16] The 
Central Park Fire Company was organized in April 1910, and incorporated 
in May 1911. In May 1923 the Central Park Water District was created. Following 
the 1932 opening of nearby Bethpage State Park, the name of the local post 
office was changed to Bethpage on October 1, 1936. The name Bethpage was, 
however, already in use by an adjacent community,[3] which resisted suggestions 
of a merger and instead renamed itself Old Bethpage. The change from Central 
Park to Bethpage was one of the last complete name changes of Nassau County's 
post offices.[12] From 1936 until 1994, Bethpage was home to the Grumman 
Aircraft Engineering Corporation, which made, among other things, the F-14 
Tomcat, the Navy version of the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark and the 
Apollo Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) for moon landings, and for this reason 
Bethpage is mentioned in the film Apollo 13. In 1994, Grumman was purchased 
by Northrop and formed Northrop Grumman. Although no longer headquartered 
in Bethpage, the company still retains operations there.[citation needed] 
The Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, Bethpage (NWIRP) started operations 
in 1942, west of the Grumman site.[17] Cablevision Systems Corporation, 
a Fortune 500 company, is headquartered in Grumman's former main office. 
In August 2015, a small airplane with engine trouble failed to reach Farmingdale 
airport, and was redirected to "Bethpage Airport" by the air traffic controller. 
However, the pilot could not find that airport because it was closed and 
had buildings on it, and the plane crashed on LIRR tracks.[18][19] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.6 square 
miles (9.3 km2), all land. For the 2000 Census, the boundaries of the CDP 
were adjusted compared to those of the 1990 census, with some territory 
gained and some lost.[20] Bethpage is surrounded by Farmingdale, Plainview, 
Levittown, Hicksville, Old Bethpage and Plainedge. Although the majority 
of the hamlet of Plainedge is Bethpage, it then also borders Seaford, North 
Massapequa and South Farmingdale. As of the census of 2010,[22] there were

taste of the water had declined.[citation needed] Congressional Medal of

cancers and birth defects in Bethpage is statistically well above the national
