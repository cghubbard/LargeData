Charles Hugh O'Brien (born May 1, 1960 in Tulsa, Oklahoma) is a former 
Major League Baseball catcher who played for the Oakland Athletics (1985), 
Milwaukee Brewers (1987–90), New York Mets (1990–93), Atlanta Braves (1994–95), 
Toronto Blue Jays (1996–97), Chicago White Sox (1998), Anaheim Angels (1998–99) 
and Montreal Expos (2000). O'Brien was a solid defensive catcher and a 
modest right-handed batter. He is best remembered for pioneering the hockey-style 
catcher's mask. He was playing with the Toronto Blue Jays when he invented 
this different style of mask. O'Brien grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, beginning 
to play baseball as a catcher at the age of 5.[1] While growing up in Tulsa, 
O'Brien attended and graduated from Bishop Kelley High School. The Texas 
Rangers drafted O'Brien in the 14th round of the 1978 MLB draft, but did 
not sign him. O'Brien attended Wichita State University, where he played 
college baseball for the Wichita State Shockers baseball team. The Seattle 
Mariners drafted O'Brien in the 21st round of the 1981 MLB draft, but O'Brien 
did not sign, returning to college for his senior year. In his senior year, 
O'Brien set school records, hitting 25 home runs and driving in 116 runs 
as the Shockers reached the finals of the 1982 College World Series. The 
Oakland Athletics drafted O'Brien in the fifth round of the 1982 MLB draft, 
and signed him. O'Brien made his MLB debut with the Athletics on June 2, 
1985. The Athletics traded O'Brien with Steve Kiefer and minor leaguers 
Mike Fulmer and Pete Kendrick to the Milwaukee Brewers for Moose Haas. 
He batted .324 with 15 home runs and 74 RBI with the El Paso Diablos of 
the Class AA Texas League in 1986.[2] The Brewers traded O'Brien with a 
player to be named later (minor leaguer Kevin Carmody) to the New York 
Mets with players to be named later (Julio Machado and Kevin Brown) in 
August 1990.[3] He began the 1991 season as the starting catcher, ahead 
of Mackey Sasser[4] and served as a backup to Todd Hundley when he was 
promoted.[5] O'Brien agreed to a $370,000 contract for the 1992 season.[5] 
He was granted free agency for the 1993 season, and he signed with the 
Atlanta Braves on a two-year contract worth $1.1 million.[6] He was a member 
of the 1995 World Series champions, and hit a key home run for the Braves 
during the 1995 National League Championship Series.[7] After the 1995 
season, O'Brien became a free agent and signed with the Toronto Blue Jays 
on a two-year contract. He signed with the Chicago White Sox for the 1998 
season in order to share the catching position with Chad Kreuter,[8] but 
was traded to the Anaheim Angels for minor leaguers Brian Tokarse and Jason 
Stockstill in July 1998.[9] The Angels released O'Brien on August 6, 1999, 
replacing him with Benjie Molina.[10] O'Brien signed with the Montreal 
Expos for the 2000 season, but his ability to prevent opposing baserunners 
from stealing bases had diminished as he was 40 years old.[11] The Expos 
released O'Brien on June 22, 2000.[12] Over the course of his career, O'Brien 
had the distinction of catching eleven different Cy Young winners: Frank 
Viola, Dwight Gooden, Bret Saberhagen, David Cone, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, 
John Smoltz, Pat Hentgen, Roger Clemens, Chris Carpenter and Jack McDowell.[1] 
However, he only caught three of these pitchers during Cy Young seasons—Clemens, 
Hentgen & Maddux. During Maddux's '94 and '95 seasons when he posted ERA's 
of 1.56 and 1.63 respectively, O'Brien generally served as Maddux's personal 
catcher.[13] O'Brien later testified at Clemens' perjury trial.[14] After 
getting hit in his mask by two consecutive foul-tip balls in a game, O'Brien 
had the idea for a new catcher's mask while he was watching a hockey game. 
He worked with Van Velden Mask Inc., of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, to develop 
his idea. The new design, called the All-Star MVP, was approved in 1996 
by Major League Baseball.[1][15] In his 15-year career, O'Brien batted 
.221 with 56 home runs and 261 runs batted in. He was part of the 1995 
World Series Champion Atlanta Braves. O'Brien is an avid deer hunter.[16] 
His son, Chris O'Brien, is also a professional baseball catcher. Chris 
played college ball at Wichita State University and was drafted in the
