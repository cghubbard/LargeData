As player As manager Miller James Huggins (March 27, 1878 – September 25, 
1929) was an American professional baseball player and manager. Huggins 
played second base for the Cincinnati Reds (1904–1909) and St. Louis Cardinals 
(1910–1916). He managed the Cardinals (1913–1917) and New York Yankees 
(1918–1929), including the Murderers' Row teams of the 1920s that won six 
American League (AL) pennants and three World Series championships. Huggins 
was born in Cincinnati. He received a degree in law from the University 
of Cincinnati, where he was also captain on the baseball team. Rather than 
serve as a lawyer, Huggins chose to pursue a professional baseball career. 
He played semi-professional and minor league baseball from 1898 through 
1903, at which time he signed with the Reds. As a player, Huggins was adept 
at getting on base. He was also an excellent fielding second baseman, earning 
the nicknames "Rabbit", "Little Everywhere", and "Mighty Mite" for his 
defensive prowess and was later considered an intelligent manager who understood 
the fundamentals of the game. Despite fielding successful teams for the 
Yankees in the 1920s, he continued to make personnel changes in order to 
maintain his teams' superiority in the AL. He was elected to the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1964. Huggins was born 
in Cincinnati, where his father, an Englishman, worked as a grocer.[1] 
His mother was a native of Cincinnati. He had two brothers and one sister.[2] 
"You can become a pleader or a player, not both. Try baseball. You seem 
to like it better." Huggins attended Woodward High School, Walnut Hills 
High School, and later the University of Cincinnati.,[2][3] where he studied 
law and played college baseball for the Cincinnati Bearcats baseball team. 
A shortstop, he was named team captain of the Bearcats in 1900.[2] Seeing 
him consumed with baseball, his law professors summoned him to justify 
why they should keep him in the law program.[3] Huggins' father, a devout 
Methodist, objected to his son playing baseball on Sundays.[1] But Huggins 
played semi-professional baseball in 1898 for the Cincinnati Shamrocks, 
a team organized by Julius Fleischmann,[4] where he played under the pseudonym 
"Proctor" due to his father's opposition and his amateur status.[1][2] 
In 1900, he played for Fleischmann's semiprofessional team based in the 
Catskill Mountains, the Mountain Tourists, leading the team with a .400 
batting average.[1][2] After receiving his law degree from Cincinnati, 
Huggins realized that he could make even more money playing baseball,[1] 
and as such William Howard Taft, one of Huggins' law professors, advised 
him to play baseball.[4][5] He was admitted to the bar, but never practiced 
law.[6] Huggins began his playing career in minor league baseball with 
the Mansfield Haymakers of the Class B Interstate League in 1899. He continued 
his minor league apprenticeship with the St. Paul Saints of the American 
Association from 1901 through 1903.[4] After starting his career as an 
exclusively right-handed hitter, he began to bat from the left side in 
1902 in response to his offensive struggles in the 1901 season while also 
moving to second base during his time at St. Paul.[2] Huggins handled 19 
fielding chances, 11 putouts and nine assists, without committing an error 
in a game with the Saints in 1902; the previous Major League Baseball (MLB) 
record being 18, set by Fred Dunlap in 1882.[7] In 1903, he pulled off 
the first delayed steal in recorded baseball history.[3] Fleischmann, part-owner 
of the Cincinnati Reds of the National League (NL), kept an eye on Huggins 
while he played for St. Paul. The Reds duly purchased his contract from 
the Saints before the 1904 season.[2] He made his MLB debut on April 15, 
1904,[7] and proved very adept at getting on base. He batted .264 with 
the Reds that season and improved in the 1906 season, finishing with a 
.292 batting average and 41 stolen bases,[4] while spending considerable 
time developing his upper-body strength.[2] Although Huggins hoped to be 
selected as Ned Hanlon's successor as Cincinnati's manager after the 1907 
season, the Reds instead went with John Ganzel.[8] In 1908, He played with 
the Reds in the Cuban-American Major League Clubs Series. Hampered by a 
broken ankle and torn ligaments in his shoulder, he slumped to .209 in 
1909.[2] Before the 1910 season, the Reds traded Huggins, along with Frank 
Corridon and Rebel Oakes, to the St. Louis Cardinals in return for Fred 
Beebe and Alan Storke. He set an MLB record on June 1, 1910 with six plate 
appearances but no at bats, with four walks and two sacrifice flies.[4][7] 
In the same year, he batted .265 for the Cardinals and led the NL in walks.[9] 
On July 13, 1911, he tied the NL record for successful fielding chances 
in a game with 16.[4] At the end of the season, he finished sixth in the 
voting for the Chalmers Award for Most Valuable Player. In 1912, he hit 
over .300 for the first time in his career.[2] Huggins became player-manager 
for the Cardinals after the 1912 season, succeeding Roger Bresnahan,[10][11][12] 
with team owner Helene Hathaway Britton preferring his "gentlemanly" manner 
over Bresnahan's rougher personality.[13] With the acquisition of speed 
in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates, including Dots Miller, Art Butler, 
Cozy Dolan and Chief Wilson, the Cardinals contended for the NL pennant 
in 1914.[14] Finishing in third place, it was the Cardinals' best finish 
since 1876,[13] but they fell back to sixth in 1915 and last in 1916.[13] 
When Britton sold the team after that season, she offered Huggins a chance 
to buy a part of the team. While he was attempting to raise money from 
the Fleischmann family, Britton sold the team to a group headed by Samuel 
Breadon, who hired Branch Rickey to run the team's day-to-day operations 
in the front office.[13] Huggins had coached the young Rogers Hornsby, 
helping him to correct his batting stance,[10] and Hornsby duly succeeded 
him as the team's starting second baseman in 1917 as Huggins ended his 
playing career.[13] He managed the team during 1917, the last year of his 
contract, but was not retained.[13] With the New York Yankees of the American 
League (AL) not performing well, Yankees owners Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast 
L'Hommedieu Huston sought to replace "Wild" Bill Donovan as manager.[15] 
Ban Johnson, AL president, suggested Huggins to Ruppert as a replacement 
for Donovan. Huston, who had been in Europe at the time that Ruppert had 
made the appointment, disliked Huggins and wanted to hire Wilbert Robinson, 
his drinking buddy.[15] Ruppert himself had been put off by Huggins' wool 
cap and practice of smoking pipes in public, which he felt was the mark 
of the working class.[15] However, Ruppert interviewed Huggins upon Johnson's 
recommendation, and agreed that Huggins knew much about baseball.[15] Ruppert 
offered the job to Huggins, who initially did not want to take the position, 
as the Yankees were in no better a position than the Cardinals. J. G. Taylor 
Spink of The Sporting News eventually convinced Huggins to accept the offer,[15] 
and he signed a two-year contract.[16] The hiring of Huggins drove a wedge 
between the two co-owners that culminated in Huston selling his shares 
of the team to Ruppert in 1922.[3][17] "I call him the squarest shooter 
I ever knew in baseball." Having taken charge Huggins did not shy away 
from making personnel changes.[18][19][20] Upon taking over the Yankees, 
he stressed fundamental baseball, drilling the Yankees in the art of the 
bunt.[21] Huggins also made his first player transaction, acquiring Del 
Pratt and Eddie Plank from the St. Louis Browns trading Nick Cullop, Joe 
Gedeon, Fritz Maisel, Les Nunamaker, Urban Shocker and $15,000 ($236,383 
in current dollar terms),[22] a move that led to criticism in the press.[21] 
In Huggins' first season with the Yankees, the team finished fourth in 
the AL.[23] After that season, he obtained Ernie Shore, Dutch Leonard and 
Duffy Lewis from the Boston Red Sox, for Ray Caldwell, Frank Gilhooley, 
Slim Love, and Roxy Walters.[22] The following year he traded Pratt, Muddy 
Ruel, Hank Thormahlen and Sammy Vick to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt, Harry 
Harper, Mike McNally and Wally Schang.[22] Huggins signed a one-year contract 
to remain with the Yankees for a reported $12,000.[24] Huston continually 
took the side of his players in any argument they had against Huggins,[15] 
criticizing Huggins in the press when the Yankees lost the pennant in 1920.[15] 
Meanwhile, Ruppert was at best a lukewarm advocate of Huggins.[25] Babe 
Ruth resisted Huggins' discipline; he did not respect Huggins due to his 
small stature, soft-spoken nature, and inability to fight,[26] and Huggins 
was unable to enforce punishments on Ruth.[25] The Yankees finished third 
in the AL in 1919 and 1920.[23] Huggins signed a one-year contract to remain 
with the team in 1921.[24] Coming into the 1921 season, Huggins was still 
experiencing criticism in the press. Hugh Fullerton wrote that "in the 
past Huggins has not shone as a leader of men".[27] By that season, Huggins 
developed Aaron Ward, Wally Pipp, and Bob Shawkey.[28] The Yankees won 
their first AL pennant in 1921,[23] reaching the World Series for the first 
time in franchise history, silencing his critics in the press. However, 
they lost the 1921 World Series to the New York Giants. In response, Huggins 
sought to add more pitching talent.[29] Before the 1922 season, Huggins 
acquired Johnny Mitchell from the Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League 
and traded fan favorite Roger Peckinpaugh along with Rip Collins, Bill 
Piercy, and Jack Quinn to the Red Sox for Everett Scott, Bullet Joe Bush, 
and Sad Sam Jones.[22] By this time, Ruppert hired Ed Barrow as the team's 
business manager, and he aided Huggins in player transactions.[30] The 
Yankees repeated as AL champions that season,[23] but lost the 1922 World 
Series, again to the Giants. With the newly gained confidence of his owners, 
Huggins was retained as manager.[31][32] The Yankees won their first World 
Series in 1923, preventing the Giants from repeating as champions for the 
third consecutive season.[33] They were unable to retain their title the 
following season however, finishing second in the AL to the Washington 
Senators.[23] Huggins had come to regret his trade of Urban Shocker to 
the Browns. In St. Louis, the spitballer Shocker had come into his own 
as a starter, racking up four straight 20-win seasons in the years 1920-23 
and leading the American League with 27 wins in 1921 and strikeouts the 
following year, when he won 24 games. Shocker was reacquired for Bullet 
Joe Bush, Milt Gaston and Joe Giard in December 1924. However, through 
42 games of the 1925 season, the Yankees struggled, falling to seventh 
place in the eight-team AL, 13 1⁄2 games out of first place.[34] Huggins 
made wholesale changes to the Yankees' lineup, as he replaced Ward at second 
base with Howard Shanks, catchers Steve O'Neill and Wally Schang with Benny 
Bengough, and, most notably, Pipp with Lou Gehrig at first base, beginning 
Gehrig's record consecutive games played streak. Among the team's regulars, 
only Babe Ruth, Joe Dugan, and Bob Meusel remained in the lineup.[34] However, 
the team continued to struggle; amid rumors that he might replace Huggins, 
Ruppert stated that "Miller Huggins will be manager as long as he cares 
to be".[35] The Yankees fell to seventh place in the AL that season.[23] 
With Ruppert's full support, Huggins' duties with the Yankees included 
keeping Ruth in line.[3][25] Unafraid of his star player, Huggins and Ruth 
often clashed.[36] Huggins suspended Ruth indefinitely on August 29, 1925 
for "misconduct off the playing field", while also fining him $5,000 ($67,581 
in current dollar terms).[37][38] Ruth responded by claiming Ruppert would 
rescind the fine and suspension, and that he would never play for Huggins 
again, believing that Ruppert would side with him over Huggins. However, 
Ruppert insisted that the fine would stand and that Ruth would be suspended 
for as long as Huggins desired.[25] After apologizing to Huggins and Ruppert,[39] 
Ruth was reinstated on September 5.[40] Ruth did not challenge Huggins' 
authority again.[25] "He was the only man who knew how to keep me in line." 
Huggins restructured the team for the 1926 season, giving starting jobs 
to Mark Koenig and Tony Lazzeri.[41] That season, Huggins won his fourth 
pennant with the Yankees in 1926,[10] marking the first time that a team 
won a pennant after finishing seventh the year prior.[23][42] However, 
the Yankees lost the 1926 World Series to the Cardinals in seven games. 
Winning the pennant once again in the 1927 season, Huggins matched Cap 
Anson's mark of five pennants in seven seasons.[43] That year, the Yankees 
benefited from the development of George Pipgras and Wilcy Moore,[23] and 
set an American League record with 110 regular season victories,[44] winning 
the AL by 19 games.[45] The Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 
1927 World Series. This team became known as Murderers' Row, and is considered 
the one of the greatest teams in baseball history.[45] Huggins remained 
confident in his team's ability to repeat as AL champions in 1928 season.[46][47] 
Huggins supplemented his team by acquiring Bill Dickey from the minor leagues.[48] 
He acquired Stan Coveleski, who was attempting to return to his peak years, 
but released him in August when the former star continued to struggle.[49] 
The Yankees reached the 1928 World Series, winning their sixth pennant 
in eight years,[20] and defeated the Cardinals 4 games to 0. This was the 
first time a team swept their opponents in consecutive World Series'.[50] 
Huggins continued to tinker with his roster during the offseason. He traded 
Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins,[20] and acquired Lyn Lary 
from the Pacific Coast League.[51] He tried Lary at third base and Leo 
Durocher at shortstop,[52] while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and 
Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases.[20] The Yankees fell behind 
the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and 
as it became clear that the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, 
Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about 
the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel in left field.[52] 
However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling 
ill.[50] Huggins fell ill on September 20, 1929, and checked into Saint 
Vincent's Catholic Medical Center for erysipelas. His condition was complicated 
by the development of influenza with high fever.[53][54] The Yankees' club 
physician, in consultation with other doctors, decided to administer blood 
transfusions.[53][55] But despite their best efforts, Huggins died at the 
age of 51 on September 25, 1929 of pyaemia.[53] The American League canceled 
its games for the following day out of respect,[56] and the viewing of 
his casket at Yankee Stadium drew thousands of tearful fans. A moment of 
silence was held for Huggins before the start of Game 4 of the 1929 World 
Series (at Philadelphia's Shibe Park, after which the A's overcame an 8-0 
Cub advantage with 10 runs in the last of the seventh for a spectacular 
10-8 come-from-behind victory and a 3-1 Series advantage).[57] He was interred 
in Spring Grove Cemetery in his native Cincinnati.[3] The Yankees found 
it difficult to replace Huggins. Art Fletcher managed the team for its 
final eleven games of the 1929 season, but he did not want to manage the 
team full-time. After the season, Ruppert offered the job in turn to Fletcher, 
Donie Bush and Eddie Collins, all of whom declined. Eventually, "Bob the 
Gob" Shawkey agreed to serve as the Yankees manager for the 1930 season, 
leading the team to a third-place finish.[52][58] Huggins was listed at 
5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m) and 140 pounds (64 kg).[2] His small stature inspired 
the nicknames "Mighty Mite" and the "Mite Manager".[59] He was also known 
as "Rabbit" and "Little Everywhere" for his ability to cover ground in 
the infield.[4] An excellent leadoff batter and defensive second baseman, 
he ended his playing career with a .265 batting average and .956 fielding 
percentage.[4] He led the league in walks four times and regularly posted 
an on-base percentage near .400. He scored 100 or more runs three times 
and regularly stole 30 or more bases for 324 lifetime steals. On the downside, 
in 1914 he set the single season caught-stealing record in the National 
League, when he was thrown out 36 times (as opposed to 32 successful steals).[60] 
Huggins finished his managerial career with a 1413–1134 record. His 1413 
wins as a manager ranks 23rd all-time (as of the start of the 2012 season).[61] 
He learned his managerial strategy by observing Hanlon and Bresnahan. His 
managerial style at first emphasized speed, base-stealing, hit- and-run 
plays and "slap" (i.e., contact) hitting, but the acquisition of superstar 
slugger Ruth dictated a change of emphasis towards power and not giving 
away outs.[26] For the slugging Yankees of the 1920s, he recruited power 
hitters and consistent (as opposed to brilliant) pitchers.[26] In 1915, 
umpire and sportswriter Billy Evans, writing about the scarcity of competent 
second basemen in baseball, listed Huggins, Collins, Pratt, Johnny Evers, 
and Nap Lajoie as the best in the game.[5] He later wrote that Huggins 
was "one of the greatest managers I have ever met".[62] Bill James ranked 
Huggins as the 37th best second baseman of all time in 2001 in his The 
New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.[56] The Yankees dedicated 
a monument to Huggins on May 30, 1932, placing it in front of the flagpole 
in center field at Yankee Stadium. Huggins was the first of many Yankees 
legends granted this honor, which eventually became "Monument Park", dedicated 
in 1976. The monument calls Huggins "A splendid character who made priceless 
contributions to baseball."[63] The Yankees also named a field at Al Lang 
Stadium, their spring training home, after Huggins.[50][64] Huggins was 
included on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937, 
1938, 1939, 1942, 1945, 1946, 1948, and 1950,[a] failing to receive the 
number of votes required for election on those occasions. The Veterans 
Committee elected Huggins to the Hall of Fame in February 1964,[25] and 
he was posthumously inducted that summer.[65] Huggins was a private man 
who kept to himself. He lived in Cincinnati during the winters while playing 
for the Reds and Cardinals,[2] but began to make St. Petersburg, Florida 
his winter home while managing the Yankees.[66] Huggins did not marry,[2] 
and lived with his sister while in Cincinnati.[3] Huggins invested in real 
estate holdings in Florida,[67] although he sold them in 1926 (three years 
before the stock market crash, fortunately for him) as they took too much 
of his time away from baseball.[68] He enjoyed playing golf and billiards
