The Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta is an annual motorboat and river festival 
held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The festival was founded 
in 1977[1] and is often host to an F1 ChampBoat Series race. The F1 race, 
originally held in 1982, was the first F1 power boat race held in the United 
States.[2] 2008 saw the return of F1 Power Boat racing at the Pittsburgh 
Regatta after a two-year hiatus following the 2005 festival.[2] The festival 
had been scheduled to coincide with the July 4th holiday, however 2016 
saw a return to the Regatta being held prior in early August, as it traditionally 
was prior to 2004.[3] The festival is the largest inland regatta in the 
United States,[4] drawing tens of thousands of fans along Allegheny River. 
The F1 race course consists of a 4-pin 1.25 (2Â km) course.[5] In 2008, 
the Pittsburgh regatta F1 ChampBoat race was nationally broadcast on the 
Speed Channel.[6] The Regatta is the annual continuation of the original 
speed boat and paddle wheeler races of the "Pittsburgh Welcome Week Regatta" 
held annually starting on May 21, 1949 and through the mid-1950s. The race 
corresponds to a three-day festival in downtown Pittsburgh consisting of 
variety of events including free concerts, food vendors, aerial competitions, 
various water sports, dragon boat races, and the July Fourth fireworks 
display for the City of Pittsburgh. Over 1.5 million people are estimated 
to have attended some aspect of the regatta events every year.[4] On August 
7, 1988, one of the Formula 1 boats went out of control and crashed into 
a crowd near Three Rivers Stadium. There were 24 injuries.[7] The accident 
was captured on live TV during the broadcast of a Pittsburgh Pirates and 
New York Mets baseball game from a blimp above the stadium. Held August 
11 & 12 and hosted the "Mid-America Sternwheeler Race" with finishing line 
being the Smithfield Street Bridge.[8][9] Place, boat number, pilot, team,
