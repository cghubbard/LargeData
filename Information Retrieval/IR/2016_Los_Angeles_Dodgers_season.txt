The 2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season was the 127th for the franchise in 
Major League Baseball, and their 59th season in Los Angeles, California. 
They began the season with a new manager in Dave Roberts. The Dodgers in 
2016 set a new Major League record for the most players placed on the disabled 
list in one season. On September 25, they clinched their fourth consecutive 
National League West division championship, the first team in the division 
ever to do so and defeated the Washington Nationals in five games in the 
Division Series. They were defeated by the Chicago Cubs in six games in 
the National League Championship Series. This was the 67th and final season 
for Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully. The Dodgers announced on October 
22, 2015 that Manager Don Mattingly would not be returning to the team 
for the 2016 season. In five seasons as manager, Mattingly had a record 
of 446–363, a .551 winning percentage (2nd best in Los Angeles Dodgers 
history) and guided the team to three straight National League West titles 
for the first time in franchise history.[1] On November 23, the team announced 
that former Dodger player Dave Roberts would become the new manager.[2] 
The Dodgers also announced a new coaching staff, with pitching coach Rick 
Honeycutt and catching instructor Steve Yeager as the only holdovers from 
Mattingly's staff. New hires included bench coach Bob Geren, hitting coach 
Turner Ward, assistant hitting coach Tim Hyers, third base coach Chris 
Woodward, first base coach George Lombard, bullpen coach Josh Bard and 
quality assurance coach Juan Castro.[3] Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully 
announced that the 2016 season would be his final season in the Dodgers 
broadcast booth. The season will be his record 67th season with the Dodgers, 
the longest tenure with one team by any sports announcer in history.[4] 
The Dodgers also announced that they had added Joe Davis to the broadcast 
crew. Davis was scheduled to work 50 road games on television alongside 
returning analysts Orel Hershiser and Nomar Garciaparra. Charley Steiner 
would continue to call the remaining road games on TV with Hershiser and 
Garciaparra, and team with Rick Monday for most radio broadcasts; Kevin 
Kennedy would again work on radio with Monday when Steiner is on TV.[5] 
On November 2, 2015, the day after the 2015 World Series, shortstop Jimmy 
Rollins, second baseman Howie Kendrick and starting pitcher Brett Anderson 
became free agents.[6] The next day, starting pitcher Zack Greinke exercised 
an opt out option on his contract, voiding the last three years of his 
contract and becoming a free agent.[7] Anderson accepted the Dodgers qualifying 
offer and remained with the team, though Greinke and Kendrick declined 
their offers.[8] Outfielders Justin Ruggiano[9] and Chris Heisey were outrighted 
to the minors and chose to become free agents in early November.[10] The 
team also declined the 2016 options on second baseman Chase Utley,[11] 
relief pitcher Joel Peralta,[12] and starting pitcher Bronson Arroyo, making 
them all free agents.[13] On December 2, the Dodgers chose not to tender 
2016 contracts to pitchers Juan Nicasio and Lisalverto Bonilla, making 
them both free agents.[14] The Dodgers traded pitcher Joe Wieland to the 
Seattle Mariners on January 12, 2016.[15] The same day, they traded relief 
pitcher Tyler Olson and infielder Ronald Torreyes to the New York Yankees 
for a pair of minor leaguers.[16] The Dodgers started adding to their roster 
on December 7, when they claimed two players off waivers, pitcher Danny 
Reynolds from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim[17] and outfielder Daniel 
Fields from the Milwaukee Brewers.[18] Chase Utley re-signed with the Dodgers 
on December 9, for a one-year, $7 million, contract.[19] Reynolds was designated 
for assignment on December 18 to make room for pitcher Tyler Olson who 
was acquired from the Seattle Mariners for cash considerations.[20] On 
December 16, 2015, the Dodgers acquired infielder Micah Johnson, pitcher 
Frankie Montas and outfielder Trayce Thompson in a three team trade that 
sent Todd Frazier to the Chicago White Sox and José Peraza, Brandon Dixon 
and Scott Schebler to the Cincinnati Reds.[21] On December 30, they signed 
left handed starter Scott Kazmir to a 3-year free agent contract.[22] On 
January 6, they designated Olson for assignment and re-signed starting 
pitcher Brandon Beachy to a $1.5 million incentive laden one-year deal.[23] 
On January 7, they signed right-handed starter Kenta Maeda, formerly of 
the Japanese Hiroshima Toyo Carp, to an eight-year contract.[24] On January 
19, they signed veteran right handed pitcher Joe Blanton to a one-year, 
$4 million, contract as a relief pitcher.[25] On February 4, they re-signed 
second baseman Howie Kendrick to a two-year, $20 million, contract.[26] 
On February 19, the day spring training started, they signed right handed 
relief pitcher Louis Coleman to a one-year, $725,000, free agent contract[27] 
and two days later they finalized their signing of Cuban pitcher Yaisel 
Sierra to a six-year, $30 million, contract.[28] Early in Spring Training, 
the Dodgers received word that starting pitcher Brett Anderson would require 
surgery to repair a bulging disc in his lower back, sidelining him for 
the first 3–4 months of the season[29] and that relief pitcher Josh Ravin 
broke his left arm in a traffic accident and was also out for a considerable 
amount of time.[30] First baseman Adrian Gonzalez took some time off from 
camp to play for Team Mexico in the World Baseball Classic qualifiers.[31] 
The injury bug continued to ravage the Dodgers rotation, with Mike Bolsinger 
suffering a strained oblique[32] and non roster pitcher Brandon Beachy 
came down with a case of elbow tendinitis that slowed his progress.[33] 
On March 22, it was revealed that outfielder Andre Ethier had a broken 
leg, as a result of fouling a ball off his shin, and he would be out 10–14 
weeks.[34] At the end of spring training, Ross Stripling, beat out Zach 
Lee and Carlos Frías for the fifth starter spot.[35] The Dodgers opening 
day roster included 10 players on the disabled list, the most in MLB since 
the stat started being tracked in 2002.[36] The Dodgers began the 2016 
season at Petco Park against the San Diego Padres on April 4. Clayton Kershaw 
made his sixth straight opening day start for the Dodgers and allowed only 
one hit in seven innings with nine strikeouts. The offense erupted as well, 
as the Dodgers started the season with a 15–0 rout. It was the best ever 
margin of victory in franchise history and also the first time they had 
won six straight opening day games. The 15 runs was one short of the franchise 
opening day record of 16 set against the Houston Astros in 1983.[37] Scott 
Kazmir made his Dodgers debut the following night, pitching six scoreless 
innings while also allowing only one hit, as the Dodgers, with a 3–0 victory, 
got back-to-back-shutouts to open a season for the first time since 1974.[38] 
The Dodgers finished the series out with a 7–0 win the next day, joining 
the 1963 Cardinals as the only MLB teams to open the season with three 
straight shutouts. Kenta Maeda made his major league debut with six scoreless 
innings and also hit a home run in his second at bat, the first Dodger 
pitcher to homer in his debut since Dan Bankhead in 1947. The Dodgers also 
set a new team record with 27 scoreless innings to start the season, surpassing 
the 23 innings mark set by the 1974 team.[39][40] The Dodgers traveled 
to AT&T Park for the next series against the San Francisco Giants. Behind 
Alex Wood they fell one inning short of the Cardinals season opening shutout 
streak of 32 when the Giants scored three in the fifth. The Dodger bullpen 
then allowed a bunch of runs, including a grand slam by Hunter Pence to 
pull away and the Giants won 12–6.[41] Ross Stripling made his major league 
debut in the second game of the series. He pitched a no-hitter for 7 1⁄3 
innings but was taken out of the game with a two run lead after walking 
a batter and reaching his 100th pitch. The relief pitcher, Chris Hatcher, 
gave up a two-run homer to the very next batter, Trevor Brown, to tie the 
game. Brandon Crawford hit a walk-off homer in the 10th as the Giants won 
3–2.[42] Kershaw pitched eight innings for the Dodgers in the following 
game, but allowed two solo homer and got a no-decision. The Dodgers came 
back to win the game on an RBI double by Charlie Culberson in the 10th 
inning, 3–2.[43] In the final game of the road trip, the Dodgers scored 
five runs in the top of the first but saw the lead quickly disappear as 
Scott Kazmir allowed three homers and six total runs in only four innings. 
He was the first Dodgers pitcher to allow three homers to the Giants at 
San Francisco since Ismael Valdez in 1997. A two-run double by Joe Panik 
off reliever J. P. Howell in the sixth put the Giants up and they won 9–6.[44] 
In the Dodgers home opener on April 12 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
Maeda pitched six more scoreless innings. He joined Karl Spooner (1954) 
and Kazuhisa Ishii (2002) as the only Dodgers to begin their career with 
two consecutive scoreless starts. The bullpen continued to struggle however, 
and the team lost the game, 4–2.[45] The Dodgers got seven innings from 
Wood in the next game and Kenley Jansen picked up a five out save as they 
won 3–1.[46] The Dodgers scored five runs in the seventh inning the next 
day to win 5–2.[47] Enrique Hernandez hit two home runs and the Dodgers, 
behind Kershaw, beat the Giants 7–3 on Jackie Robinson Day at Dodger Stadium.[48] 
However, in the next game, Johnny Cueto allowed only one run in 7 1⁄3 innings 
and the Giants bullpen withstood a late Dodger rally to win 4–3.[49] Kenta 
Maeda finally allowed a run in his next start, but only one as the Dodgers 
won the series with a 3–1 victory in the final game of the homestand. He 
became just the eighth Dodgers pitcher since 1913 to open his career with 
three straight quality starts.[50] The Dodgers went back on the road on 
April 19 to play a three-game series against the Atlanta Braves at Turner 
Field. Multi-hit games by Tyler Flowers and Jeff Francoeur led the Braves 
to a 8–1 rout in the opener.[51] Justin Turner's RBI double in the 10th 
inning gave the Dodgers the 5–3 win the following day.[52] Yasmani Grandal 
took his turn with a 10th inning RBI in the series finale as the team won 
2–1. Kershaw struck out 10 in eight innings in the game.[53] The team next 
traveled to Coors Field for a weekend series against the Colorado Rockies. 
A two-run triple by Brandon Barnes in the eighth inning gave the Rockies 
a 7–5 win on April 22.[54] Kenta Maeda allowed only three hits and struck 
out eight in 6 1⁄3 innings the following game as the Dodgers won 4–1. He 
was the first pitcher in modern baseball history to allow only one run 
over his first four starts.[55] In the series finale, the Dodgers jumped 
out to a quick 7–1 lead only for the Rockies to come back and take the 
lead in the late innings. Chase Utley's two-out double off Rockies closer 
Jake McGee in the ninth capped was part of five runs they scored that inning 
to win 12–10.[56] On April 25, the Dodgers returned home for a four-game 
series against former manager Don Mattingly and the Miami Marlins. Giancarlo 
Stanton hit a homer in the opener as the Marlins won 3–2.[57] He hit a 
three-run homer in the next game, capping a five-run sixth inning off Kershaw 
in a 6–3 comeback win for the Marlins.[58] Justin Nicolino pitched seven 
and one third shutout innings as the Marlins also won game three, 2–0.[59] 
The Dodgers were swept by the Marlins in a four-game series for the first 
time ever as Stanton homered again and they won 5–3.[60] A three-run homer 
by Matt Kemp in the eighth inning gave the Dodgers another loss, this time 
to the Padres, 5–1.[61] The Dodgers ended the month of April on a six-game 
losing streak, thanks to another 5–2 loss to the Padres on April 30.[62] 
Clayton Kershaw pitched a complete game, three-hit, 14 strikeout, shutout 
on May 1 to bring the losing streak to an end. He also drove in the only 
run in the 1–0 victory over the Padres with a third inning single.[63] 
The Dodgers began an interleague road trip on May 3 with a short two games 
series against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. Trayce Thompson had 
four RBI, including a two-run homer as the Dodgers won the opener 10–5.[64] 
The Rays took the second game, 8–5, thanks to a three-run homer by Steve 
Pearce.[65] Kevin Pillar hit his own three-run homer as the Dodgers next 
dropped the opener of a weekend series with the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers 
Centre, 5–2.[66] Kershaw struck out 10 batters without any walks in seven 
innings as the Dodgers won the next one, 6–2.[67] They wrapped up the road 
trip with a 4–2 win on May 8.[68] Curtis Granderson homered off the first 
pitch by Scott Kazmir on May 9, as the New York Mets went on to beat the 
Dodgers 4–2 at Dodger Stadium.[69] A pitchers duel between Alex Wood and 
Jacob deGrom the following day went the Dodgers way, 3–2, thanks to a walk-off 
home run by Trayce Thompson.[70] The Mets took the third game, 4–3, thanks 
to starting pitcher Noah Syndergaard. He pitched eight strong innings and 
also hit two home runs, driving in all the teams runs. Dodger starter Kenta 
Maeda became just the second Dodgers pitcher in history to allow multiple 
home runs in a game to pitchers, joining Doug McWeeny, who allowed homers 
to Erv Brame and Fred Fussell of the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 7, 1929 
at Ebbets Field.[71] The Dodgers won the next game, 5–0, behind another 
dominate Clayton Kershaw start. He struck out 13 while pitching a two-hit 
complete game shutout. He set a MLB record with five consecutive starts 
with at least 10 strikeouts and no more than one walk and a club record 
with five consecutive starts with at least 10 strikeouts.[72] Yasiel Puig 
was 3-for-five with a homer and 2 RBI and Ross Stripling picked up his 
first major league win as the Dodgers beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 8–4 
on May 13.[73] Scott Kazmir pitched 8 2⁄3 innings and struck out seven 
as the Dodgers won 5–3 the following day.[74] A pinch-hit RBI double by 
Yadier Molina helped the Cardinals beat up on the Dodgers bullpen and prevent 
the sweep, 5–2.[75] Albert Pujols and Mike Trout combined for five RBI 
as the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim beat the Dodgers 7–6 in the opener 
of the Freeway Series on May 16.[76] Kershaw struck out 11 in eight innings 
the next game in a 5–1 win.[77] The series moved to Angel Stadium for the 
next game and Trout led the Angels in a five-run fifth inning that spoiled 
the spot start by Mike Bolsinger and gave them the victory in an 8–1 rout.[78] 
Three more RBI and a homer by Trout the next day made it a 7–4 Angels victory 
in the final game of the series.[79] Melvin Upton, Jr. hit a two-run walk-off 
homer off Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen as the San Diego Padres won 7–6 
at Petco Park on May 20.[80] The following day, Chin-hui Tsao walked in 
the winning run in the bottom of the 11th as the Dodgers lost again, 3–2.[81] 
In the final game of the road trip, Yasiel Puig's two-run, bases loaded, 
single in the 17th inning led the Dodgers to a 9–5 win, snapping the losing 
streak. It was the longest game for the Dodgers since April 29, 2007, also 
against the Padres.[82] The Dodgers returned home for a three-game series 
against the Cincinnati Reds. Clayton Kershaw continued his strong start 
to the season, pitching a complete game two-hit shutout as the Dodgers 
won 1–0.[83] Kershaw was the first Dodger pitcher with three shutouts in 
a month since Tim Belcher in 1989 and the first to last seven or more innings 
in his first 10 starts of the year since Fernando Valenzuela in 1981.[84] 
The Dodgers, behind Bolsinger, handed the Reds their ninth straight loss, 
8–2 on May 24.[85] The Dodgers finished off the sweep of the Reds with 
a 3–1 win in the finale. Scott Kazmir struck out 12 in six innings, and 
combined with Reds starter Dan Straily, who struck out 11, they were the 
first regular season due to each strike out 11 or more batters at Dodger 
Stadium since Grant Jackson and Bill Singer on June 12, 1969.[86] The Dodgers 
promoted top prospect Julio Urías to make his major league debut as the 
starting pitcher against the New York Mets at Citi Field on May 27. At 
19 years of age, he was the youngest starting pitcher to debut in the Majors 
since Félix Hernández in the 2005 season and the youngest Dodgers starting 
pitcher to debut since 18 year old Rex Barney in the 1943 season.[87] He 
struggled in his debut, lasting only 2 2⁄3 innings while allowing three 
runs and walking four. The Dodgers rallies to tie the game in the top of 
the ninth on a three run double by Chase Utley only to see the Mets win, 
6-5, on a walk-off homer by Curtis Granderson.[88] Utley homered twice 
in the next game, including a grand slam, as the Dodgers routed the Mets 
9–1.[89] In the final game of the series, Kershaw was again on his game, 
striking out 10 in 7 2⁄3 innings though he received a no-decision after 
the Mets tied the game with an RBI triple by Granderson off relief pitcher 
Adam Liberatore in the eighth. The Dodgers won the game, 4–2, thanks to 
a bases loaded single by Adrian Gonzalez off Mets closer Jeurys Familia.[90] 
The team traveled to Wrigley Field on Memorial Day to play the Chicago 
Cubs, the team with the best record in the league. In the opener of the 
four game series, the Dodgers could only manage one hit and lost 2–0.[91] 
In the next game, it was the Cubs who only managed one-hit. The Dodgers, 
thanks to a three-run homer by Corey Seager won 5–0. Kazmir struck out 
seven batters in six innings.[92] Jon Lester beat the Dodgers by pitching 
a complete game in the Cubs to a 2–1 victory to start the month of June.[93] 
Julio Urías's second start of the season was a bit better than his first 
but he allowed three home runs, including back-to-back ones by Jason Heyward 
and Kris Bryant as the Cubs finished the series with a 7–2 win.[94] The 
Dodgers returned home to play the Atlanta Braves. Of the teams five hits 
in the game, four were home runs, including three from rookie Corey Seager 
as they won 4–2.[95] Clayton Kershaw pitched six shutout innings the next 
game as the Dodgers won 4–0. He improved his personal record to 8–1 but 
the six innings was his shortest outing of the season.[96] Seager hit two 
more home runs as the Dodgers doubled up the Braves, 12–6, to sweep the 
series.[97] Trevor Story hit a three-run home run and the Colorado Rockies 
pounded Mike Bolsinger and the Dodgers 6–1 in the start of the next three 
game series.[98] Trayce Thompson hit a walk-off homer with two outs in 
the bottom of the ninth as the Dodgers evened the series with a 4–3 win.[99] 
The Rockies took the following game, 1–0, thanks to an RBI single by Daniel 
Descalso off Kenta Maeda in the seventh inning.[100] They next traveled 
to AT&T Park for a series against the first place San Francisco Giants. 
In the opener, Kershaw had another strong game, allowing two runs and five 
hits in eight innings with 13 strikeouts. A solo homer by Justin Turner 
in the top of the ninth gave the Dodgers a 3–2 win.[101] Buster Posey hit 
a walk-off RBI single off of Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen the next day 
as the Giants won 5–4 in 10 innings.[102] Urías struck out seven in the 
next game, and only allowed two runs, but those were on a two-run homer 
by Brandon Belt in the 6th and that was all the Giants needed for a 2–1 
victory.[103] The Dodgers traveled to Chase Field for a road series against 
the Arizona Diamondbacks beginning on June 13. Former Dodger Zack Greinke 
struck out six over seven innings to beat his old team, 3–2.[104] The Dodgers 
had two homers from Joc Pederson and solo shots by Justin Turner and Chase 
Utley as they evened the series with a 7–4 win the next game.[105] A three-run 
homer by Scott Van Slyke accounted for all the Dodgers runs as the finished 
off the series with a 3–2 win. Kershaw struck out 11 in 7 1⁄3 innings to 
pick up his 10th win of the season.[106] Jonathan Villar hit a two-run 
homer off Pedro Báez in the ninth inning to give the Milwaukee Brewers 
a 8–6 win over the Dodgers on June 16 at Dodger Stadium.[107] Urías struck 
out eight in five innings in his next start the following day, and Justin 
Turner hit two home runs, including a walk-off shot in the 10th inning 
as the Dodgers won 3–2.[108] Mike Bolsinger had a poor start in the next 
game, allowing five runs and nine hits in only 2 2⁄3 innings but Turner 
hit a three-run home run as the Dodgers scored six in the third and won 
the game 10–6.[109] In the final game of the series, Kenta Maeda and Matt 
Garza engaged in a pitchers duel for six innings and the Dodgers won the 
game, 2–1, on a bases loaded walk by Tyler Thornburg in the bottom of the 
ninth.[110] Kershaw held the Washington Nationals to one run in seven innings, 
while striking out eight, and Kenley Jansen picked up his 162nd career 
save, breaking the franchise record previously held by Éric Gagné, in the 
4–1 win on June 20.[111] Yasmani Grandal hit a three-run home run in the 
eighth inning as the Dodgers came from behind for a 3–2 win the next day.[112] 
The Dodgers proceeded to sweep the Nations in the three game series as 
Yasiel Puig singled and scored on a three base error by outfielder Michael 
Taylor in the bottom of the ninth for a walk-off, come from behind, 4–3 
win.[113] The Dodgers traveled to Pittsburgh on June 24 to open a four-game 
series against the Pirates at PNC Park. Nick Tepesch was promoted from 
AAA to make a spot start and he allowed five runs on seven hits in only 
four innings to put the team in a hole they never recovered from. Corey 
Seager had four hits in the game but the Dodgers lost 8–6.[114] Kershaw 
allowed four runs in a game for the first time all season as his 10 start 
unbeaten streak came to an end with a 4–3 loss to the Pirates on June 26.[115] 
In the final game of the series, the Pirates jumped out to a four run lead 
in the first inning but the Dodgers came from behind to win 5–4 to avoid 
the sweep.[116] Urías picked up his first major league win on June 28 with 
a 6–5 victory over the Brewers at Miller Park.[117] Junior Guerra shut 
down the Dodgers bats the next say as rookie Brock Stewart had a rough 
debut, allowing five runs in the second inning as the Dodgers lost 7–0.[118] 
The Dodgers received some bad news as the month ended, with Kershaw heading 
to the disabled list due to a herniated disc in his back. Meanwhile, the 
team won the final game of the month, 8–1. Maeda allowed only one run on 
three hits in six innings and the Dodgers hit three home runs.[119] The 
Dodgers acquired Bud Norris from the Atlanta Braves and he was the starting 
pitcher on July 1 against the Colorado Rockies at Dodger Stadium. He struck 
out eight in six scoreless innings of the Dodgers 5–0 victory.[120] Scott 
Kazmir started the next game, striking out 10 in six innings as the Dodgers 
won 6–1.[121] The Dodgers finished off the sweep of the Rockies with a 
4–1 victory. Brandon McCarthy returned to the mound for the first time 
since undergoing Tommy John surgery in April 2015 and allowed only two 
hits in five scoreless innings with eight strikeouts.[122] A seventh inning 
triple by Corey Seager led the Dodgers come from behind 7–5 victory over 
the Baltimore Orioles on Independence Day.[123] A three-run homer by Manny 
Machado keyed the Orioles 4–1 win the next day.[124] The two teams combined 
for a Dodger stadium record 36 strikeouts on July 6 and Chase Utley had 
a career high six hits in the game (the first Dodger to do so since Shawn 
Green in 2002). A two-run double by Jonathan Schoop in the 14th inning 
gave the Orioles a 6–4 win.[125] Hyun-jin Ryu made his first start since 
2014 on July 7 against the San Diego Padres and allowed six runs in 4 2⁄3 
innings.[126] Yasmani Grandal hit three home runs on July 8 as the Dodgers 
won 10–6 over the Padres. He was the third catcher in history with five 
hits in a three-homer game (Victor Martinez in 2004 and Walker Cooper in 
1949) and the third Dodger catcher to ever have three homers in a game 
(Mike Piazza in 1996 and Roy Campanella in 1950).[127] McCarthy picked 
up his second win and the Dodgers bullpen pitched four scoreless innings 
in a 4–3 win the next game. Adam Liberatore set the Dodgers franchise record 
with his 24th consecutive scoreless appearance.[128] Kenta Maeda struck 
out a season high 13 batters in seven innings while Adrian Gonzalez homered 
and the Dodgers ended the first half of the season with a 3–1 win over 
the Padres on July 10.[129] Corey Seager and Kenley Jansen both participated 
in the All-Star Game on July 12 and Seager also took part in the Home Run 
Derby. After the break, the team took on the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase 
Field. Chris Taylor had six RBI and hit a grand slam for his first career 
homer in the Dodgers 13–7 win.[130] Jansen blew a save the next day and 
the Dodgers lost 2–1 in 12 innings.[131] Jake Lamb homered as the Diamondbacks 
won the series 6–5.[132] Chase Utley hit a leadoff homer and drove in 3 
runs as the Dodgers beat the Washington Nationals 8–4 at Nationals Park 
on July 19.[133] The next day, Bryce Harper hit his 20th homer of the season 
and the Nationals pounded the Dodgers 8–1.[134] Justin Turner hit two home 
runs as the Dodgers handed Stephen Strasburg his first loss of the season 
(after 13 wins), 6–3.[135] After a blown save by Jansen, the St. Louis 
Cardinals beat the Dodgers on a walk-off homer by Matt Adams in the 16th 
inning, 4–3 at Busch Stadium.[136] The Dodgers picked up the win the next 
game, 7–2.[137] They finished off the road trip with a 9–6 victory highlighted 
by a grand slam by Adrian Gonzalez in the 1st inning.[138] Bud Norris allowed 
only two runs in seven innings, out dueling Tampa Bay Rays starter Chris 
Archer in a 3–2 win at Dodger Stadium on July 26.[139] A two-run homer 
by Evan Longoria was the key blow as the Rays, behind Matt Moore won the 
next game, 3–1.[140] The Dodgers got into a wild game with the Diamondbacks 
on July 29, giving up seven runs in the top of the seventh inning and then 
answering back with five in the bottom of the inning, led by two-run homers 
by Joc Pederson and Chase Utley. They wound up winning 9–7.[141] The offense 
did not show up the next day and the Diamondbacks won 4–2.[142] Despite 
losing starter Bud Norris to an injury two batters into the next game, 
the Dodgers, thanks to homers by Grandal, Seager and Pederson, beat the 
Diamondbacks 14–3 to end the month of July.[143] The Dodgers began August 
by making a flurry of trades which sent a number of minor leaguers for 
outfielder Josh Reddick, starting pitcher Rich Hill and relievers Jesse 
Chavez and Josh Fields. These moves led to the surprise demotion of outfielder 
Yasiel Puig to the minors.[144] However, the new look team had trouble 
in the next series at Coors Field. In the opener, Carlos González was 3-for-5 
with two doubles and four RBI as the Colorado Rockies beat the Dodgers 
7–3.[145] Rookie Brock Stewart made his second spot start in the next game 
and was pounded, allowing four home runs and nine runs overall, in a 12–2 
loss.[146] They avoided the road sweep thanks to Kenta Maeda pitching 5 
2⁄3 solid innings for his 10th win, the 13th Dodger rookie pitcher with 
double digit wins. Corey Seager tied Hanley Ramírez for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers single-season record for home runs by a shortstop with his 19th 
in the 4–2 win.[147] Back home for a rare series against the Boston Red 
Sox, the Dodgers were shut out by knuckleball pitcher Steven Wright and 
lost 9–0.[148] Ross Stripling pitched five scoreless innings the next day 
in the Dodgers 3–0 win. Seager hit his 31st double of the season, passing 
Eric Karros for the Dodgers rookie record.[149] In the next game, rookie 
Rob Segedin had four RBI in his MLB debut to set a franchise record and 
Adrian Gonzalez hit his 300th career homer as the Dodgers took the series 
with an 8–5 win.[150] Seager hit two more home runs on August 8, passing 
Ramírez and putting him one behind the franchise record. Julio Urías allowed 
three runs in five innings as the Dodgers won 9–4 over the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[151] They won again the next day, 9–3,[152] but Freddy Galvis 
hit a three-run homer in the series finale as the Phillies won 6–2.[153] 
The Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Dodgers 5–1 on August 12, thanks to first 
inning homers by Andrew McCutchen and Jordy Mercer.[154] In the next game, 
seven Dodgers pitchers combined for 11 walks, the highest total by the 
Dodgers in a nine inning game since May 25, 2009 but Joc Pederson was 3 
for 5 with a double and a homer to lead the team to a 8–4 win.[155] Brett 
Anderson rejoined the Dodgers rotation on August 14, for the first time 
since suffering a back injury in spring training. He didn't last long, 
allowing two home runs and five runs in the first inning before being replaced. 
The Dodgers never caught up and lost 11–3 to the Pirates.[156] The Dodgers 
went on the road to Citizens Bank Park where Chase Utley had a good game 
against his former team, the Philadelphia Phillies. He hit two home runs, 
including a grand slam, in the Dodgers 15–5 rout.[157] Gonzalez hit two 
homers in the next game as the Dodgers won, 7–2.[158] Justin Turner hit 
a three-run homer in the next game but the Phillies came from behind, thanks 
to homers by Maikel Franco and Ryan Howard to win 5–4 and avoid the sweep.[159] 
Bud Norris returned from the disabled list to start the opener of a series 
against the Cincinnati Reds but lasted only 3 2⁄3 innings. Joey Votto hit 
a three run homer and relief pitcher Michael Lorenzen hit a two-run homer 
as the Reds won 9–2.[160] Brett Anderson made his second start of the season 
on August 20 and again was shelled, allowing six runs in three innings 
before leaving because of a blister. Brandon Finnegan allowed only one 
hit in seven innings and the Reds routed the Dodgers 11–1.[161] Julio Urías 
turned in his best start as a Dodger to that point in the next game, with 
six shutout innings, and the Dodgers won 4–0.[162] The Dodgers won a slugfest 
with the Reds on August 22, 18–9. They hit seven home runs in the game, 
including three by Adrian Gonzalez. It was the first time the visiting 
team at Great American Ballpark had hit seven in one game.[163] The Dodgers 
returned home on August 23 for a key divisional series against the San 
Francisco Giants. Corey Seager had three hits in four at bats and Andrew 
Toles and Rob Segedin homered as the Dodgers roughed up Madison Bumgarner 
in a 9–5 win.[164] The following day, Rich Hill made his Dodgers debut, 
three weeks after he was acquired in a trade, and pitched six shutout innings 
while Justin Turner's solo homer accounted for all the scoring in a 1–0 
win. Kenley Jansen tied Jim Brewer's franchise record for strikeouts by 
a reliever with the 604th of his career.[165] On August 25, Matt Moore 
came within one out of a no hitter when Corey Seager singled.. but he still 
beat the Dodgers 4–0.[166] Kris Bryant hit two home runs the next day as 
the Chicago Cubs beat the Dodgers, 6–4, in 10 innings.[167] Seager hit 
his 23rd home run of the season in the following game, setting the Dodgers 
single-season record for home runs by a shortstop. Julio Urías recovered 
from a rough first inning to pitch six solid frames as the Dodgers won 
3–2.[168] An error by the Cubs in the eighth inning led to the only run 
of the next game as the Dodgers won 1–0.[169] The Dodgers next traveled 
back to Coors Field to wrap up the month of August with a three-game series 
against the Rockies. The Dodgers bullpen imploded and they lost the opener 
8–1.[170] A rain out on August 30 forced the Dodgers and Rockies to play 
a day-night doubleheader the following day. In the opener, the Dodgers 
offense continued to struggle and they were routed again, 7–0. This was 
the first time the Rockies had shutout the Dodgers at home since August 
27, 2012.[171] In the second game, the Rockies scored five runs off of 
a shaky Bud Norris in the first inning but came back and won the game on 
a grand slam homer by Andrew Toles in the eighth inning, 10–8.[172] The 
Dodger had 13 hits on September 2 against the San Diego Padres, including

start by Ross Stripling, whose 66 pitched in five innings was the fewest 
by a winning Dodgers starter since Greg Maddux threw 47 pitches in six 
innings on September 27, 2008.[177] Puig homered again and Brock Stewart 
pitched five innings of one run ball as the Dodgers swept the Diamondbacks 
with a 3–1 win.[178] Clayton Kershaw rejoined the Dodgers rotation on September 
9 for the first time in two months, but only lasted three innings while 
allowing two runs. José Fernández struck out 14 in seven innings as the 
Miami Marlins beat the Dodgers 4–1 at Marlins Park.[179] Hill was perfect 
through seven innings in the next game, but manager Dave Roberts made the 
decision to pull him from the game and bring in reliever Joe Blanton. Blanton 
allowed a hit to Jeff Francoeur with two outs in the eighth. Joc Pederson 
hit two home runs and the Dodgers won 5–0.[180] José Ureña held the Dodgers 
to only four hits in 8 2⁄3 innings in the series finale as the Marlins

Hill finally allowed his first runs as a Dodger in the next game, as the 
Diamondbacks' Kyle Jensen took him deep in the second inning. A three-run 
homer by Mitch Haniger off reliever Louis Coleman put the game out of reach 
and the Dodgers lost 7–3 at Chase Field.[185] Kenta Maeda out dueled Greinke 
the next game and the Dodgers won 3–2.[186] Joc Pederson homered and the 
Dodgers won 6–2 the following day. Corey Seager set a new Los Angeles Dodgers 
record for hits by a rookie with 181.[187] In the final game of the roadtrip, 
the Dodgers fell behind 7–1 after five innings but came back to tie the 
game with a six run sixth inning before ultimately losing 10–9 in 12 innings.[188] 
The Dodgers returned home for their final homestand of the regular season. 
Kershaw and the San Francisco Giants' Madison Bumgarner engaged in a pitching 
duel in the opener, with the Dodgers winning 2–1 on a walk-off double by 
Adrian Gonzalez in the ninth.[189] In the following game, Johnny Cueto 
and three relievers shut down the Dodgers and Brandon Belt and Eduardo 
Núñez each hit solo homers in the 2–0 Giants win.[190] A three-run homer 
by Puig in the first inning of the third game of the series led to a 9–3 
rout by the Dodgers and a commanding six game lead in the division race.[191] 
Yasmani Grandal welcomed the Colorado Rockies to town by going four for 
four with two homers, including a grandslam in a 7–4 win.[192] Back-to-back 
homers by Joc Pederson and Andre Ethier led the Dodgers to a 5–2 win the 
next night.[193] Kershaw struck out six batters in seven scoreless innings 
and Josh Reddick hit a grand slam as the Dodgers rolled to a 14–1 rout 
over the Rockies on September 24.[194] The team clinched its fourth consecutive 
division title the following day, winning 4–3 on a walk-off home run by 
Charlie Culberson. The Dodgers became the first National League West team 
to achieve that feat.[195] The Dodgers began their final road trip of the 
season against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park. Hunter Renfroe homered 
twice, including a grand slam, and drove in all seven runs in the Padres 
7–1 victory.[196] Renfroe hit a two run homer the next day and the Padres 
won again, this time 6–5.[197] The Dodgers offense, led by Joc Pederson's 
three RBI, beat the Padres 9–4 in the final game of the series, to avoid 
a sweep.[198] The Dodgers traveled to AT&T Park to finish the regular season 
against the Giants, who scored seven runs in the sixth inning to take the 
opener, 9–3.[199] The Giants also won the next game, 3–0, ensuring that 
the Dodgers would begin the post-season on the road.[200] The Dodgers finished 
their regular season on October 2, with a 7–1 loss and a sweep at the hands 
of the Giants.[201] That would be the final broadcast in the career of 
longtime Dodger announcer Vin Scully.[202] The Dodgers faced the Washington 
Nationals in the Division Series. The series began on October 7 at Nationals 
Park in Washington, D.C.. Corey Seager homered in the first inning and 
Justin Turner launched a two-run homer in the third as the Dodgers jumped 
out to a 4–0 lead against Max Scherzer. Clayton Kershaw struggled through 
five innings but he and the Dodgers bullpen held on to give the Dodgers 
a 4–3 win in the game.[204] The second game of the series was scheduled 
for October 8, but the game was rained out and rescheduled for the next 
day.[205] In game two, a three-run home run by José Lobatón off of Rich 
Hill in the fourth inning erased the Dodgers early two run lead and the 
Nationals added a few more runs off the bullpen to even the series with 
a 5–2 win. The Dodgers left 12 runners on base, and only had one hit in 
nine at-bats with runners in scoring position.[206] In Game three, at Dodger 
Stadium, the Nationals scored four runs (two on a homer by Anthony Rendon) 
in the fourth inning off of Kenta Maeda and then blew the game open with 
four more runs off of Kenley Jansen in the ninth, en route to a 8–3 win.[207] 
Kershaw pitched in game four on short rest, for the fourth consecutive 
season. Adrian Gonzalez homered in the first to give the Dodgers the early 
lead. Kershaw struck out 11 in 6 2⁄3 innings but was replaced by relief 
pitchers with two outs in the seventh and the bases loaded. Pedro Báez 
hit the only batter he faced to force in a run and then Daniel Murphy had 
a two RBI single off of Luis Avilán to tie the score at 5. An RBI single 
by Chase Utley with two outs in the bottom of the eighth put the Dodgers 
back ahead and they won 6–5 to force a fifth and deciding game in the series.[208] 
In the fifth and final game of the series, at Nationals Park, Rich Hill 
on short rest struggled and didn't make it out of the third inning, but 
only gave up one run. Max Scherzer pitched well for the Nationals, holding 
the Dodgers scoreless for the first six innings. Joc Pederson hit a solo 
homer to lead off the seventh inning and tie the game. A two-out pinch-hit 
single by Carlos Ruiz off of Sammy Solis put the Dodgers ahead and Justin 
Turner's two-run triple extended it to 4–1. A two-run homer by pinch hitter 
Chris Heisey off Grant Dayton in the bottom of the inning made it 4–3 and 
the Dodgers brought in closer Kenley Jansen to get out of the inning. Jansen 
threw a career high 51 pitches in the game, working into the ninth inning. 
Kershaw came into the game in relief with one out in the ninth, two days 
after throwing 110 pitches in game four. He induced a pop up by Daniel 
Murphy and struck out Wilmer Difo to end the game and send the Dodgers 
to the Championship Series.[209] The Dodgers advanced to face the Chicago 
Cubs in the Championship Series. In the first game at Wrigley Field, the 
Cubs got to Dodgers starter Kenta Maeda early, scoring three runs in the 
first two innings to take a 3–0 lead. Jon Lester allowed only one run (a 
pinch hit home run by Andre Ethier) in his six innings. A bases loaded 
single by Adrian Gonzalez off Cubs closer Aroldis Chapman tied the game 
in the top of the eighth inning but the Cubs came back in the bottom of 
the inning. Miguel Montero hit a pinch hit grand slam off of Joe Blanton 
and Dexter Fowler followed it up with a solo homer of his own. The Cubs 
took game one 8–4.[210] The second game was a pitchers duel between Clayton 
Kershaw and Kyle Hendricks. Kershaw struck out six and only allowed two 
hits in seven scoreless innings while Hendricks allowed only three hits 
in 5 1⁄3 innings. Hendricks however allowed a solo homer to Adrian Gonzalez 
for the only score of the game. Kenley Jansen pitched the last two innings 
and retired all six batters he faced to preserve the Dodgers 1–0 win, to 
even the series. This was the first time the Dodgers had won a Championship 
Series game on the road since game five of the 1988 NLCS against the Mets.[211] 
In game three at Dodger Stadium, Rich Hill pitched six scoreless innings, 
Yasmani Grandal and Justin Turner homered off of Jake Arrieta and the Dodgers 
cruised to a 6–0 win.[212] Julio Urías started game four for the Dodgers, 
becoming the youngest pitcher to ever start a playoff game. Addison Russell 
and Anthony Rizzo both homered as the Cubs broke out with 13 hits in a 
10–2 rout. The Dodgers committed four errors in the game, more than in 
any game all season and the most in a playoff game since game four of the 
1974 NLCS.[213] In the next game, Lester allowed only one run in seven 
innings, Russell hit a go-ahead homer off Joe Blanton in the 6th and the 
Cubs tagged on more runs off the bullpen to pull ahead in the series with 
a 8–4 win.[214] Kershaw returned to the mound in game six at Wrigley Field 
but was not nearly as sharp as his previous outing. He allowed five runs 
in five innings, including solo homers by Rizzo and Willson Contreras. 
Hendricks started for the Cubs and pitched 7 1⁄3 scoreless innings as the 
Cubs won the series with a 5–0 and head to the World Series for the first 
time since 1945.[215] Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches List does
