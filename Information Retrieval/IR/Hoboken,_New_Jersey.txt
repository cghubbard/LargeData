Hoboken (/ˈhoʊboʊkən/ HO-bo-ken;[21] Unami: Hupokàn[22]) is a city in Hudson 
County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, 
the city's population was 50,005,[10][11][12] having grown by 11,428 (+29.6%) 
from 38,577 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 
5,180 (+15.5%) from the 33,397 in the 1990 Census.[23] Hoboken is part 
of the New York metropolitan area and is the site of Hoboken Terminal, 
a major transportation hub for the region. Hoboken was first settled as 
part of the Pavonia, New Netherland colony in the 17th century. During 
the early 19th century the city was developed by Colonel John Stevens, 
first as a resort and later as a residential neighborhood. It became a 
township in 1849 and was incorporated as a city in 1855. Hoboken is the 
location of the first recorded game of baseball (although this is disputed) 
and of the Stevens Institute of Technology, one of the oldest technological 
universities in the United States. Located on the Hudson Waterfront, the 
city was an integral part of the Port of New York and New Jersey and home 
to major industries for most of the 20th century. It is also well known 
for being the birthplace and hometown of American singer Frank Sinatra, 
one of the most popular and most influential musical artists of the 20th 
century, and there are parks and streets located in the city that are named 
for him. The character of the city has changed from a blue collar town 
to one of upscale shops and condominiums.[24] On October 29, 2012, Hoboken 
was devastated by the storm surge and high winds associated with Hurricane 
Sandy, leaving 1,700 homes flooded and causing $100 million in damage after 
the storm "filled up Hoboken like a bathtub". In June 2014, the United 
States Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated $230 million 
to Hoboken as part of its Rebuild by Design initiative, adding levees, 
parks, green roofs, retention basins and other infrastructure to help the 
low-lying riverfront city protect itself from ordinary flooding and build 
a network of features to help Hoboken survive storms that arrive once every 
500 years.[25] The name "Hoboken" was chosen by Colonel John Stevens when 
he bought land, on a part of which the city still sits. The Lenape (later 
called Delaware Indian) tribe of Native Americans referred to the area 
as the "land of the tobacco pipe", most likely to refer to the soapstone 
collected there to carve tobacco pipes, and used a phrase that became "Hopoghan 
Hackingh".[26][27][28] Like Weehawken, its neighbor to the north, Communipaw 
and Harsimus to the south, Hoboken had many variations in the folks-tongue. 
Hoebuck, old Dutch for high bluff and likely referring to Castle Point, 
was used during the colonial era and later spelled as Hobuck,[29] Hobock,[30] 
Hobuk[31] and Hoboocken.[32] The origin of Hoboken's name was not related 
to the Hoboken district of Antwerp. However, in the nineteenth century, 
a folk etymology had emerged linking the town of to the similarly-named 
Flemish town.[33] Today, Hoboken's unofficial nickname is the "Mile Square 
City",[1] but it actually covers about 1.25 square miles (3.2 km2) of land 
and an area of 2 square miles (5.2 km2) when including the under-water 
parts in the Hudson River.[2] During the late 19th/early 20th century the 
population and culture of Hoboken was dominated by German language speakers 
who sometimes called it "Little Bremen", many of whom are buried in Hoboken 
Cemetery, North Bergen.[34][35] Hoboken was originally an island, surrounded 
by the Hudson River on the east and tidal lands at the foot of the New 
Jersey Palisades on the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory 
of the Hackensack, a phratry of the Lenni Lenape, who used the serpentine 
rock found there to carve pipes. The first recorded European to lay claim 
to the area was Henry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East 
India Company, who anchored his ship the Halve Maen (Half Moon) at Weehawken 
Cove on October 2, 1609.[36] Soon after it became part of the province 
of New Netherland. In 1630, Michael Pauw, a burgemeester (mayor) of Amsterdam 
and a director of the Dutch West India Company, received a land grant as 
patroon on the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than 
fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named 
the North River. Three Lenape sold the land that was to become Hoboken 
(and part of Jersey City) for 80 fathoms (146 m) of wampum, 20 fathoms 
(37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle 
and half a barrel of beer.[36] These transactions, variously dated as July 
12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance 
for the area. Pauw (whose Latinized name is Pavonia) failed to settle the 
land, and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. 
It was later acquired by Hendrick Van Vorst, who leased part of the land 
to Aert Van Putten, a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known 
as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North America's 
first. In series of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was 
killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia (as the 
colony was known) were ordered back to New Amsterdam. Deteriorating relations 
with the Lenape, its isolation as an island, or relatively long distance 
from New Amsterdam may have discouraged more settlement. In 1664, the English 
took possession of New Amsterdam with little or no resistance, and in 1668 
they confirmed a previous land patent by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674–75 the 
area became part of East Jersey, and the province was divided into four 
administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part of Bergen County, where 
it remained until the creation of Hudson County on February 22, 1840. English-speaking 
settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, 
but it remained scarcely populated and agrarian. Eventually, the land came 
into the possession of William Bayard, who originally supported the revolutionary 
cause, but became a Loyalist Tory after the fall of New York in 1776 when 
the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the renamed 
Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of the Revolutionary 
War, Bayard's property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government 
of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as "William Bayard's farm at 
Hoebuck" was bought at auction by Colonel John Stevens for £18,360 (then 
$90,000).[36] In the early 19th century, Colonel John Stevens developed 
the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites. On October 11, 1811, Stevens' 
ship the Juliana, began to operate as a ferry between Manhattan and Hoboken, 
making it the world's first commercial steam ferry.[37] In 1825, he designed 
and built a steam locomotive capable of hauling several passenger cars 
at his estate. Sybil's Cave, a cave with a natural spring, was opened in 
1832 and visitors came to pay a penny for a glass of water from the cave 
which was said to have medicinal powers.[38] In 1841, the cave became a 
legend, when Edgar Allan Poe wrote "The Mystery of Marie Roget" about an 
event that took place there.[39] The cave was closed in the late 1880s 
after the water was found to be contaminated, and it was shut and in the 
1930s and filled with concrete, before it was reopened in 2008.[40] Before 
his death in 1838, Stevens founded the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, 
which laid out a regular system of streets, blocks and lots, constructed 
housing, and developed manufacturing sites. In general, the housing consisted 
of masonry row houses of three to five stories, some of which survive to 
the present day, as does the street grid.[41] Hoboken was originally formed 
as a township on April 9, 1849, from portions of North Bergen Township. 
As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken's residents 
saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held 
on March 29, 1855, ratified an Act of the New Jersey Legislature signed 
the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born.[42] In the subsequent 
election, Cornelius V. Clickener became Hoboken's first mayor. On March 
15, 1859, the Township of Weehawken was created from portions of Hoboken 
and North Bergen Township.[42] Based on a bequest from Edwin A. Stevens, 
Stevens Institute of Technology was founded at Castle Point in 1870 site 
of the Stevens family's former estate as the nation's first mechanical 
engineering college.[43] By the late 19th century, shipping lines were 
using Hoboken as a terminal port, and the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western 
Railroad (later the Erie Lackawanna Railroad) developed a railroad terminal 
at the waterfront, with the present NJ Transit terminal designed by architect 
Kenneth Murchison constructed in 1907.[44] It was also during this time 
that German immigrants, who had been settling in town during most of the 
century, became the predominant population group in the city, at least 
partially due to its being a major destination port of the Hamburg America 
Line, though anti-German sentiment during World War I led to a rapid decline 
in the German community.[45] In addition to the primary industry of shipbuilding, 
Hoboken became home to Keuffel and Esser's three-story factory and in 1884, 
to Tietjen and Lang Drydock (later Todd Shipyards). Well-known companies 
that developed a major presence in Hoboken after the turn-of the-century 
included Maxwell House, Lipton Tea, and Hostess. The first officially recorded 
game of baseball took place in Hoboken in 1846 between Knickerbocker Club 
and New York Nine at Elysian Fields.[46] In 1845, the Knickerbocker Club, 
which had been founded by Alexander Cartwright, began using Elysian Fields 
to play baseball due to the lack of suitable grounds on Manhattan.[47] 
Team members included players of the St George's Cricket Club, the brothers 
Harry and George Wright, and Henry Chadwick, the English-born journalist 
who coined the term "America's Pastime". By the 1850s, several Manhattan-based 
members of the National Association of Base Ball Players were using the 
grounds as their home field while St. George's continued to organize international 
matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. 
In 1859, George Parr's All England Eleven of professional cricketers played 
the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. 
Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated 
United States team—a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players 
to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket 
should become the national pastime after the game drawing the conclusion 
that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to 
develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional 
players. Harry Wright and George Wright then became two of the first professional 
baseball players in the United States when Aaron Champion raised funds 
to found the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869. In 1865 the grounds hosted 
a championship match between the Mutual Club of New York City and the Atlantic 
Club of Brooklyn that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured 
in the Currier & Ives lithograph "The American National Game of Base Ball".[48] 
With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences 
in Brooklyn, enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the 
prominence of Elysian Fields diminished. In 1868 the leading Manhattan 
club, Mutual, shifted its home games to the Union Grounds in Brooklyn. 
In 1880, the founders of the New York Metropolitans and New York Giants 
finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as 
the Polo Grounds. When the U.S. entered World War I, the Hamburg-American 
Line piers in Hoboken (and New Orleans) were taken under eminent domain.[49] 
Federal control of the port and anti-German sentiment led to part of the 
city being placed under martial law, and many German immigrants were forcibly 
moved to Ellis Island or left the city of their own accord.[50] Hoboken 
became the major point of embarkation and more than three million soldiers, 
known as "doughboys", passed through the city.[51] Their hope for an early 
return led to General Pershing's slogan, "Heaven, Hell or Hoboken... by 
Christmas."[52] Following the war, Italians, mostly stemming from the Adriatic 
port city of Molfetta, became the city's major ethnic group, with the Irish 
also having a strong presence.[53] While the city experienced the Great 
Depression, jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, 
and the tenements were full. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, 
also made their way to the city and established small businesses. The Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey, which was established on April 30, 
1921, oversaw the development of the Holland Tunnel (completed in 1927) 
and the Lincoln Tunnel (in 1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel 
between New Jersey and New York City, bypassing the waterfront. The war 
facilitated economic growth in Hoboken, as the many industries located 
in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, 
more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably, Todd Shipyards), 
offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service 
men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial 
ties chose to stay in town. During the 1950s, the economy was still driven 
by Todd Shipyards, Maxwell House,[54] Lipton Tea, Hostess and Bethlehem 
Steel and companies with big plants were still not inclined to invest in 
huge infrastructure elsewhere. Unions were powerful and the pay was good. 
By the 1960s, though, things began to deteriorate: turn-of-the century 
housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper 
overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing 
and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested 
urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline 
as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations 
shifted to larger facilities on Newark Bay, and the car, truck and plane 
displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in 
the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close-by 
ones in Bergen and Passaic Counties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken 
sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown 
condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities 
experiencing the same phenomenon, such as Paterson, Elizabeth, Camden, 
and neighboring Jersey City.[citation needed] The old economic underpinnings 
were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made 
to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River 
Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, 
and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and 
roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights.[55] Though the 
city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of 
immigrants, most notably Puerto Ricans, kept the storefronts open with 
small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn't 
much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called "the avenue", was 
never boarded up, and the tight-knit neighborhoods remained home to many 
who were still proud of their city. Stevens stayed a premiere technology 
school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed 
sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came 
back to the "old neighborhood" to shop for delicatessen. The waterfront 
defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from 
the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially 
industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production 
plants of Lipton Tea and Maxwell House, and the drydocks of Bethlehem Shipbuilding 
Corporation dominated the northern portion for many years. On June 30, 
1900, a large fire at the Norddeutscher Lloyd piers killed numerous people 
and caused almost $10 million in damage.[56][57] The southern portion (which 
had been a U.S. base of the Hamburg-American Line) was seized by the federal 
government under eminent domain at the outbreak of World War I, after which 
it became (with the rest of the Hudson County) a major East Coast cargo-shipping 
port. With the development of the Interstate Highway System and containerization 
shipping facilities (particularly at Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal), 
the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned.[36] 
A large swath of River Street, known as the Barbary Coast for its taverns 
and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, 
merchant mariners, and other seamen) was leveled as part of an urban renewal 
project. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the 
city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with the Port Authority gave 
it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated 
Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging 
in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, 
agreements were made with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 
various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers 
to build commercial and residential buildings and "open spaces" (mostly 
along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilized Pier A).[58] The 
northern portion, which had remained in private hands, has also been re-developed. 
While most of the dry-dock and production facilities[59][60] were razed 
to make way for mid-rise apartment houses, many sold as investment "condos", 
some buildings were renovated for adaptive re-use (notably the Tea Building, 
formerly home to Lipton Tea,[61] and the Machine Shop, home of the Hoboken 
Historic Museum).[62] Zoning requires that new construction follow the 
street grid and limits the height of new construction to retain the architectural 
character of the city and open sight-lines to the river. Downtown, Frank 
Sinatra Park and Sinatra Drive honor the man most consider to be Hoboken's 
most famous son, while uptown the name Maxwell recalls the factory with 
its smell of roasting coffee wafting over town and its huge neon "Good 
to the Last Drop" sign, so long a part of the landscape. The midtown section 
is dominated by the serpentine rock outcropping atop of which sits Stevens 
Institute of Technology (which also owns some, as yet, undeveloped land 
on the river). At the foot of the cliff is Sybil's Cave (where 19th century 
day-trippers once came to "take the waters" from a natural spring), long 
sealed shut, though plans for its restoration are in place. The promenade 
along the river bank is part of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway, a 
state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the Bayonne 
Bridge to George Washington Bridge and provide contiguous unhindered access 
to the water's edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive 
views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline. 
During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, 
fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-20th-century 
brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class 
population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors 
who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be 
tenements. Hoboken experienced a wave of fires, some of which were arson.[63][64] 
Applied Housing, a real-estate investment firm, used federal government 
incentives to renovate "sub-standard" housing and receive subsidized rental 
payments (commonly known as Section 8), which enabled some low-income, 
displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted 
artists, musicians, upwardly mobile commuters (known as yuppies), and "bohemian 
types" interested in the socioeconomic possibilities and challenges of 
a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken's residential, 
civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively 
(compared to Lower Manhattan) cheaper rents, and quick, train hop away. 
Maxwell's (a live music venue and restaurant) opened and Hoboken became 
a "hip" place to live. Amid this social upheaval, so-called "newcomers" 
displaced some of the "old-timers" in the eastern half of the city. This 
gentrification resembled that of parts of Brooklyn and downtown Jersey 
City and Manhattan's East Village, (and to a lesser degree, SoHo and TriBeCa, 
which previously had not been residential). The initial presence of artists 
and young people changed the perception of the place such that others who 
would not have considered moving there before perceived it as an interesting, 
safe, exciting, and eventually, desirable. The process continued as many 
suburbanites, transplanted Americans, internationals, and immigrants (most 
focused on opportunities in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan) began 
to make the "Jersey" side of the Hudson their home, and the "real-estate 
boom" of the era encouraged many to seek investment opportunities. Empty 
lots were built on, tenements became condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact 
of the destruction of the World Trade Center intensely, many of its newer 
residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on 
former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished 
low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light 
Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy, transit villages[65] are now 
being promoted. Once a blue collar town characterized by live poultry shops 
and drab taverns, it has since been transformed into a town filled with 
gourmet shops and luxury condominiums.[64] In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy 
caused widespread flooding in Hoboken, with half the city flooded.[66] 
In December 2013 Mayor Dawn Zimmer testified before a U.S. Senate Committee 
on the impact the storm had on Hoboken's businesses and residents,[67][68] 
and in January 2014 she stated that Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and 
Richard Constable, a member of governor Chris Christie's cabinet, deliberately 
held back Hurricane Sandy relief funds from the city in order to pressure 
her to approve a Christie ally's developmental project,[69][70] a charge 
that the Christie administration denied.[71][72][73] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 2.011 square miles (5.208 km2), 
including 1.275 square miles (3.303 km2) of land and 0.736 square miles 
(1.905 km2) of water (36.58%).[2][3] Hoboken lies on the west bank of the 
Hudson River between Weehawken and Union City to the north and Jersey City 
(the county seat) to the south and west.[74][75] Directly across the Hudson 
River are the Manhattan, New York City neighborhoods of West Village and 
Chelsea. Hoboken has 48 streets laid out in a grid. Many north-south streets 
were named for United States presidents (Washington, Adams, Madison, Monroe), 
though Clinton Street likely honors 19th century politician DeWitt Clinton.[citation 
needed] The numbered streets running east-west start two blocks north of 
Observer Highway with First Street, with the grid ending close to the city 
line with 16th near Weehawken Cove and the city.[75] Neighborhoods in Hoboken 
often have vague definitions making Downtown, Midtown, and Uptown subjective. 
Castle Point, The Projects, Hoboken Terminal, and Hudson Tea are distinct 
enclaves at the city's periphery. As it transforms from its previous industrial 
use to a residential district, the "Northwest" is a name being used for 
that part of the city.[76][77] Unincorporated communities, localities and 
place names located partially or completely within the city include Stevens 
Point.[78] Hoboken's ZIP code is 07030[16] and its area code is 201. The 
homelessness problem is addressed by the Hoboken Homeless Shelter, one 
of the three homeless shelters in the county.[91] At the 2010 United States 
Census, there were 50,005 people, 25,041 households, and 9,465 families 
residing in the city. The population density was 39,212.0 per square mile 
(15,139.8/km2). There were 26,855 housing units at an average density of 
21,058.7 per square mile (8,130.8/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 
82.24% (41,124) White, 3.53% (1,767) Black or African American, 0.15% (73) 
Native American, 7.12% (3,558) Asian, 0.03% (15) Pacific Islander, 4.29% 
(2,144) from other races, and 2.65% (1,324) from two or more races. Hispanics 
or Latinos of any race were 15.20% (7,602) of the population.[10] There 
were 25,041 households, of which 15.5% had children under the age of 18 
living with them, 28.8% were married couples living together, 6.9% had 
a female householder with no husband present, and 62.2% were non-families. 
39.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.8% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 1.93 and the average family size was 2.68.[10] In the city, 12.2% of 
the population were under the age of 18, 12.1% from 18 to 24, 55.9% from 
25 to 44, 13.5% from 45 to 64, and 6.3% who were 65 years of age or older. 
The median age was 31.2 years. For every 100 females there were 101.8 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.7 males.[10] The 
Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 
inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $101,782 (with 
a margin of error of +/- $3,219) and the median family income was $121,614 
(+/- $18,466). Males had a median income of $90,878 (+/- $6,412) versus 
$67,331 (+/- $3,710) for females. The per capita income for the city was 
$69,085 (+/- $3,335). About 9.6% of families and 11.0% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 20.7% of those under age 18 and 
24.4% of those age 65 or over.[92] As of the census of 2000, there were 
38,577 people, 19,418 households, and 6,835 families residing in the city. 
The population density was 30,239.2 inhabitants per square mile (11,636.5/km2), 
fourth highest in the nation after neighboring communities of Guttenberg, 
Union City and West New York.[93] There are 19,915 housing units at an 
average density of 15,610.7 per square mile (6,007.2/km2). The racial makeup 
of the city is 80.82% White, 4.26% African American, 0.16% Native American, 
4.31% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 7.63% from other races, and 2.78% 
from two or more races. Furthermore, 20.18% of the total residents also 
consider themselves to be Hispanic or Latino.[89][90] There are 19,418 
households out of which 11.4% have children under the age of 18 living 
with them, 23.8% are married couples living together, 9.0% have a female 
householder with no husband present, and 64.8% are non-families. 41.8% 
of all households are made up of individuals and 8.0% have someone living 
alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 1.92 
and the average family size is 2.73.[89][90] In the city the age distribution 
of the population shows 10.5% under the age of 18, 15.3% from 18 to 24, 
51.7% from 25 to 44, 13.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.0% who are 65 years of 
age or older. The median age is 30 years. For every 100 females, age 18 
and over, there are 103.9 males.[89][90] The median income for a household 
in the city as of the 2000 census was $62,550, while the median income 
for a family was $67,500. Males had a median income of $54,870 versus $46,826 
for females. The per capita income for the city was $43,195. 11.0% of the 
population and 10.0% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the 
total population, 23.6% of those under the age of 18 and 20.7% of those 
65 and older were living below the poverty line.[89][90] The city is a 
bedroom community of New York City, where most of its employed residents 
work. Based on the 2000 Census Worker Flow Files, about 53% of the employed 
residents of Hoboken (13,475 out of 25,306) work in one of the five boroughs 
of New York City, as opposed to about 15% working within Hoboken.[94] The 
first centrally air-conditioned public space in the United States was demonstrated 
at Hoboken Terminal.[95] The first Blimpie restaurant opened in 1964 at 
the corner of Seventh and Washington Streets.[96][97] Today, Hoboken is 
home to one of the headquarters of publisher John Wiley & Sons, which moved 
from Manhattan in 2002.[98] According to the New Jersey Department of Labor 
and Workforce Development, Hoboken's unemployment rate as of 2014 was 3.3%, 
compared to a 6.5% in Hudson County as a whole.[99] And a 2016 study by 
Fundera ranked Hoboken as the 2nd best city in New Jersey for entrepreneurs.[100] 
A 2014 study showed that Stevens Institute of Technology contributed $117 
million to Hoboken's economy in 2014, reflecting the university's nearly 
$100 million payroll for salaries and wages, as well as other goods and 
services acquired, construction and off-campus spending by students and 
visitors. The university is responsible for 1,285 full-time jobs.[101] 
The four parks were originally laid out within city street grid in the 
19th century were Church Square Park, Columbus Park, Elysian Park and Stevens 
Park. Four other parks that were developed later but fit into the street 
pattern are Gateway Park, Jackson Street Park, Legion Park and Madison 
Park. The Hudson River Waterfront Walkway is a state-mandated master plan 
to connect the municipalities from the Bayonne Bridge to the George Washington 
Bridge creating an 18-mile (29 km)-long urban linear park and provide contiguous 
unhindered access to the water's edge. By law, any development on the waterfront 
must provide a public promenade with a minimum width of 30 feet (9.1 m). 
To date, completed segments in Hoboken and the new parks and renovated 
piers that abut them are at Hoboken Terminal, Pier A, the promenade and 
bike path from Newark to 5th Streets, Frank Sinatra Park, Castle Point 
Park, Sinatra Drive to 12th to 14th Streets, New York Waterway Pier, 14th 
Street Pier, and 14th Street north to southern side of Weehawken Cove. 
Other segments of river-front held privately are not required to build 
a walkway until the land is re-developed. The Hoboken Parks Initiative 
is a municipal plan to create more public open spaces in the city using 
a variety of financing schemes including contributions from and zoning 
trade-offs with private developers, New Jersey State Green Acres funds, 
and other government grants. It is source of controversy with various civic 
groups and the city government. Among the proposed projects, the only one 
to that has yet materialized is at Maxwell Place, whose developer is obligated 
to build a public promenade on the river. The parks that are planned to 
be built are Hoboken Island, Pier C, 1600 Park Avenue, Hoboken Cove, 16th 
Street Pier, Green Belt Walkway and Upper West Side Park.[citation needed]

governed within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal 
Charter Law) under the mayor-council (Plan D) system of municipal government, 
implemented based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission

ends December 31, 2017.[4] Zimmer had been the city council president and 
first took office as mayor on July 31, 2009, after her predecessor, Peter 
Cammarano,[120] was arrested on allegations of corruption stemming from 
a decade-long FBI operation.[121] Zimmer, who lost a June 9, 2009, runoff 
election to Cammarano by 161 votes, served as acting mayor until winning 
a special election to fill the remainder of the term on November 3, 2009.

Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. The terminal is the origination/destination 
point for several modes of transportation and an important hub within the 
NY/NJ metropolitan region's public transit system. Partly due to car sharing 
services, the number of residents parking on Hoboken streets decreased 
from 2010 to 2015.[163] Hudson Bike Share, a bicycle sharing system operated 
by nextbike, opened in 2016.[164] NJ Transit's Main Line, Bergen County
