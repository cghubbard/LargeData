As Player As Manager John Christopher Vukovich (July 31, 1947 â€“ March 8, 
2007) was an American third baseman[1] and coach in Major League Baseball 
best known for his years of service with the Philadelphia Phillies.[2] 
He played in parts of ten seasons from 1970 to 1981 for the Phillies, Cincinnati 
Reds and Milwaukee Brewers. He was mainly used as a utility infielder capable 
of playing all four positions.[1] He is also known for recording the lowest 
career major league batting average (.161) of any non-pitcher with 500 
ABs or more. Vukovich was born in Sacramento, California and grew up in 
Sutter Creek, California. His father was the baseball coach for the local 
Amador High School. He was a backup for the 1975 Reds World Series-winning 
team, although he was traded back to the Phillies before the playoffs began, 
and also for the 1980 Phillies World Series-winning team.[1] He actually 
began the 1975 season as the Reds' starting third baseman,[1] but was benched 
in favor of Pete Rose so that the Reds could get outfielder George Foster's 
bat into the lineup every day.[citation needed] He batted above .200 only 
twice in his ten-year career, appearing in 277 games while batting .161 
with 6 home runs and 44 runs batted in, and had a .956 fielding percentage.[1] 
During his second period of playing with the Phillies, he became beloved 
to the fans even though he seldom appeared in games; he was seen as a blue-collar 
player and the ordinary fan respected his effort.[citation needed] After 
his playing career ended, he joined the Chicago Cubs as a coach, and in 
1986 he was manager for a day after Jim Frey was fired (he split that day's 
doubleheader). In 1987, he rejoined the Phillies, and after Lee Elia was 
fired with nine games to go, he took over as skipper, going 5-4 the rest 
of the season.[2] Vukovich stayed with the Phillies as a coach from 1988 
to 2004, and was considered for the managing job when Terry Francona was 
fired in 2000. The job eventually went to Vukovich's childhood friend, 
Larry Bowa.[2] Vukovich was diagnosed with a brain tumor early in the 2001 
season and subsequently had surgery. He would return later that season, 
and remained on the coaching staff until being named special assistant 
to the General Manager following the 2004 season. Along with Bowa and Milt 
Thompson, Vukovich is one of just three Phillies to go to the World Series 
as both a player and coach for the club. In late 2006, he again exhibited 
symptoms; he died at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia at age 59. 
The 2007 Phillies honored him by wearing a uniform patch on their right 
sleeve with his nickname, "Vuk".[3] The Phillies also publicly dedicated 
their 2007 regular baseball season to Vukovich.[citation needed] Vukovich 
was a resident of Voorhees Township, New Jersey.[4] Vukovich was inducted 
onto the Phillies Wall of Fame on August 10, 2007. Former Phillies stars 
including Mike Schmidt and Steve Carlton participated in a pregame ceremony
