Negro leagues Major League Baseball MLB Negro leagues Monford Merrill "Monte" 
Irvin (February 25, 1919 – January 11, 2016) was an American left fielder 
and right fielder in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball (MLB) 
who played with the Newark Eagles (1938–42, 46–48), New York Giants (1949–55) 
and Chicago Cubs (1956). He grew up in New Jersey and was a standout football 
player at Lincoln University. Irvin left Lincoln to spend several seasons 
in Negro league baseball. His career was interrupted by military service 
from 1943 to 1945. When he joined the New York Giants, Irvin became one 
of the earliest African-American MLB players. He played in two World Series 
for the Giants. When future Hall of Famer Willie Mays joined the Giants 
in 1951, Irvin was asked to mentor him. He was inducted into the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1973. After his playing career, Irvin was a baseball scout 
and held an administrative role with the MLB commissioner's office. At 
the time of his death, Irvin was the oldest living former Negro Leagues 
player, New York Giant and Chicago Cub. He lived in a retirement community 
in Houston prior to his death. Irvin was born February 25, 1919,[1] in 
Haleburg, Alabama, and was the eighth of 13 children. As a child, he moved 
with his family to Orange, New Jersey, one of five players who grew up 
in the Garden State to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. In high 
school, he starred in four sports and set a state record in the javelin 
throw. Irvin played baseball for the Orange Triangles, the local semiprofessional 
team, and he credited its coach with giving him an activity that helped 
him to stay out of trouble. He was offered a football scholarship to the 
University of Michigan, but he had to turn it down because he did not have 
enough money to move to Ann Arbor.[2] Irvin attended Lincoln University 
and was a star football player. However, he had disagreements with his 
coach and he found that he could not remain on his athletic scholarship 
and pursue predentistry studies. As his frustration mounted, Irvin began 
to be recruited by Negro league baseball teams.[2] Irvin played for the 
Newark Eagles of the Negro National League in 1938. Larry Doby, the first 
player to break the color barrier in the American League, was Irvin's double 
play partner with Newark at one time.[3] After hitting for high batting 
averages of .422 and .396 (1940–41), Irvin asked for a raise before the 
1942 season. When that was denied, he left the Negro leagues for the Mexican 
League, where he won a triple crown; he had a .397 batting average and 
20 home runs in 63 games.[4][5] Following the 1942 Mexican League season, 
Irvin was drafted into military service. Joining the army's GS Engineers, 
1313th Battalion, for the next three years, Irvin was deployed to England, 
France and Belgium, and he served in the Battle of the Bulge. Irvin said 
that while many black soldiers had been treated badly by their white counterparts, 
the situation improved for black soldiers as many white soldiers realized 
the contradiction in an oppressed group being sent to Europe to fight for 
the oppressed people in other countries. Irvin's military service left 
him with ringing in the ears, which affected his coordination.[6] After 
World War II, Irvin was approached by Brooklyn Dodgers executive Branch 
Rickey about being signed for the major leagues, but Irvin felt he was 
not ready to play at that level so soon after leaving the service.[7] The 
Newark Eagles business manager, Effa Manley, would not let Rickey sign 
Irvin without compensation. Rickey had already obtained Jackie Robinson 
without paying for his rights to his Negro league clubs. Said Irvin, Irvin 
earned MVP honors in the 1945–46 Puerto Rican Winter League. He returned 
to the Newark Eagles in 1946 to lead his team to a league pennant. Irvin 
won his second batting championship, hitting .401, and was instrumental 
in beating the Kansas City Monarchs in a seven-game Negro League World 
Series, batting .462 with three home runs. He was a five-time Negro League 
All-Star (1941, 1946–48, including two games in 1946). He spent the winter 
of 1948–49 in Cuba. In 1949, the New York Giants paid $5,000 for his contract. 
He was one of the first black players to be signed, as Jackie Robinson 
had only broken the MLB color line in 1947. Assigned to Jersey City of 
the International League, Irvin batted .373. He debuted with the Giants 
on July 8, 1949 as a pinch-hitter. Back with Jersey City in 1950, he was 
called up after hitting .510 with 10 HR in 18 games. Irvin batted .299 
for the Giants that season, playing first base and the outfield. In 1951, 
Irvin sparked the Giants' miraculous comeback to overtake the Dodgers in 
the pennant race, batting .312 with 24 homers and a league-best 121 runs 
batted in (RBI), en route to the World Series (he went 11–24 for .458). 
In the third game of the playoff between the Giants and Dodgers, Irvin 
popped out in the bottom of the ninth inning before Bobby Thomson hit the 
Shot Heard 'Round the World. That year Irvin teamed with Hank Thompson 
and Willie Mays to form the first all-black outfield in the majors. Later, 
he finished third in the NL's MVP voting. During that season, Giants manager 
Leo Durocher asked Irvin to serve as a mentor for Mays, who had been called 
up to the team in May. Mays later said, "In my time, when I was coming 
up, you had to have some kind of guidance. And Monte was like my brother... 
I couldn't go anywhere without him, especially on the road... It was just 
a treat to be around him. I didn't understand life in New York until I 
met Monte. He knew everything about what was going on and he protected 
me dearly."[9] Irvin later replied, "I did that for two years and in the 
third year he started showing me around."[9] Irvin was named to his only 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1952, despite having sustained a 
broken leg in April. He appeared in only 46 games that season, hitting 
.310 with four home runs and 21 RBI.[10][11] He hit .329 with 21 HR and 
97 RBI in 1953, finishing 15th in the league MVP voting. For the 1954 season, 
he hit .262 with 19 HR and 64 RBI.[11] The Giants won that year's World 
Series in four games, while Irvin collected two hits in nine at bats.[12] 
In 1955, Irvin had been sent down to the minor leagues, where he hit 14 
home runs in 75 games for the Minneapolis Millers. The Chicago Cubs signed 
him before the 1956 season. The team said that he would compete with Hank 
Sauer for a starting position in left field.[13] Irvin appeared in 111 
games for the Cubs that year, hitting .271 with 15 home runs.[11] A back 
injury led to Irvin's retirement as a player in 1957. He sustained the 
injury during spring training that year and only appeared in four minor 
league games for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League.[14] 
In his major league career, Irvin batted .293, with 99 home runs, 443 RBI, 
366 runs scored, 731 hits, 97 doubles, 31 triples, and 28 stolen bases, 
with 351 walks for a .383 on-base percentage, and 1187 total bases for 
a .475 slugging average in 764 games played.[11] Monte appeared on an episode 
of "To Tell The Truth" dated May 22, 1961. After retiring, Irvin worked 
as a representative for the Rheingold beer company,[15] and later as a 
scout for the New York Mets from 1967 to 1968. He was named an MLB public 
relations specialist for the commissioner's office under Bowie Kuhn in 
1968. The appointment made him the first black executive in professional 
baseball.[16] He was elected to the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1972.[17] The next year, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall 
of Fame, primarily on the basis of his play in the Negro leagues. In 1974, 
Kuhn was present in Cincinnati when Hank Aaron tied Babe Ruth's record 
of 714 career home runs. When the team came back to Atlanta, Kuhn sent 
Irvin in his place, so Kuhn was not present for Aaron's 715th home run. 
Even as late as 1980, Aaron was so angry at Kuhn that he did not attend 
an event where Kuhn was to present him with an award.[18] Irvin stepped 
down from his role with the commissioner when Kuhn announced his retirement 
in 1984.[19] He retired to Florida, but he accepted an MLB role involving 
special projects and appearances.[20] On June 26, 2010, the San Francisco 
Giants officially retired his number 20 uniform. He was joined by fellow 
Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal, Gaylord Perry 
and Orlando Cepeda in the pre-game ceremony.[21] He later joined those 
same Giants Hall of Famers in throwing out the ceremonial first pitch of 
Game 1 of 2010 World Series.[22] In 2015, he was presented a 2014 World 
Series ring by Giants executives and later joined the Giants in visiting 
the White House.[23][24] On January 11, 2016, Irvin died of natural causes 
in Houston at the age of 96.[25] At the time of his death, Irvin was the 
oldest living African American to have played in the major leagues, as 
well as the oldest living member of a World Series-winning team. Prior 
to his death, he lived in a retirement community in Houston.[26] He also 
served on the Veterans Committee of the Hall of Fame. The Giants will wear 
a patch in his memory for the 2016 season, a black circle with an orange 
outline with "Monte" on top of his number 20, to be worn on the left sleeve.[27] 
The first official statistics for the Negro leagues were compiled as part 
of a statistical study sponsored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
and supervised by Larry Lester and Dick Clark, in which a research team 
collected statistics from thousands of boxscores of league-sanctioned games.[28] 
The first results from this study were the statistics for Negro league 
Hall of Famers elected prior to 2006, which were published in Shades of 
Glory by Lawrence D. Hogan. These statistics include the official Negro
