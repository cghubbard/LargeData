The Miami Marlins are an American professional baseball team based in Miami, 
Florida. The Marlins compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member 
club of the National League (NL) East division. Their home park is Marlins 
Park. Though one of only two MLB franchises to have never won a division 
title (the other is the Colorado Rockies), the Marlins have won two World 
Series championships as a wild card team. The team began play in the 1993 
season as the Florida Marlins. They played home games from their inaugural 
season to the 2011 season at Hard Rock Stadium, which they shared with 
the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). Hard Rock Stadium 
was also called Joe Robbie Stadium, Pro Player Park, Pro Player Stadium, 
Dolphin Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Land Shark Stadium, and Sun Life Stadium 
during their tenancy. Since the 2012 season, they have played at Marlins 
Park in downtown Miami, on the site of the former Orange Bowl in Little 
Havana, Florida. The new park, unlike Sun Life Stadium (which was criticized 
in its baseball configuration for poor sight lines in some locations), 
was designed foremost as a baseball park. The new park's name is a temporary 
one until naming rights are purchased.[3][4] Per agreement with the city 
and Miami-Dade County (which owns the park), the Marlins officially changed 
their name to the "Miami Marlins" on November 11, 2011.[5] They also adopted 
a new logo, color scheme, and uniforms. The Marlins have the distinction 
of winning a World Series championship in both seasons they qualified for 
the postseason, doing so in 1997 and 2003 — both times as the National 
League wild card team. They defeated the American League (AL) champion 
Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series, which was notable for shortstop 
Édgar Rentería driving in second baseman Craig Counsell for the series-clinching 
run in the 11th inning of the seventh and deciding game. The 2003 season 
was notable for the firing of manager Jeff Torborg after 38 games. The 
Marlins were in last place in the NL East with a 16–22 record at the time. 
Torborg's successor, 72-year-old Jack McKeon, led them to the NL wild card 
berth in the postseason; they defeated the New York Yankees four games 
to two in the 2003 World Series. Wayne Huizenga, CEO of Blockbuster Entertainment 
Corporation, was awarded an expansion franchise in the National League 
(NL) for a $95 million expansion fee and the team began operations in 1993 
as the Florida Marlins. The Marlins would qualify for the postseason and 
win the World Series in both 1997 and 2003, though both titles were followed 
by controversial periods where the team sold off all the high priced players 
and rebuilt. The Marlins moved into their new ballpark, Marlins Park in 
2012, which coincided with a change in the team colors/uniforms and name 
to the Miami Marlins. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager

1993 until 2011, the Marlins had retired the number 5 in honor of Carl 
Barger, the first president of the Florida Marlins who died prior to the 
team's inaugural season. Barger's favorite player was Joe DiMaggio, thus 
the selection of number 5. With the move to the new ballpark, the team 
opted to honor Barger with a plaque.Logan Morrison, a Kansas City native 
and fan of Royals Hall-of-Famer George Brett (who wore that number with 
the Royals), became the first Marlin to wear the number.[6] After the death 
of pitcher José Fernández, his number 16 was officially retired. In a statement 
from Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria, "No one will ever wear #16 ever again 
in the Marlins franchise." [7] Andre Dawson2 Tony Pérez1 Mike Piazza3 Felo 
Ramírez Dave Van Horne The Marlins began construction of a new, state-of-the-art 
stadium at the Miami Orange Bowl site on July 18, 2009. The now approved 
stadium was the subject of a protracted legal battle. A lawsuit by local 
automobile franchise mogul and former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman 
Braman contested the legality of the deal with Miami-Dade County and the 
City of Miami. However, Miami-Dade County Judge Beth Cohen dismissed all 
the charges in Braman's lawsuit. The seating capacity for Marlins Park 
is 36,742, making it the third smallest stadium (in capacity) in the MLB. 
Its first regular season game was April 4, 2012, against the St. Louis 
Cardinals, the ballpark became only the sixth MLB stadium to have a retractable 
roof, joining Rogers Centre in Toronto (1989), Chase Field in Phoenix (1998), 
Safeco Field in Seattle (1999), Minute Maid Park in Houston (2000), and 
Miller Park in Milwaukee (2001). As part of the new stadium agreement, 
the team renamed itself the Miami Marlins on November 11, 2011 along with 
the unveiling of new uniforms and team logo in time for the move to the 
new stadium in 2012. Until a naming-rights deal is reached, the park will 
be known as Marlins Park. The Marlins' flagship radio station from their 
inception in 1993 through 2007 was WQAM 560 AM. Although the Marlins had 
plans to leave WQAM after 2006, they ultimately remained with WQAM for 
the 2007 season. On October 11, 2007, it was announced that the Marlins 
had entered into a partnership with WAXY 790 AM to broadcast all games 
for the 2008 season. Longtime Montreal Expo and current Marlins play-by-play 
radio announcer Dave Van Horne won the Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award 
for excellence in baseball broadcasting in 2010.[8] He shares the play-by-play 
duties with Glenn Geffner. Games are also broadcast in Spanish on Radio 
Mambi 710 AM. Felo Ramírez, who calls play-by-play on that station along 
with Luis Quintana, won the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 2005. Marlins games are televised by Fox Sports Florida. 
FS Florida's slogan in 2008 was "You Gotta Be Here." For the 2009 season 
the new slogan is "It's where you wanna be." There are no games available 
over-the-air, with the exception of games broadcast on Fox Saturday Baseball; 
the last "free TV" broadcast of a game was on WPXM-TV in 2005. Rich Waltz 
is the play-by-play announcer. In 1989, the release of popular movie Back 
to the Future Part II, had a reference to the Chicago Cubs defeating a 
baseball team from Miami in the 2015 World Series, ending the longest championship 
drought in all four of the major North American professional sports leagues.[9] 
The Marlins are the first team in Major League Baseball to have a dance/cheer 
team: "The Marlins Mermaids."[citation needed] Debuting in 2003, the "Marlins 
Mermaids" quickly gained national exposure, and have influenced other MLB 
teams to develop their own cheer/dance squads; this is inspired in part 
by similar squads from the NFL and NBA.[citation needed] In 2008, the Florida 
Marlins debuted "The Marlins Manatees", Major League Baseball's first ever 
all-male dance/energy squad to star alongside the Mermaids.[citation needed] 
As of 2012, the Marlins have abandoned the "Mermaids" and "Manatees" for 
in-game entertainment instead using an "energy squad", a co-ed group of 
dancers.[10] In June 2013, the book, "The Forgotten Marlins" A Tribute 
to the 1956–1960 Original Miami Marlins" was published. Its author is Sam 
Zygner (published by Scarecrow Press). In 2016, the Miami New Times reported 
that the team was involved in contract dispute lawsuits with both season 
ticket holders and vendors.[11] The following are the five best seasons 
in Marlins' history: The following are the five worst seasons in Marlins' 
history: Other than their first few years as a franchise in the 1990s, 
the Marlins have consistently ranked as one of lowest attendance teams 
in the league, coming in last place (30th) several of the past 20 years. 
Even when Marlins Park was completed for the 2012 season, attendance was 
only average for the first year, dropping down to second to last by 2013.
