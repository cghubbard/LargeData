The Lewis Flyers are the athletic teams that represent Lewis University, 
located in Romeoville, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), in NCAA Division

of the Great Lakes Valley Conference for all sports except men's volleyball, 
which is a member of the Division I Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Association. Since it is not a sponsored sport at the Division II level, 
the men's volleyball team is the only program that plays in Division I.

of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Men's
