The Saint Mary's Gaels are the athletic teams that compete at Saint Mary's 
College of California in Moraga, California.[2] The nickname applies to 
the college's intercollegiate NCAA Division I teams and to the school's 
club sports teams. Most varsity teams compete in the West Coast Conference.[3] 
From the Gaels website: "The Gaels are an ethno-linguistic group which 
spread from Ireland to Scotland and the Isle of Man. Their language is 
of the Gaelic (Goidelic) family, a division of Insular Celtic languages. 
The word in English was adopted in 1810 from Scottish Gaelic Gaidheal (compare 
Irish Gaedhealg and Old Irish Goídeleg) to designate a Highlander (OED). 
Gael or Goídeleg was first used as a collective term to describe people 
from Ireland; it is thought to have come from Welsh Gwyddel (Old Welsh 
Goídel), originally "raider", now "Irish person". Many people who do not 
speak Gaelic consider themselves to be 'Gaels' in a broader sense because 
of their ancestry and heritage." The nickname was given to the school's 
football team (now discontinued) in 1926 by Pat Frayne, a writer for the 
now defunct San Francisco Call-Bulletin.[4] The school's previous nickname 
was the Saints, although the baseball team was known as the Phoenix until 
the 1940s. Saint Mary's College of California sponsors teams in eight men's 
and eleven women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[5] Men's Intercollegiate Sports 
Women's Intercollegiate Sports The men's basketball team has become recognized 
nationally as one of the top mid-major programs in the country, appearing 
in five NCAA tournaments since 2005 and making appearances in both the 
Associated Press and ESPN Top 25 polls. The team received at-large bids 
to the NCAA tournament in 2005 and 2008 but lost in the first round. In 
2008-2009, the team got off to a strong start and at one time had the longest 
active winning streak in the nation before an injury to star guard Patty 
Mills, who was their leading scorer at the time. Mills came back in time 
for the West Coast Conference Tournament, but after a loss to Gonzaga in 
the WCC tournament finals, the team was not selected for the NCAA tournament. 
In March 2010, the Gaels received an automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA Tournament, 
after defeating Gonzaga in the championship game of the WCC Tournament, 
the Gaels' second WCC tournament title since 1987.[7] They then won their 
first NCAA Tournament game since 1959, defeating the Richmond Spiders. 
On March 20, 2010, the Gaels, led by Omar Samhan's 32 points, defeated 
#2 seed Villanova 75-68 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where they would 
fall to three seed and AP #19 Baylor to end their season 28–6. The Gaels 
shared the regular season WCC title with Gonzaga in 2011, but lost to Gonzaga 
in the WCC tournament and were not invited to the NCAA Tournament. In 2012, 
Saint Mary's claimed both the regular season WCC title and the tournament 
title and received a seven seed in the NCAA Tournament but lost to #10 
seed Purdue in the first round. The Gaels finished second in the WCC in 
the 2012-13 season and received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, 
defeating Middle Tennessee in a "First Four" matchup before losing in the 
second round to Memphis. During the 2012-13 season, the NCAA sanctioned 
the men's basketball program for recruiting violations stemming primarily 
from a former assistant coach and his attempts to recruit players from 
France. Penalties included a reduction in scholarships, four years probation 
and a five-game suspension for head coach Randy Bennett.[8] Past alumni 
from St. Mary's who current play in the NBA include Patty Mills and Matthew 
Dellavedova whose teams are both currently competing in the 2016 NBA playoffs.
