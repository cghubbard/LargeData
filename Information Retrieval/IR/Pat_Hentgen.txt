Patrick George Hentgen (born November 13, 1968) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher, and currently a special assistant to the Toronto Blue 
Jays organization. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Blue 
Jays, St. Louis Cardinals, and Baltimore Orioles. Hentgen was born in Detroit, 
and was offered a baseball scholarship to Western Michigan University, 
but signed with the Toronto Blue Jays instead after being drafted in the 
5th round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft.[1] He made his debut 
in 1991, and played a large part in the Blue Jays' World Series championship 
in 1993, winning 19 games in the regular season.[1] His best year, however, 
came in 1996 when he went 20â€“10 with a 3.22 ERA and 177 strikeouts to win 
the American League Cy Young Award.[1] Hentgen was an American League All-Star 
in 1993, 1994, and 1997. Hentgen was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in 1999 and played for the Baltimore Orioles from 2001 to 2003. He had 
Tommy John surgery in August 2001.[2] On November 18, 2003, Hentgen returned 
to the Blue Jays on a one-year free agent deal worth $2.2 million. However, 
he was unable to regain the consistency that had made him successful in 
the mid-90s, and on July 24, 2004, Hentgen announced his retirement from 
baseball.[3] Hentgen was noted for his success in challenging hitters directly, 
mostly throwing his fastball for strikes to get ahead early in the count. 
This would set up his curveball or high fastball to strike out the batter.[citation

as their new bullpen coach for the 2011 season.[4] It was Hentgen's first 
coaching assignment. He stepped down in November 2011 due to family reasons, 
and was given the title of Special Assistant to the Organization.[5] On 
December 10, 2012, Hentgen was again appointed as the Blue Jays bullpen 
coach.[6] On January 4, 2014, the Blue Jays announced that Bob Stanley 
would be replacing Hentgen as their bullpen coach. Hentgen continued to 
work with the Blue Jays, as a special assistant to the organization.[7][8] 
In 2016, Hentgen was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.
