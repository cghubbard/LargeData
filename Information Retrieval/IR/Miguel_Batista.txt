Miguel Descartes Batista Jerez (born February 19, 1971) is a Dominican 
former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball 
for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Florida Marlins, Chicago Cubs, Montreal Expos, 
Kansas City Royals, Arizona Diamondbacks, Toronto Blue Jays, Seattle Mariners, 
Washington Nationals, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets and Atlanta Braves. 
Over his career, Batista has played for eight teams and been utilized extensively 
as both a starter and a reliever. His best seasons came in 2001 and 2003 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks, when he went 11–8 and 10–9 with 3.36 and 
3.54 ERAs respectively. He signed a three-year $13.1-million contract with 
the Toronto Blue Jays prior to the 2004 season, but struggled in his first 
season with his new club, posting a 4.80 ERA and losing his starter's job 
late in the season. In 2005, Batista was the Jays closer and blew 8 saves. 
He was put on the trading block after the Blue Jays signed B. J. Ryan to 
a large contract to be their new closer. They traded Batista back to the 
Diamondbacks during the 2005 offseason along with Orlando Hudson for Troy 
Glaus and prospect Sergio Santos. Batista's 2006 record in Arizona was 
11–8 with an ERA of 4.58. After the season, the Diamondbacks offered Batista 
arbitration, as he was a free agent, but Arizona was not willing to commit 
to a multi-year deal; in December, Batista signed a three-year contract 
with the Seattle Mariners worth $24 million.[1] Batista had a solid first 
season with the Mariners, going 16–11 with a 4.29 ERA. During the offseason 
Batista pitches for the Aguilas Cibaeñas of the Dominican Winter League 
During 2008, he had the lowest percentage of quality starts in the majors, 
at 25%, and the fewest innings pitched per start, at 4.6.[1] He threw strikes 
in 57% of his pitches, the lowest rate in the majors.[2] In 2009, he was 
moved to a long relief role in the bullpen. On November 6, 2009, Batista 
declared free agency.[2] On September 2 2009 Batista was nominated for 
the Roberto Clemente Award. He was nominated because in the off-season 
he traveled throughout the United States and Latin America to deliver baseball 
equipment, medical supplies, and speak to kids of all ages to stress the 
importance of education and determination. Batista said this about being 
nominated for helping the less fortunate: On January 29, 2010, Batista 
agreed to a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals with an 
invite to spring training.[4] On July 27, 2010 Batista was called on to 
replace the injured Stephen Strasburg a mere 10 minutes before gametime. 
Surprisingly, Batista threw 5 shutout innings, allowing 3 hits and recording 
6 strikeouts. Following the game, in which he was booed twice for replacing 
much-touted Stephen Strasburg, Batista told reporters, "Imagine, if you 
go there to see Miss Universe — and you end up having Miss Iowa." When 
Miss Iowa USA Katherine Connors heard about the comment, she replied in 
a statement, "I know I can throw a pitch or two! The question is, can Miguel 
Batista walk the runway in a swimsuit?" Batista sent her flowers and she 
was invited to throw a ceremonial pitch at Nationals Park on 30 July 2010.[5][6] 
He later clarified his statement by saying, "People started booing me, 
and they hadn't seen me throw a pitch yet. It's like you hear 'Miss Iowa,' 
and you say, 'Iowa?' And then you see her up close and you say, 'Wow, she's 
gorgeous.'"[7] Batista has been invited to judge the 2011 Miss Iowa USA 
competition.[8] Batista finished the season with a 3.87 ERA and became 
a free agent. The St. Louis Cardinals announced Miguel Batista signed a 
minor league deal on January 14, 2011. In a spring training game, Batista 
hit Nationals shortstop Ian Desmond on the back. Later, when asked if the 
pitch hurt, Desmond replied, "Miggy throws like Miss Iowa. No big deal." 
[9] Batista made the opening day roster out of spring training. On Friday, 
April 22, with imminent severe weather moving into the area in the area 
and the increasingly likely threat of a rain delay at first pitch, the 
Cardinals opted to switch their starting pitcher for the game – calling 
on Batista to make his first start of the season in favor of scheduled 
starter Kyle McClellan. The rain began falling at the start of the game 
as predicted and the umpire crew opted for a rain delay. Two hours later 
the Cardinals were able to send their scheduled starter McClellan back 
to the mound while the opposing Cincinnati Reds had lost their starter.[10] 
The next day, this time after a 42-minute rain delay, the Cardinals again 
called on Batista – this time in relief in the 8th inning. After getting 
Ryan Hanigan to make the first out Batista ran into trouble. An error from 
third baseman David Freese put a man on 2nd with only one out. After striking 
out Brandon Phillips and intentionally walking Joey Votto, Batista hit 
Jonny Gomes with an 0–2 count to load the bases. He was then lifted in 
favor of lefty Trever Miller who would force home a run with a bases-loaded 
walk. Miller yielded to ex-closer Ryan Franklin who allowed a single by 
Miguel Cairo to plate two more runs and put Batista on the hook for the 
loss.[11] Despite taking the loss, according to the commentators, Batista 
became the first pitcher since 2005 to start in a game and then relieve 
in the next game. He was released on June 22, after recording a 4.90 ERA 
in 29 1/3 innings.[12] Batista signed a minor league contract with the 
New York Mets on July 4, 2011.[13] On August 28, 2011 the Mets selected 
his contract from Buffalo. He made his first start with the Mets on September 
1, 2011 and won his 100th career game. On September 28, 2011, the New York 
Mets' final game of the season, Batista started against the Cincinnati 
Reds and pitched a two-hit, complete-game shutout. On January 10, 2012, 
Batista resigned with the Mets to a minor league deal.[14] He was later 
added to the 40-man roster. After posting a 1-3 record with a 4.82 ERA, 
Batista was designated for assignment on July 22. He was released on July 
26.[15] On July 27, 2012, Batista signed a contract with the Atlanta Braves. 
On January 19, 2013, Batista signed a minor league contract with the Colorado 
Rockies.[16] He was released on March 25. On April 9, 2013, Batista signed 
a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays,[17] and was assigned 
to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons.[18] He was released by the Blue Jays on 
May 21.[19] Aside from being a baseball player, Batista is known for his 
love of poetry and philosophy, and he has written a book of poetry in Spanish 
titled Sentimientos en Blanco y Negro ("Feelings in Black and White"). 
Batista has also published The Avenger of Blood, a thriller about a serial 
killer. The novel was released on September 12, 2006 in the United States, 
and met with mixed reviews. It was released on January 25, 2006 in Santo 
Domingo, Dominican Republic and on February 10, 2006 in San Juan, Puerto
