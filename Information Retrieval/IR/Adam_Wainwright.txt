Adam Parrish Wainwright (born August 30, 1981) is an American professional 
baseball starting pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). The Atlanta Braves selected him 29th overall in the first round 
of the 2000 amateur draft from Glynn Academy in Brunswick, Georgia. His 
performance in the minor leagues brought him notice as one of the Braves' 
top pitching prospects. The Braves traded him to the Cardinals after the 
2003 season, receiving outfielder J. D. Drew in a deal which has since 
been considered lopsided in favor of the Cardinals. Wainwright made his 
MLB debut on September 11, 2005, against the New York Mets. As spending 
his first full MLB season as a relief pitcher, Wainwright briefly assumed 
closer duties, saving the series-clinching games of both the 2006 National 
League Championship Series and World Series. The next season, he returned 
to starting pitching, a role in which he has since remained, except for 
2011, which he missed due to Tommy John surgery. He emerged as an ace as 
he led the National League multiple times in wins, innings pitched, and 
games started. He also has multiple top-ten finishes in earned run average, 
strikeouts, walks plus hits per inning pitched, and complete games. In 
2014, he became the first pitcher in Major League history to post nine 
of his first 18 starts with seven innings pitched and no runs allowed. 
In his career, Wainwright has won more than 100 games, three All-Star selections, 
two Rawlings Gold Glove Awards and finished in the top three in the Cy 
Young Award balloting four times. With 1,473 strikeouts in his career to 
date, Wainwright is second to Bob Gibson (3,117)[1] in Cardinals franchise 
history in strikeouts. He runs a fantasy football league where the registration 
fees go to charity. He is currently signed through 2018. Wainwright was 
born in Brunswick, Georgia, to Bill, an attorney, and Nancy Wainwright, 
a real estate agent.[2] However, his parents divorced when he was seven 
years old and his father moved to Florida, leaving only Wainwright's mother 
to raise him and his older brother Trey, now also an attorney in Atlanta.[2][3] 
Wainwright credits Trey, seven years his senior, with teaching him everything 
he knows about sports after their father left, including building a pitcher's 
mound in their back yard to teach Adam how to pitch.[2][3] The young Wainwright 
also participated in the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and numerous church activities, 
and grew up a huge Braves fan.[2][3] Wainwright attended high school at 
Glynn Academy in his native Brunswick where he was an athletic and academic 
standout.[3] A multi-sport athlete, Wainwright also played football, in 
which he was named to the All-State team as a wide receiver his junior 
and senior years as well as All-Region honors as a placekicker.[2] With 
a fastball over 90 mph and batting average at times over .500, his future 
would lie in baseball, however, and Wainwright was named Gatorade Georgia 
Player of the Year in 2000.[2] He garnered considerable interest from colleges 
and universities offering both academic and baseball scholarships, including 
Georgia Tech.[3] When the Atlanta Braves selected him 29th overall in the 
first round of the 2000 MLB draft, Wainwright chose to forgo college to 
go straight to the pros, signing a contract that included a $1.25 million 
bonus. The Braves had been his favorite team growing up. Less than two 
weeks after high school graduation Wainwright reported to the Braves rookie 
team and soon advanced to Atlanta's Class A Danville Braves in the [Appalachian 
League]. He pitched for the Macon Braves in the South Atlantic League in 
2001 where he broke the team record for strikeouts, previously held by 
Bruce Chen, with 184.[2][4] Wainwright spent the 2002 season in the Carolina 
League and also participated in that season's All-Star Futures Game. In 
2003, Wainwright advanced to the Braves' Double-A club, Greenville.[2] 
He was Baseball America's top Braves prospect in 2003.[4][5] In December 
of that year, the St. Louis Cardinals acquired Wainwright with pitchers 
Jason Marquis and Ray King in a trade that sent outfielder J. D. Drew and 
utility player Eli Marrero to the Braves.[6] Wainwright pitched just 12 
games for the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds when he was shut down for nearly 
all the rest of the season with an elbow strain. There, he had a 4–4 won–loss 
record (W–L) with a 5.37 earned run average (ERA) in 63 2⁄3 innings pitched 
(IP). He struck out 64 and allowed 68 H and 28 BB. In the Arizona Fall 
League, he returned to pitch ten innings. The next season, he spent with 
Memphis, starting 29 games, completing 182 IP and allowing 204 hits, 51 
BB and striking out 147. His W–L record was 10–10. After two somewhat uneven 
seasons in the Cardinals' minor-league system, Wainwright made his MLB 
debut for St. Louis on September 11, 2005.[4][7] Wainwright made the Cardinals' 
Opening Day roster as a relief pitcher after having been a starter for 
his entire minor-league career. On May 24, 2006, he hit a home run on the 
first pitch he saw as batter in the major leagues against the San Francisco 
Giants' Noah Lowry; he became the 22nd batter in Major League history and 
11th National Leaguer to hit a home run off the first pitch thrown in his 
first at-bat.[8] Wainwright pitched capably as a middle reliever, but when 
incumbent closer Jason Isringhausen underwent season-ending hip surgery 
in September, Wainwright was pressed into service as the closer. He saved 
two crucial games on September 27 and September 30 as St. Louis held off 
Houston's late charge and won the NL Central Division championship. In 
spite of their unexceptional 83–78 regular-season record, the Cardinals 
rolled through October to win the 10th world championship in franchise 
history. As the new closer, Wainwright took center stage: Wainwright moved 
from the bullpen to the starting rotation for 2007. Shortly after losing 
ace Chris Carpenter for the year due to elbow surgery, Wainwright emerged 
as the Cardinals' most reliable starter. On August 10, he threw the first 
complete game of his career, a 2–1 loss to Los Angeles, and the only nine-inning 
complete game for the Cardinals that season. By September, Wainwright had 
established himself as the staff ace in Carpenter's absence, going 9–6 
with a 2.94 ERA from mid-May to the end of the season. He finished his 
first year by leading the club in almost every pitching category – games 
started, innings pitched, strikeouts, and wins – while compiling a 3.70 
ERA and a 14–12 record. His 14 wins were the most in franchise history 
for a first-year starter. His 2.71 ERA after the All-Star break was third-best 
in the NL.[9] In March, 2008, Wainwright signed a four-year deal with the 
Cardinals worth $21 million, with two club options for 2012 and 2013 that 
made the potential aggregate value $36 million.[10] He gave up four runs 
or less in each of his first seven starts. However, the Cardinals lost 
to the Brewers 8–3 in Wainwright's eighth start on May 13 as Ryan Braun 
hit two home runs off him.[11] He suffered a strain on the middle finger 
of his pitching hand in June, causing him to miss 2 1⁄2 months of the season. 
In 20 starts, he finished 11–3 with a 3.20 ERA.[12] On August 19, 2009, 
at Dodger Stadium, Wainwright pitched a no-hitter going against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers for 5 1⁄3 innings before Orlando Hudson broke it up with 
a clean single to left field. In his next start against the Astros, he 
pitched eight shutout innings to pick his then-major league-leading 15th 
win in a 1–0 victory. It was his 25th straight start with at least six 
innings pitched. In five August starts that season, he completed 35 2⁄3 
IP with just one walk and 22 SO.[13] On September 26, he pitched eight 
innings and struck out eleven for a 6–3, NL Central division-clinching 
victory against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field for his 19th win.[14] 
Wainwright finished with a 19–8 record and a 2.63 ERA, leading the National 
League in wins, games started (34), and innings pitched (233).[15] He also 
struck out a major-league high 140 batters on third-strike curveballs.[5] 
On October 28, he won the Players Choice Award as the NL Most Outstanding 
Pitcher.[16] He won his first Gold Glove Award on November 11, 2009.[17] 
He was a top contender for the Cy Young Award along with teammate Chris 
Carpenter and eventual winner Tim Lincecum. He became only the second pitcher 
ever – Trevor Hoffman was the first – to get the most first place votes 
and not win the award.[a][18] Pitching in his first All Star Game, Wainwright 
completed one inning. He faced five batters, throwing 17 pitches for ten 
strikes and seven balls, and allowed no runs with just one hit – a double 
off the glove of fellow Cardinal All-Star Matt Holliday – one walk, and 
two strikeouts.[19] In one eleven-game stretch preceding August 16, he 
compiled 66 a⁄3 IP in nine of those starts and allowed two earned runs 
for a 0.27 ERA.[20] Wainwright finished the 2010 season 20–11 with a 2.42 
ERA, five complete games, 213 strikeouts, 56 walks, 15 home runs allowed, 
and a WHIP of 1.05, in 230 1⁄3 IP. His win, strikeout, complete game and 
shutout totals were all career bests. His win total and ERA were both good 
for second place in the National League (behind only Josh Johnson's 2.30 
ERA, and Roy Halladay's 21 wins). He also pitched the first two shutouts 
of his career in 2010 – one against the Milwaukee Brewers on June 4 and 
a two-hitter against the Florida Marlins on August 6.[21][22] Wainwright 
was the runner-up for the 2010 NL Cy Young Award, finishing second in voting 
behind unanimous winner Halladay. Wainwright picked up 28 of 32 second-place 
votes. Near the end of the season, he had experienced elbow discomfort 
and nerve swelling. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan cleared him 
after the season.[23] Shortly after reporting to spring training, Wainwright 
experienced discomfort in his right elbow while pitching batting practice 
on February 21. Three days later, the Cardinals announced that Wainwright 
would miss the entire 2011 season – and possibly the first three months 
of the next season – after finding that ulnar collateral ligament damage 
necessitated Tommy John surgery (TJS). George Paletta, the team physician, 
performed the surgery on February 28 in St. Louis and it was deemed "a 
success."[24] Former clients for the same surgery included teammates Chris 
Carpenter, Jaime García, and Kyle McClellan.[25][26] Wainwright's contract 
featured options for 2012 and 2013 totaling $21 million with a provision 
that they would not automatically vest if he ended the 2011 season on the 
disabled list.[27] The Cardinals made the playoffs as a wild card entry, 
overtaking the Braves on the final day of the season.[28] They eventually 
won the World Series, defeating the Texas Rangers four games to three. 
The Cardinals awarded Wainwright his second World Series ring, in spite 
of not pitching the entire season. It was also the second ring he won even 
though he had yet to start in a World Series game.[29] Fully recovered 
after TJS and rehabilitation, Wainwright was ready ahead of schedule for 
spring training. Statistically, the 2012 season proved to be an overall 
disappointment season by Wainwright's standards, as he wound up 14–13 with 
a 3.94 ERA. However, it was encouraging in regards to the health of his 
right arm as he completed the entire season without any issues. In addition, 
pitchers recovering from TJS often find it challenging at first to throw 
with the same command as before the surgery, and thus to achieve post-surgery 
results equal to pre-surgery results. This was the case at first with Wainwright.[30] 
On May 22, he threw his first complete game shutout since August 6, 2010, 
and the third of his career in his ninth complete game. It was a four-hit, 
4–0 win at home against the San Diego Padres, striking out nine and walking 
only one.[31] He reached his 1,000th career inning on July 29.[32] The 
May 22 start marked a turning point in the season. During a 13-start stretch 
until August 3, he pitched 85 2⁄3 innings, striking out 83 while allowing 
just four home runs and 17 BB. He attributed the improvement to being able 
to sustain the usual finishing movement on his pitches through late innings, 
which earlier in the season, had eluded him, thus making his pitches easier 
to hit. He also corrected a subtle flaw that had developed on the grip 
of his curveball during a bullpen session prior to the start against San 
Diego. The flaw made it increasingly difficult to throw the curveball for 
consistent strikes.[33] On March 28, 2013, the Cardinals announced they 
and Wainwright had agreed to a five-year contract extension. At the time, 
he was under the last year of his previous contract, so the new deal extended 
him through 2018. With a total value of $97.5 million, it was the largest 
contract ever for a Cardinals pitcher.[34] On April 18, he became the first 
pitcher in baseball since 1900 to achieve 28 strikeouts and zero walks 
in his first four starts of a season.[35][36] Slim Sallee established the 
franchise record exactly one hundred years earlier by not issuing a walk 
in his first 40 innings.[37] Wainwright's streak ended in a start at Washington 
on April 23 after 34 2⁄3 innings and 133 batters faced.[38] The first MLB 
pitcher to post 10 wins on June 13, Wainwright put up seven scoreless innings 
in a 2–1 defeat of the Mets at Citi Field. Moreover, his strikeout of David 
Wright was his first of the game and the 1,000th of his career. He allowed 
six hits and struck out a total of four.[39] Wainwright became the NL Pitcher 
of the Month for June with a 4–2 record and 1.77 ERA. With 40 strikeouts 
for the month, Wainwright issued just six walks while holding opposing 
batters to a .220 average. Through that point in the season, he was 11–5 
with a 2.22 ERA, and was the MLB leader with four complete games and a 
9.5 strikeout-to-walk ratio.[40] In successive starts against the Reds 
in late August, Wainwright allowed 15 runs, both losses. He struck out 
eight in seven shutout innings on September 7 at home in a 5–0 win over 
the first-place Pirates in earning his 16th victory of the season. The 
Pirates, Reds, and Cardinals were all close contenders for the Central 
division title in September. The win gave the Cardinals first place over 
the Pirates by 1⁄2 game, and 1 1⁄2 games over the Reds.[41] Wainwright's 
seven strikeouts increased his career total to 1,103, passing Dizzy Dean 
(1,095) for second place among Cardinals' pitchers. Only Bob Gibson (3,117 
in 528 games) had more.[42] In a 60-inning stretch following the All-Star 
break Wainwright had walked 14, compared with 15 in 146 2⁄3 IP before the 
break.[43] When fellow starter Shelby Miller defeated Nationals' starter 
Jordan Zimmerman on September 26, he denied him his 20th victory.[44] Two 
days later, Wainwright, who was second in the league with 18 entering the 
game, defeated the Chicago Cubs in his final start of the season to tie 
Zimmerman for the lead in wins at 19. Wainwright also became just the third 
pitcher in franchise history to twice lead the league in wins, joining 
Dizzy Dean (1934–35) and Mort Cooper (1942–43).[45] He also led the NL 
in games started (34), innings pitched ( 241 2⁄3), hits allowed (223), 
and batters faced (956), and was third in strikeouts.[46] The Cardinals 
faced the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, and called upon Wainwright 
to start Game 1 against Jon Lester. It was Wainwright's first World Series 
appearance since 2006, and first start. He allowed five runs and St. Louis 
lost, 8–1.[46] In Game 5, a rematch against Lester, the Cardinals again 
lost, this time 3–1. Wainwright struck out 10 in seven innings, becoming 
the first Cardinal to reach double digits in strikeouts since Gibson against 
the Detroit Tigers in 1968.[47] After the Cardinals took a 2–1 Series lead, 
the Red Sox won the final three games to take the title.[48] Wainwright 
won his second Gold Glove award in 2013.[49] In the Cy Young balloting, 
Wainwright placed second, his second such ranking, and finished 23rd in 
the NL MVP voting.[50][51] Starting for the Cardinals against the Reds 
on Opening Day, March 31, 2014, Wainwright won his 100th career decision. 
In seven innings, he struck out nine and gave up just three singles in 
a 1–0 win. It was the first Opening Day win of his career while shutting 
out the Reds on Opening Day for the first time since 1953.[52] At Nationals 
Park against Washington on April 17, he pitched a two-hit shutout, winning 
8–0. He gave up the first hit in the second inning with a high infield 
chopper, but none after until two outs into the ninth. He walked three 
and struck out eight. It was his seventh career shutout.[53] In an April 
27 start against the Pirates, he tallied eight scoreless innings to extend 
a streak to 25 innings as the Cardinals won, 7–0, but was pulled before 
he could get a complete game due to concerns over his April 22 hyperextended 
right knee injury.[54] His streak of 25 scoreless innings ended in the 
first inning on May 2 in a loss against the Cubs, to whom he allowed six 
runs.[55] Arguably the finest game of Wainwright's career was his 195th 
start on May 20, a one-hitter against the Diamondbacks. He retired the 
first 11 batters before giving up a double to Paul Goldschmidt in the fourth 
inning. After the hit, he retired the final 16 batters consecutively, facing 
only 28, one over the minimum for a perfect game. He walked none and struck 
out nine, throwing 115 pitches, 86 for strikes. It was his seventh win 
of the year, tying for the National League lead and his 106th career victory 
against 59 losses. It also tied him for eighth place with Sallee on the 
all-time Cardinals' pitching win list and was his eighth career shutout.[56] 
He followed that effort with eight more scoreless innings on May 25. Between 
those two starts, he gave up just one walk and struck out a major-league-leading 
21 batters in 17 scoreless innings. He was named NL Co-Player of the Week 
with Dodgers starter Josh Beckett, who threw a no-hitter on May 25.[57][58] 
However, he missed his June 16 against the Mets due to elbow tendinitis, 
but an MRI showed no structural damage to the Tommy John surgically-repaired 
ligament.[59] After leading the NL with a 1.79 ERA and 11 wins through 
July 6, Wainwright was selected to his third All-Star Game at Target Field 
in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was selected as the NL's starting pitcher 
for the first time in his career.[60][61][62] Besides two starts in which 
he gave up seven runs to the Giants and six to the Cubs, he had allowed 
13 runs in 16 of his first 18 starts. Nine of those starts included totals 
with seven or more innings pitched and zero earned runs allowed. Per the 
Elias Sports Bureau (ESB), it was the first time in Major League history 
that any pitcher achieved that feat in his first eighteen starts of the 
season.[63] When the Cardinals defeated the Brewers 10–2 on July 12, Wainwright 
finished his pre-All Star break total with a 12–4 record and a 1.83 ERA. 
Further, he joined Hall of Fame member Steve Carlton as the only Cardinals 
to post an ERA less than 2.00 and at least 12 wins before the All-Star 
break (1969). In that game, Wainwright posted his major-league-leading 
15th start of the season with at least seven innings pitched and two or 
fewer runs allowed.[64] At the plate, his run batted in-single scored rookie 
Oscar Taveras for his 100th career hit.[65] In the All-Star Game, Wainwright 
incurred controversy over his remarks about facing leadoff hitter Derek 
Jeter. Jeter, who was retiring after the season, doubled on Wainwright's 
second pitch of the game. During interviews, he admitted that he gave Jeter 
an easy pitch to hit. "I was gonna give him a couple pipe shots. He deserved 
it", Wainwright said. "I didn’t know he was gonna hit a double or I might 
have changed my mind." Wainwright later recanted, stating that it was in 
humor, and that he was "not intentionally giving up hits out there."[66] 
Conversely, Jeter was appreciative. "He grooved them? The first one was 
a little cutter that he threw down and away. He probably assumed I was 
swinging. So he didn't groove the first one. The second was about 90, a 
two-seamer that stayed on a really good ... No, I don't know, man", he 
paused and smiled, drawing laughs from reporters. "I have no idea. If he 
grooved it, thank you. You still got to hit it."[67] Following the All-Star 
break, Wainwright temporarily struggled to keep the consistency of the 
first half of the season due to frequent elbow irritation. In June, he 
gave just four ER in 31 IP for a 1.16 ERA, and followed that up with a 
1.62 ERA in July. His results reversed in August when he allowed 22 ER 
in 38 1⁄3 IP for a 5.17 ERA. However, in September, he posted a 1.38 ERA 
in 39 IP with 29 SO and a 5–0 W–L.[68] He was subsequently named the NL 
Pitcher of the Month for September.[69] After the season, Wainwright had 
a procedure to remove part of the cartilage of the right elbow on October 
24. At times – commencing in June – he had altered his mechanics to mitigate 
the discomfort. In his third-to-last and second-to-last starts of the season 
– which were in the NLDS against the Dodgers and NLCS against the Giants 
– he was unable to complete five innings in both starts. This led to speculation 
Wainwright was pitching with pain, which he denied.[70] Through the 2014 
had a career 132 ERA+, third-highest for an active pitcher who has a minimum 
of 1,000 innings, and a .643 winning percentage, fourth-highest for active 
pitchers.[71][72] He finished third in the Cy Young voting for 2014, his 
third such placing, and fourth time he was positioned in the top three.[73] 
The Cardinals selected Wainwright to make his fourth career Opening Day 
start, and the season-opening game for MLB in 2015, in what was also the 
first-ever MLB Opening Night game. He was credited with the win as the 
Cardinals defeated the Cubs at Wrigley Field, 3–0.[74] On April 25, he 
left the game against the Brewers in the top of the fifth after suffering 
an ankle injury while batting. The next day, the Cardinals placed him on 
the 15-day disabled list,[75] and announced the following day that he had 
an Achilles tendon rupture and would likely miss the remainder of the season.[76] 
He underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon on April 30.[77] With 
a recovery initially expected to take nine to twelve months,[78] he had 
made four appearances through that point in the season, going 2–1 with 
a 1.44 ERA. As the season progressed, he consistently stated his goal was 
to return to pitching before the end of season. After working diligently 
to accelerate his recovery, the Cardinals announced on September 21 that 
he was cleared to resume baseball activities, two weeks prior to the conclusion 
of the regular season.[79] His actual recovery took five months.[78] Making 
his first appearance of the season since April, Wainwright pitched a scoreless 
inning of relief in the first game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh 
on September 30, an 8–2 loss. It was his first relief appearance since 
the 2006 World Series.[80] He was named the Hutch Award winner for 2015.[81] 
The Cardinals announced before spring training that Wainwright would be 
the Opening Day starter in 2016, his fifth time. For the three previous 
seasons, he had gone 41–19 with a 2.61 ERA.[82] For the second consecutive 
season, the Cardinals opened the MLB season, this time at PNC Park against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 3. The Cardinals lost the game, 4–1, with 
Wainwright taking the first loss of the season.[83] He hit his first home 
run of season in a 10–3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on May 2, also 
being credited with his second win.[84] In each of four consecutive plate 
appearances spanning April 27 to May 7, he became the first Cardinal pitcher 
since 1900 to garner an extra base hit while batting, per Elias Sports 
Bureau.[85] On the mound, he struggled early, yielding a 5.04 ERA in his 
first 16 starts of the season.[86] Wainwright pitched a three-hit, complete-game 
shutout and 5−0 win against Miami on July 15, 2016; the first hit he allowed 
was a double to Adeiny Hechavarria in the sixth inning.[87] With four RBI 
against Colorado on September 20, Wainwright increased his season total 
to 18, breaking the record for all pitchers in the designated hitter era 
– since 1973 – and the most since Ferguson Jenkins drove in 20 for the 
Cubs in 1971.[88] Notes: Through 2015 season. Per Baseball-Reference.com. 
Wainwright has a sinkerball, throwing it in the 90 to 92 miles per hour 
(145–148 km/h). He also throws a good deal of cutters 84 to 88 miles per 
hour (135–142 km/h) and curveballs 73 to 77 miles per hour (117–124 km/h) 
that has dropped more than 8 inches before from top to bottom of the pitch. 
Less commonly, he also throws a four-seam fastball 90 to 95 miles per hour 
(145–153 km/h) and a changeup 84 to 86 miles per hour (135–138 km/h). He 
uses all of his pitches against left-handed hitters, but he does not use 
the changeup against right-handers. Wainwright's most-used pitch in 2-strike 
counts is his curveball.[90] In spring training of 2013, he started incorporating 
an elevated four-seam fastball, making his curveball more effective.[38] 
A fantasy football enthusiast, Wainwright created and hosts a fantasy football 
network in eight cities called Big League Impact, designed to raised money 
for various charities. In 2015, the organization raised more than $1 million 
total. Other major leaguers including David Wright, Hunter Pence, and John 
Smoltz host in their respective cities.[91] The concept officially opened 
in July 2013 with the launch of a website called WainosWorld.com. In an 
interview with Fox Sports Midwest, Wainwright remarked that the program 
combined his love of fantasy football with his passion for helping the 
less fortunate. For a registration fee, all of which goes to charity, fans 
can assemble their own fantasy team and compete throughout the season against 
not only Wainwright but his current and former Cardinals teammates Allen 
Craig, David Freese, and Matt Holliday.[92] Those with the best team records 
at season's end will receive prizes.[93] The league raised $100,000 in 
2013 and supported Operation Food Search and Water Missions International.[94] 
With longtime aspirations to host an episode of Saturday Night Live, Wainwright 
made his film debut in the 2016 comedy-drama Proximity, directed by Dan 
Steadman and filmed in the St. Louis area. The majority of the work done 
was completed in 2015, after the opportunity presented to Wainwright due 
in part to the Achilles tendon injury he had suffered early in the season.[95][96] 
Wainwright married his high school sweetheart, Jenny Curry, in 2004.[3] 
In a quirk of fate, he was in the midst of proposing to Curry in December, 
2003, when a telephone call interrupted him to inform him he'd been traded 
from the Braves to the Cardinals.[2] Mrs. Wainwright holds a degree in 
interior design from Georgia Southern University. In the off-season, the 
Wainwrights reside on St. Simons Island, Georgia, with their three daughters, 
Baylie Grace (born September 10, 2006) Morgan Addison (born October 22, 
2008), and Macy (born November 7, 2011, days after the Cardinals won the 
World Series). Wainwright has openly expressed his Christian faith,[94][97]
