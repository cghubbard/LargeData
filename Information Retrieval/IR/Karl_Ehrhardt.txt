Karl Ehrhardt (November 26, 1924 â€“ February 5, 2008) was one of the New 
York Mets' most visible fans and an icon at Shea Stadium from its opening 
in 1964 through 1981. Known as the "Sign Man," Ehrhardt held up 20-by-26-inch 
black cardboard signs with sayings in big white (sometimes orange) upper-cased 
paper characters that reflected the Mets' performance on the field, and 
echoed the fans' sentiments off of it. He usually brought a portfolio holding 
about sixty of his 1,200 signs to the stadium, each of them with color-coded 
file tabs for different situations. He was always positioned in the field-level 
box seats on the third base side, wearing a black derby with a royal-blue-and-orange 
band around the bottom of the crown and the primary Mets logo on the front. 
Ehrhardt wasn't afraid to criticize the team's front office, once holding 
up a sign labelling Shea Stadium as "GRANT'S TOMB", referring to the team's 
miserable play and M. Donald Grant, the team's chairman of the board. Karl 
Kurt Ehrhardt was born in Unterweissbach, Germany.[1] He emigrated with 
his family to the United States at the age of six, settling in Brooklyn, 
New York where he grew up rooting for the hometown Dodgers. During World 
War II he served in the U.S. Army as a translator in a prisoner-of-war 
camp holding captured German soldiers. Following the war, he graduated 
from Pratt Institute with a degree in design art. He would later work as 
a commercial artist designing advertisements for American Home Foods. He 
was a resident of the Glen Oaks section of Queens in New York City.[1] 
Ehrhardt was once the subject of a feature by Heywood Hale Broun for a 
Saturday installment of the CBS Evening News in April 1969. This would 
be reshown on ESPN Classic in 2003 as part of an episode of Woodie's World
