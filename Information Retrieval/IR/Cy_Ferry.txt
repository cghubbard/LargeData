Alfred Joseph "Cy" Ferry (September 27, 1878 â€“ September 27, 1938) was 
a pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for two seasons. He pitched 
in three games for the Detroit Tigers during the 1904 Detroit Tigers season 
and in one game for the Cleveland Naps during the 1905 Cleveland Naps season. 
His brother, Jack Ferry, was also a major league pitcher.[1] A graduate 
of Manhattan College, Ferry began his professional career in 1899 with

Miler in 1901. He was promoted to the Buffalo Bisons the following year 
and had a 20-5 win-loss record in 31 games.[2] Ferry spent a second season
