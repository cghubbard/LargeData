As Player As Manager James Francis "Jimy" Williams (born October 4, 1943) 
is an American former professional baseball infielder, coach and manager 
in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was born in Santa Maria, California, 
and briefly appeared in two MLB seasons as a second baseman and shortstop 
for the St. Louis Cardinals. After his playing career, he managed in the 
California Angels' minor league system before managing at the MLB level 
for the Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox and Houston Astros, and was the 
American League Manager of the Year in 1999. He has also coached for Toronto, 
the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. Williams, a former infielder 
who threw and batted right-handed, graduated from Arroyo Grande, California, 
High School and Fresno State University. He signed originally with the 
Boston Red Sox and was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1965 Rule 
5 draft. He appeared in 14 games for the Cards over two seasons 1966–67, 
but had only 13 at bats, compiling a batting average of .231. Although 
he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds after the 1967 season, then selected 
in the 1968 expansion draft by the Montreal Expos, he never appeared in 
an MLB game for either club. The first pitcher Williams ever faced was 
Sandy Koufax. He got his first hit off another Hall of Famer: Juan Marichal.[1] 
His playing days cut short by a shoulder injury, Williams began his minor 
league managing career with the California Angels in 1974. He soon reached 
the Triple-A level and was appointed the third base coach of the Toronto 
Blue Jays in 1980. Williams remained as Toronto's third base coach for 
six seasons, until he was promoted to manager in 1986 when Bobby Cox left 
the organization to rejoin the Atlanta Braves. Williams was the Blue Jays' 
manager until the 1989 season, when he was fired May 14 and replaced by 
Cito Gaston after the team got off to a poor, 12–24 start. He finished 
with a record of 281 wins and 241 losses.[2] He spent 1991–96 with the 
Atlanta Braves as their third-base coach, working again under Bobby Cox, 
including the Braves 1995 World Series championship season. While with 
the Braves, Williams developed an outstanding reputation as a teaching 
coach, especially adept at working with infielders. From 1997 to 2001, 
Williams managed the Red Sox, leading them to wild-card playoff berths 
in 1998 and 1999. In 1999, the Red Sox reached the American League Championship 
Series, but lost to their arch-rivals, the New York Yankees, 4 games to 
1. Williams received the 1999 Major League Baseball Manager of the Year 
Award for the American League. Williams' relationship with general manager 
Dan Duquette soured, especially after Duquette publicly backed volatile 
outfielder Carl Everett after a September 2000 dispute with Williams.[citation 
needed] Red Sox fans routinely disparaged him on the Internet, using the 
epithet "Dumy."[citation needed] When the Red Sox — depleted by injuries 
— slumped in August 2001, Duquette fired Williams. The club then lost 27 
of 43 games under Duquette's appointee, Joe Kerrigan. Williams finished 
his tenure as Red Sox manager with a record of 414 wins and 352 losses.[2] 
In 2002, Williams became manager of the Houston Astros. While serving as 
a National League coach at the 2004 All-Star Game in Houston — at a time 
when the Astros were struggling at the .500 mark — the crowd at Houston's 
Minute Maid Park responded to the introduction of Williams with a decidedly 
mixed reaction,[citation needed] in contrast to the ovations generally 
given members of the home team who are introduced at an All-Star game. 
The following day, the Astros fired Williams and two principal coaches, 
having likely waited until after the festivities to avoid a public embarrassment.[citation 
needed] Williams was replaced by Phil Garner, who led the Astros to the 
2004 National League Championship Series but fell one game short of going 
to Houston's first ever World Series. (The following year, Garner led the 
Astros to the World Series.) Williams finished with a record of 215 wins 
and 197 losses.[2] On October 16, 2006, Williams was named the Philadelphia 
Phillies bench coach[3] and continued with that role through the Phillies 
2008 World Series championship season. Williams decided not to return to 
his position for the 2009 season. Then-Phillies manager Charlie Manuel 
said "As far as I know, it's not like that he left on a bad note."[4] Jimy 
Williams is not to be confused with James Bernard Williams (1926–2016), 
no relation, a Canadian former minor league outfielder and manager and 
MLB coach with the Astros and Baltimore Orioles. He is, however, a distant 
relative of Red Sox great Ted Williams, who was his staunch advocate when 
he managed in Boston. Two of Jimy Williams' sons are former professional 
baseball players who are now minor league managers. Brady was chosen by 
the Red Sox in the 45th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft and 
had a seven-year playing career as an infielder in minor league and independent 
league baseball. He has been a manager in the Tampa Bay Rays' system since 
2009 who in 2016 will spend his third year as skipper of the Montgomery 
Biscuits, the Rays' Double-A affiliate in the Southern League.[5] Shawn 
Williams also had a seven-year playing career (2006–12), including four 
years in the Tampa Bay organization; primarily an infielder, he played 
every position but center fielder. In 2016, he will return for a second 
year as skipper of the Lakewood BlueClaws, Class A affiliate of the Phillies 
in the South Atlantic League, Shawn Williams' third season as a manager
