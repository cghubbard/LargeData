Adrián Savin González[1] (born May 8, 1982), also known by his nicknames 
A-Gon and Gonzo,[2] is an American professional baseball first baseman 
for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was on the 
2016 Los Angeles Dodgers team that got eliminated in 6 games by the Chicago 
Cubs in the NLCS. González was the first overall pick in the 2000 Major 
League Baseball draft by the Florida Marlins. He was traded to the Texas 
Rangers, and later to the San Diego Padres, where he was an All-Star selection 
four times and two-time Gold Glove winner. The four-time Padres team Most 
Valuable Player (MVP) was traded to the Boston Red Sox before entering 
the final year of his contract during the 2010 offseason and traded again 
to the Dodgers in August 2012. González was born in the United States, 
but played with the Mexican national baseball team in the 2006, 2009 and 
2013 editions of the World Baseball Classic. Adrian Gonzalez was born in 
San Diego, California to David and Alba Gonzalez, both Mexican natives.[3] 
Gonzalez is the youngest of three boys; his brothers are David Jr. and 
Edgar, a former big leaguer.[4] After his birth, his parents moved the 
family to Tijuana, where his father owned an air-conditioner business.[3] 
The three boys grew up playing baseball in Mexico,[3] where their father 
had been a member of the Mexican national baseball team.[5] In 1990 the 
family returned to the United States, settling in Bonita, California.[5] 
While Adrian was drafted by the Florida Marlins out of high school, his 
brother Edgar attended San Diego State University and was selected by the 
Tampa Bay Rays in the 30th round of the 2000 draft.[5] Edgar debuted in 
the major leagues as a utility man with the San Diego Padres in 2008, joining 
his brother as a teammate.[5] In 2012 David and Alba Gonzalez were named 
2012 George and Barbara Bush Little League Parents of the Year.[4] In November 
2012, Adrian Gonzalez was honored as one of 30 "exemplary citizens" by 
the Mayor of Tijuana in an official ceremony.[3] Gonzalez was projected 
to be a late first-round pick out of Eastlake High School in Chula Vista, 
California, but he advanced with his senior year performance.[6] In June 
2000, Gonzalez became the first infield position player to be drafted first 
overall since Alex Rodriguez in 1993. He was given a $3 million signing 
bonus by the Florida Marlins.[7] While in the Marlins organization, Gonzalez 
played with the Gulf Coast League Marlins, Kane County Cougars, Utica Blue 
Sox, Portland Sea Dogs (2002),[8] Albuquerque Isotopes (2003), and Carolina 
Mudcats (2003). With the A level Kane County Cougars in his 2nd professional 
season, Gonzalez hit .312 with 17 home runs and 103 RBIs in 127 games. 
As a result, he was selected by the Midwest League as the Most Valuable 
Player & Top Prospect in the league. He also played in the All-Star Futures 
Game. After a wrist injury, the Marlins felt Gonzalez would be hindered 
swinging the bat, so the Marlins included Gonzalez in a June 2003 trade 
with the Texas Rangers, along with Ryan Snare and minor leaguer Will Smith, 
to acquire a relief pitcher, Ugueth Urbina, to aid their championship drive.[9] 
Gonzalez played with the Rangers' Class AA team, the Frisco Roughriders 
until he made his Major League debut against the Seattle Mariners on April 
18, 2004. He was hitless in 3 at-bats. He recorded his first base hit on 
April 20 against Ramón Ortiz of the Anaheim Angels and his first home run 
on April 25 off Kevin Jarvis of the Seattle Mariners. He played in 16 games 
for Texas in 2004 and in 43 games in 2005, with a combined batting average 
of .229 and 7 homers. After the season, Gonzalez was traded to the San 
Diego Padres along with pitcher Chris Young and outfielder Terrmel Sledge. 
In return, the Rangers received Adam Eaton and Akinori Otsuka. Originally 
seen as an eventual replacement for Ryan Klesko at first base, Gonzalez 
was given the job when Klesko underwent shoulder surgery. With extended 
playing time at first base in 2006, Gonzalez continued to improve his hitting 
and defense. On July 23, 2006, he was named the NL Player of the Week.[10] 
In his first full season, he led the Padres in batting average (.304) and 
home runs (24). He was the first player in Petco Park history to have more 
than one multiple home run game. He was named the Padres' MVP for 2006.[11] 
On March 31, 2007, Gonzalez agreed to a $9.5 million, four-year deal, with 
a club option for $5.5 million in 2011.[12] In the 2007 season, he led 
the Padres in home runs again, with 30, and had a team-high 100 RBIs. He 
led all Major League first basemen with 161 games and a career-high 46 
doubles.[11] In the 2008 season, Gonzalez finished with a .279 average 
and once again led the Padres with 36 HRs and 119 RBIs. He was elected 
to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game as a reserve. He went 1 for 3 with a single 
and a sacrifice fly, scoring Miguel Tejada of the Houston Astros. He won 
his first Gold Glove Award in 2008 at first base. Gonzalez set career highs 
in games played (162), home runs (36), RBI (119), runs scored (103), walks 
(74) and slugging percentage (.510). He was named the Padres MVP for the 
second time.[11] Gonzalez played winter ball in the Mexican Pacific League 
with the Venados de Mazatlán. In the 2009 Caribbean Series, he led his 
team past the Dominican Republic's Tigres del Licey with a record-setting 
3 home runs on February 4.[13] Gonzalez hit 23 homers and led Major League 
Baseball in that category at the end of May 2009. This despite playing 
his home games at Petco Park, which Padres statisticians describe as an 
"extreme pitcher's park."[14] On May 18, Gonzalez was described as being 
one of the two most underrated players in the National League according 
to a poll of Major League executives and managers conducted by MLB.com.[14] 
On April 1, Gonzalez was named the NL Co-Player of the Week for the second 
time in his career. During that week, Gonzalez hit four home runs, tallied 
10 RBIs, and had a 1.000 slugging percentage.[15] Gonzalez was elected 
to the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game after voting by fellow 
players, managers and coaches.[16] He subsequently participated in that 
year's Home Run Derby where he hit two home runs in the first round. On 
August 1, Gonzalez finished 6-for-6 with three RBI as the Padres topped 
the Milwaukee Brewers 13–6. Gonzalez's six hits are the most by any Padre 
in a nine-inning game. Three others have accomplished the feat, but did 
it in extra-inning contests. Gonzalez hit five singles and a double. He 
led the majors in walks in 2009, with 119,[17] while hitting 40 home runs 
for the first time in his career. He was named the Padres team MVP for 
2009, his third time honored.[11] Gonzalez started the 2010 season playing 
well. On May 24, he was named the NL Player of the Week for the fourth 
time in his career.[18] On June 2, Gonzalez hit a walk-off grand slam in 
extra innings to lead his team toward a 5–1 victory over the New York Mets.[19] 
In July, Gonzalez was elected to participate in his third consecutive All-Star 
game. During the 2010 season, Gonzalez had 176 hits in 591 at-bats, good 
for a .298 batting average, his highest since hitting .304 in his rookie 
season (2006). He had 93 walks and 114 strikeouts. His 93 walks put him 
in third place in the NL behind only Prince Fielder (114) and Albert Pujols 
(103). He finished with 31 home runs and 101 RBI, the third time in his 
career he had 100 RBI or more. Gonzalez played in 160 games on the year, 
tying him with Rickie Weeks for 5th in the NL. He scored 87 runs on the 
season, compiling 302 total bases, which also tied him with Weeks, for 
6th in the NL. Gonzalez was named team MVP for the third consecutive year 
and the fourth time overall with the Padres.[20] On December 6, 2010, Gonzalez 
was traded to the Boston Red Sox for a package of right-handed pitcher 
Casey Kelly, first baseman Anthony Rizzo, outfielder Reymond Fuentes, and 
a player to be named later, later determined to be Eric Patterson.[21][22] 
On April 15, 2011, Gonzalez and the Red Sox agreed to a seven-year contract 
extension worth $154 million through the 2018 season.[23] On June 19, 2011, 
Gonzalez hit his 1,000 career hit: a triple off of Milwaukee Brewers pitcher 
Yovani Gallardo.[24] On July 3, 2011, Adrian Gonzalez was selected to represent 
the Red Sox at the 2011 All Star game in Arizona along with teammates Josh 
Beckett, Jacoby Ellsbury, David Ortiz, Kevin Youkilis, and Jon Lester. 
Gonzalez hit a home run in the game and was responsible for the only run 
for the American League. Additionally, Ortiz selected Gonzalez as one of 
three sluggers to join him in the Home Run Derby, where he finished second 
to Robinson Canó. Gonzalez tied a record for most home runs in the final 
round of the home run derby at 11, which was then surpassed by the victor 
Cano. Gonzalez was named AL Player of the Month for June 2011 with a .401 
average (40 for 99) – the best in the Majors for that month.[25] After 
placing second in the 2011 Home Run Derby, Adrian Gonzalez faced a home-run 
slump until he hit five home runs in ten at-bats on August 23–25. He appeared 
on the cover of baseball video game MLB 12: The Show.[26] On November 21, 
the AL MVP ballots came out, with Adrian in seventh place and his teammate 
Ellsbury in 2nd, both losing to Detroit Tigers ace Justin Verlander. In 
2012, Gonzalez appeared in 123 games with the Red Sox, hitting .300 with 
15 homers and 86 RBI. On August 25, 2012, Gonzalez was traded to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers (along with Josh Beckett, Carl Crawford, and Nick Punto) 
and $11 million in cash for James Loney, Iván DeJesús, Jr., Allen Webster 
and two players to be named later (Jerry Sands and Rubby De La Rosa).[27] 
In his first at bat with the Dodgers that same day, he hit a three-run 
home run against the Miami Marlins.[28] In 36 games with the Dodgers, he 
hit .297 with 3 homers and 22 RBI. In the 2013 season, Gonzalez appeared 
in 157 games for the Dodgers and hit .293 with 22 home runs and 100 RBI. 
He was a candidate for the final vote at the 2013 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game but did not get selected to the game. In the 2013 NLCS Game 
5 against the St. Louis Cardinals, Gonzalez went 3 for 4 with 2 home runs. 
The Dodgers would eventually lose the series in six games. Gonzalez finished 
the 2014 season with 116 RBI, the most in all of Major League Baseball. 
He was the Dodgers' nominee for the Hank Aaron Award, after hitting 27 
home runs in 159 games. However, his batting average of .276 was the lowest 
of his career. He finished up the season by winning the Silver Slugger 
Award as the best hitting first baseman in the NL and also won several 
awards for his defense at first base, including the Gold Glove Award, Fielding 
Bible Award and Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award. Gonzalez opened 
the 2015 season with five home runs in the first three games of the season, 
including three on April 8 against Andrew Cashner. He was the first MLB 
player to hit five home runs in the first three games of the season.[29] 
By homering in his fifth consecutive game, dating back to the end of the 
2014 season, he tied the team record, which he shares with Roy Campanella 
(1950), Shawn Green (2001), Matt Kemp (2010), and Joc Pederson (2015).[30] 
He won the player of the week honors as a result of that performance.[31] 
He was also awarded with the National League player of the month award 
for April as he hit .383 with eight home runs and 19 RBI in the month.[32] 
He recorded his 1,000th career RBI when he hit a two run home run off Julio 
Teherán of the Atlanta Braves on May 26.[33] Gonzalez was selected to the 
2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the first Dodger first baseman 
selected since Nomar Garciaparra in 2006.[34] He finished the 2015 season 
by hitting .275 in 156 games with 28 home runs and 90 RBI, the lowest RBI 
total he had since 2006.[35] Gonzalez played for the Mexico national baseball 
team in the World Baseball Classic qualifiers during spring training in 
March 2016. The team was managed by his brother Edgar.[36] On June 22, 
2016 during a game against the Washington Nationals, Gonzalez made a highlight-reel 
catch after a foul ball deflected off Chase Utley's glove and off Gonzalez's 
leg. [37] On August, 7, 2016 Gonzalez hit his 300th career home run against 
the Boston Red Sox.[38] On the season he appeared in 156 games, with a 
.285 batting average, 18 homers and 90 RBI. It was the least amount of 
homers he had hit in a season since he became a full-time player in 2006.[39] 
Gonzalez and his wife Betsy reside in the San Diego County community of 
La Jolla.[40] They have two daughters.[41] The couple created The Adrian 
and Betsy Gonzalez Foundation, which is focused on empowering underprivileged 
youth in areas of athletics, education and health.[42] As one of his charitable 
endeavors, Gonzalez paid for the refurbishing of the baseball field in 
the Tijuana sports complex where he played as a youth.[3] Gonzalez is a 
Christian and engraved on his bats is "PS 27:1" for verse 1 from Psalm 
27.[43] Gonzalez has spoken about his faith saying, "I don't want to be 
remembered in baseball. I want to be remembered as a good witness for Christ. 
... I’m just trying to use this platform to bring people to Christ."[44]
