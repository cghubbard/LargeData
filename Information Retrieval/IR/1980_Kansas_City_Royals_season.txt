The 1980 Kansas City Royals season was a season in American baseball. The 
Royals finished first in the American League West with a record of 97 wins 
and 65 losses. They went on to sweep the New York Yankees in the ALCS, 
then lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1980 World Series, four games 
to two. One of the highlights of the season was George Brett winning the 
American League batting title. Brett's .390 batting average was the highest 
in the majors since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941. On September 30, while 
pitching for the Seattle Mariners against the Royals, Rick Honeycutt taped 
a thumbtack to his finger to cut the ball. Royals baserunner Willie Wilson 
spotted the tack from second base. The umpires investigated and not only 
found the tack, but also a gash in Honeycutt's forehead. Honeycutt was 
ejected from the game, suspended for 10 games, and fined.[2] [1] [2] [3]
