Tanner Joe Meyer (born May 10, 1962 in Honolulu, Hawaii) is a former Major 
League Baseball player. He played two seasons in the majors, 1988 and 1989, 
for the Milwaukee Brewers. He also played one season in Japan for the Yokohama 
Taiyo Whales in 1990. Drafted by the Brewers in the 5th round of the 1983 
Major League Baseball draft, Meyer showed prodigious power in the minor 
leagues. In his first season of minor league ball for the Beloit Brewers 
in 1984, he hit 30 home runs in 475 at bats. He moved his way up the minor 
league ladder, continuing to hit for power, culminating in his hitting 
29 home runs in just 79 games for the Denver Zephyrs in 1987. Meyer holds 
the record for the longest home run in professional baseball history at 
582 feet, which he hit June 3, 1987 at Denver's Mile High Stadium.[1][2] 
There have been longer home runs reportedly hit but not measured by accurate 
methods.[3] Meyer made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 
4, 1988. His power numbers did not translate into major league home runs, 
as he hit just 11 in 103 games for Milwaukee. He did, however, strike out 
88 times, compiling more strikeouts than hits. He did have one significant 
accomplishment on August 9, when he became the first and only player to 
hit a walk-off home run off of Roger Clemens.[4] He again struggled in 
the majors in 1989, striking out 36 times in 147 at bats while hitting 
7 home runs. Meyer wound up splitting that season between the Brewers and 
Denver. His final major league game was on September 30, 1989, and he was 
released after the season. He played in 1990 for the Yokohama Taiyo Whales, 
where his power numbers were once again impressive, as he hit 26 home runs 
in 104 games. He returned to the United States, and was signed to a minor 
league contract by the Minnesota Twins. During spring training, he was 
traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, and spent the entire season with their 
Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons. That was his last year in professional
