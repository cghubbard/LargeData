The Cincinnati Reds are a Major League Baseball team. Originally named 
the Cincinnati Red Stockings, the name was shortened to the Cincinnati 
Reds in the 1890s. The original Cincinnati Red Stockings, baseball's first 
openly all-professional team, was founded in 1866, and became fully professional 
in 1869. The Red Stockings won 130 straight games throughout 1869 and 1870, 
before being defeated by the Brooklyn Atlantics. Star players included 
brothers Harry and George Wright, Fred Waterman, and pitcher Asa Brainard. 
The 1869 Red Stockings made an eastern swing of 21 games and went undefeated. 
According to Walter Camp, the team received a banquet and a "champion bat...this 
rather remarkable testimonial was twenty-seven feet long and nine inches 
in diameter." The following year, the team lost only one game. They were 
defeated at the Brooklyn Athletic's Capitoline grounds park. According 
to Camp, the Red Stockings lost 8–7 in 11 innings. The game apparently 
served as a precursor to today's unruly crowds because he wrote: "A crowd 
of ten thousand people assembled to witness this match, and so lost their 
heads in the excitement as to give the Western men a very unfair reception." 
[See: "Base-Ball For The Spectator" Walter Camp, Century Magazine October 
1889] The Red Stockings lost many players and their namesake in 1870, when 
the team decided to dissolve. The name went to Boston where, in 1871, a 
new team featuring some of Cincinnati's former stars began play as the 
Boston Red Stockings. This franchise would eventually become the Atlanta 
Braves. A new Cincinnati Red Stockings team became a charter member of 
the National League in 1876, five years after the first Red Stockings team. 
The second Red Stockings team was expelled from the league after the 1880 
season, for 'violating' rules which had not yet gone into effect: namely, 
serving beer at games and allowing their park to be used on Sundays. A 
third Cincinnati team of the same name was founded in 1881, becoming a 
founding member of the American Association, a rival league that began 
play in 1882. That team (which is the same franchise of today) played for 
nine seasons in the American Association and won the Association pennant 
in 1882. The pennant winning club still holds the record for the highest 
winning percentage of any Reds club to date (.688). In November 1889, the 
Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Brooklyn Dodgers both left the Association 
for the National League. In the move, the Red Stockings dropped "Stockings" 
from their name. The Cincinnati Red Stockings left the American Association 
in 1890 to play in the National League.[1] One of the main reasons had 
absolutely nothing to do with the team directly—the upstart Player's League, 
an early, failed attempt to break the reserve clause in baseball. The league's 
impending presence severely weakened both previously existing leagues, 
and, because the National League decided to expand and the American Association 
was weakening, the team decided to accept the invitation to become members 
of the stronger National League. It was also at this time that the team 
first shortened their nickname from "Red Stockings" to "Reds." The Reds 
wandered through the 1890s signing local stars & aging veterans. During 
this time, the team never finished above third place (1897) and never closer 
than 10½ games (1890). At the start of the 20th century, the Reds had hitting 
stars such as Sam Crawford and Cy Seymour. Seymour's .377 average in 1905 
was the first individual batting crown won by a Red. In 1911, Bob Bescher 
stole 81 bases which is still a team record. Like the previous decade, 
the 1900s (decade) were not kind to the Reds, as much of the decade was 
spent in the league's second division. In 1912, Redland Field, later to 
be known as Crosley Field, built on the corner of Findlay and Western Avenues 
on the city's west side opened for the Reds. The Reds had actually been 
playing baseball on that site for the last 20 years. By the late 1910s 
the Reds began to come out of the second division. The 1918 team finished 
4th, and then new manager Pat Moran led the Reds to an NL pennant in 1919. 
The 1919 team had hitting stars led by Edd Roush and Heinie Groh while 
the pitching staff was led by Hod Eller and Harry "Slim" Sallee, a left-hander. 
The Reds finished ahead of John McGraw's New York Giants, and then won 
the world championship in 8 games over the Chicago White Sox. By 1920, 
the "Black Sox" scandal had brought a taint to the Reds' first championship. 
In the remainder of the 1920s and early 1930s the Reds were second division 
dwellers for most of those years. Eppa Rixey, Dolf Luque and Pete Donohue 
were pitching stars; the offense never quite lived up to the pitching. 
By 1931 the team was bankrupt, thanks to the Great Depression, and Redland 
Field was in a state of disrepair. Powel Crosley, Jr., an electronics magnate 
who, with his brother Lewis M. Crosley, produced radios, refrigerators, 
and other household items, bought the Reds out of bankruptcy in 1933, and 
hired Larry MacPhail to be the General Manager. Powell Crosley, Jr. had 
also started WLW radio and the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation in Cincinnati 
and was doing quite well as a civic leader. (WLW has been the Reds' radio 
flagship for decades.) MacPhail began to develop the Reds' minor league 
system and expanded the Reds' base. The Reds, throughout the 1930s, became 
a team of "firsts". Crosley Field, (formerly Redland Field), became the 
host of the first night game in 1935. Johnny Vander Meer became the only 
pitcher in major league history to throw back-to-back no-hitters in 1938. 
Thanks to Vander Meer, Paul Derringer, and infielder-turned-pitcher Bucky 
Walters, the Reds had a solid pitching staff. The offense came around in 
the late 1930s. Ernie Lombardi was named the National League's Most Valuable 
Player in 1938, First baseman Frank McCormick was the 1940 NL MVP. Other 
position players included Harry Craft, Lonny Frey, Ival Goodman and Lew 
Riggs. By 1938 the Reds, now led by manager Bill McKechnie, were out of 
the second division finishing fourth. By 1939 they were National League 
champions. The Reds were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight. 
In 1940, they repeated as NL Champions, and for the first time in 21 years, 
the Reds captured a World championship, beating the Detroit Tigers 4 games 
to 3. World War II and age finally caught up with the Reds. Throughout 
the remainder of the 1940s and the early 1950s, Cincinnati finished mostly 
in the second division. In 1944, Joe Nuxhall, (who was later to become 
part of the radio broadcasting team), at age 15, pitching for the Reds 
on loan from a Hamilton, Ohio Junior High School, became the youngest person 
ever to play in a major league game—a record that still stands today. Ewell 
"The Whip" Blackwell was the main pitching stalwart before arm problems 
cut short his career. Ted Kluszewski was the NL home run leader in 1954. 
The rest of the offense was a collection of over-the-hill players and not-ready-for-prime 
time youngsters. During 1954, the Reds changed their name to the Redlegs 
in response to the Second Red Scare and the height of the Communism movement. 
In 1956, led by National League Rookie of the Year Frank Robinson, the 
Reds hit 221 HR to tie the NL record. The 1957 season brought two tough 
moments. The first caught Reds fans stuffing ballot boxes by having seven 
Reds in the All-Star Game. As a result, voting was banned until the 1970s. 
Around this time, the Dodgers and Giants left New York in favor of California. 
There were talks of moving the Reds or another National League club to 
New York. The maturation of Robinson and other players, along with increasing 
attendance in Cincinnati halted those talks. By 1961, Robinson was joined 
by Vada Pinson, Wally Post, Gordy Coleman and Gene Freese. Pitchers Joey 
Jay, Jim O'Toole, and Bob Purkey led the staff. The newly renamed Reds 
captured the 1961 National League pennant, holding off the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants, only to be defeated by the perennially 
powerful New York Yankees in the World Series. The Reds had many successful 
teams during the rest of the 1960s, but did not produce any championships. 
They won 98 games in 1962 (paced by Purkey's 23), but finished third. In 
1964, they lost the pennant by one game, having taken 1st place when the 
Phillies collapsed in September but then losing out to the Cardinals. In 
that 1964 season, the beloved leader of the Reds, manager Fred Hutchinson, 
died of cancer, succumbing just weeks after the end of the 1964 season, 
one of baseball's most exciting pennant races ever. The failure of the 
Reds to win the 1964 pennant led to owner Bill DeWitt's selling off key 
components of the team, in anticipation of relocating the franchise. After 
the 1965 season he executed what may be the most lopsided trade in baseball 
history, sending former Most-Valuable Player Frank Robinson to the Baltimore 
Orioles for pitchers Milt Pappas, Jack Baldschun, and outfielder Dick Simpson. 
Robinson went on to win the MVP in the American league for 1966, win the 
"triple crown", and lead Baltimore to its first ever World Series title 
in a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Reds did not recover 
from this trade until the rise of the "Big Red Machine" of the 1970s. Starting 
in the early 1960s, the Reds' farm system began producing a series of future 
stars, such as Jim Maloney (the Reds pitching ace of the 1960s), Pete Rose, 
Tony Pérez, Johnny Bench (a great catcher and the backbone of the Reds 
for years to come), Lee May, Tommy Helms, Bernie Carbo, Hal McRae, Dave 
Concepción, and Gary Nolan. The tipping point came in 1967 with the appointment 
of Bob Howsam as general manager. Howsam pulled two key trades to complement 
the Reds' bats. The first brought in outfielder Alex Johnson who would 
return to form after some years with the Phillies. The second traded veteran 
Vada Pinson to St. Louis for the speedy Bobby Tolan. Around this time, 
the Reds avoided an all but certain move to San Diego when the city of 
Cincinnati and Hamilton County agreed to build a new, state of the art, 
downtown stadium on the edge of the Ohio River. The Reds entered into a 
30-year lease in exchange for the stadium commitment keeping the franchise 
in its original home city. In a series of strategic moves, Howsam nurtured 
the homegrown talent and brought in key personnel, allowing the team to 
finally reach its potential during the 1970s. The Reds' final game at Crosley 
Field, home to more than 4,500 baseball games, were played on June 24, 
1970, a 5-4 victory over the San Francisco Giants. In its place, a new 
stadium, and a new Reds dynasty. Under Bob Howsam's administration starting 
in the late 1960s, the Reds instituted a strict rule barring the team's 
players from wearing mustaches, beards, and long hair. (This rule, with 
a mustache exemption, is also enforced to this day by the New York Yankees.) 
The clean cut look was meant to present the team as wholesome and traditional 
in an era of turmoil. Over the years, the rule was controversial, but persisted 
under the ownership of Marge Schott. All players coming to the Reds were 
required to shave and cut their hair for the next three decades or more. 
On at least one occasion, in the early 1980s, when the Reds were hurting 
for pitching, strict enforcement of this rule lost them the services of 
star reliever Rollie Fingers, who would not shave his trademark handlebar 
moustache in order to join the team. The Reds thus took a pass on Fingers. 
[1] When Pete Rose became player-manager in the mid-1980s, he grew a "rat's 
tail", fashionable among the youth of the time, but the rule was not officially 
rescinded until 1999 when the Reds traded for slugger Greg Vaughn who had 
a goatee. The Reds' grooming rules also included guidelines for wearing 
the uniform. In major league baseball, a club generally provides most of 
the equipment and clothing needed for play. However, players are required 
to supply their gloves and shoes themselves. Many players take advantage 
of this rule by entering into sponsorship arrangements with shoe manufacturers. 
Through the mid-1980s, the Reds had a strict rule that players were to 
wear only plain black shoes with no prominent logo. Reds players decried 
the boring color choice as well as the denial of the opportunity to earn 
more money through shoe contracts. A compromise was struck in which players 
were given the opportunity to wear red shoes. For years, club management 
and players throughout Major League Baseball have been involved in a struggle 
over how uniform pants and stockings are to be worn. Generally, baseball 
players wear a double layer of socks—underneath, the regular socks or "sanitaries" 
(traditionally plain white) and over that, a stirrup-type stocking (traditionally 
bearing team colors). Some clubs, such as the Reds, require that the pants 
and socks be worn so that the team colors on the stirrup are visible. However, 
since the 1990s, players have generally preferred to pull down the cuffs 
of their trousers all the way to the ankle, thus covering up the colored 
stockings. In 1970, little known George "Sparky" Anderson was hired as 
manager, and the Reds embarked upon a decade of excellence, with a team 
that came to be known as "The Big Red Machine". Playing at Crosley Field 
until June 30, 1970, when they moved into brand-new Riverfront Stadium, 
a 52,000 seat multi-purpose venue on the shores of the Ohio River, the 
Reds began the 1970s with a bang by winning 70 of their first 100 games. 
Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, Pete Rose, Lee May and Bobby Tolan were the early 
Red Machine offensive leaders; Gary Nolan, Jim Merritt Jim Maloney and 
Jim McGlothlin led a pitching staff which also contained veterans Tony 
Cloninger and Clay Carroll and youngsters Wayne Simpson and Don Gullett. 
The Reds breezed through the 1970 season, won the NL West and captured 
the NL pennant by sweeping the Pittsburgh Pirates in three games. By time 
the club got to the World Series, however, the Reds pitching staff had 
run out of gas and the veteran Baltimore Orioles beat the Reds in five 
games. After the disastrous 1971 season (the second season between 1961 
and 1981 during which the Reds finished with a losing record) the Reds 
reloaded by trading veterans Jimmy Stewart, May, and Tommy Helms for Joe 
Morgan, César Gerónimo, Jack Billingham, Ed Armbrister, and Denis Menke. 
Meanwhile, Dave Concepción blossomed at shortstop. 1971 was also the year 
a key component of the future world championships was acquired in George 
Foster from the San Francisco Giants in a trade for shortstop Frank Duffy. 
The 1972 Reds won the NL West in a baseball first ever strike-shortened 
season and defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in an exciting five-game playoff 
series—that fifth game in Cincinnati was the last major league game Pittsburgh's 
great Roberto Clemente ever played—then faced the Oakland Athletics in 
the World Series. Six of the seven games were won by one run. With powerful 
slugger Reggie Jackson sidelined due to an injury incurred during Oakland's 
playoff series against Detroit, Ohio native Gene Tenace got a chance to 
play in the series for manager Dick Williams, delivering four home runs 
that tied the World Series record for homers, propelling Oakland to a dramatic 
seventh game series win. This was the first World Series in which no starting 
pitcher for either side pitched a complete game. The Reds won a third NL 
West crown in 1973 after a dramatic second half comeback, that saw them 
make up 10½ games on the Los Angeles Dodgers after the All-Star break. 
However, they lost the NL pennant to the New York Mets in five games. In 
game one, Tom Seaver faced Jack Billingham in a classic pitching duo, with 
all three runs of the 2-1 margin being scored on home runs. John Milner 
provided New York's run off Billingham, while Pete Rose tied the game in 
the seventh inning off Seaver, setting the stage for a dramatic game ending 
home run by Johnny Bench in the bottom of the ninth inning. The New York 
series provided plenty of controversy with the riotious behavior of Shea 
Stadium fans towards Pete Rose when he and Bud Harrelson scuffled after 
a hard slide by Rose into Harrelson at second base during the fifth inning 
of Game 3. A full bench-clearing fight resulted. The resulting on-field 
tension led to two separate incidents in which play was stopped. The Reds 
trailed 9-3 and New York's manager, Yogi Berra, and legendary outfielder 
Willie Mays at the request of National League president Warren Giles appealed 
to fans in left field to restrain themselves. The next day the series was 
extended to a fifth game when Rose homered in the 12th inning to tie the 
series at two games each. The 1974 season started off with much excitement, 
as the Atlanta Braves were in town to open the season with the Reds. Hank 
Aaron entered opening day with 713 home runs, one shy of tying Babe Ruth's 
record of 714. On a three ball one strike count, the first pitch Aaron 
swung at in the 74 season was the record tying home run off Jack Billingham. 
The next day the Braves benched Aaron, hoping to save him for his record 
breaking home run on their season opening homestand. The commissioner of 
baseball, Bowie Kuhn, ordered Braves management to play Aaron the next 
day, where he narrowly missed the historic home run in the fifth inning. 
Aaron went on to set the record in Atlanta two nights later off Al Downing 
and the Los Angeles Dodgers. 1974 also was the debut of Marty Brennaman, 
who replaced Al Michaels, after Michaels left the Reds to broadcast for 
the San Francisco Giants. However, the Reds would win 98 games in 1974, 
finishing second to MVP Steve Garvey and the Los Angeles Dodgers. With 
1975, the Big Red Machine lineup solidified with the starting team of Johnny 
Bench (c), Tony Pérez (1b), Joe Morgan (2b), Dave Concepción (ss), Pete 
Rose (3b), Ken Griffey (rf), César Gerónimo (cf), and George Foster (lf). 
The starting pitchers included Don Gullett, Fred Norman, Gary Nolan, Jack 
Billingham, Pat Darcy, and Clay Kirby. However, it was the bullpen that 
was the key to the Reds' pitching (and Anderson's reputation as "Captain 
Hook") with Rawly Eastwick and Will McEnaney as the key closers with a 
combined 37 saves. Pedro Borbón and Clay Carroll filled in as stretchers 
between the starters and the finishers. However, this was not the lineup 
on Opening Day. At that time, Rose still played in left field and Foster 
was not a starter, while John Vukovich, an off-season acquisition from 
the Milwaukee Brewers was the starting third baseman, replacing Dan Driessen, 
who was a decent hitter, but whose defensive skills were considered a weakness. 
While Vuckovich was a superb defensive shortstop, he was a weak hitter, 
as was the declining Denis Menke. In May, with the team off to a slow start 
and trailing the Dodgers, Sparky Anderson made a bold move by moving Rose 
to third base (a position where he had very little experience) and inserting 
Foster in left field to bat cleanup. This was the jolt that the Reds needed 
to propel them into first place, with Rose proving to be reliable on defense, 
while adding Foster to the outfield gave the offense some added punch. 
During the season, the Reds compiled two notable streaks: (1) by winning 
41 out of 50 games in one stretch, and (2) by going a month without committing 
any errors on defense. In the 1975 season, Cincinnati clinched the NL West 
with 108 victories, 20 games ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers, then swept 
the Pittsburgh Pirates in three games to win the NL pennant. In the World 
Series, the Boston Red Sox were the opponents. After splitting the first 
four games, the Reds took Game 5. After a three-day rain delay, the two 
teams met in Game 6, one of the most memorable baseball games ever played 
and considered by many to be the best World Series game ever. The Reds 
were ahead 6-3 with 5 outs left, when the Red Sox tied the game on former 
Red Bernie Carbo's three-run home run. It was Carbo's second pinch-hit 
three-run homer in the series. After a few close-calls either way, Carlton 
Fisk hit a dramatic 12th inning home run off the foul pole in left field 
(which is considered to be one of the greatest TV sports moments of all 
time) to give the Red Sox a 7–6 win and force a deciding Game 7. Cincinnati 
prevailed the next day when Morgan's RBI single won Game 7 and gave the 
Reds their first championship in 35 years. 1976 saw a return of the same 
starting eight in the field. The starting rotation was led by Gary Nolan. 
The remaining starters, Don Gullett, Jack Billingham, Pat Zachry, Santo 
Alcala, and Fred Norman comprised an underrated staff in which four of 
the six had ERAs below 3.10. Rawly Eastwick, Pedro Borbón, and Will McEnaney 
shared closer duties, recording 26, 8, and 7 saves respectively. In 1976, 
the Reds won the NL West by ten games over the archrival Dodgers. They 
went undefeated in the postseason, sweeping the Philadelphia Phillies (winning 
Game 3 in their final at-bat) to return to the World Series. They continued 
to dominate by sweeping the Yankees in the newly renovated Yankee Stadium, 
the first World Series games played in Yankee Stadium since 1964. This 
was only the second ever sweep of the proud Yankees in the World Series. 
In winning the Series, the Reds became the first NL team since the 1921–22 
New York Giants to win back-to-back World Series championships. The Big 
Red Machine was also part of the rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies 
and the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Reds won all their four pennants in the 
1970s against both teams. Pete Rose would add further fuel to The Big Red 
Machine being part of the rivalry when he signed with the Phillies in 1979 
and helped them win their first ever World Series in 1980. Personnel changes 
were in the offing. Popular Tony Pérez was sent to Montreal after the 1976 
season, breaking up the Big Red Machine's starting lineup. Starting pitcher 
Don Gullett left via free agency and signed with the New York Yankees. 
In an effort to fill that gap, a trade with the Oakland A's for starting 
ace Vida Blue was arranged during the '76–'77 off-season. However, Bowie 
Kuhn, the Commissioner of Baseball at the time, vetoed this trade in an 
effort to maintain the competitive balance in baseball. On June 15, 1977, 
the Reds entered the trading market with a vengeance. New York was heartbroken 
by the news that the Mets' franchise pitcher Tom Seaver was being traded 
to the Reds in a multiple-player deal for Pat Zachry, Doug Flynn, Steve 
Henderson, and Dan Norman. In less successful deals, the Reds also traded 
Gary Nolan to the Angels for Craig Hendrickson, Rawly Eastwick to St. Louis 
for Doug Capilla and Mike Caldwell to Milwaukee for Dick O'Keefe and Garry 
Pyka, and got Rick Auerbach from Texas. The end of the Big Red Machine 
era was heralded by the replacement of General Manager Bob Howsam with 
Dick Wagner. After the 1978 season, Cincinnati hero Pete Rose, who since 
1963 had played almost every position for the team except pitcher and catcher, 
signed with Philadelphia as a free agent. In Rose's last season as a Red, 
he gave baseball a thrill as he challenged Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting 
streak, tying for the second longest streak ever at 44 games. The streak 
came to an end in Atlanta after striking out in his 5th at bat in the game 
against Gene Garber. Rose also earned his 3000th hit that season, on his 
way to becoming baseball's all time hits leader when he rejoined the Reds 
in the mid-1980s. The year also witnessed the only no-hitter of pitcher 
Tom Seaver's career, coming against the St. Louis Cardinals on June 16, 
1978. The later years of the 1970s brought turmoil and change. After two 
consecutive runner-up seasons, Wagner fired manager Anderson. By 1979, 
players Gullett, Nolan, Pérez, and Rose, among others, had left the club. 
By 1979, the starters included Bench (c), Dan Driessen (1b), Morgan (2b), 
Concepción (ss), and Ray Knight (3b), with Griffey, Foster, and Geronimo 
again in the outfield. The pitching staff had experienced an almost complete 
turnover. The ace starter was now Seaver. Only Norman was left from 1975–76; 
the remaining starters were Mike La Coss, Bill Bonham, and Paul Moskau. 
In the bullpen, only Borbon had remained. Dave Tomlin and Mario Soto worked 
mid-innings with Tom Hume and Doug Bair closing. The Reds did manage to 
win the 1979 NL West behind the pitching of Tom Seaver but were dispatched 
in the NL playoffs by Pittsburgh, after a controversial play in Game 2 
in which a ball hit by Pittsburgh's Phil Garner was caught by Cincinnati 
outfielder Dave Collins but was ruled a trap, setting the Pirates up to 
take a 2-1 lead. The Pirates swept the series 3 games to 0. After the season 
ended, Joe Morgan returned to the Astros. Ironically, the Reds would lose 
the NL West to those Astros in 1980, despite Dave Collins stealing 79 bases. 
The 1981 team fielded a strong lineup, with only Concepción, Foster, and 
Griffey retaining their spots from the 1975-76 heyday. Johnny Bench broke 
his ankle and so Joe Nolan played the majority of games behind the plate. 
Driessen and Knight still played the corners, but Morgan and Geronimo had 
been replaced at second base and center field by Ron Oester and Dave Collins. 
Mario Soto posted a banner year starting on the mound, even surpassing 
the performance of Seaver. La Coss, Bruce Berenyi, and Frank Pastore rounded 
out the starting rotation. Hume again led the bullpen as closer, joined 
by Bair, Moskau, Joe Price, and Geoff Combe. In 1981, Cincinnati had the 
best overall record in baseball, but they finished second in the division 
in both of the half-seasons that were created after a mid-season players' 
strike. To commemorate this, a team photo was taken, accompanied by a banner 
that read "Baseball's Best Record 1981." By 1982, the Reds were a shell 
of the original Red Machine; they lost 100 games that year. Johnny Bench 
retired a year later. Outraged Reds fans proclaimed, "We Wuz Robbed!" After 
the heartbreak of 1981, General Manager Dick Wagner pursued the strategy 
of ridding the team of pricey veterans, stars, and proven winners, ridding 
the roster of catcher Nolan, third-baseman Knight (who had adequately replaced 
the unreplaceable Pete Rose) and the entire starting outfield of Griffey, 
Foster, and Collins. Johnny Bench decided to give up catching entirely 
and was made the starting third baseman; Alex Treviño became the regular 
starting catcher. The outfield was staffed with Paul Householder, César 
Cedeño, and the untried Eddie Milner. The starting rotation still featured 
the strong Seaver and Soto, joined by Pastore and Bruce Berenyi, but their 
efforts were wasted without a strong offensive lineup backing them. Tom 
Hume still led the bullpen, but he had no support from the dismal relieving 
of Ben Hayes, Brad "The Animal" Lesley, Joe Price, and Jim Kern. The Reds 
fell to the absolute bottom of the Western Division for the next few years, 
losing Seaver after the 1982 season. A series of desultory changes were 
made -- Dann Bilardello behind the plate, Nick Esasky taking over after 
Bench's failed experiment in the hot corner, and Gary Redus taking over 
from Cedeno. Tom Hume had pitched himself out and there was not a body 
in the bullpen worth naming. Dave Concepción was the sole remaining starter 
from the Big Red Machine era. Wagner's control of the Reds ended in 1983, 
when Howsam, the architect of the Big Red Machine was brought back and 
he began his return by acquiring Cincinnati native Dave Parker from Pittsburgh. 
In 1984 the Reds began to move up, depending on trades and some minor leaguers. 
In that season Dave Parker, Dave Concepción and Tony Pérez were in Cincinnati 
uniforms. By the end of 1984, Pete Rose was hired to be the Reds player-manager. 
After raising the franchise from the grave, Howsam gave way to the administration 
of Bill Bergesch, who was principally known for holding on tightly to perennial 
future stars like Kurt Stillwell, Tracy Jones, Kal Daniels, and others, 
refusing to risk these "crown jewels" for pitching help. Under Bergesch, 
from 1985-89 the Reds finished second four times. Among the highlights, 
Rose became the all-time hits leader, Tom Browning threw a perfect game, 
and Chris Sabo was the 1988 National League Rookie of the Year. The Reds 
also had a bullpen star in John Franco, who was with the team from 1984 
to 1989. In 1989, Rose was banned from baseball by Commissioner Bart Giamatti, 
who declared Rose guilty of "conduct detrimental to baseball." Controversy 
also swirled around Reds owner Marge Schott, who was accused several times 
of ethnic and racial slurs. In 1987, General Manager Bill Bergesch was 
replaced by Murray Cook, who initiated a series of deals that would finally 
bring the Reds back to the championship. First, knowing that Barry Larkin 
was already the full-time shortstop, the Reds traded Kurt Stillwell to 
the Kansas City Royals for pitcher Danny Jackson. Jackson would respond 
by winning 23 games in 1988. Next, reliever John Franco was traded to the 
New York Mets for reliever Randy Myers. Also, another Bergesch favorite, 
veteran Dave Parker was traded to the Oakland Athletics for young pitcher 
José Rijo. After the 1989 season, another trade brought in first baseman 
Hal Morris from the New York Yankees. The Reds also hired former Yankee 
player and manager Lou Piniella to manage the Reds. In 1990, the Reds under 
Piniella shocked baseball by leading the NL West from wire-to-wire. They 
started off 33-12, winning their first 9 games, and maintained their lead 
throughout the year. Led by Chris Sabo, Barry Larkin, Eric Davis, Paul 
O'Neill and Billy Hatcher in the field, and by José Rijo, Tom Browning 
and the "Nasty Boys" of Rob Dibble, Norm Charlton and Randy Myers on the 
mound, the Reds took out the Pirates in the NLCS and swept the heavily 
favored Oakland Athletics in four straight. The sweep of the Athletics 
extended the Reds winning streak in the World Series to 9 consecutive games. 
The World Series, however, cost the team Eric Davis, who severely bruised 
a kidney diving for a fly ball in the first inning of Game 4. The 1991 
season was disappointing to Cincinnati, only winning 74 games and losing 
88, the most losses by a reigning Series champion until the dismantled 
1998 Florida Marlins lost 108. In 1992, Quinn was replaced in the front 
office by Jim Bowden. Bowden would trade outfielder Eric Davis to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers for pitcher Tim Belcher. On the field, manager Lou Piniella 
wanted outfielder Paul O'Neill to be his premier power-hitter to fill the 
void left by Eric Davis after he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Despite O'Neill's poor performance in his new role (he only hit .246 with 
14 home runs), the Reds won 90 games in 1992. The 90 wins were good enough 
for second place in the National League West as the Atlanta Braves charged 
their way to the division title and a second consecutive National League 
Pennant. One of the low points of the season came when Piniella got into 
an altercation with "Nasty Boy" Rob Dibble. That coupled with O'Neill's 
trade to the New York Yankees for outfielder Roberto Kelly put a huge damper 
on the Reds season. The long-term effects of the O'Neill/Kelly trade were 
even worse as Kelly would only be in a Reds uniform for a few years, while 
O'Neill wound up being a leader for the great New York Yankee teams from 
the mid-to-late 1990s. The Reds would also replace their "Big Red Machine" 
era uniforms after 1992 season for a sleeveless look, reminiscing the Reds' 
days in the 1960s. Before 1993 season manager Lou Piniella was replaced 
by fan favorite Tony Pérez. Pérez's reign would be short-lived though as 
he only lasted only 44 games at the helm. Pérez was replaced by Davey Johnson, 
who had led the New York Mets to a World Championship in 1986. With Johnson 
steering the team, the Reds made steady progress upward. In 1994, the Reds 
were in the newly created National League Central Division with the Chicago 
Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates and Houston Astros. By the 
time the 1994 strike hit, the Reds were a half-game ahead of the Astros 
for first place in the division. 1995 saw the Reds win the National League 
Central led by shortstop and NL MVP Barry Larkin. After defeating the Western 
Division Champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the first NLDS since 1981, they 
were demolished in 4 games by the Eastern Division Champion Atlanta Braves 
in the NLCS. That season also saw one of the most bizarre if not worst 
moves in team history, as eccentric team owner Marge Schott announced mid-season 
that Johnson would be gone by the end of the year, regardless of outcome, 
to be replaced by former Reds third baseman Ray Knight. Knight, along with 
his wife, professional golfer Nancy Lopez, were personal friends of Schott's. 
The team took a dive under Knight as he was unable to complete two full 
seasons as manager. Ironically Knight was the starting third baseman for 
the World Champion 1986 Mets; whom were managed by Johnson. Knight was 
replaced by Jack McKeon and by 1999 the Reds won 96 games and were contending 
for a playoff spot. After the season ended the Reds found themselves tied 
with the New York Mets for the National League Wild Card. The Mets, led 
by a brilliant pitching performance by Al Leiter won a one-game playoff 
at Cinergy Field and ended the Reds' season. The end of this game will 
be remembered by many as former Reds closer John Franco, who was traded 
to the Mets for Randy Myers before the 1990 season, ran wildly around the 
field celebrating the first playoff berth of his career. After the 2002 
season Cinergy Field was demolished to make way for the new Great American 
Ball Park. The demolition of the Reds' most successful home field severed 
the last tie to the team's "Big Red Machine" era. Great American Ball Park 
opened in 2003, with high expectations for a team led by local favorites, 
including outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., shortstop Barry Larkin, reliever 
Danny Graves and first baseman Sean Casey. Although attendance improved 
considerably with the new ballpark, the team continued to lose. After years 
of promises that the club was rebuilding toward the opening of the new 
ballpark, General Manager Jim Bowden and manager Bob Boone were fired on 
July 28. This broke up the father-son combo of manager Bob Boone and third 
baseman Aaron Boone. Aaron was soon traded to the New York Yankees, where 
he would hit the series-winning home run of the 2003 ALCS over the Boston 
Red Sox. Following the season Dan O'Brien was hired as the Reds' 16th General 
Manager. The 2004 and 2005 seasons continued the trend of big hitting, 
poor pitching, and ultimately poor records for the Reds. Ken Griffey, Jr. 
joined the 500-home run club in 2004, giving Reds fans one of the few highlights 
of his injury-plagued stay in Cincinnati. Adam Dunn emerged as formidable 
home run hitter, hitting a 535-foot home run against José Lima. Dunn's 
power was offset by his inconsistency at times also as he broke the single-season 
major league record for strikeouts in 2004. The Reds were quickly in last 
place to begin the 2005 season, costing manager Dave Miley his job. Miley 
was replaced by Jerry Narron. Like many other small market clubs, the Reds 
dispatched some of their veteran players and began entrusting their future 
to a young nucleus that included Dunn, Ryan Freel, and Aaron Harang. In 
2006, a new era in Reds baseball began as Robert Castellini took over as 
owner, assuming control of the team from Carl Lindner. Castinelli promptly 
fired general manager Dan O'Brien. Wayne Krivsky, previously an assistant 
General Manager with the Minnesota Twins, and a candidate for the job when 
O'Brien was hired, was appointed as the General Manager of the Reds after 
a protracted search. The first move Krivsky made was to trade young outfielder 
Wily Mo Peña to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher Bronson Arroyo. Arroyo made 
his first start in a Reds uniform on April 5, 2006. He not only earned 
the win, but also led off the third inning with his first career home run. 
Krivsky also gave fans hope with mid-season trades that bolstered the "non-existent" 
bullpen, trading for Eddie Guardado and then trading outfielder Austin 
Kearns, shortstop Felipe López, and 2004 first-round draft pick Ryan Wagner 
to the Washington Nationals for relievers Gary Majewski and Bill Bray, 
shortstop Royce Clayton, and two prospects. This move was controversial, 
as not only did it seem as if the Reds did not receive much in return for 
two starting position players and a former first-round draft pick, but 
also it was later discovered that the Nationals may have hidden Majewski's 
health problems. For Opening Day 2006, President George W. Bush threw out 
the ceremonial first pitch, becoming the first sitting president to throw 
out the first pitch at a Reds game. The 2007 season was a great disappointment 
for the Reds when they finished in fifth place (72-90). One of the bright 
spots of the season was the emergence of young second baseman Brandon Phillips. 
Despite many fans' perception that interim manager Pete Mackanin might 
be a good fit as manager, the Reds made a bold move toward winning and 
hired three-time National League Manager of the Year Dusty Baker to guide 
the Reds in the 2008 season. The 2008 season had high expectations since 
Dusty Baker usually turned teams around during their first years (evident 
with the 1993 San Francisco Giants who went 103-59 after going 72-90 the 
previous season, and the 2003 Chicago Cubs when they won the Central Division 
after finishing under .500 in 2002). However, the Reds would fall short 
by going 74-88 and finishing in fifth once again. There were some bright 
spots in the season despite the bad finish. In his first start, pitcher 
Johnny Cueto would strike out ten Arizona Diamondbacks. The next month, 
rookie outfielder Jay Bruce would make his debut by delivering several
