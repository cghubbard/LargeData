As player As manager John Michael "Johnny" Pesky (born John Michael Paveskovich; 
February 27, 1919 – August 13, 2012), nicknamed "The Needle" and "Mr. Red 
Sox",[1] was an American professional baseball player, manager and coach. 
He was a shortstop and third baseman during a ten-year major league playing 
career, appearing in 1,270 games played in 1942 and from 1946 to 1954 for 
three different teams. He missed the 1943–45 seasons while serving in World 
War II. Pesky was associated with the Boston Red Sox for 61 of his 73 years 
in baseball—from 1940 through June 3, 1952; 1961 through 1964; and from 
1969 until his death. Pesky also managed the Red Sox from 1963 to 1964, 
and in September 1980. His biography is Mr. Red Sox by Bill Nowlin, published 
by Rounder Books division of Rounder Records.[2] A left-handed hitter who 
threw right-handed, Pesky was a tough man for pitchers to strike out. He 
was the first American League (AL) player to score 6 runs in a 9 inning 
game. As a hitter, he specialized in getting on base, leading the AL in 
base hits three times—his first three seasons in the majors,[3] in which 
he collected over 200 hits each year—and was among the top ten in on-base 
percentage six times while batting .307 in 4,745 at bats as a major leaguer.[3] 
He was also an excellent bunter who led the league in sacrifice hits in 
1942. He was a teammate and close friend of Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr and 
Dom DiMaggio. Their friendship was chronicled in David Halberstam's book 
The Teammates. Pesky was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of Croat immigrants 
Jakov and Marija (Bajama) Paveskovich.[4] (Major League Baseball has his 
date of birth as September 27, 1919, an adjustment made by Pesky in 1939 
to meet baseball scouting age limits for tryouts.)[5] Pesky played for 
Lincoln High School, and spent several years playing for local amateur 
teams, such as the Portland Babes, Bend Elks and Silverton Red Sox. The 
third of these teams was associated with the Silver Falls Timber Company, 
which was owned by Tom Yawkey, who also owned the major league Red Sox.[6] 
A skilled ice hockey player, he once worked out with the Boston Bruins. 
Early in his playing career, Portland sportswriters would abbreviate his 
name to "Pesky" because it fit better in a box score. He would legally 
change his name to Pesky in 1947.[7] Pesky was signed as an amateur free 
agent by the Red Sox before the 1940 season and spent the next two seasons 
in the minor leagues. In 1940, he played for the Rocky Mount Red Sox of 
the Piedmont League, where he was a teammate of future Hall of Famer Heinie 
Manush, who was the team's player-manager. After hitting .325 with Rocky 
Mount, he moved up to the double-A Louisville Colonels, where he also batted 
.325. The next year, he was in the major leagues. During his rookie year 
in 1942, Pesky led the AL in hits with 205—at the time a record for a rookie[6]—as 
well as sacrifice hits with 22. He was second only to teammate Ted Williams 
in average at .331, and finished third in Most Valuable Player voting behind 
MVP Joe Gordon and Williams. After missing three seasons due to World War 
II, Pesky came back in 1946 and seemed not to miss a beat, leading the 
league in hits once again, batting .335, third in the league, and finishing 
fourth in the MVP voting while also making his first and only All-Star 
team. His 53 hits in August set a team record for hits in a month, a record 
later tied by Dom DiMaggio. In 1947, Pesky batted .324 while leading the 
league in hits for the third consecutive year with 207. In the 1947–48 
offseason, the Red Sox traded six players and $310,000 in cash to the St. 
Louis Browns for Vern Stephens and Jack Kramer. Stephens, a three-time 
All-Star, was also a shortstop, and Pesky was asked to move to third base. 
The switch took a toll on Pesky, who had his worst season to date as a 
hitter, as his average dropped to .281. He bounced back to hit over .300 
each year from 1949 to 1951, and in 1951 he and Stephens swapped positions, 
with Pesky returning to short and Stephens moving to third base. Pesky 
began the 1952 season very slowly, and by mid-June he had played in just 
25 games, batting .149. He was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a nine-player 
deal. He split time at shortstop with Neil Berry, batting .254 in 69 games 
with the Tigers. In 1953, the Tigers moved Pesky to second base, and his 
batting average rebounded somewhat to .292. However, in 1954, the Tigers 
installed rookie Frank Bolling at second base, and Pesky was demoted to 
the bench. He was traded in mid-season for the second time, this time to 
the Washington Senators, but after finishing the season batting just .246 
overall, he was released. Pesky was signed by the Baltimore Orioles on 
December 16, 1954, but was released four months later on April 10, 1955.[8] 
He signed with the New York Yankees, where he was assigned to their top 
farm club, the Denver Bears as a player-coach. In honor of Pesky, the right 
field foul pole at Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox, is known as Pesky's 
Pole, or the Pesky Pole. Former teammate and Sox broadcaster Mel Parnell 
named the pole after Pesky. The story goes that Pesky won a game for Parnell 
in 1948 with a home run down the short (302 feet/92m) right field line, 
just around the pole. Being that Pesky was a contact hitter who hit only 
17 home runs—six of them at Fenway Park—in 4,745 at bats in the major leagues, 
it's quite possible that the home runs he hit there landed in close proximity 
to the pole. Research, however, shows that Pesky hit just one home run 
in a game pitched by Parnell, a two-run shot in the first inning of a game 
against Detroit played on June 11, 1950. The game was eventually won by 
the visiting Tigers in the 14th inning on a three-run shot by Tigers right 
fielder Vic Wertz and Parnell earned a no-decision that day.[9] Pesky began 
his coaching career in the New York Yankees organization with the 1955 
Denver Bears of the Triple-A American Association working under manager 
Ralph Houk. From 1956 through 1960, Pesky was a manager in the Detroit 
farm system, reaching the Double-A level with the Birmingham Barons and 
the Victoria Rosebuds. He then rejoined the Red Sox in 1961 as manager 
of their Triple-A farm club, the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast 
League. Pesky enjoyed two winning seasons in Seattle. At the close of the 
1962 campaign, Boston owner Tom Yawkey elevated manager Pinky Higgins to 
the club's vacant post of general manager and personally appointed Pesky 
as Higgins' replacement. Although the selection of Pesky was a popular 
choice, the Red Sox were a second division team and notorious as a "country 
club" — a group of unmotivated players who did what they wanted, when they 
wanted. In addition, Higgins and Pesky were not particularly close, and 
the general manager would be accused of undermining Yawkey's hand-picked 
skipper. A major off-season trade added slugging first baseman Dick Stuart 
to Pesky's maiden roster, and while Stuart would lead the American League 
with 118 runs batted in during 1963, he was an atrocious fielder (nicknamed 
"Dr. Strangeglove" and "Stonefingers") who would constantly defy Pesky's 
authority and make it difficult for him to control his players. Pesky's 
1963 club started quickly. It won 40 of its first 70 games and on June 
28 stood only 1½ games behind the league-leading Yankees.[10] The team's 
standout performer, relief pitcher Dick Radatz (converted to the bullpen 
by Pesky at Seattle in 1961), had saved 12 games and won seven others with 
a 1.16 earned run average to keep the Red Sox in contention to that point. 
But the team buckled from poor defense and, apart from Radatz and 20-game-winning 
starter Bill Monbouquette, lack of pitching depth and went only 36–55 for 
the rest of the campaign to finish 76–85 and in seventh place in the ten-team 
American League. The following year, despite another strong contribution 
from Radatz and the debut of star 19-year-old rookie outfielder Tony Conigliaro, 
the 1964 Sox continued to languish in the second division, winning only 
70 of the 160 games Pesky managed. With two games left in the season, he 
was replaced as manager by Billy Herman, the club's third-base coach and 
a friend of Higgins'. Pesky then left the Red Sox for four seasons, and 
joined the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. From 1965 through 1967, he 
served as first-base coach for Pirate manager Harry Walker, who had hit 
the double that scored Enos Slaughter with the winning run in the eighth 
inning of Game 7 of the 1946 World Series — the play on which Pesky was 
accused of "holding the ball" on a relay from the outfield, allegedly hesitating 
as Slaughter made his "mad dash" for home from first base. After Walker's 
firing in 1967, Pesky managed the Bucs' Triple-A farm club, the Columbus 
Jets of the International League, to a second-place finish in 1968. After 
the 1968 season, Pesky returned to the Red Sox organization as a color 
commentator on the Sox' radio and television announcing crew. A few days 
after he took on the job, his old friend Ted Williams, newly named manager 
of the Washington Senators, asked Pesky to be his bench coach and top aide. 
Although tempted by Williams' offer, Pesky decided to remain in Boston.[11] 
He worked with Ken Coleman and Ned Martin on Boston's WHDH Radio and TV 
from 1969 to 1971, then strictly on television with Coleman on WBZ-TV from 
1972 to 1974. He later served as analyst for selected games on radio with 
Joe Castiglione calling play-by-play. In 1975, Pesky finally returned to 
uniform as a full-time coach under manager Darrell Johnson. As in Pittsburgh, 
he worked at first base and, in his first season back on the field, the 
Bosox won the 1975 American League East title, swept the three-time world 
champion Oakland Athletics in the 1975 American League Championship Series, 
and battled the Cincinnati Reds in a thrilling, seven-game World Series. 
Pesky remained first-base coach under Johnson and his successor, Don Zimmer, 
before moving to a bench and batting coach role for Zimmer in 1980. The 
Red Sox had been contenders for most of the late 1970s, but in 1980 they 
stumbled to fourth place in the AL East, resulting in Zimmer's dismissal 
with five games left in the season. Pesky took command as interim pilot, 
and Boston lost four of five, to finish Pesky's career managing record 
at 147-179 (.451). The following season, another old friend, Ralph Houk, 
became Boston's manager, and Pesky resumed his role as the club's batting 
and bench coach. He was especially valued by Sox slugger Jim Rice, with 
whom Pesky worked tirelessly. Pesky missed the entire 1983 season with 
a serious food allergy that caused severe weight loss, but once the source 
of the illness was discovered, he was able to return for a final season 
as a full-time coach in 1984. In 1990, nearing age 71, he spent almost 
2½ months as interim manager of Boston's top farm club, the Pawtucket Red 
Sox, when the team's skipper, Ed Nottle, was fired in June. But from 1985 
until his death (with the exception of his 1990 Pawtucket assignment), 
he served as a special instructor and assistant to the general manager, 
often suiting up before games to work with players. Intermittently, Pesky 
was allowed to sit on the Red Sox bench during games, but three times was 
prevented from the task — once by his own general manager, Dan Duquette, 
a second time when the Baltimore Orioles complained to MLB, and a third 
time in March 2007, when Major League Baseball announced it would enforce 
limitations that only six coaches could be in uniform during a game. As 
an instructor, Pesky was ineligible. On April 3, 2007, the North Shore 
Spirit, a now-defunct team in the Independent Can-Am League, in Lynn, Massachusetts 
invited Pesky to sit in their dugout — and serve as an honorary coach — 
anytime he wanted. When the Red Sox returned to the World Series in 2004 
to face the Cardinals for a third time, Pesky was officially a Special 
Assignment Instructor and watched the final out of Game 4, where the Red 
Sox sealed a sweep and their first World Series win in 86 years, from the 
visiting clubhouse at Busch Stadium. In the celebration that immediately 
followed, he was embraced by members of the Curse-breaking, title-winning 
Sox such as Tim Wakefield, Curt Schilling and Kevin Millar as a living 
representative of past Red Sox stars whose teams had fallen short of winning 
the Fall Classic, at times literally at the final hurdle. As John Powers 
wrote for the Boston Globe, "Pesky was the stand-in for all of the Towne 
Teamers who'd gotten to the World Series and fell short. For teammate Ted 
Williams, who wept in the clubhouse after batting .200 in 1946. For Jim 
Lonborg, who won two games with brilliant pitching in 1967 but was battered 
on two days' rest in the finale. For Carl Yastrzemski, who played on two 
teams that lost the Series in the seventh game. And for Bill Buckner, who 
had the grounder go between his legs in 1986."[12] He played a poignant 
and prominent role in the ceremony in which the World Series Championship 
Rings were handed out (April 11, 2005 before the Red Sox home season opener 
against the Yankees) – and he himself was awarded the World Series ring 
that had eluded him as a player and manager. Bill Simmons, who was present 
that day, wrote for ESPN in a column that was republished in Now I Can 
Die In Peace that Pesky received the biggest cheer as a living "reminder 
of everything that had happened since 1918." (As others had pointed out, 
not only had Pesky been the shortstop responsible during Slaughter's Mad 
Dash, but he had been born in 1918 and his wife was named Ruth.) With the 
help of Carl Yastrzemski, he raised the 2004 World Series Championship 
banner up the Fenway Park center field flagpole. After the Red Sox swept 
the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, Pesky once again received 
a ring and was given the honor of raising the newest Red Sox Championship 
banner on April 8, 2008. On his 87th birthday, September 27, 2006, the 
Red Sox honored Pesky by officially naming the right-field foul pole "Pesky's 
Pole", although it had already been unofficially known as such. On September 
23, 2008, the Red Sox announced that they would retire the No. 6 Pesky 
wore as a player to mark his 89th birthday and his long years of service 
to the club. (Pesky wore No. 22 as the team's manager in the 1960s, and 
No. 35 as a coach from 1975 to 1980. Although he reclaimed No. 6 and wore 
it from 1981 to 1984, between 1985 and its retirement the number also was 
assigned to players such as Bill Buckner, Rick Cerone, Damon Berryhill 
and Tony Peña.)[13] Pesky's was the sixth number retired by the Red Sox; 
his number retired was the first to break the club's code to have a number 
retired: being in the Baseball Hall of Fame and having spent at least ten 
years with the Red Sox (Pesky has not been selected for the Hall of Fame).[14] 
Pesky was a longtime resident of Boston's North Shore, living in Lynn and 
then Swampscott, Massachusetts.[15] He was a visible member of the community, 
making personal appearances for the Red Sox. For years, he was a commercial 
spokesman on television and radio for a local supplier of doors and windows, 
JB Sash and Door Company. The commercials were deliberately and humorously 
corny, with Pesky and the company's owner calling themselves "the Window 
Boys."[16] On May 16, 2009 Pesky was given an honorary degree during Salem 
State College's 199th commencement ceremony. On April 20, 2012, Boston 
Red Sox fans celebrated the 100th birthday of Fenway Park, and Johnny Pesky 
was a participant. He was wheeled out to second base in a wheelchair, aside 
Bobby Doerr, to join over 200 past Red Sox players and coaches through 
the decades. Pesky died on August 13, 2012, at the Kaplan Family Hospice 
House in Danvers, Massachusetts at the age of 93; he was buried next to 
his wife Ruth, who died in 2005. Many in Boston and in Red Sox Nation mourned 
his passing, and John Dennis began the first edition of the Dennis & Callahan 
Show on WEEI-FM in Boston after his death by saying that it had felt like
