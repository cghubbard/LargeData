Thomas Edgar Cheney (October 14, 1934 – November 1, 2001) was a Major League 
Baseball player. Cheney, a right-handed pitcher from Morgan, Georgia, played 
for the St. Louis Cardinals (1957, 1959), Pittsburgh Pirates, (1960–1961), 
and the Washington Senators (1961–1964, 1966) during his 8-year major league 
career. Tom Cheney is most notable for striking out the highest number 
of batters in a single MLB game. He did so on September 12, 1962, when 
as a Senator, he struck out 21 Baltimore Orioles in 16 innings en route 
to a 2-1 victory. Cheney was signed as an amateur free agent by the St. 
Louis Cardinals prior to the start of the 1952 baseball season. After spending 
a few years in the minor leagues, he was called up by the Cardinals in 
1957, and made his Major League Baseball debut with the team on April 21, 
1957. Cheney pitched in four games during the season, starting in three 
of them. He posted an 0–1 record with a 15.00 earned run average in 9 innings 
of work, giving up 6 hits, while walking 15 batters and striking out 10. 
The following year, 1958, Cheney did not play in baseball, as he was serving 
in the United States military. Cheney returned to baseball for the 1959 
season with the Cardinals, primarily serving as a relief pitcher in the 
11 games he pitched during the season. Cheney again had issues with his 
control and accuracy. He walked 11 men in just 11⅔ innings of work. He 
was 0-1 for the season, with a 6.92 ERA, along with giving up 17 hits and 
striking out 8 batters. On December 21, 1959, in the midst of the off-season, 
Cheney was traded by the St. Louis Cardinals with his teammate, outfielder 
Gino Cimoli, to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for relief pitcher Ron 
Kline. The Pirates hoped to make Cheney the starting pitcher with control 
and accuracy that they could depend on. Cheney progressed as a pitcher 
that season, and put up improved stats that season, pitching a 2–2 record 
in eleven games (eight as starting pitcher) with a decent 3.98 earned run 
average. Cheney only gave up 44 hits while walking 33 men and striking 
out 35 in 52 innings of work. As a pitcher, Cheney improved remarkably 
in his transition from the Cardinals to the Pirates. The 1960 Pittsburgh 
Pirates team went on to the World Series after posting an impressive 95-59 
record in the regular season. The Pirates defeated the New York Yankees 
four games to three games, winning the franchise's 3rd overall World Series, 
and first since 1925. The series was decided by a walk-off home run in 
the 9th inning of Game 7, when Bill Mazeroski took a 1-0 pitch and crushed 
it over the left field fence giving Pittsburgh the championship. Cheney 
served as a relief pitcher in the World Series and pitched four innings 
in three games (Game 2, 3, and 6), giving up four hits and two earned runs 
while only walking one batter and striking out six. In 1961, Cheney started 
off with a terrible performance, giving up 4 earned runs and walking 4 
batters in less than a third of an inning. Cheney was traded to the Washington 
Senators on June 29, 1961 in exchange for pitcher Tom Sturdivant. He served 
as both a starting pitcher and relief pitcher for the remainder of the 
season with the Washington Senators. He did not fare well, and he again 
showed signs of lack of control with his pitching. He posted a 1–3 record 
in 10 games, 7 of which he started. He put in 29⅔ innings of work and gave 
up 32 hits and 29 earned runs. He walked 26 batters and struck out 20. 
His earned run average ballooned to 8.79, giving him an ERA of 10.00 for 
the 1961 season. Nonetheless, Cheney was on the roster for the Washington 
Senators in 1962. Cheney pitched in 37 games in total, starting 25 of them. 
He pitched to a 7–9 record with four complete games and three shutouts 
and showed drastic improvement in all aspects of his pitching. He pitched 
stellarly in 173⅓ innings, giving up only 134 hits while walking 97 and 
striking out 147. His ERA for the season was a career-best 3.17. Cheney 
finished second in the American League in both strikeouts per nine innings 
and hits allowed per nine innings. 1962 was perhaps Cheney's best remembered 
season. On September 12, 1962, Tom Cheney set the Major League Baseball 
record for strikeouts in a regular-season game. Cheney pitched brilliantly 
in 16 innings of work, giving up only one run while striking out a record 
21 Baltimore Orioles. Cheney had 13 strikeouts through nine innings. Senators 
manager Mickey Vernon later wanted to make a change, reportedly asking 
the pitcher: "Your arm okay? You sure you don't want me to take you out?", 
to which Cheney replied . . "I told him I didn't want to come out", Cheney 
said. "Back in those days, you finished what you started." Cheney wound 
up pitching eight straight hitless innings near the end. With his 228th 
and final pitch, he slipped a called third strike past pinch-hitter Dick 
Williams, who went on to become a major league manager.[2] It was not until 
the bottom of the 16th inning that teammate Bud Zipfel hit the game-winning 
home run off Orioles pitcher Dick Hall giving the Senators a hard-fought 
2-1 victory and Cheney a win and a major league record that still stands 
today. To this day, Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens, Kerry Wood, and Max Scherzer 
have come threateningly close to Cheney's record, but all four have failed, 
each striking out 20 men in their respective 9-inning regulation games. 
Teammate Don Lock says of his gifts: Six days after his great performance, 
on September 18, 1962, Cheney suffered a setback at D.C. Stadium. Cheney 
gave up two home runs to Mickey Mantle and lost the game 7-1 to Ralph Terry 
and the New York Yankees (who would go on to win the 1962 World Series).[4] 
Cheney again pitched skillfully in 1963, a season that is probably considered 
his best season during his 8-year major league career. Cheney only pitched 
half the season, but finished with career-bests in wins, complete games, 
shutouts, and ERA. Cheney pitched in a total of 23 games that season, serving 
as the starting pitcher in 21 of them. He posted an 8–9 record, a 2.71 
ERA along with 7 complete games and 4 shutouts. Tom gave up just 99 hits 
in 136⅓ innings of work and dominated batters by walking only 40 and striking 
out 97. However, in July 1963, Cheney suffered a devastating elbow injury 
that played a major role in prematurely ending his major league career 
just after he was starting to appear as one of the premier pitchers in 
the American League.[4] Cheney played minimally with the Washington Senators 
in 1964 and 1966. He pitched in his last game on May 9, 1966. His daughter 
Terri Cook says of his career: "He was angry that he had such a great career 
one day and the next day it was gone. He pretty much blames that (record-breaking) 
game for the decline of this arm. When he pitched, he pitched hard."[5] 
In his career, Cheney started 71 games and came in for relief in 44 more. 
He finished with a 19–29 record, a 3.77 ERA, 13 complete games, 8 of which 
were shutouts. He picked up 2 saves, once in 1962 and again in 1964. Tom 
Cheney pitched in a total of 466 innings, giving up just 382 hits, while 
walking 245 and striking out 345. Tom Cheney died at the age of 67 on November
