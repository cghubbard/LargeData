French Lick is a town in French Lick Township, Orange County, Indiana, 
United States. The population was 1,807 at the 2010 census. In November 
2006, the French Lick Resort Casino, the state's tenth casino in the modern 
legalized era, opened, drawing national attention to the small town. However, 
it is best known as the hometown of basketball legend Larry Bird. French 
Lick was originally a French trading post built near a spring and salt 
lick. A fortified ranger post was established near the springs in 1811. 
On Johnson's 1837 map of Indiana, the community was known as Salt Spring. 
The town was founded in 1857.[6] The sulfur springs were commercially exploited 
for medical benefits starting in 1840. By the later half of the 19th century, 
French Lick was famous in the United States as a spa town. In the early 
20th century it also featured casinos attracting celebrities such as boxer 
Joe Louis, composer Irving Berlin and gangster Al Capone. Due to wartime 
travel restrictions, the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox held spring 
training in French Lick from 1943-1944; in 1945 the Cubs stayed in town 
while the White Sox moved to Terre Haute - utilizing Memorial Stadium. 
In order to conserve rail transport during World War II, 1943 spring training 
was limited to an area east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio 
River.[7] The French Lick Resort Casino was the focal point of most of 
the entertainment; the hotel remained open well after the casinos were 
closed down and the heyday of the town was well past. The resort closed 
for renovation in 2005. Pluto Water, a best selling laxative of the first 
half of the 20th century, was bottled here. It was also home to a large 
7-Up bottling facility, which ceased operations in the mid-20th century. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt announced his intention to run for president at a 
National Governors' Convention held at the French Lick Springs Hotel. The 
town is famous as the hometown of NBA great Larry Bird. Bird started for 
French Lick/West Baden's high school team, Springs Valley High School, 
where he left as the school's all-time scoring leader. In his later basketball 
career, one of Bird's nicknames was "the Hick from French Lick". French 
Lick is also the hometown of former Sacramento Kings head coach Jerry Reynolds, 
who currently works as the team's color commentator on its television broadcasts 
and is the Kings' director of player personnel. French Lick is located
