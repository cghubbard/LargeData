Virgil Oliver "Fire" Trucks (April 26, 1917 – March 23, 2013) was a starting 
pitcher and coach in Major League Baseball. From 1941 through 1958, Trucks 
played for the Detroit Tigers (1941–1943, 1945–1952, 1956), St. Louis Browns 
(1953), Chicago White Sox (1953–1955), Kansas City Athletics (1958) and 
New York Yankees (1958). He batted and threw right-handed. A native of 
Birmingham, Alabama, Trucks posted a 177–135 won-loss record with 1,534 
strikeouts and a 3.39 ERA in 2,682.2 innings pitched over a 17-year career. 
Trucks was a two-time All-Star and a two-time league leader in shutouts. 
In 1952, Trucks became the third major leaguer to throw two no-hitters 
in a season. After his playing career, Trucks coached for several years 
in the major leagues. At the time of his death in March 2013, he had been 
one of the oldest living former major league players. The Detroit Tigers 
signed Trucks as an amateur in 1938. In his first pro season, Trucks set 
a minor league record with 418 strikeouts. He also threw four no-hitters 
in the minors. He debuted with the Tigers in the fall of 1941. Trucks missed 
two seasons due to military service in World War II and was discharged 
from the Navy less than two weeks before his start in the second game of 
the 1945 World Series. Because of the circumstances, the leagues waived 
the rule requiring players to have been on the team's roster by September 
1 to qualify for post-season play. He defeated the Chicago Cubs in that 
game. (At the time of his death, he was the last living pitcher to face 
the Cubs in a World Series game.) The only other pitcher to win a post-season 
game without winning a regular season game is Chris Carpenter of the 2012 
St. Louis Cardinals. In 1949, Trucks was selected for the MLB All-Star 
Game and he led the league in shutouts and strikeouts. In 1952, despite 
a 5–19 record, Trucks became just the third major league pitcher to hurl 
two no-hitters in one season (two others have since matched the feat). 
He won both no-hitters by a score of 1-0, beating the Washington Senators 
on May 15 and the New York Yankees on August 25. In the 1953 season, Trucks 
recorded a 20-10 record, 149 strikeouts and a 2.93 ERA; he finished fifth 
in AL MVP voting. He had been traded early that season from the St. Louis 
Browns to the Chicago White Sox, becoming one of a small number of pitchers 
traded during a 20-win season. He earned his second All-Star distinction 
in 1954, a year in which he led the AL in shutouts for a second time. After 
retiring as a player, Trucks joined the coaching staff of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, winning the 1960 World Series with them against his old team, 
the Yankees. He continued coaching with the Pirates, then coached the Atlanta 
Braves and ended his MLB career with the Tigers in 1974.[1] Trucks was 
inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1974 and into the Michigan 
Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.[1][2] In the summer of 2012, Trucks was injured 
in a fall, but he made a recovery.[3] Trucks was the uncle of Butch Trucks, 
a founding member of the Allman Brothers Band. Trucks' great nephew, Derek, 
is also a former member of the now-retired Allman Brothers Band and has 
a band with his wife, Susan Tedeschi, Tedeschi Trucks Band.[4] In addition, 
several of Trucks' other relatives are accomplished musicians. Trucks died 
on March 23, 2013 at the age of 95 in Calera, Alabama.[5] He had been hospitalized 
with pneumonia shortly before his death. He is survived by his five children: 
Jimmy Trucks, Carolyn T Beckwith, Virgil Trucks Jr, Darryl Trucks and Wendy
