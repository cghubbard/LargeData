Yuki Yanagita (柳田 悠岐, Yanagita Yuki?, born October 9, 1988 in Hiroshima, 
Hiroshima, Japan) is a professional Japanese baseball player. He plays 
outfielder for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. Yanagita was a member of the 
2014 and 2015 Japan Series-winning Hawks teams. In 2015, Yanagita won the 
Pacific League MVP award after ranking at or near the top of the league 
in several offensive categories. Yanagita led both leagues with a .363 
batting average and led the Pacific League in runs (110), total bases (317), 
slugging percentage (.631), on base percentage (.469), and walks (88). 
He ranked second in hits (182) and stolen bases (32) and third in home 
runs (34, tied) and RBI (99).[1] With the exception of stolen bases, all 
of these stats were career highs, and Yanagita became the just the 10th 
player in either league to join the "Triple 3" club (.300 average, 30 home 
runs, 30 stolen bases).[2] After the season, Yanagita underwent a right 
elbow surgery and is expected to recover in time for the 2016 season.[3]
