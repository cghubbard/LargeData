Aaron Shawn Estes (born February 18, 1973) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher. After he attended Douglas High School in Minden, Nevada, he was 
offered a scholarship by Stanford University. He turned it down, however, 
in favor of signing with the Seattle Mariners after he was selected by 
the Mariners in the 1st round of the 1991 MLB Draft out of Douglas High 
School. He began his career with the Bellingham Mariners in "A" ball in 
1991. He then played with the Appleton Foxes, Arizona League Mariners and 
Wisconsin Timber Rattlers from 1992-1995. The Mariners traded Estes to 
the San Francisco Giants on May 21, 1995 for Salomón Torres. The Giants 
moved him through their farm system rapidly during the 1995 season, sending 
him to the Burlington Bees, San Jose Giants and Shreveport Captains. Estes 
made his Major League debut with the Giants on September 16, 1995, working 
5.1 innings as a starter against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He allowed five 
earned runs and collected the loss. He was 0-3 in three starts for the 
Giants that September. Estes returned to the minors to start the 1996 season 
with the Phoenix Firebirds, but was recalled to the Majors to start a game 
against the rival Los Angeles Dodgers on July 13. Estes worked seven shutout 
innings to record his first career victory. Estes had his best season as 
a professional in 1997, when he went 19-5 with a 3.18 ERA for the San Francisco 
Giants. He was selected to the NL All-Star team during this season. He 
also has 4 career home runs and 28 RBIs, including a grand slam in 2000. 
Before Madison Bumgarner in 2014, Shawn Estes had the distinction of being 
the first pitcher in Giants franchise history to hit a grand slam (on May 
24, 2000), even scoring two more runs in the 18-0 game. The Giants traded 
Estes to the New York Mets on December 16, 2001 for Desi Relaford and Tsuyoshi 
Shinjo. The Mets signed him to a 6.2 million dollar contract, avoiding 
arbitration.[1] On June 15, 2002, Estes found himself at the center of 
a controversy when he started against the New York Yankees against Roger 
Clemens. In 2000, Clemens had beaned Mets catcher Mike Piazza, followed 
by the incident in Game 2 of the 2000 World Series in which Clemens threw 
a broken bat at Piazza. With the fans standing in anticipation of the showdown, 
Estes' first pitch was a fastball that was about a foot behind Clemens. 
Estes would hit a two-run homer off Clemens in the fifth inning of the 
eventual 8-0 Mets win, setting off a loud roar from the sellout crowd of 
54,347 and derisive chants of "Ro-ger! Ro-ger!" Estes would ultimately 
start 23 games for the Mets, with a record of 4-9 and a 4.55 ERA, before 
he was traded again on August 15 to the Cincinnati Reds for Brady Clark, 
Raul González, Elvin Andújar and Pedro Feliciano.[2] He pitched in six 
games for the Reds, finishing 1-3 with a 7.71 ERA. Estes signed a 1-year 
deal with the Cubs in 2003. He was moved to the bullpen towards September 
due to his struggles on the mound.[3] He ultimately finished the season 
with a record of 8-11, 5.73 ERA in 28 starts. Estes signed a minor league 
deal with the Colorado Rockies in 2004.[4] He was named the Opening Day 
starter. He beat Randy Johnson on Opening Day 6-2, pitching 7 innings while 
allowing just 2 runs on 2 hits.[5] He would enjoy his first winning season 
since the year 2000, finishing the season with a record of (15-8, 5.84 
in 34 starts). Estes again signed a 1-year deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks 
in 2005, following his stint the previous season with the Rockies. He was 
placed on the DL in July with a stress fracture in his left ankle.[6] His 
season was cut short and he finished the season with a record of (7-8, 
4.80 in 21 starts). Estes signed a one-year deal with the San Diego Padres 
for the 2006 season[7] but made only one start before he was lost for the 
season due to Tommy John surgery.[8] Estes began his 2007 comeback with 
minor league appearances in Single-A, though he was soon promoted to Triple-A 
Portland. After his first start in Portland, Estes reaggravated his injured 
pitching elbow. He was placed on the disabled list retroactive to August 
6. On May 8, 2008, Estes finally returned to the Majors after missing most 
of the previous two seasons with injuries.[8] He started eight games for 
the Padres in 2008, finishing 2-3 with a 4.74 ERA. The Padres chose not 
to re-sign him after the season. On January 9, 2009, Estes signed a one-year 
minor league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers with an invitation to spring 
training.[9] He was expected to compete for the fifth starter position 
but pitched poorly in spring training games and was released on March 22.[10] 
However, after thinking about his options, he decided to stay with the 
Dodgers and report to minor league camp to attempt to transition into a 
situational reliever[11] The Dodgers assigned Estes to the AAA Albuquerque 
Isotopes to open the season, where he was 3-4 with a 3.08 ERA in 13 starts 
before announcing his retirement because he didn't want to pitch in AAA. 
On February 6, 2010, Estes signed a minor league contract with the Washington 
Nationals. On March 11, 2010, the Nationals released him.[12] After his 
release from the Nationals, he retired from baseball. On July 31, 2010, 
Estes was honored with a plaque on the Giants Wall of Fame along with former 
teammate Rich Aurilia.[13] Estes now co-hosts the Giants post game show 
on Comcast SportsNet Bay Area after every Giants game. Since 2011, Estes 
has also worked as a television color commentator for the Reno Aces of 
the Pacific Coast League. Shawn and his ex-wife Heather have two sons,
