Jeffrey James Reardon (born October 1, 1955) is an American former professional 
baseball relief pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 
1979–1994 for the New York Mets, Montreal Expos, Minnesota Twins, and Boston 
Red Sox, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, and New York Yankees. Reardon 
was nicknamed "The Terminator" for his intimidating presence on the mound 
and 98 mph fastball.[1] A long-time closer, Reardon became MLB's all-time 
saves leader in 1992 with his 342nd save, breaking Rollie Fingers' previous 
record of 341. Reardon's record was broken the following season by Lee 
Smith. Reardon currently ranks 9th on the all-time saves list with 367. 
Out of high school, Reardon was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 23rd 
round of the 1973 amateur draft, but did not sign. After playing college 
baseball for the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Reardon went undrafted 
and signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets in 1977 and was 
assigned to the Lynchburg Mets in the Single-A Carolina League.[2] Although 
undrafted, Reardon quickly made his way through the Mets' farm system, 
compiling a 30-9 record with a 2.68 ERA and 6 saves in 74 games combined 
between Lynchburg, Jackson in 1978, and Tidewater in 1979.[3] Reardon made 
his Major League debut with the Mets on August 25, 1979 and would stay 
in the majors for the rest of his career. He pitched for the Mets until 
mid-way through the 1981 season, working mostly as a middle reliever, when 
he was traded to the Montreal Expos along with outfielder Dan Norman for 
Ellis Valentine. Lacking a reliable closer on the big league staff, the 
Expos would immediately turn Reardon loose in the 9th inning and he responded 
by saving 146 games from 1982 to 1986. When with the Expos, Reardon suffered 
streaks of inconsistency, occasionally blowing two or three save opportunities 
in a row. During one bad streak in 1983, Montreal players' wives were invited 
to appear on the field, and the Expos' fans at Olympic Stadium booed his 
wife. During his time in Montreal, Reardon was named to the All-Star team 
twice (1985–1986), and led the majors in saves during the 1985 season, 
earning the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award. Prior to the start of 
the 1987 season, Reardon was again traded, this time to the Minnesota Twins 
along with catcher Tom Nieto, for pitchers Neal Heaton, Yorkis Pérez, and 
Alfredo Cardwood and catcher Jeff Reed. Although his performance dropped 
as compared to his previous five seasons, the trade would immediately pay 
dividends for the team as he would help the Twins win the 1987 World Series. 
The next season he reverted to form, was named to his third All-Star team, 
and became the first pitcher in Major League Baseball history to have 40-save 
seasons in both the American and National Leagues. After another good season 
in 1989, Reardon became a free agent and signed with the Boston Red Sox 
on December 6. In honor of Reardon's signing, his birthplace of Dalton, 
Massachusetts, named its athletic field after him.[4] After saving "only" 
21 games for the Red Sox in 1990, Reardon would be named to his fourth 
and final All-Star team in 1991 after another 40 save season. Reardon would 
break Rollie Fingers' all-time saves record in 1992 with his 342nd save. 
Later that season, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves, for starting pitcher 
Nate Minchey and minor league outfielder Sean Ross, where he pitched in 
his second World Series. However, the results would not be similar to 1987 
as he was responsible for two of Atlanta's four losses versus Toronto, 
blowing a save in Game 2 and giving up the winning hit in Game 3. Following 
the 1992 season, Reardon would again be a free agent and signed with the 
Cincinnati Reds. However, his days of closing were over as he would work 
as the setup man to Rob Dibble. Reardon finished the 1993 season with his 
highest ERA (4.09) since 1987 and his fewest saves (8) since 1981. Granted 
free agency, Reardon would sign with the New York Yankees on February 15, 
1994. Although he went north with the team, the writing was on the wall 
and Reardon would retire on May 4, 1994 after compiling an 8.38 ERA while 
allowing 17 hits over 9 2/3 innings in 11 games.[5] After his 16-year career, 
Reardon would retire second on the all-time saves list (to Lee Smith), 
finish with more saves (367) than walks (358), and was the only reliever 
to have more than 20 saves every year from 1982 to 1988.[1][6] After the 
end of his career, Reardon retired to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida at PGA 
National,[7] with his wife Phebe and three children Jay, Shane, and Kristi, 
turning down offers to coach in order to spend time with his family. Other 
than appearing as a corporate sponsor and speaker for Lerner Sports Marketing,[8] 
Reardon's retirement was uneventful. On February 21, 2004, Reardon learned 
that son Shane, who had long struggled with drugs and had been sent to 
the Academy at Swift River, a therapeutic boarding school in Massachusetts, 
for his senior year in high school, had died of a drug overdose at the 
age of 20.[9] Following this, Reardon spiraled down into depression, even 
trying to take his life, before seeking psychiatric help. Following a one-week 
stay in a clinic, Reardon was prescribed for half a dozen antidepressant 
and antipsychotic medications.[1] Then just before Christmas 2005, Reardon 
was diagnosed with a blocked artery in his heart which required the insertion 
of a heart stent, the second that Reardon had needed. Following surgery, 
Reardon developed a urinary-tract infection, requiring more medications. 
By this time, he was on over a dozen separate prescriptions, one of which 
was Levaquin, which is known to have side effects such as paranoia, anxiety 
and depression—further exacerbating his pre-existing conditions.[1] On 
December 26, 2005, Reardon was taken into custody and charged by the Palm 
Beach Gardens, Florida Police Department for allegedly committing armed 
robbery at a Hamilton Jewelers store at the Gardens Mall.[10] Reardon attributed 
his actions to the influence of the medications that he had been taking 
since his son died.[11][12] Soon after the episode at the mall and his 
release from an overnight stay in jail, Reardon returned to a psychiatric 
facility, and was an inpatient for nearly two months. His doctors drastically 
reduced his medications and began to administer electroshock treatments. 
However, Reardon still had to stand trial. Reardon was eventually found 
not guilty of the charges by reason of drug-induced insanity.[13] The judge 
ruled that because Reardon had been taking anti-depressants and mood stabilizers, 
and was distraught over his son's death, there was no reasonable explanation 
for the robbery. In addition, Reardon was not required to be committed
