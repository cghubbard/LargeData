In Major League Baseball, a player earns the Triple Crown when he leads 
a league in three specific statistical categories in the same season. The 
term "Triple Crown" generally refers to the batting achievement of leading 
a league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) over the 
same season.[1][2] The term "Pitching Triple Crown" refers to the pitching 
achievement of leading a league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average 
(ERA). The term "Triple Crown" is typically used when a player leads one 
league, such as the American League (AL) or the National League (NL), in 
the specified categories. A tie for a lead in any category, such as home 
runs, is sufficient to be considered the leader in that category. A "Major 
League Triple Crown" may be said to occur when a player leads all of Major 
League Baseball in all three categories. The term "Triple Crown" generally 
refers to the batting achievement. A batter who completes a season leading 
a league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) may be 
said to have won the "Triple Crown".[1] As the term, unless modified, connotes 
the batting achievement, it may not be necessary to refer to this as the 
"batting" Triple Crown. The Triple Crown reflects the ability of a batter 
to excel in three important ways: to hit safely a high percentage of the 
time (batting average); to hit the ball long distances (home runs); and 
to produce when runners are on base, driving them home to score (RBI). 
It is an uncommon feat to lead all batters in each of these categories. 
It has been accomplished 17 times, most recently in 2012, by Miguel Cabrera. 
Cabrera's was the first since 1967, when Carl Yastrzemski accomplished 
the feat. The most batting Triple Crowns won by a player is two. Rogers 
Hornsby was the first to accomplish it, winning his first in 1922 and then 
leading all major leagues in 1925 en route to his second Triple Crown, 
both with the St. Louis Cardinals.[3][4] Ted Williams later matched this 
mark in the AL, winning in 1942 and 1947 with the Boston Red Sox.[5][6] 
The Cardinals have won the most batting Triple Crowns as a franchise with 
four. Along with Hornsby's two, Tip O'Neill won in the now-defunct American 
Association in 1887 while the team was known as the St. Louis Browns,[7] 
and Joe Medwick added the Cardinals' fourth in 1937.[8] Eleven of the thirteen 
eligible players who have offensive Triple Crowns have been elected to 
the Hall of Fame.[9] Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they 
have "been retired five seasons" or deceased for at least six months,[10] 
which means currently active Miguel Cabrera, whose 2012 Triple Crown is 
the most recent, isn't yet eligible.[11] Baseball writer and ESPN contributor 
Tim Kurkjian believes the Triple Crown has become more difficult to win 
with the advent of more hitters who choose to specialize in either hitting 
for batting average or power.[12] A pitcher who leads the league in wins, 
strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA) may be said to have won the "Pitching 
Triple Crown".[13] The Pitching Triple Crown is not quite as rare as the 
batting feat. The pitching Triple Crown has been accomplished 38 times, 
including 8 since 1997. The most pitching Triple Crowns captured by one 
player is three, accomplished by three players. Grover Cleveland Alexander 
captured his first two in consecutive seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies 
(1915–1916), and won a third in 1920 with the Chicago Cubs. Alexander is 
the only pitching Triple Crown winner to win his titles with more than 
one team.[14][15][16] Walter Johnson won his three Triple Crowns with the 
first Washington Senators, leading the league in all three categories in 
1913, 1918, and 1924.[17][18][19] Sandy Koufax was the most recent to capture 
three Triple Crowns, winning his three within four seasons for the Los 
Angeles Dodgers (1963, 1965–1966); all of Koufax's crowns were Major League 
crowns (meaning he led both leagues in all three categories), the most 
for any player.[20][21][22] Other pitchers who have won multiple Triple 
Crowns include Christy Mathewson (1905 and 1908 New York Giants), Lefty 
Grove (1930 and 1931 Philadelphia Athletics), Lefty Gomez (1934 and 1937 
New York Yankees), and Roger Clemens (1997–1998 Toronto Blue Jays).[23] 
One pitcher, Guy Hecker, won a Triple Crown in a major league that is currently 
defunct; he led the American Association in wins, strikeouts, and ERA in 
1884 while pitching for the Louisville Colonels.[24] Eighteen of twenty-four 
eligible pitchers who have won a Triple Crown have been elected to the 
Hall of Fame.[25] Under the aforementioned eligibility rules for the Hall 
of Fame, four living pitchers who have been active since 2011 are ineligible 
for election. The Triple Crown winners who most recently became eligible 
for the Hall are Pedro Martínez and Randy Johnson. Both were elected to 
the Hall of Fame in 2015, each in their first year of eligibility.[26] 
The most recent Triple Crown winners for pitching are Clayton Kershaw and 
Justin Verlander, who won for the NL and AL respectively in 2011 (the first 
season since 1924 to see Triple Crown winners in both leagues).[27] The 
first Triple Crown winner was Tommy Bond, who won the NL pitching crown 
in 1877. The following year, Paul Hines won the first batting Triple Crown 
in the NL; he and Miguel Cabrera are the only two batting Triple Crown 
winners from the NL or the AL who are not in the Hall of Fame, although 
Cabrera is not yet eligible to be elected.[9][23] The highest home run 
and RBI totals by a batting winner were achieved by Mickey Mantle and Lou 
Gehrig, respectively; Mantle hit 52 home runs in 1956, and Gehrig batted 
in 165 runs in 1934, their only Triple Crown seasons. In the National League, 
Hornsby is the leader in home runs, with 42, and Medwick's 154 RBI lead 
as well. Hugh Duffy's .440 average in 1894 is the highest ever during a 
winning season, and the AL leader is Nap Lajoie (.426). Among the pitching 
triple crown winners, the lowest ERAs belong to Johnson (1.14 in the 1913 
AL) and Alexander (1.22 in the 1915 NL). Johnson is also the AL leader 
in wins (36), but Charles Radbourn's NL total is over 20 wins higher; his 
59 wins in 1884 are a Major League Baseball single-season record.[28] Radbourn 
also struck out 441 batters that season, the highest total for a Triple 
Crown winner; Pedro Martínez struck out 313 in the 1999 season to notch 
the highest strikeout total for an AL winner. The highest strikeout total 
for a Triple Crown winner in both the modern era (post-1900) and the live-ball 
era (post-1920) is Koufax's 382 in 1965, which was also a modern-era record
