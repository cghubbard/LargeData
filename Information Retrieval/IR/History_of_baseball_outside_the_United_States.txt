While much has been written about baseball in the United States, it was 
often played in numerous other countries. Today, baseball is a popular 
sport around the world. The International Baseball Federation (IBF) was 
founded in 1938, after the inaugural Baseball World Cup held in London. 
About 5 years later, the name of the federation was changed to Federacion 
Internacional de Beisbol Amateur (FIBA). In 1973, struggles in the FIBA 
led to a dissident organisation, the Federacion Mundial de Beisbol Amateur 
(FEMBA), which organised its own World Championships. The two organisations 
were reconciled in 1976, forming the International Baseball Association 
(AINBA). In 1984, the name of the federation was once again changed, this 
time to International Baseball Association (IBA). In 2000, the original 
name was assumed again, International Baseball Federation, now abbreviated 
to IBAF. The first World Cup (or World Championships) in baseball were 
held in 1938, as teams from the United States and United Kingdom played 
a series of five games. Britain won four and became the first baseball 
World Champion. After this championship, the IBF was founded (see above). 
World Cups have been played at irregular intervals ever since; the 36th 
took place in the Netherlands in September 2005. Until 1996 professional 
players were not allowed to participate in the World Cups; since then major 
league players generally have not participated because the tournaments 
have conflicted with regular season games. Below are listed the 39 World 
Cups held to date: The first Caribbean Baseball World Series was held in 
1949, involving teams from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Panama, and Venezuela. Cuban 
teams dominated the tournament, winning seven out of twelve titles. The 
first incarnation of the Caribbean Series was cancelled after the Cuban 
government abolished professional baseball in 1961. The Caribbean Series 
was revived in 1970, with teams from the Dominican Winter League, Mexican 
Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League and Venezuelan 
Professional Baseball League. The most successful franchise is Santo Domingo's 
Tigres del Licey, which has won ten Caribbean Series titles. Puerto Rico's 
Cangrejeros de Santurce (Santucre Crabbers) and the Dominican Republic's 
Águilas Cibaeñas have both won the title five times. In 2006, the first 
World Baseball Classic took place from March 3–20. The tournament, sanctioned 
by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF), was organized by Major 
League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association in cooperation 
with other professional leagues and player associations from around the 
world. The tournament was held before the start of domestic league play 
for many nations, allowing professional players from domestic leagues to 
participate. On March 20, Japan defeated Cuba 10-6 in the final held at 
Petco Park in San Diego to win the 2006 World Baseball Classic. In the 
2009 World Baseball Classic, Japan defeated Korea 5-3 in 10 innings in 
the final at Dodger Stadium on March 23, 2009 in Los Angeles, to win their 
second consecutive championship. Sometimes, baseball matches played during 
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 1904 are listed as demonstrations 
at the 1904 Olympic Games. However, most historians do not regard them 
like this; actually any sports competition held in St. Louis has received 
a predicate 'Olympic'. The first real Olympic appearance of baseball is 
in 1912, as a team from Västerås played against competitors from the U.S. 
track and field team at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden. The 
Olympics (United States) beat Västerås (Sweden), which played with some 
Americans borrowed from the opponent, 13–3. A second game was played later, 
which included decathlon star Jim Thorpe as a right fielder. In that Olympics 
beat Finland 6–3. Both teams were Americans. Baseball also made an appearance 
at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, American players facing a French 
team (the Ranelagh Club) in an exhibition game. The game lasted only four 
innings due to poor field conditions, the Americans leading 5-0 at the 
time.[1][2] The American media was quick to claim a victory both for the 
American team and for baseball as a sport.[3][4] For the 1936 Olympics, 
the German hosts had invited the United States to play a demonstration 
match against Japan. As Japan withdrew, the US sent two 'all-star' teams, 
named the 'World Champions' and the 'U.S. Olympics'. For a layman crowd 
of 90,000 (sometimes reported as 125,000), the World Champions won 6–5. 
There were plans for including baseball at the 1940 Olympics originally 
scheduled for Japan, but these plans were abandoned after Japan had to 
withdraw its bid because of the Second Sino-Japanese War. After World War 
II, a Finnish game akin to baseball, pesäpallo, was demonstrated at the 
1952 Olympics in Helsinki. Four years later, another demonstration of baseball 
took place at the Olympic in Melbourne, Australia. A team made up of servicemen 
from the U.S. Far East Command played Australia. Although initially with 
few spectators, during the match the crowd for the other athletic events 
entered the stadium, adding up to 114,000 spectators, which is reportedly 
still the biggest crowd to any baseball game ever. The match was won by 
the USA, 11–5. In 1964, the Olympic Games took place in Tokyo, Japan, where 
baseball was quite popular. A team of American college players—with eight 
future major league players—was fielded against a Japanese amateur all-star 
team. The Americans continued their Olympic winning streak, as they triumphed 
6–2. In 1981, baseball was granted the status of a demonstration sport 
for Los Angeles 1984, and rather than a single match, a full tournament 
would be organised. With the strong Cuban team absent due to the Soviet-led 
boycott the field consisted of: United States, Japan, South Korea, Dominican 
Republic, Canada, Taiwan, Italy and Nicaragua. The final was contested 
between Japan and the US, and the guests won 6–3, ending the American Olympic 
victory row. Another demonstration tournament was held in 1988 in Seoul, 
South Korea. Again, Cuba, the team that won all major international championships 
since 1984, boycotted the Games. In a field consisting of United States, 
Japan, South Korea, Puerto Rico, Canada, Taiwan, Netherlands and Australia, 
Japan and the US again reached the final. Helped by 4 RBIs and 2 homers 
from Tino Martinez, the United States won 5–3. At the 1986 IOC congress, 
it had been decided that the first official Olympic baseball tournament 
would be held in Barcelona, Spain in 1992. At the 117th IOC Session, delegates 
voted to remove baseball and softball from the 2012 Summer Olympics in 
London. While both sports' lack of major appeal in a significant portion 
of the world was a factor, Major League Baseball's unwillingness to have 
a break during the Games so that its players could participate (like the 
National Hockey League does during the Winter Olympic Games) also played 
a role in the decision. MLB officials have pointed out that a two-week 
break in mid-season would necessitate a major reshuffling of its schedule: 
either the season would have to begin in March and/or the World Series 
would run into November. (The dozen or so games could be made up by playing 
doubleheaders, but both the players' union and the owners are against this.) 
Others saw the move as an anti-American slap delivered by the Europeans 
on the IOC. Women's softball was particularly hit hard by this ruling as 
there are few other venues where female softball players have a chance 
to show their talents in front of such a large audience. This time, the 
strong Cuban team was present and it won all of its games, beating the 
US in the semi-finals 4-1, and routing Taiwan in the final 11-1. The United 
States was upset by Japan in the bronze medal match, losing 8-3. Final 
ranking: In 1996, in Atlanta, Cuba and the United States were set to meet 
in the final. While the Cubans won their semi-final match against Nicaragua, 
the United States once again stumbled over Japan and lost 11-2. In the 
final, Cuba retained its Olympic unbeaten status, winning the gold 13-9, 
while USA beat Nicaragua 10-3 for the bronze medal. Final ranking: For 
the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, professional players were 
allowed for the first time, although no Major Leaguers played for the US. 
Once again, Cuba was the hot favourite, but they were shocked in the round-robin 
phase by the Netherlands, who beat them 4-2 but failed to make the semi-finals. 
In the semi-finals, the United States narrowly beat South Korea, while 
Cuba edged Japan 3-0 for a third straight Olympic final. In that final, 
the United States upset the Cubans, beating them 4-0. Final ranking: Professional 
players were again allowed in the 2004 Olympics. Most notably, the United 
States baseball team did not participate after losing a qualifying game 
to Mexico. A number of Americans of Greek descent played for the host nation, 
however. Japan and Cuba went into the games as the favorites for the gold 
medal match, but a strong showing by Australia against Japan (Australia 
beat Japan 9-4 in the preliminary round and again 1-0 in the semi-finals) 
knocked Japan out of the race for the gold. Cuba ended up winning the gold, 
defeating Australia 6-2, while Japan took bronze, beating Canada 11-2. 
Final ranking: (full results) South Korea dominated the sport by playing 
nine games and having nine wins. South Korea played Japan in the semifinals 
and won the game with a result of 6–2, while Cuba defeated the United States 
and went on to play against South Korea in the finals with South Korea 
winning 3–2. In the bronze medal match, the United States defeated Japan 
with a final score of 8–4 leaving the United States to win the bronze. 
South Korea's win in the sport made it Asia's first nation in winning a 
golden medal in baseball in the Olympics. Final ranking: (full results) 
Only a small number of African countries are members of the IBAF, the members 
mostly concentrated in southern Africa and on the west coast of the continent. 
To date, the only country that has competed in international events is 
South Africa, which took part in three World Championships, and finished 
8th in the 2000 Olympics. Israel's baseball program was started by American 
immigrants in the 1970s. Over the years, baseball in Israel has grown and 
today players come from all population groups throughout the country. There 
are about 1,000 active players of all ages playing in 5 leagues and in 
about 80 teams, in 16 centers in Israel including Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, 
Ra’anana, Modiin, Bet Shmesh, Kfar Saba, Hashmonaim, Tel Mond, Ginot Shomron, 
Even Yehuda, Beer Sheba, and Yuvalim. In 2007, the Israel Baseball League 
played its one and only season.[5] The six league teams were the Tel Aviv 
Lightning, Netanya Tigers, Bet Shemesh Blue Sox, Petach Tikva Pioneers, 
Modi'in Miracle, and Ra'anana Express.[6] All the leagues games were played 
at three ballparks. The Yarkon Sports Complex, Gezer Field, and Sportek 
Baseball Field.[7] Israel national baseball team play at major international 
baseball tournaments. An Israel team played in the Qualifying Round of 
the 2013 World Baseball Classic, which was held in September 2012. Israel 
narrowly missed qualifying for the WBC after being defeated by Spain. In 
April 2013, Israel was the runner up at the PONY European baseball championships 
in Prague, Czech Republic for the 16 and under age bracket. In 1986, the 
Israel Association of Baseball (IAB) was formed as a non-profit organization 
for the development and promotion of baseball throughout Israel and in 
all sections of the population. The IAB is recognized by all the official 
Israeli sports bodies and by official international sports bodies such 
as the Confederation of European Baseball (CEB), the International Baseball 
Federation (IBAF) and Major League Baseball International (MLBI), as the 
governing body of baseball in Israel. The IAB is active in all areas of 
baseball in Israel including running the leagues and summer camp programs; 
training coaches and umpires; introducing baseball to schools and community 
centers; working to strengthen ties with communities worldwide; working 
with municipalities to improve the infrastructure for baseball; and more.[8] 
Baseball was introduced in Japan in 1872 and is currently among the country's 
most popular sports. The first professional competitions emerged in the 
1920s. The current league, Nippon Professional Baseball, consists of two 
leagues of 6 teams each. The country's national team has also been successful, 
having won two Olympic medals (bronze and silver), while the World Championships 
team never placed worse than 5th in its 13 appearances, winning second 
place once and third place three times. Recently, several Japanese players 
have also entered the U.S. major leagues, such as Hideo Nomo, Kazuhiro 
Sasaki, Ichiro Suzuki, Hideki Matsui, Kazuo Matsui, Tadahito Iguchi, Kenji 
Johjima, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish, and Masahiro Tanaka. Japan defeated 
Korea to become champions of the second World Baseball Classic on March 
23, 2009 in Los Angeles. Baseball was introduced in the Philippines shortly 
after the start of American rule in 1898. In 1954, the Philippines won 
the first Asian Baseball Championship, its only ever won. Since the 1960s, 
it struggled to keep up with Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese teams. 
While the Philippines remained high for an Asian country in the World Baseball 
Classic rankings, it is still trying to regain the glory days it once had. 
In 2005, the Philippines national baseball team won gold in the Southeast 
Asian Games. While Saudi Arabia has seen some minor success in the many 
entries they have sent to the Little League World Series their participants 
are almost exclusively American expatriates and children of the multi-national 
oil companies like Aramco. Adult baseball on a competitive level is virtually 
non-existent. Until 2013, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia both 
sent teams to compete in the Trans-Atlantic division of the Little League 
World Series European playoffs. The teams in this division were required 
to be majority foreign passport holders and, as in Europe, were the children 
of U.S. Military personnel who play in Leagues on U.S. military bases in 
Europe. It is known that a missionary, P. Gillett, introduced baseball 
in 1905 by making Hwangsung YMCA in Korea. There are evidences that show 
Japan has implemented a ball game called baseball even before that, in 
Japanese colonial period around 1873. However, those baseball games around 
1873 were for Japanese not Koreans, so many people say that the real Korean 
baseball started in 1905. South Korea was under Japanese colonial rule 
until the 1940s under the name of Joseon dynasty, and even during Japanese 
colonial period Koreans played baseball. In 1928, there was a first home 
run in Korea by a Joseon's sports star, Lee Young-min. He is known as a 
great player, so Korea Baseball Organization (KBO)[9] gives out an award 
called Lee Young-min batting award to a high school baseball player with 
the highest batting average every year since 1958.[10] Baseball of South 
Korea started becoming popular in the 1960s. In the 1970s, high school 
baseball league was popular on a national scale. The Korea Professional 
Baseball started in 1982 with six teams: MBC Chungyong, Lotte Giants, Samsung 
Lions, OB Bears, Haitai Tigers, Sammi Superstars. After that, Binggrae 
Eagles was established and added to a league in 1986, then Ssangbangwool 
Raiders in 1991. Korea Professional Baseball league has been composed of 
eight teams after that until 2012. In 2013, new team NC Dinos was added 
as the 9th team of the league. In 2015, another new team KT Wiz was added 
as the 10th team of the league. The first international game that the South 
Korean national baseball team participated was the first Asian Baseball 
Championship in 1954. In the 2000s, the Korean national baseball team had 
great records. They got Bronze medal at 2000 Sydney Olympics and the gold 
medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. They also did great 
in World Baseball Classic. In 2009, they got 2nd place in World Baseball 
Classic. Several Korean players now play in foreign countries. The first 
South Korean player to play in foreign country was Baek In-cheon. He signed 
the contract with Toei flyers in Nippon Professional Baseball in 1962. 
After that several players were scouted to Japan. The first player to play 
in the U.S. Major League Baseball was Park Chan-Ho. He was scouted to Los 
Angeles Dodgers in 1994. It was mostly pitchers who played in the foreign 
countries. The most famous among them are Sun Dong-Yeol, Choo Shin-Soo, 
Kim Byung-Hyun, Park Chan-Ho, Ryu Hyun-jin. Baseball has been played in 
Taiwan for more than 100 years. It was introduced by the Japanese who ruled 
the island from 1895 to 1945. In the days of Japanese colonial rule, baseball 
was known as yakyu, the Japanese word for baseball. The game was initially 
played only by Japanese. But they later promoted the sport around the island 
to improve the people's physical and mental health. The first official 
game played on the island was in March 1906 in Taipei City. Two local schools, 
precursors of today's Jianguo High School and the Taipei Municipal University 
of Education drew a 5-5 tie, opening the first page in the history of Taiwan 
baseball. Soon, other schools and business all over the island started 
to form teams. During its budding stage, however, most of the stronger 
baseball teams were from northern Taiwan, especially Taipei, the birthplace 
of the sport and home to several prominent schools and companies. The turning 
point came in 1931 when a team of students from southern Taiwan's Chiayi 
School of Agriculture and Forestry beat a team from northern Taiwan. The 
Chiayi team was made up of Japanese and Taiwanese students. Their victory 
meant that baseball had become a sport of the entire island. They also 
made Taiwan qualify for a national high school tournament at the Koshien 
Stadium in Japan where they won Second place over 600 high schools around 
Japan. The groundbreaking victory not only earned the Taiwanese baseball 
players greater respect from their Japanese counterparts, but also encouraged 
more people in Taiwan to play baseball, eventually making it Taiwan's national 
sport. After the Second World War, the baseball fever continued to spread 
even faster under the Kuomintang government. The sport gradually turned 
into a national symbol that united the country. What first brought Taiwan 
baseball worldwide fame was a bunch of little leaguers between the ages 
of 11 and 13. The Little League teams had done amazingly well and had dominated 
in the world competition held annually in Williamsport, Pennsylvania for 
decades. In the 27 years from 1969 to 1996, Taiwan won 17 Little League 
World Series Championships—an overall number second only to the United 
States and almost three times in comparison with the third place, Japan. 
As of 2009, Taiwan has participated in 20 Little League World Series Championships. 
The amazing performance of the local teams had built Taiwan into a new 
global stronghold for baseball. National teams had also begun to shine 
in the Summer Olympics after the sport was introduced as an event. The 
Taiwan team won the bronze medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the 
silver in 1992 in Barcelona. As the sport grew even more popular in Taiwan, 
especially with the Olympic medals, local baseballers formed the Chinese 
Professional Baseball League in 1989. The Uni-President Lions and the Brother 
Elephants played the league's first game at the Taipei Municipal Baseball 
Stadium on March 17, 1990. In 1997, the Taiwan Major League was founded 
because of a CPBL broadcasting rights dispute. But after running losses, 
the two leagues merged and Taiwan's total of six ball clubs were born. 
Despite some cases of game-fixing that would cause some disillusionment 
among fans, in the 18 years of its history, the league continued to run 
and is still the only professional sports league in Taiwan. As of 2009[update], 
the league consists of the Brother Elephants, La New Bears, Sinon Bulls, 
and Uni-President Lions. In 2002, slugger Chen Chin-feng signed by Los 
Angeles Dodgers making MLB debut which made him the first Taiwanese to 
play in the U.S.'s Major League Baseball. Four other Taiwanese baseball 
players were later drafted to play in the MLB. The most famous Taiwan-born 
player is the former New York Yankees' ace starter Wang Chien-ming whose 
44 wins from the beginning of the 2006 season to May 26, 2008 beat any 
major league pitcher during that stretch. Wang also holds the record as 
the Major League's quickest pitcher to reach 50 wins in two decades, earning 
him the name "Taiwan Glory." [11] Baseball has become so entrenched in 
Taiwanese culture that it is even depicted on the NT$500 note.[12][13] 
A European federation, the Confédération Européenne de Baseball (CEB, European 
Baseball Confederation) was founded in 1953. The federation organises all 
international competitions within Europe. These are the European Championships 
for country teams, divided into two divisions, and a number of club competitions: 
the European Cup, the Club Winners' Cup and the CEB Cup. All of the European 
competitions have been dominated by only two countries: Italy and the Netherlands. 
They share 25 of the 27 European titles between them, the other titles 
being won by Belgium and Spain, both times in absence of one or two of 
the two usual winners, but these countries have medalled regularly as well. 
Other countries that are among the top players in Europe are Russia, France 
and the Czech Republic. Most of the club titles have also been won by Dutch 
or Italian teams. Italian Baseball League competition did not start until 
after World War II, as Bologna won the first title in 1948. The Italian 
team has won 8 European titles, among which the very first title, and the 
team has fought out many finals with archrival the Netherlands. Because 
of the large number of Americans of Italian descent, there are always a 
few players in the national team with double nationality, the most notable 
of which is catcher Mike Piazza. The Italian national team have competed 
at all three Olympics, finished 6th twice. Best World Championships showing 
was a fourth place, in 1998. Baseball began relatively early in Spain thanks 
to the descendants of returnee immigrants from Cuba. They brought the sport 
along with them when Cuba ceased to be a Spanish Colony. The heyday of 
baseball in Spain was in the 1950s and early 1960s when public interest 
was high and many teams were created, like Pops CB, a team that included 
junior teams.[14] But because of the growing mass-interest in football, 
most baseball clubs didn't survive into the 1970s. The Spanish public's 
massive shift in focus was triggered fundamentally by the introduction 
of multiple TV channels that focused mainly on the soccer matches of "La 
Liga", the professional First Division Spanish League. One of the few survivors 
of that fateful decade for Spanish Baseball was the Club Beisbol Viladecans. 
Its field was officially used during the 1992 Summer Olympics. Presently 
the Spanish baseball league is divided into divisions. The top teams play 
in the División de Honor de Béisbol. One of the two major European baseball 
nations, the Netherlands saw baseball for the first time shortly after 
1900. A baseball federation (the KNBSB) was founded in 1912, and the Holland 
Series was established in 1922, the first winner being A.H.C. Quick from 
Amsterdam. Today, an eight team professional league, the Honkbal Hoofdklasse 
(Major League Baseball) sends its teams to the Holland Series. The Netherlands 
have won 15 European Championship titles, one world title, and participated 
in the Olympics twice, finishing fifth in Summer Olympics after upsetting 
the Cuban team. Some of the players in the Dutch team are actually from 
the Netherlands Antilles. Four Dutch players have played in the Major Leagues. 
Andruw Jones, Jurickson Profar and Jonathan Schoop are from the Netherlands 
Antilles. The World Port Tournament and the Haarlemse Honkbalweek are biannual 
international tournaments for national and club teams, organised in the 
cities of Rotterdam and Haarlem, respectively. American Baseball was introduced 
to the UK in 1874 by Albert Spalding, an American Baseball entrepreneur, 
although this tour did not live long in the memory. The 1889 Tour was seen 
as more of a success. From here him and Francis Ley were instrumental in 
setting up the National Baseball League of Great Britain. Ley would later 
run Derby Baseball Club. Baseball's peak popularity in Britain was in the 
years immediately preceding World War II. Baseball teams shared grounds 
with football clubs (hence Derby County's home ground was named the Baseball 
Ground), and the game was run at a professional standard with up to 10,000 
spectators per game. One milestone of baseball in the United Kingdom was 
the 1938 victory of Great Britain over the United States to win the inaugural 
World Cup of Baseball. There is currently no professional baseball in the 
United Kingdom. An unusual variation of the game, known as British baseball 
is played in parts of England and Wales. It involves 11 players per team 
and shares some terminology with cricket. There is also rounders, a baseball-like 
game played mostly at schools and amongst friends. Great Britain competed 
in the qualifying rounds of the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Baseball in 
North America is a very popular sport. It is very popular in the United 
States and in Mexico. In countries in Central America it is very popular 
probably because of US influence. In Mexico it is very popular and is the 
prominent sport of the country after soccer. It is also the most popular 
sport in Nicaragua and Panama with the game also popular on the Caribbean 
coast of Colombia. Both Nicaragua and Colombia operate professional winter 
leagues, while Panama was invited to the inaugural 2006 World Baseball 
Classic. In Canada, the sport is often played and watched during summer 
months, and one of the most popular games behind ice hockey. The first 
baseball game recorded in Canada was played in Beachville, Ontario on June 
14, 1838. Many Canadians, including the staff of the Canadian Baseball 
Hall of Fame and Museum in St. Marys, Ontario, claim that this was the 
first documented game of modern baseball, although there appears to be 
no evidence that the rules used in this game were codified and adopted 
in other regions. The London Tecumsehs of London, Ontario were charter 
members of the International Association and won its first championship 
in 1877, beating the Pittsburgh Alleghenies. Babe Ruth hit his first professional 
home run on Canadian soil on September 5, 1914 at the former ballpark at 
Hanlans Point on Centre Island in Toronto. Ruth was playing for the Providence 
Grays against the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of the International 
League. In 1985, the City of Toronto erected a small plaque to denote the 
location, but it is difficult to locate, given the parklike setting and 
remote nature of the Toronto Islands. In 1946, Brooklyn Dodgers general 
manager Branch Rickey assigned new signing Jackie Robinson to the Montreal 
Royals of the International League, Brooklyn's Triple-A farm team. Robinson 
would famously go on to break Major League Baseball's color barrier the 
following year in 1947, but during his season in Montreal Robinson led 
the Royals to the Governors' Cup, the IL championship, and became a beloved 
figure in the city. In Ken Burns' documentary film Baseball, the narrator 
quotes Sam Maltin, a stringer for the Pittsburgh Courier: "It was probably 
the only day in history that a black man ran from a white mob with love 
instead of lynching on its mind." In 1957, former Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia 
Phillies outfielder Glen Gorbous, a native of Drumheller, Alberta set the 
current world record for longest throw of a baseball at 445 feet, 10 inches 
(135.89m) in Omaha, Nebraska. The lone Canadian in the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame is Ferguson Jenkins, a right-handed pitcher who compiled a 
284-226 record, 3.34 ERA and 3,192 strikeouts in 19 seasons from 1965 to 
1983 with the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, and Boston 
Red Sox. Jenkins is considered an anchor of the Black Aces, a group of 
African American pitchers with at least twenty wins in one season (although 
Jenkins is actually a Black Canadian, not African American). While baseball 
is widely played in Canada, the American major leagues did not include 
a Canadian team until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National 
League (the London Tecumsehs were refused admission to the National League 
in 1877 because they refused to stop playing exhibition games against local 
teams). The team enjoyed a widespread following until about 1994 (when 
the Expos were in first place in the NL East); after the strike shortened 
year a series of poor management decisions, disputes with the city, and 
neglect by the ownership caused the Expos to be routinely last in MLB attendance. 
In 2004, the Expos, then owned by MLB itself, moved to Washington, D.C. 
and became the Washington Nationals. Gary Carter, a popular player in Montreal 
along with Andre Dawson are members of the Hall of Fame whose plaques have 
an Expos cap on. In 1977, the Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League. 
They won the World Series in 1992 and 1993. In 2003 an attempt to create 
the Canadian Baseball League was launched, but the league folded halfway 
through its first season. A few Canada-based teams play in low-tier American 
circuits. Some of these teams such as the Winnipeg Goldeyes draw crowds 
of 7,000 on a regular basis, making them one of the highest attended low-tier 
baseball teams in all of North America. See List of baseball teams in Canada. 
Baseball was introduced to Cuba in the 1860s by Cubans who studied in the 
United States and American sailors who ported in the country. The sport 
quickly spread across the island nation. Nemisio Guillo is credited with 
bringing a bat and baseball to Cuba in 1864 after being schooled in Mobile, 
Alabama. Two more Cubans were sent to Mobile, one being his brother Ernesto 
Guillo. The Guillo brothers and their contemporaries formed a baseball 
team in 1868—the Habana Baseball Club. The club won one major match—against 
the crew of an American schooner anchored at the Matanzas harbour. [15] 
Soon after this, the first Cuban War of Independence against its Spanish 
rulers spurred Spanish authorities in 1869 to ban playing the sport in 
Cuba [15] because Cubans began to prefer baseball to viewing bullfights, 
which Cubans were expected to attend dutifully as homage to their Spanish 
rulers in an informal cultural mandate. As such, baseball became symbolic 
of freedom and egalitarianism to the Cuban people. The ban also prompted 
Esteban Bellán to join the semipro Troy Haymakers. He became the first 
Latin American player to play in a Major League in the United States. Bellan 
started playing baseball for the Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club, while 
attending St. John's College (1863–1868, now Fordham University) in the 
Bronx, New York. After that he played for the Union of Morrisania, a team 
from what is now part of New York City. Bellan played for the Haymakers 
until 1862; in 1861 it joined the National Association.[16] The first official 
match in Cuba took place in Pueblo Nuevo, Matanzas, at the Palmar del Junco, 
December 27, 1874. It was between Club Matanzas and Club Habana, the latter 
winning 51 to 9, in nine innings. In late 1878 the Cuban League was organized, 
consisting of three teams—Almendares, Habana, and Matanzas—and playing 
four games per team. The first game was played on December 29, 1878, with 
Habana defeating Almendares 21 to 20. Habana, under team captain Bellán, 
was undefeated in winning the first championship. The teams were amateurs 
(and all whites), but gradually professionalism took hold as teams bid 
away players from rivals. The Spanish–American War brought increased opportunities 
to play against top teams from the United States. Also, the Cuban League 
admitted black players beginning in 1900. Soon many of the best players 
from the Northern American Negro Leagues were playing on integrated teams 
in Cuba. Beginning in 1908, Cuban teams scored a number of successes in 
competition against major league baseball teams, behind outstanding players 
such as pitcher José Méndez and outfielder Cristóbal Torriente. By the 
1920s, the level of play in the Cuban League was superb, as Negro League 
stars like Oscar Charleston and John Henry Lloyd spent their winters playing 
in Cuba. During the Great Depression, the Cuban League came close to bankruptcy. 
The revolution which overthrew the administration of Gerardo Machado forced 
the cancellation of the 1933-34 season. When the league resumed play, it 
was without black American ballplayers and many of its Cuban stars who 
departed for the Negro Leagues, most notably pitcher-outfielder Martín 
Dihigo. The League's financial situation improved over the course of the 
decade, enabling it to attract many star players from the Negro League, 
including power-hitting catcher Josh Gibson, shortstop Willie Wells and 
third baseman Ray Dandridge, as well as white Latin American Major Leaguers, 
including the great Venezuelan pitcher Alex Carrasquel. World War II resulted 
in new travel restrictions cutting off the flow of ball-players from the 
U.S. The end of the wartime player shortage resulted in pay cuts in the 
U.S. major leagues, leading many players to sign contracts with Cuban League 
and the newly formed Mexican League. In 1946, a record 36,000 fans attended 
the opening of the Gran Estado del Cerro (now known as Estadio Latinoamericano) 
in Havana. The 1946–47 season included a number of major leaguers, including 
Lou Klein and Max Lanier, alongside such great Cuban ballplayers as Orestes 
(Minnie) Miñoso, Connie Marrero, Julio Moreno, and Sandalio (Sandy) Consuegra. 
Efforts to control the flow of players to Latin America culminated in a 
1947 agreement with the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues 
to bring minor and major league players to Cuba during the winter off-season 
in the U.S. Cuba League champions dominated the Caribbean Series, which 
began in 1949. The Havana Cubans, a team formed by a Washington Senators 
scout in 1946, joined the International League as a farm team of the Cincinnati 
Reds in 1954, when they were renamed the Havana Sugar Kings. Despite encountering 
discrimination on the basis of language and race, many Cuban ball-players 
had success in the Major Leagues, including pitcher Camilo Pascual and 
former Negro League first baseman Minnie Miñoso. In 1959, the year Fidel 
Castro seized power in the Cuban Revolution, the Havana Sugar Kings won 
the International League championship, and captured the Little World Series 
by defeating the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. Castro 
was an avid fan of the Sugar Kings, and pitched for a pickup squad Los 
Barbudos in an exhibition game on July 24, 1959. However, the following 
day, gunfire erupted in the stadium during raucous celebrations on the 
anniversary of the 26th of July Movement, forcing the cancellation of the 
Sugar Kings season. The following year, after Castro announced the nationalization 
of all American-owned enterprises, the Baseball Commissioner announced 
the Sugar Kings would be relocated to Jersey City. In 1961, professional 
sports were abolished, and the Cuban League was replaced by the amateur 
Cuban National Series. Havana's Industriales, founded by workers representatives 
from the cities industries and intended as heir to Almandares club, dominated 
the league, winning four of the first five championships. Initially consisting 
of four teams, by 1967 the number had increased to 16, with the construction 
of new stadiums in all of the nation's provincial capitals. Industriales, 
with most of the top-tier ballplayers from Havana, has remained the strongest 
team, but Santiago de Cuba, Villa Clara and Pinar del Río have also experienced 
considerable success. Many talented players were raised and trained in 
Cuba and then recruited to the major leagues in the United States. Some 
of the more famous modern players are José Contreras, Orlando Hernández, 
and Liván Hernández. These players make very good money for their talents, 
but this was not always the case. From the 1930s through the 1950s many 
American scouts went to Cuba to find inexpensive recruits.[17] During this 
time period many talented Cuban players were recruited, signed contracts 
and were locked into little or no money. In 1961, due to severed diplomatic 
relations with Cuba, one of the major league's main sources of foreign 
players was cut off.[18] This has limited the amount of Cuban players migrating 
to the United States to play baseball. The US major league baseball clubs 
are in hopes that in the near future they will be able to recruit players 
from Cuba again.[19] This can and will deeply affect baseball as it is 
played in Cuba today. In the United States, Cuban players such as Liván 
Hernández can make million dollar salaries, while players in Cuba will 
make less than thirty dollars a month.[20] Cuba cannot compete with major 
league wages and this already has shown an impact. Although salaries are 
the same for all of the Cuban baseball players, some of the best Cuban 
players can get perks or gifts from the Cuban government. These can be 
anything from a vacation, to a car, unlimited expense accounts at restaurants, 
or something as small as movie tickets. The problem with these gifts is 
that they are very unpredictable and players often complain about the gifts.[21] 
Cuba has lost many talented players since the 1990s due to defection because 
the money can be very good.[22] Baseball was first brought to the Dominican 
Republic by Cuban sugar planters who arrived in the country in the 1870s, 
fleeing the Ten Years' War on their home island, and built the nation's 
first mechanized sugar mills. Cuban sugar planters began providing baseball 
equipment to their workers as a diversion to keep up morale. Much of the 
labor force of the sugar industry was made up of migrants from the British 
West Indies, and were familiar with cricket. Several semi-professional 
baseball clubs were founded in the early 20th century, most notably Santo 
Domingo's storied Tigres del Licey. The U.S. occupation from 1916 to 1924 
resulted in further inroads, as military administrators provided money 
to form and purchase equipment for amateur clubs, while organizing games 
between Dominican clubs and U.S. Marines. Towards the end of the occupation, 
professional baseball took on the shape and structure it retains today, 
with two teams in Santo Domingo—Tigres del Licey and Leones del Escogido—and 
one each in San Pedro de Macorís, La Romana and Santiago. Generalissimo 
Rafael Trujillo came to power in 1930 and quickly sought to consolidate 
control over the national economy. While not a baseball fan himself, his 
family were avid baseball fans, and, seeking to bolster his regime, he 
acquired Licey. In 1936, the Estrellas Orientales of San Pedro de Macorís 
defeated Licey in the national championship. Afterwards, Trujillo merged 
Licey and Escogido into one team, the Ciudad Trujillo Dragones. To counter 
this, San Pedro signed the three top players from the Negro League powerhouse 
Pittsburgh Crawfords-pitcher Satchel Paige, catcher Josh Gibson and centre 
fielder Cool Papa Bell—but, upon arriving in the country, they were detained 
by Trujillo and forced to suit up for the Dragones. Santiago's Águilas 
Cibaeñas later signed several Cuban Negro League players, including pitcher 
Luis Tiant, Sr. (father of the Red Sox pitcher of the same name) and pitcher/outfielder 
Martín Dihigo. The Dragones defeated Santiago and San Pedro to win the 
1937 championship, but the vast amounts of money used to finance the season 
bankrupted the other owners, and ended professional baseball in the Dominican 
Republic for ten years. Attention shifted to the amateur national teams 
the country assembled, using a unit of the Dominican army as Trujillo's 
personal farm club. The first wave of Dominican ballplayers to play professionally 
in the Major Leagues, including Ozzie Virgil, Sr., the Alou brothers—Felipe, 
Matty and Jesus—and Hall-of-Fame pitcher Juan Marichal emerged from Trujillo's 
amateur teams. Professional baseball resumed in 1951 as a winter league 
of the U.S. Major Leagues, with the old alignment still in place. In 1955, 
construction was completed on Santo Domingo's Estadio Quisqueya, shared 
home to rivals Tigres del Licey and Leones del Escogido. This alignment 
has largely remained intact, although an expansion team in San Francisco 
de Macorís was founded in 1996. Licey and Aguilas have been the most successful 
teams in the Dominican Winter League, both winning nineteen titles. Their 
fierce rivalry reflects the competition between the countries two main 
cities, the capital of Santo Domingo and Santiago, the largest city and 
unofficial capital of the northern part of the country. Leones del Escogido 
have won thirteen titles and are reigning Dominican Republic champions 
in 2010. On an international level, the Dominican Republic is currently 
the world's largest exporter of baseball players. In every season since 
1999, Dominicans have comprised at least 9% of active MLB rosters, more 
than any other nationality except Americans. More recently, many Dominicans 
have also begun to play in the Nippon Professional Baseball leagues in 
Japan and the Mexican League, the largest summer leagues outside of the 
United States and Canada. Nevertheless, the success of the Dominican Republic 
national baseball team has never matched the promise held by the island 
country's production of baseball talent. The team experienced its most 
embarrassing moment in recent history when it was upset twice by the Netherlands 
in theIR 2009 World Baseball Classic. These losses eliminated the Dominicans, 
regarded as tournament favorites, in the first round. However, in 2013 
they made up for the 2009 loss by eliminating the Netherlands at the semifinals 
and becoming the first undefeated champion of the event with a score of 
8-0.[23][24] Baseball began in Puerto Rico in 1896. A Puerto Rican that 
was born in Brooklyn, Amos Iglesias Van-Pelt, started practicing a group 
of men, some of them Cuban students who already knew the game from back 
home. Two years later, January 9, 1898, the first official game was held 
at the Velodromo, Stop 15, Santurce. The Cubans formed a team known as 
Almendares and the Puerto Rican ball club was named Borinquen with Amos 
Iglesias Van-Pelt on the mound. After three innings, the game was postponed 
by rain. Games kept going until March of that year because of the advent 
of the Spanish–American War, stopping all baseball activities until November 
1899. Besides Australia and New Zealand, some of the island nations in 
the Pacific have baseball federations, especially those with American or 
Japanese backgrounds, such as Guam or Saipan. The only country from the 
region which has participated in major international competitions is Australia. 
The first noted baseball game in Australia was played in 1869.[25] This 
game, played at The Old Lonsdale Cricket Ground, near the Botanical Gardens 
is the first reference in Melbourne newspapers: The first match of the 
Baseball Club will be played on the old Lonsdale Cricket ground, near the 
Botanieal-gardens-bridge, at half-past two o'clock this afternoon. This 
game is as popular in America as cricket is here, and as to-day will witness 
its first trial in the colonies it will no doubt prove attractive to lovers 
of out-door sports. However, there are suggestions of earlier games on 
the Victorian goldfields (possibly amongst American miners chasing wealth 
on Victorian fields) and a passing reference in the Tasmanian Colonial 
Times and Tasmanian of 22 September 1855. On this occasion, complaint was 
made of the intrusion on the sabbath of players of sports including baseball. 
At the end of the 19th century, Americans also tried to set up baseball 
leagues and competitions in Australia, with some success. A national league 
was initiated in 1934, and the national team entered World Championship 
competition in the late 1970s. Prior to winning the silver medal at the 
2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Australia had finished 7th in the Olympics 
twice, which is also the highest position reached in World Championships. 
A national-level competition still exists, as well as lower-level club 
competitions, but the game attracts comparatively little spectator or media 
interest. Several Australians, however, have attracted the attention of 
American scouts and have moved on to play in the major leagues in the United 
States and Japan. The revived Australian Baseball League began again in 
2010-11 season. Albert Spalding's team of All-Stars in 1888 is the first 
known baseball game played in New Zealand. Since that time, various local 
competitions have existed, but it wasn't until 1989 that the New Zealand 
Baseball Association was formed, consisting of teams in the Auckland area. 
It would be 14 more years before baseball would venture out of Auckland 
with the creation of the Canterbury Baseball Club in 2003. 2006 saw the 
Northland Baseball Club and the Manawatu Baseball Club form. New Zealand 
competes in Baseball Confederation of Oceania (BCO) events, most recently 
the AA Oceania championships. New Zealand also sends a senior team each 
year to Australia to compete in the Australian Provincial Championship. 
A number of New Zealanders are playing professionally in the United States. 
Scott Campbell was the first New Zealander drafted in the MLB draft, when 
he was selected in the 10th round by the Toronto Blue Jays in 2006.[26] 
In 2011 New Zealand will be hosting the Baseball Oceania AA IBAF Qualifying 
Round, in which Australia and Guam will compete against New Zealand for 
the right to participate in the 2011 IBAF AA World Cup in Mexico. Another 
addition to the tournament is Curtis Granderson, centre-fielder to the 
New York Yankees, will make an appearance to promote Baseball around the 
minor-code nation. In the early 20th century, American immigrants working 
on the implementation of electricity and phone lines in Brazil introduced 
baseball to the country. At the same time, the Japanese immigrants popularized 
the sport in the states of São Paulo and Paraná. In the 1910s, the country 
had an amateur league. Popularity waned during World War II, as the Brazilian 
government vetted public demonstrations of the culture of Axis powers countries, 
and the Japanese colony was still the biggest baseball market. Afterwards, 
a São Paulo confederation was founded in 1946, and in the 1960s and 1970s 
Japanese companies with Brazilian operations funded visits of the baseball 
national teams of traditional countries such as the United States, Japan 
and Panama. Baseball is still mostly restricted to Japanese Brazilians, 
some of whom wound up playing on Nippon Professional Baseball or the Japanese 
minor leagues.[27] Yan Gomes, drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in 2009, 
became in 2012 the first Brazilian-born player in the MLB.[28] The Blue 
Jays had previously signed two Brazilians on their minor league affiliates, 
José Pett and Jo Matumoto.[29] The Brazilian governing body of baseball 
is the Confederação Brasileira de Beisebol e Softbol, founded in 1990. 
Baseball was introduced in Venezuela at the end of the 1910s and at the 
beginning of the 1920s by American immigrants and workers from the exploding 
oil industry. Baseball's definitive explosion in Venezuela was in 1941, 
following the worldwide championships in Havana when the national team 
beat Cuba in the finals. This team was consecrated by the press and the 
fans as "Los Héroes del '41" (The Heroes of '41). The game was played in 
an amateur and disorganized form until December 27, 1945, when the owners 
of the Caracas Brewers (present day Caracas Lions or Leones del Caracas), 
Vargas, the Magallanes Navigators (Navegantes del Magallanes), and Venezuela 
created the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. On January 12, 1946, 
the first champion was crowned, Sabios del Vargas. In 1962, the La Guaira 
Sharks (Tiburones de La Guaira) are brought into the league to replace 
Pampero. In 1964, the league added two more teams, the Lara Cardinals (Cardenales 
de Lara) and the Aragua Tigers (Tigres de Aragua). In 1969, the Zulia Eagles 
(Águilas del Zulia) are brought into the league to replace the Valencia 
Industrymen (Industriales de Valencia); the original Venezuela team. In 
1991, the league expanded to 8 teams from 6, with the additions of the 
Eastern Caribbeans (Caribes de Oriente) who are now the Anzoátegui Caribbeans 
or (Caribes de Anzoátegui); and the Cabimas Oil Tankers, who became the 
Llanos Shepherds (Pastora de los Llanos) and since the 2007/08 season are 
the Margarita Braves (Bravos de Margarita). For the 2007–2008 seasons, 
the West Division (Division Occidental) and the East Division (Division 
Oriental) were merged in one single division of 8 teams. Each team plays 
9 games against the other 7 teams, for a total of 63 games. In recent years, 
Tigres de Aragua has become the most dominant team of the league, winning 
the crown 4 times in 5 years. Leones del Caracas is the most successful 
Venezuelan team, champion of the league 19 times (3 times as "Cervecería
