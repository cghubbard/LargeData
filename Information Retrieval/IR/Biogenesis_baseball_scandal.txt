The Biogenesis baseball scandal broke in 2013 when several Major League 
Baseball (MLB) players were accused of obtaining performance-enhancing 
drugs ("PEDs"), specifically human growth hormone, from the now-defunct 
rejuvenation clinic Biogenesis of America.[1] After an ex-employee annoyed 
over missing back-pay revealed clinic records that were "clear in describing 
the firm's real business: selling performance-enhancing drugs",[2][3] MLB 
sued six people connected to Biogenesis, accusing them of damaging the 
sport by providing banned substances to its players.[3] In July, thirteen 
involved players received lengthy suspensions of fifty or more games (nearly 
a third of a season). Biogenesis of America was a health clinic briefly 
operating in Coral Gables, Florida, specializing in weight loss and hormone 
replacement therapy.[4] It was first registered in state corporation records 
in March 2012,[5] and was founded by Anthony Bosch (also listed as the 
program director).[5][6] His father, Dr. Pedro Bosch, was listed as the 
medical director, and Bosch's younger brother, attorney Ashley Bosch, was 
listed as managing member.[5] Porter Fischer was listed as marketing director.[7] 
Several employees quit in the fall of 2012 after they were not paid,[5] 
and the clinic closed months later in December 2012.[3] On January 22, 
2013, the Miami New Times obtained documents from former Biogenesis employee 
Porter Fisher which it said linked three players – Melky Cabrera, Bartolo 
Colón and Yasmani Grandal – who had tested positive for performance-enhancing 
drugs in 2012 to the clinic. Additionally, the paper said several star 
players including Alex Rodriguez, Ryan Braun, and Nelson Cruz could be 
tied to the clinic. The paper, however, refused to hand the documents over 
to Major League Baseball (MLB) authorities.[8] The Florida Department of 
Health, and MLB, both targeted the clinic's owner, Anthony Bosch, each 
separately taking action against him. In March, MLB sued Bosch, and his 
business partners, Carlos Acevedo, Ricardo Martinez, Marcelo Albir, and 
Paulo da Silveira in an attempt to obtain information. The suit alleged 
that the six had "actively participated in a scheme ... to solicit or induce 
Major League players to purchase or obtain PES (performing-enhancing substances)".[8] 
Subsequently, the MLB claimed to have found evidence that a representative 
of Rodriguez had purchased his medical records. It then paid a former Biogenesis 
employee for documents.[8] In April, Bosch received a complaint from the 
Florida Department of Health for practicing medicine without a license. 
The complaint urged him to sign a cease and desist agreement. In May, Bosch 
agreed to work with MLB investigators in exchange for his name being removed 
from the lawsuit.[8] MLB conducted a large number of interviews with players 
it believed may be connected with Biogenesis in June. Every player interviewed 
was supplied legal counsel by the Major League Baseball Players Association.[8] 
In August, Wifredo A. Ferrer, U.S. attorney for the southern district of 
Florida, announced that Bosch intended to plead guilty to one charge of 
conspiracy to distribute testosterone.[9] On July 22, 2013, MLB suspended 
Milwaukee Brewers player Ryan Braun for the remainder of the 2013 season 
(65 games and the postseason) for his involvement with the Biogenesis clinic. 
Braun, who lost $3.25 million as a result, did not appeal the suspension. 
ESPN reported that Braun decided to "strike a deal" with MLB after being 
presented with the evidence against him.[10] Braun had previously tested 
positive for testosterone in December 2011, but maintained his innocence 
and ultimately avoided suspension for that violation on a technicality 
that his test sample had been improperly handled.[11] On August 5, 2013, 
Alex Rodriguez was suspended through the 2014 season (211 games at the 
time of the decision), but was allowed to play in 2013 pending his appeal 
of that decision. An arbitrator later upheld the suspension in January 
2014, after being allowed to play in the 49 games between the decision 
and the hearing, technically reducing the suspension to 162 games, representing 
the entire 2014 regular season and postseason. Twelve other players connected 
to the Biogenesis case agreed to 50-game suspensions without the right 
to appeal: Antonio Bastardo, Everth Cabrera, Francisco Cervelli, Nelson 
Cruz, Fautino de los Santos, Sergio Escalona, Fernando Martínez, Jesús 
Montero, Jordan Norberto, Jhonny Peralta, César Puello, and Jordany Valdespin. 
Cabrera, Cruz, and Peralta were All-Stars in 2013.[12] Rodriguez, who received 
the longest suspension of all the players linked to Biogenesis, was punished 
for "his use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing 
substances, including testosterone and human growth hormone, over the course 
of multiple years" and "for his attempts to cover up those violations and 
obstruct a league investigation", according to MLB.[8] The 13 player suspensions 
are the most to be imposed simultaneously in the history of organized baseball, 
the previous record being Kenesaw Mountain Landis' banning of eight players 
for life for throwing the 1919 World Series.[8] Melky Cabrera, Bartolo 
Colón, and Yasmani Grandal each had previously been suspended in 2012 and 
already served 50-game suspensions for their involvement with Biogenesis.[8] 
Two players mentioned in Biogenesis documents, Gio Gonzalez and Danny Valencia, 
were cleared of any wrongdoing.[12] All of the suspended players, with 
the exception of Rodriguez, reached agreement with the League on the length 
of that suspension, and as part of that agreement waived their contractual 
right to appeal it to an arbitrator.[12] Rodriguez was the only player 
who appealed his suspension. His appeal was heard by arbitrator Fredric 
Horowitz, who succeeded Shyam Das as baseball's designated arbitrator in 
2012.[15][16] Das was removed from his position as baseball's long-time 
arbitrator as a direct result of his overturning Braun's original 50-game 
suspension for PEDs.[15][16] Horowitz ruled the original suspension from 
time of ruling until the end of the 2014 season would stand (though technically 
reduced from 211 to 162 games since he was allowed to play the 49 games 
between the ruling and the appeal), leaving Rodriguez's career in limbo.[15] 
Rodriguez was allowed to play while his appeal was heard.[12] The Players 
Association said it agreed with his decision to appeal, adding "We believe 
that the Commissioner has not acted appropriately under the Basic Agreement."[12] 
MLB commissioner Bud Selig remarked "We conducted a thorough, aggressive 
investigation guided by facts so that we could justly enforce our rules ... 
we pursued this matter because it was not only the right thing to do, but 
the only thing to do."[8] The other players involved all agreed to deals 
that included a waiver of the right to appeal.[12] Cruz blamed a gastrointestinal 
infection for his drug use and remarked that faced with the weight loss 
from the infection he was unsure he would be physically able to play and 
"made an error in judgment that I deeply regret, and I accept full responsibility 
for that error."[8] An emotional Cabrera said he had taken a banned substance 
for four days in 2012 to aid in injury recovering before stopping because 
"I realized it wasn't necessary. My heart and my conscience was killing 
me."[12] Peralta remarked "I take full responsibility for my actions, have
