Elijah Jerry "Pumpsie" Green (born October 27, 1933) is a former Major 
League Baseball backup infielder who played with the Boston Red Sox (1959â€“62) 
and New York Mets (1963). He was a switch-hitter who threw right-handed. 
Green had the distinction of being the first black player to play for the 
Red Sox, the last pre-expansion major-league club to integrate. In his 
Boston tenure, he was used mostly as a pinch runner or day-off replacement 
for infielders Pete Runnels and Don Buddin. He made his debut on July 21, 
1959, pinch-running in a 2-1 loss against the White Sox. Green was born 
in Boley, Oklahoma, the eldest of five children. One brother, Cornell Green, 
was a long-time safety for the Dallas Cowboys. Another brother, Credell 
Green, played football at the University of Washington and was drafted 
by the Green Bay Packers.[1][2] Green was named Elijah, after his father, 
but his mother called him "Pumpsie" from an early age.[2] Green grew up 
in Richmond, California, and was a three-sport athlete at El Cerrito High 
School. Since major-league baseball had not yet expanded to the West Coast, 
Green grew up a fan of the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. Green 
later stated that he may have been even better at basketball, but chose 
to play baseball when he was offered a baseball scholarship at Fresno State 
University. However, Green decided to attend Contra Costa College when 
Gene Corr, his high school baseball coach, became the baseball coach there 
and promised Green he would play shortstop if he attended.[2] In Green's 
final year of college, he tried out for the Oaks, and was signed to a contract. 
In 1954, Green batted .297 in his second season with the Wenatchee Chiefs, 
an affiliate of the Oaks. In 1955, he was promoted to the Stockton Ports, 
the Oaks' top affiliate. Green's contract was purchased by the Boston Red 
Sox during the 1955 season, but he was allowed to finish the season with 
Stockton before playing the 1956 season with the Albany Senators, a Red 
Sox affiliate.[2] Green spent the 1957 season with the Oklahoma City Indians 
and San Francisco Seals, and the 1958 season with the Minneapolis Millers. 
In 1959, Green was invited to the Red Sox's major league spring training 
camp. Despite playing well and receiving much media attention, Green was 
sent back to Minneapolis. However, after hitting .320 through 98 games, 
he was promoted to the major league Red Sox on July 21, 1959.[3][4] Green 
made his debut as a pinch runner against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey 
Park. He also started the next game at second base, going 0-for-3. His 
first at bat at Fenway was a triple off the Green Monster. One week after 
Green's debut, pitcher Earl Wilson was called up, becoming the Red Sox's 
second black player. Green would play 50 games during the 1959 season, 
batting .233 and playing second base almost exclusively.[4] Green enjoyed 
a much more full-time role in 1960, playing 133 games, 69 at second base 
and 41 at shortstop.[4] Green may have had his best season in 1961, posting 
career highs in home runs (6), RBI (27), doubles (12), and stolen bases 
(4), although he also had the most errors of his career that year, with 
16. Despite a hot start to the season, Green developed an appendicitis 
in Washington, D.C. in May, which put him out of the lineup for about four 
weeks, and kept him from playing at full strength for even longer.[2] In 
1962, after a weekend of humiliating losses to the New York Yankees, Green 
along with Gene Conley got off the bus in the middle of a traffic jam in 
the Bronx. They were not spotted until 3 days later by a New York Post 
sports reporter at the Idlewild International Airport trying to board a 
plane for Israel, with no passports or luggage.[5] After the 1962 season, 
Green was traded to the New York Mets along with Tracy Stallard and Al 
Moran in exchange for Felix Mantilla. Green played the majority of the 
1963 season with the Buffalo Bisons, but also played 17 games with the 
Mets. He played his final major league game with the Mets on September 
26, 1963, although Green would play two more seasons in the minor leagues 
before retiring after the 1965 season.[3] In a five-season major league 
career, Green was a .246 hitter with 13 home runs and 74 RBI in 344 games.[4] 
After retiring from playing baseball, Green worked at Berkeley High School 
in Berkeley, California for over 20 years, coaching baseball and teaching 
math in summer school.[2] Green has lived in El Cerrito, California since 
7 years after his retirement from baseball. He has been married to his 
wife, Marie, for over 50 years.[6] On April 17, 2009, Green was honored 
by the Red Sox in a first-pitch ceremony, in recognition of 50 years since 
his breaking of the Red Sox color barrier.[7] In February 2012, Green was 
honored by the city of El Cerrito, and presented with a proclamation honoring 
his "distinguished stature in baseball history."[6] In April 2012, he threw 
out the ceremonial first pitch before Jackie Robinson day at Fenway Park, 
and also attended Fenway's 100th anniversary celebrations later that month.[8][9]
