Daniel Webster Litwhiler (August 31, 1916 â€“ September 23, 2011) was an 
American Major League baseball player who played outfield from 1940 to 
1951. He played for the Boston Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia 
Phillies, and Cincinnati Reds. He was the first Major Leaguer to have an 
error-free season. That same season, 1942, he also became the first player 
to stitch together the fingers of his glove. Before entering baseball, 
Litwhiler graduated from college, unlike most major leaguers at the time.[1] 
He graduated from Bloomsburg State Teacher's College in 1938, earning a 
bachelor's degree in Science and Social Sciences. The baseball facility 
at Bloomsburg is named Danny Litwhiler Field.[1] After finishing the 1941 
season with a .308 batting average, he was selected to the All Star game 
in 1942, where he hit safely in his only at-bat. Litwhiler was traded to 
the Cardinals in 1943 and was a key player for them in the 1944 World Series 
against the St. Louis Browns. He played left field in five of the six games 
and had four hits with one RBI and one run scored. Litwhiler coached at 
Florida State University from 1955 to 1963, and led them to three College 
World Series appearances. He then coached at Michigan State University 
from 1964 to 1982, and holds the record for most wins by a coach in the 
school's history. Among his former players are Steve Garvey, Kirk Gibson 
and Rick Miller.[2] During his coaching career, he invented a very effective 
method of drying baseball fields after rain using calcined clay which was 
marketed as Diamond Grit, enabling play to resume very quickly and in the 
process saving organized baseball millions of dollars over the decades. 
He also invented the use of the radar gun for timing pitches, which effectively 
revolutionized the assessment of pitchers. It first came on the market 
in collaboration with the Jugs company, known as the Jugs Gun. Litwhiler
