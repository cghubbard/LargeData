Jorge Rafael Posada Villeta (born August 17, 1971) is a Puerto Rican former 
professional baseball catcher who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the New York Yankees. Posada produced strong offensive numbers 
for his position, recording a .273 batting average, 275 home runs, and 
1,065 runs batted in (RBIs) during his career. A switch hitter, Posada 
was a five-time All-Star, won five Silver Slugger Awards, and was on the 
roster for four World Series championship teams. Drafted by the Yankees 
in 1990, Posada was originally an infielder before moving to catcher during 
his minor league career. He debuted in the major leagues in 1995, but it 
was not until 1998 that he found regular playing time. A solid-hitting 
catcher, Posada established himself as a mainstay in the Yankees lineup 
and as one of the "Core Four" players who contributed to the Yankees' winning 
seasons. In 2003, he finished third in voting for the American League (AL) 
Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award and became only the second Yankees catcher 
after Yogi Berra to hit 30 home runs in a season. Posada added one of his 
best seasons in 2007 at age 35 when he batted .338. Following a stint as 
designated hitter in 2011, he retired. Posada is only the fifth MLB catcher 
with at least 1,500 hits, 350 doubles, 275 home runs, and 1,000 RBIs in 
a career.[1] From 2000 to 2011, he compiled more RBIs and home runs than 
any other catcher in baseball. He is the only MLB catcher to ever bat .330 
or better with 40 doubles, 20 home runs, and 90 RBIs in a single season.[2] 
Away from baseball, Posada is the founder of the Jorge Posada Foundation, 
which is involved with research for craniosynostosis, a birth defect that 
impacts his son. Posada was born on August 17, 1971, in the Santurce district 
of San Juan, Puerto Rico to a Cuban father and a Dominican mother.[3] He 
attended Alejandrino High School in San Juan, where he participated in 
several sports, including baseball.[4] He was named to the all-star team 
in 1988–89 as a short stop.[5] He also umpired for the girls' softball 
team.[6] Posada's SAT scores were not high enough for him to enroll in 
a four-year college.[6] Fred Frickie, the head coach of the college baseball 
team at Calhoun Community College in Decatur, Alabama in 1991, recruited 
Posada without scouting him.[4][6] Posada accepted the scholarship at Calhoun 
without visiting the school. He made friends on the team fast, as they 
were curious about this switch-hitting infielder with a rifle arm. Posada 
has also spoken about the racism he encountered from classmates at the 
school.[6] He was voted best hitter (1990), co-captain (1991), and selected 
all-conference (1991). He was inducted in the Alabama Community College 
Athletic Hall of Fame in 2006 and Calhoun retired his number (#6).[7] Posada 
was drafted by the Yankees in the 24th round of the 1990 Major League Baseball 
draft as an infielder.[8] Yankees scout Leon Wurth followed Posada as he 
played for Calhoun, and rated his bat and attitude highly.[6] Posada signed 
with the Yankees for a signing bonus close to $30,000. The team agreed 
to keep him in their system for three years.[6] Posada played second base 
in his first season with the Oneonta Yankees in the Class A-Short Season 
New York–Penn League, in which he had a .235 batting average and four home 
runs in 71 games played.[4] As the Yankees felt that Posada lacked the 
speed to remain an infielder, they began to transition Posada into a catcher 
in 1992.[6] Though Posada initially resisted the position change, as he 
didn't feel able to catch full-time, he agreed.[9] That year, he played 
for the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League.[4][10] 
He finished the season with a .277 batting average, 38 extra-base hits, 
including 12 home runs, and 58 runs batted in (RBIs).[4][11] He caught 
Andy Pettitte for the first time while they were teammates at Greensboro.[11] 
A full-time catcher in 1993,[4] Posada started the season with the Prince 
William Cannons of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. After he hit 17 
home runs and recorded 61 RBIs in 118 games for the Cannons, he was promoted 
to the Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Class AA Eastern League.[11] He earned 
Carolina League mid-season and post-season All-Star honors.[12][13] Still 
working on his defense, Posada committed 38 passed balls in the 1993 season, 
the most in the Carolina League.[11] The Yankees promoted Posada to the 
Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League in 1994. He batted 
.240 with 11 home runs on the year. His left leg was broken and the ankle 
dislocated in a collision at home plate, prematurely ending his season.[6][11] 
After recovering from the injury, Posada played for the Clippers for the 
majority of the 1995 season, batting .255 with eight home runs and 51 RBIs.[11] 
The Yankees included Posada in trade discussions with the Seattle Mariners 
in their attempts to acquire Tino Martinez.[14] Three weeks later, the 
Yankees attempted to trade Posada and Mariano Rivera to the Cincinnati 
Reds for David Wells, but that trade was not accepted.[15] Returning to 
Columbus in 1996, Posada batted .271.[4] He appeared in the 1996 Triple-A 
All-Star Game.[16] Posada made his MLB debut with the Yankees in 1995, 
replacing Jim Leyritz in the ninth inning of a game on September 4, 1995.[17] 
Despite his appearing in only one game during the regular season, the Yankees 
included Posada on their postseason roster, and he appeared in Game 2 of 
the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) as a pinch runner, scoring 
a run.[17] The Yankees lost the division series in five games to the Seattle 
Mariners.[18] Posada began the 1996 season with Columbus, but was promoted 
to the Yankees late in the season. He appeared in eight games, making his 
first start on September 25, 1996.[17] Posada appeared in eight games in 
1996, recording one hit and one walk. Posada did not appear in the postseason 
but the Yankees still succeeded as they defeated the Atlanta Braves in 
the 1996 World Series.[19] Posada succeeded Leyritz in 1997 as the backup 
catcher to Joe Girardi, with Girardi serving as a mentor to Posada.[20] 
Posada was expected to appear in approximately 40 games in 1997;[20] he 
started in 52.[21] Posada appeared in 60 games during the 1997 baseball 
year and batted .250 with six home runs and 25 RBIs.[21] Posada led the 
Yankees to the postseason again but the team lost in the 1997 ALDS to the 
Cleveland Indians. After the 1997 season, the Yankees offered Posada and 
Mike Lowell to the Montreal Expos for Pedro Martínez; the Expos traded 
Martínez to the Boston Red Sox, instead.[22] During the offseason, Posada 
hired a personal trainer and running coach, who helped improve his physical 
conditioning. Going into the 1998 season, Posada pushed the Yankees to 
increase his playing time.[21] Posada caught David Wells' perfect game 
on May 17, 1998.[23] Overall, Posada batted .268 with 17 home runs and 
63 RBIs over 111 games in the 1998 season.[24] The Yankees reached the 
postseason for the fourth consecutive year and the team won the 1998 World 
Series in four games against the San Diego Padres.[25] The Yankees renewed 
Posada's contract for $350,000 for the 1999 season, less than the $650,000 
he requested.[24] Posada struggled in April, batting .146 and striking 
out 15 times in 46 appearances. After batting .210 at the All-Star Break, 
he batted .285 for the remainder of the season, ending the year with a 
.245 batting average, 12 home runs, and 57 RBIs. He also committed 17 passed 
balls.[26] Posada and Girardi split playing time through the 1999 season, 
with Posada receiving "roughly 60 percent of the playing time behind the 
plate to Girardi's 40 percent."[27] Posada played in 112 games with 379 
at-bats, while Girardi played in 65 games with 209 at-bats.[28] While Girardi 
began the 1999 postseason as the regular catcher,[28] Posada saw increased 
playing time.[29] The Yankees entered the postseason once again and won 
the 1999 World Series against the Braves in only four games.[30] Girardi 
left the Yankees as a free agent after the 1999 season, which allowed Posada 
to become the Yankees' full-time catcher.[31] With Girardi gone, the Yankees 
entrusted Posada with the everyday catching job.[32] During the 2000 season, 
Posada batted .287 with 28 homers, 86 RBIs, 107 walks, and 151 strikeouts. 
Yankees' manager Joe Torre selected Posada for his first All-Star Game 
appearance that season.[citation needed] The Yankees reached the postseason 
once again, and they won the 2000 World Series against the New York Mets.[33] 
Posada won the Silver Slugger Award for catcher in 2000.[34] Posada appeared 
in the 2001 MLB All-Star Game.[35][36] For the season, Posada batted .277 
with 22 home runs and 95 RBIs,[citation needed] but led the league in passed 
balls and errors among catchers.[37] The Yankees entered the postseason 
for another shot to win a championship, but lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks 
in the 2001 World Series in seven games.[38] Posada won his second consecutive 
Silver Slugger Award in 2001.[39] Posada started the 2002 MLB All-Star 
Game. He batted .268 with 20 home runs, 99 RBIs, and grounded into an AL-leading 
23 double plays.[citation needed] He again led all catchers in errors.[37] 
The Yankees entered the postseason again but lost in the 2002 ALDS to the 
Anaheim Angels. Posada won a Silver Slugger Award for a third consecutive 
season.[40] Posada again started at catcher in the 2003 All-Star Game. 
For the season, he hit 30 home runs and drove in 101 runs, both career 
highs.[4] He batted .281 and was also fifth in the league in OBP (.405), 
and sixth in the league in walks (93; walking 17.5% of the time, a career 
high). He tied Yogi Berra's record for most home runs by a Yankee catcher. 
The Yankees again reached the postseason but lost to the Florida Marlins 
in the 2003 World Series.[41] After the season, Posada won his fourth consecutive 
Silver Slugger Award.[42] He finished third in the MVP voting, behind Alex 
Rodriguez and Carlos Delgado.[4] In 2004, Posada committed 24 double plays, 
which led the American League, but batted .272 with 21 home runs and 81 
RBIs.[citation needed] After defeating the Minnesota Twins in the 2004 
ALDS,[43] the Yankees lost to the Boston Red Sox in the 2004 ALCS despite 
the Yankees leading the series three games to none.[44] In 2005, Posada 
batted .262 with 19 home runs and 71 RBIs. The Yankees reached the postseason 
again, but lost to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 2005 ALDS.[45] 
In 2006, Posada posted his highest batting average and home run total since 
2003. He also led the major leagues with 20 pinch hits.[46] In addition, 
work with new first base coach Tony Peña, a former catcher, helped him 
improve his percentage of runners thrown out stealing second almost 60 
points above his career average. However, he again led the league in passed 
balls.[37] He batted (.277) and had 23 home runs with 93 RBIs. On May 16, 
Posada led the Yankees to a victory despite falling behind by nine runs, 
matching the largest deficit the Yankees overcame for a victory in franchise 
history.[47] He registered a +0.93 win probability added in that game, 
the highest of his career.[48] Posada batted .338, with 20 home runs, 90 
RBIs, and career highs in hits (171) and doubles (42) during the 2007 season. 
He joined Iván Rodríguez as the only two catchers in MLB history to record 
at least 40 doubles in two separate seasons.[2] He finished the season 
third in the AL in on-base percentage (.426), fourth in batting average, 
sixth in on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) (.970), and 8th in doubles 
and slugging percentage (.543). He finished sixth in MVP voting for the 
season,[49] and won his fifth Silver Slugger Award.[50] Posada and Jason 
Kendall were the only catchers to catch at least 120 games per season from 
2000 through 2007.[51] Posada became a free agent after the 2007 season. 
He turned down a five-year contract offer from the New York Mets.[52] He 
signed a four-year, $52 million contract to remain with the Yankees.[53][54] 
Posada was represented in negotiations by Sam and Seth Levinson of ACES 
Inc.[55] On July 21, 2008, Posada was placed on the disabled list (DL),[56] 
the first time he was placed on the DL in his career.[57] Posada intended 
to recover from this injury in order to perform as designated hitter or 
first baseman. However, the team decided to acquire Xavier Nady, in order 
to allow him enough time to operate.[58] Posada underwent surgery to repair 
a glenoid labrum in his right shoulder and was placed on the DL for the 
remainder 2008 season.[59] He batted .268 with three home runs and 22 RBIs 
in 51 games prior to the injury.[60] During his absence, the Yankees finished 
with an 89–73 record, third place in AL East. It was the first and only 
season the Yankees were eliminated from postseason contention during Posada's 
career. Posada hit the first regular season home run in the new Yankee 
Stadium on April 16, 2009, against Cliff Lee of the Cleveland Indians.[61] 
During a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on September 15, 2009, Posada 
took exception to a pitch that was thrown behind him by Jesse Carlson. 
Posada walked and later scored on an RBI single by Brett Gardner. After 
Posada crossed home plate, he bumped into Carlson and was then ejected 
after taunting Carlson. Posada then charged at Carlson igniting a bench-clearing 
brawl. Posada and Carlson were each suspended three games by the MLB for 
their roles in the brawl.[62] Posada finished the 2009 season with a .285 
batting average, 22 home runs, and 81 RBIs.[citation needed] During the 
2009 postseason, Posada had a .276 batting average and 2 home runs. The 
Yankees won the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.[63] 
In an interleague series against the Houston Astros in June 2010, Posada 
became the first Yankee since Bill Dickey in 1937 to hit a grand slam in 
back-to-back games.[64] On July 23, 2010, Posada recorded his 1,000th career 
RBIs against the Kansas City Royals.[65] Posada finished the 2010 year 
batting .248 with 18 home runs and 57 RBIs. The Yankees went into the postseason 
again but lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 ALCS.[66] Following the 
2010 season, Posada underwent arthroscopic surgery in his left knee to 
repair a torn meniscus.[67] Posada was shifted to designated hitter for 
the 2011 season due to his declining defensive performance, while Russell 
Martin became the new everyday catcher.[67][68][69][70] After starting 
the 2011 season in a slump, Posada was moved to ninth in the batting order 
for a May 14 game against the Boston Red Sox. Posada asked to be removed 
from the lineup. Posada told reporters that he needed time to "clear [his] 
head" and also mentioned some "stiffness" in his back as the reasons for 
his request.[71][72] Posada hit .382 in June,[73] but was removed from 
the everyday lineup in August due to his .230 season batting average.[74] 
On August 13, 2011, his first start since being benched, in a game against 
the Tampa Bay Rays, Posada went 3 for 5 with a grand slam and six RBIs. 
His grand slam was the tenth of his career, moving him past Yogi Berra 
and Mickey Mantle for sixth place on the Yankees' all-time list.[75] On 
August 25, 2011, he played second base for the first time in his major 
league career during the ninth inning of the Yankees' 22–9 victory over 
the Oakland Athletics; Posada recorded the final out by fielding a grounder.[76] 
On September 10, 2011, Posada played as a catcher for the first time of 
the season due to injuries of Russell Martin and Francisco Cervelli. Posada 
finished the regular season with a .235 batting average, 14 home runs, 
and 44 RBIs.[77] In the 2011 ALDS, Posada recorded six hits, including 
a triple, four runs, and four walks in 14 at-bats as the starting DH, for 
a .429 batting average and a .579 on-base percentage. The Yankees lost 
the series to the Detroit Tigers in five games.[78] When asked by reporters 
after the 2011 ALDS if he had considered the fact he might have played 
for the final time with the Yankees, Posada said, "I don't want to look 
at it like that. We lost, and we'll see what happens in the off-season." 
As the interview session went on, he eventually became emotional and left 
the clubhouse area to compose himself.[78] Girardi said, "This guy, when 
you look at what he did in this series, he was awesome. He's had a tremendous 
career, and I'm sure he's going to continue to play, and I don't know what's 
going to happen." Girardi added, "But you talk about being proud of players 
— what he went through this year and what he gave us in the postseason, 
I don't think there's a prouder moment that I've had of Jorge."[78] By 
November 2011, Posada received interest from "five or six teams", but not 
the Yankees. He remained undecided on whether or not he wanted to keep 
playing.[77] In January 2012, Posada decided to retire.[79][80] The Yankees 
held a press conference officially announcing his retirement from baseball 
on January 24, 2012.[81] He rejoined the Yankees as a guest instructor 
during spring training in 2013.[82] On February 16, 2015, the Yankees announced 
that they would be retiring Posada's number 20 on August 22, 2015.[83] 
Posada's mother is Dominican and his father, Jorge Posada Sr., is Cuban, 
but fled to Puerto Rico to escape Fidel Castro's regime.[8][84] Posada 
Sr. worked as a scout for the Colorado Rockies. His uncle, Leo Posada, 
played for the Kansas City Athletics.[85] Posada met Laura (née Mendez)[86] 
at a party in 1997, soon recognizing her as the pitcher of the softball 
team in games he umpired.[6] They were married on January 21, 2000. Laura, 
a former model and actress, works as an attorney.[86] They have two children, 
Jorge Luis and Paulina.[4] Derek Jeter served as best man at the wedding.[87] 
Posada's son, Jorge Luis, suffers from craniosynostosis, which he was diagnosed 
with 10 days after he was born.[8] Posada established the Jorge Posada 
Foundation, which helps fund research and offers family support. Jorge 
released a charity wine in 2008 called Jorge Cabernet to raise funds for 
his foundation.[88] In June 2011, his son underwent what Posada hoped would 
be the final surgery for the condition.[89] During his all-star appearances, 
Jorge would have Jorge Luis at his side during the player introductions. 
One time during the intro of the 2002 game – the game where he started 
– Jorge Luis jogged out for his father, but nearly ran all the way out 
of the park – only to be quickly picked up by AL teammate Manny Ramirez. 
Posada wrote a children's book entitled Play Ball! that was published in 
2006.[90] He and his wife cowrote Fit Home Team, a family health manual, 
and an autobiography titled The Beauty of Love: A Memoir of Miracles, Hope, 
and Healing, which describes their personal ordeals and how they dealt 
with them after learning of their son's birth condition in 1999.[91] In 
2014, Jorge Posada along with José Contreras filed a lawsuit against their 
former financial advisors Juan Carlos Collar and Anthony Fernandez, alleging 
that they were scammed out of millions due to questionable investments
