John Lee Richmond (May 5, 1857 – October 1, 1929) was an American pitcher 
in Major League Baseball. He played for the Boston Red Stockings, Worcester 
Worcesters, Providence Grays, and Cincinnati Red Stockings, and is best 
known for pitching the first perfect game. After retiring from baseball, 
he became a teacher. Richmond was born in Sheffield, Ohio, in 1857. He 
was the son and grandson of Baptist ministers and he had eight siblings, 
all of them older. He went to the college preparatory academy affiliated 
with Oberlin College.[1] He started attending Brown University in 1876 
and was an outfielder and pitcher on the school's baseball team.[2] He 
was also class president and he played on the football team.[1] On June 
2, 1879, Richmond was paid $10 to pitch for Worcester of the National Baseball 
Association in an exhibition game against the Chicago White Stockings. 
He pitched a seven-inning no-hitter and signed with Worcester after the 
game. On July 28, he pitched a no-hitter against Springfield.[2] Worcester 
joined the National League in 1880, and Richmond signed with the team for 
$2,400 that season. Before a game against Cleveland on June 12, Richmond 
was up all night taking part in college graduation events, and he went 
to bed at 6:30 AM. He caught the 11:30 AM train for Worcester so he could 
pitch in the afternoon contest and then pitched a perfect game to beat 
Cleveland, 1–0. According to the Chicago Tribune, "The Clevelands were 
utterly helpless before Richmond's puzzling curves, retiring in every inning 
in one, two, three order, without a base hit. The Worcesters played a perfect 
fielding game." Cleveland pitcher Jim McCormick allowed three hits, and 
the only run was scored on a double error by Fred Dunlap.[2] Richmond graduated 
from Brown University four days after the perfect game, and he finished 
the year with a win–loss record of 32–32, a 2.15 earned run average, and 
243 strikeouts in 590.2 innings pitched. He was the first left-handed pitcher 
to win 30 games in a season.[2][3] Richmond found success throwing an offspeed 
pitch that he termed a "half-stride ball" and that other players referred 
to as a "drop ball". He also had a rising fastball that he called a "jump 
ball". He also learned to throw a curveball in college, even though a Brown 
physics professor tried to convince him that nothing could make a ball 
curve in midair.[1] In both 1881 and 1882, Richmond pitched over 400 innings. 
After the 1882 season, the Worcester franchise disbanded, and Richmond 
played for the NL's Providence Grays in 1883. He experienced arm problems 
and was primarily an outfielder that year. He finished his MLB career with 
a record of 75–100, a 3.06 ERA, and 552 strikeouts.[2][3] In the winter 
of 1880, Richmond had begun to pursue a career in medicine, studying under 
a Providence physician, C. T. Gardner. He enrolled at the College of Physicians 
and Surgeons of New York a few months later, then at the University of 
the City of New York. After the 1883 baseball season, Richmond practiced 
medicine at Bellevue Hospital and with Gardner in Providence.[1] Richmond 
then changed careers, and from 1890 to 1921, he was a high school chemistry 
teacher at Scott High School in Toledo, Ohio.[2][4] Richmond married Mary 
Naomi Chapin, his former student, in 1892, and had three children: Ruth, 
Dorothy, and Jane. He died in Toledo in 1929.[2] Italics denotes post-season perfect game
