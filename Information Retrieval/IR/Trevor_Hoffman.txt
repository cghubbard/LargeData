Trevor William Hoffman (born October 13, 1967) is an American former baseball 
relief pitcher who played 18 years in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 
1993 to 2010. A long-time closer, Hoffman pitched for the Florida Marlins, 
San Diego Padres, and the Milwaukee Brewers, including more than 15 years 
for the Padres. He was the major leagues' first player to reach the 500- 
and 600-save milestones, and was the all-time saves leader from 2006 until 
2011. He currently serves as senior advisor for baseball operations for 
the Padres. Hoffman played shortstop collegiately at the University of 
Arizona and was drafted in the 11th round by the Cincinnati Reds. After 
not having much success batting, Hoffman was converted to a pitcher, as 
he was able to throw up to 95 miles per hour (mph). The Marlins acquired 
him in the 1992 expansion draft, and he pitched in Florida until he was 
traded to the Padres mid-season in 1993 in a deal that sent star Gary Sheffield 
to the Marlins. Hoffman recorded 20 saves in 1994 in his first season as 
Padres closer, and in the following years, he became the face of the franchise 
after Tony Gwynn retired. He collected at least 30 saves each year for 
the next 14 years, except for 2003 when he missed most of the year recovering 
from shoulder surgery. After San Diego did not re-sign him following the 
2008 season, Hoffman pitched for two years with the Brewers before retiring 
after the 2010 season. Hoffman was selected for the All-Star team seven 
times, and twice he was the runner-up for the National League (NL) Cy Young 
Award, given annually to the top pitcher in the league. He retired with 
MLB records of fifteen 20-save seasons, fourteen 30-save seasons (including 
eight consecutive), and nine 40-save seasons (including two streaks of 
four consecutive). He also retired with the highest career strikeout rate 
of any reliever.[note 1] Though he entered the majors with a powerful fastball, 
an injury after the 1994 season permanently sapped Hoffman's fastball velocity 
and forced him to reinvent his pitching style; he subsequently developed 
one of the best changeups in baseball. Hoffman's entrance at home games 
accompanied by the song "Hells Bells" was popular with fans. He became 
eligible for consideration for Baseball Hall of Fame induction starting 
in 2016. After retiring as a player, Hoffman returned to the Padres as 
a special assistant in the front office. In 2014, he became the team's 
pitching coordinator at their upper minor league levels, which included 
working with the Padres general manager. The following year, his role expanded 
to overseeing pitching instruction at all levels in the minors. Hoffman 
was born in Bellflower, California.[1] When he was six weeks old, Hoffman 
had to have a damaged kidney removed because an arterial blockage had formed 
there.[1][2] His father, Ed, who stood at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and 
225 pounds (102 kg), was a Marine and a veteran of the Battle of Iwo Jima 
in World War II.[3][4] He later became a professional singer before he 
quit being on the road and got a job at the post office.[5] He was also 
an usher at California Angels games; he was known as the Singing Usher, 
leading the crowd in the singing of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" in the 
seventh-inning and filling in if the designated national anthem singer 
did not show up. Ed would often bring Trevor to the games with him.[6][7] 
Hoffman's mother, Mikki, was a ballerina and came from an athletic family.[1][5] 
Her father was a professional soccer player before World War II.[4] She 
taught Hoffman to take responsibility. "Bad workmen always blame their 
tools", Mikki would say.[1] Hoffman's older brother, Glenn, was nine years 
older and played shortstop in the Boston Red Sox organization.[8] During 
summer vacation when Hoffman was 10 years old, he joined Glenn while he 
was playing in Pawtucket.[6] His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's 
senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers.[5][8] After Hoffman's 
first Little League game, Greg asked him how he did. Hoffman responded, 
"I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." to which Greg replied, "That'll be the last 
(blanking) time you tell me how you did. When I ask you how you did, it's 
how the team did." Hoffman never forgot that.[9] Given their age difference, 
Hoffman considered his brothers more role models than playmates. "[Glenn] 
was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.[8] Because 
of his damaged kidney, Hoffman was not allowed to play football or wrestle.[1] 
Hoffman went to Savanna High School as had Glenn, which put pressure on 
Hoffman following his more talented older brother.[6] Ed, who did not trust 
that coaches would protect Hoffman's arm, stopped allowing his son to pitch 
after he was 12 years old.[10] Standing at just 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) 
and 130 pounds (59 kg),[11] Hoffman played shortstop at Savanna,[1][12] 
but nobody offered him a scholarship out of high school. He grew three 
inches over the summer and continued playing at Cypress College, and later 
for the University of Arizona from 1988 through 1989.[6][13] Arizona was 
afraid of the liability if Hoffman's remaining kidney got hit by a baseball. 
"I told them the one kidney I have is on my right side. That's not the 
side that faces the pitcher when I hit, so it was O.K. They bought it", 
said Hoffman.[6] He led Arizona in hitting in 1988 with a .371 batting 
average, 35 points better than teammate J. T. Snow.[14] Other notable teammates 
included Scott Erickson and Kevin Long.[15] Hoffman exhibited a strong 
throwing arm playing shortstop.[2] Hoffman was selected by the Cincinnati 
Reds in the 11th round with the 288th overall selection of the 1989 MLB 
draft, and he signed for $3,000.[16] Prior to the draft, Reds scout Jeff 
Barton talked to Hoffman about playing another position. Hoffman was open 
to anything that might advance his career, and they talked about catching 
or pitching with his exceptional arm. Barton ranked Hoffman's arm an 80 
on a 20–80 scale, where 60 was above average and 80 was a rarity.[17] Hoffman 
played shortstop and third base for the Reds' Single-A affiliate Charleston. 
In his first 103 games, he only batted .212 with 23 runs batted in. Not 
showing much batting potential, Hoffman was converted to pitcher in 1991 
at the suggestion of Charleston manager Jim Lett, who also grew tired of 
Hoffman overthrowing first base.[18][19] Hoffman threw 95 miles per hour 
(153 km/h) and recorded a 2.90 ERA with 169 strikeouts in 142 2⁄3 minor 
league innings over two seasons while alternating between relieving and 
starting at Single-A Cedar Rapids, Double-A Chattanooga and Triple-A Nashville.[6][12] 
Left unprotected by Cincinnati in the 1992 MLB Expansion Draft, Hoffman 
was selected by the Florida Marlins with the eighth pick in the first round.[6] 
In his first major league season in 1993, Hoffman learned by observing 
Marlins closer Bryan Harvey's balanced demeanor.[12] After earning two 
saves in 29 appearances with the Marlins as an unknown rookie, Hoffman 
was traded midseason to the San Diego Padres during San Diego's 1993 fire 
sale.[11][20] The Padres sent third baseman Gary Sheffield and pitcher 
Rich Rodriguez to the Marlins for Hoffman and pitching prospects José Martínez 
and Andrés Berumen. Padres general manager Randy Smith said at the time, 
"The only way to acquire quality players is to give up quality."[21] The 
year before, Sheffield had won the NL batting title and made a run at the 
Triple Crown. Smith insisted that Florida include Hoffman in the deal.[22] 
Padres fans, upset at the trade, booed Hoffman during his first several 
appearances.[18] He allowed three runs in his one-inning debut with San 
Diego, eight runs over his first three outings, and blew his first save 
opportunity as a Padre.[23] He pitched 39 games for San Diego, who finished 
the season with 101 losses, and ended his rookie season with 79 strikeouts 
in 90 innings with a 3.90 ERA and five saves.[11] During the strike-shortened 
1994 season, Hoffman took over closer duties from an injured and ineffective 
Gene Harris in mid-April.[24] Hoffman recorded 20 saves and a 2.57 ERA 
while averaging 10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9).[11] The weekend 
after the strike began, Hoffman, playing Nerf football at Del Mar Beach 
near San Diego, dived for a pass and landed awkwardly on his right shoulder. 
He later played volleyball and landed on the shoulder again while going 
for a dig. He heard a strange sound.[1][18] In 1995, he had a 3.88 ERA 
and 31 saves and averaged 8.8 K/9.[11] Hoffman pitched hurt from spring 
training through the season and finally had off-season rotator cuff surgery. 
"[Hoffman] never bitched about his arm, which was killing him from Day 
One ... He was out there when most guys wouldn't have been", said Smith.[2] 
This is also the year during which he developed his changeup.[1] In both 
1996 and 1997, Hoffman pitched over 80 innings, with 111 strikeouts, averaged 
approximately 40 saves, and had ERAs of 2.25 and 2.66. In 1996, the Padres 
entered the last three games of the season in Los Angeles trailing the 
division-leading Dodgers by two games.[25] Hoffman recorded saves in each 
of the final three games against the Dodgers, as the Padres won the NL 
West for their first division title in 12 years.[26][27] After finishing 
the season with 18 straight saves,[28] Hoffman was named The Sporting News 
NL Fireman of the Year in 1996,[26] and received votes for both the Cy 
Young Award and the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award.[11] The Padres 
played the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1996 National League Division Series 
(NLDS) and were swept in the series 3–0. Hoffman entered Game 2 with the 
score tied and one out and inherited runners on second and third. A run 
scored as he retired the only two batters he faced, and the Padres lost 
5–4.[29][30] In Game 3, Hoffman recorded the loss as he came into the tie 
game and allowed a 2-run homer to Brian Jordan for a 7–5 loss.[31] The 
following season on June 23, 1997, he came in with the bases loaded in 
the ninth inning and struck out J. T. Snow to save the 11–6 win over the 
San Francisco Giants and became the Padres' career saves leader with 109, 
passing Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers.[32] San Diego won only 76 games that 
year, but Hoffman ranked second in the NL with 37 saves.[11] During the 
1998 season, Hoffman began entering save situations in Padres home games 
to the entrance music of AC/DC's "Hells Bells" playing over the public 
address system, an event that came to be known as "Trevor Time".[33] The 
tradition began July 25, 1998, and the song was chosen by a Padres salesman.[34] 
The crowd was excited by the tolling of the bells from the song, and the 
scoreboard showing Hoffman running in from the bullpen.[35] Hoffman preserved 
a 6–5 win against the Houston Astros by striking out Moisés Alou to end 
that game and converted his 41st consecutive save opportunity, tying an 
MLB record at the time. The following night, Hoffman's streak ended on 
an Alou home run, though the Padres ended up winning the game. It was Hoffman's 
only blown save of the regular season.[34] On September 1, he saved a 9–8 
victory over the New York Mets for his 45th save, breaking the club record 
set by Mark Davis in 1989 when he won the Cy Young Award.[36] On September 
12, the Padres clinched their second division title in three years after 
Hoffman saved an 8–7 win over the Dodgers.[37] In a 4–3 win over the Chicago 
Cubs on September 14, he worked a perfect ninth inning and became the fourth 
reliever in MLB history to reach the 50-save mark.[38] Hoffman had a career-high 
53 saves and a career-best 1.48 ERA. His saves tied the NL single-season 
record set in 1993 by the Cubs' Randy Myers.[38] Opponents batted .165 
against him, and the first hitters he faced hit .129. His ERA in save situations 
was 0.49, and he struck out 10.6 hitters per nine innings.[39] The Padres 
were 62–4 in games he pitched.[40] Hoffman was runner-up in the Cy Young 
Award race that year to Tom Glavine of the Atlanta Braves, despite receiving 
13 first-place votes to Glavine's 11.[41] Hoffman was left off of six ballots.[42] 
Hoffman and Adam Wainwright in 2009 are the only two pitchers to ever receive 
the most first-place votes and not win the Cy Young.[43] Hoffman won the 
Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and captured another Fireman of the 
Year Award. He finished seventh in NL MVP voting.[9] Facing the Houston 
Astros in the 1998 NLDS, the Padres won the series 3–1.[38] Hoffman earned 
two saves, both in 2–1 wins.[44][45] In Game 1 against Atlanta in the 1998 
National League Championship Series, Hoffman entered to stop a rally in 
the eighth inning with a 2–1 lead. He allowed a run in the ninth, tying 
the game 2–2, after converting 53 of 54 save attempts during the regular 
season. After Padre Ken Caminiti hit a home run in the top of the 10th, 
Hoffman got two outs but ran into trouble and was taken out after throwing 
43 pitches. He was credited with a win as the Padres held on, 3–2.[46][47][48] 
Hoffman entered Game 3 with the bases loaded and two out in the eighth, 
and he struck out Javy López on three pitches to end the inning and would 
save the Padres' 4–1 victory. San Diego was up 3–0 in the series and would 
go on to win 4–2.[38][47] The Padres reached the 1998 World Series, but 
lost the series 4–0 against the New York Yankees, who finished with an 
MLB-record 125 combined regular season and playoff victories and the third-best 
overall winning percentage (.714) for a World Series champion.[49] In his 
only appearance in the series in Game 3, Hoffman entered in the eighth 
with a runner on and no outs and a 3–2 lead. Later in the inning, he surrendered 
a three-run homer to Scott Brosius, the eventual World Series MVP, and 
the Padres lost the game 5–4.[50] Hoffman signed a $32 million contract 
extension with San Diego in March 1999 for the 2000–03 seasons. At the 
time, it was the richest contract ever given any Padre or any relief pitcher. 
The Padres held an option for $10 million for 2004. Hoffman's contract 
included a no-trade clause, the first the Padres had ever granted.[39] 
Following their World Series appearance in 1998, the Padres lost key players 
to begin the 1999 season and finished under .500 each season from 1999 
through 2002, while finishing either fourth or fifth in the five-team NL 
West each year.[51][52] Hoffman saved 56% of the team's wins during that 
span.[53] He set MLB records with his fifth overall and fourth consecutive 
40-save season in 2001, as well as his seventh consecutive 30-save campaign.[54] 
In 2002, he extended his MLB record with his eighth straight 30-save season.[55] 
Hoffman was named to the All-Star game in 1999, 2000, and 2002.[54] On 
June 10, 1999, Hoffman struck out the side in the ninth inning in a 2–1 
Padres victory over the Oakland Athletics for his 200th career save.[56] 
On August 15, 2001, Hoffman recorded his 300th save in a 2–1 home win over 
the Mets.[57] Hoffman broke Dennis Eckersley's record for most saves with 
one team (320) in 2002.[58] Sports Illustrated placed Hoffman on the cover 
of their May 13, 2002 issue with the headline "The Secret of San Diego: 
Why Trevor Hoffman of the Padres is the best closer (ever)".[59][60] Hoffman 
sat out most of the 2003 season while recovering from two offseason shoulder 
surgeries, including one that trimmed the tip of his scapula.[61][62] It 
marked the first time he had been on the disabled list after 10 major league 
seasons.[63] In his absence, Rod Beck closed for the Padres. Hoffman pitched 
his first game in 2003 on September 2 with a perfect seventh inning in 
a 6–3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.[64] He pitched in nine games in 
2003, all non-save situations, with an ERA of 2.00 and 11 strikeouts in 
9 innings.[65] Coming off the injury, the Padres bought out their $10 million 
option on Hoffman for 2004 for $2 million and agreed to a new deal with 
a $2.5 million salary for 2004 including $500,000 in incentives and an 
option for 2005.[66][67] In the Padres inaugural season at their new home 
in Petco Park in 2004, Hoffman returned to the closer role and finished 
with 41 saves with a 2.30 ERA, his lowest since 1998. He passed Jeff Reardon (367) 
and Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley (390) to end the season third on the 
all-time saves list.[68][69] The new park provide an upgrade over Qualcomm 
Stadium for "Trevor Time" with a state-of-the-art sound system and new 
scoreboards with enhanced visuals allowing for animated flames and live 
fan shots.[33] On May 6, 2005, Hoffman saved a 6–5 win over the St. Louis 
Cardinals as the Padres won two straight in St. Louis for the first time 
since 1977. It was Hoffman's 400th save, and he became the third pitcher 
in MLB history to reach the milestone, following John Franco (424) and 
Lee Smith (478).[70] Hoffman was named both the NL Pitcher of the Month 
and Delivery Man of the Month in May after a perfect 12 for 12 in save 
opportunities while posting a 0.82 ERA (1 ER/11.0 IP) in 12 games as the 
Padres went 22–6 for their best month in franchise history.[54][71][72] 
On August 24, Hoffman converted his 29th consecutive save opportunity in 
a 7–4 win over the Houston Astros. He passed Franco for second place on 
the all-time saves list with his 425th save, and the Padres maintained 
a six-game lead in the NL West with a 63–63 record.[73] The Padres won 
the NL West with an 82–80 record, and Hoffman finished the season 43 for 
46 in save opportunities, the second most saves in the NL.[54] The Padres 
were swept 3–0 in the playoffs by the Cardinals, who had a majors-best 
100–62 record in the regular season. Hoffman did not get into any save 
situations as the Padres never led through any of the 27 innings in the 
series.[74] As a free agent after the 2005 season, Hoffman re-signed with 
the Padres after negotiating with the Cleveland Indians. Hoffman signed 
a $13.5 million, two-year contract that included a club option for 2008. 
"It came down to me making a decision for my family and not disrupting 
what we have going on", said Hoffman.[75] "This is probably the most significant 
signing that I've had", said then-Padres general manager Kevin Towers. 
"This guy is the face of our organization. I can't put into words what 
he means to our community."[75] In 2006, Hoffman was named to his fifth 
All-Star game, but was the losing pitcher in the game after having two 
strikes with two outs to Michael Young, who was later named the All-Star 
Game Most Valuable Player. His All-Star performance bothered him, and he 
suffered two of his five blown saves that year in the week that followed.[76] 
August 20 marked Hoffman's 776th outing for the Padres, breaking the Pirates 
Elroy Face's major league record for most relief appearances with one club.[77] 
On September 24 in the Padres last home game of the year, Hoffman retired 
eventual 2006 NL batting champion Freddy Sanchez for the final out of a 
2–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates, keeping the Padres 1 1⁄2 game lead 
atop the NL West with seven games left to play. With the save, Hoffman 
became the all-time Major League saves leader, surpassing Lee Smith's record 
of 478.[78][79] As the Padres celebrated on the mound with Hoffman, the 
Pirates remained in the dugout watching in respectful salute.[80] "I've 
never seen a crowd get into one inning for one guy like that before", said 
Pirates reliever John Grabow. "You get goose bumps even if you are on the 
other team."[78] The Padres presented Hoffman with a golden bell trophy, 
a reference to "Hells Bells".[81] Hoffman saved a 3–1 win over the Diamondbacks 
on September 30 as the Padres to clinched a playoff berth.[82] The next 
day in the last regular season game, two home runs were hit off Hoffman 
before he saved a 7–6 win over the Diamondbacks, earning the Padres their 
second consecutive NL West title.[83] He was named MLB Delivery Man of 
the Month for September after being 10 for 11 in save opportunities and 
striking out 13 batters over 12.0 innings and allowing only seven hits.[84] 
Hoffman saved 46 of 51 save chances on the year, and led the NL in saves 
for the second time. His 11th 30-save season set an MLB record, while his 
eighth 40-save season extended his record. His season save total was the 
second highest in his career.[54] Hoffman won the Rolaids Relief Award 
for the second time in his career, was awarded The Sporting News NL Reliever 
of the Year for the third time, and finished as the runner-up for the Cy 
Young Award for the second time.[85][86][87] In the playoffs, the Padres 
faced the Cardinals in the NLDS again. Down 2–0 in the series, Hoffman 
saved Game 3 in a 3–1 win to avoid elimination.[88] However, the Padres 
lost the series 3–1 as their offense managed only six runs in the four 
games against the eventual 2006 World Series champions.[89] On April 28, 
2007 in a 3–2 win over the Dodgers, Hoffman earned a save and pitched in 
his 803rd game for the Padres, breaking the MLB record for games pitched 
for one team. The record was previously held by both Walter Johnson of 
the Washington Senators and Elroy Face of the Pittsburgh Pirates.[90] On 
June 6 against the Dodgers, Hoffman became the first pitcher in MLB history 
to log 500 saves after the Padres' 5–2 victory.[91] Hoffman was awarded 
the MLB Delivery Man of the Month for May after converting all 11 of his 
save opportunities and allowing no earned runs in 13 games.[92] On July 
1, Hoffman was named to the NL All-Star Team for the sixth time in his 
career.[54] On September 8 against the Colorado Rockies, Hoffman struck-out 
Todd Helton swinging on a 74-mph change-up for his 1,000th career strikeout, 
becoming the eighth reliever to reach the mark.[93] On September 27, Hoffman 
picked up his 40th save of the 2007 season, marking his ninth season with 
40 saves, a Major League record.[87] On September 29, one strike away from 
clinching the Padres third consecutive playoff berth, Hoffman surrendered 
a tying, two-out triple in the ninth inning to Tony Gwynn, Jr., son of 
legendary Padres Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn. The Padres would lose 4–3 in 
the 11th inning to the Milwaukee Brewers.[94] On October 1, in the Padres' 
wild card tie-breaker game against the Rockies, Hoffman blew his second 
straight save opportunity and his team's 8–6 lead in the 13th inning. He 
took the loss when he allowed the game-winning run to score on a sacrifice 
fly.[95] For the season, he converted 42 saves in 49 opportunities while 
posting a 4-5 mark and 2.98 ERA. His 42 saves were the third most in the 
NL.[54] A couple of weeks after the end of the season, Hoffman had minor 
arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow to remove bone chips. He said 
it was unrelated to his pitching performance at the end of the season.[96][97] 
Hoffman surrendered a home run but recorded his 550th save on August 14, 
2008 in a 3–2 victory over the Brewers.[98] On September 19, 2008, Hoffman 
finished an 11–6 14-inning win over the Washington Nationals for his 900th 
career MLB game.[99] Hoffman's 30th and last save of the season, a 3–2 
win over the Pirates, ensured the Padres would not lose 100 games that 
season.[100] The Padres finished with a 63–99 record after being projected 
by the team and analysts to win 87–90 games.[101] Hoffman ended the 2008 
season 3–6 with a 3.77 ERA and 30 in 34 save opportunities. He tied for 
sixth in the NL in saves. Hoffman reached 20 or more saves for the 14th 
time to set a new MLB record. He had a 5.14 ERA through his first 29 appearances 
and a 1.56 ERA in his last 19 appearances of the season.[54] Hoffman, eligible 
for free agency, realized he was decreasing his leverage when he declared 
he wanted to return to play for San Diego in 2009 and did not want to move 
his family.[101] Meanwhile, Padres owner John Moores, who was in the midst 
of a divorce and in the process of selling the team, ordered the team to 
reduce its payroll from its 2008 budget of $73.6 million to $40 million.[102] 
It was announced on November 10, 2008, that Hoffman would not return to 
San Diego in 2009. With his struggles during the season, the cost-cutting 
Padres lowballed a $4 million offer with an option for 2010 and later retracted 
that, ending his tenure with the team.[103][104] It was not an amicable 
parting for Hoffman, who was the face of the franchise after Tony Gwynn's 
retirement following the 2001 season.[20] His 902 career appearances as 
a Padre extended his own MLB record for games pitched with one team.[54] 
On January 13, 2009, Hoffman signed a one-year, $6 million deal with the 
Milwaukee Brewers.[105] He suffered a strained muscle on the right side 
of his rib cage in Spring training,[106] and started the season on the 
DL. He made his Brewers debut on April 27, 2009.[107] Hoffman recorded 
his first save for Milwaukee the next day, and the Brewers continued with 
his "Trevor Time" entrance.[108][109] He was named NL Pitcher of the Month 
as well as MLB Delivery Man of the Month in May after recording 11 saves 
in 12 scoreless appearances in the month.[110][111] He started the season 
with 18 scoreless innings before entering in a tie game on June 14 and 
surrendering a run in a 5–4 loss against the Chicago White Sox.[112] Hoffman 
was selected as an All-Star in 2009 as a late replacement, making his seventh 
appearance.[note 2][54] On September 3, he struck out Albert Pujols on 
three pitches for his 30th save in the 4–3 win over St. Louis.[113] The 
save extended Hoffman's record to 14 seasons with at least 30 saves.[114] 
He had already increased his record of 20 or more saves to 15. Hoffman 
appeared in 55 games with the Brewers, recording 37 saves in 41 attempts 
with a 1.83 ERA and a .183 BAA. It was second lowest ERA of his career 
behind 1.48 in 1998 in San Diego, and he ranked fifth in the NL in saves.[54] 
In the offseason, he re-signed with the Brewers for $8 million for 2010 
with a mutual option for the 2011 season.[115] With less control on his 
changeup, Hoffman struggled in 2010.[116] In April, Hoffman pitched nine 
innings and allowed 13 earned runs and six home runs—surpassing his totals 
in both categories from all of the previous season—and he blew four of 
his seven save opportunities.[117][118] Historically though, Hoffman had 
blown 20 of 84 save attempts in April for his career, a 76.1 percent success 
rate, while converting 90.6 percent the rest of the season.[119] On May 
1, Hoffman earned his first save at Petco Park as a visitor, as the Brewers 
beat the Padres 2–1.[120] After saving just five of his first 10 chances 
with an ERA over 12.00 in mid-May, Hoffman's struggles prompted Brewers 
manager Ken Macha to remove him as closer and move him into middle relief 
to work on his mechanics.[121][122] Hoffman insisted that there was nothing 
physically wrong with him,[122] and he served as a mentor for his replacement, 
John Axford.[123][124] Stuck at 596 career saves before his demotion, Hoffman 
eventually returned to a setup role, and occasionally pitched in save situations.[20] 
On September 7, 2010, he recorded his 600th save, and he was carried off 
the field by his teammates.[125] "To be a part of it was great because 
of how much admiration we all have for Trevor", said teammate Craig Counsell.[126] 
Hoffman finished the season win a 2–7 win–loss record, 10 saves in 15 chances, 
and a 5.89 ERA in 50 appearances, but he allowed just nine earned runs 
in his final 33 appearances dating back to June 3.[87][123] He and the 
Brewers parted ways on November 2 when the club declined to exercise a 
$7 million mutual option on his contract.[123] In the offseason, Hoffman 
expressed interest in taking over the closer role for a team near his home 
in San Diego, but he did not wish to return as a setup pitcher and diminish 
his accomplishments. The Arizona Diamondbacks, where old friend and former 
Padres general manager Kevin Towers was the GM, considered Hoffman a backup 
option as their closer had they not managed to sign J. J. Putz.[123] Hoffman 
believed he could still pitch in the big leagues, but with all of the closer 
roles for West Coast teams filled,[20] He elected to retire, announcing 
his decision on January 11, 2011. He revealed that elbow tendinitis plagued 
him for most of the first half of 2010, though he never used it as an excuse 
for his performance.[123] Hoffman had received three cortisone injections 
that year with the Brewers.[127] Hoffman retired with 601 saves as the 
all-time saves leader in MLB history.[123] He had no desire to sign a ceremonial 
one-day player contract to retire as a Padre. "I don't believe that's the 
right way [to retire]", said Hoffman.[87] The Padres retired Hoffman's 
No. 51 at Petco Park in a pre-game ceremony on August 21, 2011, against 
the Florida Marlins. San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders declared it "Trevor 
Hoffman Day."[128][129][130] The ceremony was patterned after the show 
This Is Your Life, featuring over 40 of Hoffman's former teammates and 
coaches.[131][132] Brian Johnson, the lead singer on AC/DC's "Hells Bells", 
paid tribute in a video to Hoffman for "rocking the mound."[132][133] In 
a nod to Hoffman's late father, Ed, the Padres presented Hoffman with a 
mint condition 1958 Cadillac convertible; his father loved driving his 
family in a convertible. For the National Anthem, the Padres played a video 
of Ed singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Fenway Park on Opening Day 
in 1981 when Hoffman's brother, Glenn, was the starting shortstop for the 
Red Sox.[132][134] On August 30, 2014, Hoffman became the ninth inductee 
into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame.[135] Hoffman is known for his high 
leg kick, the menacing glare through his cap pulled down almost to his 
eyes, and his deceptive changeup.[9][18] When Hoffman first came into the 
league, he could throw up to 95 mph.[9] He would also throw a slider and 
only an occasional changeup.[136] His original changeup was a conventional 
circle changeup taught to him by Cincinnati scout Larry Barton.[62] Hoffman 
learned a different changeup, which he throws with a palmball grip, from 
teammate Donnie Elliott in 1994.[1][137] He began using the new changeup 
in 1995 when his fastball had dropped to 88–90 mph after his offseason 
injury on the beach. With the decrease in velocity, Hoffman knew he could 
not rely as much on his fastball.[9][138] He played through 1995 and had 
surgery the following offseason for a torn rotator cuff.[1] When he returned 
the following year, Hoffman's fastball was at 87–88 mph, but he had more 
experience with his new changeup. His fastball reached back as high as 
91 mph in 1998, but by sometime after 2000 it dropped down to 83–88 mph.[9][138][139] 
His repertoire by then included primarily of his changeup, a four-seam 
fastball, a slower cut fastball that moves in towards a left-handed batter, 
and the occasional slider and a curveball.[136][140] Hoffman explained 
the key to his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his 
thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the 
arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball 
looked the same to the batter.[1] His changeup ranged from 73–76 mph.[9][137] 
Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said 
of Hoffman's changeup: "He pitched so well off his fastball [opponents] 
couldn't just sit on it every pitch."[138] "You could be sitting on [his 
changeup] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark 
Sweeney.[137] It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink 
just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful 
over the years.[62] With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, 
teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous 
Bugs Bunny cartoon episode.[104][137] "Some [pitchers] fool you. Some guys 
overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate 
Mike Piazza.[141] After striking out on a changeup to end the game against 
Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, "It's like it has a parachute 
on it."[6] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, 
he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that 
pitch and his changeup.[9][62] He initially kept the grip of his changeup 
a secret. "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. "I didn't like 
talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I 
gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." 
Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone 
had seen it.[62] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said Hoffman was the 
first one in and the last one out of the ballpark everyday. Hoffman adhered 
to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted 
to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon 
run.[6] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were 
still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. "I'd run before, but not 
at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I 
can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable."[6] Bochy 
said, "[Hoffman's] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like 
they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting .360 ... ' He was 
never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make 
sure that they've got goals they want to reach."[12] After every save opportunity, 
whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for 
up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was 
the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and 
drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move 
on.[142] Tracy Hoffman said, "He's all about order. That's the foundation 
to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, 
win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion."[6] Padres manager 
Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. "The daily preparation for his 
job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning 
... It was incredible to see live", said Black. "I played with George Brett, 
a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and 
a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber."[138] After Hoffman resurrected 
his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's "work 
ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there."[125] 
Hoffman was long regarded as one of the great teammates in baseball.[142][143] 
He was known as a leader in the clubhouse and a tutor to younger players. 
He mentored his successor in San Diego, Heath Bell, and the pitcher who 
supplanted him in Milwaukee, John Axford.[138] "Just watching him go about 
his business was a big thing to me", Bell said.[138] In his first game 
pitching setup to Axford after losing his closer role, Hoffman stayed in 
the dugout to watch Axford finish. Many relievers retire back to the clubhouse 
after being removed from a game. Hoffman's teammates noticed that he stayed 
supporting Axford through a bases-loaded jam.[116] Axford spent the season 
absorbing Hoffman's advice, and the two bonded.[138] "He took young players 
under his wing, especially relief pitchers", said former Padres teammate 
Brad Ausmus.[142] Hoffman regularly organized team dinners on the road 
or had team family gatherings at his home, whether it was with the Padres 
or the Brewers.[138][142] "It's very unusual for a pitcher, especially 
a relief pitcher, to be the team leader", Padres first baseman Phil Nevin 
said in 2002, "but everybody here looks to Trevor. This is his team."[6] 
According to Ausmus, Hoffman wanted his teams to feel like a family. He 
felt like he let his family down if he did not do his job on a particular 
night.[142] Still, he was accessible and held himself accountable on the 
rare occasions that he failed.[144] Hoffman was more accommodating for 
interviews after blown saves than he was after successful ones.[97] "The 
people asking the questions are not responsible for the ball flying out 
of the park", he explained.[145] Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman 
for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.[146] 
"My greatest memory of Trevor is from game No. 163 in 2007. Seeing his 
passion for the Padres, his love for his teammates, and his devastation 
over the loss and then handling each reporter's question with the utmost 
class and professionalism ranks as my greatest sports memory. How he handled 
that incredible loss says more about him than any save could. Life is about 
how you handle adversity and what he demonstrated that night was just remarkable. 
Baseball people revere Hoffman for how he treats people.[116] Ausmus says 
Hoffman goes out of his way to engage fans. Beyond shaking hands or signing 
autographs, he has extended conversations with fans who want to talk baseball.[1][142] 
When Hoffman passed on the Indians in free agency to stay with the Padres, 
he still sent an autographed jersey as a baby gift to then-Indians manager 
Eric Wedge.[116] After Hoffman saved the game to clinch the NL West on 
the last day of the 1996 season, he called Randy Smith, who traded for 
Hoffman as Padre GM before moving on to the Detroit Tigers. "Randy, I wish 
you were here", Hoffman said. "You're a part of this."[1] While celebrating 
his record setting 479th save against the Pirates, Hoffman tipped his cap 
to the Pittsburgh dugout, particularly Pirates manager Jim Tracy, who managed 
Hoffman in Cincinnati's Double-A Chattanooga farm team in 1991 after he 
was converted to a pitcher.[80][144] Despite losing his role as a closer 
in his final season, Hoffman took pleasure in supporting his teammates 
and "not being a cancer just because I was having trouble."[42] "Every 
boy who grows up dreaming of playing Major League Baseball, has a similar 
vision of what it would be like, and what they would be like as a player. 
They would imagine that they were a great player. They would stake claim 
to being an All-Star, and playing in front of packed stadiums. They would 
imagine signing autographs, and would always treat the fans well, and that 
the fans would return the favor. There would be images of teammates that 
loved them and revered them. And, that when they became superstars, they 
would always remember that they were just a regular person, like everybody 
else, no better. They might even dream of making the Hall of Fame one day. 
Now, I may not have quite lived up to that dream, but I am proud to say 
I am friends and played with the guy who stayed true to every bit of it 
... Trevor Hoffman." Hoffman dominated his position at a consistent level 
while enjoying incredible longevity over almost two decades.[142][147] 
After an 18-year career, the seven-time NL All-Star retired as MLB's all-time 
leader in saves with 601.[148] He was the first pitcher to reach not only 
the 500 save milestone, but also 600.[142] He converted 88.8 percent of 
his save opportunities, the third-highest rate among players with 300 or 
more saves.[149] Barry Bloom of MLB.com called Hoffman "the best National 
League closer of his era."[123] Hoffman is one of only three pitchers who 
have had streaks of four straight seasons with at least 40 saves;[note 
3] he achieved it twice.[150] His nine seasons of 40 or more saves are 
tied for the most all-time.[151] His 15-year stint as Padres closer was 
rare for a baseball role that exhibited a high turnover rate.[152] Hoffman 
had 12 seasons with at least 37 saves, 13 seasons with a sub-3.00 ERA and 
14 with an ERA+ of at least 130 (indicating that he was at least 30 percent 
better than the league average in ERA those years).[104] Four times he 
was in the top six in voting for the Cy Young Award, including twice as 
a runner-up.[153] Among pitchers to debut since 1969, he is one of only 
two ranked in the top 10 for lowest opponents' batting average against 
facing both lefties and righties.[note 4][142][154] Hoffman retired ranked 
first with 856 games finished, ninth with 1,035 games pitched, seventh-lowest 
in hits per nine innings (H/9) at 6.99, and seventh-best in strikeout-to-walk 
ratio (K/BB) of 3.69.[123][155] He had a 2.87 ERA and 1.06 walks plus hits 
per inning pitched (WHIP) for his career.[148] Though he was not a power 
pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher.[154] His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest 
in MLB history, and highest ever among relievers.[note 1][155][156] Sports 
journalist Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer 
in Baseball that Hoffman was "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather 
than heat."[157] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated 
with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman 
as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera.[104] 
"It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless 
you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said.[158] "There's 
not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen 
Scott Rolen said. "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually 
a word you use with a changeup."[9] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed 
at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. "I don't 
think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be 
one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said.[6] Another 
retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming 
from a power pitching style. "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 
[mph] have an ego about being able to do that. [Hoffman] just went right 
into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes 
out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did."[12] [Hoffman is] 
unique in the sense that what he does, closing, is usually a power pitcher's 
game. His change-up isn't just great, but dominating. What he does puts 
things in perspective. It's pitching, not just throwing, and using whatever 
stuff you have. He throws a pitch that looks so tempting that you can't 
lay off it. ... I feel vulnerable when I throw 93-96 mph. He's throwing 
81 and doing it with full confidence. During the time Hoffman held the 
career record for saves, many still considered Rivera the best closer of 
all time.[160][161][162] Like many other relievers of his era, Hoffman 
was compared to Rivera and his success in the playoffs.[147][163] While 
Hoffman had 601 regular-season saves, he only had four in the playoffs. 
Jayson Stark of ESPN wrote after Hoffman's retirement announcement, "Not 
everybody can have his team deliver him an October save opportunity to 
protect 47 different times." His last postseason save was in 2006, which 
was also his first postseason save in eight years. Though the Padres were 
in the playoffs three other times in that span, they never took a single 
lead.[163] Hoffman, however, did blow a save opportunity in his only World 
Series appearance and also failed on save tries twice in the final three 
days of the 2007 season as the Padres vied for the playoffs.[164] John 
Delcos of The Journal News, who covered the New York Yankees for eight 
years, believes the Yankees would have been just as successful with Hoffman 
instead of Rivera.[147] David Wells, who played with both Hoffman and Rivera, 
said, "[Rivera] has the better postseason record because the Yankees go 
to the postseason more than the Padres do, and he's had more opportunities 
there. The way they go about it, they're the best in the game. Trevor's 
the best in the West and [Mariano] is the best in the East."[165] Rivera, 
however, broke Hoffman's career save record in 2011.[160][166] In 2014, 
Major League Baseball introduced the Trevor Hoffman National League Reliever 
of the Year Award, which is awarded annually to the top reliever in the 
NL.[167] Hoffman became eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame starting in 2016.[123] In his debut, he fell short of the 75 percent 
of votes required for entry, but the 67.3 percent he received in his first 
year was promising for possible induction in the future.[168][169][170] 
No career reliever has reached Cooperstown on the first ballot,[note 5] 
and only six relievers have been inducted as of 2016.[172] Lee Smith, the 
all-time saves leader for 12 years before he was surpassed by Hoffman, 
was not inducted in 2016 after 14 years on the ballot.[148][173] Buster 
Olney of ESPN says any discussion of Hoffman's deficiencies in the postseason 
and All-Star Games are small samples compared to his incredible body of 
work over 18 years.[142] Zimniuch wrote that Hoffman and Rivera are "the 
best of the best of the one-inning closers".[174] Less than 10 percent 
of Hoffman's saves were over one inning.[11] Closers as a whole have been 
criticized for pitching almost exclusively in the ninth inning with no 
runners on base, while star relievers previously were called firemen, entering 
games in the middle of innings with runners on base and capable of pitching 
multiple innings.[175] Saves arguably became overrated as firemen gave 
way to closers.[164][175] However, Joe Strauss of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
in 2007 proposed that 500 saves (let alone 600) would be enough for him 
to validate Hoffman's induction if Sutter was invited with his 300 career 
saves.[147] Moreover, Hoffman might have accumulated much more than 601 
saves had he played for more successful teams. During his tenure in San 
Diego, the Padres won at least 90 games only twice and had nine losing 
seasons, including five with no more than 70 wins.[104] Hall of Fame voter 
Dan Graziano of the Newark Star-Ledger said, "I don't think much of the 
save as a stat, but I'm looking at a guy who's been a lockdown closer for 
more than a decade. Closers are a real and important part of the game, 
and either he or Rivera has been the best one for the past decade."[144] 
Some opponents of Hoffman's induction, including Jeff Passan of Yahoo! 
Sports and Keith Law of ESPN.com, maintain that his limited innings mitigate 
his impact compared to starting pitchers who have not been inducted,[176] 
while Joe Posnanski of NBC Sports and writer Joe Sheehan posit that those 
starters could have excelled as closers, but Hoffman would not have succeeded 
as a starter.[177][178] Hoffman pitched 1,089 1⁄3 innings in his career, 
which tops only Sutter (1,042) among pitchers already inducted in the Hall 
of Fame.[149] Hoffman's entrance into games, accompanied by the playing 
of "Hells Bells", became popular among fans after it was introduced in 
1998.[34][179][180] Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated wrote that Hoffman's 
"signature moment is one of the most electrically charged in sports: Padres 
fans rising and roaring, in Pavlovian fashion, upon hearing the first bell 
toll, the foreboding bonging like something out of Hitchcock as Hoffman 
enters slowly, stage right."[6] Opposing closer Jason Isringhausen said, 
"'Hells Bells' in San Diego is Trevor. It's like when you go there, you 
want to [win] two out of three so you can hear it once."[9] The initial 
introduction of Hoffman's entrance music was a forerunner in the heavy 
metal closer theme songs used throughout home stadiums.[33][181][182] The 
San Diego Union-Tribune initially noted, "[Hoffman's] entrance was more 
suited to the World Wrestling Federation than the national pastime."[183] 
By the end of Hoffman's career, San Jose Mercury News and ESPN.com wrote 
that the song should be honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame.[184][185] 
Other teams contacted the Padres for videos of the "Trevor Time" production.[33] 
Yankees executives witnessing Hoffman's entrance in 1998 were inspired 
to use the song "Enter Sandman" for Rivera's entrance starting the following 
season.[186] Statistics as of 2011 season Coinciding with his retirement 
from playing in 2011, Hoffman returned to San Diego as a special assistant 
to Padres team president and COO Tom Garfinkel.[20][197] "There's been 
a turnover of people [in the Padres front office] who wanted to reconcile 
and I've been cool with it. A couple of years definitely makes a big difference", 
said Hoffman.[87] In addition to his front office role, he also served 
as an instructor during spring training. In 2014, Hoffman became San Diego's 
upper-level pitching coordinator, essentially an additional pitching coach 
for the Padres at their Double-A and Triple-A levels. His new role also 
involved assisting San Diego general manager Josh Byrnes.[198] Under General 
Manager A. J. Preller in 2015, Hoffman became senior advisor for baseball 
operations, overseeing pitching instruction at all levels of the Padres' 
minor league system.[199] Hoffman, whose mother was born in England, was 
the bullpen coach for the Great Britain team during the qualifying round 
of the 2017 World Baseball Classic.[200] Hoffman met his wife, Tracy, in 
Buffalo, New York in 1992 where she was a real estate agent and a member 
of the National Football League's Buffalo Bills cheerleading squad. He 
asked her to marry him in 1993 while she was on the field during Super 
Bowl XXVII, which the Buffalo Bills lost to the Dallas Cowboys, 52–17.[6] 
Hoffman has three sons: Brody, Quinn, and Wyatt.[125] Hoffman's father 
died of cancer on Super Bowl Sunday in 1995.[2] Hoffman donated $200 for 
every save to the National Kidney Foundation. In honor of his father, a 
former Marine, Hoffman annually paid for game tickets and meals for 1,000 
members of the military and their families.[6] Italics denotes active player
