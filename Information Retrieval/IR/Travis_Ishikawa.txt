Travis Takashi Ishikawa (born September 24, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball first baseman who is currently a free agent. He stands 6 feet 
3 inches (1.91 m) tall and weighs 220 pounds (100 kg). He bats and throws 
left-handed. Previously, he has played for the San Francisco Giants, the 
Milwaukee Brewers, the Baltimore Orioles, and the New York Yankees. Ishikawa 
has also filled in as an outfielder at times in his career. Ishikawa grew 
up in Washington State. He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major 
League Baseball (MLB) Draft by the San Francisco Giants out of high school. 
He made his Major League debut with the Giants in 2006, but it was not 
until 2009 that he made it to the major leagues full-time. He started 2009 
as the Giants' first baseman but failed to produce offensively and was 
replaced part of the season by Ryan Garko. However, on defense he was third 
in the National League (NL) in fielding percentage. In 2010, he served 
as a pinch-hitter and defensive replacement for the Giants and won a World 
Series ring as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Ishikawa was designated 
for assignment at the end of spring training in 2011 and spent the entire 
season in the minor leagues. In 2012, Ishikawa signed with the Milwaukee 
Brewers, who used him mainly as a pinch-hitter and defensive replacement. 
Ishikawa spent most of 2013 in the minor leagues, though he played six 
games for the Baltimore Orioles and one game for the New York Yankees. 
In 2014 he made the Pittsburgh Pirates Opening Day roster. However his 
bat wasn't as hot as it was during Spring Training so the Pirates traded 
for 1B Ike Davis from the New York Mets and Ishikawa was designated for 
assignment. He was re-signed by his former team the San Francisco Giants 
in April and started for them in left field during the 2014 playoffs. On 
October 16, 2014, Ishikawa hit a walk-off three-run home run to give the 
Giants their third National League pennant in five years by defeating the 
St. Louis Cardinals. Ishikawa attended Federal Way High School in Federal 
Way, Washington, where he lettered in baseball, leading his team to the 
Washington State Class 4A Title as a junior in 2001 and to the title game 
as a senior in 2002.[1] He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major 
League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants.[2] The Giants gave him 
a $955,000 bonus to prevent him from attending Oregon State University. 
The bonus was the highest back then for a non-first-round player, cued 
on by the organization's approaching signing deadline. The Giants could 
afford to pay a 21st-round pick that much because their higher picks had 
signed quickly for routine bonuses.[3] Ishikawa began his career playing 
for the rookie-league Arizona League Giants in 2002. He batted .279 with 
10 runs scored, 19 hits, one home run, and 10 Runs batted in (RBI) in 19 
games (68 at-bats) before being called up to the Class A-Short Season Salem-Keizer 
Volcanoes of the Northwest League. With Salem-Keizer, he hit .307 with 
14 runs scored, 27 hits, one home run, and 17 RBI in 23 games (96 at-bats).[1][4] 
His performance helped Salem-Keizer win the Northwest League championship.[1] 
In 2003, Ishikawa was initially assigned to the Class A Hagerstown Suns 
of the South Atlantic League. After he batted .206 with 20 runs scored, 
40 hits, three home runs, and 22 RBI in 57 games (194 at-bats), he was 
demoted to Salem-Keizer. In 66 games (248 at-bats) with the Volcanoes, 
he batted .254 with 53 runs scored, 63 hits, three home runs, and 31 RBI.[1][4] 
Coming into 2004, Ishikawa was ranked the Giants' seventh-best prospect 
by Baseball America.[5] He spent most of 2004 with the Suns, batting .257 
with 59 runs scored, 92 hits, and 54 RBI in 97 games (355 at-bats).[4] 
He tied with Nate Schierholtz for the team lead with 15 home runs, and 
he won the Hagerstown Player of the Month award in July.[1][6] In the last 
month of the season, Ishikawa was promoted to the Class A-Advanced San 
Jose Giants of the California League, where he batted .232 with 10 runs 
scored, 13 hits, one home run, and 10 RBI in 16 games (56 at-bats).[4] 
He also played eight playoff games for San Jose.[1] Ishikawa was ranked 
the 10th-best prospect in the Giants' organization by Baseball America 
entering 2005.[5] In 2005, he spent the entire season with San Jose. In 
127 games (432 at-bats), he batted .282 with 87 runs scored, 122 hits, 
and 79 RBI.[4] His 22 home runs ranked fourth in the San Francisco Giants' 
organization and tied with Bryan LaHair, Travis Metcalf, and Aneudi Cuevas 
for seventh in the California League.[1][7] He appeared in six playoff 
games, batting .217 with four RBI as San Jose won the California League 
championship.[1] Before the season, Baseball America ranked Ishikawa the 
number four prospect in the Giants' organization. He attended spring training 
with the Giants for the first time in his career.[8] He was recalled from 
the minors for the first time on April 18 when Lance Niekro was placed 
on the Bereavement List,[9] and made his major league debut the same day 
in a 7–4 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks.[10] His first big league hit 
came on April 19 as a pinch-hit single off Brandon Webb in a 10–3 loss 
to Arizona.[11] The next day, he returned to the minors to make room for 
Niekro.[12][13] On May 26, he was recalled when Daniel Ortmeier was sent 
to the minors.[14] He had his first big league start that day against the 
Colorado Rockies and had three hits, two doubles and three RBI in a 9–0 
victory. After the game, Kevin Frandsen and Todd Greene gave him a pie 
in the face to celebrate.[15] After four games (during which he hit .500), 
he was returned to the minors on May 30.[16] He was recalled on June 13 
when Niekro went on the disabled list again.[17] After six games on this 
stint, he returned to the minors on June 21 when Frandsen was recalled.[12][18] 
In the minor leagues that year, Ishikawa played for the Class AA Connecticut 
Defenders of the Eastern League. In 86 games (298 at-bats), he batted .232 
with 33 runs scored, 69 hits, 10 home runs, and 42 RBI.[4] In 12 games 
(24 at-bats) with the Giants, he batted .292 with one run scored, seven 
hits, no home runs, and four RBI.[1] After the season, he played for the 
Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League.[19] Ishikawa attended 
spring training with the Giants in 2007 but was reassigned to the minors 
on March 6.[20] He spent the entire season in the minors, splitting time 
between Connecticut and San Jose. He began the season with Connecticut, 
hitting .214 with three home runs and 17 RBI in 48 games (173 at-bats) 
before suffering a knee injury. He was sent to San Jose on June 28 to recover 
from it, and he said that the Giants told him he would be promoted to Class 
AAA after a rehab assignment. However, he struggled and remained with San 
Jose for the rest of the year, batting .268 with 13 home runs, 34 RBI, 
and a .551 slugging percentage in 56 games (198 at-bats).[4][21] He batted 
.241, hit two home runs, and posted five RBI in the playoffs as San Jose 
won another California League championship.[1] In 2008, Ishikawa again 
attended spring training for the Giants and again began the season in the 
minors. On August 13, he was called up by the Giants to replace a slumping 
John Bowker as the Giants' starting first baseman, a position Ishikawa 
held for most of the remainder of the season.[22][23][24] Ishikawa hit 
his first major league home run on August 17 at Turner Field, a two run 
shot off Charlie Morton to right field in a 3–1 victory over the Atlanta 
Braves.[25] He set a career high by having three hits on September 12 and 
14 against the San Diego Padres. In 33 games (95 at-bats) with the Giants, 
Ishikawa batted .274 with 12 runs, 26 hits, six doubles, three home runs, 
and 15 RBI.[1] Prior to his callup by the Giants, Ishikawa played for Connecticut 
and the Class AAA Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League, batting 
.299 (121-for-405) with 69 runs, 35 doubles, 24 home runs, and 94 RBI in 
112 games with both clubs. Initially, he was assigned to Connecticut, where 
he batted .289 with 16 doubles, 8 home runs, and 45 RBI in 64 games before 
earning a promotion to Fresno on June 20. In 48 games with Fresno, he batted 
.310 with 19 doubles, 16 home runs, and 46 RBI in 171 at-bats.[4] He had 
the fourth-highest average, the second-most home runs, and the third-most 
RBI of players in the Giants' organization. In May and June, Ishikawa was 
awarded the Giants Player of Month title; from June 2 to 8 he was named 
the Eastern League Player of Week after amassing 10 hit in 22 at-bats (.455 
average) with three home runs and nine RBI.[1] Ishikawa retained the position 
of starting first baseman in 2009. In the first game of the season, Ishikawa 
had two hits, including a three-RBI triple in the first inning against 
Milwaukee Brewers' starting pitcher Jeff Suppan as the Giants won 10–6.[26] 
From May 25 through July 11, Ishikawa had his best stretch of the year, 
batting .326 while hitting seven home runs and driving in 17 runs.[1] He 
set a career high with four hits on May 25 and hit his first home run of 
the year, a three-run shot against Buddy Carlyle, in an 8–2 victory over 
Atlanta.[27] On July 3, he hit a ball that was originally ruled a double 
against Felipe Paulino, but the umpires changed it to a three-run home 
run after watching the replay as the Giants won 13–0 over the Houston Astros.[28] 
Ishikawa and Juan Uribe hit the Giants' first set of back-to-back home 
runs in 2009 against Josh Geer on July 9 in a 9–3 victory over the Padres.[29] 
Through July 26, he batted .269 with seven home runs and 30 RBI.[30] On 
July 27, the Giants traded for Ryan Garko from the Cleveland Indians, intending 
for him to replace Ishikawa at first base and provide more offense than 
Ishikawa had.[31] However, Garko struggled to produce offensively, and 
at the end of August Ishikawa began making most of the starts at first 
for the rest of the year.[30][32] On August 25, he snapped a 2–2 tie with 
a game-winning three-run eighth-inning home run against Jon Rauch as the 
Giants defeated Arizona 5–4.[33] In 120 games (326 at-bats), Ishikawa batted 
.261 with 49 runs scored, 85 hits, 10 doubles, nine home runs, and 39 RBI. 
His batting average at AT&T Park was fifth in the National League (NL) 
for home stadiums at .349, but he batted .162 in away games. Defensively, 
his .996 fielding percentage was third in the NL behind Adam LaRoche's 
.999 and Todd Helton's .998.[1] The Giants made Garko a free agent following 
the 2009 season, but they signed Aubrey Huff to play first base.[34][35] 
As a result, Ishikawa spent most of 2010 pinch-hitting, backing up Huff, 
and entering as a defensive replacement at first base late in games.[36] 
Ishikawa hit his first home run of the year on April 7, against Jeff Fulchino 
of the Astros in a 10–4 victory at Minute Maid Park.[37] Huff began platooning 
in right field with Schierholtz (and later, with Andrés Torres) at the 
beginning of July, and Ishikawa got the starts at first base when Huff 
was in right field.[36][38][39][40] On July 3, Ishikawa hit his first career 
grand slam against Ubaldo Jiménez (who had a 14–1 record at the time) in 
an 11–8 victory over Colorado.[41] Ishikawa hit .290 with two home runs 
and 17 RBI in 36 games from July 1 through August 13, and he even saw his 
season batting average go over .300 at times during the stretch. However, 
the acquisition of José Guillén on August 13 moved Huff back to first base, 
which returned Ishikawa to a utility role. Giants' manager Bruce Bochy 
said, "[Ishikawa]'s done a nice job."[36][42] Ishikawa ended up hitting 
.266 with three home runs and 22 RBI in 116 games (158 at-bats) for the 
season.[43] He batted .315 as a pinch-hitter, which ranked seventh in the 
NL. In a reverse from 2009, he batted .326 on the road while only hitting 
.194 at AT&T Park.[1] The Giants won the NL West for the first time since 
2003, and Ishikawa was on the Giants' active roster throughout their postseason 
run.[44] He had a pinch-hit double against Mark Lowe in Game 1 of the World 
Series against the Texas Rangers as the Giants won 11–7.[45] In Game 4, 
he got his first start of the postseason, playing first base in the Giants' 
4–0 victory.[46] He earned a World Series ring as the Giants defeated Texas 
in five games to win their first World Series since 1954.[47] After the 
final game of spring training in 2011, Ishikawa was designated for assignment 
and outrighted to the minors to make room for rookie first baseman Brandon 
Belt.[2] On April 24, Ishikawa hit a grand slam for Fresno against Kevin 
Mulvey in a 12-5 victory over the Reno Aces.[48] He did not appear for 
the Giants in 2011, spending the season with the Grizzlies until he injured 
his shoulder diving for a ball early in the year and underwent season-ending 
shoulder surgery in the summer of 2011.[49] In 56 games (175 at-bats) for 
the Grizzlies, Ishikawa batted .251 with 21 runs scored, 44 hits, 14 doubles, 
three home runs, and 18 RBI.[4] On November 2, the Giants made him a free 
agent.[43] Ishikawa signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers 
on December 12, 2011,[50] and made the team out of spring training as a 
backup first baseman and pinch hitter.[51] On May 2, he became the starting 
first baseman for the Brewers after Mat Gamel tore his anterior cruciate 
ligament.[52][53] He hit two home runs against Dillon Gee and had five 
RBI on May 15 in an 8–0 win over the New York Mets.[54] He batted .250 
with four home runs and 14 RBI in his first 32 games before going on the 
disabled list on May 27 with a left rib-cage strain.[53][55] He returned 
from the disabled list on June 23, but by then Corey Hart had taken over 
the first base job, limiting Ishikawa to a reserve role for the rest of 
the year.[53][56][57] On October 3, the final game of the season, Ishikawa 
had four RBI against Andrew Werner in a 7–6 loss to the Padres.[58] In 
94 games (152 at-bats), he hit .257 with four home runs and 30 RBI.[1] 
On November 3, Ishikawa elected to become a free agent after being outrighted 
off the Brewers' 40-man roster the day before.[59] On December 19, 2012, 
Ishikawa signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles.[60] 
He spent most of spring training with the team but was assigned to the 
Class AAA Norfolk Tides of the International League on March 27.[61] In 
49 games (177 at-bats) with Norfolk, he batted .316 with 56 hits, seven 
home runs, and 31 RBI.[4] Ishikawa was brought up from the Tides on June 
18 when pitcher Miguel González was placed on the paternity leave list; 
Ishikawa was called up to play designated hitter and give Chris Davis days 
off at first base.[62] Ishikawa appeared in six games for the Orioles, 
getting two hits in 17 at-bats with 1 RBI.[1] The Orioles designated him 
for assignment on June 29 to make room for Jair Jurrjens on the roster.[63] 
Ishikawa was claimed off assignment waivers by the New York Yankees on 
July 7.[64] He appeared in one game for the Yankees, starting at first 
base and going 0–2 with two strikeouts in a 5–1 loss to the Kansas City 
Royals.[65] On July 14, Ishikawa cleared waivers and elected free agency 
after being designated for assignment when Derek Jeter returned from the 
60-day disabled list.[66] On July 18, 2013, Ishikawa signed a minor league 
deal with the Chicago White Sox and was assigned to the Charlotte Knights 
of the International League.[67] In 34 games with the Knights (120 at-bats), 
he batted .250 with 30 hits, two home runs, and 23 RBI. His combined totals 
between Norfolk and Charlotte were a .290 batting average, 86 hits, nine 
home runs, and 54 RBI in 83 games (297 at-bats).[4] Only able to see his 
family for 14 days between February and September, Ishikawa considered 
retirement.[68] After Ishikawa decided to play for one more season, the 
Pittsburgh Pirates signed him to a minor league contract.[68] After prospect 
Andrew Lambo struggled in 2014 spring training, Ishikawa made the Pirates' 
roster.[69] He started on Opening Day (March 31) and platooned at first 
base with Gaby Sánchez, with Ishikawa playing against right-hander and 
Sánchez playing against left-handers.[70] Ishikawa batted .206 with one 
home run in 15 games. The Pirates traded for Ike Davis on April 18 and 
designated Ishikawa for assignment on April 19.[71] He became a minor league 
free agent on April 23.[72] Ishikawa signed a minor league deal with the 
Giants on April 24.[73] After languishing in the minors for several months, 
Ishikawa again considered retirement,[74][75] but the Giants promoted him 
to the major leagues on July 29 after ongoing injuries to first baseman 
Brandon Belt and a roster re-shuffle following a six-game losing streak.[76] 
In late September, with the return of Belt to first base and ongoing injuries 
to outfielders Michael Morse and Ángel Pagán, the Giants asked Ishikawa 
to play left field for the first time in his career.[77][78] Despite being 
a career first baseman and with just three career regular season starts 
in left field, Ishikawa became the Giants starting left fielder during 
the 2014 postseason.[68] In the 2014 National League Championship Series, 
Ishikawa batted 5-for-13 (.385) with 7 RBIs.[79] He recorded the game-winning 
RBI in Game 1 and drove in three runs via a bases-loaded double in Game 
3.[80] In Game 5, with the Giants leading the series three games to one, 
Ishikawa hit a 3-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning 
off of St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Michael Wacha to clinch the pennant 
for the Giants and their third World Series appearance in the past five 
seasons.[81][82] Ishikawa's home run was the first to send a National League 
team to the World Series since Bobby Thomson's Shot Heard 'Round the World 
in 1951. Ishikawa's home run was the first ever to end an NLCS and the 
fourth to end any LCS, after Chris Chambliss (1976 ALCS), Aaron Boone (2003 
ALCS), and Magglio Ordonez (2006 ALCS).[83] Ishikawa earned his second 
World Series ring when the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals four 
games to three.[84] On December 4, 2014, Ishikawa and the Giants agreed 
to a one-year, $1.1 million contract for 2015.[85] He started the 2015 
season on the disabled list due to a back injury suffered near the end 
of spring training.[86] At the conclusion of his rehab assignment, he was 
designated for assignment by the Giants and removed from the 40-man roster.[87] 
Ishikawa subsequently cleared waivers and was sent to the Sacramento River 
Cats.[88] On June 24, 2015, Ishikawa was called back up to the Giants to 
take the place of the injured Nori Aoki.[89] He was designated for assignment 
again on July 3. Ishikawa was claimed off waivers by the Pirates on July 
5, 2015.[90] In 38 games with the Pirates, Ishikawa hit .224 with one home 
run and 8 RBI.[91] In January 2016, Ishikawa was reportedly close to signing 
a minor-league contract with the Seattle Mariners, but the deal fell through.[92][93] 
He signed a minor-league contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 
9.[94] He opened the 2016 season with the Class AAA Charlotte Knights.[95] 
He was released on May 24, 2016.[96] On June 8th, Ishikawa signed a minor 
league deal to return to the San Francisco Giants organization. Ishikawa's 
father, Alan Ishikawa, is the controller for a chain of Washington supermarkets 
and a third-generation Japanese American (Sansei).[97] His mother is European-American. 
His paternal grandparents were held in an internment camp in Colorado during 
World War II.[97] Ishikawa met his wife, Rochelle, a dental assistant, 
after being hit by a pitch in the face in his first game with San Jose.[68][98] 
They married in 2007[99] and have three children,[100] including a daughter 
who was born on Ishikawa's 25th birthday, September 24, 2008.[101] Ishikawa 
became a Christian in 2007, which he believes helped him out of his slump 
that year. He says, "Faith will always be the biggest part of anything
