Georgetown University is a private research university in Washington, D.C. 
Founded in 1789, it is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher 
education in the United States. Located in Washington's historic Georgetown 
neighborhood, the university's main campus is noted for Healy Hall, a National 
Historic Landmark. Georgetown's law school is located on Capitol Hill, 
and the university has auxiliary campuses in Italy, Turkey and Qatar. Georgetown's 
founding by John Carroll, America's first Catholic bishop, realized efforts 
dating from the settlement of the province of Maryland in 1634 to establish 
a local Roman Catholic college in the face of religious persecution. The 
university expanded after the American Civil War under the leadership of 
Patrick Francis Healy, who came to be known as its "second founder," despite 
having been born into slavery. Jesuits have participated in its administration 
since 1805, a heritage Georgetown celebrates, but the university has always 
been governed independently of the Society of Jesus and of church authorities. 
Comprising nine undergraduate and graduate schools, the university enrolls 
approximately 7,500 undergraduate and 10,000 post-graduate students from 
a wide variety of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds, including 
130 foreign countries.[9] Georgetown's most notable alumni are prominent 
in public life in the United States and abroad. Among them are former U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, 
former U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, dozens of U.S. 
governors and members of Congress, heads of state or government of more 
than a dozen countries, royalty and diplomats. Campus organizations include 
the country's largest student-run business and largest student-run financial 
institution. Georgetown's athletic teams, nicknamed the Hoyas, include 
a men's basketball team that has won a record-tying seven Big East championships, 
appeared in five Final Fours, and won a national championship in 1984, 
as well as a co-ed sailing team that holds nine national championship and 
one world championship title. Jesuit settlers from England founded the 
Province of Maryland in 1634.[10] However, the 1646 defeat of the Royalists 
in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education 
and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including missionary 
Andrew White, and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor.[1] 
During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted 
Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until after the end of the American 
Revolution that plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for 
education in the United States were realized.[11] Because of Benjamin Franklin's 
recommendation, Pope Pius VI appointed former Jesuit John Carroll as the 
first head of the Roman Catholic Church in America, even though the papal 
suppression of the Jesuit order was still in effect. Carroll began meetings 
of local clergy in 1783 near Annapolis, Maryland, where they orchestrated 
the development of a new university.[12] On January 23, 1789, Carroll finalized 
the purchase of the property in Georgetown on which Dahlgren Quadrangle 
was later built.[13] Future Congressman William Gaston was enrolled as 
the school's first student on November 22, 1791, and instruction began 
on January 2, 1792.[12] During its early years, Georgetown College suffered 
from considerable financial strain.[14] The Maryland Society of Jesus began 
its restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, in the form of teachers 
and administrators, bolstered confidence in the college.[15] The school 
relied on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local 
lands which had been donated to the Jesuits. To raise money for Georgetown 
and other schools in 1838, Maryland Jesuits conducted a mass sale of some 
272 slaves to two Deep South plantations from their six in Maryland, ending 
their slaveholding.[16][17] President James Madison signed into law Georgetown's 
congressional charter on March 1, 1815, creating the first federal university 
charter, which allowed it to confer degrees, with the first bachelor's 
degrees being awarded two years later.[18][19] In 1844, the school received 
a corporate charter, under the name "The President and Directors of Georgetown 
College", affording the growing school additional legal rights. In response 
to the demand for a local option for Roman Catholic students, the Medical 
School was founded in 1851.[20] The U.S. Civil War greatly affected Georgetown 
as 1,141 students and alumni enlisted in one army or the other, and the 
Union Army commandeered university buildings.[11] By the time of President 
Abraham Lincoln's May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400 troops were living in 
temporary quarters there. Due to the number of lives lost in the war, enrollment 
levels remained low until well after the war. Only seven students graduated 
in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade.[21] When the Georgetown 
College Boat Club was founded in 1876, the school's rowing team, it adopted 
blue, used for Union uniforms, and gray, used for Confederate uniforms, 
as its colors to signify the peaceful unity among students.[22] Subsequently, 
the school adopted these as its official colors. Enrollment did not recover 
until during the presidency of Patrick Francis Healy from 1873 to 1881. 
Born in Georgia as a slave by law and mixed-race by ancestry, Healy was 
the first head of a predominantly white American university of acknowledged 
African descent.[b] He identified as Irish Catholic, like his father, and 
was educated in Catholic schools in the United States and France. He is 
credited with reforming the undergraduate curriculum, lengthening the medical 
and law programs, and creating the Alumni Association. One of his largest 
undertakings was the construction of a major new building, subsequently 
named Healy Hall in his honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school's 
"second founder."[23] After the founding of the Law Department in 1870, 
Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a 
university, and focus on higher education.[15] The School of Medicine added 
a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903.[24] 
Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated 
from the university in 1927.[25] The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was 
founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh, to prepare students for leadership 
in diplomacy and foreign commerce.[15] The School of Dentistry became independent 
of the School of Medicine in 1956.[26] The School of Business was separated 
from the SFS in 1957. In 1998 it was renamed the McDonough School of Business 
in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough.[27] Besides expansion of the university, 
Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School 
of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of 
the university classes were made available to them on a limited basis by 
1952.[28] With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female 
students in the 1969–1970 academic year, Georgetown became fully coeducational.[29] 
Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing Leo J. O'Donovan 
as president. He subsequently launched the Third Century Campaign to build 
the school's endowment.[30] In December 2003, Georgetown completed the 
campaign after raising over $1 billion for financial aid, academic chair 
endowment, and new capital projects.[31] John J. DeGioia, Georgetown's 
first lay president, has led the school since 2001, and has continued its 
financial modernization and sought to "expand opportunities for intercultural 
and interreligious dialogue." He opened a campus in Qatar.[32] Georgetown 
University was founded by former Jesuits in the tradition of Ignatius of 
Loyola; it is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.[13][33] 
Georgetown is not a pontifical university, though seven Jesuits serve on 
the thirty-six member Board of Directors, the school's highest governance.[34] 
Catholic spaces at the university fall within the territorial jurisdiction 
of the Archdiocese of Washington.[35] Fifty-two members of the Society 
of Jesus live on campus, and are employed by Georgetown mostly as professors 
or administrators.[36] Jesuit Heritage Week has been held every year since 
2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits to the Georgetown tradition.[37] 
The role that Georgetown's Catholic heritage has played in its policies 
has been controversial at times, even as its influence is relatively limited.[38] 
Stores in University-owned buildings are not allowed to sell or distribute 
birth control products.[39] Georgetown University Medical Center and Georgetown 
University Hospital, operated by MedStar Health, are prohibited from performing 
abortions.[40] As recently as 2004, the hospital did perform research using 
embryonic stem cells.[41] Georgetown has been criticized by religious groups 
such as the Cardinal Newman Society for hosting speakers such as John Kerry 
and Barack Obama, prominent pro-choice politicians.[42][43] Washington's 
Archbishop, Donald Wuerl, criticized the university for inviting Kathleen 
Sebelius to be a commencement speaker.[44] The university hosts the Cardinal 
O'Connor Conference on Life every January to discuss the pro-life movement.[45] 
Between 1996 and 1999, the administration added crucifixes to many classroom 
walls, a change that attracted national attention.[46] Before 1996, crucifixes 
had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms.[47] Some of these 
crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such.[48] According 
to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure to 
remove the crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he 
and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement.[49] The Intercultural 
Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various 
faith and culture symbols in the lobby.[50] As of 2014[update], the university 
has 7,636 undergraduate students, and 10,213 graduate students.[4] Bachelor's 
programs are offered through Georgetown College, the School of Nursing 
and Health Studies, the Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business, the 
School of Continuing Studies, and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign 
Service, which includes the Qatar campus. The now-defunct School of Dentistry 
closed in 1990 after 89 years in operation.[51] Some high school students 
from Georgetown Visitation are permitted to attend classes for Advanced 
Placement credit.[52] Georgetown University offers undergraduate degrees 
in forty-eight majors in the four undergraduate schools, as well as the 
opportunity for students to design their own individualized courses of 
study.[53] All majors in the College are open as minors to students in 
the College, the School of Nursing and Health Studies, and the School of 
Business. Students in the School of Foreign Service can complete select 
certificates which complement the school's focus on foreign affairs and 
attain a minor in one of twelve languages but do not have access to the 
same minor selection as the other three schools. All courses are on a credit 
hour system.[15] Georgetown offers many opportunities to study abroad, 
and about 50% of the undergraduate student body spends time at an institution 
overseas.[54] Master's and doctoral programs are offered through the Graduate 
School of Arts and Sciences, the Law Center, the School of Medicine, the 
McCourt School of Public Policy, and the School of Continuing Studies. 
Masters students occasionally share some advanced seminars with undergraduates, 
and most undergraduate schools offer abbreviated bachelors and masters 
programs following completion of the undergraduate degree. The McDonough 
School of Business and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service both 
offer masters programs. The School of Foreign Service is renowned for its 
academic programs in international affairs. Its graduate program was ranked 
first in the world by Foreign Policy and its undergraduate program was 
ranked fourth.[55] The Center for Contemporary Arab Studies also offer 
a Master's of Arab Studies, as well as certificates.[56] Each graduate 
school offers at least one double degree with another graduate school.[57] 
Additionally, the Law Center offers a joint degree with the Johns Hopkins 
Bloomberg School of Public Health.[58] The School of Continuing Studies 
includes the Center for Continuing and Professional Education, and operates 
four types of degree programs, over thirty professional certificates and 
non-degree courses, undergraduate and graduate degrees in Liberal Studies, 
as well as summer courses for graduates, undergraduates, and high school 
students.[59] As of 2012[update], Georgetown University employed 1,354 full-time 
and 880 part-time faculty members across its three Washington, D.C. campuses,[4] 
with additional staff at SFS-Qatar.[60] The faculty comprises leading academics 
and notable political and business leaders, and are predominantly male 
by a two-to-one margin.[61] Politically, Georgetown University's faculty 
members give more support to liberal candidates, and while their donation 
patterns are generally consistent with those of other American university 
faculties, they gave more than average to Barack Obama's presidential campaign.[62][63] 
The current faculty includes scholars such as the former President of the 
American Philological Association James J. O'Donnell, theologian John Haught, 
social activists Sam Marullo and Chai Feldblum, Nobel laureate George Akerlof, 
and preeminent hip-hop scholar Michael Eric Dyson.[64][65][66] Many former 
politicians choose to teach at Georgetown, including the former Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations 
Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. Agency for International Development administrator 
Andrew Natsios, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, and CIA director 
George Tenet. Internationally, the school attracts numerous former ambassadors 
and heads of state, such as Prime Minister of Spain José María Aznar, Saudi 
Ambassador Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, and President of Colombia Álvaro 
Uribe.[67][68][69] Georgetown University is a self-described "student-centered 
research university"[70] considered by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions 
of Higher Education to have "very high research activity."[71] As of 2014[update], 
Georgetown's libraries held over 3.5 million printed items, including 1.25 million 
e-books, in seven buildings, with most in Lauinger Library.[72] The Blommer 
Science Library, located in the Reiss Science Building on campus, houses 
most of the Science collection. Additionally, the Law School campus includes 
the nation's fifth largest law library.[73] Georgetown faculty conduct 
research in hundreds of subjects, but have priorities in the fields of 
religion, ethics, science, public policy, and cancer medicine.[74] Cross-institutional 
research is performed with Columbia University and Virginia Tech. In 2014, 
Georgetown received $172 million in external research grants, ranking #113 
amongst all universities in the United States, for research.[75] In 2012, 
Georgetown spent $180 million on research, ranking it 108th nationwide.[76] 
In 2007, it received about $14.8 million in federal funds for research, 
with 64% from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, 
the United States Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense.[77] 
In 2010, the school received $5.6 million from the Department of Education 
to fund fellowships in several international studies fields.[78] Georgetown's 
Vincent Lombardi Cancer Center is one of 41 research-intensive comprehensive 
cancer centers in the United States, and developed the breakthrough HPV 
vaccine for cervical cancer[79] and Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells (CRC) 
technology.[80] Centers which conduct and sponsor research at Georgetown 
include the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, the 
Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding and the Woodstock 
Theological Center. Regular publications include the Georgetown Journal 
on Poverty Law and Policy, the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, the 
Georgetown Law Journal, the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, 
and the Georgetown Public Policy Review. Admission to Georgetown has been 
deemed "most selective" by U.S. News & World Report,[93] with the university 
receiving nearly 20,000 applications and admitting 16.4% of those that 
applied during the 2014–2015 admissions cycle.[94] The Fiske Guide to Colleges 
states that "only Stanford and a handful of Ivy League schools are tougher 
to get into than Georgetown."[95] As of 2011[update], Georgetown's graduate 
schools have acceptance rates of 3.6% to the School of Medicine,[96] 19% 
to the Law Center,[97] 25% to the MSFS,[98] and 34.9% to the MBA program.[99] 
In 2004, a National Bureau of Economic Research study on revealed preference 
of U.S. colleges showed that Georgetown was the 16th most-preferred choice.[100] 
The undergraduate schools maintain a restrictive Early Action admissions 
program, as students who have applied through an Early Decision process 
at another school are not permitted to apply early to Georgetown.[4] 94% 
of students accepted for the class of 2014 were in the top 10% of their 
class and the interquartile range of SAT scores was 660–760 in Critical 
Reading and 670–770 in Math.[101] Georgetown accepts both the SAT and ACT, 
though does not consider the writing portion of either.[102] Over 55% of 
undergraduates receive financial aid, and the university meets 100% of 
demonstrated need, with an average financial aid package of $23,500 and 
about 70% of aid distributed in the forms of grants or scholarships.[103] 
Georgetown University has four campuses in Washington, D.C.: the undergraduate 
campus, the Medical Center, the School of Continuing Studies (in Chinatown) 
and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and Medical Center are together 
in the Georgetown neighborhood and form the main campus. Other centers 
are located around Washington, D.C., including the Center for Continuing 
and Professional Education at Clarendon in Arlington, Virginia. Transit 
between these locations and the Washington Metro is supplied by a system 
of shuttles, known as GUTS buses.[104] Georgetown also operates a facility 
in Doha, Qatar, and villas in Alanya, Turkey and Fiesole, Italy. In their 
campus layout, Georgetown's administrators consistently used the traditional 
quadrangle design.[105] Georgetown's undergraduate and medical school campuses 
are situated on an elevated site above the Potomac River overlooking Northern 
Virginia. Because of this, Georgetown University is often referred to as 
"The Hilltop." The main gates, known as the Healy Gates, are located at 
the intersection of 37th and O Streets NW, and lead directly to the heart 
of campus. The main campus is relatively compact, being 104 acres (0.4 km2) 
in area, but includes fifty-four buildings, student residences and apartments 
capable of accommodating 80% of undergraduates, and various athletic facilities.[106] 
Most buildings employ collegiate Gothic architecture and Georgian brick 
architecture. Campus green areas include fountains, a cemetery, large clusters 
of flowers, groves of trees, and open quadrangles.[107] Georgetown received 
a B grade on the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card, and new buildings 
and major renovations are required to meet LEED Silver criteria.[108] Healy 
Hall, designed by Paul J. Pelz in Neo-Medieval style and built from 1877 
to 1879, is the architectural gem of Georgetown's campus, and is a National 
Historic Landmark.[109] Within Healy Hall are a number of notable rooms 
including Gaston Hall, Riggs Library, and the Bioethics Library Hirst Reading 
Room.[110] Both Healy Hall and the Georgetown University Astronomical Observatory, 
built in 1844, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[111] 
In front of the Healy and Copley Hall buildings is the large front lawn 
area, which is crossed by walkways and paths that center on the statue 
of John Carroll. In addition to the front lawn, the main campus has traditionally 
centered on Dahlgren Quadrangle behind Healy Hall, which is home to Dahlgren 
Chapel; however, in recent decades, Red Square has replaced the Dahlgren 
Quadrangle as the focus of student life.[112] North of Red Square is an 
extended pathway that is home to buildings such as the Intercultural Center 
(ICC), the Reiss Science building, and the large Leavey Student Center. 
The northern terminus of the undergraduate campus is marked by St. Mary's 
Hall adjacent to Reservoir Road, home to the School of Nursing and Health 
Sciences. Across Reservoir Road is the Burleith neighborhood, where some 
upperclassmen rent houses off-campus. The medical school is located in 
the northwestern part of the main campus on Reservoir Road, and is integrated 
with Georgetown University Hospital.[113] The Medical campus includes the 
historic Medical-Dental Building, the Dahlgren Memorial Library, and other 
research and classroom facilities. In the last decade, the West side of 
the Hilltop has emerged as a new developing area of the main campus. The 
university completed the Southwest Quadrangle Project in late 2003, and 
brought a new 907-bed upperclassmen residence hall, the Leo J. O'Donovan 
dining hall, a large underground parking facility, and a new Jesuit Residence 
to the campus.[114] The school's first performing arts center, named for 
Royden B. Davis, was completed in November 2005. The new business school 
headquarters, named for Rafik Hariri, opened in Fall 2009, and Regents 
Hall, the new science building, opened in the Fall of 2012. These two large 
buildings, along with the adjacent Leavey Student Center, have become popular 
study spaces, and overlook a newly developed scenic lawn space.[115] Additionally, 
in the fall of 2014, the university opened a new student center, the Healey 
Family Student Center (HFSC) to complement the longstanding Leavey Center. 
The Healey Family Student Center is located on the 1st floor of New South 
Hall, a space which had functioned as the university's main dining facility 
until the opening of the Leo J. O'Donovan dining hall in 2003. It features 
over 43,000 square feet including a number of study spaces, conference 
rooms, dance and music studios, as well as a pub called "Bulldog Tavern" 
and a salad store "Hilltoss," which is operated by The Corp.[116] The university 
owns many of the buildings in the Georgetown neighborhood east of the main 
campus and west of 35th Street NW, including all buildings west of 36th 
Street. This area is known as "East Campus" and is used for upperclassmen 
housing, classroom space, along with specific institutions, offices, and 
alumni facilities. Additionally, the Walsh School of Foreign Service and 
the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences both have classroom buildings 
in this area.[113] Georgetown Visitation, a private Roman Catholic girls 
high school, is located on the northeast side of campus, on land adjoining 
the undergraduate campus.[117] As a location, Georgetown is ranked nationally 
as the second best college town by the Princeton Review.[118] The Georgetown 
neighborhood west of Wisconsin Avenue NW, is dominated by the presence 
of university students. Students have easy access to the M Street commercial 
area, the Georgetown Waterfront, and numerous trails that lead to the National 
Mall and other parks. Despite this, "town and gown" relations between the 
university communities and other Georgetown residents are often strained 
by facilities construction, enlargement of the student body, as well as 
noise and alcohol violations.[119] More recently, several groups of neighborhood 
residents have attempted to slow University growth in Georgetown, creating 
friction between students and the surrounding neighborhood. Despite the 
relative safety of the neighborhood, crime is nonetheless a persistent 
issue, with campus security responding to 257 crimes in 2008.[120] The 
Law Center campus is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood on New Jersey 
Avenue, near Union Station and consists of five buildings. First-year students 
at the Law Center can live in the single on-campus dormitory, the Gewirz 
Student Center.[121] Most second- and third-year students, as well as some 
first-year students, live off-campus. As there is little housing near the 
Law Center, most are spread throughout the Washington metropolitan area.[122] 
The "Campus Completion Project", finished in 2005, saw the addition of 
the Hotung International Building and the Sport and Fitness Center. G Street 
and F Street are closed off between 1st and 2nd Streets to create open 
lawns flanking McDonough Hall, the main building on the campus.[123] In 
December 1979, the Marquesa Margaret Rockefeller de Larrain, granddaughter 
of John D. Rockefeller, gave the Villa Le Balze to Georgetown University.[124] 
The Villa is in Fiesole, Italy, on a hill above the city of Florence. The 
Villa is used year-round for study abroad programs focused on specialized 
interdisciplinary study of Italian culture and civilization.[125] The main 
facility for the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies was donated 
to Georgetown in 1989 by alumnus and former United States Ambassador to 
Turkey George C. McGhee.[126] The school is in the town of Alanya, Turkey 
within the Seljuq-era Alanya Castle, on the Mediterranean. The Center operates 
study abroad programs one semester each year, concentrating on Turkish 
language, architectural history, and Islamic studies.[127] In 2002, the 
Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development presented 
the School of Foreign Service with the resources and space to open a facility 
in the new Education City in Doha, Qatar.[128] SFS-Qatar opened in 2005 
as a liberal arts and international affairs undergraduate school for regional 
students.[129] In December 2007, Georgetown opened a liaison office in 
Shanghai, China to coordinate with Fudan University and others.[130] In 
2008, the Georgetown University Law Center in conjunction with an international 
consortium of law schools established the Center for Transnational Legal 
Studies in London, England.[131] The Georgetown undergraduate student body, 
at 7,636 as of 2014[update], is composed primarily of students from outside 
the District of Columbia area, with 34% of new 2010 students coming from 
Mid-Atlantic states, 11% being international students and the remainder 
coming from other areas of the US.[132] The student body also represented 
129 different countries, with 11% being international,[133] including over 
330 undergraduate and 1,050 graduate students who chose to come to Georgetown 
as a study abroad destination in 2009–10.[134] In 2014–2015, the racial 
diversity of the undergraduate student body was 57.0% white, 8.8% Asian, 
6.2% black, and 7.5% Hispanic; Additionally, 55.1% of undergraduates are 
female.[135] Although it is a Jesuit university, only 41% of the student 
body identify as Roman Catholic, while 22% identify as Protestant as of 
2009[update].[136] Georgetown employs a full-time rabbi, as 6.5% of undergraduates 
are Jewish.[136] It was the first U.S. college to have a full-time imam, 
to serve the over four-hundred Muslims on campus,[137] and in 2014, they 
appointed their first Hindu priest to serve a weekly community of around 
one hundred.[138] Georgetown also sponsors student groups for Bahá'i, Buddhist, 
and Mormon traditions.[139] The student body consists of both religious 
and non-religious students, and more than four-hundred freshmen and transfer 
students attend a nonreligious Ignatian retreat annually, called ESCAPE.[140][141] 
A 2007 survey of undergraduates also suggests that 62.8% are sexually active, 
while 6.2% identify as LGBTQ.[136][142] Discrimination can be an issue 
on campus, and three-fourths of a 2009 survey considered homophobia a campus 
problem.[143] Newsweek, however, rated Georgetown among its top "Gay-Friendly 
Schools" in 2010.[144] A survey by the school in 2016 showed that 31% of 
females undergraduates reported experiencing unwanted sexual contact, and 
86% of LGBTQ students reported some form of sexual harassment at the college.[145] 
In 2011, College Magazine ranked Georgetown as the tenth most hipster U.S. 
college,[146] while People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals considered 
it the third most vegan friendly small U.S. school.[147] Almost all undergraduates 
attend full-time.[148] A majority of undergraduates, 76%, live on-campus 
in several dormitories and apartment complexes, including all underclassmen.[149] 
As of 2011[update], 1255 undergraduates and 339 graduate students live 
off-campus, mostly in the Georgetown, Glover Park, Burleith, and Foxhall 
neighborhoods.[150] Although many of the university's hall directors and 
area coordinators attend graduate level courses, on-campus housing is not 
available for main campus graduate students.[151] The school hopes to build 
such housing by 2020.[152] All students in the Medical School live off-campus, 
most in the surrounding neighborhoods, with some in Northern Virginia and 
elsewhere through the region.[153] As of 2012[update], 92.89% of Georgetown 
University undergraduates are involved in at least one of the 179 registered 
student organizations which cover a variety of interests: student government, 
club sports, media and publications, performing arts, religion, and volunteer 
and service.[154] Students also operate campus stores, banks, and medical 
services. Students often find their interests at the Student Activities 
Commission Club Fair, where both official and unofficial organizations 
set up tables.[155] The Georgetown University Student Association is the 
student government organization for undergraduates. There are also student 
representatives within the schools, to the Board of Directors, and, since 
1996, to the Georgetown Advisory Neighborhood Commission.[156] Georgetown's 
student organizations include one of the nation's oldest debating clubs, 
the Philodemic Society, founded in 1830,[157] and the oldest university 
theater group, the Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society.[158] Nomadic Theatre, 
founded in 1982 as an alternative troupe without an on-campus home, produces 
"plays which educate and challenge all members of the university community 
through thought-provoking theatre."[159] The Georgetown Improv Association, 
founded in 1995, performs monthly long-form improvisational shows on-campus 
at Bulldog Alley in addition to hosting "Improvfest", one of the oldest 
improv festivals in the country.[160] The Model United Nations team that 
is run by the Georgetown International Relations Club, the largest club 
on campus, and its affiliate, Georgetown International Relations Association, 
has attained the status of best in the world on several occasions.[161] 
There are a total of seven a cappella groups on campus, including The Georgetown 
Saxatones, The Georgetown Chimes, the Phantoms, Superfood, The GraceNotes, 
the Chamber Singers, Essence, Harmony, and the Capitol G's.[162] These 
groups perform annually at the "D.C. A Cappella Festival", held since 1991, 
and the "Cherry Tree Massacre" concert series, held since 1974.[163][164] 
The Georgetown University Band is composed of the Georgetown Pep Band and 
the Georgetown Wind Ensemble, and performs on campus, in Washington, D.C., 
and at post-season basketball tournaments.[165] In addition to student 
organizations and clubs, Georgetown University is home to the nation's 
largest entirely student-owned and -operated corporation, Students of Georgetown, 
Inc. Founded in 1972, "The Corp" operates three coffee shops, two grocery 
stores, a salad and health food service, catering and printing services, 
as well as running seasonal storage and airport shuttles for students.[166] 
The business has annual revenues of about $2 million,[167] and surpluses 
are directly re-invested into the Georgetown student body through Corp 
Philanthropy, which gave out over $85,000 in scholarships and donations 
to Georgetown groups in 2014–2015.[168] Georgetown University Alumni & 
Student Federal Credit Union is the oldest and largest all student-run 
financial institution, with over $17 million in assets and 12,000 members.[169] 
The Georgetown University Student Investment Fund is one of a few undergraduate-run 
investment funds in the United States, and hosted CNBC's Jim Cramer to 
tape Mad Money in September 2006.[170] Another student-run group, the Georgetown 
Emergency Response Medical Service, "GERMS", is an all-volunteer ambulance 
service founded in 1982 that serves campus and the surrounding communities. 
Georgetown's Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) unit, the Hoya 
Battalion, is the oldest military unit native to the District of Columbia,[171] 
and was awarded the top ranking among ROTC programs in 2012.[172] The proportion 
of ROTC students at Georgetown was the 79th highest among universities 
in the United States as of 2010[update].[173] GUGS, the Georgetown University 
Grilling Society, has been a Georgetown tradition since 2002, selling half-pound 
hamburgers in Red Square on most Fridays.[174] Georgetown University student 
organizations include a diverse array of groups focused on social justice 
issues, including organizations run through both Student Affairs and the 
Center for Social Justice. Oriented against gender violence, Take Back 
the Night coordinates an annual rally and march to protest against rape 
and other forms of violence against women.[175] Georgetown Solidarity Committee 
is a workers' rights organization whose successes include ending use of 
sweatshops in producing Georgetown-logoed apparel, and garnering pay raises 
for both university cleaning staff and police.[176] Georgetown Students 
for Fair Trade successfully advocated for all coffee in campus cafeterias 
to be Fair Trade Certified.[177] Georgetown has many additional groups 
representing national, ethnic, and linguistic interests. Georgetown's has 
the second most politically active student body in the United States according 
to the Princeton Review.[118] Groups based on local, national, and international 
issues are popular, and political speech is protected on campus. Student 
political organizations are active on campus and engage their many members 
in local and national politics. The Georgetown University College Republicans 
represent their party, while the Georgetown University College Democrats, 
the largest student organization on campus in 2008, represent theirs.[178] 
The reproductive rights organization H*yas for Choice is not officially 
recognized by the university as its positions on abortion are in opposition 
to university policy, prompting the asterisk in "Hoyas."[179] While not 
financially supported by the school, the organization is permitted to meet 
and table in university spaces.[180] The issue contributes to Georgetown's 
'red light' status on free speech under the Foundation for Individual Rights 
in Education rating system.[181] In 2010, the "Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive 
Justice" campaign led several protests against the school policy against 
the sale of birth control on campus,[182] and in 2007, Georgetown University 
Law Center students protested the university's decision to cease funding 
for a student's internship at Planned Parenthood's litigation department 
despite funding it previous years.[183] Law Center student Sandra Fluke 
petitioned the university to change its health insurance policy to include 
coverage for contraception for three years prior to addressing the issue 
before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in 2012. Though 
the remarks Rush Limbaugh subsequently directed at Fluke were criticized 
by Georgetown administrators as both misogynist and vitriolic,[184] the 
school remains opposed to the coverage of contraception.[185] Georgetown 
University has several student-run newspapers. The Hoya is the university's 
oldest newspaper. It has been in print since 1920, and since 1987, has 
been published twice weekly.[186] The Georgetown Voice, known for its weekly 
cover stories, is a newsmagazine that was founded in March 1969 to focus 
more attention on citywide and national issues.[187] The Georgetown Independent 
is a monthly journal of news, commentary and the arts.[188] Founded in 
1966, the Georgetown Law Weekly is the student-run paper on the Law Center 
campus, and is a three-time winner of the American Bar Association's Best 
Newspaper award.[189] The Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, 
established in 2000, is a student-managed, semi-annual publication on current 
affairs and international relations.[190] The Hoya and The Georgetown Voice 
both run online blogs, and there are other popular blogs written about 
the school and its sports teams. The Georgetown Academy, restarted in 2008 
after a hiatus, targets traditionalist Catholic readers, and the Georgetown 
Federalist, founded in 2006, purports to bring a conservative and libertarian 
viewpoint to campus.[191][192] Other political publications include the 
Georgetown Progressive, an online publication run by the Georgetown University 
College Democrats, and Counterpoint Magazine, a liberal monthly founded 
in the spring of 2011.[193] The Fire This Time is Georgetown's minority 
newssource.[194] The Georgetown Heckler is a humor magazine founded on 
the Internet in 2003 by Georgetown students, releasing its first print 
issue in 2007.[195] The Gonzo was a former student humor magazine, published 
from 1993 to 1998. The university has a campus-wide television station, 
GUTV, which began broadcasting in 1999. The station hosts an annual student 
film festival in April for campus filmmakers.[196] WGTB, Georgetown's radio 
station, is available as a webcast and on 92.3 FM in certain dormitories. 
The station was founded in 1946, and broadcast on 90.1 FM from 1960 to 
1979, when university president Timothy S. Healy gave away the frequency 
and broadcast capabilities to the University of the District of Columbia 
because of WGTB's far left political orientation. The station now broadcasts 
through the Internet in its headquarters in the Leavey Center.[197] Although 
Jesuit schools are not obliged to disassociate from Greek systems, many 
do, and Georgetown University officially recognizes and funds only one 
of the many Greek organizations on campus, Alpha Phi Omega, the national 
co-ed community service fraternity. Despite this, other Greek organizations 
exist on campus, however, none require members to live in fraternal housing.[198] 
Additionally, Georgetown University students are affiliated, in some cases, 
with fraternities at other nearby universities and colleges.[199] Active 
fraternities at Georgetown include Delta Phi Epsilon, a professional foreign 
service fraternity and sorority; Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional co-ed 
business fraternity; Alpha Phi Omega, a national co-ed community service 
fraternity; Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Jewish social fraternity; and social fraternities 
Sigma Phi Epsilon, Zeta Psi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Delta Phi Epsilon 
was founded at Georgetown in 1920, and members of their Alpha Chapter include 
Jesuits and several deans of the School of Foreign Service.[200] The Delta 
Phi Epsilon foreign service sorority, founded in 1973, is the only professional 
sorority active at Georgetown.[201] In October 2013 the first social Greek 
sorority came to the Georgetown campus with the Eta Tau chapter of Kappa 
Kappa Gamma, followed by the Theta Iota chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta in 
the spring of 2014.[202][203] Georgetown's chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi,was 
established in 2002.[204] Sigma Phi Epsilon chartered its chapter as a 
general social fraternity in 2007.[205] The Omega Lambda chapter of professional 
business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi replaced Delta Sigma Pi, which lost 
its charter in 2006.[206] The Zeta Psi chapter, named Gamma Epsilon, was 
chartered in March 2009 after a year as a colony.[207] Annual events on 
campus celebrate Georgetown traditions, culture, alumni, sports, and politics. 
In late April, Georgetown University celebrates Georgetown Day.[208] Besides 
the full-day carnival, the day rewards the best professor of the year with 
the Dorothy Brown Award, as voted by students. Halloween is celebrated 
with public viewings of alumnus William Peter Blatty's film The Exorcist, 
which takes place in the neighborhood surrounding the university.[209] 
Homecoming coincides with a home football game, and festivities such as 
tailgating and a formal dance are sponsored by the Alumni Association to 
draw past graduates back to campus.[210] The largest planned sports related 
celebration is the first basketball practice of the season. Dubbed Midnight 
Madness, this event introduces the men's and women's basketball teams shortly 
after midnight on the first day the teams are allowed by NCAA rules to 
formally practice together.[211] In 2013, Georgetown hosted the east regional 
finals round of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.[212] Georgetown University 
hosts notable speakers each year, largely because of the success of the 
Georgetown Lecture Fund and the Office of Communications.[213] These are 
frequently important heads of state who visit Georgetown while in the capital, 
as well as scholars, authors, U.S. politicians, and religious leaders. 
Many prominent alumni are known to frequent the main campus. The Office 
of the President hosts numerous symposia on religious topics, such as Nostra 
aetate, Pacem in terris, and the Building Bridges Seminar.[214] Georgetown 
fields 23 varsity teams and the Club Sports Board supports an additional 
23 club teams. The varsity teams participate in the NCAA's Division I. 
The school generally competes in the Big East Conference, although the 
football team competes in the Division I FCS Patriot League, the sailing 
team in Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association, and the rowing 
teams in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges. U.S. News & World 
Report listed Georgetown's athletics program among the 20 best in the nation.[215] 
Georgetown's student athletes have a 94% graduation success rate,[216] 
and over one-hundred have gone on to play professionally.[217] The school's 
teams are called "Hoyas", a name whose origin is uncertain. Sometime before 
1893, students well versed in classical languages invented the mixed Greek 
and Latin chant of "Hoya Saxa", translating roughly as "what (or such) 
rocks." The school's baseball team, then called the Stonewalls, began in 
1870, and football in 1874, and the chant likely refers to one of these 
teams.[218] By the 1920s, the term "Hoyas" was used to describe groups 
on campus, and by 1928, campus sports writers started using it instead 
of the older team name, the "Hilltoppers."[219][220] The name was picked 
up in the local publications, and became official shortly after. Jack the 
Bulldog has been the mascot of Georgetown athletics programs since 1962, 
and the school fight song is There Goes Old Georgetown. The men's basketball 
team is particularly noteworthy as it won the NCAA championship in 1984 
under coach John Thompson. The current coach is his son, John Thompson 
III, who coached the team to the Final Four in the 2007 NCAA tournament. 
The team is tied for the most Big East conference tournament titles with 
seven, and has made twenty-seven NCAA tournament appearances.[221][222] 
Well-known team alumni include Sleepy Floyd, Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, 
Alonzo Mourning, Allen Iverson, Jeff Green, and Roy Hibbert.[223] Georgetown's 
NBA alumni are collectively among the highest earners from a single program.[224] 
The sailing team has won nine national championships since 2001,[225] as 
well as one World Championship in match racing.[226] Over that time they 
have graduated 79 All-Americans and 6 College Sailors of the year. Georgetown 
has been nationally successful in both cross country and track and field,[227] 
and in 2011, the women's cross country team won Georgetown's only other 
NCAA Championship.[228] The rowing teams are perennial contenders as well 
for national titles.[229] The men's and women's lacrosse teams have both 
been ranked in the top ten nationally,[230][231] as have both soccer teams, 
with the men making the national championship game in 2012,[232] and the 
women making the national quarterfinals in 2010.[233] The rugby club team 
also made it to the Division II Final Four in 2005 and 2009.[234] Georgetown 
graduates have found success in a wide variety of fields, and have served 
at the heads of diverse institutions both in the public and private sector. 
Immediately after graduation, about 54–61% of undergraduates enter the 
workforce, while others go on to additional education.[235] Georgetown 
graduates have been recipients of 23 Rhodes Scholarships,[236] 21 Marshall 
Scholarships,[237] 26 Truman Scholarships,[238] and 14 Mitchell Scholarships.[239] 
Georgetown is also one of the top-ten yearly producers of Peace Corps volunteers 
as of 2010[update],[240] with 35 active and 866 total volunteers since 
1961.[241] Georgetown alumni have a median starting salary of $55,000 with 
a median mid-career salary of $110,000, according to Payscale.com.[235] 
NNDB, the Notable Names Database, lists 493 notable alumni as of 2015[update].[242] 
Eight former heads of state are alumni. Former President of the United 
States Bill Clinton is a 1968 graduate of the School of Foreign Service, 
and other former world leaders include Laura Chinchilla of Costa Rica,[243] 
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines,[244] Saad Hariri of Lebanon,[245] 
and Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador. Two SFS graduates are also currently 
elected presidents, Dalia Grybauskaitė of Lithuania, who completed a six-month 
program in 1992,[246] and Željko Komšić, one of the tripartite Presidents 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[247] Six alumni serve in the United States Senate, 
and thirteen in the House of Representatives. Current congressional alumni 
include Dick Durbin, Senate minority whip, and Steny Hoyer, House minority 
whip.[248] Governor Pat Quinn of Illinois graduated from the SFS in 1971 
while Governor Terry McAuliffe of Virginia received his J.D. from the Law 
Center in 1984.[249][250] On the U.S. Supreme Court, alumni include former 
Associate Justice Antonin Scalia and former Chief Justice Edward Douglass 
White.[242] Members of the current Obama Administration cabinet include 
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew who graduated from the law school in 1983 and 
White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough who received his master's degree 
in 1996. King Felipe VI of Spain, King Abdullah II of Jordan, Prince Guillaume 
of Luxembourg, Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud of the Saudi Arabia royal 
family, and Prince Pavlos of Greece and Denmark are among the royals who 
attended Georgetown.[251] Besides numerous members of the senior diplomatic 
corps, graduates have also headed military organizations on both the domestic 
and international level, such as former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 
and former National Security Advisor General James L. Jones.[252] Notable 
alumni in business include Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset 
Management, Patricia Russo, former Alcatel-Lucent CEO, William J. Doyle 
of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, and Ted Leonsis, owner of the 
Washington Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics franchises and former America 
Online executive.[253][254] Leonsis is among four other undergraduate alumni 
who own professional sports teams, making Georgetown the most popular undergraduate 
university for major North American sports franchise owners.[255] Actor 
Bradley Cooper, People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive 2011, is also a graduate 
of Georgetown and its English program.[256] Actors/comedians Nick Kroll, 
John Mulaney, Jim Gaffigan, and Mike Birbiglia are also graduates of Georgetown.[257]

Healy inherited African ancestry from his mother and was consequently classified 
as racially black according to the "one-drop rule" of 19th-century American 
society, he self-identified racially as white and ethnically as Irish American. 
c The undergraduate class of 2016 are students who begin school in August 
2012, as the expected matriculation is four years. d The total undergraduate 
enrollment numbers 7,636 students. However, the Traditional Undergraduate 
Student Population, (which is defined as undergraduate students taking 
at least one course at Georgetown's main campus, excluding non-degree students 
and students returning for a second degree in nursing but including students 
studying abroad, required by the 2010 Campus Plan not to exceed 6,675 students) 
numbered 6,684 students in Fall 2013. See 2013-2014 Compliance Report for
