Secondary average, or SecA, is a baseball statistic that measures the sum 
of extra bases gained on hits, walks, and stolen bases (less times caught 
stealing) depicted per at bat.[1] Created by Bill James, it is a sabermetric 
measurement of hitting performance that seeks to evaluate the number of 
bases a player gained independent of batting average. Unlike batting average, 
which is a simple ratio of base hits to at bats, secondary average accounts 
for power (extra base hits), plate discipline (walks), and speed (stolen 
bases minus times caught stealing).[2] Secondary averages have a higher 
variance than batting averages. The formula to calculate secondary average 
is: where The resulting number rounded to the thousandth place is a player's 
secondary average. Variations to the formula exist, with some statisticians 
not counting caught stealing while others multiply caught stealing to increase 
its significance/negative effects. Although they share no correlation, 
overall league averages for secondary average are inclined to correspond 
with league batting averages, which allows for a viable reference point 
for secondary average in comparison to batting average.[1] A player can 
possess a low batting average yet still be a valuable offensive contributor 
if he has a high secondary average.[3] However, a low secondary average 
is not necessarily an indicator of a poor hitter. Ichiro Suzuki is an example 
of a hitter who relies on batting average for most of his offensive production.[4] 
Furthermore, batting average and secondary average are not mutually exclusive; 
a player can have a high batting average as well as a high secondary average. 
The table below shows the leaders in both batting average and secondary 
average for the 2013 season (bold indicates leader in both categories). 
Secondary average operates under the principle that batting average is 
an incomplete indicator of a hitter's ability since batting average does 
not account for power, plate discipline, and speed. According to Scott 
Gray (working with Bill James), "Secondary average is a much better indicator 
of offensive ability than batting average".[6] Since secondary average 
evaluates a player's offensive contribution independent of batting average, 
it can identify players who have low batting averages yet are still productive 
offensively. For example, in 1990, Bill James identified Eric Davis as 
the most productive batter with a career average below .275; in spite of 
his low batting average, Davis had a career secondary average of .504, 
which was the highest of any active player at the time.[3] Batting average 
was not a great indicator of his true offensive value; secondary average 
was able to demonstrate his value more effectively. Adam Dunn is an example 
of a recent player who has a low batting average but an excellent secondary 
average, resulting from his high walk totals and power numbers.[4] Although 
Adam Dunn only has a career .238 batting average,[7] he has a career .456 
secondary average, ranking him 12th all-time.[2] As Chicago Sun-Times reporter 
John Grochowski demonstrated, Adam Dunn's offensive value is more apparent
