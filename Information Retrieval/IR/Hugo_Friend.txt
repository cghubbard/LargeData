Hugo Morris Friend (July 21, 1882 – April 29, 1966) was an American jurist 
who, in his youth, competed as an athlete in the long jump and hurdles. 
He is best remembered as the judge who presided over the criminal trial 
of the Chicago Black Sox, which ended in an acquittal, but did not affect 
their ban from baseball. Friend was born in Prague but came to the United 
States as an early age. He attended the University of Chicago beginning 
in 1901, where he became a track star. He was selected for the United States 
team for the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens and won a bronze medal. 
He became a lawyer in 1908 and a judge twelve years later. He presided 
over the Black Sox trial in 1921, and when they were acquitted, he responded 
to the jubilation in the courtroom with a smile. At the time of his 1966 
death, he was the oldest active member of the Cook County Circuit Court 
bench. Hugo Morris Friend, who was Jewish,[1] was born on July 21, 1882, 
in the city of Prague, in what was then the Austrian province of Bohemia. 
At an early age, he emigrated to the United States. He graduated from South 
Division High School in Chicago in 1901.[2] Friend attended the University 
of Chicago, where he was a track star. He twice won the Big Ten long jump 
championship. Friend was the captain of Chicago's Big Ten champion track 
team, the first time one of the university's teams had won the Big Ten 
Championship[3] He was selected for the United States team for the 1906 
Intercalated Games (sometimes termed the 1906 Olympic Games) in Athens.[2] 
and won a bronze medal in the long jump, finishing fourth in the 100 metre 
hurdles.[3] He also played football for Chicago, though never at the varsity 
level.[2] Friend received his undergraduate degree from Chicago in 1906; 
he continued at the university and secured his law degree in 1908.[2] Friend 
joined the Illinois Bar in 1908, and began the practice of law in Chicago. 
In 1916, he was appointed a Master in Chancery of the Superior Court of 
Cook County by Judge Albert C. Barnes. On September 18, 1920, Republican 
Governor Frank Lowden appointed him to the Cook County Circuit Court.[2] 
In 1921, Judge Friend was assigned the case of the Chicago Black Sox; the 
players had been suspended from baseball after having been indicted for 
throwing the 1919 World Series.[4] The case had been marked by theft of 
the incriminating statements made by some of the players to the grand jury. 
At the conclusion of the evidence, Judge Friend said of the cases against 
two of the players, Buck Weaver and Happy Felsch, that they were so weak 
that he doubted if he could let the convictions stand.[5] He was not called 
upon to do so; all of the defendants were acquitted amid scenes of jubilation, 
observed by a smiling Judge Friend.[5] The following day, Baseball Commissioner 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis issued a statement stating that no player who had 
agreed to throw a baseball game, or sat in on meetings to that end, would 
ever play professional baseball thereafter.[6] In 1928, Friend presided 
over the case against Chicago Mayor William Hale Thompson and three codefendants, 
ordering them to pay over $2 million paid[by whom?] to real estate experts. 
He was reversed in his judgment against Mayor Thompson and one of the co-defendants 
by the Illinois Supreme Court.[4] In 1957, he cleared the way for the movie 
The Miracle to be shown in Chicago, ruling it was not obscene. He died 
on April 29, 1966, at age 83 the oldest active Cook County Circuit Court 
judge, while listening to the broadcast of a Chicago White Sox–Cleveland 
Indians game.[4] He was elected in 2006 into the University of Chicago 
Athletic Hall of Fame. His listing cites his 1906 "Olympic" accomplishments 
and his Big Ten feats, including his track team captaincy.[3] In 1920,
