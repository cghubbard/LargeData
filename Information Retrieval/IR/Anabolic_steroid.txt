Anabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic-androgenic steroids 
(AAS),[1] are steroidal androgens that are structurally related to and 
have similar effects as testosterone in the body. They are anabolic and 
increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles. AAS also 
have androgenic and virilizing effects, including induction of the development 
and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the 
growth of the vocal cords and body hair. The word anabolic, referring to 
anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, "that which is thrown 
up, mound." AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically 
in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty 
and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and AIDS. The American 
College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate 
diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases 
and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity 
exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS 
in some individuals.[2] Health risks can be produced by long-term use or 
excessive doses of AAS.[3][4] These effects include harmful changes in 
cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density 
lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most 
oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle 
of the heart.[5] Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia 
and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses 
for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs 
are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to 
gain unfair advantage in competitive physical competitions. Their use is 
referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. For many 
years, AAS have been by far the most detected doping substances in IOC-accredited 
laboratories.[6][7] In countries where AAS are controlled substances, there 
is often a black market in which smuggled, clandestinely manufactured or 
even counterfeit drugs are sold to users. The most commonly used AAS in 
medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but most commonly testosterone 
undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone 
propionate),[8] nandrolone (as, most commonly, nandrolone decanoate or 
nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone).[1] 
Others also available and used commonly but to a lesser extent include 
methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well 
as drostanolone propionate (dromostanolone propionate), metenolone (methylandrostenolone), 
and fluoxymesterone.[1] Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are 
used in veterinary medicine.[1] Since the discovery and synthesis of testosterone 
in the 1930s, anabolic steroids have been used by physicians for many purposes, 
with varying degrees of success, for the treatment of: Most steroid users 
are not athletes.[32] Between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the 
population) are thought to have misused AAS in the United States.[33] Studies 
in the United States have shown that anabolic steroid users tend to be 
mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who 
are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for 
cosmetic purposes.[34] "Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids 
and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent 
saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue 
Cross Blue Shield found."(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical 
use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%.[35] According 
to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders 
and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such 
as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials,[36] though 
a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among 
individuals using anabolic steroids for non-medical purposes, less than 
1%.[37] Another 2007 study found that 74% of non-medical anabolic steroid 
users had post-secondary degrees and more had completed college and fewer 
had failed to complete high school than is expected from the general populace.[37] 
The same study found that individuals using anabolic steroids for non-medical 
purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than 
the general population.[37] Anabolic steroid users tend to research the 
drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, 
the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical 
handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can 
provide questionable or inaccurate information.[38] Anabolic steroid users 
tend to be disillusioned by the portrayal of anabolic steroids as deadly 
in the media and in politics.[39] According to one study, AAS users also 
distrust their physicians and in the sample 56% had not disclosed their 
AAS use to their physicians.[40] Another 2007 study had similar findings, 
showing that, while 66% of individuals using anabolic steroids for non-medical 
purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 
58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's 
knowledge of non-medical anabolic steroid use was lacking, and 99% felt 
that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of anabolic 
steroid use.[37] A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users 
were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed 
stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles.[41] A recent study 
in the Journal of Health Psychology showed that many users believed that 
steroids used in moderation were safe.[42] Anabolic steroids have been 
used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to 
attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. These sports 
include bodybuilding, weightlifting, shot put and other track and field, 
cycling, baseball, wrestling, mixed martial arts, boxing, football, and 
cricket. Such use is prohibited by the rules of the governing bodies of 
most sports. Anabolic steroid use occurs among adolescents, especially 
by those participating in competitive sports. It has been suggested that 
the prevalence of use among high-school students in the U.S. may be as 
high as 2.7%.[43] Male students used anabolic steroids more frequently 
than female students and, on average, those that participated in sports 
used steroids more often than those that did not. There are four common 
forms in which anabolic steroids are administered: oral pills; injectable 
steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Oral administration 
is the most convenient. Testosterone administered by mouth is rapidly absorbed, 
but it is largely converted to inactive metabolites, and only about 1/6 
is available in active form. In order to be sufficiently active when given 
by mouth, testosterone derivatives are alkylated at the 17 position, e.g. 
methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone. This modification reduces the liver's 
ability to break down these compounds before they reach the systemic circulation. 
Testosterone can be administered parenterally, but it has more irregular 
prolonged absorption time and greater activity in muscle in enanthate, 
undecanoate, or cypionate ester form. These derivatives are hydrolyzed 
to release free testosterone at the site of injection; absorption rate 
(and thus injection schedule) varies among different esters, but medical 
injections are normally done anywhere between semi-weekly to once every 
12 weeks. A more frequent schedule may be desirable in order to maintain 
a more constant level of hormone in the system.[44] Injectable steroids 
are typically administered into the muscle, not into the vein, to avoid 
sudden changes in the amount of the drug in the bloodstream. In addition, 
because estered testosterone is dissolved in oil, intravenous injection 
has the potential to cause a dangerous embolism (clot) in the bloodstream. 
Transdermal patches (adhesive patches placed on the skin) may also be used 
to deliver a steady dose through the skin and into the bloodstream. Testosterone-containing 
creams and gels that are applied daily to the skin are also available, 
but absorption is inefficient (roughly 10%, varying between individuals) 
and these treatments tend to be more expensive. Individuals who are especially 
physically active and/or bathe often may not be good candidates, since 
the medication can be washed off and may take up to six hours to be fully 
absorbed. There is also the risk that an intimate partner or child may 
come in contact with the application site and inadvertently dose himself 
or herself; children and women are highly sensitive to testosterone and 
can suffer unintended masculinization and health effects, even from small 
doses. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering 
anabolic steroids for non-medical purposes.[37] The traditional routes 
of administration do not have differential effects on the efficacy of the 
drug. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of anabolic steroids 
are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles 
such as first-pass metabolism. However, the orally available forms of AAS 
may cause liver damage in high doses.[7][45] A 2005 review in CNS Drugs 
determined that "significant psychiatric symptoms including aggression 
and violence, mania, and less frequently psychosis and suicide have been 
associated with steroid abuse. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms 
of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS".[47] High concentrations 
of AAS, comparable to those likely sustained by many recreational AAS users, 
produce apoptotic effects on neurons[citation needed], raising the specter 
of possibly irreversible neurotoxicity. Recreational AAS use appears to 
be associated with a range of potentially prolonged psychiatric effects, 
including dependence syndromes, mood disorders, and progression to other 
forms of substance abuse, but the prevalence and severity of these various 
effects remains poorly understood.[48] There is no evidence that steroid 
dependence develops from therapeutic use of anabolic steroids to treat 
medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among 
weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic 
doses.[49] Mood disturbances (e.g. depression, [hypo-]mania, psychotic 
features) are likely to be dose- and drug-dependent, but AAS dependence 
or withdrawal effects seem to occur only in a small number of AAS users.[6] 
Large-scale long-term studies of psychiatric effects on AAS users are not 
currently available.[48] In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study 
on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence 
of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes 
in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout 
the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported 
AAS use.[50] A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 
320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric 
side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of 
abuse.[51] DSM-IV lists General diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder 
guideline that "The pattern must not be better accounted for as a manifestation 
of another mental disorder, or to the direct physiological effects of a 
substance (e.g. drug or medication) or a general medical condition (e.g. 
head trauma).". As a result, anabolic steroid users may get misdiagnosed 
by a psychiatrist not told about their habit.[52] Cooper, Noakes, Dunne, 
Lambert, and Rochford identified that anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) 
using individuals are more likely to score higher on borderline (4.7 times), 
antisocial (3.8 times), paranoid (3.4 times), schizotypal (3.1 times), 
histrionic (2.9 times), passive-aggressive (2.4 times), and narcissistic 
(1.6 times) personality profiles than non-users.[53] Other studies have 
suggested that antisocial personality disorder is slightly more likely 
among anabolic steroid users than among non-users (Pope & Katz, 1994).[52] 
Bipolar dysfunction,[54] substance dependency, and conduct disorder have 
also been associated with AAS use.[55] Affective disorders have long been 
recognised as a complication of anabolic steroid use. Case reports describe 
both hypomania and mania, along with irritability, elation, recklessness, 
racing thoughts and feelings of power and invincibility that did not meet 
the criteria for mania/hypomania.[56] Of 53 bodybuilders who used anabolic 
steroids, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance.[57] From the 
mid-1980s onward, the media reported "roid rage" as a side-effect of AAS.[58]:23 
A 2005 review determined that some, but not all, randomized controlled 
studies have found that anabolic steroid use correlates with hypomania 
and increased aggressiveness, but pointed out that attempts to determine 
whether AAS use triggers violent behavior have failed, primarily because 
of high rates of non-participation.[59] A 2008 study on a nationally representative 
sample of young adult males in the United States found an association between 
lifetime and past-year self-reported anabolic-androgenic steroid use and 
involvement in violent acts. Compared with individuals that did not use 
steroids, young adult males that used anabolic-androgenic steroids reported 
greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the 
effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug 
use.[60] A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time 
also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid 
use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current 
steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage 
of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe 
enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports.[61] A 
1996 randomized controlled trial, which involved 43 men, did not find an 
increase in the occurrence of angry behavior during 10 weeks of administration 
of testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week, but this study screened out subjects 
that had previously abused steroids or had any psychiatric antecedents.[62][63] 
A trial conducted in 2000 using testosterone cypionate at 600 mg/week found 
that treatment significantly increased manic scores on the YMRS, and aggressive 
responses on several scales. The drug response was highly variable. However: 
84% of subjects exhibited minimal psychiatric effects, 12% became mildly 
hypomanic, and 4% (2 subjects) became markedly hypomanic. The mechanism 
of these variable reactions could not be explained by demographic, psychological, 
laboratory, or physiological measures.[64] A 2006 study of two pairs of 
identical twins, in which one twin used anabolic steroids and the other 
did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high 
levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not 
found in the "control" twin.[65] A small-scale study of 10 AAS users found 
that cluster B personality disorders were confounding factors for aggression.[66] 
Androgenic steroids are known to increase aggression with greater likelihood 
when compared to more anabolic steroids. Trenbolone is frequently noted 
for its increases in aggression.[citation needed] Equipoise is known to 
increase anxiety in some users.[citation needed] The relationship between 
AAS use and depression is inconclusive. There have been anecdotal reports 
of depression and suicide in teenage steroid users,[67] but little systematic 
evidence. A 1992 review found that anabolic-androgenic steroids may both 
relieve and cause depression, and that cessation or diminished use of anabolic-androgenic 
steroids may also result in depression, but called for additional studies 
due to disparate data.[68] In the case of suicide, 3.9% of a sample of 
77 those classified as AAS users reported attempting suicide during withdrawal 
(Malone, Dimeff, Lombardo, & Sample, 1995).[69] Depending on the length 
of drug abuse, there is a chance that the immune system can be damaged. 
Most of these side-effects are dose-dependent, the most common being elevated 
blood pressure, especially in those with pre-existing hypertension.[70] 
In addition to morphological changes of the heart which may alter cardiovascular 
inefficiency irreversibly. Anabolic steroids have been shown to alter fasting 
blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests.[71] Anabolic steroids such as 
testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease[3] or coronary 
artery disease.[72][73] Acne is fairly common among anabolic steroid users, 
mostly due to stimulation of the sebaceous glands by increased testosterone 
levels.[6][74] Conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) 
can accelerate the rate of premature baldness for males genetically predisposed, 
but testosterone itself can produce baldness in females.[75] A number of 
severe side-effects can occur if adolescents use anabolic steroids. For 
example, the steroids may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature 
epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting 
in stunted growth. Other effects include, but are not limited to, accelerated 
bone maturation, increased frequency and duration of erections, and premature 
sexual development. Anabolic steroid use in adolescence is also correlated 
with poorer attitudes related to health.[76] WHO organization International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) list Androgenic (anabolic) steroids 
under Group 2A: Probably carcinogenic to humans.[77] Other side-effects 
can include alterations in the structure of the heart, such as enlargement 
and thickening of the left ventricle, which impairs its contraction and 
relaxation.[5] Possible effects of these alterations in the heart are hypertension, 
cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, heart attacks, and sudden 
cardiac death.[78] These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, 
but steroid use may accelerate this process.[79][80] However, both the 
connection between changes in the structure of the left ventricle and decreased 
cardiac function, as well as the connection to steroid use have been disputed.[81][82] 
AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids 
cause an increase in LDL "bad" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL "good" 
cholesterol.[83] In addition, steroids provoke a rapid increase in body 
weight and an accompanying rise in blood pressure, both of which leave 
users more vulnerable to a cardiovascular event.[citation needed] AAS use 
in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in 
high doses.[citation needed] Low doses of anabolic steroids such as oxandrolone 
are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only 
quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height.[84] There are also 
sex-specific side effects of anabolic steroids. Development of breast tissue 
in males, a condition called gynecomastia (which is usually caused by high 
levels of circulating estradiol), may arise because of increased conversion 
of testosterone to estradiol by the enzyme aromatase.[85] Reduced sexual 
function and temporary infertility can also occur in males.[14][86][87] 
Another male-specific side-effect that can occur is testicular atrophy, 
caused by the suppression of natural testosterone levels, which inhibits 
production of sperm (most of the mass of the testes is developing sperm). 
This side-effect is temporary: The size of the testicles usually returns 
to normal within a few weeks of discontinuing anabolic steroid use as normal 
production of sperm resumes.[88] Female-specific side effects include increases 
in body hair, permanent deepening of the voice, enlarged clitoris, and 
temporary decreases in menstrual cycles. Alteration of fertility and ovarian 
cysts can also occur in females.[89] When taken during pregnancy, anabolic 
steroids can affect fetal development by causing the development of male 
features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus.[90] 
Kidney tests revealed that nine of the ten steroid users developed a condition 
called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a type of scarring within the 
kidneys. The kidney damage in the bodybuilders has similarities to that 
seen in morbidly obese patients, but appears to be even more severe.[91] 
High doses of oral anabolic steroid compounds can cause liver damage, as 
the steroids are metabolized (17α-alkylated) in the digestive system to 
increase their bioavailability and stability.[4] Peliosis hepatis has been 
increasingly recognised with the use of anabolic steroids. The pharmacodynamics 
of anabolic steroids are unlike peptide hormones. Water-soluble peptide 
hormones cannot penetrate the fatty cell membrane and only indirectly affect 
the nucleus of target cells through their interaction with the cell’s surface 
receptors. However, as fat-soluble hormones, anabolic steroids are membrane-permeable 
and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic 
action of anabolic steroids begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates 
the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor located 
in the cytoplasm of that cell. From there, the compound hormone-receptor 
diffuses into the nucleus, where it either alters the expression of genes[93] 
or activates processes that send signals to other parts of the cell.[94] 
Different types of anabolic steroids bind to the androgen receptor with 
different affinities, depending on their chemical structure.[6] Some anabolic 
steroids such as methandrostenolone bind weakly to this receptor in vitro, 
but still exhibit androgenic effects in vivo. The reason for this discrepancy 
is not known.[95] The effect of anabolic steroids on muscle mass is caused 
in at least two ways:[96] first, they increase the production of proteins; 
second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone 
cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. 
It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur 
through anabolic steroids inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones 
called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles.[97] Anabolic 
steroids also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage 
cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead.[98] 
Anabolic steroids can also decrease fat by increasing basal metabolic rate 
(BMR), since an increase in muscle mass increases BMR.[citation needed] 
As the name suggests, anabolic-androgenic steroids have two different, 
but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote 
anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilising), meaning that they 
affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Some 
examples of the anabolic effects of these hormones are increased protein 
synthesis from amino acids, increased appetite, increased bone remodeling 
and growth, and stimulation of bone marrow, which increases the production 
of red blood cells. Through a number of mechanisms anabolic steroids stimulate 
the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of 
skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength.[99][100][101] The androgenic 
effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects 
of the steroid can be irreversible. Processes affected include pubertal 
growth, sebaceous gland oil production, and sexuality (especially in fetal 
development). Some examples of virilizing effects are growth of the clitoris 
in females and the penis in male children (the adult penis size does not 
change due to steroids[medical citation needed] ), increased vocal cord 
size, increased libido, suppression of natural sex hormones, and impaired 
production of sperm.[102] Effects on women include deepening of the voice, 
facial hair growth, and possibly a decrease in breast size. Men may develop 
an enlargement of breast tissue, known as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, 
and a reduced sperm count.[103] The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS 
is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these 
compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects 
are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating 
hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic 
ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein 
loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination 
of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, 
which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic 
activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked 
in humans, where all anabolic steroids have significant androgenic effects.[44] 
A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, 
dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate 
(VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator 
of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic 
effect. Two or more batches of rats are castrated and given no treatment 
and respectively some AAS of interest. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated 
as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that 
compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). 
The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone 
(typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and 
used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic 
ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above).[95][104] In the 
early 2000s, this procedure was standardized and generalized throughout 
OECD in what is now known as the Hershberger assay. Body weight in men 
may increase by 2–5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which 
may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. Animal studies also 
found that fat mass was reduced, but most studies in humans failed to elucidate 
significant fat mass decrements. The effects on lean body mass have been 
shown to be dose-dependent. Both muscle hypertrophy and the formation of 
new muscle fibers have been observed. The hydration of lean mass remains 
unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot 
be ruled out.[6] The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, 
and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions 
because of predominance of androgen receptors in the upper body. The largest 
difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed 
in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle 
as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. After drug withdrawal, 
the effects fade away slowly, but may persist for more than 6–12 weeks 
after cessation of AAS use.[6] Strength improvements in the range of 5–20% 
of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well 
as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant 
improvements were observed is the bench press.[6] For almost two decades, 
it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced 
strength athletes.[105][106] A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, 
however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program 
accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength 
more than training alone does.[6][62] This dose is sufficient to significantly 
improve lean muscle mass relative to placebo even in subjects that did 
not exercise at all.[62] The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate 
were highly dose dependent.[6][107] Endogenous androgens like testosterone 
and DHT and synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroids mediate their effects 
by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR).[1] On the basis 
of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into 
two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic.[1] 
Dissociation between the ratios of these two types of effects is observed 
in rat bioassays with various anabolic-androgenic steroids relative to 
the ratio observed with testosterone.[1] Explanations for the dissociation 
include differences in intracellular metabolism, functional selectivity 
(recruitment of coactivators), and non-genomic mechanisms (i.e., signaling 
through non-AR membrane androgen receptors).[1] Support for the latter 
two explanations is limited and more hypothetical, but there is a good 
deal of support for the intracellular metabolism explanation.[1] The measurement 
of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among anabolic-androgenic 
steroids is based largely on a simple although arguably unsophisticated 
and outdated model involving rat tissue bioassays.[1] It is referred to 
as the myotrophic-androgenic index.[1] In this model, anabolic (myotrophic) 
activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator 
ani muscle and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight 
of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles) 
in response to exposure of the anabolic-androgenic steroid, and the measurements 
are then compared and used to form a ratio.[1] Testosterone is metabolized 
in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more 
potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen 
and lacks significant AR affinity.[1] In addition, DHT is metabolized by 
3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
(3β-HSD) into metabolites with little or no AR affinity.[1] 5α-Reductase 
is widely distributed throughout the body, and is concentrated to various 
extents in skin (particularly the scalp, beard-area of the face, pubic 
area, and genital area (penis and scrotum)), prostate, seminal vesicles, 
liver, and the brain.[1] In contrast, expression of 5α-reductase in skeletal 
muscle is undetectable.[1] Aromatase is highly expressed in adipose tissue 
and the brain, and is also expressed significantly in skeletal muscle.[1] 
Endogenous androgens like testosterone and DHT and synthetic anabolic-androgenic 
steroids are analogues and are very similar structurally, and due to this 
structural similarity, have the capacity to bind to and be metabolized 
by the same enzymes.[1] According to the intracellular metabolism explanation, 
the androgenic-to-anabolic ratio of a given AR agonist is based on its 
capacity to be transformed by the aforementioned enzymes in conjunction 
with the AR activity of any resulting products.[1] As an example, whereas 
the AR activity of testosterone is greatly potentiated by local conversion 
via 5α-reductase into DHT in tissues where 5α-reductase is expressed, an 
anabolic steroid that is not metabolized by 5α-reductase or has already 
been 5α-reduced, such as DHT itself or a derivative (like mesterolone or 
drostanolone), would not experience such potentiation in said tissues.[1] 
Moreover, nandrolone is metabolized by 5α-reductase, but unlike the case 
of testosterone and DHT, the 5α-reduced metabolite of nandrolone has much 
lower affinity for the AR than does nandrolone itself, and this results 
in reduced AR activation in 5α-reductase-expressing tissues.[1] As so-called 
"androgenic" tissues such as skin/hair follicles and reproductive tissues 
are very high in 5α-reductase expression, while skeletal muscle is virtually 
devoid of 5α-reductase, this may primarily explain the high myotrophic-androgenic 
ratio and dissociation seen with nandrolone, as well as with various other 
anabolic-androgenic steroids.[1] Aside from 5α-reductase, aromatase may 
inactivate testosterone signaling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, 
so anabolic-androgenic steroids that lack aromatase affinity, in addition 
to being free of the potential side effect of gynecomastia, might be expected 
to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio in comparison.[1] In addition, 
DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac 
tissue), and anabolic-androgenic steroids that lack affinity for 3α-HSD 
could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio 
(although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks).[1] The 
intracellular metabolism theory explains how and why remarkable dissociation 
between anabolic and androgenic effects can occur, but why dissociation 
is invariably incomplete.[1] In support of the model is the rare condition 
congenital 5α-reductase deficiency, in which the 5α-reductase enzyme is 
defective, production of DHT is impaired, and DHT levels are very low while 
testosterone levels are normal.[108][109] Males with this condition are 
born with ambiguous genitalia and an underdeveloped prostate gland.[108][109] 
In addition, saliently, such males develop normal musculature, voice changes/deepening, 
and libido at puberty, but have little to no acne or facial, pubic, or 
body hair, minimal enlargement of the prostate, and no incidence of male-pattern 
baldness or prostate cancer.[109][110][111][112][113] They also notably 
do not develop gynecomastia as a consequence of their condition.[111] Changes 
in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in 
myotrophic-androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic anabolic-androgenic 
steroids. Anabolic-androgenic steroids are antigonadotropic – that is, 
they dose-dependently suppress gonadal testosterone production and hence 
reduce systemic testosterone concentrations. By suppressing endogenous 
testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body 
with that of the exogenous anabolic-androgenic steroid, the myotrophic-androgenic 
ratio would be expected to be further increased, and this hence may be 
yet an additional mechanism contributing to the differences in myotrophic-androgenic 
ratio. In addition, some anabolic-androgenic steroids, such as nandrolone, 
are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor 
is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined 
progestogenic activity might further increase the myotrophic-androgenic 
ratio for a given anabolic-androgenic steroid. Some anabolic-androgenic 
steroids, such as testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, 
have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous 
neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone 
sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate.[1] It has been suggested that this may 
contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological 
and behavioral effects of anabolic-androgenic steroids.[1][114][115][116][117][118][119] 
AAS are steroids and are derivatives of testosterone with various structural 
modifications. The most commonly employed human physiological specimen 
for detecting anabolic steroid usage is urine, although both blood and 
hair have been investigated for this purpose. The anabolic steroids, whether 
of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation 
by a variety of enzymatic pathways. The primary urinary metabolites may 
be detectable for up to 30 days after the last use, depending on the specific 
agent, dose and route of administration. A number of the drugs have common 
metabolic pathways, and their excretion profiles may overlap those of the 
endogenous steroids, making interpretation of testing results a very significant 
challenge to the analytical chemist. Methods for detection of the substances 
or their excretion products in urine specimens usually involve gas chromatography–mass 
spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.[120][121][122][123] 
The use of gonadal steroids pre-dates their identification and isolation. 
Medical use of testicle extract began in the late 19th century while its 
effects on strength were still being studied.[102] The isolation of gonadal 
steroids can be traced back to 1931, when Adolf Butenandt, a chemist in 
Marburg, purified 15 milligrams of the male hormone androstenone from tens 
of thousands of litres of urine. This steroid was subsequently synthesized 
in 1934 by Leopold Ruzicka, a chemist in Zurich.[124] In the 1930s, it 
was already known that the testes contain a more powerful androgen than 
androstenone, and three groups of scientists, funded by competing pharmaceutical 
companies in the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, raced to isolate 
it.[124][125] This hormone was first identified by Karoly Gyula David, 
E. Dingemanse, J. Freud and Ernst Laqueur in a May 1935 paper "On Crystalline 
Male Hormone from Testicles (Testosterone)."[126] They named the hormone 
testosterone, from the stems of testicle and sterol, and the suffix of 
ketone. The chemical synthesis of testosterone was achieved in August that 
year, when Butenandt and G. Hanisch published a paper describing "A Method 
for Preparing Testosterone from Cholesterol."[127] Only a week later, the 
third group, Ruzicka and A. Wettstein, announced a patent application in 
a paper "On the Artificial Preparation of the Testicular Hormone Testosterone 
(Androsten-3-one-17-ol)."[128] Ruzicka and Butenandt were offered the 1939 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work, but the Nazi government forced 
Butenandt to decline the honor, although he accepted the prize after the 
end of World War II.[124][125] Clinical trials on humans, involving either 
oral doses of methyltestosterone or injections of testosterone propionate, 
began as early as 1937.[124] Testosterone propionate is mentioned in a 
letter to the editor of Strength and Health magazine in 1938; this is the 
earliest known reference to an anabolic steroid in a U.S. weightlifting 
or bodybuilding magazine.[124] There are often reported rumors that German 
soldiers were administered anabolic steroids during the Second World War, 
the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, 
as yet, unproven.[58]:6 Adolf Hitler himself, according to his physician, 
was injected with testosterone derivatives to treat various ailments.[129] 
AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp 
inmates,[129] and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished 
victims that survived Nazi camps.[58]:6 President John F. Kennedy was administered 
steroids both before and during his presidency.[130] The development of 
muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in 
the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where 
steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other 
amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, 
the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists 
to develop an anabolic steroid with reduced androgenic effects.[131] Ziegler's 
work resulted in the production of methandrostenolone, which Ciba Pharmaceuticals 
marketed as Dianabol. The new steroid was approved for use in the U.S. 
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1958. It was most commonly 
administered to burn victims and the elderly. The drug's off-label users 
were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. Although Ziegler prescribed 
only small doses to athletes, he soon discovered that those having abused 
Dianabol suffered from enlarged prostates and atrophied testes.[132] AAS 
were placed on the list of banned substances of the IOC in 1976, and a 
decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests 
because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during 
competition.[6] Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone 
into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at 17-alpha position with methyl or 
ethyl group created orally active compounds because it slows the degradation 
of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone 
at the 17-beta position allows the substance to be administered parenterally 
and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily 
liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations 
of the ring structure were applied for both oral and parenteral agents 
to seeking to obtain different anabolic to androgenic effect ratios.[6] 
The legal status of anabolic steroids varies from country to country: some 
have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though 
in many countries they are not illegal. In the U.S., anabolic steroids 
are currently listed as Schedule III controlled substances under the Controlled 
Substances Act, which makes simple possession of such substances without 
a prescription a federal crime punishable by up to one year in prison for 
the first offense. Unlawful distribution or possession with intent to distribute 
anabolic steroids as a first offense is punished by up to ten years in 
prison.[133] In Canada, anabolic steroids and their derivatives are part 
of the Controlled drugs and substances act and are Schedule IV substances, 
meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; 
however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule 
I, II, or III substances. Those guilty of buying or selling anabolic steroids 
in Canada can be imprisoned for up to 18 months.[134] Import and export 
also carry similar penalties. In Canada, researchers have concluded that 
steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. A study conducted 
in 1993 by the Canadian Centre for Drug-Free Sport found that nearly 83,000 
Canadians between the ages of 11 and 18 use steroids.[135] Anabolic steroids 
are also illegal without prescription in Australia,[136] Argentina, Brazil 
and Portugal,[137] and are listed as Class C Controlled Drugs in the United 
Kingdom. Anabolic steroids are readily available without a prescription 
in some countries such as Mexico and Thailand. The history of the U.S. 
legislation on anabolic steroids goes back to the late 1980s, when the 
U.S. Congress considered placing anabolic steroids under the Controlled 
Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at 
the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Anabolic steroids were added to Schedule 
III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act 
of 1990.[138] The same act also introduced more stringent controls with 
higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution 
of anabolic steroids and human growth hormone. By the early 1990s, after 
anabolic steroids were scheduled in the U.S., several pharmaceutical companies 
stopped manufacturing or marketing the products in the U.S., including 
Ciba, Searle, Syntex, and others. In the Controlled Substances Act, anabolic 
steroids are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and 
pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, 
and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by 
the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the 
list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005.[139] 
In the United Kingdom, anabolic steroids are classified as class C drugs 
for their illegal abuse potential, which puts them in the same class as 
benzodiazepines. Anabolic steroids are in Schedule 4, which is divided 
in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains 
the anabolic and androgenic steroids. Part 1 drugs are subject to full 
import and export controls with possession being an offence without an 
appropriate prescription. There is no restriction on the possession when 
it is part of a medicinal product. Part 2 drugs require a Home Office licence 
for importation and export unless the substance is in the form of a medicinal 
product and is for self-administration by a person.[140] Anabolic steroids 
are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, 
Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association[141] 
the Olympics,[142] the National Basketball Association,[143] the National 
Hockey League,[144] World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football 
League.[145] The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) maintains the list of 
performance-enhancing substances used by many major sports bodies and includes 
all anabolic agents, which includes all anabolic steroids and precursors 
as well as all hormones and related substances.[146][147] Spain has passed 
an anti-doping law creating a national anti-doping agency.[148] Italy passed 
a law in 2000 where penalties range up to three years in prison if an athlete 
has tested positive for banned substances.[149] In 2006, Russian President 
Vladimir Putin signed into law ratification of the International Convention 
Against Doping in Sport which would encourage cooperation with WADA. Many 
other countries have similar legislation prohibiting anabolic steroids 
in sports including Denmark,[150] France,[151] the Netherlands[152] and 
Sweden.[153] United States federal law enforcement officials have expressed 
concern about AAS use by police officers. "It's a big problem, and from 
the number of cases, it's something we shouldn't ignore. It's not that 
we set out to target cops, but when we're in the middle of an active investigation 
into steroids, there have been quite a few cases that have led back to 
police officers," says Lawrence Payne, a spokesman for the United States 
Drug Enforcement Administration.[154] The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin 
stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem 
that merits greater awareness by departments across the country".[155] 
It is also believed that police officers across the United Kingdom "are 
using criminals to buy steroids" which he claims to be a top risk factor 
for police corruption.[156] Following the murder-suicide of Chris Benoit 
in 2007, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigated steroid 
usage in the wrestling industry.[157] The Committee investigated WWE and 
Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), asking for documentation of their 
companies' drug policies. WWE CEO and Chairman, Linda and Vince McMahon 
respectively, both testified. The documents stated that 75 wrestlers—roughly 
40 percent—had tested positive for drug use since 2006, most commonly for 
steroids.[158][159] Anabolic steroids are frequently produced in pharmaceutical 
laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are 
also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from 
raw substances imported from abroad.[160] In these countries, the majority 
of steroids are obtained illegally through black market trade.[161][162] 
These steroids are usually manufactured in other countries, and therefore 
must be smuggled across international borders. As with most significant 
smuggling operations, organized crime is involved.[163] In the late 2000s, 
the worldwide trade in illicit AAS increased significantly, and authorities 
announced record captures on three continents. In 2006, Finnish authorities 
announced a record seizure of 11.8 million AAS tablets. A year later, the 
DEA seized 11.4 million units of AAS in the largest U.S seizure ever. In 
the first three months of 2008, Australian customs reported a record 300 
seizures of AAS shipments.[164] In the U.S., Canada, and Europe, illegal 
steroids are sometimes purchased just as any other illegal drug, through 
dealers who are able to obtain the drugs from a number of sources. Illegal 
anabolic steroids are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through 
the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, 
and physicians.[165] In addition, a significant number of counterfeit products 
are sold as anabolic steroids, in particular via mail order from websites 
posing as overseas pharmacies. In the U.S., black-market importation continues 
from Mexico, Thailand, and other countries where steroids are more easily
