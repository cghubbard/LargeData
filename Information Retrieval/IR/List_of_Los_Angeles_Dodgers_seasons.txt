The Los Angeles Dodgers are the second most successful franchise in the 
National League and the third-most successful and second-most wealthy in 
Major League Baseball after the New York Yankees.[1] The franchise was 
formerly based in Brooklyn and known originally as the "Grays" or "Trolley 
Dodgers" after the trams which supporters had to avoid to enter games.[2] 
Later it became known successively as the "Bridegrooms", "Superbas", "Dodgers" 
and "Robins"; the present "Dodgers" was firmly established in 1932. The 
franchise has won the World Series six times and lost a further twelve, 
and like the Yankees and Cardinals have never lost 100 games in a season 
since World War I, with their worst record since then being in 1992 with 
63 wins and their best records ever being in 1953 with 105 wins and 1942 
with 104. Their most successful period, between 1947 and 1966 with ten 
World Series appearances and only two seasons with 71 or more losses (one 
of them the year they moved to Los Angeles after a dispute over stadium 
funding[2]), was famous for the Dodgers becoming the first Major League 
Baseball team to incorporate African American players, led by Jackie Robinson 
and Roy Campanella.[2] The following table describes the Dodgers' MLB winâ€“loss
