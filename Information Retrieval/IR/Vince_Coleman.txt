Vincent Maurice Coleman (born September 22, 1961) is an American former 
Major League Baseball (MLB) player, best known for his years with the St. 
Louis Cardinals. Primarily a left fielder, Coleman played from 1985 to 
1997 and set a number of stolen base records. He was a switch-hitter and 
threw right-handed. He was a baserunning consultant for the Chicago White 
Sox during the 2015 season.[1] Coleman attended William M. Raines High 
School in Jacksonville, Florida and then Florida A&M University in Tallahassee. 
In 1981, he set the all-time single season stolen base record at Florida 
A&M with 65 steals in 69 attempts. He led NCAA Division I that year in 
both total steals and stolen base percentage. While at Florida A&M, Coleman 
was also a kicker and punter on the Florida A&M Rattlers football team, 
where he followed in the footsteps of his cousin, Greg Coleman, who was 
also a punter at Florida A&M in the 1970s and went on to a 12-year career 
in the National Football League. Coleman was named to the all-conference 
team in both 1980 and 1981 and kicked a game-winning 34-yard field goal 
in an unlikely 16–13 Rattlers win over the Division I-A Miami Hurricanes 
in 1979. Coleman chose to forgo an NFL career when he was drafted in the 
10th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Coleman stole 145 bases in a single season with Macon of the South Atlantic 
League in 1983; Coleman did so despite missing a month of the season with 
a broken hand. He further demonstrated his speed and basestealing ability 
with 101 steals for the Louisville Redbirds of the American Association 
before being called up to the majors. Coleman currently ranks sixth in 
all-time career stolen bases in the major leagues, with 752. He also ranks 
40th all-time in career stolen base percentage among all players with 80 
or more attempts, at 80.9%. Coleman stole 110 bases in his rookie season.[2] 
To date, the 110 steals are the third-highest in Major League history, 
after Rickey Henderson's 130 in 1982 and Lou Brock's 118 in 1974. Coleman 
stole over 100 bases in each of the following two seasons as well, making 
him the only player in the 20th century to post three consecutive seasons 
of 100 or more steals and the first player in Major League history to steal 
100 bases in the first three seasons of their career. By the end of only 
his second year, his 217 stolen bases were second in Cardinal history behind 
Lou Brock's 888, just ahead of the 203 by Jack Smith.[3] Before signing 
as a free agent with New York, Coleman led the National League in stolen 
bases in every season he played with the Cardinals (1985–1990), becoming 
one of just four players ever to lead his league in six consecutive seasons. 
The other players to accomplish this feat are Henderson, Luis Aparicio, 
and Maury Wills. Coleman, Henderson, Wills and Brock are the only players 
to steal 100 bases in a season. Only Coleman and Henderson have three different 
100-steal seasons to their credit, and only Coleman reached the total in 
three consecutive years. As the leadoff hitter for St. Louis, Coleman helped 
the team reach the 1985 playoffs. But he suffered an injury prior to the 
fourth game of the National League Championship Series, when the automatic 
tarpaulin at Busch Stadium rolled over his leg during routine stretching 
exercises. The injury sidelined him for the rest of the postseason, and 
the Cardinals eventually lost a seven-game World Series to Kansas City.[4] 
Following the season, Coleman became the fourth-ever unanimous selection 
for the NL Rookie of the Year Award. He offended many baseball fans, the 
press and many African Americans in 1985 when he declared "I don't know 
nothin' about him. Why are you asking me about Jackie Robinson?"[5] Responding 
to Coleman, Rachel Robinson, Jackie Robinson's widow said, "I hope somehow 
he'll learn and be embarrassed by his own ignorance." Coleman compiled 
the best season of his major league career in 1987, when he posted a .289 
batting average and a .363 on-base percentage while totaling 180 hits, 
109 stolen bases, and 121 runs scored. He stole second and third base in 
the same inning 13 times that year. Coleman played in the World Series 
that year, the only one he would appear in. In June, he recorded his 500th 
stolen base in just his 804th game, the fewest that any player has needed 
to reach that milestone.[citation needed] In 1989, Coleman compiled a streak 
of 50 successful stolen bases without being caught stealing, before it 
was broken on July 28 when he was thrown out by Montreal Expos catcher 
Nelson Santovenia in a game at Olympic Stadium.[6] The next night, July 
29, 1989, Coleman was called out twice for interference on the base paths 
– first by using his hands to hit a ball foul, and then tugging at the 
uniform of Expos second baseman Damaso Garcia to break up a double play. 
Coleman left for the Mets after the 1990 season via free agency, signing 
a four-year, $11.95 million contract. However, his career took a quick 
downward spiral. He missed 215 games (out of a possible 486) due to numerous 
injuries and suspensions. Coleman was one of three Met players named in 
a complaint filed by a 31-year-old woman in Florida, although prosecutors 
did not pursue charges in the case. His base-stealing strategy became increasingly 
suspect; he often ignored or misinterpreted his coaches' signs on the basepaths. 
He was also very difficult to get along with. He got into an argument with 
coach Mike Cubbage at the end of his first season with the Mets, which 
was a factor in manager Bud Harrelson's ouster. In September 1992, he got 
into a fight with Harrelson's successor, Jeff Torborg, and was suspended 
without pay for the rest of the season. The Mets seemingly had enough and 
tried to trade him, but there were no takers. In April 1993, Coleman injured 
Dwight Gooden's arm by recklessly swinging a golf club in the clubhouse. 
Three months later, Coleman was charged with endangerment when he threw 
a lit firecracker into a crowd of baseball fans waiting for autographs 
in the Dodger Stadium parking lot. The explosion injured three children, 
including a two-year-old, Amanda Santos. He was sentenced to 200 hours 
of community service for the incident. The Mets placed him on paid administrative 
leave — in effect, a suspension with pay. On August 26, the Mets announced 
that as part of a general housecleaning of the clubhouse, Coleman would 
not return in 1994. Manager Dallas Green said that while Coleman had played 
well (when he suited up), he didn't think Coleman had the "head and heart 
and belly" he wanted to see on the team.[7] At the end of the season, the 
Mets traded him, with cash, to the Kansas City Royals for Kevin McReynolds. 
He recorded 76 steals in 179 games as a Royal before being traded to the 
Seattle Mariners in mid-1995. 1996 found Coleman with the Cincinnati Reds, 
where he was ineffective. Released by the team in June, he signed with 
the California Angels but never played a game for the team. Coleman's final 
season in the major leagues came in 1997 with the Detroit Tigers, where 
he again received limited playing time and little success on the basepaths 
or elsewhere. Coleman attempted a comeback with the St. Louis Cardinals 
in 1998 and hit over .300 in spring training, but did not earn a spot on 
the opening day roster. He was assigned to the AAA Memphis Redbirds, where 
he continued to play well, stealing eight bases and hitting .316 with an 
on-base percentage of .395 in 20 games as the club's regular left fielder 
and leadoff man. However, after failing to receive a promotion to St. Louis, 
Coleman elected to retire in May 1998. The Chicago White Sox added Vince 
Coleman to their staff as a base-running instructor in 2015.[8][9] He stayed
