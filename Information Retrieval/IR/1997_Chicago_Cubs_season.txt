The 1997 Chicago Cubs season was the 126th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 122nd in the National League and the 82nd at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished fifth and last in the National League Central with a record of 
68â€“94. The team never had a record above .500 at any point during the season. 
The season is perhaps best remembered for the miserable way in which the 
team began the season, losing their first 14 games before finally winning 
the second game of a double-header against the New York Mets. The 0-14 
start brought the superstition of the "billy goat curse" to the forefront, 
and at one point a goat was actually led around Wrigley Field in an effort 
to end the curse Infielders Outfielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G
