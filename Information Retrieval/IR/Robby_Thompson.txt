Robert Randall Thompson (born May 10, 1962) is an American professional 
baseball coach and former college and professional baseball player.[1] 
He played his entire career in Major League Baseball (1986–1996) as the 
second baseman for the San Francisco Giants.[1] During the Giants' resurgence 
in the late 1980s, he was known as a team leader who played the game with 
a gritty determination.[2] Thompson most recently served as the bench coach 
for the Seattle Mariners.[3] He served as the team's interim manager for 
about a month in 2013 when Eric Wedge was recovering from a stroke. Thompson 
was born in West Palm Beach, Florida.[1] He attended Forest Hill Community 
High School in West Palm Beach, where he played high school baseball for 
the Forest Hill Falcons. Thompson received an athletic scholarship to attend 
the University of Florida in 1983 where he played for coach Jack Rhine's 
Florida Gators baseball team. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants 
in the first round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft, and decided 
to forgo his remaining NCAA eligibility.[4] In 1985 while playing for the 
Shreveport Captains in the Texas League, he posted a .261 batting average 
along with 9 home runs and was named to the league All-Star team.[5][6] 
Thompson made his major league debut with the Giants on April 8, 1986 at 
the age of 24.[1] In June he became the first player in major league history 
to be caught stealing four times in one game (three occurred during attempted 
hit and run plays).[7] Despite his rocky start, Thompson ended the season 
with a .271 batting average as the Giants leadoff hitter and provided steady 
defense.[1] He won the The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and finished 
second to Todd Worrell in the 1986 National League Rookie of the Year Award.[8][9] 
Thompson had to undergo surgery at the end of the season to have cartilage 
removed from his right knee.[10] Thompson continued to perform well defensively 
in 1987, teaming up with Giants shortstop José Uribe to form one of the 
best double play combinations in baseball, and helped the Giants lead the 
major leagues with 183 double plays.[11] The Giants clinched the National 
League Western Division title by six games over the Cincinnati Reds.[12] 
In the 1987 National League Championship Series, Thompson played in pain 
with a bulging disc but still played well defensively helping the Giants 
set a playoff record with 10 double plays.[10][11] He also hit 1 home run 
and had 2 runs batted in as the Giants were defeated by the St. Louis Cardinals 
in a seven-game series.[13] In 1988, Thompson was hitting above .300 at 
mid-season to earn a spot as a reserve on the 1988 National League All-Star 
team.[14][15] Unfortunately, he was once again plagued by an injury and 
had to miss the game due to a pinched nerve in his leg.[16] Brett Butler 
took over as the Giants leadoff hitter and Thompson, as the new number 
two hitter in the batting order, struggled to make contact, striking out 
111 times and ending the year with a .264 average.[1] In 1989 Thompson's 
batting average dropped to .241. However, he led the National League with 
11 triples and scored a career-high 91 runs while hitting ahead of Will 
Clark and Kevin Mitchell in the batting order.[1][17] The Giants once again 
won the Western Division crown and faced the Chicago Cubs in the 1989 National 
League Championship Series.[18] Thompson hit 2 home runs in the series 
including a game-winning two-run home run in Game 3 as the Giants went 
on to win the series in five games.[19][20] Thompson was held to only one 
hit in the 1989 World Series against the Oakland Athletics as the Giants 
were swept in four straight games.[21] Thompson's best year statistically 
was in 1993 when he was hitting for a .325 average at mid-season to earn 
his second All-Star selection; however, a leg injury would once again force 
him to miss the game.[22][23][24] The Giants had a nine-game lead on August 
11 but faltered in September and were caught by the Atlanta Braves, though 
by no fault of Thompson, who increased his offensive output late in the 
season including a period in August where he hit home runs in five consecutive 
games.[22][25] With 10 games left in the season on September 24, Thompson 
suffered a broken cheek bone when he was hit by a pitch thrown by Trevor 
Hoffman of the San Diego Padres. He missed 8 games due to the injury, but 
with the Giants and Braves tied for first place Thompson returned to play 
the final game of the season.[22] Despite his determination, playing with 
a bloodshot eye and wearing a clear plastic mask in the field, the Giants 
lost the National League West on the last day of the season.[25][26] Thompson 
ended the season with career highs in batting average (.312), doubles (30), 
home runs (19) and runs batted in (65).[1] Although Thompson was one of 
the best fielding second basemen in the National League, he was often overlooked 
in post-season awards because his playing career coincided with that of 
Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Ryne Sandberg.[27] By 1993, Sandberg 
was past his prime and Thompson finally received recognition when he won 
the Gold Glove Award for fielding excellence and the Silver Slugger Award, 
which is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position.[28][29] 
He was rewarded by the Giants in November when he signed a three-year contract 
for $12 million, making him the second-highest paid second baseman in baseball 
after Ryne Sandberg.[30] During spring training in 1994, Thompson received 
a scare when he was hit on the left ear flap of his batting helmet by pitcher 
Mike Harkey of the Colorado Rockies.[31] Thompson later stated the two 
beanings by Hoffman and Harkey were on his mind when he batted during games.[32][33] 
In May, he went onto the disabled list and missed almost two months of 
the season.[34] He returned in late June, but played in only seven games 
before undergoing surgery on his right shoulder and missed the rest of 
the season.[35] Thompson's injuries continued to hamper his playing time 
in 1995 and in September he had to undergo surgery again, this time on 
his left shoulder.[36] He returned to play in 1996 but injuries continued 
to take their toll as he appeared in only 63 games.[1][2] Thompson played 
his last major league game on September 22, 1996 at the age of 34.[1] Thompson 
was known for the well-used baseball glove with which he played for almost 
his entire career.[37] Thompson was offended when the San Francisco Chronicle 
printed a story titled, Thompson's Ugly, Pathetic Glove is a Gem.[37] His 
teammate, Rich Aurilia, who played at shortstop next to Thompson near the 
end of his career said, "I think by the time Robby was done, the glove 
mainly consisted of pine tar and chew spit. I don't even know how much 
leather was left in it. I know for a fact Robby still has that glove."[37] 
In an eleven-year major league career Thompson played in 1,304 games, accumulating 
1,187 hits in 4,612 at bats for a .257 career batting average along with 
119 home runs, 458 runs batted in and a .329 on-base percentage.[1] He 
led the National League in triples in 1989 with 11 and he finished his 
career with a .983 fielding percentage.[1] Thompson led National League 
second basemen in double plays for three consecutive seasons from 1990 
to 1992.[38] He hit for the cycle in a game on April 22, 1991.[39] A two-time 
All-Star, Thompson was the recipient of one Gold Glove Award and one Silver 
Slugger Award. He won the Willie Mac Award in 1991, honoring his spirit 
and leadership.[40] At the time of his retirement, Thompson was the all-time 
leader among Giants second basemen in games (1,304), at bats (4,612), runs 
(671), hits (1,187), doubles (238), triples (39), home runs (119), runs 
batted in (458), stolen bases (103), fielding percentage (.983) and double 
plays (873).[2][41] Thompson served as the Giants first base coach in 2000 
and 2001.[2] He was hired by the Cleveland Indians as a first base coach 
in December 2001.[42] In 2003 he was promoted to special assistant to the 
Cleveland Indians General Manager before returning to the field in June 
2005 as the Indians' bench coach.[43] In November 2010, Thompson was hired 
by the Seattle Mariners as their bench coach.[3] On July 22, 2013, Thompson 
began serving as interim manager while Eric Wedge recovered from a minor 
stroke. Thompson returned to his role as bench coach on August 23, 2013.[44]
