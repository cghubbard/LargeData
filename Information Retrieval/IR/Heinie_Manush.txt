Henry Emmett Manush (July 20, 1901 – May 12, 1971), nicknamed "Heinie", 
was an American baseball outfielder. He played professional baseball for 
20 years from 1920 to 1939, including 17 years in Major League Baseball 
for the Detroit Tigers (1923–1927), St. Louis Browns (1928–1930), Washington 
Senators (1930–1935), Boston Red Sox (1936), Brooklyn Dodgers (1937–1938), 
and Pittsburgh Pirates (1938–1939). After retiring as a player, Manush 
was a minor league manager from 1940 to 1945, a scout for the Boston Braves 
in the late 1940s and a coach for the Senators from 1953 to 1954. He was 
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964. A native of Tuscumbia, 
Alabama, Manush was one of the best batters in baseball in the 1920s and 
1930s. He compiled a .330 career batting average, won the American League 
batting championship in 1926 with a .378 batting average, finished one 
point short of a second batting championship in 1928, finished among the 
top four batters in the American League six times (1926, 1928–1929, and 
1932–1934) and totaled more than 200 hits four times (1928–1929, 1932–1933). 
In 1928, he finished second in the voting for the American League Most 
Valuable Player (MVP) award after leading the American League with 241 
hits and 47 doubles, while also hitting 20 triples and compiling 367 total 
bases. He also finished third in the MVP voting in 1932 and 1933 and was 
the leading batter on the 1933 Washington Senators team that won the American 
League pennant and lost the 1933 World Series to the New York Giants. Manush 
was also a solid defensive outfielder, appearing in 2,008 major league 
games, 1,381 as a left fielder, 312 as a center fielder, and 153 as a right 
fielder. He led the American League with 356 putouts as a left fielder 
in 1928, a .992 fielding percentage in left field in 1928, and five double 
plays turned by a left fielder in 1935. His 2,855 putouts in left field 
ranks 21st in major league history. Manush was born in 1901 at Tuscumbia, 
Alabama,[1] a city in the Florence–Muscle Shoals metropolitan area that 
is best known as the hometown of Helen Keller. His father, George Manush, 
immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1878 and worked as a cabinet 
maker and carpenter for a railroad company. His mother, Kate Manush, was 
born in Wisconsin, the daughter of German immigrants.[2][3] Manush was 
nicknamed "Heinie" due to his German ancestry. He was one of eight children 
in the family, seven boys and one girl.[4] All seven boys took up baseball, 
five of them playing the game professionally.[5] His brother Frank Manush 
was 18 years older than Heinie and played professional baseball from 1907 
to 1921.[6] Manush was seven years old when Frank made his major league 
debut in 1908 and later recalled: "When I was as young as 7 or 8, Frank 
used to bring home all his baseball equipment and uniform. I would look 
at that weird paraphernalia and wish I could wear it. From then on, baseball 
was all I ever had on my mind."[7] Manush started high school in Tuscumbia 
but transferred as a senior to Massey Military Academy, located 80 miles 
northeast of Tuscumbia in Cornersville, Tennessee.[4] In 1918, Manush moved 
to Iowa to join another brother in the plumbing business. He then moved 
to California in March 1919 and played semipro baseball with a club in 
Los Angeles.[7] Manush began his professional career in 1920, playing six 
games for the Portland Beavers in the Pacific Coast League.[8] Moving to 
the Edmonton Eskimos in the Western Canada League in 1921, Manush hit .321 
in 83 games.[8] In 1922, he played for the Omaha Buffaloes in the Western 
League, hitting 20 home runs and compiling a .376 batting average that 
was second in the league behind only Carl East.[9] After Manush's 1922 
performance in Omaha, he was purchased by the Detroit Tigers. In early 
February 1923, Manush returned a signed contract with the Tigers,[10] joining 
a star-studded Detroit outfield that included future Hall of Famers Harry 
Heilmann and Ty Cobb, as well as reliable sluggers Bobby Veach (.327 batting 
average in 1922), Bob Fothergill (.322 average in 1922), and Ira Flagstead 
(.308 average in 1922).[11] During his rookie season with the Tigers, Manush 
played well enough to appear in 109 games, 79 as a left fielder, sharing 
the position with Veach.[1] He compiled a .334 batting average, tenth highest 
in the American League. He also led the league with 17 times hit by pitch.[1] 
In 1924, Manush appeared in 120 games, 71 as the starting left fielder, 
and his batting average dropped 45 points to .289, though he again led 
the league with 16 times hit by pitch.[1] Ty Cobb later accepted responsibility 
for Manush's slump in 1924. Cobb believed that, by studying the "science" 
of hitting, every batter could improve. Accordingly, he took Manush aside 
for several days early in the 1924 season to work on improving Manush's 
technique and batting stance. After working with Cobb, Manush's batting 
average and self-confidence plummeted. Cobb eventually came to the conclusion 
that, like Babe Ruth, Manush was a "natural" hitter rather than a "scientific" 
one and that it was a mistake to try to change a natural hitter.[12] In 
1925, Manush moved to center field as a backup to Cobb. He appeared in 
99 games, including 45 as the team's starting center fielder and 12 as 
the starting left fielder, and compiled a .302 batting average.[1] In 1926, 
Manush took over from Ty Cobb as the Tigers' starting center fielder, a 
position held by Cobb for 20 years. Manush had the best season of his career, 
compiling a .378 batting average to win the American League batting title. 
He also ranked among the league's leaders with a .986 on-base plus slugging 
rating (second behind Babe Ruth) and a .564 slugging percentage (third 
behind Ruth and Al Simmons).[13] Manush trailed Babe Ruth for the batting 
championship going into the last day of the 1926 season. On the final day, 
September 26, the Tigers played a double header, and Manush overtook Ruth 
by garnering six hits in nine at bats.[14] By taking the batting crown, 
Manush also denied Ruth the Triple Crown. In a 1964 interview, Manush cited 
his beating Ruth on the last day of the 1926 season as one of two events 
in his career (the other was playing in the 1933 World Series) that most 
stood out for him.[15] Manush's improvement in 1926 was credited to the 
mentoring of teammate Harry Heilmann, who won American League batting crowns 
in 1921, 1923, 1925 and 1927. After Manush slumped in 1925, Heilmann, who 
had a talent for placing his hits, "took Manush in tow and taught him some 
tricks." After Heilmann's lessons, Manush developed a talent for dropping 
hits over second base between the left and center fielders.[16] In 1927, 
Manush continued as the Tigers' starting center fielder, appearing in 146 
games at the position, but his batting average dropped by 80 points from 
.378 to .298. He did still rank among the American League leaders, however, 
with 18 triples (second), 101 runs scored (seventh), 177 hits (tenth), 
55 extra base hits (tenth), and 262 total bases (tenth). He also rated 
among the league's leading center fielders with a .971 fielding percentage 
(second) and 356 putouts (third).[1] On December 13, 1927, the Tigers traded 
Manush and first baseman Lu Blue to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for 
outfielder Harry Rice, pitcher Elam Vangilder, and a player to be named 
later.[17][18] The trade was promptly criticized as being one-sided in 
favor of St. Louis,[18] and proved as much when Manush had an outstanding 
1928 season for the Browns. Manush appeared in all 154 games as the Browns' 
starting left fielder in 1928 and compiled a .378 batting average, narrowly 
missing a second batting title to Goose Goslin who hit .379, one point 
higher than Manush.[19] The battle for the batting title was the closest 
in 18 years, and Manush, who appeared in 19 more games than Goslin, led 
the league with 241 hits, 68 more than Goslin.[19][20] Manush also led 
the American League in 1928 with 241 hits and 47 doubles and finished among 
the league leaders with 367 total bases (second behind Babe Ruth), 20 triples 
(second), a 6.8 offensive wins above replacement rating (third behind Ruth 
and Lou Gehrig), 80 extra base hits (third behind Ruth and Gehrig), a .575 
slugging percentage (fourth), and 108 RBIs (fourth).[19] He helped the 
Browns improve by 23 wins from a 59-94 record in 1927 to an 82-72 record 
in 1928.[21][22] He also finished second behind Mickey Cochrane in close 
voting for the 1928 American League Most Valuable Player award, with Cochrane 
garnering 53 vote points to 51 for Manush.[23] Manush had another fine 
season in 1929, appearing in 145 games in left field for the Browns, while 
compiling the third highest batting average (.355) in the American League. 
He also finished in a three-way tie for the league lead with 45 doubles 
and ranked fifth in the league with 204 hits.[24] Manush was a holdout 
in 1930, refusing to report unless his salary was substantially increased.[25] 
He finally signed a contract and reported to the club on March 20, 1930.[26] 
Manush appeared in 48 games as the Browns' starting left fielder and compiled 
a .328 batting average.[1] On June 13, 1930, the Browns traded Manush with 
pitcher Alvin Crowder to the Washington Senators in exchange for left fielder 
Goose Goslin, with whom Manush had battled for the 1928 batting title.[27] 
It was reported at the time of the trade that the team owners were trying 
to rid themselves of players who held out, Manush and Goslin both having 
been holdouts at the start of the 1930 season.[28] In the second half of 
the 1930 season, Manush took over Goslin's spot as Washington's left fielder, 
starting 86 games at the position and batting .362. In 1931, Manush started 
146 games in left field and compiled a .307 batting average.[1] In 1932, 
Manush had one of the best seasons of his career. Continuing as the Senators' 
left fielder, he compiled a .342 batting average, fourth highest in the 
American League, and finished third in American League MVP voting behind 
Jimmie Foxx and Lou Gehrig.[29][30] He also ranked among the league's leaders 
with 214 hits (second), 121 runs scored (third), 324 total bases (fifth), 
14 triples (fifth), a .520 slugging percentage (sixth), and 116 RBIs (sixth).[29] 
Manush had another strong season in 1933. Appearing in 150 games in left 
field, he compiled the second highest batting average (.336) in the American 
League, trailing only Jimmie Foxx.[31] He led the American League with 
221 hits and 17 triples and ranked third in the league with 115 runs scored 
and 302 total bases.[31] He also had a 33-game hitting streak in 1933 and 
finished third in the American League MVP voting.[32] He helped lead the 
1933 Washington Senators to the American League pennant with a 99-53 record.[33] 
The Senators lost the 1933 World Series to the New York Giants, four games 
to one.[33] Manush had only two hits and two walks, though he also scored 
two runs, in 20 plate appearances during the 1933 World Series.[1] In Game 
4, Manush was ejected by umpire Charlie Moran after arguing Moran's calling 
Manush out on a close play at first base. The Senators lost the game in 
the 11th inning, and the ejection of Manush was bitterly denounced by the 
Senators after the loss. After the game, baseball commissioner Kenesaw 
Mountain Landis opined that Manush should not have been ejected and ruled 
that Manush would be permitted to play the next day.[34] The first and 
last player ever thrown out of a World Series game, Manush confessed 31 
years later to his actual conduct on that day. He recalled beating out 
the throw at first, which would have been a turning point in the game with 
Goose Goslin already on second base. Manush was so angry at the call that 
he had pulled on Moran's rubber bow tie: "I didn't lay a hand on Moran, 
but I did grab that bow tie and pulled it two feet away from his neck and 
then I let it snap right back into his gullet. . . . Even before he could 
recover his breath his thumb went up and I was out."[35] In 1934, Manush 
appeared in 137 games, 129 as the starting left fielder. He began the season 
on a torrid pace, batting .411 with 111 hits, 24 doubles and 10 triples 
by June 25.[36] With his fast start, Manush set a major league record, 
which still stands, for the fastest player to reach 100 hits, accomplishing 
the feat in his 60th game of the season.[37][38] He was selected to play 
in the 1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 10, the second 
ever All-Star Game. In the first inning, Manush was walked by Carl Hubbell 
and executed a double steal with Charlie Gehringer.[39] Manush slumped 
in the second half of the 1934 season, recording only 83 hits after June 
25, but he still ranked among the league leaders for the 1934 season with 
a .349 batting average (third), 11 triples (second), 292 putouts in left 
field (second), a .980 fielding percentage in left field (second), and 
a 2.28 range factor per game in left field (second).[1] The slump that 
struck Manush in the last half of the 1934 season continued through the 
1935 season. His batting average plummeted to .273, 76 points lower than 
his 1934 average, and he started only 109 games, fewer than in any season 
since 1925.[1] Despite limited playing time, he led the American League's 
left fielders with five double plays turned in 1935.[1] On December 17, 
1935, the Senators traded Manush to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for 
Roy Johnson and Carl Reynolds. At the time of the trade, some expressed 
hope that a change of scenery, and a reunion with manager Joe Cronin who 
had managed the Senators during Manush's best seasons, would help Manush 
return to his old form.[40] Instead, the slump followed Manush to Boston, 
as he appeared in only 82 games, 72 as a starter, and compiled a .291 batting 
average.[1] He was given an outright release by the Red Sox on September 
27, 1936.[41] On December 9, 1936, Manush signed as a free agent with the 
Brooklyn Dodgers. The Dodgers had been seeking a young outfielder, and 
The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reacted with surprise to the signing of Manush, 
its headline reading, "Dodgers Search for Youth Unearths Manush, Aged 36".[42] 
In spring training with the Dodgers, Manush broke out of his batting slump, 
leading the Florida circuit with a .571 average by late March.[43] He became 
the Dodgers' starting right fielder in 1937, and in his first season facing 
National League pitching, Manush compiled a .333 batting average, ninth 
highest in the league.[1] Manush began the 1938 season with the Dodgers, 
but his batting slump returned as his average fell to .238 in 17 games.[1] 
He was released by the Dodgers on May 15, 1938.[44] A week after being 
released by the Dodgers, Manush signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs of 
the International League.[45] He appeared in 81 games for Toronto and compiled 
a .310 batting average in 277 at bats.[8] On August 30, 1938, the Pittsburgh 
Pirates purchased Manush from Toronto as an "insurance outfielder and pinch 
hitter" for the last month of the pennant drive with the Chicago Cubs.[46][47] 
Manush appeared as a pinch hitter in 15 games for the 1938 Pirates, batting 
.308 in 13 at bats.[1] Manush returned to the Pirates in 1939, but played 
sparingly with no hits in 12 at bats. He appeared in his final major league 
game on May 22, 1939, at age 37,[1] and was released by the Pirates on 
June 7, 1939.[48] On June 12, 1939, Manush signed with the Toronto Maple 
Leafs, with whom he played for most of the 1938 season.[49] He appeared 
in 66 games for Toronto and compiled a batting average of only .241.[8] 
Manush spent the next five years as a player-manager in the Piedmont League 
for the Rocky Mount Red Sox in 1940,[50] the Greensboro Red Sox in 1941 
and 1942,[8] the Roanoke Red Sox in 1943.[51] In 1944, he served as manager 
of the Scranton Miners in the Eastern League, and in 1945 he became manager 
of the Martinsville A's in the Carolina League.[8][52] Manush scouted for 
the Boston Braves until 1948, then served as a coach for the Senators during 
the 1953 and 1954 seasons.[53][54] In October 1954, after Chuck Dressen 
was hired as the Senators' new manager, Manush was dismissed by the Senators.[55] 
In 17 seasons as a player in the major leagues, Manush appeared in 2,008 
games, 1,381 as a left fielder, 312 as a center fielder, and 153 as a right 
fielder, and compiled a .330 batting average with 2,524 hits and 1,183 
RBIs.[1] His notable career accomplishments include the following: In February 
1964, Manush was elected by the Veterans Committee to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame.[62] On learning the news, Manush, at his home in Sarasota, Florida, 
told reporters, "It's quite a shock to me to be picked . . . I feel wonderful 
. . . I had no idea this would ever happen to me."[15] The 1942 motion 
picture Obliging Young Lady opens with a comedic sequence in which Edmond 
O'Brien keeps repeating "Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush" in cadence with 
the sound of the train on which he is riding. At one point, a porter interrupts, 
"Who is Heinie Manush?", and O'Brien replies, "The great baseball player." 
In the dining car, O'Brien continues even as he orders, "Filet mignon that's 
for me, filet mignon that's for me, Heinie Manush, Heinie Manush, Heinie 
Manush, Heinie Manush, filet mignon, medium rare, Heinie Manush, Heinie 
Manush." The repetitive, onomatopoeic nature of the phrase fit the sound 
of the train so well that other riders began to pick it up, driving the 
conductor to distraction.[63][64] Manush was inducted into the Michigan 
Sports Hall of Fame in 1964,[65] and later posthumously into the Alabama 
Sports Hall of Fame in 1972.[66] Manush was married, and he and his wife 
Betty had two daughters, Lillis and Sue. They lived in Sarasota, Florida, 
beginning in 1935. His wife died in June 1949 at age 46 after undergoing 
an operation at Harper Hospital in Detroit.[67] Manush picked up the game 
of golf in 1935 and he won multiple city golf championships in Sarasota.[4] 
Manush fought an extended battle against throat cancer, was placed in a 
Sarasota nursing home on March 11, 1971, and died there on May 12, 1971.[68][69]
