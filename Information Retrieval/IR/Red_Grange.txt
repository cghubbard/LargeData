Harold Edward "Red" Grange, nicknamed "The Galloping Ghost" (June 13, 1903 
– January 28, 1991) was a college and professional American football halfback 
for the University of Illinois, the Chicago Bears, and for the short-lived 
New York Yankees. His signing with the Bears helped legitimize the National 
Football League.[2] He was a charter member of both the College and Pro 
Football Halls of Fame. In college, Grange was a three-time consensus All-American, 
leading his team to a national championship in 1923. He was the only consensus 
All-American running back in 1924 who was not a member of the Four Horsemen. 
The same year, Grange became the first recipient of the Chicago Tribune 
Silver Football award denoting the Big Ten's most valuable player.[3] In 
2008, he was named the best college football player of all time by ESPN, 
and in 2011, he was named the Greatest Big Ten Icon by the Big Ten Network. 
"Red" Grange was born on June 13, 1903, in Forksville, Pennsylvania, a 
village of about 200 people in an area of lumber camps.[4] His father was 
the foreman of three lumber camps.[4] His mother died when he was just 
five years old.[5] For a number of years, the Grange family lived with 
relatives until they could finally afford a home of their own in Wheaton, 
Illinois. When they arrived in Wheaton, Grange’s father worked hard and 
became the chief of police.[6] At Wheaton High School,[note 1] Grange earned 
16 varsity letters in four sports (football, baseball, basketball, and 
track)[6] during the four years he attended, notably scoring 75 touchdowns 
and 532 points for the football team.[6] As a high school junior, Grange 
scored 36 touchdowns and led Wheaton High School to an undefeated season. 
In his senior year, his team won every game but one in which they lost 
39–0 to Scott High School in Toledo, Ohio.[4] Knocked out in this game, 
Grange remained unconscious for two days, having difficulty speaking when 
he awoke.[4] In addition to his success in football, Grange was an all-state 
track and field runner. In 1920, Grange was a state champion in the high 
jump, while placing third and fourth in the 100-yard dash and the 220-yard 
dash, respectively. In 1921, he won the state title in both the long jump 
and the 100-yard dash, and finally in 1922, he placed third in the 100-yard 
dash and won the 220-yard dash.[7] To help the family earn money, he took 
a part-time job as an ice toter for $37.50 per week,[6] a job which helped 
him to build his core strength (and provided the source of one of his nicknames: 
"Ice Man", or "the Wheaton Ice Man").[8] After graduation, Grange enrolled 
at the University of Illinois, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity.[6] 
He had initially planned to compete in only basketball and track, but changed 
his mind once he arrived and joined coach Bob Zuppke's Fighting Illini 
football team. Grange played for the team from 1923 to 1925. In his first 
collegiate football game, he scored three touchdowns against Nebraska.[6] 
He once scored four touchdowns in twelve minutes.[9] In seven games as 
a sophomore, he ran for 723 yards and scored 12 touchdowns, leading Illinois 
to an undefeated season and the Helms Athletic Foundation national championship.[10] 
Grange vaulted to national prominence as a result of his performance in 
the October 18, 1924 game against Michigan, in the grand opening game of 
the new Memorial Stadium, built as a memorial to Illini students and alumni 
who had served in World War I.[6] The Michigan Wolverines entered the game 
as favorites, having also won a national title in 1923, and were going 
for another this year. Grange returned the opening kickoff for a 95-yard 
touchdown and scored three more touchdowns on runs of 67, 56, and 44 yards 
in the first 12 minutes–the last three in less than seven minutes.[10] 
On his next carry, he ran 56 yards for yet another touchdown. Before the 
game was over, Grange ran back another kickoff for yet another touchdown. 
He scored six touchdowns in all. Illinois won the game by a lopsided score 
of 39 to 14. Michigan coach Fielding Yost said "All Grange can do is run." 
To which the Illinois coach, Bob Zuppke, referring to a famed opera star 
of the age, responded, "And all Galli-Curci can do is sing."[11] The game 
inspired Grantland Rice to write this poetic description: A streak of fire, 
a breath of flame Eluding all who reach and clutch; A gray ghost thrown 
into the game That rival hands may never touch; A rubber bounding, blasting 
soul Whose destination is the goal — Red Grange of Illinois![12] However, 
Chicago sportswriter Warren Brown nicknamed Grange "The Galloping Ghost". 
When questioned in a 1974 interview, "Was it Grantland Rice who dubbed 
you the Galloping Ghost?", Grange replied, "No, it was Warren Brown, who 
was a great writer with the Chicago's American in those days."[6] As a 
college senior in 1925, in a 24–2 upset of the University of Pennsylvania, 
Grange rushed for a career-high 237 yards through deep mud and scored three 
touchdowns. Laurence Stallings, a famed war correspondent who had co-written 
What Price Glory? was hired to cover the game for the New York World. After 
Grange accounted for 363 yards, Stallings said, "This story's too big for 
me. I can't write it."[10] Grange's younger brother Garland followed his 
footsteps to also play football at Illinois.[13] In his 20-game college 
career, Red Grange ran for 3,362 yards, caught 14 passes for 253 yards, 
and completed 40-of-82 passes for 575 yards. Of his 31 touchdowns, 16 were 
from at least 20 yards, with nine from more than 50 yards.[10] He scored 
at least one touchdown in every game he played but one, a loss to Nebraska 
in his senior season. He earned All-America recognition three consecutive 
years, and appeared on the October 5, 1925, cover of Time.[10] His number 
77 was retired at the University of Illinois.[note 2] In 2002, the NCAA 
published "NCAA Football's Finest," researched and compiled by the NCAA 
Statistics Service.[15] For Grange they published the following statistics: 
Grange was immediately courted by teams in the National Football League. 
The long-suffering Rochester Jeffersons made a last-ditch effort to sign 
Grange at a salary of $5,000 per game, but were unable to do so, a key 
factor in the team's demise.[16] The Chicago Bears ultimately signed him; 
player/manager George Halas agreed to a contract for a 19-game barnstorming 
tour, signed the day after Grange played his last college game. The contract 
earned Grange a salary and share of gate receipts that amounted to $100,000, 
during an era when typical league salaries were less than $100/game.[10] 
That 67-day tour is credited with legitimizing professional football and 
the NFL in the United States. On December 6, 1925, between 65,000 and 73,000 
people showed up at the Polo Grounds to watch Grange, helping save the 
New York Giants' franchise.[10][17] Grange scored a touchdown on a 35-yard 
interception return in the Bears' 19–7 victory. Offensively, he ran for 
53 yards on 11 carries, caught a 23-yard pass, and completed two of three 
passes for 32 yards.[10] In his first year, he accounted for at least 401 
total yards and three touchdowns in his five official NFL games for the 
Bears. Grange became involved in a dispute with the Bears and left to form 
his own league, the American Football League, to challenge the NFL.[18] 
The league only lasted one season, after which Grange's team, the New York 
Yankees, was assimilated into the NFL. In 1927, Grange suffered a serious 
knee injury against the Bears, which robbed him of some speed and his cutting 
ability. After sitting out 1928, Grange returned to the Bears, where he 
remained as a solid player through 1934.[19] The two highlights of Grange's 
later NFL years came in consecutive championship games. In the unofficial 
1932 championship, Grange caught the game-winning touchdown pass from Bronko 
Nagurski. It was argued the pass was illegal.[20] In the 1933 championship, 
Grange made a touchdown-saving tackle that saved the game and the title 
for the Bears.[21] He was a very modest person,[22] who insisted that even 
the ordinary plumber or electrician knows more about his craft than he 
does. He said he could not explain how he did what he did on the field 
of play, and that he just followed his instincts.[23] Grange's manager, 
C. C. Pyle, realized that as the greatest football star of his era, Grange 
could attract moviegoers, as well as sports fans.[24] During his time as 
a professional football player, Grange starred in two silent films, One 
Minute to Play (1926) and Racing Romeo (1927). Grange also starred in a 
12-part serial series The Galloping Ghost in 1931. Grange retired from 
professional football in 1934, earning a living in a variety of jobs including 
motivational speaker and sports announcer. In the 1950s, he announced Chicago 
Bears games for CBS television and college football (including the Sugar 
Bowl) for NBC. Grange married his wife Margaret, nicknamed Muggs, in 1941, 
and they were together until his death in 1991. She was a flight attendant, 
and they met on a plane. The couple had no children. He, however, has one 
surviving daughter – Rosemary Morrissey – born in 1928 from a previous 
relationship with Helen Flozack.[10] Grange's autobiography, first published 
in 1953, is The Red Grange Story. The book was written "as told to" Ira 
Morton, a syndicated newspaper columnist from Chicago.[25] Grange developed 
Parkinson's disease in his last year of life[10] and died on January 28, 
1991, in Lake Wales, Florida. To commemorate college football's 100th anniversary 
in 1969, the Football Writers Association of America chose an all-time 
All-America team. Grange was the only unanimous choice.[10] Then in 1999, 
he was ranked number 80 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Football 
Players. In 2008, Grange was also ranked #1 on ESPN's Top 25 Players In 
College Football History list. In honor of his achievements at the University 
of Illinois, the school erected a 12-ft statue of Grange at the start of 
the 2009 football season. In 2011, Grange was announced as number one on 
the "Big Ten Icons" series presented by the Big Ten Network. In 1931, Grange 
visited Abington Senior High School in Abington, Pennsylvania, a suburb 
of Philadelphia. Shortly thereafter, the school adopted his nickname for 
the mascot in his honor, the Galloping Ghost.[26] Also, Wheaton Warrenville 
South High School's football field is named in his honor and the team is 
referred to as the Wheaton Warrenville South Red Grange Tigers. Annually, 
the Wheaton Warrenville South Boys Track and Field team hosts the Red Grange 
Invitational in honor of Grange's achievements in track and field. On January 
15, 1978, at Super Bowl XII, Grange became the first person other than
