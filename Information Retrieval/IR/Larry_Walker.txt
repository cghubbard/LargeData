Larry Kenneth Robert Walker (born December 1, 1966) is a Canadian former 
right fielder in Major League Baseball. From 1989 through 2005, Walker 
played for the Montreal Expos (1989–1994), Colorado Rockies (1995–2004), 
and St. Louis Cardinals (2004–2005). He announced his retirement after 
Game 6 of the 2005 National League Championship Series. Born in 1966 to 
parents of Scottish descent, Walker grew up playing ice hockey and dreamed 
of a career in the NHL as a goaltender, only playing baseball for fun during 
the summer. At the age of 16, he was offered tryouts with Junior A teams 
in Regina, SK and Kelowna, BC, but after getting cut from both teams, Walker 
decided to focus his athletic aspirations on baseball. Walker was selected 
to join the Canadian team at the 1984 World Youth Championships in Saskatchewan. 
At that tournament, he caught the eye of Montreal Expos scouting director 
Jim Fanning, who signed Walker for $1500, despite Walker's relative lack 
of experience playing organized baseball.[1] Although he could hit fastballs 
well, Walker was unprepared for the more sophisticated pitches he encountered 
during his first season as a professional with the Utica Blue Sox and struggled 
at the plate, finishing with a .223 average and only 2 home runs. Walker 
feared he would be released, but Expos hitting coach Ralph Rowe successfully 
argued that Walker should be sent to the Florida Instructional League. 
With further tutelage, Walker soon developed into one of the Expos' best 
young prospects, overcoming a serious knee injury along the way.[2] Walker 
made his debut with the Montreal Expos on August 16, 1989. He walked twice 
and recorded a single in his first official at bat.[3] During his first 
several seasons, he was an above average hitter in all respects, hitting 
for some power, stealing 20–30 bases, and regularly batting near the .300 
mark, becoming a role model for thousands of young Canadian baseball players. 
He became the first and only Canadian to win the Expos Player of The Year, 
doing so in 1992. In 1994, Walker was well on his way to his first 100-RBI 
year, with 86 RBI. However, that season was interrupted due to the 1994 
players' strike. Before the 1995 season, Walker signed with the Colorado 
Rockies. In 1995, Walker was a major factor in helping Colorado reach the 
playoffs for the first time, hitting .306 with 36 home runs and 101 RBI.[4] 
He remains in the top ten in many offensive categories for the Rockies.[5] 
Walker's career season came in 1997, when he hit .366 with 49 home runs, 
130 RBI, 33 stolen bases, and 409 total bases, en route to becoming the 
first Canadian player to win the MVP Award. He became and remains the only 
player to have at least 25 stolen bases and a slugging percentage of more 
than .700 in a season. Walker's 409 total bases in 1997 were the most in 
an NL season since Stan Musial's 1948 season, although the mark was bettered 
by Sammy Sosa in 1998 (416). In 1998, Walker won the Lou Marsh Trophy as 
Canadian athlete of the year after finishing runner-up the previous year 
to Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve. He won the Tip O'Neill Award 
as Canada's top baseball player 9 times in his career. Only Walker and 
Joey Votto have won it more than 3 times in their career. Combined with 
12 outfield assists, the season remains one of the finest all-around performances 
in recent baseball history. Even more impressively, Walker's breakout season 
came just one year after various injuries limited him to 83 games and 272 
at-bats, although the NL Comeback Player of the Year award went to Darren 
Daulton. Walker was plagued by injuries for the last several years of his 
career, nevertheless continuing to produce. Although he would never have 
500 at-bats in a season after 1997, he hit .363 in 1998 in limited action, 
and .379 (a Rockies record) with 37 homers and 115 RBI in just 438 at-bats 
the following year. After spending most of the 2000 season on the disabled 
list (albeit hitting .309 in limited action), Walker returned to form, 
hitting .350 and .338 the next two seasons, with more than 100 RBI both 
years. In July 2004, the Texas Rangers agreed to send the Rockies then-minor-leaguer 
Ian Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson in exchange for Walker, 
but Walker vetoed the trade.[6] In August 2004, Walker, who was batting 
.324 despite being injured, desired a trade to a contender. He went to 
the St. Louis Cardinals for three minor league players. Now playing for 
the Cardinal powerhouse, Walker contributed briefly to the pennant-winning 
2004 squad and the 2005 division winners. The Houston Astros defeated the 
Cardinals in the 2005 NLCS in the last game ever played at Busch Stadium. 
Walker retired shortly afterwards. He ended his career 50th on the all-time 
home run list with 383. As of 2008, Walker is an instructor on the St. 
Louis Cardinals' spring training staff under manager Tony La Russa and 
does fill-in training with the Cardinals staff. He was offered a full-time 
position but chose to remain in his part-time position.[7] In 2009, Walker 
served as Team Canada's hitting instructor at the 2009 World Baseball Classic 
and was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2011, he also 
served as Hitting Coach/First Base Coach for Canada's Gold Medal winning 
team at the Pan Am Games in Guadalajara, Mexico. He became eligible for 
induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2011. During his first 
year of eligibility, he received 118 votes, or 20.3 percent of all ballots 
cast; the threshold for entry is 75 percent.[8] A major negative for voters 
in considering Walker for the Hall Of Fame is the inflation of his hitting 
numbers playing at Coors Field.[9] Walker and his wife Angela have two 
daughters – Canaan Rose-Lynn (born 1999) and Shayna Kaitlin (born 2001) 
– and he has another daughter, Brittany Marie (born July 1993), from a 
previous relationship.[11] Walker enjoys playing and watching soccer. His 
theme song is "Crazy Train" by Ozzy Osbourne. Walker is superstitious about 
the number three. He wore number 33 and was married on Nov. 3 at 3:33. 
He would take three, or any multiple of three, swings in the batter's box
