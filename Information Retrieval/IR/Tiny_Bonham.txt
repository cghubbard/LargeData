Ernest Edward (Tiny) Bonham (August 16, 1913 – September 15, 1949) was 
a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. From 1940 to 1949, he played 
for the New York Yankees (1940–46) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1947–49). Bonham, 
who batted and threw right-handed, won 21 games for the Yankees in 1942. 
He was born in Ione, California. In a 10-season career, Bonham posted a 
103-72 record with 478 strikeouts and a 3.06 ERA in 1551.0 innings pitched. 
Bonham kept opposing batters off balance with an assortment of deliveries. 
He started his professional baseball career with the Oakland Oaks of the 
Pacific Coast League in 1935. He worked his way up through the New York 
Yankees minor league system until 1940, when he was summoned from Triple-A 
Kansas City to anchor a weak Yankees pitching staff. Remaining with the 
Yankees until 1946, Bonham was a pitching mainstay of manager Joe McCarthy's 
pennant-winning combinations between 1941 and 1943. Bonham supplied his 
team with the decisive complete game 4-hit 3–1 victory over the Brooklyn 
Dodgers in Game Five of the 1941 World Series played at Ebbets Field. But 
Bonham was ill-fated in his other Series starts, losing to the St. Louis 
Cardinals in 1942 and 1943, both times by 4–3 scores. His most productive 
season came in 1942, when he led the American League with 21 wins, six 
shutouts, 22 complete games and a .808 winning percentage. He made the 
All-Star team that season and again in 1943. Hampered by a chronic back 
ailment during his last few years with the Yankees, which were interrupted 
by a brief time in the Army in 1944, Bonham was sent to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates before the 1947 season. Although his physical condition was such 
that he could not be counted on regularly, Bonham provided three solid 
seasons for the Pirates. After an 1-4 start in 1949, Bonham won six straight 
games for a floundering Pittsburgh club, including an 8–2 victory over 
the Philadelphia Phillies on August 28, his final game. Eighteen days later 
Bonham died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the age of 36, following an
