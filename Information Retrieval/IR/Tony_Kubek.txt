Anthony Christopher "Tony" Kubek (born October 12, 1935[1]) is an American 
former professional baseball player and television broadcaster. During 
his nine-year playing career with the New York Yankees, Kubek played in 
six World Series in the late 1950s and early 1960s, starting in 37 World 
Series games. For NBC television, he later broadcast twelve World Series 
between 1968 and 1982, and fourteen League Championship Series between 
1969 and 1989. Kubek received the Ford C. Frick Award in 2009. A left-handed 
batter, Kubek signed his first professional contract with the Yankees and 
rose rapidly through the team's farm system. He was 21 years old when he 
played his first game in Major League Baseball in 1957, and—except for 
one year (1962) spent largely in the U.S. military—remained with the Yankees 
until his retirement due to a back injury at the close of the 1965 season. 
In his prime he formed a top double play combination with second baseman 
(and roommate) Bobby Richardson on an infield that also featured third 
baseman Clete Boyer. Kubek played 1,092 games, 882 of them at shortstop 
(although he also was an outfielder and utility infielder in his early 
career), compiling a lifetime batting average of .266 with 57 home runs. 
The 38 doubles he totaled in 1961 remained the Yankee club record for shortstops 
until 2004, and his career fielding percentage and range factor were both 
above league average. During his nine years with the Yankees, he played 
on seven American League pennant winners (1957–58, 1960–64) and three world 
champions (1958, 1961–1962). In a 1976 Esquire magazine article, sportswriter 
Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting 
of five ethnic baseball teams. Kubek was the shortstop on Stein's Polish 
team. In 1982, Kubek was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports 
Hall of Fame.[2] In 1986, Kubek was on hand for the only Old-Timers' Day 
at Yankee Stadium that he would take part in. That year, the event was 
a reunion of the 1961 Yankees and marked the recent passing of Roger Maris. 
He was signed by Yankees scout Lou Maguolo.[3] In 1957, Kubek won the American 
League Rookie of the Year Award. In Game 3 of the 1957 World Series, he 
had one of the best World Series games a rookie has ever had, going 3 for 
5 with two home runs, three runs scored, and four RBI. Kubek is one of 
five rookies to hit two home runs in a World Series game. Another Yankee, 
Charlie Keller, had performed the feat in the 1939 World Series against 
the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinal Willie McGee homered twice in 
the 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. All three of these 
feats occurred in a Game 3; Kubek's and McGee's both occurred at Milwaukee 
County Stadium. The Atlanta Braves' Andruw Jones homered twice in Game 
1 of the 1996 World Series at Yankee Stadium. Michael Conforto of the New 
York Mets became the fifth member of this club when he hit two in Game 
4 of the 2015 World Series on October 31, 2015. In Game 7 of the 1960 World 
Series, Kubek was injured by a bad-hop ground ball that struck him in the 
throat; Kubek was badly hurt and the batter, Bill Virdon, reached first 
base, enabling the Pittsburgh Pirates to rally in a game they eventually 
won 10–9 on a ninth-inning homer by Bill Mazeroski. Kubek was sensitive 
about the Bill Virdon incident. When future broadcasting partner Bob Costas 
once referenced Virdon's smash on the air, Kubek put his hand on Costas' 
thigh to stop him.[4] Just before the 1963 World Series, TV personality 
Phil Silvers, a Dodger fan, provided a reporter with a list of Yankee players 
to rattle. He included Kubek: "Show him a pebble."[4] Upon his retirement, 
Kubek became a color analyst on NBC's Saturday Game of the Week telecasts, 
teaming with play-by-play announcer Jim Simpson on the network's backup 
games from 1966–68 and then joining Curt Gowdy to form the primary crew 
in 1969. Kubek initially had trouble adjusting to the world of broadcasting. 
Although he had a lot to say, he rambled, he tended to stutter, and talked 
too fast.[citation needed] Gowdy soon suggested to Kubek that he should 
work offseason to improve his delivery. Buying a recorder, Kubek often 
read poetry aloud for 20 minutes a day. Kubek eventually became a respected 
broadcaster, doing both play-by-play and commentary. He spent 24 years 
at NBC, teaming with such announcers as Simpson, Gowdy (whom Kubek later 
called his favorite partner), Joe Garagiola, and Bob Costas. Kubek could 
be considered baseball's first network baseball analyst as contrasted with 
a color commentator, similar to Tim McCarver and Jim Kaat later. In addition 
to the weekly in-season games, Kubek worked over a dozen World Series (1969–1976, 
1978, 1980 and 1982) for NBC, as well as numerous American League Championship 
Series (1969–1975, 1977, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987 and 1989) and All-Star 
Games (1969–1975, 1977, 1979 and 1981). He also worked local telecasts 
for the Toronto Blue Jays on The Sports Network and CTV from 1977 to 1989. 
The Toronto Star said that Kubek "educated a whole generation of Canadian 
baseball fans without being condescending or simplistic." During the winter, 
Kubek would go hunting, coach junior high basketball, and wait for baseball 
to resume. As both a local and national sportscaster, Kubek was known for 
his outspokenness. While calling the 1972 American League Championship 
Series, Kubek said that Oakland's Bert Campaneris throwing his bat at Detroit's 
Lerrin LaGrow (who had just knocked Campaneris down with a low, inside 
pitch) was justified, on the grounds that any pitch aimed squarely at a 
batter's legs could endanger his career. Angered by Kubek's comments, executives 
from Detroit's Chrysler Corporation, which sponsored NBC's telecasts, phoned 
then-Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn, who, in turn, called the network 
about the matter.[5] On April 8, 1974, when Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 
715th career home run, Kubek, who was calling the game with Curt Gowdy 
and Joe Garagiola, criticized Bowie Kuhn on air for failing to be in attendance 
at Atlanta on that historic night. Kuhn argued that he had a prior engagement 
that he could not break. In the 10th inning of Game 3 of the 1975 World 
Series, Cincinnati's César Gerónimo reached first base. Then, Boston catcher 
Carlton Fisk threw Ed Armbrister's bunt into center field. Kubek, on the 
NBC telecast, immediately charged that Armbrister interfered (with the 
attempted forceout), though home plate umpire Larry Barnett did not agree. 
After Joe Morgan drove in the game-winning run for the Reds in a 6–5 victory, 
Barnett blamed Kubek and Gowdy for inciting death threats against him. 
Later, Kubek got 1,000 letters dubbing him a Boston stooge. In 1978, Kubek 
had said of New York Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner that "He's got 
an expensive toy. Baseball's tough enough without an owner harassing you." 
In a Sports Illustrated article on May 27, 1991 on the Yankees' bad season, 
he would go on to criticize Steinbrenner once again by saying, "George's 
legacy is not the World Series winners of '77 and '78 or having the best 
record of any team in the '80s, his legacy is these past five seasons—teams 
with worse and worse records culminating in last year's last-place finish." 
Kubek also added, "George talked a lot about tradition, but it was all 
phony, it was just him trying to be part of the tradition. You can't manufacture 
tradition in a plastic way. You have to have a certain class to go with 
it." The team of Kubek and Bob Costas (backing up[6] Vin Scully and Joe 
Garagiola and later, Tom Seaver) proved to be a formidable pair. Costas 
was praised by fans for both his reverence and irreverence while Kubek 
was praised for his technical approach and historical perspective. One 
of the pair's most memorable broadcasts was the "(Ryne) Sandberg Game" 
(between the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals at Chicago's Wrigley 
Field) on June 23, 1984. Kubek and Costas, who had worked together since 
1983 (and in the process, called four American League Championship Series: 
1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989), called the final edition (the 981st overall) 
of NBC's Game of the Week which aired on September 30, 1989. Coincidentally, 
that particular game featured the Toronto Blue Jays (which was as previously 
mentioned, a team that Kubek was long associated with as a broadcaster, 
from 1977 to 1989) beating the Baltimore Orioles 4–3 to clinch the AL East 
title at SkyDome. When the subject came up of NBC losing the rights to 
televising Major League Baseball for the first time since 1946, Kubek simply 
said, "I can't believe it!" The final broadcast for Kubek and Costas as 
a team was Game 5 of the 1989 American League Championship Series (October 
8), also at SkyDome, where the Oakland Athletics won to advance to the 
World Series.[7] When NBC lost its baseball TV rights to CBS after the 
1989 season, Kubek left the national scene, joining the Yankees' local 
cable-TV announcing team (which earned Kubek US$525,000 a year). Kubek 
spent five years calling games for the Yankees (1990–1994) on the MSG Network 
with Dewayne Staats, where he earned fans and critics' respect for his 
honesty. After 1994, Kubek effectively quit broadcasting.[8] He explained 
his sudden retirement from sportscasting by saying: "I hate what the game's 
become—the greed, the nastiness. You can be married to baseball, give your 
heart to it, but when it starts taking over your soul, it's time to say 
'whoa'." Kubek added, "I want to go home and spend more time with my family. 
They deserve it more than anyone. I don't need that ego stuff. I feel sorry 
for those who do." Kubek's resignation coincided with the bitter strike[9] 
that wound up cancelling the World Series in 1994. In a 2008 New York Times 
article, Kubek claimed not to have seen a major league game since his retirement 
from broadcasting.[10] Kubek lives in Appleton, Wisconsin and is a supporter 
of the Fox Valley Lutheran High School and its baseball team.[11] On December 
22, 2008, Tony Kubek was named the recipient of the 2009 Ford C. Frick 
Award, an honor bestowed on broadcasters by the Baseball Hall of Fame.[12] 
Kubek was selected for the honor by a committee of 15 prior Frick Award 
winners and five broadcast historians and columnists.[13] Kubek became 
the first Frick Award winner whose broadcast career was solely in television, 
and the first to have called games for a Canadian team, the Toronto Blue 
Jays, from 1977 through 1989.[12] Kubek is a committed Democrat. In 1976, 
he declined to come to South Carolina to campaign for former teammate Bobby 
Richardson, a Republican, who ended up losing a close race for the U.S. 
House of Representatives to incumbent Democrat Kenneth Holland by a 51%
