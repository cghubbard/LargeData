The Palm Desert Coyotes are an independent professional baseball team that 
is based in Palm Springs, California as a part of the California Winter 
League. They play their games in a short-season schedule from January to 
February at Palm Springs Stadium and at the nearby Palm Springs High School 
baseball field, along with the Palm Springs Chill, Canada A's and Coachella 
Valley Snowbirds and several other teams. The Coyotes didn't play in 2012 
due to a team suspension of operations. They were replaced by the winter 
league version of the Palm Springs Power. The Coyotes returned in 2013.
