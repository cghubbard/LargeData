Power pitcher is a term in baseball for a pitcher who relies on the velocity 
of his pitches, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. Power pitchers usually 
record a high number of strikeouts, and statistics such as strikeouts per 
9 innings pitched are common measures of power.[1] An average pitcher strikes 
out about 5 batters per nine innings while a power pitcher will often strike 
out one or more every inning.[1] The prototypical power pitcher is National 
Baseball Hall of Fame member, Nolan Ryan,[2] who struck out a Major League 
Baseball record 5,714 batters in 5,386 innings. Ryan recorded seven no-hitters, 
appeared in eight Major League Baseball All-Star Games but also holds the 
record for most walks issued (2,795).[3] A famous fictional example of 
a power pitcher is Ricky "Wild Thing" Vaughn from the film Major League, 
a character sports journalist Scott Lauber once called "the power pitcher 
everyone on my high school baseball team wished they were".[4] Actor Charlie 
Sheen performed that role; he had actually played baseball earlier in his 
life, prior to acting, as a pitcher.[5] Additional, non-fictional prominent 
power pitchers include Hall of Famers Walter Johnson, Bob Gibson, Sandy 
Koufax, Randy Johnson and Bob Feller. Feller himself famously led his league 
in strikeouts and walks several times.[6] The traditional school of thought 
on power pitching was known as "throw till you blow".[7] However, multimillion-dollar 
contracts have changed mentalities.[7] The number of pitches thrown is 
now counted by a team's staff, with particular attention paid to young 
power arms.[7] The care which some of the older power pitchers took with 
their arms has allowed for long careers and further opportunity after they 
have stopped playing. For example, player Roger Clemens has remained in
