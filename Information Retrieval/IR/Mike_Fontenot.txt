Michael Eugene "Mike" Fontenot (born June 9, 1980) is an American former 
professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball for 
the Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies. Mike 
Fontenot was a standout for Salmen High School in Slidell, Louisiana. After 
his senior year, he was drafted in the 21st round (625th overall) of the 
1999 MLB Amateur Entry Draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, but chose to 
attend Louisiana State University on a baseball scholarship instead of 
going professional. At Louisiana State University, Fontenot received National 
Freshman of the Year recognition as LSU's starting second baseman, batting 
.353 (103-for-292) with 13 doubles, three triples, 17 home runs, 64 RBI, 
93 runs, and eight steals. He became the third LSU player to win National 
Freshman of the Year award, following second baseman Todd Walker (1992) 
and pitcher Brett Laxton (1993). Fontenot's 17 home runs set an LSU freshman 
record, surpassing the previous mark of 15 established by Blair Barbier 
in 1997. In 2000, he was named to the NCAA Baton Rouge Regional all-tournament 
team, hitting .400 (6-for-15) with two doubles, one home run, five RBI, 
and five runs scored. He was named to the College World Series all-tournament 
team as he hit a team-best .462 (6-for-13) with two doubles, one home run, 
two RBI, and six runs scored. He, along with future Chicago Cubs teammate 
Ryan Theriot, was a member of the LSU Tigers baseball team that won the 
2000 College World Series. The second baseman was LSU's leading hitter 
in the NCAA Baseball Tournament, batting .432 (16-for-37) in nine games 
with four doubles, two home runs and nine RBI. After his time at LSU, Fontenot 
was chosen in the first round (19th overall) of the 2001 MLB Amateur Entry 
Draft by the Baltimore Orioles.[2] Fontenot signed with the Orioles, garnering 
a $1,300,000.00 signing bonus as part of the deal.[citation needed] Fontenot 
began his minor league career with the Frederick Keys of the Single-A advanced 
Carolina League in 2002. In 122 games, he batted .264 with 127 hits, eight 
home runs, and 53 RBI.[3] In 2003, he played for the Bowie Baysox of the 
Double-A Eastern League. In 126 games, he batted .325 (second in the league 
to Alex Ríos's .352) with 146 hits (ninth), 12 home runs, and 66 RBI.[4] 
Fontenot played for the Ottawa Lynx of the Triple-A International League 
in 2004. In 136 games (tied with Earl Snyder for fourth in the league behind 
Bry Nelson's 142, Víctor Díaz's 141, and Jhonny Peralta's 138), he batted 
.279 with 146 hits, eight home runs, 49 RBI, and 10 triples (tied for second 
in the league with John Rodriguez and Pete Orr behind Mark Budzinski's 
15).[5] Entering the 2005 season, Baseball America ranked Fontenot the 
seventh-best prospect in the Orioles' organization.[6] On February 3, 2005, 
Fontenot was traded to the Chicago Cubs along with 2B/OF Jerry Hairston, 
Jr. and RHP Dave Crouthers for slugger Sammy Sosa. Until his trade to the 
San Francisco Giants on August 11, 2010, Fontenot was the only remaining 
player from that trade still with the Cubs.[7] As part of the Cubs' farm 
system, Fontenot played for the Iowa Cubs of the AAA Pacific Coast League 
(2005–2007). Fontenot made his Major League debut with the Cubs on April 
13, 2005. In seven games with the team, he went 0-for-2 with 2 walks and 
4 runs scored. In 2006, he spent the entire season with Iowa, batting .296 
with 107 hits, eight home runs, and 36 RBI in 111 games.[3] He did not 
return to the Cubs until May 15, 2007, when he was promoted from AAA to 
replace relief pitcher Rocky Cherry. He wore Mark Grace's old number, 17. 
After a fast start, including finishing second in the National League Rookie 
of the Month voting for June 2007, he became the Cubs' starting second 
baseman in 2009. After batting .231 into mid-August, Fontenot lost his 
position as the Cubs everyday second baseman, splitting time with Jeff 
Baker. On May 7, 2010, Fontenot hit his first career grand slam against 
the Cincinnati Reds. It was Fontenot's first home run of the 2010 season, 
coming in the eighth inning off the first pitch from Carlos Fisher, with 
the Cubs up 10–4. During his time with the Cubs Fontenot played himself 
in the TBS comedy My Boys in the third season finale "Spring Training." 
On August 11, 2010, Fontenot was traded to the San Francisco Giants for 
Evan Crawford. On October 23, the Giants beat the Philadelphia Phillies 
in six games to advance to the World Series. Fontenot got a hit in his 
only at-bat in the NLCS clinching game. He was part of the 25-man World 
Series roster and has the unusual distinction of being credited with appearing 
in the World Series with neither a plate appearance nor play in the field.[8] 
In the eighth inning of Game 2, the left-handed-hitting Fontenot was announced 
as a pinch-hitter with the Giants leading the Rangers, 6–0. The Rangers 
replaced their right-handed pitcher with a left-hander, prompting the Giants 
to replace Fontenot with the right-handed Aaron Rowand. Rowand tripled. 
Fontenot did not appear in another game in the World Series which the Giants 
won in five games.[9] On April 13, 2011, Fontenot hit a go-ahead homer 
to help the Giants win 4-3 over the rival Los Angeles Dodgers. On March 
30, 2012, Fontenot was released by the Giants during Spring Training. On 
April 13, 2012, the Philadelphia Phillies agreed to sign Fontenot to a 
minor league contract.[10] He was initially assigned to the AAA Lehigh 
Valley Iron Pigs,[11] but returned to Majors in May.[12] On August 1, Fontenot 
was designated for assignment by the Phillies. Fontenot had a triple-slash 
of .289/.343/.340 in 45 games, but he was 1 for 15 against left-handed 
pitchers. Michael Martínez was recalled to take his place.[13] Fontenot 
was part of the Tampa Bay Rays organization in 2013, playing for the AAA 
Durham Bulls.[14] On January 9, 2014 Fontenot signed a minor league contract 
with the Washington Nationals. He was released on March 26, 2014 after 
hitting just .105 in Spring Training. Fontenot signed a minor league deal 
with the Tampa Bay Rays on March 28, 2014, and was assigned to Triple-A
