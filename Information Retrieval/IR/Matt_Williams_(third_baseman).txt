As player As manager Matthew Derrick Williams (born November 28, 1965), 
nicknamed "Matt the Bat" and "The Big Marine" is a former professional 
baseball third baseman. A right-handed batter, Williams played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants, the Cleveland Indians, 
and the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was the manager of the Washington Nationals 
from 2014 to 2015. Williams played in a World Series for each of these 
teams (1989 with the Giants, 1997 with the Indians, and 2001 with the Diamondbacks 
in which he won over the New York Yankees). During these years, Williams 
became the only player to hit at least one World Series home run for three 
different Major League baseball teams.[1] During his career, Williams had 
an overall batting average of .268, with 378 home runs and 1218 runs batted 
in (RBIs). He scored 997 Major League runs, and he accumulated 1878 hits, 
338 doubles, and 35 triples, while playing in 1866 regular-season games. 
As of August, 2015 – 13 years after his final game – he still ranks in 
the top 75 all-time players for career home runs and the top 150 all-time 
players for career RBIs. Williams originally was selected by the New York 
Mets from Carson High School in Carson City, Nevada, but he did not sign 
with the Mets. Williams was the starting quarterback on the Carson Senators 
football team in high school. Two of his teammates who played baseball 
in high school, Bob Ayrault and Charlie Kerfeld, also played baseball in 
the major leagues. Williams accepted a baseball scholarship to play for 
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and after attending college and playing 
baseball there, Williams was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 
first round (the 3rd pick) of the 1986 pro baseball draft. Williams began 
his major league career in 1987 primarily as a short stop for the Giants 
while playing some games at third base also. He played both short stop 
and third base until the 1990 season when he became the starting third 
baseman for the Giants and went on to lead the National League in Runs 
Batted In with 122 while making the National League All Star team. Despite 
suffering from several leg injuries and some lower-back ailments, Williams 
was an excellent fielder at third base, and a dangerous and productive 
hitter. As a third baseman, Williams had good reflexes and excellent hands, 
plus a quick release with his strong and accurate arm. Williams was one 
of the premier fielders at third base, as he earned four Gold Glove Awards 
between 1991 and 1997. A hitter with exceptional power, six times he hit 
more than 30 home runs in a baseball season as a Giant, with more than 
90 runs batted in. His best season was 1994 when he hit a National League-best 
43 home runs and had an impressive 96 runs batted in (RBI) in only 110 
games as the Major League Baseball season was shortened by nearly one-third 
because of a season-ending strike by Major League baseball players. He 
was on pace to challenge the single season home run record of 61, at the 
time held by Roger Maris, with his 43 home runs in 115 Giants games projecting 
to 60.6 home runs at season's end. Williams finished second in the voting 
for the National League Most Valuable Player Award that year behind first 
baseman, Jeff Bagwell, of the Houston Astros. Williams was an original 
member of the Arizona Diamondbacks, and holds the Diamondbacks record for 
the most RBIs in one season with a total of 142 during 1999. (This record 
has since been tied by Luis Gonzalez in 2001, but has never been exceeded.) 
Williams was a partial owner of the Diamondbacks, and carried the title 
of "Special Assistant to the General Partner". Williams occasionally also 
served as color commentator during Diamondbacks radio and television broadcasts,[2] 
and also assisted in coaching and with player personnel matters. Williams 
was hired in November 2009 by the Diamondbacks to be the first base coach 
for 2010. Williams moved from first base coach to third base coach for 
the 2011 season, while working under 1st-year manager Kirk Gibson. When 
Williams retired from baseball in 2003 he was fifth on the list of most 
career home runs by a Third Baseman (359). On October 31, 2013, the Washington 
Nationals announced that they had hired Williams to replace Davey Johnson 
as their manager for the 2014 season.[3] Prior to the 2015 season, the 
Nationals exercised an option to extend Williams through the 2016 season.[4] 
Williams managed the Nationals to a NL East division title and the playoffs,[5] 
but lost the NLDS to the San Francisco Giants. Williams was named the 2014 
National League Manager of the Year. On October 5, 2015, the Nationals 
fired Williams after a disappointing season where they were favored to 
win the World Series and failed to make the playoffs.[6] He finished with 
a record of 179 wins and 145 losses.[7] On November 6, 2007, the San Francisco 
Chronicle reported that Williams purchased $11,600 worth of human growth 
hormone, steroids and other drugs from the Palm Beach clinic in 2002.[8] 
Williams later told the Chronicle he used HGH on the advice of a doctor 
to treat an ankle injury he suffered during spring training in 2002. On 
December 13, 2007, he was named among the dozens of players alleged to 
have used steroids in the Mitchell Report, commissioned by Major League 
Baseball and written by former Senator George J. Mitchell.[9] Williams 
became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. He received 
just 1.3% of the votes, and was dropped off the ballot.[10] Williams has 
been married three times. His first wife, Tracie, left with their three 
children for another.[11][12] His second wife (January 1999 – July 2002) 
was the American film actress, Michelle Johnson. She filed for divorce 
in 2002, listing irreconcilable differences as the reason.[13] The couple 
had no children, and in July 2002 their divorce was final. In 2003, Williams 
became engaged to Phoenix news anchor, Erika Monroe, who is a TV news anchor 
from KTVK-TV, a TV hostess and creator of the cooking and lifestyle website, 
The Hopeless Housewife; they married in 2003.[12] In 2007 the couple co-hosted 
the weekend pre-game shows for the Arizona Diamondbacks called "DBacks 
on Deck". They are the parents of one child and live in Paradise Valley, 
Arizona. Williams is the grandson of former major league outfielder Bert
