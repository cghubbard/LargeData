James Calvin "Jimmy" Rollins (born November 27, 1978), nicknamed "J-Roll",[1] 
is an American professional baseball shortstop who is a free agent. He 
has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies 
from 2000 to 2014, the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2015 and the Chicago White 
Sox in 2016. After growing up in Alameda, California, and attending Encinal 
High School, Rollins was drafted by the Phillies in the second round of 
the 1996 MLB draft, spending most of five seasons with Phillies minor league 
teams before earning a promotion to the MLB team. In Philadelphia, Rollins 
earned a reputation as an excellent defensive shortstop. In July 2001, 
Rollins became the Phillies' leadoff hitter, a role he retained for almost 
ten years. He made three All-Star Game appearances early in his career. 
While a Phillie, Rollins compiled a 38-game hitting streak, which spanned 
the end of the 2005 season and the start of the 2006 season, the longest 
in team history. Rollins was named the National League Most Valuable Player 
in 2007, as the Phillies won their division in the first of five consecutive 
seasons. He was also a key component of the 2008 World Series champion 
team. In his final season with the Phillies, he became the franchise's 
all-time leader in hits. During the offseason, he was traded to the Dodgers 
for the 2015 season. Rollins grew up in Alameda as a member of an athletic 
family.[2] His mother played competitive fastpitch softball, and credits 
the experience for helping him develop a cerebral approach to the game 
as well as a passion for the middle infield;[3]His father ran track and 
later became a body builder however trained and worked Jimmy and his brother 
out; he has been described as having "a near-photographic memory of games 
and at-bats and pitches".[4] Rollins' brother, Antwon, played with minor 
league affiliates of the Texas Rangers and the Montreal Expos.[5] His sister, 
Shay Rollins, was a starter on the University of San Francisco's women's 
basketball team,[6] and he is the cousin of former MLB player Tony Tarasco.[7] 
Despite the athletes in his family, his father encouraged Rollins to pursue 
music as well as baseball; Rollins played the trumpet while growing up, 
and participated in various MC Hammer and Mavis Staples music videos during 
his adolescent years.[2][8] Rollins attended Encinal High School in Alameda, 
graduating in 1996.[8] His parents refused to let him continue playing 
football, instead directing him to focus on baseball.[3] He finished his 
high school baseball career as the holder of 10 school records, including 
highest batting average (.484), and most stolen bases (99). For his performance, 
USA Today named him a member of its All-USA High School Baseball Team, 
and Baseball America named him the top infielder in Northern California 
as well as a second-team All-American.[8] He committed to play college 
baseball at Arizona State University on a scholarship, but after "effusive" 
praise from Phillies Bay Area scout Bob Poole, the team drafted him in 
the second round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft.[3] After being 
drafted by the Yankees in the second round of the 1996 draft,[7] Rollins 
was assigned to the rookie-league Martinsville Phillies. He led the team 
in walks and stole 20 bases, but batted only .238.[9] However, he still 
earned a promotion to low-A Piedmont for the 1997 season. The youngest 
player on the team at age 18,[8] Rollins led the team in games played, 
at-bats, runs, hits, triples, stolen bases, and walks all in the same year.[10] 
He batted .270, stole 46 bases, and had 560 at-bats, over 100 more than 
second-place Dave Francia.[10] For his performance, he was named a co-winner 
of the Paul Owens Award, given to the Phillies' top minor league player. 
At the end of the season he played in the Florida Instructional League.[8] 
Rollins was promoted to high-A Clearwater in 1998. While playing alongside 
future Phillies teammates Pat Burrell, Johnny Estrada, Adam Eaton, and 
Brandon Duckworth, Rollins batted .244 with 18 doubles and 23 stolen bases; 
once again, he was the youngest player on the team.[11] Eaton, Burrell, 
and Rollins were all promoted to AA Reading together the next year, and 
Rollins led the team in games and at-bats, as well as hits. His 145 hits 
gave him an average of .273,[12] and led to a late-season promotion to 
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where he played four games.[13] In 2000, he led 
Scranton in games played, doubles, and triples, and helped lead the team 
to the playoffs.[14] Rollins received a September callup to the Phillies. 
He debuted on September 17 against the Florida Marlins and had two hits 
in four at-bats in the game, with his first MLB hit being a triple off 
of Chuck Smith of the Marlins.[15] He batted .321 in 14 games, stealing 
three bases and batting in five runs.[7] After the season, Baseball America 
named him the Phillies' top organizational prospect. He was a finalist 
for the United States national baseball team to participate in the 2000 
Olympics, but did not survive the final cut.[8] Rollins spent the entire 
2001 season with the major league Phillies and hit his first MLB home run 
on May 2 off of Brian Bohanon of the Colorado Rockies.[16] He achieved 
several statistical milestones, including a "quadruple-double" (double 
digit doubles, triples, home runs, and stolen bases).[7] Moreover, he led 
the National League in triples and stolen bases, becoming the first rookie 
to do so since 1951, as well as leading the NL in at bats.[8] He was a 
member of the NL all-star team in the 2001 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game, the Phillies only representative.[17] In July, he took over from 
Doug Glanville as the Phillies' leadoff hitter, a role he seldom ceded 
for nearly a decade.[18][19] At the conclusion of the season, the Negro 
Leagues Baseball Museum named him the co-winner of the Cool Papa Bell Award, 
given to the stolen bases leader, MLB managers voted him to the Topps Major 
League Rookie All-Star team, and Baseball America named him the fifth-best 
rookie in MLB.[8] Entering the 2002 season, despite his youth, Rollins 
sought to be a leader in the Phillies' clubhouse; an article in The Philadelphia 
Inquirer said, "Rollins, even at just 23 years old, may now have the clout 
needed to be a stern voice that makes a difference in the clubhouse and 
on the field."[18] Rollins' season was characterized by a strong first 
half, and a "sophomore jinx" at the plate that plagued him in the second 
half of the season.[20] For his performance in the early months of the 
season, he earned his second consecutive selection to the MLB All-Star 
game, in doing so becoming the first Phillie and first MLB shortstop ever 
to reach the game in each of his first two seasons.[8] After the all-star 
game, however, he struggled at the plate, striking out frequently and chasing 
many high pitches that were out of the strike zone.[20] Ultimately, Rollins 
finished the season among the NL leaders in defensive statistics – he compiled 
a .980 fielding percentage (second in NL), 695 total chances (third in 
NL), 504 assists (fourth in NL), and 226 putouts (fifth in NL). Meanwhile, 
offensively, he regressed from his 2001 campaign, posting a .245 batting 
average with 11 home runs, but still leading the NL with 10 triples; he 
stole 31 bases, 15 fewer than he did in 2001. After the season, he participated 
in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.[8] Prior to the 2003 
season, he worked with Tony Gwynn on skills at the plate, predominantly 
using the whole field and being more of a "slap hitter".[21][22] However, 
he began the season slowly, sustaining a hamstring injury in spring training 
that hindered his progress,[23] and ultimately struggling at the plate 
early in the season, causing manager Larry Bowa to drop him in the lineup.[24] 
Throughout the season, he sought to maintain the focus that he admitted 
to having lost the previous season,[25] and he eventually rebounded to 
post a "respectable" stat line – a .263 batting average with eight home 
runs and 62 RBIs, although he stole what at the time was a career-low 20 
bases.[8][26] Among his season highlights were a game-winning RBI against 
John Smoltz in June, and stealing his 100th career base in September, both 
of which occurred in games against the Atlanta Braves.[8] On January 15, 
Rollins signed a US$2,400,000 contract with the Phillies to avoid salary 
arbitration.[27] According to one biography of Rollins, "In 2004, Jimmy 
finally became the player the Phillies had been waiting for. He batted 
.289 with a .455 slugging percentage, scored 119 runs, led the league in 
triples, cut down considerably on his strikeouts, batted well from both 
sides of the plate, and hit well in the clutch. The workouts with Gwynn 
had helped, but it was joining morning sessions with (Bobby) Abreu that 
enabled him to sting the ball with authority and consistency."[26] Overall, 
he achieved another "quadruple–double" (home runs, stolen bases, doubles, 
and triples in double figures in a single season), his first career grand 
slam, and posted career highs in a plethora of offensive categories including 
batting average, slugging percentage, RBIs, and hits.[8] Under new manager 
Charlie Manuel, whose offensive strategy predominantly revolved around 
hitting lots of home runs, Rollins struggled to post a strong batting average 
early in the Phillies' 2005 season, as he too tried to hit home runs.[26] 
Nevertheless, he was again selected to the NL All-Star team.[8] His offensive 
strategy changed in early August, when he began a hitting streak that spanned 
the season's final 36 games; during the streak, he hit .379.[8] It was 
the longest hitting streak in Phillies' history, surpassing Ed Delahanty, 
whose streak lasted 31 games.[28][29] Throughout the streak, Rollins aspired 
to maintain a team-first mentality, and noted that he would trade the streak 
for a playoff berth: "If we lose and I keep the streak, what does that 
mean? The season is automatically over. The playoffs is everything. That's 
what we all want."[30] Ultimately, the Phillies missed the playoffs by 
one game.[31] Overall, Rollins compiled his fourth career quadruple-double, 
tying Jonny Damon for most among active players, and posted a .290 batting 
average with 12 home runs, 54 RBIs, and 41 stolen bases.[1][8] The 2006 
Phillies season began with much hype surrounding Rollins, and whether he 
could extend his hitting streak to pass Joe DiMaggio's record 56 games.[32][33] 
He extended the streak two games into the season, but it ended on April 
6 when he failed to get a hit in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals.[34][35] 
He struggled during the first half of the season, posting a batting average 
of just .259, but rebounded during the second half, ultimately posting 
strong cumulative numbers once again.[26] He became the third player in 
Phillies' history to score at least 100 runs in three consecutive seasons 
(Chuck Klein and Bobby Abreu), and led all NL shortstops in RBIs, runs 
scored, extra-base hits, and total bases. He was just short, however, of 
another quadruple-double. Cumulatively, he hit .277 with 25 home runs and 
83 RBIs (at the time, the latter two were career-highs).[8] Once again, 
the Phillies barely missed the playoffs.[36] Before spring training, Rollins 
announced that the Phillies were the "Team to Beat" in the National League 
East: The Mets had a chance to win the World Series last year. Last year 
is over. I think we are the team to beat in the NL East, finally. But, 
that's only on paper." It became a sports media sensation, especially given 
that the New York Mets had won the division in 2006 with relative ease. 
The claim was widely reported, often without the second part of the quote 
("only on paper"). USA Today columnist Hal Bodley opined, "The Phillies 
have needed someone to light a fire, especially in April. Rollins' bold, 
if not arrogant, prediction might just do that."[38] During the first half 
of the season, it appeared Rollins had spoken prematurely, as the Mets 
jumped out to an early divisional lead.[26] On June 28, Rollins had a four-hit 
game against the Cincinnati Reds, including a game-tying triple.[39] The 
triple was Rollins' 10th, which gave him his fifth career "quadruple–double".[8] 
In August, the Mets' lead began to dissipate, as the Phillies combined 
several solid series; Rollins was a key component of their success.[40][41][42] 
Rollins was named the National League Player of the Week for August 27 
to September 2, 2007.[8][43] On September 25 against the Atlanta Braves, 
Rollins hit the home run that completed his 30–30 season.[44] On the last 
day of the 2007 season, Rollins became the seventh player to collect at 
least 20 doubles, 20 triples, and 20 home runs in one season when he hit 
his 20th triple of the year in a 6–1 win over the Washington Nationals 
that clinched the National League East division championship for the Phillies, 
which confirmed Rollins' preseason assertion of the Phillies preeminence.[45] 
The club advanced to the playoffs for the first time since their 1993 World 
Series loss; however, they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the National 
League Division Series.[46] Rollins was named the National League's Most 
Valuable Player.[47][48] He also received the NLBM Oscar Charleston Legacy 
Award (NL MVP), and won the first of three consecutive Gold Glove Awards, 
becoming the first Phillies shortstop to win a Gold Glove since Larry Bowa 
in 1978.[8] He was the first player in MLB history to record 200 hits, 
20 triples, 30 home runs, and 30 stolen bases in a season.[49] Unlike in 
spring training 2007, Rollins "made no guarantees heading into the next 
season, but that didn't mean the Phillies weren't confident" entering their 
2008 season, despite the Mets' acquisition of Johan Santana and a "2007 
Rollins-esque" guarantee of winning the division from Carlos Beltrán.[26] 
After beginning the season by hitting a home run on opening day, Rollins 
landed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his career in early 
April, suffering an ankle sprain.[8] He returned in May, and had a "productive" 
summer, ultimately posting a career-high 47 stolen bases, notwithstanding 
his batting average dropping to .277, and his home run and RBI totals dropping 
to 11 and 59 respectively.[8][26] In the postseason, Rollins was a focal 
point of the team, which ultimately won the 2008 World Series; in the division 
series (NLDS), he hit a leadoff home run in game four, and in the championship 
series (NLCS), he hit a leadoff home run in game five, and despite struggles 
early in the World Series, he eventually contributed with strong situational 
hitting, helping the Phillies win the series in five games.[8][26] At the 
conclusion of the season, Rollins was honored with a Fielding Bible Award 
for defensive excellence as the top MLB shortstop during the year.[50] 
Rollins began 2009 by participating in the 2009 World Baseball Classic 
(WBC) as a member of Team USA; he hit .417 and was named to the all-tournament 
team.[51] After setting a career high in stolen bases in 2008, he did not 
steal one in the season's first 17 games, his longest drought to begin 
a season since 2004. On May 21, he reached the 1500-hit milestone in a 
game against the Cincinnati Reds.[8] As of the end of June, however, he 
was hitting just .205 (he went 28 consecutive at-bats without a hit from 
the end of June until July 2),[8] and was benched for four games by Charlie 
Manuel in an effort to encourage him to regain the shorter, lower half-driven 
swing that he used in his 2007 MVP campaign.[52] He did improve in the 
second half of the season, batting .288 from July 3 to the end of the year. 
Overall, he compiled an NL-leading 672 at-bats, finished fourth in doubles 
(43) and stolen bases (31), and tenth in runs (100); in addition, he had 
a .250 batting average, 21 home runs (five of which were leadoff, the most 
in his career), and 77 RBIs, also winning the National League Gold Glove 
award for shortstops. In the postseason, he helped the Phillies reach the 
2009 World Series by hitting a walk-off double in game four of the NLCS.[8] 
The Phillies failed to repeat as champions, however. They lost to the New 
York Yankees.[53] Rollins' 2010 season was marked by injuries; he missed 
a total of 74 games, playing in only 88, the lowest total of his major 
league career.[8] While warming up in the outfield prior to the Phillies' 
game on April 12, he strained his right calf, and eventually was placed 
on the disabled list.[54] He spent April 13–May 16, and May 22–June 21 
on the DL with that injury; Wilson Valdez served as his backup.[55] When 
he returned, he hit his first career walk-off home run on June 23, powering 
the Phillies to a 7–6 victory over the Cleveland Indians.[56] On July 3, 
he hit his 150th career home run in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
and on October 1, he hit his third career grand slam in a game against 
the Atlanta Braves.[8] Overall, he hit .243 with eight home runs and 41 
RBIs.[1] He maintained his strong defense despite poor offense, but after 
his third consecutive mediocre offensive season, some questioned whether 
his MVP campaign in 2007 was a fluke.[55] 2011 was a contract year for 
Rollins, and his performance concurrently rebounded, insofar as he improved 
his batting average, and home run and RBI totals.[8][55] He made his 11th 
consecutive opening day start, and, for the first time in several seasons, 
he was healthy at the beginning of the season, starting the season's first 
49 games. Nevertheless, it took him 54 plate appearances to record his 
first RBI, the longest drought of his career. On July 20, for the second 
time in his career, he had a multi-home run game in which one home run 
came batting right-handed and the other left-handed, the first Phillies 
player to do it multiple times.[8] His season was not entirely devoid of 
injuries; on August 22, a right groin strain landed him on the DL, causing 
him to miss 18 games.[57] He returned in time for the playoffs, and set 
several Phillies records in the 2011 NLDS, including hits (9), doubles 
(4), and multi-hit games (4).[8] Despite the records, the Phillies lost 
the series to the St. Louis Cardinals.[58] Overall, he posted a .268 batting 
average with 16 home runs and 63 RBIs.[1] At the season's conclusion, Rollins 
was selected as the shortstop on the MLB Insiders Club Magazine All-Postseason 
Team.[59] On December 17, 2011, Rollins signed a three-year, $33 million 
deal with a vesting option for a fourth year, worth another $11 million.[60] 
The option vested when he reached 1,100 plate appearances in 2013-14.[61] 
In 2012, Rollins epitomized the Phillies' general "averageness" by posting 
a .250 batting average with 23 home runs and 68 RBIs.[62] He hit poorly 
in the beginning of the season, and did not hit a home run until his 136th 
at bat of the season, the second-longest it had ever taken him to hit a 
home run at the beginning of a season.[8][63] He missed three games from 
May 21–23 for the birth of his first daughter. On July 31, he hit his fourth 
career inside-the-park home run, which led active players.[8] His hitting 
improved over the latter half of the season,[63] and in September, he hit 
eight home runs.[8] He missed the final three games of the season with 
a calf strain. During the season, he joined Craig Biggio, Barry Larkin, 
and Paul Molitor as the only players in MLB history to record 2000 hits, 
350 stolen bases, and 150 home runs as a member of one team. It was his 
fourth career season during which he hit at least 20 home runs and stole 
30 bases, which trailed only Bobby and Barry Bonds.[8] Prior to the 2013 
season, Rollins played for Team USA in the 2013 World Baseball Classic 
(WBC), and was the only player from Team USA to make the event's all-star 
team; it was his second WBC, and second placement on the all-star team.[64] 
He was back to the Phillies in time for opening day, and made his 13th 
consecutive start on opening day. Overall, he tied for fifth in the NL 
in games (160), and led the team with 600 at-bats, 151 hits, 36 doubles, 
and 59 walks. He achieved several career milestones during the season, 
including his 800th RBI (April 22), his 433 double (breaking Ed Delahanty's 
record on May 15), and his 45th career leadoff home run (fourth most in 
MLB history; hit on July 20).[8] Despite the achievements, overall, the 
season was a decline from previous years; his isolated power (ISO) was 
among the worst in the major leagues, he attempted to steal the fewest 
amount of bases in his career, and his defense "tanked" according to fielding 
metrics.[65] He "struggled mightily", and ultimately posted a .252 batting 
average with six home runs and 39 RBIs.[8] which "could be the beginning 
of his decline as an effective Major League hitter".[66] Rollins attracted 
media attention in the offseason prior to 2014 when he supposedly expressed 
disinclination or lack of motivation after commenting "who cares" in regards 
to spring training; Buster Olney penned a column suggesting that there 
was a sentiment within the Phillies' organization that he should be traded 
(the rumors were dispelled by Rollins and Phillies general manager Rubén 
Amaro, Jr. as ridiculous).[67][68] He opened the season by hitting a grand 
slam against the Texas Rangers, which was also his 200th career home run.[69] 
After two games, Rollins left the team on paternity leave to be with his 
wife as the couple had their second child.[70] On April 12, he hit a walk-off 
home run against the Miami Marlins.[71] On June 14, Rollins singled to 
right field for his 2,235th hit to surpass Mike Schmidt as the Phillies' 
all-time leader in hits. The game paused as Schmidt and the remainder of 
the Phillies congratulated Rollins at first base.[72][73] Following the 
season, Rollins became the first ever co-winner of the Roberto Clemente 
Award when he and recently retired Chicago White Sox captain Paul Konerko 
being announced as the awards' recipients.[74] On December 19, 2014, Rollins 
was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for minor league pitchers 
Tom Windle and Zach Eflin.[75] Rollins waived his no-trade clause in order 
for the trade to be accomplished and he stated that he was expecting to 
take on a leadership position with his new team.[76] Rollins played his 
first game with the Dodgers during opening day against the San Diego Padres 
on April 6, 2015, hitting a 3-run homer off of Shawn Kelley, giving the 
Dodgers a 6-3 victory over the Padres.[77] He struggled offensively with 
the Dodgers, hitting a career low .224 with 13 homers and 41 RBI. He also 
stole eight bases.[78] In September, he lost his starting job to rookie 
Corey Seager.[79] On the final day of the season, in a meaningless game, 
manager Don Mattingly let Rollins manage the club for the game.[80] On 
February 22, 2016, Rollins signed a minor league contract with the Chicago 
White Sox that included an invitation to major league spring training. 
He competed with Tyler Saladino for a starting role at shortstop.[81] At 
the end of spring training, the team announced that Rollins would serve 
as their Opening Day shortstop.[82] Rollins batted .221 in 41 games for 
the White Sox. On June 10, he was designated for assignment so the White 
Sox could promote Tim Anderson from the minor leagues.[83] Growing up, 
Rollins admired Rickey Henderson, one of the best leadoff hitters in MLB 
history, and especially early in his career, sought to emulate Henderson 
at the plate.[20] This contributed to his propensity to swing early in 
the count, and chase high pitches, seeking to hit home runs rather than 
get on base, the stereotypical role of a leadoff hitter.[84] Consequently, 
he struggled to make contact with the ball, striking out too much, and 
rarely walking.[18][20] To help alleviate those predominantly negative 
tendencies, he worked with Tony Gwynn, Sr. prior to the 2003 season to 
work on using the whole field, and hit more ground balls than pop-ups.[21] 
Overall, he "always had a hard time accepting that he is vertically challenged 
at 5-foot-8", which contributed to his inclination to strive to hit for 
power rather than contact, and to seek to pull the ball rather than use 
the whole field.[85] The Phillies all-time leader in hits, he also is second 
in Phillies history in stolen bases.[86][87] A "supreme defensive shortstop", 
Rollins has won four Gold Glove Awards, and only Omar Vizquel has a better 
fielding percentage among shortstops who have played at least 10 seasons.[88] 
Rollins attributes some of his defensive prowess to experience, noting 
that he has played in MLB for a long enough time to know most hitters' 
tendencies and to learn how to read swings, both of which help him appropriately 
position himself to get to as many balls as possible.[88] In their 2011 
season preview, Lindy's Sports commented that Rollins is an upper-echelon 
shortstop "with soft hands, excellent agility and plus range left and right", 
going on to praise his strong throwing arm, especially from the hole.[89] 
Rollins resides in Woolwich Township, New Jersey,[90] and is married to 
Johari Smith. They were married on January 23, 2010 in the Cayman Islands.[91] 
On May 21, 2012, Johari gave birth to the couple's first daughter, Camryn 
Drew Rollins.[92] An active philanthropist, Rollins and his wife Johari 
have participated in several charitable endeavors including the creation 
of The Johari & Jimmy Rollins Center for Animal Rehabilitation, which is 
located in Woolwich Township, New Jersey and provides several medical rehabilitation 
services for animals,[93] and an annual BaseBOWL charity bowling tournament 
to benefit the Arthritis Foundation.[94] Rollins is also active politically, 
and campaigned for Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election.[95] 
His second daughter, Logan Aliya, was born in early April 2014.[96] Rollins
