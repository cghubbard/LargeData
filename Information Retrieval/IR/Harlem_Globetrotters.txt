The Harlem Globetrotters are an exhibition basketball team that combines 
athleticism, theater, and comedy. Over the years they have played more 
than 26,000 exhibition games in 122 countries and territories. Brother 
Bones's whistled version of "Sweet Georgia Brown" is the team's signature 
song, and their mascot is named Globie. The team plays over 450 live events 
worldwide each year. The executive offices for the team are located in 
suburban Atlanta; in October 2013, Shamrock Holdings sold the team for 
an undisclosed amount of money to current owners Herschend Family Entertainment.[2] 
The genesis of the Globetrotters occurred on the south side of Chicago, 
Illinois, in the 1920s, where all the original players were raised. Most 
of these players also attended Wendell Phillips High School. The official 
history[3] contains several details which seem contradictory, such as the 
team being organized in 1926 in Chicago's Savoy Ballroom, which opened 
in 1927.[4] When the Savoy Ballroom opened in November 1927, one of the 
premier attractions was the Savoy Big Five, a basketball team that played 
exhibitions before dances. Hinckley, Illinois, was home to the first Harlem 
Globetrotters road game on January 7, 1927.[5] In 1928, several players 
left the team in a dispute over bringing back other players who had left 
the team. That fall, several players led by Tommy Brookins formed a team 
called the "Globe Trotters" that toured Southern Illinois that spring. 
Abe Saperstein became involved with the team as its manager and promoter. 
By 1929 Saperstein was touring Illinois and Iowa with his basketball team 
called the "New York Harlem Globe Trotters." Saperstein selected Harlem, 
New York City, New York, as their home city, since Harlem was considered 
the center of African-American culture at the time, and an out-of-town 
team name would give the team more of a mystique.[6] After four decades, 
the Globetrotters played their first game ever in Harlem in 1968. In 1959, 
the Globetrotters played nine games in Moscow after Saperstein received 
an invitation from Vasily Gricorevich, the director of Lenin Central Stadium.[7] 
The team, which included Wilt Chamberlain, was welcomed enthusiastically 
by spectators and authorities; they met Premier Nikita Khrushchev[8] and 
collectively received the Athletic Order of Lenin medal.[9] (However, according 
to one report, spectators were initially confused: "A Soviet audience of 
14,000 sat almost silently, as if in awe, through the first half of the 
game. It warmed up slightly in the second half when it realized the Trotters 
are more show than competition.")[10] The Globetrotters brought their own 
opponent—not the Washington Generals, but the San Francisco Chinese Basketeers.[7] 
A review in Pravda stated, "This is not basketball; it is too full of tricks" 
but praised the Globetrotters' skills and suggested that "they have some 
techniques to show us."[11] The American press—particularly Drew Pearson—made 
note of the fact that the Globetrotters were paid (per game) the equivalent 
of $4000, which could be spent only in Moscow. The games were used as evidence 
that U.S.–Soviet relations were improving, that Moscow was backing off 
its criticism of race relations inside America, and that the USSR was becoming 
more capitalist (Pearson suggested that the games were held because Lenin 
Stadium needed money).[12][13] In the 1900s the Globetrotters were very 
successful. The Globetrotters were perennial participants in the World 
Professional Basketball Tournament, winning it in 1940. Once one of the 
best teams in the country, the Globetrotters were eclipsed by the rise 
of the National Basketball Association, particularly when NBA teams began 
fielding African-American players in the 1950s.[14] Globetrotter Nat "Sweetwater" 
Clifton became the first African-American player to sign an NBA contract 
when the New York Knicks purchased his contract from the Globetrotters 
in 1950. The Globetrotters gradually worked comic routines into their act—a 
direction the team has credited to Reece "Goose" Tatum,[15] who joined 
in 1941—and eventually became known more for entertainment than sports.[16] 
The Globetrotters' acts often feature incredible coordination and skillful 
handling of one or more basketballs, such as passing or juggling balls 
between players, balancing or spinning balls on their fingertips, and making 
unusual, difficult shots.[17] Among the players who have been Globetrotters 
are NBA greats Wilt "The Stilt" Chamberlain, Connie "The Hawk" Hawkins, 
and Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton as well as Marques Haynes, Meadowlark Lemon, 
Sweet Lou Dunbar, Goose Tatum, and Hubert "Geese" Ausbie. Another popular 
team member in the 1970s and 1980s was Fred "Curly" Neal, who was the best 
dribbler of that era of the team's history and was immediately recognizable 
owing to his shaven head. Baseball Hall of Famers Ernie Banks, Bob Gibson 
and Ferguson Jenkins also played for the team at one time or another. In 
1985, the Globetrotters signed their first female player, Olympic gold 
medalist Lynette Woodard.[18] Because almost all of its players have been 
African American, and because of the buffoonery involved in many of the 
Globetrotters' skits, they drew some criticism in the Civil Rights era. 
The players were derisively accused by some civil-rights advocates of "Tomming 
for Abe", a reference to Uncle Tom and Jewish owner Abe Saperstein. However, 
prominent civil rights activist Jesse Jackson (who would later be named 
an Honorary Globetrotter) came to their defense by stating, I think they've 
been a positive influence... They did not show blacks as stupid. On the 
contrary, they were shown as superior.[14] In 1995, Orlando Antigua became 
the first Hispanic and the first nonblack on the Globetrotters' roster 
since Bob Karstens played with the squad in 1942–43.[19] Their first loss 
was to Hinckley on their first game 43 to 34. One of the original losses 
for the Globetrotters was to the Sheldon Orabs, who were led by William 
DeKraai in the 1940s. In January 1952, the Harlem Globetrotters lost to 
the Seattle University Chieftains (now Redhawks) in an upset, 84–81.[20] 
After a loss to the Washington Generals in 1962 alleged by Generals owner 
Red Klotz, the Harlem Globetrotters lost only three more games in the next 
50 years (5,983 games). Usually they played a team owned by Red Klotz, 
which also appeared as the Boston Shamrocks, New Jersey Reds, Baltimore 
Rockets, or Atlantic City Seagulls. On January 5, 1971, they lost in Martin, 
Tennessee, to the New Jersey Reds 100–99; that ended an alleged 2,495-game 
winning streak (which would mean that the Globetrotters were playing 277 
games per year up until that date). Another loss came against the Elmwood 
Yellow Jackets.[21] The Globetrotters ended up losing after three over-times 
36–34. In addition to their hundreds of exhibition games, the Globetrotters 
slowly returned to competitive basketball after 1993 under the new ownership 
of former player Mannie Jackson.[22] On September 12, 1995, they lost 91–85 
to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's All Star Team in Vienna, Austria, ending an alleged 
run of 8,829 straight victories going back to 1971. The 48-year-old Abdul-Jabbar 
scored 34 points. The 8,829 games in twenty-four years would mean the Globetrotters 
were playing nearly 368 games per year, or more than one game a day some 
days, for twenty-four years. This is because multiple team lineups tour 
as The Globetrotters to allow for a greater number of exhibitions.[23] 
The Globetrotters won the other 10 games during that European tour. Five 
years later, following another 1,270 wins, they lost 72 to 68 to Michigan 
State University, the reigning men's collegiate champions, on November 
13, 2000. On November 3, 2001, the Globetrotters had a streak of 284 consecutive 
victories snapped after suffering an 83–75 loss to Western Kentucky University 
[24]who went on to beat 4th ranked University of Kentucky 2 weeks later.[25] 
Two years later, they "set aside the hallmarks" for a "three-week, no-nonsense 
tour against college teams" from men's Division One. "There are no ballhandling 
displays to the tune of "Sweet Georgia Brown," no buckets of water or confetti 
thrown, and no Washington Generals to act as their inept foils." On November 
10 and 11 at Vanderbilt University and the University of Maryland,[26] 
another defending champion, they lost close games to both teams, their 
first consecutive defeats since 1961. Yet the tour probably marked a decade 
of improvement as a competitive team.[22] On November 3, 2003, the Globetrotters 
had a streak of 288 consecutive victories snapped after suffering an 89–88 
loss to the UTEP Miners, who had just six victories the season before. 
It was their only loss during an eight-game college tour wherein the Globetrotters 
had defeated Michigan State (97–83), UMass (77–68), and defending national 
champion Syracuse (83–70). On February 27, 2006, the Globetrotters extended 
their overall record to exactly 22,000 wins. Their most recent loss came 
on March 31, 2006, when they went down 87–83 to the NABC College All-Stars 
to bring their loss tally to just 345, giving them a winning percentage 
of .985. The Globetrotters won the World Professional Basketball Tournament 
once beating Chicago Bruins by 31-29. World Professional Basketball Tournament:

2007, the Globetrotters have conducted an annual "draft" a few days before 
the NBA draft, in which they select players they feel fit the mold of a 
Globetrotter. Being drafted by the Globetrotters does not guarantee a spot 
on the team, although several drafted players have gone on to become Globetrotters: 
Anthony "Ant" Atkinson (2007), Brent Petway (2007), William "Bull" Bullard 
(2008), Tay "Firefly" Fisher (2008), Charlie Coley III (2009), Paul "Tiny" 
Sturgess (2011), Jacob "Hops" Tucker (2011), Darnell "Spider" Wilks (2011), 
Bryan "B-Nice" Narcisse (2012), Tyrone Davis (2013), and Corey "Thunder" 
Law (2013). Other notable draft picks by the Globetrotters include: Sun 
Mingming (2007), Patrick Ewing, Jr. (2008), Sonny Weems (2008), Taylor 
Griffin (2009), Tim Howard (2009), Mark Titus (2010), Lionel Messi (2011), 
Andrew Goudelock (2011), Usain Bolt (2012), Mariano Rivera (2013), Brittney 
Griner (2013), Landon Donovan (2014), Mo'ne Davis (2015), Dude Perfect 
(2015), Neymar da Silva Santos Junior (2016), Missy Franklin (2016), Jordan 
Spieth (2016) and Craig Sager (2016) .[27][28][29] The Globetrotters have 
honored six players by retiring their numbers: Note: a. The first non-Globetrotter 
to have a number retired by the team was Red Klotz, the founder, owner 
and two-handed-set-shot artist for the Washington Generals, the long time 
Harlem Globetrotters' foils. He wore #3 as a player with the Generals, 
as well as during his standout collegiate and high school career in Philadelphia.[32][33] 
The Harlem Globetrotters have been featured in several of their own films 
and television series: Nine people have been officially named as honorary 
members of the team:[42] In addition, Magic Johnson (in 2003) was signed
