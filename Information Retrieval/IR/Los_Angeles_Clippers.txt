The Los Angeles Clippers are an American professional basketball team based 
in Los Angeles. The Clippers compete in the National Basketball Association 
(NBA) as a member club of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. 
The Clippers play their home games at the Staples Center, an arena shared 
with the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's 
National Basketball Association (WNBA), and the Los Angeles Kings of the 
National Hockey League (NHL). The franchise was founded in 1970 as the 
Buffalo Braves, one of three expansion teams to join the NBA that year. 
The Braves moved from Buffalo, New York to San Diego in 1978 and became 
known as the San Diego Clippers. In 1984, the Clippers moved to Los Angeles. 
Through much of its history, the franchise failed to see significant regular 
season or playoff success. The Clippers were frequently seen as an example 
of a perennial loser in American professional sports, drawing unfavorable 
comparisons to the historically successful Lakers, with whom they have 
shared a market since 1984 and an arena since 1999. The Clippers' fortunes 
turned in the early 2010s with the acquisition of core players Blake Griffin, 
DeAndre Jordan, and Chris Paul. In 2013, the franchise won its first division 
title, as the team made the playoffs for the ninth time in franchise history 
and the third time in the previous eight seasons. They also added to their 
budding rivalry with the Lakers, as they finished with a better record 
than the Lakers for the fifth time and won the season series for the second 
time since moving to Los Angeles in 1984, this time in a sweep. They repeated 
as division champions in 2014. The franchise began in Western New York 
as the Buffalo Braves, one of three NBA expansion franchises that began 
play in the 1970–71 season, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Cleveland 
Cavaliers.[6] They played their home games at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, 
along with another Buffalo team that would begin play that year, the National 
Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres.[7] After three bad seasons, the Braves' 
fortunes started to change under coach Jack Ramsay and star forward\center 
Bob McAdoo.[8] McAdoo led the NBA in scoring three consecutive seasons 
and was named the league's MVP in the 1974–75 season. The Braves qualified 
for the playoffs three times in a row, losing thrice to the eventual Eastern 
Conference champions (the Boston Celtics in 1974 and 1976, and the Washington 
Bullets in 1975). Despite the team's modest success in Buffalo, Braves 
owner Paul Snyder and the league found it impossible to schedule home games 
at the auditorium because the Canisius Golden Griffins men's basketball 
team, which had a pre-existing lease on the arena and priority on game 
dates over the Braves, saw the Braves as a threat to their own success 
and purposely scheduled all the best dates at the arena to prevent the 
Braves from succeeding. As a result, after a failed attempt to sell the 
team to an owner who intended to move it to South Florida, Snyder sold 
the team to Kentucky Colonels owner John Y. Brown, Jr., who decimated the 
team's roster, traded away all of its stars, and drove attendance down 
to the point where they could break their own lease on the arena.[9] Eventually 
in 1978, Brown dealt with Celtics owner Irv Levin so they would trade franchise 
ownerships. Southern California resident Levin then decided to move the 
Braves to San Diego, something the league would have never allowed him 
to do with the Celtics.[10] In 1978, San Diego welcomed the relocation 
of the Buffalo Braves franchise because the city had lost their Rockets 
to Houston seven years earlier. San Diego team officials did not think 
Braves was a representative nickname for the club. A contest decided on 
Clippers because the city was known for the great sailing ships that passed 
through San Diego Bay. When the Clippers moved to Los Angeles in 1984, 
they kept their nickname.[11] In the team's first season in San Diego, 
it posted a record of 43–39 under new head coach Gene Shue, leaving them 
two wins shy of the final playoff spot. It would be the Clippers' last 
winning season for 13 years. It was also in that first season in Southern 
California that long-time announcer Ralph Lawler began his association 
with the club. World B. Free, who was acquired in the offseason from the 
Philadelphia 76ers, finished second overall in NBA scoring average, with 
28.9 per game, while George Gervin of the San Antonio Spurs had a 29.6 
average. The 1979–80 season saw the Clippers begin to struggle despite 
adding center Bill Walton, a San Diego native who was two years removed 
from an NBA Championship with the Trail Blazers. Walton missed 68 games 
due to foot injuries (which he also suffered in his final years in Portland). 
San Diego finished 35–47 as key players missed games due to injuries. Free 
again finishing second in league scoring, with 30.2 PPG. Paul Silas replaced 
Shue the following season, and the Clippers finished 36–46, again missing 
the postseason. Walton missed the entire season again due to foot injuries. 
Free was traded to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for guard Phil 
Smith. The 1981–82 season brought changes to the franchise as Irv Levin 
sold the team to Los Angeles-area real estate developer and attorney Donald 
Sterling for US$12.5 million. The Clippers' poor play in the final years 
in San Diego resulted in averaging only 4,500 fans a game. Sterling lobbied 
the NBA to relocate the team to his native Los Angeles. In 1984, the Clippers 
moved north to Los Angeles, playing at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports 
Arena. However, the move was not approved by the NBA, which fined Sterling 
$25 million. He sued the league for $100 million, but dropped the suit 
when the league agreed to decrease the fine to $6 million.[12] The Clippers 
finished their first season in Los Angeles 31–51 under head coach Jim Lynam. 
The Clippers' early days in Los Angeles were marred with many seasons of 
hapless performances. Despite fielding a squad of talented veterans, the 
organization suffered systematic injuries to many of its star players. 
The phenomenon was dubbed the "Clipper Triangle" by some sports writers.[13] 
Derek Smith suffered a knee injury during the 1985–86 season, followed 
by Norm Nixon (knee) and Marques Johnson (spinal cord) the following season.[13] 
One of the team's low points was its 12–70 finish in 1987 season that was 
the second-worst single-season record in NBA history at that time (and 
is now the third-worst winning percentage in NBA history behind the 1973 
Philadelphia 76ers and the 2012 Charlotte Bobcats). That same season also 
saw Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor join the team as the General Manager and 
Vice President of basketball operations. Nixon was plagued with another 
ailment, this time suffering an ailing Achilles tendon in 1987–88, while 
number one draft pick rookie Danny Manning injured his anterior cruciate 
during the 1988–89 campaign.[13] Things began to appear promising at the 
start of the 1989–90 season shortly after the Clippers traded the rights 
of the recently drafted Danny Ferry and Reggie Williams for the high scoring 
shooting guard Ron Harper. Los Angeles thrived with a 19–19 record nearly 
halfway into the season, prompting many to seriously consider the team 
as a possible playoff contender.[13] That move, along with the 1987 NBA 
draft of Ken Norman, the 1988 draftings of Danny Manning and Charles Smith 
(Smith was acquired from Philadelphia in exchange for the draft rights 
to Hersey Hawkins), and the 1990 NBA draft of Loy Vaught, formed a nucleus 
that made the franchise a playoff contender. Midway through the 1991–92 
season, the Clippers made yet another coaching change. Larry Brown, recently 
fired by the San Antonio Spurs, was hired as the team's head coach in late 
January 1992. He replaced Mike Schuler, who had led the team to a 22–25 
record before his firing. Brown finished the season with a 23–12 mark, 
for a 45–37 overall—the franchise's first winning season in 13 years. For 
the first time since moving to Los Angeles, they finished with a better 
record than the crosstown Los Angeles Lakers. The Clippers advanced to 
the playoffs for the first time in 16 years (since the franchise's Buffalo 
heyday), but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the 
Utah Jazz, 3–2. Due to the late April 1992 Los Angeles riots, the Anaheim 
Convention Center was the site of Game 4 of the series, which the Clippers 
won. The team made the playoffs again in the 1992–93 season with a 41–41 
record, but lost again in five games in the first round, this time to the 
Rockets. Brown left to become the Indiana Pacers' head coach after the 
season and Bob Weiss was brought in to replace him. That 1993–94 season 
proved to be one of the worst in Los Angeles NBA history, with the Clippers 
and Lakers going a combined 60–104. In February 1994, the Clippers traded 
Manning to the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins. Wilkins played 25 games 
for the club, averaging 29.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 37.9 
minutes per game. After one year on the job, Weiss was fired, and veteran 
head coach Bill Fitch was brought in to guide a roster of young and inexperienced 
players. From 1994 to 1999, the Clippers played several games annually 
(usually five to eight regular season games a season, plus an annual preseason 
game) at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, sharing the venue with the NHL's 
Ducks and the Splash indoor soccer team. Clipper games regularly drew a 
much-higher average attendance per game at the Pond than when the team 
played its home games at their regular venue, the Los Angeles Sports Arena; 
the Anaheim games proved so popular that many Clippers players and much 
of the fanbase, as well as the NBA, wanted to the team to stay in what 
was considered at the time a state-of-the-art arena. For instance, between 
1994 and 1997, the Clippers drew an average of nearly 16,000 fans per game 
at the Pond, while in Los Angeles, they drew in the neighborhood of 9,200 
per home game.[14] Anaheim officials and the Clippers had have on-going 
talks about moving to Anaheim full-time even years before the Pond was 
eventually built,[15] as Donald Sterling was pursuing options to play elsewhere 
in the Los Angeles metropolitan region if there was not a replacement for 
the Sports Arena being built. The Clippers, however, nearly moved to Anaheim 
permanently in time for the 1996–97 season, but according to a Los Angeles 
Times article published from June 1996,[16] owner Donald Sterling turned 
down a deal that would have paid the team $95 million over 12 years. Odgen 
Corporation, who at the time managed the Pond, and the city of Anaheim 
offered the Clippers a multi-tiered deal that would have included upwards 
of $33 million paid to the team over the first six years of their Pond 
agreement, plus other monies allocated towards new locker rooms, team offices, 
and a practice facility. In another related Times article,[17] Odgen and 
Sterling were in talks to have the management company take care of the 
Clippers' day-to-day operations for a $4 million a year fee. Also at the 
time, the Walt Disney Company, owners of the Ducks and Anaheim Angels baseball 
team during this time period were pursuing at least a partial ownership 
of the Clippers, with the key element being that its game telecasts would 
be part of a planned ESPN regional network for Southern California. However, 
as the planned ESPN West network never came to reality, all three teams 
had continue to maintain broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West and 
Prime Ticket. In what suppose to be a counter move, the Coliseum Commission, 
the management entity that managed the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena 
and Coliseum, had planned to build a new 18,700-seat arena in the parking 
lot next to the Sports Arena that would have cost up to $94 million, that 
would have included 1,100 club seats, 84 luxury suites, and an on-site 
practice facility for the Clippers. However, those plans were scuttled 
once planning for Staples Center (directly two miles up the street from 
the Sports Arena) were taking place, and the Clippers deciding to become 
a tenant at Staples. In 1999, the Clippers joined the Lakers and Los Angeles 
Kings in the new Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles.[18] In sharing 
the building with other tenants, such as the highly popular Lakers, the 
Clippers, with relatively low success, were often overshadowed. Also, because 
of the terms of its leasing agreement with Staples Center, the Kings and 
Lakers had scheduling priority over the Clippers, with the Clippers taking 
whatever dates that were available, including scheduling same-day Clipper-Laker 
and Clipper-King doubleheaders (as it continues to this day). However, 
in the years since, the Clippers' scheduling at Staples Center became gradually 
more favorable (especially given the popularity of the team in recent years) 
in their lease renewals in 2004 and 2013, with the team receiving increased 
profits, including more of a share of luxury suite and concession revenue. 
Since February 2011, the Clippers have sold-out every regular season and 
post-season home game, behind the popularity of stars Blake Griffin, DeAndre 
Jordan, and Chris Paul. On the court, the Clippers continued to make frequent 
roster changes throughout this particular period, which only resulted with 
one playoff appearance under Bill Fitch. Along with Loy Vaught, a collection 
of young players (including Lamond Murray, Eric Piatkowski, and Lorenzen 
Wright), and journeyman veterans (among them Pooh Richardson, Tony Massenburg, 
Rodney Rogers, Darrick Martin, and Brian Williams), the Fitch-coached teams 
during this particular era struggled mightily although they did make the 
playoffs once during this time. The 1996–97 team made the playoffs with 
a losing record (36–46) and were swept in the first round by the eventual 
Western Conference Champion Utah Jazz, three games to none. Four members 
of the 1996–97 squad are now deceased. Malik Sealy died in a car accident 
in 2000, Kevin Duckworth died of heart disease in 2008; Lorenzen Wright 
went missing and was murdered in 2010, and Dwayne Schintzius died from 
cancer complications in 2012. Two other players from the Fitch era suffered 
tragic circumstances of their own; Brian Williams (who played for the Clippers 
during the 1995–96 season, and later became known as Bison Dele) was believed 
to be murdered by his brother while the two were vacationing in 2002 while 
in the South Pacific, and Rodney Rogers became paralyzed after a dirt bike 
crash in 2008 in his native North Carolina. For all intents and purposes, 
the Clippers' 1997–98 season ended in December when Vaught, the team's 
leading scorer for the past three seasons, had season-ending back surgery. 
Without Vaught, the Clippers were a rudderless team, and finished 17–65, 
the third-worst record in the league. Fitch was fired after the 1997–98 
season (and later had to sue the team to recover the remaining money on 
his contract), and was replaced by one of his proteges, former Celtics 
and Bucks coach, Chris Ford. Meanwhile, Vaught's career as a Clipper was 
effectively finished, as he left as a free agent after that season, and 
signed with the Detroit Pistons; at the time of his departure, he became 
the franchise's all-time rebounds leader with 4,471 (a number that was 
later surpassed by Elton Brand, with 4,710).[19] The Clippers won the first 
overall pick in the 1998 Draft Lottery and selected center Michael Olowokandi 
from University of the Pacific. The team went on a 0–17 start and finished 
with a 9–41 record in the shortened 1998–99 season. They were led by second-year 
forward Maurice Taylor, who averaged 16.8 points per game. It was in that 
first season at Staples Center that they drafted highly touted Lamar Odom. 
They hired former All-Star (and Los Angeles native) Dennis Johnson as an 
assistant coach, as well as Hall of Fame former Laker great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
to help tutor second-year center Michael Olowokandi. Johnson remained an 
assistant coach until the middle of the 2002–03 season, when he took over 
as head coach. Abdul-Jabbar remained only one season. During the 1999 offseason, 
Rodney Rogers signed with the Phoenix Suns. The Clippers also sent Lamond 
Murray to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman. 
However, Newman was traded to the New Jersey Nets for Eric Murdock a month 
later without ever playing a game for the Clippers. The team finished with 
the worst record in the league (15–67) in the 1999–00 season, while the 
Lakers had the best record that year (67–15). The 2000–01 season brought 
changes. Derek Strong was sent to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Corey 
Maggette and the draft rights to Keyon Dooling. The Clippers' two draft 
picks that year were childhood friends from Illinois: high schooler Darius 
Miles (3rd overall pick) and Quentin Richardson, (18th overall pick). The 
team became popular among fans with its high-flying style of basketball 
and the Clippers did improve a bit with a 31–51 record, leading the NBA 
in bench-scoring with 37 points per game. To improve upon the previous 
season, the Clippers acquired high-scoring and rebounding power forward 
Elton Brand from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to 
Tyson Chandler. Brand earned a spot on the 2002 NBA Western Conference 
All-Star team as an injury replacement for Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers. 
The Clippers contended for most of the season, but won only 3 of the last 
12 games and finished 39–43, five games out of the playoffs. The 2002 offseason 
brought changes, as Miles was traded to the Cavaliers for Andre Miller, 
who led the NBA in assists in 2001–02 with 11 per game. With a good point 
guard in Miller, Lamar Odom at small forward, one of the league's best 
power forwards, Brand, the center Olowokandi, and a good supporting cast 
off the bench, the Clippers could actually make a run for the playoffs. 
However, with poor team chemistry and injuries (the Clippers lost 293 man-games 
to injury), they finished with a disappointing 27–55 record. Head coach 
Alvin Gentry was replaced by Dennis Johnson midway through the 2002–03 
season. In the 2003–04 season, the Clippers lost many of their core players 
to free agency (Miller, Odom, Olowokandi, and forward Eric Piatkowski—one 
of the longest-tenured players in Clippers history[20]), while opting to 
retain Brand and Maggette with long-term contracts. They, along with Richardson, 
made up one of the NBA best high-scoring trios, with a combined 58 points 
per game. With new head coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr., they finished 28–54, 
due to inexperience and injuries. The 2004–05 season saw the Clippers, 
although also missed the playoffs, finished with a better record than the 
Lakers for the first time since 1993. Bobby Simmons won the 2004–05 NBA 
Most Improved Player award after averaging 16 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 
assists per game. As a result, Simmons signed a 5-year, $47 million deal 
with the Milwaukee Bucks. To counter Simmons' defection, the Clippers announced 
they would sign Cuttino Mobley to a contract similar in years (5) but less 
money ($42 million) to what Simmons received. Mobley was the first significant 
free agent signing from outside the organization since Bill Walton in the 
late 1970s. More deals were made. The Clippers traded Marko Jarić (in a 
sign and trade transaction) and Lionel Chalmers to the Minnesota Timberwolves 
in exchange for Sam Cassell and a lottery-protected 1st round pick in the 
2006 NBA draft. In relation to the lottery-protected pick, in order for 
the Clippers to acquire the pick, the Timberwolves would have to make the 
playoffs, or Minnesota would retain the pick. During the summer of 2005, 
the Clippers announced they would build a state-of-the-art practice facility 
(the first NBA practice facility within the four corners of the City of 
Los Angeles) in the Playa Vista development. Several current players on 
the Clippers' lineup live in the planned community.[21] The 2005–06 season 
was a turning point for the team's image; marked by several wins over top 
teams. Brand was chosen for the All-Star Game and articles have been written 
in sports magazines giving recognition to the much improved team.[citation 
needed] Just before the trade deadline, the Clippers traded Chris Wilcox 
to the Seattle SuperSonics for Vladimir Radmanović. They had lacked consistent 
outside shooting, which is what they looked for in the trade. While the 
Clippers had a few stretches of poor play they were able to maintain a 
solid record, including posting several winning streaks. They achieved 
their first winning record in 14 seasons and clinched their first playoff 
spot since 1997. They also finished with a better record than the Lakers 
for the second straight year. By finishing sixth in the Western Conference, 
with a record of 47–35 (their highest finish since the team left Buffalo), 
they benefited from the current NBA playoff format of regular season records 
taking precedence over winning the division, and secured home court advantage 
over the Denver Nuggets instead of traveling to Denver for four games as 
a No. 6 seed would usually be expected to do. On April 22, 2006, the Clippers 
won their first NBA playoff game in 13 years. Two days later, they won 
their second playoff game, going 2–0 against an opponent for the first 
time in franchise history. They lost Game 3, but won Game 4. On Monday, 
May 1, 2006, they won Game 5 in Los Angeles and their first playoff series 
since they moved from Buffalo. The team faced the Phoenix Suns in the Western 
Conference Semi-finals. After losing a close Game 1, they won Game 2, 122–97. 
The series shifted to Staples Center for Game 3, but the Suns won, 94–91. 
In Game 4, Elton Brand posted 30 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists 
as the Clippers evened the series. In Game 5, Suns guard/forward Raja Bell 
made a key 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left in the first overtime to send 
the game into a second overtime. However, Phoenix won in double-overtime, 
125–118. They bounced back with a series-saving 118–106 Game 6 win. Second-year 
defensive specialist Quinton Ross had a timely offensive game, scoring 
a then career-high 18 points. Brand had 30 points (his scoring average 
in this particular series), 12 rebounds, and five blocks. Corey Maggette 
came off the bench to score 25 points, with 7–8 shooting from the field, 
and 9–9 from the free throw line. Kaman and Cassell each scored 15 points. 
The Clippers lost the seventh game 127–107. General Manager (and Naismith 
Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member) Elgin Baylor won the NBA Executive 
of the Year award for leading the Clippers to the playoffs. The 2006 off-season 
started as the team drafted Paul Davis in the second round of the 2006 
NBA draft, as the 34th overall pick. The pick was acquired by the Clippers 
by way of a 2004 trade for Melvin Ely. The team also drafted Guillermo 
Diaz as the 52nd overall pick. While Davis signed with the team, Diaz decided 
to play overseas. However, the team still holds his draft rights. Meanwhile, 
in free agency they signed Tim Thomas away from divisional Phoenix, in 
a four-year, $24 million deal. That was to counter the defection of Vladimir 
Radmanović to the Lakers in a similar deal, except Radmanovic signed for 
an extra year, but both players would make the same amount of money annually, 
which would be $6 million. Also Sam Cassell (widely credited as the biggest 
reason for the Clippers' recent success) signed a two-year, $13 million 
deal. Cassell stated that once he retired he would like to join the Clippers' 
coaching staff under Mike Dunleavy, Sr. Also the team signed veteran Aaron 
Williams to an undisclosed deal. In September, the Clippers announced a 
radio broadcast deal with KSPN-AM, the local ESPN Radio-operated outlet. 
The team did not perform to expectations, compared to the previous season. 
A lot of this had been attributed to lack of team chemistry and injuries 
to several key players, including Cassell, Thomas, Livingston, and Kaman. 
Players such as Luke Jackson, Alvin Williams, and Doug Christie were signed 
to 10-day contracts to help solidify the team's bench. Adding to the disappointment 
of the 2006–07 season, Shaun Livingston suffered a dislocated left knee 
in which he tore every ligament in his knee. This was one of the most devastating 
injuries that season that left him a player that would never be the same.[22] 
The extent of the injury was so severe, local news outlets such as KCBS-TV/KCAL-TV 
and KNBC-TV elected not to air the clip of the injury. According to the 
team's lead physician, Dr. Tony Daly, Livingston's prognosis for him to 
return to basketball activity was eight months (which was around the first 
week of the upcoming season) to a full calendar year.[23] The Clippers, 
expected by many to make the playoffs after their surprise appearance the 
season before, finished the season 40–42, 2 games behind the 8th-seed. 
The Lakers finished with a better record for the first time since the 2003–04 
NBA season. The Clippers received the 14th draft pick from the NBA lottery. 
They selected Al Thornton and Jared Jordan. The 2007–08 season started 
off on a negative note, with Brand on the disabled list because of a ruptured 
left Achilles tendon, and Livingston still out. Brand missed most of the 
season, and they struggled to stay competitive. Chris Kaman took advantage 
of a depleted roster by averaging 15.7 points and 12.7 rebounds per game, 
but was limited to playing 56 games due to various injuries. The Clippers 
ended the season 23–59. They saw the departure of several players for the 
2008–09 season, including Brand and Maggette, and acquired ten players. 
Brand's departure stunned everyone, because he had stated that he loved 
playing for Los Angeles and wanted to stay, but negotiations for a new 
contract fell apart and he accepted a huge deal from the Philadelphia 76ers. 
Baron Davis, a Los Angeles native and formerly of the Golden State Warriors, 
signed a five-year contract with the Clippers, worth an estimated $65 million.[24] 
After a disappointing 2007–08 season, the Clippers obtained the 7th pick 
in the 2008 NBA draft, and selected Eric Gordon.[25] They also selected 
DeAndre Jordan (35th overall pick). Mike Taylor (55th overall pick), was 
acquired from the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for a future second-round 
pick. Also in July, they acquired Marcus Camby from the Denver Nuggets 
in return for a $10 million trade exception and the choice to exchange 
second round picks with the Clippers in 2010.[26] On July 23, the Clippers 
also acquired guard Jason Hart from the Utah Jazz in exchange for guard 
Brevin Knight.[27] On July 28, they signed Ricky Davis to a one-year deal, 
with a player option for a second year.[28] They continued an active offseason, 
signing former Clipper Brian Skinner in July, and traded for Steve Novak 
in August for future second-round pick considerations, in a deal similar 
to the Camby trade. In August, the team signed Jason Williams to a one-year 
deal.[29] The Clippers re-signed Paul Davis. They signed three Davises 
(Baron, Ricky, and Paul) in their "rebuilding offseason" in which they 
obtained key players such as Baron Davis, Marcus Camby, Ricky Davis, and 
Williams. However, just prior to the start of training camp, in September, 
Williams announced his retirement. In October, according to reports from 
various sources including the Los Angeles Times,[30][31] Orange County 
Register,[32] and the team's own web site (Clippers.com), Elgin Baylor 
ended his 22-year reign as Vice President and General Manager of basketball 
operations. It was one of the longest tenures in professional sports history. 
The Clippers indicated that Baylor had retired from his post,[33] and as 
a result, head coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr. assumed the role of General Manager, 
while director of player personnel Neil Olshey was promoted to assistant 
general manager. In many of those reports, including a related article 
in the October 8 edition of the Times,[34] it was also indicated that Baylor 
had either been fired, resigned, or retired, depending on the source. According 
to similar reports, Baylor had been offered a different position in the 
organization, with the same salary, but with little to no decision-making 
power; Baylor refused. In fact, when pressed about his status with the 
franchise, Baylor had been advised by his attorneys not to say anything, 
indicating that the team and Baylor are in negotiations to work out a settlement 
agreement based on his departure. According to the above-mentioned article, 
Baylor had been working without a formal contract since the early 1990s. 
On November 21, 2008, the Clippers and New York Knicks completed a trade, 
in which Los Angeles sent Tim Thomas and Cuttino Mobley to New York, in 
exchange for Zach Randolph and Mardy Collins.[35] With the trade of Mobley, 
only one member of their 2005–06 playoff team remained on the roster, Chris 
Kaman. In December, Mobley announced his retirement due to a heart condition 
known as Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy discovered during his physical; although 
he never played a game for the Knicks, they completed the trade anyway 
for salary cap reasons. On January 6, 2009, the Clippers waived Fred Jones 
and Paul Davis to open a roster spot for a center from Senegal Cheikh Samb[36] 
(the Clippers have since re-signed Jones). The Clippers ended the 2008–09 
season  14th in the Western Conference with a record of 19–63.[37] In May 
2009, the Clippers won the first overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft and 
selected Blake Griffin. To clear a spot in the lineup for him, they traded 
Zach Randolph to Memphis for Quentin Richardson. Richardson was then traded 
to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Sebastian Telfair, Craig Smith, and Mark 
Madsen.[38] Griffin immediately impressed in training camp and preseason. 
On October 23, he broke his kneecap during the Clippers' final exhibition 
game against the New Orleans Hornets, following a dunk. Initially, the 
Clippers' stated that he only had a sore left knee, which would make him 
questionable for the season opener the following night, before they revealed 
the break. The injury sidelined Griffin for the entire season.[39] On February 
4, 2010, head coach Mike Dunleavy resigned, and Kim Hughes was named interim 
coach.[40] Dunleavy retained his front-office title and duties for just 
over a month, but on March 10 he was fired as General Manager, being replaced 
by Neil Olshey. Dunleavy received the news of his dismissal from the internet, 
as well as friends and reporters calling his cell phone.[41] The Los Angeles 
Times reported that Dunleavy had filed for arbitration and that the Clippers 
had cut off his salary, even though his guaranteed contract did not end 
until after the 2010–2011 season.[42] Although the Clippers saw minor improvement, 
finishing with ten more wins at 29–53, Hughes was fired as head coach at 
the end of the season. In July, former Chicago Bulls coach Vinny Del Negro 
was hired as the next head coach.[43] In August, the team introduced new 
uniform designs at a photo shoot, at the team's practice facility. Griffin 
and DeAndre Jordan modeled the new uniforms, which were re-designed for 
the first time since the 2000–01 season.[44] The Clippers' primary and 
secondary logos, which are modifications of the previous ones, were introduced 
to the public weeks earlier, on the night of the 2010 NBA draft. With Eric 
Gordon, Chris Kaman, an improved DeAndre Jordan, a re-energized Baron Davis, 
and the debut of No. 1 pick Blake Griffin, the Clippers had high hopes 
for the season. However, they started slowly, losing ten of the first 11 
games with Davis and Kaman out with injuries. However, the Clippers showed 
strength when three of their first four wins came from the top teams in 
the Western Conference. Griffin got off to a strong start, drawing increased 
media attention in Clippers games and boosting ratings of local broadcasts 
of Clippers games.[45] Griffin was chosen as a Western Conference Reserve 
in the 2011 NBA All-Star Game, a rare honor for a rookie, the first chosen 
by the coaches for the game since Tim Duncan in 1997. He also won the NBA 
Sprite Slam Dunk Contest. As the trade deadline approached, the Clippers 
sent Baron Davis along with their 2011 first round draft pick to the Cleveland 
Cavaliers for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon. The first pick they gave turned 
out to be first overall, Kyrie Irving. In December 2011, the Clippers signed 
Caron Butler to a $24 million deal and claimed veteran point guard Chauncey 
Billups three days later. On December 14, 2011, they traded Eric Gordon, 
Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu and Minnesota's 2012 first-round pick acquired 
in 2005 for New Orleans Hornets' four-time all-star Chris Paul. Paul had 
previously almost been traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, but NBA commissioner 
David Stern had vetoed the trade. Paul and Griffin were selected as starters 
for the Western Conference team in the 2012 NBA All-Star Game, the first 
time in franchise history the team had two All-Star starters in the same 
year. The team gained the nickname "Lob City" due to a comment made by 
Griffin during the Clippers Media Day when the announcement of Chris Paul's 
trade reached the team. Griffin, after being told the news by close friend 
DeAndre Jordan, declared, "Yeah! It's going to be lob city!"[46] In February 
2012, the Clippers signed Kenyon Martin. An 11-year NBA veteran and former 
NBA All-Star (2004), Martin joined the Clippers after signing with the 
Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association the 
previous summer. On February 6, 2012, during a game against the Orlando 
Magic, Billups tore his Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the 
season. In March 2012, Nick Young joined the Clippers as part of a three-team 
trade with the Washington Wizards and the Denver Nuggets. He became the 
eighth player to debut in the 2011–2012 season. After a stretch that saw 
the Clippers lose 12 of 19 games after Billups's season-ending injury, 
with rumors of Vinny Del Negro's career as head coach of the Clippers possibly 
coming to an abrupt end, Los Angeles went on a tear.[47] The Clippers won 
12 of their next 14 games, including road wins over the defending champion 
Dallas Mavericks and the Western-Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder, 
clinching their fifth playoff berth since their 1976 conference semi-finals 
loss to the Boston Celtics (the last time they made the playoffs as the 
Buffalo Braves) before a dominating home win over the Oklahoma City Thunder 
on April 16, 2012. It was their third win in four regular-season games 
against the Thunder. Chris Paul's push for the NBA Most Valuable Player 
Award was at its peak. The 2011–2012 NBA season was the first time the 
Clippers were in the playoffs since 2005–2006. In their first playoff game, 
the Clippers rallied from a 27-point deficit against the Grizzlies to win 
99–98 in one of the biggest rallies in playoff history. They led the series 
3–1, then lost two straight, before coming back to win Game 7 in Memphis 
82–72, becoming the 6th NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading series 
3–1, and prevail to the second round. The Clippers relied on their bench 
during that game, and they came through, scoring all but two of their points 
in the fourth quarter. In the second round of the playoffs, the team was 
swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[48] On June 4, 2012, GM Neil Olshey reached 
an agreement to become General Manager of the Portland Trail Blazers.[49] 
Olshey was replaced as Clippers GM by Gary Sacks. On draft night of 2012, 
the team re-acquired forward Lamar Odom from the Dallas Mavericks as part 
of a four-team deal that also sent Mo Williams and Furkan Aldemir, their 
2012 draftee, to the Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets respectively. On July 
11, 2012, the Clippers sent Reggie Evans to the Brooklyn Nets for the right 
to swap second-round draft picks with the Nets in the 2016 NBA draft.[50] 
On the same day, the Clippers signed free agent Jamal Crawford, formerly 
of the Portland Trail Blazers. Two days later, the Clippers re-signed Billups 
to a one-year deal. On July 17, 2012, the Clippers agreed to a deal with 
Grant Hill and then Ryan Hollins two days later. On July 27, 2012, the 
Clippers signed ex-Heat center Ronny Turiaf. To cap off their off-season 
moves, they traded away draft rights for Hawks' shooting guard Willie Green. 
On September 14, 2012, the Clippers signed Matt Barnes to a one-year deal. 
On November 29, 2012, public address (PA) announcer David Courtney died 
in a hospital in Los Angeles for reasons not yet revealed. He was replaced 
by former Clippers and current Los Angeles Dodgers PA announcer Eric Smith. 
On December 15, 2012, with a 111–85 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, the 
Clippers recorded their record ninth consecutive win, breaking their previous 
franchise record (in Los Angeles) of eight wins set in the 1991–92 season.[51] 
On December 21, 2012, with a 97–85 win over the Sacramento Kings, they 
notched their twelfth consecutive victory, breaking their previous 11-game 
streak as the Buffalo Braves in the 1974–75 season.[52] On December 30, 
2012, the Clippers recorded their 17th straight win against the Utah Jazz, 
beating them 107–96. The win also made the Clippers the third team in NBA 
history to record an undefeated month ending the month of December 16–0. 
Their streak ended when they lost to the Denver Nuggets on January 2, 2013. 
They ended the streak with a franchise record of 17 wins. On January 9, 
2013, with a 99–93 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the Clippers recorded 
another franchise record with their 13th straight home victory [53] On 
January 12, 2013, the Clippers 13 game home win streak came to an end with 
a 104–101 loss to the Orlando Magic.[54] A 126–101 victory over the Phoenix 
Suns saw the Clippers reach the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise 
history, breaking their previous mark of 49 from 1975–76 when they were 
in Buffalo.[55] On April 7, 2013, with a 109–95 victory over the Lakers, 
they swept the LA season series and clinched the first division title in 
franchise history.[56] They would finish the season with a 56–26 record. 
The Clippers entered the 2013 NBA Playoffs as the 4th seed to once again 
face the 5th seeded Memphis Grizzlies. The Clippers would go up 2–0 early 
in the series after a buzzer beater by Chris Paul in game 2. After being 
up 2–0 in the series, the Clippers would lose 4 games in a row to be eliminated 
the first round. On May 21, 2013, the team declined to renew Vinny Del 
Negro's contract as head coach. On June 24, 2013, the NBA approved a trade 
of Doc Rivers, from the Boston Celtics to the Los Angeles Clippers for 
an unprotected 2015 NBA first round draft pick.[57] A day later, on June 
25, 2013, Glenn "Doc" Rivers, a former Clippers player best known for his 
nine-year tenure as the head coach of the Boston Celtics, was announced 
as Del Negro's replacement. As compensation for Boston allowing Rivers 
to leave his contract with the Celtics and join the Clippers, Los Angeles 
traded two future first-round draft picks, in addition to an anti-trade 
clause preventing the Clippers and Celtics from engaging in further transactions 
amongst each other, including the exchanging of players, for the duration 
of the 2013–14 season.[58][59][60] On July 3, 2013, the Clippers traded 
Eric Bledsoe and Caron Butler to the Phoenix Suns for Jared Dudley and 
J.J Redick (from the Bucks). The Clippers and Suns also sent two 2nd round 
draft picks to the Milwaukee Bucks. On July 7, 2013, the team resigned 
Matt Barnes, Chris Paul and Ryan Hollins. Paul's deal was for 5 years, 
worth around $105.3 million. The team also signed Darren Collison to fill 
the back-up point guard role, replacing the departed Eric Bledsoe and free 
agent Chauncey Billups, who signed with the Detroit Pistons. On August 
28, 2013, the Clippers signed free agent power forward Antawn Jamison to 
a one-year deal worth the veteran minimum, appeared only 22 games and eventually 
traded to Atlanta Hawks on February 20, 2014 in exchange for the draft 
rights to Cenk Akyol. On December 19, 2013, the Clippers signed free agent 
small forward Stephen Jackson appeared only nine games with the team, and 
eventually waived on January 7, 2014. On January 16, 2014, the Clippers 
signed free agent small forward Hedo Türkoğlu for the remainder of 2013–2014 
season. On February 24, 2014, the Clippers signed free agent power forward 
Glen Davis. On February 28, 2014, the Clippers signed free agent small 
forward Danny Granger. On March 6, 2014, the Clippers defeated their crosstown 
rival the Los Angeles Lakers by 48 points 142–94, the most lopsided victory 
ever for the Clippers' franchise and the most one-sided loss in Lakers 
history. On April 15, 2014, the Clippers broke the franchise record of 
wins with 57. In the playoffs, they defeated the Warriors in seven games 
before falling to the Thunder in six games in the second round. On April 
25, 2014, entertainment news website TMZ released a taped conversation 
in which team owner Donald Sterling – who had a history of accusations 
of racist behavior against African Americans and Latinos dating back to 
the 1990s – reprimanded V. Stiviano (born Maria Vanessa Perez and of African 
American and Mexican heritage, who had reportedly been dating Sterling 
while he was estranged from wife Rochelle Stein) after posting an Instagram 
photo featuring her, former Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson 
and another woman. Sterling stated that it bothered him that she had "broadcast 
that [she is] associating with black people", and that he did not want 
Stiviano to bring them to the team's games.[61] The remarks in the tape 
caused public backlash (including condemnations from many current and former 
NBA players such as Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Charles Barkley, 
Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant); several sponsors also 
severed ties with the team, among them Kia Motors (for whom Blake Griffin 
serves as its television spokesperson), State Farm Insurance and Virgin 
America.[62] Threats of boycotts against the Clippers were also considered, 
with the team itself briefly contemplating one of the April 27 playoff 
game against the Golden State Warriors (the fourth game in the team's first 
round playoff series) – players opted to protest Sterling's remarks by 
wearing their shirts inside-out, obscuring team logos.[63][64] On April 
29, 2014, the NBA issued Sterling a lifetime ban from the organization 
after a league investigation into the recording confirmed that he was the 
one conversing with Stiviano. The league also issued a $2.5 million fine 
against Sterling (the highest allowable by the NBA) and barred him from 
attending games or practices involving any NBA team; being present in any 
Clippers office or facility; and from participating in any team business, 
player personnel decisions or league activity. NBA commissioner Adam Silver 
stated in a press conference regarding the decision that he will try to 
force Sterling to sell the Clippers, which would require the consent of 
¾ of the league's 29 other team owners.[65] Silver later announced that 
the NBA would appoint a CEO to run the team.[66] Before the ban was handed 
down, Sterling said in a phone conversation with Fox News contributor Jim 
Gray that he had no plans to sell the team.[67] On May 9, 2014, the NBA 
named former Citigroup chairman and former Time Warner chairman and CEO 
Richard Parsons the interim CEO of the team.[68] On May 27, 2014, Steve 
Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, agreed to purchase the team for $2 billion 
– 4 times the expected purchase/evaluated price.[69][70] To buy the team, 
Ballmer reportedly beat out other candidates including Oprah Winfrey, Floyd 
Mayweather, Magic Johnson, and a group of crowdfunders.[71][72] Although 
Ballmer lives in the Seattle area and had been part of an ownership group 
that had unsuccessfully attempted to move the Sacramento Kings to that 
city, he has indicated that he has no intention of moving the Clippers.[73] 
On August 12, 2014, Ballmer officially took control of the team following 
an order by a California court that confirmed the sale from Shelly Sterling 
to Ballmer. As part of the deal Shelly Sterling gets the titles of "Owner 
Emeritus" and "Clippers' Number 1 Fan", as well as ten tickets in sections 
101 or 111 for all Clippers games, two courtside tickets for all games 
in Los Angeles, six parking spots in Lot C for each game, 12 VIP passes 
that include access to the Lexus Club, Arena Club, or Chairman's Lounge 
and Media room or equivalent, for each Staples games, three championship 
rings following any Clippers title, and will run a yet to be named charitable 
foundation.[5][74][75][76] The deal also included a stipulation that Steve 
Ballmer would keep the Clippers in Los Angeles, implying that they would 
not be relocated.[77] On November 6, 2014, the team hired its first major 
female executive as former Auto Club Speedway president Gillian Zucker 
was hired as the Clippers' president of business operations.[78] Currently, 
Zucker is one of two women that serves in an executive capacity in any 
of the four major professional sports leagues; the other is Jeanie Buss, 
president and part-owner of the crosstown Lakers. The Clippers first regular 
season under Ballmer's ownership ended with a 56-26 record and the #3 Western 
Conference seed going into the 2015 NBA Playoffs. They met with the defending 
the NBA Champions San Antonio Spurs. The series went a full 7 games, and 
with 1 second left, Chris Paul hit the clutch game-winning shot to advance 
Los Angeles into the Western Conference Semi-Finals.[79] In the next series, 
they matched up against the #2 seeded Houston Rockets. The Clippers would 
build a 3-1 series lead that included 25 and 33-point wins in games 3 and 
4, respectively. However, Houston would rally and win the final 3 games 
to prevent Los Angeles from making their first ever appearance in the Conference 
Finals, including a 40-15 run in the 4th quarter in game 6 to force a game 
7 after being down by 13 points in the 3rd quarter. On June 15, 2015, the 
Clippers acquired Lance Stephenson from the Charlotte Hornets in exchange 
for Matt Barnes and Spencer Hawes.[81] In the 2015 NBA draft, the Clippers 
acquired Branden Dawson from the New Orleans Pelicans for $600,000.[82] 
After a decisive last moratorium day, DeAndre Jordan resigned with the 
Clippers to a 4-year, $87.7 million deal with a player option for the fourth 
year on July 9, 2015, after previously agreeing to a 4-year, $80 million 
deal with the Dallas Mavericks.[83] Additionally, the Clippers signed small 
forward Wesley Johnson from the Los Angeles Lakers on the same day.[84] 
On July 10, 2015, the Clippers signed veteran forward Paul Pierce to a 
3-year, $10 million deal with a player option.[85][86] On July 12, the 
Clippers resigned coach Doc Rivers' son, Austin Rivers to a two-year, $6.4 
million deal.[87] Roster • Transactions Last transaction: 2016–10–12 The
