Total Baseball (Latest Edition ISBN 1-894963-27-X, First Published 1989) 
is a baseball encyclopedia first compiled by John Thorn and Pete Palmer 
in 1989. The latest edition, published in 2004, is its eighth.[1] The encyclopedia 
contains seasonal and career statistics in numerous categories for every 
Major League player, as well as historical, opinion, and year-by-year essays. 
The idea for Total Baseball originated when two baseball statisticians 
and historians, Palmer and Thorn, realized that the current Baseball Encyclopedia 
endorsed by Major League Baseball contained numerous significant mistakes.[2] 
These included miscalculations by earlier statisticians, typographic mistakes 
made by the original score keeper, and even "phantom" players who did not 
actually exist and were added to a box score incorrectly, Lou Proctor being 
a notable example. In addition, Thorn and Palmer took the liberty of correcting 
mistakes not commonly accepted by the baseball community, such as the apparent 
discovery that Ty Cobb actually garnered 4,189 hits, not 4,191, or that 
Walter Johnson in fact had 417 career wins, not 416. Thorn and Palmer also 
included new, sabermetric statics developed by statisticians like Bill 
James, such as runs created or total average. The first edition of Total 
Baseball sold 75,000 copies, and by its fourth edition, Major League Baseball
