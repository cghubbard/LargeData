Bleacher Bums is a 1977 play written collaboratively by members of Chicago's 
Organic Theater Company, from an idea by actor Joe Mantegna. Its original 
Chicago production was directed by Stuart Gordon. A 1979 performance of 
the play was taped for PBS television, and in 2002 a made-for-TV movie 
adaptation was produced. Bleacher Bums takes place in the bleachers of 
Chicago's Wrigley Field. The characters are a bunch of Chicago Cubs fans, 
watching a game in progress on a summer afternoon. Most of them have been 
gathering here for some time and know each other; even if they might not 
necessarily like or tolerate each other. Beer is being drunk, hot dogs 
are being eaten, and friendly wagers start to take on increasing importance. 
Bleacher Bums was put on in different cities across the United States. 
In 1981, longtime Cubs fan Jerry Pritikin, the Bleacher Preacher, was hired 
as a paid consultant for a production in San Francisco, instructing the 
cast there on Chicago fan vernacular, and proper fan behavior.[2] Joe Mantegna 
and Dennis Franz starred in the original production, a performance of which 
was filmed for PBS broadcast in 1979, directed by Stuart Gordon. Other 
cast members over the years have included Dennis Farina, Gary Sandy, and 
George Wendt. A 2002 TV movie version for cable television was directed 
by Saul Rubinek and starred Brad Garrett, Wayne Knight, Matt Craven, Peter 
Riegert and Hal Sparks. Due to licensing issues with Major League Baseball, 
the name of the team was changed from the Chicago Cubs to the Chicago Bruins,
