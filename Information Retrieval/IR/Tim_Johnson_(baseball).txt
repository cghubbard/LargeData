As player As manager Timothy Evald Johnson (born July 22, 1949) is a former 
professional baseball player and manager. A shortstop and utility infielder 
in Major League Baseball from 1973 to 1979, he became better known as a 
manager when he was caught lying about his service in the Vietnam War. 
After signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1967 as a free agent, Johnson 
was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Rick Auerbach prior to the 1973 
season while still a minor leaguer. Johnson played everyday for the 1973 
Brewers at shortstop, but lost his starting job next season to Robin Yount, 
thus forcing him to settle in as a utility infielder. He was traded to 
the Toronto Blue Jays during the 1978 season where he retired a year later 
with a lifetime .223 batting average in 516 career games. After retiring 
as a player, Johnson spent the next 20 years as a scout, coach or minor 
league manager for the Dodgers, Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox and Chicago 
Cubs. The Blue Jays named Johnson as their manager for the 1998 season 
following the firing of Cito Gaston and the interim management of pitching 
coach Mel Queen. Johnson beat out several higher-profile candidates, most 
notably Davey Johnson (no relation), Larry Bowa, Paul Molitor and Buck 
Martinez. Queen remained on as pitching coach under Johnson and the two 
reportedly feuded extensively, despite Johnson's reputation as a good communicator. 
Johnson also had rumoured differences with several of his players, including 
Pat Hentgen, Ed Sprague, and Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, all of 
whom left the team after the 1998 season. Despite this lack of chemistry, 
Johnson guided the 1998 Blue Jays to a respectable third-place finish in 
the AL East with an 88–74 record, just four games out of a tie for the 
wild card. It was the team's first winning season since they won two World 
Series in a row in 1992 and 1993. This success was partly attributed to 
the stories Johnson would tell his players about his battle experiences 
in the Vietnam War. For example, he told Hentgen a story about his war 
experiences to get him to accept a different place in the pitching rotation.[1] 
However, in late November, Johnson told several Toronto newspapers that 
all of these stories were completely made up. In truth, Johnson had been 
in the Marine Corps reserves throughout the war, and trained mortarmen 
at Camp Pendleton while playing in the Dodgers' farm system. He'd also 
claimed for over 20 years that he'd been an All-American high school basketball 
player, and turned down a scholarship to attend UCLA.[2] During the 1998 
baseball winter meetings, Johnson said that admitting the truth was like 
having "a 50,000 pound weight" taken off his shoulders. He said he'd lied 
because he felt guilty about going to spring training with the Dodgers 
while many of his friends fought in the war. He entered therapy, and called 
several of his players to apologize for lying. [3] The Blue Jays were initially 
willing to stand by Johnson and let him return for 1999. During spring 
training, he apologized to the entire team, and later said that he didn't 
seem to detect a credibility problem. However, the next month brought a 
steady diet of questions about Johnson's credibility, as well as outside 
attacks (Sprague, for instance, called Johnson a "liar" and a "backstabber"). 
Finally, on March 17, less than a month before opening day, Blue Jays general 
manager Gord Ash fired Johnson and replaced him with Jim Fregosi. Ash said 
that Johnson's presence had become so much of a distraction that he felt 
he would have to fire Johnson "if not now ... 30 or 45 days from now." 
He decided that he had to act in order to save the season.[4] In the years 
since Johnson's one season at the helm, the Blue Jays have failed to equal 
or better record than Johnson's 88–74 mark until 2015.[5] Following his 
dismissal from the Blue Jays, Johnson spent seven seasons as manager in 
the Mexican League, with the Diablos Rojos del México in 1999-2002, Yaquis 
de Obregón in 2002-2003 and then with the Águilas de Mexicali in 2004-2005. 
In 2003, Johnson became manager of the Lincoln Saltdogs of the Northern 
League. In 2006, the Lincoln team joined the American Association of Independent 
Professional Baseball. On September 25, 2008, Johnson resigned after six 
years. His career record as the Saltdogs' manager was 315–255. On December 
16, 2008, Johnson was announced as the inaugural manager of the Golden 
Baseball League incarnation of the Tucson Toros.[7] On November 12, 2010, 
Johnson was announced as the second manager of the Lake County Fielders 
of the North American League.[8] On July 9, 2011, Johnson resigned from 
his Lake County Fielders Managerial Position[9] Johnson later became field 
manager with the El Paso Diablosin 2012,[10] but the team folded in 2013.
