Frank James Jobe (July 16, 1925 – March 6, 2014) was an American orthopedic 
surgeon and co-founder of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic. Jobe pioneered 
both elbow ligament replacement and major reconstructive shoulder surgery 
for baseball players. In 1974, Jobe performed the first ever "Tommy John 
surgery" on then-Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tommy John. The procedure 
has become so prevalent an estimated one-third of all major league pitchers 
have undergone it.[1] Jobe also performed the first major reconstructive 
shoulder surgery on a big league player in 1990, which allowed Dodger star 
Orel Hershiser to continue his career. Jobe served as a special adviser 
to the team until his death. Frank Jobe was born in 1925 in Greensboro, 
North Carolina. After graduating from Collegedale Academy in Collegedale, 
Tennessee in 1943, he enlisted in the United States Army[2] and reported 
to Camp Barkeley for training.[3] Serving in World War II as a medical 
staff sergeant in the Army's 101st Airborne Division, he landed by glider 
at Normandy[4] and later was briefly captured during the Siege of Bastogne 
in the Battle of the Bulge.[2] Successfully escaping, he went on to earn 
the Bronze Star Medal, Combat Medical Badge, and Glider Badge with one 
star.[5] After the war, Jobe enrolled in Southern Missionary College with 
help from the G.I. Bill. He completed his bachelor's degree at La Sierra 
University and went on to medical school at Loma Linda University, receiving 
his MD in 1956.[3] He worked for three years as a general practitioner 
before completing a residency in orthopedic surgery at the Los Angeles 
County Hospital.[2][6] In 1964 Jobe began to consult with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. He teamed with Dr. Robert Kerlan to specialize in the developing 
field of sports medicine. The duo co-founded the Southwestern Orthopaedic 
Medical Group in 1965, later renamed the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic.[2] 
Jobe officially joined the Dodgers' medical staff in 1968.[2][7] Along 
with the Dodgers, the clinic supervised medical treatment for the California 
Angels of Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football 
League, and the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association. 
They eventually worked for the Los Angeles Kings and the Anaheim Ducks 
of the National Hockey League, as well as a large number of other professional 
and amateur athletes from across the country.[8] On September 25, 1974, 
Jobe made sports medicine history when he performed the first reconstruction 
of the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow (UCL) using a revolutionary 
procedure he had devised. What has since become commonly known as Tommy 
John surgery rescued the career of Los Angeles Dodger pitcher Tommy John, 
a 12-year veteran who went on to pitch an astonishing 14 more seasons after 
a year off recovering.[2] A one-time All-Star who had never had more than 
16 wins in a season, John went on to three 20-win seasons, three more All-Star 
appearances, and two second place Cy Young votes post-surgery. Jobe was 
unsure the procedure's benefits would last, so he waited two years before 
performing the second UCL reconstruction. After success with several more 
baseball players and a javelin thrower, Jobe became confident in its lasting 
benefits. The findings of UCL reconstruction were published in the Journal 
of Bone & Joint Surgery in 1986.[3] In the four decades since its inception 
elbow ligament replacement has become common practice for pitchers and 
players at all levels of baseball,[2] with an estimated one-third of all 
Major League pitchers in 2014 having undergone it.[1] What Jobe had estimated 
as a 1 in 100 prospect of a complete recovery for John had risen to 85–92 
percent by 2009.[9] For baseball players, full rehabilitation takes about 
one year for pitchers and about six months for position players. Players 
typically begin throwing about 16 weeks after surgery.[10] Prior to his 
surgery, John had won 124 games. He won 164 after surgery, retiring in 
1989 at age 46.[2] Other pitchers to extend their careers after Tommy John 
surgery include Stephen Strasburg, David Wells, A. J. Burnett, Francisco 
Liriano, Chris Carpenter, Tim Hudson, John Smoltz, Joe Nathan, Brian Wilson, 
Billy Wagner, and Matt Harvey. Sandy Koufax, who suffered a similar injury 
to John's in 1966, once asked Jobe "why didn’t you do that on me?"[2] The 
initial Tommy John surgery, John's return to pitching success, and the 
relationship between the two men was the subject of a 2013 ESPN 30 for 
30 Shorts documentary.[11] In 1990, Jobe performed major reconstructive 
surgery on the shoulder of Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser's throwing arm, 
the first time this procedure was used on a major league player.[12] In 
this surgery, he pioneered a new procedure that reduced the amount of trauma 
suffered by tissue during the surgery. The surgery allowed Hershiser to 
continue his career, and the procedure continues to be used.[2] Jobe served 
as Clinical Professor, Department of Orthopedics, for The Keck School of 
Medicine at the University of Southern California. For 40 years, Jobe served 
as the team physician for the Los Angeles Dodgers, remaining on their medical 
staff through 2008.[7] At the time of his death he was a special advisor 
to the chairman of the Dodger organization. He had also been the orthopedic 
consultant for professional golf's PGA and Champions Tours for 26 years, 
and named the emeritus physician for the PGA Tour.[8] Jobe mentored Lewis 
Yocum, who was one of the best orthopedic surgeons in baseball when he 
died in May 2013.[2] Jobe authored over 140 medical publications, wrote 
30 book chapters, and edited seven books. He received three honorary doctorates, 
two from the United States and one from Japan.[8] Jobe met his future wife 
Beverly Anderson while working as a general practitioner and she was referred 
to him as a patient. Rather than treat her himself, he had another doctor 
treat her so the pair could date.[3] They had four sons, who had eight 
grandchildren.[13] Jobe was Non-Denominational. Jobe underwent coronary 
artery bypass surgery on four arteries in 2002 and had a defibrillator 
implanted in 2010.[3] He died on March 6, 2014, at the age of 88, in Santa 
Monica, California. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig issued a statement 
on Jobe's death saying, "I was deeply saddened to learn of the loss of 
Dr. Frank Jobe, a great gentleman whose work in baseball revolutionized 
sports medicine. Since 1974, his groundbreaking Tommy John surgery has 
revitalized countless careers, especially those of our pitchers."[13] Steve 
Dilbeck of The Los Angeles Times referred to Jobe as a "legend" and said 
"it could be argued that Jobe is the greatest orthopedic surgeon in history", 
while James Andrews called Jobe "one of the premier fathers of modern sports 
medicine", saying that "without his influence, baseball players' sports-medicine 
care would probably still be in the dark ages."[14] Jobe's name has periodically 
been informally mentioned by sportswriters, fans, and players alike as 
worthy of a nomination for the National Baseball Hall of Fame.[15][16][17] 
In August 2012, an official campaign Web site to have Frank Jobe honored 
by the National Baseball Hall of Fame was launched.[18] Jobe was honored 
during Hall of Fame weekend on July 27, 2013, in Cooperstown, New York. 
Hall of Fame president Jeff Idelson said Jobe's work is a testament to 
the positive role of medicine in baseball's growth. Tommy John attended,[19] 
praising Jobe by saying, "I think there should be a medical wing in the
