Ronald Ray Fairly (born July 12, 1938 in Macon, Georgia) is a former Major 
League Baseball player and broadcaster. He either played in or broadcast 
over 7,000 major league games from 1958 through 2006. Fairly played varsity 
baseball for Rod Dedeaux at the University of Southern California (1958), 
and he made the most of it. He hit .348 with team highs of nine home runs 
and 67 RBI while lettering as a sophomore center fielder on the 1958 Trojan 
baseball team which won USC's second College World Series championship. 
There he was a teammate of future baseball executive and General Manager 
Pat Gillick. An All-District 8 selection that season, he was signed by 
the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent. After two brief minor 
league stops, he made the big club late in September 1958. A competitive 
player and highly disciplined hitter, Fairly had a short and compact swing 
with occasional power to all fields. With his glove, he was a competent 
first baseman as well as all three outfield positions, being best suited 
for right field. His talents were overshadowed by a notorious lack of speed. 
He is one of very few players to play 1000 games or more in both the outfield 
and the infield. Fairly made his Major League Baseball debut with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers on September 9, 1958, going hitless in three at-bats in 
a 4-3 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. The next day, Fairly collected 
his first career hit, a single off the Phillies Robin Roberts. On September 
12, Fairly hit his first career home run off Ron Kline of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. Overall with the Dodgers, Fairly played in 15 games, hitting .283 
with 2 HR and 8 RBI. In 1959, Fairly was used mostly as a pinch hitter 
and a defensive replacement late in games, as in 118 games with Los Angeles, 
he had only 244 at-bats. During the season, he hit .238 with 4 HR and 23 
RBI, helping Los Angeles win the National League pennant and advance to 
the 1959 World Series. Fairly played in all six games during the World 
Series, going hitless in three at-bats, as the Dodgers won the series over 
the Chicago White Sox. Fairly spent the majority of the 1960 season with 
the Dodgers AAA affiliate, the Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League, 
as he played in only 14 games with Los Angeles, hitting .108 with 1 HR 
and 3 RBI. In 1961, Fairly played in 111 games with the Dodgers, as he 
hit .322 with 10 HR and 48 RBI, while spending time between the three outfield 
positions and first base. Fairly became the Dodgers everyday first baseman 
during the 1962 season, as in 147 games, he hit .278 with 14 HR and 71 
RBI. Fairly helped the Dodgers clinch the National League pennant in 1963, 
as he played in 152 games, hitting .271 with 12 HR and 77 RBI. In the 1963 
World Series against the New York Yankees, Fairly played in all four games, 
however, he was credited with only one official at-bat, as he failed to 
register a hit, but walked three times as Los Angeles won the series. Fairly 
had another solid season with the Dodgers in 1964, batting .256 with 10 
HR and 74 RBI in 150 games. In 1965, Fairly appeared in a career high 158 
games with Los Angeles, hitting .274 with 9 HR and 70 RBI, helping the 
club to their third National League pennant since Fairly joined the team. 
In the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins, Fairly played a key 
role in the Dodgers seven game series victory, as he hit .379 with 2 HR 
and 6 RBI, as Los Angeles won their third World Series title in seven years. 
Fairly missed a month of the season due to injuries in 1966, playing in 
only 117 games, his lowest total since 1961, however, he hit .288 with 
14 HR and 61 RBI, helping the Dodgers clinch the National League pennant 
for the second consecutive season. In the 1966 World Series against the 
Baltimore Orioles, Fairly hit only .143 with no home runs or RBI in three 
games, as the Dodgers lost to the Orioles. In 1967, Fairly struggled offensively, 
as his batting average dipped to .220, while he had 10 HR and 55 RBI in 
153 games. Fairly continued his struggles throughout the 1968 season, as 
he hit only .234 with 4 HR and 43 RBI in 141 with the Dodgers. He began 
the 1969 season with Los Angeles, however, Fairly continued to struggle 
with his bat, hitting .219 with 0 HR and 8 RBI in 30 games with the Dodgers. 
On June 11, Los Angeles traded Fairly and Paul Popovich to the Montreal 
Expos for Manny Mota and Maury Wills.[1] After struggling offensively with 
the Los Angeles Dodgers for the past two seasons, Fairly immediately improved 
with his move to the expansion team Montreal Expos in 1969, as in 70 games 
with the Expos, Fairly hit .289 with 12 HR and 39 RBI. Fairly had a very 
solid season in 1970, playing in 119 games with the Expos, hitting .288 
with 15 HR and 61 RBI, as well as stealing a career high 10 bases. Fairly 
saw his batting average fall to .257 in the 1971 season, however, his power 
numbers remained steady, as he hit 13 HR and 71 RBI in 146 games with Montreal. 
He continued his solid play with the Expos in 1972, as Fairly hit .278 
with 17 HR and 68 RBI in 140 games. In 1973, Fairly appeared in his first 
ever all-star game, as he appeared late in the game during the 1973 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game as a defensive replacement. Overall with 
the Expos, Fairly hit .298 with 17 HR and 49 RBI in 142 games. During the 
1974 season, Fairly lost some playing time, as he appeared in only 101 
games with Montreal, hitting .243 with 12 HR and 43 RBI. On December 6, 
the Expos traded Fairly to the St. Louis Cardinals for Ed Kurpiel and Rudy 
Kinard. Fairly spent the 1975 season as a utility player for the St. Louis 
Cardinals, as in 107 games, Fairly hit .307 with 7 HR and 37 RBI, as he 
saw his playing time split between first base and as an outfielder. He 
started the 1976 season with St. Louis, appearing in 73 games, as he hit 
.264 with 0 HR and 21 RBI. On September 14, his contract was purchased 
by the Oakland Athletics. Fairly finished the 1976 season with the Oakland 
Athletics. In 15 games with Oakland, Fairly hit .239 with 3 HR and 10 RBI, 
as the Athletics finished in second place in the AL West, ending their 
World Series streak at three. On February 24, 1977, the A's traded Fairly 
to the Toronto Blue Jays for Gary Weathers and cash. Fairly split the 1977 
season between designated hitter, first base and the outfield, as he played 
in 132 games with Toronto, hitting .279 with a team leading 19 HR and 64 
RBI. He appeared in the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and as 
a pinch hitter, Fairly struck out against Tom Seaver. Fairly is the only

8, the Blue Jays traded Fairly to the California Angels for Butch Alberts 
and Pat Kelly. Fairly finished his career with the California Angels in 
1978, playing in 91 games, hitting .217 with 10 HR and 40 RBI. He announced 
his retirement at the end of the season.[2] Fairly played 21 seasons of 
Major League Baseball, 12 of them with the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he 
won three World Series titles. In 2442 career games, Fairly had 1913 hits, 
a .266 batting average with 215 HR and 1044 RBI, while walking 1052 times 
compared to only 877 strikeouts. Fairly played in four World Series, appearing 
in 20 games, hitting .300 with 2 HR and 6 RBI, all with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. His career home run total is the most in major league history 
for a player without a 20-home run season. After his playing days, Fairly 
began his broadcasting career in 1979 at KTLA in Los Angeles and later 
joined Bob Starr in the California Angels radio/television booth. In 1987, 
Fairly moved up the coast and could be heard on KNBR as the voice of the 
San Francisco Giants. In 1993, he went further north as a broadcaster for
