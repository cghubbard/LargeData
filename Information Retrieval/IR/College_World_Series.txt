The College World Series, or CWS, is an annual baseball tournament held 
in Omaha, Nebraska that takes place in June of each year. The CWS is the 
culmination of the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship series which determines 
the NCAA Division I college baseball champion. The eight participating 
teams are split into two, four-team, double-elimination brackets with the 
winners of each bracket playing in a best-of-three championship series. 
Since 1950, the College World Series (CWS) has been held in Omaha, Nebraska. 
It was held at Rosenblatt Stadium from 1950 through 2010; starting in 2011, 
it has been held at TD Ameritrade Park Omaha. Earlier tournaments were 
held at Hyames Field in Kalamazoo, Michigan (1947â€“48) and Wichita, Kansas 
(1949). The name "College World Series" (CWS) is derived from that of the 
Major League Baseball World Series championship; it is currently an MLB 
trademark licensed to the NCAA.[1] On June 10, 2009, the NCAA and College 
World Series of Omaha, Inc., which is the non-profit group that organizes 
the event, announced a new 25-year contract extension, keeping the CWS 
in Omaha through 2035.[2] A memorandum of understanding had been reached 
by all parties on April 30.[3] The currently binding contract began in 
2011, the same year the tournament moved from Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium 
to TD Ameritrade Park Omaha, a new ballpark across from CenturyLink Center
