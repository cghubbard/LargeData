Seals Stadium was a minor league baseball stadium in San Francisco. Opened 
in the Mission District in 1931, it was the longtime home of the San Francisco 
Seals (1931–57) and the Mission Reds (1931–37), both of the Pacific Coast 
League. It was later home for the Major League San Francisco Giants for 
their first two seasons in the city, 1958 and 1959. Less than three decades 
old, the stadium was demolished in late 1959 after the completion of the 
baseball season.[4] Built during the Depression, Seals Stadium opened on 
April 7, 1931. It cost $1,250,000 to construct, and Seals President "Doc" 
Strub described how laborers would leap onto the running boards of his 
automobile and beg for the opportunity to work on the project for $3 a 
day. The stadium was unusual in that it was built with three dressing rooms 
– one for the visiting team, and one for each of the minor league home 
teams, the San Francisco Seals and the Mission Reds, a.k.a. the San Francisco 
Missions. It was built for night games, with six tower banks which were 
described as the best in minor league baseball at the time. With a capacity 
of 18,600, the stadium had no roof over the grandstands because of San 
Francisco's lack of rainfall during the summertime and the fans' preference 
to sit in the sun.[5] The stadium initially consisted of an uncovered grandstand 
stretching from foul pole to foul pole and an uncovered bleacher section 
in right field. In some years during its minor league days, a live seal 
was kept in a water tank underneath the grandstand. The field was oriented 
southeast, with the right field bleachers bounded by 16th Street.[6] After 
their inception in 1903 as an original Pacific Coast League member, the 
San Francisco Seals previously played at Recreation Park (1903–1913, 1915–1930) 
and Ewing Field (1914) before Seals Stadium was built to house the team.[7] 
While the Seals played exclusively at Seals Stadium, the other original 
tenant, the Mission Reds moved to the Los Angeles area in 1938 and become 
the Hollywood Stars.[7] Seals Stadium officially opened with a Spring training 
game between the Seals and the Detroit Tigers on March 13, 1931.[8] At 
the regular season Home Opener on April 7, 1931 Ty Cobb threw out the first 
pitch at the game, which drew 25,000 fans.[3] Hall of Fame legend Joe DiMaggio 
grew up in San Francisco and played for the Seals from October 1932 through 
1935. In 1933, DiMaggio hit safely in a record 61 straight games and had 
169 RBI, with a batting average of.340.[8] Another future major league 
player Gus Suhr had an incredible season for the Seals in 1929, hitting 
.381 with 51 home runs and 177 RBI. Other notable players for the Seals 
included: Dominic DiMaggio, Vince DiMaggio, Tony Lazzeri, Joe Cronin, Albie 
Pearson, Ferris Fain, Earl Averill and Lefty Gomez.[7] The Seals drew well 
at Seals Park, setting a minor league attendance record in 1948, drawing 
670,000 fans. This showcased the feasibility that San Francisco could someday 
sustain and support a Major League franchise.[9] After the Giants announced 
their move to San Francisco, the Seals were forced to move and the minor 
league franchise was relocated to Phoenix, Arizona in 1958, becoming the 
Phoenix Giants. On May 28, 1957 the New York Giants and team owner Horace 
Stoneham announced they intended to leave the Polo Grounds in New York 
and move the franchise to San Francisco. The rest of the major league owners 
approved the move under the condition that the Brooklyn Dodgers would also 
complete their intended move to Los Angeles. The Dodgers' owner Walter 
O'Malley and San Francisco Mayor George Christopher had worked to partner 
with Stoneham on the move to San Francisco, as both teams moving to California 
together made sense for balance and travel. On August 19, 1957, after both 
teams and both cities worked out the logistics, the final announcement 
of the move was made.[10][11] The Giants would play at Seals Stadium for 
two years while Candlestick Park was under construction and the Dodgers 
would play at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, bypassing the smaller Wrigley 
Field (Los Angeles), while Dodger Stadium was under construction. On April 
15, 1958, the first ever West Coast Major League game was played at Seals 
Park. With the legendary Willie Mays and Rookie (and future Hall of Famer) 
Orlando Cepeda in the lineup, the Giants opened with an 8-0 victory over 
Don Drysdale and the new Los Angeles Dodgers. Mays would go on to hit .347 
with 29 home runs in 1958. Cepeda would win the National League Rookie 
of the Year Award in 1958. Willie McCovey, another future Hall of Famer, 
then won the award in 1959.[10][12] Cepeda would hit his first career home 
run at Seals Stadium on April 15, 1958.[13] The Giants would draw well 
at Seals Stadium, with attendance of 1,272,625 fans in 1958 and 1,422,130 
in 1959.[1] To accommodate Major League Baseball, more seating was needed 
at Seals Stadium. A separate uncovered bleacher section was added in left 
field with the New York Giants move to the city in 1958. The Giants played 
at Seals Stadium for two years while Candlestick Park was under construction. 
Given the temporary nature of their stay at the old park, they declined 
to rename the stadium. Throughout the ballpark's MLB tenure, it lacked 
a warning track.[14] The original plan was to play just the first year 
at Seals Stadium.[2] Prevailing winds to left field aided right-handed 
hitters; of the 45 home runs hit in its first 19 major league games in 
1958, 36 were to left field.[15] A brewery was just north of the venue.[4][16] 
At the time, its weather was thought to be considerably less favorable 
than at the site of the park under construction at Candlestick Point.[2] 
The final game at Seals Stadium took place on September 20, 1959. The Giants 
lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-2 in front of 22,923.[17] No pitcher 
threw a no-hitter at Seals Stadium in Major League competition.[18] On 
February 22, 1933 boxer Young Corbett III defeated Jackie Fields at the 
stadium, earning the title of World Welterweight Champion. Corbett later 
won the Middleweight Championship at Seals, beating Fred Apostoli on February 
22, 1938 . With the new ballpark safely nearing completion, Seals Stadium 
was demolished in November 1959. Many of the seats and the light towers 
were reused at Cheney Stadium in Tacoma, Washington.[4][19] From the late 
1960s to the mid-1970s, the site was a White Front discount department 
store. For many years afterward, the site (bounded by Bryant Street, 16th 
Street, Potrero Avenue and Alameda Street) housed several San Francisco 
automobile dealerships after the demise of Van Ness Avenue's famed auto 
row in 1982. In the late 1990s, it was converted to a shopping center.[4][20] 
On April 15, 2008, the Giants had a tribute at the Seals Stadium site and 
at AT&T Park to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1958 Opening Day. 
The Giants Home Game that day – against the Arizona Diamondbacks – started 
at 1:35 p.m. The start time commemorated the same time of day that Giants' 
pitcher Ruben Gomez threw the first pitch at Seals Stadium on Opening Day, 
April 15, 1958. The first 20,000 fans attending the Diamondbacks-Giants 
game received a commemorative poster print of the Gomez' first pitch from 
1958. Orlando Cepeda and Gino Cimoli, the first man at bat on that historic 
day, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.[21][22] There were pre-game 
events at the site of Seals Stadium. Ceremonies included the unveiling 
of a new bronze historical plaque at the site, a recreation of the radio 
call of the first pitch by Jon Miller, an honoring of Mike Murphy, the 
Giants 50-year legendary clubhouse manager, as well as speeches/recollections 
by Willie Mays and others. Among those recognized were Giants Hall of Famers 
Mays and Orlando Cepeda and former 1958 Giants players Jim Davenport and 
Eddie Bressoud. Descendants of former Giants' owner Horace Stoneham and 
Mayor George Christopher (both instrumental in moving the Giants from New
