Franklin E. Wren (born March 17, 1958 in St. Petersburg, Florida) is an 
American front office executive in Major League Baseball.[1] He began his 
baseball career as a player for the Montreal Expos, and later joined the 
team as an executive. Wren moved to the Florida Marlins in 1991, then was 
hired by the Baltimore Orioles in 1998 for his first stint as a general 
manager. After the season, Wren was hired by the Atlanta Braves. The Braves 
promoted Wren to general manager in 2007, a role he kept until 2014. He 
joined the Boston Red Sox in September 2015. Wren graduated from Northeast 
High School in St. Petersburg.[2] He then attended St. Petersburg Junior 
College and signed with the Montreal Expos as an outfielder in 1977. In 
five minor league seasons, Wren batted .259 and peaked with a 38-game stint 
with the Double-A Memphis Chicks in 1980. He accepted a job coaching in 
the Expos organization in 1981 while recovering from surgery to remove 
a brain tumor. After trying to resume his playing career in the spring 
of 1982, Wren became a full-time coach that June with the Jamestown Expos.[3] 
He joined the front office as General Manager of Jamestown in October 1984 
and was promoted to Assistant Director of Scouting in September 1985. He 
was named Director of Latin American Scouting in 1989.[4] In September 
of 1991, Wren's boss, Expos GM Dave Dombrowski, accepted the position of 
GM of the Florida Marlins, a National League expansion franchise set to 
begin play in 1993, at which Wren followed Dombrowski to the Marlins as 
the club's assistant GM.[5] By 1996, he was promoted to vice president.[6] 
In 1997, the veteran-laden Marlins won the franchise's first World Series. 
In 1998, owner Wayne Huizenga would order his front office to divest the 
team of its high-priced veterans,[7][8] and the Marlins spiraled into the 
basement of the National League East Division. When Pat Gillick resigned 
as GM of the Orioles at the close of the 1998 season, Wren was named his 
replacement,[9] however the 1999 Orioles were a major disappointment.[10] 
The club finished six games under .500 despite one of the highest payrolls 
in the game and the signing of free agent slugger Albert Belle to the most 
lucrative contract in team history at the time.[11] During the season, 
Wren and the team were criticized publicly by Baltimore owner Peter Angelos,[12][13] 
and after just one season, he replaced Wren with veteran executive Syd 
Thrift.[14] Wren then joined the Braves as top assistant GM to longtime 
Atlanta GM John Schuerholz, a position that he held for eight seasons.[15] 
On October 11, 2007, Schuerholz was named president of the Braves and Wren 
was promoted to executive vice president and GM, signing a four-year contract.[16] 
Wren was known for developing a strong farm system.[17] He has had many 
prospects reach MLB.com's Top 100 Prospects list, notably Julio Teheran.[18] 
Wren was released by the Braves on September 22, 2014, a day after the 
Braves were eliminated from playoff contention.[19] In his tenure as general 
manager, Wren made some effective trades to acquire a resurgent Javier 
Vazquez in 2009, Michael Bourn in 2011, and Justin Upton in 2013.[20] But 
some free agent signings did not go as well. Derek Lowe was signed to a 
4-year, $60 million deal in 2009, but struggled in 2011, before being traded 
to the Cleveland Indians.[21] Kenshin Kawakami was signed from the Chunichi 
Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball in 2009. He spent two years with 
the Braves and posted a 8-22 record with a 4.32 ERA.[22] Wren traded for 
Dan Uggla in the 2010 offseason and signed him to a 5-year, $62 million 
contract. Uggla did well for two years, then slumped before being released 
in 2014.[20] Melvin Upton joined the Braves on a 5-year, $75.25 million 
contract in 2013, but struggled through his two-year stint with the team[23][24] 
before being traded to the San Diego Padres in April 2015.[25] The money 
committed to Upton was Wren's most expensive deal.[26] The Boston Red Sox 
named Wren the team's senior vice president of baseball operations on September 
25, 2015. He succeeded Mike Hazen, who had been promoted to general manager.[27] 
He and his wife Terri[28] have three sons: Jordan, an outfielder at Georgia 
Southern University;[29] Colby, a former Georgia Tech infielder; [30] and 
his twin brother, former Georgia Tech outfielder Kyle Wren, who was selected 
by the Cincinnati Reds in the 30th round of the 2012 MLB draft. In 2013,
