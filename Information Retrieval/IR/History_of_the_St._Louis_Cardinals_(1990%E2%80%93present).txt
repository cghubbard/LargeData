People Overview Grounds Teams The St. Louis Cardinals, a professional baseball 
franchise based in St. Louis, Missouri, compete in the National League 
(NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). Brewing magnate Gussie Busch's 37-year-long 
ownership of the club ended with his death in 1989, and his brewery, Anheuser-Busch 
(AB) took over. In 1995, an investment group led by Drew Baur and William 
DeWitt, Jr., purchased the team and have owned the club since. Shortstop 
Ozzie Smith – nicknamed "The Wizard" – collected a staggering array of 
defensive records and awards while performing acrobatic spectacles such 
as somersaults and flips that mesmerized Cardinal and non-Cardinal fans 
alike. In 1998, Mark McGwire and the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa collocated 
national attention with their chase of Roger Maris' single-season home 
run record of 61. In addition, McGwire also set numerous team home run 
records. For the 1990s, the Cardinals captured one division title and finished 
above .500 five times for a .488 winning percentage[1] The Baur-DeWitt 
era continued Busch's and the Cardinals' winning tradition the next decade. 
Walt Jocketty, with a reputation as a top player developer, became the 
GM in 1995, and he hired renowned manager Tony La Russa. DeWitt's ownership 
group oversaw a period of consistent playoff appearances through key acquisitions 
of players. He also implemented a philosophy of bolstering talent from 
the minor leagues as the farm system consistently lagged near the bottom 
in baseball, as noted by publications such as ESPN and Baseball America. 
From 2000 to 2013, the Cardinals made ten playoff appearances, won two 
World Series and four NL pennants. With 1,274 regular season wins against 
993 losses for a .560 winning percentage, the Cardinals led the National 
League and were second in MLB only to the New York Yankees.[2] The Cardinals 
acquired defensive experts and sluggers Jim Edmonds (center fielder) in 
2000 and Scott Rolen (third baseman) in 2002. A thirteenth-round draft 
pick in Albert Pujols unexpectedly put together one of the most productive 
ten years in Major League history with a .331 batting average and 408 home 
runs. Free agent acquisition and pitcher Chris Carpenter led St. Louis' 
pitching staff into multiple playoff hunts. However, revelations of the 
widespread use of banned substances across baseball came to light in the 
2000s decade that retroactively exposed McGwire's home run record chase 
and former pitcher Rick Ankiel's comeback bid as a hitter. Despite the 
scandals, the Cardinals acquired Matt Holliday, Lance Berkman, Carlos Beltrán 
and Adam Wainwright to replace Edmonds, Pujols, Rolen and Carpenter. Eventually, 
McGwire issued a public apology and returned to the Cardinals as the hitting 
coach. La Russa retired from managing after 2011 with the most wins in 
franchise history (1,408) and World Series championships (two) and Mike 
Matheny replaced him. Concurrently, the fruition of a new player development 
model of which DeWitt pursued contributed greatly to two World Series appearances 
in 2011 and 2013, such as David Freese putting on rare comeback heroics 
and Allen Craig compiling a historically high batting average with runners 
in scoring position. From 1990 to 2013, St. Louis made eleven total playoff 
appearances and had a combined record of 2,032 wins and 1,787 losses for 
a .531 winning percentage, fourth-best among all major league teams in 
that span.[3][4] After Gussie Busch died in 1989, the brewery took primary 
control of the Cardinals.[5] Former Cardinal catcher and third baseman 
Joe Torre replaced Whitey Herzog as manager late in the 1990 season after 
he unexpectedly resigned.[6][7] Despite an in-season trade to the Oakland 
A's that season, outfielder Willie McGee attained the requisite number 
of plate appearances to win his second NL batting title with the Cardinals 
at .335, making him the only player to win a batting title and end the 
same season in the other Major League.[8] McGee's batting title was the 
main highlight in a season where the Cardinals finished last in the division 
(70–92, .432 winning percentage). It was the first occurrence that they 
finished last in the standings since 1918 (52–78, .395 winning percentage), 
when they finished last in the NL when the two leagues had not yet been 
split into divisions.[9] However, the Atlanta Braves finished with the 
worst record in the NL (65–97, .401 winning percentage) in 1990.[10] Thus, 
the Cardinals have avoided finishing last in the entire league every year 
since 1918, the longest such streak in Major League history and the 1990 
season is still their only last place finish in their division.[4] Starting 
the next season, the Cardinals commenced a period of playing above expectations 
and continued a reputation of defensive excellence. Torre's teams 83 or 
more games each season in 1991, 1992 and 1993.[4] Shortstop Ozzie Smith, 
a fan favorite due to his acrobatics, smooth glove and powerful arm, set 
several defensive records, including the single-season record for fewest 
errors at shortstop (8) in 1991.[11] He also set career marks at his position 
games played in 1993, assists (July 14, 1994), and double plays (1,554 
on September 15, 1995), and won the Gold Glove every year from 1982 to 
1992 with the Cardinals.[11][12] The accolades did not stop with Smith, 
however. Between 1978 and 1992, St. Louis were represented with at least 
one Gold Glove winner each year.[11][13] On September 7, 1993, Mark Whiten 
launched four home runs in the second game of a doubleheader against the 
Cincinnati Reds to go with 12 RBIs, both tying all-time single-game records.[11][14] 
On October 14, 1994, Walt Jocketty replaced Dal Maxvill as general manager. 
A recommendation for Jocketty came from Tony La Russa, whom he hired as 
manager later as Cardinals GM. "He's a guy who had all the qualities. A 
lot of baseball background, business background, willingness to take responsibility, 
had been mentored by really good people, Sandy Alderson, Bob Gebhard", 
according to La Russa.[15] After a disappointing finish in 1994 (53-61) 
and start in 1995 (20-27), Jocketty fired Torre and replaced him on an 
interim basis with Mike Jorgensen. In an effort to enhance stock value, 
Anheuser-Busch (AB) surprised St. Louis by announcing the Cardinals were 
for sale. They simultaneously announced plans to close a brewery in Tampa 
Bay and sell off their Eagle Snacks division. However, AB were resolute 
in their efforts to keep the Cardinals from moving out of St. Louis by 
selling the team only in a package deal with Busch Memorial Stadium.[5] 
As a middle market metropolitan area, had AB not moved to create measures 
to keep the team in St. Louis, chances are they may have been moved to 
a larger market. AB sold the team at an undervalued price to a partnership 
headed by Southwest Bank's Drew Baur, Fred Hanser and William DeWitt, Jr. 
in December 1995. DeWitt has a long track record in baseball, commencing 
with his father, Bill DeWitt, who once worked for former Cardinals general 
manager (GM) Branch Rickey and owned the St. Louis Browns. DeWitt himself 
was a minority owner of the Texas Rangers and actively participated with 
the baseball clubs on which the elder DeWitt served.[16] Hired during the 
AB era, the new ownership retained Jocketty.[15] One of Jocketty's first 
moves under new ownership was to hire La Russa away from the Oakland Athletics.[17] 
La Russa became one of the most successful managers in history owing in 
part to his quality as a strategically brilliant and a tactical innovator, 
concocting "inventive bullpen matchups", and "creating the role of the 
one-inning closer [for] Dennis Eckersley", patterns that are an integral 
part of the current game.[18] La Russa brought two of his most trusted 
coaches from Oakland, among others – pitching coach Dave Duncan and first 
base coach Dave McKay – both of whose coaching tenures in St. Louis coincided 
with La Russa's term.[19][20] St. Louis won the NL Central the following 
season for their only division title of the decade. Besides the coaches, 
several former Athletics players followed La Russa to St. Louis, including 
Mark McGwire, Eckersley, McGee, and Todd Stottlemyre. McGwire, the record 
holder for home runs by a rookie with 49 in 1987, set the Cardinals' record 
for a one-month home run total with 15 in September 1997.[21][22] In 1998, 
the Cardinals became the focus of the baseball world as McGwire broke the 
single-season home run record with 70.[23] His epic pursuit of Roger Maris' 
record along with the Cubs' Sammy Sosa[24] helped to reenergize baseball 
with fans following the 1994 strike.[22] In 1999, McGwire followed up with 
65 home runs and 147 RBIs, becoming the first Major League player to hit 
at least 50 home runs in four consecutive seasons.[25] With the new millennium, 
the Cardinals embarked in a new ambitious era – in part taking advantage 
of the expanded playoff format including berths for wild card teams.[26] 
Between 2000 and 2013, St. Louis made ten total playoff appearances. They 
took seven division titles, three wild card spots, four NL pennants and 
two World Series championships.[4] Shortly before the 2000 season, the 
Cardinals traded for Gold Glove center fielder Jim Edmonds from the California 
Angels.[27] With dazzling defense and a powerful bat that made him a favorite 
among Cardinal fans, "Jimmy Baseball" helped spark the Cardinals to playoff 
berths in six of the next seven years, won eight Gold Glove awards and 
hit 241 home runs in eight seasons in St. Louis.[28] Edmonds made an immediate 
impact and raised his production that season, hitting a career-high 42 
home runs and winning his third Glove Glove.[29] The Cardinals took advantage 
of the high-scoring trend around baseball, plating 887 runs on their way 
to 95 wins and the Central division title.[30] McGwire was lost to a season-ending 
injury in 2000 with a .305 batting average, 32 home runs, 73 RBIs, a .483 
on-base percentage and .746 slugging percentage in 89 games, but St. Louis 
brought in Will Clark from the Baltimore Orioles, and he stepped in with 
a .345 batting average, 12 home runs and a .655 slugging percentage.[31][32] 
Rick Ankiel, sporting a 94-97 MPH fastball and a "fall-off-the-table" curveball, 
finished second in both strikeouts per nine innings and the Rookie of the 
Year balloting.[33] However, an unexplained loss of control in that year's 
playoffs plagued him until he stopped pitching.[34] Powered by another 
heralded rookie in Albert Pujols, the Cardinals took the Wild Card the 
following year. Pujols enjoyed a career start unmatched in the entire history 
of the game. During his first eleven seasons, he batted .328 with 445 home 
runs, winning a batting title in 2003 at .359 and home run titles in 2009 
and 2010. Third baseman Scott Rolen arrived via trade from the Phillies 
in 2002. With Edmonds and Pujols, the Cardinals featured three of the best 
hitters in baseball who were also highly regarded defensive players. Key 
acquisitions also bolstered the pitching staff. Darryl Kile posted 20 wins 
with his trademarked big-breaking curveball in 2000 and raised his performance 
in 2001, posting a 3.09 ERA. Chris Carpenter was signed as a free agent 
and Adam Wainwright and Jason Marquis both arrived via trade. Between 2000 
and 2002, the Cardinals' seasons ended in two trips in the NLCS. At the 
end of the 2000 season, The Sporting News named Jocketty Executive of the 
Year, his first of two such awards with the Cardinals.[15] However, near-simultaneous 
tragedies struck in 2002. On June 18, famed longtime Cardinals sportscaster 
Jack Buck died following health complications.[35] Just four days later, 
after Cardinals personnel noticed Kile's absence from pregame warmups before 
a Cubs game, he was found dead in his hotel room. The autopsy revealed 
the cause of death to be coronary artery disease.[36] That game was postponed, 
resulting in the first day-night doubleheader in the history of Wrigley 
Field later in the season.[37] An award was commissioned in his honor.[38] 
The avenues from which teams acquired marquée talent started to close and 
DeWitt, recognizing that he needed to change his club's approach to stay 
competitive, went about "abandoning a philosophy of chasing big names" 
that had netted such stars as McGwire, Edmonds, Kile, Édgar Rentería and 
Rolen. Said DeWitt, "We had great teams in that era, but I knew that that 
wasn’t sustainable because as that group aged, we would need younger players. 
With the new labor agreement that was coming in, teams were holding on 
to their players." He added, "we were opportunistic prior to that by getting 
players from other clubs, but we made a conscious decision back in the 
’03 and ’04 time frame that we were going to throw a lot of resources and 
make every effort to build from within ... Rather than giving up draft 
choices, we tried to accumulate draft choices." To avert continual reliance 
on signing free agents and trading for stars already in their prime, DeWitt 
sought to place the expertise of people like Jeff Luhnow to create an efficient 
player development system utilizing the entire organization. DeWitt hired 
him in 2003 to become the vice president of baseball development. As Luhnow 
lacked a baseball background, his hire was seen as unconventional, but 
DeWitt saw potential in the Northwestern graduate with an MBA because of 
his business background and analytical ability.[39] In the offseason before 
2004, St. Louis made key pitching acquisitions that later proved integral 
in their World Series runs: resigning free agent Chris Carpenter[40] despite 
not pitching the season before, and bringing in Adam Wainwright[41] and 
Jason Marquis via trade.[42] Mediocre results characterized a 23–22 start.[43] 
However, Rolen, Edmonds and Pujols powered the Cardinals to a Major League-best 
105 wins, earning the nickname "MV3", as they won 82 of their final 117 
games (.700 winning percentage).[44] Each one equaled or surpassed 34 home 
runs, 102 runs scored, 111 RBIs and a .301 batting average[45] and ranked 
third, fourth and fifth in the MVP voting.[46] Carpenter lived up to his 
former top-prospect billing, breaking through with 15 wins and a 3.22 ERA 
and the pitching staff finished second in the NL in ERA at 3.75. In the 
NLCS, Edmonds hit a game-winning home run against the Houston Astros. In 
the World Series, they met a Boston Red Sox squad fresh off four straight 
victories over the Yankees following an 0–3 deficit in the ALCS. A comeback 
in this fashion in any North American major sports leagues had previously 
occurred only in the NHL. Not skipping a beat, the Red Sox swept the Cardinals. 
Following the Cardinals' regular season success, The Sporting News named 
Jocketty to his second Executive of the Year award.[47] Meanwhile, Major 
League Baseball found itself on the receiving end of a publicity disaster 
after the House of Representatives' Government Reform Committee subpoenaed 
a group of baseball executives and players to testify about the use of 
anabolic steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) in baseball on March 17, 
2005. Collectively, any banned substances classified as or similar to, 
but not only including, steroids or HGH, became known as performance-enhancing 
drugs (PEDs). The executives included Commissioner Bud Selig and union 
head Donald Fehr. The players included Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa (with whom 
McGwire shared the chase of Maris' home run record in 1998), Rafael Palmeiro, 
Roger Clemens and Alex Rodriguez.[48] Other players, such as Curt Schilling 
(due to his strident outspokenness against PEDs) and José Canseco (due 
to his role as a whistleblower), were requested to testify against the 
epidemic. Congresspeople such as Jim Bunning (a former pitcher), Henry 
Waxman and Elijah Cummings interrogated the sportsmen. McGwire was apologetic 
and admissive to a steroid problem within the sport, yet evasive about 
his own use when confronted, responding with "I'm not here to discuss the 
past", and "I'm here to be positive about this subject." Sosa, Rodríguez, 
Palmeiro and Clemens answered with either similar levels of ambiguity or 
denials. Selig and Fehr defended the policy that was in place, stating 
they felt it was sufficient. The hearing lasted 11 hours having produced 
neither any definitive answers besides denials nor any proclamations to 
make concrete steps to clean up the sport. As a result, Selig, Fehr, the 
players Congress subpoenaed and any other player suspected of using PEDs 
became objects of public scorn.[48][49] Winning another 100 games and a 
Central Division title in 2005, Carpenter became the franchise's first 
Cy Young Award winner since Bob Gibson and Pujols won his first Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) award. In one calendar year spanning the 45th game of both 
the 2004–05 seasons, St. Louis won 111 regular season games, a feat matched 
just four times previously in MLB.[43] However, they fell in an NLCS rematch 
with the Astros. Despite winning just 83 games in 2006, St. Louis again 
won the NL Central division crown as they moved into the new Busch Stadium. 
Wainwright filled in as an emergency closer to save the pennant clincher 
and struck out fifteen in ten playoff innings. In the World Series, the 
Cardinals defeated the Detroit Tigers in five games.[50] David Eckstein 
garnered the World Series MVP with a .364 batting average.[50] Their 83 
wins represents the second-lowest win total of a World Series champion. 
The Cardinals were also the first team since the 1923 New York Yankees 
to open a new ballpark with a World Series championship in the same season. 
After their World Series win in 2006, St. Louis began a period of transition 
precipitated in part by recent injuries to key players such as Carpenter, 
Edmonds and Rolen. St. Louis failed to reach the playoffs for two consecutive 
seasons in 2007 and 2008 for the first time since 1998–99. However, Wainwright 
started his emergence as a key starting pitcher in 2007, eventually leading 
the league in wins in 2009 and finishing second in ERA in 2010.[51] The 
lowest point came when pitcher Josh Hancock died in an early-morning motor 
vehicle accident on April 29 while intoxicated.[52] More issues followed 
later in the season. After hitting nine home runs in one month following 
a call-up from the minor leagues on August 9, the New York Daily News reported 
that Ankiel had received one year's supply of HGH in his 2004 attempt to 
come back as a pitcher.[53][54] Differences in player development strategies 
began to undermine Jocketty's efforts as GM. When DeWitt promoted Luhnow 
to the position of vice president of amateur scouting and player development 
in 2006, tension arose between the two men as Jocketty perceived that it 
tacitly meant the Cardinals were looking to divide his authority. Although 
Jocketty built consistently winning teams since 2000, injuries and age 
started to erode at the team's core. The Cardinals' farm system was low 
in fruitfulness and the DeWitt sought to increase the minor league's talent 
productivity. Concurrently, the trend had been for MLB clubs to dispose 
of their prospects as trading chips for established star players, as was 
Jocketty's strategy, but that was changing. Between 2000 and 2007, the 
highest rank the farm system was recognized was 21st; most of the other 
years it was in one of lowest three.[55][56] After the 2007 season, Jocketty 
and the Cardinals parted ways, and John Mozeliak was named GM.[16][57][58] 
One of Mozeliak's first moves was to trade the immensely popular Edmonds 
to the San Diego Padres for third baseman David Freese. He also shipped 
Rolen to the Toronto Blue Jays for third basemen Troy Glaus.[59][60] In 
2008, Pujols won his second MVP (and a third in 2009) and Ankiel continued 
his emergence from switching to the outfield from pitching and hit 25 home 
runs in 120 games.[61] St. Louis defeated the San Diego Padres on August 
22, 2009, for the 10,000th win in franchise history dating back to the 
American Association, becoming only the fourth team to accomplish the feat.[a][62] 
Before the 2010 season, La Russa confirmed that Mark McGwire would become 
the Cardinals' hitting coach after years of self-induced public exile since 
retiring as a player in 2001. Months after his hire in January, 2010, he 
publicly admitted to steroid use through parts of his career, including 
his home run record-breaking season in 1998, and issued a public apology. 
Commissioner Selig was pleased with McGwire's announcement, adding that 
"this statement of contrition I believe will make Mark's re-entry into 
the game much smoother and easier."[63] La Russa stated that, before that 
day, he "didn’t know anything. Mark and I never confronted it, and he never 
told me until this morning." McGwire remarked that during the 2005 Congressional 
hearings, he was then ready to admit to his steroid use, but lawyers advised 
against it to attempt to attain immunity.[64] The Cardinals returned to 
the playoffs in 2011 by usurping the Wild Card spot on the final day from 
the Atlanta Braves after falling 10 1⁄2 games behind on the 130th game. 
Thus they completed the largest comeback in history with 32 left to play.[65][66][67] 
Due to their fixtures in different divisions, they played fewer head-to-head 
games, further lowering Cardinals' odds of catching the Braves.[68] In 
the NLDS, the Cardinals defeated the Phillies. Game 5 featured a pitching 
duel between Carpenter and Phillies ace Roy Halladay that became the first 
NL playoff series to end in a 1-0 score and Carpenter's second complete 
game shutout clincher of the season.[69] The Cardinals met the Texas Rangers 
in the World Series.[70] Pujols tied a World Series record in Game 3 by 
smashing three home runs, joining only Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson.[71] 
"Mr. Octo-bert" also tied World Series single-game records for hits, total 
bases, RBIs, and runs scored.[72][73] Game 6 nearly saw the Rangers win 
the Series, but after twice being one strike away from elimination, St. 
Louis tied both times –– the first such occurrence in MLB history.[70] 
First, David Freese delivered a triple that drove in two runs in the ninth 
inning to tie the game, and Berkman followed with a game-tying RBI single 
in the 10th.[74][75] Leading off the 11th, Freese hit a walk-off home run 
to center field.[b][76][77] The Cardinals defeated the Rangers in Game 
7 to win the Series. Freese's performance garnered him the World Series 
MVP. Despite the elation of having won a championship in extraordinary 
fashion, the offseason events following brought about the appearance the 
Cardinals franchise were systematically dismantling itself. Three days 
after the Series ended, La Russa announced his retirement, making him the 
first manager to end his career with a World Series win and with the most 
managerial victories (1,408) in franchise history.[78][79] Pujols declared 
free agency on October 31.[80] On December 7, the Houston Astros hired 
Luhnow as their general manager, culminating his rise through the Cardinals 
ranks as a top player developer.[81] The next day, Pujols ended the bidding 
war over himself by signing with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for 
$254 million, the second-highest valued contract in history.[82] However, 
not all news was bad. One week later, Baseball America bestowed the Cardinals 
with their Organization of the Year award for the first time, an award 
given since 1982. It was given in part to recognize the increased productivity 
of the Cardinals farm system. Seventeen of the 25 players on the Cardinals' 
2011 postseason roster were drafted and developed by the Cardinals. Along 
with Luhnow, Mozeliak helped fulfill owner Bill DeWitt, Jr.'s mission to 
make Cardinals' farm system a consistent producer of prospects who would 
be key in the Major League's club success.[83][84] Attesting to the award 
the franchise had just been crowned, the Cardinals later proved they had 
successfully established a system that could thrive after the departure 
of three key personnel. The Cardinals kept winning following the departure 
of franchise icons La Russa and Pujols. Former Cardinals backstop Mike 
Matheny became the new Cardinals manager for the 2012 season and onwards. 
Carlos Beltrán, another free agent signed to replace Pujols before the 
2012 season, garnered a Player of the Week award in May after hitting six 
home runs within a week; he eventually hit 32 for the season.[85] In the 
playoffs, the Cardinals capitalized on their newfound comeback persona 
against the Washington Nationals in the NLDS: in the final game, Pete Kozma 
drove two runs in the ninth inning to win the series after being down 6-0.[86] 
However, after mounting a 3–1 lead, they fell to the San Francisco Giants 
in the NLCS.[87] After the season, top publications such as ESPN and Baseball 
Prospectus continued to tab the Cardinals farm system as one of the top 
systems in baseball.[84][88][89] Key players from the 2009 draft helped 
net the Cardinals' the Major League's best regular-season record in 2013, 
including first baseman Matt Adams, second baseman Matt Carpenter, starting 
pitchers Joe Kelly and Shelby Miller, and relief pitcher Trevor Rosenthal.[90] 
DeWitt's goal of using the minor league system as the primary source of 
talent for a winning team was starting to be realized.[16] One gamble that 
worked out beyond expectations was moving Carpenter from his natural position 
of third base to second base, where led the Major Leagues in hits (199), 
doubles (55) and runs scored (126). His 55 doubles broke the franchise 
record for left-handed batters Stan Musial previously set in 1953.[91] 
To make up for injuries and ineffectiveness, St. Louis enlisted twenty 
rookies, many of whom filled key positions, including Adams, Rosenthal, 
Miller, Michael Wacha and Carlos Martínez.[92] The Cardinals also set a 
Major League record by hitting .330 as a team with runners in scoring position 
(RISP) (a statistic reliably kept since 1974). First baseman Allen Craig 
led the way at .454, third-highest all-time.[c][93] The team advanced to 
the World Series, where they fell to the Boston Red Sox in six games. The 
2014 Cardinals captured their second straight NL Central title with a 90-72 
record. They defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS, including two 
victories against Clayton Kershaw, who would ultimately win both the NL 
Cy Young and MVP awards for the 2014. This marked their fourth-consecutive 
NLCS appearance, but the Cardinals were unable to defeat the San Francisco 
Giants, who would go on to beat the Kansas City Royals in the World Series.
