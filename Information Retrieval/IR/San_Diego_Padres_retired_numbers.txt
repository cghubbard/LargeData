The San Diego Padres are an American professional baseball team in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) based in San Diego, California. The club was founded 
in 1969 as part of the league's expansion. MLB clubs have retired various 
uniform numbers, ensuring that those numbers are never worn within the 
respective clubs in honor of a particular player or manager of note. The 
Padres no longer issue six numbers that have been retired. The numbers 
are commemorated at the team's home stadium at Petco Park in a display 
at the park entrance as well as in the Ring of Honor. Steve Garvey was 
the first player to have his number retired by the Padres in 1988. The 
first baseman had retired during the offseason, and his No. 6 was being 
worn by Keith Moreland, who switched to No. 7 after presenting Garvey with 
a framed Padres No. 6 jersey during a pregame ceremony.[1] Garvey played 
only five seasons with San Diego, but hit the game-winning two-run home 
run in the bottom of the ninth inning against Lee Smith of the Chicago 
Cubs in Game 4 of the 1984 National League Championship Series (NLCS), 
tying the series before the Padres won the next day.[1][2][3] He was named 
the NLCS Most Valuable Player, and San Diego advanced to their first World 
Series.[4] However, he played 14 of his 19 seasons with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, where he was also more productive, and the retirement of his number 
by San Diego has been heavily debated.[5][6][7] On April 15, 1997, exactly 
50 years after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line, the No. 42 
he wore with the Brooklyn Dodgers was retired throughout major league baseball.[4][8] 
Later that year, Randy Jones's No. 35 was retired by the Padres. He was 
a two-time All-Star in 1975 and 1976, when he was named the NL Comeback 
Player of the Year a year before becoming the club's first Cy Young Award 
winner in 1976.[9] On the day his number was retired, The San Diego Union-Tribune 
wrote that Jones was "the most popular athlete in the history of this city" 
during the mid-1970s until his career was derailed by a severed nerve in 
his left arm.[10] His starts at home would spike attendance by the thousands, 
and the crowd began a tradition on Opening Day in 1976 of greeting him 
with a pregame ovation.[11][12] Dave Winfield was next to have his No. 
31 retired in 2001, when he was also inducted into the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame and Museum. His retirement ceremony also celebrated his decision 
to be the first member of the Hall of Fame to have his plaque depicted 
with him wearing a Padres cap. Winfield played for six teams in his 22-year 
career, spending his first eight seasons in San Diego followed by eight 
with the New York Yankees.[13][14] In 2004, the Padres retired No. 19 in 
honor of Tony Gwynn, who is widely considered the greatest Padres player 
ever.[15][16] He played his entire 20-year career with San Diego and won 
an NL-record eight batting titles.[15] The most recent number to be retired 
was Trevor Hoffman's No. 51 in 2011. He had retired from playing after 
2010, when he left the game as MLB's career leader in saves with 601, including 
552 with the Padres.[17] The Padres' retired numbers are displayed at Petco 
Park at Home Plate Plaza. Fans are allowed to pose for pictures next to 
the aluminum numbers, which are 3 feet 11 inches (1.19 m) high, 5 1⁄3 feet 
(1.6 m) wide, and 1 foot (0.30 m) deep.[18][19] Originally, the numbers 
were atop the batter's eye in center field, until they were relocated in 
2016.[18][20] The numbers were not ready for display in time for the park's 
opening in 2004,[21] but they were unveiled midseason.[a] Also beginning 
in 2016, the numbers are displayed in the Ring of Honor on the upper deck 
façade above the press box behind home plate.[18][22] Prior to moving to 
Petco, the team played at Qualcomm Stadium, where the retired numbers were 
originally displayed on banners hanging from the light towers above the 
left field stands.[23][24] However, Garvey's number was commemorated instead 
on the wall behind the spot in right‑center field where his legendary winning 
home run in the 1984 NLCS cleared the fence, but the number disappeared 
when the stadium was expanded in 1997 and the location was masked by an 
overhang.[4][24][25] It reappeared in 2002 when all the retired numbers 
were moved and inscribed on the outfield fence.[24] v · t · e † Number
