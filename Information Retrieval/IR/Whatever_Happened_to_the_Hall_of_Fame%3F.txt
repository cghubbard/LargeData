Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?: Baseball, Cooperstown, and the 
Politics of Glory is a book by baseball sabermetrician and author Bill 
James. Originally published in 1994 as The Politics of Glory, the book 
covers the unique history of the Baseball Hall of Fame, the evolution of 
its standards, and arguments for individual players in a typically Jamesian, 
stat-driven manner. James drives home early on the heated and biased nature 
of Hall of Fame arguments between fans and writers alike. He states that 
his goal is not to serve individual players or candidates but to "reinforce 
the truth in what other people say" and to "serve the argument itself." 
James primarily uses five of his own statistical methods for his justifications: 
Throughout the book James expresses considerable disapproval of the election 
process, mainly because of the imperfectly defined standards and club-like 
Veterans Committee which, particularly in its early years, allowed players 
of suspect qualifications entrance into the Hall of Fame. As a solution, 
he describes an alternative voting system that would consist of five panelsâ€”one 
each for the media, the fans, the players, baseball executives and professionals, 
and what he calls "baseball scholars". Each panel would be able to nominate 
players individually, but for election a player would need the approval 
of four out of the five panels. While none of his suggestions has been 
implemented, many of his ratings systems have stuck as legitimate metrics 
for measuring a career and for judging the chances of a player making it 
into to the Hall of Fame. Simon & Schuster Inc., Copyright 1994, 1995 by
