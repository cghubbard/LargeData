John Burwell Reed (February 2, 1933 in Silver City, Mississippi) is a former 
professional baseball player. He was an outfielder over parts of three 
seasons (1961â€“1963) with the New York Yankees. Reed was a member of the 
1961 World Series champion Yankees. An alumnus of the University of Mississippi, 
for the Yankees Reed played primarily as a late-inning defensive replacement 
for star outfielder Mickey Mantle. For this reason, he was popularly known 
as "Mickey Mantle's caddy."[1] For his career Reed hit .233 with 1 home 
run and 6 runs batted in in 222 games played (129 at-bats). He is only 
one of seven players in Major League Baseball history with more career 
games played than plate appearances.[2] On June 24, 1962, Reed hit the 
only home run of his career in the top of the 22nd inning, as the Yankees 
beat the Detroit Tigers 9-7 in the longest game in Yankees' history.[3]
