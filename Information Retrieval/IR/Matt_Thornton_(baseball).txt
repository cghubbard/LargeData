Matthew J. Thornton (born September 15, 1976), is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle 
Mariners, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Washington 
Nationals, and San Diego Padres. Thornton is the all-time American League 
leader in holds.[1] In the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, Thornton was 
drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 27th round but chose not sign with 
them. Thornton played college baseball for Grand Valley State University 
and was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the first round as the 22nd 
overall pick in 1998 Major League Baseball draft. Thornton played briefly 
(only pitched 1 inning) with the Single A Everett AquaSox in the Northwest 
League. In 1999 and 2000, Thornton was a starting pitcher with the Wisconsin 
Timber Rattlers in the Midwest League and showed improvement with his ball 
control and accuracy, striking out nearly 1 batter an inning. 2001 was 
probably Thornton's breakout year. Thornton started for San Bernardino 
Stampede in the California League (high-A ball) and had a 14–7 record, 
along with a stellar 2.52 ERA and 192 strikeouts in only 157 innings pitched. 
Thornton was then promoted to AA baseball and played with the San Antonio 
Missions of the Texas League in 2002. Thornton, still a starting pitcher, 
pitched well with a 3.63 ERA and 44 strikeouts in 62 innings pitched. In 
2003, Thornton was briefly sent back down to high-A ball with the Inland 
Empire 66ers of the California League, but was quickly promoted back up 
AA ball with the San Antonio Missions again. He started only 4 games, but 
posted an incredible 0.36 ERA, with a 3–1 record, gave up only 8 hits in 
25.1 innings of work and struck out 18 batters. His performance got him 
promoted that same year to AAA ball with the Tacoma Rainiers in the Pacific 
Coast League. Thornton had a shaky start to his career in Triple-A ball, 
starting 2 games and posting an 0–2 record and an 8.00 ERA. Thornton stayed 
with the Tacoma Rainiers in 2004 and posted a 7–5 record, along with a 
5.20 ERA and 74 strikeouts in 83 innings pitched. Thornton made his MLB 
debut on June 27, 2004, with the Mariners in a game against the San Diego 
Padres, pitching brilliantly over 4 innings, only allowing 3 hits and striking 
out one batter. Throughout the season, the Mariners used Thornton for mostly 
middle reliever duty, except for one game when Thornton started and pitched 
8 innings, allowing 4 runs on 8 hits and walking and striking out 7 batters. 
Thornton finished the 2004 season with a 1–2 record and 4.13 ERA, striking 
out 30 batters in 32.2 innings of work. In 2005, Thornton served his reliever 
duties, pitching in 55 games with 57 innings pitched and posting a 5.21 
ERA and striking out 57. On March 21, 2006, Thornton was traded from the 
Seattle Mariners to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for outfielder Joe 
Borchard. Under the tutelage of pitching coach Don Cooper, Thornton emerged 
as a dominant bullpen force. In the 2006 season, Thornton appeared in 63 
games going 5–3 with a 3.33 ERA and 2 saves. Thornton's 2007 season was 
a little busier before as he made 68 relief appearance with a 4–4 record 
and a 4.79 ERA and 2 saves. Thornton made 74 appearances out of the bullpen 
in 2008 going 5–3 with a 2.67 ERA and 1 save. Thornton made 70 appearances 
in 2009 going 6–3 with a 2.74 ERA and 4 saves. Thornton was selected by 
the coaches' vote to the American League All-Star team in 2010, the first 
All-Star selection of his career. In 2010, he made 61 appearances going 
5–4 with a 2.67 ERA and 8 saves. Appearing in 62 games in 2011, Thornton 
went 2–5 with a 3.32 ERA and 3 saves. 2012 was somewhat unlucky for Thornton 
as his loss column led all relievers in baseball. He went 4–10 with a 3.46 
ERA and 3 saves. Thornton made 40 appearances for the White Sox to start 
the 2013 season by going 0–3 and a 3.86 ERA. In 327 relief appearances 
with the White Sox spanning 299 innings, Thornton compiled with a 3.18 
ERA, including a 2.55 mark in 2010. As of September 12 he led all eligible 
American League relievers with 12.3 strikeouts per nine innings. From 2008–13, 
Thornton pitched in more games than any other left-handed reliever.[2] 
He also holds the record for most holds with a single team, with 164 for 
the White Sox.[3] On July 12, 2013, Thornton was traded to the Boston Red 
Sox for minor league outfielder Brandon Jacobs. The Red Sox also received 
cash considerations.[4] For the rest of the 2013 season with the Red Sox, 
Thornton's playing time was limited due to an oblique strain but made 20 
appearances out of the bullpen going 0–1 with a 3.52 ERA. Overall in 2013, 
combined with both teams, Thornton made 60 total relief appearances going 
0–4 and a 3.74 ERA. The Red Sox finished 97–65, making it to the postseason 
and eventually winning the World Series over the St. Louis Cardinals. Thornton, 
although he did not make any postseason appearances, still received his 
first career championship ring. On January 10, 2014, Thornton signed a 
two-year contract with the New York Yankees worth $7 million.[5][6] In 
46 games for the Yankees, Thornton pitched to a 2.55 ERA. He was put on 
waivers late in the season in what General Manager Brian Cashman said was 
a move for "roster flexibility".[7] In 2014, Thornton reached second on 
the all-time list for holds in Major League Baseball, trailing only Arthur 
Rhodes.[8] Thornton was claimed by the Washington Nationals after being 
waived by the Yankees in August, 2014.[9] He pitched in 18 games for Washington 
down the stretch and 3 games in the 2014 National League Division Series 
against the San Francisco Giants. Thornton made 60 appearances for Washington 
in 2015, compiling a 2.18 ERA with 23 strike-outs in 41 1⁄3 innings. Since 
2005, Thornton had recorded the most innings of any left-handed reliever.[10] 
In 2016, Thornton signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres 
with an invitation to Spring training.[10] On November 8, 2016, Thornton 
announced his retirement from professional baseball.[11] Since transitioning 
to the bullpen with the White Sox, Thornton has scrapped his secondary 
pitches and now relies heavily on a mid- to upper-90s four-seam fastball. 
In 2010,[12] Thornton has thrown the fastball over 90% of the time. He 
also occasionally throws a slider, which he uses most effectively against
