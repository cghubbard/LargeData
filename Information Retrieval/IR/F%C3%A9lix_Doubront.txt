Félix Antonio Doubront [doo-Bront] (born October 23, 1987) is a Venezuelan 
professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Toronto Blue 
Jays, and Oakland Athletics. Doubront was 17 years old when he entered 
the minors in 2005 with the VSL Red Sox (rookie), playing for them one 
year before joining the GCL Red Sox (rookie, 2006), Lowell Spinners (A–, 
2006–2007), Greenville Drive (A, 2007–2008) and Lancaster JetHawks (A+, 
2008). His most productive season came in 2008, when he posted a combined 
13–9 record with a 3.76 ERA in 119 ⅓ innings of work. Doubront made his 
Major League debut on June 18, 2010, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching 
five innings, allowing three earned runs, two walks, and struck out two 
for the win.[1] It was a spot start and Doubront was optioned back to Pawtucket 
after the game.[2] He was recalled on July 5 after Clay Buchholz joined 
a long list of Red Sox players to go on the disabled list.[3] Doubront 
made two more starts and lost both of them before being optioned on July 
17.[4] He was recalled August 6, and returned to the Red Sox roster as 
a reliever.[5] Doubront entered the 2012 season as one of the Red Sox starters, 
beating out Aaron Cook and Alfredo Aceves in spring training.[6] Despite 
slow starts for Josh Beckett, Clay Buchholz and Jon Lester, and Daniel 
Bard's demotion to the minors, Doubront earned five wins against two losses 
in his first ten starts. In June, Doubront took a no hitter into the sixth 
inning against the Miami Marlins. He finished the game giving up two runs 
on three hits and earned the win.[7] He ended the season as a full-time 
starter, with a record of 11-10.[8] Doubront turned in another effective 
season in 2013, posting an 11-6 record over 27 starts[8] for a Red Sox 
team that would win 97 games and a World Championship. Doubront pitched 
out of the bullpen in the postseason, earning his first career postseason 
victory in Game 4 of the 2013 World Series. Doubront struggled to start 
the 2014 season. In May, he left a game after experiencing discomfort in 
his left shoulder, later attributed to hitting it on a car door.[9] He 
would later lose his spot in the starting rotation due to his inconsistency. 
He criticized the decision, stating “First of all, I’m not a reliever... 
They [the Red Sox] know that. They just, you know, it’s hard but I don’t 
know what they’re doing. I know they’re not doing the right thing for me."[10] 
After allowing 6 runs in 2⁄3 of an inning against the Toronto Blue Jays 
on July 28, Doubront had a meeting with manager John Farrell,[11] and two 
days later he was traded. To begin the 2014 season, Doubront's record was 
2-4 with a 6.07 ERA in 17 games (10 starts). On July 30, 2014, Doubront 
was traded to the Chicago Cubs for a player to be named later (Marco Hernández).[12][13] 
He was placed on the disabled list on August 1 without having pitched for 
the Cubs. He was activated from the disabled list on August 30. In 4 more 
starts, Doubront posted a 3.98 ERA with a 2-1 record. Overall in 2014, 
combined with both teams, Doubront's record was 4-5 with a 5.54 ERA in 
21 appearances (14 starts). The Cubs released Doubront on March 28, 2015.[14] 
On April 2, 2015, Doubront signed a minor league contract with the Blue 
Jays, and was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons.[10] On May 13, he 
was activated off the disabled list and made his Bisons debut, pitching 
five shutout innings and allowing only one hit and one walk.[15] Doubront 
was called up by the Blue Jays in early July, and made his debut for the 
team pitching 2 1⁄3 relief innings against the Detroit Tigers on July 3. 
He made his first start for the Blue Jays on July 7, pitching 6 2⁄3 innings 
and getting the win against the Chicago White Sox, 2–1.[16] Doubront was 
designated for assignment on July 29.[17] In 5 games (4 starts), Doubront 
went 1-1 with a 4.76 ERA. On July 31, Doubront was traded to the Oakland 
Athletics for cash considerations.[18][19] Finishing the season with the 
Athletics, Doubront made 11 appearances (8 starts) with a 2-2 record and 
a 5.81 ERA. Overall in 2015, his total record was 3-3 with a 5.50 ERA in 
16 appearances (12 starts). On April 11, 2016, it was revealed that Doubront 
would undergo Tommy John surgery and miss the entire 2016 season.[20] Doubront 
was outrighted to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds on October 7, 2016,[21] 
and he then elected free agency.[22] Doubront's main pitches are a four-seam 
and two-seam fastball that range between 90–95 mph. He also throws a cut 
fastball (87–89), a big curveball (76–80), and a changeup (85–88) that 
is used mostly against right-handed hitters.[23] His deceptive delivery 
results in hitters not being able to pick up the ball until late. The late 
pick-up also makes his fastball look faster to opposing hitters.[citation
