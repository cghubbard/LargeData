Glendale /ˈɡlɛndeɪl/ is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, 
located about nine miles (14 km) northwest from Downtown Phoenix. According 
to the 2010 census, the population of the city is 226,721.[1] In the late 
1800s what is now known as Glendale, Arizona, was all desert. William John 
Murphy, a native of New Hartford, New York who resided in the town of Flagstaff 
in what was then known as the territory of Arizona, was in charge of building 
a 40-mile long Arizona Canal from Granite Reef to New River for the Arizona 
Canal Company. He completed the canal, which would bring water to the desert 
land, in 1885.[3] Murphy was deep in debt, since he had agreed to be paid 
in Arizona Canal Company stock and bonds and land instead of cash.[4] In 
1887, Murphy formed the Arizona Improvement Company. His objective was 
to sell the land and water rights south of the canal. Murphy had to raise 
capital from out of state sources in order to meet payroll and construction 
expenses.[4] Murphy decided to refer to this land as "Glendale". In order 
to develop and interest potential investors and settlers in this new town, 
Murphy decided to provide a better way of access from Phoenix to Glendale 
and ending in the town of Peoria by building an 18 mile long diagonal road 
which he named Grand Avenue. In 1891, Burgess Hadsell worked with Murphy 
to bring 70 Brethren and River Brethren families to Glendale to form a 
temperance colony. Soon settlers, attracted by the town's ban on alcoholic 
beverages, continued to arrive. In 1895, Murphy platted the original town 
site and amended the plat to include a town park and some business lots. 
It was bounded by Lamar Road on the south, 55th Avenue on the east, Myrtle 
Avenue on the north, and 59th Avenue on the west.[5] The construction of 
a railroad from Prescott to Phoenix was made possible with an exchange 
of the right-of-way made by Murphy along Grand Avenue.[3] The railroad 
allowed Glendale settlers to transport goods to the north and easily receive 
building materials. The construction and commercial applications of the 
Beet Sugar Factory in 1906, also contributed to the growth of Glendale. 
Though the operations of the factory only lasted until 1913, it played 
an important role in the increase of immigrant and migrant settlers in 
the city.[6] Glendale bills itself as "Arizona's Antique Capital", with 
support for its claim from both Sunset magazine (2004) and a 1998 article 
in USA Today. Glendale is home to the popular Arrowhead Towne Center mall 
in the northwest part of the city. Glendale also is home to Midwestern 
University, metropolitan Phoenix's first medical school, as well as a major 
post-graduate international business school: the Thunderbird School of 
Global Management. An extension of Valley Metro Rail service is planned 
to serve the city, opening in 2026,[7] reprising a role played by the Phoenix 
Street Railway between 1911 and 1926. Glendale is located at 33°32′19″N
