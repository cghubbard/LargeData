Edwin Lee Wells (June 7, 1900 – May 1, 1986), nicknamed "Satchelfoot",[1][2] 
was an American baseball pitcher. He played professional baseball for 14 
seasons from 1923 to 1936, including 11 seasons in Major League Baseball 
for the Detroit Tigers (1923–1927), New York Yankees (1929–1932), and St. 
Louis Browns (1933–1934). Wells was a left-handed pitcher, with a hard 
fastball and a slow curve. Wells appeared in 291 major league games with 
a 68–69 record and won a World Series championship with the Yankees in 
1932. Wells was born in Ashland, Ohio, in 1900.[1] His father, Loyal Wells, 
was an Iowa native and a farmer. His mother, Elizabeth Wells, was an Ohio 
native.[3] Wells played college baseball for Bethany College in West Virginia.[1] 
Wells played the 1922 season in the minor leagues at Ludington, Michigan 
where he had a 1.93 earned run average (ERA).[citation needed] In 1923, 
Wells made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers on June 16, 1923. 
He appeared in seven games, all in relief, compiling a 5.40 ERA in 10 inning 
pitched.[1] He returned to the Tigers in 1924, appearing in 29 games, 15 
as a starter, with a 6-8 record and 4.06 ERA. In 1925, Wells appeared in 
a career high 36 games, 14 as a starter, and compiled a 6-9 record with 
a 6.18 ERA.[1] Wells had his best season with the Tigers in 1926. He appeared 
in 36 games, including a career high 26 games as a starter and 178 innings 
pitched. He compiled a 12-10 record and 4.15 ERA and led the American League 
with four shutouts.[1] He had two consecutive shutouts in June 1926 during 
a 33-inning scoreless streak.[4] Wells' manager in Detroit was his boyhood 
idol, Ty Cobb. Though one of the greatest hitters of all time, Cobb was, 
by his own account, not a particularly good coach of pitchers. Cobb biographer, 
Richard Bak, recounts a discussion between Cobb and Wells. Wells was having 
a tough time and asked Cobb "what in the name of sense do you think my 
trouble is." Cobb replied "Ed, that's not something I know nothing about 
– pitching."[5] Wells returned to the minor leagues, playing for the Birmingham 
Barons of the Southern Association in 1927 and 1928. He compiled a 13-1 
record with a 2.13 ERA in 1927 and a 25-7 record with a 2.78 ERA in 1928.[6] 
On August 28, 1928, the New York Yankees purchased Wells' contract from 
the Birmingham club subject to the caveat that he would not report to the 
Yankees until the spring of 1929.[7] Wells was assigned the locker between 
Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Wells compiled records of 13–9 in 1929 and 12–3 
in 1930 as a Yankee.[1] In 1929, Wells had the second most wins among Yankees' 
pitchers, trailing only George Pipgras. On August 31, 1929, Wells pitched 
a one-hitter as Babe Ruth hit two home runs.[8] His 1930 winning percentage 
of .800 (12–3) was the second best in the American League. In 1931, his 
winning percentage or .643 was eighth best in the league.[1] In his four 
years with the Yankees, Wells was supported by one of the best batting 
lineups in history, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri, Bill 
Dickey, Bob Meusel, Leo Durocher, and Earle Combs. In April 1933, the St. 
Louis Browns purchased Wells from the Yankees.[9] He played two seasons 
in St. Louis with a combined two-year record of 7–21. He played his final 
major league game on September 17, 1934.[1] In November 1934, the Browns 
sold Wells to the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL).[10] 
He appeared in 39 games for Hollywood in 1935 and compiled a 9–20 record 
with a 4.33 ERA.[6] Wells began the 1936 season with the San Diego Padres 
of the PCL.[6] In June 1936, the Padres traded Wells to the Seattle Indians 
in exchange for Howard Craghead.[11] Wells concluded his playing career 
in 1937 with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association.[6] Wells 
was married to Annie M. Wells, a Tennessee native.[12] After his baseball 
career ended, Wells went into business. In 1940, he lived in Birmingham, 
Alabama, where he was a partner in a wholesale petroleum products.[12]
