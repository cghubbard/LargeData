Xavier Clifford Nady VI[1] (/ɛkˈseɪvi.ər ˈneɪdi/; born November 14, 1978) 
is an American former professional baseball outfielder and first baseman. 
Nady played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Arizona Diamondbacks, Washington 
Nationals, San Francisco Giants, and the San Diego Padres. The St. Louis 
Cardinals originally drafted Nady in the 4th round of the 1997 Major League 
Baseball draft (134th overall) after he was named Northern California Player 
of the Year in his senior year of high school (but he did not sign professionally 
at that time). Nady attended University of California, Berkeley, where 
he set the all-time Pac-10 Conference record for career slugging percentage 
(.729) for the California Golden Bears baseball team. Nady was drafted 
in the second round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft by the San 
Diego Padres (49th overall). Nady signed a major league contract and became 
the 18th player to go directly to the major leagues without making his 
professional debut in the minor leagues since 1965. Nady only appeared 
in one major league game before being sent to the minor leagues. He was 
named Padres Minor League Player of the Year in 2001, also collecting the 
California League's Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year awards 
that season. Nady underwent Tommy John surgery and had limited playing 
time in 2002. In 2003 he again returned to the major league level for part 
of the season, but spent most of his time in the minor leagues. In late 
June 2005 Nady became the first Padre since Greg Vaughn (in 1998) to homer 
in four consecutive games. The Padres traded him to the New York Mets for 
Mike Cameron on November 18, 2005. Nady underwent an emergency appendectomy 
early in the morning on May 30, 2006. As a result, he was placed on the 
15-day disabled list, and returned to the lineup on June 18. On July 30, 
2006, Mets set-up relief pitcher Duaner Sánchez was injured when the cab 
in which he was a passenger was broadsided. The Mets' pitching corps was 
already depleted with star pitcher Pedro Martínez on the disabled list. 
Desperate for pitching, the Mets were forced to give up Nady, their starting 
right fielder, to the Pirates in exchange for pitchers Óliver Pérez and 
Roberto Hernández. On July 26, 2008, the New York Yankees acquired Nady 
and pitcher Dámaso Marte from the Pittsburgh Pirates for José Tábata, Ross 
Ohlendorf, Daniel McCutchen, and Jeff Karstens.[2] Nady had a career-high 
six (6) RBIs as the Yankees came back to beat the Los Angeles Angels on 
August 3, 2008. He finished the 2008 season setting career-highs in home 
runs (25) and runs batted in (97), and had a .305 batting average. Xavier 
Nady signed a one-year contract worth $6.65 million with the Yankees, thus 
avoiding arbitration. On April 14, 2009, Nady suffered a right-elbow injury 
which ultimately required a second Tommy John surgery on July 8, despite 
an initial attempt to rehab the injury. The surgery ended his 2009 season.[3] 
As a result, Nick Swisher took over in Nady's position for the remainder 
of the 2009 season. Nady spent the season (including the postseason) on 
the disabled list until the Yankees won the 2009 World Series against the 
Philadelphia Phillies. He filed for free agency following the conclusion 
of the 2009 season. During his tenure with the Yankees he received a World 
Series ring personally from Brian Cashman when they were in New York playing 
the Mets. On January 29, 2010, Nady signed a one-year contract with the 
Chicago Cubs.[4] On May 16, 2010, Nady hit a game-winning RBI single in 
the 8th inning against the Pirates, as the Cubs won 4–3. He became a free 
agent after the end of the season. Nady signed a one-year contract with 
the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 15, 2010.[5] He became a free agent 
after the end of the season. Nady signed a minor league contract with the 
Washington Nationals on March 18, 2012.[6] He was called up by the Nationals 
on April 4. Following a trip to the Disabled List midway through the season, 
Nady was designated for assignment on July 21, 2012 [7] and released on 
July 29, 2012.[8] Nady was signed to a minor league contract by the San 
Francisco Giants on August 4, 2012, and assigned to their Triple-A affiliate 
in Fresno, California. He made his debut for the San Francisco Giants on 
September 1, 2012, and hit a 3 RBI double against the Cubs in his first 
at bat.[9][10] He was on the Active Roster for the 2012 World Series and 
eventually got his second career championship title after the team performed 
a 4-game sweep against the Detroit Tigers. On December 14, 2012, Nady signed 
a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals.[11] During Spring 
training, Nady struggled first with plantar fasciitis and then sustained 
a partial tear in his right heel. The Royals released him on March 25, 
2013, and then re-signed him to a Minor League contract later the same 
week. He played with their Triple-A team in Omaha.[12] He was released 
on June 29.[13] Nady signed a minor league deal with the Colorado Rockies 
on June 30, 2013.[14] Nady signed a minor league deal with the San Diego 
Padres in January 2014.[15] He was designated for assignment on May 5, 
2014.[16] On May 11, Nady refused his outright assignment and elected free 
agency. On May 27, 2014, Nady signed a minor league deal with the Seattle 
Mariners.[17] He exercised an opt-out clause in his contract on June 26, 
becoming a free agent.[18] On June 20, 2015, Nady began his tenure as the 
hitting coach for the Lake Elsinore Storm, the Single A affiliate of the 
San Diego Padres.[19] Nady's wife, Meredith, had their first child, Xavier 
Henry Nady VII, on July 15, 2008.[20] His second son, Brayden Chase Nady, 
was born on September 8, 2011. His uncle is boxing referee Jay Nady. After 
an intestinal illness prior to spring training in 2007, Nady was tested 
for Crohn's disease due to family history of the disease.[21] The tests 
turned out negative and Nady was instead diagnosed with a minor infection
