As player As manager Michael Shane Spencer (born February 20, 1972) is 
a former Major League Baseball outfielder. In Major League Baseball, he 
played a total of 538 games for the New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Cleveland 
Indians, and New York Mets, compiling 438 hits, 59 home runs, and 242 RBI. 
He was a replacement player during spring training in 1995, crossing the 
picket line during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike. The stocky, baby-faced 
outfielder was first called up to the major leagues in 1998 at the age 
of 26, in the midst of a famously dominant season by the Yankees. He first 
played briefly in April, then endeared himself memorably to fans in September 
by hitting 10 home runs, including 3 grand slams, then a record for Major 
League Rookies (until it was broken by Alexei Ramirez in 2008), in only 
67 at-bats, earning him a spot on the Yankees postseason roster. Spencer 
was nicknamed Roy Hobbs, in reference to the protagonist in The Natural, 
because he hit so many home runs and was older than most rookies when brought 
up to the majors. He hit a long home run in Yankee Stadium during the Divisional 
Series against the Texas Rangers, and the Yankees went on to win the World 
Series. Spencer was not able to maintain that level of success, but became 
a solid role player and stayed with the Yankees through the 2002 season, 
having played in four World Series, winning three. He split the 2003 season 
with Texas and Cleveland and was signed as a free agent in 2004 by the 
Mets. His career did not live up to expectations, though, missing much 
playing time due to injury and striking out too often. In 2005 he signed 
with the Central League's Hanshin Tigers in Japan, appearing in 108 games 
and hitting 9 homers. In 2006, he continued to play for the Tigers, but 
was cut. Major league teams were reluctant to sign him, despite his major 
league experience, because of off-field trouble after leaving the Yankees.[citation

to be on rehab assignment, he was arrested for drunk driving and speeding 
over 97Â mph. He also had problems with Florida police during spring training 
2004. He and teammate Karim Garcia were accused of hitting and kicking 
a pizza delivery man in 2004, though all charges were dropped. After his 
playing career ended, Spencer's career turned to coaching, and he served 
as the hitting coach for the Lake Elsinore Storm, the Single-A affiliate 
of the San Diego Padres, from 2008 until 2012.[1][2] In 2013, he was named
