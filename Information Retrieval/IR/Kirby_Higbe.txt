Walter Kirby Higbe (April 8, 1915 – May 6, 1985) was an American right-handed 
starting pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1937 to 1950. He was a two-time 
All-Star. He was born in and died in Columbia, South Carolina. Higbe began 
his MLB career in 1937 with the Chicago Cubs before being traded to the 
Philadelphia Phillies in the middle of the 1939 season. A hard thrower, 
he was selected to the All-Star team in 1940. Following the season, he 
was traded again, this time to the Brooklyn Dodgers. He enjoyed his most 
successful season in 1941 when he went 22–9, tying teammate Whit Wyatt 
for the league lead in wins and finishing seventh in the MVP voting. After 
the 1943 season, Higbe joined the United States Army. Initially assigned 
to the military police, he soon received training as a rifleman and saw 
combat in Germany. In 1945, Higbe and his fellow soldiers went to the Philippines; 
however, when they arrived there, they learned that Japan had surrendered. 
Nonetheless, he stayed in Manila until March 1946, at which point he finally 
returned to the United States. That year, he posted a 17–8 record and made 
his second All-Star appearance (where he gave up a home run to Ted Williams), 
but the Dodgers lost the National League pennant to the eventual world 
champion St. Louis Cardinals. Higbe stayed in Brooklyn until just after 
the start of the 1947 campaign, when he was traded with four other players 
(one of whom was future Major League manager Gene Mauch) to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in exchange for Al Gionfriddo. While Higbe began the 1947 season 
with a 2–0 record for the eventual NL champion Dodgers he was eventually 
traded because his refusal to play with a black man named Jackie Robinson. 
After his trade to the Pirates he collapsed to 11–17. He was traded during 
the 1949 season, to the New York Giants, with whom he finished his MLB 
career. He played in the minor leagues until 1953. He died in 1985 and 
was buried in Columbia's Elmwood Cemetery. In the 2013 film 42, Higbe is
