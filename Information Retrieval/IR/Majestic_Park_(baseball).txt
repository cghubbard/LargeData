One of the first spring training facilities, Majestic Park (1908–18) was 
the original baseball facility, on a parcel at the corner of Belding Street 
and Carson Street in Hot Springs, Arkansas. The original Majestic Park 
was the spring training site of the Boston Red Sox (and their star pitcher 
Babe Ruth), (1909-1910, 1912–18), Cincinnati Reds (1910-1911), Brooklyn 
Dodgers (1910) and St. Louis Browns (1911). The location later became the 
site of Dean Field (1935-1947) and Jaycee Park (1947-Present). Dean Field 
served as home to the Rogers Hornsby Baseball College. The Hot Springs 
Bathers minor league team and the Chicago White Sox (1948–51) minor league 
Spring Training were held at Jaycee Park, which also hosted the 1952 Negro 
League World Series and a 1953 exhibition game featuring Jackie Robinson.[1][2] 
The site hosted many Major League Spring Training Games and can claim both 
Home Run record holders, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron as among those who have 
played at the site. In 1914, Babe Ruth was just beginning his career (as 
a dominant left-handed pitcher) for the Red Sox, while a young Aaron performed 
there in 1952.[1][3][4] There are four historical plaques at the site today, 
as part of the Hot Springs Historic Baseball Trail as Majestic Field itself, 
Rogers Hornsby, Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron each have historical plaques 
on the site.[5] Often called the "birthplace" of Spring Training baseball, 
Hot Springs first welcomed Major League Baseball in 1886, when the Chicago 
White Stockings (now the Chicago Cubs), brought their coaches and players 
to the city in preparation for the upcoming season.[6][7] Team President 
Albert Spalding (owner of Spalding Sporting Goods) and the team's player/manager 
Cap Anson, thought the city was an ideal training site for the players. 
The first baseball location was Hot Springs Baseball Grounds. Many other 
Major League teams followed and began training in Hot Springs. Needing 
venues for teams to use, Whittington Park was built in 1894, followed by 
Majestic Park (1908) and Fogel Field (1912).[7] 134 members of the Baseball 
Hall of Fame are documented to have trained or played, in Hot Springs.[5] 
In 1908, the Detroit Tigers created the baseball field at the site as a 
place to practice. In 1909, seats were added as Majestic Park was created/enhanced 
by Boston Red Sox owner John I. Taylor, who signed a five-year lease on 
the property as a Spring Training location. Trolleys turned around in front 
of the park and the name came from the Majestic Hotel in Hot Springs.[8] 
Two years later, Taylor would construct Fenway Park for the Red Sox.[9][10][11] 
The Boston Red Sox (1909-1910, 1912–18), Cincinnati Reds (1910-1911), Brooklyn 
Dodgers (1910) and St. Louis Browns (AL) (1911) held Spring Training Camp 
at the original Majestic Park. The Boston Red Sox won four World Series 
Championships, in 1912, 1915, 1916 and 1918, while training at Majestic 
Park. It was in 1918 spring training that the Red Sox first began to use 
Babe Ruth in the field, instead of exclusively at pitcher, to take advantage 
of his hitting.[12] On March 29, 1918, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and 
Southern Railway, owners of the Majestic Park property cancelled the Red 
Sox lease for 1919 to utilize the ballpark area for railroad needs.[13] 
Subsequently, the site has had three major fields. In 1918, the original 
Majestic Park facility was demolished, leading to two other fields on the 
property that had ties to the Major Leagues: Dean Field and Jaycee Park.[14] 
The relocated field was renamed "Dean Field" in 1938 after Hall of Famer 
Dizzy Dean and his brother "Daffy" Paul Dean. Jaycee Park was built on 
the adjacent south side of the lot in 1947 to replace Ban Johnson Park, 
which was located across town.[15][16] When Dean Field (1935-1947) and 
Jaycee Park (1947-Present) evolved, they hosted the Rogers Hornsby Baseball 
College, the George Barr Umpire School, the Chicago White Sox (1949–52) 
Minor League Spring Training and the Hot Springs Bathers as tenants.[17][18] 
The Bathers (1947-1955) were a Cotton States League team that was an affiliate 
of the Chicago White Sox (1947-1951), St. Louis Cardinals (1954) and the 
Kansas City Athletics (1955). Paul Dean Managed the 1954 team.[19][20] 
Among players who played at the site are: Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Hank 
Aaron, Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Jimmie Foxx, Gil Hodges, Harry Hooper, Cy 
Young, Rogers Hornsby, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Herb Pennock, Tris Speaker, 
and Walter Johnson.[14] The Sporting News (1998) ranking of the greatest 
players ever listed: Babe Ruth (1), Ty Cobb (3), Walter Johnson (4), Hank 
Aaron (5) and Rogers Hornsby (9).[21] In 1953, the Hot Springs Boys and 
Girls Club opened their facility on the parcel at 109 W Belding Street, 
where they remain today. Jaycee Park and the surrounding fields are utilized 
for youth baseball. The Roy Doan Baseball School operated from 1934–38, 
attracting hundreds of students and utilized Dean Field and other locations 
throughout Hot Springs.[16] In 1939, Hall of Fame player and manager Rogers 
Hornsby, a former instructor with Roy Doan, started his own Rogers Hornsby 
Baseball College. Hornsby's six-week event ran until 1952, annually attracting 
100-200 prospective professionals and numerous major league scouts. Cy 
Young, Jimmie Foxx, Tris Speaker and Schoolboy Rowe were among the instructors. 
The George Barr Umpire School, the first ever training school for aspiring 
umpires, operated in Hot Springs through 1940, being held in conjunction 
with the baseball schools.[22][23][24][25] Babe Ruth played at Majestic 
Park for six seasons. In 1914, the lefty pitcher first faced Major League 
players as a young minor leaguer. Ruth would make the Red Sox Major League 
roster in 1915 and establish himself as a star pitcher.[26] In 1918, during 
Spring Training, Ruth played first base as an emergency measure in a game 
against Brooklyn at Whittington Field/Ban Johnson Park. The game helped 
change baseball history. Ruth then hit two home runs that day and the second 
was a reported 573-foot home run that landed in the Arkansas Alligator 
Farm across the street. As a result, the Red Sox began to use Ruth as both 
a pitcher and a hitter. With Ruth regularly in the 1918 lineup, he led 
the American League with 11 home runs. He also pitched to a 13-7 record 
and the Red Sox won the World Series.[27] Sold to the New York Yankees 
in 1920, Ruth went on to total 714 Home Runs, a record that stood until 
broken by Hank Aaron.[27][28][29] On October 22, 1953, Jackie Robinson 
played in an exhibition game at Jaycee Park. Having broken Major League 
Baseball's color barrier in 1947, Robinson and the some other Major League 
players (including his Dodgers teammate Gil Hodges) toured, calling themselves 
Jackie Robinson's All-Stars. Robinson's squad played the Negro American 
League All-Stars that day, losing 14-9.[30] Today, there is a plaque at 
the site as part of the "Hot Springs Baseball Historic Trail" honoring 
the event.[31] In 1952, as referenced in a plaque at the site,[32] 18-year 
old shortstop Hank Aaron played for the Negro League Indianapolis Clowns 
against the Birmingham Black Barons at Jaycee Park in the Negro League 
World Series. The World Series was eventually won by the Clowns, with Aaron 
hitting 5 Home runs and batting over .400. The 1952 World Series was also 
the last for the Negro Leagues.[33] Discovered by the Clowns while playing 
for a semi-pro team (Mobile Black Bears) in a game against them, they signed 
Aaron in April, 1951. After his performance in the Negro League World Series, 
Aaron signed with the Boston Braves. Hank Aaron would eventually become 
baseball's all-time Home Run leader, with 755 career Home Runs, breaking 
Babe Ruth's record of 714 on April 8, 1974.[34][35][36] The First Boys 
of Spring is a 2015 documentary on the history of Hot Springs Spring Training. 
The film features Majestic Park items. Produced by Arkansas filmmaker Larry 
Foley, it is narrated by Hot Springs area native, actor Billy Bob Thornton.[37][38][39] 
The Foley documentary was aired nationally on the MLB Network beginning 
in February, 2016.[40] Today, the site is the location of the Hot Springs 
Boys And Girls Club and the Jaycee Park Baseball Complex still hosts baseball 
and softball. The complex now has eight fields, with Jaycee Park remaining 
the largest. At Jaycee Park, original 1st base side cement bleachers are 
still intact.[14][41][42] Today, as part of the Hot Springs Baseball Historic 
Trail, there are four plaques that have been erected at the site: Majestic 
Field, Hank Aaron, Jackie Robinson and Rogers Hornsby: The Majestic plaque 
reads: Majestic Field Built in 1909 as the Boston Red Sox training center, 
this field was also used by the Cincinnati Reds and Brooklyn Dodgers. In 
March 1918, during batting practice, Babe Ruth hit many home runs over 
the distant center field fence, predicting his change from pitcher to slugging 
outfielder. Cy Young, Tris Speaker, Smoky Joe Wood and many others also 
trained here.[43] Hank Aaron's plaque reads: At this field on October 1, 
1952, 18-year old Hank Aaron and the Indianapolis Clowns played in one 
of 12 games of the Negro League World Series against the Birmingham Black 
Barons. During this series, Aaron he batted .402 and slugged five home 
runs leading his team to the championship. “Hammerin’ Hank” eventually 
broke Babe Ruth’s home run record by recording 755 Major League home runs.[44] 
The plaque for Jackie Robinson says the following: One of the most important 
events in Hot Springs history occurred where you are standing. On October 
22, 1953, the legendary Jackie Robinson, played an exhibition game here 
at Jaycee field with Gil Hodges, Luke Easter and other fellow Big Leaguers. 
He is recognized as the man who broke the color barrier in Major League 
baseball.[45] The Rogers Hornsby plaque at the site reads: At the conclusion 
of his historic Hall of Fame career, Rogers “The Rajah” Hornsby returned 
to Hot Springs to oversee the nationally-recognized baseball school. Founded 
here in 1933 by Ray Doan, the school prospered for years, training young 
players from around the country. Instructors included George Sisler, Grover
