Matthew Alexander (born January 30, 1947 in Shreveport, Louisiana)[1] is 
a retired Major League baseball player. He was a utility player for the 
Chicago Cubs (1973-1974), Oakland Athletics (1975-1977) and Pittsburgh 
Pirates (1978-1981). In his later years, Alexander was used mostly as a 
pinch runner by manager Chuck Tanner, and so earned the sobriquet "Matt 
the Scat." Tanner had managed in Oakland in 1976 and brought Alexander 
to Pittsburgh after he became manager of the Pirates. Alexander helped 
the Athletics win the 1975 American League Western Division and the Pirates 
win the 1979 World Series. He played every non-pitching position in his 
major league career except catcher and first base. In nine seasons he played 
in 374 games and had 168 at-bats, 111 runs, 36 hits, 4 doubles, 2 triples, 
4 RBI, 103 stolen bases, 18 walks, a .214 batting average, an .294 on-base 
percentage, .262 slugging percentage, 44 total bases, 8 sacrifice hits 
and 1 intentional walk. He is one of only seven players (excluding pitchers) 
to have played at least 100 games and have more games played than at-bats.[2]
