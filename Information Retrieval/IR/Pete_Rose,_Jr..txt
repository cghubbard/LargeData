Peter Edward "PJ" Rose, Jr. (born November 16, 1969 in Cincinnati) is the 
manager of the Wichita Wingnuts in the American Association of Independent 
Professional Baseball and former professional baseball player. The son 
of Major League Baseball's all-time hits leader Pete Rose, Pete Jr. played 
in the minor leagues most of his career except for a brief stint in 1997 
for the Cincinnati Reds. He was released September 14, 2009, by the York 
Revolution of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In 2011 he 
joined the White Sox coaching staff and became the manager of their Appalachian 
League (rookie league) affiliate in Bristol.[1] In 2012, he moved up to 
the Pioneer League with the affiliate in Great Falls, Montana.[2] After 
one season, he advanced to the lower-A South Atlantic League team in Kannapolis, 
North Carolina. His uniform number is 14. Rose Jr. was often shown on national 
television during his childhood years as a batboy for his father's teams. 
When Rose joined the Phillies in 1979, Pete Jr. spent time with Aaron Boone, 
Bret Boone, Ryan Luzinski, and Mark McGraw in the Phillies clubhouse.[3] 
He appeared on a 1982 Fleer baseball card (#640) titled "Pete & Re-Pete; 
Pete Rose & son" with his father; he was twelve at the time. As a teenager, 
on September 11, 1985, he made an emotional on-field appearance live on 
ESPN to celebrate with his father after Rose Sr. broke Ty Cobb's record 
for most career hits. In his youth, Rose, Jr. played baseball for Bridgetown, 
a suburb of Cincinnati. Rose, Jr. would later become a fixture in baseball's 
minor leagues. Pete Rose Jr began his pro baseball career when he was drafted 
by the Baltimore Orioles and was assigned to the Erie Orioles of the New 
York–Penn League in 1989. In 1990 he joined the class A Frederick Keys 
of the Carolina League. In 1992 he played for the Columbus Red Stixx of 
the class A South Atlantic League. In 1993 he returned to the Carolina 
league this time playing for the Prince William Cannons (Woodbridge, Virginia 
-White Sox affiliate). Rose's best minor league season was in 1997 at Chattanooga, 
for the Chattanooga Lookouts, at age 27. He hit .308 in 112 games with 
25 home runs, 98 RBIs, 31 doubles and 75 runs scored for the Lookouts. 
Later that year, Rose was called up to the Cincinnati Reds for his first 
and only time in the major leagues. He hit only .143 in just 11 games for 
the Reds, but was widely shown on popular sports highlight shows when he 
copied his dad's famous crouching batting stance during the first pitch 
of his first Major League at-bat. The junior Rose's two MLB hits give him 
and his father 4,258 hits, the fourth-most ever by a father and son behind 
Bobby and Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey, Sr. and Jr., and Gus and Buddy Bell. 
(The Roses are also the only father-and-son combo to get over 6,000 hits 
in pro ball, majors and minors, with 6,467 at the end of 2009.) Another 
of Rose's notable feats in the minors was, in 1998, while playing for the 
Indianapolis Indians of the International League, he and three teammates 
hit for the rare "homer cycle" in one inning; Rose opened the inning with 
a solo home run; Jason Williams, three at-bats later, hit a three-run home 
run; four batters later, Glen Murray hit a grand slam; and two hitters 
later, Guillermo Garcia hit a two-run shot to complete the cycle. Rose 
played for the Tigres del Chinandega, a Nicaraguan professional baseball 
team during the 2007–2008 offseason. In 2007 and 2008, he played for the 
Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League. He signed with the 
York Revolution on June 27, 2009, and was released on September 14, 2009. 
On February 16, 2016, Rose was named manager of the Wichita Wingnuts in 
the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball.[4] In November 
2005, Rose Jr. was indicted for distributing gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL) 
to his Lookouts teammates in the late 1990s. GBL is known to be sold under 
the counter at retailers as a sports performance enhancer as well as a 
sedative. When taken orally, GBL is converted to the "date-rape" drug GHB 
[gamma hydroxybutyrate]. Rose Jr. pleaded guilty to this charge on November 
7, 2005, claiming that he distributed GBL to teammates to help them relax 
after games. On May 1, 2006, Rose Jr. was convicted on this charge and 
was sentenced to one month in federal prison, from June 5 to July 5, 2006,[5] 
and house arrest for 5 more months after release from prison. During that 
time, he started with the Bridgeport Bluefish on July 25, 2006 and played 
for them through the remainder of the 2006 season.[6] In December 2007, 
Rose's name was released in Kirk Radomski's unsealed affidavit as an alleged 
user of performance-enhancing drugs. Rose was one of only four baseball 
players listed in the affidavit who was not referenced in the Mitchell 
Report, together with Sid Fernandez, Rick Holyfield, and Ryan Schurman.[7]
