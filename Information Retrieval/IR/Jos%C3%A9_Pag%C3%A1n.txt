José Antonio Pagán Rodríguez (May 5, 1935 – June 7, 2011[1]) was a Puerto 
Rican Major League Baseball player. Pagán made his major league debut with 
the San Francisco Giants on August 8, 1959. He played for the Giants until 
1965, then was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1973 he played his 
final career games with the Philadelphia Phillies. Pagán played for a total 
of 15 years before retiring. His best full season statistically came with 
the Giants in 1962, when he hit .259 and drove in a career high 57 runs. 
He had 73 runs scored that year, which also was a career high, while collecting 
150 hits for the only time in his career. Despite playing part-time for 
the Pirates from 1966–1970, Pagán batted in the .260s twice and the .280s 
twice out of those five years, only hitting under .264 in 1968 when he 
only had 163 at bats. During that time instead of playing short-stop, he 
played mostly third base and left field, but also was used as a key "spare 
part" for the team, playing games at every position in the infield, even 
one at catcher in 1967 for one inning. Pagán appeared in two World Series 
in his career; first at the age of 27 with the Giants, when he was on the 
losing side of the 1962 World Series against the New York Yankees. Despite 
the loss, he hit .368 with a home run in the seven-game series. With the 
Pirates in 1971, after losing the NLCS in 1970, he won his only world series 
and became a hero of the deciding game. In game seven of the 1971 World 
Series between the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles, in the top of the 
8th inning, Pagán hit a double which scored Willie Stargell. This proved 
to be the game's winning run. After his playing career ended, Pagán was 
a Pittsburgh Pirates coach from 1974 to 1978. He also managed teams in 
the Puerto Rican Winter League for several seasons, and lived in Puerto 
Rico before moving his family to Florida in 1999. Pagán died June 7, 2011, 
at his home in Sebring, Florida, a victim of Alzheimer's disease.[2] He 
was 76, and was survived by his wife and two sons.[3] He was held in such 
esteem by the Pittsburgh organization that a moment of silence was observed 
before the Pirates game with the Arizona Diamondbacks at PNC Park that
