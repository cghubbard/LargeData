Carl Harrison "Stump" Merrill (born February 15, 1944 in Brunswick, Maine) 
is a former manager in Major League Baseball who served as manager of the 
New York Yankees in 1990 and 1991. He has spent some thirty years in the 
Yankees organization, and has also managed several of that team's minor 
league affiliates. Merrill began his baseball career as a catcher for the 
Maine Black Bears, where he also played football and earned a degree in 
physical education. He was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 
1966 free-agent draft. He spent that season in the class-A New York–Penn 
League with the Batavia Clippers, and the following year with single-A 
teams in Bakersfield and Eugene. In 1968 and 1969, Merrill was at the double-A 
level with the Reading Phillies, and returned to Eugene in 1970 and 1971 
while that team was at the triple-A level. His playing career ended after 
the 1971 season due to a leg injury. Merrill's managerial record started 
in 1978 with the West Haven Yankees of the Eastern League. He led the team 
to the best overall record in the league that season, and to a first-place 
finish in 1979. When the Yankees moved their affiliation to the Nashville 
Sounds team, Merrill moved as well, guiding the team to two more first-place 
finishes in 1980 and 1981. In 1982 and 1983, Merrill managed the Fort Lauderdale 
Yankees of the Florida State League, winning the league championship in 
1982. For the 1984 season, he jumped to the triple-A level, managing the 
Columbus Clippers to another first-place finish. Merrill joined the New 
York Yankees in 1985 as first-base coach for manager Yogi Berra, but was 
recalled to Columbus in mid-season to again serve as that team's manager. 
He rejoined the major-league team in 1986 as a coach on Lou Piniella's 
staff. During the 1988 season, Merrill was sent to the Albany-Colonie Yankees, 
then the team's double-A affiliate in the Eastern League. He won the league 
title that season, and did so yet again in 1989, guiding the Prince William 
Cannons to the Class A Carolina League championship. In 1990, Merrill began 
the season with Columbus before getting the call to take charge of the 
New York Yankees in June when Bucky Dent was fired as manager. Stump finished 
out what would be one of the worst seasons in Yankees history. The Yankees 
finished 67-95 (49-64 under Merrill), dead last in the American League 
and second-worst in baseball. It was only the fourth time that the storied 
franchise had finished with the worst record in the league. However, Merrill 
was not blamed for the debacle and was brought back for the 1991 season—the 
first time in four years that the Yankees had a single manager for the 
entire season. However, after the Yankees could only improve to 71-91, 
he was replaced by Buck Showalter prior to the 1992 season and served that 
season as a roving minor-league instructor. During 1993 and 1994, Merrill 
once again managed the Columbus Clippers before spending 1995 as a special 
assignment scout. In 1996, Merrill guided the Clippers for a third time, 
winning the International League title, the Governor's Cup. Along the way, 
Merrill won his 1000th game as a manager on August 2, 1996. He remained 
with the Clippers for the 1997 and 1998 seasons before returning to New 
York. In 1999 and 2000, Merrill had a two-year stint as Special Assistant 
to the General Manager under Brian Cashman. He returned to the dugout in 
2001 to manage the Yankees' double-A farm club, then the Norwich Navigators. 
When the Yankees changed affiliations after the 2002 season, Merrill moved 
with the team once more, managing the Trenton Thunder in 2003 and 2004. 
Stump returned to New York in 2005 and was once again named Special Assistant 
to the General Manager.[1] He continues to hold that position as of the 
start of the 2014 season. Note: Year-by-year career details taken from

was given to him in 1963 by Jack Butterfield, his college baseball coach 
at Maine. Merrill recalled of the coining: "In my freshman year, we were 
walking out of the field house. I was with a tall pitcher who was about 
6-foot-5. Just as we were outside, Jack Butterfield was trying to get my 
attention. He hollered at me three or four times and I didn't hear him. 
Finally he said, 'hey Stump you little devil, turn around.' The pitcher
