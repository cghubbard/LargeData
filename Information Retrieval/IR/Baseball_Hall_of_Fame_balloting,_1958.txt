Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1958 followed a system established 
after the 1956 election. The Baseball Writers Association of America voted 
by mail to select from recent major league players and elected no one. 
The BBWAA was voting only in even-number years, with the Veterans Committee 
meeting only in odd years to consider older major league players as well 
as managers, umpires, and executives. For the second time the induction 
ceremonies in Cooperstown were canceled because there was no one to induct. 
Several elements of the current procedure were put into effect. There was 
a printed list of eligible candidates, all of whom had played in at least 
ten major league seasons. Only 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible 
to vote, and they were instructed to vote for up to ten candidates rather 
than ten.[1] The latter revision resulted from complaints by many writers 
in 1956 that there were no longer many viable candidates, a situation which 
had been caused partly by changes governing candidate eligibility. The 
BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1928 or later but not after 
1952, a 25-year span of major league finales. (In a change, they were permitted 
to be active in non-playing roles.) The Hall of Fame would induct any candidate 
who received at least 75% support, as always, which was 200 votes on 266 
ballots returned. A total of 2,367 individual votes were cast, an average 
of 8.90 per ballot. There were about 400 players on the new ballot and 
about 154 received at least one vote.[citation needed] Cross (â€ ) marks 
candidates who last played in 1951 or 1952. Under the new rules they would 
have been on the ballot for the first time, alone among the candidates 
who received votes, but this was the first ballot with a list of players.
