The 1923 New York Yankees season was the 23rd season for this American 
League franchise and its 21st season in New York. Manager Miller Huggins 
led the team to their third straight pennant with a 98–54 record, 16 games 
ahead of the second place Detroit Tigers. The Yankees moved into the now 
famous Yankee Stadium. In the 1923 World Series, they avenged their 1921 
and 1922 losses by defeating the New York Giants in 6 games, 4 games to 
2, and won their first World Series title. The Yankees began their first 
World Championship Season on April 18 as they opened Yankee Stadium. Babe 
Ruth christened the new stadium, with a home run in the Yankees' 4–1 victory 
over the Boston Red Sox. The stadium would later be called "the House that 
Ruth Built". On May 5, the Yankees beat the Philadelphia Athletics 7–2 
at Yankee Stadium to regain first place, the Yankees would never fall back 
in the standings for the rest of the season. Babe Ruth set a Yankees record 
for highest batting average in one season by hitting .393. Ruth also finished 
the season with 41 home runs and 131 RBIs. Ruth's average was not enough 
to win the batting title, as Ruth finished in second place to Detroit's 
Harry Heilmann who batted .403. Ruth reached base safely 379 times during 
the season.[1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches Note:
