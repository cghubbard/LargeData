Thomas David Gorman (March 16, 1919 – August 11, 1986) was an American 
pitcher and umpire in Major League Baseball who pitched five innings in 
four games for the New York Giants in 1939, and went on to serve as a National 
League umpire from 1951 to 1976 and then as a league supervisor. His son 
Brian has been a major league umpire since 1991 and wears the same uniform 
number 9 the elder Gorman wore after the NL began adding numbers to umpire 
uniforms in 1970. Gorman was born in New York City and grew up in the Hell's 
Kitchen neighborhood.[1] He attended high school at the now-defunct Power 
Memorial Academy.[2] After pitching in the minor leagues for three years, 
he served in the Army in Europe as a member of the 16th Infantry during 
World War II.[3] An injury in 1946 ended his playing career; faced with 
the choice of returning to New York City and becoming a plumber, he became 
aware of an umpiring position in the New England League, and although he 
felt he was not cut out to be an umpire, his wife persuaded him to take 
the position for the 1947 season for $180 per month.[3] He later moved 
up to the International League in 1949.[4] He also coached baseball at 
Rice High School in Manhattan, a Christian Brothers school. After joining 
the NL staff, he umpired in the World Series in 1956, 1958, 1963, 1968 
and 1974, serving as crew chief in the last two Series. In 1956, he was 
in left field for Don Larsen's perfect game. In Game 1 of the 1968 Series, 
he called balls and strikes as Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals struck 
out a Series-record 17 Detroit Tigers. He also officiated in the National 
League Championship Series in 1971 and 1975, serving as crew chief in 1971, 
and in the three-game playoff to determine the NL champion in 1959. He 
also worked in the All-Star Game in 1954, 1958, 1960 (both games) and 1969, 
calling balls and strikes for the second half of the second 1960 game. 
During a game in the 1962 season, he discovered that the Giants (by now 
in San Francisco) were having their groundskeepers water down the Candlestick 
Park infield to slow down the Los Angeles Dodgers' Maury Wills; Gorman 
stopped the game for an hour and a half to allow the field to dry out. 
Among the notable games in which he umpired were nine no-hitters, tying 
a record for NL umpires shared by Frank Secory and Augie Donatelli; he 
tied the mark on July 9, 1976, working second base in Larry Dierker's 6-0 
win.[5] Paul Pryor, who also officiated in that game, tied the mark himself 
later that year, and broke it upon working in his 10th no-hitter in 1978. 
Gorman was the home plate umpire for two no-hitters – Warren Spahn's first 
on September 16, 1960,[6] and Bill Stoneman's first on April 17, 1969.[7] 
He was the left field umpire for Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 
World Series.[8] He was the home plate umpire on June 15, 1952 when the 
St. Louis Cardinals set an NL record by overcoming an 11-0 deficit to beat 
the Giants 14-12,[9] and again two weeks later on June 29 when the Chicago 
Cubs scored seven runs with two out in the ninth inning to beat the Cincinnati 
Reds 9-8.[10] Two years later, on August 8, 1954, he was again the home 
plate umpire when the Reds gave up a record 12 runs (all of them unearned) 
after there were two out and no one base in the eighth inning of a 20-7 
loss to the Brooklyn Dodgers; the inning ended only when Gil Hodges' bid 
for a grand slam was caught high off the center field wall.[11] And on 
May 2, 1956, he was again behind the plate as the Giants and Cubs used 
48 players in a 6-5, 17-inning New York victory; Cub Don Hoak struck out 
a record six times against six different pitchers.[12] On April 17, 1964, 
he was the home plate umpire for the inaugural game at Shea Stadium between 
the New York Mets and the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1975 he was honored by 
the Al Somers Umpire School as the Outstanding Umpire of 1974. In his acceptance 
remarks, he said of umpiring, "It's a hard road but a good road. Sometimes 
you'll ask yourself if it's worth it. If you've got the guts and the skills, 
the answer is bound to be yes." He added, "People may come to see ballplayers, 
but there'd be no baseball without good umpires."[3] Mad magazine ran an 
article presenting hypothetical magazines from other planets. In the interplanetary 
version of Sports Illustrated, umpire Tom Gorman explains why he threw 
out a player from Venus: "He opened up ten mouths to me!"[13] Gorman married 
Margaret Fay on October 7, 1944, and they had three sons and a daughter 
before her death c. 1968; they resided in Whitestone, Queens until c. 1965, 
when they moved to Closter, New Jersey, where he would live until his death.[14] 
Prior to moving to Closter, he and Margaret were invited to the White House 
by John F. Kennedy. Kennedy had met Gorman at a banquet where Gorman was 
the guest speaker. Gorman went home and told his wife to buy a new dress 
and she replied, "What for?" and he said, "For our trip to the White House." 
Margaret just ignored him until a White House staff member called their 
home and asked about their travel plans. Gorman was personal friends with 
Bob Hope. Gorman's autobiography Three and Two!, co-written with Hall of 
Fame sportswriter Jerome Holtzman, was published in 1979.[15] Gorman died 
of a heart attack in Closter at age 67,[4] and was buried in George Washington 
Memorial Park in Paramus, in his umpire's uniform with the ball-strike
