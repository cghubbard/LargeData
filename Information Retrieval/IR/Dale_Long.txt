Richard Dale Long (February 6, 1926 – January 27, 1991) was a first baseman 
in professional baseball. Between 1951 and 1963, Long played in Major League 
Baseball with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1951, 1955–1957), St. Louis Browns 
(1951), Chicago Cubs (1957–1959), San Francisco Giants (1960), New York 
Yankees (1960, 1962–1963) and Washington Senators (1961–1962). He batted 
and threw left-handed. A native of Springfield, Missouri, Long turned down 
an offer from the Green Bay Packers to play football, opting instead to 
play baseball. Long spent six seasons in the minor leagues, playing for 
five different organizations before he debuted with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in 1951, ending that season with the St. Louis Browns. After three and 
one-half additional seasons in the minors, Pittsburgh gave Long another 
chance. He hit .291 with 79 RBIs, while collecting double-figure totals 
in extra-base hits with 19 doubles, 13 triples, and 16 home runs. In fact, 
Long led the major leagues in triples (13) in that 1955 season. In 1956, 
Long posted career highs in home runs (27) and RBI (91), made the National 
League All-Star team, and put his name in the record books by hitting eight 
home runs in eight consecutive games between May 19 and May 28. Since then, 
the mark has been matched only by Don Mattingly (1987) and Ken Griffey, 
Jr. (1993), both in the American League. Traded to the Chicago Cubs in 
May 1957, Long belted 55 homers for them in two and a half seasons. In 
1958 he became the first left-handed-throwing catcher since Jiggs Donahue 
in 1902.[1] Long performed this feat in a pair of Cubs losses at Wrigley 
Field, during the first game of a doubleheader versus the Pirates on August 
20 and on September 21 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In both cases, 
he had been shifted from first base in the ninth inning.[2][3] In 1959 
he tied another home run record, when he hit back-to-back pinch-hit homers. 
In 1960 Long divided his playing time between the San Francisco Giants 
and New York Yankees. As a member of the Yankees, he faced his former Pirates 
team in the 1960 World Series. Long played for the Washington Senators 
during 1961 and 1962, but was also on the Yankees team that won the 1962 
World Series over the Giants. He finished his playing career in 1963. Following 
his retirement, Long served as a Yankee coach and later as an umpire in 
minor league baseball. In a 10-season career, Long was a .267 hitter with 
132 home runs and 467 RBI in 1013 games. Dale Long died in Palm Coast,
