Ryan Michael Madson (born August 28, 1980) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played in MLB for the Philadelphia Phillies from 2003 to 
2011 and the Kansas City Royals in 2015, winning a World Series with each 
team. He signed with the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
but never played a game for either team due to injuries. Madson throws 
three types of fastballs. His four-seamer and sinker both average 95 miles 
per hour. He also throws a cut fastball that averages 93 mph, and a circle 
changeup around 85 mph.[1] Madson graduated from Valley View High School 
(Moreno Valley, California) in 1998 with a 3.5 GPA. His uncle, Steve Barr, 
was in the Boston Red Sox and Texas Rangers systems from 1969–1975. Madson 
was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 9th round (254th overall) 
of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. Highly regarded by the Phillies 
ever since they drafted him, Madson got to the major league level for good 
in 2004 as a relief pitcher. In 2005, he started out well, but appeared 
to wear down late in the season, finishing with a 4.14 ERA in 87 innings. 
The Phillies had high hopes for Madson in 2006, when they converted him 
back to a starter, the role he held throughout his minor league career. 
But after struggling as a starter, he was returned to the bullpen to make 
room for Cole Hamels. By 2008 Madson had become part of the "bridge to 
Lidge (closer Brad Lidge)", developing into an outstanding set-up man. 
With a devastating changeup, Madson found increased velocity, hitting as 
high as 97 miles per hour in the NLCS. Madson earned his first playoff 
victory when the Philles defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 4 of 
the 2008 NLCS. He pitched 1 2⁄3 innings, striking out one while allowing 
one hit and one walk. When Brad Lidge was placed on the disabled list on 
June 9, 2009, Ryan Madson was the Phillies' choice for interim closer.[2][3][4] 
Madson got his first save in his new role on June 10, 2009 against the 
New York Mets.[5] In Game 6 of the 2010 National League Championship Series, 
Madson was the losing pitcher when he gave up a solo home run to Juan Uribe 
in the eighth inning of a 3–2 loss to the San Francisco Giants.[6] Madson 
began the 2011 season once again as the Phillies' main set-up reliever. 
However, with Lidge and José Contreras on the disabled list in May 2011, 
Madson was chosen to close for the Phillies. as of August 21, 2011[update], 
Madson converted 23 saves in 25 opportunities and retained the closer role 
even after Lidge returned from the DL in July. Madson finished the season 
with 32 saves, 62 strikeouts, and an ERA of 2.37. A free agent, Madson 
was close to negotiating a four-year, $44 million contract to remain with 
the Phillies, but Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. reneged on 
the verbal agreement and instead signed Jonathan Papelbon to a four-year 
$50 million deal to replace Madson as the team's closer.[7] During the 
2011–12 offseason, Madson agreed to a one-year $8.5 million contract with 
the Cincinnati Reds.[8] Before the end of spring training, Madson had a 
torn ligament in his right elbow, requiring Tommy John surgery, and missed 
the entire 2012 season.[9] He never pitched for the Reds, as he declined 
his option on October 31 and became a free agent.[10] On November 28, 2012, 
Madson agreed to a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[11][12] 
He began the 2013 season on the 15-day disabled list as he attempted to 
recover from the Tommy John surgery.[13] Later in the season, the Angels 
transferred Madson to the 60-day disabled list.[14] He was released on 
August 5 without appearing in a game.[15][16] Madson tried out with several 
teams in January 2014 but received no minor league deals from them, so 
he retired.[7][17] After missing three seasons because of his recovery 
from injury, Madson agreed to a minor league contract with the Kansas City 
Royals in January 2015, that included an invitation to spring training.[18] 
The deal would allow Madson to earn $1 million if he reached the majors 
and made his incentives. Royals advisor Jim Fregosi Jr. had asked Madson 
to tutor high school prospect Johnny Morrell, which eventually led to Madson 
joining the team.[17] Madson formed an effective late game reliever in 
the Royals' bullpen alongside Wade Davis and Kelvin Herrera, after closer 
Greg Holland was forced to undergo Tommy John surgery shortly before the 
postseason.[17] In Game 4 of the 2015 ALDS against the Houston Astros, 
Madson gave up two home runs which put the Royals behind 6-2 with six outs 
until elimination, however the Royals rallied to win the game and eventually 
the series. In Game 6 of the 2015 ALCS against the Toronto Blue Jays, Madson 
surrendered a game-tying two run homer to Jose Bautista, but the Royals 
scored the game winning run in the bottom of the same inning to win the 
game and the series.[7] On December 11, 2015, Madson signed a three-year 
contract worth $22 million with the Oakland Athletics.[19] Madson is married 
to Sarah,[20] with whom he has five children.[21][22] Since his Tommy John 
surgery, at the suggestion of his Anaheim Angels teammates, Madson has 
trained with EVO Ultrafit in Phoenix, Arizona and carries around a POV 
Sport, an electrical modality, with him at all times during the season.[23]
