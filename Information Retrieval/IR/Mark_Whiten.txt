Mark Anthony Whiten (born November 25, 1966) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder and switch-hitter batter who played for the Toronto Blue Jays 
(1990–91), Cleveland Indians (1991–92, 1998–2000), St. Louis Cardinals 
(1993–94), Boston Red Sox (1995), Philadelphia Phillies (1996), Atlanta 
Braves (1996), Seattle Mariners (1996) and New York Yankees (1997). He 
became known by the nickname "Hard-Hittin'" Mark Whiten. Whiten was born 
in Pensacola, Florida. He was selected by Toronto in the 1986 amateur draft 
and made his major league debut in the 1990 season. Whiten was a typical 
up-and-down player. He had one of the best outfield arms in the 1990s. 
He hit for power too, but his mental lapses hurt him in the field and at 
the plate. The Blue Jays had little patience with his development and sent 
him to Cleveland. After two seasons with the Indians he was sent to the 
Cardinals. In his first season with St. Louis Whiten recorded nine outfield 
assists, fifth-best in the National League. On September 7, 1993, he gained 
notability with his performance against the Cincinnati Reds in the second 
game of a doubleheader. Whiten hit four home runs and drove in 12 runs,[1] 
tying the all-time single-game records in both categories in the process. 
He also tied the NL mark for runs batted in in a doubleheader (13). Whiten 
is one of only 16 players in major league baseball history who have hit 
four home runs in one game, and he and Jim Bottomley are the only two players 
with 12 RBIs in one game. During the same season, he belted a 464-foot 
homer into the upper deck at Three Rivers Stadium (August 11), becoming 
the first visiting player to reach the right-field overhang. He finished 
that year with a .253 batting average, to go along with 25 home runs and 
99 runs batted in.[2] Whiten suffered through pulled rib cage muscles early 
at the 1994 season that limited him to play in 92 games. Injuries would 
limit him to no more than 136 games a season. Over the following six seasons, 
he played for six teams, including a second stint with Cleveland.[2] On 
July 31, 1998, Whiten pitched his only inning of professional ball, for 
Cleveland against the Oakland Athletics. He walked two and gave up a hit 
and an earned run, but also struck out the side (which included future 
AL MVP Miguel Tejada). He thus has a perfect career K/9 ratio of 27. In 
his 11-year major-league career, Whiten had a .259 batting average, with 
105 home runs, 423 RBIs, 465 runs scored, 804 hits, 129 doubles, 20 triples, 
and 70 stolen bases in 939 games.[2] He resumed his playing career with
