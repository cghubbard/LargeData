As player As coach David William Eiland (born July 5, 1966) is an American 
former professional baseball player who was a pitcher for ten Major League 
Baseball seasons. Eiland played college baseball for the University of 
Florida and the University of South Florida, and thereafter, played professionally 
for the New York Yankees, San Diego Padres and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He 
is currently the pitching coach of the Kansas City Royals. Eiland was born 
in Dade City, Florida. He graduated from Zephyrhills High School. Eiland 
accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in 
Gainesville, Florida, where he played for the Florida Gators football team. 
He later transferred to the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida, 
and finished his collegiate career playing for the South Florida Bulls 
baseball team. The New York Yankees selected Eiland in the seventh round 
of the 1987 amateur draft and he made his major league pitching debut with 
the Yankees in August 1988. Used mainly in spot chances, Eiland pitched 
in New York for four seasons, winning five games. He was traded to the 
Padres in 1992 and did not win a game in two seasons despite starting in 
nine games. Eiland was sent back to the Yankees in 1995 and played for 
the expansion Devil Rays for three seasons before retiring in 2000. He 
played for 10 seasons, with 12 wins and 27 losses and a career ERA of 5.74. 
During his time with the Devil Rays, Eiland acted as a body double for 
Kevin Costner, who played a starting pitcher and run scorer in the 1999 
film For Love of the Game.[1] Eiland was named International League Pitcher 
of the Year in 1990 while playing for the Columbus Clippers with a 16-5 
record and a 2.87 ERA. He was a 2012 inductee in the International League 
Hall of Fame. Eiland is the only player in Major League Baseball history 
to give up a home run to the first batter he ever faced, (Paul Molitor), 
and hit a home run in his very first at-bat. After retiring in 2000, Eiland 
joined the Yankees organization and worked as a pitching coach in the minor 
leagues. He coached the Gulf Coast Yankees in 2003, the Staten Island Yankees 
in 2004, the Trenton Thunder in 2005 and 2006, and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Yankees in 2007. During his tenure in the Yankees farm system, Eiland oversaw 
the development of prospects including Phil Hughes, Joba Chamberlain, and 
Ian Kennedy. Eiland replaced Ron Guidry as the Yankees pitching coach in 
2008.[2] It was speculated that his relationships with many of the young 
pitchers contributed to him being chosen as the new pitching coach for 
the Yankees.[citation needed] He took a personal leave of absence from 
the Yankees beginning on June 4, 2010, and returned to the team on June 
29. "Besides being in my home, this is the most comfortable place in the 
world for me," he said upon returning. "This is what I do; this is what 
I have a passion for."[3] Eiland was fired on October 25, 2010.[4] Eiland 
then hired agent Burton Rocks.[5] After the 2010 season, Eiland joined 
the Tampa Bay Rays in an advisory role.[6][7] On October 25, 2011, Eiland
