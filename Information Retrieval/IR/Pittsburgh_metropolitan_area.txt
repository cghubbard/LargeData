The Pittsburgh metropolitan area (also called Greater Pittsburgh, Southwestern 
Pennsylvania or the Pittsburgh Tri-State)[2] is the largest population 
center in both the Ohio River Valley and Appalachia. The metropolitan area 
consists of the city of Pittsburgh in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
and surrounding counties. By many definitions the area extends into the 
U.S. states of West Virginia and Ohio.[3][4][5] The larger "tri-state" 
region is defined by the U.S. Census as the combined statistical area (CSA) 
while definitions of the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) are within 
Pennsylvania.[6] The area is renowned for its industries including steel, 
glass and oil; its economy also thrives on healthcare, education, technology, 
robotics, financial services and the film industry. The region is an emergent 
area for oil and natural gas companies' Marcellus shale production.[7] 
The city is headquarters to major global financial institutions including 
PNC Financial Services (the nation's fifth-largest bank), Federated Investors 
and the regional headquarters of BNY Mellon. The region is also the 21st 
largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of 
river cargo for 2011, the port ranked 9th largest in the U.S. when measured 
in domestic trade.[8] Since 1954 suburban Boyers, Pennsylvania has been 
home to one of the world's largest archives including CORBIS images, and 
Federal documents, since 1998 Iron Mountain Incorporated has used the complex 
as its main facility. The U.S. Census Bureau defines the area as both an 
MSA consisting of seven Western Pennsylvania counties anchored by the city 
of Pittsburgh and a twelve county Pittsburgh–New Castle-Weirton CSA with 
2 West Virginia counties and one in Ohio. The MSA definition includes the 
city proper and the Pennsylvania counties of Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, 
Butler, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland. The CSA definition also 
adds the two Western Pennsylvania counties of Lawrence and Indiana, West 
Virginia's Brooke and Hancock as well as Ohio's Jefferson. The MSA had 
a 2012 population of 2,360,733[9] and has a land area of 5,343 sq. miles, 
while the CSA had a 2012 population of 2,661,369.[10] Pittsburgh is part 
of the Great Lakes Megalopolis containing an estimated 54 million people, 
while many residents also consider themselves part of the Mid-Atlantic 
coastal region of Virginia to New York. It is classified as Northeast by 
the U.S. Census with the West Virginia and Ohio components of the CSA being 
classified as South and Mid-west respectively.[11] The entire MSA and CSA 
are within the Congressional Appalachian Regional Commission's definition 
of Appalachia. The area's media market extends to 15 counties in Pennsylvania, 
Maryland and West Virginia. The region is also sometimes defined as reaching 
into the southwestern New York State county of Chautauqua the western Maryland 
counties of Garrett and Allegany as well as the majority of West Virginia, 
all of Western Pennsylvania and the east-central counties of Ohio.[12][13][14] 
Population Since the U.S. Census officially began "metropolitan" definitions 
in 1950, the original counties included were: Allegheny, Westmoreland, 
Washington and Beaver.[15] In 1983 Fayette County was added, in 1993 Butler 
County was added, in 2003 Armstrong County was added with Lawrence County 
as a combined area.[16] 2013 saw the combined area grow as both Indiana 
County, Pennsylvania was added and the counties of Jefferson in Ohio and 
Brooke and Hancock in West Virginia were added.[6] The Regional Industrial 
Development agency (RIDC) has worked across county lines as early as 1967.[17] 
Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) #33 and #254 cover the area.[18] with the RIDC 
managing the centrally located FTZ #33.[19] Note: All census-designated 
places are unincorporated. Allegheny County Townships Armstrong County

0.7% (17,408) were Hispanic or Latino of any race. The median income for 
a household in the MSA was $35,908, and the median income for a family 
was $44,709. Males had a median income of $35,670 versus $23,993 for females. 
The per capita income for the MSA was $18,897. As of the census[20] of 
2000, there were 2,525,730 people, 1,032,596 households, and 678,085 families 
residing within the CSA. The racial makeup of the CSA was 90.0% (2,272,338)

miles (27 km) to the west of downtown Pittsburgh in Findlay.[21] The smaller 
but less crowded Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (IATA: LBE) to the east 
of downtown in Latrobe provide commercial service to the metro area. Pittsburgh 
International was the fortress hub of US Airways from 1952 to 2005 with 
over 500 daily departures to more than 110 destinations in 2000. By 2007, 
fewer than 70 departures to 21 destinations remained.[22] In 2007, US Airways 
did select the airport for its new $25 million, 27,000 sq ft (2,500 m2), 
600-employees-strong Global Flight Operations Center. Since being de-hubbed 
the airport has seen expanded service from JetBlue, Southwest Airlines 
and Delta Air Lines' direct trans-Atlantic service to Paris. Arnold Palmer 
Regional Airport offers commercial service via Spirit Airlines to the Carolinas, 
Florida and Texas. Palmer has had commercially scheduled air service since 
the 1980s. Allegheny County Airport (IATA: AGC) in suburban West Mifflin, 
Pennsylvania, is the area's largest general aviation airport. The historic 
landmark, art deco terminal was the main passenger airport for the area 
until 1952. Allegheny opened in 1931 as the nation's third largest and 
first with "hard surface" runways. Smaller suburban airports serve as private 
plane and corporate jet bases include: The Pittsburgh area is served by 
four main-line Interstates including the Pennsylvania Turnpike (which is 
co-signed with I-76 and in the extreme eastern part of the region also 
co-signed with I-70): As well as several Interstate spur routes: The Port 
of Pittsburgh ranks as the 21st largest port in the United States with 
almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked 9th 
largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[8] The Port Authority 
of Allegheny County (PAT) is the largest mass transit service in the metro 
area and includes a 26-mile subway/light rail system, all serving the central 
core. This system is complimented by BTA and Town & Country to north destinations, 
BCTA and NTC to northwest destinations, WCTA and IndiGo to eastern destinations, 
WCT, MMVTA and FACT serving southern destinations. The University of Pittsburgh 
Transportation System also provides services in the eastern core of the 
metropolitan area while Mountain Line Transit serves the city, western 
suburbs and an express route south to Morgantown, West Virginia. A metro 
map of all fixed route transit routes for Pennsylvania counties can be 
found here.[23] Amtrak serves the region with stops at Penn Station in 
Downtown Pittsburgh, Connellsville to the southeast and both Greensburg 
and Latrobe to the east. Freight rail is a major industry for the area 
with the Pittsburgh Line and the Conway Yard among other infrastructure 
serving the region. Both the Greyhound Lines and Megabus serve the area. 
The Pittsburgh area served as a launchpad for the professionalization of 
both American football and ice hockey in the 1890s and 1900s. The first 
professional player (William Heffelfinger) played for a Pittsburgh football 
team in 1892, which was followed by the first open professional (John Brallier), 
the first all-professional team (the Latrobe Athletic Association), and 
a participant in the first all-professional league (the Pittsburgh Stars 
of the first National Football League). In the case of ice hockey, the 
Western Pennsylvania Hockey League was the first hockey league to pay its 
players in 1901, eventually merging into the first fully pro league, the 
International Professional Hockey League, in 1904. Professional hockey 
in Pennsylvania predated the professionalization of the game in Canada 
(where it eventually came to dominate in the early 20th century) by four 
years. Today, the region is home to three "major league" franchises: It 
also has several minor league teams including: NCAA Division I sports also 
play a key role in the region with the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne 
University fielding football and basketball teams. Robert Morris University 
also fields Division I basketball and football teams as well as Division 
I ice hockey. Golf in the metro area boasts such courses as Oakmont Country 
Club, which has hosted the U.S. Open a record eight times, and Foxburg 
Country Club the oldest continuous club in the U.S. Such tournaments as 
the 84 Lumber Classic, Pittsburgh Senior Open and the current Mylan Classic 
call the region home. Area courses have also hosted multiple PGA Championships, 
LPGA Championships, U.S. Women's Opens and Ryder Cup matches. Annual sporting 
events include the Head of the Ohio crew race, Three Rivers Regatta, Pittsburgh 
Vintage Grand Prix, and the Pittsburgh Marathon. The regions rivers have 
hosted the Bassmaster Classic and Forrest Wood Cup and the city has enjoyed 
having one of only two teams to host the Major League Baseball All Star 
Game a record eight times. The area has also hosted the NHL All Star Game, 
NHL Winter Classic, Senior Olympics, NHL Entry Draft, AHL All Star Game, 
NCAA Tournament and has been selected as the site of the 2012 Frozen Four. 
Winter in the region sees sport continue at such rinks at PPG Place and 
North Park as well as area ski resorts like Boyce Park, Seven Springs Mountain 
Resort, Hidden Valley, Laurel Mountain and Wisp. The largest school district 
in the area is the Pittsburgh Public Schools with the school districts 
of Allegheny County also boasting large student bodies. Many private schools 
also serve the core county of Allegheny. Public districts in Westmoreland, 
Washington, Private Schools exist in surrounding counties such as Westmoreland, 
Washington, Several Pittsburgh area colleges and universities serve the 
region. The following area codes serve the metropolitan area: Pittsburgh 
narrowly falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as 
defined by multiple agencies of the US Government, but the Pittsburgh Combined 
Statistical Area extends into both the Southern United States (West Virginia) 
and the Midwestern United States (Ohio) due to the fact that the borders 
of these three regions meet only 30 miles (48 km) from the city proper. 
Pittsburgh also belongs to the Great Lakes Megalopolis, a collection of 
primarily Midwestern cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Cleveland, reflecting 
Pittsburgh's stronger socio-economic connections to Ohio than eastern Pennsylvania.[24][25] 
Pittsburgh also falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the 
Appalachian Regional Commission. The city has long been characterized as 
the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia",[26]:167 a designation 
which made it an anomaly compared to much of Appalachia in the 20th century, 
which was traditionally characterized as southern, rural, and economically 
distressed.[26]:167 In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has now been 
characterized as the "Paris of Appalachia",[27][28][29][30][31] recognizing 
the city's cultural resources such as the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, 
the Pittsburgh Symphony, and the Pittsburgh Opera, as well as its service 
economy built upon education, healthcare, and technology. Pittsburgh is 
by far the largest metropolitan area in Appalachia proper. The next largest 
metropolitan area is Birmingham, Alabama, which is about half of Pittsburgh's 
size. While the city's status as an Appalachian city is largely undisputed, 
the city has been described as not belonging culturally to any of the major 
"regions" of the United States such as the Midwest or the East Coast.[27]:13 
Pittsburgh lies only a few dozen miles from the spot where the physical 
boundaries of three major regions of the United States converge (40°38′19.67″N 
80°31′8.37″W﻿ / ﻿40.6387972°N 80.5189917°W﻿ / 40.6387972; -80.5189917), 
namely the Northeastern United States, the Midwestern United States, and 
the Southern United States,[32] and in straddling these boundaries, it 
borrows cultural influences from a variety of sources.[citation needed] 
Joseph Scarpaci, professor emeritus of geography at Virginia Tech, has 
described Pittsburgh as having "one foot in the East...and the other in 
the Midwest".[26]:1 Barbara Johnstone, professor of rhetoric and linguistics 
at Carnegie Mellon University, ascribes this isolation and idiosyncratic 
cultural identity of the region to the difficulty of moving through the 
Allegheny Mountains and the Allegheny Plateau: "The Pittsburgh area was 
sort of isolated. It was very hard to get back and forth across the mountains. 
There's always been a sense that Pittsburgh was kind of a place unto itself—not 
really southern, not really Midwestern, not really part of Pennsylvania. 
People just didn't move very much."[33] In his 2009 book The Paris of Appalachia, 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Brian O'Neill meditates on this aspect of 
Pittsburgh's regional and cultural ambiguity. The title of the book is 
intentionally provocative: "The Paris of Appalachia" some have called Pittsburgh 
derisively, because it's still the largest city along this gorgeous mountain 
chain that needs a better press agent. I've long felt we should embrace 
that title, though few are with me. Several tried to talk me out of slapping 
it on the cover, but were we called "The Paris of the Rockies," we wouldn't 
run from it. Sometimes we're so afraid of what others think, we're afraid 
to say who we are. This city is not Midwestern. It's not East Coast. It's 
just Pittsburgh, and there's no place like it. That's both its blessing 
and its curse.[27]:13 Historically, Pittsburgh has been grouped in the 
"rust belt";[34] however, reflective of the rebound of the region within 
the last generation, the metro area has come to be associated with the 
newly rebranded "Great Lakes Basin" gaining representation in the Great 
Lakes Metro Chamber Coalition,[35] while the "America 2050" organization 
claims that Pittsburgh is one of the "principal cities" of the Great Lakes 
Megalopolis[36] despite the fact that the city is about 120 miles (190 km) 
from Lake Erie. Pittsburgh's association with the Great Lakes region is 
due in part to its economic, demographic and commuter connections to Great 
Lakes cities like Cleveland, Erie, Toledo and even Detroit. Christopher 
Briem, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh's University Center 
for Social and Urban Research, has noted that southwestern Pennsylvania 
is "far more interconnected" with northeastern Ohio than it is with the 
eastern half of Pennsylvania, and that the industries of Pittsburgh are 
primarily linked to Ohioan cities such as Youngstown, Akron, and Cleveland, 
not to Pennsylvanian cities such as Allentown, Scranton, or Philadelphia.[24] 
He notes that, conversely, the population centers of northeastern Ohio 
are primarily connected with Pittsburgh and only secondarily connected 
to the state capital of Columbus. Briem argues that "In so many ways the 
state boundaries we think of as important are no more than lines on a map."[24] 
In recognizing their economic interdependence, Briem has popularized the 
term "Cleveburgh" to refer collectively to the cities of Cleveland and 
Pittsburgh, along with the smaller towns dotting the corridor of I-76 between 
the cities.[24][37][38][39][40] Robert Lang and Arthur Nelson of the Metropolitan 
Institute at Virginia Tech also identify the region between Cleveland and 
Pittsburgh as being an interconnected "megapolitan area" and refer to it 
as the "Steel Corridor".[41] The scope of Pittsburgh's metropolitan influence 
on the surrounding area is of more than just academic interest. For example, 
the organization "Power of 32" focuses on addressing the issues of the 
32-county metropolitan area roughly centered on Pittsburgh—a region which 
includes portions of Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland. Despite 
being divided into four states and three Census Bureau—defined regions, 
this area functions as an interdependent economic region.[42] Power of 
32 asserts that "[t]he 32-county region has common challenges and opportunities 
in the global economy, but is larger than the scope of any one single political 
entity, authority, or organization",[43] and that "[t]he only thing we 
find at artificial boundaries are problems, not solutions."[44] Power of 
32 is supported in its efforts by "30 to 40 other foundations"[42] and 
funded by several Pittsburgh-area endowments including the Richard King 
Mellon Foundation and The Heinz Endowments.[42] Pittsburgh anchors Northern 
Appalachia. The Northeast, Midwest & South meet at the metro area. The 
Great Lakes Megalopolis includes Pittsburgh. "Cleve-burgh": an emerging 
metroplex. Coordinates: 40°25′16″N 79°59′02″W﻿ / ﻿40.421°N 79.984°W﻿ /
