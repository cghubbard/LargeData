The Southwest Region is one of eight United States regions that currently 
send teams to the Little League World Series, the largest youth baseball 
competition in the world. The region's participation in the LLWS dates 
back to 1957, when it was known as the South Region. However, when the 
LLWS was expanded in 2001 from eight teams (four U.S. teams and four "International" 
teams from the rest of the world) to 16 teams (eight U.S. and eight International), 
the Southern Region was split into the Southeast and Southwest Regions. 
Regional headquarters are located in Waco, Texas. The Southwest Region 
is made up of eight districts in seven states. In 2001, the region was 
briefly called the Gulf States region. Alabama and Tennessee competed in 
this region before joining the Southeast Region the following year. The
