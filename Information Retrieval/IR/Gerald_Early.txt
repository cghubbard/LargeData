Early was born April 21, 1952, in Philadelphia, the son of Henry Early 
and Florence Fernandez Oglesby. His father, a baker, died when Early was 
nine months old, leaving his mother, a preschool teacher, to raise him 
and his two sisters on her own. Living in a poor area of the city, Early 
grew up befriending members of the Fifth and the South Street gangs, though 
he never became a member himself. Instead he focused on scholarly pursuits, 
graduating cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania in 1974. During 
Early's undergraduate years, he was introduced to the writings of Amiri 
Baraka and later credited the poet and playwright with influencing his 
own work. Early developed much of his writing style through involvement 
with the university newspaper. Ironically, his first major piece was a 
journalistic foray into the gang-related murder of a cousin.[3] After earning 
his B.A., Early returned to Philadelphia, where he became employed by the 
city government. He also spent six months monitoring gang activities through 
the Crisis Intervention Network before resuming his course work at Cornell 
University, where he eventually earned a doctorate in English literature 
in 1982. Early landed his first teaching job as an assistant professor 
of black studies at St. Louis's Washington University in 1982. He would 
steadily rise to a full professorship in both the English and the renamed 
African and Afro-American studies departments by 1990.[4] On August 27, 
1977, Early married Ida Haynes, a college administrator. They have two 
children, Linnet Kristen Haynes Early and Rosalind Lenora Haynes Early. 
Early won a Whiting Award in 1988 for creative nonfiction. For his essay 
collection The Culture of Bruising: Essays on Prizefighting, Literature, 
and Modern American Culture, he won the 1994 National Book Critics Circle 
Award. He has been nominated for the Grammy Award Best Album Notes twice 
in 2001 for Yes I Can! The Sammy Davis Jr. Story and in 2002 for Rhapsodies 
in Black: Music and Words From The Harlem Renaissance. On September 5, 
2007, Professor Early was honored by Washington University with the unveiling 
of a portrait painted by Jamie Adams which hangs in the Journals Reading 
Room of the university's Olin Library. In 2013 Gerald Early was inducted
