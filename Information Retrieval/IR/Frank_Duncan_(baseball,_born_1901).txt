Frank Duncan (born February 14, 1901 in Kansas City, Missouri – December 
4, 1973 in Kansas City, Missouri) was a baseball player in the Negro Leagues 
from 1920 to 1948. He was primarily a catcher for the Kansas City Monarchs, 
handling their pitching staff from 1921 through 1934 as the team won five 
pennants between 1923 and 1931. While playing part-time, he managed the 
Monarchs to two pennants in 1942 and 1946.[2] He caught two no-hitters 
with the Monarchs, in 1923 and 1929. Duncan broke in with the 1920 Chicago 
Giants, forcing John Beckwith to move from catcher to shortstop. He hit 
just .161. In 1921, Duncan moved to the Monarchs and batted .250/.295/.277 
(BA/OBP/SLG) for the combined season. In 1922, Duncan improved to .235/.317/.313 
at the plate and was credited with 22 sacrifice hits to lead the Negro 
National League in that category. He led the NNL's catchers in fielding 
percentage (.984) and assists (91).[3] In 1923, he batted .257/.332/.332 
and fielded .960 while batting second for the pennant-winning Monarchs. 
That winter, he played for one of the most famous Cuban Winter League teams 
ever, the 1923–1924 Santa Clara Leopardos. He batted .336 and slugged .401 
for the club, which won the pennant with a 36–11 record. Duncan batted 
.267/~.358/.332 in 1924, helping the Monarchs to the second of their three 
consecutive pennants. He was batted only .139 (5 for 36) in the 1924 Colored 
World Series, won by the Monarchs in 10 games. Despite the low batting 
average, one of his most memorable moments as a player came in Game Eight 
when he singled the tying and winning runs home in a dramatic ninth-inning 
comeback victory by his team. The play was notable because veteran catcher 
Louis Santop had dropped Duncan's foul pop-up one pitch before, and his 
key hit went through shortstop Biz Mackey's legs. Both Mackey and Santop 
were considered great defensive players, though Santop's best defensive 
days were behind him. Duncan hit only .200 for Santa Clara in the winter 
of 1924. In 1925, the catcher slipped to .222 for the Monarchs. He went 
3 for 21 in the playoffs and 4 for 21 in the 1925 Negro World Series. He 
again had a huge moment in the series, with a great tag on Otto Briggs 
at home in the 11th inning of game one. Duncan batted .247 in 1926. In 
June, he was in the middle of a fight when he collided with John Hines. 
During the melee, he was struck on the back of the head by the butt of 
a policeman's pistol. While Duncan was down, Jelly Gardner kicked him in 
the mouth with his spikes. In the winter of 1926–1927, Duncan batted .276 
and slugged .328 in the California Winter League. In 1927, the Kansas City 
native hit .395 while splitting time with T.J. Young. Had he qualified, 
he would have ranked 4th in the NNL in batting average. Duncan took part 
in a memorable tour of Japan by Negro League players that year; the blackball 
stars won 23 games, tied once and lost none. The fall trip included stops 
in Hawaii, China, Russia and the Philippines. In the winter of 1927-1928, 
Duncan was 8 for 21 with two doubles in the California Winter League. In 
1928, Duncan batted just .182. With Cienfuegos that winter, he hit .265 
and slugged .434. His 8 stolen bases were second on the team behind Cool 
Papa Bell. Duncan hit .346 in 1929. That winter, he hit .250 for Cienfuegos 
and slugged .369. Duncan hit .370 in 1930, tying for third in the NNL behind 
only Mule Suttles and Willie Wells. He was 5 for 13 with a triple for Cienfuegos 
in the 1930 CWL before the season was cut short. In the Campeonato Unico 
that replaced the CWL that year, he hit .276 with no extra-base hits in 
29 AB for the Cienfuegos club. Duncan hit .297 in 1931 in the Negro leagues. 
He moved to the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1932 but only managed a .211 mark. 
In 1935, Duncan had a .102 batting average for the New York Cubans. He 
followed with a .239 average in 1936 and was 0 for 3 in an exhibition against 
the Cincinnati Reds. In 1937, Duncan returned to Kansas City and hit .173. 
In the final postseason series, he was 3 for 17. He went 2 for 12 in exhibitions 
against white major leaguers that fall. Duncan came back in 1938. He hit 
.247 for Kansas City and .378 for Chicago. His 4 triples led the Negro 
American League. In the 1938 East-West Game, he was 0 for 1 with a walk 
as the West's starting catcher and #7 hitter in a 5–4 win. He started a 
double play with a pick-off of Sammy T. Hughes during the game. Larry Brown 
took over behind the plate for Duncan. In 1939, Duncan played for a semipro 
team. Duncan played alongside his son, pitcher Frank Duncan III, in 1941, 
and they are thought to have been the first father-son battery in professional 
baseball history. Duncan went 0 for 4 against Bob Feller and Ken Heintzelman 
in exhibitions in 1941. He became Kansas City's playing manager in 1942, 
leading them to a league title, and then won the 1942 Negro World Series, 
sweeping the Homestead Grays four games to none. Duncan was drafted into 
the US Army for World War II after the 1942 season. He became sergeant 
in the 371st Infantry Regiment of the 92nd Division. He showed off his 
precision by hitting 31 bull's eyes in 32 shots in rapid firing from 200 
yards, a marksmanship record. He was honorably discharged early in 1943 
and returned to manage the Monachs in 1943 before the season began. In 
1944, at 43 years old, he hit .144, and the Monarchs finished last for 
the first time in their history, having lost much of their best players 
to the war. He was Jackie Robinson's first professional manager in 1945. 
He led Kansas City to the 1946 Negro World Series, which they lost in seven 
games to the Newark Eagles. He retired from managing after the 1947 season, 
turning over managerial responsibilities to Buck O'Neil. He umpired in 
the NAL for a while after that. He also ran a tavern in retirement. Duncan 
was married to noted blues singer Julia Lee. She frequently performed in 
all-white nightclubs, and Duncan had to sit with the orchestra, pretending
