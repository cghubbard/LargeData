As player As coach As manager Edgar Frederick "Ned" "Dutch" Yost III (/ˈjoʊst/; 
born August 19, 1954) is a former Major League Baseball catcher and current 
manager of the Kansas City Royals. He previously managed the Milwaukee 
Brewers, and played for the Brewers, Texas Rangers, and Montreal Expos. 
Yost was born on California's North Coast in Eureka. Yost attended and 
played baseball at Dublin High School in Dublin, California. He had significant 
difficulty hitting prior to his junior and senior years, yet improved after 
building physical strength by working as a pot-scrubber at a Kentucky Fried 
Chicken restaurant.[1] After high school, Yost attended Chabot Junior College 
in Hayward, California, where he walked on to Chabot's baseball team after 
receiving no offers to play for other schools. Yost, as a player, was used 
primarily as a backup catcher for the Brewers from 1980 to 1983 (which 
included the 1982 World Series), and then spent a year with the Texas Rangers 
(1984; he played a career-high 80 games with the Rangers, hitting .182) 
and played 5 games for the Montreal Expos (1985) before retiring. He never 
had more than 242 at bats in a season. He ended his career with a .212 
batting average, and .237 on-base percentage, in 605 at bats. He had a 
.982 fielding percentage (the league average was .987).[2] Yost briefly 
had a second career as a taxidermist in Jackson, Mississippi, in between 
his playing days and coaching days.[3] After a brief stint managing in 
the minors, Yost joined the Atlanta Braves organization. He was the Braves' 
bullpen coach from 1991 to 1998 and earned a ring as a part of the 1995 
World Series championship team. In 1999 Yost became the Braves' third base 
coach, a position he maintained until the end of the 2002 season. On October 
29, 2002, Yost was named the Brewers manager, succeeding Jerry Royster. 
National League manager Tony La Russa named Yost to be part of his coaching 
staff for the 2005 MLB All-Star Game. Yost's tenure oversaw a revitalization 
of the Brewers franchise, leading them from losing records to championship 
contender. However, his teams were plagued by inconsistency, most notably 
squandering a large lead in the division during the 2007 season and a significant 
advantage in the wild card race in 2008. Yost finished seventh in voting 
for Manager of the Year in 2007. While he wore No. 5 on his jersey as a 
player with the Brewers, as a manager, he wore No. 3 on his jersey as a 
tribute to his close friend, deceased NASCAR racer and baseball fan Dale 
Earnhardt.[4] Yost's managing came under fire late in 2007.[5] During the 
season, the Brewers held an 8-1/2 game division lead over the Cubs by June 
23 but failed to hold on to the advantage, finishing two games behind the 
Cubs. Yost's bullpen management, lineup strategies, and bench management 
were blamed. He also was thrown out of three games in the last week of 
the season.[6] General Manager Doug Melvin announced, however, that Yost 
would return for the 2008 season. He was fired as manager on September 
15, 2008, with 12 games remaining in the regular season. The Brewers were 
still in the playoff race, but had lost 11 of their last 14 games. Yost 
finished his Brewers career with a 457–502 record.[7] Third-base coach 
Dale Sveum was named his interim replacement and served until the end of 
the season, leading the Brewers to clinch the wild card spot on the last 
day of the season for their first trip to the postseason since 1982 when 
they made it to the World Series. They were eliminated by the Phillies, 
the eventual World Series champions, in four games. Following the 2009 
season, Yost was a candidate to be the next manager of the Houston Astros,[8] 
however the position was filled by Brad Mills.[9] On May 13, 2010, Yost 
was named manager of the Kansas City Royals, replacing Trey Hillman. Prior 
to the 2012 season, the Royals signed Yost to a contract extension through 
the 2013 season. In the 2013 season, Yost posted an 86-76 record with the 
Royals,[7] their first winning season since 2003. In 2014, Yost led the 
Royals to their first playoff berth since 1985, finishing 89-73. Yost's 
Royals swept the Baltimore Orioles in four games in the American League 
Championship Series to give the team its first American League pennant 
in 29 years. In doing so, the team became the first team in MLB history 
to win their first eight consecutive playoff games.[10] The Royals were 
then defeated four games to three in the 2014 World Series by the San Francisco 
Giants. Yost would go on to finish third in the voting for 2014 Manager 
of the Year[11] and signed a one-year contract extension in the offseason 
to stay with the club through 2016.[12] At the start of the 2015 season, 
Yost led the team to a 7-0 start marking the second best start to a season 
in team history. (The team's longest consecutive opening win streak, in 
2003, was 9 games.) On April 19, Yost was one of five Royals (also pitching 
coach Dave Eiland, bench coach Don Wakamatsu, pitcher Kelvin Herrera and 
shortstop Alcides Escobar) to be ejected in a game against the Oakland 
Athletics. Two games prior, Escobar had been injured following an attempt 
by A's third baseman Brett Lawrie to break up a double play. Considering 
the slide a dirty one, Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura hit Lawrie in the 
elbow the following game and was immediately ejected. In the series finale, 
A's pitcher Scott Kazmir hit Lorenzo Cain in the foot and warnings were 
given. Yost and Eiland were immediately ejected for arguing. Later in the 
8th inning, Kelvin Herrera threw a 100 mph fastball behind Lawrie and a 
trio of ejections followed (Herrera, Wakamatsu and Escobar). The Royals 
would end up winning the game 4-2 despite the ejections.[13] During the 
2015 season (his fifth full season as manager) Yost became the longest-tenured 
manager in Royals history. [14] He would later also become the winningest 
manager in Royals club history after a 3-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers 
on June 18, 2015.[15] On the final day of the 2015 regular season, Yost's 
Royals clinched the best record in the American League at 95-67, giving 
Kansas City home field advantage throughout the playoffs, including the 
World Series by virtue of the AL's victory in the All-Star Game.[16] The 
Royals would defeat the Houston Astros, Toronto Blue Jays and ultimately 
the New York Mets to bring Kansas City its first World Series championship 
since 1985, and Yost his first title as a manager. On August 18, 2015, 
MLB gave Yost a warning about using an Apple Watch he received from the 
MLB because of MLB's policy of no internet enabled devices in the dugout 
during gametime. Yost received the watch as a present from MLB for winning 
the 2014 AL pennant. [17] Yost later told a local radio station that MLB 
had rescinded the warning after learning that the networking features of 
the Apple Watch were only available with an active iPhone connection. [18] 
Yost has often been criticized for his idiosyncratic decision-making and 
rejection of Sabermetrics, but insists his methods work.[19] On February 
18, 2016, the Royals announced that Yost had signed an extension with the 
team, keeping him as manager through the 2018 season. [20] On September 
17, 2016, Yost won his 1,000th game managed for the Royals and Brewers, 
in a Royals 3-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox. [21] While also adding 
to his total as the winning-est manager in Royals franchise history (543 
Wins), ahead of Whitey Herzog (410 Wins) and Dick Howser (404 Wins). [22] 
Yost and his wife Deborah have four children and live in rural Georgia 
during the off-season. One of his sons, Ned Yost IV, serves as the hitting 
coach for the Brevard County Manatees, Class A Advanced minor league affiliate 
of the Milwaukee Brewers. Prior to becoming a coach in 2009, the younger 
Yost played first base for the Class-A Brevard County Manatees in 2007, 
his third season in the minors, hitting .248 with a .283 slugging percentage.[23]
