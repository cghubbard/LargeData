James Wear "Bug" Holliday (February 8, 1867 – February 15, 1910) was an 
American center fielder in Major League Baseball for ten seasons, in the 
1885 World Series and from 1889 through 1898. He holds the distinction 
of being the first player to make his major league debut in post-season 
play, with the Chicago White Stockings in 1885. He played the rest of his 
career with the Cincinnati Reds, both when they were in the American Association 
and in the National League. He twice led the league in home runs, and was 
among the leaders in various other offensive categories throughout his 
career. After his playing career was over, he was an umpire for one season. 
Holliday was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and became the first player in 
major league history to make his debut in the post-season when he was called 
up, at the age of 18, by the Chicago White Stockings when they needed another 
outfielder after Game 4 of the 1885 World Series.[1] He played in one game, 
and had no hits in four at bats.[2] The distinction has since been matched 
by Mark Kiger, who played in the 2006 American League Championship Series 
for the Oakland Athletics as a defensive replacement, and Raúl Mondesí, 
pinch-hitting for Luke Hochevar in Game 3 of the 2015 World Series for 
the Kansas City Royals. Holliday made his regular-season major league debut 
in 1889 for the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association.[3] 
In his first season with the Red Stockings, he led the league in home runs 
with 19, while finishing in the top ten in many offensive categories. He 
was fifth in batting average with .321, fifth in runs batted in (RBIs) 
with 104, third in hits with 181, and ninth in doubles with 28.[2] Before 
the 1890 season, the Red Stockings transferred their team over to the National 
League and officially became the Reds.[2] Holliday picked up where he left 
off the previous season, with an opening day home run off Bill Hutchinson 
in a 5–4 loss to the Chicago Colts.[4] But after that, his season's power 
numbers dropped significantly, as he hit only four home runs, tallied 75 
RBIs, and had a .270 batting average. He bounced back the following season, 
when he hit nine home runs, which was fourth in the league, batted .319 
to finish second in the league, and totaled 84 RBIs, which was ninth.[2] 
He followed the 1891 campaign with an even better 1892 season, when he 
played in 153 games, batted 602 times, scored 114 runs, and tripled 16 
times, all career highs. He also claimed his second home run title that 
season, with 13, and finished in the top ten with 176 hits as well.[2] 
Both 1893 and 1894 saw Holliday continue his batting production; although 
his home runs dipped to five in 1893, he still batted .310, totaled 84 
RBIs, and scored 108 runs. But statistically, 1894 was his greatest season, 
when his .372 batting average was his career high, as well as his 119 runs 
scored, 190 hits, 119 RBIs, .420 on-base percentage and .523 slugging percentage.[2] 
During the first six years of his career, he slugged 63 home runs, which 
was second to only Roger Connor during the same span; but in 1895 he had 
an appendectomy, and was never the same player after that. In his last 
four seasons he was never more than a part-time player.[1] When Holliday's 
baseball career was over, he was a National League umpire for the 1903 
season, officiating in 53 games that season.[3] He was involved in one 
incident in which Honus Wagner of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati 
Reds second baseman Jack Morrissey became engaged in words, which led to 
Wagner being surrounded by other Reds players. Holliday ejected Wagner 
from the game to quell the possibility of an altercation on the field.[5] 
He continued to live in Cincinnati, and worked in a pool room while also 
covering horse racing for a local newspaper.[6] He died at the age of 43 
in Cincinnati of gangrene of foot and leg,[7] and is interred at Spring 
Grove Cemetery, also in Cincinnati.[3] The New York Times reported his 
illness on February 3, 1910, and as a result, Reds manager Clark Griffith 
ordered all of the Cincinnati players to be vaccinated before they left
