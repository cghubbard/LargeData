Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn), New York (Manhattan), Queens, Richmond (Staten 
Island) The City of New York, often called New York City, New York, or 
simply The City, is the most populous city in the United States.[9] Located 
at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of 
the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations 
in the world.[10][11] With a U.S. Census Bureau-estimated 2015 population 
of 8,550,405[1] distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km2),[12] 
New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[13] 
A global power city,[14] New York City exerts a significant impact upon 
commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, 
and entertainment, its fast pace[15] defining the term New York minute.[16] 
Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[17] New York is an important 
center for international diplomacy[18] and has been described as the cultural 
and financial capital of the world.[19][20][21][22][23][24] Situated on 
one of the world's largest natural harbors,[25][26] New York City consists 
of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State.[27] 
The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten 
Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[28] The city and 
its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration 
to the United States,[29][30][31] and as many as 800 languages are spoken 
in New York,[32][33][34] making it the most linguistically diverse city 
in the world.[33][35][36] By 2015 estimates, the New York City metropolitan 
region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United 
States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.2 million 
residents)[5] and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7 million residents).[6] 
In 2013, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly 
US$1.39 trillion,[37] while in 2012, the CSA[38] generated a GMP of over 
US$1.55 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind 
the GDP of only twelve and eleven countries, respectively.[39] New York 
City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading 
post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 
1626.[40] The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664[40] 
and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the 
lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[41] New York served as the capital 
of the United States from 1785 until 1790.[42] It has been the country's 
largest city since 1790.[43] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of 
immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 
20th centuries[44] and is a symbol of the United States and its democracy.[45] 
In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity 
and entrepreneurship,[46] social tolerance,[47] and environmental sustainability.[48][49] 
Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and 
the city received a record of nearly 60 million tourists in 2015,[50] hosting 
three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013.[51] 
Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the 
world.[52][53][54] Times Square, iconic as the world's "heart"[55] and 
its "Crossroads",[56] is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater 
District,[57] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[58][59] 
and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[60] The names 
of many of the city's bridges, tapered skyscrapers,[61] and parks are known 
around the world. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of 
Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically 
powerful city and the leading financial center of the world,[23][62][63][64][65][66] 
and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total 
market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.[67][68] 
Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world.[69][70] 
Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese 
people in the Western Hemisphere,[71][72] with multiple signature Chinatowns 
developing across the city.[73][74] Providing continuous 24/7 service,[75] 
the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, 
with 469 stations in operation.[76][77][78] Over 120 colleges and universities 
are located in New York City, including Columbia University, New York University, 
and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in 
the world.[79][80] During the Wisconsinan glaciation, the New York City 
region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 1,000 feet in 
depth. The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of soil, leaving the bedrock 
that serves as the geologic foundation for much of New York City today. 
Later on, movement of the ice sheet would contribute to the separation 
of what are now Long Island and Staten Island.[81] In the precolonial era, 
the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by various bands of 
Algonquian tribes of Native Americans, including the Lenape, whose homeland, 
known as Lenapehoking, included Staten Island; the western portion of Long 
Island, including the area that would become Brooklyn and Queens; Manhattan; 
the Bronx; and the Lower Hudson Valley.[82] The first documented visit 
by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine explorer 
in the service of the French crown, who sailed his ship La Dauphine into 
New York Harbor. He claimed the area for France and named it "Nouvelle 
Angoulême" (New Angoulême).[83] A Spanish expedition led by captain Estêvão 
Gomes, a Portuguese sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York 
Harbor in January 1525 aboard the purpose-built caravel La Anunciada and 
charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named Rio de San Antonio. 
Heavy ice kept him from further exploration, and he returned to Spain in 
August. The Padrón Real of 1527, the first scientific map to show North 
America's east coast continuously, was informed by Gomes' expedition and 
labeled the Northeastern U.S. as Tierra de Esteban Gómez in his honor.[84] 
In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson re-discovered the region when 
he sailed his ship the Halve Maen ("Half Moon" in Dutch) into New York 
Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the 
Dutch East India Company. He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would 
name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the 
Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson's first mate described 
the harbor as "a very good Harbour for all windes" and the river as "a 
mile broad" and "full of fish."[85] Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles north,[86] 
past the site of the present-day Albany, in the belief that it might be 
an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue.[85] 
He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the 
Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware 
Bay would be claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (New 
Netherland). The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually 
become New York City was Dominican trader Juan Rodriguez (transliterated 
to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues). Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African 
descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613–1614, trapping 
for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of 
the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street, is named Juan Rodriguez 
Way in his honor.[87][88] A permanent European presence in New Netherland 
began in 1624 – making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established 
settlement in the continental United States[89] – with the founding of 
a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction 
was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, later 
called New Amsterdam (Nieuw Amsterdam).[90][91] The colony of New Amsterdam 
was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower Manhattan. 
In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting as charged 
by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from 
the Canarsie, a small Lenape band,[92] for 60 guilders[93] (about $1,000 
in 2006).[94] A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for 
$24 worth of glass beads.[95][96] Following the purchase, New Amsterdam 
grew slowly.[97] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon 
system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen ("patroons", or patrons) who brought 
50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swathes of land in New 
Netherland, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate 
in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[98] Since 
1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, 
on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639–1640, in an effort 
to bolster economy growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its 
monopoly over the fur trade in New Netherland, leading to growth in the 
production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly 
with the Dutch West Indies).[97][99] In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his 
tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, 
the population of New Amsterdam grew from 2,000 to 8,000. Stuyvesant has 
been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he also 
earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on 
liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, 
and blocked other religious groups (including Quakers, Jews, and Lutherans) 
from establishing houses of worship.[100] The Dutch West India Company 
would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents 
of New Amsterdam.[101] In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, 
Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops led by Colonel Richard 
Nicolls without bloodshed.[100][101] The terms of the surrender permitted 
Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.[102] 
The English promptly renamed the fledgling city "New York" after the Duke 
of York (the future King James II of England).[103] The transfer was confirmed 
in 1667 by the Treaty of Breda, which concluded the Second Anglo-Dutch 
War.[104] On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Dutch captain 
Anthony Colve seized the colony of New York from England at the behest 
of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it "New Orange" after 
William III, the Prince of Orange. The Dutch would soon return the island 
to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.[105][106] 
Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics 
brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizable population losses 
for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670.[107] By 1700, the Lenape 
population had diminished to 200.[108] New York experienced several yellow 
fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population 
to the disease in 1702.[109][110] New York grew in importance as a trading 
port while under British rule in the early 1700s. It also became a center 
of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any 
other city other than Charleston, South Carolina.[111] Most slaveholders 
held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work 
at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through 
the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied 
to the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, 
during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed 
that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial 
years. The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, 
who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor 
William Cosby, helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America.[112] 
In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II 
as King's College in Lower Manhattan.[113] The Stamp Act Congress met in 
New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city, 
skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there. 
The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary 
War, was fought in August 1776 entirely within the modern-day borough of 
Brooklyn. After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British 
made the city their military and political base of operations in North 
America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves 
who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for 
all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during 
the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close 
of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in 
Nova Scotia. They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean. 
The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference 
House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, 
and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the 
British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York occurred, a large 
conflagration on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about 
a quarter of the buildings in the city, including Trinity Church.[114] 
In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York 
the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital 
of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under 
the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, the first President of 
the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United 
States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled 
for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all 
at Federal Hall on Wall Street.[115] By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia 
as the largest city in the United States. Under New York State's gradual 
abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually 
liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late 
twenties.[117][118] Together with slaves freed by their masters after the 
Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-black population 
gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States 
founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society 
worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate 
black children.[119] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely 
abolished in the state, and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. 
New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders 
were graduates of the African Free School. The city's black population 
reached more than 16,000 in 1840.[120] In the 19th century, the city was 
transformed by development relating to its status as a trading center, 
as well as by European immigration.[121] The city adopted the Commissioners' 
Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan. 
The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected 
the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North 
American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes.[122] Local 
politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported 
by Irish and German immigrants.[123] Several prominent American literary 
figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William 
Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, 
John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Public-minded 
members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment 
of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American 
city. The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants. 
Over 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the 
city's population.[124] There was also extensive immigration from the German 
provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and Germans comprised 
another 25% of New York's population by 1860.[125] Democratic Party candidates 
were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to 
the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on 
the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States 
after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.[119] Anger 
at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), 
which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to 
$5,775 in 2015) commutation fee to hire a substitute,[126][127] led to 
the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish 
working class.[119] The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's 
elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after 
fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and black people 
for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with 
more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New York City 
Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants.[125] According 
to historian James M. McPherson (2001), at least 120 people were killed. 
In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced 
hundreds of blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New 
Jersey; the black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which 
it had last been in 1820. The white working class had established dominance.[125][128] 
Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the 
docks area.[125] It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American 
history.[129] In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the 
consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New 
York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, 
and the western portion of the County of Queens.[130] The opening of the 
subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the 
new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city 
became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication. In 1904, 
the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 
people on board. In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city's 
worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred 
the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and major 
improvements in factory safety standards.[131] New York's non-white population 
was 36,620 in 1890.[132] New York City was a prime destination in the early 
twentieth century for African Americans during the Great Migration from 
the American South, and by 1916, New York City was home to the largest 
urban African diaspora in North America. The Harlem Renaissance of literary 
and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition. The larger 
economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height 
and creating an identifiable skyline. New York became the most populous 
urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The 
metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early 1930s, becoming 
the first megacity in human history.[133] The difficult years of the Great 
Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and 
the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.[134] 
Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the 
development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens. New York emerged 
from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street 
leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United 
Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global 
geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city 
precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art 
world.[135] The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations 
by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in 
the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich 
Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. They are widely considered to 
constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation 
movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.[138][139] 
In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York 
City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.[140] While 
a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic 
health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through 
that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.[141] By the mid 1990s, 
crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, 
improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both 
American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important 
new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy. New 
York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 Census and then again 
in the 2010 Census. The city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of 
the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of 
the September 11, 2001 attacks when 10 of the 19 terrorists associated 
with Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower 
of the World Trade Center and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South 
Tower of the World Trade Center, and later destroyed them, killing 2,192 
civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in 
the towers and in the surrounding area.[142] The rebuilding of the area, 
has created a new One World Trade Center, and a 9/11 memorial and museum 
along with other new buildings and infrastructure. The World Trade Center 
PATH station, which opened on July 19, 1909 as the Hudson Terminal, was 
also destroyed in the attack. A temporary station was built and opened 
on November 23, 2003. A permanent station, the World Trade Center Transportation 
Hub, is currently under construction.[143] The new One World Trade Center 
is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere[144] and the fourth-tallest 
building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 
1,776 feet (541.3 m) in reference to the year of American independence.[145][146][147][148] 
The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District 
of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention 
and spawning the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality 
worldwide.[149] New York City is situated in the Northeastern United States, 
in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, 
D.C. and Boston.[150] The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which 
feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, 
has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New 
York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and 
Staten Island. The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New 
York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary.[151] 
The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. 
The East River—a tidal strait—flows from Long Island Sound and separates 
the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal 
strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan 
from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester 
County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city.[152] The city's 
land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable 
land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation 
is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery 
Park City in the 1970s and 1980s.[153] Some of the natural relief in topography 
has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.[154] The city's total area 
is 468.9 square miles (1,214 km2). 164.1 sq mi (425 km2) of this is water 
and 304.8 sq mi (789 km2) is land.[155][156] The highest point in the city 
is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea 
level, is the highest point on the Eastern Seaboard south of Maine.[157] 
The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten 
Island Greenbelt.[158] New York has architecturally noteworthy buildings 
in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the saltbox 
style Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which 
dates to 1656, to the modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at 
Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and the most expensive office tower in the 
world by construction cost.[159] Manhattan's skyline, with its many skyscrapers, 
is universally recognized, and the city has been home to several of the 
tallest buildings in the world. As of 2011[update], New York City had 5,937 
high-rise buildings, of which 550 completed structures were at least 330 
feet (100 m) high, both second in the world after Hong Kong,[160][161] 
with over 50 completed skyscrapers taller than 656 feet (200 m). These 
include the Woolworth Building (1913), an early gothic revival skyscraper 
built with massively scaled gothic detailing. The 1916 Zoning Resolution 
required setbacks in new buildings and restricted towers to a percentage 
of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below.[162] The 
Art Deco style of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building 
(1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning 
requirements. The buildings have distinctive ornamentation, such as the 
eagles at the corners of the 61st floor on the Chrysler Building, and are 
considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style.[163] A highly 
influential example of the international style in the United States is 
the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its façade using visible bronze-toned 
I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Condé Nast Building (2000) 
is a prominent example of green design in American skyscrapers[164] and 
has received an award from the American Institute of Architects and AIA 
New York State for its design. The character of New York's large residential 
districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses 
and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion 
from 1870 to 1930.[165] In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods 
that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In 
neighborhoods such as Riverdale (in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), 
and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family homes are common in various 
architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian.[166][167][168] 
Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the 
construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great 
Fire of 1835.[169] A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings 
is the wooden roof-mounted water towers. In the 1800s, the city required 
their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the 
need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could 
break municipal water pipes.[170] Garden apartments became popular during 
the 1920s in outlying areas, such as Jackson Heights.[171] According to 
the United States Geological Survey, an updated analysis of seismic hazard 
in July 2014 revealed a "slightly lower hazard for tall buildings" in New 
York City than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened 
risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking 
near the city, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures 
from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.[172] New York City is often 
referred to collectively as the five boroughs, and in turn, there are hundreds 
of distinct neighborhoods throughout the boroughs, many with a definable 
history and character to call their own. If the boroughs were each independent 
cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) 
would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten 
island would be ranked 37th) ; these same boroughs are coterminous with 
the four most densely populated counties in the United States (New York 
[Manhattan], Kings [Brooklyn], Bronx, and Queens). Under the Köppen climate 
classification, using the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm, New York City features 
a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), and is thus the northernmost major city 
on the North American continent with this categorization.[187][188] The 
suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transitional zone between 
humid subtropical and humid continental climates (Dfa).[187][188] The city 
averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually, and averages 57% 
of possible sunshine annually,[189] accumulating 2,535 hours of sunshine 
per annum.[189] The city lies in the USDA 7b plant hardiness zone.[190] 
Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore 
minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic 
and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the 
city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar 
or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. The 
daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 32.6 °F 
(0.3 °C);[191] temperatures usually drop to 10 °F (−12 °C) several times 
per winter,[191][192] and reach 60 °F (16 °C) several days in the coldest 
winter month.[191] Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from 
chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers 
are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5 °F 
(24.7 °C) in July.[191] Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the 
urban heat island phenomenon, while daytime temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) 
on average of 17 days each summer[193] and in some years exceed 100 °F 
(38 °C). Extreme temperatures have ranged from −15 °F (−26 °C), recorded 
on February 9, 1934, up to 106 °F (41 °C) on July 9, 1936.[193] The city 
receives 49.9 inches (1,270 mm) of precipitation annually, which is fairly 
spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1981 and 2010 
has been 25.8 inches (66 cm); this varies considerably from year to year.[193] 
Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area, but they 
are not unheard of and always have the potential to strike the area.[194] 
Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the 
evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway 
lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity 
in many parts of the city and its suburbs.[195] The storm and its profound 
impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other 
coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan 
area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such 
event in the future.[196][197] See Geography of New York City for additional 
climate information from the outer boroughs. The City of New York has a 
complex park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, 
the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, 
and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In its 2013 ParkScore 
ranking, the Trust for Public Land reported that the park system in New 
York City was the second best park system among the 50 most populous US 
cities, behind the park system of Minneapolis.[199] ParkScore ranks urban 
park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size, park acres as 
percent of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile 
of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds 
per 10,000 residents. Gateway National Recreation Area contains over 26,000 
acres (10,521.83 ha) in total, most of it surrounded by New York City,[201] 
including the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. In Brooklyn and Queens, the 
park contains over 9,000 acres (36 km2) of salt marsh, wetlands, islands, 
and water, including most of Jamaica Bay. Also in Queens, the park includes 
a significant portion of the western Rockaway Peninsula, most notably Jacob 
Riis Park and Fort Tilden. In Staten Island, Gateway National Recreation 
Area includes Fort Wadsworth, with historic pre-Civil War era Battery Weed 
and Fort Tompkins, and Great Kills Park, with beaches, trails, and a marina. 
The Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Immigration Museum 
are managed by the National Park Service and are in both the states of 
New York and New Jersey. They are joined in the harbor by Governors Island 
National Monument, in New York. Historic sites under federal management 
on Manhattan Island include Castle Clinton National Monument; Federal Hall 
National Memorial; Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site; 
General Grant National Memorial ("Grant's Tomb"); African Burial Ground 
National Monument; and Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Hundreds of private 
properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as 
a National Historic Landmark such as, for example, the Stonewall Inn, part 
of the Stonewall National Monument in Greenwich Village, as the catalyst 
of the modern gay rights movement.[202][203][204]| There are seven state 
parks within the confines of New York City, including Clay Pit Ponds State 
Park Preserve, a natural area that includes extensive riding trails, and 
Riverbank State Park, a 28-acre (110,000 m2) facility that rises 69 feet 
(21 m) over the Hudson River.[205] New York City has over 28,000 acres 
(110 km2) of municipal parkland and 14 miles (23 km) of public beaches.[206] 
The largest municipal park in the city is Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, 
with 2,765 acres (1,119 ha).[177][207] New York City is home to Fort Hamilton, 
the U.S. military's only active duty installation within the city.[213] 
Established in 1825 in Brooklyn on the site of a small battery utilized 
during the American Revolution, it is one of America's longest serving 
military forts.[214] Today Fort Hamilton serves as the headquarters of 
the North Atlantic Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers 
and for the New York City Recruiting Battalion. It also houses the 1179th 
Transportation Brigade, the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, and a military 
entrance processing station. Other formerly active military reservations 
still utilized for National Guard and military training or reserve operations 
in the city include Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island and Fort Totten in 
Queens. New York City is the most-populous city in the United States,[9] 
with an estimated record high of 8,550,405 residents as of 2015[update],[1] 
incorporating more immigration into the city than outmigration since the 
2010 United States Census.[226][227] More than twice as many people live 
in New York City as in the second-most populous U.S. city (Los Angeles),[9] 
and within a smaller area. New York City gained more residents between 
April 2010 and July 2014 (316,000) than any other U.S. city.[9] New York 
City's population amounts to about 40% of New York State's population and 
a similar percentage of the New York metropolitan area population. In 2015, 
the city had an estimated population density of 28,053 people per square 
mile (10,756/km²), rendering it the most densely populated of all municipalities 
housing over 100,000 residents in the United States, with several small 
cities (of fewer than 100,000) in adjacent Hudson County, New Jersey having 
greater density, as per the 2000 Census.[228] Geographically co-extensive 
with New York County, the borough of Manhattan's 2015 population density 
of 72,033 people per square mile[229] (27,812/km²) makes it the highest 
of any county in the United States[230] and higher than the density of 
any individual American city.[231] The city's population in 2010 was 44% 
white (33.3% non-Hispanic white), 25.5% black (23% non-Hispanic black), 
0.7% Native American, and 12.7% Asian.[232] Hispanics of any race represented 
28.6% of the population,[232] while Asians constituted the fastest-growing 
segment of the city's population between 2000 and 2010; the non-Hispanic 
white population declined 3 percent, the smallest recorded decline in decades; 
and for the first time since the Civil War, the number of blacks declined 
over a decade.[233] Throughout its history, the city has been a major port 
of entry for immigrants into the United States; more than 12 million European 
immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924.[234] The 
term "melting pot" was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant 
neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the 
largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians.[235] 
In 1940, whites represented 92% of the city's population.[217] Approximately 
37% of the city's population is foreign born.[238][239] In New York, no 
single country or region of origin dominates.[238] The ten largest sources 
of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011[update] were the Dominican 
Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, 
and Trinidad and Tobago,[240] while the Bangladeshi immigrant population 
has since become one of the fastest growing in the city, counting over 
74,000 by 2013.[241] Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 
2010 Census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals 
of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[242] New York contains the highest total 
Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[243] The New York City borough 
of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and 
the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations 
in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area 
in the world.[179][180] The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing 
nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan 
Chinatown (紐約華埠), in Brooklyn (布鲁克林華埠), and around Flushing, Queens (法拉盛華埠), 
are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly 
eastward into suburban Nassau County (拿騷縣)[244] on Long Island (長島),[245] 
as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the 
top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale 
Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas.[31][246][247][248][249][250] 
In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths 
living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island.[251] 
A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu (Chinese: 朝鲜族) 
or Joseonjok (Hangul: 조선족)) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New 
York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, 
India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens.[252] Koreans made up 1.2% of 
the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast 
Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of 
New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian 
group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and 
Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.[253] Queens is the preferred 
borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, Filipinos,[254] and Malaysians[30] 
and other Southeast Asians;[255] while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers 
of both West Indian and Asian Indian immigrants. New York City has the 
largest European and non-Hispanic white population of any American city. 
At 2.7 million in 2012, New York's non-Hispanic white population is larger 
than the non-Hispanic white populations of Los Angeles (1.1 million), Chicago 
(865,000), and Houston (550,000) combined.[256] The non-Hispanic white 
population was 6.6 million in 1940.[257] The non-Hispanic white population 
has begun to increase since 2010.[258] The European diaspora residing in 
the city is very diverse. According to 2012 Census estimates, there were 
roughly 560,000 Italian Americans, 385,000 Irish Americans, 253,000 German 
Americans, 223,000 Russian Americans, 201,000 Polish Americans, and 137,000 
English Americans. Additionally, Greek and French Americans numbered 65,000 
each, with those of Hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people. Ukrainian 
and Scottish Americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000, respectively. People 
identifying ancestry from Spain numbered 30,838 total in 2010.[259] People 
of Norwegian and Swedish descent both stood at about 20,000 each, while 
people of Czech, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Scotch-Irish, and Welsh descent 
all numbered between 12,000–14,000 people.[260] Arab Americans number over 
160,000 in New York City,[261] with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. 
Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment 
of the city's non-Hispanic white population, enumerating over 30,000, and 
including over half of all Central Asian immigrants to the United States,[262] 
most settling in Queens or Brooklyn. Albanian Americans are most highly 
concentrated in the Bronx.[263] The wider New York City metropolitan statistical 
area, with over 20 million people, about 50% greater than the second-place 
Los Angeles metropolitan area in the United States,[5] is also ethnically 
diverse,[264] with the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan 
region in the world. The New York region continues to be by far the leading 
metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States, 
substantially exceeding the combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami.[30] 
It is home to the largest Jewish and Israeli communities outside Israel, 
with the Jewish population in the region numbering over 1.5 million in 
2012 and including many diverse Jewish sects from around the Middle East 
and Eastern Europe.[252] The metropolitan area is also home to 20% of the 
nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, and 15% 
of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns;[265][266] the largest Asian 
Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American,[246] 
Italian American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican 
American, Puerto Rican American, and South American[246] and second-largest 
overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 4.8 million;[259] 
and includes at least 6 established Chinatowns within New York City alone,[267] 
with the urban agglomeration comprising a population of 779,269 overseas 
Chinese as of 2013[update] Census estimates,[268] the largest outside of 
Asia.[236][237] Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Brazil were the top 
source countries from South America for legal immigrants to the New York 
City region in 2013; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad 
and Tobago in the Caribbean; Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria from Africa; and 
El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America.[272] Amidst a 
resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population 
had increased to approximately 1.3 million in the metropolitan area as 
of 2013[update]. The New York metropolitan area is home to a self-identifying 
gay and bisexual community estimated at nearly 570,000 individuals, the 
largest in the United States and one of the world's largest.[270][271] 
Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011 and were 
authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter.[273] New York City 
is also home to the largest transgender population in the United States, 
estimated at 25,000 in 2016.[274] Christianity (59%), made up of Roman 
Catholicism (33%), Protestantism (23%), and other Christians (3%), was 
the most prevalently practiced religion in New York as of 2014[update],[275] 
followed by Judaism, with approximately 1.1 million Jews in New York City,[276][277] 
over half living in Brooklyn.[278] Islam ranks third in New York City, 
with official estimates ranging between 600,000 and 1,000,000 observers 
and including 10% of the city's public schoolchildren,[279] followed by 
Hinduism, Buddhism, and a variety of other religions, as well as atheism. 
In 2014, 24% self-identified with no organized religious affiliation.[275] 
New York City has a high degree of income disparity as indicated by its 
Gini Coefficient of 0.5 for the city overall and 0.6 for Manhattan.[281] 
In the first quarter of 2014, the average weekly wage in New York County 
(Manhattan) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties 
in the United States.[282] In 2016, Beijing overtook New York City to become 
the city with the most billionaires in the world, 100 to 95,[283][284] 
including former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.[285] New York also had the highest 
density of millionaires per capita among major U.S. cities in 2014, at 
4.6% of residents.[286] Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom, 
with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% 
greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001.[287] New York 
is a global hub of international business and commerce. In 2012, New York 
City topped the first Global Economic Power Index, published by The Atlantic 
(to be differentiated from a namesake list published by the Martin Prosperity 
Institute), with cities ranked according to criteria reflecting their presence 
on similar lists as published by other entities.[289] The city is a major 
center for banking and finance, retailing, world trade, transportation, 
tourism, real estate, new media, traditional media, advertising, legal 
services, accountancy, insurance, theater, fashion, and the arts in the 
United States; while Silicon Alley, metonymous for New York's broad-spectrum 
high technology sphere, continues to expand. The Port of New York and New 
Jersey is also a major economic engine, handling record cargo volume in 
the first half of 2014.[290] Many Fortune 500 corporations are headquartered 
in New York City,[291] as are a large number of foreign corporations. One 
out of ten private sector jobs in the city is with a foreign company.[292] 
New York City has been ranked first among cities across the globe in attracting 
capital, business, and tourists.[293][294] This ability to attract foreign 
investment helped New York City top the FDi Magazine American Cities of 
the Future ranking for 2013.[295] Real estate is a major force in the city's 
economy, as the total value of all New York City property was assessed 
at US$914.8 billion for the 2015 fiscal year.[296] The Time Warner Center 
is the property with the highest-listed market value in the city, at US$1.1 billion 
in 2006.[296] New York City is home to some of the nation's—and the world's—most 
valuable real estate. 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007 for US$510 million, 
about $1,589 per square foot ($17,104/m²), breaking the barely month-old 
record for an American office building of $1,476 per square foot ($15,887/m²) 
set in the June 2007 sale of 660 Madison Avenue.[297] According to Forbes, 
in 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top ten zip codes in the United 
States by median housing price.[298] As of 2013[update], the global advertising 
agencies of Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group, both based in Manhattan, 
had combined annual revenues of approximately US$21 billion, reflecting 
New York City's role as the top global center for the advertising industry, 
which is metonymously referred to as "Madison Avenue".[299] The city's 
fashion industry provides approximately 180,000 employees with $11 billion 
in annual wages.[300] Other important sectors include medical research 
and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Manufacturing 
accounts for a significant but declining share of employment, although 
the city's garment industry is showing a resurgence in Brooklyn.[301] Food 
processing is a US$5 billion industry that employs more than 19,000 residents. 
Chocolate is New York City's leading specialty-food export, with up to 
US$234 million worth of exports each year.[302] Entrepreneurs were forming 
a "Chocolate District" in Brooklyn as of 2014[update],[303] while Godiva, 
one of the world's largest chocolatiers, continues to be headquartered 
in Manhattan.[304] New York City's most important economic sector lies 
in its role as the headquarters for the U.S.financial industry, metonymously 
known as Wall Street. The city's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 
jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's 
financial sector and an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 
5 percent of the city's private sector jobs, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) 
of its tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including 
an average salary of US$360,700.[305] Many large financial companies are 
headquartered in New York City, and the city is also home to a burgeoning 
number of financial startup companies. Lower Manhattan is the third-largest 
central business district in the United States and is home to the New York 
Stock Exchange, on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, representing 
the world's largest and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when 
measured both by overall average daily trading volume and by total market 
capitalization of their listed companies in 2013.[67][68] Investment banking 
fees on Wall Street totaled approximately $40 billion in 2012,[306] while 
in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance 
functions earned as much as $324,000 annually.[307] In fiscal year 2013–14, 
Wall Street's securities industry generated 19% of New York State's tax 
revenue.[308] New York City remains the largest global center for trading 
in public equity and debt capital markets, driven in part by the size and 
financial development of the U.S. economy.[309]:31–32[310] In July 2013, 
NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, took over the 
administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers 
Association.[311] New York also leads in hedge fund management; private 
equity; and the monetary volume of mergers and acquisitions. Several investment 
banks and investment mangers headquartered in Manhattan are important participants 
in other global financial centers.[309]:34–35 New York is also the principal 
commercial banking center of the United States.[312] Many of the world's 
largest media conglomerates are also based in the city. Manhattan contained 
over 500 million square feet (46.5 million m2) of office space in 2015,[313] 
making it the largest office market in the United States,[314] while Midtown 
Manhattan, with nearly 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) in 2015,[313] 
is the largest central business district in the world.[315] Silicon Alley, 
centered in Manhattan, has evolved into a metonym for the sphere encompassing 
the New York City metropolitan region's high technology industries[317] 
involving the Internet, new media, telecommunications, digital media, software 
development, biotechnology, game design, financial technology ("FinTech"), 
and other fields within information technology that are supported by its 
entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments. In 2015, Silicon 
Alley generated over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment across 
a broad spectrum of high technology enterprises,[46] most based in Manhattan, 
with others in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology 
startup companies and employment are growing in New York City and the region, 
bolstered by the city's position in North America as the leading Internet 
hub and telecommunications center, including its vicinity to several transatlantic 
fiber optic trunk lines,[318] New York's intellectual capital, and its 
extensive outdoor wireless connectivity.[319] Verizon Communications, headquartered 
at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 
of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout 
New York City.[320] As of 2014[update], New York City hosted 300,000 employees 
in the tech sector.[321][322] The biotechnology sector is also growing 
in New York City, based upon the city's strength in academic scientific 
research and public and commercial financial support. On December 19, 2011, 
then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his choice of Cornell University 
and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to build a US$2 billion graduate 
school of applied sciences called Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island with 
the goal of transforming New York City into the world's premier technology 
capital.[323][324] By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, 
had raised more than US$30 million from investors, including Eli Lilly 
and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, for initial funding to create 
biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which 
encompasses more than 700,000 square feet (65,000 m2) on East 29th Street 
and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center 
and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The New York 
City Economic Development Corporation's Early Stage Life Sciences Funding 
Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric 
Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100 million to help 
launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology.[325] Tourism 
is a vital industry for New York City, which has witnessed a growing combined 
volume of international and domestic tourists, receiving a sixth consecutive 
record of nearly 60 million visitors in 2015.[50] Tourism had generated 
an all-time high US$61.3 billion in overall economic impact for New York 
City in 2014,[50] pending 2015 statistics. Approximately 12 million visitors 
to New York City were from outside the United States, with the highest 
numbers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, and China. According to 
the website reuters.com, "New York City tourism climb[ed] record high in 
2015 for [the] sixth year.".[50] I Love New York (stylized I ❤ NY) is both 
a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have 
been used since 1977 to promote tourism in New York City,[326] and later 
to promote New York State as well. The trademarked logo, owned by New York 
State Empire State Development,[327] appears in souvenir shops and brochures 
throughout the city and state, some licensed, many not. The song is the 
state song of New York. Major tourist destinations include Times Square; 
Broadway theater productions; the Empire State Building; the Statue of 
Liberty; Ellis Island; the United Nations Headquarters; museums such as 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art; greenspaces such as Central Park and Washington 
Square Park; Rockefeller Center; the Manhattan Chinatown; luxury shopping 
along Fifth and Madison Avenues; and events such as the Halloween Parade 
in Greenwich Village; the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade; the lighting 
of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree; the St. Patrick's Day parade; 
seasonal activities such as ice skating in Central Park in the wintertime; 
the Tribeca Film Festival; and free performances in Central Park at Summerstage.[328] 
Major attractions in the boroughs outside Manhattan include Flushing Meadows-Corona 
Park and the Unisphere in Queens; the Bronx Zoo; Coney Island, Brooklyn; 
and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. The New York Wheel, a 630-foot 
ferris wheel, was under construction at the northern shore of Staten Island 
in 2015,[329] overlooking the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbor, and the 
Lower Manhattan skyline.[330] Manhattan was on track to have an estimated 
90,000 hotel rooms at the end of 2014, a 10% increase from 2013.[331] In 
October 2014, the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, purchased the 
Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the world's most 
expensive hotel ever sold.[332] New York is a prominent location for the 
American entertainment industry, with many films, television series, books, 
and other media being set there.[333] As of 2012[update], New York City 
was the second largest center for filmmaking and television production 
in the United States, producing about 200 feature films annually, employing 
130,000 individuals; the filmed entertainment industry has been growing 
in New York, contributing nearly US$9 billion to the New York City economy 
alone as of 2015,[334] and by volume, New York is the world leader in independent 
film production[335] – one-third of all American independent films are 
produced in New York City.[336] The Association of Independent Commercial 
Producers is also based in New York.[337] In the first five months of 2014 
alone, location filming for television pilots in New York City exceeded 
the record production levels for all of 2013,[338] with New York surpassing 
Los Angeles as the top North American city for the same distinction during 
the 2013/2014 cycle.[339] New York City is additionally a center for the 
advertising, music, newspaper, digital media, and publishing industries 
and is also the largest media market in North America.[340] Some of the 
city's media conglomerates and institutions include Time Warner, the Thomson 
Reuters Corporation, the Associated Press, Bloomberg L.P., the News Corporation, 
The New York Times Company, NBCUniversal, the Hearst Corporation, AOL, 
and Viacom. Seven of the world's top eight global advertising agency networks 
have their headquarters in New York.[341] Two of the top three record labels' 
headquarters are in New York: Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music 
Group. Universal Music Group also has offices in New York. New media enterprises 
are contributing an increasingly important component to the city's central 
role in the media sphere. More than 200 newspapers and 350 consumer magazines 
have an office in the city,[336] and the publishing industry employs about 
25,000 people.[342] Two of the three national daily newspapers in the United 
States are New York papers: The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, 
which has won the most Pulitzer Prizes for journalism. Major tabloid newspapers 
in the city include: The New York Daily News, which was founded in 1919 
by Joseph Medill Patterson[343] and The New York Post, founded in 1801 
by Alexander Hamilton.[344] The city also has a comprehensive ethnic press, 
with 270 newspapers and magazines published in more than 40 languages.[345] 
El Diario La Prensa is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the 
oldest in the nation.[346] The New York Amsterdam News, published in Harlem, 
is a prominent African American newspaper. The Village Voice is the largest 
alternative newspaper. The television industry developed in New York and 
is a significant employer in the city's economy. The three major American 
broadcast networks are all headquartered in New York: ABC, CBS, and NBC. 
Many cable networks are based in the city as well, including MTV, Fox News, 
HBO, Showtime, Bravo, Food Network, AMC, and Comedy Central. The City of 
New York operates a public broadcast service, NYCTV,[347] that has produced 
several original Emmy Award-winning shows covering music and culture in 
city neighborhoods and city government. New York is also a major center 
for non-commercial educational media. The oldest public-access television 
channel in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, founded 
in 1971.[348] WNET is the city's major public television station and a 
primary source of national Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television 
programming. WNYC, a public radio station owned by the city until 1997, 
has the largest public radio audience in the United States.[349] The New 
York City Public Schools system, managed by the New York City Department 
of Education, is the largest public school system in the United States, 
serving about 1.1 million students in more than 1,700 separate primary 
and secondary schools.[350] The city's public school system includes nine 
specialized high schools to serve academically and artistically gifted 
students. The city government pays the Pelham Public Schools to educate 
a very small, detached section of the Bronx.[351] The New York City Charter 
School Center assists the setup of new charter schools.[353] There are 
approximately 900 additional privately run secular and religious schools 
in the city.[354] Over 600,000 students are enrolled in New York City's 
over 120 higher education institutions, the highest number of any city 
in the United States, including over half million in the City University 
of New York (CUNY) system alone in 2014.[355] In 2005, three out of five 
Manhattan residents were college graduates, and one out of four had a postgraduate 
degree, forming one of the highest concentrations of highly educated people 
in any American city.[356] New York City is home to such notable private 
universities as Barnard College, Columbia University, Cooper Union, Fordham 
University, New York University, New York Institute of Technology, Pace 
University, and Yeshiva University. The public CUNY system is one of the 
largest universities in the nation, comprising 24 institutions across all 
five boroughs: senior colleges, community colleges, and other graduate/professional 
schools. The public State University of New York (SUNY) system serves New 
York City, as well as the rest of the state. The city also has other smaller 
private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose 
institutions, such as St. John's University, The Juilliard School, Manhattan 
College, The College of Mount Saint Vincent, Fashion Institute of Technology, 
Parsons School of Design, The New School, Pratt Institute, The School of 
Visual Arts, The King's College, and Wagner College. Much of the scientific 
research in the city is done in medicine and the life sciences. New York 
City has the most post-graduate life sciences degrees awarded annually 
in the United States, with 127 Nobel laureates having roots in local institutions 
as of 2005[update];[357] while in 2012, 43,523 licensed physicians were 
practicing in New York City.[358] Major biomedical research institutions 
include Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, 
SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Mount 
Sinai School of Medicine, and Weill Cornell Medical College, being joined 
by the Cornell University/Technion-Israel Institute of Technology venture 
on Roosevelt Island. The New York Public Library, which has the largest 
collection of any public library system in the United States, serves Manhattan, 
the Bronx, and Staten Island.[359] Queens is served by the Queens Borough 
Public Library, the nation's second largest public library system, while 
the Brooklyn Public Library serves Brooklyn.[359] The New York City Health 
and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) operates the public hospitals and clinics 
in New York City. A public benefit corporation with $6.7 billion in annual 
revenues, HHC is the largest municipal healthcare system in the United 
States serving 1.4 million patients, including more than 475,000 uninsured 
city residents.[361] HHC was created in 1969 by the New York State Legislature 
as a public benefit corporation (Chapter 1016 of the Laws 1969).[362][363] 
HHC operates 11 acute care hospitals, five nursing homes, six diagnostic 
and treatment centers, and more than 70 community-based primary care sites, 
serving primarily the poor and working class. HHC's MetroPlus Health Plan 
is one of the New York area's largest providers of government-sponsored 
health insurance and is the plan of choice for nearly half million New 
Yorkers.[364] Each year HHC's facilities provide about 225,000 admissions, 
one million emergency room visits and five million clinic visits to New 
Yorkers. HHC facilities treat nearly one-fifth of all general hospital 
discharges and more than one third of emergency room and hospital-based 
clinic visits in New York City.[365] The most well-known hospital in the 
HHC system is Bellevue Hospital, the oldest public hospital in the United 
States. Bellevue is the designated hospital for treatment of the President 
of the United States and other world leaders if they become sick or injured 
while in New York City.[366] The president of HHC is Ramanathan Raju, MD, 
a surgeon and former CEO of the Cook County health system in Illinois.[367] 
The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has been the largest police 
force in the United States by a significant margin, with over 35,000 sworn 
officers.[368] Members of the NYPD are frequently referred to by politicians, 
the media, and their own police cars by the nickname, New York's Finest. 
In 2014, New York City had the third lowest murder rate among the largest 
U.S. cities,[369] having become significantly safer after a spike in crime 
in the 1970s through 1990s.[370] Violent crime in New York City decreased 
more than 75% from 1993 to 2005, and continued decreasing during periods 
when the nation as a whole saw increases.[371] By 2002, New York City's 
crime rate was similar to that of Provo, Utah, and was ranked 197th in 
crime among the 216 U.S. cities with populations greater than 100,000.[371] 
In 2005, the homicide rate was at its lowest level since 1966,[372] and 
in 2007, the city recorded fewer than 500 homicides for the first time 
ever since crime statistics were first published in 1963.[373] In 2015, 
50.5% of New York City misdemeanor assault suspects were black, 33.3% Hispanic, 
11.1% white, 4.8% Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.3% Native American.[374] 
New York City experienced 352 homicides in 2015,[375] its second lowest 
number on record.[376] Sociologists and criminologists have not reached 
consensus on the explanation for the dramatic decrease in the city's crime 
rate. Some attribute the phenomenon to new tactics used by the NYPD,[377] 
including its use of CompStat and the broken windows theory.[378] Others 
cite the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes,[379] including 
from immigration.[380] Another theory is that widespread exposure to lead 
pollution from automobile exhaust, which can lower intelligence and increase 
aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in the mid-20th century, 
most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong 
correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York 
and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American 
gasoline in the 1970s.[381] Another theory cited to explain New York City's 
falling homicide rate is the inverse correlation between the number of 
murders and the increasingly wetter climate in the city.[382] In 2012, 
the NYPD came under scrutiny for its use of a stop-and-frisk program,[383][384][385] 
which has undergone several policy revisions since then. Organized crime 
has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves 
and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s. The 20th century 
saw a rise in the Mafia, dominated by the Five Families, as well as in 
gangs, including the Black Spades.[386] The Mafia and gang presence has 
declined in the city in the 21st century.[387][388] The New York City Fire 
Department (FDNY), provides fire protection, technical rescue, primary 
response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and emergency 
medical services for the five boroughs of New York City. The New York City 
Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in the United 
States and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department. 
The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed firefighters and over 3,300 
uniformed EMTs and paramedics. The FDNY's motto is New York's Bravest. 
The New York City Fire Department faces highly multifaceted firefighting 
challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to 
building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to high-rise 
structures, there are many secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large 
parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires. New York is also 
home to one of the largest subway systems in the world, consisting of hundreds 
of miles of tunnel with electrified track. The FDNY headquarters is located 
at 9 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn,[389] and the FDNY Fire Academy 
is located on Randalls Island.[390] There are three Bureau of Fire Communications 
alarm offices which receive and dispatch alarms to appropriate units. One 
office, at 11 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn, houses Manhattan/Citywide, 
Brooklyn, and Staten Island Fire Communications. The Bronx and Queens offices 
are in separate buildings. New York City has been described as the cultural 
capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland[19] and Latvia[20] 
and by New York's Baruch College.[21] A book containing a series of essays 
titled New York, Culture Capital of the World, 1940–1965 has also been 
published as showcased by the National Library of Australia.[22][24] In 
describing New York, author Tom Wolfe said, "Culture just seems to be in 
the air, like part of the weather."[391] Numerous major American cultural 
movements began in the city, such as the Harlem Renaissance, which established 
the African-American literary canon in the United States.[392][393] The 
city was a center of jazz[394] in the 1940s, abstract expressionism in 
the 1950s, and the birthplace of hip hop in the 1970s.[395] The city's 
punk[396] and hardcore[397] scenes were influential in the 1970s and 1980s. 
New York has long had a flourishing scene for Jewish American literature. 
The city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem 
Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract expressionism (also 
known as the New York School) in painting; and hip hop,[185] punk, salsa, 
disco, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, and jazz in music. New York City has been 
considered the dance capital of the world.[398][399][400] The city is also 
widely celebrated in popular lore, [clarification needed] frequently the 
setting for books, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and 
television programs. New York Fashion Week is one of the world's preeminent 
fashion events and is afforded extensive coverage by the media.[401][402] 
New York has also frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the 
world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor.[403] 
New York City has more than 2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more 
than 500 art galleries of all sizes.[404] The city government funds the 
arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts.[404] 
Wealthy business magnates in the 19th century built a network of major 
cultural institutions, such as the famed Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, that would become internationally established. The advent 
of electric lighting led to elaborate theater productions, and in the 1880s, 
New York City theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began featuring 
a new stage form that became known as the Broadway musical. Strongly influenced 
by the city's immigrants, productions such as those of Harrigan and Hart, 
George M. Cohan, and others used song in narratives that often reflected 
themes of hope and ambition. Broadway theatre is one of the premier forms 
of English-language theatre in the world, named after Broadway, the major 
thoroughfare that crosses Times Square,[405] also sometimes referred to 
as "The Great White Way".[406][407][408] Forty-one venues in Midtown Manhattan's 
Theatre District, each with at least 500 seats, are classified as Broadway 
theatres. According to The Broadway League, Broadway shows sold approximately 
US$1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013–2014 season, an 11.4% increase 
from US$1.139 billion in the 2012–2013 season. Attendance in 2013–2014 
stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012–2013 
season's 11.57 million.[409] Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring 
Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to numerous 
influential arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York 
City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and New York City Ballet, as well as 
the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 
and Alice Tully Hall. The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute is in 
Union Square, and Tisch School of the Arts is based at New York University, 
while Central Park SummerStage presents performances of free plays and 
music in Central Park.[410] In April 2015, New York hosted the annual Cardistry-Con, 
a three-day cardistry convention and interactive conference for cardists 
all over the world.[412] New York City is home to hundreds of cultural 
institutions and historic sites, many of which are internationally known. 
Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd 
to 105th streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,[413] in an area sometimes 
called Upper Carnegie Hill.[414] The Mile, which contains one of the densest 
displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than 
one mile (1.6 km). Ten museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth 
Avenue.[415] The tenth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble 
in 2009, although its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed 
on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959,[416] opened in late 2012. In 
addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum 
Mile Festival, held each year in June, to promote the museums and increase 
visitation.[417] Many of the world's most lucrative art auctions are held 
in New York City. New York City's food culture includes a variety of international 
cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. Central European and 
Italian immigrants brought bagels, cheesecake, and New York-style pizza 
into the city, while Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, 
trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses have become ubiquitous. Some 4,000 
mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made 
Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs[419] examples of modern 
New York street food. The city is home to "nearly one thousand of the finest 
and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world", according to 
Michelin.[420] The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 
assigns letter grades to the city's 24,000 restaurants based upon their 
inspection results.[421] The New York area is home to a distinctive regional 
speech pattern called the New York dialect, alternatively known as Brooklynese 
or New Yorkese. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable 
accents within American English.[422] The classic version of this dialect 
is centered on middle and working-class people of European descent. The 
influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes 
in this distinctive dialect,[423] and the traditional form of this speech 
pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as in the past.[423] 
The traditional New York area accent is characterized as non-rhotic, so 
that the sound [ɹ] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately 
before a consonant; hence the pronunciation of the city name as "New Yawk."[423] 
There is no [ɹ] in words like park [pɑək] or [pɒək] (with vowel backed 
and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift), butter [bʌɾə], or here 
[hiə]. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the [ɔ] vowel 
sound of words like talk, law, cross, chocolate, and coffee and the often 
homophonous [ɔr] in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than 
in General American. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of 
the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like "girl" and of words 
like "oil" became a diphthong [ɜɪ]. This would often be misperceived by 
speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds, so that 
girl is pronounced "goil" and oil is pronounced "erl"; this leads to the 
caricature of New Yorkers saying things like "Joizey" (Jersey), "Toidy-Toid 
Street" (33rd St.) and "terlet" (toilet).[423] The character Archie Bunker 
from the 1970s sitcom All in the Family (played by Carroll O'Connor) was 
an example of having used this pattern of speech, which continues to fade 
in its overall presence. New York City is home to the headquarters of the 
National Football League,[425] Major League Baseball,[426] the National 
Basketball Association,[427] the National Hockey League,[428] and Major 
League Soccer.[429] The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports 
teams in these five professional leagues. Participation in professional 
sports in the city predates all professional leagues, and the city has 
been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn 
Dodgers in 1882. The city has played host to over forty major professional 
teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues, both current 
and historic. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide 
(MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi 
Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area.[430] Madison Square 
Garden, its predecessor, the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, 
are sporting venues located in New York City, the latter two having been 
commemorated on U.S. postage stamps. New York has been described as the 
"Capital of Baseball".[431] There have been 35 Major League Baseball World 
Series and 73 pennants won by New York teams. It is one of only five metro 
areas (Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore–Washington, and the San Francisco 
Bay Area being the others) to have two baseball teams. Additionally, there 
have been 14 World Series in which two New York City teams played each 
other, known as a Subway Series and occurring most recently in 2000. No 
other metropolitan area has had this happen more than once (Chicago in 
1906, St. Louis in 1944, and the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989). The city's 
two current Major League Baseball teams are the New York Mets, who play 
at Citi Field in Queens,[432] and the New York Yankees, who play at Yankee 
Stadium in the Bronx.[433] who compete in six games of interleague play 
every regular season that has also come to be called the Subway Series. 
The Yankees have won a record 27 championships,[434] while the Mets have 
won the World Series twice.[435] The city also was once home to the Brooklyn 
Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers), who won the World Series once,[436] 
and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants), who won the World 
Series five times. Both teams moved to California in 1958.[437] There are 
also two Minor League Baseball teams in the city, the Brooklyn Cyclones[438] 
and Staten Island Yankees.[439] The city is represented in the National 
Football League by the New York Giants and the New York Jets, although 
both teams play their home games at MetLife Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, 
New Jersey,[440] which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014.[441] The New York 
Islanders[442] and the New York Rangers[443] represent the city in the 
National Hockey League. Also within the metropolitan area are the New Jersey 
Devils, who play in nearby Newark, New Jersey.[444] The city's National 
Basketball Association teams are the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Knicks, 
while the New York Liberty is the city's Women's National Basketball Association. 
The first national college-level basketball championship, the National 
Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the 
city.[445] The city is well known for its links to basketball, which is 
played in nearly every park in the city by local youth, many of whom have 
gone on to play for major college programs and in the NBA. In soccer, New 
York City is represented by New York City FC of Major League Soccer, who 
play their home games at Yankee Stadium.[446] The New York Red Bulls play 
their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey.[447] 
Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful 
former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pelé. A 
new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and began play in 
the second division North American Soccer League in 2013. The Cosmos play 
their home games at James M. Shuart Stadium on the campus of Hofstra University, 
just outside the New York City limits in Hempstead, New York. The annual 
United States Open Tennis Championships is one of the world's four Grand 
Slam tennis tournaments and is held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing 
Meadows-Corona Park, Queens.[448] The New York Marathon is one of the world's 
largest, and the 2004–2006 events hold the top three places in the marathons 
with the largest number of finishers, including 37,866 finishers in 2006.[424] 
The Millrose Games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event 
is the Wanamaker Mile. Boxing is also a prominent part of the city's sporting 
scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at 
Madison Square Garden each year.[449] The city is also considered the host 
of the Belmont Stakes, the last, longest and oldest of horse racing's Triple 
Crown races, held just over the city's border at Belmont Park on the first 
or second Sunday of June. The city also hosted the 1932 U.S. Open golf 
tournament and the 1930 and 1939 PGA Championships, and has been host city 
for both events several times, most notably for nearby Winged Foot Golf 
Club. The Gaelic games are played in Riverdale, Bronx at Gaelic Park, home 
to the New York GAA, the only North American team to compete at the senior 
inter-county level. Many sports are associated with New York's immigrant 
communities. Stickball, a street version of baseball, was popularized by 
youths in the 1930s, and a street in the Bronx was renamed Stickball Boulevard 
in the late 2000s to memorialize this.[450] New York City's comprehensive 
transportation system is both complex and extensive. Mass transit in New 
York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every 
three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the 
nation's rail riders live in the New York City Metropolitan Area.[451][452] 
The iconic New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system 
in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 469, and by length 
of routes. Nearly all of New York's subway system is open 24 hours a day, 
in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, 
including Hong Kong,[453][454] London, Paris, Seoul,[455][456] and Tokyo. 
The New York City Subway is also the busiest metropolitan rail transit 
system in the Western Hemisphere, with 1.76 billion passenger rides in 
2015,[457] while Grand Central Terminal, also referred to as "Grand Central 
Station", is the world's largest railway station by number of train platforms. 
Public transport is essential in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted 
to work in 2005 using mass transit.[458] This is in contrast to the rest 
of the United States, where about 90% of commuters drive automobiles to 
their workplace.[459] According to the New York City Comptroller, workers 
in New York City area spend an average of 6 hours and 18 minutes getting 
to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities.[460] 
New York is the only US city in which a majority (52%) of households do 
not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car.[461] Due to their 
high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income 
on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually 
on transportation compared to other urban Americans.[462] New York City's 
commuter rail network is the largest in North America.[451] The rail network, 
connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the Long Island Rail 
Road, Metro-North Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. The combined systems 
converge at Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station and contain 
more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines.[451] In Queens, the elevated 
AirTrain people mover system connects JFK International Airport to the 
New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road; a separate AirTrain 
system is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia 
Airport to these transit systems.[463][464] For intercity rail, New York 
City is served by Amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin 
is Pennsylvania Station on the West Side of Manhattan, from which Amtrak 
provides connections to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. along 
the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance train service to other North 
American cities.[465] The Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely 
serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day. The Port Authority Trans-Hudson 
(PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to northeastern New Jersey, 
primarily Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark. Like the New York City Subway, 
the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit 
systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly 
in New York (the others are a portion of the Chicago 'L', the PATCO Speedline 
serving Philadelphia, and the Copenhagen Metro). Multibillion US$ heavy-rail 
transit projects under construction in New York City include the Second 
Avenue Subway, the East Side Access project, and the 7 Subway Extension.[466] 
New York City's public bus fleet is the largest in North America,[468] 
and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main intercity bus terminal of 
the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the 
busiest bus station in the world.[467] New York's airspace is the busiest 
in the United States and one of the world's busiest air transportation 
corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area 
include John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International 
Airport, and LaGuardia Airport; 109 million travelers used these three 
airports in 2012, and the city's airspace is the busiest in the nation.[469] 
JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest U.S. gateways 
for international air passengers, respectively, in 2012; as of 2011[update], 
JFK was the busiest airport for international passengers in North America.[470] 
Plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, Stewart 
International Airport near Newburgh, New York, by the Port Authority of 
New York and New Jersey.[471] Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely 
rebuild LaGuardia Airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its 
aging facilities.[472] Other commercial airports in or serving the New 
York metropolitan area include Long Island MacArthur Airport, Trenton–Mercer 
Airport and Westchester County Airport. The primary general aviation airport 
serving the area is Teterboro Airport. The Staten Island Ferry is the world's 
busiest ferry route, carrying approximately 20 million passengers per year 
on the 5.2-mile (8.4 km) route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan 
and running 24 hours a day.[473] Other ferry systems shuttle commuters 
between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan 
area. Citywide Ferry Service, a NYCEDC initiative with routes that are 
proposed to go to all five boroughs, is expected to start operations in 
2017–2018, with a few routes opening in 2017[474] and the rest in 2018, 
transporting an anticipated 4.5 million passengers annually.[475] Meanwhile, 
Seastreak ferry announced construction of a 600-passenger high-speed luxury 
ferry in September 2016, to shuttle riders between the Jersey Shore and 
Manhattan, anticipated to start service in 2017; this would be the largest 
vessel in its class.[476] Other features of the city's transportation infrastructure 
encompass more than 12,000 yellow taxicabs;[477] various competing startup 
transportation network companies; and an aerial tramway that transports 
commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan Island. Despite New York's 
heavy reliance on its vast public transit system, streets are a defining 
feature of the city. Manhattan's street grid plan greatly influenced the 
city's physical development. Several of the city's streets and avenues, 
like Broadway,[478] Wall Street,[479] Madison Avenue,[299][480] and Seventh 
Avenue are also used as metonyms for national industries there: the theater, 
finance, advertising, and fashion organizations, respectively. New York 
City also has an extensive web of expressways and parkways, which link 
the city's boroughs to each other and to northern New Jersey, Westchester 
County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through various bridges 
and tunnels. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and 
suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is quite common for motorists 
to be stranded for hours in traffic jams that are a daily occurrence, particularly 
during rush hour.[481] New York City is located on one of the world's largest 
natural harbors,[486] and the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are 
(primarily) coterminous with islands of the same names, while Queens and 
Brooklyn are located at the west end of the larger Long Island, and The 
Bronx is located at the southern tip of New York State's mainland. This 
situation of boroughs separated by water led to the development of an extensive 
infrastructure of bridges and tunnels. Nearly all of the city's major bridges 
and tunnels are notable, [clarification needed] and several have broken 
or set records. The George Washington Bridge is the world's busiest motor 
vehicle bridge,[487][488] connecting Manhattan to Bergen County, New Jersey. 
The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas 
and one of the world's longest.[482][483] The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon 
of the city itself. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, 
granite, and Rosendale cement, and their architectural style is neo-Gothic, 
with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone 
towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world 
from its opening until 1903, and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge. 
The Queensboro Bridge is an important piece of cantilever architecture. 
The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, is considered to be the forerunner 
of modern suspension bridges, and its design served as the model for many 
of the long-span suspension bridges around the world; the Manhattan Bridge, 
Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are 
all examples of Structural Expressionism.[489][490] Manhattan Island is 
linked to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey by several tunnels 
as well. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under 
the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest 
vehicular tunnel in the world.[491] The tunnel was built instead of a bridge 
to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed 
through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The 
Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, 
was the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it 
opened in 1927.[492][493] The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion 
on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest 
non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940.[494] President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it.[495] The 
Hugh L. Carey Tunnel runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial 
District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn. New 
York City has focused on reducing its environmental impact and carbon footprint.[496] 
Mass transit use in New York City is the highest in the United States. 
Also, by 2010, the city had 3,715 hybrid taxis and other clean diesel vehicles, 
representing around 28% of New York's taxi fleet in service, the most of 
any city in North America.[497] New York's high rate of public transit 
use, over 200,000 daily cyclists as of 2014[update],[498] and many pedestrian 
commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the United States.[499] 
Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips 
in the city; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8%.[500] In 
both its 2011 and 2015 rankings, Walk Score named New York City the most 
walkable large city in the United States.[501][502][503] Citibank sponsored 
the introduction of 10,000 public bicycles for the city's bike-share project 
in the summer of 2013.[504] Research conducted by Quinnipiac University 
showed that a majority of New Yorkers support the initiative.[505] New 
York City's numerical "in-season cycling indicator" of bicycling in the 
city hit an all-time high in 2013.[506] The city government was a petitioner 
in the landmark Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency Supreme 
Court case forcing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. 
The city is also a leader in the construction of energy-efficient green 
office buildings, including the Hearst Tower among others.[164] Mayor Bill 
de Blasio has committed to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
between 2014 and 2050 to reduce the city's contributions to climate change, 
beginning with a comprehensive "Green Buildings" plan.[496] New York City 
is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed.[507] 
As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water 
filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United 
States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require 
purification by water treatment plants.[508] The Croton Watershed north 
of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification 
plant to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million 
gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current 
availability of water.[509] The ongoing expansion of New York City Water 
Tunnel No. 3, an integral part of the New York City water supply system, 
is the largest capital construction project in the city's history,[510] 
with segments serving Manhattan and The Bronx completed, and with segments 
serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020.[511] Newtown 
Creek, a 3.5-mile (6-kilometer) a long estuary that forms part of the border 
between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, has been designated a Superfund 
site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway's recreational 
and economic resources for many communities.[512] One of the most heavily 
used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey, it had been 
one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country,[513] containing 
years of discarded toxins, an estimated 30 million US gallons (110,000 m3) 
of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New 
York City's sewer system,[513] and other accumulation. New York City has 
been a metropolitan municipality with a mayor–council form of government[514] 
since its consolidation in 1898. The government of New York is more centralized 
than that of most other U.S. cities. In New York City, the city government 
is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public 
safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare 
services. The Mayor and council members are elected to four-year terms. 
The City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 council members 
whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries.[515] Each 
term for the mayor and council members lasts four years and has a three 
consecutive-term limit,[516] which is reset after a four-year break. The 
New York City Administrative Code, the New York City Rules, and the City 
Record are the code of local laws, compilation of regulations, and official 
journal, respectively.[517][518] Each borough is coextensive with a judicial 
district of the state Unified Court System, of which the Criminal Court 
and the Civil Court are the local courts, while the New York Supreme Court 
conducts major trials and appeals. Manhattan hosts the First Department 
of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division while Brooklyn hosts the Second 
Department. There are also several extrajudicial administrative courts, 
which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System. 
Uniquely among major American cities, New York is divided between, and 
is host to the main branches of, two different US district courts: the 
District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose main courthouse 
is on Foley Square near City Hall in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes 
Manhattan and the Bronx, and the District Court for the Eastern District 
of New York, whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction 
includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The US Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit and US Court of International Trade are also based in 
New York, also on Foley Square in Manhattan. The present mayor is Bill 
de Blasio, the first Democrat since 1993.[519] elected in 2013 with over 
73% of the vote, who assumed office on January 1, 2014. The Democratic 
Party holds the majority of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered 
voters in the city are Democrats and 10% are Republicans.[520] New York 
City has not been carried by a Republican in a statewide or presidential 
election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924. 
In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate 
of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, 
sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, 
education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance 
in the city. New York is the most important source of political fundraising 
in the United States, as four of the top five ZIP codes in the nation for 
political contributions are in Manhattan. The top ZIP code, 10021 on the 
Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns 
of George W. Bush and John Kerry.[521] The city has a strong imbalance 
of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents 
in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or 
annually sends $11.4 billion more than it receives back). City residents 
and businesses also spent an additional $4.1 billion in the 2009-2010 fiscal 
year to the state of New York than the city received in return.[522] In 
2006, the Sister City Program of the City of New York, Inc. was restructured 
and renamed New York City Global Partners. New York City has expanded its 
international outreach via this program to a network of cities worldwide, 
promoting the exchange of ideas and innovation between their citizenry 
and policymakers, according to the city's website. New York's historic 
sister cities are denoted below by the year they joined New York City's 
partnership network.[523] Asia (East) (South) (West) Australia Europe (East)
