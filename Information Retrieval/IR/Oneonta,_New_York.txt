Oneonta (/ˌoʊniˈɒntə/ OH-nee-ON-tə) is a city in southern Otsego County, 
New York. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, it had a population of 13,901.[1] 
Its nickname is "City of the Hills." While the word "oneonta" is of undetermined 
origin, it is popularly believed to mean "place of open rocks" in the Mohawk 
language. This refers to a prominent geological formation known as "Tablerocks" 
at the western end of the city. The city is surrounded by the town of Oneonta, 
a separate municipal and political jurisdiction. Oneonta Municipal Airport 
(N66) is north of the city. Indigenous ancestors of Algonquin and Iroquoian-speaking 
Native Americans inhabited the land in the territory of Oneonta for thousands 
of years before European colonists entered the area. The Five Nations of 
the Iroquois Confederacy are believed to have emerged and gained dominance 
prior to the 15th century; they were in place at the time of early French 
and Dutch colonization. The area's early European-American settlers did 
not arrive until around 1775 and consisted mainly of ethnic Palatine German 
and Dutch settlers moving out of the Hudson and eastern Mohawk valleys. 
The first such settler in the area now known as the Town of Oneonta was 
Henry Scramling (b. ~1743; d. 1808). He had secured a grant of 1,000 acres 
in the Susquehanna Valley, moved from German Flatts and settled about 1773 
in the Oneonta Plains near the mouth of the Otego Creek. He left during 
the Revolution and returned after the conflict with his brothers, George 
and David Scramling, and his brothers-in-law, John and David Young. Their 
farms were not far from the mouth of the Otego Creek.[2] The army led by 
General James Clinton passed through the area in order to join the Sullivan 
Expedition in 1779 against Iroquois settlements. The first hamlet developed 
around 1800 and was later known as "Milfordville." In 1830, the Town of 
Oneonta was formed from parts of two other Towns in the county. Milfordville 
changed its name to Oneonta in 1832. In 1848, it was incorporated as a 
village within the Town. In the mid-19th century, the Delaware and Hudson 
Railroad reached Oneonta, stimulating development as a railroad center 
and attracting new industries. Oneonta was once home to the largest locomotive 
roundhouse in the world.[3] The village incorporated as a city in 1908. 
Oneonta is located at 42°27′21″N 75°3′44″W﻿ / ﻿42.45583°N 75.06222°W﻿ / 
42.45583; -75.06222 (42.456003, -75.062302).[4] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 4.4 square miles (11.3 km²). 
None of the area is covered with water. The city is in the northern foothills 
of the Catskill Mountains, lying between Binghamton and Albany. The Susquehanna 
River flows westward past the south part of the city. Interstate 88 follows 
the course of the Susquehanna River past Oneonta. New York State Route 
7, New York State Route 23 and New York State Route 28 pass through the 
city. The architecture of Oneonta consists of a variety of Victorian and 
20th-century commercial and domestic styles, including low-rise commercial 
buildings. Oneonta currently has very few industrial complexes. Because 
of its location, Oneonta does not serve as a prime industrial city. There 
are several historic buildings that were originally homes of prominent 
people. The Fairchild Mansion was placed on the National Register of Historic 
Places in 1974 and was formerly the home of George Winthrop Fairchild, 
one of the original partners with Thomas Watson. Fairchild and Watson were 
the founders of what eventually became IBM. Also, George I. Wilber House 
is a historic home located in the City. It was built in two phases, 1875 
and about 1890. It is a three story wood frame structure on a stone foundation 
in the Late Victorian style. It features a three story, round corner tower, 
cross gabled roof, and a large, very decorative wrap-around porch with 
a porte-cochere. In 1997 it became home to the Upper Catskill Community 
Council of the Arts (now the Community Arts Network of Oneonta). It was 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.[5] Also listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places are: Bresee Hall, Chapin Memorial 
Church, Ford Block, Fortin Site, Municipal Building, Oneonta Armory, Stonehouse 
Farm, Oneonta Theatre, Old Post Office, Oneonta Downtown Historic District, 
and Walnut Street Historic District.[5] The tallest building in Oneonta 
is Nader Towers. Standing 9-stories high, the building is owned by the 
City of Oneonta Housing Authority and is operated as a senior citizen's 
housing dwelling. As of the census of 2000, there were 13,292 people, 4,253
