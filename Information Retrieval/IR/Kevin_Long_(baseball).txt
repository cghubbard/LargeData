As Coach Kevin Richard Long (born December 30, 1966) is a former minor 
league baseball player and the current hitting coach for the New York Mets 
of Major League Baseball. He formerly held the same post with the New York 
Yankees for eight seasons (2007–14). Long graduated from Thunderbird High 
School in Phoenix, Arizona. Long was a second-team All-American in 1989 
at the University of Arizona and was also named first-team Pac-10 that 
year. A three-year letter-winner, Long still holds the Arizona record for 
most extra-base hits in a game (five) and ranks in the top-10 in several 
different statistical categories (second, extra-base hits; sixth, doubles; 
seventh, multi-hit games; eighth, total bases; ninth, runs scored).[1] 
Long was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 31st round of the 1989 
Major League Baseball Draft. He played in the Royals system for eight seasons, 
from 1989 until 1996. Long led Class-A Eugene in 1989 in games played, 
at bats, runs scored, hits, doubles, and RBIs. He also ranked eighth among 
all Northwest League hitters with his .312 batting average in his rookie 
season. He missed most of the 1994 season after undergoing surgery on his 
left wrist. At the end of spring training in 1997, Long, who was assigned 
to the Triple-A Omaha Royals, decided to retire, asking instead for a coaching 
job.[2] Long made his professional managing debut with the Class-A Wilmington 
Blue Rocks in 1997. He was named the Northwest League's co-Manager of the 
Year after leading the Spokane Indians to the league title in 1999.[3] 
Long served as the hitting coach in the Royals organization with the Double-A 
Wichita Wranglers (2000–01) and Triple-A Omaha Royals (2002–03). He became 
the hitting coach for the Yankees' Triple-A team, the Columbus Clippers, 
from 2004 to 2006. Long was promoted to hitting coach for the New York 
Yankees in 2007. Long guided a Yankees offense that ranked first in MLB 
in runs (968), hits (1,656), home runs (201), RBIs (929), team batting 
average (.290), slugging percentage (.463), on-base percentage (.366) and 
total bases (2,649).[4] The 968 runs were the most in franchise history 
since 1937 (979). His offense also featured the American League MVP Alex 
Rodriguez, three Silver Sluggers (Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada and Rodriguez) 
and four of the American League's top-15 batting averages. After a down 
year offensively in 2008, Long's Yankee hitters again led the league in 
offense during the 2009 season, in which they also won the franchise's 
27th World Series title, and led the American League in runs again.[5] 
Following the 2010 season, the Yankees signed Long to a three-year contract.[6] 
He was fired following the 2014 season.[7] When Long was still a player 
(though he does not remember which year), he suffered an accident during 
an offseason job with a drywall company, when a 25-pound sledgehammer hit 
him in the left eye, shattering three bones.[8] Long resides in Scottsdale, 
Arizona with wife, Marcey, daughter, Britney and sons Tracy and Jaron. 
Jaron is a professional baseball player in the Nationals' organization.[9][10] 
During the offseason, Long works part-time for organizations such as MVP
