Brian Michael Roberts (born October 9, 1977) is an American retired professional 
baseball second baseman. He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut 
with the Baltimore Orioles in 2001 and played for the team until 2013. 
He played his final season for the New York Yankees in 2014. Roberts was 
born in Durham, North Carolina, to parents Mike and Nancy Roberts. He lived 
in Chapel Hill. At the age of 5, Roberts underwent open heart surgery to 
repair an atrial septal defect.[1][2] He graduated from Chapel Hill High 
School.[citation needed] Roberts enrolled at the University of North Carolina, 
where he played college baseball for the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball 
team in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) of NCAA Division I. His father, 
Mike Roberts, was the head coach of the Tar Heels. No other Division I 
baseball program offered Roberts a scholarship.[3] During Roberts' freshman 
year in 1997, he batted .427, with 102 hits, including 24 doubles, and 
47 stolen bases. His batting average was the second highest in the ACC.[4] 
He was named to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association's 
(NCBWA) Second Team and the Collegiate Baseball Third Team. His sophomore 
year, he hit .353, with 13 home runs, 49 runs batted in (RBIs), 21 doubles, 
63 stolen bases and was named to the NCBWA First Team, The Sporting News 
Second Team and the Collegiate Baseball Second Team.[citation needed] His 
63 stolen bases were more than any player in college baseball that year. 
He became the fifth Tar Heel to be named ACC player of the year,[5] and 
was a first team All-America.[citation needed] Mike Roberts was fired after 
the 1998 season.[6] After the firing, Brian opted to transfer to the University 
of South Carolina, to continue his college baseball career with the South 
Carolina Gamecocks baseball team. Starting at shortstop, Roberts was named 
the best defensive college player by Baseball America. Playing in the Southeastern 
Conference (SEC), he batted .353, hit 12 home runs, and collected 36 RBI. 
He still owns the school and SEC record for stolen bases in a season with 
67. He again was named an All-America and was a member of the All-SEC team.[citation 
needed] Roberts was drafted by the Orioles in the first round of the 1999 
MLB draft. He played for the Delmarva Shorebirds of the Class A South Atlantic 
League in 1999 where he appeared in 47 games and hit .240.[citation needed] 
In 2000 he started with the Gulf Coast League Orioles, hitting .310 in 
nine games. He also played 48 games with the Frederick Keys of the Class 
A-Advanced Carolina League, hitting .301.[citation needed] Roberts also 
spent time with the Rochester Red Wings and Ottawa Lynx, both in the Class 
AAA International League.[citation needed] Roberts made his Major League 
debut in 2001 and played 75 games for Baltimore, batting .253. He also 
played for the Bowie Baysox of the Class AA Eastern League and Rochester 
that year.[citation needed] In 2002, he played 38 games with the Orioles 
and batted .227. He stole 22 bases on 26 attempts. He also played 78 games 
with the Orioles AAA affiliate in Rochester.[citation needed] In 2003, 
he started for Ottawa, playing 44 games and hitting .315. In late May he 
was called up for injured second baseman Jerry Hairston, Jr. He hit his 
first Major League grand slam in his second game (and his first in any 
sort of professional play) in the 9th inning against the Anaheim Angels 
to win that game. He finished with a .270 average in 112 games and stole 
23 bases on 29 attempts (tied for eighth in American League). The Orioles 
season started spring training in 2004 with both Hairston and Roberts on 
the roster. Hairston fractured his finger in spring training, however, 
and Roberts became the opening day starter. After Hairston returned from 
the disabled list, he was moved to right field, leaving Roberts at second 
base. In August, Roberts batted .347 with ten doubles in 107 at-bats. During 
the second week of August, Roberts was named the American League Player 
of the Week for hitting .531 over a span of six games. He finished 2004 
with a .273 average, collecting 175 hits in 159 games. He also hit 50 doubles, 
which led the American League and was third-best in the majors. His 50 
doubles also broke the Orioles single-season record for doubles (originally 
set by Cal Ripken, Jr.) and the single-season AL record for doubles by 
switch hitters. Prior to the 2005 season, Hairston was traded to the Chicago 
Cubs (along with Oriole prospects Mike Fontenot and David Crouthers) for 
Sammy Sosa, thereby cementing Roberts's position as the Orioles' starting 
second baseman.[citation needed] In 2005, Roberts led the AL in batting 
average for the first several months of the season. In addition, he showed 
an increase in power; prior to the 2005 season, he had only 12 career home 
runs, but by late June, he had already outmatched that total. Fans awarded 
Roberts explosive offensive first half by voting him the starting second 
baseman in the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It was Roberts' 
first appearance in the All-Star game. As the season wore on, Roberts slumped 
and the Orioles slipped in the standings.[citation needed] On September 
20, 2005, Roberts dislocated his elbow in a game against the New York Yankees. 
The injury occurred in a collision with New York's Bubba Crosby at first 
base in the bottom of the second inning. The injury prevented Roberts from 
playing the rest of the season.[citation needed] Roberts rebounded from 
his 2005 injury with a strong 2006 campaign. He played in 138 games scoring 
85 runs with 55 RBI. He stole 36 bases in 43 attempts and finished the 
season with a .286 average, hitting seven home runs in the last two months 
of the season. He spent the early part of May on the 15-day DL.[citation 
needed] Roberts played in over 150 games for the Orioles in 2007. Along 
with teammate Nick Markakis, he finished in the AL top 10 for at-bats, 
batting .290 with a .377 OBP on the way to his second All-Star berth. His 
50 stolen bases, a career high, was tied with Carl Crawford for the AL 
lead; Roberts also set career marks in hits and walks.[citation needed] 
On June 24, 2008, Roberts went 3 for 5 against the Cubs in a 7–5 victory. 
His third hit of the game was his 1,000th career base hit. He collected 
the 250th double of his career on July 28 against the New York Yankees. 
On September 21, 2008, Roberts grounded into the final out in the history 
of Old Yankee Stadium. The Orioles and Roberts agreed to a four-year contract 
extension worth $40 million on February 20, 2009. The contract secured 
Roberts through the 2013 season.[7][8] Following an injury to Boston Red 
Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, Roberts was added to Team USA's roster 
for the World Baseball Classic. Roberts batted .438 with one home run, 
two runs batted in and one stolen base in four games as the United States 
lost in the semifinals to Japan. On August 4, in a game against the Detroit 
Tigers, Roberts hit his 300th career double in the first inning off of 
Jarrod Washburn. On September 15, he broke his own Orioles franchise record 
by hitting his 52nd double of the season. According to Spencer Fordin, 
"the two-time All-Star became one of four players all-time – along with 
Hall of Famers Tris Speaker, Paul Waner, and Stan Musial – to amass three 
50-double seasons in his career." [9] On September 29, Roberts hit his 
56th double of the season against the Tampa Bay Rays, setting the all-time 
single season mark for doubles in a season by a switch-hitter. His 56 doubles 
led the majors in 2009.[10] On October 3, Roberts was named "Most Valuable 
Oriole" for 2009 and awarded an engraved lead trophy for his accomplishments.[citation 
needed] Roberts missed much of spring training in 2010 with a herniated 
disc in his lower back. He recovered in time for Opening Day, but started 
the season 2–14 before suffering an abdominal strain stealing second base 
and being forced onto the 15-day disabled list, effective as of April 10. 
On July 12, Roberts began to play in rehab games without having a setback, 
as it is the first time he has been on the field since April 10. On July 
23, Roberts returned to the Orioles' lead off spot for the first time since 
April 9. Roberts suffered a concussion on September 27, 2010, after he 
hit himself in the head with his baseball bat out of frustration. He suffered 
his second concussion on May 16, 2011, when he slid into first base headfirst 
and hit the back of his head. He did not return for the remainder of the 
season.[11] Through the beginning of the season, Roberts continued his 
stay on the disabled list, but traveled with the team and remained an active 
member of the dugout. On May 22, Buck Showalter announced Roberts would 
be starting his rehab stint with the Double A Bowie Baysox and would use 
all 20 rehab games. His final five rehab games were played with the Triple 
A Norfolk Tides. Roberts returned to the Orioles on June 12, 2012, starting 
at second base. However, a groin strain returned him to the disabled list 
on July 3, and after a brief attempt at another rehab assignment, he elected 
to have season-ending hip surgery on July 29 in hopes to return fresh to 
spring training in 2013. In spring training in 2013, Roberts reported that 
he was free of the post-concussion syndrome resulting from his 2011 concussion.[11] 
On April 4, during the Orioles' third game of the season, Roberts ruptured 
a tendon behind his right knee while stealing second base in the ninth 
inning of a 6-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. He was placed on the 15-day 
DL, with an expected downtime of three to four weeks.[12] Roberts became 
a free agent for the first time in his career after the 2013 season. Roberts 
agreed to a one-year contract with the New York Yankees worth $2 million, 
which could reach $4.6 million[7][13] On August 1, 2014, Roberts was designated 
for assignment by the Yankees, and he was released on August 9. In 91 games 
with the Yankees, Roberts batted .237 with 5 home runs, 21 RBI, and 7 stolen 
bases. On October 17, 2014, Roberts announced his retirement from professional 
baseball. He issued a statement that said that he felt like he could not 
play well anymore.[14] On September 30, 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported 
that during a June 6, 2006, federal raid, former relief pitcher Jason Grimsley 
named Roberts as a user of anabolic steroids. The Times reported that Roberts 
was one of five names blacked out in an affidavit filed in federal court.[15] 
However, on October 3, 2006, The Washington Post reported that San Francisco 
United States attorney Kevin Ryan said that the Los Angeles Times report 
contained "significant inaccuracies."[16] On December 20, 2007, the actual 
names in the Grimsley search warrant affidavit were revealed to the public. 
Roberts, Jay Gibbons, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens were not actually 
named in the report and Miguel Tejada was named only for having a conversation 
about amphetamines.[17] Roberts, along with the other four players named, 
denounced the story.[16] Roberts was subsequently named in George Mitchell's 
report on performance-enhancing drugs. According to page 158 of the Mitchell 
Report, Roberts lived with then-teammate Larry Bigbie in David Segui's 
house near the end of the 2001 season. Bigbie and Segui were regular steroid 
users; while they were using the performance-enhancing drugs and Roberts 
was present, he asserted that he did not participate. According to Bigbie's 
testimony, Roberts told him in 2004 that he had injected himself with steroids 
"once or twice" in 2003.[18] On December 17, 2007, Roberts released a statement 
in which he admitted to using steroids on a single occasion. "In 2003, 
when I took one shot of steroids", he said. "I immediately realized that 
this was not what I stood for or anything that I wanted to continue doing. 
I never used steroids, human growth hormone or any other performance-enhancing 
drugs prior to or since that single incident. "I can honestly say before 
God, myself, my family and all of my fans, that steroids or any performance-enhancing 
drugs have never had any effect on what I have worked so hard to accomplish 
in the game of baseball." Roberts further stated that he had no ill-will 
against former Oriole Larry Bigbie whose testimony to the Mitchell Committee 
was responsible for his inclusion in the report.[19] In January 2009, he 
married Diana Chiafair. They had their first child Jax Isaac in August
