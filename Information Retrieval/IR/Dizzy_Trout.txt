Paul Howard "Dizzy" Trout (June 29, 1915 – February 28, 1972) was a Major 
League Baseball pitcher primarily for the Detroit Tigers. Born in Sandcut, 
Indiana, he first played professionally in 1935 with the Terre Haute Tots 
in the Three-I League before signing with Detroit in 1939. Trout played 
for the Tigers for fourteen seasons, accompanying the team to two World 
Series, in 1940 and 1945. In his first four seasons (1939–1942), Dizzy 
Trout never had a winning record and totaled 33 wins and 44 losses. Even 
in 1940, as the Tigers won the American League pennant, Trout finished 
3-7. Dizzy Trout was classified 4-F due to hearing impairment [1] and was 
not accepted for military service during World War II. It was during the 
war years that Trout had his best seasons. Whereas Trout had a losing record 
in his first four seasons, the next four years (1943–1946) saw Trout turn 
into one of the best pitchers in the American League, winning 82 and losing 
54. Dizzy Trout led the American League in wins in 1943 with 20 wins, but 
his best season was 1944, when he won 27 games and lost 14. He led the 
American League that year in ERA (2.12), complete games (33), shutouts 
(7), and innings pitched (352-1/3). He also finished second in the league 
to his Detroit teammate, Hal Newhouser, in wins (27) and strikeouts (144). 
The Tigers' pitching duo of Trout and Newhouser won 56 games in 1944 and 
finished 1-2 in ERA, wins, innings pitched, strikeouts, complete games, 
and shutouts. Newhouser and Trout also finished 1-2 in the American League 
MVP voting, with Trout trailing Newhouser in the voting by only 4 votes. 
Trout's pitching totals were not as impressive in 1945, but he was a workhorse 
in the pennant drive. He pitched six games and won four over a nine-game 
late-season stretch. In Game 4 of the 1945 World Series, Trout beat the 
Cubs 4-1 on a five-hitter. The Tigers won the 1945 World Series, and Trout 
went 1-1 with an ERA of 0.66 in the Series. From 1947–1949, Trout's performance 
dropped off, as he failed to achieve a winning record, and had a total 
record of 23-31. Aside from his pitching, Trout could hit for power. He 
hit 20 home runs, tying him for 11th all-time in home runs by pitchers. 
He hit a 9th inning grand slam against the Washington Senators on July 
28, 1949, helping the Tigers to a victory. In 1950, Trout and the Tigers 
both turned things around. Trout won 13 and lost only 5, and the Tigers 
won 95 games and narrowly lost the American League pennant to the Yankees. 
On June 3, 1952, Trout was sent to the Boston Red Sox in a blockbuster 
trade that sent Walt Dropo, Don Lenhardt, Johnny Pesky, Fred Hatfield, 
and Bill Wight to the Tigers for Trout, George Kell, Hoot Evers, and Johnny 
Lipon. Trout started only 17 games for the Red Sox, and retired at the 
end of the 1952 season. After retiring from baseball, Trout called play-by-play 
for the Tigers on radio WKMH and TV WJBK-TV from 1953–1955. He also hosted 
The Knot-Hole Gang, a sports show aimed at children. Trout broadcast the 
Tigers games with Van Patrick and became popular with Detroit fans for 
his self-effacing humor, scrambled syntax, and folksy demeanor. In 1956, 
Trout ran unsuccessfully for sheriff in Wayne County as a Republican, losing 
to long-time incumbent Andrew C. Baird. He attempted a return to baseball 
with the Baltimore Orioles in 1957 at age 42. Trout made two appearances, 
allowed three earned runs, and retired one batter, for an 81.00 ERA. After 
being released by Baltimore, he joined the Chicago White Sox as a pitching 
instructor and then worked with that organization's front office until 
his death from stomach cancer at the age of 56 in 1972 at Harvey, Illinois. 
He was inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981.[1] Trout's
