The 1985 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 103rd season in Major 
League Baseball, their 28th season in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 26th at Candlestick Park. 
It resulted in the team finishing in sixth place in the NL West Division 
with a record of 62 wins and franchise-record 100 losses. This was the 
first, and as of 2015, the only time in the history of the franchise that 
they reached the triple-digit mark in losses. It is also the most number 
of games they have lost in a season, as well. The Giants were managed by 
Jim Davenport, who was dismissed on September 18, after compiling a dismal 
56-88 record, and Roger Craig, who guided the team to a 6-12 mark during 
the final 2Â½ weeks of the season. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note:
