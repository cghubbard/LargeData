Canadian culture is a term that embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, 
humour, musical, political and social elements that are representative 
of Canada and Canadians. Throughout Canada's history, its culture has been 
influenced by European culture and traditions, especially British and French, 
and by its own indigenous cultures.[1] Over time, elements of the cultures 
of Canada's immigrant populations have become incorporated into mainstream 
Canadian culture.[1][2] The population has also been influenced by American 
culture because of a shared language, proximity and migration between the 
two countries.[3][4] Canada is often characterized as being "very progressive, 
diverse, and multicultural".[5] Canada's federal government has often been 
described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public 
emphasis on the social importance of immigration.[6] Canada's culture draws 
from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote 
a just society are constitutionally protected.[7] Canadian Government policies—such 
as publicly funded health care; higher and more progressive taxation; outlawing 
capital punishment; strong efforts to eliminate poverty; an emphasis on 
cultural diversity; strict gun control; and most recently, legalizing same-sex 
marriage—are social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.[8] 
Canadians identify with the country's institutions of health care, military 
peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms.[9] The Canadian government has influenced culture with programs, 
laws and institutions. It has created crown corporations to promote Canadian 
culture through media, such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) 
and the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and promotes many events which 
it considers to promote Canadian traditions. It has also tried to protect 
Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content in many 
media using bodies like the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications 
Commission (CRTC).[10] For tens of thousands of years, Canada was inhabited 
by Aboriginal peoples from a variety of different cultures and of several 
major linguistic groupings.[11] Although not without conflict and bloodshed, 
early European interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations in 
what is now Canada were arguably peaceful.[12] First Nations and Métis 
peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies 
in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des 
bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North 
American fur trade.[13] Combined with late economic development in many 
regions, this comparably nonbelligerent early history allowed Aboriginal 
Canadians to have a lasting influence on the national culture (see: The 
Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples).[14] Over the course of three centuries, 
countless North American Indigenous words, inventions, concepts, and games 
have become an everyday part of Canadian language and use.[15] Many places 
in Canada, both natural features and human habitations, use indigenous 
names. The name "Canada" itself derives from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian 
word meaning "village" or "settlement".[16] The name of Canada's capital 
city Ottawa comes from the Algonquin language term "adawe" meaning "to 
trade".[16] The French originally settled New France along the shores of 
the Atlantic Ocean and Saint Lawrence River during the early part of the 
17th century.[17] Themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders 
played an important part in the early development of French Canadian culture.[18] 
The British conquest of New France during the mid-18th century brought 
70,000 Francophones under British rule, creating a need for compromise 
and accommodation.[19] The migration of 40,000 to 50,000 United Empire 
Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolution (1775–1783) 
brought American colonial influences.[19] Following the War of 1812 a large 
wave of Irish, Scottish and English settlers arrived in Upper Canada and 
Lower Canada.[19] The Canadian Forces and overall civilian participation 
in the First World War and Second World War helped to foster Canadian nationalism;[20] 
however, in 1917 and 1944, conscription crises highlighted the considerable 
rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones.[21] As a 
result of the First and Second World Wars, the Government of Canada became 
more assertive and less deferential to British authority.[22] Canada until 
the 1940s saw itself in terms of English and French cultural, linguistic 
and political identities, and to some extent aboriginal.[23] Legislative 
restrictions on immigration (such as the Continuous journey regulation 
and Chinese Immigration Act) that had favoured British, American and other 
European immigrants (such as Dutch, German, Italian, Polish, Swedish and 
Ukrainian) were amended during the 1960s,[24][25] resulting in an influx 
of diverse people from Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean.[26] By the end 
of the 20th century, immigrants were increasingly Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, 
Jamaican, Filipino, Lebanese and Haitian.[27] As of 2006, Canada has grown 
to have thirty four ethnic groups with at least one hundred thousand members 
each, of which eleven have over 1,000,000 people and numerous others are 
represented in smaller numbers.[28] 16.2% of the population self identify 
as a visible minority.[28] The Canadian public as-well as the major political 
parties support immigration.[29] Canada has also evolved to be religiously 
and linguistically diverse, encompassing a wide range of dialects, beliefs 
and customs.[30][31] The 2011 Canadian census reported a population count 
of 33,121,175 individuals of whom 67.3% identify as being Christians; of 
these, Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7 percent 
of the population.[32] The largest Protestant denomination is the United 
Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans 
(5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%).[32] About 23.9% of Canadians declare no religious 
affiliation, including agnostics, atheists, humanists, and other groups.[32] 
The remaining are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest 
of which is Islam (3.2%), followed by Hinduism (1.5%), Sikhism (1.4%) Buddhism 
(1.1%) and Judaism (1.0%).[32] English and French are the first languages 
of approximately 60% and 20% of the population; however in 2011, nearly 
6.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue.[33] 
Some of the most common non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly 
Cantonese with 1,072,555 first-language speakers); Punjabi (430,705); Spanish 
(410,670); German (409,200); and Italian (407,490).[34] French Canada's 
early development was relatively cohesive during the 17th and 18th centuries, 
and this was preserved by the Quebec Act of 1774, which allowed Roman Catholics 
to hold offices and practice their faith.[35] In 1867, the Constitution 
Act was thought to meet the growing calls for Canadian autonomy while avoiding 
the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in 
the United States.[36] The compromises reached during this time between 
the English- and French-speaking Fathers of Confederation set Canada on 
a path to bilingualism which in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity.[37] 
The English and French languages have had limited constitutional protection 
since 1867 and full official status since 1969.[38] Section 133 of the 
Constitution Act of 1867 (BNA Act) guarantees that both languages may be 
used in the Parliament of Canada.[38] Canada adopted its first Official 
Languages Act in 1969, giving English and French equal status in the government 
of Canada.[39] Doing so makes them "official" languages, having preferred 
status in law over all other languages used in Canada.[39] Prior to the 
advent of the Canadian Bill of Rights in 1960 and its successor the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, the laws of Canada did not provide 
much in the way of civil rights and this issue was typically of limited 
concern to the courts.[40] Canada since the 1960s has placed emphasis on 
equality and inclusiveness for all people.[41] For example, in 1995, the 
Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Egan v. Canada that sexual orientation 
should be "read in" to Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, a part of the Constitution of Canada guaranteeing equal rights 
to all Canadians.[42] Following a series of decisions by provincial courts 
and the Supreme Court of Canada, on July 20, 2005, the Civil Marriage Act 
(Bill C-38) received Royal Assent, legalizing same-sex marriage in Canada.[43] 
Canada thus became the fourth country to officially sanction same-sex marriage 
worldwide, after The Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain.[44] Furthermore, 
sexual orientation was included as a protected status in the human-rights 
laws of the federal government and of all provinces and territories.[45] 
Today, Canada has a diverse makeup of ethnicities and nationalities and 
constitutional protection for policies that promote multiculturalism rather 
than cultural assimilation or a single national myth.[46] In Quebec, cultural 
identity is strong, and many French-speaking commentators speak of a Quebec 
culture as distinguished from English Canadian culture[47] and other French 
Canadian cultures. However, as a whole, Canada is in theory, a cultural 
mosaic—a collection of several regional, aboriginal, and ethnic subcultures.[48][49] 
Celtic influences have allowed survival of non-English dialects in Nova 
Scotia and Newfoundland;[50] Canada's Pacific trade has also brought a 
large Chinese influence into British Columbia and other areas.[51] Multiculturalism 
in Canada was adopted as the official policy of the Canadian government 
during the prime ministership of Pierre Trudeau, and is enshrined in Section 
27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[52][53] In parts of 
Canada, especially the major cities of Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa and 
Toronto, multiculturalism itself is the cultural norm in many urban communities.[54] 
Canada's large geographic size, the presence of a significant number of 
indigenous peoples, the conquest of one European linguistic population 
by another and relatively open immigration policy have led to an extremely 
diverse society. As a result, the issue of Canadian identity remains under 
scrutiny.[55] Journalist and author Richard Gwyn has suggested that "tolerance" 
has replaced "loyalty" as the touchstone of Canadian identity.[56] Journalist 
and professor Andrew Cohen wrote in 2007: The Canadian Identity, as it 
has come to be known, is as elusive as the Sasquatch and Ogopogo. It has 
animated—and frustrated—generations of statesmen, historians, writers, 
artists, philosophers, and the National Film Board...Canada resists easy 
definition. The question of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated 
by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between 
English Canadians and French Canadians stemming from the French Canadian 
imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally 
close ties between English Canadians and the British Empire, resulting 
in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial 
power; and finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to 
the United States.[58] In the 20th century, immigrants from African, Caribbean 
and Asian nationalities have shaped the Canadian identity, a process that 
continues today with the ongoing arrival of large numbers of immigrants 
from non-British or non-French backgrounds, adding the theme of multiculturalism 
to the debate.[59][60] Much of the debate over contemporary Canadian identity 
is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by 
its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values.[61] 
In general, Canadian nationalists are highly concerned about the protection 
of Canadian sovereignty and loyalty to the Canadian State, placing them 
in the civic nationalist category. It has likewise often been suggested 
that anti-Americanism plays a prominent role in Canadian nationalist ideologies.[62] 
A unified, bi-cultural, tolerant and sovereign Canada remains an ideological 
inspiration to many Canadian nationalists.[63] Alternatively French Canadian 
nationalism and support for maintaining French Canadian culture would inspire 
Quebec nationalists, many of whom were supporters of the Quebec sovereignty 
movement during the late-20th century.[64] Cultural protectionism in Canada 
has, since the mid-20th century, taken the form of conscious, interventionist 
attempts on the part of various Canadian governments to promote Canadian 
cultural production.[65] Sharing a large border and (for the majority) 
a common language with the United States, Canada faces a difficult position 
in regard to American culture, be it direct attempts at the Canadian market 
or the general diffusion of American culture in the globalized media arena. 
While Canada tries to maintain its cultural differences, it also must balance 
this with responsibility in trade arrangements such as the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA).[66] Official symbols of Canada include the maple leaf, beaver, 
and the Canadian Horse.[67][68][69] Many official symbols of the country 
such as the Flag of Canada have been changed or modified over the past 
few decades to 'Canadianize' them and de-emphasise or remove references 
to the United Kingdom.[70] Other prominent symbols include the Canada goose, 
common loon and more recently, the totem pole and inuksuk.[71] Symbols 
of the monarchy in Canada continue to be featured in, for example, the 
Arms of Canada, the armed forces and the prefix Her Majesty's Canadian 
Ship. The designation 'Royal' remains for institutions as varied as the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. During unification 
of the forces in the 1960s, a renaming of the branches took place, resulting 
in the abandonment of "royal designations" of the navy and air force.[72] 
On August 16, 2011, the Government of Canada announced that the name "Air 
Command" was re-assuming the air force's original historic name, Royal 
Canadian Air Force; "Land Command" was re-assuming the name Canadian Army; 
and "Maritime Command" was re-assuming the name Royal Canadian Navy.[73] 
These name changes were made to better reflect Canada's military heritage 
and align Canada with other key Commonwealth of Nations whose militaries 
use the royal designation.[73] Canadian humour is an integral part of the 
Canadian Identity. There are several traditions in Canadian humour in both 
English and French.[74][75] While these traditions are distinct and at 
times very different, there are common themes that relate to Canadians' 
shared history and geopolitical situation in the Western Hemisphere and 
the world. Various trends can be noted in Canadian comedy. One trend is 
the portrayal of a "typical" Canadian family in an ongoing radio or television 
series.[76] Other trends include outright absurdity,[77] and political 
and cultural satire.[78] Irony, parody, satire, and self-deprecation are 
arguably the primary characteristics of Canadian humour.[79][80][81] The 
beginnings of Canadian radio comedy date to the late 1930s with the debut 
of The Happy Gang, a long-running weekly variety show that was regularly 
sprinkled with corny jokes in between tunes.[82] Canadian television comedy 
begins with Wayne and Shuster, a sketch comedy duo who performed as a comedy 
team during the Second World War, and moved their act to radio in 1946 
before moving on to television.[83] Second City Television, otherwise known 
as SCTV, Royal Canadian Air Farce, This Hour Has 22 Minutes, The Kids in 
the Hall and more recently Trailer Park Boys are regarded as television 
shows which were very influential on the development of Canadian humour.[84] 
Canadian comedians have had great success in the film industry and are 
amongst the most recognized in the world.[84] Humber College in Toronto 
and the École nationale de l'humour in Montreal offer post-secondary programmes 
in comedy writing and performance.[85] Montreal is also home to the bilingual 
(English and French) Just for Laughs festival and to the Just for Laughs 
Museum, a bilingual, international museum of comedy.[86] Canada has a national 
television channel, The Comedy Network, devoted to comedy. Many Canadian 
cities feature comedy clubs and showcases, most notable, The Second City 
branch in Toronto (originally housed at The Old Fire Hall) and the Yuk 
Yuk's national chain.[87] The Canadian Comedy Awards were founded in 1999 
by the Canadian Comedy Foundation for Excellence, a not-for-profit organization.[88] 
Aboriginal artists were producing art in the territory that is now called 
Canada for thousands of years prior to the arrival of European settler 
colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state.[89] 
Like the peoples that produced them, indigenous art traditions spanned 
territories that extended across the current national boundaries between 
Canada and the United States.[90] The majority of indigenous artworks preserved 
in museum collections date from the period after European contact and show 
evidence of the creative adoption and adaptation of European trade goods 
such as metal and glass beads.[91] Canadian sculpture has been enriched 
by the walrus ivory, muskox horn and caribou antler and soapstone carvings 
by the Inuit artists.[92] These carvings show objects and activities from 
the daily life, myths and legends of the Inuit.[93] Inuit art since the 
1950s has been the traditional gift given to foreign dignitaries by the 
Canadian government.[94] The works of most early Canadian painters followed 
European trends.[95] During the mid-19th century, Cornelius Krieghoff, 
a Dutch-born artist in Quebec, painted scenes of the life of the habitants 
(French-Canadian farmers). At about the same time, the Canadian artist 
Paul Kane painted pictures of aboriginal life in western Canada. A group 
of landscape painters called the Group of Seven developed the first distinctly 
Canadian style of painting.[96] All these artists painted large, brilliantly 
coloured scenes of the Canadian wilderness. Since the 1930s, Canadian painters 
have developed a wide range of highly individual styles. Emily Carr became 
famous for her paintings of totem poles in British Columbia.[97] Other 
noted painters have included the landscape artist David Milne, the painters 
Jean-Paul Riopelle, Harold Town and Charles Carson and multi-media artist 
Michael Snow. The abstract art group Painters Eleven, particularly the 
artists William Ronald and Jack Bush, also had an important impact on modern 
art in Canada.[98] Government support has played a vital role in their 
development enabling visual exposure through publications and periodicals 
featuring Canadian art, as has the establishment of numerous art schools 
and colleges across the country.[99] Canadian literature is often divided 
into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the 
literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[100] Canada’s 
early literature, whether written in English or French, often reflects 
the Canadian perspective on nature, frontier life, and Canada’s position 
in the world, for example the poetry of Bliss Carman or the memoirs of 
Susanna Moodie and Catherine Parr Traill. These themes, and Canada's literary 
history, inform the writing of successive generations of Canadian authors, 
from Leonard Cohen to Margaret Atwood. By the mid-20th century, Canadian 
writers were exploring national themes for Canadian readers. Authors were 
trying to find a distinctly Canadian voice, rather than merely emulating 
British or American writers. Canadian identity is closely tied to its literature. 
The question of national identity recurs as a theme in much of Canada's 
literature, from Hugh MacLennan's Two Solitudes (1945) to Alistair MacLeod's 
No Great Mischief (1999). Canadian literature is often categorized by region 
or province; by the socio-cultural origins of the author (for example, 
Acadians, Aboriginal peoples, LGBT, and Irish Canadians); and by literary 
period, such as "Canadian postmoderns" or "Canadian Poets Between the Wars." 
Canadian authors have accumulated numerous international awards.[101] In 
1992, Michael Ondaatje became the first Canadian to win the Man Booker 
Prize for The English Patient.[102] Margaret Atwood won the Booker in 2000 
for The Blind Assassin[103] and Yann Martel won it in 2002 for the Life 
of Pi.[104] Carol Shields's The Stone Diaries won the Governor General's 
Awards in Canada in 1993, the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the 
1994 National Book Critics Circle Award.[105] In 2013, Alice Munro was 
the first Canadian to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for her 
work as "master of the modern short story".[106] Munro is also a recipient 
of the Man Booker International Prize for her lifetime body of work, and 
three-time winner of Canada's Governor General's Award for fiction.[107] 
Canada has had a thriving stage theatre scene since the late 1800s.[108] 
Theatre festivals draw many tourists in the summer months, especially the 
Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, and the Shaw Festival 
in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. The Famous People Players are only one 
of many touring companies that have also developed an international reputation.[109] 
Canada also hosts one of the largest fringe festival the Edmonton International 
Fringe Festival.[110] Canada's largest cities host a variety of modern 
and historical venues. The Toronto Theatre District is Canada's largest, 
as well as being the third largest English-speaking theatre district in 
the world.[111] In addition to original Canadian works, shows from the 
West End and Broadway frequently tour in Toronto. Toronto's Theatre District 
includes the venerable Roy Thomson Hall; the Princess of Wales Theatre; 
the Tim Sims Playhouse; The Second City; the Canon Theatre; the Panasonic 
Theatre; the Royal Alexandra Theatre; historic Massey Hall; and the city's 
new opera house, the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts.[112] Toronto's 
Theatre District also includes the Theatre Museum Canada. Montreal's theatre 
district ("Quartier des Spectacles") is the scene of performances that 
are mainly French-language, although the city also boasts a lively anglophone 
theatre scene, such as the Centaur Theatre.[113] Large French theatres 
in the city include Theatre Saint-Denis, Theatre du Nouveau Monde, and 
EXcentris.[114] Vancouver is host to, among others, the Vancouver Fringe 
Festival, the Arts Club Theatre Company, Carousel Theatre, Bard on the 
Beach, Theatre Under the Stars and Studio 58.[115] It also home of Vancouver 
Theatresports League, the improvisational theatre company, wold-known for 
providing an impetus for the present worldwide interest in theatresports 
at Expo in 1986. Calgary is home to Theatre Calgary, a mainstream regional 
theatre; Alberta Theatre Projects, a major centre for new play development 
in Canada; the Calgary Animated Objects Society; and One Yellow Rabbit, 
a touring company.[116] There are three major theatre venues in Ottawa; 
the Ottawa Little Theatre, originally called the Ottawa Drama League at 
its inception in 1913, is the longest-running community theatre company 
in Ottawa.[117] Since 1969, Ottawa has been the home of the National Arts 
Centre, a major performing-arts venue that houses four stages and is home 
to the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra and 
Opera Lyra Ottawa.[118] Established in 1975, the Great Canadian Theatre 
Company specializes in the production of Canadian plays at a local level.[119] 
Canadian television, especially supported by the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation,[120] is the home of a variety of locally produced shows. French-language 
television, like French Canadian film, is buffered from excessive American 
influence by the fact of language, and likewise supports a host of home-grown 
productions.[121] The success of French-language domestic television in 
Canada often exceeds that of its English-language counterpart. In recent 
years nationalism has been used to prompt products on television. The I 
Am Canadian campaign by Molson beer, most notably the commercial featuring 
Joe Canadian, infused domestically brewed beer and nationalism.[122] Canada's 
television industry is in full expansion as a site for Hollywood productions.[123] 
Since the 1980s, Canada, and Vancouver in particular, has become known 
as Hollywood North.[124] The American TV series Queer as Folk was filmed 
in Toronto. Canadian producers have been very successful in the field of 
science fiction since the mid-1990s, with such shows as The X-Files, Stargate 
SG-1, Highlander: The Series, the new Battlestar Galactica, My Babysitter's 
A Vampire, Smallville, and The Outer Limits, all filmed in Vancouver.[125] 
The CRTC's Canadian content regulations dictate that a certain percentage 
of a domestic broadcaster's transmission time must include content that 
is produced by Canadians, or covers Canadian subjects.[126] These regulations 
also apply to US cable television channels such as MTV and the Discovery 
Channel, which have local versions of their channels available on Canadian 
cable networks. Similarly, BBC Canada, while showing primarily BBC shows 
from the United Kingdom, also carries Canadian output. A number of Canadian 
pioneers in early Hollywood significantly contributed to the creation of 
the motion picture industry in the early days of the 20th century.[127] 
Over the years, many Canadians have made enormous contributions to the 
American entertainment industry, although they are frequently not recognized 
as Canadians.[128] Canada has developed a vigorous film industry that has 
produced a variety of well-known films, actors, and auteurs.[129] In fact, 
this eclipsing may sometimes be creditable for the bizarre and innovative 
directions of some works,[129] such as auteurs Atom Egoyan (The Sweet Hereafter, 
1997) and David Cronenberg (The Fly, Naked Lunch, A History of Violence). 
Also, the distinct French-Canadian society permits the work of directors 
such as Denys Arcand and Denis Villeneuve. At the 76th Academy Awards, 
Arcand's The Barbarian Invasions became Canada's first film to win the 
Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.[130] James Cameron is a very 
successful Canadian filmmaker, having been nominated for and receiving 
many Academy Awards.[131] The National Film Board of Canada is 'a public 
agency that produces and distributes films and other audiovisual works 
which reflect Canada to Canadians and the rest of the world'.[132] Canada 
has produced many popular documentaries such as The Corporation, Nanook 
of the North, Final Offer, and Canada: A People's History. The Toronto 
International Film Festival (TIFF) is considered by many to be one of the 
most prevalent film festivals for Western cinema. It is the première film 
festival in North America from which the Oscars race begins.[133] The music 
of Canada has reflected the multi-cultural influences that have shaped 
the country. Aboriginals, the French, and the British have all made contributions 
to the musical heritage of Canada. The country has produced its own composers, 
musicians and ensembles since the mid-1600s.[134][135] From the 17th century 
onward, Canada has developed a music infrastructure that includes church 
halls; chamber halls; conservatories; academies; performing arts centres; 
record companys; radio stations, and television music-video channels.[136][137] 
The music has subsequently been heavily influenced by American culture 
because of its proximity and migration between the two countries.[138][139][140] 
Canadian rock has had a considerable impact on the development of modern 
popular music and the development of the most popular subgenres.[141] Patriotic 
music in Canada date back over 200 years as a distinct category from British 
patriotism, preceding the first legal steps to independence by over 50 
years. The earliest known song, "The Bold Canadian", was written in 1812.[142] 
The national anthem of Canada, O Canada adopted in 1980,[143] was originally 
commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable Théodore 
Robitaille, for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony.[144] Calixa Lavallée 
wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the 
poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only 
in French, before it was translated to English in 1906.[145] Music broadcasting 
in the country is regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications 
Commission (CRTC). The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences 
presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards, which were first 
awarded in a ceremony during the summer of 1970.[146] Canada has one of 
the largest video-game industries in terms of employment numbers, right 
behind the USA and Japan,[147] with 16,000 employees, 348 companies, and 
a direct annual economic impact of nearly $2 billion.[148] Canada has grown 
from a minor player in the video-games industry to a major industry player.[149][150] 
In part, this prominence is made possible by a large pool of university-educated 
talent and a high quality of life, but favourable government policies towards 
digital media companies also play a role in making Canada an attractive 
location for game development studios.[151] Canada has a well-developed 
media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television 
shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.[152] 
Television, magazines, and newspapers are primarily for-profit corporations 
based on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. Nevertheless, 
both the television broadcasting and publications sectors require a number 
of government interventions to remain profitable, ranging from regulation 
that bars foreign companies in the broadcasting industry to tax laws that 
limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.[153] The promotion of 
multicultural media in Canada began in the late 1980s as the multicultural 
policy was legislated in 1988.[154] In the Multiculturalism Act, the federal 
government proclaimed the recognition of the diversity of Canadian culture.[154] 
Thus, multicultural media became an integral part of Canadian media overall. 
Upon numerous government reports showing lack of minority representation 
or minority misrepresentation, the Canadian government stressed separate 
provision be made to allow minorities and ethnicities of Canada to have 
their own voice in the media.[155] Sports in Canada consists of a variety 
of games. Although there are many contests that Canadians value, the most 
common are Ice hockey, Lacrosse, Canadian football, basketball, soccer, 
curling, baseball and ringette. All but curling and soccer are considered 
domestic sports as they were either invented by Canadians or trace their 
roots to Canada.[156] Ice hockey, referred to as simply "hockey", is Canada's 
most prevalent winter sport, its most popular spectator sport, and its 
most successful sport in international competition. It is Canada's official 
national winter sport.[157] Lacrosse, a sport with indigenous origins, 
is Canada's oldest and official summer sport.[157] Canadian football is 
Canada's second most popular spectator sport,[158] and the Canadian Football 
League's annual championship, the Grey Cup, is the country's largest annual 
sports event.[159] While other sports have a larger spectator base, association 
football, known in Canada as soccer in both English and French, has the 
most registered players of any team sport in Canada, and is the most played 
sport with all demographics, including ethnic origin, ages and genders.[160] 
Professional teams exist in many cities in Canada and international soccer 
competitions such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro and the UEFA Champions 
League attract some of the biggest audiences in Canada.[161] Other popular 
team sports include curling, street hockey, cricket, rugby softball and 
Ultimate frisbee. Popular individual sports include auto racing, boxing, 
karate, kickboxing, hunting, fishing, cycling, golf, hiking, horse racing, 
ice skating, skiing, snowboarding, swimming, triathlon, disc golf, water 
sports, and several forms of wrestling. As a country with a generally cool 
climate, Canada has enjoyed greater success at the Winter Olympics than 
at the Summer Olympics, although significant regional variations in climate 
allow for a wide variety of both team and individual sports. Great achievements 
in Canadian sports are recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame,[162] 
while the Lou Marsh Trophy is awarded annually to Canada's top athlete 
by a panel of journalists.[163] There are numerous other Sports Halls of 
Fame in Canada.[162] Canadian cuisine varies widely depending on the region. 
The former Canadian prime minister Joe Clark has been paraphrased to have 
noted: "Canada has a cuisine of cuisines. Not a stew pot, but a smorgasbord."[164] 
There are considerable overlaps between Canadian food and the rest of the 
cuisine in North America, many unique dishes (or versions of certain dishes) 
are found and available only in the country. Common contenders for the 
Canadian national food include poutine[165][166][167] and butter tarts.[168][169] 
Other popular Canadian made foods include the Aboriginal fried bread bannock, 
French tourtière, Kraft Dinner, ketchup chips, date squares, and the cocktail 
bloody caesar.[170] A noteworthy fact is that Canada is the world's largest 
producer of maple syrup.[171] The three earliest cuisines of Canada have 
First Nations, English, and French roots, with the traditional cuisine 
of English Canada closely related to British and American cuisine, while 
the traditional cuisine of French Canada has evolved from French cuisine 
and the winter provisions of fur traders.[172] With subsequent waves of 
immigration in the 18th and 19th century from Central, Southern, and Eastern 
Europe, and then from Asia, Africa and Caribbean, the regional cuisines 
were subsequently augmented.[172] The Jewish immigrants to Canada during 
the late 1800s also play a significant role to foods in Canada. The Montreal-style 
bagel and Montreal-style smoked meat are both food items originally developed 
by Jewish communities living in Montreal.[173] In 1984, Baron Moran, the 
British High Commissioner to Canada, described Canadians as "moderate, 
comfortable...decent and reasonable", but added that, due to the absence 
of competition, "Anyone who is even moderately good at what they do—in 
literature, the theater, skiing or whatever—tends to become a national 
figure. And anyone who stands out at all from the crowd tends to be praised 
to the skies and given the Order of Canada at once." [174] In a 2002 interview 
with the Globe and Mail, Aga Khan, the 49th Imam of the Ismaili Muslims, 
described Canada as "the most successful pluralist society on the face 
of our globe",[175] citing it as "a model for the world".[176] A 2007 poll 
ranked Canada as the country with the most positive influence in the world. 
28,000 people in 27 countries were asked to rate 12 countries as either 
having a positive or negative worldwide influence. Canada’s overall influence 
rating topped the list with 54 per cent of respondents rating it mostly 
positive and only 14 per cent mostly negative.[177] The United States is 
home to a number of perceptions about Canadian culture, due to the countries' 
partially shared heritage and the relatively large number of cultural features 
common to both the US and Canada.[178] For example, the average Canadian 
may be perceived as more reserved than his or her American counterpart.[179] 
Canada and the United States are often inevitably compared as sibling countries, 
and the perceptions that arise from this oft-held contrast have gone to 
shape the advertised worldwide identities of both nations: the United States 
is seen as the rebellious child of the British Crown, forged in the fires 
of violent revolution; Canada is the calmer offspring of the United Kingdom,
