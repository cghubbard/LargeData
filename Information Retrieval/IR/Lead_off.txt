In baseball, a lead or lead off is the short distance that a player stands 
away from their current base. The "leadoff hitter" is the first batter 
in the batting line-up for his team, or the first batter of an inning or 
a game. In baseball, to lead off, or to take a lead, refers to the position 
a baserunner takes just prior to a pitch, a short distance away from the 
base the player occupies. A "lead" can also refer to that distance. A typical 
lead is six to ten feet (two to three meters) from the base. If the lead 
is too large, the runner risks being picked off. If the lead is too small, 
the runner has a disadvantage in reaching the next base, whether in a stolen 
base attempt or in connection with the next batted ball. Also in baseball, 
the "leadoff hitter" is the first batter in the batting line-up for his 
team. The leadoff hitter is usually a player who has a high on-base percentage 
and the ability to get himself into scoring position by stealing bases.
