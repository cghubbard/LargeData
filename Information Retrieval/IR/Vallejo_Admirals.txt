The Vallejo Admirals are an independent professional baseball team based 
out of Vallejo, California. The Admirals compete in the Pacific Association 
of Professional Baseball Clubs. The Admirals began play as a charter member 
of the 4-team Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs, along 
with the Hawaii Stars, Na Koa Ikaika Maui and San Rafael Pacifics, former 
members of the now-defunct North American League. The Admirals started 
play at Wilson Park in Vallejo in the spring of 2013. They club was originally 
owned by Redwood Sports and Entertainment, which also owns the Pacifics.[1][2][3] 
The Admirals were subsequently sold to Joe Fontana, who named ex-big leaguer 
Pedro Guerrero field manager in April 2013.[4] In July 2013, the league 
suspended the team for failure to pay players, employees and rent, among 
other financial problems.[5] The problems were blamed on Joe Fontana, the 
new owner.[4] Under new ownership and a new manager in Tito Fuentes Jr., 
the team returned to play on July 31, 2013, with an 11–2 win over the East 
Bay Lumberjacks.[6] The team finished the season in third place overall, 
winning all of its league playoff games at Wilson Park, but falling to 
Maui, 8–3, in the semifinals in San Rafael. Robert Young, former owner 
of the two now-defunct Hawaii franchises, bought the team prior to the 
2014 season.[7] They played a full season, ending in second place.[8] Kathy 
Beisel and Kevin Reilly purchased the team in March 2015. The Admirals 
played a full season in 2015 finishing with 25 wins, 53 losses - last place 
in the league. For the last month of the season, salaries for players were 
cut by half and the team had a “large shortfall” for the season. At the 
end of the season Kathy Beisel announced that she was selling her shares 
to another principal owner Vallejo real estate agent Kevin Reilly.[9] The 
team is scheduled to play another full season of play in 2016. Pitchers
