The Crawford Boxes are a special section of seating in Minute Maid Park, 
the home of the Houston Astros. The boxes are named for their being parallel 
to Crawford Street in Downtown Houston. Officially the section numbers 
are 100 through 104 (with Section 104 being in foul territory and the other 
sections in fair territory) The Crawford Boxes are located in left field 
in Minute Maid Park with one of the shortest porches in baseball. The home-plate-to-wall 
measurement of the boxes is only 315 feet (96 meters). The 19-foot wall 
that maintains the front of the elevated boxes houses the hand-operated 
scoreboard for other games occurring the same day. Due to their popularity, 
Crawford Box seats are among the most expensive of outfield seats in the 
major leagues (for 2012 an individual ticket is $37). Landry's Restaurants, 
Inc. have bought out the naming rights to the Crawford Boxes, lending the 
commercial moniker "Landry's Crawford Boxes" during radio and television 
broadcasts. In addition, promoters from restaurants owned by Landry's (such 
as Rainforest Cafe and Saltgrass Steakhouse) visit on various days and 
throw gifts such as T-shirts, keychains, frisbees, and stuffed animals 
to the fans in the boxes. Traditionally, any fan that catches a home run 
ball that lands in the Crawford Boxes wins a gift certificate to a Landry's
