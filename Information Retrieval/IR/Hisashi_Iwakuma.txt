Hisashi Iwakuma (岩隈 久志, Iwakuma Hisashi?, born April 12, 1981) is a Japanese 
professional baseball pitcher for the Seattle Mariners of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He previously played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) 
for the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes and Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. Iwakuma 
made his professional debut with the Buffaloes in 2000. He was named a 
NPB All-Star in 2003 and 2004, and played in the 2004 Athens Olympics. 
He joined the Eagles in 2005. As the Eagles' reigning staff ace, Iwakuma 
won the Eiji Sawamura Award in 2008, and was also a NPB All-Star that year. 
He appeared in the 2009 World Baseball Classic for the Japanese national 
team. Iwakuma was posted to Major League Baseball after the 2010 season, 
but he failed to come to an agreement with the winning bidder. After the 
2011 season, Iwakuma signed with the Mariners. He was an MLB All-Star in 
2013, as well as the third-place finisher for the 2013 American League 
Cy Young Award. On August 12, 2015, Iwakuma became the second Japanese 
player ever to pitch a no-hitter in Major League Baseball (joining Hideo 
Nomo, who threw two), throwing a three-walk, seven-strikeout 3–0 win over 
the Baltimore Orioles at Safeco Field[1] It was also his first career complete 
game, and the Mariners' fifth no-hitter in team history. Iwakuma was born 
in Higashiyamato, Tokyo, and began playing baseball in the first grade 
before attending Horikoshi High School in Nakano.[2] Iwakuma was inspired 
to become a pitcher after "looking up to" former Seibu Lions great Hisanobu 
Watanabe, who was known for his big-game pitching.[3] While he never made 
it to a national tournament during his high school career, he led his team 
to the semi-finals of the West Tokyo Tournament as a senior in the summer 
of 1999. The Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes picked him in the fifth round of 
the 1999 Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) amateur draft. Iwakuma spent 
the entirety of his rookie season (2000) with the Buffaloes' nigun (Japanese 
for "minor league" or "farm team") team, clocking 149 km/h (93 mph) with 
his fastball at one point but making only two appearances all year in the 
Western League. Iwakuma made his debut at the ichigun ("major league") 
level the following year, appearing in relief in a game against the Nippon-Ham 
Fighters on May 29 2001 and earning the first career win of his professional 
career despite giving up a run over 1 2⁄3 innings. He made his first start 
on June 10 against the Fighters and threw his first career complete game 
(a two-hit shutout) against the Seibu Lions on September 18, finishing 
the year with a 4–2 record and playing an important role in the Buffaloes' 
league title that year. Iwakuma secured a spot in the team's starting rotation 
by 2002, the following season, going 8–7 with a much-improved 3.69 ERA 
in 141 1⁄3 innings. He enjoyed a breakout year in 2003, going 15–10 with 
a 3.45 ERA and 149 strikeouts and leading the league with 11 complete games. 
Iwakuma began the 2004 season 12–0 and establishing a franchise record 
for most consecutive wins to start the season. He received the most fan 
votes among Pacific League starting pitchers for the NPB All-Star Game 
that year, starting Game 1 at Nagoya Dome on July 10, and pitched in the 
2004 Athens Olympics as a member of the Japanese national team in August. 
He finished with a 15–2 record for the year, leading the league in both 
wins and winning percentage (.882)[4] for the first time in his career. 
He also pitched in Game 5 of the MLB All-Star Series held in November, 
holding the MLB All-Stars to one run over seven innings to earn the win. 
Following the 2004 season, Iwakuma's Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave, another 
Pacific League team based in the Kansai region, opted to merge to alleviate 
some of their financial difficulties, later leading to the addition of 
a new team named the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles that would fill the void 
created by the merger. Iwakuma was initially named a member of the newly 
formed Orix Buffaloes in a dispersal draft held that November, but refused 
to comply and join the Buffaloes and became involved in a contractual dispute.[5][6] 
Although the Buffaloes attempted to persuade him to play for their team, 
they eventually agreed to trade him to the Eagles in exchange for cash.[7] 
Iwakuma was named the Eagles' starter for the 2005 season opener, holding 
the Chiba Lotte Marines to one run while going the distance on March 26 
and earning the expansion team's first-ever win.[8] However, while he did 
not miss a single start during the regular season, he was bothered by tenderness 
in his shoulder throughout the year, finishing with just nine wins (amidst 
15 losses) and an ERA of 4.99 (worst among all qualifying pitchers).[9] 
Iwakuma's injury woes continued into the 2006 season. His struggles to 
adapt to the league's new rules on pitching motions during Spring training, 
combined with lingering concerns about his shoulder condition, caused him 
to miss the season opener and spend the entire first half of the season 
with the nigun team undergoing a rehab stint. He made his first appearance 
of the season against the Fighters on August 29, but did not record a win 
until September 12 in a game against the Marines, finishing the season 
with a 1–2 record and 3.72 ERA in just six starts. In 2007, Iwakuma was 
named the starter for the season opener for the first time in two years, 
taking the mound on March 24 against the Lions. While he was slated to 
start the Eagles' first home game of the season on March 31 against the 
Buffaloes as well, he reported stiffness in his back just hours before 
the game, causing him to be scratched from the lineup and sent down to 
the minors for rehab the next day. He returned at the end of April only 
to be demoted again just weeks later with a left oblique strain. Iwakuma 
finally returned after the All-Star break, notching his second win of the 
season on July 31 and finishing the season with a 5–5 record in 16 games 
and an ERA of 3.40. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow 
in October.[10] Chosen to start the season opener for the second straight 
year (and fourth time overall), Iwakuma pitched against the Fukuoka SoftBank 
Hawks on March 20, 2008, but fell short of the win despite limiting the 
Hawks to just one run over seven innings (then-closer Domingo Guzmán gave 
up a walk-off home run to outfielder Hiroshi Shibahara, handing Iwakuma 
a no-decision in a 4–3 loss). However, he recorded his first complete game 
shutout with the Eagles in his next start on March 27 against the Buffaloes 
and recorded his 10th win of the season in another complete game shutout 
against the Yomiuri Giants in an interleague game on June 15, marking the 
first time he had reached double-digit wins since 2003, when he was still 
with the Buffaloes. Though he expressed disappointment that he was not 
chosen to play in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a member of the national 
team (even though he ranked among the league leaders in several categories 
at the time), he notched his 16th win of the season, a new career high, 
on August 16 against the Marines, passing 1000 career innings pitched in 
that same game. On September 22, in a game against the Saitama Seibu Lions, 
Iwakuma threw seven innings of one-run ball to become the first 20-game 
winner in the Pacific League since Hawks right-hander Kazumi Saito achieved 
the feat in 2003.[11] He picked up one more win on October 5 against the 
Hawks, becoming the first 21-game winner in 23 years (former Hankyu Braves 
right-hander Yoshinori Satoh won 21 games in 1985) and passing young rival 
and fellow ace Yu Darvish of the Fighters to lead the league in ERA (1.87) 
in his final start of the season. Iwakuma finished his dominant 2008 campaign 
with a 21–4 record, leading the league in wins, ERA, and winning percentage 
(.840).[12] He gave up just three home runs in 201 2⁄3 innings all year, 
of which just one was to a Pacific League hitter (the other two were given 
up in interleague games), and won nearly one-third of the Eagles' 65 wins 
in the regular season himself. He was presented the Sawamura, Most Valuable 
Player and Best Nine awards at the end of the season, a rare accomplishment 
for a player on a fifth-place team.[13] Iwakuma started the season opener 
for the Eagles for the third straight year in 2009, requiring just 59 pitches 
to throw six innings of one-run ball en route to the win on April 3 in 
a much-hyped match-up with World Baseball Classic teammate and 22-year-old 
Fighters right-hander Yu Darvish (who threw 121 pitches in a complete game 
loss, all three runs given up in the first inning).[14] He recorded his 
first complete game of the year on May 16 against the Hawks.[15] On October 
4, 2010, the Golden Eagles granted permission for Iwakuma to pursue a career 
in Major League Baseball via the posting system.[16] The Oakland Athletics 
won the bidding.[17] However, Iwakuma and the Athletics could not come 
to terms on a contract in the thirty-day negotiating period.[18] Iwakuma 
signed with the Seattle Mariners prior to the 2012 Major League Baseball 
season, for $1.5 million guaranteed, plus an additional $3.4 million in 
incentives linked to starts, innings pitched, and awards.[19] He was part 
of the Mariners' bullpen to start the season and did not pitch until the 
club's fifteenth game, making him the last member of any team's opening 
day roster (who was not injured or demoted to the minor leagues) to appear 
in a game.[20] Iwakuma later became an effective member of the Mariners' 
pitching staff, pitching in 30 games (16 starts and 14 relief appearances), 
going 9–5 with two saves and a 3.16 earned run average. On November 2, 
2012, Iwakuma agreed to a two-year, $14 million extension with an option 
for 2015. Iwakuma earned $6.5 million in 2013 and 2014, and his option 
for 2015 is worth $7 million with a $1 million buyout.[21] Iwakuma was 
chosen along with Félix Hernández to represent the Mariners at the 2013 
MLB All-Star Game.[citation needed] However, he did not pitch, as he had 
played on the Sunday before the game. On September 18, 2013, Iwakuma pitched 
eight scoreless innings against the Detroit Tigers striking out Miguel 
Cabrera twice making him 0 for 4 and lowering his batting average to .347. 
He gave up no runs and four hits getting out of two bases loaded jams in 
the first and fourth. Iwakuma finished third in the 2013 American League 
Cy Young Award voting, behind winner Max Scherzer and runner up Yu Darvish.[citation 
needed] He finished the year third in the league in ERA, third in innings 
pitched, second in WHIP and first in WAR.[22] His 2013 season year finished 
14–6 with a 2.66 ERA and a 1.00 WHIP. Iwakuma sustained a strained tendon 
in his finger in February 2014 and was expected to miss 4–6 weeks.[23] 
On May 3, Iwakuma returned from the DL to play against the Astros.[citation 
needed] Making 28 starts in 2014, Iwakuma finished 15–9 with a 3.52 ERA. 
On April 21, 2015, Iwakuma was placed on the DL with a strained lat muscle. 
He was activated by Seattle on July 6.[24] On August 12, 2015, at Safeco 
Field against the Baltimore Orioles, Iwakuma threw the fifth no-hitter 
in Mariners history. It was also his first career complete game.[1] For 
his effort, Iwakuma won the American League Player of the Week Award. Making 
20 starts in 2015, Iwakuma finished with a 9–5 record and a 3.54 ERA.[citation 
needed] On December 17, 2015, Iwakuma re-signed with the Mariners on a 
1-year contract, with vesting options for 2017 and 2018.[25] Iwakuma had 
previously agreed to a 3-year, $45 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
but the deal fell through because the Dodgers had some concerns about the 
results of his physical.[26] Iwakuma made his first appearance on the international 
stage when he was named to the Japanese national team that would play in 
the 2004 Athens Olympics. Coming off a torrid 12–0 start to the regular 
season, Iwakuma took the mound in the second game of the preliminary round 
against the Netherlands on August 16. However, he allowed seven baserunners 
(three hits, three walks and a hit-batter) and gave up three runs (two 
earned) against a team that was viewed as the heavy underdog, leading head 
coach (and acting manager) Kiyoshi Nakahata to pull him from the game after 
just 1 2⁄3 innings.[27] Though Japan went on to win the game 8–3 behind 
a strong relief effort (five shutout innings) by current New York Yankees 
right-hander Hiroki Kuroda, Iwakuma lost the trust of the coaching staff 
and did not pitch in the tournament again. Chosen to play in the 2009 World 
Baseball Classic as a member of the national team,[28] Iwakuma made his 
first appearance of the tournament in the final game of the first round 
against South Korea on March 9, holding them just one run over 5 1⁄3 innings 
but receiving no run support and being charged with the loss. He pitched 
six shutout innings in his second start against Cuba in the second round 
on March 18, earning his first win of the tournament.[29] His stellar effort 
convinced manager Tatsunori Hara to choose him over Darvish, who had been 
unofficially tabbed as the staff ace prior to the tournament, as the starter 
for Japan in the championship game against South Korea. Iwakuma did not 
disappoint, limiting the team to just two runs over 7 2⁄3 innings.[30] 
While Darvish gave up the tying run in the ninth after coming on in relief, 
Iwakuma played an instrumental role in Japan's eventual win and second 
consecutive title.[31] Boston Red Sox right-hander Daisuke Matsuzaka earned 
MVP honors for the tournament, largely on merit of his perfect 3–0 record, 
but Iwakuma finished the tournament with the lowest ERA (1.35) of any pitcher 
that threw 15 or more innings and was one of three pitchers named to the 
All-Tournament team.[32] Iwakuma is a 6-foot-3-inch (1.91 m), 210-pound 
(95 kg), right-hander pitcher with a three-quarters delivery. He was well 
known for his unique pitching motion during his years with the Buffaloes, 
letting his throwing arm hang at his side while he raised his left leg, 
lowered it halfway once, then raised it again before driving towards the 
plate. He was forced to overhaul his mechanics and implement a more orthodox 
delivery when the NPB changed its rules on pitching motions in the 2005 
off-season, taking a stricter stance on so-called two-stage motions (those 
with pauses or breaks at any point in the delivery).[33] In 2008, Iwakuma 
also raised his arm slot slightly to induce more movement in his offspeed 
pitches. Iwakuma's four-seam fastball was clocked at speeds as high as 
153 km/h (95 mph) earlier in his NPB career. Since hurting his shoulder, 
it has usually sat in 88–92 mph (tops out at 94 mph). He complements it 
with an above-average splitter (84–87 mph), a slider (80–82 mph), an occasional 
curveball (71–73 mph), and a shuuto (two-seamer/sinker, 87–91 mph),[34][35] 
often using the splitter as his out pitch. He records a moderate number 
of strikeouts each season but is inherently a groundball pitcher, adept 
at jamming opposing hitters with his wide assortment of offspeed pitches 
and excellent command[36][37] (2.00 career walks per nine innings rate 
in NPB). Iwakuma has also remarked that his command has improved since 
missing much of the 2006 and 2007 seasons due to injury as he was forced 
to overhaul his mechanics and rethink his approach against opposing batters.[citation

him from Japan to Seattle at the start of his Mariner career.[38] Iwakuma's 
wife is the daughter of Koju Hirohashi, former coach of the Seibu Lions.[39] 
Iwakuma practices Nichiren Buddhism and is a member of the Soka Gakkai 
International Buddhist association.[40] He and his wife support various 
children's charities including orphanages and organizations that provide
