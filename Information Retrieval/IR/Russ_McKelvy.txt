Russell Errett McKelvy (September 8, 1854 – October 19, 1915) was an American 
Major League Baseball player who played center field for the 1878 Indianapolis 
Blues of the National League (the only year the Blues were in the Major 
Leagues), and one game in right field for the 1882 Pittsburgh Alleghenys. 
After attending Allegheny College[1][2] from 1873 through 1877, McKelvy 
signed with the Indianapolis Blues of the National league for the 1878 
season.[2] He became the first player from Allegheny College to make it 
to the Major League level, as well the first to hit a home run.[1] It came 
against Bobby Mitchell on June 1, 1878, in the top of the third inning, 
when he hit a two-run, inside-the-park home run.[1] It was the only home 
run Mitchell surrendered during his four-year career.[3] McKelvy played 
in a league leading 63 games that season,[2] 62 of them in center field, 
which also led all National league center fielders in games played.[4] 
His two home runs were third, and his 36 runs batted in were seventh amongst 
the league leaders.[2] He pitched in a total of four games as a pitcher, 
one of which was a start, and the other three came in relief.[4] 1878 was 
the only year that the Blues were at the Major League level,[5] and McKelvy 
did not reappear in the Majors until he made a one-game return, for the 
1882 Pittsburgh Alleganys.[4] In that game, played on August 24, 1882, 
he played right field, batted four times, and did not have a hit. This 
was his last appearance in the Majors.[4] McKelvy died at the age of 61 
in Omaha, Nebraska, and is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Omaha.[4]
