José Milages Tartabull Guzmán (born November 27, 1938) is a retired Major 
League Baseball outfielder; his Major League career lasted nine years, 
from 1962 to 1970. He played for the Kansas City and Oakland Athletics 
and Boston Red Sox of the American League. Tartabull is well remembered 
by Red Sox fans for throwing out the Chicago White Sox' Ken Berry at home 
plate on August 27, 1967, to win a key game during the 1967 American League 
pennant drive. In the bottom of the ninth inning with Boston leading 4–3 
with one out at Comiskey Park, in the first of two scheduled that day, 
the contending White Sox had the fleet Berry at third base with one out. 
Pinch hitter Duane Josephson lofted a fly ball to Tartabull in medium right 
field — a probable sacrifice fly that would have tied the game. Tartabull 
was not known for a strong arm, but his throw, though high, arrived in 
time to beat Berry to home plate, where Red Sox catcher Elston Howard made 
the catch while blocking the plate, then swept a tag on Berry to end the 
game.[1] The Red Sox would win the AL championship by a single game on 
the final day of the season. The play is the subject of a novel, Tartabull's 
Throw, by Henry Garfield, published by Simon & Schuster in 2001. Tartabull 
also was known for his speed and was always a threat to steal on the basepaths. 
Tartabull was born in Cienfuegos, Cuba. He and his wife lived in Puerto 
Rico before moving to the United States. Their son, Danny Tartabull, was 
an All-Star major league baseball player, primarily with the Seattle Mariners,
