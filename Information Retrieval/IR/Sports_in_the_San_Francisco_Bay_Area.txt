The San Francisco Bay Area, which includes the major cities of San Francisco, 
Oakland, San Jose, hosts seven major league sports franchises, as well 
as several other professional and college sports teams, and hosts other 
sports events. Notes: The Bay Area is home to two National Football League 
teams, the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders, who play at Levi's 
Stadium[1] and Oakland Alameda Coliseum,[2] respectively. The 49ers have 
won five Super Bowls (XVI,[3] XIX,[4] XXIII,[5] XXIV,[6] XXIX[7]), while 
the Raiders have won three (XI,[8] XV,[9] XVIII[10]), while having lost 
two (II,[11] XXXVII[12]) San Francisco is home to two major league baseball 
teams. The San Francisco Giants play at AT&T Park and have won eight World 
Series titles.[13] The Oakland Athletics share the Oakland Coliseum with 
the Raiders,[14] and the A's have won nine World Series. The A's have considered 
relocating to San Jose and moving into Cisco Field by 2017.[15][16] The 
1989 World Series was known as the "Earthquake Series", "Bay Bridge Series", 
and "Battle of the Bay", as both teams played against each other, and Oakland 
swept the Giants in a 4-game series.[17] However, the series is probably 
best known for the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake which struck on the day 
of Game 3.[18][19] San Francisco was ranked #1 in 2012 among America's 
Best Baseball cities. The study examined which U.S. metro areas have produced 
the most Major Leaguers since 1920.[20] Oakland is home of the Golden State 
Warriors, who currently play at the Oracle Arena.[21] The Warriors originally 
played in Philadelphia, but relocated to San Francisco in 1962 and then 
to Oakland in 1971. The Warriors are slated to return to San Francisco, 
where a new arena in the Mission Bay district is in the planning stages, 
in time for the 2018–19 NBA season. The Warriors have won two NBA Finals 
since their relocation (1975,[22] 2015 ). San Jose currently hosts the 
San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League. The Sharks currently play 
at the SAP Center at San Jose.[23] The Sharks began play in 1991, playing 
their first two seasons at the Cow Palace before moving to their current 
home in 1993. The Sharks have not won a Stanley Cup in their 25 year existence. 
In the 2015-16 Stanley Cup Playoffs the Sharks made their first appearance 
in the Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins Beginning in 
1996, the San Jose Earthquakes, then known as the San Jose Clash, competed 
in Major League Soccer, and became the Earthquakes in 1999. The Quakes 
won MLS Cup 2001 against the Los Angeles Galaxy 2–1,[24] as well as MLS 
Cup 2003 against the Chicago Fire 4–2. The Quakes then moved to Houston 
in 2005, and became the Houston Dynamo,[25] but in a fashion similar to 
the Cleveland Browns move,[26] the Earthquakes name and history stayed 
in San Jose for a future team. In 2008, the current incarnation of the 
Earthquakes made its return[27] and subsequently played seven seasons at 
Buck Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara. In March 2015, the Earthquakes opened 
Avaya Stadium across from San Jose International Airport.[28] San Rafael 
is home to the San Rafael Pacifics, an independent minor league baseball 
team that play in the Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs. 
The Pacifics play in 1,200 seat Albert Park. Sonoma is the home to the 
Sonoma Stompers, an independent minor league baseball team, that plays 
in the Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs. The Stompers 
play a short season schedule from June through August every summer, with 
39 home games at Arnold Field in Sonoma. The Stompers were a part of Professional 
Baseball History in the summer of 2015 when Sean Conroy, a Stompers pitcher, 
became the first openly gay professional baseball player.[citation needed] 
The scorecard and other memorabilia from that game went on display in the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York in November 2015. 
Additionally, the team helped set another record, when Bill "Spaceman" 
Lee, pitched 5 2/3 innings on Aug. 9, 2014, while yielding six hits and 
three earned runs in posting Sonoma's victory and breaking his own record 
as the oldest player to ever win a professional baseball game.[citation 
needed] In June 2015, the team signed acclaimed slugger Jose Canseco. The 
1988 American League MVP recorded a single and a homer and helped spark 
to victories in his weekend stint. In 2016, it was announced that the San 
Francisco Deltas will join the North American Soccer League in 2017.[citation 
needed] The Deltas are expected to play at the Kezar Stadium. Amateur men's 
soccer has been played in San Francisco since 1902 through the San Francisco 
Soccer Football League.[29] Over 40 teams in 4 divisions play throughout 
the city between March and November. Premier Division games are played 
at the 3,500 seat Boxer Stadium. Amateur women's soccer is played on over 
30 teams in the Golden Gate Women's Soccer League.[30] Supporter-owned 
San Francisco City FC, founded in 2001 as part of the SFSFL, has played 
in the PDL since 2016. In 2015, the Sharks American Hockey League affiliate 
team, the Worcester Sharks, became the San Jose Barracuda and share the 
SAP Center at San Jose. San Francisco Pro-Am Basketball League is an important 
summer league venue for aspiring players to be discovered by talent scouts.[citation 
needed] Games are held at the 4,000 seat Kezar Pavilion. Players from all 
levels participate, with regular appearances by off season NBA professionals.[31] 
San Francisco Rush are due to compete in the inaugural 2016 PRO Rugby season 
at Boxer Stadium.[32] The San Francisco Golden Gate Rugby team competes 
in the Pacific Rugby Premiership. In rugby sevens, the Bay Area will host 
the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens at Avaya Stadium and AT&T Park.[33] The 
Bay Area is also well represented in college sports. Six area universities 
are members of NCAA Division I, the highest level of college sports in 
the country. Three have football teams and three do not. Bay Area Deportes 
is the only media outlet in San Francisco Bay Area to fully cover NCAA 
college sports in Spanish. All three football-playing schools in the Bay 
Area are in the Football Bowl Subdivision, the highest level of NCAA college 
football. The California Golden Bears and Stanford Cardinal compete in 
the Pac-12 Conference, and the San Jose State Spartans compete in the Mountain 
West Conference.[34] The Cardinal and Golden Bears are intense rivals, 
with their football teams competing annually in the Big Game for the Stanford 
Axe.[35] One of the most famous games in the rivalry is the 1982 edition, 
when the Golden Bears defeated the Cardinal on a last-second return kickoff 
known as "The Play".[36] The three non-football Division I programs in 
the Bay Area are the San Francisco Dons, located in the city of San Francisco; 
the Saint Mary's Gaels, from Moraga in the East Bay; and the Santa Clara 
Broncos, located in Santa Clara. All three are charter members of the West 
Coast Conference, and consider each other major rivals. The following table 
shows the college teams in the Bay Area that average more than 2,000 attendance: 
The Bay Area was the host for the 2013 America's Cup. The Bay Area has 
a leading and innovative alternative, outdoor and action sports culture. 
Examples include mountain biking, Alcatraz triathlon, skate boarding/Thrasher 
Magazine, CrossFit (Santa Cruz) and surfing at well known breaks such as 
Steamer Lane, Mavericks, Ocean Beach and Bodega Bay. TPC Stonebrae is a 
private golf club that hosts the TPC Stonebrae Championship, part of the 
Web.com Tour since 2009. With an ideal climate for outdoor activities, 
San Francisco has ample resources and opportunities for amateur and participatory 
sports and recreation. There are more than 200 miles (320 km) of bicycle 
paths, lanes and bike routes in the city,[37] and the Embarcadero and Marina 
Green are favored sites for skateboarding. Extensive public tennis facilities 
are available in Golden Gate Park and Dolores Park, as well as at smaller 
neighborhood courts throughout the city. San Francisco residents have often 
ranked among the fittest in the U.S.[38] Golden Gate Park has miles of 
paved and unpaved running trails as well as a golf course and disc golf 
course. Boating, sailing, windsurfing and kitesurfing are among the popular 
activities on San Francisco Bay, and the city maintains a yacht harbor 
in the Marina District. The St. Francis Yacht Club and Golden Gate Yacht 
Club are located in the Marina Harbor.[39][40] The South Beach Yacht Club 
is located next to AT&T Park and Pier 39 has an extensive marina.[41][42] 
Historic Aquatic Park located along the northern San Francisco shore hosts 
two swimming and rowing clubs.[43][44] The South End Rowing Club, established 
in 1873, and the Dolphin Club maintain a friendly rivalry between members. 
Swimmers can be seen daily braving the typically cold bay waters.[citation

Women's Basketball League called the San Jose Spiders.[45] From 1995–2008, 
as well as between 2011–2015, the Bay had the San Jose SaberCats of the 
Arena Football League, who played at the SAP Center at San Jose.[23] The 
SaberCats won 3 ArenaBowls (XVI,[46] XVIII,[47] XXI[48]), and lost in another 
(XXII[49]). The Bay Area had a United Football League team in 2009 named 
the California Redwoods, who played at AT&T Park[13] and Spartan Stadium, 
though the Redwoods moved to Sacramento in 2010.[50] Before the Sharks, 
the Bay Area had the California Golden Seals, who had been previously named 
the California Seals and the Oakland Seals. The Seals came into existence 
in the 1967 NHL expansion.[51] The Seals played at the Oakland–Alameda 
County Coliseum Arena (now Oracle Arena). The Seals later became the Cleveland 
Barons in 1976 and then merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978 (who 
in turn later became the Dallas Stars).[52] The Golden Seals/Barons franchise 
is notable as the last franchise in North America's four major leagues 
to permanently cease operations. The Sharks can be viewed as an effective 
successor of the Golden Seals/Barons. In the late 1980s, North Stars majority 
owners Gordon and George Gund tried to move the team to the Bay Area, but 
were rebuffed by the NHL. In the meantime, a group led by former Hartford 
Whalers owner Howard Baldwin sought to bring an expansion team to the Bay 
Area. The league then brokered a deal which effectively unwound the Barons–North 
Stars merger. The Gunds sold their share of the North Stars to Baldwin's 
group in exchange for an expansion team in the Bay Area. The Gunds would 
be allowed to take half of the North Stars' roster with them, and both 
the North Stars and the future Sharks would participate as equals in an 
expansion draft. For one season (1995–96), it was home to the San Francisco 
Spiders of the International Hockey League.[53] On September 20, 2011, 
the San Francisco Bulls were founded as an expansion team in the ECHL. 
Beginning play in 2012, the team (based at the Cow Palace) was the farm 
team of the NHL's San Jose Sharks before folding mid-season on January 
27, 2014.[54] Before the existence of the current San Jose Earthquakes 
of MLS, a separate San Jose Earthquakes played for the original North American 
Soccer League, Major Indoor Soccer League, and the Western Soccer Alliance.[55] 
After they folded, the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks played for the WSA. 
Eventually, the Blawkhawks became the San Jose Hawks, and folded in 1993. 
San Jose Grizzlies were a professional indoor soccer team based in San 
Jose, California. The team was founded in 1993 as a member of the Continental 
Indoor Soccer League. After playing in the 1994 and 1995 CISL seasons, 
the Grizzlies folded following the 1995 season. The team played at San 
Jose Arena.[56] FC Gold Pride was a charter member of Women's Professional 
Soccer, playing alongside the Earthquakes in the league's inaugural 2009 
season before moving to Hayward for 2010. Led by Brazilian star Marta, 
the team had a championship season in 2010, but folded after the season.[57] 
WPS itself played only one more season before folding. Levi's Stadium,
