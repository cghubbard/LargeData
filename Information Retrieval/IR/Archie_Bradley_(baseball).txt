Archie N. Bradley (born August 10, 1992) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
was drafted seventh overall by the Diamondbacks in the 2011 Major League 
Baseball Draft. After transferring from Muskogee High School to Broken 
Arrow Senior High School before his junior year,[1] Bradley quickly became 
the starting quarterback on the school's varsity football team and a starting 
pitcher for the baseball team. After his junior year, Bradley was named 
to the 2010 Aflac All-American Baseball Classic roster.[2] In 2011, during 
his senior season, he led the team to a 36–2 record and its first 6A State 
Championship since 1991. In the championship game against the Rams of Owasso 
High School, Bradley struck out 14 batters and allowed just two hits over 
seven innings in a 4–0 win.[3] He finished his senior season with a 12–1 
record, allowing just three earned runs in 71 1⁄3 innings, walking 11 batters 
and striking out 133.[4] Bradley was expected to be drafted in the first 
round of the 2011 draft. He committed to play both football and baseball 
at the University of Oklahoma, but due to his high draft status, eventually 
signed a professional baseball contract.[5] ESPN baseball insider, Keith 
Law, ranked Bradley as the number nine prospect in the 2011 draft. Archie 
was selected as the 7th Overall pick in the 2011 MLB Draft to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks.[6] On August 15, 2011, with only minutes left until the signing 
deadline, Bradley signed a contract with the Diamondbacks for $5 million, 
to be spread out over five years due to his two-sport abilities. Instead 
of going to college to play both football and baseball, he was sent to 
Arizona for workouts at the rookie level before being sent to the Arizona 
League.[7] Prior to the 2012 season, he was ranked as the 25th-best prospect 
in baseball by Baseball America.[8] In 2012, Bradley went 12–6 with a 3.84 
ERA for Low-A South Bend (Midwest League). He pitched 136 innings with 
152 strikeouts with a WHIP of 1.26. In 2015, Bradley made the Diamondbacks 
opening day roster.[9] He made the start in his MLB debut on April 11, 
2015 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Bradley pitched 6 shutout innings, 
giving up 1 hit and 4 walks, and striking out 6. He also got his first 
major league hit, a single.[10] Bradley defeated 2014 Cy Young Award winner, 
and 2014 NL MVP, Clayton Kershaw in the 6-0 Diamondbacks win, becoming 
the fifth rookie pitcher to make his first start against a Cy Young winner 
since 2003, and the fourth to win the game.[10] On April 16 Bradley opposed 
2014 World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner becoming the first pitcher in MLB 
history to face the defending Cy Young Award Winner and the World Series 
MVP in his first two starts. He earned a no decision in 6 2/3 innings pitched 
in a Diamondbacks 7-6 win in 12 innings. During a game against the Colorado 
Rockies on April 28, 2015, Bradley was hit in the face by a line drive 
off the bat of Carlos González, rendering him unconscious for three minutes 
and forcing him to leave the game.[11] The following morning, he was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list with minor damage to his sinus cavity.[12] 
Bradley is a 6'4", 225 lb. right-handed pitcher who features a fastball 
that sits in the 92–95 mph range, topping out around 98 mph. He also throws 
a knuckle curveball in the low 80s that he describes having 12–6 movement.[13]
