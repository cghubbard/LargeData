Jerome Martin Koosman (born December 23, 1942) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the 
New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox and Philadelphia Phillies 
between 1967 and 1985. He is best known for being a member of the Miracle 
Mets team that won the 1969 World Series. Koosman was discovered by the 
son of a Shea Stadium usher who caught Koosman when he pitched in the Army 
at Fort Bliss, Texas, he had written to his dad about Koosman. The Mets 
offered Koosman a contract after his discharge.[1] Koosman was about to 
be cut from the Mets in 1966, when Joe McDonald, the Assistant farm director 
requested Koosman be retained at least until his first payday as he owed 
the Mets money they had wired him after his car broke down en route to 
spring training.[1] After leading all International League pitchers in 
strikeouts in 1967, Koosman broke into the Mets’ rotation in 1968. He posted 
a 19-12 record with seven shutouts, 178 strikeouts and a 2.08 earned run 
average. The wins, shutouts, and ERA set franchise records, breaking those 
set by mound mate Tom Seaver just the year before. Koosman also made the 
first of two All-Star teams in his career. The National League won the 
game 1-0 (to date, the only All-Star Game to end in a 1-0 score) in this, 
the "Year of the Pitcher." Koosman pitched a scoreless ninth for the save, 
striking out Carl Yastrzemski for the final out. Koosman would be named 
to the 1968 Topps All-Star Rookie Roster and finished runner-up to Johnny 
Bench for the National League Rookie of the Year honors. In 1969 Koosman 
posted a 17-9 record with a 2.28 ERA and 180 strikeouts in making a second 
All-Star appearance. That year, he was a member of the Mets team that unexpectedly 
won the National League East title (both leagues were now split into two 
divisions after expanding from ten teams to 12) after not only finishing 
dead last in five of their first seven seasons, but also trailing the Chicago 
Cubs for much of this season, by as many as 9½ games on August 13. The 
day before, Koosman had lost to the Houston Astros to fall to 9-8; he would 
win eight of his final nine decisions. In Game Two of the NLCS against 
the Atlanta Braves, Koosman was shelled for six runs in 4⅔ innings (including 
a Hank Aaron three-run homer). The Mets won 11–6, however, then won the 
next game to complete the series' sweep. Koosman was the pitching star 
of the 1969 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. After Seaver was 
defeated in Game One, Koosman, leading 1-0, held the Orioles hitless until 
Paul Blair singled to lead off the bottom of the seventh inning, eventually 
scoring on Brooks Robinson's only hit in 19 Series' at-bats. The Mets regained 
the lead in the top of the ninth; Koosman got two outs in the bottom of 
the frame, then walked the next two batters, when he was relieved by Ron 
Taylor who induced Robinson to ground out to end the game. With the Series 
shifting from Memorial Stadium to Shea Stadium for the next three games, 
the Mets won Games Three and Four, and Koosman took the mound for Game 
Five. He fell behind 3-0 in the third inning after giving up home runs 
to his mound opponent, Dave McNally, and Frank Robinson. The Mets, however, 
cut into the Oriole lead on Donn Clendenon's two-run home run in the sixth, 
then tied the game in the seventh on a homer by Al Weis, who had hit only 
six career homers at that point—none of which had been in a home game. 
The New Yorkers scored two runs in the eighth to take the lead, and after 
walking Frank Robinson to lead off the ninth, Koosman retired the next 
three hitters to end the game and complete the Mets’ improbable World Series 
win. After catching Davey Johnson's fly ball for the final out of the World 
Series, left fielder Cleon Jones gave the game ball to Koosman. That ball, 
as well as the game ball from Game 2, was stored in a safe in Koosman's 
residence. In the early 1990s, Koosman sold the ball from Game 5. The Game 
5 ball's current whereabouts are unknown.[2] In 1970 Koosman posted a 12-7 
record with a 3.14 ERA. Over the next two seasons, however, he posted losing 
records: 6-11 in 1971 (a season in which he was beset by arm woes) and 
11-12 in 1972 with a 4.14 ERA—more than a run and a half above his career 
ERA to that point. In 1973 he went 5-0 in his first six starts, but ended 
the season 14-15. In late August/early September of that year, he set a 
Mets' record by pitching 31 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings (R.A. Dickey 
would break this mark by pitching 32 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings 
in 2012). As in 1969, the Mets unexpectedly won the NL East title—once 
again overtaking the Cubs, whom they had trailed this time by as many as 
nine games—on the strength of the pitching of Koosman, Seaver and the previous 
year's NL Rookie of the Year, Jon Matlack. This comeback would give rise 
to two slogans: Tug McGraw's "Ya Gotta Believe!" and manager Yogi Berra's 
"It ain’t over 'til it's over." In Game Three of the NLCS against the Cincinnati 
Reds, Koosman pitched a complete-game, 9–2 victory in a game headlined 
by Pete Rose's altercation with Mets' shortstop Bud Harrelson. The victory 
gave the Mets a 2-1 lead in the NLCS; they won the pennant two days later 
in five games. Koosman was the winning pitcher in Game Five of the World 
Series against the defending champion Oakland Athletics, holding Oakland 
scoreless for 6⅓ innings. This victory gave the Mets a 3-2 lead in the 
Series; however, Oakland would win the next two games to repeat as World 
Champions. Koosman posted a 15-11 record in 1974 and 14-13 record in 1975. 
In 1976 he had possibly his best season ever, establishing career bests 
with 21 wins (against 10 losses) and 200 strikeouts. He also finished runner-up 
to Randy Jones for the National League Cy Young Award. In 1977, the Mets 
traded Seaver to the Reds. The remainder of the team deteriorated, especially 
Koosman who slumped to 8-20, finishing tied with Phil Niekro for most losses 
in the NL. After a 3-15 season in 1978 Koosman, seeing no imminent improvement 
to the team, was traded to the Minnesota Twins at his request. His departure 
left Ed Kranepool as the last remaining member of the 1969 Miracle Mets 
(although Seaver would return to the Mets for the 1983 season). The Mets 
acquired Jesse Orosco in the trade that sent Koosman to the Twins. (Orosco 
had been the player to be named later who went to the Mets to complete 
the deal, which had been made two months earlier, in December 1978.) Koosman 
rebounded in 1979 to post a 20-13 record, and went 16-13 in 1980. On August 
30, 1981, less than a month after the strike ended, the Twins traded Koosman 
to the Chicago White Sox. He went 4-13 on the season, again finishing tied 
for his league lead in losses. Koosman posted identical 11-7 records in 
1982 and 1983. In the latter year, the White Sox won the American League 
West title to make their first post-season appearance since the 1959 World 
Series; however, the Baltimore Orioles defeated the White Sox in four games. 
After the season Koosman was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies; he went 
14-15 in 1984 his last productive season. On April 13, 1984 Koosman gave 
up a double to Pete Rose for his 4000th hit. With 222 wins, he is tied 
(with Hooks Dauss) at #72 on the all-time win list. He ended his career 
with a 222–209 record and a 3.36 ERA in 612 games. He struck out 2,556 
batters in 3,839⅓ innings pitched. Koosman has the third most wins in Mets 
history (140) behind Tom Seaver (198) and Dwight Gooden (157). Koosman 
was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1989. He attended a 
40th anniversary reunion of the 1969 Miracle Mets at Citi Field on August 
22, 2009.[3] In May 2009, Koosman pleaded guilty to misdemeanor federal 
tax evasion after failing to pay up to $90,000 in federal income taxes 
for 2002, 2003, and 2004. Koosman admitted to being "suckered" by anti-tax 
rhetoric.[4][5] On September 3, 2009, he was sentenced to six months in 
prison. He was released from a federal prison camp in Duluth, Minnesota
