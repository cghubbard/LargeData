Frank H. McCourt Jr. (born August 14, 1953) is an American businessman, 
president of the McCourt Global group and current owner of the Los Angeles 
Marathon and football club Olympique de Marseille. He was owner and chairman 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Dodger Stadium in Chavez Ravine from 2004 
to 2012. In 2004, he purchased a controlling interest of the Dodgers from 
Fox Entertainment Group, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Prior 
to purchasing the Dodgers and moving to Los Angeles, McCourt was a Boston 
real estate developer, whose family resided in Brookline, Massachusetts. 
In 2013, he donated $100 million to establish the McCourt School of Public 
Policy, the ninth school of Georgetown University. On 29 August 2016, Margarita 
Louis-Dreyfus, the then owner of the French Ligue 1 association football 
club, Olympique de Marseille and the Marseille mayor, Jean-Claude Gaudin, 
stated during a press conference with McCourt that McCourt had agreed to 
purchase Olympique de Marseille. The deal was completed in Paris on 17 
October 2016. McCourt was born in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised Roman 
Catholic[1] and attended Georgetown University where he earned an economics 
degree in 1975.[2] He met his future wife, Jamie Luskin, when they were 
both freshmen at Georgetown. They married in 1979.[3] The McCourt family 
has a long association with real estate and construction in the Boston 
area. In 1977, Frank McCourt founded The McCourt Company, which specializes 
in the development of major commercial real estate projects, particularly 
parking lots.[2] In the late 1970s McCourt acquired 24 acres (97,000 m2) 
in South Boston from the bankrupt Penn Central railroad and developed the 
L-shaped property into parking lots. That property is located here: 42°21′7.81″N 
71°2′42.74″W﻿ / ﻿42.3521694°N 71.0452056°W﻿ / 42.3521694; -71.0452056 The 
McCourt company headquarters moved to Los Angeles in 2004 in connection 
with the family relocating to Los Angeles. The McCourts owned a $16 million, 
13,000 sq ft (1,200 m2) home in Brookline, Massachusetts that was acquired 
by John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox.[4] Before buying the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, Frank McCourt made a bid to buy his hometown Boston Red 
Sox. If he had won the bid, he had planned to build a new stadium on the 
land he owned and used for parking lots on the South Boston waterfront.[5] 
Instead, the Red Sox were sold in 2002 to John W. Henry, Tom Werner and 
Red Sox President Larry Lucchino. McCourt is not the first member of this 
family to own part or whole of a sports franchise. His grandfather was 
part-owner of the Boston Braves.[6] After his failed bid to buy the Red 
Sox, he turned his attention to the Dodgers. In 2004, McCourt bought the 
Los Angeles Dodgers for US$430 million from NewsCorp, Rupert Murdoch's 
flagship enterprise.[7] McCourt's purchase of the Dodgers was financed 
mostly by debt. In 2004 McCourt's South Boston parking lot property was 
used as collateral for some of the financing to acquire the Dodgers from 
NewsCorp. Later the South Boston property was turned over to NewsCorp in 
exchange for canceling acquisition debt.[3] NewsCorp received approximately 
$200 million when they re-sold the property to Morgan Stanley and Boston 
real estate investor John B. Hynes III in 2006.[8] The Dodgers assets acquired 
by McCourt included significant real estate assets related to the stadium 
in Chavez Ravine, including stadium parking lot land. Plans have been announced 
for new real estate developments at Dodger Stadium. To offset the purchase, 
McCourt raised ticket and concession prices every year.[9] By April 2009 
the team and its related assets, in which McCourt had invested heavily 
in improvements, had increased in value to $722 million according to Forbes. 
[10] [11] In 2010 the value of the team was estimated at $727 million according 
to Forbes.[12] In 2003 (under NewsCorp ownership) the Dodgers' record was 
85 wins, 77 losses. Shortly after purchasing the team, McCourt fired then 
General Manager Dan Evans, replacing him with Paul DePodesta. DePodesta 
is featured (along with Billy Beane) in the book Moneyball as it discussed 
their sabermetric-based approach to using statistics to build the Oakland 
A's. In Los Angeles, DePodesta made a trade in the middle of the 2004 season 
that sent the Dodgers' starting catcher, Paul Lo Duca, its set-up man, 
pitcher Guillermo Mota, and outfielder Juan Encarnación to the Florida 
Marlins for the high on-base percentage first baseman Hee-Seop Choi and 
power pitcher Brad Penny and pitching prospect Bill Murphy, who was in 
turn flipped with Koyie Hill and Reggie Abercrombie to the Arizona Diamondbacks 
for Gold Glove center fielder Steve Finley and catcher Brent Mayne. At 
the time, DePodesta said of Choi, "I think we've acquired one of the better 
offensive players in the league."[13] Finley hit 13 HRs for the Dodgers 
in his two months with the team. Choi batted .161 with 0 HRs for the Dodgers 
after the trade, though he walked 11 times in 87 plate appearances. In 
the playoff loss to St. Louis that season, Penny did not play, Choi had 
one at bat (hitless) and Dodger catchers were 3-for-10.[14] In 2004, the 
Dodgers won the NL West with a record of 93-69, but lost in four games 
to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Divisional Series. In the offseason the 
Dodgers decided not to re-sign Adrián Beltré due to his high contract demands 
(Beltre finished second in the NL MVP voting and would later sign with 
Seattle for 5 years/$64 million).[15] DePodesta signed outfielder J. D. 
Drew for five years at $55 million,[16] sinkerball pitcher Derek Lowe for 
four years at $36 million,[17] and All-Star second baseman Jeff Kent. However, 
the 2005 season, with a record of 71-91, was the Dodgers' second-worst 
record since moving to Los Angeles, due in part to players' injuries. That 
off-season, manager Jim Tracy was fired. Soon after Tracy was fired, McCourt 
fired DePodesta and about a month later, hired Ned Colletti to replace 
him. Ned Colletti's first action as GM was the signing of the former Red 
Sox manager, Grady Little. Colletti then signed several veteran players 
such as Rafael Furcal, Nomar Garciaparra, Kenny Lofton, and Bill Mueller. 
These players were among those who led the 2006 Dodgers to the NL Wild 
Card spot, with an 88–74 record. The Dodgers were swept by the New York 
Mets in the National League Division Series. In the winter of 2006–07 the 
team signed Juan Pierre, Jason Schmidt, and Luis Gonzalez. In October 2007, 
Grady Little resigned and Joe Torre was hired as their new manager. In 
2008 with Torre, Ned Colletti signed Andruw Jones, Hiroki Kuroda, and Chan 
Ho Park. During the trade deadline the Dodgers acquired Manny Ramirez in 
a trade with the Boston Red Sox. In 2007 Dr. Charles Steinberg was hired 
as Executive Vice President, Marketing and Public Relations of the Dodgers 
after working with the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles. In 2009 he 
was reported to be on his way out and was said to be allied with Jamie 
McCourt and had lost influence as she did, according to a report in the 
Los Angeles Times.[18][19] In 2010, it was revealed that then California 
Attorney General Jerry Brown was opening an investigation into the Dodgers' 
charitable foundation, the Dodgers' Dream Foundation. According to tax 
returns, the charity's chief executive Howard Sunkin, earned a salary of 
nearly $400,000 per year, almost a quarter of the foundation's entire budget.[20] 
Sunkin is a close associate of McCourt and has worked with him during his 
divorce proceedings.[21] The courts eventually awarded the funds to be 
repaid and McCourt personally repaid $100,000.[22] On October 14, 2009 
it was announced the McCourts would be separating after nearly 30 years 
of marriage.[23] While speculation was raised on the impact upon the McCourt 
family and Dodger ownership, a spokesperson for Jamie McCourt said the 
following day that "the focus of the Dodgers is on the playoffs and the 
World Series." Jamie was fired from her position as Dodgers CEO on Thursday, 
October 22, 2009, the day after the Dodgers were eliminated from the playoffs.[23] 
She officially filed for divorce shortly thereafter. He has claimed that 
the divorce has "no bearing on the team whatsoever."[24] On December 7, 
2010 the judge in the divorce case of the McCourts invalidated the post-nuptial 
marital property agreement ("MPA") that Frank McCourt had claimed provided 
him with sole ownership of the Dodgers. In the wake of this decision, Frank 
McCourt's lawyers said that Frank would use other legal avenues to establish 
his sole ownership of the Dodgers, while Jamie McCourt's lawyers said that 
Jamie would be confirmed as the co-owner of the team as community property 
of their marriage.[25] On June 17, 2011, the McCourts reached agreement 
on a settlement of their divorce. The settlement was contingent upon Major 
League Baseball approving a 17-year television contract between the Dodgers 
and FOX Television. The discussion set aside the Dodgers' ownership issue 
until a scheduled one-day trial on August 4, whereupon if the judge sided 
with Frank he would keep the team and pay a settlement fee to Jamie and 
if the judge sided with her the team would be sold.[26] However, on June 
20, baseball rejected the television deal and the settlement agreement 
fell apart.[27] On October 17, 2011 the McCourts reached a settlement in 
their divorce case whereby Jamie would receive about $130 million and relinquish 
her claim on the Dodgers. This ended what is widely believed to be the 
costliest divorce in California history.[28] In April 2011, MLB Commissioner 
Bud Selig announced that MLB would be appointing a representative to oversee 
the day-to-day operations of the Dodgers. His statement said that he took 
that action because of his "deep concerns for the finances and operations" 
of the Dodgers.[29] This event occurred shortly after an LA Times report 
that McCourt had obtained a personal loan from Fox to cover the team's 
payroll for April and May. McCourt vigorously disputed MLB's actions. Nevertheless, 
Selig appointed former diplomat and former Texas Rangers executive Tom 
Schieffer to oversee the Dodgers' finances. On June 27, the Dodgers filed 
for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection.[30] After much legal wrangling between 
McCourt's lawyers and MLB lawyers in bankruptcy court, he reached a deal 
with the league to put the team up for sale.[31] On March 27, 2012, he 
agreed to sell the team to a group consisting of former L.A. Laker Magic 
Johnson, former baseball executive Stan Kasten and the Guggenheim Partners 
for a record price of $2 billion, the highest ever for a professional sports 
team.[32] McCourt separately sold the land surrounding the stadium for 
$150 million to the same group, while maintaining some economic interest 
in the property. According to the Guggenheim Group, McCourt will have no 
control or influence over the land, but will profit from potential future 
development of it. Also, the new ownership will pay $14 million to rent 
the parking lots surrounding Dodger Stadium from an entity half-owned by 
McCourt.[33] The sale officially closed on May 1, 2012, ending McCourt's 
turbulent period as Dodgers owner.[34] In 2008, McCourt bought the operating 
rights to the Los Angeles Marathon.[35] McCourt's group changed the route 
of the Marathon so that it would start at Dodger Stadium. His "Stadium 
to the Sea" course revitalized the Marathon and in 2010 it drew the largest 
field in the history of the race.[36] During his divorce he briefly considered 
selling the Marathon,[37] but he chose to retain the rights and refocus 
on the race.[38] In 2014, McCourt bought 50% of the Global Champions Tour.[39] 
On 29 August 2016, McCourt entered exclusive negotiations to purchase the 
French Ligue 1 association football club Olympique de Marseille from Margarita 
Louis-Dreyfus.[40]The purchase deal was completed for a reported price 
tag of 45 million euros on 17 October 2016. Within the next few days, he 
appointed Jacques-Henri Eyraud (a French businessman) as the club's president 
and Rudi García as manager of the club's first team. He pledged to invest 
200 million euros in the club over the next four years.[41][42] Frank McCourt's 
grandfather was part owner of the Boston Braves along with Lou Perini and 
others. Inspired by his grandfather and the others formation of the Jimmy 
Fund,[43] Frank McCourt started ThinkCure to fight cancer.[44] McCourt
