Prince Semien Fielder (born May 9, 1984) is an American professional baseball 
first baseman and designated hitter for the Texas Rangers of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He has also played for the Milwaukee Brewers and Detroit 
Tigers. He was selected in the first round of the 2002 Major League Baseball 
draft by the Brewers out of Eau Gallie High School in Melbourne, Florida, 
and spent the first seven years of his MLB career with the Brewers before 
signing with the Detroit Tigers in January 2012. In November 2013, he was 
traded to the Rangers, where he ended his playing career due to injury. 
Fielder is a six-time All-Star and was previously the iron man leader for 
consecutive games played with 547 consecutive games. The streak ended in 
May 2014 when Fielder underwent season-ending neck surgery. He holds the 
Brewers' team record for home runs in a season, and is the league's youngest 
player to hit 50 home runs in a season.[1] He became the first Brewer to 
win the Home Run Derby, defeating Nelson Cruz in the final round of the 
2009 derby. He also won the 2012 derby, joining Ken Griffey, Jr. and Yoenis 
Céspedes as the only players to win more than one derby and becoming the 
first player to win the Derby as both an American League and a National 
League All-Star.[2] On August 10, 2016, Fielder announced that he would 
be unable to continue his playing career after undergoing a second neck 
surgery in three years. Although Fielder is not officially retired, he 
will spend the remaining four years of his contract on the 60-day disabled 
list. He ended his career with 319 home runs, the same number as his father, 
Cecil Fielder. Prince and Cecil Fielder are also the only father-son combination 
to each hit 50 MLB home runs in a season. Fielder was born right-handed, 
but at a very young age was converted to being a left-handed hitter by 
his father, Cecil Fielder.[3] Fielder was a fixture around his father's 
teams' clubhouses growing up. He appeared with his father on MTV Rock N' 
Jock Softball.[4] When his father played for Detroit, Prince would sometimes 
come along for batting practice. Fielder hit a home run into the upper 
deck of Tiger Stadium as a 12-year-old.[5] Fielder attended Saint Edward's 
School in Vero Beach, Florida, for two years, where he played junior varsity 
baseball.[6] Fielder spent his first three years of high school playing 
at Florida Air Academy in Melbourne, Florida. He then transferred to Eau 
Gallie High School, located in the Eau Gallie neighborhood of Melbourne, 
to play baseball there his senior year (2002).[7] He hit .524 with 13 doubles, 
10 home runs, 41 RBIs, and 47 runs in his senior year. He was named by 
Florida Today as the All-Space Coast Player of the Year in 2002.[8] The 
Milwaukee Brewers drafted Fielder in the first round, with the seventh 
overall selection, of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with 
the Brewers, and began his professional career in minor league baseball 
with the Ogden Raptors of the Rookie-level Pioneer League. He was promoted 
to the Beloit Snappers of the Class A Midwest League that season. Fielder 
spent the 2003 season with Beloit, and was promoted to the Huntsville Stars 
of the Class AA Southern League for the 2004 season. Fielder began the 
2005 season with the Nashville Sounds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. 
Fielder earned his first call-up to Major League Baseball on June 13, 2005. 
He served as the designated hitter for the Brewers during interleague play. 
With Lyle Overbay serving as the Brewers' regular first baseman, Fielder 
was sent back down to the Sounds after the end of interleague play. Fielder 
was again called up to the Majors on August 17, 2005, and went on to finish 
the season with the Brewers, where he was used as a pinch-hitter. He was 
the 6th-youngest player in the league. On June 15, 2005, he collected his 
first major league hit, a double, off Hideo Nomo, and drove in his first 
big league run with his second hit of the night at Tampa Bay. After the 
Brewers traded Overbay to the Toronto Blue Jays, Fielder became the Brewers' 
starting first baseman in 2006. He was an early favorite for National League 
Rookie of the Year.[citation needed] Fielder did not get off to a great 
start in the 2006 regular season, going 0–9 with 7 strikeouts. In his twelfth 
at-bat, Fielder delivered a game-winning hit that drove home Geoff Jenkins 
for the winning run in the bottom of the 8th inning against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. Fielder was named the National League's Rookie of the Month for 
April. With his eighteenth home run of the year, Fielder broke the Brewers' 
rookie home run record previously held by Greg Vaughn.[citation needed] 
Fielder led all major league rookies with twenty-eight homers in the 2006 
season. On defense, he had the lowest zone rating among NL first basemen, 
.804.[9] Fielder had a strong first half in 2007, earning a start at first 
base in the 2007 All-Star game over the previous two MVP winners, Ryan 
Howard (2006) and Albert Pujols (2005). On August 13, 2007, Fielder was 
featured on a magazine cover for the first time when he was featured on 
the August 13, 2007, issue of ESPN The Magazine.[10] On September 15, 2007, 
Fielder broke the Brewers franchise record for home runs in a season, hitting 
his forty-sixth in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. The record was previously 
jointly held by Richie Sexson (twice) and Gorman Thomas. On September 25, 
Fielder became the youngest player ever to reach fifty home runs in a season, 
joining his estranged father in the exclusive club. Fielder has stated 
that he hopes to surpass his father's total of 51 home runs in a season 
(1990) as a way of exorcising the demons that have come with being the 
son of a prominent major leaguer. "A lot of people said that's the only 
reason I got drafted... I don't mind people comparing me to him but I'm 
a completely different player. One day I want people to mention my name 
and not have to mention his", Fielder has said. Earlier in the season, 
Cecil Fielder had told a magazine that it was his famous name that led 
to his son being such a highly touted prospect. The younger Fielder also 
saw his contention in the 2007 NL MVP race as a way of proving his father 
wrong, but gets little else from the rift but motivation saying, "You've 
got to look at who's saying it. Let's be honest. He's not really the brightest 
guy." [11] Fielder ranked first in the National League in home runs (50) 
in his MVP-caliber 2007 season, was second in slugging percentage to teammate 
Ryan Braun (.618), second in at bats per home run (11.5) and OPS (1.013), 
third in RBIs (119) and extra base hits (87), fourth in total bases (354) 
and hit by pitch (14), fifth in intentional walks (21) and sacrifice flies 
(8), seventh in runs (109) and times on base (269), and ninth in walks 
(90). In 2007, he led all major league first basemen in errors, with fourteen, 
and was last among eligible major league first basemen in range factor 
(8.49). Fielder earned the Milwaukee Brewers Team MVP award, the Player's 
Choice NL Outstanding Player award, 2007 Silver Slugger award, and was 
voted the National League's Hank Aaron Award winner.[12] Unable to come 
up with an agreement for a long-term contract with the Brewers, Fielder 
and his agent, Scott Boras, signed a one-year, $670,000 deal with the Brewers. 
Fielder was quoted saying, "I'm not happy about it at all", showing his 
disappointment in not being able to reach an agreement with the club.[13] 
On June 19, Fielder hit the second inside-the-park home run of his career, 
against the Toronto Blue Jays. On August 4, Fielder and teammate Manny 
Parra got into a scuffle in the dugout during a game against the Cincinnati 
Reds in which Parra was the starting pitcher. They were having a brief 
conversation, which led to Parra throwing his jacket down and Fielder shoving 
him. Fielder had to be restrained by teammates Ray Durham, Dave Bush, J. 
J. Hardy, Ryan Braun, and pitching coach Mike Maddux. ESPN reported that 
night that the dispute was over Parra heading back to the clubhouse after 
being pulled from the game instead of staying in the dugout to watch the 
Brewers bat in the next inning. Baseball Tonight also reports the exchange 
was started when Parra told Fielder to "get off his fat ass and play defense." 
Manager Ned Yost said reporters asking questions about the incident was 
as rude as "going over to the neighbors' house after they've been fighting 
and asking about it." On September 23, Fielder hit his second walk-off 
home run against the Pittsburgh Pirates, helping the Brewers keep pace 
with the New York Mets in the NL Wild Card race. Fielder was named the 
National League Player of the Week for the week of September 15–21 after 
he batted .462, with 27 total bases, six doubles, 11 RBIs, .533 on-base 
percentage, and a 1.038 slugging percentage.[14] Fielder ended the 2008 
regular season with a .276 batting average, 34 home runs, 102 RBIs, 86 
runs and 84 walks. The Brewers finished 90–72, earning the NL Wild Card 
on the final day of the regular season, their first postseason berth as 
a National League club and their first since losing to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in the 1982 World Series. They faced the Philadelphia Phillies and were 
eliminated in four. Fielder hit the Brewers' only home run of the series, 
in Game 4.[15] After the 2008 season Fielder was seeking an $8 million 
salary in 2009, while the Brewers filed for $6 million. On January 23 the 
Brewers and Fielder avoided arbitration and finalized a two-year $18 million 
contract.[16] Fielder hit his first career grand slam against Rafael Perez 
of the Cleveland Indians on June 15, 2009, at Progressive Field.[17] Fielder 
was one of four NL first basemen who made the 2009 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game, joining starter Albert Pujols and fellow reservists Adrian 
Gonzalez and Ryan Howard. Fielder won the 2009 Major League Baseball Home 
Run Derby in St Louis. Fielder began the Derby with a Rickie Weeks bat, 
but quickly switched to one of Ryan Braun's because it was longer and gave 
him more plate coverage.[18] He made the finals with seventeen home runs 
after the first two rounds, eliminating local favorites Albert Pujols and 
Ryan Howard. He then beat former Brewers teammate Nelson Cruz with six 
homers in the final round. His twenty-three long balls tied for the sixth-most 
in the Derby's history.[19] He also hit the longest home run of the Derby 
at 503 feet.[20] On August 4, Fielder was involved in an incident with 
Los Angeles Dodgers relief pitcher Guillermo Mota. With two outs in the 
ninth inning, Mota hit Fielder with a pitch on the leg, apparently in retaliation 
for Mota's teammate Manny Ramirez being hit in the hand by Brewers pitcher 
Chris Smith. Mota was ejected. After the 17–4 Dodgers victory, Fielder 
went to the Dodgers clubhouse in an effort to confront Mota. The Dodgers 
security guards stopped Fielder from entering, though the incident was 
captured by a television crew. Both Mota and Fielder were fined by Major 
League Baseball for their roles in the incident.[21] Fielder had a good 
September. While playing the San Francisco Giants on September 6, Fielder 
hit his third career walk-off home run in the 12th inning.[22] The Brewers' 
subsequent home plate celebration sparked a minor controversy due to its 
unusual style.[23][24][25] Then, on September 19, Fielder set the Brewers' 
single-season record for RBIs at 127, beating Cecil Cooper's 1983 record 
of 126.[26] He set this record during a game against the Houston Astros—the 
team Cooper was managing at the time. The record-breaking RBI was a sacrifice 
fly, scoring Mike Cameron. He finished the season with 141 RBIs, which 
surpassed his father's career high of 133 in 1991. Fielder finished tied 
for first in the National League in RBIs with Ryan Howard, and second in 
home runs with 46. He is one of three players in Brewers franchise history 
to have 100 or more RBIs in three consecutive seasons, along with Richie 
Sexson (2001–03) and Ryan Braun (2008–10).[27] On January 18, Fielder and 
the Brewers agreed on a one-year, $15.5 million contract.[28] Fielder was 
named MVP of the 82nd All Star Game, in which he hit a 3-run home run.[29] 
Along with Fielder, Braun also hit 30 home runs on the season, marking 
the 4th time the duo each hit at least 30 home runs in a season. Only 6 
other duos have done this in major league history.[30] He became one of 
three Brewers who have had four 100-RBI seasons, along with Cecil Cooper 
and Braun.[31] On September 27 in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Fielder went 3-for-3 with three home runs and a walk, and 5 RBIs. It was 
his first career three-home run game.[32] In 2011, Fielder batted .299, 
led the National League in intentional walks (32, a Brewers record), was 
second in the league in home runs (38), and was third in slugging percentage 
(.566).[33] On defense, he led the majors in errors committed by a first 
baseman (15) and had the lowest fielding percentage of all first basemen 
(.990).[34][35] Through 2011, he had the second-highest career slugging 
percentage (.540) and OPS (.929) of any player in Brewers history, behind 
Braun, and was second in career home runs (230) to Robin Yount.[33] He 
came in third in the voting for the 2011 National League Most Valuable 
Player Award, behind winner and teammate Ryan Braun and Matt Kemp.[36] 
Following the 2011 World Series, Fielder became a free agent. On January 
26, 2012 Fielder agreed to a nine-year, $214 million contract with the 
Detroit Tigers to play first base and bat clean-up in the Tigers batting 
order.[37] It was the largest contract in the history of the Detroit Tigers, 
surpassing Miguel Cabrera's contract of 8 years and $185.3 million. The 
Tigers acquired Fielder to replace the bat of an injured Victor Martinez, 
the everyday designated hitter in 2011. The acquisition of Fielder, who 
had only played first base in his career, required 2008–2011 first baseman 
Miguel Cabrera to move to third, which Cabrera was notably happy to do. 
On April 5, 2012, Fielder made his debut with the Tigers[38] and singled 
in his first at bat. Fielder hit his first two home runs as a Tiger on 
April 7, 2012, in a 10–0 victory over the Boston Red Sox. In his first 
season in the American League, he was voted to the 2012 All-Star team as 
a starter. It is his fourth All-Star appearance overall.[39] Fielder was 
also selected by American League captain, Robinson Canó, to participate 
in the 2012 Home Run Derby.[40] On July 9, 2012, Fielder became the 2012 
Home Run Derby champion, hitting 12 home runs in the third and final round 
over José Bautista of the Toronto Blue Jays. This is Fielder's second win 
in the derby, his first coming in 2009. Fielder became the first participant 
to win for both the National and American League, and joined Ken Griffey, 
Jr. as the only two players to win multiple Derbies.[41] Fielder finished 
the 2012 regular season with a career-best .313 batting average. He hit 
30 home runs, giving him six straight seasons with at least 30 long balls, 
and drove in 108 runs for his fifth career 100-plus RBI season. He also 
had an on-base percentage of .412, his fourth straight season with an OBP 
above .400. He played in all 162 games for Detroit, his third such season 
in his career, and he led the American League in being hit by pitches (17). 
Some in the sports media have given Fielder at least partial credit for 
teammate Cabrera winning the Triple Crown of batting in 2012. With Fielder 
hitting behind him in the Tiger order, Cabrera's walks declined from 108 
the previous season to just 66, giving him more opportunities to hit home 
runs and drive in runs.[42] Cabrera would later confirm in a June 2013 
Sports Illustrated article: "You can see a difference. They pitch to me 
more...I see a lot of good pitches."[43] The 2012 World Series was Fielder's 
first career trip to the World Series. He compiled only a .071 batting 
average (1-for-14) during the World Series as the Tigers were swept in 
four games at the hands of the San Francisco Giants. In Game 2 of the series, 
Fielder was hit on the shoulder by a pitch from Giant's starting pitcher 
Madison Bumgarner. After Delmon Young hit a double down the left field 
line, Prince attempted to score. However, a relay throw from Gregor Blanco 
to Marco Scutaro to Buster Posey tagged Fielder out as he was sliding home. 
This became the first ever 7-4-2 putout in a World Series.[citation needed] 
Fielder was named AL Player of the Week for April 8–14. He hit .632 during 
the week (12-for-19) with 11 RBIs and 22 total bases.[44] He finished the 
month of April with a .301 batting average, 7 home runs, and 27 RBIs.[45] 
On July 1, Fielder was voted in as a reserve infielder in the AL player 
balloting for the 2013 Major League All-Star Game.[46] It was his fifth 
career All-Star selection. During the All-Star Game, he hit a lead-off 
triple in the ninth inning off of Jason Grilli, he did not score but the 
American League still won the game 3–0. Fielder hit .279 during the 2013 
regular season, and his 25 home runs was the lowest total in any of his 
eight full major league seasons until he hit only 23 in 2015. He did, however, 
drive in 106 runs, marking the sixth time he topped 100 in his career. 
Fielder also played all 162 games for the third straight season, and played 
in his 500th consecutive game on September 24.[47] This followed a 327-game 
streak that was broken in September 2010, when he played for the Brewers. 
(He missed one game due to severe flu symptoms.) By the end of the 2013 
season, he had played in 831 of his last 832 regular season games. Fielder 
batted .278 in the ALDS against Oakland, registering 5 hits and 0 RBIs. 
In the 2013 ALCS he declined further, registering a .182 average with only 
4 hits and 0 RBIs. On November 20, 2013, Fielder was traded to the Texas 
Rangers for second baseman Ian Kinsler and $30 million.[48][49] In June 
2014 Fielder underwent season ending neck surgery.[50] At the time of his 
mid-season departure, he was batting .247 with 3 home runs and 16 RBI in 
42 games.[51] Fielder's then league-leading streak of 547 consecutive games 
started was ended.[52] Nearly halfway through the season Fielder led the 
AL in batting average and was selected as a reserve designated hitter for 
the MLB All Star Game in Cincinnati. It was Fielder's sixth appearance 
in the All-Star Game and his fourth selection in five seasons.[citation 
needed] He finished the 2015 season with a .305 batting average, 23 home 
runs, and 98 RBIs. He had to be very patient with his power, but he said 
"the way I'm hitting this year, I'm fine with it." On April 29, 2016, in 
a game against the Los Angeles Angels in the bottom of the 6th inning, 
Fielder hit a sharp single through the shift to score Rougned Odor, making 
him and his father Cecil Fielder the 2nd father-son combo to both record 
1,000 RBIs. On June 9, 2016, Fielder hit a home run off of Astros pitcher 
Collin McHugh that unexpectedly broke a fan's smartphone in the crowd.[53] 
On July 20, it was revealed that Fielder was diagnosed with C4-C5 herniations 
in his neck, putting his career in jeopardy.[54] Fielder announced in a 
press conference on August 10 that, while he was not retiring, he would 
not be able to continue playing professional baseball due to his injuries.[55] 
Fielder was named after the musician Prince.[56] He married his wife Chanel 
in 2005 during the Triple-A All-Star break while playing for the Nashville 
Sounds. They have two children named Jadyn and Haven.[57] Fielder filed 
for divorce in May 2013. By March 2014, he and his wife had reconciled.[58] 
Fielder has a tattoo on the left side of his neck that reads, "왕자", Korean 
for "Prince".[59] At one time it was widely publicized that Prince was 
a vegetarian[60] but he has since admitted that he lasted only about three
