Morrie (Morris) Arnovich, known as Snooker,[1][2][3] (November 16, 1910 
– July 20, 1959) was a stocky Major League Baseball outfielder. He was 
a line drive hitter and he played seven seasons for the Philadelphia Phillies, 
the Cincinnati Reds and the New York Giants between 1936, and 1941, and 
again for one game in 1946. One of the most religious Jewish major leaguers, 
Arnovich kept kosher his whole life.[1] Arnovich was a two-time All-Wisconsin 
basketball star at the University of Wisconsin–Superior. Arnovich's professional 
baseball career began at age 22 with the Superior Blues, the champions 
of the newly revived Northern League in 1933.[1] A shortstop that year, 
he hit .331 and slugged .495 with 17 steals. He was fifth in average and 
fourth in homers, with 14. His .918 fielding was best of any shortstop 
with 50 or more games that season, and he made the unofficial All-Star 
team listed by the Spalding Guide. Returning to Superior in 1934, Arnovich 
hit .374 to take the Northern League batting title, and his 21 homers tied 
for fifth. He hit three homers in one game that year. The Philadelphia 
Phillies purchased his contract in 1935, and assigned him to the Hazleton 
Mountaineers of the New York–Pennsylvania League. He hit .305 that year. 
In 1936, he hit .327 with 19 homers and 109 RBIs. He tied for the league 
lead in homers and was one RBI off of the top pace. He got a cup of coffee 
with the Phils that season and hit .313 in late-season action. By this 
time Arnovich had moved to the outfield, and he would not play any other 
position in the Major Leagues. He primarily played left field. In 1937, 
he hit .290 and had a career-high five double plays from the outfield. 
In 1938, he had a career-high 18 outfield assists, third of all outfielders 
in the league.[4] He was referred to as the "Son of Israel", or the "Next 
Jewish Star".[5] When Phil Weintraub entered the armed forces, Arnovich 
took his spot in the lineup.[6] In 1939 he was the top contact hitter in 
the National League most of the season before fading late and still finishing 
fifth in the league with a .324 batting average.[5] He was 6th in OBP (.398), 
made the NL All-Star team in his best season. He came in 18th in MVP voting. 
At the age of 29, Arnovich was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Johnny 
Rizzo in June 1940 and had a disappointing season, though he continued 
to hit for solid contact (.284); he failed to homer and his lack of power 
was not good for an outfielder. He made his only World Series appearance 
that season. He was sold to the New York Giants in December 1940, and had 
a .280 batting average in 85 games. Arnovich tried to volunteer for the 
United States Army, but was turned down because he was missing a pair of 
molars. He got false teeth and volunteered again after Pearl Harbor this 
time he was permitted in and spent the next four years in the Army. While 
in the Army, Arnovich played for and managed the Fort Lewis baseball team, 
before becoming a postal clerk in New Guinea.[1] Out of condition and now 
35 years old, Morrie played in one game for the New York Giants in 1946 
and was sent down to the Jersey City Giants, where he went 5 for 25 in 
10 games before being released in June 1946. In 1947 Arnovich hit in the 
.370s in the Three-I League and Western Association, then batted .353 in 
limited time in the 1948 Southeastern League before retiring at the age 
of 37. Through 2010, he was ninth all-time in career batting average (ahead 
of Shawn Green) among Jewish major league baseball players.[7] Arnovich 
coached basketball for a Catholic high school in Superior after retiring, 
then ran a jewelry store and a sporting goods store.[1] It was reported 
in the Superior Evening Telegram in 1949 that Arnovich, who had managed 
in the Cubs minor league organization,[1] had signed on as a referee in 
the new National Basketball Association. It is not known if he actually 
served as an NBA referee in its inaugural season. On July 20, 1959, he 
died of a coronary occlusion at his home shortly after his third wedding 
anniversary. Arnovich is buried in the Hebrew Cemetery in Superior, Wisconsin.[1]
