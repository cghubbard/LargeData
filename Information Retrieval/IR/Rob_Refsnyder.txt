Robert Daniel Refsnyder (born Kim Jung-tae (김정태), March 26, 1991) is a 
Korean American professional baseball second baseman, right fielder, and 
first baseman for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He made his MLB debut in 2015. Refsnyder was born in Seoul, South Korea, 
and adopted by a couple from Southern California when he was five months 
old. He became a three-sport star at Laguna Hills High School, and enrolled 
at the University of Arizona, where he played college baseball for the 
Arizona Wildcats as their right fielder. Winning the 2012 College World 
Series (CWS) with the Arizona Wildcats baseball team, Refsnyder was named 
the CWS Most Outstanding Player. The Yankees selected Refsnyder in the 
fifth round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft. The Yankees converted 
him into a second baseman, and he became one of their top prospects. Refsnyder 
was born Kim Jung-tae in Seoul, South Korea. When he was five months old, 
Rob was adopted by Jane and Clint Refsnyder, a couple of German and Irish 
descent from Laguna Hills, California, through Holt International Children's 
Services.[1][2][3] Rob became a fan of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 
rooting for Vladimir Guerrero.[4] He attended annual basketball games of 
the Los Angeles Lakers on Christmas with his father.[1] Clint, a former 
college basketball player at Muhlenberg College,[5] never let Rob win at 
anything, pushing him to compete at his best. Rob did not beat Clint at 
a pick-up game of basketball until he was 17.[4] Refsnyder attended Laguna 
Hills High School in Laguna Hills, California. He played baseball, basketball, 
and American football at Laguna Hills.[6] He played as a wide receiver 
and outside linebacker for the football team in his junior year, and as 
the quarterback in his senior year.[1][7] In his senior season, he was 
named his division's Offensive Player of the Year for the football team[8] 
and co-most valuable player for the baseball team.[9] Colleges in the Pacific-10 
Conference recruited Refsnyder to play quarterback for their football teams.[6] 
Enrolling at the University of Arizona, Refsnyder played college baseball 
for the Arizona Wildcats baseball team in the Pacific-10 Conference. In 
his freshman year, in the 2010 season, Refsnyder was an All-Pacific-10 
Honorable Mention.[10] After his sophomore season, Refsnyder played collegiate 
summer baseball for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[11] 
As a junior during the 2012 Wildcats season, Refsnyder batted .352, leading 
the Wildcats with six home runs, and recording 63 runs batted in (RBIs) 
and 12 stolen bases.[6] In the first game of the 2012 College World Series 
(CWS), Refsnyder hit a home run.[12] He was named the CWS Most Outstanding 
Player, as Refsnyder batted 10-for-21 (.476) in the 2012 CWS and the Wildcats 
defeated the South Carolina Gamecocks.[13] The New York Yankees drafted 
Refsnyder in the fifth round, with the 187th overall selection, in the 
2012 Major League Baseball Draft. Though a right fielder for Arizona, the 
Yankees profiled Refsnyder as a second baseman.[12] Refsnyder signed with 
the Yankees on July 6, receiving a $205,900 signing bonus.[14] He reported 
to the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League, where 
he made his professional debut on July 10.[15] He batted .241 for Charleston.[16] 
The Yankees assigned Refsnyder to Charleston to start the 2013 season.[16][17] 
After posting a .370 batting average and a .452 on-base percentage (OBP) 
in 13 games, Refsnyder was promoted to the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced 
Florida State League on April 19.[18] He batted .283 in 117 games for Tampa, 
hitting six home runs and recording 51 RBIs.[19][20] Between the two levels, 
he had a .408 OBP and a .404 slugging percentage.[20] Refsnyder began the 
2014 season with the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League.[21] 
With the help of Marcus Thames, the Thunder's hitting coach, Refsnyder 
made changes to his swing that reduced unnecessary movement, resulting 
in an increase in his power output.[4][22] He won the Eastern League Player 
of the Week Award for the week of May 26 – June 1.[23] After batting .342 
with six home runs in 60 games for Trenton,[24] including a .430 average 
in his last 28 games, while also improving his defense at second base, 
the Yankees promoted Refsnyder to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders 
of the Class AAA International League on June 10.[25] After batting .371 
with three home runs in his first 19 games with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, 
Yankees' General Manager Brian Cashman described Refsnyder's progress as 
"pretty impressive", and added that "he's forcing us to pay attention."[26][27] 
Cashman had Refsnyder play in the outfield to prepare for a possible promotion 
to the major leagues.[22] The Yankees had Refsnyder finish the season with 
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and he finished the season with a .300 average, 
eight home runs, and 33 RBIs in 77 games for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.[28] 
The Yankees' gave Refsnyder an opportunity to compete for a spot with the 
major league team in 2015,[4] but assigned him to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
to start the season so that he could continue to work on his defense.[29] 
After he batted .290 with seven home runs, 17 doubles, and 37 RBIs in 81 
games, the Yankees promoted Refsnyder to the major leagues on July 11.[30] 
With his callup, Refsnyder became the fourth position player in MLB history 
to be born in South Korea, following Hee-seop Choi, Shin-Soo Choo, and 
Jung-ho Kang.[31] He made his major league debut on July 11, and recorded 
his first two hits, including a two-run home run, on July 12.[32] After 
playing four games, where he batted 2-for-13 (.167), the Yankees optioned 
Refsnyder to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to activate Carlos Beltrán from the 
disabled list.[33] He batted .225 in the second half of the RailRiders' 
season.[34] The Yankees promoted Refsnyder to New York on September 1 as 
part of their September call-ups.[35] Refsnyder played infrequently, with 
the Yankees initially using José Pirela, until late September,[34] when 
he began to receive more regular playing time. He ended the regular season 
with a .302 average, and started for the Yankees in the 2015 American League 
Wild Card Game, which they lost.[36] The Yankees began to play Refsnyder 
as a third baseman during spring training in 2016.[37] The team optioned 
him to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on March 27.[38] He split his playing time 
at third base, second base, and right field before the Yankees promoted 
him to the major leagues on May 17.[39] Following injuries to first baseman 
Mark Teixeira and Dustin Ackley, the Yankees began to play Refsnyder at 
first base.[40] Three years before the Refsnyders adopted Rob, they adopted 
a girl, Elizabeth, also from South Korea.[5] She played college softball 
at Kenyon College.[2] Refsnyder hopes to visit South Korea with his sister 
in order to learn about the culture of Korea and the Korean language. He 
is also supportive of adoption, and hopes to adopt in the future.[3] Refsnyder 
helped to design a t-shirt to raise money for A Kid’s Place, an organization 
in the Tampa Bay Area that helps foster children.[41] Refsnyder met his 
wife, Monica (née Drake) while they were both students at the University 
of Arizona in 2012.[32] She is an All-American swimmer and competed in 
the 2008 and 2012 United States Olympic Trials, attempting to qualify for 
the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.[5][42] They were married in December
