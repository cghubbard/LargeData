David Gene Parker (born June 9, 1951), nicknamed "The Cobra",[1] is an 
American former player in Major League Baseball. He was the 1978 National 
League MVP and a two-time batting champion. Parker was the first professional 
athlete to earn an average of one million dollars per year, having signed 
a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker's career achievements 
include 2712 hits, 339 home runs, 1493 runs batted in and a lifetime batting 
average of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder 
during the first half of his career, with a powerful arm, winning three 
consecutive Gold Gloves during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 
72 runners, including 26 in 1977. He was a baseball All-Star in 1977, 1979, 
1980, 1981, 1985, 1986, and 1990. In the 1979 All-Star Game, Parker showcased 
his defensive ability and powerful arm by throwing out Jim Rice at third 
base and Angels catcher Brian Downing at home. Parker also contributed 
an RBI on a sacrifice fly and was named the game's MVP. Parker grew up 
in Cincinnati near Crosley Field, where he learned to play baseball on 
the stadium's parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk 
in a foundry.[2] Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School. He has 
said his favorite sport was football, and he starred at tailback but injured 
a knee in a game during his senior year and gave up the game. Also a baseball 
star, one of his fondest memories is playing at Western Hills High School 
(alma mater of Pete Rose), where he hit a home run that landed on the roof 
of a Frisch's restaurant.[3] In the early 1970s, as a member of the Pirates 
AAA minor league ball team Charleston (WV) Charlies, Parker hit a home 
run that landed on a coal car on a passing train and the ball was later 
picked up in Columbus, Ohio.[4] He began his major league career on July 
12, 1973 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, for whom he played from 1973 to 1983. 
At the 1977 MLB All-Star Game he became the only player in history to have 
worn batting helmets from two different teams—neither of them his own—in 
the same game, wearing a San Diego Padres helmet early on before swapping 
it out for a Cincinnati Reds one.[5] In 1977, he was National League batting 
champion, a feat he repeated in 1978 when he was named the National League's 
MVP. This was in spite of a collision at home plate with John Stearns during 
a game against the Mets on June 30, 1978, in which Parker fractured his 
jaw and cheekbone; he wore a specially constructed facemask in order to 
minimize his time away from the lineup.[6] The Pirates rewarded him with 
baseball's first million-dollar-per-year contract.[7][8] The following 
year, he was an instrumental part of the Pirates' World Series championship 
team.[9] During a game in 1979, a powerful hit he made to right field was 
very difficult to throw into the infield, because he had "knocked the cover 
off the ball." One of the seams on the ball ruptured, making nearly half 
of the cover come loose.[10] Pittsburgh fans angered by his million-dollar 
contract threw "nuts and bolts and bullets and batteries" at him, as pitcher 
Kent Tekulve stated; a typo in a news story made it appear that they threw 
car batteries.[11] In 1981, at a point in his career when it looked as 
if he would one day rank among the game's all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter 
and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players 
of All Time.[12] The authors, noting that Parker had succeeded Roberto 
Clemente at the position, wrote, "Someone must have a fondness for right 
field in Pittsburgh." Parker took after his Pirates teammate Willie Stargell 
in warming up in the on-deck circle with a sledgehammer (when most batters 
would use a simple lead-weighted bat).[13] However, in the early 1980s, 
Parker's hitting suffered due to injuries, weight problems, and his increasing 
cocaine use.[14] He became one of the central figures in a drug scandal 
that spread through the major leagues. At the end of the 1983 season, Parker 
became a free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. In Cincinnati, 
his hometown, he returned to the form that made him an All-Star in Pittsburgh.[11] 
In 1985, he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a .312 
batting average, 34 home runs, and 125 RBI. Parker finished second in 1985 
MVP voting to Willie McGee. Following the season, Parker was among several 
players who testified against a dealer in the Pittsburgh drug trials. Named 
as "regular users", Parker and six other players were suspended for the 
following season; however, the sentences were commuted in exchange for 
donating ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, 
submitting to random drug testing, and contributing 100 hours of drug-related 
community service.[15][16] After the 1987 season, Cincinnati traded Parker 
to the Oakland Athletics for José Rijo and Tim Birtsas. In Oakland, Parker 
was able to extend his career by spending most of his time as a designated 
hitter. Although injuries and age caught up to him to a degree – he hit 
just .257 with 12 homers in 377 at-bats in 1988 and .264 with 22 homers 
in 553 at-bats in 1989 – his veteran leadership was a significant factor 
in the A's consecutive World Series appearances. Parker signed with the 
Milwaukee Brewers for the 1990 season and had a solid year as the Brewers' 
DH with a .289 average and 21 home runs in 610 at-bats. However, Milwaukee 
opted for youth at the end of the year and traded the aging Parker for 
Dante Bichette. Parker's last season was 1991. He played for the California 
Angels until late in the season when he was released. The Toronto Blue 
Jays then signed him as insurance for the pennant race, and Parker hit 
.333 in limited action. However, since he was acquired too late in the 
season, he did not qualify for inclusion on the post-season roster and 
thus was unable to play in the American League Championship Series against 
the Minnesota Twins, which the Blue Jays lost in five games. Parker retired 
at the end of the season. Parker has served as a first-base coach for the 
Anaheim Angels, a batting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998, and 
a special hitting instructor for Pittsburgh. He owned several Popeye's 
Chicken franchises in Cincinnati[17] until selling his interest in them 
in 2012 after 25 years.[18] Parker never got more than 24% of votes on 
Hall of Fame ballots, and his 15-year Baseball Writers' Association of 
America eligibility was exhausted on the 2011 ballot. He can be now considered 
for the Veterans Committee Expansion from 2014. Along with Keith Hernandez, 
Parker's involvement with the Pittsburgh drug trials has been the most 
likely cause of him not being voted into the Hall of Fame, serving as a 
precursor to those listed on the Mitchell Report not being voted into the 
Hall of Fame due to steroid abuse.[19][20] Parker has had both of his knees 
replaced due to injuries from his playing career.[21] In 2013, he confirmed 
to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's 
disease.[22] Parker has six children. He currently resides in Loveland, 
Ohio, near Cincinnati, with his wife, Kellye.[3][18] Parker was elected 
to the Reds Hall of Fame Class of 2014, which also included fellow Cincinnati 
natives Ron Oester and Ken Griffey Jr.[23] In 2012, he was inducted into
