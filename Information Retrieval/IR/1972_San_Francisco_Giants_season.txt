The 1972 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 90th year in Major 
League Baseball, their 15th year in San Francisco, and their 13th at Candlestick 
Park. The Giants finished in fifth place in National League West with a 
record of 69-86. It was their first losing season in San Francisco and 
the franchise's first losing season since 1957, which was the franchise's 
final year in New York. Franchise legend Willie Mays was traded to the 
New York Mets for Charlie Williams and US$50,000.[4] At the time, the Giants 
franchise was losing money. Owner Horace Stoneham could not guarantee Mays 
an income after retirement. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G
