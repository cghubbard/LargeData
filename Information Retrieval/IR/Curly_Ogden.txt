Warren Harvey "Curly" Ogden (January 24, 1901 in Ogden, Pennsylvania – 
August 6, 1964 in Upland, Pennsylvania), was a professional baseball pitcher 
in the Major Leagues from 1922 to 1926. Ogden was the starting pitcher 
for the Washington Senators in the final game of the 1924 World Series, 
which they won in 12 innings. The right-hander was something of a decoy 
in that Game 7, given his first start of the Series as a ploy by Senators 
manager Bucky Harris to get the opposition to load its lineup with left-handed 
hitters. Harris then removed Ogden after two batters and replaced him with 
a lefty. Ogden spent three seasons with the Senators from 1924–26, making 
29 starts. He attended Swarthmore College, where he earned his diploma 
in 1922. His older brother, Jack Ogden, who also attended Swarthmore, pitched 
in the Major Leagues for the St. Louis Browns and Cincinnati Reds. Curly
