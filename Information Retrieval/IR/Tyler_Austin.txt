Christopher Tyler Austin (born September 6, 1991) is an American professional 
baseball first baseman and outfielder for the New York Yankees of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He played baseball for Heritage High School in Conyers, 
Georgia, before the Yankees selected him in the 2010 Major League Baseball 
draft. Austin is the oldest of three sons born to Kim and Chris Austin. 
He also has two younger brothers, Dylan and Kyle.[1] Though he grew up 
in Conyers, Georgia, 25 miles (40 km) from Atlanta, Austin grew up as a 
fan of the New York Yankees[2] and considered Derek Jeter to be his favorite 
player.[3] Austin attended Heritage High School in Conyers. He played for 
the school's baseball team as a catcher, third baseman, and pitcher. He 
was invited to play in amateur showcase tournaments, such as the AFLAC 
All-American Game.[4] In 2008, his sophomore season, Austin had a .626 
batting average with 19 home runs, and The Rockdale Citizen named him their 
high school baseball hitter of the year.[5] At the age of 17, Austin was 
diagnosed with testicular cancer. He had surgery to remove the tumor, but 
did not require chemotherapy as the cancer was caught early and did not 
spread to other parts of his body.[3] Austin committed to attend Kennesaw 
State University on a college baseball scholarship to play for the Kennesaw 
State Owls.[4] Noticed by Yankees' area scout Darryl Monroe,[3] the Yankees 
selected Austin in the 13th round, with the 415th overall selection, of 
the 2010 Major League Baseball draft[6][7] as a catcher.[2] Monroe said 
that Austin's struggle with cancer "added to my interest, learning what 
kind of courage and strength he had through that process, how he was undeterred 
by it", as well as his "passion for the game".[3] Austin signed with the 
Yankees rather than enroll at Kennesaw State, receiving a $130,000 signing 
bonus.[3] He made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Yankees of 
the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, playing in two games.[8] In 2011, Austin 
began the season with the Gulf Coast Yankees, before receiving a promotion 
to the Staten Island Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn 
League. He had a .354 batting average across the 2011 season.[9] Though 
he was drafted as a catcher, Austin spent most of his playing time as a 
first baseman and third baseman.[2] Austin began the 2012 season with the 
Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League. He was named 
to appear in the South Atlantic League All-Star Game.[10][11] After hitting 
14 home runs with Charleston, the Yankees promoted Austin to the Tampa 
Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in July.[12] He was 
chosen to represent the Yankees in the All-Star Futures Game,[8][13] but 
suffered an ankle injury in July 2012, which caused him to withdrew from 
the game. After the end of Tampa's regular season, the Yankees promoted 
Austin again, this time to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern 
League, so that he could play for the Thunder during the Eastern League 
postseason.[14] He finished the 2012 season, hitting .322 with a .400 on 
base percentage, .559 slugging percentage, 17 home runs, and 80 runs batted 
in (RBIs).[15] Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, referred to 
Austin as a "mega prospect" in August 2012.[14][16] Austin won the Yankees' 
Minor League Player of the Year Award for the 2012 season.[16] Prior to 
the 2013 season, Austin was ranked as the 77th best prospect in baseball 
by Baseball America.[17] The Yankees invited Austin to spring training 
in 2013 as a non-roster player.[18] He played for Trenton, primarily as 
an outfielder. He was selected to appear in the Eastern League All-Star 
Game.[19] Austin went on the disabled list with a wrist injury in July,[20] 
which caused him to miss almost 60 games. He batted .257 with a .344 on-base 
percentage and a .373 slugging percentage with six home runs and 40 RBIs 
in 83 games for Trenton in 2013.[21] The Yankees assigned him to the Scottsdale 
Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League (AFL) after the regular season.[22] 
Austin lost about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) by focusing on nutrition and gained 
strength during the 2013–14 offseason.[21] After battling a flare up of 
his wrist injury from the previous season,[20] he returned to Trenton for 
the 2014 season.[21] He batted .275 with nine home runs and 47 RBIs in 
105 games during the 2014 season.[23] After the regular season, the Yankees 
again assigned Austin to Scottsdale in the AFL,[24] but his playing time 
was limited by a knee injury.[25] On November 20, 2014, the Yankees added 
Austin to their 40-man roster to protect him from being selected in the 
Rule 5 draft.[23] Austin played for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders 
of the Class AAA International League at the start of the 2015 season. 
He struggled with the RailRiders, hitting .230 before missing time with 
an injury in late June.[26] The Yankees demoted Austin to the Trenton Thunder 
after he batted .235 in 73 games for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.[27] He batted 
.260 with two home runs and eight RBIs for Trenton.[28] The Yankees designated 
him for assignment at the end of the minor league season in September, 
removing him from their 40-man roster.[29] He went unclaimed on waivers, 
and the Yankees sent him outright to Trenton. The Yankees assigned him 
to the AFL for the third time after the 2015 season, as a replacement for 
the injured Eric Jagielo.[28] Austin began the 2016 season with Trenton, 
where he batted .260 in 50 games.[30] The Yankees promoted Austin to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
during the season.[31] Austin batted .323 with 13 home runs and 49 RBIs 
in 57 games for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and was promoted to the major league 
roster on August 13.[32] He made his Major League debut on August 13, 2016. 
In his first at bat, he hit his first major league home run off Matt Andriese. 
With the next at bat, Aaron Judge, also making his debut, hit a home run. 
This marked the first time that two teammates had hit home runs in their 
first at bats in the same game.[33] In 31 games with the Yankees, Austin
