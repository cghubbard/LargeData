30 for 30 is the umbrella title for a series of documentary films airing 
on ESPN, its sister networks, and online highlighting important people 
and events in sports history. This includes three "volumes" of 30 episodes 
each, a 13-episode series under the ESPN Films Presents title in 2011–2012, 
and a series of 30 for 30 Shorts shown through the ESPN.com website. The 
series has also expanded to include Soccer Stories, which aired in advance 
of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The idea for the series began in 2007 from 
ESPN.com columnist and Grantland.com founder Bill Simmons and ESPN's Connor 
Schell.[1] The title, 30 for 30, derived from the series' genesis as 30 
films in celebration of ESPN's 30th 'birthday', with an exploration of 
the biggest stories from ESPN's first 30 years on-air, through a series 
of 30 one-hour films by 30 filmmakers.[2][3] Volume I premiered in October 
2009 and ran through December 2010, chronicling 30 stories from the "ESPN 
era", beginning with the network's founding in 1979. Each film in Volume 
I details a striking sports issue or event that occurred during those three 
decades, including what Simmons describes as "stories that resonated at 
the time [they occurred] but were eventually forgotten for whatever reason."[1] 
Subsequent films, including Volume II and online-only shorts, expanded 
the series beyond the "ESPN era". In September 2014, Schell said, "Even 
though we have been at this for five years now, there is no shortage of 
incredible moments from the world of sports, so that enables us to continue 
making 30 for 30 films we’re proud of."[4] In 2010, John Dahl, Connor Schell 
and Simmons served 30 for 30's executive producers.[5][6][7] Unless otherwise 
noted, the following films are all 60 minutes in length (including commercials). 
Other films were previously announced for Volume I of the series but were 
not included. These films, which began airing in 2011, are a continuation 
of 30 for 30, dealing with more sports stories that 30 for 30 did not cover. 
According to 30 for 30 producer Bill Simmons, "We're spinning off the 30 
for 30 series next year into something that will probably be called 30 
for 30 Presents or something like that... we're going to be putting out 
4–5 sports docs per year on the level of the best 30 for 30 docs and getting 
the best filmmakers to do them. Same creative team is involved. We have 
some terrific ideas in the hopper. So even though the SMU doc will be the 
30th one (right after the Heisman ceremony) don't think the spirit of the 
series is going away."[18] These additional films include: On May 15, 2012, 
it was announced that the 30 for 30 series would return in October 2012, 
with 30 all new documentaries.[30] The documentaries were integrated with 
Grantland.com by podcasts, feature stories and oral histories.[31] Unless 
otherwise noted, the following films are all 90 minutes in length (including 
commercials). In September 2015, it was announced that 30 for 30 would 
return for a third volume of 30 films, beginning in October 2015.[8] How 
Sacramento mayor and former NBA all-star Kevin Johnson played "point guard" 
in an effort to keep the Kings from moving to Seattle. O.J.: Made in America, 
which was directed by Ezra Edelman, was billed as a "mini-series event" 
in the 30 for 30 series.[68] The five-part documentary series examines 
the life of O. J. Simpson, as well as the broader issues of race and celebrity 
in the United States as it pertained to Simpson's 1995 criminal trial for 
the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her acquaintance, 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. Made in America also focuses on other aspects in Simpson's 
life, including his success on the football field, his celebrity away from 
the gridiron, and his later conviction and imprisonment in a robbery case. 
Part 1 aired on June 11, 2016, with Parts 2–5 airing on June 14, 15, 16, 
17 and 18, respectively.[69]f 30 for 30 Shorts are short films that have 
been featured on the 30 for 30 website as well as the now-defunct Grantland.com 
website; they have also been featured on ESPN or its related networks, 
either on 30 for 30 compilation shows or on SportsCenter.[70][71] On January 
11, 2014, it was announced that a soccer-only 30 for 30 series, featuring 
two-feature-length films and six 30-minute films, would be aired in April 
2014, featuring "compelling narratives from around the international soccer 
landscape". Additionally, a 10-part vignette series, titled Coraçao, about 
Brazil's rich history, will air during ESPN's 2014 FIFA World Cup coverage.[75] 
On September 7, 2016, it was announced that ESPN Films and ESPN Audio would 
produce 30 for 30 Podcasts, set to launch in early 2017. The series will 
report on new sports stories using a narrative podcasting approach.[81] 
The series had a slow beginning. The first film, Peter Berg's Kings Ransom, 
a chronicle of Wayne Gretzky's trade from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los 
Angeles Kings, premiered on October 6, 2009 to poor ratings.[9][82] Kings 
Ransom drew a 0.5 national rating and a total viewership of 645,000.[9][82] 
The premiere of Kings Ransom aired at the same time as the 2009 American 
League Central tie-breaker game between the Minnesota Twins and Detroit 
Tigers on TBS, which went into extra innings and drew a 4.5 rating.[citation 
needed] As awareness and critical acclaim grew, the viewing audience also 
grew. By the seventh episode, The U, the audience had grown to a 1.8 rating 
and well over 2 million viewers.[11] The A.V. Club review for the eighth 
entry, Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks, called it "the 
most hotly anticipated [of the first eight]" and stated that "it more than 
lived up to the hype."[83] The A.V. Club has given positive and negative 
reviews for different episodes in the series, with notable critical reviews 
of the three Volume I episodes that had involvement by the media production 
arms of Major League Baseball (Four Days in October), the NBA (Once Brothers) 
and NASCAR (Tim Richmond: To the Limit).[84][85][86] Cadillac and Levi's 
are the presenting sponsors of the series. The Cadillac name appears on 
the 30 for 30 logo, while the Levi's "go forth" slogan appears on the bottom 
corner of the screen during the directors interstitial comments, which 
appear for 45 seconds at the beginning of each film and 30 seconds at the 
end. Commercials for both companies were shown during every intermission 
during the original air dates, with Levi's guaranteed a 60-second commercial 
slot at the beginning of the third act. Cadillac replaced Honda as a primary 
sponsor; during its time as a contributor, Honda aired parts of its "Dream
