Coordinates: 22°00′N 80°00′W﻿ / ﻿22.000°N 80.000°W﻿ / 22.000; -80.000 Cuba, 
officially the Republic of Cuba (Spanish:  República de Cuba (help·info)), 
is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud 
and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean 
where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. 
It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of 
Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other 
major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest 
island in the Caribbean, with an area of 109,884 square kilometres (42,426 sq mi), 
and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants.[14] 
Prior to Spanish colonization in the late 15th century, Cuba was inhabited 
by Amerindian tribes. It remained a colony of Spain until the Spanish–American 
War of 1898, which led to nominal independence as a de facto United States 
protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, Cuba attempted to strengthen 
its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social 
strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952.[15] 
Further unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 
by the July 26 Movement, which afterwards established a government under 
the leadership of Fidel Castro. Since 1965, the state has been governed 
by the Communist Party of Cuba. A point of contention during the Cold War 
between the Soviet Union and the United States, a nuclear war nearly broke 
out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Culturally, Cuba is considered 
part of Latin America.[16] It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture 
and customs derive from diverse origins, including the aboriginal Taíno 
and Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction 
of African slaves, and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the 
Cold War. Cuba is a Marxist–Leninist one-party republic, where the role 
of the vanguard Communist Party is enshrined in the Constitution. Independent 
observers have accused the Cuban government of numerous human rights abuses, 
including arbitrary imprisonment and torture.[17] Cuba is a developing 
country with one of the world's last planned economies that is dominated 
by the exports of sugar, tobacco, coffee and skilled labor. It ranks highly 
in some metrics of national performance, including health care and education.[18][19] 
The name Cuba comes from the Taíno language. The exact meaning of the name 
is unclear but it may be translated either as 'where fertile land is abundant' 
(cubao),[20] or 'great place' (coabana).[21] Authors who believe that Christopher 
Columbus was Portuguese state that Cuba was named by Columbus for the town 
of Cuba in the district of Beja in Portugal.[22][23] Before the arrival 
of the Spanish, Cuba was inhabited by three distinct tribes of American 
Indian people. The Taíno (an Arawak people), the Guanajatabey, and the 
Ciboney people. The ancestors of the Ciboney migrated from the mainland 
of South America, with the earliest sites dated to 5,000 BP.[24] The Taíno 
arrived from Hispanola sometime in the 3rd century A.D. When Columbus arrived 
they were the dominant culture in Cuba, having an estimated population 
of 150,000.[24] The name "Cuba" comes from the native Taíno language. It 
is derived from either coabana meaning "great place," or from cubao meaning 
"where fertile land is abundant".[25][26] The Taíno were farmers, while 
the Ciboney were farmers as well as fishers and hunter-gatherers. After 
first landing on an island then called Guanahani, Bahamas on October 12, 
1492,[27] Christopher Columbus commanded his three ships: La Pinta, La 
Niña and the Santa María, to land on Cuba's northeastern coast on October 
28, 1492.[28] (This was near what is now Bariay, Holguin province.) Columbus 
claimed the island for the new Kingdom of Spain[29] and named it Isla Juana 
after Juan, Prince of Asturias.[30] In 1511, the first Spanish settlement 
was founded by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar at Baracoa. Other towns soon 
followed, including San Cristobal de la Habana, founded in 1515, which 
later became the capital. The native Taíno were forced to work under the 
encomienda system,[31] which resembled a feudal system in Medieval Europe.[32] 
Within a century the indigenous people were virtually wiped out due to 
multiple factors, primarily Eurasian infectious diseases, to which they 
had no natural resistance (immunity), aggravated by harsh conditions of 
the repressive colonial subjugation.[33] In 1529, a measles outbreak in 
Cuba killed two-thirds of those few natives who had previously survived 
smallpox.[34][35] On May 18, 1539, Conquistador Hernando De Soto departed 
from Havana, Cuba at the head of some 600 followers into a vast expedition 
through the Southeastern United States, starting at La Florida, in search 
of gold, treasure, fame and power.[36] On September 1, 1548, Dr. Gonzalo 
Perez de Angulo was appointed governor of Cuba. He arrived in Santiago, 
Cuba on November 4, 1549 and immediately declared the liberty of all natives.[37] 
He became Cuba's first permanent governor to reside in Havana instead of 
Santiago, and he built Havana's first church made of masonry.[38] After 
the French took Havana in 1555, the governor's son, Francisco de Angulo, 
went to Mexico.[39] Cuba developed slowly and, unlike the plantation islands 
of the Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. But what was most important 
was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported 
the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 
50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in Barbados; 300,000 in Virginia, both 
British colonies; and 450,000 in French Saint-Domingue, which had large-scale 
sugar cane plantations.[40] The Seven Years' War, which erupted in 1754 
across three continents, eventually arrived in the Spanish Caribbean. Spain's 
alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, 
and in 1762 a British expedition of five warships and 4,000 troops set 
out from Portsmouth to capture Cuba. The British arrived on June 6, and 
by August had Havana under siege.[41] When Havana surrendered, the admiral 
of the British fleet, George Keppel, the 3rd Earl of Albemarle, entered 
the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western 
part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their 
North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of 
Cuban society. They imported food, horses and other goods into the city, 
as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the under developed 
sugar plantations.[41] Though Havana, which had become the third-largest 
city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and 
increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation 
of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants, fearing 
a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial 
territories. Less than a year after Britain seized Havana, it signed the 
Peace of Paris together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' 
War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for Cuba. The French had 
recommended this to Spain, advising that declining to give up Florida could 
result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland 
to the British.[41] Many in Britain were disappointed, believing that Florida 
was a poor return for Cuba and Britain's other gains in the war. The real 
engine for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early 
nineteenth century was the Haitian Revolution. When the enslaved peoples 
of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through 
violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances 
with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of 
the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba, too, and numerous prohibitions 
during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been 
slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, 
however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by 
transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing "pearl of 
the Antilles" that Haiti had been before the revolution.[42] As the historian 
Ada Ferrer has written, "At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue 
helped entrench its denial in Cuba. As slavery and colonialism collapsed 
in the French colony, the Spanish island underwent transformations that 
were almost the mirror image of Haiti's."[43] Estimates suggest that between 
1790 and 1820 some 325,000 Africans were imported to Cuba as slaves, which 
was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790.[44] Although 
a smaller proportion of the population of Cuba was enslaved, at times slaves 
arose in revolt. In 1812 the Aponte Slave Rebellion took place but it was 
suppressed.[45] The population of Cuba in 1817 was 630,980, of which 291,021 
were white, 115,691 free people of color (mixed-race), and 224,268 black 
slaves.[46] This was a much higher proportion of free blacks to slaves 
than in Virginia, for instance, or the other Caribbean islands. Historians 
such as Swedish Magnus Mõrner, who studied slavery in Latin America, found 
that manumissions increased when slave economies were in decline, as in 
18th-century Cuba and early 19th-century Maryland of the United States.[40][47] 
In part due to Cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by 
the 19th century, there had developed the practice of coartacion, or "buying 
oneself out of slavery," a "uniquely Cuban development," according to historian 
Herbert S. Klein.[48] Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated 
urban industries "to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came 
to Cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace 
Negro workers."[40] A system of diversified agriculture, with small farms 
and fewer slaves, served to supply the cities with produce and other goods.[40] 
In the 1820s, when the rest of Spain's empire in Latin America rebelled 
and formed independent states, Cuba remained loyal. Its economy was based 
on serving the empire. By 1860, Cuba had 213,167 free people of color, 
39% of its non-White population of 550,000.[40] By contrast, Virginia with 
about the same number of blacks, had only 58,042 or 11% who were free; 
the rest were enslaved.[40] In the antebellum years, Virginia discouraged 
manumissions after the Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion of 1831 and strengthened 
restrictions against free blacks, as did other southern states. In addition, 
there was a high demand for slaves, and Virginia planters sold many in 
the internal domestic slave trade, to be shipped or taken overland to the 
Deep South, which had greatly expanded its cotton production. Full independence 
from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter Carlos Manuel 
de Céspedes. De Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with 
him for an independent Cuba. On December 27, 1868, he issued a decree condemning 
slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves 
whose masters present them for military service.[49] The 1868 rebellion 
resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the Ten Years' War. Two thousand 
Cuban Chinese joined the rebels. Chinese had been imported as indentured 
laborers. A monument in Havana honours the Cuban Chinese who fell in the 
war.[50] The United States declined to recognize the new Cuban government, 
although many European and Latin American nations did so.[51] In 1878, 
the Pact of Zanjón ended the conflict, with Spain promising greater autonomy 
to Cuba. In 1879–1880, Cuban patriot Calixto García attempted to start 
another war known as the Little War but did not receive enough support.[52] 
Slavery in Cuba was abolished in 1875 and was completed in 1886.[53][54] 
An exiled dissident named José Martí founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party 
in New York in 1892. The aim of the party was to achieve Cuban independence 
from Spain.[55] In January 1895 Martí traveled to Montecristi and Santo 
Domingo to join the efforts of Máximo Gómez.[55] Martí recorded his political 
views in the Manifesto of Montecristi.[56] Fighting against the Spanish 
army began in Cuba on February 24, 1895, but Martí was unable to reach 
Cuba until April 11, 1895.[55] Martí was killed in the battle of Dos Rios 
on May 19, 1895.[55] His death immortalized him as Cuba's national hero.[56] 
Around 200,000 Spanish troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army, 
which relied mostly on guerrilla and sabotage tactics. The Spaniards began 
a campaign of suppression. General Valeriano Weyler, military governor 
of Cuba, herded the rural population into what he called reconcentrados, 
described by international observers as "fortified towns". These are often 
considered the prototype for 20th-century concentration camps.[57] Between 
200,000 and 400,000 Cuban civilians died from starvation and disease in 
the camps, numbers verified by the Red Cross and United States Senator 
Redfield Proctor, a former Secretary of War. American and European protests 
against Spanish conduct on the island followed.[58] The U.S. battleship 
Maine was sent to protect U.S. interests, but soon after arrival, she exploded 
in Havana harbor and sank quickly, killing nearly three quarters of her 
crew. The cause and responsibility for her sinking remained unclear after 
a board of inquiry. Popular opinion in the U.S., fueled by an active press, 
concluded that the Spanish were to blame and demanded action.[59] Spain 
and the United States declared war on each other in late April 1898. Over 
the decades, five U.S. presidents—Polk, Pierce, Buchanan, Grant, and McKinley—had 
tried to buy the island of Cuba from Spain.[60][61] After the Spanish–American 
War, Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Paris (1898), by 
which Spain ceded Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam to the United 
States for the sum of US$20 million.[62] Cuba gained formal independence 
from the U.S. on May 20, 1902, as the Republic of Cuba.[63] Under Cuba's 
new constitution, the U.S. retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs 
and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. Under the Platt Amendment, 
the U.S. leased the Guantánamo Bay naval base from Cuba. Following disputed 
elections in 1906, the first president, Tomás Estrada Palma, faced an armed 
revolt by independence war veterans who defeated the meager government 
forces.[64] The U.S. intervened by occupying Cuba and named Charles Edward 
Magoon as Governor for three years. Cuban historians have characterized 
Magoon's governorship as having introduced political and social corruption.[65] 
In 1908, self-government was restored when José Miguel Gómez was elected 
President, but the U.S. continued intervening in Cuban affairs. In 1912, 
the Partido Independiente de Color attempted to establish a separate black 
republic in Oriente Province,[66] but was suppressed by General Monteagudo 
with considerable bloodshed. In 1924, Gerardo Machado was elected president.[67] 
During his administration, tourism increased markedly, and American-owned 
hotels and restaurants were built to accommodate the influx of tourists.[67] 
The tourist boom led to increases in gambling and prostitution.[67] The 
Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a collapse in the price of sugar, political 
unrest, and repression.[68] Protesting students, known as the Generation 
of 1930, turned to violence in opposition to the increasingly unpopular 
Machado.[68] A general strike (in which the Communist Party sided with 
Machado),[69] uprisings among sugar workers, and an army revolt forced 
Machado into exile in August 1933. He was replaced by Carlos Manuel de 
Céspedes y Quesada.[68] In September 1933, the Sergeants' Revolt, led by 
Sergeant Fulgencio Batista, overthrew Cespedes.[70] A five-member executive 
committee (the Pentarchy of 1933) was chosen to head a provisional government.[71] 
Ramon Grau San Martin was then appointed as provisional president.[71] 
Grau resigned in 1934, leaving the way clear for Batista, who dominated 
Cuban politics for the next 25 years, at first through a series of puppet-presidents.[70] 
The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of "virtually unremitting social 
and political warfare".[72] A new constitution was adopted in 1940, which 
engineered radical progressive ideas, including the right to labour and 
health care.[73] Batista was elected president in the same year, holding 
the post until 1944.[74] He is so far the only non-white Cuban to win the 
nation's highest political office.[75][76][77] His government carried out 
major social reforms. Several members of the Communist Party held office 
under his administration.[78] Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved 
in combat during World War II, although president Batista suggested a joint 
U.S.-Latin American assault on Francoist Spain in order to overthrow its 
authoritarian regime.[79] Batista adhered to the 1940 constitution's strictures 
preventing his re-election.[80] Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of 
the next election, in 1944.[74] Grau further corroded the base of the already 
teetering legitimacy of the Cuban political system, in particular by undermining 
the deeply flawed, though not entirely ineffectual, Congress and Supreme 
Court.[81] Carlos Prío Socarrás, a protégé of Grau, became president in 
1948.[74] The two terms of the Auténtico Party saw an influx of investment 
which fueled a boom and raised living standards for all segments of society 
and created a prosperous middle class in most urban areas.[82] After running 
unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1952, Batista staged a coup.[83] He 
outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952.[84] After the coup, Cuba had 
Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, 
cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one third of 
the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this 
consumption.[85] In 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by 
Latin American standards, and in some cases by world standards.[86] On 
the other hand, Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges 
in Latin America, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They 
were obtained in large measure "at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants", 
leading to disparities.[87] Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic 
regulations enormously, causing economic problems.[75][88] Unemployment 
became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs.[75] 
The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became 
increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. 
The labor unions supported Batista until the very end.[75][76] Batista 
stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958.[83] In 
the 1950s, various organizations, including some advocating armed uprising, 
competed for public support in bringing about political change.[89] In 
1956, Fidel Castro and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht Granma 
in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government.[89] 
It was not until 1958 that Castro's July 26th Movement emerged as the leading 
revolutionary group.[89] By late 1958 the rebels had broken out of the 
Sierra Maestra and launched a general popular insurrection. After Castro's 
fighters captured Santa Clara, Batista fled with his family to the Dominican 
Republic on January 1, 1959. Later he went into exile on the Portuguese 
island of Madeira and finally settled in Estoril, near Lisbon. Fidel Castro's 
forces entered the capital on January 8, 1959. The liberal Manuel Urrutia 
Lleó became the provisional president.[90] From 1959 to 1966 Cuban insurgents 
fought a six-year rebellion in the Escambray Mountains against the Castro 
government. The government's vastly superior numbers eventually crushed 
the insurgency. The rebellion lasted longer and involved more soldiers 
than the Cuban Revolution.[91][92] The U.S. State Department has estimated 
that 3,200 people were executed from 1959 to 1962.[93] According to Amnesty 
International, death sentences from 1959–87 numbered 237 of which all but 
21 were actually carried out.[94] Other estimates for the total number 
of political executions range from 4,000 to 33,000.[95][96][97] The vast 
majority of those executed following the 1959 revolution were policemen, 
politicians, and informers of the Batista regime accused of crimes such 
as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions had widespread 
popular support among the Cuban population.[98] The United States government 
initially reacted favorably to the Cuban revolution, seeing it as part 
of a movement to bring democracy to Latin America.[100] Castro's legalization 
of the Communist party and the hundreds of executions that followed caused 
a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries.[100] The 
promulgation of the Agrarian Reform Law, expropriating thousands of acres 
of farmland (including from large U.S. landholders), further worsened relations.[100][101] 
In response, between 1960 and 1964 the U.S imposed a range of sanctions, 
eventually including a total ban on trade between the countries and a freeze 
on all Cuban-owned assets in the U.S.[102] In February 1960, Castro signed 
a commercial agreement with Soviet Vice-Premier Anastas Mikoyan.[100] In 
March 1960, Eisenhower gave his approval to a CIA plan to arm and train 
a group of Cuban refugees to overthrow the Castro regime.[103] The invasion 
(known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion) took place on April 14, 1961.[101] 
About 1,400 Cuban exiles disembarked at the Bay of Pigs, but failed in 
their attempt to overthrow Castro.[101] In January 1962, Cuba was suspended 
from the Organization of American States (OAS), and later the same year 
the OAS started to impose sanctions against Cuba of similar nature to the 
US sanctions.[104] The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred in October 1962. By 
1963, Cuba was moving towards a full-fledged Communist system modeled on 
the USSR.[105] During the 1970s, Fidel Castro dispatched tens of thousands 
of troops in support of Soviet-supported wars in Africa. He supported the 
MPLA in Angola and Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia.[106] The standard 
of living in the 1970s was "extremely spartan" and discontent was rife.[107] 
Fidel Castro admitted the failures of economic policies in a 1970 speech.[107] 
In 1975 the OAS lifted its sanctions against Cuba, with the approval of 
16 member states, including the U.S. The U.S., however, maintained its 
own sanctions.[104] Castro's rule was severely tested in the aftermath 
of the Soviet collapse in 1991 (known in Cuba as the Special Period). The 
country faced a severe economic downturn following the withdrawal of Soviet 
subsidies worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually, resulting in effects 
such as food and fuel shortages.[108][109] The government did not accept 
American donations of food, medicines, and cash until 1993.[108] On August 
5, 1994, state security dispersed protesters in a spontaneous protest in 
Havana.[110] Cuba has found a new source of aid and support in the People's 
Republic of China. Hugo Chávez, former President of Venezuela, and Evo 
Morales, President of Bolivia, have become allies and both countries are 
major oil and gas exporters. In 2003, the government arrested and imprisoned 
a large number of civil activists, a period known as the "Black Spring".[111][112] 
In February 2008, Fidel Castro announced his resignation as President of 
Cuba.[113] On February 24 his brother, Raúl Castro, was declared the new 
President.[114] In his inauguration speech, Raúl promised that some of 
the restrictions on freedom in Cuba would be removed.[115] In March 2009, 
Raúl Castro removed some of his brother's appointees.[116] On June 3, 2009, 
the Organization of American States adopted a resolution to end the 47-year 
ban on Cuban membership of the group.[117] The resolution stated, however, 
that full membership would be delayed until Cuba was "in conformity with 
the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS."[104] Fidel Castro 
restated his position that he was not interested in joining after the OAS 
resolution had been announced.[118] Effective January 14, 2013, Cuba ended 
the requirement established in 1961, that any citizens who wish to travel 
abroad were required to obtain an expensive government permit and a letter 
of invitation.[119][120][121] In 1961 the Cuban government had imposed 
broad restrictions on travel to prevent the mass emigration of people after 
the 1959 revolution;[122] it approved exit visas only on rare occasions.[123] 
Requirements were simplified: Cubans need only a passport and a national 
ID card to leave; and they are allowed to take their young children with 
them for the first time.[124] However, a passport costs on average five 
months' salary. Observers expect that Cubans with paying relatives abroad 
are most likely to be able to take advantage of the new policy.[125] In 
the first year of the program, over 180,000 left Cuba and returned.[126] 
As of December 2014, talks with Cuban officials and American officials 
including President Barack Obama have resulted in the exchange of releasing 
Alan Gross, fifty-two political prisoners, and an unnamed non-citizen agent 
of the United States in return for the release of three Cuban agents currently 
imprisoned in the United States. Additionally, while the embargo between 
the United States and Cuba will not be immediately lifted, it will be relaxed 
to allow import, export, and certain commerce within a limit between the 
two.[127] The Republic of Cuba is one of the world's last remaining socialist 
countries following the Marxist-Leninist ideology. The Constitution of 
1976, which defined Cuba as a socialist republic, was replaced by the Constitution 
of 1992, which is "guided by the ideas of José Martí and the political 
and social ideas of Marx, Engels and Lenin."[4] The constitution describes 
the Communist Party of Cuba as the "leading force of society and of the 
state".[4] The First Secretary of the Communist Party is concurrently President 
of the Council of State (President of Cuba) and President of the Council 
of Ministers (sometimes referred to as Premier of Cuba).[128] Members of 
both councils are elected by the National Assembly of People's Power.[4] 
The President of Cuba, who is also elected by the Assembly, serves for 
five years and there is no limit to the number of terms of office.[4] The 
People's Supreme Court serves as Cuba's highest judicial branch of government. 
It is also the court of last resort for all appeals against the decisions 
of provincial courts. Cuba's national legislature, the National Assembly 
of People's Power (Asamblea Nacional de Poder Popular), is the supreme 
organ of power; 609 members serve five-year terms.[4] The assembly meets 
twice a year; between sessions legislative power is held by the 31 member 
Council of Ministers. Candidates for the Assembly are approved by public 
referendum. All Cuban citizens over 16 who have not been convicted of a 
criminal offense can vote.[129] Article 131 of the Constitution states 
that voting shall be "through free, equal and secret vote".[4] Article 
136 states: "In order for deputies or delegates to be considered elected 
they must get more than half the number of valid votes cast in the electoral 
districts".[4] No political party is permitted to nominate candidates or 
campaign on the island, including the Communist Party.[130] The Communist 
Party of Cuba has held six party congress meetings since 1975. In 2011, 
the party stated that there were 800,000 members, and representatives generally 
constitute at least half of the Councils of state and the National Assembly. 
The remaining positions are filled by candidates nominally without party 
affiliation. Other political parties campaign and raise finances internationally, 
while activity within Cuba by opposition groups is minimal. In February 
2013, Raúl Castro, current Cuban President, announced his resignation for 
2018, that will end his current 5-year term, and hope to implement permanent 
term limits for future Cuban Presidents, including age limits.[131] The 
country is subdivided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla 
de la Juventud). These were formerly part of six larger historical provinces: 
Pinar del Río, Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camagüey and Oriente. The 
present subdivisions closely resemble those of the Spanish military provinces 
during the Cuban Wars of Independence, when the most troublesome areas 
were subdivided. The provinces are divided into municipalities. The Cuban 
government has been accused of numerous human rights abuses including torture, 
arbitrary imprisonment, unfair trials, and extrajudicial executions (also 
known as "El Paredón").[17][132] Human Rights Watch has stated that the 
government "represses nearly all forms of political dissent" and that "Cubans 
are systematically denied basic rights to free expression, association, 
assembly, privacy, movement, and due process of law".[133] In 2003, the 
European Union (EU) accused the Cuban government of "continuing flagrant 
violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms".[134] It has continued 
to call regularly for social and economic reform in Cuba, along with the 
unconditional release of all political prisoners.[135] The United States 
continues an embargo against Cuba "so long as it continues to refuse to 
move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights",[136] 
though the UN General Assembly has, since 1992, passed a resolution every 
year condemning the ongoing impact of the embargo and claiming it to be 
in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.[137] 
Cuba considers the embargo itself to be in violation of human rights.[138] 
On December 17, 2014, United States President Barack Obama announced the 
re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba, pushing for Congress 
to put an end to the embargo.[139] Cuba had the second-highest number of 
imprisoned journalists of any nation in 2008 (China had the highest) according 
to various sources, including the Committee to Protect Journalists and 
Human Rights Watch.[140][141] Cuban dissidents face arrest and imprisonment. 
In the 1990s, Human Rights Watch reported that Cuba's extensive prison 
system, one of the largest in Latin America, consists of 40 maximum-security 
prisons, 30 minimum-security prisons, and over 200 work camps.[142] According 
to Human Rights Watch, Cuba's prison population is confined in "substandard 
and unhealthy conditions, where prisoners face physical and sexual abuse."[142] 
In July 2010, the unofficial Cuban Human Rights Commission said there were 
167 political prisoners in Cuba, a fall from 201 at the start of the year. 
The head of the commission stated that long prison sentences were being 
replaced by harassment and intimidation.[143] Cuba under Castro was heavily 
involved in wars in Africa, Central America and Asia. Cuba supported Algeria 
in 1961–5.[144] Cuba sent tens of thousands of troops to Angola during 
the Angolan Civil War.[145] Other countries that featured Cuban involvement 
include Ethiopia,[146][147] Guinea,[148] Guinea-Bissau,[149] Mozambique,[150] 
and Yemen.[151] Cuba has conducted a foreign policy that is uncharacteristic 
of such a minor, developing country.[152][153] Lesser known actions include 
the 1959 missions to the Dominican Republic.[154] The expedition failed, 
but a prominent monument to its members was erected in their memory in 
Santo Domingo by the Dominican government, and they feature prominently 
at the country's Memorial Museum of the Resistance.[155] Cuba is a founding 
member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas.[156] At the end of 
2012, tens of thousands of Cuban medical personnel worked abroad,[157] 
with as many as 30,000 doctors in Venezuela alone via the two countries' 
oil-for-doctors programme.[158] In 1996, the United States, then under 
President Bill Clinton, brought in the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity 
Act, better known as the Helms–Burton Act.[159] In 2008, the EU and Cuba 
agreed to resume full relations and cooperation activities.[160] United 
States President Barack Obama stated on April 17, 2009, in Trinidad and 
Tobago that "the United States seeks a new beginning with Cuba",[161] and 
reversed the Bush Administration's prohibition on travel and remittances 
by Cuban-Americans from the United States to Cuba.[162] On December 17, 
2014, an agreement between the United States and Cuba, popularly called 
"The Cuban Thaw", brokered in part by Canada and Pope Francis, began the 
process of restoring international relations between Cuba and the United 
States. Cuba and the US agreed to release political prisoners and the United 
States began the process of creating an embassy in Havana.[163][164][165][166][167] 
On April 14, 2015, the White House announced President Obama will remove 
Cuba from the American government's list of nations which sponsor terrorism.[168][169] 
The Cuban government has reportedly welcomed the decision as "fair".[170] 
On June 30, 2015, Cuba and the U.S. reached a deal to reopen embassies 
in their respective capitals on July 20, 2015[171] and reestablish diplomatic 
relations.[172] All law enforcement agencies are maintained under Cuba's 
Ministry of the Interior which is supervised by the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces. In Cuba, citizens can receive police assistance by dialing "106" 
on their telephones.[173] The police force, which is referred to as "Policía 
Nacional Revolucionaria" or PNR is then expected to provide help. The Cuban 
government also has an agency called the Intelligence Directorate that 
conducts intelligence operations and maintains close ties with the Russian 
Federal Security Service. As of 2009[update], Cuba spent about US$91.8 
million on its armed forces.[174] In 1985, Cuba devoted more than 10% of 
its GDP to military expenditures.[175] In response to perceived American 
aggression, such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Cuba built up one of the 
largest armed forces in Latin America, second only to that of Brazil.[176] 
From 1975 until the late 1980s, Soviet military assistance enabled Cuba 
to upgrade its military capabilities. After the loss of Soviet subsidies, 
Cuba scaled down the numbers of military personnel, from 235,000 in 1994 
to about 60,000 in 2003.[177] The Cuban state claims to adhere to socialist 
principles in organizing its largely state-controlled planned economy. 
Most of the means of production are owned and run by the government and 
most of the labor force is employed by the state. Recent years have seen 
a trend toward more private sector employment. By 2006, public sector employment 
was 78% and private sector 22%, compared to 91.8% to 8.2% in 1981.[178] 
Cuba's government spending as a percentage of GDP is 78.1 percent.[179] 
Any firm wishing to hire a Cuban must pay the Cuban government, which in 
turn will pay the employee in Cuban pesos.[180] The average monthly wage 
as of July 2013 is 466 Cuban pesos, which are worth about US$19.[181] Cuba 
has a dual currency system, whereby most wages and prices are set in Cuban 
pesos (CUP), while the tourist economy operates with Convertible pesos 
(CUC), set at par with the US dollar.[181] Every Cuban household has a 
ration book (known as libreta) entitling it to a monthly supply of food 
and other staples, which are provided at nominal cost.[182] Before Fidel 
Castro's 1959 revolution, Cuba was one of the most advanced and successful 
countries in Latin America.[183] Cuba's capital, Havana, was a "glittering 
and dynamic city".[183] The country's economy in the early part of the 
century, fuelled by the sale of sugar to the United States, had grown wealthy. 
Cuba ranked 5th in the hemisphere in per capita income, 3rd in life expectancy, 
2nd in per capita ownership of automobiles and telephones, and 1st in the 
number of television sets per inhabitant. Cuba's literacy rate, 76%, was 
the fourth highest in Latin America. Cuba also ranked 11th in the world 
in the number of doctors per capita. Several private clinics and hospitals 
provided services for the poor. Cuba's income distribution compared favorably 
with that of other Latin American societies. However, income inequality 
was a profound issue between city and countryside, especially between whites 
and blacks. Cubans lived in abysmal poverty in the countryside. A thriving 
middle class, according to PBS, held the promise of prosperity and social 
mobility.[183] According to Cuba historian Louis Perez of the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, "Havana was then what Las Vegas has become."[184] 
After the Cuban revolution and before the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
Cuba depended on Moscow for substantial aid and sheltered markets for its 
exports. The removal of these subsidies sent the Cuban economy into a rapid 
depression known in Cuba as the Special Period. Cuba took limited free 
market-oriented measures to alleviate severe shortages of food, consumer 
goods, and services. These steps included allowing some self-employment 
in certain retail and light manufacturing sectors, the legalization of 
the use of the US dollar in business, and the encouragement of tourism. 
Cuba has developed a unique urban farm system (the organopónicos) to compensate 
for the end of food imports from the Soviet Union. It's widely viewed that 
the U.S. embargo which initiated as a result of discontent with nationalization 
of U.S.-citizen-held property and later perceived human rights violations 
hurts the Cuban economy. In 2009, the Cuban Government estimated they lose 
$685 million annually from the US embargo.[185] The leadership of Cuba 
has called for reforms in the country's agricultural system. In 2008, Raúl 
Castro began enacting agrarian reforms to boost food production, as at 
that time 80% of food was imported. The reforms enacted are aimed at expanding 
land usage and increasing efficiency.[186] Venezuela supplies Cuba with 
an estimated 110,000 barrels (17,000 m3) a day of oil in exchange for money 
and the services of some 44,000 Cubans, most of them medical personnel, 
in Venezuela.[187] Estimates place Venezuelan assistance at over 20% of 
the Cuban GDP for 2008–2010, similar to the aid flows from the Soviet Union 
in 1985–1988.[188] In 2005, Cuba had exports of US$2.4 billion, ranking 
114 of 226 world countries, and imports of US$6.9 billion, ranking 87 of 
226 countries.[189] Its major export partners are Canada 17.7%, China 16.9%, 
Venezuela 12.5%, Netherlands 9%, and Spain 5.9% (2012).[190] Cuba's major 
exports are sugar, nickel, tobacco, fish, medical products, citrus fruits, 
and coffee;[190] imports include food, fuel, clothing, and machinery. Cuba 
presently holds debt in an amount estimated to be $13 billion,[191] approximately 
38% of GDP.[192] According to the Heritage Foundation, Cuba is dependent 
on credit accounts that rotate from country to country.[193] Cuba's prior 
35% supply of the world's export market for sugar has declined to 10% due 
to a variety of factors, including a global sugar commodity price drop 
that made Cuba less competitive on world markets.[194] It was announced 
in 2008 that wage caps would be abandoned to improve the nation's productivity.[195] 
In 2010[update], Cubans were allowed to build their own houses. According 
to Raúl Castro, they will be able to improve their houses with this new 
permission, but the government will not endorse these new houses or improvements.[196] 
There is virtually no homelessness in Cuba, and 85% of Cubans own their 
own homes and pay no property taxes or interest on their mortgages. Mortgage 
payments can’t exceed 10% of the combined household income.[185][197] On 
August 2, 2011, The New York Times reported Cuba as reaffirming their intent 
to legalize "buying and selling" of private property before the year's 
end. According to experts, the private sale of property could "transform 
Cuba more than any of the economic reforms announced by President Raúl 
Castro's government".[198] It will cut more than one million state jobs, 
including party bureaucrats who resist the changes.[199] The new economic 
reforms effectively created a new economic system, referred by some as 
the "New Cuban Economy".[200][201] In October 2013, Raul said he intends 
to merge the two currencies. As of August 2016, the dual currency system 
remains in force. In August 2012, a specialist of the "Cubaenergia Company" 
announced the opening of Cuba's first Solar Power Plant. As a member of 
the Cubasolar Group, there was also a mention of 10 additional plants in 
2013.[202] Cuba's natural resources include sugar, tobacco, fish, citrus 
fruits, coffee, beans, rice, potatoes, and livestock.[203] The output of 
Cuba's nickel mines that year was 71,000 tons, approaching 4% of world 
production.[204] As of 2013[update] its reserves were estimated at 5.5 
million tons, over 7% of the world total.[204] Sherritt International of 
Canada operates a large nickel mining facility in Moa. Cuba is also a major 
producer of refined cobalt, a by-product of nickel mining operations.[205] 
Oil exploration in 2005 by the US Geological Survey revealed that the North 
Cuba Basin could produce approximately 4.6 billion barrels (730,000,000 m3) 
to 9.3 billion barrels (1.48×109 m3) of oil. In 2006, Cuba started to test-drill 
these locations for possible exploitation.[206] Tourism was initially restricted 
to enclave resorts where tourists would be segregated from Cuban society, 
referred to as "enclave tourism" and "tourism apartheid".[207] Contacts 
between foreign visitors and ordinary Cubans were de facto illegal between 
1992 and 1997.[208] The rapid growth of tourism during the Special Period 
had widespread social and economic repercussions in Cuba, and led to speculation 
about the emergence of a two-tier economy.[209] Cuba has tripled its market 
share of Caribbean tourism in the last decade;[when?] as a result of significant 
investment in tourism infrastructure, this growth rate is predicted to 
continue.[210] 1.9 million tourists visited Cuba in 2003, predominantly 
from Canada and the European Union, generating revenue of US$2.1 billion.[211] 
Cuba recorded 2,688,000 international tourists in 2011, the third-highest 
figure in the Caribbean (behind the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico).[212] 
The medical tourism sector caters to thousands of European, Latin American, 
Canadian, and American consumers every year. Allegations of widespread 
sex tourism are downplayed by the Cuban Justice minister.[213] According 
to a Government of Canada travel advice website, "Cuba is actively working 
to prevent child sex tourism, and a number of tourists, including Canadians, 
have been convicted of offences related to the corruption of minors aged 
16 and under. Prison sentences range from 7 to 25 years."[214] Cuba is 
an archipelago of islands located in the northern Caribbean Sea at the 
confluence with the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between 
latitudes 19° and 24°N, and longitudes 74° and 85°W. The United States 
lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) across the Straits of Florida to the north 
and northwest (to the closest tip of Key West, Florida), and the Bahamas 
21 km (13 mi) to the north. Mexico lies 210 kilometers (130 miles) across 
the Yucatán Channel to the west (to the closest tip of Cabo Catoche in 
the State of Quintana Roo). Haiti is 77 km (48 mi) to the east, Jamaica 
(140 km/87 mi) and the Cayman Islands to the south. Cuba is the principal 
island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the Colorados Archipelago 
on the northwestern coast, the Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago on the north-central 
Atlantic coast, the Jardines de la Reina on the south-central coast and 
the Canarreos Archipelago on the southwestern coast. The main island, named 
Cuba, is 1,250 km (780 mi) long, constituting most of the nation's land 
area (104,556 km2 (40,369 sq mi)) and is the largest island in the Caribbean 
and 17th-largest island in the world by land area. The main island consists 
mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the Sierra Maestra mountains 
in the southeast, whose highest point is Pico Turquino (1,974 m (6,476 ft)). 
The second-largest island is Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth) in the 
Canarreos archipelago, with an area of 2,200 km2 (849 sq mi). Cuba has 
an official area (land area) of 109,884 km2 (42,426 sq mi). Its area is 
110,860 km2 (42,803 sq mi) including coastal and territorial waters. With 
most of the island south of the Tropic of Cancer, the local climate is 
tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. 
The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in 
warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than 
that of Hong Kong, which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has 
a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), 
there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from 
May to October. The average temperature is 21 °C (69.8 °F) in January and 
27 °C (80.6 °F) in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and 
the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico combine 
to make the country prone to frequent hurricanes. These are most common 
in September and October. Cuba signed the Rio Convention on Biological 
Diversity on June 12, 1992, and became a party to the convention on March 
8, 1994.[215] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy 
and Action Plan, with one revision which was received by the convention 
on January 24, 2008.[216] The revision comprises an action plan with time 
limits for each item, and an indication of the governmental body responsible 
for delivery. There is, however, virtually no information in that document 
about biodiversity itself. The country's fourth national report to the 
CBD, however, contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of 
each kingdom of life recorded from Cuba, the main groups being: animals 
(17,801 species), bacteria (270 species), chromista (707 species), fungi, 
including lichen-forming species (5844 species), plants (9107 species) 
and protozoa (1440 species).[217] As elsewhere in the world, vertebrate 
animals and flowering plants are well documented. The numbers recorded 
from Cuba for those groups are therefore likely to be close to the numbers 
which actually occur in Cuba. For most if not all of the other groups, 
however, the true numbers of species occurring in Cuba are likely to exceed, 
often considerably, the numbers of those recorded so far. According to 
the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 
5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women.[218] Its birth rate (9.88 births per 
thousand population in 2006)[219] is one of the lowest in the Western Hemisphere. 
Although the country has grown by around 4 million people since 1961, the 
rate of increase had simultaneously began to fall during that period, and 
the population began to decline in 2006, with a fertility rate of 1.43 
children per woman.[220] Indeed, this drop in fertility is among the largest 
in the Western Hemisphere,[221] and is attributed largely to unrestricted 
access to legal abortion: Cuba's abortion rate was 58.6 per 1000 pregnancies 
in 1996, compared to an average of 35 in the Caribbean, 27 in Latin America 
overall, and 48 in Europe. Similarly, the use of contraceptives is also 
widespread, estimated at 79% of the female population (in the upper third 
of countries in the Western Hemisphere).[222] Cuba's population is multiethnic, 
reflecting its complex colonial origins. Intermarriage between diverse 
groups is widespread, and consequently there is some discrepancy in reports 
of the country's racial composition: whereas the Institute for Cuban and 
Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami determined that 62% of 
Cubans are black,[223] the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion 
of the population, 65.05%, was white. In fact, the Minority Rights Group 
International determined that "An objective assessment of the situation 
of Afro-Cubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of 
systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution. Estimates of the percentage 
of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously, ranging 
from 34% to 62%".[224] An study from 2014 found the autosomal genetic ancestry 
in Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African and 8% Native American;[225] 35% 
of maternal lineages derived from Cuban Native Americans, compared to 39% 
from Africa and 26% from Europe, but male lineages were exclusively European 
(82%) and African (18%), indicating the historical bias towards mating 
between foreign men and native women rather than the inverse.[225] Ancestral 
contributions in Cubans as inferred from autosomal AIMs. Ancestral contributions 
in Cubans as inferred from Y-chromosome markers. Ancestral contributions 
in Cubans as inferred from mtDNA markers. Asians make up about 1% of the 
population, and are largely of Chinese ancestry, followed by Filipinos,[citation 
needed] Japanese[226][227] and Vietnamese.[citation needed] Many are descendants 
of farm laborers brought to the island by Spanish and American contractors 
during the 19th and early 20th century.[228] The currently recorded number 
of Cubans with Chinese ancestry is 114,240.[229] Afro-Cubans are descended 
primarily from the Yoruba people,[citation needed] as well as several thousand 
North African refugees, most notably the Sahrawi Arabs of Western Sahara.[230] 
Immigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cuba's demographic 
profile. Between the 18th and early 20th century, large waves of Canarian, 
Catalan, Andalusian, Galician, and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba. 
Between 1899-1930 alone, close to a million Spaniards entered the country, 
though many would eventually return to Spain.[231] Other prominent immigrant 
groups included French,[232] Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Dutch, Greek, 
British, and Irish, as well as small number of descendants of U.S. citizens 
who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Post-revolution 
Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration, which 
has led to a large and influential diaspora community. During the three 
decades after January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social 
classes — constituting 10% of the total population — emigrated to the United 
States, a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the U.S. 
from the Caribbean as a whole during that period.[233][234][235][236][237] 
Other common destinations include Spain, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, 
and Sweden, among others. Those who left the country typically did so by 
sea, in small boats and fragile rafts. On September 9, 1994, the U.S. and 
Cuban governments agreed that the U.S. would grant at least 20,000 visas 
annually in exchange for Cuba's pledge to prevent further unlawful departures 
on boats.[238] In 2010, the religious affiliation of the country was estimated 
by the Pew Forum to be 65% Christian (60% Roman Catholic or about 6.9 million 
in 2016, 5% Evangelical Protestant or about 575,000 in 2016), 23% unaffiliated, 
17% folk religion (such as santería), and the remaining 0.4% consisting 
of other religions.[239] Cuba is officially a secular state. Religious 
freedom increased through the 1980s,[240] with the government amending 
the constitution in 1992 to drop the state's characterization as atheistic.[241] 
Roman Catholicism is the largest religion, with its origins rooted in Spanish 
colonization. Despite less than half of the population identifying as Catholics 
in 2006, it nonetheless remains the dominant faith.[193] Pope John Paul 
II and Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in 1998 and 2011, respectively, and 
Pope Francis visited Cuba in September 2015.[242][243] Prior to each papal 
visit, the Cuban government pardoned prisoners as a humanitarian gesture.[244][245] 
The government's relaxation of restrictions on house churches in the 1990s 
led to "an explosion of Pentecostalism", with some groups claiming as many 
as 100,000 members. However, mainline evangelical sects, organized into 
the umbrella Cuban Council of Churches, remain much more powerful.[246] 
The religious landscape of Cuba is also strongly defined by syncretisms 
of various kinds. Christianity is often practiced in tandem with Santería, 
a mixture of Catholicism and mostly African faiths, which include a number 
of cults. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (the Virgin of Cobre) is the 
Catholic patroness of Cuba, and a symbol of Cuban culture. In Santería, 
she has been syncretized with the goddess Oshun. Cuba also hosts small 
communities of Jews (500 in 2012), Muslims, and members of the Bahá'í Faith.[247] 
Several well-known Cuban religious figures have operated outside the island, 
including the humanitarian and author Jorge Armando Pérez. The official 
language of Cuba is Spanish and the vast majority of Cubans speak it. Spanish 
as spoken in Cuba is known as Cuban Spanish and is a form of Caribbean 
Spanish. Lucumí, a dialect of the West African language Yoruba, is also 
used as a liturgical language by practitioners of Santería,[248] and so 
only as a second language.[249] Haitian Creole is the second largest language 
in Cuba, and is spoken by Haitian immigrants and their descendants.[250] 
Other languages spoken by immigrants include Galician and Corsican.[251] 
The Cuban government and Communist Party of Cuba control almost all media 
in Cuba. Five Communist controlled national channels: Internet in Cuba 
has some of the lowest penetration rates in the Western hemisphere, and 
all content is subject to review by the Department of Revolutionary Orientation.[252] 
ETECSA operates 118 cybercafes in the country.[252] The government of Cuba 
provides an online encyclopedia website called EcuRed that operates in 
a "wiki" format.[253] Internet access is limited.[254] The sale of computer 
equipment is strictly regulated. Internet access is controlled, and e-mail 
is closely monitored.[255] Cuban culture is influenced by its melting pot 
of cultures, primarily those of Spain and Africa. After the 1959 revolution, 
the government started a national literacy campaign, offered free education 
to all and established rigorous sports, ballet and music programs.[256] 
Cuban music is very rich and is the most commonly known expression of Cuban 
culture. The central form of this music is Son, which has been the basis 
of many other musical styles like "Danzón de nuevo ritmo", Mambo (music), 
Chachachá and Salsa music. Rumba ("de cajón o de solar") music originated 
in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Hispanic elements of style.[257] 
The Tres was invented in Cuba from Hispanic cordophone instruments models 
(the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar 
and lute). Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, Taíno 
origin, or both, such as the maracas, güiro, marímbula and various wooden 
drums including the mayohuacán. Popular Cuban music of all styles has been 
enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which 
includes music with strong African and European influences, and features 
symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international 
acclaim thanks to composers like Ernesto Lecuona. Havana was the heart 
of the rap scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s. During that time, 
reggaetón was growing in popularity. In 2011, the Cuban state denounced 
reggaeton as degenerate, directed reduced "low-profile" airplay of the 
genre (but did not ban it entirely) and banned the megahit Chupi Chupi 
by Osmani García, characterizing its description of sex as "the sort which 
a prostitute would carry out".[258] In December 2012, the Cuban government 
officially banned sexually explicit reggaeton songs and music videos from 
radio and television.[259][260] As well as pop, classical and rock are 
very popular in Cuba. Cuban cuisine is a fusion of Spanish and Caribbean 
cuisines. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, 
with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which 
has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common 
availability of these dishes.[261] The traditional Cuban meal is not served 
in courses; all food items are served at the same time. The typical meal 
could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ropa vieja (shredded 
beef), Cuban bread, pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans 
and rice, referred to as Moros y Cristianos (or moros for short), and plantains 
are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly 
with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant 
spices. Cuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. 
Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by José Martí, 
who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as Nicolás 
Guillén and José Z. Tallet focused on literature as social protest. The 
poetry and novels of Dulce María Loynaz and José Lezama Lima have been 
influential. Romanticist Miguel Barnet, who wrote Everyone Dreamed of Cuba, 
reflects a more melancholy Cuba.[262] Writers such as Reinaldo Arenas, 
Guillermo Cabrera Infante, and more recently Daína Chaviano, Pedro Juan 
Gutiérrez, Zoé Valdés, Guillermo Rosales and Leonardo Padura have earned 
international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of 
these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to 
ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities. Dance holds a privileged 
position in Cuban culture. Popular dance is considered an essential part 
of life, and concert dance is supported by the government and includes 
internationally renowned companies such as the Ballet Nacional de Cuba.[263] 
Due to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate 
in sports which are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally 
promoted in other Latin American nations. Baseball is by far the most popular; 
other sports and pastimes include football, basketball, volleyball, cricket, 
and athletics. Cuba is a dominant force in amateur boxing, consistently 
achieving high medal tallies in major international competitions. Cuba 
also provides a national team that competes in the Olympic Games.[264] 
The University of Havana was founded in 1728 and there are a number of 
other well-established colleges and universities. In 1957, just before 
Castro came to power, the literacy rate was fourth in the region at almost 
80% according to the United Nations, higher than in Spain.[86][265] Castro 
created an entirely state-operated system and banned private institutions. 
School attendance is compulsory from ages six to the end of basic secondary 
education (normally at age 15), and all students, regardless of age or 
gender, wear school uniforms with the color denoting grade level. Primary 
education lasts for six years, secondary education is divided into basic 
and pre-university education.[266] Cuba's literacy rate of 99.8 percent[190][267] 
is the tenth-highest globally, due largely to the provision of free education 
at every level.[268] Cuba's high school graduation rate is 94 percent.[269] 
Higher education is provided by universities, higher institutes, higher 
pedagogical institutes, and higher polytechnic institutes. The Cuban Ministry 
of Higher Education operates a scheme of distance education which provides 
regular afternoon and evening courses in rural areas for agricultural workers. 
Education has a strong political and ideological emphasis, and students 
progressing to higher education are expected to have a commitment to the 
goals of Cuba.[266] Cuba has provided state subsidized education to a limited 
number of foreign nationals at the Latin American School of Medicine.[270][271] 
According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, the top-ranking 
universities in the country are Universidad de la Habana (1680th worldwide), 
Instituto Superior Politécnico José Antonio Echeverría (2893rd) and the 
University of Santiago de Cuba (3831st).[272] Cuba's life expectancy at 
birth is 78 years.[190] Historically, Cuba has ranked high in numbers of 
medical personnel and has made significant contributions to world health 
since the 19th century.[86] Today, Cuba has universal health care and although 
shortages of medical supplies persist, there is no shortage of medical 
personnel.[273] Primary care is available throughout the island and infant 
and maternal mortality rates compare favorably with those in developed 
nations.[273] Post-Revolution Cuba initially experienced an overall worsening 
in terms of disease and infant mortality rates in the 1960s when half its 
6,000 doctors left the country.[274] Recovery occurred by the 1980s,[76] 
and the country's healthcare has been widely praised.[275] The Communist 
government asserted that universal health care was to become a priority 
of state planning and progress was made in rural areas.[276] Like the rest 
of the Cuban economy, Cuban medical care suffered from severe material 
shortages following the end of Soviet subsidies in 1991, followed by a 
tightening of the U.S. embargo in 1992.[277] Challenges include low salaries 
for doctors,[278] poor facilities, poor provision of equipment, and the 
frequent absence of essential drugs.[279] Cuba has the highest doctor-to-population 
ratio in the world and has sent thousands of doctors to more than 40 countries 
around the world.[280] According to the World Health Organization, Cuba 
is "known the world over for its ability to train excellent doctors and 
nurses who can then go out to help other countries in need". As of September 
2014 there are around 50,000 Cuban-trained health care workers aiding 66 
nations.[281] Cuban physicians have played a leading role in combating 
the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa.[282] According to the UN, the 
life expectancy in Cuba is 78.3 years (76.2 for males and 80.4 for females). 
This ranks Cuba 37th in the world and 3rd in the Americas, behind only 
Canada and Chile, and just ahead of the United States. Infant mortality 
in Cuba declined from 32 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1957, to 
10 in 1990–95.[283] Infant mortality in 2000–2005 was 6.1 per 1,000 live 
births. Its infant mortality rate is 5.13.[190][267] In Cuba, there is 
a need to import certain pharmaceutical drugs. Therefore, the Quimefa Pharmaceutical 
Business Group (FARMACUBA) was developed under the Ministry of Basic Industry 
(MINBAS). This group also handles the exporting of pharmaceuticals, and 
provide technical information for the production of these drugs.[284] Isolated 
from the West, Cuba developed the successful lung cancer vaccine, Cimavax, 
which now is available to US researchers for the first time, along with 
other novel Cuban cancer treatments. The vaccine has been available for 
free to the Cuban population since 2011.[285] According to Roswell Park 
Cancer Institute CEO Candace Johnson: "They've had to do more with less, 
so they've had to be even more innovative with how they approach things. 
For over 40 years, they have had a preeminent immunology community."[286] 
In 2015, Cuba became the first country to eradicate mother-to-child transmission 
of HIV and syphilis,[287] a milestone hailed by the World Health Organization
