Juan De Dios Encarnación (born March 8, 1976) is a former Major League 
Baseball outfielder. He played for the Detroit Tigers, Cincinnati Reds, 
Florida Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals. Encarnación 
suffered a career-ending injury after getting hit in the eye by a foul 
ball on August 31, 2007. Encarnación was signed by the Detroit Tigers as 
an amateur free agent in 1992, at age 17, and made his Major League debut 
in 1997 at age 21 for the Tigers. He was the fourth youngest player in 
the AL that year. Encarnación played for the Tigers until 2002, when he 
was traded and had his best season as a Cincinnati Red and Florida Marlin, 
hitting a career-high 24 home runs and driving in 85 runs. In 2003 he had 
94 RBI as well as a team-leading 37 doubles on the way to a World Series 
ring after winning the 2003 World Series with Florida. He was then traded 
to the Los Angeles Dodgers in December of that year. He was traded back 
to Florida midway through the 2004 season along with Paul Lo Duca and Guillermo 
Mota for Brad Penny, Bill Murphy, and Hee-seop Choi after hitting a disappointing 
.235 in 86 games. Encarnación bounced back with a solid year in 2005, batting 
.287 with 16 homers and 76 runs batted in. He was also on the roster for 
the Dominican team in the inaugural World Baseball Classic.[1] Encarnación 
signed a three-year contract with St. Louis on December 23, 2005, worth 
$15 million.[2] Encarnación finished the 2006 season, his first with the 
Cardinals, batting .278 with 19 home runs and 79 RBI for the Cards, with 
6 steals. He led the Cardinals in games played (153) and at bats (557), 
was third in runs scored (74), second in hits (155), fourth in doubles 
(25), tied for first with Aaron Miles in triples (5), tied for fourth with 
Jim Edmonds in home runs (19), third in RBI (79), third in total bases 
(247), tied for eighth with Chris Duncan in walks (30), third in strikeouts 
(86), sixth in steals (6), second in caught stealing (5), 11th in on-base 
percentage (.317), sixth in slugging average (.443), and seventh in batting 
average (.278). He also had 265 put-outs, 4 assists, and 6 errors in 275 
total chances, for a .978 fielding percentage.[3] In the playoffs he was 
8-for-44 (.182) with two triples and five RBI. He hit an RBI triple in 
Game 4 of the NLDS which turned out to be the game-winner, as the Cardinals 
went on to beat the Padres, 6–4, winning the series. However, he struggled 
the rest of the postseason and sat the final 3 games of the World Series, 
in which the Cardinals defeated the Detroit Tigers, 4 games to 1. Encarnación 
confused many fans when he, without explanation, did not appear at the 
Cardinals' World Series victory parade. It is rumored that he was upset 
over not playing in game 5 of the World Series. This marked the second 
time he has won a World Series but skipped the victory parade with the 
winning team; he also skipped the 2003 Florida Marlins World Series victory 
parade.[4] The 2007 season marked Encarnación's tenth in the major leagues 
and his second with the Cardinals. Before the season, he had surgery on 
his left wrist and was not ready for opening day. He started the year on 
the 15-day disabled list.[5] Encarnación rehabbed first in Florida at extended 
Spring training, homering twice in three games. He did not appear in any 
games during regular Spring training. Next, he had a rehabilitation assignment 
at Double-A Springfield.[6] He batted just .155 (9-for-58) with 4 doubles 
and 4 runs batted in during the assignment. He returned to the Cardinals 
on Mother's Day, May 13, playing right field vs. San Diego, going 0-for-3. 
From May 30 to June 18, Encarnación had an 18-game hitting streak, just 
one short of his career-high of 19, which he set in 2000. He lost some 
playing time after the emergence of pitcher-turned outfielder Rick Ankiel. 
On August 31, Encarnación was struck in the face by a foul ball hit by 
teammate Aaron Miles while he was in the on-deck circle. Encarnación suffered 
multiple fractures to his left eye socket and an injury to his left eye 
and missed the remainder of the 2007 season.[7] On January 16, 2008 it 
was reported that he would miss the entire 2008 season, and the future 
of his career was in serious jeopardy.[8] On May 2, 2008, during a web 
chat hosted by MLB and the St. Louis Cardinals for fans to talk with the 
team's new general manager, John Mozeliak, a question was asked regarding 
the possibility of Encarnación returning to the team. Mozeliak stated "I'm 
sorry to say that he will not. His injury will likely result in his career 
ending." [9] On November 10, 2008, Encarnación filed for free agency, ending 
his tenure with the Cardinals. In July 2009, a Dominican news organization 
reported that Encarnación was organizing a run to become a senator in the 
Dominican Republic, representing his home province of San Juan de la Maguana.[10] 
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch later reported that the reports were unsubstantiated 
and without merit, and Juan had instead been working heavily on his charity, 
the Juan Encarnación Foundation. On Feb 7, 2011 Juan inaugurated the National 
Campaign Headquarters in San Juan de la Maguana of his independent Political 
Movement, M-12 in support of the PRD Party's Presidential Candidate Miguel 
Vargas Maldonado in 2012. Vargas Maldonado was present personally to support 
these efforts and to take juramentation of Juan's National Diplomatic team. 
He has National presence with 32 different affiliates in each Province 
in the Dominican Republic. Juan also is the leader of the National Sports 
Committee for Miguel Vargas' Presidential Project as part of the National
