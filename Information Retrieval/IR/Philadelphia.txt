Philadelphia  Kingdom of England  Kingdom of Great Britain Philadelphia 
(/ˌfɪləˈdɛlfiə/) is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
and the fifth-most populous in the United States, with an estimated population 
in 2014 of 1,560,297.[6][7][8][9][10] In the Northeastern United States, 
at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, Philadelphia is 
the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valley, a metropolitan 
area home to 7.2 million people and the eighth-largest combined statistical 
area in the United States. In 1682, William Penn founded the city to serve 
as capital of the Pennsylvania Colony.[11] Philadelphia played an instrumental 
role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers 
of the United States, who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 
and the Constitution in 1787. Philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals 
in the Revolutionary War, and served as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, 
D.C., was under construction. In the 19th century, Philadelphia became 
a major industrial center and railroad hub that grew from an influx of 
European immigrants. It became a prime destination for African-Americans 
in the Great Migration and surpassed two million occupants by 1950. Based 
on the similar shifts underway the nation's economy in the late 1960s Philadelphia 
experienced a loss of manufacturing companies and jobs to lower taxed regions 
of the USA and often overseas.[citation needed] As a result, the economic 
base of Philadelphia, which had historically been manufacturing, declined 
significantly. In addition, consolidation in several American industries 
(retailing, financial services and health care in particular) reduced the 
number of companies headquartered in Philadelphia. The economic impact 
of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources 
of local government. Philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment 
to these economic changes, coupled with significant demographic change 
as wealthier residents moved into the nearby suburbs and more immigrants 
moved into the city. The city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 
1980s.[12][13] Revitalization began in the late 1990s, with gentrification 
turning around many neighborhoods and reversing its decades-long trend 
of population loss. The area's many universities and colleges make Philadelphia 
a top international study destination, as the city has evolved into an 
educational and economic hub.[14][15] With a gross domestic product of 
$388 billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in 
the nation.[16] Philadelphia is the center of economic activity in Pennsylvania 
and is home to seven Fortune 1000 companies. The Philadelphia skyline is 
growing, with a market of almost 81,900 commercial properties in 2016[17] 
including several nationally prominent skyscrapers.[18] The city is known 
for its arts, culture, and history, attracting over 39 million domestic 
tourists in 2013.[19] Philadelphia has more outdoor sculptures and murals 
than any other American city,[20] and Fairmount Park is the largest landscaped 
urban park in the world.[21] The 67 National Historic Landmarks in the 
city helped account for the $10 billion generated by tourism.[19] Philadelphia 
is the birthplace of the United States Marine Corps,[22][23] and is also 
the home of many U.S. firsts, including the first library (1731),[24] first 
hospital (1751)[24] and medical school (1765),[25] first Capitol (1777),[24] 
first stock exchange (1790),[24] first zoo (1874),[26] and first business 
school (1881).[27] Philadelphia is the only World Heritage City in the 
United States.[28] Before Europeans arrived, the Philadelphia area was 
home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon. The 
Lenape are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government.[30] 
They are also called Delaware Indians[31] and their historical territory 
was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island and the Lower 
Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland 
during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by 
losses from intertribal conflicts.[31] Lenape communities were weakened 
by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and violent conflict with 
Europeans. Iroquois people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape 
moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary 
War and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, 
the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern 
United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding 
territory) under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape 
now reside in the US state of Oklahoma, with some communities living also 
in Wisconsin, Ontario (Canada) and in their traditional homelands. Europeans 
came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century, with the first settlements 
founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River 
opposite the Schuylkill River in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey. The 
Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New 
Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established 
the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina (present day Wilmington, Delaware) 
and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the 
Susquehannocks in their military defeat of the English colony of Maryland. 
In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, 
south of the Schuylkill near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, 
to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building 
Fort Nya Korsholm, named New Korsholm after a town that is now in Finland. 
In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General 
Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to 
independence, although the Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have 
their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy 
under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, 
but the situation did not really change until 1682, when the area was included 
in William Penn's charter for Pennsylvania. In 1681, in partial repayment 
of a debt, Charles II of England granted William Penn a charter for what 
would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought 
the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans 
and ensure peace for his colony.[32] Penn made a treaty of friendship with 
Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the 
city's Fishtown section.[33] Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is 
Greek for brotherly love (from philos, "love" or "friendship", and adelphos, 
"brother"). As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and 
wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This 
tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better 
relations with the local Native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid 
growth into America's most important city.[34] Penn planned a city on the 
Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that 
Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a 
city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses 
spread far apart, with areas for gardens and orchards. The city's inhabitants 
did not follow Penn's plans, as they crowded by the Delaware River, the 
port, and subdivided and resold their lots.[35] Before Penn left Philadelphia 
for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. 
It became an important trading center, poor at first, but with tolerable 
living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped 
improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a 
library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals. A number of 
important philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the 
city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture 
(1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures 
and the Useful Arts (1787), the Academy of Natural Sciences (1812), and 
the Franklin Institute (1824).[36] These worked to develop and finance 
new industries and attract skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe. 
Philadelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it 
a natural center for America's revolutionaries. By the 1750s, Philadelphia 
had surpassed Boston to become the largest city and busiest port in British 
America, and second in the British Empire, behind London.[37][38] The city 
hosted the First Continental Congress before the American Revolutionary 
War; the Second Continental Congress,[39] which signed the United States 
Declaration of Independence, during the war; and the Constitutional Convention 
(1787) after the war. Several battles were fought in and near Philadelphia 
as well. Philadelphia served as the temporary capital of the United States, 
1790–1800, while the Federal City was under construction in the District 
of Columbia.[40] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemics in U.S. history 
killed at least 4,000 and up to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, roughly 10% 
of the city's population.[41][42] The state government left Philadelphia 
in 1799, and the federal government was moved to Washington, DC in 1800 
with completion of the White House and Capitol. The city remained the young 
nation's largest with a population of nearly 50,000 at the turn of the 
19th century; it was a financial and cultural center. Before 1800, its 
free black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), 
the first independent black denomination in the country, and the first 
black Episcopal Church. The free black community also established many 
schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. New York City soon 
surpassed Philadelphia in population, but with the construction of roads, 
canals, and railroads, Philadelphia became the first major industrial city 
in the United States. Throughout the 19th century, Philadelphia had a variety 
of industries and businesses, the largest being textiles. Major corporations 
in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works, 
William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, and the Pennsylvania 
Railroad.[43] Industry, along with the U.S. Centennial, was celebrated 
in 1876 with the Centennial Exposition, the first official World's Fair 
in the United States. Immigrants, mostly Irish and German, settled in Philadelphia 
and the surrounding districts. The rise in population of the surrounding 
districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, which extended 
the city limits of Philadelphia from the 2 square miles of present-day 
Center City to the roughly 130 square miles of Philadelphia County.[44][45] 
These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike 
in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour 
workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing 
the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of 
South Street, and was later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established 
a network of Catholic churches and schools, and dominated the Catholic 
clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic Nativist riots had erupted 
in Philadelphia in 1844. In the latter half of the century, immigrants 
from Russia, Eastern Europe and Italy; and African Americans from the southern 
U.S. settled in the city.[46] Between 1880 and 1930, the African-American 
population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559.[47][48] Twentieth-century 
black newcomers were part of the Great Migration out of the rural South 
to northern and midwestern industrial cities. In the American Civil War, 
Philadelphia was represented by the Washington Grays (Philadelphia). By 
the 20th century, Philadelphia had become known as "corrupt and contented", 
with a complacent population and an entrenched Republican political machine.[49] 
The first major reform came in 1917 when outrage over the election-year 
murder of a police officer led to the shrinking of the Philadelphia City 
Council from two houses to just one.[50] In July 1919, Philadelphia was 
one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot 
of ethnic whites against blacks during Red Summer, in post-World War I 
unrest, as recent immigrants competed with blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, 
the public flouting of Prohibition laws, mob violence, and police involvement 
in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brigadier General Smedley 
Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as director of public safety, but political 
pressure prevented any long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.[51] 
In 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.[52] 
The population peaked at more than two million residents in 1950, then 
began to decline with the restructuring of industry, which led to the loss 
of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization had been 
drawing off many of the wealthier residents to outlying railroad commuting 
towns and newer housing. Revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods 
began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century, with much 
of the development in the Center City and University City areas of the 
city. After many of the old manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia 
or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began 
to more aggressively market itself as a tourist destination. Glass-and-granite 
skyscrapers were built in Center City. Historic areas such as Independence 
National Historical Park located in Old City and Society Hill were renovated 
during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s. They are 
now among the most desirable living areas of Center City. This has slowed 
the city's 40-year population decline after it lost nearly one-quarter 
of its population.[53][54] Philadelphia is at 39° 57′ north latitude and 
75° 10′ west longitude, and the 40th parallel north passes through the 
northern parts of the city. The city encompasses 142.6 square miles (369.3 km2), 
of which 135.1 square miles (349.9 km2) is land and 7.6 square miles (19.7 km2), 
or 5.29%, is water. Bodies of water include the Delaware and Schuylkill 
rivers, and Cobbs, Wissahickon, and Pennypack creeks. The lowest point 
is 10 feet (3 m) above sea level, while the highest point is in Chestnut 
Hill, about 445 feet (136 m) above sea level (near the intersection of 
Germantown Avenue and Bethlehem Pike).[55] Philadelphia sits on the Fall 
Line that separates the Atlantic Coastal Plain from the Piedmont.[56] The 
rapids on the Schuylkill River at East Falls were inundated by the completion 
of the Fairmount Dam.[57] The city is the seat of its own county. The adjacent 
counties are Montgomery to the north; Bucks to the northeast; Burlington 
County, New Jersey, to the east; Camden County, New Jersey, to the southeast; 
Gloucester County, New Jersey, to the south; and Delaware County to the 
west. Philadelphia's central city was created in the 17th century following 
the plan by William Penn's surveyor Thomas Holme. Center City is structured 
with long straight streets running east-west and north-south forming a 
grid pattern. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel 
and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent 
the spread of fire.[58] The Delaware River and Schuylkill Rivers served 
as early boundaries between which the city's early street plan was kept 
within. In addition, Penn planned the creation of five public parks in 
the city which were renamed in 1824[58] (in parenthesis): Centre Square, 
North East Publick Square (Franklin Square), Northwest Square (Logan Square), 
Southwest Square (Rittenhouse Square), and Southeast Square (Washington 
Square).[59] Center City has grown into the second-most populated downtown 
area in the United States, after Midtown Manhattan in New York City, with 
an estimated 183,240 residents in 2015.[60] Philadelphia's neighborhoods 
are divided into large sections—North, Northeast, Northwest, West, South 
and Southwest Philadelphia—all of which surround Center City, which corresponds 
closely with the city's limits before consolidation in 1854. Each of these 
large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive 
from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that made up Philadelphia 
County before their absorption into the city.[61] The City Planning Commission, 
tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the 
city into 18 planning districts as part of the Philadelphia2035 physical 
development plan.[63][64] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled 
from 2007–2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. 
Street and Michael Nutter. The zoning changes were intended to rectify 
incorrect zoning mapping that would streamline future community preferences 
and development, which the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents 
and 40,000 jobs to be added to Philadelphia in 2035. The Philadelphia Housing 
Authority is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, 
it is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, housing about 84,000 
people and employing 1,250. In 2013, its budget was $371 million.[65] The 
Philadelphia Parking Authority works to ensure adequate parking for city 
residents, businesses and visitors.[66] Philadelphia's architectural history 
dates back to Colonial times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest 
structures were of logs construction, but brick structures were common 
by 1700. During the 18th century, the cityscape was dominated by Georgian 
architecture, including Independence Hall and Christ Church. In the first 
decades of the 19th century, Federal architecture and Greek Revival architecture 
were dominated by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, William 
Strickland, John Haviland, John Notman, Thomas U. Walter, and Samuel Sloan.[68] 
Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second 
half of the 19th century, but his contemporaries included John McArthur, 
Jr., Addison Hutton, Wilson Eyre, the Wilson Brothers, and Horace Trumbauer. 
In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire-style Philadelphia City 
Hall. The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve 
the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains 
the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, adding historic buildings, 
structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.[69] In 1932, Philadelphia 
became home to the first International Style skyscraper in the United States, 
The PSFS Building, designed by George Howe and William Lescaze. It is the 
United States' first modern skyscraper and considered the most important 
one built in the first part of the 20th century. The 548 ft (167 m) City 
Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty 
Place was constructed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built 
in Philadelphia's Center City from the late 1980s onwards. In 2007, the 
Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest 
building. The Comcast Innovation and Technology Center is under construction 
in Center City and is planned to reach a height of 1,121 feet (342 meters); 
upon completion, the tower is expected to be the tallest skyscraper in 
the United States outside of New York City and Chicago.[18] For much of 
Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the row house. The row 
house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 
19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United 
States were known as "Philadelphia rows".[68] A variety of row houses are 
found throughout the city, from Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia 
to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes are scattered 
throughout the city, much of the housing is from the early 20th century 
or older. The great age of the homes has created numerous problems, including 
blight and vacant lots in many parts of the city, while other neighborhoods 
such as Society Hill, which has the largest concentration of 18th-century 
architecture in the United States, have been rehabilitated and gentrified.[70][71] 
Under the Köppen climate classification, Philadelphia falls in the northern 
periphery of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen Cfa).[72] Under 
the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime 
climate (Do).[73] Summers are typically hot and muggy, fall and spring 
are generally mild, and winter is cold. Snowfall is highly variable, with 
some winters bringing only light snow and others bringing several major 
snowstorms, with the normal seasonal snowfall standing at 22.4 in (57 cm); 
snow in November or April is rare, and a sustained snow cover is rare.[74] 
Precipitation is generally spread throughout the year, with eight to twelve 
wet days per month,[75] at an average annual rate of 41.5 inches (1,050 mm), 
but historically ranging from 29.31 in (744 mm) in 1922 to 64.33 in (1,634 mm) 
in 2011.[74] The most rain recorded in one day occurred on July 28, 2013, 
when 8.02 in (204 mm) fell at Philadelphia International Airport.[74] The 
January daily average is 33.0 °F (0.6 °C),[76] though, in a normal winter, 
the temperature frequently rises to 50 °F (10 °C) during thaws and dips 
to 10 °F (−12 °C) for 2 or 3 nights.[76] July averages 78.1 °F (25.6 °C),[76] 
although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent; 
highs reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on 27 days of the year. The average 
window for freezing temperatures is November 6 thru April 2,[74] allowing 
a growing season of 217 days. Early fall and late winter are generally 
dry; February's average of 2.64 inches (67 mm) makes it the area's driest 
month. The dewpoint in the summer averages between 59.1 °F (15 °C) to 64.5 °F 
(18 °C).[74] Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from trace amounts 
in 1972–73 to 78.7 inches (200 cm) in the winter of 2009–10.[74][b] The 
city's heaviest single-storm snowfall, at 30.7 in (78 cm), occurred in 
January 1996. The highest recorded temperature was 106 °F (41 °C) on August 
7, 1918, but 100 °F (38 °C)+ temperatures are uncommon.[77][c] The lowest 
officially recorded temperature was −11 °F (−24 °C) on February 9, 1934,[77] 
but with the last such occurrence being January 19, 1994,[74] temperatures 
at or below the 0 °F (−18 °C) mark are rare. The record low maximum is 
5 °F (−15 °C) on February 10, 1899 and December 30, 1880, while the record 
high minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) on July 23, 2011 and July 24, 2010. In the 
American Lung Association 2015 State of the Air report, Philadelphia County 
received an ozone grade of F and a 24-hour particle pollution rating of 
C. The county passed the annual particle pollution rating.[78] According 
to the 2015 United States Census estimates, there were 1,567,448 people 
residing in the City of Philadelphia,[87] representing a 2.2% increase 
since 2010. From the 1960s up until 2006, the city's population declined 
year after year. It eventually reached a low of 1,488,710 residents in 
2006 before beginning to rise again. Since 2006, Philadelphia added 71,587 
residents in eight years. A study done by the city projected that the population 
would increase to about 1,630,000 residents by 2035, an increase of about 
100,000 from 2010.[88] The racial makeup of the city in 2015 was 41.9% 
White (35.2% Non-Hispanic), 42.4% Black or African American (41.0% Non-Hispanic), 
0.5% Native American and Pacific Islander (0.2% Non-Hispanic), 7.2% Asian, 
and 8.0% Some other race or Two or More Races (2.5% Non-Hispanic), 14.0% 
of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[89][90] In comparison, 
the 2010 Census Redistricting Data indicated that the racial makeup of 
the city was 661,839 (43.4%) African American, 626,221 (41.0%) White, 6,996 
(0.5%) Native American, 96,405 (6.3%) Asian (2.0% Chinese, 1.2% Indian, 
0.9% Vietnamese, 0.6% Cambodian, 0.4% Korean, 0.3% Filipino, 0.2% Pakistani, 
0.1% Indonesian), 744 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 90,731 (5.9%) from other 
races, and 43,070 (2.8%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of 
any race were 187,611 persons (12.3%); 8.0% of Philadelphia is Puerto Rican, 
1.0% Dominican, 1.0% Mexican, 0.3% Cuban, and 0.3% Colombian.[95] The racial 
breakdown of Philadelphia's Hispanic/Latino population was 63,636 (33.9%) 
White, 17,552 (9.4%) African American, 3,498 (1.9%) Native American, 884 
(0.47%) Asian, 287 (0.15%) Pacific Islander, 86,626 (46.2%) from other 
races, and 15,128 (8.1%) from two or more races.[91] The five largest European 
ancestries reported in the 2010 United States Census Census included Irish 
(12.5%), Italian (8.4%), German (8.1%), Polish (3.6%), and English (3.0%).[96] 
According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population 
of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 41% professing attendance 
at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 26% professing 
Roman Catholic beliefs,[97][98] while 24% claim no religious affiliation. 
The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, 
Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 8% of the population The 
average population density was 11,457 people per square mile (4,405.4/km²). 
The Census reported that 1,468,623 people (96.2% of the population) lived 
in households, 38,007 (2.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, 
and 19,376 (1.3%) were institutionalized.[91] In 2013, the city reported 
having 668,247 total housing units, down slightly from 670,171 housing 
units in 2010. As of 2013[update], 87 percent of housing units were occupied, 
while 13 percent were vacant, a slight change from 2010 where 89.5 percent 
of units were occupied, or 599,736 and 10.5 percent were vacant, or 70,435.[91][100] 
Of the city's residents, 32 percent reported having no vehicles available 
while 23 percent had two or more vehicles available, as of 2013[update].[100] 
In 2010, 24.9 percent of households reported having children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 28.3 percent were married couples living together 
and 22.5 percent had a female householder with no husband present, 6.0 
percent had a male householder with no wife present, and 43.2 percent were 
non-families. The city reported 34.1 percent of all households were made 
up of individuals while 10.5 percent had someone living alone who was 65 
years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average 
family size was 3.20.[91] In 2013, the percentage of women who gave birth 
in the previous 12 months who were unmarried was 56 percent. Of Philadelphia's 
adults, 31 percent were married or lived as a couple, 55 percent were not 
married, 11 percent were divorced or separated, and 3 percent were widowed.[100] 
According to the Census Bureau, the median household income in 2013 was 
$36,836, down 7.9 percent from 2008 when the median household income was 
$40,008 (in 2013 dollars). For comparison, the median household income 
among metropolitan areas was $60,482, down 8.2 percent in the same period, 
and the national median household income was $55,250, down 7.0 percent 
from 2008.[100] The city's wealth disparity is evident when neighborhoods 
are compared. Residents in Society Hill had a median household income of 
$93,720 while residents in one of North Philadelphia's districts reported 
the lowest median household income, $14,185.[100] During the last decade, 
Philadelphia experienced a large shift in its age profile. In 2000, the 
city's population pyramid had a largely stationary shape. In 2013, the 
city took on an expansive pyramid shape, with an increase in the three 
millennial age groups, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, and 30 to 34. The city's 25- 
to 29-year-old age group was the city's largest age cohort.[100] According 
to the 2010 Census, 343,837 (22.5%) were under the age of 18; 203,697 (13.3%) 
from 18 to 25; 434,385 (28.5%) from 25 to 44; 358,778 (23.5%) from 45 to 
64; and 185,309 (12.1%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age 
was 33.5 years. For every 100 females there were 89.4 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.7 males.[91] The city had 22,018 
births in 2013, down from a peak 23,689 births in 2008. Philadelphia's 
death rate was at its lowest in at least a half-century, 13,691 deaths 
in 2013.[100] Another factor attributing to the population increase is 
Philadelphia's immigration rate. In 2013, 12.7 percent of residents were 
foreign-born, just shy of the national average, 13.1 percent.[100] Irish, 
Italians, Polish, Germans, English, and Greeks are the largest ethnic European 
groups in the city.[96] Philadelphia has the second-largest Irish and Italian 
populations in the United States, after New York City. South Philadelphia 
remains one of the largest Italian neighborhoods in the country and is 
home to the Italian Market. The Pennsport neighborhood and Gray's Ferry 
section of South Philadelphia, home to many Mummer clubs, are well known 
as Irish neighborhoods. The Kensington section, Port Richmond, and Fishtown 
have historically been heavily Irish and Polish. Port Richmond is well 
known in particular as the center of the Polish immigrant and Polish-American 
community in Philadelphia, and it remains a common destination for Polish 
immigrants. Northeast Philadelphia, although known for its Irish and Irish-American 
population, is also home to a large Jewish and Russian population. Mount 
Airy in Northwest Philadelphia also contains a large Jewish community, 
while nearby Chestnut Hill is historically known as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant 
stronghold. There has also been an increase of yuppie, bohemian, and hipster 
types particularly around Center City, the neighborhood of Northern Liberties, 
and in the neighborhoods around the city's universities, such as near Temple 
in North Philadelphia and particularly near Drexel and University of Pennsylvania 
in West Philadelphia. Philadelphia is also home to a significant gay and 
lesbian population. Philadelphia's Gayborhood, which is located near Washington 
Square, is home to a large concentration of gay and lesbian friendly businesses, 
restaurants, and bars.[103] The Black American population in Philadelphia 
is the third-largest in the country, after New York City and Chicago. Historically, 
West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia were largely black neighborhoods, 
but many are leaving these areas in favor of the Northeast and Southwest 
sections of Philadelphia. There is a higher proportion of Muslims in the 
Black American population than most cities in America. West Philadelphia 
also has significant Caribbean and African immigrant populations.[104] 
The Puerto Rican population in Philadelphia is the second-largest after 
New York City, and the second fastest-growing after Orlando.[96][105] There 
are large Puerto Rican and Dominican populations in North Philadelphia 
and the Northeast, as well as a significant Mexican population in South 
Philadelphia.[106] Philadelphia has significant Asian populations mainly 
hailing from countries like India, China, Vietnam, and South Korea. Chinatown 
and the Northeast have the largest Asian presences, with a large Korean 
community in Olney, Philadelphia. South Philadelphia is also home to large 
Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Chinese communities. It has the fifth largest 
Muslim population among American cities.[107] As of 2010[update], 79.12% 
(1,112,441) of Philadelphia residents age 5 and older spoke English at 
home as a primary language, while 9.72% (136,688) spoke Spanish, 1.64% 
(23,075) Chinese, 0.89% (12,499) Vietnamese, 0.77% (10,885) Russian, 0.66% 
(9,240) French, 0.61% (8,639) other Asian languages, 0.58% (8,217) African 
languages, 0.56% (7,933) Cambodian (Mon-Khmer), and Italian was spoken 
as a main language by 0.55% (7,773) of the population over the age of five. 
In total, 20.88% (293,544) of Philadelphia's population age 5 and older 
spoke a mother language other than English.[108] Philadelphia is the center 
of economic activity in Pennsylvania with the headquarters of seven Fortune 
1000 companies located within city limits. According to the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis, the Philadelphia area had a total gross metropolitan product 
of $347 billion in 2010, the seventh-largest metropolitan economy in the 
United States.[110] Philadelphia was rated by the GaWC5 as an 'Alpha- City' 
in its categorization of world cities.[111] Philadelphia's economic sectors 
include information technology, manufacturing, oil refining, food processing, 
health care, biotechnology, tourism, and financial services. Financial 
activities account for the largest sector of the metropolitan area's economy, 
and it is one of the largest health education and research centers in the 
United States. The city is home to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and 
some of the area's largest companies including cable television and internet 
provider Comcast, insurance companies Colonial Penn, CIGNA, Independence 
Blue Cross, energy company Sunoco, food services company Aramark and Crown, 
chemical makers Rohm and Haas and FMC, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, 
Boeing Rotorcraft Systems, and automotive parts retailer Pep Boys. Philadelphia's 
an annualized unemployment rate was 7.8% in 2014, down from 10.0%the previous 
year.[100] This is higher than the national average of 6.2%. Similarly, 
the rate of new jobs added to the city's economy lagged behind the national 
job growth. In 2014, about 8,800 jobs were added to the city's economy. 
Sectors with the largest number of jobs added were in education and health 
services, leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services. 
Declines were seen in the city's manufacturing and government sectors.[100] 
While about 31.9% of the city's population is not in the labor force, the 
city's largest employers are the federal and city governments, respectively. 
Philadelphia's largest private employer is the University of Pennsylvania 
followed by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[100] A study commissioned 
by the city's government projected 40,000 jobs to be added to the city 
by 2035, raising the city's 2010 number of jobs from 675,000 total to an 
estimated 715,000 jobs.[88] Philadelphia's history attracts many tourists, 
with the Independence National Historical Park (which includes the Liberty 
Bell, Independence Hall, and other historical sites) receiving over 3.6 
million visitors in 2014.[112] The Greater Philadelphia region was visited 
by 39 million people in 2013 generating $10 billion in economic impact.[19] 
Philadelphia is home to many national historical sites that relate to the 
founding of the United States. Independence National Historical Park is 
the center of these historical landmarks being one of the country's 22 
UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Independence Hall, where the Declaration of 
Independence was signed, and the Liberty Bell are the city's most famous 
attractions. Other historic sites include homes for Edgar Allan Poe, Betsy 
Ross, and Thaddeus Kosciuszko, early government buildings like the First 
and Second Banks of the United States, Fort Mifflin, and the Gloria Dei 
(Old Swedes') Church.[113] Philadelphia alone has 67 National Historic 
Landmarks, the third most of any city in the country.[114] Philadelphia's 
major science museums include the Franklin Institute, which contains the 
Benjamin Franklin National Memorial; the Academy of Natural Sciences; the 
Mütter Museum; and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology 
and Anthropology. History museums include the National Constitution Center, 
the Atwater Kent Museum of Philadelphia History, the National Museum of 
American Jewish History, the African American Museum in Philadelphia, the 
Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted 
Masons in the state of Pennsylvania and The Masonic Library and Museum 
of Pennsylvania and Eastern State Penitentiary. Philadelphia is home to 
the United States' first zoo[115] and hospital,[116] as well as Fairmount 
Park, one of America's oldest and largest urban parks.[117] The city is 
home to important archival repositories, including the Library Company 
of Philadelphia, established in 1731, and the Athenaeum of Philadelphia, 
founded in 1814. The Presbyterian Historical Society, the country's oldest 
continuous denominational historical society, is also located there. The 
Philadelphia dialect, which is spread throughout the Delaware Valley and 
South Jersey, is part of Mid-Atlantic American English, and as such it 
is identical in many ways to the Baltimore dialect. Unlike the Baltimore 
dialect, however, the Philadelphia accent also shares many similarities 
with the New York accent. Thanks to over a century of linguistics data 
collected by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia 
dialect under sociolinguist William Labov has been one of the best-studied 
forms of American English.[118][119][f] The city contains many art museums, 
such as the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Rodin Museum, 
which holds the largest collection of work by Auguste Rodin outside France. 
The city's major art museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is one of 
the largest art museums in the United States. Its long flight of steps 
to the main entrance became famous after the film Rocky (1976).[120] The 
city is home to the Philadelphia Sketch Club, one of the country's oldest 
artists' clubs, and The Plastic Club, started by women excluded from the 
Sketch Club. It has a profusion of art galleries, many of which participate 
in the First Friday event. The first Friday of every month, galleries in 
Old City are open late. Annual events include film festivals and parades, 
the most famous being the New Year's Day Mummers Parade. Areas such as 
South Street and Old City have a vibrant night life. The Avenue of the 
Arts in Center City contains many restaurants and theaters, such as the 
Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, which is home to the Philadelphia 
Orchestra, generally considered one of the top five orchestras in the United 
States, and the Academy of Music, the nation's oldest continually operating 
opera house, home to the Opera Company of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania 
Ballet.[120] The Wilma Theatre and Philadelphia Theatre Company have new 
buildings constructed in the last decade on the avenue. They produce a 
variety of new works. Several blocks to the east are the Walnut Street 
Theatre, America's oldest theatre and the largest subscription theater 
in the world; as well as the Lantern Theatre at St. Stephens Church, one 
of a number of smaller venues. Philadelphia has more public art than any 
other American city.[122] In 1872, the Association for Public Art (formerly 
the Fairmount Park Art Association) was created, the first private association 
in the United States dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning.[123] 
In 1959, lobbying by the Artists Equity Association helped create the Percent 
for Art ordinance, the first for a U.S. city.[124] The program, which has 
funded more than 200 pieces of public art, is administered by the Philadelphia 
Office of Arts and Culture, the city's art agency.[125] Philadelphia has 
more murals than any other U.S. city, thanks in part to the 1984 creation 
of the Department of Recreation's Mural Arts Program, which seeks to beautify 
neighborhoods and provide an outlet for graffiti artists. The program has 
funded more than 2,800 murals by professional, staff and volunteer artists 
and educated more than 20,000 youth in underserved neighborhoods throughout 
Philadelphia.[126] Philadelphia artists have had a prominent national role 
in popular music. In the 1970s, Philadelphia soul influenced the music 
of that and later eras. On July 13, 1985, Philadelphia hosted the American 
end of the Live Aid concert at John F. Kennedy Stadium. The city reprised 
this role for the Live 8 concert, bringing some 700,000 people to the Ben 
Franklin Parkway on July 2, 2005.[127] Philadelphia is home to the world-renowned 
Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale, which has performed its music all over 
the world. Dr. Robert G. Hamilton, founder of the choir, is a notable native 
Philadelphian. The Philly Pops is another famous Philadelphia music group. 
The city has played a major role in the development and support of American 
rock music and rap music. Hip-hop/Rap artists such as The Roots, DJ Jazzy 
Jeff & The Fresh Prince, The Goats, Freeway, Schoolly D, Eve, and Lisa 
"Left Eye" Lopes hail from the city. The city is known for its hoagies, 
scrapple, soft pretzels, water ice, Irish potato candy, Tastykake, and 
is home to the cheesesteak, developed by German and Italian immigrants. 
Philadelphia boasts a number of cheesesteak establishments, however two 
locations in South Philadelphia are perhaps the most famous among tourists: 
Pat's King of Steaks and its across the street rival Geno's Steaks. Its 
high-end restaurants include Morimoto, Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto's first 
restaurant, Vetri, famous on the East Coast for its take on Northern Italian 
cuisine, and Lacroix, a staple restaurant situated in Rittenhouse Square. 
Italian specialties have been supplemented by many new Vietnamese and other 
Asian restaurants, both budget and high-end. McGillin's Olde Ale House, 
located on Drury Street in Center City, is the oldest continuously operated 
tavern in the city.[128] Philadelphia is also home to a landmark eatery 
founded in 1892, the Reading Terminal Market. The enclosed public market 
hosts over a hundred merchants offering Pennsylvania Dutch specialties, 
artisan cheese and meat, locally grown groceries, and specialty and ethnic 
foods.[129] Philadelphia has decriminalized small amounts of marijuana 
in the city, reducing penalties for possession and public use to minor 
fines and community service. The move makes Philadelphia the largest city 
in the United States to decriminalize pot.[130] Philadelphia's professional 
sports teams date at least to the 1860 founding of baseball's Athletics. 
The city is one of 12 U.S. cities to have all four major sports: the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the National League of Major League Baseball, the Philadelphia 
Eagles of the National Football League, the Philadelphia Flyers of the 
National Hockey League, and the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball 
Association. The Philadelphia metro area is also home of the Philadelphia 
Union of Major League Soccer. The Union play their home games at Talen 
Energy Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium in Chester, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia 
began play in MLS in 2010, after beating several other cities in competition 
for the rights to an MLS expansion franchise. The city's professional teams 
went without a championship from 1983, when the 76ers won the NBA Championship, 
until 2008, when the Phillies won the World Series. In 2004, ESPN ranked 
Philadelphia second on its list of The Fifteen Most Tortured Sports Cities.[131] 
The failure was sometimes attributed in jest to the "Curse of Billy Penn." 
The sports fans of Philadelphia are known for being referred to as the 
"Meanest Fans in America".[132] Major-sport professional sports teams that 
originated in Philadelphia but ultimately moved to other cities include 
the Golden State Warriors basketball team and the Oakland Athletics baseball 
team. Philadelphia is also the home city of the Philadelphia Spinners, 
a professional ultimate team that is part of the Major League Ultimate. 
They are one of the original eight teams of the American Ultimate Disc 
League that began in April 2012. They played at Franklin Field and won 
the inaugural AUDL championship. As of 2013[update], the Spinners play 
in the newer MLU at various stadiums through the city and surrounding southern 
suburbs. Rowing has been popular in Philadelphia since the 18th century.[133] 
Boathouse Row is a symbol of Philadelphia's rich rowing history, and each 
Big Five member has its own boathouse.[134] Philadelphia hosts numerous 
local and collegiate rowing clubs and competitions, including the annual 
Dad Vail Regatta, the largest intercollegiate rowing event in the U.S, 
the Stotesbury Cup Regatta, and the Head of the Schuylkill Regatta, all 
of which are held on the Schuylkill River.[135][136][137] The regattas 
are hosted and organized by the Schuylkill Navy, an association of area 
rowing clubs that has produced numerous Olympic rowers.[138] Philadelphia 
is home to professional, semi-professional and elite amateur teams in cricket, 
rugby league (Philadelphia Fight), rugby union and other sports. Major 
sporting events in the city include the Penn Relays, Philadelphia Marathon, 
Broad Street Run, and the Philadelphia International Championship bicycle 
race. The Collegiate Rugby Championship is played every June at Talen Energy 
Stadium; the CRC is broadcast live on NBC and regularly draws attendances 
of 18,000. Philadelphia is home to the Philadelphia Big 5, a group of five 
Division I college basketball programs. The Big 5 are Saint Joseph's University, 
University of Pennsylvania, La Salle University, Temple University, and 
Villanova University. The sixth NCAA Division I school in Philadelphia 
is Drexel University. At least one of the teams is competitive nearly every 
year[vague] and at least one team has made the NCAA tournament for the 
past four decades.[which?] The city of Philadelphia have placed four bids 
for the Olympics in 1920, 1948, 1952, 1956. Losing all and having pulled 
there bids another three times for the 2004, 2016 and 2024 games. On 22 
April 2013, Mayor Michael Nutter's office declared Philadelphia's interest 
in bidding for the 2024 Games. The city had expressed interest in hosting 
the 2016 Games, but lost out to Chicago as the USOC's bid city.[140] The 
City of Philadelphia withdrew from consideration on 28 May 2014 in a letter 
to the USOC, citing "timing" as a major factor in the decision. The city 
reiterated a continued interest in pursuing the games in the future. On 
28 May 2014, Mayor Michael Nutter announced that he had written to the 
USOC earlier that month, informing it of the city's decision not to pursue 
a bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.[141] The total parkland amounts 
to about 10,334 acres (41.82 km2).[142] Philadelphia's largest park, Fairmount 
Park, encompasses 9,200 acres (37 km2) of this parkland and includes 63 
neighborhood and regional parks.[143] The largest tract of Fairmount Park 
is on the west side of the city along the Schuylkill River and Wissahickon 
Creek and includes the Philadelphia Zoo. The total expenditures of the 
park in 2005 were $164 million. Fairmount Park is the world's largest landscaped 
urban park.[21] From a governmental perspective, Philadelphia County is 
a legal nullity, as all county functions were assumed by the city in 1952, 
which has been coterminous with the county since 1854. Philadelphia's 1952 
Home Rule Charter was written by the City Charter Commission, which was 
created by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in an Act of April 21, 1949, 
and a city ordinance of June 15, 1949. The existing City Council received 
a proposed draft on February 14, 1951, and the electors approved it in 
an election held April 17, 1951.[144] The first elections under the new 
Home Rule Charter were held in November 1951, and the newly elected officials 
took office in January 1952.[145] The city uses the strong-mayor version 
of the mayor-council form of government, which is headed by one mayor, 
in whom executive authority is vested. Elected at-large, the mayor is limited 
to two consecutive four-year terms under the city's home rule charter, 
but can run for the position again after an intervening term. The Mayor 
is Jim Kenney, who replaced Michael Nutter, who served two terms from 2009 
to January 2016. Kenney, as all Philadelphia mayors have been since 1952, 
is a member of the Democratic Party, which tends to dominate local politics 
so thoroughly that the Democratic Mayoral primary is often more widely 
covered than the general election. The legislative branch, the Philadelphia 
City Council, consists of ten council members representing individual districts 
and seven members elected at large. Democrats currently hold 14 seats, 
with Republicans representing two allotted at-large seats for the minority 
party, as well as the Northeast-based Tenth District. The current council 
president is Darrell Clarke. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas 
(First Judicial District) is the trial court of general jurisdiction for 
Philadelphia, hearing felony-level criminal cases and civil suits above 
the minimum jurisdictional limit of $7000 (excepting small claims cases 
valued between $7000 and $12000 and landlord-tenant issues heard in the 
Municipal Court) under its original jurisdiction; it also has appellate 
jurisdiction over rulings from the Municipal and Traffic Courts and over 
decisions of certain Pennsylvania state agencies (e.g. the Pennsylvania 
Liquor Control Board). It has 90 legally trained judges elected by the 
voters. It is funded and operated largely by city resources and employees.[146] 
The current District Attorney is Seth Williams, a Democrat. The last Republican 
to hold the office is Ron Castille, who left in 1991 and is currently the 
Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The Philadelphia Municipal 
Court handles matters of limited jurisdiction as well as landlord-tenant 
disputes, appeals from traffic court, preliminary hearings for felony-level 
offenses, and misdemeanor criminal trials. It has 25 legally trained judges 
elected by the voters.[147] Philadelphia Traffic Court is a court of special 
jurisdiction that hears violations of traffic laws. It has seven judges 
elected by the voters.[148] As with magisterial district judges, the judges 
need not be lawyers, but must complete the certifying course and pass the 
qualifying examination administered by the Minor Judiciary Education Board.[149] 
Pennsylvania's three appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. 
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the court of last resort in the state, 
regularly hears arguments in Philadelphia City Hall. Also, the Superior 
Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania sit in 
Philadelphia several times a year. Judges for these courts are elected 
at large. Each court has a prothonotary's office in Philadelphia as well. 
Additionally, Philadelphia is home to the federal United States District 
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Court of Appeals 
for the Third Circuit, both of which are housed in the James A. Byrne United 
States Courthouse. As of December 31, 2009, there were 1,057,038 registered 
voters in Philadelphia.[150] Registered voters constitute 68.3% of the 
total population.[151] From the American Civil War until the mid-20th century, 
Philadelphia was a bastion of the Republican Party, which arose from the 
staunch pro-Northern views of Philadelphia residents during and after the 
war (Philadelphia was chosen as the host city for the first Republican 
National Convention in 1856). After the Great Depression, Democratic registrations 
increased, but the city was not carried by Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt 
in his landslide victory of 1932 (in which Pennsylvania was one of the 
few states won by Republican Herbert Hoover). Four years later, however, 
voter turnout surged and the city finally flipped to the Democrats. Roosevelt 
carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote in 1936. The city has remained 
loyally Democratic in every presidential election since. It is now one 
of the most Democratic in the country; in 2008, Democrat Barack Obama drew 
83% of the city's vote. Obama's win was even greater in 2012, capturing 
85% of the vote. Philadelphia once comprised six congressional districts. 
However, as a result of the city's declining population, it now has only 
four: the 1st district, represented by Bob Brady; the 2nd, represented 
by Chaka Fattah; the 8th, represented by Mike Fitzpatrick; and the 13th, 
represented by Brendan Boyle. All but Fitzpatrick are Democrats. Although 
they are usually swamped by Democrats in city, state and national elections, 
Republicans still have some support in the area, primarily in the northeast. 
A Republican represented a significant portion of Philadelphia in the House 
as late as 1983, and Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican 
nominee in both 1999 and 2003. Pennsylvania's longest-serving Senator,[152] 
Arlen Specter, was from Philadelphia; he served as a Republican from 1981 
and as a Democrat from 2009, losing that party's primary in 2010 and leaving 
office in January 2011. He was also the city's District Attorney from 1966 
to 1974. Philadelphia has hosted various national conventions, including 
in 1848 (Whig), 1856 (Republican), 1872 (Republican), 1900 (Republican), 
1936 (Democratic), 1940 (Republican), 1948 (Republican), 1948 (Progressive), 
2000 (Republican), and 2016 (Democratic).[153] Philadelphia has been home 
to one Vice President, George M. Dallas, and one Civil War general who 
won his party's nomination for president but lost in the general election: 
George B. McClellan. Like many American cities, Philadelphia saw a gradual 
yet pronounced rise in crime in the years following World War II. There 
were 525 murders in 1990, a rate of 31.5 per 100,000. There were an average 
of about 600 murders a year for most of the 1990s. The murder count dropped 
in 2002 to 288, then rose four years later to 406 in 2006 and 392 in 2007.[154] 
A few years later, Philadelphia began to see a rapid drop in homicides 
and violent crime. In 2013, there were 246 murders, which is a decrease 
of over 25% from the previous year, and a decrease of over 44% since 2007.[155] 
And in 2014, there were 248 homicides, up by one since 2013.[100] In 2006, 
Philadelphia's homicide rate of 27.7 per 100,000 people was the highest 
of the country's 10 most populous cities.[156] In 2012, Philadelphia had 
the fourth-highest homicide rate among the country's most populous cities. 
And in 2014, the rate dropped to 16.0 homicides per 100,000 residents placing 
Philadelphia as the sixth-highest city in the country.[100] In 2004, there 
were 7,513.5 crimes per 200,000 people in Philadelphia.[157] Among its 
neighboring Mid-Atlantic cities in the same population group, Baltimore 
and Washington, D.C. were ranked second- and third-most dangerous cities 
in the United States, respectively.[158] Camden, New Jersey, a city across 
the Delaware River from Philadelphia, was ranked as the most dangerous 
city in the United States.[158] The number of shootings in the city has 
declined significantly in the last 10 years. Shooting incidents peaked 
in 2006 when 1,857 shootings were recorded. That number has dropped 44 
percent to 1,047 shootings in 2014.[100] Similarly, major crimes in the 
city has decreased gradually in the last ten years since its peak in 2006 
when 85,498 major crimes were reported. In the past three years, the number 
of reported major crimes fell 11 percent to a total of 68,815. Violent 
crimes, which include homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, 
decreased 14 percent in the past three years with a reported 15,771 occurrences 
in 2014.[100] Based on the rate of violent crimes per 1,000 residents in 
American cities with 25,000 people or more, Philadelphia was ranked as 
the 54th most dangerous city in 2015.[159] Education in Philadelphia is 
provided by many private and public institutions. The School District of 
Philadelphia runs the city's public schools. The Philadelphia School District 
is the eighth largest school district in the United States[160] with 142,266 
students in 218 public schools and 86 charter schools as of 2014[update].[161] 
The city's K-12 enrollment in district run schools has dropped in the last 
five years from 156,211 students in 2010 to 130,104 students in 2015. During 
the same time period, the enrollment in charter schools has increased from 
33,995 students in 2010 to 62,358 students in 2015.[100] This consistent 
drop in enrollment has led the city to close 24 of its public schools in 
2013.[162] During the 2014 school year, the city spent an average of $12,570 
per pupil, below the average among comparable urban school districts.[100] 
Graduation rates among district-run schools, meanwhile, have steadily increased 
in the last ten years. In 2005, Philadelphia had a district graduation 
rate of 52%. This number has increased to 65% in 2014, still below the 
national and state averages. Scores on the state's standardized test, the 
Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) have trended upward from 
2005 to 2011 but have decreased since. In 2005, the district-run schools 
scored an average of 37.4% on math and 35.5% on reading. The city's schools 
reached its peak scores in 2011 with 59.0% on math and 52.3% on reading. 
In 2014, the scores dropped significantly to 45.2% on math and 42.0% on 
reading.[100] Of the city's public high schools, including charter schools, 
only four performed above the national average on the SAT (1497[163]) in 
2014: Masterman, Central, Girard, and MaST Community Charter School. All 
other district-run schools were below average.[100] Philadelphia has the 
third-largest student concentration on the East Coast, with over 120,000 
college and university students enrolled within the city and nearly 300,000 
in the metropolitan area.[164] There are over 80 colleges, universities, 
trade, and specialty schools in the Philadelphia region. One of the founding 
members of the Association of American Universities is in city, the University 
of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League institution with claims to being the oldest 
university in the country.[165] The city's largest private school by number 
of students is Temple University, followed by Drexel University.[166] Along 
with the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University and Drexel University 
make up the city's major research universities. The city is also home to 
five schools of medicine: Drexel University College of Medicine, Perelman 
School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia College 
of Osteopathic Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, and the 
Thomas Jefferson University. Hospitals, universities, and higher education 
research institutions in Philadelphia's four congressional districts received 
more than $252 million in National Institutes of Health grants in 2015.[167] 
Other institutions of higher learning within the city's borders include: 
Philadelphia's two major daily newspapers are The Philadelphia Inquirer, 
which is the eighteenth largest newspaper[168] and third-oldest surviving 
daily newspaper in the country,[169] and the Philadelphia Daily News. Both 
newspapers were purchased from The McClatchy Company (after buying out 
Knight Ridder) in 2006 by Philadelphia Media Holdings and operated by the 
group until the organization declared bankruptcy in 2010.[170] After two 
years of financial struggle, the two newspapers were sold to Interstate 
General Media in 2012.[170] The two newspapers have a combined circulation 
of about 500,000 readers.[168] The city also has a number of other, smaller 
newspapers and magazine in circulation such as the Philadelphia Tribune, 
which serves the African-American community, the Philadelphia, a monthly 
regional magazine; Philadelphia Weekly, a weekly-printed alternative newspaper; 
Philadelphia City Paper another weekly-printed newspaper; Philadelphia 
Gay News, which services the LGBT community; The Jewish Exponent a weekly-printed 
newspaper servicing the Jewish community; Philadelphia Metro, free daily 
newspaper; and Al Día, a weekly newspaper servicing the Latino community. 
In addition, there are several student-run newspapers including The Daily 
Pennsylvanian, The Temple News, and The Triangle. The first experimental 
radio license was issued in Philadelphia in August 1912 to St. Joseph's 
College. The first commercial broadcasting radio stations appeared in 1922: 
first WIP, then owned by Gimbel's department store, on March 17, followed 
the same year by WFIL, WOO, WCAU and WDAS.[171] The highest-rated stations 
in Philadelphia include soft rock WBEB, KYW Newsradio, and urban adult 
contemporary WDAS-FM. Philadelphia is served by three major non-commercial 
public radio stations, WHYY-FM (NPR), WRTI (jazz, classical), and WXPN-FM 
(adult alternative music), as well as several smaller stations. Rock stations 
WMMR and WYSP had historically been intense rivals. However, in 2011, WYSP 
switched to sports talk as WIP-FM, which broadcasts all Philadelphia Eagles 
games. WMMR's The Preston and Steve Show has been the area's top-rated 
morning show since Howard Stern left broadcast radio for satellite-based 
Sirius Radio.[citation needed] Four urban stations (WUSL ("Power 99"), 
WPHI ("Hot 107.9"), WDAS and WRNB ("Old School 100.3")) are popular choices 
on the FM dial. WBEB is the city's Adult Contemporary station, while WZMP 
("Wired 96.5") is the major Rhythmic Top 40 station.[citation needed] In 
the 1930s, the experimental station W3XE, owned by Philco, became the first 
television station in Philadelphia; it became NBC's first affiliate in 
1939, and later became KYW-TV (CBS). WCAU-TV, WPVI-TV, WHYY-TV, WPHL-TV, 
and WTXF-TV had all been founded by the 1970s.[171] In 1952, WFIL (now 
WPVI) premiered the television show Bandstand, which later became the nationally 
broadcast American Bandstand hosted by Dick Clark.[172] Today, as in many 
large metropolitan areas, each of the commercial networks has an affiliate, 
and call letters have been replaced by corporate IDs: CBS3, 6ABC, NBC10, 
Fox29, Telefutura28, Telemundo62, Univision65, plus My PHL 17 and CW Philly 
57. The region is served also by public broadcasting stations WYBE-TV (Philadelphia), 
WHYY-TV (Wilmington, Delaware and Philadelphia), WLVT-TV (Lehigh Valley), 
and NJTV (New Jersey). In September 2007, Philadelphia approved a Public-access 
television cable TV channel. Until September 2014, Philadelphia was the 
only media market in the United States with owned-and-operated stations 
of all five English-language major broadcast networks (NBC – WCAU, CBS 
– KYW-TV, ABC – WPVI-TV, Fox – WTXF-TV and The CW – WPSG); three of the 
major Spanish-language networks (Univision, UniMas and Telemundo) also 
have O&Os serving the market (respectively, WUVP-DT, WFPA-CD and WWSI). 
The city is also the nation's fourth-largest consumer in media market, 
as ranked by the Nielsen Media Research, with over 2.9 million TV homes.[173] 
Philadelphia is served by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation 
Authority (SEPTA), which operates buses, trains, rapid transit, trolleys, 
and trackless trolleys throughout Philadelphia, the four Pennsylvania suburban 
counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery, in addition to service 
to Mercer County, New Jersey and New Castle County, Delaware. The city's 
subway, opened in 1907, is the third-oldest in America. In 1981, large 
sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia 
were discontinued due to lack of funding. Several projects have been proposed 
to extend rail service back to these areas, but lack of funding has again 
been the chief obstacle to implementation. These projects include the proposed 
Schuylkill Valley Metro to Wyomissing, PA, and extension of the Media/Elwyn 
line back to Wawa, PA. SEPTA's Airport Regional Rail Line Regional Rail 
offers direct service to the Philadelphia International Airport. Philadelphia's 
30th Street Station is a major railroad station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, 
which offers access to Amtrak, SEPTA, and NJ Transit lines. The PATCO Speedline 
provides rapid transit service to Camden, Collingswood, Westmont, Haddonfield, 
Woodcrest (Cherry Hill), Ashland (Voorhees), and Lindenwold, New Jersey, 
from stations on Locust Street between 16th and 15th, 13th and 12th, and 
10th and 9th Streets, and on Market Street at 8th Street. Two airports 
serve Philadelphia: the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), straddling 
the southern boundary of the city, and the Northeast Philadelphia Airport 
(PNE), a general aviation reliever airport in Northeast Philadelphia. Philadelphia 
International Airport provides scheduled domestic and international air 
service, while Northeast Philadelphia Airport serves general and corporate 
aviation. In 2013, Philadelphia International Airport was the 15th busiest 
airport in the world measured by traffic movements (i.e. takeoffs and landings).[174] 
It is also the second largest hub and primary international hub for American 
Airlines.[175] William Penn initially planned a Philadelphia that had numbered 
streets traversing north and south and "tree" named streets traversing 
east and west, with the two main streets Broad Street and High Street converging 
at Centre Square. The plans have since expanded to include major highways 
that span other major sections of Philadelphia. Interstate 95 runs through 
the city along the Delaware River as a main north-south artery known as 
the Delaware Expressway. The city is also served by the Schuylkill Expressway, 
a portion of Interstate 76 that runs along the Schuylkill River. It meets 
the Pennsylvania Turnpike at King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, providing access 
to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and points west. Interstate 676, the Vine Street 
Expressway, was completed in 1991 after years of planning. A link between 
I-95 and I-76, it runs below street level through Center City, connecting 
to the Ben Franklin Bridge at its eastern end. Roosevelt Boulevard and 
the Roosevelt Expressway (U.S. 1) connect Northeast Philadelphia with Center 
City. Woodhaven Road (Route 63), built in 1966, and Cottman Avenue (Route 
73) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia, running between 
Interstate 95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard (U.S. 1). The Fort Washington 
Expressway (Route 309) extends north from the city's northern border, serving 
Montgomery County and Bucks County. U.S. 30, extending east-west from West 
Philadelphia to Lancaster, is known as Lancaster Avenue throughout most 
of the city and through the adjacent Main Line suburbs. Interstate 476, 
commonly nicknamed the "Blue Route" through Delaware County, bypasses the 
city to the west, serving the city's western suburbs, as well as providing 
a link to Allentown and points north. Similarly, Interstate 276, the Pennsylvania 
Turnpike's Delaware River Extension, acts as a bypass and commuter route 
to the north of the city as well as a link to the New Jersey Turnpike to 
New York. However, other planned freeways have been canceled, such as an 
Interstate 695 running southwest from downtown; two freeways connecting 
Interstate 95 to Interstate 76 that would have replaced Girard Avenue and 
South Street; and a freeway upgrade of Roosevelt Boulevard. The Delaware 
River Port Authority operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across 
the Delaware River to New Jersey: the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Benjamin 
Franklin Bridge (I-676 and US 30), the Betsy Ross Bridge (Route 90), and 
the Commodore Barry Bridge (US 322). The Tacony-Palmyra Bridge connects 
PA Route 73 in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia with New Jersey's 
Route 73 in Palmyra, Camden County, and is maintained by the Burlington 
County Bridge Commission. Philadelphia is also a major hub for Greyhound 
Lines, which operates 24-hour service to points east of the Mississippi 
River. Most of Greyhound's services in Philadelphia operate to/from the 
Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal, located at 1001 Filbert Street in Center 
City Philadelphia. In 2006, the Philadelphia Greyhound Terminal was the 
second busiest Greyhound terminal in the United States, after the Port 
Authority Bus Terminal in New York. Besides Greyhound, six other bus operators 
provide service to the Center City Greyhound terminal: Bieber Tourways, 
Capitol Trailways, Martz Trailways, Peter Pan Bus Lines, Susquehanna Trailways, 
and the bus division for New Jersey Transit. Other services include Megabus 
and Bolt Bus. Since the early days of rail transport in the United States, 
Philadelphia has served as hub for several major rail companies, particularly 
the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad 
first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban 
Station, and the Reading Railroad operated out of Reading Terminal, now 
part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated 
competing commuter rail systems in the area, known collectively as the 
Regional Rail system. The two systems today, for the most part still intact 
but now connected, operate as a single system under the control of the 
SEPTA, the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline 
subway system and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line operate successor services 
to southern New Jersey.[176] Philadelphia, once home to more than 4,000 
trolleys on 65 lines,[177] is one of the few North American cities to maintain 
streetcar lines. Today, SEPTA operates five "subway-surface" trolleys that 
run on street-level tracks in West Philadelphia and subway tunnels in Center 
City. SEPTA also recently[when?] reintroduced trolley service to the Girard 
Avenue Line, Route 15. Today, Philadelphia is a regional hub of the federally 
owned Amtrak system, with 30th Street Station being a primary stop on the 
Washington-Boston Northeast Corridor and the Keystone Corridor to Harrisburg 
and Pittsburgh. 30th Street also serves as a major station for services 
via the Pennsylvania Railroad's former Pennsylvania Main Line to Chicago. 
30th Street is Amtrak's third-busiest station in numbers of passengers 
as of fiscal year 2013.[178] A 2015 study by Walk Score ranked Philadelphia 
the fourth most walkable major city in the United States.[179] Historically, 
Philadelphia sourced its water by the Fairmount Water Works, the nation's 
first major urban water supply system. In 1909, Water Works was decommissioned 
as the city transitioned to modern sand filtration methods.[180] Today, 
the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) provides drinking water, wastewater 
collection, and stormwater services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding 
counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the Delaware 
River and the balance from the Schuylkill River.[181] The public wastewater 
system consists of three water pollution control plants, 21 pumping stations, 
and about 3,657 miles of sewers.[181] A 2007 investigation by the Environmental 
Protection Agency found elevated levels of Iodine-131 in the city's potable 
water.[182][183] In 2012, the EPA's readings discovered that the city had 
the highest readings of I-131 in the nation. The city campaigned against 
an Associated Press report that the high levels of I-131 were the results 
of local gas drilling in the Upper Delaware River.[184] PECO Energy Company, 
founded as the Philadelphia Electric Company in 1881,[185] provides electricity 
to over 1.6 million customers in the southeastern Pennsylvania.[186] The 
company has over 500 power substations and 29,000 miles of distribution 
of transmission lines in its service making it the largest combination 
utility in the state. Philadelphia Gas Works (PGW), overseen by the Pennsylvania 
Public Utility Commission, is the nation's largest municipally owned natural 
gas utility. It serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the Philadelphia 
area.[187] Founded in 1836, the company came under city ownership in 1987 
and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits. 
In 2014, the Philadelphia City Council refused to conduct hearings on a 
$1.86 billion sale of PGW, part of a two-year effort that was proposed 
by the mayor. The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its 
offer.[188][189] Southeastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code 
in 1947 when the North American Numbering Plan of the "Bell System" went 
into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in 
half in 1994 when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern 
suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service 
area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 
to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas (area code 445 
to 215, area code 835 to 610) was delayed and later rescinded.[190] An 
effort was approved on 2005 to provide low-cost, citywide Wi-Fi service 
to the city. Wireless Philadelphia would have been the first municipal 
internet utility offering in a large US city, but the plan was abandoned 
in 2008 as EarthLink pushed back the completion date several times. Mayor 
Nutter's administration closed the project in 2009 after an attempt to 
revitalize it failed.[191] Philadelphia has eight official sister cities, 
as designated by the Citizen Diplomacy International – Philadelphia:[192] 
Philadelphia also has three partnership cities or regions:[192] Philadelphia 
has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. Dedicated in June 1976, the 
Sister Cities Plaza, a site of 0.5 acres (2,000 m2) located at 18th and 
Benjamin Franklin Parkway, honors Philadelphia's relationships with Tel 
Aviv and Florence which were its first sister cities. Another landmark, 
the Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with Toruń, Poland, 
was constructed in 1976, west of the United Way building at 18th Street 
and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. In addition, the Triangle contains the 
Copernicus monument. Renovations were made to Sister Cities Park in mid-2011 
and on May 10, 2012, SCP was reopened and currently features an interactive 
fountain honoring Philadelphia's ten sister and friendship cities, a café 
and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, 
as well as pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards.[204] The 
Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of Tianjin, stands 
astride the intersection of 10th and Arch Streets as an elaborate and colorful 
symbol of the sister city relationship. The CDI of Philadelphia has participated 
in the U.S. Department of State's "Partners for Peace" project with Mosul, 
Iraq,[205] as well as accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other 
countries.[206] National Constitution Center Carpenters' Hall Congress
