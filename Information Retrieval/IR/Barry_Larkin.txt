Barry Louis Larkin (born April 28, 1964) is a retired Major League Baseball 
(MLB) player. Larkin played shortstop for the Cincinnati Reds from 1986 
to 2004 and was one of the pivotal players on the 1990 Reds' World Series 
championship team. Larkin was elected to the National Baseball Hall of 
Fame in January 2012 and was inducted on July 22, 2012.[1] Born and raised 
in Cincinnati, Larkin attended the University of Michigan, where he played 
college baseball. He briefly played in the minor leagues before making 
his MLB debut in 1986. He quickly won the starting shortstop role for the 
Reds and enjoyed a long run of strong seasons with the team. Larkin struggled 
with a string of injuries between 1997 and 2003, limiting his playing time 
in several seasons. Larkin retired after the 2004 season and worked in 
a front office position for the Washington Nationals for several years 
until he joined ESPN as a baseball analyst. He served as a coach for the 
American team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and managed the Brazilian 
national team in the qualifiers for the same event in 2013. Larkin is considered 
one of the top players of his era, winning nine Silver Slugger awards and 
three Gold Glove awards. He was selected to the Major League All-Star Game 
twelve times, and was elected the 1995 National League Most Valuable Player.[2] 
Larkin attended elementary school at St. John's the Evangelist in Deer 
Park, Cincinnati. His high school was Archbishop Moeller High School, also 
in Cincinnati.[3] Larkin accepted a football scholarship to the University 
of Michigan to play for legendary coach Bo Schembechler, but during his 
freshman year he decided to play baseball exclusively. He was a two-time 
All-American and led the Wolverines to berths in two College World Series, 
in 1983 and 1984 (the last time Michigan reached the finals). Larkin was 
also named Big Ten Player of the Year in 1984 and 1985.[4] Larkin's number 
16 was retired by the school on May 1, 2010.[1] Larkin played with the 
Vermont Reds on their team that won the 1985 Eastern League Championship 
and in 1986 was the Rookie of the Year and AAA Player of the Year with 
the Denver Zephyrs.[5] In all, he played only 177 minor league games in 
his professional career.[6] After arriving in the majors, Larkin battled 
fellow prospect Kurt Stillwell for the starting shortstop spot before establishing 
himself as the starter in 1987. In 1988 Larkin led all major leaguers by 
striking out only 24 times in 588 at bats.[5] Larkin batted .353 in the 
1990 World Series to help lead the Reds to a four-game sweep of the Oakland 
Athletics.[5] On June 27–28, 1991, Larkin became the first shortstop ever 
to hit five home runs in the span of two consecutive games. He earned his 
fourth consecutive All-Star Game selection that season.[3] After the 1991 
season, Larkin questioned whether the Reds had a commitment to winning. 
He said he was likely to leave the team when his contract expired the next 
year, but he was encouraged when the Reds acquired pitchers Tim Belcher 
and Greg Swindell in the offseason. In January 1992, the Reds signed him 
to a five-year, $25.6 million contract. At that time, only four players 
had larger contracts and Larkin was the highest-paid shortstop.[7] Larkin 
was not selected as an All-Star in 1992, but he won his fifth consecutive 
Silver Slugger Award.[3] In 1993 he won the Roberto Clemente Award,[5] 
which recognizes players who display sportsmanship, community service and 
on-field ability.[8] In 1995, Larkin was sixth in batting (.319) and second 
in stolen bases (51) to win the National League's MVP award, the first 
by a shortstop since Maury Wills in 1962. He led the Reds to a central 
division title and the 1995 National League Championship Series, where 
he batted .389 during the series loss to the eventual champion Atlanta 
Braves.[5] In 1996, Larkin hit a career-high 33 home runs and stole 36 
bases, becoming the first shortstop in Major League history to join the 
30–30 club; he arguably had a better season in 1996 than he had in his 
MVP year of 1995. Larkin was named the Reds' captain before the 1997 season, 
making him the first player to hold the honor since Dave Concepción's retirement. 
Beginning that season, Larkin suffered a series of injuries throughout 
the last few years of his career. He missed 55 games that year due to injuries 
to his calf and his Achilles tendon.[9] About three weeks before the opening 
of the 1998 season, Larkin decided to undergo neck surgery for a perforated 
disk. He was not in severe pain, but he was unable to lift his arm enough 
to play his defensive position.[10] On September 27, 1998, Barry, his brother 
Stephen Larkin, second baseman Bret Boone, and third baseman Aaron Boone 
all played the infield at the same time for the last game of the 1998 season, 
making it the first time in MLB history that two sets of siblings were 
on the field at the same time.[citation needed] In 1999, Larkin was nearly 
traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He later said that he was approached 
by a Los Angeles clubhouse attendant, who gave him a Dodgers jersey with 
his name on it. The jersey had been prepared as trade negotiations advanced 
so that the teams could be prepared for a trade-related press conference.[11] 
In July 2000, Larkin blocked a trade to the New York Mets to remain with 
the Reds. The trade would have sent three players – top minor league outfielder 
Alex Escobar, pitcher Eric Cammack and pitcher Jason Saenz – from the Mets 
to the Reds in exchange for Larkin. Larkin said that he would have gone 
to New York, as he enjoyed playing there, but the Mets did not want to 
sign him to a multi-year contract. The Reds signed him to a three-year 
contract extension worth $27 million.[12] In the 2000 season, Larkin missed 
59 games after he injured his finger twice and he suffered a knee sprain.[13] 
He underwent finger surgery in April and knee surgery in September.[14][15] 
Larkin struggled with a groin injury in 2001, prompting criticism of his 
play. Broadcaster Joe Nuxhall said on air that Larkin had "lost it".[16] 
By August, the injury had limited Larkin to 45 games. He underwent season-ending 
surgery for a hernia that had been diagnosed during an evaluation of the 
groin injury.[16] During the 2002 season, Larkin played in 145 games but 
hit for the lowest batting average (.245) since his first full year in 
the major leagues. Though he did not miss many games, Larkin dealt with 
injuries to his rib cage, hamstring, shoulder, neck and toe.[17] In 2003, 
Larkin had spent two stints on the disabled list with calf injuries by 
late May.[17] During strained contract negotiations with Reds COO John 
Allen in late 2003, Larkin almost left the team. Larkin and the Reds agreed 
to a one-year contract for 2004. Larkin called off a planned retirement 
ceremony scheduled for October 2, 2004, because he was not sure if he would 
retire. In that season, Larkin hit for a .289 batting average. He announced 
his retirement in February 2005.[18] Commenting on Larkin's retirement 
after such a strong season, sports columnist Terence Moore drew a comparison 
to the retirement of Ted Williams. He wrote, "Barry Larkin wasn't quite 
Williams at the end, but he was in the vicinity when it comes to the big 
picture... After years of injuries, he showed what a healthy Larkin still 
could do, but he also showed that he preferred to leave the game more like 
Williams than just about anybody else you can name in baseball history."[19] 
In his 19-year career with Cincinnati, Larkin hit .295 with 2340 hits, 
198 home runs, 960 RBI, 1329 runs scored and 379 stolen bases. Baseball 
historian and expert Bill James has called Larkin one of the greatest shortstops 
of all time, ranking him #6 all time in his New Bill James Historical Baseball 
Abstract. Despite missing significant playing time in six seasons,[20] 
Larkin won the Gold Glove Award three times (1994–1996) and was a 12-time 
All-Star (1988–1991, 1993–1997, 1999, 2000, and 2004).[5] He became the 
first major league shortstop to join the 30–30 club when he had 33 home 
runs and 36 stolen bases in 1996. After his retirement, Larkin was hired 
as a special assistant to the general manager in the Washington Nationals 
organization. With the Nationals, he worked under former Reds general manager 
Jim Bowden. Larkin had hoped to work for the Reds, but USA Today reported 
that his 2003 contract disagreement with Allen eliminated that opportunity.[18] 
In 2008, he signed with the MLB Network as a studio analyst.[21] He was 
the bench coach for the United States at the 2009 World Baseball Classic 
and managed the United States' second-round game against Puerto Rico when 
U.S. manager Davey Johnson left to attend his stepson's wedding.[22] On 
July 20, 2008, the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum inducted Larkin, 
César Gerónimo, August "Garry" Herrmann, and Joey Jay. The induction was 
held at the Duke Energy Center in downtown Cincinnati.[23] On Tuesday, 
March 24, 2009, the College Baseball Foundation announced the names of 
the ten players and coaches comprising the 2009 National College Baseball 
Hall of Fame Induction Class, which included Barry Larkin. In 2011, Larkin 
left Washington for ESPN to serve as a Baseball Tonight analyst.[24] Larkin 
received great applause from Reds fans when he helped host Baseball Tonight's 
on-the-road coverage of Sunday Night Baseball at GABP on July 24, 2011. 
Crowd chants of "Barry Larkin" and "Hall of Fame" often caused the anchors 
to have to talk very loud to be heard. Larkin was coincidentally in Cincinnati 
for Baseball Tonight on the day of the 2011 Hall of Fame induction ceremonies. 
In 2012, Larkin was voted into the Hall of Fame with 86.4 percent of the 
vote. He was the eighth Reds player and 24th shortstop inducted to the 
Hall of Fame. On August 25, 2012 his number 11 was retired in an official 
ceremony at Great American Ball Park.[25] In 2010, his first year of eligibility 
for the Hall of Fame, Larkin had received 51.6 percent of the vote[26] 
(75 percent is needed for election). In 2011, he received 62.1 percent 
of the vote,[27] the highest of non-inducted players and third overall. 
He was invited by the Brazilian Baseball Federation to manage their national 
team in the qualifiers for the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Brazil beat 
host country Panama in Brazil's first time to qualify for the event. They 
were originally scheduled to play in Puerto Rico, but because of the huge 
Japanese baseball influence in Brazil, they played in Japan. The team played 
Cuba and China besides the home country. [28][29] The team went winless 
in its WBC debut and was eliminated after the first round. Larkin built 
the Champions Sports Complex to use sports in the social, emotional, and 
educational development of youth. In 2008, Larkin released a charity wine 
called "Barry Larkin's Merlot", with 100% of its proceeds supporting Champions 
Sports Foundation. In November 2013, Detroit Tigers general manager Dave 
Dombrowski confirmed that the organization had intended to interview Larkin 
for its open managerial position. Larkin declined the interview due to 
the time commitment associated with the job. Brad Ausmus was named the 
new Tigers manager on November 3, 2013.[30] In November 2014, the Tampa 
Bay Times reported that Larkin was among 10 candidates interviewed for 
the Tampa Bay Rays' managerial job.[31] Larkin was not among the team's 
three finalists, and the job ultimately went to Kevin Cash.[32] Larkin 
joined the Cincinnati Reds as a minor-league roving infield instructor 
in May 2015.[33] He helped out the big-league club during spring training 
2016. When asked whether he hoped to manage in the future, he said, "Never 
say never. The conditions have to be right and, you know, the manager's 
job, at least in my opinion, is not about just having the manager's position. 
It's about having the support system to support that manager's position."[34] 
Mr. Larkin has also been an active participant in the SportsUnited Sports 
Envoy program for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, he has 
traveled to Colombia, Ecuador, India, Lithuania, Taiwan, where he worked 
with to conduct baseball clinics and events that reached more than 2200 
youth from underserved areas. In so doing, Larkin helped contribute to 
SportsUnited's mission to reach out to youth populations in order to promote 
growth and a stable democratic government.[35][36][37] Larkin's brother, 
Stephen Larkin, was also a professional baseball player; he made it to 
the major leagues for one game with the Reds. Another brother, Byron Larkin, 
was a second-team All-American basketball player at Xavier University and 
is the color commentator on Xavier basketball radio broadcasts. Larkin's 
eldest brother, Mike, was a captain of the University of Notre Dame's football 
team in 1985. Larkin and his wife Lisa have two daughters, Brielle D'Shea 
and Cymber, and a son, Shane. The family lives in Orlando, Florida. Shane 
played two seasons at the University of Miami before declaring himself 
eligible for the 2013 NBA Draft. Shane was subsequently traded to the Dallas 
Mavericks and made his NBA debut in November 2013. Larkin's daughters play 
lacrosse. Brielle D'Shea is named in honor of Shea Stadium, as Larkin enjoyed 
playing there.[38] In 2012, Cincinnati-based delicatessen Izzy's created
