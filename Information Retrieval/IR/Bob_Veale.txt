Robert Andrew Veale (born October 28, 1935 in Birmingham, Alabama) is a 
former left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. He pitched for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1962–1972) and the Boston Red Sox (1972–1974). He attended 
Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas. In a 13-year career, Veale's record 
was 120-95, with a 3.07 ERA in 397 games (255 starts), with 78 complete 
games and 20 shutouts. As a reliever, he earned 21 saves. Veale was a top 
strikeout pitcher for the Pirates for about seven years. He led the National 
League in the category once, with 250 in 1964; he had been tied with Bob 
Gibson with 245 entering the final day of the season. His career high came 
in 1965, his 276 (to date, a modern-day franchise single-season record) 
finishing a distant second to Sandy Koufax's then-Major League record 382. 
He also was in the top three in the National League two other times. Over 
his career, Veale struck out 1703 batters in 1926 innings pitched. He was 
considered one of the hardest throwers in the game at the time[citation 
needed]. His lifetime ratio of 7.96 strikeouts per nine innings is still 
a Pirates career record and ranks 24th on the MLB All-Time List. With the 
strikeouts came walks as well, as he led the NL in walks four times, tying 
a modern record. In 1968, Veale had a 2.05 ERA, but a losing record of 
13-14. That was the lowest ERA since 1914 by a pitcher with more than 20 
starts and a losing record. Veale was a member of the Pirates in 1971, 
when they defeated Baltimore in seven games to win the World Series. That 
year, in 37 relief appearances, Veale was 6-0 with a 6.99 ERA, 40 strikeouts 
and two saves. In 2006, Veale was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall
