The 1965 Minnesota Twins won the 1965 American League pennant with a 102–60 
record. It was the team's first pennant since moving to Minnesota, and 
the 102 wins was a team record. On April 27, in addition to being the game's 
winning pitcher, Camilo Pascual hit a grand slam in the first inning – 
the second of his career. The Detroit Tigers' Dizzy Trout is the only pitcher 
to have done that before. The Twins spent much of the summer in a race 
for first with the Baltimore Orioles. On July 1, however, the Twins took 
first place and kept it, ultimately winning the pennant by seven games. 
Six Twins made the All-Star Game, (which was played in the Twins' home 
park, Metropolitan Stadium). First baseman Harmon Killebrew, shortstop 
Zoilo Versalles, outfielders Tony Oliva and Jimmie Hall, catcher Earl Battey, 
and pitcher Mudcat Grant all appeared in the game. On September 26 at D.C. 
Stadium in Washington, D.C. – the city the Twins franchise called home 
until 1960 — the Twins beat the Washington Senators 2–1 to clinch the pennant. 
Jim Kaat was the winning pitcher. Overall, 1,463,258 fans attended Twins 
games, the highest total in the American League. During the season, the 
Twins played in front of their largest crowd ever (71,245 at Yankee Stadium 
on June 20) and their smallest crowd ever (547 at home, September 20).[1] 
Versalles was named AL Most Valuable Player. He also led the team with 
126 runs scored, and won a Gold Glove Award for his play at shortstop. 
Oliva led the AL with a .321 batting average. Killebrew was limited to 
113 games by injuries, but still hit 25 HR and 75 RBI. Grant led the league 
with 21 wins, becoming the first black pitcher in the history of the American 
League to win 20 games in a season.[2] Kaat won the Gold Glove for pitchers.
