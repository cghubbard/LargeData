Southbury is a town in western New Haven County, Connecticut, USA. Southbury 
is north of Oxford and Newtown, and east of Brookfield. Its population 
was 19,904 at the 2010 census.[1] Southbury comprises rural country areas, 
suburban neighborhoods, and historic districts. It is a short distance 
from major business and commercial centers, and is within 80 miles (130 km) 
of New York City and 40 miles (64 km) of Hartford; the latter the capital 
of Connecticut. Southbury is the only community in the country with the 
name "Southbury", which is why the town seal reads Unica Unaque, meaning 
"The One and Only." According to the US Census Bureau, Southbury has a 
total area of 40.1 square miles (103.8 km2), of which 39.0 square miles 
(101.0 km2) is land and 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2), or 2.69%, is water.[2] 
Towns that border Southbury are Middlebury to the northeast, Oxford to 
the east and southeast, Newtown to the southwest, Bridgewater to the west, 
and Roxbury and Woodbury to the north. South Britain and Southford are 
included in the incorporated township of Southbury. The town of Southbury 
was one of several towns formed out of a parcel of land purchased from 
the Paugussett Indians in 1659. Southbury was originally part of Woodbury, 
which was settled in 1673. A meetinghouse for the Southbury Ecclesiastical 
Society was built in 1733, and in 1845 the town of Southbury was incorporated.[3] 
Although incorporated as part of Litchfield County, Southbury has been 
in New Haven County for most of its existence.[4] In the 1800s, water power 
became essential to the growth of Southbury's industries, which included 
mills, tanneries, and distilleries.[5] The power for these industries came 
primarily from the Pomperaug River[6] and the Housatonic River. As the 
industrial revolution progressed, many of these businesses left for Waterbury. 
In the 1920s, Russian expatriates Count Ilya Tolstoy (son of author Leo 
Tolstoy) and George Grebentschikoff founded an artists' colony at one end 
of Main Street, known as Churaevka (or "Russian Village"). At its peak, 
Churaevka had a printing press used by Russian and Ukrainian scholars and 
novelists. Visitors to the colony included the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff. 
Most of its immigrant population is now gone; however, St. Sergius Chapel, 
designed by Nicholas Roerich and built in 1932-1933, remains. Churaevka 
is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In November 1937 
residents of the farming outpost got word that a man by the name of Wolfgang 
Jung had purchased 178 acres (0.72 km2) in the town. Residents looking 
into his plans discovered that he was a member of the German American Bund, 
an organization of ethnic Germans living in the United States who supported 
Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. Its leader, Fritz Kuhn, was considered the 
leading anti-Semite in the country. Word soon got out that they were in 
fact planning to build their largest training facility in the country. 
Residents objected by calling a town meeting and set up a zoning department 
with one simple rule, no military activity excluding the United States 
Army. The law was adopted December 14 and the Bund stopped work and eventually 
sold the land.[7] In 2012 a documentary was created entitled 'Home of the 
Brave: When Southbury Said No to the Nazi s' Southbury was a rural farming 
town for most of its history. However, with the development of the Interstate 
Highway System, that changed. With the opening of Interstate 84 through 
Southbury by 1963,[8] the town gained easy access to New York and Hartford, 
also improving its access to Danbury and Waterbury. Heritage Village opened 
in 1967, on a 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) site.[9] In 1987, IBM built an extensive 
office and research building in Southbury, employing over 2,500 workers. 
Southbury was no longer a small, rural town. Today, Southbury has approximately 
17% open space, with a goal of 20%.[10] In the early 1990s, Southbury was 
the subject of a lawsuit by the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation. The 
100-member tribe sought to take the land of roughly 1,200 property holders 
in the town. The lawsuit was thrown out in 1993 based on the fact that 
the man who brought the suit was not a chieftain, contrary to his claims, 
and had no standing to bring the suit.[11] As of the 2000 census,[13] there 
were 18,567 people comprising 7,225 households, including 4,833 families 
residing in Southbury. The population density was 475.4 people per square 
mile (183.5/km²). There were 7,799 housing units at an average density 
of 199.7 per square mile (77.1/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 
97.34% White, 0.45% African American, 0.08% Native American, 1.15% Asian, 
0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.35% from other races, and 0.62% from multiple 
races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.59% of the population. Of 
Southbury's 7,225 households, 29.0% had children under the age of 18 living 
with them, 59.8% were married couples living together, 5.4% had a female 
householder with no husband present, and 33.1% were non-families. About 
29.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 21.4% had someone 
living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 2.41, 
and the average family size was 3.02. Southbury's population consisted 
of 22.8% under the age of 18, 3.3% from 18 to 24, 22.7% from 25 to 44, 
25.1% from 45 to 64, and 26.1% who were 65 or older. The median age was 
46 years. For every 100 females there were 86.9 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 82.3 males. The median income for a household 
in Southbury is $75,970 in 2007, compared to $61,919 in 1999; the median 
income for a family in 1999 was $81,109. In 1999, males had a median income 
of $87,365 versus $68,657 for females. The per capita income for the town 
was $62,731. About 1.9% of families and 4.9% of the population were below 
the poverty line, including 2.3% of those under age 18 and 5.0% of those 
65 or over. The median home value was $532,650. In July 2008, it was estimated 
that there were 19,702 (+6.1% from 2000) people in Southbury. The estimated 
median household income was $75,970 (+22.7% from 2000). The estimated median 
home (or condominium) value was to $374,178 (+92.6% from 2000).[14] Southbury 
is home to a variety of retirement facilities, including Heritage Village, 
New England's largest retirement community. Heritage Village sits on 1,000 
acres (4.0 km2) and includes approximately 2,580 homes with 4,000 people.[15] 
It is billed as being an "active retirement" community, offering many activities.[16] 
Heritage Village was planned in the 1960s, as I-84 was completed in the 
area.[17] Potential Heritage Village residents must be 55 years of age 
or older.[18] By 2013, about 30% of the population of Southbury is expected 
to be 60 years of age or older. By 2020, about 40% will be 60 or older.[19] 
Southbury has developed a three-phase plan to increase services for the 
services. The former Southbury Library was converted into a senior center; 
it also houses the new home of the area Parks & Recreations Department. 
In addition to the "active living" area of Heritage Village, Southbury 
contains several "assisted living facilities", including: Other "active 
senior living" options that provide independent living, assisted living, 
and memory care in Southbury include: Southbury has a six-member Board 
of Selectmen, including First Selectman, Edward Edelson.[20] As of November 
2015, Southbury's other Selectmen are:[20] Other members of Southbury's 
government: Southbury used mechanical voting machines until 2007, when 
it switched to optical scanning machines. The new system has been criticized 
for several reasons, including lack of privacy.[citation needed] Southbury 
utilizes up to five polling stations.[22] for most elections, only the 
firehouse is used. Consistent with Connecticut law, citizens have the option 
of choosing a party when they register to vote. A citizen may join, or 
change, their affiliation later. Primary voting is limited to members of 
that party. (For the 2008 primaries, the day before the February 5 primary 
was the final day to select that party.[22] In 2006, veteran U.S. House 
Representative Nancy Johnson was ousted in favor of Democrat Christopher 
Murphy, who carried Southbury, 51-49%. Junior U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman 
dropped his Democratic party affiliation, but was re-elected as an independent, 
carrying Southbury with 57% of the vote; his closest opponent, Democrat 
Ned Lamont, had only 32% of Southbury's support.[23] In 2008, Southbury 
supported Republican John McCain for President over Democrat Barack Obama 
by a vote of 53-46%. For the U.S. House, the town narrowly supported Republican 
David Cappiello over Murphy, the Democratic incumbent who ultimately won 
in a landslide. In 2010, Southbury voted in favor of Republican candidates 
Tom Foley for Governor and Linda McMahon for U.S. Senate. Though neither 
of the Republicans won statewide, they carried Southbury with 61% and 56% 
of the vote, respectively. Southbury again supported the Republican for 
U.S. House, voting for Sam Caligiuri over the Democrat Murphy by a 56-44% 
margin. U.S. Senators: Joseph Lieberman, Richard Blumenthal U.S. Congressman: 
Christopher Murphy State Senator: Robert Kane State Representatives: Arthur 
J. O'Neill, David Labriola Southbury is part of the Pomperaug Regional 
School District 15-school system, which includes only itself and Middlebury. 
The system contains four elementary, two middle and one high school. Both 
middle schools are national blue ribbon schools. There has long been a 
"battle" going between the two towns over the amount each pays towards 
the system.[26] Southbury is considerably larger than Middlebury, with 
considerably more tax base. This has resulted in Southbury taking up the 
vast majority of the school system, yet because of the substantial tax 
base in Southbury, each resident pays less per student. In recent times 
the truth of this assumption has been challenged, especially during the 
struggle to pass the school system's 2008-2009 budget. Schools physically 
located in Southbury include: Students from Region 15 also have the option 
to attend: The Southbury Parks & Recreations Department moved into the 
old Southbury Library in 2007. Southbury town sports include: Controversy 
has arisen over town sports since the Parks & Rec department began enforcing 
a policy banning out-of-town players from participating in town-sanctioned 
sports in 2006.[27] This policy stems from the fact of overcrowding at 
town fields, a problem which is plaguing Southbury.[28] Only a small area 
of Southbury is covered by water or sewer systems, with the vast majority 
left to wells and septic. Southbury is generally concerned with its water 
table, to the point where the only car wash in town is required to recycle 
all of their water used, an expensive process. The town water provider 
is Aquarion. The gas provider is Yankee Gas Company. The cable (TV, internet, 
and soon, phone) provider is Charter Communications. The electric provider 
is Connecticut Light & Power (a Northeast Utilities Company). The phone 
provider (POTS & DSL) is AT&T Inc. The Southbury Public Library is a department 
of the town, with its own 9-member Board of Directors.[29] On May 1, 2006 
Southbury officially opened its new library (its 3rd, though no two have 
ever been in use concurrently) at 100 Poverty Road. This $6 million project 
was the first public building constructed in Southbury in 30 years. It 
is a 32,000-square-foot (3,000 m2), 2 floor, state-of-the-art facility. 
It contains around 90,000 books. It has computers, audiobooks, DVDs, recording 
rooms for recording books for the blind, meeting rooms, internet, a fireplace 
and a coffee bar.[30] Selections recorded for the blind at the Southbury 
Public Library become part of the National Library Service catalog.[31] 
Planning for the library began in 1998, with an original projected bond 
issue of $7.35m. The planning committee solicited donations from the public, 
which resulted in two single donations of $100,000 or more, and five more 
of between $25,000 and $99,000, in addition to smaller donations.[32] The 
old library building, at 561 Main Street South, has been converted to hold 
offices for the Parks and Recreation department, as well as a new senior 
center. The old library was built in 1969, and expanded in 1979.[29] The 
oldest library building was located in South Britain (a section and Historic 
District of Southbury) and was replaced in 1969.[29] It was built in 1904 
and contained approximately 1,000 volumes.[33] The Shepaug Dam on the Housatonic 
River is part of a hydroelectric power plant, operated by FirstLight Power 
Resources, capable of a peak power output of 42,600 kW.[34] This dam is 
a popular nesting and feeding ground for wintering eagles and hawks, including 
bald eagles. Near the power station, FirstLight also operates an eagle 
observation area first opened by the utility's predecessor, Northeast Utilities, 
in the mid-1980s.[35] Access is free, and some telescopes are provided. 
Utility company employees and volunteers from the Connecticut Audubon Society 
and other groups are at the observation area to assist visitors.[35][36] 
Advanced reservations are required.[37] Eagles are attracted to the spot 
because the water churning through the dam's hydroelectric turbine keeps 
the surface from icing over, allowing the birds to fish. Red-tailed hawks, 
goshawks, great blue herons and other waterfowl are also attracted to the 
spot.[35] The dam flooded an area now known as Lake Lillinonah. FirstLight 
Power Resources has submitted a plan to the Connecticut Department of Public 
Utility Control to build a new peak-power plant next to the existing hydroelectric 
facility.[38] By far the largest corporate complex in Southbury is that 
of IBM. IBM located its facilities between Kettletown Road and Bullet Hill 
Road, up a hill from Main Street on a 230-acre (0.93 km2) site. Access 
to the site is restricted to authorized personnel only. Its original design 
and construction allowed for 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m2) of office 
space, intended for 2,500 people (later increased as around-the-clock operations 
began).[39] It also had 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of "raised floor" 
data center space, originally designed for large-scale water-cooled mainframe 
operations. It is an "off the grid" facility, with its power plant taking 
advantage of jet turbine technology to generate power for the entire site. 
In 2006, this power plant was replaced with a larger one as power demands 
increased. IBM Southbury was originally designed to be one of IBM's new 
corporate headquarters buildings, as IBM's "North Castle" facility in Armonk 
became outdated. It was never used for this purpose, and has been primarily 
used as an IBM Global Services facility. There are four buildings, labeled 
A, B, C, and Central Services. Due to decreasing demand for office space, 
buildings A and C are currently shut down. Southbury Corporate Park is 
a largely theoretical 125-acre (0.51 km2) site between I-84 exits 13 and 
14. It is approved for roughly 900,000 square feet (84,000 m2) of zone 
R60-C compliant corporate offices.[40] The town purchased the site for 
a total of $5 million. It is designed to attract large corporate partners, 
or at worst, non-"big box" retailers. An arts center has also been proposed 
for the site, though this proposal was later revoked in favor of a possible 
location inside the Southbury Training School.[41] The Southbury Volunteer 
Firemen's Association, Inc. is a private, member governed corporation, 
operating as a non-profit organization and is chartered for the purpose 
of providing emergency service to the community. Serving a rural territory 
which includes several miles of Interstate 84, single family homes, industrial, 
heavy commercial, institutional, and some multi-family occupancies. Founded 
in 1932, they operate out of 4 facilities, with 16 specialty fire vehicles, 
and 107 department members. They provide services including Fire Suppression, 
Motor Vehicle Extrication, Operations level HAZMAT, Confined Space and 
Water Rescue to the community.[42] The Southbury Ambulance Association 
was started as a volunteer organization in 1953 by the Southbury Lions 
Club, handling both Southbury and Woodbury. The SAA had some of the first 
EMT's in the state in the 1970s. Until 1978, only SLC members were allowed 
to join the SAA, which caused difficulties in finding sufficient crew for 
the ambulance service. As of 1997, the SAA was responding to more than 
1,500 service calls a year. Today, the SAA still operates as a volunteer 
organization which receives zero funding from the town. It currently operates 
three ambulances.[43] The Southbury Land Trust is a "private nonprofit 
conservation organization dedicated to the protection and preservation 
of Southbury Connecticut's natural resources for the enjoyment and benefit 
of all present and future generations." Basically, the SLT purchases or 
is gifted with land which it places development restrictions on. They currently 
control more than 800 acres (3.2 km2) of land in Southbury. Much of this 
land is open to the public.[44] • Nathaniel Clark (1994-), Sportswriter
