Alfred Voyle "Roxie" Lawson (April 13, 1906 – April 9, 1977) was an American 
baseball player and manager. He was a right-handed pitcher in professional 
baseball for 13 years from 1929 to 1941, including nine years in Major 
League Baseball with the Cleveland Indians (1930–1931), Detroit Tigers 
(1933, 1935–1939), and St. Louis Browns (1939–1940). During his major league 
career, he compiled a 47–39 win–loss record with a career earned run average 
(ERA) of 5.37. Lawson pitched with a right-handed side-arm delivery.[1] 
After his playing career was over, Lawson managed at the minor league level, 
with the Meridian Peps (Meridian, Mississippi) in the Southeastern League 
in 1947 and with the Green Bay Bluejays of the Wisconsin State League in 
1948. Lawson was born in Donnellson, Iowa, in 1906.[2] His father, William 
Lawson, was a blacksmith. The family moved to Stockport, Iowa, when Lawson 
was a child.[3] He played baseball at Stockport High School and began pitching 
as a senior, but "he was so wild there was as much likelihood of his tosses 
hitting the third baseman as there was of them arriving somewhere in the 
vicinity of the batter."[3] After graduating from high school, he played 
semi-pro baseball and developed a reputation for his ability to strike 
out 10 to 15 batters per game.[3] Lawson attended Iowa Wesleyan College 
where he excelled as a college basketball player.[3] After it was discovered 
that Lawson had played semi-pro baseball, he was declared ineligible to 
compete in intercollegiate athletics. Accordingly, and after his third 
semester at the school, Lawson quit college and told officials, "No play, 
no study, I quit."[4] After leaving Iowa Wesleyan, Lawson began playing 
professional baseball with the Keokuk Indians in Keokuk, Iowa. He did not 
make it in Keokuk and was demoted to a club in Decorah, Iowa. While playing 
for Decorah, he signed with a scout for the Cleveland Indians. The Indians 
assigned him the Terre Haute Tots in the Three-I League.[3] In two seasons 
with Terre Haute, he compiled an 8–4 record in 1929 and a 14–7 record in 
1930.[5] Wildness continued to be a problem for Lawson while with Terre 
Haute.[3] In July 1930, the Cleveland Indians purchased Lawson from Terre 
Haute.[3] He made his Major League Baseball debut on August 3, 1930, pitching 
3-1/3 innings against the St. Louis Browns and allowing one earned run.[2] 
On August 13, he started his first major league game, a 7–2 loss to the 
Philadelphia Athletics.[6] Lawson appeared in seven games, four as a starter, 
for the 1930 Indians and compiled a 1–2 record with a 6.15 ERA.[2] Lawson 
remained with the Indians during their 1931 season, appearing in 17 games 
(three as a starter) and compiling a 0–2 record and 7.60 ERA.[2] In March 
1932, the Indians transferred Lawson to the Toledo Mud Hens.[7] He appeared 
in 32 game for the Mud Hens in 1931, compiling a 12–11 record with a 5.56 
ERA.[5] In 1933, he appeared in a career high 43 games and 248 innings 
for Toledo. He compiled an 18–14 record with a 4.57 ERA.[5] On September 
4, 1933, and after a strong season with Toledo, Lawson was sold to the 
Detroit Tigers for cash and players.[8] He appeared in four games for the 
Tigers during their 1933 season, two as a starter, and compiled a 0–1 record 
with a 7.31 ERA in 16 innings pitched.[2] In January 1934, the Tigers returned 
Lawson to the Toledo Mud Hens.[9] During the 1934 season, Lawson appeared 
in 42 games (202 innings) and compiled a 9–14 record with a 5.66 ERA.[5] 
Lawson began the 1935 season with the Toledo Mud Hens and posted one of 
the best seasons of his career. He appeared in 25 games (211 innings) with 
the Mud Hens and compiled a 14–8 record and a 3.92 ERA.[5] On August 21, 
1935, the Detroit Tigers again purchased Lawson from Toledo, with the intention 
of using him as a relief pitcher during the final weeks of a season that 
was heavy with doubleheaders.[1] On August 24, manager Mickey Cochrane 
tabbed Lawson to start for the Tigers against Lefty Grove and the Boston 
Red Sox. Lawson was at the time the best pitcher in the American League 
(his 2.70 ERA led the American League in 1935), and an account in the Detroit 
Free Press analogized Cochrane's decision to start Lawson against Grove 
and Boston to throwing a sacrificial lamb to the lions. The newspaper's 
game summary opened: "They tossed the lamb in to the Lions at Navin Field 
Saturday afternoon, and while 22,000 wide-eyed fans stared in disbelief, 
the lamb up and ran the lions right out of the ballpark."[10] Lawson held 
Boston to five hits in nine innings and won a 2–0 shutout victory. Four 
days later, on August 28, he pitched a four-hit shutout and prevented a 
batter from advancing beyond second base against the Philadelphia Athletics. 
Lawson also hit a single and a double against Philadelphia, and the shutout 
gave him an 18-inning scoreless streak in the week since joining the Tigers.[11] 
In all, Lawson appeared in seven games, four as a starter, for the 1935 
Tigers compiled a 3-1 record with a 1.58 ERA.[2][12] The 1935 Tigers went 
on to defeat the Chicago Cubs in the 1935 World Series. However, Lawson 
did not pitch in the World Series, as the Tigers starters threw five complete 
games.[13] After the 1935 season, Lawson returned to his home in Stockport, 
Iowa, where a banquet was held in his honor.[14] Lawson remained with the 
Tigers in 1936. He appeared in 41 games, only eight as a starter, and compiled 
an 8–6 record and 5.48 ERA. Used principally in relief, Lawson ranked sixth 
in the American League in saves in 1936.[2] Lawson's best season was 1937, 
when he compiled an 18–7 record for the Tigers. He had career highs that 
year with 18 wins, 217-1/3 innings pitched, and 29 games started. He ranked 
among the American League leaders in 1937 with 18 wins (third), a .720 
winning percentage (sixth), and 15 complete games (tenth). In 1937, he 
also had a .259 batting average with five RBIs. He ranked 19th in the voting 
for the 1937 American League Most Valuable Player award.[2] Sportswriter 
Clifford Bloodgood in Baseball Magazine described Lawson in 1937 as "a 
pitcher who has a variety of stuff, the most baffling of which perhaps 
is an excellent change of pace" and noted that Lawson's delivery of his 
change of pace pitch "masks his intentions completely." [15] In 1938, Lawson 
appeared in 27 games, 16 as a starter, and compiled an 8–9 record and 5.46 
ERA. The following year, he appeared in two games for the Tigers early 
in the year, winning one and losing the other.[2] On May 13, 1939, Lawson 
was sent to the St. Louis Browns as part of a 10-player trade that sent 
Bobo Newsom to the Tigers.[16] After the trade, Lawson appeared in 36 games, 
14 as a starter, for the 1939 Browns, compiling a 3–7 record with a 5.32 
ERA.[2] In 1940, Lawson's second season with the Browns, Lawson appeared 
in 30 games, two as a starter, and compiled a 5–3 record with a 5.13 ERA. 
He also ranked eighth in the American League with four saves.[2] During 
the 1941 season, Lawson was affiliated with five different team. He began 
the season with the Browns, but was traded to the Montreal Royals of the 
international League in April.[17] After compiling a 0–3 record at Montreal,[5] 
he was traded in June to the Atlanta Crackers. However, he refused to report 
to the Crackers. Upon being returned to Montreal, he was next traded to 
the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association in July.[18] He compiled 
a 1–2 record in five games for Milwaukee,[5] and he then finished the 1941 
season with the Nashville Vols with whom he compiled a 5–3 record and a 
4.11 ERA.[5] Lawson concluded his playing career in 1942 with the Milwaukee 
Brewers, compiling a 6–6 record and a 5.54 ERA.[5] In November 1942, Lawson 
enlisted in the United States Navy.[19] After his wartime service was concluded, 
Lawson was hired in January 1947 as the manager of the Meridian Peps, a 
Southeastern League team in Meridian, Mississippi.[20] He spent only one 
season with Meridian and was hired in January 1948 as the manager of the 
Green Bay Bluejays.[21] The Bluejays compiled a 37–35 record under Lawson 
before he resigned on July 16, 1948.[22] After his managerial career ended, 
Lawson worked as an umpire in the Three-Eye League.[23] Lawson was married 
to Blanche Klise, and they had a son, Roxie Lee.[3] During Lawson's playing 
career, he and his wife lived on a farm in Iowa during the off-season.[1] 
Lawson's wife died in an automobile accident near Marquette, Michigan, 
in 1957.[24] Lawson died in 1977 at his home in Stockport, Iowa, at age
