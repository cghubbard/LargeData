β Western Park is a park and surrounding suburb located in West End of 
Leicester. It is also a ward of the City of Leicester whose population 
at the 2011 census was 10,609.[1] The park itself was bought for £30,000 
in 1897 and at 178 acres (0.72 km2)[2] is the biggest in Leicester.[3] 
While the park has a "blend of meadows, mature woods and hedgerows"[4] 
the park also contains a large number of sporting facilities including 
a bmx track, a skate ramp, a baseball field, 2 Bowling greens, 5 Football 
pitches, 6 Cricket pitches (all with associated changing facilities) and 
6 Tennis courts.[5] Until the 1950s the Park's tennis courts, then located 
to the far west of the Park, were the home of Westcotes Church Tennis Club 
and then Westfields Lawn Tennis Club.[6] The club later moved to a site 
on the nearby Eastfield Road; the courts on Western Park are now open to 
the public. Since 2008, the full-sized baseball field at the southwest 
end of park has been home to the Leicester Blue Sox Baseball Club. The 
Blue Sox have been British Baseball Federation national baseball champions 
in 2009 and 2012. The club has adult and youth teams and is open to players 
of all ages and abilities. The former park warden's lodge is home to the 
environmental charity Groundworks Leicester & Leicestershire,[7] formerly 
known as Environ. This building is now called the "Eco House" after being 
converted as a show house, used to demonstrate ways of making homes more 
environmentally friendly. It is open to the public and holds one-off events 
as well as receiving visits from local schools.[8] The Eco House and the 
neighbouring recycling centre are parts of the larger Groundwork UK network.[9] 
A voluntary group, The Friends of Western Park, works with the city council 
to "improve the park for everyone".[10][11] The area of Leicester sharing 
the park's name is a generally affluent area to the South and East of the 
park. The suburb also contains Dovelands Primary School which caters for 
550 3–11-year olds, including nursery school children.[12] St. Anne's Parish 
Church,[13] and the aforementioned Westfields Tennis Club. The club has 
four floodlit courts and caters to both children and adults from the local 
area and beyond.[14] Coordinates: 52°38′06″N 1°10′34″W﻿ / ﻿52.635°N 1.176°W﻿
