Thomas Jerome Ferrick (January 6, 1915 – October 15, 1996) was a Major 
League Baseball pitcher, pitching coach and scout. Primarily a relief pitcher, 
he stood 6 ft 2 1⁄2 in (1.89 m) tall and weighed 220 pounds (100 kg) in 
his playing days. He batted and threw right-handed. Born in New York City, 
Ferrick spent four years in an upstate New York seminary studying for the 
Roman Catholic priesthood while also a farmhand with the home team New 
York Giants. He left the seminary in 1939 to attend training camp with 
the Giants, but was released by the club due to an injured arm.[1] He spent 
the 1940 season with the Brooklyn Bushwicks, and pitched well enough to 
catch the eye of Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack. Ferrick immediately 
shined upon his arrival in Philadelphia. He made his major league debut 
against the Boston Red Sox on April 19, 1941, and pitched three scoreless 
innings in relief.[2] When the first place Cleveland Indians came to Shibe 
Park on a five-game winning streak for a three-game set against the last 
place A's on May 18–20, Ferrick appeared in two of the three games. He 
earned his first major league win in game one of the set, stepping in for 
an injured Johnny Babich in the fifth inning, and only allowing one Cleveland 
base runner to reach second base.[3] In the third game of the set, Ferrick 
closed the game with two perfect innings to allow his team to hold onto 
a 6–5 lead and sweep the series.[4] Having made four starts for the A's, 
he pitched his only career shutout on August 21 against the St. Louis Browns.[5] 
In spite of this one performance, he began to sputter toward the end of 
the season, going 2–5 with a 6.36 earned run average in August and September. 
He was selected off waivers by the Indians with five games left in the 
season, but did not appear in any games for his new club. He finished the 
season with an 8–10 record and 3.77 ERA in 36 games for the A's. Ferrick 
appeared in 31 games for the 1942 Indians, going 3–2 with a 1.99 ERA, which 
would have led the American League had he pitched more innings.[6] That 
Christmas, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served as a Shipfitter, Third-Class 
at Naval Station Great Lakes in Lake County, Illinois. While serving in 
Hawaii in 1944, he played baseball at Kāneʻohe Bay Naval Air Station, and 
starred in the 1944 Pacific Service World Series between the Navy and U.S. 
Army. In 1945, Chief Petty Officer Ferrick participated in the Navy's Western 
Pacific Tour, playing for the fifth fleet team.[7] When he returned to 
the Indians in 1946, he made just nine appearances before being sold to 
the St. Louis Browns upon new owner Bill Veeck's dismantling of the club.[8] 
On August 4, 1946 Ferrick earned both of his first two wins with the Browns 
in a doubleheader with his former club, the Philadelphia Athletics.[9][10] 
After the season, the Browns sold Ferrick to the Washington Senators for 
a $7500 waiver price. With his new club, he would lose both games of a 
doubleheader on August 20, 1947.[11][12] He went 3–12 with a 3.77 ERA over 
two seasons for a team that finished in seventh place, but was among the 
league leaders in saves (9 & 10, respectively) both seasons he was in Washington. 
Following the 1948 season, he was traded back to the Browns with John Sullivan 
and $25,000 for Sam Dente. Though the Browns lost 101 games in 1949, Ferrick 
pitched well out of the bullpen, and was the only pitcher on the squad 
with a winning record (6-4, 3.88 ERA in 50 games). At the 1950 trade deadline, 
he, Joe Ostrowski and Leo Thomas were traded to the New York Yankees for 
Jim Delsing, Don Johnson, Duane Pillette and Snuffy Stirnweiss plus $50,000.[13] 
With a winning ball club for the first time in his career, Ferrick helped 
the Yankees jumped from a margin of 4.5 games back of the Detroit Tigers 
to win the American League. He was 1–0 in five appearances against the 
Tigers, holding them scoreless over a total of 10.2 innings pitched. Overall, 
Ferrick went 8–4 with a 3.65 ERA and nine saves. He was called by manager 
Casey Stengel "Our most important individual performer in our drive to 
the top."[14] He made one appearance in the 1950 World Series against the 
Philadelphia Phillies, pitching the final inning of game three to earn 
the win.[15] Ferrick started the 1951 season with the Yankees, but after 
poor pitching performances against the Tigers[16] and Red Sox,[17] he was 
packaged with Bob Porterfield and Fred Sanford, and sent to the Washington 
Senators for Bob Kuzava.[18] Despite the fact that Ferrick pitched respectably 
in his second go round with the Senators (6-3, 2.73 ERA over 2 seasons), 
he sought his release at the end of the 1952 season to take on a player/coach 
role with the Cleveland Indians' triple A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians 
in 1953, going 1–1 in 23 games. A season later, when Indianapolis manager 
Birdie Tebbetts was named manager of the Cincinnati Redlegs, he brought 
Ferrick along to serve as his pitching coach.[19] He later served as pitching 
coach for the Philadelphia Phillies (1959), Detroit Tigers (from 1960 to 
1963) and Kansas City Athletics (from 1964 to 1965). He became chief scout 
of the A's from 1966 to 1968.[20] In 1969, he joined the expansion Kansas 
City Royals as a "special assignment scout with emphasis on pitching", 
and scouted for the club for over twenty years before retiring.[21] Ferrick 
had exceptional control, allowing just 227 walks in 674 innings pitched, 
and uncorking just nine wild pitches over his nine-year career. The only 
batter he ever hit with a pitch was Chicago White Sox second baseman Cass 
Michaels in 1949. Tom Ferrick died from heart failure at age 81 in Lima, 
Pennsylvania. His son, Tom Jr., is a former newspaper columnist for the 
Philadelphia Inquirer, and often recounted anecdotes of his father's playing
