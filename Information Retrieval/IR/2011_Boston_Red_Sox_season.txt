The Boston Red Sox 2011 season was the 111th in the team's history. The 
Red Sox opened their 2011 season in Arlington, Texas, playing the Rangers. 
Breaking from the traditional opening day of Sunday or Monday, Major League 
Baseball's 2011 season began on a Thursday, March 31, with the Red Sox 
playing the next day. The Red Sox were favored to win the AL East and reach 
the World Series in the offseason, with some comparing the team to the 
1927 New York Yankees.[3][4][5] After leading the Tampa Bay Rays by nine 
games in the AL wild card race on September 3—when their odds of reaching 
the playoffs peaked at 99.6%—the Red Sox lost 18 of their final 24 games.[6] 
On the last day of the season, September 28, 2011, a Boston bottom of the 
9th blown save loss against the Baltimore Orioles coupled (mere minutes 
later) with an extra inning come from behind Tampa Bay Rays victory made 
the Rays the American League Wild Card winners, eliminating Boston from 
playoff contention. Mike Lowell confirmed speculation that he would be 
retiring after the 2010 season on September 11, 2010. [1] 11/04/10-Detroit

1/13/11-Released RHP Matt Fox. Fans gathered at Fenway Park on February 
8, 2011 in order to kick off the Red Sox preseason by celebrating Truck 
Day. The first full team workout of the preseason took place on February 
19.[7] Playing other teams in the Grapefruit League the Red Sox finished 
with 14 wins and 19 losses.[8] The Red Sox made a statement in the offseason, 
letting everyone know that after missing the playoffs last year, they are 
striving to win the World Series this year, but instead imploded in dramatic 
fashion in September and failed to make the playoffs. During the offseason 
the Red Sox traded for first baseman Adrian Gonzalez,[9] and they followed 
that move up by signing star outfielder Carl Crawford.[10] The Red Sox 
kicked off the year against the defending AL Pennant Winners, the Texas 
Rangers in Arlington, Texas on Friday, April 1. The Red Sox home opener 
was Friday, April 8 against the rival New York Yankees. On May 15, John 
Lackey and Daisuke Matsuzaka were placed on the disabled list. On June 
10, Matsuzaka underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery. Clay Buchholz 
was afflicted with what would be diagnosed as a stress fracture in his 
back and was also put on the disabled list on June 17, where he would remain 
for the rest of the season. Other pitchers including Rich Hill and Jenks 
spent significant time on the disabled list. The Red Sox obtained Érik 
Bédard from the Seattle Mariners seconds before the trading deadline, after 
Kyle Weiland (who was highlighted by his ejection on his MLB debut) proved 
ineffective. Starting Pitcher John Lackey and ace Jon Lester were ineffective 
down the stretch, as the Red Sox crashed down to a 7-20 finish, blowing 
a 9-game wild card lead that they held entering September. Josh Beckett 
missed a start early in the month after spraining his ankle in a previous 
start, and was ineffective in most of his September starts after that point. 
The Red Sox became the first team in the history of Major League Baseball 
to have a nine-game lead in September and fail to make the playoffs that 
season, thanks to their 7-20 record in the final month of the regular season.[11] 
In the days following this historic collapse, the front office and manager 
Terry Francona decided to part ways, and not exercise either of the additional 
year options on Francona's contract. After the regular season ended, General 
Manager Theo Epstein entered talks with the Chicago Cubs to interview for 
the National League club's vacant General Manager position. The Cubs offered 
Epstein the position of President of Baseball Operations, and he accepted. 
After five months of negotiations, the Red Sox and Cubs agreed to the compensation 
the Red Sox would receive for Epstein. The Cubs acquired minor-league first 
baseman Jair Bogaerts from the Red Sox, and the Red Sox received pitchers 
Chris Carpenter and Aaron Kurcz. Bogaerts is the twin brother of Red Sox 
shortstop Xander Bogaerts. Soon after the season ended, stories broke in 
the local media about several of Boston's starting pitchers, including 
Jon Lester, Josh Beckett, and John Lackey, had been playing video games, 
eating fried chicken, and drinking beer in the clubhouse and dugout during 
games when they were not pitching. Jon Lester was the first to speak publicly 
about the allegations, and admitted to eating and drinking in the clubhouse 
during games, though infrequently, but denied that these actions ever took 
place in the dugout.[12] Infielders Coaches Note: G = Games played; AB
