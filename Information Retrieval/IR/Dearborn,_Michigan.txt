Dearborn is a city in the State of Michigan. It is located in Wayne County 
and is part of the Detroit metropolitan area. Dearborn is the eighth largest 
city in the State of Michigan. As of the 2010 census, it had a population 
of 98,153.[5] First settled in the late 18th century by French farmers 
in a series of ribbon farms along the Rouge River and the Sauk Trail, the 
community grew with the establishment of the Detroit Arsenal on the Chicago 
Road linking Detroit and Chicago. It later grew into a manufacturing hub 
for the automotive industry. The city was the home of Henry Ford and is 
the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company. It has a campus of the 
University of Michigan as well as Henry Ford Community College. Dearborn 
has The Henry Ford, the United States' largest indoor-outdoor museum complex 
and Metro Detroit's leading tourist attraction.[6][7] Dearborn residents 
are primarily of European or Middle Eastern heritage, descendants of 19th 
and 20th-century immigrants. German, Polish, Irish and Italian are the 
primary European ethnicities. Middle Eastern ancestries make up the largest 
ethnic grouping with Lebanese, Yemeni, Iraqi, Syrian and Palestinian groups 
present. The area had been inhabited for thousands of years by varying 
indigenous peoples. Historical tribes belonged mostly to the Algonquian-language 
family, although the Huron were Iroquoian speaking. French colonists had 
a trading post and developed Detroit during the colonial period, trading 
with numerous regional tribes. This settlement was ceded to Britain in 
1763 after its victory in the Seven Years' War. The Dearborn area was settled 
permanently by Europeans in 1786, after the American Revolutionary War.[8] 
Population growth led to Dearborn Township being formed in 1833 and the 
village of Dearbornville within it being established in 1836, both named 
after patriot Henry Dearborn, a General in the American Revolution and 
Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson. The town of Dearborn 
was incorporated in 1893. In 1927 it was established as a city. Its current 
borders result from a 1928 consolidation vote that merged Dearborn and 
neighboring Fordson (previously known as Springwells), which feared being 
absorbed into Detroit. The area between the two towns was, and still remains 
in part, undeveloped. Once farm land, this was bought by Henry Ford for 
his estate, Fair Lane, and the Ford Motor Company World Headquarters. Later 
developments in this corridor were the Ford airport (later converted to 
the Dearborn Proving Grounds), other Ford administrative and development 
facilities, The Henry Ford (the region's leading tourist attraction containing 
a reconstructed historic village and museum), the Henry Ford Centennial 
Library, the super-regional shopping mall Fairlane Town Center, and the 
Dearborn Civic Center. The open land is planted with sunflowers and often 
with Henry Ford's favorite soybeans. The crops are never harvested. The 
Arab American National Museum (AANM) opened in Dearborn in 2005, the first 
museum in the world devoted to Arab-American history and culture. Arab 
Americans in Dearborn include ethnic Lebanese Christians who immigrated 
in the early twentieth century to work in the auto industry as well as 
more recent Arab immigrants from other nations. According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 24.5 square miles (63 km2), 
of which 24.4 square miles (63 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) 
(0.37%) is water. The Rouge River runs through the city with an artificial 
waterfall/low head dam on the Henry Ford estate to power its powerhouse. 
The Upper, Middle, and Lower Branches of the river come together in Dearborn. 
The river is widened and channeled near the Rouge Plant to allow lake freighter 
access. Fordson Island (42°17′38″N 83°08′52″W﻿ / ﻿42.29389°N 83.14778°W﻿ 
/ 42.29389; -83.14778) is an 8.4 acre (33,994 m²) island about three miles 
(5 km) inland from the Detroit River on the River Rouge. Fordson Island 
is the only major island in a tributary to the Detroit River. The island 
was created in 1922 when engineers dug a secondary trench to reroute the 
River Rouge to increase navigability for shipping purposes. The island 
is privately owned, and public access is prohibited. The island is part 
of the city of Dearborn, which has no frontage along the Detroit River.[9][10] 
Dearborn is among a small number of municipalities that own property in 
other cities. It owns the 626-acre (2.53 km2) Camp Dearborn in Milford, 
Michigan, which is located 35 miles (56 km) from Dearborn.[11] Dearborn 
was among an even smaller number that hold property in another state: the 
city owned the "Dearborn Towers" apartment complex in Clearwater, Florida, 
but it has been sold. Camp Dearborn is considered part of the city of Dearborn, 
and revenues generated by camp admissions are used to bolster the city's 
budget. As of the 2010 census the population of Dearborn was 98,153. The 
racial and ethnic composition was 89.1% Whites, 4.0% black or African-American, 
0.2% Native American, 1.7% Asian, 0.2% Non-Hispanics of some other race, 
4.0% reporting two or more races and 3.4% Hispanic or Latino.[16] 41.7% 
were of Arab ancestry (categorized as "White" in Census collection data).[17] 
Dearborn has a large community of descendants of ethnic European immigrants 
from the 19th and 20th centuries, whose ancestors generally first settled 
in Detroit: Irish, German, and Polish. It is a center of Maltese American 
settlement, from the Mediterranean island of Malta. They were also attracted 
to jobs in the auto industry and some were among immigrant Maltese who 
first settled in Corktown.[18] The city has a small African American population, 
many of whose ancestors came to the area from the rural South during in 
the Great Migration of the early twentieth century.[19] In Census 2000, 
61.9% spoke only English, while 29.3% spoke Arabic, 1.9% Spanish, and 1.5% 
Polish. There were 36,770 households out of which 31.3% had children under 
the age of 18 living with them, 51.0% were married couples living together, 
9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.1% were non-families. 
30.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.7% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.65 and the average family size was 3.42. In the city the population 
was spread out with 27.8% under the age of 18, 8.3% from 18 to 24, 29.2% 
from 25 to 44, 19.1% from 45 to 64, and 15.6% who were 65 years of age 
or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 
99.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.5 males. 
The median income for a household in the city was $44,560, and the median 
income for a family was $53,060. Males had a median income of $45,114 versus 
$33,872 for females. The per capita income for the city was $21,488. About 
12.2% of families and 16.1% of the population were below the poverty line, 
including 24.4% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 and over. 
As of the 2012 estimate, Dearborn's population was thought to have fallen 
to 96,474, a decrease of 1.7% since 2010. Over the same period, though, 
SEMCOG, the local statistics agency of Metro Detroit Council of Governments, 
has estimated the city to have grown to 99,001, or an increase of 1.2% 
since 2000. SEMCOG's July 2014 estimate listed Dearborn with a population 
of 102,566.[20] The city's population includes 40,000 Arab Americans.[21] 
Arab Americans own many shops and businesses, offering services in both 
English and Arabic.[22] Per the 2000 census, Arab Americans totaled 29,181 
or 29.85% of Dearborn's population; many are from families who have been 
in the city since the early 20th century. The city has the largest proportion 
of Arab Americans in the United States.[23] As of 2006 Dearborn has the 
largest Lebanese American population in the United States.[24] The first 
Arab immigrants came in the early-to-mid-20th century to work in the automotive 
industry and were chiefly Lebanese Christians (Maronites). Other immigrants 
from the Mideast in the early twentieth century included a large Armenian 
community, who are also Christian. Assyrians/Chaldeans/Syriacs have also 
immigrated to the area. Since then, Arab immigrants from Yemen, Iraq and 
Palestine, most of whom are Muslim, have joined them. Lebanese Americans 
comprise the largest group of ethnic Arabs.[25][26] The Arab Muslim community 
has built the Islamic Center of America, the largest mosque in North America,[27] 
and the Dearborn Mosque. More Iraqi refugees have come, fleeing the continued 
war in their country since 2003. Warren Avenue has the commercial center 
of the Arab-American community. The Arab American National Museum is located 
in Dearborn.[28] The museum was opened in January 2005 to celebrate the 
Arab American community's history, culture and contributions to the United 
States. Ford Motor Company has its world headquarters in Dearborn.[29] 
In addition its Dearborn campus contains many research, testing, finance 
and some production facilities. Ford Land controls the numerous properties 
owned by Ford, including sales and leasing to unrelated businesses, such 
as the Fairlane Town Center shopping mall. DFCU Financial, the largest 
credit union in Michigan, was created for Ford and related companies' employees. 
One of the largest employers in Dearborn is Oakwood Healthcare System. 
Other major employers include auto suppliers like Visteon, education facilities 
such as Henry Ford Community College and museums such as The Henry Ford. 
Other businesses which are headquartered in Dearborn include Carhartt (clothing), 
Eppinger (fishing lures), AAA Michigan (insurance), and the Society of 
Manufacturing Engineers. According to the City's 2015 Comprehensive Annual 
Financial Report,[30] the largest employers in the city are: University 
of Michigan–Dearborn and Henry Ford Community College are located in Dearborn 
on Evergreen Road and are adjacent to each other. Concordia University 
Dearborn Center, and Central Michigan University both offer classes in 
Dearborn.[31][32] Career training schools include Kaplan Career Institute, 
ITT Tech, and Sanford Brown College. Dearborn residents, along with a small 
portion of Dearborn Heights residents attend Dearborn Public Schools,[33] 
which operates 34 schools including 3 major high schools: Fordson High 
School, Dearborn High School and Edsel Ford High School. The public schools 
serve over 18,000 students in the fourth-largest district in the state. 
Divine Child High School and Elementary School are in Dearborn as well; 
the high-school is the largest private coed high school in the area. Henry 
Ford Academy is a charter high school inside Greenfield Village and the 
Henry Ford Museum. Another charter secondary school is Advanced Technology 
Academy. Dearborn Schools operated the Clara B. Ford High School inside 
Vista Maria, a non-profit residential treatment agency for girls in Dearborn 
Heights. Clara B. Ford High School became a charter school in the 2007–08 
school year. The Islamic Center of America operates the Muslim American 
Youth Academy (MAYA), an Islamic elementary and middle school.[34] The 
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit operates Sacred Heart Elementary 
School and previously operated the St. Alphonsus School in Dearborn. In 
2003 the archdiocese closed St. Alphonsus High School;[35] the St. Alphonsus 
elementary closed in 2005.[36] Global Educational Excellence operates multiple 
charter schools in Dearborn: Riverside Academy Early Childhood Center, 
Riverside Academy East Campus (K-5), and Riverside Academy West Campus 
(6-12).[37] Dearborn Public Library includes the Henry Ford Centennial 
Library, the main library, and the Bryant and Esper branches.[38] The Bryant 
Branch, which opened in November 1924, was Dearborn's first public library. 
It served as the main library until the Ford library opened in 1969, and 
1970 Bryant (then known as the Mason branch) became a branch library. The 
library was renamed in 1977 after Katharine Wright Bryant, who developed 
a plan for the library and campaigned for it.[39] Around April 1963 the 
Ford Motor Company granted the City of Dearborn $3,000,000 to build a library 
as a memorial to Henry Ford. Ford Motor Company deeded 15.3 acres (6.2 ha) 
of vacant land for the public library to the city on July 30, 1963, the 
centennial or 100th anniversary of Henry Ford's birth. The Ford Foundation 
later granted the library an additional $500,000 for supplies and equipment. 
On November 25, 1969 the library was dedicated. Library employees occupied 
the building since its opening; originally only the library had offices 
in the building. In 1979 the library staff gave up the western side's meeting 
rooms, and the City of Dearborn Health Department occupied those rooms.[40] 
The Esper Branch, the smallest branch, is located in what is known as the 
Arab residential quarter of the city. The library has about 35,000 books, 
entertainment and educational videocasettes, music CDs, children's music 
cassettes, audio books, and magazines. Newspapers are available there. 
It features many Arabic-language books, newspapers, and videocasettes for 
its Arabic-speaking residents. It was dedicated on October 12, 1953. Originally 
named the Warren Branch, the library had replaced the Northeast Branch, 
which opened in a storefront in 1944. In October 1961 it was named after 
city councilman Anthony M. Esper.[41] During the years 1934 to 1943 murals 
were produced in public buildings in the United States through the Section 
of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the 
Treasury Department. In 1938 artist Rainey Bennett painted an oil on canvas 
mural for the post offices in Dearborn titled, Ten Eyck's Tavern on Chicago 
Road. Sports facilities include the Dearborn Ice Skating Center. Amtrak, 
the national passenger rail system, provides service to Dearborn, operating 
its Wolverine three times daily in each direction between Chicago, Illinois 
and Pontiac, Michigan via Detroit. Baggage cannot be checked at this location; 
however, up to two suitcases in addition to any "personal items" such as 
briefcases, purses, laptop bags, and infant equipment are allowed on board 
as carry-ons. There are two rail stops in Dearborn: the ordinary Amtrak 
station and a rarely used station at Greenfield Village. Amtrak operates 
on Norfolk Southern's (NS) "Michigan Line". This track runs from Dearborn 
to Kalamazoo, Michigan. Most of the freight traffic on these rails is related 
to the automotive industry. Norfolk Southern's Dearborn Division offices 
are also located in Dearborn. Dearborn is served by buses of both the Detroit 
Department of Transportation (DDOT) and the Suburban Mobility Authority 
for Regional Transportation (SMART) systems. From 1924 to 1947, Dearborn 
was the site of Ford Airport, with the world's first concrete runway and 
the first scheduled U.S. passenger service. As of 2016, the Mayor of the 
City of Dearborn is John B. "Jack" O'Reilly, Jr.[42] and the City Council 
President is Susan Dabaja.[43] The metropolitan area newspapers are The 
Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press. The Dearborn & Dearborn Heights 
Press and Guide publishes local news for Dearborn and the neighboring Dearborn 
Heights.[44] The The Arab American News is published in Dearborn.[45] In 
2010, Nabeel Qureshi, David Wood, and two other people were arrested and 
prosecuted for breach of the peace. Police ordered them to stop filming 
the incident, to provide identification, and to move at least five blocks 
from the border of the fair.[47] A jury acquitted the defendants.[48] In 
a separate civil trial, the City of Dearborn was found to have violated 
the constitutional rights of the defendants, with the city later settling 
the lawsuit and issuing a formal apology.[49] A Republican senatorial candidate 
in Nevada, Sharron Angle, suggested that Dearborn was contributing to a 
non-widespread "militant terrorist situation,"[50][51] and said that the 
city was enforcing Islamic law.[50] Angle was sharply criticized by the 
Mayor Jack O'Reilly, who called her comments "shameful."[50] He said they 
were based on distorted Tea Party accounts of the arrest of members of 
an anti-Islam group at an Arab festival.[50] Preacher Terry Jones planned 
a protest in 2011 outside the Islamic Center of America. Local authorities 
required him either to post a $45,000 "peace bond" to cover Dearborn's 
cost if Jones incited violence or to go to trial. Jones contested that 
requirement he and his co-pastor Wayne Sapp refused to post the bond. They 
were held briefly in jail, while claiming violation of First Amendment 
rights. That night Jones was released by the court.[52] The ACLU had filed 
an amicus brief in support of Jones's protest plans.[53] A week later, 
on April 29, Jones led a rally at the Dearborn City Hall, designated as 
a free speech zone. Riot police were called out to control counter protesters.[54][55][56] 
Terry Jones led a rally at City Hall and then planned to speak at the annual 
Festival on June 18, 2011, but on his way there he was blocked by protesters, 
six of whom were arrested. Police said they did not have enough officers 
present to maintain safety.[57] Christian missionaries accompanied Jones 
with their own signs of protest; they were alleged by festivalgoers and 
protesters to have yelled insults at Arabs, Muslims, Islam, and Catholics.[58] 
On November 11, 2011, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Robert Ziolkowski 
vacated the "breach of peace" ruling against Terry Jones and Wayne Sapp 
on the grounds that they were denied due process.[59] On April 7, 2012 
Terry Jones led a protest in front of the Islamic Center of America, Dearborn, 
speaking about Islam and Free Speech. The mosque was placed on lock down. 
30 police cars were there to block traffic and prevent a counter protest.[60]
