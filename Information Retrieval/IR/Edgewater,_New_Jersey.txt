Edgewater is a borough located along the Hudson River in Bergen County, 
New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough 
had a population of 11,513,[10][11][12] reflecting an increase of 3,836 
(+50.0%) from the 7,677 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased 
by 2,676 (+53.5%) from the 5,001 counted in the 1990 Census.[21] The borough's 
history has featured the founding of the first colony in Bergen County, 
contribution to the Revolutionary War, a period as a "sleepy, pastoral 
little town"[22] with resort hotels in the 19th century;[23] industrialization 
in the early 20th century and a transition to a rapidly growing residential 
community in the late 20th century.[24] Edgewater was incorporated as a 
municipality on December 7, 1894, from portions of Ridgefield Township 
as the Borough of Undercliff, based on the results of a referendum that 
passed two days earlier.[25] The borough was formed during the "Boroughitis" 
phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were 
formed in the county in 1894 alone.[26] The borough's name was changed 
to Edgewater on November 8, 1899.[25][27] The borough was named for its 
location on the Hudson River.[28] Native American people are known to have 
lived in the vicinity before the arrival of colonists in the 17th century. 
The Lenape were a local tribe of Native Americans associated with the neighboring 
borough of Fort Lee.[29] David Pietersz Devries (also transliterated as 
David Pietersen de Vries), the first European settler, bought 500 acres 
(202 ha) of land from the Tappan tribe and established the settlement of 
Vriessendael in what is now Edgewater.[30] A historical plaque placed in 
Veteran's Field by the Bergen County Historical Society names Vriessendael 
as the first known colony in Bergen County with a founding date of 1640. 
Vriessendael was destroyed in 1643 in Kieft's War by Indians reacting to 
foolish actions by the Director General of the Dutch West India Company, 
who lived across the river in New Amsterdam, as Manhattan was then known.[31] 
In pioneer days, River Road was known as the Hackensack Turnpike,[32] and 
Ox [sic] Hill Road was an important route to the top of the Palisades Cliff.[33] 
While Oxen Hill Road still exists as a thoroughfare, another Colonial hallmark 
and major local industry[33] has only recently disappeared: shad fishing. 
The Undercliff section in the northern section of Edgewater was originally 
a colony of fishermen.[34] In the 1980s there were still about 100 commercial 
fishermen in New Jersey harvesting shad from their annual spring run from 
the Atlantic Ocean up the Hudson River to spawn. Now there are none.[35] 
Etienne Burdett began ferry service between north Edgewater and the island 
of Manhattan in 1758. His gambrel-roofed house in what is now the Edgewater 
Colony stood until 1899.[36] The ferry service at Burdett's Landing, which 
was located at the southern base of the bluff of Fort Lee, proved valuable 
to the American cause during the Revolutionary War. The ferry functioned 
as the link for supplies, information and transportation between Fort Lee 
on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River and Fort Washington on the New 
York side.[37] In the century following the Revolutionary war, north Edgewater 
developed into a resort area with large hotels built in the mid- and late 
19th century.[23] It was in the 19th century that Burdett's Landing became 
known as "Old Stone Dock", as cobblestones quarried from the Palisades 
Cliffs by Russell & Read were shipped across the Hudson to fill the demand 
for paving Manhattan streets.[38] Concern over the destruction caused by 
quarrying operations led to the formation of the Palisades Interstate Park 
in 1900, which was effective in preserving the cliffs.[39] Although the 
first chemical plant was founded in 1843 in the south section of the borough,[40] 
throughout the 19th century the town retained a bucolic character.[38] 
Early in the 20th century the addition of landfill to the Hudson River 
changed the borough's appearance. Until that time, the Hudson River lay 
closer to River Road from just above Veteran's field southward to what 
is now the Binghamton Ferry Plaza.[41] The 20th century brought great change 
to Edgewater with industrialization, which overwhelmed the borough[42] 
and filled 3 miles (4.8 km) of the shoreline with its operations. Transportation 
of factory goods was facilitated when the New York, Susquehanna and Western 
Railway cut the Edgewater Tunnel through the Palisades in 1894 to connect 
the borough to its main line.[43] Edgewater was also well situated for 
shipping, with deep water piers on the Hudson River and access to abundant 
labor from Manhattan.[40] Generally, industrial development occurred in 
the southern end of the borough, while the northern end remained residential.[33] 
As industrialization increased in the borough, picnic grounds lost their 
appeal and resort hotels faded.[44] By 1918, there were 8,044 workers employed 
by Edgewater's manufacturing facilities, producing primarily chemicals, 
dyes, and confectionery products such as oils and sugars. Prominent industries 
of Edgewater included a Ford assembly plant, Alcoa, Valvoline, and the 
American Can Company.[40][45] Railroad trains served various factories, 
traversing tracks laid in River Road.[42] During the first 30 years of 
the century, Edgewater's population quadrupled, and the transient workforce 
increased tenfold.[44] Eventually the factories closed. The reasons were 
varied, but they included the globalization of industry, obsolete facilities[40] 
and the replacement of railroad shipping by trucking,[35] which could not 
run its large tractor trailer trucks on Edgewater's narrow streets.[43] 
Joseph Mitchell's essay The Rivermen, which was published in The New Yorker 
and is included in his book The Bottom of the Harbor, provides an evocative 
portrait of life in Edgewater in the early 20th century.[46] The late 20th 
century history of Edgewater was one of change from an industrialized town 
to a residential one. With the closing of the factories, development initially 
came to Edgewater in the 1960s[47] and grew exponentially in the early 
1980s, as developers began projects to convert the industrial sites that 
had historically led to Edgewater not being considered as an option for 
development.[48] As condominiums were built along the Hudson where industry 
had formerly operated,[49] the population of Edgewater grew rapidly. The 
population had been mostly in the 4,000 to 5,000 range from 1930 to 1990, 
then increased by 50% to 7,677 in 2000 and again by 50% to 11,513 in the 
2010 Census.[10] Borough council members and residents acknowledge that 
population growth has exacerbated the problem of increased traffic.[24][43] 
With the transition from industrial to residential, crime statistics were 
down, with the police chief describing how bar fights between factory workers 
were commonplace in the early 1970s,[43] while real estate values are up. 
Because of the expense of buying property, some currently refer to Edgewater 
as part of the Gold Coast.[40] A photographic history of Edgewater describes 
the population and demographics change and its possible consequence this 
way: Now a good number of residents live on the river in condominiums and 
rental apartments and town houses on land that was once the province of 
heavy industry. Some see this as the creation of a town divided, with the 
newcomers living on the east side of River Road by the Hudson River and 
the old-timers living on the west side of River Road.[49] Although the 
borough is unrecognizable as the industrial town it once was, growing pains 
have left marks. When the old Alcoa plant site from 1916 began to be converted 
to condominiums, construction was forced to halt for cleanup of industrial 
contaminants, including excessively high concentrations of PCBs.[43] In 
another case, construction of a condominium/shopping center in south Edgewater 
was interrupted for six months by safety measures to protect workers from 
chemical exposure in the lead- and arsenic-riddled soil.[24] Next to this 
structure, behind a chain link fence lies a Superfund site.[40] Operational 
Hess Oil tanks, beside the derelict Alcoa rolling mill, once the second-largest 
in the world, are a reminder of the borough's industrial phase. The building, 
occupying 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m2) of space, was designed in 
1914 and was used to roll ingots of aluminum into sheets that were used 
to create everything from toothpaste tubes to aircraft frames, before the 
facility was abandoned in 1967 due to lack of space needed to expand the 
facility.[50][51][52] According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
borough had a total area of 2.421 square miles (6.272 km2), including 0.935 
square miles (2.422 km2) of land and 1.486 square miles (3.850 km2) of 
water (61.38%).[1][2] The borough is a narrow strip of land along the Hudson 
River, with 3.5 miles (5.6 km) of waterfront.[53] The Palisades Cliff rises 
dramatically and forms a natural border on its western side, running roughly 
parallel to the Hudson. The towns atop the cliff are Fort Lee and Cliffside 
Park, north and south, respectively. Edgewater abuts Fort Lee Historic 
Park in the borough of Fort Lee on the north. On the south it shares a 
border with the township of North Bergen, which lies in Hudson County. 
River Road, which overlooks the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline, 
runs into and out of the town from the north and south, lying just above 
the level of the Hudson. Three roads lead up the Palisades Cliff: Route 
5, with one switchback, ascends to Palisades Avenue, which leads north 
into Fort Lee and south into Cliffside Park. Gorge Road and Edgewater Road, 
the latter still referred to by many local residents by its Colonial-era 
name as Oxen Hill Road, lead up the Palisades to Cliffside Park.[53] The 
borough borders Cliffside Park and Fort Lee in Bergen County; North Bergen 
in Hudson County; and the New York City borough of Manhattan across the 
Hudson River.[54] As of March 2011 about 2,500 Japanese-Americans combined 
live in Edgewater and Fort Lee; this is the largest concentration of Japanese-Americans 
in New Jersey.[64] At the 2010 United States Census, there were 11,513 
people, 5,637 households, and 3,021 families residing in the borough. The 
population density was 12,312.0 per square mile (4,753.7/km2). There were 
6,282 housing units at an average density of 6,718.0 per square mile (2,593.8/km2). 
The racial makeup of the borough was 53.29% (6,135) White, 4.95% (570) 
Black or African American, 0.14% (16) Native American, 35.47% (4,084) Asian, 
0.06% (7) Pacific Islander, 3.35% (386) from other races, and 2.74% (315) 
from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 11.10% (1,278) 
of the population.[10] Korean Americans accounted for 19.6% of the population.[10] 
There were 5,637 households, of which 23.6% had children under the age 
of 18 living with them, 43.2% were married couples living together, 7.8% 
had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.4% were non-families. 
39.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.1% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.04 and the average family size was 2.76.[10] Same-sex couples headed 
38 households in 2010, an increase from the 32 counted in 2000.[65] In 
the borough, 17.7% of the population were under the age of 18, 4.1% from 
18 to 24, 43.6% from 25 to 44, 23.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.6% who were 
65 years of age or older. The median age was 37.2 years. For every 100 
females there were 90.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there 
were 87.0 males.[10] The Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community Survey 
showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income 
was $83,602 (with a margin of error of +/- $8,791) and the median family 
income was $114,375 (+/- $19,887). Males had a median income of $82,248 
(+/- $13,946) versus $57,971 (+/- $9,987) for females. The per capita income 
for the borough was $58,220 (+/- $5,463). About 7.7% of families and 8.5% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.0% of those 
under age 18 and 7.8% of those age 65 or over.[66] As of the 2000 United 
States Census,[18] there were 7,677 people, 3,836 households, and 1,971 
families residing in the borough. The population density was 9,060.6 people 
per square mile (3,487.2/km2). There were 4,277 housing units at an average 
density of 5,047.8 per square mile (1,942.8/km2). As of the 2000 census, 
the racial makeup of the borough was 67.12% White, 10.45% Hispanic or Latino 
of any race, 3.52% African American, 0.21% Native American, 23.12% Asian, 
0.04% Pacific Islander, 2.94% from other races, and 3.05% from two or more 
races.[62][63] There were 3,836 households out of which 20.0% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 40.0% were married couples living 
together, 8.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.6% 
were non-families. 39.1% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 6.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.00 and the average family size was 2.70.[62][63] 
In the borough the age distribution of the population shows 15.4% under 
the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 46.7% from 25 to 44, 23.6% from 45 to 
64, and 8.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. 
For every 100 females there were 94.9 males. For every 100 females age 
18 and over, there were 92.9 males.[62][63] The median income for a household 
in the borough was $63,455, and the median income for a family was $72,692. 
Males had a median income of $50,795 versus $49,238 for females. The per 
capita income for the borough was $42,650. About 6.2% of families and 8.6% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.5% of those 
under age 18 and 13.6% of those age 65 or over.[62][63] In the 2000 Census, 
11.83% of Edgewater's residents identified themselves as being of Korean 
ancestry, which was the ninth highest in the United States and seventh 
highest of any municipality in New Jersey, for all places with 1,000 or 
more residents identifying their ancestry.[67] 3.22% of residents identified 
themselves as being of Japanese ancestry, which was the third highest of 
any municipality in New Jersey, behind Fort Lee (6.09%) and Demarest (3.72%).[68] 
In the 2010 Census, those reporting Korean ancestry had increased to 19.6% 
of the population (2,258 residents), while the percentage of Japanese residents 
had risen to 4.9% (560 residents).[10] Edgewater was the location of the 
Lever Brothers research center where chemist Vincent Lamberti, a holder 
of over 118 patents, spent most of his 40 years for the company, and where 
he invented Dove soap, the first soap not made with animal fat.[69][70] 
Edgewater has five main shopping areas. From north to south they are Town 
Centre, the Binghamton Shopping Plaza, Mitsuwa Marketplace, Edgewater Commons 
and City Place. All are located on the river side of River Road and bordered 
by the River Walk. As recently as 1984 the town had no supermarket.[53] 
Now groceries may be purchased at Whole Foods Market in Town Centre, Trader 
Joe's at the Binghamton Plaza, Japanese-labeled groceries at Mitsuwa Marketplace 
and at Acme Markets in Edgewater Commons. Company-operated shuttle buses 
that ran on Wednesdays and Thursdays, bringing shoppers to Mitsuwa from 
Manhattan, were terminated as of December 31, 2014.[71] 22-acre (89,000 m2) 
Veterans' Field[24] offers residents recreational opportunities and provides 
space for a Community Center and American Legion Post 116. Veterans' Field 
is located on River Road (County Route 505) in the north section of Edgewater, 
lying along the Hudson River. It has indoor and outdoor basketball courts, 
three softball fields, a 1/3 mile-long track which accommodates runners, 
walkers and skaters; tennis courts, a Little League field and a playground. 
It is also the site of a large American flag which can easily be seen from 
across the river in Manhattan. A plaque commemorating the New Netherland 
plantation of David Pietersen de Vries, Vriessendael, is located at the 
entrance to the field on the west. Although the field extends well to the 
east, it did not exist in de Vries's day. In 1922, landfill was dumped 
into the Hudson River from the construction site of Yankee Stadium in the 
Bronx, which gives Veteran's Field its current dimensions.[24] As of September 
16, 2011, Veteran's Field was closed due to soil contamination in the fill 
brought to the site.[72] Borough Hall, the Binghamton Ferry and the Edgewater 
Public Library are listed on both the National Register of Historic Places 
and the New Jersey Register of Historic Places.[73] Constructed in 1904, 
Borough Hall was granted $406,000 by Senate and General Assembly of New 
Jersey in August 2009 for restoration of the building.[74] Among other 
renovations, the missing gargoyles were returned to the 1902 edifice.[75][76] 
The Binghamton Ferry, permanently anchored at the Binghamton Shopping Plaza, 
was built in 1904–1905 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry dock Company, 
Newport News, Virginia [35] The only double-ended Steam powered ferry boat 
still on the Hudson River, the Binghamton ferried passengers from New Jersey 
to Barclay Street in Manhattan for many years [77] and was retired in 1967.[43] 
The last remaining of 15 Carnegie libraries in New Jersey[78] built with 
$15,000 in funds from the Carnegie Foundation,[79] the Edgewater Free Library 
was dedicated on February 8, 1916.[79][80] Edgewater opened its library 
in 1910, prior to the donation from the Carnegie Foundation, with 817 books 
on its shelves.[80] In addition to these sites, the Eleanor Van Gelder 
School is listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places.[73] The 
promenade along the Hudson is part of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. 
In 1988, construction of a waterfront walkway was mandated by state law 
that would allow walkers a path along the Hudson River from Bayonne up 
to the George Washington Bridge.[81] Although property owners were required 
to build and maintain it, many gaps remain.[82] Of the 18.5 miles (29.8 km) 
called for, only 11 miles (18 km) are complete, and many of the gaps occur 
in Edgewater.[83] The completed stretches offer paths for walking along 
the Hudson River with views of Manhattan. Edgewater is the home of a free-flying 
colony of monk parakeets, also known as Quaker parrots, which are native 
to South America. These small, green parrots have lived in Edgewater since 
at least 1980 and were numbered at 200 to 230 in a 2008 article in The 
New York Times.[84] They are easily seen in Memorial Park and its vicinity 
at River Road and Route 5. The parrots build large nests of twigs and down 
which become permanent residences.[85] Nests four-feet long can be seen 
near the intersection. How the birds came to Edgewater is unknown, though 
a widely accepted story traces their origin to an escape from a damaged 
crate at John F. Kennedy Airport in the 1960s.[84] The birds have built 
nests against transformers on utility poles. Citing the risk of fire, the 
utility PSE&G has destroyed such nests. This has brought the utility into 
conflict with parrot advocates. As of 2008, PSE&G has agreed not to take 
down nests during breeding season.[84] Edgewater is governed under the 
Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. The governing body consists 
of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all 
positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November 
general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year 
term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to 
serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for 
election each year in a three-year cycle.[8] The Borough form of government 
used by Edgewater, the most common system used in the state, is a "weak 
mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the 
legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in 
the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override 
by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee 
and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are 
made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.[86][87] As 
of 2016[update], the mayor of Edgewater is Democrat Michael McPartland, 
whose term of office ends December 31, 2019.[3] Members of the Edgewater 
Borough Council are Council President Anthony Bartolomeo (D, 2018), Duane 
Fischetti (D, 2016; elected to serve an unexpired term), Michael H. Henwood 
(D, 2017), Dolores Lawlor (D, 2018), Vincent Monte (D, 2016) and Jose Luis 
Vidal (D, 2017).[88][89][90][91][92][93] In January 2015, Dolores Lawlor 
was selected from the Borough Council from a list of three candidates nominated 
by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the vacant seat expiring 
in December 2015 of Kevin Doran, who resigned from office earlier that 
month after announcing that he was moving out of the borough.[94] Democrat 
Agnes "Nancy" Merse, whose term as mayor was to expire on December 31, 
2011, died due to complications from cancer on March 10, 2011.[95] Councilmember 
James Delaney was chosen in April 2011 to fill Merse's vacancy as mayor.[96] 
Michael H. Henwood was chosen to fill Delaney's vacant council seat, and 
served the remainder of that term until December 2011 before he was elected 
to serve a full term in office.[97] The Edgewater administrative offices 
and police department moved from 916 River Road to the new Borough Hall, 
55 River Road, in 2011, with a dedication ceremony on October 16. The new 
building includes 25,000 square feet (2,300 m2) of space, offering relief 
from cramped conditions with 150% more floor space, and expanded parking 
facilities.[98] Edgewater is located in the 9th Congressional District[99] 
and is part of New Jersey's 32nd state legislative district.[11][100][101] 
Prior to the 2011 reapportionment following the 2010 Census, Edgewater 
had been in the 38th state legislative district.[102] New Jersey's Ninth 
Congressional District is represented by Bill Pascrell (D, Paterson).[103] 
New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, 
Newark, term ends 2021)[104] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[105][106] 
For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 32nd Legislative 
District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate 
by Nicholas Sacco (D, North Bergen) and in the General Assembly by Angelica 
M. Jimenez (D, West New York) and Vincent Prieto (D, Secaucus).[107] The 
Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[108] The 
Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[109] 
Bergen County is governed by a directly elected County Executive, with 
legislative functions performed by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders.[110] 
As of 2015[update], the County Executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus; 
term ends December 31, 2018).[111] The seven freeholders are elected at-large 
in partisan elections on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming 
up for election each year, with a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chairman 
Pro Tempore selected from among its members at a reorganization meeting 
held each January.[112] Bergen County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chairwoman 
Joan Voss (D, 2017; Fort Lee),[113] Vice Chairman Steve Tanelli (D, 2015; 
North Arlington)[114] Chairman Pro Tempore John A. Felice (R, 2016; River 
Edge),[115] David L. Ganz (D, 2017; Fair Lawn),[116] Maura R. DeNicola 
(R, 2016; Franklin Lakes)[117] Thomas J. Sullivan Jr., (D, Montvale, 2015; 
serving the unexpired term of office that had been occupied by James Tedesco 
before he was sworn in as County Executive)[118][119] and Tracy Silna Zur 
(D, 2015; Franklin Lakes).[120][121] Countywide constitutional officials 
are County Clerk John S. Hogan (D, Northvale),[122] Sheriff Michael Saudino 
(R)[123] and Surrogate Michael R. Dressler (D, Cresskill).[124][125][110]

has its own two-party system, split between the Democratic Party and the 
Independent Coalition for a Better Edgewater.[136] The Republican Party 
has minimal presence and doesn't always run a slate in local elections. 
The perennial local political issue is managing growth. The Edgewater Public 
Schools serves public school students in Kindergarten through sixth grade. 
As of the 2012-13 school year, the district's two schools had an enrollment 
of 695 students and 54.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher 
ratio of 12.76:1.[137] With district enrollment increasing rapidly, George 
Washington School opened in September 2012, having been constructed with 
a third floor to accommodate enrollment growth in the district that was 
anticipated to rise from 628 in 2011 to as much as 925 in 2015.[138] Schools 
in the district (with 2012-13 enrollment data from the National Center 
for Education Statistics[139]) are George Washington School[140] serves 
grades PreK-2 (353 students) and Eleanor Van Gelder School[141] serves 
grades 3-6 (342 students).[142] For seventh through twelfth grades, 380 
public school students from the borough are sent to the Leonia Public Schools 
as part of a sending/receiving relationship.[143][144] Schools in the district 
attended by Edgewater students (with 2013-14 enrollment data from the National 
Center for Education Statistics[145]) are Leonia Middle School[146] for 
grades 7 and 8 (which had 482 students in grades 6 - 8), and Leonia High 
School[147] which had 696 students in grades 9 - 12.[148] Public school 
students from the borough, and all of Bergen County, are eligible to attend 
the secondary education programs offered by the Bergen County Technical 
Schools, which include the Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, and the 
Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The district offers programs 
on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission based on a selective 
application process and tuition covered by the student's home school district.[149][150] 
Edgewater was used as a filming location for the 1997 feature film, Cop 
Land, starring Sylvester Stallone, Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel and Ray 
Liotta.[151] As of May 2010[update], the borough had a total of 11.19 miles 
(18.01 km) of roadways, of which 6.38 miles (10.27 km) were maintained 
by the municipality, 4.03 miles (6.49 km) by Bergen County and 0.78 miles 
(1.26 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.[152] New Jersey 
Transit buses include the 156, 158 and 159 routes serving the Port Authority 
Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan; the 188 to the George Washington Bridge 
Bus Terminal; and local service on the 751 and 755 routes.[153][154] Ferry 
service to West Midtown Ferry Terminal in Manhattan is offered by NY Waterway 
at Edgewater Landing, located where Route 5 comes into River Road. Parking 
at the terminal is not allowed; however a shuttle bus operated by the borough 
is available to transport passengers to the landing.[155] In Manhattan 
there is free transfer to a network of buses operated by NY Waterways.[156] 
Several ferries operated in Edgewater in the past,[157] with the old Edgewater 
Ferry Terminal historically located about 100 yards from the current ferry 
terminal. The last ferry in the 20th century crossed the river in 1950.[24] 
The Borough was also site of the Trolley terminal for numerous electric 
lines in New Jersey.[33] Situated across River Road from the old Ferry 
Terminal, it met passengers arriving from Manhattan. Its service included 
transportation to the top of Palisades Cliff.[158] The trolley stopped 
running in 1938.[159] Bike lanes on River Road were completed in July 2012, 
in connection with a road re-paving project.[160] People who were born 
in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Edgewater include:
