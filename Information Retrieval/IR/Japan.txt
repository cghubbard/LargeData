Coordinates: 35°N 136°E﻿ / ﻿35°N 136°E﻿ / 35; 136 Japan (Japanese: 日本 Nippon 
[nip̚põ̞ɴ] or Nihon [nihõ̞ɴ]; formally 日本国  Nippon-koku or Nihon-koku, 
"State of Japan") is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific 
Ocean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, China, 
Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the 
East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. The kanji that make up Japan's 
name mean "sun origin", and it is often called the "Land of the Rising 
Sun". Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four 
largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven 
percent of Japan's land area. The country is divided into 47 prefectures 
in eight regions. The population of 127 million is the world's tenth largest. 
Japanese people make up 98.5% of Japan's total population. Approximately 
9.1 million people live in the core city of Tokyo,[9] the capital city 
of Japan, which is the sixth largest city proper in the OECD and the fourth 
leading global city in the world.[10] The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes 
Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the world's largest metropolitan 
area with over 35 million residents and the world's largest urban agglomeration 
economy. Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as 
early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan 
is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD. Influence from other 
regions, mainly China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from 
Western Europe, has characterized Japan's history. From the 12th century 
until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled 
in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation 
in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States 
fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. After nearly two decades of 
internal conflict and insurrection, the Imperial Court regained its political 
power in 1868 through the help of several clans from Chōshū and Satsuma, 
and the Empire of Japan was established. In the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese 
War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period 
of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded 
into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following 
the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised 
constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy 
with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet. Japan 
is a member of the UN, the G7, the G8, and the G20 and is considered a 
great power.[11][12][13] The country has the world's third-largest economy 
by nominal GDP and the world's fourth-largest economy by purchasing power 
parity. It is also the world's fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest 
importer. The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among 
the most educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage 
of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree.[14] Although Japan 
has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern 
military with the world's eighth largest military budget,[15] used for 
self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with 
a very high standard of living and Human Development Index whose population 
enjoys the highest life expectancy and the third lowest infant mortality 
in the world.[16][17] The Japanese word for Japan is 日本, which is pronounced 
Nippon or Nihon. The English word Japan possibly derives from the historical 
Chinese pronunciation of 日本. The Old Mandarin or possibly early Wu Chinese 
pronunciation of Japan was recorded by Marco Polo as Cipangu. In modern 
Shanghainese, a Wu dialect, the pronunciation of characters 日本 Japan is 
Zeppen [zəʔpən]. The old Malay word for Japan, Jepang, was borrowed from 
a southern coastal Chinese dialect, probably Fukienese or Ningpo,[18] and 
this Malay word was encountered by Portuguese traders in Malacca in the 
16th century. Early Portuguese traders then brought the word to Europe.[19] 
An early record of the word in English is in a 1565 letter, spelled Giapan.[20] 
From the Meiji Restoration until the end of World War II, the full title 
of Japan was Dai Nippon Teikoku (大日本帝國), meaning "the Empire of Great Japan". 
Today the name Nippon-koku / Nihon-koku (日本国) is used as a formal modern-day 
equivalent simply meaning "the State of Japan"; countries like Japan whose 
long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given 
a name appended by the character koku (国), meaning "country", "nation" 
or "state". The character nichi (日) means "sun" or "day"; hon (本) means 
"base" or "origin". The compound means "origin of the sun" or "sunrise", 
and is the source of the popular Western epithet "Land of the Rising Sun".[21] 
A Paleolithic culture around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation 
of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000 BC (the 
start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary 
hunter-gatherer culture, who include ancestors of both the contemporary 
Ainu people and Yamato people,[24][25] characterized by pit dwelling and 
rudimentary agriculture.[26] Decorated clay vessels from this period are 
some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 
BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling 
with the Jōmon.[27] The Yayoi period, starting around 500 BC, saw the introduction 
of practices like wet-rice farming,[28] a new style of pottery,[29] and 
metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.[30] Japan first appears in 
written history in the Chinese Book of Han.[31] According to the Records 
of the Three Kingdoms, the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during 
the 3rd century was called Yamataikoku. Buddhism was first introduced to 
Japan from Baekje, Korea and was promoted by Prince Shōtoku, but the subsequent 
development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[32] 
Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and 
gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).[33] 
The Nara period (710–784) of the 8th century marked an emergence of the 
centralized Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō 
(modern Nara). The Nara period is characterized by the appearance of a 
nascent literature as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired art 
and architecture.[34] The smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have 
killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[35] In 784, Emperor 
Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-kyō before relocating it to 
Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto) in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian 
period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture 
emerged, noted for its art, poetry and prose. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale 
of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem Kimigayo were written 
during this time.[36] Buddhism began to spread during the Heian era chiefly 
through two major sects, Tendai by Saichō, and Shingon by Kūkai. Pure Land 
Buddhism (Jōdo-shū, Jōdo Shinshū) became greatly popular in the latter 
half of the 11th century. Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence 
and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following 
the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, sung in the epic Tale of 
Heike, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed shogun by Emperor Go-Toba, 
and he established a base of power in Kamakura. After his death, the Hōjō 
clan came to power as regents for the shoguns. The Zen school of Buddhism 
was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became 
popular among the samurai class.[37] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol 
invasions in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. 
Emperor Go-Daigo was himself defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336. Ashikaga 
Takauji established the shogunate in Muromachi, Kyoto. This was the start 
of the Muromachi period (1336–1573). The Ashikaga shogunate achieved glory 
in the age of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, and the culture based on Zen Buddhism 
(art of Miyabi) prospered. This evolved to Higashiyama Culture, and prospered 
until the 16th century. On the other hand, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate 
failed to control the feudal warlords (daimyo), and a civil war (the Ōnin 
War) began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period ("Warring States").[38] 
During the 16th century, traders and Jesuit missionaries from Portugal 
reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural 
exchange between Japan and the West. This allowed Oda Nobunaga to obtain 
European technology and firearms, which he used to conquer many other daimyo. 
His consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi–Momoyama 
period (1573–1603). After he was assassinated in 1582, his successor Toyotomi 
Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions 
of Korea in 1592 and 1597. Tokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's 
son and used his position to gain political and military support. When 
open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara 
in 1600. Tokugawa Ieyasu was appointed shogun by Emperor Go-Yōzei in 1603, 
and he established the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo (modern Tokyo).[39] The 
Tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code 
of conduct to control the autonomous daimyo;[40] and in 1639, the isolationist 
sakoku ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries 
of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603–1868).[41] The 
study of Western sciences, known as rangaku, continued through contact 
with the Dutch enclave at Dejima in Nagasaki. The Edo period also gave 
rise to kokugaku ("national studies"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[42] 
On March 31, 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the "Black Ships" of the 
United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with 
the Convention of Kanagawa. Subsequent similar treaties with Western countries 
in the Bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises. The resignation 
of the shogun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized 
state nominally unified under the Emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[43] 
Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, the Cabinet 
organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled 
the Imperial Diet. The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan 
into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand 
its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War 
(1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control 
of Taiwan, Korea, and the southern half of Sakhalin.[44] Japan's population 
grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935.[45] World War I enabled 
Japan, on the side of the victorious Allies, to widen its influence and 
territorial holdings in Asia. The early 20th century saw a brief period 
of "Taishō democracy (1912–1926)" but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy 
buckle under a political shift towards fascism, the passing of laws against 
political dissent and a series of attempted coups. The subsequent "Shōwa 
period" initially saw the power of the military increased and brought about 
Japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism 
and ultranationalism that are a part of fascist ideology. In 1931 Japan 
invaded and occupied Manchuria and following international condemnation 
of this occupation, Japan resigned from the League of Nations in 1933. 
In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany, and the 1940 
Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[46] In 1941, following 
its defeat in the brief Soviet–Japanese Border War, Japan negotiated the 
Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact,[47] which lasted until 1945 with the Soviet 
invasion of Manchuria.[48] The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China 
in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). The Imperial 
Japanese Army swiftly captured the capital Nanjing and conducted the Nanking 
Massacre.[49] In 1940, the Empire then invaded French Indochina, after 
which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[50] On December 
7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, 
British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong and declared war on 
the United States and the British Empire, bringing the US and the UK into 
World War II in the Pacific.[51][52] After Allied victories across the 
Pacific during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion 
of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, 
Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on August 15.[53] The war cost 
Japan, its colonies, China and the war's other combatants tens of millions 
of lives and left much of Japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed. 
The Allies (led by the US) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from 
colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese 
empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories.[54] 
The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far 
East on May 3, 1946 to prosecute some Japanese leaders for war crimes. 
However, the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial 
family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by 
the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers despite calls for the trial 
of both groups.[55] In 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing 
liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty 
of San Francisco in 1952[56] and Japan was granted membership in the United 
Nations in 1956. Japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest 
economy in the world, until surpassed by China in 2010. This ended in the 
mid-1990s when Japan suffered a major recession. In the beginning of the 
21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery.[57] 
On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered the strongest earthquake in its recorded 
history; this triggered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, one of 
the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.[58] Japan has a total 
of 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of East Asia. The country, 
including all of the islands it controls, lies between latitudes 24° and 
46°N, and longitudes 122° and 146°E. The main islands, from north to south, 
are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. The Ryukyu Islands, which include 
Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. Together they are often known 
as the Japanese archipelago.[59] About 73 percent of Japan is forested, 
mountainous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential 
use.[2][60] As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal 
areas, have extremely high population densities. Japan is one of the most 
densely populated countries in the world.[61] The islands of Japan are 
located in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire. They are primarily 
the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions 
of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction 
of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa 
Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk 
Plate to the north. The Boso Triple Junction off the coast of Japan is 
a triple junction where the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate and 
the Philippine Sea Plate meets. Japan was originally attached to the eastern 
coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, 
opening the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.[62] Japan has 108 
active volcanoes. During the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged, 
including Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise Rocks 
in the Pacific. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur 
several times each century.[63] The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 
people.[64] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake 
and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.0-magnitude[65] quake which hit Japan 
on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami.[58] Japan is substantially 
prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the 
Pacific Ring of Fire.[66] It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk 
as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.[67] The climate of Japan is predominantly 
temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical 
features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of 
Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. 
The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, 
cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, 
but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[68] In the 
Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring 
heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, 
though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the 
foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, 
with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as 
well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters 
are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter 
the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[68] 
The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences 
milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because 
of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, 
with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially 
during the rainy season.[68] The average winter temperature in Japan is 
5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F).[69] 
The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 40.9 °C (105.6 °F) was recorded 
on August 16, 2007.[70] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, 
and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late 
July. In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June 
and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often 
bring heavy rain.[71] Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the 
climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist 
broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf 
and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate 
coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[72] 
Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the 
Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the Large Japanese Field Mouse, 
and the Japanese giant salamander.[73] A large network of national parks 
has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well 
as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites.[74][75] Four sites have been inscribed 
on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[76] 
In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental 
policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; 
as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. 
Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced 
several environmental protection laws in 1970.[77] The oil crisis in 1973 
also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of 
natural resources.[78] Current environmental issues include urban air pollution 
(NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water 
eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management 
and international co-operation for conservation.[79] As of June 2015, more 
than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in Japan. 
The NGO Climate Action Network announced Japan as the winner of its "Fossil 
of the Day" award for "doing the most to block progress on climate action."[80] 
Japan ranks 39th in the 2016 Environmental Performance Index, which measures 
a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.[81] As a signatory 
of the Kyoto Protocol, and host of the 1997 conference that created it, 
Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions 
and to take other steps to curb climate change.[82] Japan is a constitutional 
monarchy whereby the power of the Emperor is very limited. As a ceremonial 
figurehead, he is defined by the constitution as "the symbol of the State 
and of the unity of the people." Power is held chiefly by the Prime Minister 
and other elected members of the Diet, while sovereignty is vested in the 
Japanese people.[83] Akihito is the current Emperor of Japan; Naruhito, 
Crown Prince of Japan, stands as next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne. 
Japan's legislative organ is the National Diet, seated in Chiyoda, Tokyo. 
The Diet is a bicameral body, consisting of a House of Representatives 
with 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, 
and a House of Councillors of 242 seats, whose popularly elected members 
serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years 
of age,[84] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[83] The Diet 
is dominated by the social liberal Democratic Party of Japan and the conservative 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has enjoyed near continuous electoral 
success since 1955, except for a brief 11-month period between 1993 and 
1994, and from 2009 to 2012. As of September 2016, it holds 291 seats in 
the lower house and 122 seats in the upper house. The Prime Minister of 
Japan is the head of government and is appointed by the Emperor after being 
designated by the Diet from among its members. The Prime Minister is the 
head of the Cabinet, and he appoints and dismisses the Ministers of State. 
Following the LDP's landslide victory in the 2012 general election, Shinzō 
Abe replaced Yoshihiko Noda as the Prime Minister on December 26, 2012[85] 
and became the country's sixth prime minister to be sworn in during a span 
of six years. Although the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the 
Emperor, the Constitution of Japan explicitly requires the Emperor to appoint 
whoever is designated by the Diet.[83] Historically influenced by Chinese 
law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period 
through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.[86] However, since the late 
19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law 
of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government 
established a civil code based on a draft of the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; 
with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications.[87] 
Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp 
of the Emperor. The Constitution requires that the Emperor promulgate legislation 
passed by the Diet, without specifically giving him the power to oppose 
legislation.[83] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: 
the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[88] The main body of 
Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[89] Japan consists of 47 
prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature and administrative 
bureaucracy.[90] Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns 
and villages.[91] The nation is currently undergoing administrative reorganization 
by merging many of the cities, towns and villages with each other. This 
process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions 
and is expected to cut administrative costs.[92] Japan has diplomatic relations 
with nearly all independent nations and has been an active member of the 
UN since December 1956. Japan is a member of the G8, APEC, and "ASEAN Plus 
Three", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. Japan signed a security 
pact with Australia in March 2007[93] and with India in October 2008.[94] 
It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, 
donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[95] Japan has close ties to the United 
States. Since Japan's defeat by the United States in World War II, the 
two countries have maintained close economic and defense relations. The 
United States is a major market for Japanese exports and the primary source 
of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, having 
military bases in Japan for that purpose.[96] Japan contests Russia's control 
of the Southern Kuril Islands (including Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, 
and the Habomai group) which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[97] 
South Korea's assertions concerning Liancourt Rocks (Japanese: "Takeshima", 
Korean: "Dokdo") are acknowledged, but not accepted by Japan.[98] Japan 
has strained relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the 
Republic of China (Taiwan) over the Senkaku Islands;[99] and with the People's 
Republic of China over the status of Okinotorishima. Japan's relationship 
with South Korea has been strained due to Japan's treatment of Koreans 
during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. 
However, in December 2015, Japan and South Korea agreed to settle the issue 
with Japan issuing a formal apology and taking responsibility for the issue 
and paying money to the surviving comfort women.[100] Japan maintains one 
of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.[101] The country's 
military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of 
the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war 
or use military force in international disputes. Accordingly, Japan's Self-Defence 
force is an unusual military that has never fired shots outside Japan.[102] 
Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.[103] 
The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists 
of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense 
Force (JMSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). The Japan Maritime 
Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime 
exercises.[104] The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; 
the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's 
military since World War II.[105] Japan Business Federation has called 
on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join 
multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.[106] The 21st 
century is witnessing a rapid change in global power balance along with 
globalization. The security environment around Japan has become increasingly 
severe as represented by nuclear and missile development by North Korea. 
Transnational threats grounded on technological progress including international 
terrorism and cyber attacks are also increasing their significance.[107] 
Japan, including its Self Defense Forces, has contributed to the maximum 
extent possible to the efforts to maintain and restore international peace 
and security, such as UN peacekeeping operations. Building on the ongoing 
efforts as a peaceful state, the Government of Japan has been making various 
efforts on its security policy which include: the establishment of the 
National Security Council (NSC), the adoption of the National Security 
Strategy (NSS), and the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG).[107] 
These efforts are made based on the belief that Japan, as a "Proactive 
Contributor to Peace", needs to contribute more actively to the peace and 
stability of the region and the international community, while coordinating 
with other countries including its ally, the United States.[107] Japan 
has close economic and military relations with the United States; the US-Japan 
security alliance acts as the cornerstone of the nation's foreign policy.[108] 
A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a 
non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 20 years, most recently 
for 2009 and 2010. It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership 
in the Security Council.[109] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said 
Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of 
World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. He said 
Japan wanted to play a key role and offered neighboring countries Japan's 
support.[110] In recent years, they have been engaged in international 
peacekeeping operations including the UN peacekeeping.[111] Recent tensions, 
particularly with North Korea,[112] have reignited the debate over the 
status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[113] New military 
guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from 
its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially 
regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.[114] Japan 
is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States 
and China, in terms of nominal GDP,[116] and the fourth largest national 
economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms 
of purchasing power parity. As of 2014[update], Japan's public debt was 
estimated at more than 200 percent of its annual gross domestic product, 
the largest of any nation in the world.[117] In August 2011, Moody's rating 
has cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 
inline with the size of the country's deficit and borrowing level. The 
large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global recession 
and followed by the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the rating 
downgrade.[118] The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross 
domestic product.[119] Japan has a large industrial capacity, and is home 
to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor 
vehicles, electronics, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, 
chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods. Agricultural businesses 
in Japan cultivate 13 percent of Japan's land, and Japan accounts for nearly 
15 percent of the global fish catch, second only to China.[2] As of 2010[update], 
Japan's labor force consisted of some 65.9 million workers.[120] Japan 
has a low unemployment rate of around four percent. Some 20 million people, 
around 17 per cent of the population, were below the poverty line in 2007.[121] 
Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.[122] 
Japan's exports amounted to US$4,210 per capita in 2005. As of 2012[update], 
Japan's main export markets were China (18.1 percent), the United States 
(17.8 percent), South Korea (7.7 percent), Thailand (5.5 percent) and Hong 
Kong (5.1 percent). Its main exports are transportation equipment, motor 
vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts.[123] 
Japan's main import markets as of 2012[update] were China (21.3 percent), 
the US (8.8 percent), Australia (6.4 percent), Saudi Arabia (6.2 percent), 
United Arab Emirates (5.0 percent), South Korea (4.6 percent) and Qatar 
(4.0 percent).[2] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil 
fuels, foodstuffs (in particular beef), chemicals, textiles and raw materials 
for its industries. By market share measures, domestic markets are the 
least open of any OECD country.[124] Junichirō Koizumi's administration 
began some pro-competition reforms, and foreign investment in Japan has 
soared.[125] Japan ranks 27th of 189 countries in the 2014 Ease of doing 
business index and has one of the smallest tax revenues of the developed 
world. The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu 
enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based 
career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment.[124][126] 
Japanese companies are known for management methods like "The Toyota Way", 
and shareholder activism is rare.[127] Modern Japan's economic growth began 
in the Edo period. Some of the surviving elements of the Edo period are 
roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments 
such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[128] 
During the Meiji period from 1868, Japan expanded economically with the 
embrace of the market economy.[129] Many of today's enterprises were founded 
at the time, and Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia.[130] 
The period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s 
has been called the Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 
percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 
1990s.[131] Growth slowed in the 1990s during the "Lost Decade" due to 
after-effects of the Japanese asset price bubble and government policies 
intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. 
Efforts to revive economic growth were unsuccessful and further hampered 
by the global slowdown in 2000.[2] The economy recovered after 2005; GDP 
growth for that year was 2.8 percent, surpassing the growth rates of the 
US and European Union during the same period.[132] Today Japan ranks highly 
for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked first in the Country 
Brand Indexand sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report 2015–2016.[133][134][135] 
The Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4% of the total country's 
GDP.[136] Only 12% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[137][138] 
Due to this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in 
small areas.[139] This results in one of the world's highest levels of 
crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency 
rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 square kilometres (14,000,000 acres) 
cultivated. Japan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly 
subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale 
cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America.[137] 
There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are 
aging with a difficult time finding successors.[140] Rice accounts for 
almost all of Japan's cereal production.[141] Japan is the second-largest 
agricultural product importer in the world.[141] Rice, the most protected 
crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%.[138][142] In 1996, Japan ranked 
fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught.[143] Japan captured 4,074,580 
metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000, 9,558,615 
tons in 1990, 9,864,422 tons in 1980, 8,520,397 tons in 1970, 5,583,796 
tons in 1960 and 2,881,855 tons in 1950.[144] In 2003, the total aquaculture 
production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes.[145] In 2010, Japan's total 
fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish.[146] Offshore fisheries accounted 
for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s 
although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period. Today, 
Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts 
for nearly 15% of the global catch,[147] prompting some claims that Japan's 
fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[148] Japan 
has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.[149] 
Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP.[150] 
Japan's major industries are motor vehicles, electronics, machine tools, 
metals, ships, chemicals and processed foods; some major Japanese industrial 
companies include Toyota, Canon Inc., Toshiba and Nippon Steel.[151][152] 
Japan is the third largest automobile producer in the world, and is home 
to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.[153][154] The Japanese 
consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, 
is currently in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like 
South Korea, the United States and China.[155][156] However, despite also 
facing similar competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding 
industry is expected to remain strong thanks to an increased focus on specialized, 
high-tech designs.[157] Japan's service sector accounts for about three-quarters 
of its total economic output.[136] Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, 
transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies 
such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, NTT, TEPCO, Nomura, Mitsubishi Estate, 
ÆON, Mitsui Sumitomo, Softbank, JR East, Seven & I, KDDI and Japan Airlines 
listed as some of the largest in the world.[159][160] Four of the five 
most circulated newspapers in the world are Japanese newspapers.[161] Japan 
Post, one of the country's largest providers of savings and insurance services, 
was slated for privatization by 2015.[162] The six major keiretsus are 
the Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Mitsui, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sanwa Groups.[163] 
Japan attracted 19.73 million international tourists in 2015.[164] Japan 
has 19 World Heritage Sites, including Himeji Castle, Historic Monuments 
of Ancient Kyoto and Nara. Popular tourist attractions include Tokyo and 
Hiroshima, Mount Fuji, ski resorts such as Niseko in Hokkaido, Okinawa, 
riding the shinkansen and taking advantage of Japan's hotel and hotspring 
network. In inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 16th in the world in 2015.[165] 
In 2009, the Yomiuri Shimbun published a modern list of famous sights under 
the name Heisei Hyakkei (the Hundred Views of the Heisei period). The Travel 
and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2015 ranks Japan 9th out of 141 countries 
overall, which was the best in Asia. Japan gained relatively high scores 
in almost all aspects, especially health and hygiene, safety and security, 
cultural resources and business travel.[166] Domestic tourism remains a 
vital part of the Japanese economy and Japanese culture. Children in many 
middle schools see the highlight of their years as a visit to Tokyo Disneyland 
or perhaps Tokyo Tower, and many high school students often visit Okinawa 
or Hokkaido.[citation needed] The extensive rail network together with 
domestic flights sometimes in planes with modifications to favor the relatively 
short distances involved in intra-Japan travel allows efficient and speedy 
transport. In 2015, 19,737,409 foreign tourists visited Japan.[167] Neighbouring 
South Korea is Japan's most important source of foreign tourists. In 2010, 
the 2.4 million arrivals made up 27% of the tourists visiting Japan.[168] 
Chinese travelers are the highest spenders in Japan by country, spending 
an estimated 196.4 billion yen (US$2.4 billion) in 2011, or almost a quarter 
of total expenditure by foreign visitors, according to data from the Japan 
Tourism Agency.[169] The Japanese government hopes to receive 40 million 
foreign tourists every year by 2020.[170] Japan is a leading nation in 
scientific research, particularly in fields related to the natural sciences 
and engineering. The country ranks second among the most innovative countries 
in the Bloomberg Innovation Index.[171][172] Nearly 700,000 researchers 
share a US$130 billion research and development budget.[173] The amount 
spent on research and development relative to its gross domestic product 
third highest in the world.[174] The country is a world leader in fundamental 
scientific research, having produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either 
physics, chemistry or medicine,[175] and three Fields medalists.[176] Japanese 
scientists and engineers have contributed to the advancement of agricultural 
sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, 
life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world 
in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% (300,000 of 1.3 
million) of the world's industrial robots as of 2013[update][177]—though 
its share was historically even higher, representing one-half of all industrial 
robots worldwide in 2000.[178] Japan boasts the third highest number of 
scientists, technicians, and engineers per capita in the world with 83 
scientists, technicians, and engineers per 10,000 employees.[179][180][181] 
The Japanese electronics and automotive manufacturing industry is well 
known throughout the world and the country's electronic and automotive 
products account for a large share in the global market, compared to a 
majority of other countries. Brands such as Fujifilm, Sony, Panasonic, 
Toyota, Nissan, and Honda are internationally famous. It's estimated that 
16% of the world's gold and 22% of the world's silver is contained in electronic 
technology in Japan.[183] The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) 
is Japan's space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, 
and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in 
the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) 
was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[184] 
Japan's plans in space exploration include: launching a space probe to 
Venus, Akatsuki;[185][186] developing the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter 
to be launched in 2016;[187] and building a moon base by 2030.[188] On 
September 14, 2007, it launched lunar explorer "SELENE" (Selenological 
and Engineering Explorer) on an H-IIA (Model H2A2022) carrier rocket from 
Tanegashima Space Center. SELENE is also known as Kaguya, after the lunar 
princess of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.[189] Kaguya is the largest lunar 
mission since the Apollo program. Its purpose is to gather data on the 
moon's origin and evolution. It entered a lunar orbit on October 4,[190][191] 
flying at an altitude of about 100 km (62 mi).[192] The probe's mission 
was ended when it was deliberately crashed by JAXA into the Moon on June 
11, 2009.[193] Japan has received the most science Nobel prizes in Asia 
and ranked 8th in the world.[194] Japanese researchers have won several 
Nobel prizes. Hideki Yukawa, educated at Kyoto University, was awarded 
the prize for physics in 1949. Sin-Itiro Tomonaga followed in 1965. Solid-state 
physicist Leo Esaki, educated at the University of Tokyo, received the 
prize in 1973. Kenichi Fukui of Kyoto University shared the 1981 chemistry 
prize, and Susumu Tonegawa, also educated at Kyoto University, became Japan's 
first (and, as of 2007[update], only) laureate in physiology or medicine 
in 1987. Japanese chemists took prizes in 2000 and 2001: first Hideki Shirakawa 
(Tokyo Institute of Technology) and then Ryōji Noyori (Kyoto University). 
Masatoshi Koshiba (University of Tokyo) and Koichi Tanaka (Tohoku University) 
won in physics and chemistry, respectively, in 2002. Makoto Kobayashi, 
Toshihide Masukawa, and Yoichiro Nambu who is an American citizen when 
awarded, shared the physics prize and Osamu Shimomura also won the chemistry 
prize in 2008. Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, Shuji Nakamura, who is an 
American citizen when awarded, shared the physics prize in 2014, and the 
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi in 
2016.[195] Japan's road spending has been extensive.[196] Its 1.2 million 
kilometres (0.75 million miles) of paved road are the main means of transportation.[197] 
As of April 2012 Japan has approximately 1,215,000 kilometres (134,000 
miles) of roads made up of 1,022,000 kilometres (14,000 miles) of city, 
town and village roads, 129,000 kilometres (80,000 miles) of prefectural 
roads, 55,000 kilometres (34,000 miles) of general national highways and 
8,050 kilometres (5,000 miles) of national expressways.[198][199] The Foreign 
Press Center/Japan cites a total length of expressways at 7,641 kilometres 
(4,748 miles) (fiscal 2008).[200] A single network of high-speed, divided, 
limited-access toll roads connects major cities on Honshu, Shikoku and 
Kyushu. Hokkaido has a separate network, and Okinawa Island has a highway 
of this type. A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll 
roads connects major cities and is operated by toll-collecting enterprises. 
New and used cars are inexpensive; car ownership fees and fuel levies are 
used to promote energy efficiency. However, at just 50 percent of all distance 
traveled, car usage is the lowest of all G8 countries.[201] Since privatisation 
in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local 
passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, 
Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen 
trains connect major cities and Japanese trains are known for their safety 
and punctuality.[202][203] Proposals for a new Maglev route between Tokyo 
and Osaka are at an advanced stage.[204] There are 175 airports in Japan;[2] 
the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport, is Asia's second-busiest 
airport.[205] The largest international gateways are Narita International 
Airport, Kansai International Airport and Chūbu Centrair International 
Airport.[206] Nagoya Port is the country's largest and busiest port, accounting 
for 10 percent of Japan's trade value.[207] As of 2011[update], 46.1% of 
energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3% from coal, 21.4% from 
natural gas, 4.0% from nuclear power, and 3.3% from hydropower. Nuclear 
power produced 9.2 percent of Japan's electricity, as of 2011[update], 
down from 24.9 percent the previous year.[208] However, by May 2012 all 
of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of 
ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster 
in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public 
opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors 
to service.[209] As of November 2014[update], two reactors at Sendai are 
likely to restart in early 2015.[210] Japan lacks significant domestic 
reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[211] Japan has 
therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy 
efficiency.[212] The government took responsibility for regulating the 
water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labor 
and Welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of 
Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in charge of water resources 
development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment in charge 
of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs and Communications in charge of performance benchmarking 
of utilities.[213] Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. 
97% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities 
and 3% receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems, 
mainly in rural areas.[214] Access to improved sanitation is also universal, 
either through sewers or on-site sanitation. All collected waste water 
is treated at secondary-level treatment plants. All effluents discharged 
to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or 
Lake Biwa, are further treated to tertiary level. This applies to about 
15% of waste water. The effluent quality is remarkably good at 3–10 mg/l 
of BOD for secondary-level treatment, well below the national effluent 
standard of 20 mg/l. Water supply and sanitation in Japan is facing some 
challenges, such as a decreasing population, declining investment, fiscal 
constraints, ageing facilities, an ageing workforce, a fragmentation of 
service provision among thousands of municipal utilities, and the vulnerability 
of parts of the country to droughts that are expected to become more frequent 
due to climate change. Japan's population is estimated at around 127 million,[2] 
with 80% of the population living on Honshū. Japanese society is linguistically 
and culturally homogeneous,[215] composed of 98.5% ethnic Japanese,[2] 
with small populations of foreign workers.[215] Zainichi Koreans,[216] 
Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[217] Peruvians 
mostly of Japanese descent and Americans are among the small minority groups 
in Japan.[218] In 2003, there were about 134,700 non-Latin American Western 
(not including more than 33,000 American military personnel and their dependents 
stationed throughout the country)[219] and 345,500 Latin American expatriates, 
274,700 of whom were Brazilians (said to be primarily Japanese descendants, 
or nikkeijin, along with their spouses),[217] the largest community of 
Westerners.[220] The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; 
primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu[221] and Ryukyuan peoples, 
as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.[222] There are persons 
of mixed ancestry incorporated among the Yamato, such as those from Ogasawara 
Archipelago.[223] In 2014, foreign-born non-naturalized workers made up 
only 1.5% of the total population.[224] Japan is widely regarded as ethnically 
homogeneous, and does not compile ethnicity or race statistics for Japanese 
nationals; however, at least one analysis describes Japan as a multiethnic 
society.[225] Most Japanese continue to see Japan as a monocultural society. 
Former Japanese Prime Minister and current Finance Minister Tarō Asō described 
Japan as being a nation of "one race, one civilization, one language and 
one culture", which drew criticism from representatives of ethnic minorities 
such as the Ainu.[226] Japan has the second longest overall life expectancy 
at birth of any country in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the 
period 2010–2015.[17][227] The Japanese population is rapidly aging as 
a result of a post–World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth 
rates. In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the 
proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050.[228] Religion 
in Japan [229] Japan has full religious freedom based on Article 20 of 
its Constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 percent of the Japanese 
population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of 
which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-shūgō[230]). 
However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, 
rather than the number of true believers. The number of Shinto shrines 
in Japan is estimated to be around 100,000. Other studies have suggested 
that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging 
to a religion.[231] According to Edwin Reischauer and Marius Jansen, some 
70–80% of the Japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion. 
Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during 
festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. 
Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs 
and customs.[232] Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and 
Christmas.[230] Shinto is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 
80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves 
as "Shintoists" in surveys. This is due to the fact that "Shinto" has different 
meanings in Japan: most of the Japanese attend Shinto shrines and beseech 
kami without belonging to Shinto organisations, and since there are no 
formal rituals to become a member of folk "Shinto", "Shinto membership" 
is often estimated counting those who join organised Shinto sects. Shinto 
has 100,000 shrines and 78,890 priests in the country. Buddhism first arrived 
in Japan in the 6th century, it was introduced in the year 538 or 552[233] 
from the kingdom of Baekje in Korea.[233] Christianity was first introduced 
into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549.[234] Today, fewer than 
1%[235][236][237] to 2.3% are Christians.[note 2] Most of them living in 
the western part of the country, where the missionaries' activities were 
greatest during the 16th century. Nagasaki Prefecture has the highest percentage 
of Christians: about 5.1% in 1996.[238] As of 2007[update] there are 32,036 
Christian priests and pastors in Japan. Throughout the latest century, 
some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western 
style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular 
customs among many Japanese.[239] Islam in Japan is mostly represented 
by small immigrant communities from other parts of Asia. In 2008, Keiko 
Sakurai estimated that 80–90% of the Muslims in Japan were foreign born 
migrants primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran.[240] 
It has been estimated that the Muslim immigrant population amounts to 70,000–100,000 
people, while the "estimated number of Japanese Muslims ranges from thousands 
to tens of thousands".[241] Other minority religions include Hinduism, 
Sikhism, and Judaism, and since the mid-19th century numerous new religious 
movements have emerged in Japan.[242] More than 99 percent of the population 
speaks Japanese as their first language.[2] Japanese is an agglutinative 
language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical 
nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating 
the relative status of speaker and listener. Japanese writing uses kanji 
(Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive 
script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic 
numerals.[243] Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, 
Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language 
family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these 
languages,[244] but in recent years the local governments have sought to 
increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese 
dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which has no proven 
relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only 
a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.[245] Public and private 
schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as 
well as English language courses.[246][247] The changes in demographic 
structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential 
decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security 
benefits like the public pension plan.[248] A growing number of younger 
Japanese are not marrying or remain childless.[249] In 2011, Japan's population 
dropped for a fifth year, falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people. 
This was the greatest decline since at least 1947, when comparable figures 
were first compiled.[250] This decline was made worse by the March 11 earthquake 
and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people with approximately another 
2,600 still listed as missing as of 2014[update].[251] Japan's population 
is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050;[228][252] demographers and government 
planners are currently in a heated debate over how to cope with this problem.[249] 
Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution 
to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[253][254] 
Japan accepts a steady flow of 15,000 new Japanese citizens by naturalization 
(帰化) per year.[255] According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 
18 refugees for resettlement,[256] while the US took in 76,000.[257] Japan 
suffers from a high suicide rate.[258][259] In 2009, the number of suicides 
exceeded 30,000 for the twelfth straight year.[260] Suicide is the leading 
cause of death for people under 30.[261] Primary schools, secondary schools 
and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration.[262] 
Since 1947, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and middle 
school, which together last for nine years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost 
all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school. 
Japan's education system played a central part in the country's recovery 
and rapid economic growth in the decades following the end of World War 
II. After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School 
Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that 
would be in effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three 
years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four 
years of university. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the 
academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated 
into one nine-year compulsory schooling program, in hopes to mitigate bullying 
and truancy; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the 
coming years.[263] In Japan, having a strong educational background greatly 
improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support 
oneself. Highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment 
trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more 
attractive in the workforce. The lifetime earnings also increase with each 
level of education attained. Furthermore, skills needed in the modern 21st 
century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude 
in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects 
in Japan's highly technological economy.[264] Japan is one of the top-performing 
OECD countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences with the average 
student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces 
among OECD countries.[265] The Japanese populace is well educated and its 
society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for 
gaining employment in the country's competitive high-tech economy. The 
country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely 
responsible for ushering Japan’s post-war economic growth. Tertiary-educated 
adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit 
economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's 
high tech economy.[264] Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is 
below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively 
high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small.[264] In 
2015, Japan’s public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent 
of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.7%.[266] In 2014, the country ranked 
fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary 
education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 
59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South 
Korea.[14] As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological 
based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher 
education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to 
gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 
75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, 
trade school, or other higher education institution.[267] The two top-ranking 
universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.[268][269] 
The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD 
currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds 
as sixth best in the world.[270] In Japan, health care is provided by national 
and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered 
through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality 
of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance 
through employers can participate in a national health insurance program 
administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have 
been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[271] Patients are free 
to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.[272] Japanese culture 
has evolved greatly from its origins. Contemporary culture combines influences 
from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include 
crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances 
of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea 
ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and 
games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of 
both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[273] 
Nineteen sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, fifteen 
of which are of cultural significance.[76] Japanese architecture is a great 
combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been 
typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled 
or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, 
allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different 
occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; 
chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since 
the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, 
and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today 
a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology. The introduction 
of Buddhism during the sixth century was a catalyst for large-scale temple 
building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese 
Tang and Sui Dynasties led to the foundation of the first permanent capital 
in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an 
as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings 
led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and 
garden design. The introduction of the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity 
and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy. 
During the Meiji Restoration of 1868 the history of Japanese architecture 
was radically changed by two important events. The first was the Kami and 
Buddhas Separation Act of 1868, which formally separated Buddhism from 
Shinto and Buddhist temples from Shinto shrines, breaking an association 
between the two which had lasted well over a thousand years.[274] Second, 
it was then that Japan underwent a period of intense Westernization in 
order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and 
styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught 
its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning 
from study with western architects introduced the International Style of 
modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World 
War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, 
firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical 
movements like Metabolism. The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the 
prototype of Japanese architecture.[275] Largely of wood, traditional housing 
and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors 
that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[276] 
Japanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among the 
oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back 
to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis 
and competition between native Japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported 
ideas.[277] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been 
significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in 
the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence 
on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[277] 
Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige. Hokusai coined the 
term manga. Japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century 
and have become popular worldwide.[278] Japanese animation is called anime. 
Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.[279]

such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The accompanied 
recitative of the Noh drama dates from the 14th century and the popular 
folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, from the sixteenth.[280] Western 
classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral 
part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble Gagaku has influenced 
the work of some modern Western composers.[281] Notable classical composers 
from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentarō Taki. Popular music in post-war 
Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which 
has led to the evolution of J-pop, or Japanese popular music.[282] Karaoke 
is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey 
by the Cultural Affairs Agency found that more Japanese had sung karaoke 
that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower 
arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.[283] The earliest works of Japanese 
literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū 
poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[284][285] 
In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (Hiragana 
and Katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered 
the oldest Japanese narrative.[286] An account of Heian court life is given 
in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki 
Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[287][288] During 
the Edo period, the chōnin ("townspeople") overtook the samurai aristocracy 
as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of 
Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, 
while Bashō revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai 
(haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi.[289] The Meiji 
era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature 
integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were the first 
"modern" novelists of Japan, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichirō 
Tanizaki, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami. Japan has 
two Nobel Prize-winning authors—Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō 
Ōe (1994).[286] Japanese Philosophy has historically been a fusion of both 
foreign; particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements.[290] 
In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries 
ago.[290] Archaeological evidence and early historical accounts suggest 
that Japan was originally an animistic culture, which viewed the world 
as infused with kami (神) or sacred presence as taught by Shinto, though 
its not a philosophy as such, but has greatly influenced all other philosophies 
in their Japanese interpretations.[291] Confucianism entered Japan from 
China around the 5th Century A.D., as did Buddhism.[292] Confucian ideals 
are still evident today in the Japanese concept of society and the self, 
and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[292] 
Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and 
aesthetics.[293] Neo-Confucianism which became prominent in the sixteenth 
century during the Tokugawa era, shaped Japanese ideas of virtue and social 
responsibility; and through its emphasis on investigating the principle 
or configuration of things, stimulated the Japanese study of the natural 
world.[294] Also since the 16th Century, certain indigenous ideas of loyalty 
and honour. Western philosophy has had its major impact in Japan only since 
the middle of the 19th Century.[290] Japanese cuisine is based on combining 
staple foods, typically Japanese rice or noodles, with a soup and okazu—dishes 
made from fish, vegetable, tofu and the like—to add flavor to the staple 
food. In the early modern era ingredients such as red meats that had previously 
not been widely used in Japan were introduced. Japanese cuisine is known 
for its emphasis on seasonality of food,[295] quality of ingredients and 
presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties 
that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. The phrase ichijū-sansai 
(一汁三菜?, "one soup, three sides") refers to the makeup of a typical meal 
served, but has roots in classic kaiseki, honzen, and yūsoku cuisine. The 
term is also used to describe the first course served in standard kaiseki 
cuisine nowadays.[296] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi. 
Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day 
tastes includes green tea ice cream, a very popular flavor. Almost all 
manufacturers produce a version of it. Kakigori is a shaved ice dessert 
flavored with syrup or condensed milk. It is usually sold and eaten at 
summer festivals. Popular Japanese beverages such as sake, which is a brewed 
rice beverage that, typically, contains 15%~17% alcohol and is made by 
multiple fermentation of rice. Other beverage like beer is produced in 
some region such as Sapporo Brewery, the oldest Japan beer's brand. The 
Michelin Guide has awarded restaurants in Japan more Michelin stars than 
the rest of the world combined.[297] Sushi (寿司) Ramen (ラーメン) Tempura (天ぷら) 
Wagashi (和菓子) served with matcha (抹茶) Officially, Japan has 15 national, 
government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated 
under the Public Holiday Law (国民の祝日に関する法律 Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru 
Hōritsu) of 1948.[298] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday 
System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to 
obtain a long weekend. In 2006, the country decided to add Shōwa Day, a 
new national holiday, in place of Greenery Day on April 29, and to move 
Greenery Day to May 4. These changes took effect in 2007. In 2014, the 
House of Councillors decided to add Mountain Day (山の日, Yama no Hi?) to 
the Japanese calendar on August 11, after lobbying by the Japanese Alpine 
Club. It is intended to coincide with the Bon Festival vacation time, giving 
Japanese people an opportunity to appreciate Japan's mountains.[299][300] 
The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming 
of Age Day on Second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 
11, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Shōwa Day on April 29, Constitution 
Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, 
Marine Day on Third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect 
for the Aged Day on Third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 
23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on Second Monday of October, Culture Day 
on November 3, Labour Thanksgiving Day on November 23, and The Emperor's 
Birthday on December 23.[301] There are many festivals in Japan, which 
are called in Japanese as matsuri (祭) which celebrate annually. There are 
no specific festival days for all of Japan; dates vary from area to area, 
and even within a specific area, but festival days do tend to cluster around 
traditional holidays such as Setsubun or Obon. Festivals are often based 
around one event, with food stalls, entertainment, and carnival games to 
keep people entertained. Its usually sponsored by a local shrine or temple, 
though they can be secular.[302] Notable festival often feature processions 
which may include elaborate floats. Preparation for these processions is 
usually organised at the level of neighborhoods, or machi (町). Prior to 
these, the local kami may be ritually installed in mikoshi and paraded 
through the streets, such as Gion in Kyoto, and Hadaka in Okayama.[302] 
Traditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.[303] Japanese 
martial arts such as judo, karate and kendo are also widely practiced and 
enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, many 
Western sports were introduced in Japan and began to spread through the 
education system.[304] Japan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964. 
Japan has hosted the Winter Olympics twice: Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano 
in 1998.[305] Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, making Tokyo the 
first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.[306] Japan is the most successful 
Asian Rugby Union country, winning the Asian Five Nations a record 6 times 
and winning the newly formed IRB Pacific Nations Cup in 2011. Japan will 
host the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.[307] Baseball is currently the most 
popular spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, 
now known as Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936.[308] 
Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, 
association football has also gained a wide following.[309] Japan was a 
venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 
FIFA World Cup with South Korea.[310] Japan has one of the most successful 
football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times.[311] Also, Japan 
recently won the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.[312] Golf is also popular 
in Japan,[313] as are forms of auto racing like the Super GT series and 
Formula Nippon.[314] The country has produced one NBA player, Yuta Tabuse.[315] 
Television and newspapers take an important role in Japanese mass media, 
though radio and magazines also take apart.[316][317] For a long time, 
newspapers were regarded as the most influential information medium in 
Japan, although audience attitudes towards television changed with the 
emergence of commercial news broadcasting in the mid-1980s.[316] Over the 
last decade, television has clearly come to surpass newspapers as Japan's 
main information and entertainment medium.[318] There are 6 nationwide 
television networks, such as NHK, Nippon Television (NTV), Tokyo Broadcasting 
System (TBS), Fuji Network System (FNS), TV Asahi, and TV Tokyo Network 
(TXN).[317] For the most part, television networks were established based 
on capital investments by existing radio networks. Variety shows, serial 
dramas, and news constitute a large percentage of Japanese television show. 
According to the fourth NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 95 percent 
of Japanese watch television every day. The average daily duration of television 
viewing ranged from approximately four hours.[319] Japanese readers have 
a choice of approximately 120 daily newspapers with a total of 50 million 
copies of 'set paper' with an average subscription rate of 1.13 newspapers 
per household.[320] The main newspaper's publishers are Yomiuri Shimbun, 
Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Nikkei Shimbun, and Sankei Shimbun. According 
to a survey conducted by the Japanese Newspaper Association in June 1999, 
85.4 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women read a newspaper every day. 
Average daily reading times vary with 27.7 minutes on weekdays and 31.7
