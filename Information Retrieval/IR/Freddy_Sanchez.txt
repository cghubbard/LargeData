Frederick Phillip "Freddy" Sanchez, Jr. (born December 21, 1977) is an 
American former Major League Baseball second baseman. Sanchez played for 
the Boston Red Sox (2002–2003), Pittsburgh Pirates (2004–2009) and San 
Francisco Giants (2009–2011). He batted and threw right-handed. Sanchez 
announced his retirement on December 21, 2015.[1] Sanchez graduated in 
1996 from Burbank High School in Burbank, California, where he was a three-year 
varsity player. In his senior year he was named MVP of the Foothill League 
of the CIF. He also played in the Daily News Bernie Milligan All-Star Game, 
where he earned MVP honors. While in high school, he played on the same 
summer league team as former teammate Jack Wilson. He was drafted by the 
Atlanta Braves in the 30th round out of Burbank High, but opted not to 
sign. Sanchez was born with a severely pigeon-toed left foot and a club 
right foot, and his parents had received an initial medical prognosis that 
he might never walk. After seeking specialized medical attention through 
the Children's Orthopaedic Center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, he 
underwent surgery to correct his foot problems at 13 months, and then had 
to undergo years of physical therapy before he could walk properly.[2] 
Sanchez went to Glendale Community College for two years, where he led 
the team to a co-championship in the Western State Conference, which was 
also the college's first playoff appearance since 1981. He transferred 
to Dallas Baptist University as a Junior, where he played in the NAIA College 
World Series. In his senior year, he transferred to Oklahoma City University 
in 2000, where he was named a NAIA All-Star. Sanchez was originally signed 
by Boston Red Sox scout Ernie Jacobs after being selected in the 11th round 
of the 2000 draft. In the 2000 season, he split the year between Single-A 
Lowell and Augusta. For Lowell he hit .288, and for Augusta he hit .301. 
He began 2001 playing for Single-A Sarasota, where he hit a Red Sox minor 
league system best of .339. He quickly moved up to Double-A Trenton, where 
he hit well above[clarification needed] the .326. On August 2, 2002, Sanchez 
was called up from Triple-A Pawtucket, and made his major league debut 
for the Red Sox on August 10 against Tampa Bay. He went 1-for-2 with a 
pinch-hit two-run single. The 2003 season saw him optioned back and forth 
between the Red Sox and Pawtucket. At the 2003 trading deadline, Sanchez 
was dealt (along with LHP Mike Gonzalez) to the Pittsburgh Pirates in return 
for pitchers Jeff Suppan, Brandon Lyon and Anastacio Martinez, and was 
assigned to Triple-A Nashville;[3] he played only one game there before 
an ankle injury forced him onto the disabled list. Sanchez spent most of 
the 2004 season on the disabled list because of the ankle injury, and did 
not play until July; he joined the major league roster in September. 2005 
was Sanchez's first full season in the major leagues. He began the season 
as a backup infielder, but ended up playing in a majority of the team's 
games due to injuries and poor performance by other players. He appeared 
in 132 games and made 100 starts (39 at second base, 6 at shortstop and 
55 at third base), compiling a .291 batting average with 5 home runs and 
35 RBI. Sanchez began the 2006 season as a bench player. When third baseman 
Joe Randa suffered an injury on May 6, Sanchez took over the position. 
Sanchez received over 850,000 write-in votes for the 2006 All-Star Game, 
the most of all MLB players. He made the National All-Star squad as a reserve 
selected by NL manager Phil Garner. Sanchez entered the game in the 5th 
inning at shortstop, replacing Édgar Rentería. He made a stellar leaping 
catch.[citation needed] He finished the game at 2nd base and went 0 for 
2 at the plate with two groundouts. A local reporter[who?] dubbed 2006 
Sanchez's "storybook season" for his rise from a high-ceiling, limited-visibility 
prospect to an All-Star and batting champion. Pirates manager Jim Tracy 
admitted his surprise and praised him, "If you handed out ballots at the 
start of the season listing potential candidates to win the National League 
batting championship, I don't know that his name would have been on it. 
Now? He's a guy people are going to keep an eye on for many years to come."[4] 
Sanchez won the 2006 NL batting title, beating Florida Marlins third baseman 
Miguel Cabrera on the last day of the season. Sanchez became the first 
Pirate to win a batting title since Bill Madlock in 1983. Sanchez reached 
the 200-hit mark for the first time in 2006. He also led the National League 
in doubles with 53, as well as having 85 RBIs. He led the majors in line 
drive percentage (27.5%).[5] After the season, Sanchez received the Tony 
Conigliaro Award for having overcome his physical adversities.[2] In early 
January 2006 his Burbank High School Bulldog baseball jersey number "21" 
was retired during a ceremony hosted by the school and city officials. 
The day was declared "Freddy Sanchez" day. In January 2007, Sanchez was 
voted one of Pittsburgh's most 25 beautiful people by Pittsburgh Magazine.[6] 
In 2007, Sanchez was moved to second base, replacing Jose Castillo. Sanchez 
was also named to the 2007 National League All-Star as a reserve, selected 
by Tony La Russa. He was the only Pirate All-Star, and it was his second 
straight All-Star game. He finished the season with a batting average above 
.300, and a career-high 11 home runs. On February 5, the Pirates and Sanchez 
agreed to a multi-year deal. Sanchez's new contract guaranteed him two 
seasons with the Pirates, plus a club option for 2010 that would become 
a guaranteed year if Sanchez met certain performance criteria in 2009; 
the 2010 option took the place of Sanchez's first year of free agency. 
The contract would pay Sanchez up to $18.9 million. With a sluggish first 
half but a strong second half, Sanchez batted .271 in 2008, with 9 home 
runs. On May 25 Sanchez had six hits in one game, Pittsburgh's first six-hit 
game in 19 years, joining Texas Ranger Ian Kinsler as the only ballplayers 
to do so in 2009[7] Shortly after it was announced that Sanchez was the 
Pirates' lone representative in the 2009 All-Star Game, the team began 
to promote Sanchez on the trade market. Interested teams included the Giants, 
Rockies, Twins, and Mariners. On July 16, reports broke that the Pirates 
had asked to sit down and talk about a long term contract with Sanchez 
and Jack Wilson. Both players rejected the initial offers, but reportedly 
were still open to negotiation.[8] On July 29, 2009, Sanchez was traded 
to the San Francisco Giants for minor league pitcher Tim Alderson.[9] On 
August 26, Sanchez was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a strained 
left shoulder.[10] On October 30, after hitting a combined .293/.326/.416 
over 111 games with the Pirates and Giants, Sanchez signed a two-year, 
$12 million contract to remain with the Giants.[11][12] Sanchez hit .292 
with 7 home runs and 47 runs batted in 2010. The San Francisco Giants won 
92 games and the National League Western Division, in a season that culminated 
in the Giants' winning the 2010 World Series title. Sanchez became the 
first player in history to collect 3 doubles in his first 3 World Series 
at-bats.[13] He had initially been awarded doubles in his first four at-bats, 
but his fourth consecutive stop at second base was ultimately ruled a single 
and an error. On April 1, the Giants extended Sanchez's contract an additional 
year for $6 million in 2012.[12] On June 10, Sanchez dislocated his shoulder 
diving for a ground ball by Reds second baseman Brandon Phillips. On August 
1, it was announced that Sanchez would have season-ending surgery. Sanchez 
started the year on the disabled list. On July 5, 2012, it was announced 
that Sanchez would miss the rest of the season after undergoing back surgery. 
Sanchez officially retired on December 21, 2015, on his 38th birthday. 
Sanchez and his wife Alissa have two sons; Evan (born April 19, 2005) and
