Oakland is a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. As of 
the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 12,754,[8][9][10] 
reflecting an increase of 288 (+2.3%) from the 12,466 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 469 (+3.9%) from the 11,997 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[19] Oakland was incorporated as a borough by an act 
of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1902, from portions of Franklin 
Township (now Wyckoff).[20][21] The name comes from the white oak trees 
in the area.[22] The Van Allen House was built in 1748 and was a stop for 
George Washington and his troops in 1777.[23] From the 1940s through the 
end of the 1960s a summer bungalow colony was developed in a valley in 
West Oakland on the Ramapo River. This was a refuge for a close-knit group 
of several score families from the summer heat of New York City and urban 
New Jersey. During the summer months the New York, Susquehanna and Western 
Railroad provided service at a West Oakland passenger station. This colony 
was located on the road between Oakland and Pompton Lakes, near a training 
camp for boxers. In the early morning, a resident could see Joe Louis or 
Sugar Ray Robinson, among others, running past the summer homes.[citation 
needed] One section of streets in the town are named after Native American 
tribes and Native American first names. Now considered politically incorrect, 
the borough had a wooden sign posted downtown that read "Once there was 
[sic] Indians all over this place" which had been donated by a resident 
who insisted on the wording of the sign as having been a quotation from 
an author.[24] On August 4, 1985, a gun shootout occurred at the FRG Sports 
Complex[25] — formerly known as Muller's Park — directly next to Oakland's 
former swimming park located along the Ramapo River called Pleasureland.[26] 
Some time around 4:30 p.m. gunfire between rival Jamaican gangs, who were 
bused-in from out of town, broke out resulting in two deaths and a number 
of injuries.[27] Before the incident, Pleasureland and Muller's Park were 
popular summer destinations that had since the 1950s and earlier (Muller's 
was built in 1935) attracted families from across the Tri-state area. Pleasureland 
remained open for a brief period after the shooting incident at FRG, but 
FRG/Muller's Park never reopened after that day.[28] While the shootout 
did not occur at Pleasureland, due to the park's popularity the events 
remain to this day known as the "Pleasureland Shootout" and "Pleasureland 
Massacre" among people outside of Oakland. The pools and buildings having 
since been demolished and filled in, but the properties have begun a major 
restoration. The properties are united and are now called Great Oak Park, 
which was named after a town wide election where over 2,000 people cast 
a ballot. The park is being developed as a passive recreation park. The 
borough, led by a group of volunteers has been working on bringing the 
40-acre park back to life since January 2012. The borough purchased the 
property from building developers in 2009.[29] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 8.728 square miles

in Oakland, is a major manufacturer of teddy bears and other gift products, 
including stuffed animals, baby gifts, soft baby toys and development toys 
as well as picture, candles, figurines and home fragrance products. Russ 
Berrie and Company, since renamed to Kid Brands, has since moved to Wayne 
and from there to East Rutherford.[46] Recreation is run by an all volunteer 
nine-member Recreation Commission. All members are appointed by the Mayor 
for a five-year term. There are a number of municipal recreational facilities 
in Oakland. The largest is a recreational area located off Oak Street, 
known to residents simply as the "Rec Field," but formally known as the 
Alexander Potash Recreation Complex, which is home to nine baseball and 
softball fields, six tennis courts, a roller hockey rink, basketball courts, 
and other facilities.[47] New Jersey's Ramapo Mountain State Forest is 
located in Oakland and can be accessed from Skyline Drive just north of 
its interchange with I-287.[48] Camp Tamarack, which was a year round camp 
operated by the Boy Scouts of America from the late 1920s until the mid-1980s, 
sits abandoned off of Skyline Drive. The camp ceased all activities and 
was taken over by the Bergen County park system in 1998.[49] Many of the 
structures in the camp have been torn down, but some remain standing. Oakland 
is the current location of the headquarters of the Northern New Jersey 
Council.[50] The Rec Field is home to the annual carnival and fireworks 
that take place during the summer. Oakland also offers a summer camp which 
runs for six weeks.[51] Oakland is governed under the Borough form of New 
Jersey municipal government. The governing body consists of a Mayor and 
a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected 
at large on a partisan basis during the November general election. A Mayor 
is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough 
Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a 
staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year 
cycle.[6] The Borough form of government used by Oakland, the most common 
system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government 
in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding 
at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[52][53] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of the Borough of Oakland 
is Democrat Linda H. Schwager, whose term of office ends December 31, 2019. 
The members of the Oakland Borough Council are Council President Chris 
Visconti (R, 2018), John Biale (D, 2018), Sandra C. Coira (D, 2017), Timothy 
Jensen (R, 2016), Eric Kulmula (R, 2016) and Russell Talamini (R, 2017).[3][54][55][56][57][58]

New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[69] Bergen County is governed 
by a directly elected County Executive, with legislative functions performed 
by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders.[70] As of 2015[update], 
the County Executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus; term ends December 
31, 2018).[71] The seven freeholders are elected at-large in partisan elections 
on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming up for election each 
year, with a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chairman Pro Tempore selected 
from among its members at a reorganization meeting held each January.[72] 
Bergen County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chairwoman Joan Voss (D, 2017;

of office that had been occupied by James Tedesco before he was sworn in 
as County Executive)[78][79] and Tracy Silna Zur (D, 2015; Franklin Lakes).[80][81]

Northvale),[82] Sheriff Michael Saudino (R)[83] and Surrogate Michael R. 
Dressler (D, Cresskill).[84][85][70] In 2004, the New Jersey Legislature 
passed the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, which regulates 
the New Jersey Highlands region. Oakland was included in the highlands 
preservation area and is subject to the rules of the act and the Highlands 
Water Protection and Planning Council, a division of the New Jersey Department 
of Environmental Protection.[86] Some of the territory in the protected 
region is classified as being in the highlands preservation area, and thus 
subject to additional rules.[87] As of March 23, 2011, there were a total

recreational and cultural activities, and risk of crime.[117] In 2013 Oakland 
was ranked by New Jersey Monthly as #1 for Young Families "...Oakland is 
woodsy and a bit remote, but its midsize homes, good schools and low crime 
rate make it popular with young families" A rail right-of-way was built 
by the New Jersey Midland Railway around 1870[118] and later served passengers
