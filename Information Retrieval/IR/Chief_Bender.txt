Charles Albert "Chief" Bender (May 5, 1884[a 1] – May 22, 1954) was a pitcher 
in Major League Baseball during the first two decades of the 20th century. 
In 1911, Bender tied a record by pitching three complete games in a single 
World Series. He finished his career with a win-loss record of 212-127, 
for a .625 winning percentage and a career 2.46 earned run average (ERA). 
After his major league playing career, Bender filled multiple baseball 
roles, including service as a major league coach, minor league manager 
and player-manager, college manager and professional scout. He was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953 and he died not long before his induction 
ceremony the following year. Bender was born in Crow Wing County, Minnesota 
as a member of the Ojibwe tribe. His father was German and his mother was 
part Chippewa. As a child, he received the Indian name "Mandowescence", 
meaning "Little Spirit Animal." His family had 160 acres on the White Earth 
Indian Reservation near Bemidji, Minnesota. His father taught him to farm 
on the reservation.[1] He graduated from Carlisle Indian Industrial School 
and attended Dickinson College. Bender debuted in the major leagues in 
1903. He is one of only a few pitchers in the 20th century to throw 200 
or more innings at the age of 19. His walks per nine innings rate was 2.17; 
only a few pitchers since 1893 have had a rate below 2.2 at the age of 
20 or younger. That year he also won a game against Cy Young and even met 
his future wife Marie.[2] In 1905, Bender earned an 18-11 win-loss record 
with a 2.83 ERA, helping the A's win the AL pennant, but they lost the 
World Series in five games to the New York Giants. Bender went 1-1, 1.06 
ERA in the series, pitching a 4-hit, 3-0 complete game shutout in game 
2, striking out 9, and again went the distance in game 5, giving up just 
two earned runs in eight innings and losing 2-0 to Christy Mathewson. After 
solid seasons in 1906 (15-10, 2.53), 1907 (16-8, 2.05), 1908 (8-9 despite 
a 1.75 ERA) and 1909 (18-8, 1.66), he led the Athletics to the AL pennant 
in 1910 as Philadelphia went 102-48, 14 1/2 games ahead of the second-place 
New York Yankees. Bender led the AL in winning % at .821, going 23-5 with 
a 1.58 ERA. He went 1-1 with 1.93 ERA in the World Series as the A's beat, 
in five games, the Chicago Cubs, who had gone 104-50 in the regular season. 
Bender pitched a complete-game three-hitter in the opener, striking out 
8 and giving up only one unearned run. He lost game 4 of the series in 
another complete game effort, 4-3 in 10 innings. Bender pitched all 9 2/3 
innings for the Athletics, striking out 6. In 1911 he led the AL in winning 
percentage again (.773), going 17-5 with a 2.16 ERA as the A's won their 
second consecutive AL pennant, going 101-50 and finishing 13 1/2 games 
ahead of the Detroit Tigers. In a rematch of the 1905 World Series, the 
Athletics got their revenge, defeating the New York Giants and becoming 
the first American League to win back-to-back World Series (the Chicago 
Cubs from the NL had won back-to-back titles in 1907 and 1908). After losing 
the opener 2-1 to Christy Mathewson, though pitching a complete game, giving 
up just 5 hits and 2 runs (1 earned run) and striking out 11, he returned 
in game 4, beating the Giants 4-2 on a complete game 7-hitter, and closed 
out the Series in game 6 with a 13-2 A's victory. Bender again went the 
distance (his 3rd complete game of the series), a 4-hit performance which 
he gave up no earned runs (the two Giants runs were unearned). He went 
2-1, with 1.04 ERA and 3 complete games in the series. In 1912 Bender was 
13-8 with a 2.74 ERA. He did not start for nearly 40 games late in the 
year and was suspended by the A's in September for alcohol abuse. His next 
contract had a clause saying he had to abstain from drinking to earn his 
full salary. In 1913 he went 21-10 with a 2.21 ERA, helping the A's win 
their third AL pennant in four years. They would also make it three World 
Series titles in four years by defeating the Giants in five games. Bender 
went 2-0 in the series with complete-game victories in games 1 and 4. He 
led the AL in winning percentage (.850) for the third time in 1914, going 
17-3 with a 2.26 ERA, and the A's would win their fourth AL pennant in 
five years. But the Philadelphia would be swept by the underdog Boston 
Braves, with Bender losing game one 7-1 and giving up 6 earned runs in 
5 1/3 innings. It was the only World Series game he failed to finish after 
completing his previous nine starts in the fall classic. When the Baltimore 
Terrapins of the upstart Federal League offered Bender a significant increase 
in salary, Mack knew he could not hope to match it and released him. Bender 
went 4-16 for the Terrapins and later regretted leaving Philadelphia. After 
two years with the Phillies, he left baseball in 1918 to work in the shipyards 
during World War I. Over his career, his win-loss record was 212-127, for 
a .625 winning percentage (a category in which he led the American League 
in three seasons) and a career 2.46 ERA. His talent was even more noticeable 
in the high-pressure environment of the World Series; in five trips to 
the championship series, he managed six wins and a 2.44 ERA, completing 
9 of the 10 games he started, putting him 2nd in World Series history behind 
Christy Mathewson. In the 1911 Series, he pitched three complete games 
to tie Christy Mathewson's record of three complete games in a World Series. 
He also threw a no-hitter on May 12, 1910 beating the Cleveland Indians 
4-0. In 1919, Bender pitched in the minor leagues for the Richmond Colts 
of the Virginia League. He earned a 29-2 record that year. He spent the 
next three seasons as a player-manager; the first two seasons were with 
the New Haven Weissmen/Indians, and the third was with the Class AA Reading 
Aces. For the 1920 New Haven team, Bender recorded 25 wins as a pitcher. 
His record declined to 13-7 in 1921 and 8-13 in 1922.[4] In 1923 and 1924, 
Bender did not manage but did pitch for the minor league Baltimore Orioles 
and the New Haven Profs, respectively. He went 6-3 with a 5.03 ERA for 
Baltimore, then went 6-4 with a 3.07 ERA for New Haven.[4] He came back 
to the majors as a coach for the Chicago White Sox (1925–26) and even made 
a cameo appearance on the mound in 1925. Between 1924 and 1928, Bender 
managed the baseball team at the United States Naval Academy.[5] He recorded 
a 42-34-2 record for the Naval Academy.[6] In 1931 he coached for the Giants 
and the next year managed the Yankee affiliate in the Central League. He 
then returned to the Athletics where he worked the rest of his life as 
a scout, minor league manager, and coach. Bender was nicknamed "Chief", 
a common nickname for baseball players of Native American descent.[7] Biographer 
Tom Swift writes that Bender "was often portrayed as a caricature and was 
the subject of myriad cartoons – many exhibits of narrow-mindedness. After 
he threw one of the most dominating games of the early years of the American 
League, Bender was depicted wielding a tomahawk and wearing a headdress 
as though he was a happy warrior."[8] He also faced discrimination on the 
field. Swift writes that taunting from the bench was common in Bender's 
era and that the opposition or the fans often made war whoops or yelled 
taunts such as "Nig!" or "Back to the reservation!" Bender usually remained 
calm, sometimes smiling at the insults. After an inning in which he had 
pitched particularly well, he might yell back, "Foreigners! Foreigners!"[9] 
Off the baseball field, Bender was one of several prominent baseball players 
who enjoyed trap shooting, bowling and golf.[10][11] He felt that shooting 
in the offseason helped to train his eye and increase his self-control. 
He worked in sporting goods at Wanamaker's in Philadelphia during his early 
playing days.[12] He opened his own store, Bender Sporting Goods, in 1914.[13] 
Bender's brother, John C. Bender, also played professional baseball. John 
Bender was suspended from minor league baseball for three years following 
the 1908 stabbing of his manager, Win Clark. Clark was stabbed in the torso 
several times. John Bender is sometimes erroneously described as having 
died on a baseball field, but he died at a restaurant in 1911, not long 
after attempting a professional baseball comeback.[14] Late in his life, 
Bender's friend John Burns gave him a plot of land in Haddon Heights, New 
Jersey. Bender planted a garden on the land and worked with it almost every 
day, even though he lived in Philadelphia. He grew a number of fruits and 
vegetables, especially corn, and either ate, sold or gave away what he 
grew.[15] After the 1950 season, Bender took his last position in the major 
leagues, replacing Mickey Cochrane as the pitching coach for the Athletics.[16] 
Bender's coaching helped pitcher Bobby Shantz to the American League Most 
Valuable Player Award in 1952.[17] Bender was struggling with health problems, 
including arthritis and a cancer he did not disclose, during his tenure 
with Philadelphia.[18] In his last days, Bender remained close friends 
with Athletics coach Bing Miller, who used to bring Bender a container 
of ice cream almost every day. Bender was hospitalized in Philadelphia 
in mid-April 1954. He died there on May 22, 1954 of prostate cancer. He 
had also been suffering from cardiac problems.[19] While he had been hospitalized, 
Bender sent Marie to Shibe Park for each home game so that she could report 
back to him on his team's pitching. Bender was buried in the Philadelphia 
suburb of Roslyn, Pennsylvania.[20] Bender was well liked by his fellow 
players. Longtime roommate and fellow pitcher Rube Bressler called him 
"one of the kindest and finest men who ever lived."[21] Ty Cobb called 
him the most intelligent pitcher he ever faced.[citation needed] Bender 
was also known as one of the best sign-stealers of his time; Mack often 
put this skill to use by occasionally using him as the third-base coach 
on days he wasn't scheduled to pitch.[citation needed] The innovator of 
the slider is debated, but some credit Bender as the first to use the pitch, 
then called a "nickel curve", in the 1910s.[22] Bender used his slider 
to help him achieve a no-hitter and win 212 games.[23] Bender was voted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953, less than one year before his death. 
He died before his induction ceremony and Marie accepted the Hall of Fame 
plaque on his behalf.[20] In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included
