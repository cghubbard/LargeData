The Milwaukee Brewers Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise of the National 
League has employed 18 managers and 8 general managers (GMs) during its 
46 seasons of play.[1][2] Established in Seattle, Washington as the Seattle 
Pilots in 1969, the team became the Milwaukee Brewers after relocating 
to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1970. The franchise played in the American League 
until 1998, when it moved to the National League as a part of MLB's realignment 
plan.[3] The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership 
on and off the field. In contrast, the general manager controls player 
transactions, hiring and firing of the coaching staff, and negotiates with 
players and agents regarding contracts. The team's first manager, Joe Schultz, 
stayed with the Pilots for the entire 1969 season, but was released before 
the move to Milwaukee. Buck Rodgers managed the team in 1981 when the Brewers 
won the American League second-half East Division title.[4] Due to the 
1981 Major League Baseball strike, the season was split into two halves. 
The winners of each half met in the league division series. Rodgers and 
Harvey Kuenn managed the Brewers in 1982, leading them to win the American 
League pennant.[5] Rodgers managed the team's first 47 games of the season 
before being fired and replaced by Kuenn.[6] In 2008, Ned Yost and Dale 
Sveum, who took over for the fired Yost for the team's last 12 regular 
season games, led the team to win the National League wild card.[6][7] 
Ken Macha managed the club for the 2009 and 2010 seasons but failed to 
lead the team to the playoffs. It was announced after the completion of 
the 2010 season that Macha's 2011 option would not be picked up.[8] Ron 
Roenicke was hired to replace Macha for the 2011 season.[9] Roenicke led 
the team to a franchise-best 96 wins during the 2011 season in addition 
to the Brewers' first NL Central title ever and first playoff series win 
since 1982.[10] On May 3, 2015, they fired manager Roenicke after a dismal 
7-18 start to the season.[11] The following day, Craig Counsell was named 
the 19th manager in team history. Counsell had worked in the Brewer's front 
office since 2012.[12] Phil Garner won 563 games from 1992 to 1999, giving 
him more wins than any other manager in franchise history.[1] Having managed 
the team for 1,180 games, he is also the longest-tenured manager in team 
history.[1] Harvey Kuenn's .576 winning percentage is the highest of all 
Brewers managers who have managed the team for more than one full season.[1] 
Conversely, the lowest winning percentage over a season or more is .395, 
by the team's first manager, Joe Schultz.[1] These records are correct
