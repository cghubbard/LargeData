Dan Baker (born September 22, 1946) is an American public address announcer 
best known for many years as the voice of Veterans Stadium, Lincoln Financial 
Field, and Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Baker has been the public 
address announcer for the Philadelphia Phillies since 1972 and Philadelphia 
Eagles from 1985 to 2014.[1][2] He has served as a PA voice for five World 
Series (1980, 1983, 1993, 2008 and 2009), two Major League Baseball All 
Star Games (1976 and 1996), and three NFC Championship Games (2002, 2003, 
and 2004). Though the Phillies and Eagles left Veterans Stadium for new 
venues (the Eagles to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003 and the Phillies 
to Citizens Bank Park in 2004), Baker remained the PA announcer for both 
teams. He also serves as PA announcer for the Army–Navy Game when it is 
played in Philadelphia as well as Drexel University Dragons men's basketball. 
After the 2009 retirement of the New York Yankees' Bob Sheppard, who was 
also PA announcer for the Eagles' biggest rival, New York Giants, Baker 
became the longest-tenured PA announcer in Major League Baseball.[2] Between 
Baker and former Chicago Cubs' public address announcer Pat Pieper, the 
2016 MLB season will mark 100 consecutive seasons that one of them has 
been announcing games. Pieper from 1916–1974 and Baker from 1972–present. 
The last game that was played without Pieper or Baker announcing games, 
was the 1915 World Series on October 13, 1915.[3] Baker was the radio announcer 
for Drexel University Dragons men's basketball on WNTP 990 AM from 1997–2012, 
after which he retired and became the team's public address announcer. 
Before that, he broadcast Philadelphia BIG 5 Basketball games for 21 years 
while additionally serving as its executive director from 1981–96. Baker 
was named to the Big 5 Hall of Fame in 1997 and was inducted into the Philadelphia 
Sports Hall of Fame in 2012. Baker co-hosts a radio show on WBCB (AM) 1490 
called "Bull Session" with former Philadelphia Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski, 
for whom the show is named after. The show airs at 6:00 pm on Monday nights 
and each week they bring in a special guest, usually a current or retired 
player.[4] Baker reprises his role as the Philadelphia Phillies PA announcer 
for select Phillies away games at multiple venues that comprise a chain 
of Philadelphia area sports bars. The events are billed as "Summer Nights 
with Dan Baker".[5] At these appearances, Baker announces the game over 
the sports bar's PA system in exactly the same fashion as he would if he 
was announcing an actual Phillies home game. On May 7, 2014, the Philadelphia 
Eagles announced that Baker would no longer serve as the public address 
announcer for the Eagles, citing that they decided to make a change in 
the role.[6] Baker will continue to be the public address announcer for 
the Phillies. On September 16, 2015, XFINITY Live! announced that Baker 
would be the in-house public address announcer for Philadelphia Eagles 
games. Baker's duties are similar to those he had as the public address 
announcer for the Eagles, which include energizing the crowd with his signature 
calls. For the 2015 season, Baker is scheduled to appear at 12 of the 16 
Eagles games and act as the public address announcer for the entire state-of-the-art 
venue which holds up to 5,000 fans.[7] Baker has been a resident of West
