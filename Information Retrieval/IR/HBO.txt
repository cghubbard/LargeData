Home Box Office (HBO) is an American premium cable and satellite television 
network that is owned by Time Warner through its respective flagship company 
Home Box Office, Inc. Programming featured on the network consists primarily 
of theatrically released motion pictures and original television series, 
along with made-for-cable movies and documentaries, boxing matches, and 
occasional stand-up comedy and concert specials. HBO is the oldest and 
longest continuously operating pay television service (basic or premium) 
in the United States, having been in operation since November 8, 1972. 
In 2014, HBO had an adjusted operating income of US$1.79 billion, compared 
to the US$1.68 billion it accrued in 2013.[2] As of July 2015, HBO's programming 
is available to approximately 36,483,000 households with at least one television 
set (31.3% of all cable, satellite and telco customers) in the United States 
(36,013,000 subscribers or 30.9% of all households with pay television 
service receive at least HBO's primary channel),[3] making it the second 
largest premium channel in the United States (Encore, owned by Starz Inc., 
reaches 40.54 million pay television households as of July 2015[update][3][4]). 
In addition to its U.S. subscriber base, HBO distributes content in at 
least 151 countries, covering approximately 122 million subscribers worldwide.[5] 
HBO subscribers generally pay for an extra tier of service that includes 
other cable- and satellite-exclusive channels even before paying for the 
channel itself (though HBO often prices all of its channels together in 
a single package). However, a law imposed by the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) requires that cable providers allow subscribers to get 
just "limited" basic cable (a base programming tier that includes local, 
and in some areas, out-of-market broadcast stations and public, educational, 
and government access channels) and premium services such as HBO, without 
subscribing to expanded service (Comcast is the only major provider to 
have purposefully offered the network in such a manner utilizing this law, 
as it offered a bundled cable/Internet package that included limited basic 
service and HBO from October 2013 to July 2014, or January of the latter 
year in some markets).[6][7][8] Cable providers can require the use of 
a converter box – usually digital – in order to receive HBO. HBO also provides 
its content through digital media; the channel maintains HBO Go, a video 
on demand streaming service available as a website and slate of mobile 
apps exclusively to existing subscribers of the linear channel suite and 
a separate, but similar standalone service, HBO Now, which launched in 
April 2015 as a subscription streaming platform that does not require a 
subscription to the HBO television service.[9][10] Many HBO programs have 
been syndicated to other networks and broadcast television stations (usually 
after some editing for running time and/or content that indecency regulations 
enforced by jurisdictional telecommunications agencies or self-imposed 
by network Standards and Practices departments may prohibit from airing 
on broadcast and cable networks), and a number of HBO-produced series and 
films have been released on DVD. Since HBO's more successful series (most 
notably shows such as Sex and the City, The Sopranos, The Wire, Entourage, 
Six Feet Under, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones and True Blood) air on 
over-the-air broadcasters in other countries (such as in Canada, Australia 
and much of Europe – including the United Kingdom), HBO's programming has 
the potential of being exposed to a higher percentage of the population 
of those countries compared to the United States. Because of the cost of 
HBO (which is the most expensive of the U.S. premium services, costing 
a monthly fee as of 2015[update] between $15 and $20 depending on the provider), 
many Americans only view HBO programs through DVDs or in basic cable or 
broadcast syndication – months or even years after these programs have 
first aired on the network – and with editing for both content and to allow 
advertising, although several series have filmed alternate "clean" scenes 
intended for syndication runs.[11] In 1965, Charles Dolan – who had already 
done pioneering work in the commercial use of cables and had developed 
Teleguide, a closed-circuit tourist information television system distributed 
to hotels in the New York metropolitan area – won a franchise to build 
a cable television system in the Lower Manhattan section of New York City.[12] 
The new system, which Dolan named "Sterling Information Services" (later 
to be known as Sterling Manhattan Cable, and eventually becoming the then 
Time Warner Cable which merged into Charter Communications in 2016), became 
the first urban underground cable television system in the United States. 
Rather than stringing cable on telephone poles or using microwave antennas 
to receive the signals, Sterling laid cable beneath the streets of Manhattan, 
because the tall buildings in the city blocked television signals and because 
the New York City Council had required that all electrical and telecommunication 
wiring be laid underground to limit service disruptions during bad weather, 
an ordinance that was passed after a blizzard in the early 20th century 
damaged telephone and telegraph lines in the area.[13] In that same year, 
Time-Life, Inc. purchased a 20% stake in Dolan's company.[14][15] Sterling 
Manhattan consistently lost money during its first six years of operation, 
because of the expense of running cable underground and into buildings 
throughout Manhattan (as much as $300,000 per mile) and a limited subscriber 
base, 400 of them by 1971. In the summer of 1971, while on a family vacation 
in France, Charles Dolan began to think of ideas to make Sterling Manhattan 
profitable. He came up with the concept for a cable-originated television 
service, called "The Green Channel". Dolan later presented his idea to 
Time-Life management; though satellite distribution seemed only a distant 
possibility at the time, he persuaded Time-Life to back him on the project.[13] 
To gauge whether consumers would be interested in subscribing to a pay 
television service, Time-Life sent out a direct-mail research brochure 
to residents in six U.S. cities. An overwhelming majority of those surveyed 
(approximately 99%) opposed the idea; 4% of those polled in a second survey, 
conducted by an independent consultant, said they were "almost certain" 
to subscribe to such a service. Time-Life later conducted a test in Allentown, 
Pennsylvania, in which salesmen presented the concept of a pay cable channel 
to residents by offering free service for the first month and a refundable 
installation fee; half of residents surveyed in the test expressed interest 
in purchasing the conceptual service.[13] In a meeting of Dolan and some 
Time-Life executives who were working on the project, various other names 
were discussed for the new service. They ultimately settled on calling 
it "Home Box Office", although the name was originally intended as a working 
title in order to meet deadlines to publish research brochures for the 
new service, with the belief that management would come up with a different 
name later.[13] Originally, Home Box Office was to debut on a Service Electric 
cable television system in Allentown; in order to avoid blackouts for NBA 
games that it was set to televise (Allentown was within the NBA's designated 
blackout radius for the Philadelphia 76ers' market area, under rules that 
the league had in effect at the time to protect ticket sales), Time-Life 
agreed to an offer by Service Electric president John Walson to launch 
the channel on its system in Wilkes-Barre (outside of the 76ers' DMA, in 
northeastern Pennsylvania).[13] Home Box Office launched on the evening 
of November 8, 1972.[citation needed] However, HBO's launch came without 
fanfare in the press, as it was not covered by any local or national media 
outlets. In addition, the city manager of Wilkes-Barre declined an offer 
to attend the launch ceremony, while Time Inc. president and chief executive 
officer J. Richard Munro was unable to attend as he was stranded in traffic 
while trying to exit Manhattan on the George Washington Bridge on his way 
to Wilkes-Barre.[16] The first program and movie distributed on the channel, 
the 1971 film Sometimes a Great Notion, starring Paul Newman and Henry 
Fonda, was transmitted that evening to 325 Service Electric subscribers 
in Wilkes-Barre (a plaque commemorating this event is located at Public 
Square in downtown Wilkes-Barre). Home Box Office distributed its first 
sports event immediately after the film: an NHL hockey game between the 
New York Rangers and the Vancouver Canucks from Madison Square Garden.[17][18] 
Four months later in February 1973, Home Box Office aired its first television 
special, the Pennsylvania Polka Festival.[19] Home Box Office would use 
a network of microwave relay towers to distribute its programming to cable 
systems throughout its service area.[17][20][21] Sterling Manhattan Cable 
continued to lose money because the company had only a small subscriber 
base of 20,000 customers in Manhattan. Dolan's media partner, Time-Life, 
Inc., gained control of Sterling when it acquired an additional 60% equity 
interest, increasing its stake in the company to 80%; Time-Life then decided 
to pull the plug on the Sterling Manhattan operation. Time-Life dropped 
the "Sterling" name and the company was renamed "Manhattan Cable Television" 
under Time-Life's control in March 1973.[12] Gerald Levin, who had been 
with Home Box Office since it began operations as its vice president of 
programming, replaced Dolan as the company's president and chief executive 
officer.[22] In September 1973, Time-Life, Inc. completed its acquisition 
of the pay service. At the time, Home Box Office's future looked dim: it 
only had 8,000 subscribers across 14 cable systems, all of which were located 
in Pennsylvania,[16] and it was suffering from a significant subscriber 
churn rate. HBO would eventually increase its fortunes within two years: 
by April 1975, the service had around 100,000 subscribers in Pennsylvania 
and New York state, and had begun to turn a limited profit.[16] Time-Life 
executives realized the problems in trying to expand Home Box Office's 
distribution footprint using microwave towers because of the time and expense 
that would be incurred in developing such a vast relay infrastructure, 
and began looking for cost-efficient methods of transmitting the channel 
nationally. In 1974, they settled on using a geostationary communications 
satellite to transmit HBO to cable providers throughout the United States. 
Other television broadcasters at the time were hesitant about uplinking 
their feeds to satellite due to fears that the satellites may inadvertently 
shut down or jettison out of their orbit, as well as due to the cost of 
purchasing downlink receiver dishes, which in 1974, were sold for as much 
as $75,000. Seeing satellite transmission as the only viable option to 
expand HBO's reach, Gerald Levin allocated $6.5 million to lease transponder 
space on the Westar 1 satellite for a five-year term.[16] The Time-Life 
board subsequently approved the plan to transmit HBO via satellite.[22] 
At 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on September 30, 1975, HBO became the first television 
network to continuously deliver its signal via satellite when it distributed 
the "Thrilla in Manila" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier; 
it was beamed to UA Columbia Cablevision's systems in Fort Pierce and Vero 
Beach, Florida, and American Television and Communications Corporation's 
Jackson, Mississippi system,[23] as well as those already carrying HBO 
in the northeastern United States.[16][20][24] Through the use of satellite, 
the channel began transmitting separate programming feeds for the Eastern 
and Pacific Time Zones, allowing the same programs that air first in the 
eastern half of the United States to air at accordant times in the western 
part of the country.[25] HBO switched its domestic satellite transmissions 
from Westar 1 to Satcom 1 in February 1976. By 1977, Ted Turner's Atlanta 
superstation WTCG-TV (soon to become WTBS) and Pat Robertson's CBN Satellite 
Service (later to become the present-day Freeform) had joined it, pioneering 
satellite delivery for the cable television industry.[20][26] By 1980, 
HBO was carried on cable providers in all 50 U.S. states.[16] HBO distributed 
its programming for only nine hours each day, from 3:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. 
Eastern Time, during its first nine years of operation. The network first 
adopted a 24-hour schedule on weekends in September 1981, running from 
3:00 p.m. on Friday afternoons until 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday 
nights/early Monday mornings; this round-the-clock schedule was expanded 
to weekdays three months later on December 28, 1981 (however, HBO was not 
the first pay television network to maintain an uninterrupted programming 
schedule as Showtime and The Movie Channel had both switched to 24-hour 
daily schedules months earlier). By this time, the full "Home Box Office" 
name was de-emphasized by the network, in favor of branding solely by the 
"HBO" initialism (although the full name is still used as the legal corporate 
name of its parent division under Time Warner, and in on-air use within 
copyright tags featured during the closing credits of the channel's original 
programs and a legal disclaimer slide seen daily on its primary and multiplex 
channels).[citation needed] In 1983, HBO premiered its first original movie, 
The Terry Fox Story, a biopic about the Canadian runner who embarked on 
a cross-country run across Canada to raise money and awareness for cancer 
research; the film was also the first movie ever produced for pay television. 
That year also saw the premiere of the first children's program to be distributed 
on the channel: Fraggle Rock (that series' creator, Jim Henson, had earlier 
produced the special Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, which won an ACE 
Award in 1978[19]). HBO continued to air various original programs aimed 
at children until 2001, when these programs almost completely moved over 
to HBO Family (which continued to occasionally distributed its own slate 
of original children's programming until 2003).[27] HBO became involved 
in several lawsuits during the 1980s, involving legal statutes imposed 
by state and city laws that would have resulted in some programs on HBO 
and other pay television networks being censored by cable systems, if not 
forcing the pay services to edit inappropriate content from the programming 
they aired. In January 1986, HBO became the first satellite-delivered television 
network to encrypt its signal from unauthorized viewing by way of the Videocipher 
II system; this initially resulted in a mass lodge of complaints from television 
receive-only (TVRO) satellite users that previously received HBO's programming 
without a subscription.[25] The objections by TVRO users over having to 
now pay for HBO as cable subscribers had long done (requiring dish subscribers 
to purchase an expensive descrambler to unencrypt the signal) came to a 
head four months later, as HBO became a victim of broadcast signal intrusion 
when satellite television dealer John R. MacDougall, a Florida man calling 
himself "Captain Midnight", redirected a receiver dish towards the network's 
transponder on Galaxy 1 and intercepted its signal during a movie presentation 
of The Falcon and the Snowman; MacDougall overrode the telecast of the 
film with a text-based message placed over SMPTE color bars in protest 
of the channel's decision to scramble its signal for home satellite subscribers. 
The Federal Communications Commission subsequently prosecuted MacDougall 
for committing the intrusion. In 1988, HBO's subscriber base expanded greatly 
as a result of the Writers Guild of America strike that year, as the channel 
had new programming in its inventory during a period in which the broadcast 
networks were only able to air reruns of their shows. In 1989, HBO compared 
its programming against rival pay television network Showtime, with the 
slogan "Simply the Best", using the Tina Turner single "The Best" as part 
of the network's on-air image campaign.[28] On January 2, 1989, HBO launched 
Selecciones en Español de HBO y Cinemax ("Spanish Selections from HBO and 
Cinemax") – an alternate Spanish-language feed of HBO and Cinemax. The 
service, which initially launched on 20 cable systems in markets with significant 
populations of Spanish speakers,[29] originally only carried Spanish audio 
simulcasts of live boxing matches televised by HBO (except for certain 
events that were already distributed in Spanish on networks such as Galavisión), 
dubbed versions of recent feature film releases from HBO's movie suppliers 
and first-run Spanish-language movies (mostly from Mexico, Argentina and 
Spain), but later added Spanish dubs of films and other programs distributed 
by HBO. Selecciones – which was offered in tandem with HBO, although it 
operated as a separate service – utilized the second audio program auxiliary 
channel to distribute its Spanish audio feeds. Selecciones en Español de 
HBO y Cinemax became successful to the point that it added 35 additional 
cable systems to its list of carriers within a few weeks after its debut.[29] 
Selecciones en Español became HBO en Español on September 27, 1993.[30] 
Taking advantage of HBO's successes, Warner Communications (which ironically 
was part-owner of one of the network's pay-cable competitors, The Movie 
Channel, from its launch in 1973 until joint venture group Warner-Amex 
Satellite Entertainment sold its stake in the channel to Viacom in 1986) 
merged with HBO parent Time Inc. in 1989 to create Time Warner, which as 
of 2016[update], remains the parent company of the network.[31] In 1991, 
HBO and Cinemax became the first premium services to offer multiplexed 
channels to cable customers with the launches of HBO2, HBO3 and Cinemax 
2 on three cable systems in Wisconsin, Kansas and Texas.[32] In 1993, HBO 
became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.[33] 
The move proved successful, eventually resulting in HBO and Cinemax starting 
up additional multiplex channels of both services – starting with the December 
1996 launch of HBO Family and concluding with the launch of four Cinemax 
channels in 2001: WMax (now MovieMax), @Max (now Cinemáx), OuterMax and 
5StarMax. During the 1990s, HBO began to experience increasing success 
with its original series such as Tales from the Crypt, Dream On, Tracey 
Takes On..., Mr. Show with Bob and David and Arliss. One such program, 
The Larry Sanders Show, arguably became HBO's flagship series during that 
decade and although it was not commercially as successful as programs that 
aired on the Big Three networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) and Fox, the show did 
enjoy a cult status and critical acclaim, and received nominations and 
wins for many major television awards (including Primetime Emmy Awards 
and Golden Globe Awards).[34] The series ranked #38 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest 
TV Shows of All Time (becoming the only HBO comedy series to make the list)[35] 
and was also included in Time's list of the "100 Best TV Shows of All Time".[36] 
The Larry Sanders Show was also ranked by various critics and fans as one 
of the best TV comedies of the 1990s.[37] The original programs that HBO 
has developed since the early 1990s have earned the channel numerous nominations 
for and wins of Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.[38] One aspect as to the 
perceived higher quality of these shows is due to both the quality of the 
writing on the programs and the fact that as a subscription-only service, 
HBO does not carry "normal" commercials; instead the network runs promotions 
for upcoming HBO programs and behind-the-scenes featurettes between programs. 
This relieves HBO from some pressures to tone down controversial aspects 
of its programs, and allows for more explicit content to be incorporated 
into its shows that would not be allowed to air on broadcast television 
or basic cable, such as profanity, strong/graphic violence, nudity and 
graphic sex scenes. Beginning with the 1997 launch of its first one-hour 
dramatic narrative series Oz, HBO started a trend that became commonplace 
with premium cable services. Although critically acclaimed, it was not 
until The Sopranos premiered in 1999, that the network achieved both mass 
critical and Emmy success. The Sopranos – centering on mob patriarch Tony 
Soprano (James Gandolfini) and his family – received 111 Emmy nominations 
during its six-season run, resulting in 21 wins, two of them for Outstanding 
Drama Series. 1998 saw the debut of From the Earth to the Moon, a 12-part 
miniseries that was produced by Tom Hanks, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer 
and based on the Andrew Chaikin book A Man on the Moon. Costing $68 million 
to produce, it traced the U.S. space program from the U.S./U.S.S.R. space 
race through the final moon landing, Apollo 17. From the Earth to the Moon 
won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries, and helped spur other HBO 
miniseries based on historical events such as 61*, Band of Brothers, John 
Adams and The Pacific. That year also saw the debut of the comedy series 
Sex and the City, which was based on the book series of the same name by 
Candace Bushnell; over the course of its six-season run, the show – centering 
on the friendship and romances of four New York City women[39] – received 
54 Emmy nominations, winning seven, including one win for Outstanding Comedy 
Series. In 1999, HBO became the first U.S. cable channel to operate a high-definition 
simulcast feed.[40] In July 2001, HBO launched HBO on Demand, the first 
premium subscription video-on-demand enhancement in the United States, 
to Time Warner Cable subscribers in Columbia, South Carolina.[41] In 2002, 
HBO debuted The Wire, which, although not surpassing The Sopranos in viewership 
success, did however match its critical acclaim over its five-season run[citation 
needed] and further cemented HBO's reputation as being a network that produced 
quality programming. HBO experienced another success among viewers in 2008, 
with the debut of True Blood, a vampire drama based on a series of gothic 
novels by Charlaine Harris. The network saw three more hit series in the 
2010s with Game of Thrones, based on George R. R. Martin's fantasy novel 
series A Song of Ice and Fire, which earned both critical and viewer praise; 
Girls, a comedy series created by series star Lena Dunham; and True Detective, 
an anthology-style series – structured to feature a different cast and 
setting within each season's storyline – which initially saw established 
film actors Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in its lead roles.[42] 
On August 13, 2015, HBO announced its re-entry into children's programming, 
when it reached a five-year programming and development deal with Sesame 
Workshop. Through the agreement, HBO obtained first-run television rights 
to Sesame Street, beginning with the January 2016 debut of its 46th season 
(with episodes being distributed to the program's longtime broadcaster, 
PBS, following a nine-month exclusivity window at no charge to its member 
stations); Sesame Workshop will also produce original children's programming 
content for the channel, which will also gain exclusive streaming rights 
to the company's programming library for HBO Go and HBO Now (assuming those 
rights from Amazon Video, Netflix and Sesame Workshop's in-house subscription 
streaming service, Sesame Go, the latter of which will cease to operate 
as a standalone offering). Although struck with the intent to having the 
show remain on PBS in some fashion, the nonprofit production company reached 
the deal due to cutbacks resulting from declines in public and private 
donations, distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing 
for merchandise sales.[43][44][45][46] In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became 
the first premium services to offer multiplexed services to cable customers 
as companions to the main network, offering additional channels of the 
two services to three TeleCable-operated systems in Overland Park, Kansas, 
Racine, Wisconsin and the Dallas suburbs of Richardson and Plano, Texas.[47] 
The first two multiplex channels – HBO2 and HBO3 – launched as part of 
this test by the TeleCable systems. The following year, research from ACNielsen 
revealed that multiplex delivery of HBO and Cinemax had a positive impact 
on subscriber usage and attitudes, including aiding in the retention of 
pay cable subscriptions by its subscribers.[48] The HBO multiplex would 
later expand in December 1996, with the launch of HBO Family, focusing 
on family-oriented feature films and television series aimed at younger 
children.[49] The HBO multiplex channels became collectively marketed under 
the brand name "HBO The Works" in April 1998 (the Cinemax channels concurrently 
began to be marketed as "MultiMax"), coinciding with the name change of 
HBO2 as HBO Plus (the channel would ultimately restore the HBO2 name in 
September 2002), and the rebranding and format change of HBO3 as HBO Signature 
(a network aimed at women). In May 1999, two more channels launched: HBO 
Comedy (featuring comedic films and series, along with stand-up comedy 
specials) and HBO Zone (a network aimed at young adults).[50] Just over 
a year later in October 2000, the Spanish language network HBO Latino debuted, 
featuring a mix of dubbed simulcasts of the main HBO channel's programming 
and Spanish programs that are exclusive to the channel. "HBO The Works" 
continued in use as the brand for the HBO multiplex until 2004. Individually, 
the HBO multiplex channel suite has no "official" marketed name as of 2016[update], 
although HBO and Cinemax's respective multiplex packages are marketed collectively 
as the "HBO/MAX Pak".[51] HBO Family and HBO Latino had the distinction 
of being the only multiplex channels of HBO that have their own websites, 
as all of the others were integrated within the main HBO site; the separate 
sites and sections for both channels were eliminated in 2010, around the 
time the HBO Go service was launched. Depending on the service provider, 
HBO provides up to thirteen multiplex channels – seven 24-hour multiplex 
channels, all of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high 
definition – as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (HBO On 
Demand). HBO broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern 
and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel 
are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the 
east and west coast feeds of the main HBO channel, as well as HBO2 in some 
cases), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular 
movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at 
most. The premium film service Cinemax, which is also owned by Time Warner 
through Home Box Office Inc., operates as a separate service from HBO; 
although HBO is very frequently sold together in a package with Cinemax, 
subscribers to one of the services do not necessarily have to subscribe 
to the other. HBO Family is HBO's third (and only successful) venture at 
a family-oriented pay service: two similarly formatted standalone mini-pay 
services that were launched by the network, Take 2 in 1979 and Festival 
in 1987, both ceased operations after short existences. Despite being a 
premium service, cable providers have occasionally used HBO Family to temporarily 
replace television stations that were dropped due to carriage disputes 
with providers such as during Hearst Television's 2012 dispute with Time 
Warner Cable that resulted in TWC's associated Bright House Networks system 
substituting independent station WMOR-TV with the channel in Tampa, Florida,[55] 
and a dispute between Cox Communications and LIN TV in which HBO Family 
temporarily replaced Fox affiliate WVBT from Cox's Hampton Roads, Virginia 
system from January to February 2000.[56] On August 1, 1980, HBO launched 
Cinemax, a companion movie-based premium channel[58] created as HBO's answer 
to fellow movie-oriented pay service The Movie Channel (which operated 
as a standalone service at the time). Unlike HBO, Cinemax maintained a 
24-hour schedule from its launch. The channel succeeded early on partly 
due to its reliance on movie classics from the 1950s to the 1970s – with 
some more recent films mixed in – that would be presented uncut and without 
commercial interruption, at a time when cable subscribers only received 
about three dozen channels due to limited headend channel capacity. In 
most cases, cable operators sold Cinemax and HBO as a single package, usually 
offered at a discount for customers that chose to subscribe to both channels. 
In its early years, Cinemax carried music specials and some limited original 
programming such as Second City Television and Max Headroom in addition 
to movies, but the network subsequently become known among its subscribers 
for airing softcore adult films and series during the late night hours 
that contain strong sexual content and nudity (broadcasts of such programs 
are restricted from airing on the main Cinemax channel before 11:30 p.m. 
Eastern Time),[59][60] and eventually began producing original action series 
in August 2011.[60] Beginning with the launch of Cinemax 2 (now MoreMax) 
in 1991, Cinemax has gradually launched its own set of multiplex services; 
as of 2015[update], in addition to its main feed and MoreMax, Cinemax operates 
five additional channels: ActionMax (which originally launched as Cinemax 
3 in 1995); ThrillerMax (which launched in 1998);[50] MovieMax (which originally 
launched as WMax in 2001); Cinemáx (a Spanish language simulcast feed, 
which originally launched as the separately formatted @Max in 2001) and 
5StarMax (which originally launched in 2001).[61][62][63] HBO HD is a high 
definition simulcast feed of HBO that broadcasts in the 1080i[verification 
needed] resolution format.[1] In addition to its main channel, HBO also 
operates high definition simulcast feeds of its six multiplex channels. 
HBO HD is available on most major cable providers including Cox Communications; 
DirecTV; Charter Communications; Time Warner Cable; Dish Network; Comcast; 
AT&T U-verse; Optimum; and Verizon FiOS, although few providers offer all 
seven multiplex channels in HD. The main channel first began broadcasting 
in high definition on March 6, 1999.[40] HBO on Demand is the channel's 
subscription video-on-demand service; launched on July 1, 2001 on Time 
Warner Cable's Columbia, South Carolina system, it was the first subscription 
VOD service offered by a premium channel in the United States.[41] HBO 
on Demand offers a selection of movies, original series and specials previously 
seen on the network.[64] The service is provided at no additional cost 
to HBO subscribers, who already regularly pay a premium fee to cable and 
satellite providers to receive access to the channel. HBO launched the 
VOD service in an effort to allow subscribers access to the channel's programming 
on their own schedules, thereby reducing the frequency in which viewers 
were unable to find a program they would like to watch as well as limiting 
cancellations to the service for that same reason. HBO on Demand features 
a rotating selection of films, specials and series, with select new titles 
added each Friday alongside existing program titles held over from the 
previous one to two weeks. The standard definition and high definition 
versions of the HBO on Demand service are available on most cable and satellite 
providers, delivered to customers who subscribe to the linear HBO channels 
at no additional charge. On January 3, 2011, HBO became the first premium 
channel and the first cable network to offer a 3D-only VOD service as it 
launched a subscription video on demand service offering select feature 
films in 3D to Time Warner Cable, Comcast and Verizon FiOS customers who 
subscribe to the HBO service.[65] In the United Kingdom, a domestic version 
of HBO on Demand launched on TalkTalk TV in 2015, available through the 
provider's box sets as a strictly buy-and-keep service. On February 18, 
2010, HBO launched HBO Go, a service that carries 1,000 hours of program 
content available for streaming in standard or high definition, intended 
as a TV Everywhere service available only to existing subscribers of the 
linear HBO television channels (a requirement necessary to access its content 
via streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and select video game 
consoles, as well as via its website and mobile apps). Content available 
on HBO Go includes theatrically released films as well as HBO original 
programs, movies, comedy specials, documentaries, sports and late night 
adult programming.[66] On October 15, 2014, HBO announced plans to launch 
an over-the-top subscription video on demand service in 2015, which would 
be distributed as a standalone offering that does not require an existing 
television subscription to use.[67][68][69] The service, HBO Now, was unveiled 
on March 9, 2015, and officially launched one month later on April 7.[10][70][71][72] 
The service was initially available via Apple Inc. to Apple TV and iOS 
devices for a three-month exclusivity period following its formal launch, 
before becoming available for subscription through other participating 
Internet service providers.[10][70] Available for $15 per month, HBO Now 
is identical to HBO Go in terms of content and features. New episodes of 
HBO series are made available for streaming the same day, and usually at 
the same time, as their original broadcast on the main linear HBO channel. 
Apple's App Store features promotions offering free one-month trials or 
other incentives to subscribe to HBO Now, as the program is in partnership 
with Apple Inc. and Apple TV.[73] HBO's programming schedule currently 
consists largely of theatrically released feature films – which occupy 
the majority of its daily schedule – and original series primarily aimed 
at adults (including, as of April 2016[update], dramas such as Game of 
Thrones and The Leftovers, and comedies such as Girls, Veep, Ballers, Last 
Week Tonight, Silicon Valley and Vinyl). In addition, HBO also carries 
original made-for-TV movies, sports events and sports-centric documentary 
and magazine series, documentary films, behind-the-scenes specials, and 
concert and stand-up comedy specials. The network primarily airs most of 
its original programs on its main channel after 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific 
Time, although it airs select original series and made-for-cable movies 
as well as certain documentaries during the daytime hours; these programs 
also air at various times on HBO's multiplex channels. HBO Signature, HBO 
Family, HBO Comedy and HBO Zone also each carry archived HBO programming, 
airing repeats of former original series and specials dating back to the 
1990s. HBO has long maintained a policy not to run R-rated films on its 
primary channel between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time;[74][75] 
this policy (which may have once stemmed from HBO's availability on analog 
cable tiers, while its multiplex channels generally required a digital 
cable subscription or at least scrambling) remains in place as of 2016[update], 
despite the existence of the V-chip and other premium services having incorporated 
R-rated films onto their daytime schedules starting in the mid-1980s. The 
policy was also applied to all TV-MA rated programs after the TV Parental 
Guidelines were implemented on January 1, 1997; however the main HBO channel 
began airing a limited amount of TV-MA rated original series, movies and 
documentaries that contain some strong profanity and violence, but are 
largely devoid of nudity, and graphic violent or sexual content on weekends 
before 8:00 p.m. Eastern in 2010.[76] However, HBO does occasionally rebroadcast 
R-rated films as early as 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time as part of its Sunday 
rebroadcast of the prior Saturday's movie premiere telecast, depending 
on the length of the film and the scheduling of any HBO original series 
that air after it. Outside of HBO Family, which does not run any programs 
with either a TV-MA or R rating,[77] HBO's other multiplex channels will 
air TV-MA and R-rated programming during morning and afternoon time periods. 
HBO also does not typically allow most NC-17 rated films to be aired on 
the primary channel or its multiplex channels. HBO pioneered the free preview 
concept – which has since become a standard in the pay television industry 
– in 1973, as part of a plan to increase subscribership of the channel.[78] 
Cable providers were originally granted permission to carry HBO on a local 
origination channel in order for those who are not subscribers the ability 
to view the channel for a limited number of days; with the advent of digital 
cable and satellite, providers now unencrypt the designated slots of each 
HBO channel during preview periods. Until the mid-1990s, on-air promotions 
featured between programs were replaced (and later, merely interspersed) 
with interstitials featuring on-air hosts asking viewers to subscribe to 
the service. Although participation was voluntary,[79] preview events are 
carried by most major and some smaller pay television providers (the number 
of providers and the providers that choose to offer the event varies depending 
on the given free preview period, and may not be carried on all systems 
owned by a multiple system operator unless at the provider's discretion); 
HBO currently offers between three and five preview events each year to 
participating providers (which are normally scheduled to coincide with 
the premiere of a new or returning original series, and in the past, a 
high-profile special or feature film). The network also produces short 
segments promoting new movies with the cooperation of the film studios 
that hold releasing rights to the projects. These usually consist of either 
interstitial segments providing a behind-the-scenes look at the making 
of an upcoming/recently released film, with interviews with the actors 
and principal crew, or red carpet coverage, which are almost universally 
produced by studios with which HBO and Cinemax maintain exclusive premium 
television broadcast rights. Depending on their length or content, these 
are either aired as part of the feature segment HBO News (formerly titled 
HBO Entertainment News from 1988 to 2007), which airs during extended promotional 
breaks between programs and runs between three and five minutes, or as 
part of HBO First Look, a series of documentary-style interstitial specials 
(usually running 15 to 20 minutes in length, with no set schedule) that 
debuted in 1992. These segments, particularly episodes of First Look, have 
also often been included as bonus features on DVD and Blu-ray releases 
of the films that were profiled (many of which have aired on HBO and Cinemax 
once they reached their pay-cable distribution windows), though broadcasts 
of these interstitials have begun to be reduced to only a few episodes 
per year as HBO has focused on its higher-profile, long-form original programming 
instead and studios have internally produced behind-the-scenes featurettes 
for their films for exclusive physical and digital media release. During 
the "Executive Actions" symposium held by The Washington Post and George 
Washington University in April 2015 (shortly after the launch of the HBO 
Now streaming service), HBO CEO Richard Plepler said that he does not want 
the network to be akin to Netflix in which users "binge watch" its television 
shows and film content, saying "I don't think it would have been a great 
thing for HBO or our brand if that had been gobbled up in the first week[...] 
I think it was very exciting for the viewer to have that mystery held out 
for an extended period of time." Pleper cited that he feels that binge 
watching does not correlate with the culture of HBO and HBO watchers.[80] 
Since the early 1980s, HBO has produced original programming, which include 
dramatic and comedic series, in addition to its slate of theatrical films. 
Most of these shows are intended for adults (and, with limited exceptions, 
are typically assigned TV-MA ratings), often featuring high amounts of 
profanity, violence, sexual themes and/or nudity that would be much more 
difficult to get on basic cable or over-the-air broadcast channels, out 
of fear of losing sponsors. However some of its original programs, primarily 
those produced before 2001, have also been aimed at families or children; 
most of these type of programs have migrated to HBO Family, though HBO 
has produced very few newer family-oriented series for either channel since 
that point. In a notable example, HBO ventured back into children's programming 
with its acquisition of the first-run and streaming rights to Sesame Street, 
a long-running children's television series that had previously aired on 
PBS for the vast majority of its run, in the aforementioned deal with Sesame 
Workshop that was announced in August 2015.[43] In addition to maintaining 
rights to films from various distributors, HBO also produces its own made-for-cable 
movies through HBO Films; the film division, originally named HBO Pictures, 
began producing original movies for the network in 1983 with the debut 
of The Terry Fox Story. Unlike most television films produced for cable 
television, most of the original movies produced by HBO have featured major 
film actors over the years, ranging from James Stewart to Michael Douglas. 
The channel also produces stand-up comedy specials, which were formerly 
broadcast under the On Location, HBO Comedy Hour and HBO Comedy Half-Hour 
banners, which periodically premiere on certain Saturday nights when a 
boxing match or movie is not scheduled during the late prime time slots. 
One of HBO's first successful specials was The Bette Midler Show in 1976, 
which launched the Standing Room Only concert series. For a time in the 
early 1980s, HBO produced a concert special almost every other month, featuring 
major music stars such as Boy George and The Who. After MTV's successful 
rollout in 1981, the Standing Room Only series began to produce fewer concerts, 
but focused more on "world class" music events featuring artists such as 
Elton John, Tina Turner and Barbra Streisand, as well as fundraisers such 
as Farm Aid.[19] The On Location comedy specials, which presented a stand-up 
comedian's performance in its entirety and uncut, began in 1975 with a 
special starring Robert Klein. The first of twelve concert specials televised 
by the network featuring George Carlin aired on HBO in 1977 as part of 
On Location, featuring Carlin's first televised performance of his classic 
routine, "The Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television".[19] As other 
cable channels incorporated comedy specials due to their inexpensive format, 
HBO began to model its strategy with its comedy specials after its music 
programming, focusing on a few specials each year featuring popular comedians.[19] 
As of May 2016[update], HBO – as well as its sister channel Cinemax – maintains 
exclusive first-run film licensing agreements with network sister company 
Warner Bros. Entertainment (including content from subsidiaries Warner 
Bros. Animation, New Line Cinema since 2005, and Castle Rock Entertainment),[81] 
20th Century Fox since 1979 (including content from subsidiaries 20th Century 
Fox Animation, Blue Sky Studios, New Regency Productions, and Fox Searchlight 
Pictures),[82] Universal Studios since 2003 (including content from subsidiaries 
Universal Animation Studios, Working Title Films, Illumination Entertainment 
and Focus Features),[83][84] Summit Entertainment since 2013,[85] and DreamWorks 
since 1996 (excluding films that DreamWorks co-produces in conjunction 
with Touchstone Pictures, with rights to live action co-productions by 
the two studios being held by Showtime).[86][87] The first-run film output 
agreement with Fox was renewed by HBO for ten years on August 15, 2012 
(with a provision allowing the studio to release its films through digital 
platforms such as iTunes and Amazon during a film's term of license with 
the channel for the first time),[88] and the Universal output deal was 
renewed for ten years on January 6, 2013 (with the exception of certain 
animated films that HBO can offer to pass over to the Netflix streaming 
service).[89] The first-run output deal with Summit Entertainment was renewed 
by HBO for an additional four years on March 1, 2016.[90] Since 2008, HBO 
also holds exclusive pay cable rights to its own in-house theatrical films 
made through HBO Films. HBO also shows sub-runs – runs of films that have 
already received broadcast or syndicated television airings – of theatrical 
films from Paramount Pictures (including content from subsidiary Republic 
Pictures, both for films released prior to 2003), Walt Disney Studios Motion 
Pictures (including content from subsidiaries Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone 
Pictures, Hollywood Pictures, and former subsidiary and current independently 
operated studio Miramax Films), Sony Pictures Entertainment (including 
content from subsidiaries Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Classics, Screen 
Gems and former HBO sister company TriStar Pictures, all for films released 
prior to 2005), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (including content from subsidiaries 
United Artists, Orion Pictures and The Samuel Goldwyn Company), and Lions 
Gate Entertainment (for films released prior to 2004).[91] Films to which 
HBO holds the pay cable rights will usually also run on Cinemax during 
their licensing term, although some feature films from the aforementioned 
studios that the two channels have broadcast rights to will make their 
premium television debut on HBO several weeks before their premiere on 
Cinemax and vice versa. During the early years of premium cable, it was 
not uncommon for multiple pay television services, including HBO, Showtime 
and The Movie Channel (and later, Cinemax), to hold broadcast rights to 
the same feature films. HBO began purchasing exclusive rights to broadcast 
select individual films in the late 1970s; these gradually expanded to 
exclusive output deals (which are commonplace with North American premium 
channels to this day), in which a pay service enters into a licensing agreement 
to broadcast movies from a particular film studio over a period of years. 
HBO signed its first major exclusive film output deal with Columbia Pictures 
in the early 1980s.[92] During the 1980s, HBO also held rights to films 
from TriStar Pictures (whose output deal with HBO, as well as that with 
Columbia Pictures, expired after 2004) and Orion Pictures;[93][94] as of 
February 2013, rival premium channel Starz has an exclusive deal with Sony 
Pictures Entertainment, and is the rightsholder to all newer films from 
Columbia and TriStar.[95] Films released by Paramount Pictures between 
mid-1988 and late 1997 were broadcast on HBO;[96] rival premium channel 
Showtime assumed pay television rights to Paramount-released films in 1998, 
and held them until 2008, with the rights being turned over to upstart 
pay service Epix (which Paramount and its corporate parent Viacom partially 
owns) the following year.[97][98] HBO relinquished its deal with DreamWorks 
Pictures to broadcast its live-action films at the end of 2010, when the 
distribution rights shifted from Paramount Pictures to Touchstone Pictures 
(whose films are broadcast by Showtime through a distribution agreement 
with the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group).[99] HBO's contract with DreamWorks 
Animation expired after 2012, at which time Netflix assumed pay television 
rights to that studio's releases.[100] HBO broadcasts a limited amount 
of sports programming as well as sports-related discussion and documentary 
series produced by the channel's HBO Sports division; HBO – through its 
parent holding company Home Box Office Inc. – also operates HBO PPV (formerly 
TVKO), which serves as a distributor of major boxing events for pay-per-view. 
HBO's first sports broadcast was of a New York Rangers-Vancouver Canucks 
NHL game, transmitted to a Service Electric cable system in Wilkes-Barre, 
Pennsylvania on November 8, 1972; the channel continued to air select NHL 
hockey games through the mid-1970s. HBO has long been known for its telecasts 
of boxing matches (which usually air on Saturday nights every two to three 
weeks on average), including those shown on its flagship sports program 
HBO World Championship Boxing. On September 30, 1975, the "Thrilla in Manila" 
boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier aired on HBO and was 
the first program on the pay cable network to be broadcast via satellite. 
That same year, HBO began airing coverage of Wimbledon; it held contractual 
rights to coverage of the tennis tournament through 1999, when it lost 
the rights to sister network TNT (owned by Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting 
System subsidiary). In 1973, HBO aired a World Wide Wrestling Federation 
event from Madison Square Garden, headlined by a match between George Steele 
and Pedro Morales. During the mid-1970s, HBO aired several basketball games 
from the National Basketball Association and the American Basketball Association 
(notably, the last ABA Finals game in 1976, prior to the latter league's 
merger with the NBA, between the New York Nets and the Denver Nuggets). 
HBO also aired Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) events during the 
1970s; Dick Stockton served as the play-by-play announcer and Skee Foremsky 
acted as the color commentator for the bowling telecasts.[101] In 1977, 
HBO premiered the channel's longest-running program, and its first sports-related 
documentary and analysis series Inside the NFL, featuring game reviews 
of National Football League games from the previous week of the league 
season as well as interviews with players, coaches and team management; 
HBO canceled the program in February 2008 after 30 seasons (the program 
was later acquired by rival premium channel Showtime, which began airing 
the series in September 2008). HBO expanded its boxing slate in September 
1996, with the launch of Boxing After Dark, a program which showcases fights 
from up-and-coming boxing talents. The network would build upon Inside 
the NFL with debut of additional sports talk and documentary programs: 
Race for the Pennant (concerning the Major League Baseball season, running 
from 1978 to 1992), Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel (which debuted in 1998), 
On the Record with Bob Costas (which debuted in 2001, and was revamped 
as Costas Now in 2005, ending in 2009), and Joe Buck Live (which ran for 
one season in 2009). In 2001, HBO and NFL Films began to jointly produce 
the documentary series Hard Knocks, which follows an individual NFL team 
each season during training camp and their preparations for the upcoming 
football season.[19][102] HBO Sports has been headed by several well-known 
television executives over the years, including its founder Steve Powell 
(later head of programming at ESPN), Dave Meister (later head of the Tennis 
Channel), Seth Abraham (later head of MSG Network),[19] and Ross Greenburg. 
Many of HBO's documentary series appear under the America Undercover brand, 
the regular features of which have been Real Sex (a late night magazine-formatted 
series of specials that ran from 1992 to 2009, which frankly explored a 
variety of mainstream and non-mainstream sexual matters[19]) and Autopsy. 
One of the most notable America Undercover specials was 1985's Soldiers 
in Hiding, focusing on homeless veterans of the Vietnam War living in the 
wilderness, which won the first Academy Award for a cable television service 
in the Best Documentary category (although HBO has had some of its documentaries 
enter limited theatrical release to qualify for Oscar nominations in later 
years).[19] HBO is also noted for its Sports of the 20th Century documentary 
brand. One of its most recent documentaries was Dare to Dream, about the 
U.S. Women's Soccer Team and their effort to make a difference, and featured 
Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, Brandi Chastain, Joy Fawcett and Julie Foudy. 
HBO's first successful documentary aired in 1979, the six-part series Time 
Was, which featured host Dick Cavett being inserted into seminal events 
occurring between the 1920s and the 1970s. 1981's She's Nobody's Baby, 
produced by Ms. magazine, was another well-known documentary tracing the 
evolution in the societal role of American women during the 20th Century; 
the special earned HBO the first Peabody Award won by a pay television 
service.[103] Since then, the network has brought home numerous Peabody 
Awards for its documentary films.[104] HBO had also broadcast informational 
documentaries produced in partnership with Consumer Reports starting in 
1980, focusing on subjects from product safety to finance to health.[19] 
One such documentary, AIDS: Everything You and Your Family Need to Know…But 
Were Afraid to Ask, which aired in 1987 at the height of the AIDS epidemic 
in the U.S., provided factual information on AIDS and HIV and was hosted 
by then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.[19] In 2004, guided by human rights 
activist Ansar Burney, an HBO team for Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel used 
a hidden camera to document slavery and torture in secret desert camps 
where boys under the age of five were trained to race camels, a national 
sport in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This half-hour investigative report 
exposed a carefully hidden child slavery ring that bought or kidnapped 
hundreds of young boys in Pakistan and Bangladesh, who were then forced 
to become camel jockeys in the UAE. The report also questioned the sincerity 
of U.S. diplomacy in pressuring the UAE, an ally to the United States, 
to comply with its own stated policy of banning the use of children under 
15 from camel racing. The documentary won a Sports Emmy Award in 2004 for 
"Outstanding Sports Journalism" and the 2006 Alfred I. duPont–Columbia 
University Award for "Outstanding Broadcast Journalism". It also brought 
worldwide attention to the plight of child camel jockeys in the Middle 
East and helped the Ansar Burney Trust to convince the governments of Qatar 
and the UAE to end the use of children in the sport. In 2006, film director 
Spike Lee made a two-part four-hour documentary on Hurricane Katrina called 
When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts. Also in 2006, documentary 
artist Lauren Greenfield directed a feature-length film about four young 
women struggling with eating disorders seeking treatment at the Renfrew 
Clinic in Florida, called Thin. 2008 saw the U.S. television premiere of 
Baghdad High, a documentary that depicted the lives of four boys attending 
a high school in Baghdad, Iraq, over the course of one year in the form 
of a video diary that was filmed by the boys themselves, who were given 
video cameras for the project.[105] In November 2008, HBO paid low seven 
figures for U.S. television rights to Amy Rice and Alicia Sams's documentary, 
By the People: The Election of Barack Obama. The film covers Obama's 2006 
trip to Africa, his presidential primary campaign, the 2008 general election 
and his inauguration. The documentary received theatrical release in New 
York City and Los Angeles, and aired on HBO in November 2009.[106] In November 
2012, HBO aired a four-part documentary titled Witness, each part of which 
is devoted to covering photojournalists in four conflict regions: Juarez, 
Libya, South Sudan and Rio de Janeiro.[107] On March 28, 2013, the channel 
premiered the Alexandra Pelosi-directed documentary Fall to Grace, about 
former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey, who resigned from the post in 
2011 following the revelation of an infidelity scandal that led McGreevey 
to come out as gay.[108][109] On April 10, 2013, HBO aired 50 Children: 
The Rescue Mission of Mr. and Mrs. Kraus, a documentary about the story 
of Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus, a Jewish couple from Philadelphia who traveled 
to Nazi Germany in 1939 and, with the help of the B'rith Sholom fraternal 
organization, saved Jewish children in Vienna from likely death in The 
Holocaust by finding them new homes in Philadelphia. In April 2013, the 
channel aired the documentary An Apology to Elephants, about the purported 
abuse and brutal treatment of elephants. In addition to its linear television 
channels, HBO has entered into other ventures: In April 1979, HBO launched 
its first attempt at a spin-off service, Take 2. Designed as a family-oriented 
mini-pay service, Take 2 was essentially formatted as an alternative to 
HBO, without any R-rated program content. The channel was ultimately deemed 
a major failure due to low subscribership and limited carriage by cable 
providers, and ceased operations late that summer.[92] HBO management analysized 
the mistakes that led to Take 2's downfall, which would result in the development 
of the network's second and more successful attempt at a secondary pay 
service, the movie-focused Cinemax, which launched on August 1, 1980. In 
1987,[specify] HBO launched the premium channel Festival,[110] a separate 
service that was distinctively programmed to provide family-friendly fare, 
which featured classic and recent hit movies, as well as HBO's original 
specials (which were branded when broadcast on the channel under the banner 
"Centerstage", which featured stand-up comedy, concert specials and ice 
skating shows) and documentaries. Festival, whose on-air slogan was Quality 
Entertainment You Welcome Home,[111] had also broadcast collections of 
feature films featuring a particular movie star (known as "Star Salutes"). 
What differed Festival from HBO was that the former channel was programmed 
as a family-oriented service. Atypical for a premium service, Festival 
featured edited versions of R-rated movies that were recut in order to 
fit a PG rating and allowed only high-quality series, specials and movies 
to be broadcast on the channel's schedule.[112] As Festival was designed 
as a mini-pay premium service (formatted similarly to Take 2 before it), 
the cost of a monthly subscription of the channel was also priced lower 
than that of HBO and Cinemax. Festival provided its subscribers with a 
color 20-page monthly program guide. Like HBO, Festival also ran occasional 
free preview periods, such as the October 30 to November 2, 1987 preview 
hosted by Tony Randall. However, the channel suffered from insufficient 
cable carriage as only a few providers carried Festival; as such, it could 
not compete with then-fellow premium service The Disney Channel, which 
also maintained a family-oriented programming format (that service would 
convert into a basic cable channel in April 1997). Festival would eventually 
shut down in late 1988[specify].[29][110] In 1989, HBO created The Comedy 
Channel, a basic cable channel that featured clips excerpted from stand-up 
comedy sets, comedic feature films and television series (using a programming 
model similar to the original format of MTV),[29] which launched on November 
15 of that year. The channel competed with another startup comedy-oriented 
cable channel that debuted the following year, Viacom-owned Ha!: The TV 
Comedy Network, which focused on reruns of older network sitcoms. Both 
channels suffered from insufficient cable carriage (both Ha! and The Comedy 
Channel each had fewer than 10 million subscribers). This resulted in Viacom 
and HBO reaching an agreement to merge Ha! and The Comedy Channel into 
a single channel called CTV: The Comedy Network, which debuted on April 
1, 1991;[113] the channel subsequently changed its name three months later 
to Comedy Central due to confusion and potential legal issues with Canadian 
broadcaster, the CTV Television Network. Time Warner/HBO exited the venture 
when Viacom bought out its 50% stake in Comedy Central for $1.23 billion 
in April 2003.[114] HBO formed the production company HBO Independent Productions 
in 1990, which mainly served to produce sitcoms for broadcast television 
and basic cable (which included series such as Martin, Roc, The Ben Stiller 
Show and Everybody Loves Raymond). HBO Downtown Productions was formed 
one year later, producing comedy specials for HBO, as well as program content 
for Comedy Central (such as Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher and Dr. 
Katz, Professional Therapist). HBO also operates HBO Films, which was established 
in 1999 as a reconfiguration and consolidation of two separate movie divisions 
operated by Home Box Office Inc., HBO NYC Productions and HBO Pictures. 
HBO also operated another film division called HBO Showcase, which began 
operations in 1986; it was shut down in 1996 and was relaunched as HBO 
NYC Productions. HBO also participated in a number of joint ventures in 
film production: As objections to the advent of home video from factions 
of the entertainment industry began to die down, in November 1984, HBO 
partnered with independent film distributor Thorn EMI to form Thorn EMI/HBO 
Video.[116] Thorn EMI cut various distribution agreements with smaller 
film production companies that did not have their own home video units, 
such as Orion Pictures and New Line Cinema.[29] In 1986, Cannon Films bought 
out Thorn EMI's interest in the unit, which was accordingly renamed HBO/Cannon 
Video. Cannon dropped out of the venture by 1987 after the studio took 
a financial hit following its attempt at a series of larger budget films 
that did not experience box office success; the unit was then renamed HBO 
Video.[29] Over time, HBO Video (which eventually became HBO Home Entertainment 
by the early 2010s) shifted away from releasing films from independent 
studios to releasing HBO's catalog of original programs and films on DVD 
and Blu-ray Disc.[29] Various products have been marketed that have used 
the HBO trademark and/or are based around the channel's programming. In 
2005, HBO entered into an agreement with Cingular Wireless to establish 
HBO Mobile, a pre-smartphone era mobile web service.[117] Operating as 
a pay service (a model similar to that used by the channel itself), HBO 
Mobile featured information on HBO's original programming (including episode 
guides), mobile wallpapers and ringtones voiced by cast members of the 
channel's series (HBO Mobile also operated a similar service, HBO Family 
Mobile, which offered full-length episodes of the channel's children's 
programming). That same year, Mattel and Screenlife released a version 
of the DVD interactive game Scene It?, featuring trivia relating to HBO's 
original series. When HBO launched in 1972, its original logo was merely 
consisted of the "Home Box Office" name and a ticket stub surrounded by 
a lighted marquee. The original version of its current logo (designed by 
Bemis Balkind) was introduced in 1975, using an uppercase bold "HBO" text 
with a circle inside the 'O', which in turn cuts into the 'B'. The logo 
was modified in 1980 (although it did not completely replace the original 
version until 1981), with the 'B' and the 'O' becoming full letterforms, 
albeit continuing to be attached to each other. The simplicity of the logo 
makes it fairly easy to duplicate, something HBO has taken advantage of 
many times over the years. The logo became iconic due to a program opening 
sequence produced in 1981 by New York City production firm Liberty Studios, 
nicknamed "HBO in Space", which was used from September 20, 1982 to September 
30, 1997.[118] The original full version begins with a window shot of a 
family (or alternately, a married couple) in an apartment sitting down 
to watch HBO on their television set (which was replaced by a cloudscape 
that faded into the city sequence in December 1983), which transitions 
to a fly-through over a constructed model cityscape and countryside. A 
starburst – or "stargate effect" – then occurs following a pan towards 
a star-filled sky (which begins a shorter version of the sequence), unveiling 
a chrome-plated HBO logo that flies and rotates into view; colored light 
beams encircle the side of the "O", then flash to a partially animated 
sequence featuring more lights racing counter-clockwise in its interior 
on a silver axis, revealing "HBO Feature Presentation" or another program 
type (such as "Standing Room Only", "HBO Special" or "On Location") in 
block text, before additional beams sweep across the text and shine, with 
more flashing into a fade to black. Most variants of this sequence were 
discontinued in 1986, except for the feature presentation (which was relegated 
to use only for the main prime time film), "Saturday Night Movie" and "Sunday 
Night Movie" variants (the latter two of which were discontinued in 1993). 
Many versions of the intro are available on YouTube, including one uploaded 
to HBO's official YouTube channel.[119] The accompanying fanfare – originally 
composed for Score Productions by Ferdinand Jay Smith III of Jay Advertising, 
who adapted the theme from the Scherzo movement of Antonín Dvořák's Ninth 
Symphony – has become a musical signature for HBO, and has been used in 
feature presentation, upcoming program and evening schedule bumpers, and 
network IDs since 1998 with various arrangements from horns to piano being 
used over the years. Another well-known HBO program opener, "Neon Lights", 
began movies airing outside of primetime from November 1, 1986, to September 
30, 1997. The sequence, set to a synth and electric guitar theme, begins 
with a purple HBO logo on a film strip with blue, green and pink light 
rays shooting through it as the strip rotates out of view; the lights shoot 
through several glowing CG slots until a flash of light hits a field of 
spheres in varying colors, which zoom out to form a light purple HBO logo 
overlaid by a cursive magenta "Movie" script against a black background 
with rows of light purple spheres.[120] From 1997 to 1999, HBO used several 
feature presentation bumpers designed by Pittard Sullivan featuring the 
network logo in different situations (such as a fish in water, a celebrity 
in a limousine, a large HBO logo chasing a man and a neon HBO logo on the 
rooftop of a building); these sequences were also used by the network as 
IDs from 1997 to 2002, and in upcoming program and evening schedule bumpers 
until 2000. From September 1999 to April 1, 2011, HBO used a Pittard Sullivan-designed 
CGI feature presentation bumper sequence that features a flyover similar 
to the 1982 sequence, starting with the front of a movie theater featuring 
a marquee that reads "HBO Feature Presentation", and trekking through a 
country road, a snowy mountain road near a cliff and a desert road (respectively 
passing under a tower, tunnel and tanker truck shaped in the individual 
letters of the HBO logotype); this leads into a road in an urban neighborhood 
(with skyscrapers visible in the background) that becomes a bridge upon 
the city's downtown area, and lead to a slowing flyover toward and pan 
over an HBO logo-shaped lake that starts with several spotlights rapidly 
turning on and ends with a 3D animation of the "Feature Presentation" text. 
The closing animation that is seen both in the full version as well as 
a shorter version of the sequence (seen outside of weekend prime time films 
and Saturday film premieres, when the longer sequence was used).[121] The 
sequence was replaced on April 2, 2011 – as part of a new graphics package 
implemented on that date across the HBO multiplex channels – by a much 
shorter opening sequence designed by Jesse Vartanian (who also designed 
CGI teaser commercials for HBO's premiere telecast of the 2010 film Avatar), 
consisting only of a dark background with faint light auroras around the 
HBO logo and a simple "Feature Presentation" text animation, accompanied 
by soft orchestral music.[122] Unlike other pay television networks (including 
the multiplex channels of sister channel Cinemax), HBO does not brand its 
programming with on-screen logo bugs of the main network and each respective 
multiplex channel – although its multiplex channels do display logo bugs 
during promotional breaks between programs.[123] Source:[124] Some conservatives 
have expressed criticism of HBO's original programming in recent years, 
contending that there is a strong liberal bias at Home Box Office, Inc.'s 
corporate level. These critics also claim that producers of HBO's programs 
tend to interject a liberal bias into storylines or favor progressive themes.[131][132][133][134] 
A 2012 study conducted by Buyology – to which a representative stated had 
used a "timed response" methodology to "gauge gut, emotional responses" 
– suggested that certain programs on HBO and rival premium service Showtime 
were more well-liked by Democratic voters compared to Republicans.[135] 
HBO management has denied allegations that it exhibits a political agenda 
in its programming. Since 1991, HBO has overseen a number of partnerships 
that operate HBO-branded television networks around the world. As the network 
was launched in new markets, the HBO brand has been used in several countries. 
HBO has established channels in various countries worldwide including Brazil, 
Canada, Eastern Europe, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, Pakistan, the Caribbean, 
Scandinavia and Southeast Asia. HBO also licenses its programming to air 
on certain other broadcast and cable channels outside the United States 
(such as Sky Atlantic, which is available within the Republic of Ireland, 
Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany and M-net EDGE which is 
available in Sub-Sahara Africa ). ^Note 1 Owned by the NBA, operated by
