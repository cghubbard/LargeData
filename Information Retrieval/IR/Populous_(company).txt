Populous (formerly HOK Sport Venue Event) is a global architectural firm 
specializing in the design of sports facilities, arenas and convention 
centers, as well as the planning of major special events. Populous formerly 
operated as HOK Sport Venue Event, which was part of the HOK Group. In 
January 2009, Populous was created through a management buyout, becoming 
independently owned and operated. It is reported to be one of the largest 
architecture firms in the world.[1][2][3] In 1983, HOK under Jerry Sincoff 
created a sports group (initially called the Sports Facilities Group and 
later changed to HOK Sport Venue Event). The firm initially consisted of 
eight architects in Kansas City, and grew to employ 185 people by 1996.[4] 
On several projects, HOK Sport had teamed with international design practice 
LOBB Partnership, which maintained offices in London, England, and Brisbane, 
Australia. On HOK Sport's 15th anniversary in November 1998, the firm merged 
with LOBB. The new practice retained headquarters in all three cities. 
The Kansas City, Missouri, office was first based in the city's Garment 
District in the Lucas Place office building.[5] In 2005, it moved into 
its headquarters at 300 Wyandotte in the River Market neighborhood in a 
new building it designed, on land developed as an urban renewal project 
through tax incentives from the city's Planned Industrial Expansion Authority. 
It was the first major company to relocate to the neighborhood in several 
decades.[6] In March 2009, HOK Sport Venue Event changed its name to Populous 
after a managers’ buyout by HOK Group.[5] In October 2015, Populous relocated 
to its new headquarters at the newly renovated Board of Trade building 
at 4800 Main street near the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City.[7] The 
company is one of several Kansas City-based sports design firms that trace 
their roots to Kivett and Myers which designed the Truman Sports Complex 
which was one of the first modern large single purpose sports stadiums 
(previously, stadiums were designed for multipurpose use). Other firms 
with sports design presence in Kansas City that trace their roots to Kivett 
include Ellerbe Becket Inc. and HNTB Corp.. 360 Architecture is also based 
in Kansas City.[8] Populous is credited for spearheading a new era of baseball 
park design in the 1990s, beginning with Oriole Park at Camden Yards.[9] 
At Camden Yards, and in other stadiums built by Populous soon thereafter 
like Coors Field and Progressive Field, the ballpark was designed to incorporate 
aesthetic elements of the city's history and older "classic ballparks." 
Camden Yards's red brick facade emulates the massive B&O Warehouse that 
dominates the right field view behind Eutaw Street,[10] whereas Progressive 
Field's glass and steel exterior "call to mind the drawbridges and train 
trestles that crisscross the nearby Cuyahoga River."[11] Starting with 
the Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati in 2003, a number of Populous 
Sport's stadiums featured more contemporary and even futuristic designs. 
Subsequent stadium exteriors featuring this motif opened in Washington 
and Minnesota.[9] In addition to moving away from the concrete exteriors 
of the "cookie-cutter" multi-purpose stadiums that preceded the new parks, 
Populous incorporated other innovative touches: natural grass playing surfaces 
(instead of artificial turf), asymmetrical field dimensions, various park-specific 
idiosyncrasies (like Tal's Hill), and less foul territory that would keep 
fans farther from the diamond.[12][13][14] And because the stadiums were 
designed for baseball instead of several sports, the sightlines were "uniformly 
excellent."[15] Camden Yards was not only hugely popular with baseball 
fans. The success of a new ballpark in downtown Baltimore convinced many 
cities to invest public funds in their own new ballparks to help revitalize 
struggling urban neighborhoods.[14] From 1992 to 2012, HOK Sport/Populous 
were the lead architects on 14 Major League Baseball stadiums and helped 
renovate four existing stadiums.[16] Populous's designs across Major League 
Baseball have become so prevalent that some critics have asserted that 
the distinctiveness that was originally found in early "retro" ballparks 
is impossible to maintain: "There are nearly 20 [new ballparks] around 
the league, [so] their heterogeneity has come to seem altogether homogenous." 
Whereas "classic" ballparks like Fenway Park were given strange dimensions 
simply because of the limitations provided by the plots of land on which 
the parks were built, new stadiums do not feature such restrictions. One 
sportswriter said the attempt to emulate the old parks in this way is "contrived."[15] 
In addition, a number of commentators have criticized what they see as 
a tendency to cater new ballparks toward wealthier ticket buyers, such 
as with expanded use of luxury suites instead of cheaper, conventional 
seating.[15][17][18][19] Several writers have noted that upper deck seating 
at new ballparks may actually be farther away from the field than in the 
older parks, partly as a result of these new upper decks being pushed higher 
by rows of luxury suites.[20] One writer in The New Yorker said it is "not 
quite right to credit or blame Populous" for trends in their new stadiums—as 
it is ultimately team owners that plan what they want in future stadiums—but 
they "certainly enabled" such changes.[21] (selected events) Major League
