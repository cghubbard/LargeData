The Empire Professional Baseball League is an independent baseball league 
scheduled to start in 2016.[1] The Empire League plays a 60-game regular 
season followed by a five-game post season. The Empire League is a replacement 
of the North Country Baseball League, which folded after one season (and 
was itself a last-minute replacement for the East Coast Baseball League, 
which disbanded before the start of the 2015 season).[2] The league would 
four teams based in the states of New York, New Hampshire and Maine for 
its inaugural season. It is a low-budget league meant to give players recently 
graduated from college or with little professional experience an opportunity 
at staying in shape and providing them the chance at being signed to higher 
level league contracts with affiliated or independent teams. All league 
funding comes from advertisement sales, ticket sales and tryout revenue. 
The league is operated by Eddie Gonzalez, former professional baseball 
player and NAIA All-American at Webber International University. Gonzalez 
is also a former NCBL executive.[3] The Sullivan Explorers, despite finishing 
the regular season with a losing record, won the 2016 league championship 
over the regular season leading Watertown Bucks.[4] Prior to the league's 
second season, the Watertown Bucks lost the lease to their stadium and 
was replaced by a team from Puerto Rico. However, since a stadium deal 
in Puerto Rico had not yet been finalized, the team will play the 2017
