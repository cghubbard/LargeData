Little Rock is the capital and the most populous city of the U.S. state 
of Arkansas. It is also the county seat of Pulaski County. It was incorporated 
on November 7, 1831, on the south bank of the Arkansas River very near 
the geographic center of the state. The city derives its name from a rock 
formation along the river, named "La Petite Roche" by the French in 1799. 
The capital of the Arkansas Territory was moved to Little Rock from Arkansas 
Post in 1821. The city's population was 193,524 at the 2010 census. The 
six county Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, AR Metropolitan Statistical 
Area (MSA) is ranked 75th in terms of population in the United States with 
724,385 residents according to the 2013 estimate by the United States Census 
Bureau.[1][3] Little Rock is a cultural, economic, government and transportation 
center within Arkansas and the South. Several cultural institutions are 
located in Little Rock, such as the Arkansas Arts Center, the Arkansas 
Repertory Theatre, and the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra, in addition to 
the hiking, boating, and other outdoor recreational opportunities. Little 
Rock's history is available through history museums, historic districts 
or neighborhoods like the Quapaw Quarter, and historic sites such as Little 
Rock Central High School. The city is the headquarters of Dillard's, Windstream 
Communications, Acxiom, Stephens Inc., University of Arkansas for Medical 
Sciences, Heifer International, the Clinton Foundation, and the Rose Law 
Firm. Other large corporations, such as Dassault Falcon Jet and LM Wind 
Power have large operations in the city. State government is a large employer, 
with many offices being located in downtown Little Rock. Two Interstate 
highways, Interstate 30 and Interstate 40 meet in Little Rock, with the 
Port of Little Rock serving as a shipping hub. Little Rock derives its 
name from a small rock formation on the south bank of the Arkansas River 
called la Petite Roche (French: "the little rock"). The "little rock" was 
used by early river traffic as a landmark and became a well-known river 
crossing. The "little rock" is across the river from "big rock," a large 
bluff at the edge of the river, which was once used as a rock quarry.[4] 
Archeological artifacts provide evidence of Native Americans inhabiting 
Central Arkansas for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. The early 
inhabitants may have been the Folsom people, Bluff Dwellers, and Mississippian 
culture peoples who built earthwork mounds recorded in 1541 by Spanish 
explorer Hernando de Soto. Historical tribes of the area were the Caddo, 
Quapaw, Osage, Choctaw, and Cherokee. Little Rock was named for a stone 
outcropping on the bank of the Arkansas River used by early travelers as 
a landmark.[5] La Petite Roche (French for "the Little Rock"), named in 
1722 by French explorer and trader Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe, marked 
the transition from the flat Mississippi Delta region to the Ouachita Mountain 
foothills. Travelers referred to the area as "the Little Rock," and the 
landmark name stuck. Little Rock is located at 34°44′10″N 92°19′52″W﻿ /

Rock is located on the south bank of the Arkansas River in Central Arkansas.

The western part of the city is located in the foothills of the Ouachita 
Mountains. Northwest of the city limits are Pinnacle Mountain and Lake 
Maumelle, which provides Little Rock's drinking water. The city of North 
Little Rock is located just across the river from Little Rock, but it is 
a separate city. North Little Rock was once the 8th ward of Little Rock. 
An Arkansas Supreme Court decision on February 6, 1904, allowed the ward 
to merge with the neighboring town of North Little Rock. The merged town 
quickly renamed itself Argenta (the local name for the former 8th Ward), 
but returned to its original name in October 1917.[7] Inside Little Rock's
