Avisail Antonio García Yaguarin (born June 12, 1991) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball right fielder for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball. 
He previously played for the Detroit Tigers. García was invited to spring 
training with the Detroit Tigers in 2011 and 2012.[1] After the 2011 season, 
he was added to the Tigers 40-man roster.[2] He was named 2012 Minor League 
Player of the Year for the Tigers farm system, and first appeared on the 
major-league team on August 31, 2012. He hit .319 in 23 games, and made 
the playoff roster, appearing in the League Division Series, League Championship 
Series and 2012 World Series. In 23 postseason at-bats, García hit .261 
with a double and four RBIs. He is noted for his resemblance to former 
teammate Miguel Cabrera, earning him the nickname "Mini Miggy". Both stand 
6 feet 4 inches (1.9 m) tall, weigh 240 pounds (110 kg), bat right-handed, 
and hail from Venezuela,[3] although Cabrera has an advantage in batting. 
García entered the 2013 season with an outside shot to make the Tigers' 
opening day roster, but that possibility ended when he was placed on the 
15-day disabled list (DL) March 26 (retroactive to March 22) with a heel 
contusion.[4] He was brought up to the Tigers in May 2013 when Austin Jackson 
was placed on the DL. On May 15, Garcia hit his first major league home 
run. In June 2013, García was optioned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens 
when Jackson came off the DL,[5] but was recalled four days later when 
Aníbal Sánchez was placed on the DL.[6] On July 7, 2013, during a game 
for the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, García hit for the cycle in a 9–7 victory 
over the Indianapolis Indians. This marked the first cycle for a Mud Hen 
since Ryan Raburn on May 27, 2007.[7] On July 30, 2013, García was traded 
to the Chicago White Sox in a three-team trade that sent Jake Peavy and 
Brayan Villarreal to the Boston Red Sox, José Iglesias to the Detroit Tigers, 
and Francellis Montas to the White Sox.[8] Garcia initially reported to 
the White Sox Triple-A affiliate, the Charlotte Knights. Between Charlotte 
and Toledo, he led the International League in batting average with a .374 
mark.[9] When the White Sox traded Alex Ríos on August 9, they promoted 
García to the major leagues.[10] He started his first game with the White 
Sox on August 10, and collected his first hit with the team in the sixth 
inning.[11] García came out of a game against the Colorado Rockies on April 
9, 2014 after he jammed his left shoulder after attempting a diving catch 
in right field.[12] The next day, an MRI revealed that his left shoulder 
had a torn labrum. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list and was presumably 
ruled out for the 2014 season.[13] However, García successfully recovered 
and was activated from the DL on August 16, 2014.[14] Limited to only 46
