The 2008 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 126th year in Major 
League Baseball, and their ninth at AT&T Park. The team finished in fourth 
place in the National League West with a 72-90 record, 12 games behind 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. 2008 marks their 50th Anniversary in the Bay Area 
since moving from New York in 1958. It is also their first since 1992 without 
all-time home run champion Barry Bonds, who was not re-signed following 
the 2007 season. At the end of the season, Tim Lincecum was voted the 2008 
National League Cy Young Award winner. On September 21, 2007, Giants' ownership 
announced that Bonds would not return after the 2007 season.[1] The Giants 
did not resign Ryan Klesko and Pedro Feliz. On December 12, 2007 the Giants 
signed Aaron Rowand to a five-year and $60 million contract.[2] The Giants 
finished spring training with a record of 9–23–2, the worst spring training 
in their recorded history. The Giants had the highest ERA and the lowest 
batting average among teams whose spring training was in Arizona. The team 
lead the majors with 40 errors.[3] The Giants lost a spring training game 
4–3 to their Triple-A affiliate Fresno Grizzlies. Giants opening day starter 
Barry Zito allowed 24 earned runs in 25 innings in Spring training.[4] 
Giants spring training included injuries and competitions for several roster 
positions. Steve Holm won the back up catcher spot against Eliezer Alfonzo 
and Guillermo Rodríguez. Relievers Merkin Valdez, Erick Threets, and Keiichi 
Yabu earned spots on the opening day roster. Noah Lowry, Vinnie Chulk, 
Kevin Frandsen and Omar Vizquel started the season the on disabled list. 
Brian Bocock was the opening day shortstop in place of Vizquel. Steve Kline 
was designated for assignment.[5] The Giants claimed Jose Castillo off 
waivers from the Florida Marlins late March 2008.[6] He was the opening 
day third baseman. Kevin Correia won the competition to be the team's 5th 
starter. The Giants were widely expected to miss the playoffs in 2008, 
according to numerous sports writers.[7][8] On May 16, 2008, Peter Magowan, 
the owner who brought Barry Bonds to San Francisco, built a new ballpark 
and kept major league baseball in the city, announced he would be stepping 
down as the managing partner of the Giants. Effective October 1, 2008 Bill 
Neukom would be the new managing partner of the Giants.[9] Infielders Other
