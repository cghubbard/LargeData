The Adriatic club was a member of the National Association of Base Ball 
Players before the American Civil War. The Adriatics first played another 
member in September 1857 and joined the NABBP for the 1858 to 1861 seasons. 
These are all the Newark Adriatics games listed somewhere by Marshall Wright 
(2000). For 1857, the game with the Union club of Morrisania, now in the 
Bronx, is the only listed match versus a non-member club (Adriatic), and 
the only listed match versus a club outside modern New York City. Only 
that spring, sixteen clubs within modern New York had convened for the 
first time, which was later recognized as initiating the Association. Wright,
