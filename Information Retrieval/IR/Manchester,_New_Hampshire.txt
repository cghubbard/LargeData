Manchester is the largest city in the U.S. state of New Hampshire, the 
tenth largest city in New England, and the largest city in northern New 
England, an area comprising the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. 
It was first named by the merchant and inventor Samuel Blodget (after whom 
the Samuel Blodget Park in Manchester North is named). Blodget's vision 
was to create a great industrial center similar to that of the original 
Manchester in England, which was the world's first industrialized city.[3] 
It is located in Hillsborough County along the banks of the Merrimack River, 
which divides the city into eastern and western sections. Manchester is 
near the northern end of the Northeast megalopolis. As of the 2010 census, 
the city had a population of 109,565,[4] and its 2015 population estimate 
was 110,229.[2] As of the 2015 population estimate, Manchester is the largest 
New England city north of Boston, including other Massachusetts cities. 
The Manchester-Nashua metropolitan area, with an estimated population in 
2015 of 406,678, is home to nearly one-third of the population of New Hampshire.[5] 
Manchester often appears favorably in lists ranking the affordability and 
livability of American cities. In 2009, CNNMoney.com rated Manchester 13th 
in a list of the 100 best cities to live and launch a business in the United 
States.[6] In addition, Kiplinger voted Manchester the second most tax-friendly 
city in the United States, second only to Anchorage, Alaska.[7] Also in 
2009, Forbes magazine ranked the Manchester region first on its list of 
"America's 100 Cheapest Places to Live."[8] According to the Equality of 
Opportunity Project, released in 2013, Manchester ranked as the seventh 
best metropolitan area in terms of upward income mobility in the United 
States.[9] Pennacook Indians called it Namoskeag, meaning "good fishing 
place"—a reference to the Amoskeag Falls in the Merrimack River.[10] In 
1722, John Goffe III settled beside Cohas Brook, later building a dam and 
sawmill at what was dubbed Old Harry's Town. It was granted by Massachusetts 
in 1727 as Tyngstown to veterans of Queen Anne's War who served in 1703 
under Captain William Tyng.[11] But at New Hampshire's 1741 separation 
from Massachusetts, the grant was ruled invalid and substituted with Wilton, 
Maine, so Governor Benning Wentworth rechartered the town in 1751 as Derryfield. 
Derryfield remains a neighborhood in contemporary Manchester, along its 
easternmost area adjacent to Massabesic Lake.[11] In 1807, Samuel Blodget 
opened a canal and lock system to allow vessels passage around the falls. 
He envisioned here a great industrial center, "the Manchester of America", 
like the Industrial Revolution's Manchester in England, the first industrialized 
city in the world.[11][12] In 1809, Benjamin Prichard and others built 
a cotton spinning mill operated by water power on the western bank of the 
Merrimack. Following Blodgett's suggestion, Derryfield was renamed Manchester 
in 1810, the year the mill was incorporated as the Amoskeag Cotton & Woolen 
Manufacturing Company.[13] It would be purchased in 1825 by entrepreneurs 
from Massachusetts, expanded to 3 mills in 1826, and then incorporated 
in 1831 as the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company.[11][12] On the eastern bank, 
Amoskeag engineers and architects planned a model company town, founded 
in 1838 with Elm Street as its main thoroughfare. Incorporated as a city 
in 1846, Manchester would become home to the largest cotton mill in the 
world—Mill No. 11, stretching 900 feet (270 m) long by 103 feet (31 m) 
wide, and containing 4,000 looms. Other products made in the community 
included shoes, cigars, and paper. The Amoskeag foundry made rifles, sewing 
machines, textile machinery, fire engines, and locomotives in a division 
called the Amoskeag Locomotive Works (later, the Manchester Locomotive 
Works). The rapid growth of the mills demanded a large influx of workers, 
resulting in a flood of immigrants, particularly French Canadians. Many 
current residents descend from these workers. The Amoskeag Manufacturing 
Company went out of business in 1935, although its red brick mills have 
been renovated for other uses. Indeed, the mill town's 19th-century affluence 
left behind some of the finest Victorian commercial, municipal, and residential 
architecture in the state.[14] Manchester is nicknamed the Queen City, 
as well as the more recently coined "Manch Vegas".[15] In 1998, Manchester 
was named the "Number One Small City in the East" by Money magazine. The 
Mall of New Hampshire, on Manchester's southern fringe near the intersection 
of Interstates 93 and 293, is the city's main retail center. In 2001, the 
Verizon Wireless Arena, a venue seating more than 10,000, opened for major 
concerts and sporting events, enhancing the city's downtown revitalization 
efforts with a major hotel and convention center already in place directly 
across the street from the arena. According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the city has a total area of 35.0 square miles (90.6 km2), of which 
33.1 square miles (85.7 km2) is land and 1.9 square miles (4.8 km2) is 
water, comprising 5.33% of the city.[4] Manchester is drained by the Merrimack 
River, the Piscataquog River and Cohas Brook. Massabesic Lake is on the 
eastern border. The highest point in Manchester is atop Wellington Hill, 
where the elevation reaches 570 feet (170 m) above sea level. The Manchester 
Planning Board, in its 2010 Master Plan, defines 25 neighborhoods within 
the city. LivableMHT has drawn maps of the neighborhoods and neighborhood 
village centers as defined by the city.[16] Recognition of particular neighborhoods 
varies, with some having neighborhood associations, but none have any legal 
or political authority. The major neighborhoods, historically, include 
Amoskeag, Rimmon Heights, Notre Dame/McGregorville and Piscataquog/Granite 
Square also known as "Piscat" on the West Side; and the North End, Janeville/Corey 
Square, Hallsville and Bakersville on the East Side; along with Youngsville 
and Goffes Falls on the periphery of the city.[17] In 2007, the city began 
a Neighborhood Initiatives program to "insure that our neighborhoods are 
vibrant, livable areas since these are the portions of the city where most 
of the residents spend their time living, playing, shopping and going to 
school."[18] The purpose of this initiative is to foster vibrancy and redevelopment 
in the neighborhoods, and to restore the sense of neighborhood communities 
that had been overlooked in the city for some time. The city began the 
program with street-scape and infrastructure improvements in the Rimmon 
Heights neighborhood of the West Side, which has spurred growth and investment 
in and by the community.[19] Despite the success of the program in Rimmon 
Heights, it was unclear in recent years how the city planned to implement 
similar programs throughout the city. The city announced plans for extending 
the Neighborhood Initiatives program to the Hollow neighborhood in February 
2012.[20] The urban core of Manchester extends beyond its city limits in 
several directions, particularly west and south of downtown, including: 
Manchester has a four-season humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), with 
long, cold, snowy winters, and very warm and somewhat humid summers; spring 
and fall in between are crisp and relatively brief transitions. The monthly 
daily average temperature ranges from 24.4 °F (−4.2 °C) in January to 72.5 °F 
(22.5 °C) in July. On average, there are 11 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs 
and 2.9 days of sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows. Precipitation is well-spread throughout 
the year, though winter is the driest while March tends to be the wettest. 
Snowfall, the heaviest of which is typically delivered through nor'easters, 
averages around 47 inches (119 cm) per season, but varies widely from year 
to year. Manchester's population at the 2010 census was 109,565.[4] The 
city is the center of the Manchester, New Hampshire, New England City and 
Town Metropolitan Area (NECTA MA), which had a population of 187,596 as 
of the 2010 census.[24] As of the census of 2010,[25] there were 109,565 
people, 45,766 households, and 26,066 families residing in the city. The 
population density was 3,320.2 people per square mile (1,281.5/km²). There 
were 49,288 housing units at an average density of 1,493.6 per square mile 
(576.5/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 86.1% White, 4.1% Black 
or African American, 0.30% Native American, 3.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 
3.1% from some other race, and 2.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or 
Latino of any race were 8.1% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 
82.0% of the population,[26] down from 98.0% in 1980.[27] In 2011 the largest 
ancestry groups within the city's population were: French and French-Canadian 
(23.9%), Irish (19.5%), English (9.9%), German (8.6%), and Italian (8.1%).[28] 
At the 2010 census, there were 45,766 households, out of which 26.4% had 
children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.4% were married couples 
living together, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 43.0% were non-families. 32.4% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 9.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.34 persons and the average family size was 
2.99.[25] In the city the population was spread out with 21.6% under the 
age of 18, 10.2% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 26.0% from 45 to 64, 
and 11.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36.0 years. 
For every 100 females there were 98.5 males. For every 100 females age 
18 and over, there were 96.6 males.[25] In 2011 the estimated median income 
for a household in the city was $51,082, and the median income for a family 
was $63,045. Male full-time workers had a median income of $43,583 versus 
$37,155 for females. The per capita income for the city was $26,131. 14.1% 
of the population and 9.6% of families were below the poverty line. Out 
of the total people living in poverty, 21.8% were under the age of 18 and 
9.9% were 65 or older.[30] Manchester is northern New England's largest 
city, and as of the 2014 U.S. Census population estimate was the most populous 
New England city north of Boston, including other Massachusetts cities. 
Its metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing in New England. Its 
economy has changed greatly, as Manchester was a textile mill town about 
40 years ago. In March 2009 Kiplinger voted Manchester the second most 
tax friendly city in America, after Anchorage, Alaska.[7] Earlier in the 
year, CNN rated Manchester 13th in its 100 best places to live and launch 
a business in America.[6] Manchester is the home of Segway, Inc., manufacturers 
of a two-wheeled, self-balancing electric vehicle invented by Dean Kamen. 
Downtown Manchester's One City Hall Plaza stands 22 stories high, quickly 
followed by the all-black, 20-story Brady Sullivan Plaza, formerly known 
as the Hampshire Plaza. They are the tallest New England buildings north 
of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Sullivan Plaza is shorter than City Hall 
Plaza by a mere 16 feet (4.9 m). Other major buildings include the 18-story 
Wall Street Apartments tower; the 14-story, recently renamed Brady Sullivan 
Tower, which was the former New Hampshire Insurance building; at 12 stories, 
the Radisson Hotel and Convention Center Manchester (which serves the SNHU 
Arena across the street), the Carpenter Center (a former hotel), and the 
Hampshire Towers condominium building; the 10-story Citizens Bank Building, 
which was, for much of the early- and mid-20th century, Manchester's iconic 
Amoskeag Bank "skyscraper"; and several high-rises of or exceeding 10 stories 
on the city's West Side. This partial list only includes residential and 
commercial buildings and does not include hospitals, spires and domes, 
etc. The SNHU Arena, formerly the Verizon Wireless Arena, has become the 
centerpiece of downtown Manchester. The venue can seat slightly less than 
12,000 patrons for concerts, and at least 10,000-seat configurations for 
sporting and other forms of entertainment. The SNHU Arena is home to the 
Manchester Monarchs, the local ECHL affiliate of the Los Angeles Kings. 
It has also hosted major recording artists and comedians, national touring 
theatrical productions, family-oriented shows, and fairs since it opened 
in 2001.[31] The Northeast Delta Dental Stadium (formerly MerchantsAuto.com 
Stadium) is a baseball park located on the Merrimack River in downtown 
Manchester and is home to the local AA baseball affiliate of the Toronto 
Blue Jays, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. Historic Gill Stadium supported 
professional minor-league baseball into the early 21st century and continues 
to be a viable and popular downtown venue for many sporting and entertainment 
events, seating nearly 4,000 patrons, depending on the event format. In 
recent years there has been continual redevelopment of the Amoskeag Millyard 
and its residential Historic District. The increasing popularity of downtown 
living has caused many properties originally built as tenement housing 
for mill workers in the 19th century to be converted to stylish, eclectic 
residential condominiums. Many new retail stores and higher education institutions, 
including the University of New Hampshire at Manchester, have been uniquely 
retro-fitted into properties along Commercial and Canal Street. Manchester 
has three main retail areas: downtown Manchester, South Willow Street (NH 
Route 28), and Second Street (NH Route 3A) on the West Side. The Mall of 
New Hampshire is located on South Willow Street, and, with more than 125 
stores, is one of the largest shopping centers in southern New Hampshire 
and central New England. Cultural landmarks include the historic Palace 
Theatre, the Currier Museum of Art, the New Hampshire Institute of Art, 
the Franco-American Center, the Manchester Historic Association Millyard 
Museum, the Massabesic Audubon Center, the Amoskeag Fishways Learning and 
Visitors Center, the Lawrence L. Lee Scouting Museum and Max I. Silber 
Library, and the SEE Science Center. Valley Cemetery, the resting place 
of numerous prominent citizens since 1841, is an early example of a garden-style 
burial ground. The John F. Kennedy Memorial Coliseum is another, smaller 
venue located in downtown Manchester with a capacity of approximately 3,000 
seats. It was completed in 1963, serves as home ice for the Manchester 
Central and Memorial High School hockey teams, and is home to the Southern 
New Hampshire Skating Club.[32] The nickname "ManchVegas" was derived from 
illegal gambling in local businesses during the late 1980s or early 1990s. 
Many pizza shops and local bars had video poker machines that would pay 
out real money. The nickname was coined following a city-wide bust of these 
machines. It was then adopted as a lampoon of the city's limited entertainment 
opportunities. The term has since become a source of pride as the city's 
entertainment scene has grown. By 2003 it was well enough known that a 
note on Virtualtourist.com said, "Residents reflect the regional dry humor 
by referring to sedate Manchester as 'ManchVegas'."[33] By 2005, an article 
in Manchester's Hippo (a local alternative weekly) said that then-Mayor 
Robert A. Baines "is pushing to replace the nickname ManchVegas with Manchhattan" 
(meaning Manchester+Manhattan).[34] In 2009 the film Monsters, Marriage 
and Murder in ManchVegas was released referencing Manchester's popular 
nickname and using much of the city as its backdrop.[35] Manchester has 
a growing collective of artists, due in large part to the influx of young 
students at the New Hampshire Institute of Art, Southern New Hampshire 
University, and the University of New Hampshire at Manchester. Slam Free 
or Die, New Hampshire's only weekly slam poetry venue, is located in Manchester 
and was voted "Best Poetry Venue in the World" [36] by readers of Write 
Bloody Publishing. The city is home to McIntyre Ski Area, which opened 
in the 1970s. There are also college sports teams that play in and out 
of the city.[37] Manchester is the only city in New Hampshire with professional 
sports teams. The SNHU Arena is home to the ECHL's Manchester Monarchs. 
From 2001 to 2015, Manchester had a team, also called the Manchester Monarchs, 
that played in the American Hockey League. In their final season in Manchester, 
the Monarchs won the league championship. Northeast Delta Dental Stadium 
is home to the two-time Eastern League champions, the New Hampshire Fisher 
Cats. The following is a list of Manchester's professional and minor-league 
sports teams. Manchester has several sports leagues. For baseball, until 
2007, there were six Little Leagues: In 2007, due to declining numbers, 
West and Southwest consolidated into one league to form Manchester West 
Side Little League. In the summer of 2015, Manchester East, long regarded 
and respected by many in the New Hampshire youth baseball community as 
a standard-type league, switched affiliation to the Cal Ripken Baseball 
League, a division of Babe Ruth Baseball. The league is now known as Manchester 
Cal Ripken. Starting in 2016, the options for youth baseball include Manchester 
Cal Ripken for all youths 12 and under in Manchester, and: Youths wishing 
to play in these leagues must reside within the respective leagues' approved 
boundaries. There are four fall-season soccer leagues: Manchester Angels 
Youth Soccer League is a spring-only league. All five of these leagues 
are members of the New Hampshire Soccer Association. Manchester is home 
to the Manchester Regional Youth Hockey Association. The Flames, as they 
are nicknamed, play primarily at the West Side Ice Arena but also have 
some games and practices at JFK. Football has always been popular in the 
Queen City. Youth football organizations in Manchester include: There are 
many other youth sports opportunities in Manchester, including AAU baseball 
and basketball as well as CYO basketball. McIntyre Ski Area is home to 
the McIntyre Ski Team, which is a member of NHARA and USSA. A club for 
a "sport for the mind" called FIRST is based in Manchester.[citation needed] 
Manchester is incorporated as a city under the laws of the State of New 
Hampshire, and operates under a strong mayoral form of government. The 
mayor serves as chairman of the fourteen-member Board of Mayor and Aldermen, 
the city's legislative body. Each of Manchester's twelve wards elects a 
single alderman, and two additional at-large members are elected citywide. 
The mayor also serves as the chair of the board of school committee. Like 
the board of aldermen, the school board has twelve members elected by ward 
and two at-large members. The School Board is not a city department; rather, 
it is a school district coterminous with the city, which obtains financing 
from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen. Manchester's public school system 
is run by the Manchester School District. Manchester School District has 
four public high schools: Manchester School District has four public middle 
schools and fourteen elementary schools. Manchester is served by four private 
high schools: In addition: Area institutions of higher education, together 
enrolling more than 8,000 students, include: The city is served by the 
following newspapers: the New Hampshire Union Leader (formerly the Manchester 
Union Leader), The Hippo, and the Manchester Mirror. The city is home to 
several AM and FM radio stations, as well as the following TV stations: 
Manchester is on the northern edge of the Boston television market. The 
city is served by Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, the fourth-largest 
passenger and third-largest cargo airport in New England. This airport 
is located off Brown Avenue (NH Route 3A), and it is the secondary airport 
serving Boston, Massachusetts. It is served by most of the nation's major 
airlines, with the largest market share held by Southwest Airlines. Alternative 
airports include Boston's Logan International Airport and Portland International 
Jetport in Maine. Interstates 93 and 293 and the F.E. Everett Turnpike 
are multi-lane highways that connect the metropolitan area to Concord and 
the White Mountains to the north and Nashua and Boston to the south. NH 
101 is a four-lane highway eastbound from Manchester to Hampton Beach, 
connecting the city with the southeastern part of the state and the seacoast, 
as well as Maine and the Massachusetts North Shore via Interstate 95. West 
of Manchester, NH 101 is a two-lane highway serving as the main artery 
to Keene, the Monadnock region, and other points in southwestern New Hampshire, 
eventually connecting to NH 9 and the state's border with Vermont. U.S. 
Route 3 and state routes 3A, 28, 28A, and Bypass 28 also flow through the 
city. A direct highway access with the airport connects the Everett Turnpike 
just south of the city with the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport via 
a Merrimack River-crossing connector road known as Raymond Wieczorek Drive 
(in honor of a former Manchester mayor instrumental in getting the access 
road built). The connector road also intersects with highways U.S. 3 and 
NH 3A. Public transportation is provided by the Manchester Transit Authority, 
which runs several bus routes throughout the city and surrounding areas. 
Concord Trailways and Boston Express run commuter services to Boston and 
other parts of the state. Vermont Transit Lines (affiliated with Greyhound 
Lines) has lines to Montreal. In 2008, Boston Express moved to suburb Londonderry, 
New Hampshire, and now provides only limited service to downtown Manchester. 
The possibility of Manchester being served by the Capital Corridor, an 
extension of the MBTA commuter rail from its current terminus in Lowell, 
Massachusetts, to Concord, which would also include a stop at Manchester-Boston 
Regional Airport, is being studied by the New Hampshire Rail Transit Authority 
and New Hampshire Department of Transportation, which have received federal 
funding for studying and planning the route.[42] The Capital Corridor route 
is also being studied as a possible future high-speed rail line connecting 
Montreal and Boston.[43] Currently, the Manchester-Nashua area is one of 
the 40 largest metropolitan areas in the United States without Amtrak service.[44] 
With the expansion of Interstate 93 to eight lanes from Salem to Manchester 
under construction, space is being reserved in the median for potential 
future commuter or light rail service along this corridor.[45] The I-93 
transit study also suggested restoring service on the Manchester and Lawrence 
branch for commuter and freight rail.[46] This corridor would support freight 
rail along with commuter, something that light rail cannot do. In late 
2011, Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and owner of several buildings 
in the Millyard, as well as co-founder of FIRST, proposed a rail loop for 
downtown and the Millyard. Several meetings have been held with area business 
and property owners, city officials and local developers, but the idea 
is in the early conceptual stages.[47] The downtown rail loop, if approved 
by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen, would be about three miles long and 
may be completed sometime around 2017. The loop would go from the Manchester 
Millyards, down south for about half a mile, then turn over Elm Street, 
separate into two rails (the other going towards Manchester-Boston Regional 
Airport), and climb north to Bridge Street and up to the New Hampshire 
Tower, where it ends. Law enforcement is provided by the Manchester Police 
Department. The Manchester police station is currently located at 405 Valley 
Street on the corner of Valley and Maple. The Hillsborough County Department 
of Corrections is located at 445 Willow Street. The prison houses an average 
of 500 inmates. The city of Manchester is protected all year by the 258 
paid, professional firefighters of the city of Manchester Fire Department. 
The department is currently commanded by a Chief of Department, James A. 
Burkush, two Deputy Chiefs, and five District Chiefs.[48][49] The Manchester 
Fire Department currently operates out of ten fire stations, located throughout 
the city, and operate a fire apparatus fleet of ten engines, five trucks, 
one rescue, and one district chief (two if manpower permits). The Manchester 
Fire Department currently responds to over 18,000 emergency calls annually.[50][51][52]
