In baseball, a triple is a hit in which the batter advances to third base 
in one play, with neither the benefit of a fielding error nor another runner 
being put out on a fielder's choice.[1] Triples were more common in baseball's 
dead-ball era, when teams relied more on stolen bases and hit and run plays 
than on the home run.[2] More distant fences in old ballparks, such as 
Pittsburgh's Forbes Field and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, also produced fewer 
home runs and more triples on well-hit balls.[3] As a result, most of the 
players on this list have been retired for decades.[4] In 2006, the Hardball 
Times lamented the decline of the 100-triple player, although three have 
joined the list since that time.[5] Fangraphs, a statistical website, likewise 
noted the lack of modern 100-triple hitters in 2013.[6] Of the 162 Major 
League Baseball players who have hit 100 or more triples, 69 are members 
of Baseball's Hall of Fame.[7] Hall of Famer Sam Crawford of the Detroit 
Tigers holds the Major League Baseball triples record, with 309.[8][9] 
Second to him is his Tigers teammate,[10] Ty Cobb, with 297, the American 
League record.[11] Honus Wagner is third with 252, the National League 
record.[12] Jake Beckley (243), Roger Connor (233), Tris Speaker (222), 
Fred Clarke (220), and Dan Brouthers (205) are the only other players to 
have hit at least 200 triples. Only triples hit during the regular season 
are included in the totals (George Brett, Rafael Furcal, and Derek Jeter 
are tied for the record in post-season triples, with five).[13] Jim O'Rourke 
was the first player to reach the 100-triple mark, doing so with the New 
York Giants in 1886.[14] With Kenny Lofton's retirement after the 2007 
season, 2008 was the first season since 1885 in which no active player 
had more than 100 triples.[14] Carl Crawford hit his 100th triple in 2010, 
becoming the only active player on the list at that time. Jos√© Reyes became 
the latest player to reach the 100 triple plateau, doing so on April 8,
