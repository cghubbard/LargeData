Kevin Ray Tapani (born February 18, 1964 in Des Moines, Iowa) is a former 
Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the New York Mets, Minnesota 
Twins, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, and Chicago Cubs from 1989 
to 2001. Tapani was raised in Escanaba in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 
He quarterbacked Escanaba High School to the 1981 MHSAA Class A State Football 
Championship. He then went on to attend Central Michigan University where 
he was a star pitcher for the Chippewas from 1983 to 1986, finishing with 
a career record of 23-8, helping the Chippewas to three Mid-American Conference 
titles, and tossing a no-hitter against Eastern Michigan University in 
1986.[1] Tapani was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 9th round of the 
1985 MLB June Amateur Draft, but he did not sign. He was then selected 
on June 2, 1986 in the second round of the 1986 MLB June Amateur Draft 
by the Oakland Athletics.[2] He signed five days later and was assigned 
to Medford A's of the low Single-A Northwest League. However he didn't 
stay at Medford long as after stops in Modesto and Huntsville, he made 
his final start of his first season in professional baseball pitching for 
the Triple-A Tacoma Tigers and finished the year a combined 8-2 with a 
2.84 ERA and 47 strikeouts in 85 2/3 Innings.[3] 1987 found Tapani back 
at Single-A Modesto, despite dominating at the level the previous year, 
and turned in another good season with a 10-7 record, a 3.76 ERA, and 121 
strikouts in 148 1/3 innings. On December 11, a three-team trade was completed 
that saw Tapani and fellow A's minor league pitcher Wally Whitehurst move 
to the New York Mets, starter Bob Welch and reliever Matt Young move from 
the Los Angeles Dodgers to the A's, minor league pitcher Jack Savage go 
from the Dodgers to the New York Mets, shortstop Alfredo Griffin and closer 
Jay Howell move from the A's to the Dodgers, and reliever Jesse Orosco 
go from the Mets to the Dodgers. Following the trade, Tapani was again 
sent to single-A to start the 1988 season, but after 3 starts with the 
St. Lucie Mets in which he only allowed 3 earned runs in 19 innings, he 
was promoted to the Double-A Jackson Mets where he went 5-1 but only started 
5 of the 24 games he saw action in. As fellow future-Twin Rick Aguilera 
would see in his own climb to the major leagues, with no openings in the 
1988 Mets starting rotation of Dwight Gooden, Bob Ojeda, Sid Fernandez, 
Ron Darling, and young phenom David Cone, even promising starters were 
groomed in minor league bullpens since this was the only way to crack the 
big league pitching staff. 1989 saw Tapani start 7-5 with a 3.47 ERA for 
the Triple-A Tidewater Tides before being called up to the Mets in July. 
Tapani made his Major League debut on July 4, 1989. He entered the game 
in the 1st inning after starter Ojeda had given up eight runs to the Houston 
Astros while only getting two outs. Thrown into the fire, Tapani completed 
4 1/3 innings while giving up 2 hits, 3 walks, and only allowing one more 
run.[4] Over the next four weeks, he would only get into two more games, 
pitching a total of 7 2/3 innings in relief. On July 31, just prior to 
the end of the non-waiver trade deadline, Tapani was included in the blockbuster 
trade that sent 1988 A.L. Cy Young Award winner Frank Viola, who was vocal 
in his desire to get a big salary increase in free agency, from the Minnesota 
Twins to the Mets in exchange for major league swingman Rick Aguilera, 
minor league relievers Tim Drummond and Jack Savage, and phenom starter 
David West. Tapani was then thrown into the Twins starting rotation and 
finished the 1989 season 2-2 with a 3.86 ERA in 32 2/3 innings. After his 
promising debut, Tapani was made a fixture of the rotation in 1990 and 
finished the season 12-8 with 4.07 ERA - good enough for 5th place in the 
AL Rookie of the Year balloting (a distant 131 votes behind the winner, 
Cleveland Indians' catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. He would follow up his rookie 
season with perhaps his best overall season in 1991, finishing 16-9 with 
only 40 walks and 135 strikeouts in 244 innings with 2.99 ERA - his lowest 
and only sub-3.00 ERA of his career. He then garnered enough Cy Young votes 
to finish a distant seventh behind winner Roger Clemens and teammates Scott 
Erickson and Jack Morris who finished second and fourth respectively. Over 
his 7 seasons with the Twins, Tapani was a workhorse starter the Twins 
who averaged more than 13 wins and over 200 innings in his five full seasons. 
After suffering through three poor seasons (the beginning of what would 
be eight consecutive losing seasons) and looking at losing the soon to 
be free agent Tapani after the 1995 season, the Twins traded him on July 
31 to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Ron Coomer, Chris Latham, Jos√© Parra, 
and Greg Hansell. Unfortunately this was a largely forgettable trade on 
the Twins' part as only Coomer would be only useful player to come over 
from the Dodgers. After finishing 4-2 down the stretch for the Dodgers, 
Tapani pitched in Game 3 against the Cincinnati Reds in the National League 
Divisional series and gave up 3 runs and 4 walks in only 1/3 of an inning 
in relief of starter Hideo Nomo in a 10-1 loss that capped off the Reds' 
3-0 sweep.[5] After being granted Free Agency in December 1995, Tapani 
signed a one-year contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 3, 1996 
and turned in another typical "Tapani" season for the Sox - finishing 13-10 
with a 4.59 ERA and 150 strikeouts in 225 1/3 innings. After again being 
granted free agency following the 1996 season, Tapani moved across town 
and signed a five-year contract with the Cubs on December 13. On July 20, 
1998 while playing for the Cubs, Tapani had perhaps the most memorable 
day of his career. Throwing 8 innings against the Braves, he allowed just 
three runs and topped it off by hitting a third inning grand slam off former 
Twins teammate Denny Neagle in an 11-4 romp over the Atlanta Braves.[6] 
In his career, Tapani pitched adeptly in both the American League and National 
League, and played his last game on September 27, 2001. His career record: 
143 wins, 125 losses, and an ERA of 4.35. In 1998 with the Chicago Cubs, 
Tapani earned his best record of 19-9, though his ERA was 4.85. In 1991, 
with the Twins, Tapani had his lowest ERA of 2.99 to go with a 16-9 record 
and 7th place in the 1991 Cy Young Award voting. After retirement, Tapani 
returned to his home in Minnetonka, MN to live with his wife and three 
children, Sarah (b 1991), Ryan (b 1994), and Luke (b 1996).[7] In 1999, 
Tapani was elected as a member of the Central Michigan Athletics Hall of 
Fame.[1] He has been involved with little league and youth baseball since 
his retirement including coaching both of his sons' teams.[8] Currently 
Kevin is a high school baseball coach at Providence Academy in Plymouth,
