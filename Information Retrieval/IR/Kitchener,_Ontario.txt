The City of Kitchener /ˈkɪtʃᵻnər/ is a city in Southern Ontario, Canada. 
Located approximately 100 km west of Toronto, Kitchener is the seat of 
the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. It was the Town of Berlin from 1854 
until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916. The city had a 
population of 219,153 in the 2011 Census and a population of 239,900 at 
year end 2015 as estimated by the Region of Waterloo.[3] The metropolitan 
area, which includes the neighbouring cities of Waterloo and Cambridge, 
has 507,096 people,[4] making it the tenth largest Census Metropolitan 
Area (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario.[5] The city 
is adjacent to the smaller cities of Cambridge to the south, and Waterloo 
to the north. Kitchener and Waterloo are often referred to jointly as "Kitchener-Waterloo" 
(K-W), although they have separate municipal governments. Including Cambridge, 
the three cities are known as "the Tri-Cities". The City of Kitchener covers 
an area of 136.86 square kilometres. Kitchener is located in Southwestern 
Ontario, in the Saint Lawrence Lowlands. This geological and climatic region 
has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Located in the Grand River 
Valley, the area is generally above 300m (1000') in elevation. Kitchener 
is the largest city situated within the Grand River watershed, and the 
largest city on the Haldimand Tract. Just to the west of the city is Baden 
Hill, in Wilmot Township. This glacial kame remnant formation is the highest 
elevation for many miles around. The other dominant glacial feature is 
the Waterloo Moraine, which snakes its way through the region and holds 
a significant quantity of artesian wells, from which the city derives most 
of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate 
description of the higher points of the moraine. Kitchener has a humid 
continental climate of the warm summer subtype (Dfb under the Köppen climate 
classification); there are large seasonal differences, usually warm and 
humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions 
generally last from the mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures 
generally occur between mid-May to close to the end of September. March 
2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener - between 16 and 22 March, 
temperatures ranged from 21.4 °C (70.5 °F) to 27.0 °C (80.6 °F)—7 record 
highs in a row. 19 March high of 24 °C (75.2 °F) is one of the highest 
winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of 27 °C (80.6 °F) 
is the highest for March in this area. Temperatures during the year can 
exceed 30 °C (86.0 °F) in the summer and drop below −20 °C (−4.0 °F) in 
the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures 
are rare. The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free 
days a year,[6] a much more limited number than cities on the Great Lakes 
due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages 160 centimetres 
(63 in) per year, high but not nearly as areas more directly affected by 
lake effect snow. The highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was 
38.3 °C (101 °F) on August 6 & 7, 1918 and July 27, 1941.[7][8] The coldest 
temperature ever recorded was −34.1 °C (−29.4 °F) on February 16, 2015.[9] 
In 1784, the land that Kitchener was built upon was an area given to the 
Six Nations by the British as a gift for their allegiance during the American 
Revolution; 240,000 hectares of land to be exact. From 1796 and 1798, the 
Six Nations sold 38,000 hectares of this land to a Loyalist by the name 
of Colonel Richard Beasley. The portion of land that Beasley had purchased 
was remote but it was of great interest to German Mennonite farming families 
from Pennsylvania. They wanted to live in an area that would allow them 
to practice their beliefs without persecution. Eventually, the Mennonites 
purchased all of Beasley's unsold land creating 160 farm tracts. By 1800, 
the first buildings were built,[15] and over the next decade several families 
made the difficult trip north to what was then known as the Sand Hills. 
One of these Mennonite families, arriving in 1807, were the Schneiders, 
whose restored 1816 home (the oldest building in the city) is now a museum 
located in the heart of Kitchener.[16] Other families whose names can still 
be found in local place names were the Bechtels, the Ebys, the Erbs, the 
Weavers (better known today as the Webers), the Cressmans and the Brubachers. 
In 1816 the Government of Upper Canada designated the settlement the Township 
of Waterloo. Much of the land, made up of moraines and swampland interspersed 
with rivers and streams, was converted to farmland and roads. Wild pigeons, 
which once swarmed by the tens of thousands, were driven from the area. 
Apple trees were introduced to the region by John Eby in the 1830s, and 
several grist- and sawmills (most notably Joseph Schneider's 1816 sawmill, 
John and Abraham Erb's grist- and sawmills and Eby's cider mill) were erected 
throughout the area. Schneider built the town's first road, from his home 
to the corner of King Street and Queen Street (then known as Walper corner). 
$1000 was raised by the settlers to extend the road from Walper corner 
to Huether corner, where the Huether Brewery was built and the Huether 
Hotel now stands; a petition to the government for $100 to assist in completing 
the project was denied. Immigration to the town increased considerably 
from 1816 until the 1870s, many of the newcomers being of German (particularly 
Lutheran, and Mennonite) extraction. Some were from Switzerland, like the 
founder of The Arthur Pequegnat Clock Company. In 1833 the town was renamed 
Berlin because of the recent German immigration from the Breuckmann family, 
and in 1853 Berlin became the County Seat of the newly created County of 
Waterloo, elevating it to the status of Village. The extension of the Grand 
Trunk Railway from Sarnia to Toronto (and hence through Berlin) in July 
1856 was a major boon to the community, helping to improve industrialization 
in the area. Immigrants from Germany, mostly Lutheran and Catholic, dominated 
the city after 1850 and developed their own newer German celebrations, 
and influences, such as the Turner societies, gymnastics, and band music. 
On 9 June 1912, Berlin was officially designated a city.[17] Anti-German 
sentiment during World War I led to the abandonment of much of this heritage. 
For example, churches switched to English-language services. In 1916, following 
much debate and controversy, the name of the city was changed to Kitchener; 
named after the late British Field Marshal The 1st Earl Kitchener.[17] 
After the war, local historians and civic groups promoted a new heritage 
that emphasized the county's Pennsylvania Dutch roots. Illustrated souvenir 
books, a popular novel, and site markers celebrated this simplified, nationalistic 
version of the founding.[18] On 17 September 1981, the first-ever "blue 
box" recycling program in the world was launched in Kitchener.[19] Today, 
more than 90% of Ontario households have access to recycling programs and 
annually they divert more than 650,000 tonnes of secondary resource materials. 
The blue box program has expanded in various forms throughout Canada and 
to countries around the world such as the United States, United Kingdom, 
France and Australia, serving more than 40 million households around the 
world. Kitchener’s economic heritage is rooted in manufacturing. Industrial 
artifacts are located in public places throughout the city as a celebration 
of its manufacturing history.[20] While the local economy’s reliance on 
manufacturing has decreased in recent years, 20.36% of the labour force 
remains employed in the manufacturing sector.[21] The city is home to four 
municipal business parks: the Bridgeport Business Park, Grand River West 
Business Park, Huron Business Park and Lancaster Corporate Centre. The 
largest, the Huron Business Park, is home to a number of industries, from 
seat manufacturers to furniture components.[22] In recent years, Kitchener’s 
economy has diversified to include new high-value economic clusters. In 
addition to Kitchener’s internationally recognized finance and insurance 
and manufacturing clusters, digital media and health science clusters are 
emerging within the city.[23] Beginning in 2004, the City of Kitchener 
has launched several initiatives to re-energize the downtown core. These 
initiatives have included heavy investment, on behalf of the City and its 
partners, and the creation of a Downtown Kitchener Action Plan.[24] The 
modern incarnation of its historic farmers’ market, opened in 2004. The 
Kitchener Market is one of the oldest consistently operating markets in 
Canada. The Kitchener Market features local producers, international cuisine, 
artisans, and crafters.[25] In 2009, the City of Kitchener began a project 
to reconstruct and revitalize the main street in Kitchener’s downtown core, 
King Street. In the reconstruction of King Street, several features were 
added to make the street more friendly to pedestrians. New lighting was 
added to the street, sidewalks were widened, and curbs were lowered. Movable 
Bollards were installed to add flexibility to the streetscape, accommodating 
main street events and festivals. In 2010, the redesigned King Street was 
awarded the International Community Places Award for its flexible design 
intended to draw people into the downtown core.[26] In 2009, Tree Canada 
recognized King Street as a green street.[27] The redesigned King Street 
features several environmentally sustainable elements such as new street 
trees, bike racks, planter beds that collect and filter storm water, street 
furnishing made primarily from recycled materials, and an improved waste 
management system. The street itself was also reconstructed using recycled 
roadway and paving stones.[28] In September 2012, the City of Toronto used 
Kitchener’s King Street as a model for Celebrate Yonge—a month-long event 
which reduced Yonge Street to two lanes, widening sidewalks to improve 
the commercial street for businesses and pedestrians alike.[29] The groundbreaking 
ceremony for the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy and downtown 
health sciences campus was officially held on 15 March 2006, and the facility 
opened in spring 2009. The building is located on King Street near Victoria 
Street, on the site of the old Epton plant, across the street from the 
Kaufman Lofts (formerly the Kaufman shoe factory). McMaster University 
subsequently opened a satellite campus for its Michael G. DeGroote School 
of Medicine, located directly adjacent to the University of Waterloo’s 
School of Pharmacy. The Health Sciences Campus has been central to the 
emergence of Kitchener’s health science cluster.[30] In 2007, Cadan Inc., 
a Toronto-based real estate development company, bought what was formerly 
the Lang Tannery for $10 million. Supported by the local government, Cadan 
repurposed the building as a space for commercial firms. Since its refurbishment, 
the Tannery has become a hub for digital media companies, both large and 
small.[31] Desire2Learn, an e-learning company, located in the Tannery 
as the company expanded. In 2011, Communitech moved into the Tannery. Home 
to over 800 companies, Communitech is a hub for innovative high-tech companies 
in the fields of information technology, digital media, biomedical, aerospace, 
environmental technology and advanced manufacturing. Also in 2011, high-tech 
giant Google Inc. became a tenant of the Tannery, furthering its reputation 
as a home for leading high-tech companies.[32] The Kitchener office is 
a large hub for the development for Google's Gmail application.[33] In 
2016, the University of Waterloo-sponsored startup hub Velocity Garage 
relocated to the building, bringing over 100 additional startup companies 
into the Tannery.[34] The Province of Ontario has committed to building 
a new provincial courthouse in downtown Kitchener, on the block bordered 
by Frederick, Duke, Scott and Weber streets. The new courthouse is expected 
to create new jobs, mainly for the courthouse itself, but also for other 
businesses, especially law offices. The new courthouse construction began 
in 2010. The courthouse is scheduled to open in 2012.[35] In the downtown 
area, several factories have been transformed into upscale lofts and residences. 
In September 2010, construction began on the ‘City Centre’ redevelopment 
project in downtown Kitchener. This redevelopment project will include 
condominium units, new retail spaces, private and public parking, a gallery, 
and a boutique hotel.[36] The former Arrow shirt factory has been converted 
into a luxury, high-rise apartment building, featuring loft condominiums.[36] 
In 2012, Desire2Learn, located in downtown Kitchener, received $80 million 
in venture capitalist funding from OMERS Ventures and New Enterprise Associates.[37] 
At the time of the Canada 2006 Census, the population of Kitchener was 
204,668.[1] In the Canada 2011 Census, the population of Kitchener was 
219,153. By gender, 49.2% of the population was male and 50.8% was female. 
Children under five accounted for approximately 6.0% of the resident population 
of Kitchener, compared to 5.5% in Ontario, and 5.3% for Canada overall. 
Some 11.7% of the resident population in Kitchener was of retirement age, 
a smaller proportion of the population compared to 13.6% in Ontario, and 
13.7% in Canada. The median age was 37 years, younger than the 39 years 
for Ontario, and 40 years for Canada. In the five years between 2001 and 
2006, the population of Kitchener grew by 7.5%, higher than the growth 
rates for both Ontario (6.6%) and Canada (5.4%). Population density of 
Kitchener was 1,495 people per square kilometre. According to the 2006 
Census, most of the population is of European ancestry; the city has a 
substantial concentration of German Canadians. 15.4 percent of the population 
claimed to be members of a visible minority. The largest visible minority 
groups are: Black: 3.2%, South Asian: 3.1%, Latin American: 2.2%, Southeast 
Asian: 2.0%, Chinese: 1.4%, and Others.[1] From the 2001 census, 78.85% 
of the population adhered to various Christian denominations. Members of 
Protestant churches formed 41.3%, followed by Roman Catholics (32.4%), 
while the remaining 5.1% follow other Christian denominations such as Eastern 
Orthodox, LDS, Jehovah's Witness.etc.[45] Other religions include Islam: 
2.24%, Hindu: 1.00%, plus others including Judaism, Sikhism, Buddhism and 
Baha'i, while 15.6% claim no religious affiliation at all. Kitchener is 
governed by a council of ten councillors, representing wards (or districts), 
and a mayor.[46] Council is responsible for policy and decision making, 
monitoring the operation and performance of the city, analyzing and approving 
budgets and determining spending priorities. The residents of each ward 
vote for one person to be their city councillor; their voice and representative 
on city council. Kitchener residents also elect four councillors at large 
to sit with the mayor on the council of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. 
Municipal elections are held every four years in late October. The current 
mayor of Kitchener is Berry Vrbanovic, who was elected to his first term 
in October 2014. See Kitchener City Council for a complete list of councillors. 
In 1976, residents of Kitchener voted almost 2:1 in favour of a ward system. 
The first municipal election held under the ward system occurred in 1978. 
In 2010, the city underwent a ward boundary review. A consultant proposed 
boundaries for a 10-ward system for the 2010 municipal election, adding 
4 additional councillors and wards to replace the previous 6-ward system.[47] 
The current Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Kitchener Centre 
is Daiene Vernile. Other MPPs include Michael Harris (Kitchener-Conestoga) 
and Catherine Fife (Kitchener-Waterloo) who both represent small portions 
of the city in addition to adjacent areas. The federal Members of Parliament 
(MPs) are as follows: Raj Saini (Kitchener Centre), Harold Albrecht (Kitchener-Conestoga), 
Marwan Tabbara (Kitchener South—Hespeler) and The Hon. Bardish Chagger 
(Waterloo). Kitchener has several public high schools, with Kitchener-Waterloo 
Collegiate and Vocational School, founded in 1855, being the oldest. It 
is located in the northern area of the City not far from the boundary of 
Waterloo. In the 1950s and 1960s several new schools were constructed, 
including Eastwood Collegiate Institute in what was then the southeastern 
part of the city in 1956, Forest Heights Collegiate Institute in the western 
Forest Heights part of the city in 1964, Grand River Collegiate Institute 
in the northeastern Heritage Park/Grand River Village area in 1966, and 
Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute in the southern area of the Downtown 
core in 1967. In 2006, Huron Heights Secondary School opened in southwest 
Kitchener. It opened with a limited enrollment of only 9th and 10th grade 
students, and has since expanded to full capacity in the 2008-2009 school 
year. The oldest Catholic high school in the city is St. Mary's High School, 
which opened in 1907. Originally a girls-only Catholic school, it was transformed 
into a co-ed institution in 1990 after the closure of the neighbouring 
St. Jerome's High School, which had been a boys-only Catholic school. The 
same year, a second Catholic high school, Resurrection Catholic Secondary 
School, opened in the west of the city. In 2002, St. Mary's abandoned its 
downtown location in favour of a new one in the city's southwest. The former 
St. Jerome's High School currently houses the Lyle S. Hallman Faculty of 
Social Work from Wilfrid Laurier University. It opened at this location 
in 2006, bringing 300 faculty, staff and students to downtown Kitchener.[48] 
The former St. Mary's High School building, meanwhile, has been transformed 
into both the head office of the Waterloo Catholic District School Board 
and the Kitchener Downtown Community Centre. The Doon neighbourhood, formerly 
a separate village but now part of Kitchener, is home to the primary campus 
of Conestoga College, one of the foremost non-university educational institutions 
in the province. For nine consecutive years, Conestoga has earned top overall 
ranking among Ontario colleges on the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) surveys, 
which measures graduate employment rates and satisfaction levels, and employer 
and student satisfaction. It is one of only seven polytechnical institutes 
in Canada.[49] The University of Waterloo opened a School of Pharmacy in 
the downtown area. The City of Kitchener has contributed $30 million from 
its $110 million Economic Development Investment Fund, established in 2004, 
to the establishment of the UW Downtown Kitchener School of Pharmacy. Construction 
began in 2006, and the pharmacy program was launched in January 2008 with 
92 students.[50] The school is expected to graduate about 120 pharmacists 
annually and will become the home of the Centre for Family Medicine, where 
new family physicians will be trained, as well as an optometry clinic and 
the International Pharmacy Graduate Program. Construction on the $147 million 
facility was largely finished in spring 2009. The University of Waterloo's 
(UW) Downtown Kitchener Health Sciences Campus is also the site of a satellite 
campus for McMaster University's School of Medicine. The Michael G. DeGroote 
School of Medicine admits 28 students per year to the MD program at the 
Waterloo Regional Campus. Students complete their clinical placements at 
hospitals and medical centres in the Waterloo-Wellington Region.[51] McMaster's 
satellite campus also features the Centre for Family Medicine, a family 
health team, and the University of Waterloo's School of Optometry clinic.[52] 
Kitchener-Waterloo is served by three hospitals, Grand River Hospital (which 
is a system of two hospitals), St. Mary's General Hospital, and Cambridge 
Memorial. Grand River treats patients with a wide range of problems and 
houses the psychiatric unit, trauma centre, women's and children's services, 
and the Regional Cancer Care Centre. St Mary's houses the Regional Cardiac 
Care Centre, serving a population of nearly one million from Waterloo Region, 
east to Guelph, north to Owen Sound/Tobermory, south to Lake Erie, and 
west to Ingersoll. It also houses a respiratory centre. Both hospitals 
have emergency departments and intensive care units. Cambridge Memorial 
is a general hospital, treating primarily patients from Cambridge and south 
Kitchener. Long term rehabilitation and physiotherapy is addressed at the 
Freeport Health Centre, at the south of the city. Built originally as a 
tuberculosis sanatorium and home for the terminally ill,[53] its last link 
with that past is the palliative care unit. It nestles along the banks 
of the Grand River, and is part of Grand River Hospital. Family doctors 
are in short supply in K-W, and a source of great concern among residents. 
The Chamber of Commerce runs a waiting list for people looking for a doctor, 
but as of 2006 the wait is over two years. Two urgent care centres cater 
for much of the routine services for thousands of people without a family 
doctor, from routine immunisations and health screening, to repeat prescriptions 
and referral on to specialist services. A third urgent care centre is being 
added to a renovated supermarket development in the desirable Forest Heights 
area of the city. Announced January 2006 was the inauguration of a new 
School of Medicine, the Waterloo Regional Campus of McMaster University. 
The campus currently trains 28 students per year. From 2007, 15 new family 
doctors will be trained each year in new premises being constructed in 
the downtown core on rehabilitated industrial lands along the railway. 
In 2009, the mental health unit is slated for relocation from the downtown 
core to an unused floor at the Freeport site. By this, patients needing 
mental health care shall gain options for local long term care and monitoring. 
The current site for the unit is in the basement of the downtown hospital 
in an area in dire need of renovations and the absence of options for local 
long-term mental care forces the transfer of such patients to neighbouring 
London, Ontario. After renovations, the Child and Adolescent Inpatient 
Program will be moved from a small 9-bed wing to the downstairs in place 
of the current adult mental health unit. Once moved in 2009, upwards of 
26 beds shall be available to this program. Kitchener's cultural highlights 
include CAFKA, The Open Ears Festival, IMPACT theatre festival, the Multicultural 
Festival, the Kitchener Blues Festival and KidsPark, many of which are 
free to the public. Kitchener is also home to venues such as Homer Watson 
House & Gallery, Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery, THEMUSEUM, JM Drama Alumni 
and Centre In The Square. Also the Cities recently had two local and regional 
museums built in the region, one being the Waterloo Region Children Museum 
and the Doon Heritage Museum. Live music by popular artists can be heard 
at venues such as Centre In The Square and The Aud. The Kitchener Public 
Library is another community stalwart. Kitchener is also home to independent 
music label, Busted Flat Records which features the music of many Kitchener-Waterloo 
based musicians. Kitchener-Waterloo's Oktoberfest celebration is an annual 
nine-day event that started in 1969.[54] Based on the original German Oktoberfest, 
it is billed as Canada's Greatest Bavarian Festival. It is held every October, 
starting on the Friday before Canadian Thanksgiving and running until the 
Saturday after. It is the largest Bavarian festival in the world outside 
of Germany. While its best-known draws are the beer-based celebrations, 
other family and cultural events also fill the week. The best-known is 
the Oktoberfest Thanksgiving Day Parade held on Thanksgiving Day; as it 
is the only major parade on Canadian Thanksgiving, it is televised nationally. 
Another icon of the festival is Miss Oktoberfest. This position was formerly 
selected in a televised beauty pageant, with the applicants coming from 
across Canada and the US. The position is now selected by a closed committee 
of judges from a panel of local applicants; community involvement and personal 
character form the main criteria under the new system. Various locations 
in both Kitchener and Waterloo were used to portray the fictional Ontario 
town of Wessex in the filming of Canadian television sitcom, Dan for Mayor,[55] 
starring Corner Gas star Fred Ewanuick. A local folk group, Destroy All 
Robots, wrote a tongue-in-cheek song jibing the city of Kitchener in the 
song "Battle Hymn of the City of Kitchener, Ontario".[56] The Kitchener 
Blues Festival is a 4-day festival in downtown Kitchener dedicated to blues 
music, always held in August on the weekend following the civic holiday. 
The festival has expanded to 4 stages and 2 workshop stages throughout 
the downtown area, with over 90 performances. The festival has grown from 
a 1-day event with an attendance of 3,000 to a 4-day event with over 150,000 
attending. In 2014 the Kitchener Blues Festival celebrated its 14th year.[57] 
This is a 2-day event in Victoria Park commencing usually on the first 
weekend of the summer. The festival features foods, dance and music from 
around the world. The festival also showcases several vendors that sell 
artifacts and crafts from around the world. This festival has been ongoing 
for well over 40 years. Well over 50,000 attend every year.[58] KOI Music 
Festival is a 3-day festival held annually in downtown Kitchener each September. 
The festival was started in 2010 and has since expanded to include a free 
concert on Friday and a full day of performance Saturday and Sunday. KOI 
features 100+ rock bands every year, with a large focus on local, independent 
musicians. Notable past performers include Every Time I Die, Ubiquitous 
Synergy Seeker, Chiodos, Walk Off The Earth, Four Year Strong, Protest 
the Hero, Mad Caddies, Monster Truck (band), Gob (band), Treble Charger, 
Cute Is What We Aim For, The Planet Smashers, Bayside (band), and several 
hundred more.[59] Kultrún is an annual festival of World Music, food, culture, 
and art that takes place in Victoria Park each July. During Kultrún, music 
from various cultures is performed on two stages, and the rest of the park 
is covered with vendors selling their goods. A key part of the festival 
is the large number of food stands selling foods from all different ethnic 
backgrounds.[60][61] Kitchener's oldest and most important outdoor park 
is Victoria Park, in the heart of downtown Kitchener. Numerous events and 
festivities are held in this park. A cast-bronze statue of Queen Victoria 
is located in Victoria Park, along with a cannon. The statue was unveiled 
in May 1911, on Victoria Day (the Queen's birthday) in the tenth year after 
her death. The Princess of Wales Chapter of the IODE raised the $6,000 
needed for the monument.[62] Another significant beauty spot in the city 
is Rockway Gardens. Adjacent to the Rockway golf course, the gardens occupy 
a long narrow strip of land alongside King Street as it rushes down to 
meet the Conestoga Parkway and become Highway 8. Here there are many fountains, 
ponds, waterfalls and rock grottoes. It is a popular site for wedding photos 
in the summer months. Kitchener has an extensive and safe community trail 
system. The trails, which are controlled and run by the city, are hundreds 
of kilometres in length. Due to Kitchener's close proximity to the Grand 
River, several community trails and paths border the river's shores. This 
convenient access to the Grand River has drawn nature-seeking tourists 
to the city. However, Kitchener's trails and especially natural areas remain 
underfunded by city council and as a result, many are not adequately maintained.[63] 
In 2011, a bike park located at the newly constructed McLennan Park, in 
the city's south end, was hailed as one of the best city-run bike parks 
in Southern Ontario[64] by BMX and mountain biking enthusiasts.[65] The 
bike park offers a four-cross (4X) section, a pump track section, a jump 
park, and a free-ride course.[66] McLennan Park also features an accessible 
play area, a splash pad, basketball courts, beach volleyball courts, a 
leash-free dog area, and a toboggan hill.[67] Chicopee Ski Club is also 
located inside city limit. Kitchener was very proactive and visionary about 
its transportation network in the 1960s, with the province undertaking 
at that time construction of the Conestoga Parkway from the western boundary 
(just past Homer Watson Boulevard) across the south side of the city and 
looping north along the Grand River to Northfield Drive in Waterloo. Subsequent 
upgrades took the Conestoga west beyond Trussler Road and north towards 
St Jacobs, with eight lanes through its middle stretch. The Conestoga Parkway 
bears the provincial highway designations of Highways 7 and 8. King Street 
becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Conestoga in the south and leads down 
to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport 
to the Preston area of Cambridge. Up until construction of the Conestoga, 
Highland Road through Baden had been the primary highway to Stratford. 
Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to Guelph but 
this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at 
the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to 
the old route. There are two interchanges with Highway 401 on Kitchener's 
southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into 
the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson 
Boulevard. In order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange 
has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the 
rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported 
by the Region of Waterloo, the MTO has no plans to date to proceed with 
an interchange at Trussler Road. Unlike most southern Ontario cities whose 
streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets 
are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most 
familiar to the German settlers. There is good historical reason for this. 
Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived 
in advance of government surveyors.[citation needed] The Mennonites who 
had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from 
Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number 
of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on 
individual farms.[citation needed] There was no grid survey done—no lines, 
no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time 
to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network 
on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland 
and southern Germany. This is a Continental Radial pattern and the result 
was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of 
smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as 
the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced 
the horse, might someday have become roundabouts decorated with circular 
gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point 
intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas. 
In 2004, roundabouts were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.[68] Besides 
improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from 
emissions created by idling vehicles. In 2006, the first two were installed 
along Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener. Some people argue roundabouts 
are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned 
historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British 
grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making 
the point irrelevant. For forty years, there has been a sharply controversial 
plan to extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,[69] but 
the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east-west arterials 
between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is now forcing this development 
ahead. Most streets that cross the municipal boundary between Kitchener 
and Waterloo retain the same street name in both cities. However, several 
streets which are divided into east and west sections in Kitchener shift 
to a north-south division in Waterloo. This primarily affects Weber and 
King Streets and Westmount Road. Since these roads do not actually change 
their primary directional alignment significantly, (Weber Street and King 
Street, supposedly "Parallel" streets, cross 3 times), the shift in labelling 
can create confusion, since each of the aforementioned thoroughfares bears 
the labels north, south, west, and east on certain segments. However, it 
also reduces the potential confusion that would result from having separate 
west and east segments of the same street existing simultaneously in both 
cities. The problem with giving streets in Waterloo Region compass-based 
labels, and attempting to divide each of the cities into quadrants comes 
from the radial layout of the roads, and the historical patterns of development. 
Waterloo's quadrants, created by the intersection of King and Erb Streets, 
roughly correspond to compass directions, but Kitchener's quadrants, delineated 
by King and Queen Streets, do not resemble compass directions whatsoever. 
A notable case is that of Lancaster Street, which runs almost exactly north-south, 
but is designated as east-west, since it crosses Queen Street, which divides 
the "east" and "west" halves of the city, yet follows a northeast-southwest 
orientation itself. Since 2000, public transport throughout the Region 
of Waterloo has been provided by Grand River Transit, which was created 
by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit. GRT 
operate a number of bus routes in Kitchener, with many running into Waterloo 
and two connecting to Cambridge. In September 2005, GRT added an express 
bus route called iXpress from downtown Cambridge through Kitchener to north 
Waterloo.[70] In 2003, Regional Council unanimously adopted the Regional 
Growth Management Strategy. As a response, proposals were put forth regarding 
a rapid transit system serving the downtown cores of all three cities. 
An Environmental Assessment was completed in 2009 which recommended a light 
rail transit route starting from Conestoga Mall in north Waterloo and ending 
at the Ainslie Street bus terminal in Cambridge. In June 2009, Regional 
Council voted nearly unanimously for the recommendations in the EA. During 
2011, the decision was made to execute the construction of the LRT with 
some financial backing by the provincial and federal governments. The project 
was then given the name ION in 2012. Currently, they are in the process 
of constructing the Stage 1 of ION. Stage 1 includes the creation of an 
LRT system from Fairview Park Mall located in Kitchener to Conestoga Mall 
located in Waterloo. It also includes the addition of adapted bus rapid 
transit(aBRT) from Fairview Park mall to Ainslie Street Terminal in Cambridge. 
Service is expected to begin the fall of 2017 for Stage 1. Later, Stage 
2 will involve replacing the aBRT to LRT.[71] On 31 October 2009, GO Transit 
began to provide service to Kitchener with regional bus service from Charles 
Street Terminal to Mississauga (Square One Bus Terminal) on weekdays and 
weekends. On 19 December 2011, GO Transit began train service to Kitchener 
with 2 weekday each direction to Union Station in Toronto. The route has 
been renamed from Georgetown GO Line to Kitchener GO Line to reflect this 
extension. Passenger rail service has long been a point of frustration 
for residents of Kitchener and its neighbouring cities. Two main lines 
come westward out of Toronto and then meet up again in London. The northern 
line passes through Guelph, Kitchener and Stratford to London. The southern 
line goes along the heavily populated lakeshore to Oakville, then Brantford, 
Woodstock, and then to London. This southern line is the primary rail corridor 
for CN, while the northern line through Kitchener is owned by a short-line 
railway called the Goderich-Exeter Railway (GEXR). The track and signalling 
conditions on the north and south route are very different, so that trains 
on the southern route can operate more frequently and faster, while trains 
on the northern route take 1 hour and 40 minutes on average to get from 
Kitchener to Toronto. In addition, because it is a single-track route, 
trains often need to pull into sidings to let oncoming trains pass. Consequently, 
Kitchener, with a regional population base equal to London and situated 
much closer to metropolitan Toronto, gets less than one third the frequency 
of passenger rail service. Passenger service is provided by Via Rail. Two 
trains in each direction travelling between Sarnia and Toronto stop at 
the Kitchener railway station daily.[72] The station is slightly to the 
northeast of the city's downtown on Weber Street near its intersection 
with Victoria Street. GO Transit bus service began in Kitchener on 31 October 
2009, connecting to the Milton GO Station and Mississuaga City Centre GO 
Terminal. GO Train service from the Kitchener railway station began on 
19 December 2011. Freight trains in Kitchener are operated by the Goderich-Exeter 
Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway. These railways serve several 
customers (including ThyssenKrupp Budd), many of which are located in industrial 
parks in southern Kitchener. The closest airport to Kitchener is the Region 
of Waterloo International Airport in nearby Breslau, but while it is a 
thriving general-aviation field, it is not heavily served by scheduled 
airlines. Most air travellers use Toronto's Lester B. Pearson International 
Airport or John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. Currently, there 
are three commercial airlines serving the area (two year round, one seasonal): 
WestJet to Calgary, Envoy Air to Chicago and Sunwing Airlines to Cayo Santa 
Maria. Officially there are 10 wards, and 53 planning communities or neighbourhoods.[73] 
There are also 29 neighbourhood associations recognized by the city, which 
in some cases do not correspond to the names and boundaries of planning 
communities designated by the City. In some cases the neighbourhood associations 
cover several neighbourhoods and/or planning communities and the name of 
one neighbourhood is sometimes used to refer to the entire area. The Stanley 
Park Neighbourhood Association, for example, covers much of the eastern 
and southeastern area of the city including the planning communities of 
Stanley Park, Heritage Park, Idlewood, and Grand River North and South. 
Further complicating things, is that the first area of development named 
Stanley Park, which is where Stanley Park school is located and where Stanley 
Park Conservation Area is located, has been included within the city's 
planning district of Heritage Park, leaving only later-developed areas 
of Stanley Park plus an adjacent residential neighbourhood to the south, 
originally referred to as Sunnyside, in the Stanley Park planning neighbourhood. 
The Forest Heights Neighbourhood Association includes the Forest Heights 
neighbourhood/planning district to the east of Forest Heights proper.[74]
