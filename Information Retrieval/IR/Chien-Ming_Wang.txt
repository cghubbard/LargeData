Chien-Ming Wang (Chinese: 王建民; pinyin: Wáng Jiànmín; born March 31, 1980) 
is a Taiwanese professional baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent. 
He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, 
Washington Nationals, Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals. He has 
also played for the Taiwan national baseball team and Southern Maryland 
Blue Crabs in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Wang signed 
as an amateur free agent with the Yankees in 2000. After working his way 
up the Yankees' minor league system for several seasons, he made his MLB 
debut in 2005. With his hard sinker, he was one of the best starting pitchers 
for the Yankees in 2006 and 2007, winning 19 games in both seasons and 
leading the American League in that category in 2006. He suffered a foot 
injury in 2008 that limited his appearances and effectiveness, and a series 
of arm injuries cost him most of the 2009 season and all of 2010. Wang 
returned to major leagues with the Washington Nationals in 2011, starting 
21 games over two seasons while again spending time on the disabled list. 
He signed with the Yankees in 2013 but was released without pitching in 
the major leagues, then signed with the Toronto Blue Jays and made six 
starts with limited effectiveness. He pitched for minor league teams in 
several organizations in 2014 and 2015. In 2016, he returned to the major 
leagues as a relief pitcher with the Kansas City Royals. Wang pitched for 
the national baseball team of Taiwan in the 2002 Asian Games. In 2004, 
as the apparent ace of the staff, Wang led Taiwan to the 2004 Olympic Games 
in Athens. Against Australia, he allowed just three hits with no walks, 
and at one point retired nine batters in a row, to earn the win. He also 
limited Japan to just five hits in the first six innings. He is the fourth 
major leaguer from Taiwan, following Dodgers outfielder Chin-Feng Chen, 
Rockies pitcher Chin-Hui Tsao and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hong-Chih 
Kuo. Since being called up to the majors, Wang has been idolized in Taiwan 
where all of his games have been televised nationwide, many on public big 
screens to large audiences. Because of this popularity, he was named one 
of the Time 100 for 2007.[1] At the 2013 World Baseball Classic, Wang started 
for the Taiwan team's opener against Australia and threw 6 shut out innings 
for the win.[2] Wang rose through the New York Yankees minor league system, 
including the Single-A Staten Island Yankees, who retired his #41 in 2006.[3] 
Wang posted a 1.75 ERA for Staten Island, second-lowest in franchise history.[4] 
He played for the World Team in the All-Star Futures Game in 2003. In 2005, 
Wang was called up from the Yankees' Triple-A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers. 
In 2013, Wang came back to the Yankees' Triple-A affiliate, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
RailRiders. Wang made his MLB debut on April 30, 2005. He pitched in 18 
games, though an injury kept him sidelined for part of the season. He went 
8–5 with an earned run average of 4.02. On September 19, 2005, Wang tied 
a record for assists in a game by a pitcher with nine. In the playoffs 
against the Angels, Wang pitched 6 2⁄3 innings and allowed 4 runs, only 
one of which was earned. The Yankees lost the game and the series. In 2006 
Wang won 19 games (tied for the most in the majors along with Johan Santana), 
posted a 3.63 ERA and even picked up his first save on June 3 against the 
Baltimore Orioles. Wang threw two complete games, though the first, on 
June 18, was bittersweet: against the Washington Nationals, he allowed 
a 1-out, 2-run, walk-off home run by Ryan Zimmerman to lose the game 3–2. 
His first complete game win was on July 28, 2006, a 2-hit, 6–0 shutout 
of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Yankee Stadium. In his next start, he threw 
eight shutout innings against the Toronto Blue Jays, in which he got an 
outstanding 18 ground ball outs. Wang started the first game of the Division 
Series against the Detroit Tigers. Wang earned the win as the Yankees beat 
Detroit 8–4. Overall in 2006, Wang limited batters to a .211 batting average 
while games were tied, and a .205 batting average in games that were late 
and close. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays batted just .159 against him, losing 
three out of four games to the Yankees that Wang pitched. Wang was effective 
despite the lowest strikeout rate in the majors (3.14 strikeouts per nine 
innings and 76 strikeouts overall),[5] thanks in part to his allowing the 
fewest home runs per nine innings (0.5).[5] Wang also led the league in 
ground ball percentage (62.8%)[6] and obtained 2.84 groundouts for every 
fly ball out. At the end of the season, Wang finished second to Johan Santana 
in voting for the Cy Young Award. Wang collected 15 second-place votes, 
and 51 points. He also received a ninth-place vote, good for two points, 
in the AL MVP balloting, won by Justin Morneau. In MLB.com's This Year 
in Baseball Awards, he was chosen as the top starter in 2006 season with 
more than 47% of the fan vote.[7] Wang began the 2007 season on the disabled 
list, having injured his right hamstring during spring training. He returned 
on April 24 against Tampa Bay.[8] On May 5, 2007, Wang pitched 7 1⁄3 perfect 
innings before giving up a home run to Ben Broussard of the Seattle Mariners, 
falling five outs short of a perfect game.[9] On June 17, 2007, Wang had 
a superb outing versus the New York Mets, in which he threw 113 pitches 
through 8 and 2/3 innings for 10 strikeouts (a career high) and just 6 
hits. On August 30, Wang took a no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox into 
the seventh inning before giving up a single to Mike Lowell. Rookies Joba 
Chamberlain and Edwar Ramírez finished the two-hitter, and the Yankees 
beat the Red Sox 5–0. In 2007 Wang was 2nd in the AL in wins (19), 3rd 
for the second straight year in win-loss percentage (.731), 9th in wild 
pitches (9), and 10th in hit batsmen (8). He had a perfect 1.000 fielding 
percentage. He also had the lowest HR/9 innings pitched ratio in the AL 
(0.41), was 3rd in GB% (58.5%) and GB/FB (2.51), and had the 5th-lowest 
strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (4.70).[10] Despite his regular season 
performance, Wang faltered in the 2007 postseason. In the American League 
Division Series against the Cleveland Indians, Wang started two games, 
earning the loss in both appearances. He pitched a combined 5 and 2/3 innings, 
giving up 12 earned runs, for a postseason ERA of 19.06. The Yankees lost 
the ALDS in four games. The beginning of the 2008 season saw Wang at the 
top of the Yankees rotation and the ace with veterans Mike Mussina and 
Andy Pettitte. In the final Yankee Stadium season opener against the Toronto 
Blue Jays, Wang pitched 7.0 innings, allowing only 2 runs and picking up 
his first win of the season. In his first start against the Boston Red 
Sox in 2008, he pitched a one-run, two-hit complete game.[11] On April 
22, 2008, Wang recorded a win against the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular 
Field. The victory, in Wang's 85th career start, made him the fastest Major 
Leaguer to record 50 wins as a starter since Dwight Gooden, who won his 
50th game in his 82nd start on June 29, 1986, at Chicago for the New York 
Mets. Wang also became the quickest Yankee to 50 wins since Ron Guidry, 
who accomplished this in his 82nd start.[12] Wang finished April with a 
perfect 5–0 record, leading the American League along with Joe Saunders. 
On May 2, Wang became the first six-game winner in the American League 
with a win over the Seattle Mariners with just one earned run over six 
innings. On May 8, Cliff Lee of the Cleveland Indians beat Wang 3–0, handing 
Wang his first loss of the season. During this loss, Wang allowed three 
runs and five hits in seven innings. On June 10, after going six starts 
with two losses and four no decisions since May 2, Wang defeated the Oakland 
Athletics 3–1 to end the longest victory drought of his career. Through 
2008, Wang had the third highest winning percentage of all starting pitchers 
over the last three years (46–15, .754).[13] On June 15, Wang was taken 
out of an interleague game versus the Houston Astros due to a right foot 
injury he sustained while running the bases, something he was not used 
to doing, since pitchers do not bat in the American League. Wang was diagnosed 
with a torn Lisfranc ligament of the right foot and a partial tear of the 
peroneus longus of the right foot. Despite not requiring surgery, he was 
on crutches and wearing a protective boot. The cast was removed on July 
29, but the extensive rehabilitation process prevented Wang from pitching 
for the remainder of the season. Yankees' part-owner Hank Steinbrenner 
showed frustration with pitchers having to bat in the National League and 
suggested that the League "join the modern age".[14] On December 22, 2008, 
Wang and the New York Yankees avoided salary arbitration when they agreed 
to a $5 million, one-year contract. Wang made $4 million in the 2008 season 
after losing in salary arbitration. He had asked for $4.6 million.[15] 
On April 3, 2009, Wang became the first Yankees' starting and the first 
game winning pitcher of the new Yankee Stadium in the stadium opener exhibition 
game against Chicago Cubs. His regular season began with an extraordinarily 
bad performance. In his first start of the regular season, Wang gave up 
7 earned runs and 9 hits in 3.2 innings against the Baltimore Orioles.[16] 
That was followed by a one-inning appearance against the Tampa Bay Rays 
when he surrendered 8 earned runs in just one inning.[17] In his third 
start, against the Cleveland Indians in New York on April 18, Wang was 
credited for eight more earned runs in 1.1 innings; Cleveland won the game 
22–4.[18] After his first 3 appearances, Wang was 0–3 with a whopping 34.50 
ERA. There was speculation that the right foot injury Wang sustained during 
the 2008 season caused him to compensate with the rest of his pitching 
motion, leading to his 2009 struggles. Following the April 18 game manager 
Joe Girardi said, "We have some time. We have a day off, I think Thursday, 
and we're going to have to decide what's best for Chien-Ming Wang and the 
team."[19] On April 22, General Manager Brian Cashman, at a Q&A at Southern 
Connecticut State University, confirmed Wang's release point was 5 inches 
higher than the same time the previous season.[20] After being removed 
from the rotation and sent down to Tampa to work out mechanical issues, 
Wang was diagnosed with weakness in the muscles of both hips and placed 
on the disabled list. He was activated from the disabled list on May 22, 
2009, and on his first day on the active roster, he was brought in from 
the bullpen. After two more relief appearances, Wang went back to the rotation, 
but he struggled once again in his first and second starts back.[21] On 
June 28, Wang earned his first win of the season, also his first since 
June 15, 2008, giving up two runs over 5.1 innings against the New York 
Mets.[22][23] Wang was placed on the disabled list on July 15, 2009 due 
to shoulder soreness. He was then eliminated for the remainder of the season 
after undergoing shoulder surgery on July 30, 2009. After the Yankees won 
the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, Wang participated 
in the championship parade through the Canyon of Heroes, but acknowledged 
it "would have been more fun" if he had been healthy.[24] On December 12, 
2009, the Yankees made the choice not to re-sign him, making him a free 
agent.[25] On February 19, 2010, the Washington Nationals announced they 
had signed Wang as a free agent to a $2 million deal (plus up to $3 million 
in incentives).[26] In June, it was thought that Wang would return to the 
majors in late July or early August.[27] However, Wang's rehabilitation 
had been inconsistent, and there was no timetable for his return to the 
majors.[28] In September, the Nationals acknowledged that Wang would not 
pitch in the majors at all during the season, but instead was preparing 
for the instructional leagues in the fall.[29] Wang was non-tendered after 
the 2010 season.[30] On December 16, 2010, Wang re-signed with the Nationals 
to a one-year, $1 million contract with $4 million worth of potential performance 
incentives.[31] After continuing his injury rehabilitation, he began a 
formal rehab assignment on June 27 with the Nationals' Class A farm team, 
the Hagerstown Suns,[32] pitching three innings, allowing two earned runs 
while striking out three and walking none. Although his velocity topped 
out at around 90 mph, it mostly sat between 86 and 88 mph.[33] In his second 
start, on July 2 with the high-A Potomac Nationals, Wang pitched 4 shutout 
innings, and allowed 2 walks while striking out 2. 63% of his 38 pitches 
were strikes while his velocity hit 91 mph in his final inning of work.[34] 
Following a July 24 start for the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs, Wang made his 
Nationals debut on July 29.[35] Wang ended the season with 11 starts, recorded 
4–3 with a 4.04 ERA. He also made his first hit and first RBI in the majors 
in his final start of the season, Sep 24 against the Atlanta Braves. On 
October 30, 2011, Wang was granted free agency. Five days later on November 
4, Wang re-signed with the Nationals to a one-year, $4 million contract.[36] 
On March 15, 2012, Wang sustained an injury to his left hamstring, placing 
him on the DL.[37] On May 25, Wang pitched in the majors for the first 
time since going on the disabled list. He went 3 innings in his first win 
that season. He then replaced Ross Detwiler as the starting pitcher. In 
just 4 starts, Wang went 1-3 with an ERA of 6.10 and 11 strikeouts. On 
March 22, 2013 Wang signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees.[38] 
According to his agents and Taiwan's EETV, his minors contract is worth 
US$35,000 per month, but could worth up to $2.5 million per year, with 
an extra $2.2 million in bonuses. However, if he did not secure a major 
league contract by the end of April, he had the option to revert to free-agent 
status. Wang opted out of his contract on June 7, 2013.[39] Wang signed 
a one-year, $500,000 deal with the Toronto Blue Jays on June 9, 2013. He 
was added to the Blue Jays' roster on June 11, making his first pitching 
appearance as a starter against the Chicago White Sox. Toronto Blue Jays 
General Manager Alex Anthopoulos said that they guaranteed Wang one start, 
and would decide on further appearances based on the result of his first 
start.[40] Wang earned his first win as a Blue Jay in a game against the 
Texas Rangers on June 16, pitching 7 shutout innings. The win gave the 
Blue Jays their first 4-game sweep in the 2013 season, and the first 4-game 
sweep of the Rangers in Arlington in Blue Jays franchise history.[41] From 
June 11, the date Wang was added to their roster, to June 23, the Blue 
Jays went on an 11-game winning streak. Wang started three games during 
the streak, pitching at least 6 innings in each and compiling an ERA of 
2.18.[42] Wang followed up his successful streak by starting two games 
in which he was unable to make it out of the second inning. On June 27, 
Wang pitched 1 2⁄3 innings against the Boston Red Sox and surrendered 6 
hits and 7 earned runs. On July 2, he also pitched only 1 2⁄3 innings and 
gave up 8 hits and 6 earned runs to the Detroit Tigers. After the Tigers 
game, Blue Jays manager John Gibbons announced that Wang had been designated 
for assignment.[43] Wang was reported to be willing to accept an assignment 
to Triple-A Buffalo[44] and was outrighted to Buffalo on July 5.[45] Wang 
was added to the Blue Jays roster again on August 24, and designated for 
assignment on August 26. After clearing waivers, he was again outrighted 
to the Buffalo Bisons.[46] He became a free agent on October 1. On December 
19, 2013, Wang signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring 
training with the Cincinnati Reds.[47] He began the 2014 season with the 
Louisville Bats of the International League, but opted out of his deal 
on July 13.[48] Wang signed a minor league contract with the White Sox 
on July 17,[49] and pitched for the Charlotte Knights of the International 
League. During the 2014–15 offseason, Wang signed a minor league contract 
with the Atlanta Braves.[50] The Braves assigned Wang to the Gwinnett Braves 
of the International League. In 10 starts and one relief appearance, Wang 
had a 2-6 record with an ERA of 6.10, while surrendering the most hits 
in Triple-A up to the month of June. He was released on June 19.[51] Wang 
signed with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the Atlantic League of 
Professional Baseball, and independent baseball league, on June 24.[52] 
He made three starts for the Blue Crabs, winning all three and pitching 
to a 2.49 ERA. On July 12, 2015, Wang signed a minor league contract with 
the Seattle Mariners.[53] They assigned him to the Tacoma Rainiers of the 
Triple-A Pacific Coast League.[54] On January 7, 2016, Wang signed a minor 
league contract with the Kansas City Royals.[55] After a strong spring 
training, he made the Royals' opening day roster for the 2016 season as 
a relief pitcher.[56] On April 9, 2016, Wang threw a scoreless 9th inning 
in a 7-0 victory against the Minnesota Twins. This was his first major 
league game since August 25, 2013.[57] He was designated for assignment 
on September 17, 2016.[58] During his prime, Wang was a finesse pitcher 
with a power pitcher's velocity. In this period, he primarily relied on 
his power sinker along with the occasional four-seam fastball, slider, 
changeup, and splitter.[59] His sinker, which was responsible for his elevation 
to ace status before his foot injury, had very impressive lateral movement 
and was thrown at greater than average velocity, sitting in the 91–94 mph 
range. Before his first shoulder injury, he also had a curveball until 
he was encouraged to opt for a sinker instead. By 2016, after a long recovery 
process, Wang's sinker had returned to the 89-93 mph range, with a top 
speed of 95 mph.[60][61] His strikeout pitch is an average slider that 
closely resembles the fastball coming out of his hand, thus getting batters 
to swing ahead of the pitch. Wang also throws a split-finger fastball, 
though he only uses the pitch sparsely when in need of a strikeout or double 
play. Wang's pitching style is characterized by efficiency, command of 
the strike zone, few walks, few home runs allowed but also records very 
few strikeouts. Wang works quickly and uses his ground-ball inducing sinker 
to produce many double plays. This efficiency often allows Wang to maintain 
a low pitch count deep into games. In Taiwan and the minor leagues, Wang 
threw a more conventional assortment of pitches, including a four-seam 
fastball, a changeup, and far more splitters. The sinker, which has become 
Wang's signature pitch, was developed during his minor league career with 
advice from Neil Allen, his Triple-A pitching coach, and his Triple-A catcher, 
Sal Fasano.[62] Prior to the 2008 season, Wang relied on his sinking fastball 
about 90% of the time. However, after occasional bad outings, especially 
during the 2007 ALDS, Wang has worked to fully incorporate a slider and 
changeup into his repertoire. Through his first three starts of 2008, Wang 
used his slider roughly 20% of the time and his changeup around 8%.[63] 
In a 2006 The New York Times interview, Wang revealed that he is the biological 
child of the man he formerly thought was his uncle.[63] Due to the media 
frenzy created in Taiwan over this, he briefly refused to give interviews 
to Taiwanese media.[64] Wang has also been taught basic English. He has 
resided in Fort Lee, New Jersey[62] and Edgewater, New Jersey.[65] On April 
23, 2012, Wang admitted to having an extramarital affair while he was recovering 
from a shoulder injury in 2009.[66] In the summer of 2011, Wang's biological 
maternal grandfather, a man surnamed Huang, 82, committed suicide in a 
park in Tainan, Taiwan by hanging himself with a piece of electrical cord, 
according to a news report in the Taipei Times.[67] Wang often visited 
this maternal grandfather when he returned to Taiwan from time to time. 
Wang is married to Chia-Ling Wu.[62] The couple has two sons, J.J.,[68] 
born 2009,[69] and Wellington, born 2013.[70] Template:Taiwan roster 2013
