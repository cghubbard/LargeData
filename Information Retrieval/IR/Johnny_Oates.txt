As player As Manager Johnny Lane Oates (January 21, 1946 – December 24, 
2004) was an American professional baseball player, coach, and manager.[1] 
He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Baltimore Orioles, 
Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York 
Yankees from 1970 to 1981.[1] During his playing career, Oates was a light-hitting 
player who was valued for his defensive skills and played most of his career 
as a reserve player.[2] It was as a major league manager that Oates experienced 
his greatest success, leading the Texas Rangers to three American League 
Western Division titles.[2] Born in Sylva, North Carolina, Oates graduated 
from Prince George High School in Prince George, Virginia, before going 
on to Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.[1] He was selected by the Baltimore 
Orioles as their first round pick in the 1967 Major League Baseball Secondary 
Draft.[3] He began his professional baseball career with the Bluefield 
Orioles and then the Miami Marlins in 1967 at the age of 21.[4] After two 
seasons with Miami, Oates moved up to the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs in 1969 
where he hit for a .288 batting average in 66 games.[4] He continued his 
climb up the minor league ladder in 1970, playing for the Triple-A Rochester 
Red Wings before making his major league debut with the Baltimore Orioles 
at the age of 24 on September 17, 1970.[1][4] Oates was not on the post-season 
roster for The Orioles that won the 1970 World Series.[5] Oates returned 
to the minor leagues in 1971, playing another season with Rochester where 
he posted a .277 batting average along with a respectable .364 on-base 
percentage.[4] Oates was brought back up to the Orioles for the 1972 season, 
where he caught the majority of the Orioles games.[6] His defensive skills 
became apparent as he led American League catchers with a .995 fielding 
percentage.[7] On November 30, 1972, he was traded along with Pat Dobson, 
Roric Harrison and Davey Johnson to the Atlanta Braves for Taylor Duncan 
and Earl Williams.[8] Oates spent two seasons with the Braves, platooning 
alongside Paul Casanova and then Vic Correll, before being traded to the 
Philadelphia Phillies in May 1975.[1] Oates had been designated to platoon 
alongside catcher Bob Boone in the 1976 season however, in the season-opening 
game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he cracked his collar bone in a collision 
at home plate with Dave Parker and missed almost half the season.[9] "That 
play changed my career", he said afterwards.[9] He returned to help the 
Phillies win the 1976 National League Eastern Division pennant.[10] Oates 
had one plate appearance as a pinch hitter in the 1976 National League 
Championship Series as the Phillies lost to the eventual world champion 
Cincinnati Reds.[11] After the season, he was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers on December 20, 1976.[8] With the Dodgers, Oates worked as a second-string 
catcher behind Steve Yeager and, would once again reach the post-season 
as, the Dodgers clinched the 1977 National League Western Division title.[12] 
The Dodgers went on to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1977 National 
League Championship Series before eventually losing to the New York Yankees 
in the 1977 World Series.[12] In 1978, Oates appeared in only 40 games 
as the Dodgers repeated as Western Division champions and, once again defeated 
the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1978 National League Championship Series.[1][13] 
The 1978 World Series was also a repeat of the previous year as, the Dodgers 
once again lost to the Yankees in a six-game series.[13] Oates' playing 
time decreased further in 1979 as he appeared in only 26 games before being 
released at the end of the season.[1] He became a free agent and signed 
a contract to play for the New York Yankees on April 4, 1980.[8] Oates 
served as a back up to Rick Cerone during the 1980 season before playing 
in his final game on May 24, 1981 at the age of 35.[1] Oates began managing 
in baseball in 1982 when he guided the New York Yankees' Double-A Nashville 
Sounds to win the Southern League title.[14] From 1984 to 1987, he worked 
as a coach for the Chicago Cubs and was credited with developing Jody Davis 
into a Gold Glove Award winning catcher.[15] He rejoined the Orioles organization 
at their Rochester AAA affiliate in 1988.[14] The following year, he was 
promoted to the majors where he worked as first base coach under Frank 
Robinson, and in 1991, after Robinson started 13–24, Oates was promoted 
to the manager of the Orioles.[16] In his first full season with the team, 
Oates led the Orioles to an 89–73 record and then to an 85–77 record in 
1993, which helped him to win The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award.[17][18] 
However, following the strike-shortened 1994 season, Oates was dismissed 
by new owner Peter Angelos.[19] He finished his Orioles managerial career 
with a record of 291 wins and 270 losses.[14] Despite being let go by the 
Orioles, Oates was quickly hired by the Texas Rangers, who had just fired 
their previous manager, Kevin Kennedy. Oates proceeded to lead the Rangers 
to their first playoff appearance in team history during the 1996 season.[17] 
Despite the team's poor ERA (the team averaged 4.65 collectively), the 
Rangers' batting lineup was incredibly potent, featuring Iván Rodríguez, 
Will Clark, Mark McLemore, Dean Palmer, Rusty Greer, Juan González, and 
Mickey Tettleton; the team finished 90–72. Oates won the 1996 American 
League Manager of the Year Award that year, sharing honors with the Yankees' 
Joe Torre.[17][18] Oates continued to lead the Rangers for several more 
seasons, leading them to American League West titles in 1998 and 1999.[17] 
However, following a fourth-place finish in 2000 and beginning the 2001 
season with an 11–17 record, Oates resigned as manager and third base coach 
Jerry Narron replaced him.[20] Many fans, however, blamed Rangers management 
for the team's woes, saying that team management placed unreasonable expectations 
on Oates, especially after spending $252 million on free agent shortstop 
Alex Rodriguez. He finished his Rangers managerial career with a record 
of 506 wins and 476 losses.[14] In an eleven-year major league career, 
Oates played in 593 games, accumulating 410 hits in 1,637 at bats for a 
.250 career batting average along with 14 home runs, 126 runs batted in 
and a .309 on-base percentage.[1] A good defensive player, he ended his 
career with a .987 fielding percentage.[1] Oates was considering returning 
to managing when he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor, glioblastoma 
multiforme. Doctors gave Oates only about a year to live, but he survived 
for over three years—enough time to attend his daughter's wedding, his 
grandchild's birth, and his induction into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame 
at The Ballpark in Arlington.[21] During the ceremony at The Ballpark, 
he was given a standing ovation as Oates, weakened by the cancer and its 
treatment, required the help of his wife Gloria and a cane to walk. During 
his address to the crowd, he said he hoped it would be his friend, then-Rangers 
manager Buck Showalter, who would finally lead the team to a World Series 
victory. This never happened as Showalter was fired after the 2006 season, 
but Showalter's successor, Ron Washington guided the team to its first 
World Series appearance four years later. Oates was inducted into the Virginia 
Tech Sports Hall of Fame in 1983 and, in 2003, he was inducted into the 
Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.[22][23] Oates succumbed to the tumor at age 
58 at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center in Richmond on Christmas 
Eve 2004.[2] His uniform number 26 was retired by the Rangers on August 
5, 2005.[24] It is only the second number retired by the Rangers, following 
the 34 of Nolan Ryan. During the 2005 season, a commemorative patch was 
worn on all Ranger uniforms and a sign was hung on the outfield wall in 
his honor.[25] Prior to Game 3 of the 2010 American League Division Series 
against the Tampa Bay Rays, his eight-year-old grandson, Johnny Oates II, 
threw out the ceremonial first pitch.[26] In 2010, Showalter would honor 
his friend Oates by choosing the number 26 as he took over management of 
the Baltimore Orioles. Oates was posthumously inducted into the Baltimore
