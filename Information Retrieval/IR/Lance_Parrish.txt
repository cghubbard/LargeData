Lance Michael Parrish, aka "Big Wheel" (born June 15, 1956), is an American 
former professional baseball player, and is currently the manager of the 
Erie SeaWolves. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the 
Detroit Tigers (1977–1986), Philadelphia Phillies (1987–1988), California 
Angels (1989–1992), Seattle Mariners (1992), Cleveland Indians (1993), 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1994), and the Toronto Blue Jays (1995).[1] He was 
regarded as one of the best catchers in the 1980s, for both his offensive 
and defensive play.[2] Parrish was offered a scholarship to play college 
football for UCLA, but turned it down to pursue a career in baseball. He 
was drafted as a third baseman by the Detroit Tigers in the first round 
of the 1974 Major League Baseball draft.[3] While playing for the Lakeland 
Tigers in the minor leagues, he was converted to a catcher.[2] Parrish 
reached the major leagues in 1977 on a part-time basis, and by 1979 he 
had replaced Milt May as the team's regular catcher. In 1979, he also played 
winter baseball in Puerto Rico with the Mayagüez Indians. Parrish hit for 
a .286 batting average along with 24 home runs and 82 runs batted in during 
the 1980 season to earn his first American League All-Star team berth, 
as well as winning his first Silver Slugger Award.[1] Early in his career 
with the Detroit, Parrish and manager Sparky Anderson clashed over the 
catcher's use of weights in his physical training. Anderson felt that bulking 
up too much would ruin a player's flexibility and hamper his effectiveness.[4] 
Parrish, an avid weight lifter, disagreed. He continued to lift weights 
and had one of the most muscular bodies in the game. Parrish's most productive 
offensive season was 1982 when he posted a .284 batting average with 32 
home runs and 87 runs batted in, winning another Silver Slugger Award in 
the process.[1] He followed that in 1983 with 27 home runs and 114 runs 
batted in, earning his third Silver Slugger Award, as well as winning his 
first Gold Glove Award.[1] Parrish was an integral member of the world 
championship-winning 1984 Detroit Tigers team. Batting as the clean-up 
hitter, he produced 33 home runs and 98 runs batted in, adding another 
Silver Slugger Award as well as a second Gold Glove Award to his credentials.[1] 
He also caught Jack Morris' no-hitter on April 7 of that season.[5] The 
Tigers led the American League Eastern Division season from start to finish, 
then defeated the Kansas City Royals in the 1984 American League Championship 
Series, before winning the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres.[6][7][8] 
After ten years with the Tigers, Parrish signed with the Philadelphia Phillies 
as a free agent before the 1987 season.[9] The Phillies made their slogan 
for the season "Lance us a Pennant." He quickly fell out of favor with 
the Philadelphia fans and media in his second season there as a result 
of poor offensive output, ranking near the bottom of full-time major league 
players in 1988 with a .215 batting average. Afterwards, he played three 
seasons and parts of a fourth with the California Angels before ending 
his career with short stints for the Mariners, Indians, Pirates and Blue 
Jays. Parrish was also with the Los Angeles Dodgers in spring training 
1993, but he failed to make the squad as rookie Mike Piazza's performance 
showed the club that Piazza was ready to be a starting major-league catcher. 
Parrish also signed to return to the Tigers in 1994, but his contract was 
purchased by the Pirates before he ever got back to the majors with Detroit. 
He signed with the Royals in 1995 but was traded to Toronto before he appeared 
in any major league games with Kansas City. He signed once again with Pittsburgh 
in 1996, but did not make the team. In a nineteen-year major league career, 
Parrish played in 1,988 games, accumulating 1,782 hits in 7,067 at bats 
for a .252 career batting average along with 324 home runs and 1,070 runs 
batted in.[1] Parrish was an eight-time All-Star (1980, 1982–86, 1988, 
1990), and he won three Gold Glove Awards (1983–85).[1][10] Parrish was 
a six-time winner of the Silver Slugger Award which is awarded annually 
to the best offensive player at each position.[11] In 1982, he established 
the American League record for home runs by a catcher (32), surpassing 
the previous mark set by Yogi Berra and Gus Triandos, then surpassed his 
own mark two years later with 33.[12] Parrish ranks sixth in Major League 
history in home runs as a catcher with 299,[13] 10th among catchers in 
total bases with 3,113, and 11th in runs batted in with 1,070.[14] He led 
American League catchers twice in baserunners caught stealing, once in 
assists and once in caught stealing percentage.[1] Parrish finished second 
in fielding percentage four times and ended his career with a .991 fielding 
percentage.[1] After retiring he became a roving catching instructor for 
the Kansas City Royals during the 1996 season. From 1997-98, he was a coach 
for the Los Angeles Dodgers Double-A team, the San Antonio Missions.[15] 
From 1999 to 2001 he was part of the Detroit Tigers major league coaching 
staff as a third-base coach, bullpen coach and bench coach. Parrish spent 
the 2002 season as a broadcaster, working as the color commentator for 
Tigers games on Detroit's WKBD station. The following season, he returned 
to the Tigers dugout when former teammate Alan Trammell became the manager 
of the Tigers. Parrish remained on Trammell's staff through the 2005 season 
when they were both dismissed. He became a minor league Manager with the 
Ogden Raptors, the Dodgers rookie level team, for the 2006 season. The 
team finished 37-39. On November 20, 2006 he was hired to manage the Great 
Lakes Loons in Single-A ball during their debut season.[15] His contract 
was not renewed following the season. On February 5, 2014, Parrish was 
hired as the new manager of the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers, 
the Erie SeaWolves.[16] Parrish has two sons in professional baseball. 
His oldest son, David Parrish, was selected in the first round of the 2000 
amateur draft by the New York Yankees, and is now playing in the Texas 
Rangers organization. He also has a daughter, Ashley Parrish Hunt, who
