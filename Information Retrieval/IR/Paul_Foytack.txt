Paul Eugene Foytack (born November 16, 1930) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher from 1953 to 1964. During his eleven-year career, he played with 
the Detroit Tigers and Los Angeles Angels, posting a record of 86-87 with 
a 4.14 ERA. He was a regular, and effective, starter for the Tigers for 
four solid years, 1956 through 1959, during which he was among the top 
ten pitchers in the American League in fewest hits allowed per nine innings 
three times, and also top ten in innings pitched (three times), strike-outs 
(three times), complete games (twice), and fewest walks per nine innings 
(once). In 1959, he led the American League in games started in with 37. 
His production dropped off in the 1960s, and on June 15, 1963 he was traded 
by the Detroit Tigers with Frank Kostro to the Los Angeles Angels for George 
Thomas and minor league player to be named later.[1] A month and a half 
later, on July 31, 1963, during the sixth inning of a game against the 
Cleveland Indians, Foytack became the first pitcher to give up home runs 
to four consecutive batters.[2] He was the only pitcher to achieve this 
feat until New York Yankees rookie pitcher Chase Wright gave up four consecutive 
home runs to the Boston Red Sox on April 22, 2007.[3] On May 15, 1964 he 
was released by the Los Angeles Angels, ending his major league career.[4]
