Harry Hunter Wendelstedt III (born June 22, 1971) is a baseball umpire 
who has worked in the National League in 1998–1999 and throughout both 
major leagues since 2000. His father Harry Hunter Wendelstedt, Jr. was 
an NL umpire from 1966 to 1998. Hunter Wendelstedt goes by his middle name 
to avoid confusion with his father. Wendelstedt has worked one All-Star 
Game (2011), one Wild Card Game (2015), four Division Series (2003, 2010, 
2013, 2014), two League Championship Series (2006, 2015), and one World 
Series (2014). He also officiated in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. As 
his career began just as his father was retiring, Hunter Wendelstedt wears 
the same number as his father did, 21. The Wendelstedts are the only father-son 
pair to have umpired a Major League game together, an event that occurred 
over several series in 1998.[1] On October 7, 2010, Wendelstedt ejected 
Minnesota Twins manager Ron Gardenhire from Game 2 of the American League 
Division Series after Gardenhire argued a pitch which appeared to be strike 
three to Lance Berkman. Wendelstedt ruled it a ball, and on the next pitch 
Berkman hit a double scoring a run and putting the Yankees up, 3–2 (they 
would ultimately win, 5–2). It was at least the fourth time Wendelstedt 
has ejected Gardenhire. In 2005, Gardenhire was suspended one game and 
fined after delivering a profanity-laced rant about Wendelstedt, and in 
2009, Wendelstedt suggested that Gardenhire should attend his umpiring 
school to "learn what a balk is," after ejecting Gardenhire for arguing 
a non-balk call.[2] This contentious history fueled questions about the 
appropriateness of Major League Baseball putting Wendelstedt on a post-season 
series involving Gardenhire, as there is precedent in baseball for avoiding 
such confrontations, most notably the American League removing umpire Ron 
Luciano from games involving the Baltimore Orioles due to a long history 
of bad blood between the umpire and Orioles manager Earl Weaver.[3] On 
August 22, 2011, Wendelstedt ejected Twins third baseman Danny Valencia 
for disputing balls and strikes. Gardenhire came out to argue and his ejection 
followed. Afterward, Gardenhire said that he and Wendelstedt had actually 
gotten along well. Gardenhire stated that what had happened was his fault, 
not Wendelstedt's.[4] On July 31, 2011, Wendelstedt ejected Los Angeles 
Angels starter Jered Weaver and Angels manager Mike Scioscia, after Weaver 
gave up a home run to Detroit Tigers hitter Carlos Guillén and subsequently 
threw a pitch over the head of Tigers catcher Alex Avila. On June 1, 2013, 
Wendelstedt ejected Baltimore Orioles starter Jason Hammel, after the latter 
had given up three straight home runs to the Detroit Tigers and subsequently 
hit center fielder Matt Tuiasosopo.[5] Ejected on a first-pitch inside 
slider, it was Hammel's first career ejection.[6] Hunter attended Loyola 
University of New Orleans for two years, where he is a member of Alpha 
Delta Gamma Fraternity. He administers the Wendelstedt Umpire School in 
Florida and is involved with the YMCA Ormond Beach and YMCA Edgewater Charity
