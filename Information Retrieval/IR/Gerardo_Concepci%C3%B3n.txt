Mexico. Major League Baseball declared him a free agent in January 2012.[1] 
He is working out at a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic for MLB

He made three appearances in 2016 with a 3.86 ERA. The Cubs eventually 
won the 2016 World Series, ending their 108-year drought. Concepción was 
not present during the playoffs, but was still on the 40-man roster at 
the time and won his first World Series title.[8] Concepción is 6 feet

the low 90s (miles per hour), and he also features a curveball and a change-up.
