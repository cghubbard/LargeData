The New York Yankees are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in The Bronx, New York City, New York. They play in the American League 
East division. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is 
played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, 
which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching 
staff that season,[1] though there are various strategic reasons why a 
team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day.[2] The Yankees have 
used 57 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 110 seasons. Since 
the franchise's beginning in 1901, the 58 starters have a combined Opening 
Day record of 57 wins, 36 losses, 1 tie (57–36–1), and 17 no decisions.[3][4] 
No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won 
or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game. Although in modern 
baseball, ties are rare due to extra innings, in 1910, New York's Opening 
Game against the Boston Red Sox was declared a tie due to darkness – at 
the time, Hilltop Park had lacked adequate lighting.[5] Whitey Ford, Ron 
Guidry, and Mel Stottlemyre hold the Yankees record for most Opening Day 
starts with seven.[3] The other pitchers with three or more Opening Day 
starts for New York are Lefty Gomez (6), Red Ruffing (5), Jack Chesbro 
(4), Roger Clemens (4), Bob Shawkey (4), Ray Caldwell (3), Jimmy Key (3), 
Vic Raschi (3), and most recently CC Sabathia (6).[3] Jimmy Key holds the 
Yankee record for best Opening Day record with a perfect 3–0.[3] On Opening 
Day, Yankee pitchers have a combined record of 35–12–1 when playing at 
home.[3] Of those games, pitchers have a 1–0 record at Oriole Park, a 3–1–1 
record at Hilltop Park, a 2–3 record from Polo Grounds, a 28–8 record at 
Yankee Stadium, and a 1–0 record at Shea Stadium. When on the road for 
Opening Day, Yankee pitchers have a combined record of 27–26. During the 
1901 and 1902 seasons, the franchise played in Baltimore as the "Baltimore 
Orioles". The franchise has Opening Day record of 1–1 as Baltimore. After 
their move to New York in 1903, the franchise was known as the New York 
Highlanders until 1912. As the Highlanders, they had a 6–3–1 Opening Day 
record.[3] For seasons in which New York would later win the World Series,
