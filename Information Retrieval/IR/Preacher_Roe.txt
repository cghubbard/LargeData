Elwin Charles Roe (February 26, 1916 – November 9, 2008), known as Preacher 
Roe, was a Major League Baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals (1938), 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1944–47), and Brooklyn Dodgers (1948–54). Roe was born 
on February 26, 1916, in Ash Flat, Arkansas and grew up in Viola, Arkansas. 
The nickname "Preacher" came at age 3 when an uncle asked his name and 
Roe responded "preacher" because of a minister who would take him on horse-and-buggy 
rides. Roe attended Harding College (now University).[1] At Harding, in 
a thirteen-inning game in 1937, Roe gained national attention by striking 
out twenty-six batters. In the summer of 1938, Roe was signed by Branch 
Rickey, then general manager for the St. Louis Cardinals. Roe pitched in 
one game for the team that season, giving up six hits, two walks and four 
runs in 2⅔ innings. He spent the next five seasons in the Cardinals' minor 
league system before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 
30, 1943 in exchange for pitcher Johnny Podgajny, outfielder Johnny Wyrostek 
and cash.[2] As a fastball pitcher with the Pirates, Roe had a record of 
13-11 with a 3.11 earned run average in 1944 and a 14-13 record with a 
2.87 ERA in 1945. His 148 strikeouts in the 1945 season led the National 
League and he was selected for (but did not play in) the 1945 All-Star 
Game.[2] While coaching high school basketball after the 1945 season, Roe 
fractured his skull in a fight with a referee.[1] His pitching suffered 
in the following seasons, with Roe's record falling to 3-8 and an ERA of 
5.14 in 1946 and deteriorated further in 1947, as he finished the season 
with a record of 4-15 and an ERA of 5.25.[2] Ralph Kiner, he said, stood 
in a hole in the outfield. He caught balls hit to his hole but otherwise 
did not field. One can get a great flavor of 'Ole Preach', as he was called, 
by reading Roger Kahn's book The Boys of Summer. Branch Rickey, the general 
manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, remembered Roe from Rickey's time in the 
Cardinals' management and engineered a trade.[1] On December 8, 1947, the 
Dodgers got Roe, and infielders Billy Cox and Gene Mauch in exchange for 
pitchers Hal Gregg and Vic Lombardi and outfielder Dixie Walker.[1][2] 
With his health improving and with the spitball now in his repertoire, 
Roe had much success with the Dodgers, including winning records in his 
first six seasons with the team.[1] Roe finished the 1948 season with a 
record of 12-8 and an ERA of 2.63.[2] Selected to play in the 1949 All-Star 
Game, Roe pitched in the ninth inning, retiring all three batters he faced.[3] 
He improved further in the 1949 season, finishing with a 15-6 record and 
a 2.79 ERA.[2] He pitched for the first time in the postseason in the 1949 
World Series, winning Game 2 with a six-hit complete game shutout against 
the New York Yankees that the Dodgers won 1-0, their only win in the five 
game series.[4] He posted an exceptional 22-3 won-loss record for the Dodgers 
in 1951, becoming only the fifth pitcher since 1916 to begin the season 
10-0.[5] Roe was an exceptional pitcher, but notorious as a poor hitter, 
finishing his career with a .110 batting average.[2] In 1953, he hit a 
home run at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, the only one of his career, causing 
fans to roar in surprise and delight. Dodger broadcaster Red Barber told 
his radio audience, "Well, old Number 28 has hit a home run, and we'll 
never hear the end of it, folks!" Preacher was still pitching in the majors 
at age 39, unusual at the time, and was the third-oldest player in the 
National League in the 1954 season, his last in the majors.[6] When asked 
to explain his longevity, he replied "Clean livin' and the spitball." He 
described his methodology in a 1955 article in Sports Illustrated, "The 
Outlawed Spitball Was My Money Pitch", published a year after he retired.[1][7] 
Roe's overall career statistics were hurt by the fact that he was away 
from baseball during World War II and that for two of the years he pitched 
for the Pirates they were among the worst teams in the National League. 
Contrasting the fielding of the Dodgers and the Pirates, he once said that 
a pitcher should pay to pitch for the Dodgers, whereas the Pirates' second 
baseman and shortstop were like goalposts with the ball bouncing between 
them. After being taken out of a game in the second inning, Roe commented 
that, "Sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you."[citation 
needed] Roe lived in West Plains, Missouri, where for many years he operated 
a small grocery store (now a florist shop) on the northeast corner of Broadway 
and Porter Wagoner Boulevard, and has a street named after him (Preacher 
Roe Boulevard), which included U.S. 160 north of the US 63 bypass until 
the city rerouted U.S. 160 and Route 17 after 2000. U.S. Route 160 still 
runs as Preacher Roe Boulevard south of U.S. 63. A community ball field 
in Salem, Fulton County, Arkansas, 18 miles from Roe's birthplace of Ash 
Flat, is known as Preacher Roe Park. The book Carl Erskine's Tales from 
the Dodgers Dugout: Extra Innings (2004) includes short stories from former 
Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. Roe is prominent in many of these stories.
