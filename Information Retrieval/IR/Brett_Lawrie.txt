Brett Russell Lawrie (born January 18, 1990) is a Canadian professional 
baseball second baseman and third baseman for the Chicago White Sox of 
Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Toronto Blue 
Jays and Oakland Athletics. While primarily a third baseman throughout 
his career, Lawrie began playing second base for the White Sox in 2016. 
While playing high school baseball for the Langley Blaze of the British 
Columbia Premier Baseball League, Lawrie was selected with the 16th overall 
pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft by the Milwaukee Brewers.[1][2] 
The selection of Lawrie was the fourth-highest a Canadian player has ever 
been drafted, behind only Jeff Francis, Adam Loewen, and Phillippe Aumont, 
as the highest a Canadian position player has ever been drafted.[3] Lawrie 
was a member of the Canadian Junior National Team at the 2008 World Junior 
Baseball Championship where he led the tournament with a .469 batting average, 
three home runs and 16 runs batted in (RBIs).[4] He was also selected to 
play for Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Lawrie represented Canada 
once again during the 2009 World Baseball Classic at the Rogers Centre 
in Toronto, Ontario.[5] His only appearance during Canada's brief run in 
the tournament came during a 6–5 loss to the United States where he pinch-ran 
for Joey Votto in the ninth inning. Lawrie was named to Canada's 2013 World 
Baseball Classic team, and took part in two pre-tournament games against 
the Milwaukee Brewers and the Cincinnati Reds. Lawrie exited the game against 
the Reds due to discomfort, and was later determined to have strained his 
ribs. He stayed with the team, but did not appear in the tournament due 
to this injury.[6] Although he was used primarily as a catcher for the 
Blaze, Lawrie transitioned to second base when he was assigned to the Wisconsin 
Timber Rattlers of the Midwest League to begin the 2009 season. He was 
selected to play for the World Team at the 2009 MLB All-Star Futures Game 
at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.[7][8] He was promoted to the Double-A Huntsville 
Stars in mid-August. On June 23, Lawrie was selected to the 2010 Futures 
Games, his second selection. Lawrie finished the 2010 season with a .285 
batting average, eight home runs, 63 RBIs, 90 runs, 16 triples and 30 stolen 
bases in 135 games with Huntsville. For his efforts he was named to the 
Southern League Post-Season All-Star team on September 1, 2010. Considered 
by many to be one of Milwaukee's top prospects, he was traded on December 
6, 2010 to the Toronto Blue Jays for starting pitcher Shaun Marcum. Despite 
already having switched positions from catcher to second base after the 
Brewers drafted him, the Blue Jays moved Lawrie to third base.[9] On May 
31, Lawrie was hit in the hand by a pitch and left the game with what was 
initially believed to be a broken hand. X-rays were negative and he was 
considered day-to-day, until it was later revealed by CAT scan that there 
was a non-displaced fracture, and he was expected to miss 2–3 weeks.[10][11] 
After a brief stint in Single-A Dunedin ending with a game where he was 
hit by a pitch twice, Lawrie was promoted back to Triple-A Las Vegas on 
July 18, 2011.[12] He was named the third baseman on Baseball America's 
2011 Minor League All Star team.[13] On August 4, 2011, Lawrie was called 
up to the Toronto Blue Jays. Travis Snider was optioned to Triple-A to 
make room for Lawrie.[14] He made his debut on August 5 against the Baltimore 
Orioles.[15] In his first career at-bat, he recorded his first career hit 
and RBI. He finished 2-for–4 with one RBI and a fielding error.[16] Two 
games later, he hit his first career home run, a solo shot off of starter 
Alfredo Simón. In his second game at home on August 10, Lawrie recorded 
his first career grand slam, off of Oakland reliever Craig Breslow. The 
grand slam was also his first hit at the Rogers Centre.[17] In the following 
series against the Los Angeles Angels, Lawrie recorded his first career 
triple and stolen base. On September 5, Lawrie hit his first career walk-off 
home run, a solo shot in the 11th inning off reliever Dan Wheeler to defeat 
the Boston Red Sox 1–0.[18] Lawrie's first season ended prematurely when, 
on September 21, he fractured the middle finger on his right hand while 
fielding during batting practice. He finished his first season with a batting 
average of .293, nine home runs, 26 runs scored, seven stolen bases and 
25 RBIs in 161 plate appearances.[19] On May 1, 2012, Lawrie hit a game-winning, 
walk-off solo home run in the bottom of the 9th inning to give the Blue 
Jays an 8–7 win against the Texas Rangers.[20] In a game against the Tampa 
Bay Rays on May 15, Lawrie was ejected from a game after objecting to being 
called out on two consecutive strikes by umpire Bill Miller. The two pitches 
in question were proven by replay[21] and through computerized strike zone 
analysis to not be in the strike zone.[22] After both pitches, Lawrie started 
down the baseline, only to hear the strike call. Upon the strikeout call, 
Lawrie turned and yelled, prompting Miller to eject him. Lawrie threw his 
helmet on the ground, which then bounced and made contact with Miller. 
Manager John Farrell was also ejected after arguing with Miller.[23] Lawrie 
was suspended for four games by Major League Baseball, and initially appealed 
the suspension but dropped the appeal on May 17.[24] After a 7–4 loss to 
the Boston Red Sox on June 2, Lawrie was present at the Toronto Eaton Centre 
when a shooting took place. Lawrie, who was unharmed, posted on Twitter 
about the incident and was credited by some news outlets with breaking 
the story.[25][26] Lawrie was awarded the Wilson fielding award for his 
defensive play at third base on November 4.[27] Lawrie began the season 
on the disabled list, and made his season debut on April 16 against the 
Chicago White Sox, going 0-3 with an RBI.[28] Lawrie was placed on the 
15-day disabled list on May 29 after spraining his ankle sliding into second 
base in a game on May 27.[29] General manager Alex Anthopoulos said on 
June 24 that Lawrie would begin a rehab assignment on June 26 with the 
Class A-Advanced Dunedin Blue Jays.[30] Lawrie started the June 26 game 
at third base for Dunedin. Lawrie continued his rehab with the Double-A 
New Hampshire Fisher Cats on July 6.[31] His rehab assignment was changed 
to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on July 9.[32] He played second base against 
the Syracuse Chiefs on July 9, and was recalled by the Blue Jays on July 
13 to play against Baltimore.[33] Lawrie started at second base for the 
first time in his major league career on July 13, and finished the game 
0–4.[34] After making 6 starts at second base, manager John Gibbons said 
in an interview with MLB Network Radio that Lawrie would play at third 
base exclusively for the rest of the season.[35] On August 10, Lawrie's 
career-high 11-game hitting streak ended. During the streak, he batted 
.400 with two home runs and six RBIs. In 107 games with Toronto in 2013, 
he hit .254 with 11 home runs, 46 RBIs and a .963 fielding percentage at 
third base. On February 13, 2014, Lawrie was announced as the cover athlete 
for the Canadian version of MLB 14: The Show. He replaces teammate Jose 
Bautista, who was the Canadian cover athlete for the previous two entries 
in the series.[36] Lawrie hit his second career grand slam on April 15, 
2014, in a 9–3 win over the Minnesota Twins.[37] After the emergence of 
Juan Francisco as a viable option for the Blue Jays, Lawrie began playing 
second base against right-handed starting pitchers. He tied his career-high 
in home runs on June 6, 2014, when he hit his 11th of the season in a 3–1 
win over the St. Louis Cardinals.[38] Lawrie would then set a new career-high 
on June 20, when he hit his 12th of the season to assist the Blue Jays 
in a 14–9 win, having been down 8–0 after the second inning. Two days later, 
he was hit on the right hand by a pitch from Johnny Cueto and was forced 
out of the game.[39] X-rays showed a fracture of his right index finger 
and he was placed on the 15-day disabled list.[40] On August 5, Lawrie 
was activated from the DL and started at third base that night. In the 
4th inning, he was removed from the game due to back tightness, and was 
placed back on the 15-day disabled list on August 7 with an oblique strain.[41] 
On September 2, Lawrie was moved to the 60-day disabled list, ending his 
2014 season.[42] He finished the year appearing in just 70 games, and batting 
.247 with 12 home runs and 38 RBIs.[43] On November 28, 2014, Lawrie was 
traded to the Oakland Athletics, along with Kendall Graveman, Sean Nolin, 
and Franklin Barreto, for Josh Donaldson.[44] After struggling early in 
the season, including a game on April 7 in which he struck out 4 times 
on 12 total pitches (earning him a golden sombrero), Lawrie hit his first 
home run as an Athletic on April 13.[45][46] In a game on June 5 between 
the Athletics and the Boston Red Sox at Boston's Fenway Park, a fan named 
Tonya Carpenter was injured when Lawrie's bat broke while swinging at a 
pitch. The barrel of the bat was thrown into the stands, hitting Carpenter 
in the head. According to the Boston Police Department, Carpenter lost 
an extensive amount of blood and suffered life-threatening head injuries, 
but another fan wrapped her head in his shirt tourniquet and she was quickly 
treated and taken by Fenway Park medical personnel to Boston's Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center.[47] Lawrie finished the 2015 season with a .260 
average, 16 home runs, and 60 RBIs in a career-high 149 games played.[48] 
On December 9, 2015, Lawrie was traded to the Chicago White Sox for minor 
league pitchers J. B. Wendelken and Zachary Erwin.[49] Lawrie became engaged 
to UCLA and United States women's national under-20 soccer team forward 
Sydney Leroux, a childhood friend against whom he played in youth baseball 
leagues in Metro Vancouver, in October 2010. They broke off the engagement 
in October 2011, during Leroux's senior year at UCLA and just before she 
received her first call-up to the United States women's national soccer 
team.[50] Lawrie became engaged to model Dana Long on June 29, 2015. Lawrie 
proposed on Long's birthday.[51] They got married seven months later, on 
Lawrie's birthday.[52] He is the brother of University of Washington and
