The 1987 America's Cup was the twenty-sixth challenge for the America's 
Cup and the first time for 132 years that it had not been defended by the 
New York Yacht Club. The American challenger Stars & Stripes 87, sailed 
by Dennis Conner, beat the Australian defender Kookaburra III, sailed by 
Iain Murray, four wins to nil in the best of seven series.[1] Conner thus 
became the first person both to unsuccessfully defend the America's Cup 
and then to win it back again. The series was held in Gage Roads off Fremantle, 
Western Australia during the Australian summer months between October 1986 
and February 1987. The Royal Perth Yacht Club was the defending club and 
the organiser of the defence series.[2] Yacht Club Costa Smeralda of Porto 
Cervo, Sardinia was appointed the challenger of record and hence the organiser 
of the challenger series.[3][4] This was the last time that 12-metre class 
yachts were used in the America's Cup. The 1983 America's Cup off Newport, 
Rhode Island was the most significant America's Cup regatta since the first 
event off the Isle of Wight. Alan Bond's Australia II pulled off a major 
upset by winning the series from Conner's Liberty to become the first successful 
challenger in 132 years. The New York Yacht Club had previously enjoyed 
the longest winning streak in international sporting history, having successfully 
defended the trophy over twenty challenges. Most previous challengers had 
been from the United Kingdom – notably by Scotsman Sir Thomas Lipton who 
had challenged five times between 1899 and 1930 in his 37 metres (121 ft) 
Shamrock sloops. Australia mounted its first challenge in 1962 with 12-metre 
class yachts when Sir Frank Packer and his Gretel were beaten 4–1. Packer 
made more challenges, with Dame Pattie and Gretel II.[5] Alan Bond mounted 
his first challenge in 1974 with Southern Cross, followed by Australia 
in 1977 and 1980 and ultimately had success with Australia II in 1983.[6] 
It was in this context that the 1987 America's Cup was seen as the best 
opportunity yet for a successful challenge, as the event was now outside 
the control of the NYYC and held in a location with strong but variable 
breezes, unlike the predictable and placid winds off Rhode Island. The 
regatta therefore attracted enormous additional interest over previous 
series. Following the 1983 win, there was speculation over the likely location 
of the defence, with three main candidates potentially under consideration.[5] 
In the late 1970s, Alan Bond had developed a marina and a large associated 
housing development north of Yanchep called "Yanchep Sun City" (now known 
as Two Rocks), about one hour's drive north of Perth. The marina was built 
with an expectation of success from earlier America's Cup challenges. The 
second candidate was the town of Mandurah, a coastal township a similar 
distance south of Perth. The last, and ultimately successful location considered 
was Fremantle as the required infrastructure at the other two locations 
were considered inadequate by the Royal Perth Yacht Club as defender. Also, 
the proximity to the major population centre of Perth and its international 
airport were seen as an important factor. For most of its life until 1985, 
Fremantle had been a port city with a population of less than 24,000.[7] 
Private investment and public infrastructure redevelopment commenced on 
a massive scale in anticipation of a large influx of visitors arriving 
to watch the event. This expectation proved over-ambitious, but 13 challenging 
syndicates from six countries and four defence syndicates arrived with 
a fleet of 29 12-metre yachts. In 1985, an "Office of America's Cup Defence" 
was set up to coordinate the state government's involvement in the staging 
of the event.[8] The government embarked on a number of projects such as 
Hillarys Boat Harbour and extensions to the Perth to Fremantle railway 
line.[8] A new marina, Challenger Harbour[9][10] was built alongside the 
existing Fishing Boat Harbour, and the state government received funding 
from each defence syndicate, a total of $2.3 million, to offset costs associated 
with the harbour works of $8 million.,[11]:p176[12] Vehicle registration 
plate slogans in Western Australia changed from The Wildflower State and 
the State of Excitement to W.A. Home of the America's Cup[11]:p171 In 1985 
and 1986 changes in liquor laws and trading hours regulations were made 
to expand services for visitors.[citation needed]The Executive Director 
of the Royal Perth Yacht Club's America's Cup Defence Committee was Noel 
Robins, a skipper and crew member in previous America's Cups, and later 
a Paralympic gold medallist.[13] A Festival of Sport was conducted in late 
1986 and early 1987 which included a cricket Test[14] and One Day International 
tournament, athletics, hockey, basketball, squash, golf, racing, trotting, 
cycling, football, baseball, lawn bowls, karate and kick-boxing competitions.[8] 
A heavy-weight boxing title fight[citation needed] and a World Sprint Car 
Championship were held in early January.[15] The cruise ship Achille Lauro 
was chartered by a private group for the duration of the series, to act 
as a viewing platform and accommodation for 1,400 visitors. It also housed 
the international jury which oversaw the races.[8] Other cruise ships which 
visited the port for the races included Island Princess and several Royal 
Viking vessels.[16] In January and February 1986, a series styled as the 
'12-metre world championship' was staged off Fremantle as a precursor to 
the America's Cup event scheduled for January 1987.[17] A dozen syndicates 
competed, mainly as a shakedown series to determine their relative competitiveness 
and to train crews for the anticipated heavy conditions. Strong winds throughout 
most of the regatta resulted in four 90 ft (27 m) masts, a dozen booms 
and numerous sails being destroyed. Five crewmen were washed overboard 
during the races. Gary Jobson, of the 'Heart of America' syndicate declared 
that the Fremantle waters were "unsuitable for racing."[17] Australia III, 
the heavy-weather Ben Lexcen designed successor to Australia II won the 
series comfortably. The New Zealand challenge boat KZ 5, a fibreglass-hull 
Bruce Farr design, came in second, with the New York Yacht Club entrant 
America II third. The Fremantle Fairway Buoy 31°57′9.0″S 115°38′48.12″E﻿ 
/ ﻿31.952500°S 115.6467000°E﻿ / -31.952500; 115.6467000[18] was renamed 
the "America's Cup Buoy" for the duration of the event and marked one end 
of the start and finish lines for each America's Cup race.[8] The buoy 
is a permanent navigation marker used for shipping in and out of Fremantle 
harbour and is located 8 nautical miles (15 km) west-north-west of the 
harbour, in Gage Roads[19] or 5.5 nautical miles (10.2 km) due west of 
City Beach. Races in the challenge and defence elimination trials used 
other markers in the general vicinity. The orientation of the course was 
set such that the starting line was square to the prevailing wind 20 minutes 
before each race start. Races were 24.3 nautical miles (45.0 km) long, 
consisting of beats into the wind in legs 1, 3, 6 and 8; downwind runs 
on legs 2 and 7; and reaches on legs 4 and 5.[20] Thirteen syndicates from 
six countries (Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and 
the United States) competed, bringing 25 boats for the right to challenge. 
Stars & Stripes 87 was the winner of the 1987 Louis Vuitton Cup and earned 
the right to sail for the America's Cup. Four syndicates competed for the 
right to represent the Royal Perth Yacht Club as the defender of the America's 
Cup. After a series of round robin races, a Defender Finals contest was 
sailed between Alan Bond's Australia IV and Kookaburra III of Kevin Parry's 
Taskforce 87 syndicate, with Kookaburra III sweeping the finals five races 
to nil to win the Defender selection process. In doing so she placed Alan 
Bond's syndicate on the outside of an America's Cup regatta for the first 
time in thirteen years.[21] The best-of-seven final series were scheduled 
to be held between 31 January and 15 February 1987.[1] There being a four-nil 
result, the final race was held on 4 February. (Held in Battye Library)
