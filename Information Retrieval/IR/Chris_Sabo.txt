Christopher Andrew "Chris" Sabo (born January 19, 1962) is a former third 
baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the Cincinnati Reds (1988–93, 
1996), Baltimore Orioles (1994), Chicago White Sox (1995) and St. Louis 
Cardinals (1995). At 6'0" and 180 lb (82 kg), he batted and threw right-handed. 
Sabo was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of a plumber and a waitress. 
The Sabos lived in Rosedale Park, three blocks from the 1968 Championship 
Detroit Tiger Willie Horton. Sabo attended Detroit Catholic Central High 
School. In high school, he excelled as both a hockey goalie and a golfer 
in addition to being one of the area's best baseball players, twice earning 
all-state honors. Sabo played hockey on two national championship 17-and-under 
teams[1] and, before enrolling at Michigan, also played hockey as a goaltender 
in one game in the Ontario Junior Hockey League for the Niagara Falls Flyers 
in the 1979–80 season. As a senior, he was torn between pursuing a hockey 
career or a baseball career but ultimately chose baseball and a scholarship 
to the University of Michigan despite being drafted in the 1980 Major League 
Baseball Draft by the Montreal Expos.[2] A third baseman, Sabo was a key 
component on a strong Michigan team that finished third in the College 
World Series in 1983, a season in which Sabo was joined as a starting infielder 
by future Reds teammate and Baseball Hall of Famer Barry Larkin.[2] That 
season, Sabo earned first-team All-American honors from The Sporting News 
and Baseball America.[3] Sabo was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the 
second round of the 1983 Major League Baseball Draft.[4] Sabo spent five 
seasons in the Reds' minor league system, during which he never put up 
impressive numbers,[5] although in two of those seasons he was named the 
Most Valuable Player of his team. By 1988, he was given little chance of 
making the big-league team out of spring training, but his ability combined 
with his grit and hustle was reminiscent of, and endeared him to, Reds 
manager Pete Rose[2] And with Buddy Bell starting the season on the disabled 
list and the Reds needing a third baseman, Sabo stepped in and was the 
opening day starter. Batting eighth, Sabo collected his first hit, stolen 
base and run scored in the seventh inning and made a run-saving play on 
defense in the Reds' 5–4, 12-inning win over the St. Louis Cardinals.[6] 
Sabo continued to make the most of the opportunity throughout the season. 
On April 18, he hit his first career home run, a solo shot off San Francisco 
Giants pitcher Mike Krukow. For the season, he posted a .271 average with 
11 home runs and 44 RBI, pounded out 40 doubles and also stole 46 bases. 
He won the National League Rookie of the Year Award and quickly became 
a fan favorite with his hustle and determination punctuated by his flat-top 
haircut and ever-present wraparound protective eyeglasses commonly known 
as Rec Specs. That season, Sabo was featured on the cover of Baseball America 
and The Sporting News and was the subject of a feature article in Sports 
Illustrated.[2] After a forgettable 1989 campaign in which he was limited 
to 82 games, Sabo returned to help lead the Reds to a World Series Championship 
as he batted .270 with 25 home runs and 71 RBI. Sabo also had an outstanding 
World Series, batting an astounding .583 with nine hits in 16 at bats, 
including two home runs and five RBI plus two walks.[4] At the Reds' Fountain 
Square victory celebration, he famously grabbed the microphone and bellowed 
to the cheering crowd, "We've got the rings, we've got the money, we've 
got everything!"[2] He had his most productive season in 1991, posting 
career-highs in batting average (.301), home runs (26), RBI (88), hits 
(175) and games played (153). Sabo made the National League All-Star team 
in 1988, 1990 and 1991. After injuries limited his play in 1992, his production 
dropped off drastically. Sabo never again hit above .260 nor would have 
more than 10 steals in a season. Baltimore signed him in 1994 where he 
endured another injury-plagued season and then split 1995 between Chicago 
and St. Louis. His final season was in Cincinnati in 1996. His homecoming 
did not go as well as he had hoped. In July, Sabo shattered his bat which 
was filled with cork. As a result of the incident, Sabo received a seven-game 
suspension. Sabo maintains that he never corked a bat in his life, claiming 
that the bat in question belonged to another player (whom he would not 
name). The credibility of Sabo's defense was enhanced by the fact that 
he broke his original bat while hitting a foul ball during the at-bat in 
question coupled with the fact that Sabo decided not to replace the corked 
bat (which had been provided by a batboy) even though the bat was thought 
by the game's play-by-play crew to have cracked after Sabo hit another 
foul ball during the penultimate pitch of the at-bat. Sabo further argued 
that his performance that season (three home runs in 52 games) was hardly 
"an endorsement of the cork industry." In a nine-season career, Sabo hit 
.268 with 116 home runs and 426 RBI in 911 games.[4] Also an excellent 
fielder, Sabo led National League third basemen in fielding percentage 
in 1988 and 1990 and was second in 1991.[4] Reds manager Pete Rose gave 
Sabo the nickname "Spuds" during his rookie season in 1988, citing a resemblance 
to a bull terrier character in Bud Light commercials named Spuds MacKenzie. 
Sabo lives in Sarasota, Florida with his wife, Susan, whom he married in 
1989, and their three daughters Annie, Brooke, and Olivia. Sabo is currently 
a baseball coach at IMG Academy in neighboring Bradenton.[7] He has served 
as a coach in the Reds' minor league system for the Advanced Rookie Billings 
Mustangs and Class A Dayton Dragons.[8] He has also served as an assistant 
coach for the University of Cincinnati.[9] In 2009, he began attending 
the Northern Kentucky University law school.[10] Sabo was inducted in the 
Cincinnati Reds Hall Of Fame, along with Big Red Machine reliever Pedro 
Borbón and 19th-century pitcher Tony Mullane, on July 17, 2010. The Reds 
gave away Chris Sabo bobblehead dolls to fans in attendance that evening.[11] 
He is an avid golfer, plays in celebrity golf tournaments and is a member 
of Kenwood Country Club in Cincinnati.[7] He is good enough to have qualified 
for several major United States Golf Association tournaments.[8] He is
