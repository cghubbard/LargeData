BMO Field is an outdoor stadium located at Exhibition Place in Toronto, 
Ontario, Canada. Constructed on the site of the former Exhibition Stadium 
and first opened in 2007, it is owned by the City of Toronto, and managed 
by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. The stadium's naming rights are held 
by the Bank of Montreal, which is commonly branded as "BMO" (/ˈbiːmoʊ/). 
BMO Field was originally constructed as a soccer-specific stadium, serving 
as the home field of Toronto FC—the first Canadian expansion team of Major 
League Soccer, and hosting matches during the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup 
and 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. The venue has also hosted rugby union, 
having hosted matches of Canada's national rugby union team, and rugby 
sevens during the 2015 Pan-American Games. From 2014 to 2016, the stadium 
underwent a series of major renovations, which added an upper deck to the 
east grandstand, a roof over the seating areas and lengthened the field 
to make it suitable for hosting Canadian football. The latter allowed for 
the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League to move to BMO Field 
beginning with the 2016 CFL season. BMO Field is the fifth stadium to be 
built at its exact location at Exhibition Place. The most recent was Exhibition 
Stadium, which lost its primary tenants, the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian 
Football League and Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball, with the 
opening in 1989 of the SkyDome. Exhibition Stadium was demolished in 1999. 
The Argonauts submitted a proposal to the city to construct a new 22,000 
seat stadium at Exhibition Place in March 2003.[8] That July the Canadian 
Soccer Association (CSA) announced separate plans for a 30,000 seat $82 
million stadium at the site, to host the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup which 
it had bid on.[9] The governments of Canada and Ontario agreed to provide 
a combined C$35 million in funding for a new stadium if the CSA was successful 
in acquiring the rights to the tournament.[10] At the time, Maple Leaf 
Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), owners of the National Hockey League's Toronto 
Maple Leafs and the National Basketball Association's Toronto Raptors, 
was also looking for a stadium to host a new Major League Soccer (MLS) 
team they were considering launching. The league considered soccer-specific 
stadiums to be necessary for an expansion franchise to be granted, due 
to the improved atmosphere and control of revenue streams. The Argonauts, 
CSA and MLSE agreed to partner to build a new 25,000-seat, $80 million 
Varsity Stadium at the University of Toronto.[10][11][12] Aside from the 
committed government funding, $15 million was to come from the UofT, which 
would own the stadium, and a $30 million loan would be taken out by the 
University with the annual $2.1 million financing charges paid by the Argos.[10] 
However, MLSE backed out of the stadium due to a lack of financial return, 
and the deal ultimately fell through in 2004 when the University's new 
President withdrew his support after its cost rose over $100 million.[11][12][13][14] 
Later that year, the Argos and CSA announced plans to build a 25,000-seat, 
$70 million stadium at York University, which would contribute the land 
and $15 million, with the Argos adding $20 million to the government funding.[11][15] 
MLSE was not involved in this project.[16] However, the Argos pulled out 
of the stadium after signing a new 15-year lease at Rogers Centre with 
significantly reduced rent.[17] In 2005, the stadium site was moved back 
to Exhibition Place, on the location of the demolished Exhibition Stadium 
and then-existing Sports Hall of Fame building, in a partnership between 
MLSE and the CSA. With a total costs of $62.9 million (all figures are 
in Canadian dollars) to build the stadium[18] ($72.8 million including 
the land), financial contributions came from multiple sources.[19] The 
Canadian Federal Government contributed $27 million, the Government of 
Ontario added an additional $8 million, and the City of Toronto paid $9.8 
million and contributed the land for the project (valued at $10 million),[20][21] 
while retaining ownership of the stadium.[21] MLSE contributed $8 million 
towards construction costs and was responsible for any cost overruns.[21] 
In return, they got the management rights for the stadium.[22] MLSE committed 
to purchase a MLS soccer team to play in the stadium. The remaining funds 
came from MLSE, which paid $10 million for the naming rights of the stadium 
for the duration of the 20-year management agreement, which they later 
resold to the Bank of Montreal (BMO) for $27 million over the first 10 
years.[21][23][24] The proposal approved by the City of Toronto was for 
a stadium that was "capable of a conversion to a football format."[8][25] 
The Argonauts attempted to join the project at the last minute, but MLSE, 
citing budget and time limitations, constructed the stadium such that it 
could not fit a CFL field without demolition and reconstruction of the 
endzone stands.[25][26][27] The field of play dimensions are 74 yards (68 m) 
wide × 115 yards (105 m) long,[28] meeting FIFA standards. The stadium 
features seats which are entirely red with the exception of a design on 
each of the main stands. On the east side, the design is a large maple 
leaf while on the lower west stand the design spells out "TORONTO", and 
has a portion of the Toronto FC logo. The south stand has "BMO" spelled 
out.[citation needed] On May 11, 2006, Major League Soccer announced that 
Toronto FC would join the league as its 13th (and first Canada-based) team 
in 2007, with BMO Field serving as its home. BMO Field originally used 
FieldTurf rather than a natural grass pitch, which attracted some criticism.[29][30] 
A temporary grass turf was laid in August 2009 for a friendly against Real 
Madrid.[31] Prior to the 2010 season Toronto City Council approved MLSE's 
request to convert the stadium to natural grass.[20][32] MLSE paid the 
$3.5 million for the conversion, and promised to cover all additional costs 
to maintain the surface.[33][34] A variety of Kentucky Bluegrass was installed 
in the spring of 2010, along with a state of the art drainage system and 
heating system in the field. MLSE spent a further $2 million to expand 
the north end by 1,400 seats for the 2010 season.[35][36] As part of the 
deal to convert the field to natural grass, MLSE spent $1.2 million adding 
a winter bubble to Lamport Stadium and $800,000 building a new artificial 
turf field to replace the community use hours lost at BMO.[37] In November 
2009, it became public that the Toronto Argonauts were in discussions with 
the City of Toronto over the possibility of moving from the Rogers Centre 
to BMO Field, potentially as early as the 2010 CFL season.[38] The CFL 
agreed to study the feasibility of the Argos playing at BMO Field, which 
was built too short to fit a full length Canadian football field despite 
the requirement that the stadium be convertible to CFL configuration in 
the original stadium agreement.[39] According to Tom Anselmi, former executive 
vice-president and chief operating officer with MLSE, without significant 
renovations BMO Field could only fit a 100-yard field with 15-yard endzones 
or a 110-yard field with 10-yard endzones, which is 20 yards shorter than 
the standard 110-yard field and 20-yard endzones.[40] On December 16, 2009, 
the Argonauts officially abandoned the idea, after the CFL concluded that 
the venue was not suitable for Canadian football in its current state.[41] 
Anselmi indicated in 2009 that a second level could be added to the east 
side stands and extra rows added to the south side stands, which would 
add an additional 8,400 seats, for approximately $15 million.[42] Following 
Tim Leiweke taking over as president of MLSE in June 2013, he began discussing 
the company's plans for a major renovation of the stadium.[43][44][45] 
In early January 2014, Leiweke said that next six months would be spent 
consulting with experts to determine the feasibility of the project.[46] 
As the stadium is owned by the City of Toronto, their consent is required 
for any modifications.[47] The City insisted that any renovations included 
making the playing surface longer to fit a CFL field so it could house 
the Argonauts, who had to vacate their current home Rogers Centre by the 
end of 2017 season.[48][49][50][51] Mark Grimes, Chairman of Exhibition 
Place's Board, began negotiating with MLSE on the project and said "I think 
I have Mr. Leiweke's ear in that I am a big CFL fan and that we need to 
get the Argos on stable ground."[52] Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly said that 
"the Argos have got to play there" and that "I think there is a very good 
chance that they will."[53] On February 25 Grimes said that a deal was 
"getting close" and could be reached "in the next couple weeks".[54] Preliminary 
plans were released to the public on March 5.[55][56] In addition to making 
the field compatible for CFL games, the upgrades, which were originally 
budgeted for $115–120 million, added a new upper deck on the east side, 
raising capacity from 21,566 seats to 30,000 for soccer, with 26,500 seats 
in CFL configuration, and is temporarily expandable with additional endzone 
seating to 40,000 for big events[48][49][50][51][55][57] such as the rugby 
sevens at the 2015 Pan-Am games, an NHL outdoor game, Grey Cup, MLS Cup, 
possible 2028 Summer Olympics or later or a successful 2026 FIFA World 
Cup by Canada.[45][49][50][51][55][58] The plans called for $30 million 
retractable endzone seating in the south and a retractable terrace in the 
north end to ensure that fans aren't farther from the playing surface in 
soccer configuration due to the longer CFL field,[48][51][55][59] and a 
roof over most permanent seating areas.[48][49][55][57] Leiweke promised 
that soccer playing surface will remain natural grass.[46] A reinforced 
hybrid playing surface such as Desso GrassMaster, in which artificial fibres 
are embedded in the turf to allow for the grass roots to intertwine with 
them to strengthen the pitch, was originally under consideration,[46][51][55][56] 
but concerns that this would complicate repairs to the pitch led MLSE to 
decide against it.[60][61][62] A $1 million subsurface heating system and 
a $1 million artificial lighting system were installed to encourage grass 
growth,[1][59][60][63] and MLSE secured an exemption to use pesticides 
on the field.[60] Portions of the CFL endzones are artificial turf.[64][65] 
Removable paint is used for lining the field to allow for the football 
lines to be removed prior to soccer games. As well, the field has two football 
goalpost configurations so that the same grass isn't relined every game.[60] 
Under a two-phase construction process, the field was lengthened and the 
capacity of the stadium increased for $77 million by May 1, 2015, with 
the roof added by May 1, 2016 for $43 million.[47][49][51][57][57] Leiweke 
in the past had said that even without an expansion the stadium needed 
$30 million in repairs, and that the original agreement called for the 
city and MLSE to split that bill equally.[66] Instead, MLSE looked for 
$10 million in public funding from each of the municipal, provincial, and 
federal governments to top up their $90 million contribution, plus any 
cost overruns, for the expansion.[49][50][53][57][67] MLSE argued that 
the new stadium would result in $8 million in economic benefits, including 
taxes, accruing to the province annually,[68] and $18 million in taxes 
on the construction project.[69] The company has agreed to pay a fixed 
annual rental fee of $865,000 to the City for the upgraded stadium, rather 
than the variable revenue sharing model under the present agreement which 
returned an average of $397,000 to the city over the previous five years, 
to help ensure that the city recoups its investment.[49][57] The new arrangement 
guaranteed the city $25.4 million, and with the projected $6 million in 
parking revenues the $31 million in revenue over the term of the lease 
would be $19 million more than under the former agreement.[70] As manager 
of the stadium, MLSE gets any profit turned by the stadium, and is responsible 
for any losses.[57] MLSE's management and naming rights agreement for the 
stadium, which was set to expire in 2027, were extended by 10 years under 
the proposal.[49][57] The agreement requires MLSE to reach a "long-term 
use (i.e. 20 years)" lease with the Argos for usage of the stadium starting 
in 2015.[49][50][57] The proposed renovations were unanimously approved 
by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place on March 7,[20][48][49][51][71] 
and the City of Toronto's Executive Committee gave their consent on March 
19.[47][71][72] The full City Council approved the deal on April 3,[71][73][74] 
and the agreement is planned to be finalized by June 15.[57] The Provincial 
Minister of Tourism and Culture Michael Chan said that MLSE has submitted 
a funding request that that "we are looking at it", while the Federal Infrastructure 
Minister Denis Lebel's spokesperson said that "the federal government has 
no program to fund professional sports facilities".[75] A spokesperson 
for Lebel would later say "our government will not fund the BMO Field as 
long as it is used by a professional sports team".[69] However, according 
to Leiweke, the federal funding "is not going to the stadium, their money 
is going to host big events."[76] In another interview he said "the feds 
are giving us the resources to (temporarily) expand to 40,000 for our Grey 
Cup bids and Winter Classic bids".[77] By late May 2014, MLSE had not reached 
a financing agreement with either the federal or provincial governments 
to fill the $20 million funding gap. The fall of the government of Ontario, 
with an election scheduled for June 12, prevented them from approving their 
share of the funding.[78] With deadlines approaching to start construction 
to ensure that the stadium was ready for the 2015 Pan-Am games, MLSE decided 
to move forward with the first phase of the renovation without first securing 
further funding commitments from the government.[69][76] The revised plan 
proposed a $65 million addition of an upper east deck in the first phase, 
and $40 addition of a canopy in the second phase.[79] The lengthening of 
the field to make it CFL compatible and the infrastructure to allow for 
a temporary increase in seating capacity was postponed to a third phase 
costing $20–$25 million to be completed by May 1, 2017, pending a commitment 
by the governments or other parties to fund it and a usage agreement being 
reached with the Argos.[69][76][80][81][82] MLSE agreed to pay the city 
an additional $160,000 annually for as long as phase 3 remains uncompleted 
to compensate the city for the envisioned parking revenues at Argos games.[80] 
Leiweke pledged that if both levels of government funded the project "we're 
obligated to renovate the stadium for the CFL",[76][83] but if the necessary 
conditions for phase three are not met by 15 May 2017, MLSE can pull out.[80] 
The new proposal was approved by city council on June 12.[84] It is thought 
that if the Liberals win the provincial election they will fund the project.[69] 
The official groundbreaking took place on September 23.[79][85][86] In 
April 2015, it was reported that the renovations were $10 million over 
budget due to pressure to meet deadlines, which MLSE is obligated to fund.[87] 
On May 20, 2015, it was announced that two of the three ownership partners 
of MLSE, Bell Canada and Larry Tanenbaum's Kilmer Group, had acquired an 
ownership stake in the Argos, with the deal to close at the end of the 
year, and would move the team to BMO Field for the 2016 season.[88] The 
new ownership group for the Argos committed $10 million to the conversion 
costs for BMO Field, with MLSE matching this to fill the $20 million funding 
gap.[64][89] Part of the agreement would see two Grey Cups played at the 
newly renovated BMO Field.[90][91] The renovations for the Argonauts added 
a state-of-the-art 10,000 sq ft (930 m2) dressing room. In February 2016 
it was announced that BMO had extended its naming rights sponsorship agreement 
for an additional ten years.[92] The renovation ended up costing $150 million 
in total.[64] At the reopening ceremony it was announced that the province 
of Ontario had contributed $10 million to the financing.[93] After the 
renovations, the field for configuration for football has only 18 yard 
end zones (instead of the standard 20 yards) due to space constraints and 
the necessity of a safety zone for players beyond the field of play.[94][95] 
Toronto FC played their first game at BMO Field on April 28, 2007. The 
grand opening celebration took place on May 12, 2007.[96] The only music 
concert thus far at BMO Field was performed by the progressive rock group 
Genesis on September 7, 2007. The 2008 MLS All-Star Game was held at BMO 
Field on July 24, 2008 versus West Ham United of the English Premier League. 
In 2009, the Toronto Nationals of Major League Lacrosse began playing their 
home games at BMO Field. The team moved to Lamport Stadium for 2010 and 
to Hamilton in 2011 before folding in 2013. On July 18, 2009, BMO Field 
had its first alcohol suspension, due to an incident that occurred on May 
21, 2008, regarding alcohol consumption by a minor.[97] BMO Field became 
the first venue outside of the United States to host the MLS Cup in 2010, 
featuring the Colorado Rapids defeating FC Dallas 2–1. On July 24, 2014, 
BMO Field hosted the opening match of the 2014 International Champions 
Cup between Olympiacos and A.C. Milan; Olympiacos won the match 3–0.[98] 
The first MLS playoff game held at BMO Field saw Toronto FC defeat the 
Philadelphia Union 3–1 on October 26, 2016.[99] BMO Field has become a 
home venue for Canada's national rugby union team. Since 2011, the team 
has played at the venue regularly.[100][101][102] With the Argonauts moving 
to the renovated BMO Field beginning with the 2016 season, the team was 
awarded on October 1, 2015 the right to host the 104th Grey Cup at the 
stadium on November 27, 2016.[103] On June 11, 2016, the Argonauts played 
their first game at the stadium, a preseason (exhibition) game; the Argos 
defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 25–16.[104] On June 23, the Argos played 
their first regular season game at BMO Field; the Ti-Cats defeated the 
Argos 42–20.[105] On March 9, 2016, the National Hockey League announced 
that BMO Field would hold an outdoor game known as the NHL Centennial Classic 
on January 1, 2017, between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Detroit Red Wings. 
The game is a rematch of the 2014 Winter Classic, which will celebrate 
the Maple Leafs' centennial season.[106] The first goal at BMO Field was 
scored by Eddie Johnson for Kansas City Wizards in a 1–0 Major League Soccer 
win over home side Toronto FC in the stadium opener on April 28, 2007. 
The first ever Toronto FC goal at the stadium was Danny Dichio's first-half 
strike against Chicago Fire on May 12, 2007 (also his club's first ever 
MLS goal). The first goal at BMO Field scored by a Canadian came at the 
official opening on May 11, 2007, in a U-20 friendly between Canada and 
Argentina. David Edgar scored a penalty in a 2–1 defeat for Canada, just 
four minutes after Gómez had scored the first ever international goal at 
the stadium. Costa Rica's Víctor Núñez scored the first ever senior international 
goal in a 1–1 friendly draw with hosts Canada on September 12, 2007, shortly 
before Dwayne De Rosario scored Canada's first senior goal at the stadium. 
The first Toronto FC goal scored by a Canadian at BMO Field was in a June 
25, 2007 friendly against Aston Villa of the English Premier League. Andrea 
Lombardo scored an equalizer at BMO Field's south end to make it 2–2 before 
Aston Villa ran out 4–2 winners. The first league goal at BMO Field scored 
by a Canadian came when Miguel Cañizalez scored for Toronto FC in the second 
minute of their 2–1 defeat to Columbus Crew on September 22, 2007, snapping 
an 824-minute MLS goalless streak. The first-ever Toronto FC MLS playoff 
goal was scored at BMO Field in the 15th minute by Sebastian Giovinco on 
October 26, 2016 in front of 21,759 fans. In the same game, the first-ever 
Toronto FC playoff goal scored by a Canadian was by Jonathan Osorio in 
the 48th minute; the final score was 3–1 over the Philadelphia Union.[99] 
In lacrosse, the first MLL goal at BMO Field was scored by Merrick Thomson 
of the Toronto Nationals in a 15–11 win in their home opener on May 22, 
2009. In Canadian football, the first CFL points scored at BMO Field was 
a Toronto Argonauts completed touchdown pass caught by Vidal Hazelton, 
thrown from Logan Kilgore, in a June 11, 2016 exhibition Argos win; final 
score 25–16.[104] The first CFL regular season points scored at the stadium 
was a conceded safety touch of 2 points by Canadian Argos kicker/punter 
Lirim Hajrullahu in a 42–20 loss on June 23.[105] The first regular season 
points scored by the Argos at BMO Field was a successful field goal kicked 
by Hajrullahu in the same game.[105] On July 25, the Argonauts won their 
first regular season game at their new home, defeating the Montreal Alouettes 
30–17.[107] BMO Field hosted the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, the first major 
tournament held at the stadium. The stadium saw the Canadian Under-20 squad 
once. The stadium also saw six knockout stage games including the Final; 
which was won by Argentina. Due to FIFA sponsorship regulations, the venue 
was referred to as the National Soccer Stadium during the event. BMO Field 
hosted the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. Canada played in Toronto for 
the first two match days, with Korea DPR, Finland, and Ghana in their group. 
National Soccer Stadium also hosted a quarterfinal match on August 16. 
During the 2015 Pan American Games, BMO Field hosted the rugby sevens competition 
(soccer events took place at Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton). Due to PASO 
sponsorship regulations, the venue was referred to as Exhibition Stadium 
during the event.[108] The largest attendance overall at the stadium was 
on May 10, 2015 for a Toronto FC game when they hosted Houston Dynamo in 
front of 30,226 fans in their home opener.[109] The largest crowd for rugby 
at BMO stadium and in Canada occurred when the Canada national rugby union 
team hosted the New Zealand Māori All Blacks before 22,566 people on 3
