Leonard Anthony Harris (born October 28, 1964) is a former Major League 
Baseball utility infielder. Listed at 5' 10", 195 lb., Harris batted left-handed 
and threw right-handed. He is best known for holding the record for the 
most pinch hits in a Major League career, with 212. Harris was the Cincinnati 
Reds' fifth-round pick in the 1983 amateur draft. He made his major league 
debut with the Reds in 1988. He batted .372 in 16 games with Cincinnati 
in 1988. He played 61 games with the Reds in 1989; his batting average 
that year with the Reds was .223, and he was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers along with Kal Daniels for Tim Leary and Mariano Duncan. Harris 
continued playing with the Dodgers through the 1993 season, playing in 
at least 107 games each season. 1993 was also the year when he started 
doing more pinch hitting. He never hit more than 3 home runs in any given 
year until 1996, but while with the Dodgers he did have several good seasons 
at the plate; he batted .304 in 1990 and .287 in 1991. He became a free 
agent after the 1993 season, at which point he re-signed with Cincinnati, 
where he continued to play until he was traded to the New York Mets in 
1998. Harris pitched once for the Reds, on June 1, 1998. It was the first 
time a Reds position player had been used as a pitcher in ten years.[1] 
In 1998, he batted .295 with the Reds in 57 games, but after joining the 
Mets, he batted only .232 and did not re-sign with the Mets the following 
year, instead opting to sign with the Colorado Rockies. He hit well[clarification 
needed] with Colorado, but was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for minor 
leaguer Belvani Martinez after 91 games there. He went 11-for-29 in 19 
games with the Diamondbacks; he remained in Arizona for the first two months 
of the 2000 season, when he was traded back to the Mets for pitcher Bill 
Pulsipher. He finished the 2000 season with the Mets and also spent the 
2001 season there. In 2001, he broke MLB's career pinch hits record, previously 
held by Manny Mota (150). Note, the 150-mark has also been surpassed by 
Mark Sweeney (175). The 2002 season proved successful for Harris. He batted 
.305 in 122 games with the Milwaukee Brewers at the age of 37, showing 
that he would still be able to play for several more years. He started 
the 2003 season with the Chicago Cubs, with whom he played 75 games before 
being released and signing with the Florida Marlins. He was on the Marlins' 
championship team in the 2003 World Series. Although he batted just .193 
in the 2003 campaign, he re-signed for one year with the Marlins in 2004. 
Although he had said that he would retire after the 2004 season, he re-signed 
for another year with the Marlins in 2005 and said that he would return 
for the 2006 season. However, the Marlins released him during spring training 
in 2006. After his release, he became the infield coordinator for the Washington 
Nationals, and eventually, the hitting coach. He was fired by the Nationals 
on September 28, 2008, after less than two seasons on the job.[2] On October 
24, 2008, Harris became the Los Angeles Dodgers minor league hitting instructor 
at Camelback Ranch, the team's Spring Training facility.[3] In 2011 he 
was the hitting coach for the Great Lakes Loons. After serving as a coach 
for the Gulf Coast League Marlins, he became the assistant hitting coach 
of the Miami Marlins and later became the third base coach of the Miami
