Kenneth "Kenny" Lofton (born May 31, 1967) is a former Major League Baseball 
(MLB) outfielder. Lofton was a six-time All-Star (1994–1999), four-time 
Gold Glove Award winner (1993–1996), and at retirement, was ranked fifteenth 
among all-time stolen base leaders with 622.[1][2] During his career, he 
played for the Houston Astros, Cleveland Indians (three different times), 
Atlanta Braves, Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, 
and Texas Rangers. Lofton attended the University of Arizona on a basketball 
scholarship. The Wildcats made it to the Final Four in 1988. He did not 
join the school's baseball team until his junior year. Lofton made 11 postseason 
appearances, including World Series appearances in 1995 and 2002 with the 
Indians and Giants, respectively. From 2001 to 2007, Lofton did not spend 
more than one consecutive season with a team. For his career, the Indians 
were the only team he played with for longer than one season and the only 
franchise he played for more than once. Lofton played 9 1⁄2 seasons with 
the Indians, helping the organization win six division titles. In 2010, 
he was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame. During his professional 
baseball career, Lofton's single-season stolen base count led the MLB on 
three occasions and twice the American League (AL). In 1994 he led the 
American League in hits. Lofton broke Rickey Henderson's record of 33 career 
post-season stolen bases during the 2007 post-season. Of his base running, 
Frank White said, "Lofton has out-thought a lot of major-league players" 
and later, "a smart, complete baseball player."[3] Lofton was raised by 
his widowed grandmother, Rosie Persons, in "the slums" of East Chicago, 
Indiana.[4]:p.98 His mother, Annie, had Lofton while she was in high school 
and he weighed just three pounds (1.4 kg) at birth. His mother moved to 
Alabama after she graduated and lost contact with Lofton. Of his father, 
Lofton said, "We, as a family, don't even talk about it."[4]:p.98 Persons 
had glaucoma and because of her failing eyesight was unemployed. She refused 
to go on welfare but did collect Social Security as a result from her husband's 
death in 1960 (of bronchial pneumonia). When Lofton made the majors he 
built a new home in East Chicago for his grandmother and other family members. 
Lofton attended Washington High School in East Chicago and played on the 
school's baseball team as a pitcher and center fielder. He was an all-state 
basketball player.[4] Lofton accepted a basketball scholarship to play 
at the University of Arizona. Wildcats head coach Lute Olson said of Lofton, 
"He's quick and a great leaper."[5] At one point Lofton performed a 360-degree 
slam dunk for his unsuspecting teammates. For the Wildcats, Lofton was 
the backup point guard (to Craig McMillan and Steve Kerr) on a team that 
made it to the Final Four of the 1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball 
Tournament. He was the starting point guard the following year when the 
Wildcats made it to the Sweet Sixteen. Lofton is one of only two men to 
play in a college basketball Final Four (1988) and a MLB World Series. 
(The other is fellow East Chicago Washington High School alumnus Tim Stoddard.)[6][7]:p.93 
He left as the Wildcats' leader in career steals (a record eventually broken).[8] 
"In strength and agility drills, he just killed it. He's a guy who could 
have played pro football or basketball or baseball", said former Wildcats 
teammate Bruce Fraser.[5] Lofton decided to try out for the Wildcats baseball 
team during his junior year. He played in just five baseball games and 
recorded only one official at-bat while at Arizona but his speed and potential 
were recognized by baseball scouts, including the Houston Astros' Clark 
Crist. The Astros later selected Lofton in the 17th round of the 1988 MLB 
draft.[4]:p.98 He played minor league baseball during the summer while 
completing his basketball eligibility at Arizona. The Astros organization 
asked Lofton to play minor league baseball in the Florida Instructional 
League but Lofton declined, citing a promise he had made to his grandmother 
to obtain his degree.[4]:p.100 Lofton earned a degree in studio production 
at the University of Arizona while playing minor league baseball for the 
Houston Astros. He credits his post-MLB success, as owner of FilmPool, 
Inc., to that education. Lofton is also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.[9] 
Lofton struggled early in his professional baseball career in the Astros 
farm system. He hit .214 in 48 games as an outfielder for the Auburn Astros 
of the New York–Penn League but recorded 26 stolen bases in 30 attempts.[10] 
Lofton returned to Auburn in 1989 and hit .263 with 26 steals in 34 games.[10] 
He then hit .329 with 14 steals in 22 games for the Asheville Tourists 
in the South Atlantic League. As his college basketball career came to 
an end, Lofton was able to concentrate on baseball and he improved rapidly, 
finishing second in the league in hitting at .331 while adding 62 steals 
for the Osceola Astros in the Florida State League. He also drew 61 walks 
and improved defensively (.974 fielding percentage) and played in 123 games 
with Osceola.[10] After spring training in 1991, he went directly to the 
Triple-A Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). His 168 hits led 
the league.[11] He hit .308 with 30 steals and 52 walks for Tucson with 
19 doubles and a team-high 17 triples.[10][12] The Toros won the PCL championship 
and Lofton made the league's All-Star team.[13] On September 14, 1991, 
the Astros promoted Lofton to the majors. In his major league debut with 
the Houston Astros on September 14, 1991, he went 3-for-4 with a double 
and scored three runs against the Cincinnati Reds.[14] He hit .203 in 20 
games for the remainder of the Astros' regular season.[15] With Steve Finley 
already entrenched as Houston's centerfielder, and aged 26 years, Lofton 
was traded during the off-season to the Cleveland Indians for catcher Eddie 
Taubensee and right-handed pitcher Willie Blair.[15] "I know they gave 
up on me and now I'm glad they did. One man's trash is another man's treasure", 
Lofton said of the Astros trading him.[4]:p.100 During his first season 
with Cleveland, in 1992, Lofton hit .285. His 66 stolen bases broke the 
all-time record for an American League rookie and was the most by a Major 
League rookie since Vince Coleman stole 110 in 1985. His season's stolen 
base count, which led the AL, also broke a franchise record (previously 
set by Miguel Diloné in 1980).[15][16][17] Indians first base coach Dave 
Nelson helped Lofton refine his baserunning technique and helped learn 
how to be successful with bunting.[4]:p.100 Lofton finished second (to 
the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Listach) in AL Rookie of the Year balloting. 
After one season with Cleveland, Lofton agreed to a four-year, $6.3 million 
contract.[18] The following season, Lofton broke his own Cleveland single-season 
stolen bases' record, recording 70 (which led the MLB).[15][16] Lofton 
was selected to his first career All-Star Game during the 1994 season. 
His development and impact in the league led Brewers manager Phil Garner 
to say, "I remember how raw he was, and I've never seen anybody develop 
into that type of player that fast." Garner, who saw Lofton play in the 
minors, added, "He went from a guy who could hardly get the ball past the 
infield to a guy who could hit the ball consistently. He always had good 
speed, but got lousy jumps and didn't run the bases well. He has turned 
into a dominant player."[4]:p.98 The regular season was stopped abruptly 
with the MLB strike, which also led to the cancellation of the World Series. 
For the season, Lofton again led the AL with 60 stolen bases. His 160 hits 
on the season were highest in the AL and his .349 batting average would 
be a career-best. He finished fourth in Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) 
voting.[15] When the strike began in August, the Indians were in second 
place by one game in the AL Central to the Chicago White Sox.[19] Indians 
general manager John Hart said of Lofton, "What a representative for our 
team and our city. He has the opportunity to be a George Brett-type player 
here, someone who is synonymous with a franchise."[4]:p.100 Lofton would 
join fellow Indians Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, and Jim Thome to form 
"the backbone of some Indians teams that were as dominant as any."[20] 
In 1995, Lofton was one of six Indians' starters who batted .300 or higher 
(.310).[21] He also had an MLB-best 13 triples. His 54 stolen bases led 
the AL for the third consecutive season.[15] The Indians faced the Seattle 
Mariners in the 1995 ALCS. In the eighth inning of Game Six, Lofton had 
an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed 
ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians 
won the game 4–0.[22] It was described by The New York Times as "the run 
that demoralized the Mariners."[23] Fifteen years after Lofton's crossing 
of home plate, the Plain Dealer recalled: "Of all the electrifying moments 
on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player 
any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995."[24] As 
a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, 
Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland for the 
first time since the 1954 season.[23] "I'm glad for the city of Cleveland 
to be able to experience this, because they haven't experience this for 
a long time. The city of Cleveland has grown a lot, and it's improving, 
and we tried to do this for the city", Lofton said.[23] The Indians lost 
the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular 
season with a major league-best 100–44 record in the strike-shortened year. 
Lofton finished with a .200 batting average and six stolen bases in his 
first World Series appearance.[25] In 2010, a few years into his retirement, 
Lofton stated he felt it was the toughest post-season loss of his 11 career 
playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike 
zones for Braves pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.[24] The following 
season in 1996, the Indians again had the best record in baseball (99–62) 
and Lofton's stolen base total (75) led the MLB for the second time in 
four years. He hit .317 and had a career-high 67 RBIs.[15] The Indians 
lost in the 1996 ALDS to the Baltimore Orioles in four games.[26] As an 
impending free agent, it was Lofton's last season with Cleveland before 
being traded to near the end of spring training 1997 to the Atlanta Braves 
of the National League. On trading Lofton, Hart said, "We had to make this 
trade and based on the fact that Lofton could be a free agent at the end 
of this season. We went through it with Albert Belle last year, and Albert 
left and we had nothing in return. We were not prepared to do that again."[27]:p.211 
Lofton, described as "an emotional and offensive catalyst"[by whom?] with 
the Indians, appeared in three consecutive All-Star Games (1994–1996) and 
won four straight Gold Glove Awards (1993–1996) with the Indians.[28] He 
led the AL in stolen bases for five straight seasons (1992–1996) and set 
the single-season Indians' franchise stolen base record (75).[16][29] The 
Atlanta Braves' Marquis Grissom and slugger David Justice were part of 
a Braves roster that, heading into the 1997 season, was the MLB's highest-paid. 
Grissom ($4.8 million annual salary) and Justice ($6 million) were traded 
to the Indians in return for Lofton ($4.75 million) and Alan Embree ($206,000). 
"This is a trade of enormous magnitude for two very, very good franchises. 
We're talking about franchise-type players", Hart said.[30] For Lofton, 
considered "the centerpiece of the Indians' 1990s revival", it was a return 
to the National League.[31] "The trade will be in the back of my mind for 
a long time, but it's baseball. It happens to nearly everybody. I'm [in 
Atlanta] to play every day. It's all Braves from now on", Lofton said.[32] 
By April 19, the Braves were 13–3 and Lofton's hitting (.453 batting average) 
had won favor with his new Braves teammates.[33] "If he keeps hitting .400 
he'll fit in just fine", said Chipper Jones.[34] For the season Lofton's 
.333 batting average and 27 stolen bases were team-highs (his stolen base 
total was to that point a career-low). He was caught stealing 20 times, 
an MLB-high.[15] Atlanta won the National League East division with a MLB-best 
101–61 record.[35] The Braves swept the Houston Astros in the 1997 National 
League Division Series (NLDS), three games to none.[36] In the 1997 National 
League Championship Series (NLCS), the Braves lost to the Florida Marlins, 
four games to two (the Marlins later defeated the Cleveland Indians in 
the World Series). For the NLCS, Lofton batted .185 and was one of three 
Braves' players who recorded seven strikeouts in the series.[37] For Lofton, 
who was eligible for free agency at the end of the season, it was his only 
season spent with the Braves. Lofton, who was considered the "most sought-after 
free agent" following the 1997 season, returned to the American League 
and Cleveland Indians when he signed a three-year, $24 million contract.[38][39] 
Happy to return to Cleveland, Lofton said, "It's like I was a ghost for 
a year. But now I'm back."[40] Lofton's .282 batting average was to that 
point the lowest of his major league career but his 87 walks were a career-high. 
He did, however, have his second-highest RBI total (64) to that point in 
his career (66) and doubled his stolen base count (54) from the previous 
year (27).[15] The Indians won the AL Central with an 89–73 record and 
their match-up against the Boston Red Sox, three games to one, in the 1998 
ALDS. In the series against the Red Sox, Lofton's .375 batting average 
led the Indians, as did his two stolen bases and six hits.[41] The Indians 
lost the 1998 ALCS in six games to the New York Yankees, who had won 114 
games in the regular season.[42] Lofton tied for third-most number of hits 
and strikeouts and his 27 at-bats led the Indians.[42] For the 1999 season, 
Lofton finished with a .301 batting average, the seventh time in eight 
major league seasons hitting .300 or better. It was, however, the first 
season with Cleveland he did not record 50 or more stolen bases, finishing 
the season with 25.[15] The AL Central-winning Indians (97–65) lost in 
the 1999 ALDS to the Boston Red Sox, three games to two.[43] The Indians 
had led in the series two games to none before losing three games in a 
row and the series. Lofton and Roberto Alomar each had two stolen bases 
in the series but Lofton recorded just two hits in 16 at-bats.[44] In a 
September 3, 2000 12–11 win over the Baltimore Orioles, Lofton tied a MLB 
record previously held by Red Rolfe when he scored in an 18th consecutive 
game.[45] The winning margin was provided by Lofton's 13th-inning home 
run and in the game he tied an Indians' franchise single-game record with 
five stolen bases.[27]:p.640[45] He finished the 2000 season batting .278, 
recording 30 stolen bases and 107 runs (the sixth time crossing home plate 
100 times or more in nine seasons).[15] The Indians finished the regular 
season 90–72 and one game out of the wild card.[46] After missing the post-season 
in 2000, the Indians returned in 2001 after winning the AL Central with 
a 91–71 regular season record. Before winning the division, however, Lofton 
scored the game-winning run during an August 5 game against the Seattle 
Mariners;the Indians were down by 12 runs, and became just the third team 
in MLB history to overcome such a deficit, winning 15–14 in 11 innings.[47] 
Indians catcher Eddie Taubensee, who was involved in the trade which sent 
Lofton from Houston to Cleveland at the beginning of his major league career, 
caught Lofton after he slid into home plate and jumped with excitement 
after discovering he had just scored the game-winning run. "I caught him 
and wasn't going to let him go", Taubensee said.[47] Cleveland won that 
game against Seattle but lost their match-up with the 116-win Mariners 
in the 2001 ALDS.[48] He hit 66 RBIs on the regular season (second-most 
in his career) but failed to record 20 stolen bases for the first time 
in his major league career and batted a career-low .261.[15] Lofton had 
been treated for a rib cage problem that had impacted his play before the 
All-Star break.[49] His second stint with Cleveland lasted through 2001 
in which his salary was for $8 million in his final contract year with 
the club.[50] He became a free agent following the conclusion of the season. 
A free agent in 2002, Lofton signed a one-year, $1.025 million contract 
with the Chicago White Sox.[50] "I looked at the different opportunities 
that I had and this was a team that won 83 games last year while they were 
banged up. Cleveland lost four good players from last year's team, and 
that's going to be hard to replace. This was an easy decision", Lofton 
said on signing with the White Sox.[50] White Sox general manager Kenny 
Williams had stated when Lofton was healthy, like he was during the second 
half of the 2001 season, Chicago had obtained one of the best leadoff hitters 
in the game.[49] When the White Sox were paired against the Indians in 
April during a three-game series at Chicago, the Indians were on a 10-game 
winning streak and at 11–1, had the best record in the majors. The White 
Sox ended the streak and for the series, Lofton was 6-for-14 with six runs 
scored.[51][52] "You can't say enough about him, his effort, his intensity. 
He's been simply amazing", said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel.[52] Lofton 
appeared in 93 games with the White Sox and hit .259 with 42 RBIs and 22 
stolen bases.[15] On July 28 he was traded to the San Francisco Giants 
of the National League for minor leaguers Ryan Meaux and Félix Díaz.[15] 
In the Giants' match-up with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2002 NLCS, 
Lofton delivered a key hit to help the Giants win their first pennant since 
1989. In the ninth inning, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa summoned left-handed 
reliever Steve Kline to face Lofton, who had already notched two singles 
in the game. Giants manager Dusty Baker considered bringing a right-handed 
hitter to pinch-hit for Lofton, but decided against doing so on the advice 
of his 3-year-old son.[53] Lofton would hit a first-pitch single to the 
outfield, scoring David Bell from second base and creating a 2–1 Giants 
victory. After the game, Baker remarked, "I just knew Kenny was focused 
and I know you can't keep Kenny down for too long. That's why we got Kenny 
over here. He's a big-game player and he's been great in the playoffs."[53] 
The Giants would hold a five-run lead in the seventh inning of Game Six 
of the World Series against the Anaheim Angels, but eight outs away from 
winning the World Series, the Angels rallied to win 6–5. The Angels took 
Game Seven the following night, and for the second time in his career, 
Lofton had lost a World Series. The Pittsburgh Pirates signed Lofton to 
a one-year, $1.025 million contract to begin the 2003 season.[54] With 
the Pirates he hit .277 and stole 18 bases in 84 games before being traded 
to the Chicago Cubs, where he was reunited with manager Dusty Baker.[15][55] 
When Lofton joined the Cubs in July, he was joining a team that just one 
season before had lost 95 games. "With Kenny Lofton we got a quality leadoff 
man", said Cubs general manager Jim Hendry. In 56 regular season game appearances 
with the Cubs, Lofton stole 12 bases and hit .327.[15] Lofton and the Cubs 
won the National League Central division (88–74).[56] With the Cubs' post-season 
berth it was just the sixth time since the divisional series format was 
introduced (1969) had a team made the postseason after having lost 95 games 
or more the previous season.[57] Chicago beat the Atlanta Braves three 
games to none in the 2003 NLDS. Lofton hit .286 in the series and led the 
Cubs with three stolen bases and 21 at-bats.[58] The Cubs, who were up 
in the series three games to one, held a three-run lead in the eighth inning 
of Game Six of the 2003 NLCS. The Florida Marlins scored eight unanswered 
runs, all in the eighth inning, to win Game Six and won Game Seven the 
following night to eliminate the Cubs.[59] Lofton's .323 against the Marlins 
led the Cubs' starting line-up, as did his 31 at-bats, and he had the team's 
only stolen base of the seven-game series.[59] Lofton was again on the 
move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, 
$6.2 million contract.[60] During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton 
recorded his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began 
an ovation in honor of Lofton. "I didn't know what to expect. I figured 
I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept 
going. If there was a storybook way for me to get it, to get it in Cleveland, 
it was something to remember."[61] New York finished the regular season 
with an AL-best record, 101–61.[62] To begin the post-season, the Yankees 
defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In 
the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 2–0 series 
lead when Lofton stated, "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. 
I'm at a point in my career – I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. 
This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again."[63] Then Yankees 
would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first 
team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 3–0 series. Lofton, 
who appeared in 83 games with the Yankees, felt manager Joe Torre did not 
use his skills appropriately.[64] Lofton finished the regular season with 
a .275 batting average and a career-low seven stolen bases. With the Yankees 
looking to reshape their roster and the Philadelphia Phillies looking for 
a player with post-season experience, Lofton was dealt on December 3, 2004, 
which as part of the deal also had the Yankees sending $1.525 million to 
Philadelphia and the Phillies giving up reliever Felix Rodríguez.[65] After 
the trade, Lofton stated, "It's been very tough. I'm the kind of guy that 
likes to be settled down. It's been very tough the last three or four years. 
Everyone in New York understood I wanted to play. I just wanted an opportunity 
to perform and be a part of the team. I didn't feel as much of a part of 
the team."[65] With the Phillies, Lofton hit .335 in 110 appearances, his 
batting average a team-high.[66] He also recorded 22 stolen bases.[15] 
The Phillies finished 88–74, two games NL East division winners and one 
game out of the wild card.[67] Toward the end of his career, Lofton was 
featured in a DHL Express TV commercial, where the international shipper 
comically portrayed Lofton's frequent city changes and subsequent moves.[68] 
On December 12, 2006, the Texas Rangers signed Lofton to a one-year contract.[29] 
By signing with the Rangers, Lofton tied Todd Zeile for most teams played 
for by a position player.[69] In 84 games with the Rangers, he hit .303 
with 16 doubles.[70] On July 27, 2007, Lofton was traded by the Rangers 
to the Indians in exchange for minor league catcher Max Ramírez.[71] "That's 
my biggest thing right now. I'm trying to get a World Series ring", Lofton 
said on joining the Indians for the third time in his career.[72] The Jacobs 
Field crowd greeted Lofton with a standing ovation during his first at 
bat for this tour of duty with the Indians. Lofton noted, "I missed being 
in Cleveland... I enjoy Cleveland. It's the city that got me going."[73] 
In Game One of the 2007 ALDS against the Yankees, he went 3-for-4 with 
four RBIs and one stolen base, which tied him with Rickey Henderson for 
the MLB's all-time postseason stolen bases record (33). In Game Two, he 
went 2-for-3 with two walks and scored the winning run in the 11th inning. 
Then, in Game Three of the 2007 ALCS, the 40-year-old Lofton hit a two-run 
home run against the Boston Red Sox' Daisuke Matsuzaka, becoming the seventh-oldest 
player to hit a post-season home run.[74] Lofton earned his 34th career 
postseason stolen base in Game Four of the 2007 ALCS, setting a new MLB 
record for playoff steals.[75] The Indians, who at one point had a 3–1 
game lead over the Red Sox, eventually lost the series. Lofton became a 
free agent at the end of the season but did not sign a contract with a 
major league team. He expressed interest in playing before the 2009 season.[76] 
From 2002 to 2007, Lofton played for eight teams and made it to the postseason 
with four of them.[77] Joe Torre said, after Lofton had been to the playoffs 
in 11 of the past 13 seasons and played for 11 clubs in his career, "He 
bounced around a lot of clubs for a reason: They felt he could help them. 
He did a hell of a job."[72] As Rollie Fingers wrote, "On one hand, Lofton 
could be seen as a catalyst who magically sparked his teams into playoff 
contention, but others could say that it was simply a case of top playoff 
contenders repeatedly seeing him as the final piece of their puzzle."[7]:p.90–91 
His 622 stolen bases rank him fifteenth all-time. He holds the Indians' 
record for stolen bases with 452.[16] Lofton had tallied a .299 career 
batting average with 123 home runs, 110 triples, and 1,442 runs in 1,967 
games.[15] He was also a three-time MLB Player of the Week.[78] Lofton 
played in 95 postseason games. In the playoffs for his career, he hit .247 
with seven home runs and 34 RBI.[15] Baseball historian Bill James named 
Lofton the "fastest player" and "best bunter" of the 1990s.[79] On January 
27, 2010, it was announced Lofton was selected as a member of the Cleveland 
Indians Hall of Fame. He was inducted on August 7.[80] Lofton was eligible 
for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013 and some have written his 
career numbers "will likely put him in the conversation of being Hall of 
Fame worthy."[69][81][82] He did not receive the necessary number of votes 
to remain on the ballot for 2014 and beyond. In 2015, Pedro Martínez, one 
of the most dominant pitchers of Lofton's era, named Lofton as among the 
most difficult hitters to pitch against in his career.[83] Lofton has his 
own television production company FilmPool, Inc..[9][84] In 1997, he appeared 
as a guest star on The Wayans Bros. and in 2004 he appeared as a guest 
star on George Lopez. Lofton co-wrote the song "What If" on Ruben Studdard's 
2006 album Soulful.[85] In 2008, Lofton qualified for the American Century 
Celebrity Golf Classic. He played golf in the off-season during his playing 
days.[86] For the 2011 spring training season, Lofton was hired by the 
Indians to coach baserunning and outfield work.[87] He is also a post-game 
color commentator on the Fox Sports West post-game show for the Los Angeles
