Louisville (pronounced i/ˈluːəvəl/, i/ˈlʌvəl/ or i/ˈluːiːvɪl/) is the largest 
city in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the 30th-most populous city in 
the United States.[d][5] It is one of two cities in Kentucky designated 
as first-class, the other being the state's second-largest city of Lexington.[e] 
Louisville is the historical seat and, since 2003, the nominal seat of 
Jefferson County. Louisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark 
and is named after King Louis XVI of France, making Louisville one of the 
oldest cities west of the Appalachian Mountains. Sited beside the Falls 
of the Ohio, the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper 
Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, the settlement first grew as a portage 
site. It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, 
which grew into a 6,000-mile (9,700 km) system across 13 states. Today, 
the city is known as the home of the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
the University of Louisville and its Louisville Cardinals athletic teams, 
Louisville Slugger baseball bats, and three of Kentucky's six Fortune 500 
companies.[13] Its main airport is also the site of United Parcel Service's 
worldwide air hub. Since 2003, Louisville's borders have been the same 
as those of Jefferson County because of a city-county merger.[14] The official 
name of this consolidated city-county government is the Louisville/Jefferson County 
Metro Government,[15] abbreviated to Louisville Metro.[16] Despite the 
merger and renaming, the term "Jefferson County" continues to be used in 
some contexts in reference to Louisville Metro, particularly including 
the incorporated cities outside the "balance" which make up Louisville 
proper. The city's total consolidated population as of the 2014 census 
estimate was 760,026.[4] However, the balance total of 612,780[5] excludes 
other incorporated places and semiautonomous towns within the county and 
is the population listed in most sources and national rankings. The Louisville-Jefferson 
County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), sometimes also referred 
to as Kentuckiana,[17][18] includes Louisville-Jefferson County and 12 
surrounding counties, seven in Kentucky and five in Southern Indiana. As 
of 2014, the MSA had a population of 1,269,702,[8] ranking 43rd nationally.[a] 
The history of Louisville spans hundreds of years, and has been influenced 
by the area's geography and location. The rapids at the Falls of the Ohio 
created a barrier to river travel, and as a result, settlements grew up 
at this stopping point. The first European settlement in the vicinity of 
modern-day Louisville was on Corn Island in 1778 by Col. George Rogers 
Clark, credited as the founder of Louisville. Several landmarks in the 
community are named after him.[19] Two years later, in 1780, the Virginia 
General Assembly approved the town charter of Louisville. The city was 
named in honor of King Louis XVI of France, whose soldiers were then aiding 
Americans in the Revolutionary War. Early residents lived in forts to protect 
themselves from Indian raids, but moved out by the late 1780s.[20] In 1803, 
explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark organized their expedition 
across America in the town of Clarksville, Indiana at the present-day Falls 
of the Ohio opposite Louisville, Kentucky.[21][22] The city's early growth 
was influenced by the fact that river boats had to be unloaded and moved 
downriver before reaching the falls. By 1828, the population had swelled 
to 7,000 and Louisville became an incorporated city. The city grew rapidly 
in its formative years.[23] Louisville was a major shipping port and slaves 
worked in a variety of associated trades. The city was often a point of 
escape for slaves to the north, as Indiana was a free state. During the 
Civil War, Louisville was a major stronghold of Union forces, which kept 
Kentucky firmly in the Union. It was the center of planning, supplies, 
recruiting, and transportation for numerous campaigns, especially in the 
Western Theater. By the end of the war, Louisville had not been attacked, 
although skirmishes and battles, including the battles of Perryville and 
Corydon, took place nearby. After Reconstruction, returning Confederate 
veterans largely took political control of the city, leading to the jibe 
that Louisville joined the Confederacy after the war was over. The first 
Kentucky Derby was held on May 17, 1875, at the Louisville Jockey Club 
track (later renamed Churchill Downs). The Derby was originally shepherded 
by Meriwether Lewis Clark, Jr., the grandson of William Clark of the Lewis 
and Clark Expedition, and grandnephew of the city's founder George Rogers 
Clark. Horse racing had a strong tradition in Kentucky, whose Inner Bluegrass 
Region had been a center of breeding high-quality livestock throughout 
the 19th century. Ten thousand spectators watched the first Derby, which 
Aristides won.[24] On March 27, 1890, the city was devastated and its downtown 
nearly destroyed when an F4 tornado tore through as part of the middle 
Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak. An estimated 74 to 120 people were 
killed. Throughout January 1937, 19.17 inches (48.7 cm) of rain fell in 
Louisville, and by January 27, the Ohio River crested at a record 57.15 
feet (17.42 m), almost 30 feet (9.1 m) above flood stage. These events 
triggered the "Great Flood of 1937", which lasted into early February. 
The flood submerged 60–70% of the city, caused complete loss of power for 
four days, and forced the evacuation of 175,000 or 230,000 residents, depending 
on sources. Ninety people died as a result of the flood.[25][26] It led 
to dramatic changes in where residents lived. Today, the city is protected 
by numerous flood walls. After the flood, the areas of high elevation in 
the eastern part of the city had decades of residential growth. Louisville 
was a center for factory war production during World War II. In May 1942, 
the U.S. government assigned the Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company, a war 
plant located at Louisville's air field, for wartime aircraft production. 
The factory produced the C-46 Commando cargo plane, among other aircraft. 
In 1946, the factory was sold to International Harvester, which began large-scale 
production of tractors and agricultural equipment. In 1950, the Census 
Bureau reported Louisville's population as 84.3% white and 15.6% black.[27] 
Similar to many other older American cities, Louisville began to experience 
a movement of people and businesses to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. 
Middle class residents used newly built freeways and interstate highways 
to commute to work, moving into more distant but newer housing. Because 
of tax laws, businesses found it cheaper to build new rather than renovate 
older buildings. Economic changes included a decline in local manufacturing. 
The West End and older areas of the South End, in particular, began to 
decline economically as many local factories closed. In 1974, a major (F4) 
tornado hit Louisville as part of the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes 
that struck 13 states. It covered 21 miles (34 km) and destroyed several 
hundred homes in the Louisville area. Only two people died.[28] Since the 
1980s, many of the city's urban neighborhoods have been revitalized into 
areas popular with young professionals and college students. The greatest 
change has occurred along the Bardstown Road/Baxter Avenue and Frankfort 
Avenue corridors as well as the Old Louisville neighborhood. In recent 
years, such change has also occurred in the East Market District (NuLu). 
Since the late 1990s, Downtown has experienced significant residential, 
tourist and retail growth, including the addition of major sports complexes 
KFC Yum! Center and Louisville Slugger Field, conversion of waterfront 
industrial sites into Waterfront Park, openings of varied museums (see 
Museums, galleries and interpretive centers below), and the refurbishing 
of the former Galleria into the bustling entertainment complex Fourth Street 
Live!, which opened in 2004. Louisville and Jefferson County have a combined 
area of 397.68 square miles (1,030.0 km2), of which 380.46 square miles 
(985.4 km2) is land and 17.23 square miles (44.6 km2) (4.33%) is covered 
by water.[7] Louisville is southeasterly situated along the border between 
Kentucky and Indiana, the Ohio River, in north-central Kentucky at the 
Falls of the Ohio. Although situated in a Southern state, Louisville is 
influenced by both Southern and Midwestern culture. It is sometimes referred 
to as either one of the northernmost Southern cities or as one of the southernmost 
Northern cities in the United States.[29][30] Louisville is located in 
Kentucky's outer Bluegrass region.[31] Its development has been influenced 
by its location on the Ohio River, which spurred Louisville's growth from 
an isolated camp site into a major shipping port. Much of the city is located 
on a very wide and flat floodplain surrounded by hill country on all sides. 
Much of the area was swampland that had to be drained as the city grew. 
In the 1840s, most creeks were rerouted or placed in canals to prevent 
flooding and disease outbreaks. Areas generally east of I-65 are above 
the flood plain, and are composed of gently rolling hills. The southernmost 
parts of Jefferson County are in the scenic and largely undeveloped Knobs 
region, which is home to Jefferson Memorial Forest. The Louisville-Jefferson 
County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the 43rd largest in 
the United States,[a][8] includes the Kentucky county of Jefferson (coterminous 
with Louisville Metro), plus twelve outlying counties—seven in Kentucky 
and five in Southern Indiana. Louisville's MSA is included in the Louisville–Elizabethtown–Madison, 
KY–IN Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which also includes the Elizabethtown, 
KY MSA, as well as the Madison, IN Micropolitan Statistical Area. The Louisville 
area is near several other urban areas, especially Frankfort, Kentucky 
(the state's capital), Cincinnati, Ohio (the two cities' metropolitan statistical 
areas almost border each other), Lexington, Kentucky, and the Indianapolis, 
Indiana area (especially Columbus, Indiana, to the north of Southern Indiana). 
The downtown business district of Louisville is located immediately south 
of the Ohio River and southeast of the Falls of the Ohio. Major roads extend 
outwards from the downtown area in all directions, like the spokes of a 
wheel. The airport is about 6.75 miles (10.86 km) south of the downtown 
area. The industrial sections of town are to the south and west of the 
airport, while most of the residential areas of the city are to the southwest, 
south, and east of downtown. In 2010, the 22,000-seat KFC Yum! Center was 
completed.[32][33] Twelve of the 15 buildings in Kentucky over 300 feet 
(91 m) are located in downtown Louisville. Another primary business and 
industrial district is located in the suburban area east of the city on 
Hurstbourne Parkway.[34] Louisville's late 19th- and early 20th-century 
development was spurred by three large suburban parks built at the edges 
of the city in 1890. The city's architecture contains a blend of old and 
new. The Old Louisville neighborhood is the largest historic preservation 
district solely featuring Victorian homes and buildings in the United States;[35][36] 
it is also the third-largest such district overall. Many modern skyscrapers 
are located downtown, as well as older preserved structures, such as the 
Southern National Bank building. The buildings of West Main Street in downtown 
Louisville have the largest collection of cast iron facades of anywhere 
outside of New York's SoHo district.[37] Since the mid-20th century, Louisville 
has in some ways been divided into three sides of town: the West End, the 
South End, and the East End. In 2003, Bill Dakan, a University of Louisville 
geography professor, said that the West End, west of 7th Street and north 
of Algonquin Parkway, is "a euphemism for the African American part of 
town" although he points out that this belief is not entirely true, and 
most African Americans no longer live in areas where more than 80% of residents 
are black. Nevertheless, he says the perception is still strong.[38] The 
South End has long had a reputation as a white, working-class part of town, 
while the East End has been seen as middle and upper class.[39] According 
to the Greater Louisville Association of Realtors, the area with the lowest 
median home sales price is west of Interstate 65, in the West and South 
Ends, the middle range of home sales prices are between Interstates 64 
and 65 in the South and East Ends, and the highest median home sales price 
are north of Interstate 64 in the East End.[40] Immigrants from Southeast 
Asia tend to settle in the South End, while immigrants from Eastern Europe 
settle in the East End.[41] Louisville has a humid subtropical climate 
(Köppen Cfa) with four distinct seasons and is located in USDA hardiness 
zones 6b and 7a.[11] Spring-like conditions typically begin in mid-to-late 
March, summer from mid-to-late-May to late September, with fall in the 
October–November period. Seasonal extremes in both temperature and precipitation 
are not uncommon during early spring and late fall; severe weather is not 
uncommon, with occasional tornado outbreaks in the region. Winter typically 
brings a mix of rain, sleet, and snow, with occasional heavy snowfall and 
icing. Louisville averages 4.5 days with low temperatures dipping to 10 °F 
(−12 °C);[42] the first and last freezes of the season on average fall 
on November 2 and April 5, respectively.[43] Summer is typically hazy, 
hot, and humid with long periods of 90–100 °F (32–38 °C) temperatures and 
drought conditions at times. Louisville averages 38 days a year with high 
temperatures at or above 90 °F (32 °C). The mean annual temperature is 
58.2 °F (14.6 °C), with an average annual snowfall of 12.7 inches (32 cm) 
and an average annual rainfall of 44.9 inches (1,140 mm). The wettest seasons 
are spring and summer, although rainfall is fairly constant year round. 
During the winter, particularly in January and February, several days of 
snow can be expected. January is the coldest month, with a mean temperature 
of 34.9 °F (1.6 °C). July is the average hottest month with a mean of 79.3 °F 
(26.3 °C).[44] The highest recorded temperature was 107 °F (42 °C), which 
last occurred on July 14, 1936, and the lowest recorded temperature was 
−22 °F (−30 °C) on January 19, 1994.[45] In 2012, Louisville had the fourth-hottest 
summer on record, with the temperature rising up to 106 °F (41 °C) in July 
and the June all-time monthly record high temperature being broken on two 
consecutive days.[43] As the city exemplifies the urban heat island effect, 
temperatures in commercial areas and in the industrialized areas along 
interstates are often higher than in the suburbs, often as much as 5 °F 
(2.8 °C). As of the 2010 census, Louisville Metro held a population of 
741,096,[4] while the "balance" area of Louisville proper[49] included 
597,337.[5] Due to the city-county merger in 2003, the city's population 
had greatly expanded from the premerger area of Louisville, which held 
only 245,315 people in 2007. Louisville is the largest city in Kentucky, 
with 17.1% of the state's total population as of 2010; the balance's percentage 
was 13.8%.[50] In 2010, over one-third of the population growth in Kentucky 
was in Louisville's CSA counties.[citation needed] The 2007 demographic 
breakdown for the entire Louisville Metro area was 74.8% White (71.7% non-Hispanic), 
22.2% Black, 0.6% American Indian, 2.0% Asian, 0.1% Hawaiian or Pacific 
islander, 1.4% other, and 1.6% multiracial. About 2.9% of the total population 
was identified as Hispanic of any race. During the same year, the area 
of premerger Louisville consisted 60.1% White, 35.2% African American, 
1.9% Asian, 0.2% American Indian, and 3.0% other, with 2.4% identified 
as Hispanic of any race. Of the 287,012 households, 29.6% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 45.2% were married couples living 
together, 14.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.2% 
were not families. About 30.5% of all households were made up of individuals, 
and 10.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.37 and the average family size was 2.97. The 
age distribution is 24.3% under the age of 18, 8.9% from 18 to 24, 30.4% 
from 25 to 44, 22.8% from 45 to 64, and 13.5% who were 65 years of age 
or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 
91.60 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.60 males. 
The median income for a household is $39,457 and for a family was $49,161. 
Males had a median income of $36,484 versus $26,255 for females. The per 
capita income for the county was $22,352. About 9.5% of families and 12.4% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.1% of those 
under age 18 and 8.8% of those ages 65 or over. Louisville hosts religious 
institutions of various faiths, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, 
Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism. The 135,421 Roman Catholic Louisvillians 
are part of the Archdiocese of Louisville, covering 24 counties in central 
Kentucky, and consisting of 121 parishes and missions spread over 8,124 
square miles (21,040 km2).[51] The Cathedral of the Assumption in downtown 
Louisville is the seat of the Archdiocese of Louisville. Our Lady of Gethsemani 
Abbey, the monastic home of Catholic writer Thomas Merton, is in nearby 
Bardstown, Kentucky, and also in the archdiocese. Most of Louisville's 
Roman Catholic population is of German descent, the result of large-scale 
19th-century immigration. Bellarmine University and Spalding University 
in Louisville are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. One in three 
Louisvillians is Southern Baptist, belonging to one of 147 local congregations.[52] 
This denomination increased in number when large numbers of people moved 
into Louisville in the early 20th century from rural Kentucky and Tennessee 
to work in the city's factories; some of these migrants also formed Holiness 
and Pentecostal churches and Churches of Christ. German immigrants in the 
19th century brought not only a large Catholic population, but also the 
Lutheran and Evangelical faiths, which are represented today in Louisville 
by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church-Missouri 
Synod, and the United Church of Christ, respectively. The city is home 
to several megachurches. Southeast Christian Church, with its main campus 
in Middletown and three others in the surrounding region, is the fifth-largest 
of the Christian churches in the United States, and St. Stephen Baptist 
Church[53] has the largest African American congregation.[clarification 
needed] The city is home to several religious institutions: the Southern 
Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville Bible College, Louisville Presbyterian 
Theological Seminary, and the denominational headquarters of the Presbyterian 
Church (USA). The Jewish population of around 8,500 in the city is served 
by five synagogues. Most Jewish families emigrated from Eastern Europe 
at the start of the 20th century; around 800 Soviet Jews have moved to 
Louisville since 1991.[54] Jewish immigrants founded Jewish Hospital in 
what was once the center of the city's Jewish district. From 2005–2012, 
Jewish Hospital merged with two Kentucky-based Catholic healthcare systems 
to form KentuckyOne Health, which later in 2012 announced a partnership 
with the University of Louisville Hospital. A significant focal point for 
Louisville's Jewish community is located near Bowman Field, where there 
are two Orthodox synagogues (including Anshei Sfard, founded in 1893), 
the Jewish Community Center, Jewish Family and Career Services, and an 
affordable housing complex. Since 1996, every May, the Festival of Faiths,[55] 
a five-day national interfaith gathering, is held featuring music, poetry, 
film, art and dialogue with internationally renowned spiritual leaders, 
thinkers and practitioners. The festival is organized by the Center for 
Interfaith Relations[56] and is held at Actors Theatre of Louisville.[57][58] 
Louisville today is home to dozens of companies and organizations across 
several industrial classifications. However, the underpinning of the city's 
economy since its earliest days has been the shipping and cargo industries. 
Its strategic location at the Falls of the Ohio, and its unique position 
in the central United States (within one day's road travel to 60% of the 
cities in the continental U.S.) make it a practical location for the transfer 
of cargo along its route to other destinations.[59] The Louisville and 
Portland Canal and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad were important 
links in water and rail transportation. Louisville's importance to the 
shipping industry continues today with the presence of the Worldport global 
air-freight hub for UPS at Louisville International Airport. Louisville's 
location at the crossroads of three major interstate highways (I-64, I-65, 
and I-71) also contributes to its modern-day strategic importance to the 
shipping and cargo industry. As of 2003, Louisville ranks as the seventh-largest 
inland port in the United States.[60] Louisville has emerged as a major 
center for the health care and medical sciences industries. It has been 
central to advancements in heart and hand surgery, as well as cancer treatment. 
Some of the earliest artificial heart transplants were conducted in Louisville. 
Its thriving downtown medical research campus includes a new $88 million 
rehabilitation center and a health sciences research and commercialization 
park, that in partnership with the University of Louisville, has lured 
nearly 70 top scientists and researchers. Louisville is also home to Humana, 
one of the nation's largest health insurance companies. Louisville for 
a long time was also home to the Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company, 
at its peak one of the largest manufacturers and wholesale distributors 
of hardware in the United States, as well as Brown & Williamson, the third-largest 
company in the tobacco industry before merging with R. J. Reynolds in 2004 
to form the Reynolds American Company. Brown & Williamson, one of the subjects 
of the tobacco industry scandals of the 1990s, was the focus of The Insider, 
a 1999 film shot around the Louisville area. Also located in Louisville 
are two major Ford plants, the headquarters of GE Appliances & Lighting 
(a subsidiary of General Electric), and a major General Electric appliance 
factory. Louisville is a major center of the American whiskey industry, 
with about one-third of all bourbon coming from Louisville.[61][62][63][64] 
Brown-Forman, one of the major makers of American whiskey, is headquartered 
in Louisville and operates a distillery in the Louisville suburb of Shively. 
The current primary distillery site operated by Heaven Hill, called the 
Bernheim distillery, is also located in Louisville near Brown-Forman's 
distillery. Other distilleries and related businesses can also be found 
in neighboring cities in Kentucky, such as Bardstown, Clermont, Lawrenceburg, 
and Loretto. Similar to the Kentucky Bourbon Trail that links these central 
Kentucky locations, Louisville offers tourists its own "Urban Bourbon Trail",[65] 
where people can stop at nearly 20 "area bars and restaurants, all offering 
at least 50 labels of America's only native spirit."[63] Louisville prides 
itself in its large assortment of small, independent businesses and restaurants, 
some of which have become known for their ingenuity and creativity. In 
1926, the Brown Hotel became the home of the Hot Brown "sandwich". A few 
blocks away, the Seelbach Hotel, which F. Scott Fitzgerald references in 
The Great Gatsby, is also famous for a secret back room where Al Capone 
would regularly meet with associates during the Prohibition era. The drink 
the Old Fashioned was invented in Louisville's Pendennis Club. Several 
major motion pictures have also been filmed in or near Louisville, including 
The Insider, Goldfinger, Stripes, Lawn Dogs, Elizabethtown, and Secretariat. 
Louisville is home to many annual cultural events. Perhaps most well-known 
is the Kentucky Derby, held annually during the first Saturday of May. 
The Derby is preceded by a two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival, which 
starts with the annual Thunder Over Louisville, the largest annual fireworks 
display in North America.[66] The Kentucky Derby Festival also features 
notable events such as the Pegasus Parade, The Great Steamboat Race, Great 
Balloon Race, a combined marathon/mini marathon and about seventy events 
in total. Esquire magazine has called the Kentucky Derby "the biggest party 
in the south." Usually beginning in late February or early March is the 
Humana Festival of New American Plays at Actors Theatre of Louisville, 
an internationally acclaimed new-play festival that lasts approximately 
six weeks. On Memorial Day weekend, Louisville hosts the largest annual 
Beatles Festival in the world, Abbey Road on the River. The festival lasts 
five days and is located on the Belvedere in downtown Louisville. The summer 
season in Louisville also features a series of cultural events such as 
the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival (commonly called "Shakespeare in Central 
Park"), held in July of every year and features free Shakespeare plays 
in Central Park in Old Louisville. Also in July, the Forecastle Festival 
draws 35,000 visitors annually to Louisville Waterfront Park in celebration 
of the best in music, art and environmental activism. Past performers include 
The Black Keys, The Flaming Lips, Widespread Panic, The Smashing Pumpkins, 
The Avett Brothers, The Black Crowes and hundreds more. The Kentucky State 
Fair is held every August at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville 
as well, featuring an array of culture from all areas of Kentucky. In places, 
the African American community celebrates Juneteenth commemorating June 
19, 1865, when slaves in the western territories learned of their freedom.[67][68][69] 
In September, in nearby Bardstown, is the annual Kentucky Bourbon Festival, 
which celebrates the history and art of distilling bourbon whiskey. The 
suburb of Jeffersontown is also the home of the annual Gaslight Festival, 
a series of events spread over a week. Attendance is approximately 200,000 
for the week. The month of October features the St. James Court Art Show 
in Old Louisville. Thousands of artists gather on the streets and in the 
courtyard to exhibit and sell their wares, and the event is attended by 
many art collectors and enthusiasts. The show is the second most-attended 
event next to the Derby. Another art-related event that occurs every month 
is the First Friday Hop.[70] A free TARC bus takes art lovers to many downtown 
area (especially East Market District/NuLu) independent art galleries on 
the first Friday of every month. Louisville has blossomed as a booming 
center for independent art, music and business. A Louisville locale that 
highlights this scene is Bardstown Road, an area located in the heart of 
the Highlands. Bardstown Road is known for its cultural diversity and local 
trade. The majority of the businesses along Bardstown Road, such as coffee 
shops, clothing stores and art galleries, are locally owned and operated 
businesses. Though it is only about one mile (1.6 km) long, this strip 
of Bardstown Road constitutes much of the city's culture and diverse lifestyle, 
contributing to the unofficial "Keep Louisville Weird" slogan. Just a few 
blocks down the road was ear X-tacy, a local record store that was a fixture 
in the Louisville music scene for many years until late 2011. In downtown 
Louisville, 21c Museum Hotel, a hotel that showcases contemporary art installations 
and exhibitions throughout its public spaces, and features a red penguin 
on its roof, is, according to The New York Times, "an innovative concept 
with strong execution and prompt and enthusiastic service." Louisville 
is home to a thriving indie music scene with bands such as Love Jones, 
Tantric, Squirrel Bait, CABIN, Slint, My Morning Jacket, Houndmouth, Young 
Widows and Wax Fang. Acclaimed singer/songwriters Will Oldham, who performs 
under the moniker "Bonnie 'Prince' Billy", is a resident, as was country/rock 
singer/songwriter Tim Krekel. Cellist Ben Sollee splits his time between 
Louisville and Lexington. Long running rock/jazz fusion band NRBQ also 
formed in Louisville in the late 1960s as well as 1980s psychobilly band 
Bodeco. Post-grunge band Days of the New, at one time including future 
breakout pop star Nicole Scherzinger, formed in Louisville in the mid-1990s. 
The Louisville music scene reaches a crescendo every July during the Forecastle 
Festival, a three-day music, art and environmental activism festival taking 
place at Louisville Waterfront Park. Especially catering to Louisville's 
music scene is 91.9 WFPK Radio Louisville, a local public radio station 
funded, in part, from local listeners. The station features not only national 
and international musicians common to public radio, but also local and 
regional talent. The station also hosts summer concerts on the waterfront 
from April until July, where up-and-coming alternative artists are brought 
to stage. The West Main District in downtown Louisville features what is 
locally known as "Museum Row". In this area is the Frazier History Museum, 
which opened its doors in 2004 as an armaments museum, featuring the only 
collection of Royal Armouries artifacts outside of the United Kingdom. 
Since then the Frazier has expanded its focus to broader history. The Frazier 
Museum has three floors of exhibits, an education center and a tournament 
ring, which presents daily performances, as well as event spaces available 
for rent, including a rooftop garden featuring native plants and 4th floor 
loft-style space that accommodates up to 360 people seated. Also nearby 
is the Kentucky Science Center, which is Kentucky's largest hands-on science 
center and features interactive exhibits, IMAX films, educational programs 
and technology networks. The Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft, opened in 
1981, is a nonprofit organization with a mission to support and promote 
excellence in art, craft, applied arts and design. The Muhammad Ali Center 
opened November 2005 in "Museum Row" and features Louisville native Muhammad 
Ali's boxing memorabilia. The National Society of the Sons of the American 
Revolution (SAR) is a patriotic, historical, and educational non-profit 
organization and a leading male lineage society that perpetuates the ideals 
of the American war for independence and the founding of our nation. The 
SAR opened its National Genealogical Research Library in 2010 along Louisville's 
Museum Row next door to its national headquarters, with an on-site American 
Revolutionary War Education Center expected to be completed soon. The Speed 
Art Museum opened in 1927 and is the oldest and largest art museum in the 
state of Kentucky. Located adjacent to the University of Louisville, the 
museum features over 12,000 pieces of art in its permanent collection and 
hosts traveling exhibitions. Multiple art galleries are located in the 
city, but they are especially concentrated in the East Market District 
(NuLu), immediately to the east of downtown. This row of galleries, plus 
others in the West Main District, are prominently featured in the monthly 
First Friday Hop. Several local history museums can be found in the Louisville 
area. The most prominent among them is The Filson Historical Society, founded 
in 1884, which has holdings exceeding 1.5 million manuscript items and 
over 50,000 volumes in the library. The Filson's extensive collections 
focus on Kentucky, the Upper South and the Ohio River Valley, and contain 
a large collection of portraiture and over 10,000 museum artifacts. Other 
local history museums include the Portland Museum, Historic Locust Grove, 
Conrad-Caldwell House Museum, the Falls of the Ohio State Park interpretive 
center (Clarksville, Indiana), Howard Steamboat Museum (Jeffersonville, 
Indiana) and the Carnegie Center for Art and History (New Albany, Indiana). 
The Falls interpretive center, part of the Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife 
Conservation Area, also functions as a natural history museum, covering 
findings in the nearby exposed Devonian fossil bed. There are also several 
historical properties and items of interest in the area, including the 
Belle of Louisville, the oldest Mississippi-style steamboat in operation 
in the United States. The United States Marine Hospital of Louisville is 
considered by the National Park Service to be the best remaining antebellum 
hospital in the United States.[71] It was designed by Robert Mills, who 
is best known as the designer of the Washington Monument. Fort Knox, spread 
out among Bullitt, Hardin and Meade Counties (two of which are in the Louisville 
metropolitan area), is home to the U.S. Bullion Depository and the General 
George Patton Museum. The previously mentioned Locust Grove, former home 
of Louisville Founder George Rogers Clark, portrays life in the early days 
of the city. Other notable properties include the Farmington Historic Plantation 
(home of the famous Speed family), Riverside, The Farnsley-Moremen Landing 
and the restored Union Station, which opened in 1891. The Louisville area 
is also home to the Waverly Hills Sanatorium, a turn-of-the-century (20th) 
hospital that was originally built to accommodate tuberculosis patients, 
and subsequently has been reported and sensationalized to be haunted. The 
Little Loomhouse maintains historical records of local spinning and weaving 
patterns and techniques, and also offers tours, hands-on activities, and 
professional-level classes and materials. The Kentucky Center, dedicated 
in 1983, located in the downtown hotel and entertainment district, features 
a variety of plays and concerts. This is also the home of the Louisville 
Ballet, Louisville Orchestra, Bourbon Baroque, StageOne Family Theatre, 
Kentucky Shakespeare Festival, which operates the oldest professional outdoor 
Shakespeare festival, and the Kentucky Opera, which is the twelfth oldest 
opera in the United States. The Louisville Orchestra was founded in 1937 
by conductor Robert Whitney and Charles Farnsley, then Mayor of Louisville, 
and was a world leader in commissioning and recording contemporary works 
for orchestra from the 1950s to 1980s. The Louisville Orchestra today performs 
more than 125 concerts per year with a core of salaried musicians and is 
recognized as a cornerstone of the Louisville arts community. Actors Theatre 
of Louisville, is in the city's urban cultural district and hosts the Humana 
Festival of New American Plays each spring. It presents approximately six 
hundred performances of about thirty productions during its year-round 
season, composed of a diverse array of contemporary and classical fare. 
Louisville is home to a fast-growing independent theatre scene. Theatre 
502, Savage Rose Classical Theatre, The Bard's Town Theatre Company, The 
Liminal Playhouse, Looking For Lilith, Bunbury Theatre Company, Louisville 
Repertory Theatre, Louisville Improvisors, Pandora Productions, Eve Theatre 
Company, Squallis Puppeteers and Baby Horse Theatre all curate full seasons 
of contemporary, classical and experimental work. The Louisville Palace, 
the official venue for the Louisville Orchestra, is an ornate theatre in 
downtown Louisville's so-called theatre district. In addition to orchestra 
performances, the theatre shows films and hosts concerts. Iroquois Park 
is the home of the renovated Iroquois Amphitheater, which hosts a variety 
of musical concerts in a partially covered outdoor setting. College sports 
are popular in the Louisville area. The Louisville Cardinals have competed 
as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), since joining that league 
in July 2014. College basketball is particularly popular. The Louisville 
Cardinals's Freedom Hall averaged sellouts for 10 straight years and the 
downtown KFC Yum! Center following suit with regular sellouts. The Cardinals 
ranked third nationally in attendance in 2012–13,[72] the most recent of 
the program's three national championship seasons. The Cardinals also hold 
the Big East conference women's basketball paid attendance record with 
nearly 17,000 attending the game against the Kentucky Wildcats in 2008. 
The Louisville market has ranked first in ratings for the NCAA men's basketball 
tournament every year since 1999.[73] The Kentucky Wildcats used to play 
an annual game in Freedom Hall. The Louisville Cardinals football team—which 
had produced successful NFL players such as Johnny Unitas, Deion Branch, 
Sam Madison, David Akers, Ray Buchanan, Michael Bush, Harry Douglas, and 
Teddy Bridgewater—under coach Howard Schnellenberger defeated Alabama in 
the 1991 Fiesta Bowl. The program joined the Big East Conference and won 
the 2007 Orange Bowl under Bobby Petrino and the 2013 Sugar Bowl under 
Charlie Strong. Petrino returned as head coach in 2014. The University 
of Louisville baseball team advanced to the College World Series in Omaha 
in 2007, 2013, and 2014, as one of the final eight teams to compete for 
the national championship. Horse racing is also a major attraction. Churchill 
Downs is home to the Kentucky Derby, the largest sporting event in the 
state, as well as the Kentucky Oaks which together cap the two-week-long 
Kentucky Derby Festival. Churchill Downs has also hosted the renowned Breeders' 
Cup on six occasions, most recently in 2006. Louisville is also the home 
of Valhalla Golf Club which hosted the 1996, 2000 and 2014 PGA Championships, 
the 2004 Senior PGA Championship and the 2008 Ryder Cup. It is also home 
to David Armstrong Extreme Park (formerly Louisville Extreme Park), which 
skateboarder Tony Hawk has called one of his top five skate parks.[74] 
Louisville has seven professional and semi-professional sports teams, but 
no major league teams. It is the fourth largest U.S. city without one, 
with only Austin, Texas, Fort Worth, Texas and El Paso, Texas larger. The 
Louisville Bats are a baseball team playing in the International League 
as the Class AAA affiliate of the nearby Cincinnati Reds. The team plays 
at Louisville Slugger Field at the edge of the city's downtown. In 2014 
Louisville City FC, a professional soccer team in the league then known 
as USL Pro and now as the United Soccer League, was announced. The team 
made its debut in 2015, playing home games at Louisville Slugger Field. 
In its first season, Louisville City was the official reserve side for 
Orlando City SC while making its debut in Major League Soccer at the same 
time. That arrangement ended in 2016, when Orlando City established a directly 
controlled reserve side in the USL. Louisville had two professional American 
football teams in the National Football League: the Louisville Breckenridges 
(or Brecks for short) from 1921 to 1924 and the Louisville Colonels in 
1926.[75] Between 1967 and 1976, Louisville was home to the Kentucky Colonels 
of the American Basketball Association. The Colonels was one of the ABA's 
most successful teams during its existence, winning four division titles 
and the 1975 ABA Championship, but was not invited to join the NBA when 
the two leagues merged in 1976, and subsequently folded. Louisville has 
the added distinction of being the only city in the world that is the birthplace 
of four heavyweight boxing champions:[citation needed] Marvin Hart, Muhammad 
Ali, Jimmy Ellis and Greg Page. Louisville Metro has 122 city parks covering 
more than 13,000 acres (53 km2). Several of these parks were designed by 
Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed New York City's Central Park as 
well as parks, parkways, college campuses and public facilities in many 
U.S. locations. The Louisville Waterfront Park is prominently located on 
the banks of the Ohio River near downtown and features large open areas, 
which often hold free concerts and other festivals. The Big Four Bridge, 
a former railroad bridge spanning 547 feet (167 m) but is now a pedestrian 
bridge connecting Waterfront Park with Jeffersonville, Indiana's waterfront 
park, fully opened in May 2014 with the completion of Jeffersonville's 
ramp.[77][78] Cherokee Park, one of the most visited parks in the nation,[79] 
features a 2.6-mile (4.2 km) mixed-use loop and many well-known landscaping 
and architectural features including the Hogan's Fountain Pavilion. Other 
notable parks in the system include Iroquois Park, Shawnee Park, Seneca 
Park and Central Park. Further from the downtown area is the Jefferson 
Memorial Forest, which at 6,218 acres (25.16 km2) is the largest municipal 
urban forest in the United States.,[80] The forest is designated as a National 
Audubon Society wildlife refuge and offers over 30 miles (48 km) of various 
hiking trails. Otter Creek Outdoor Recreation Area, owned and operated 
by the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, is another large 
park in nearby Brandenburg, Kentucky. The park's namesake, Otter Creek, 
winds along the eastern side of the park. A scenic bend in the Ohio River, 
which divides Kentucky from Indiana, can be seen from northern overlooks 
within the park. The park is a popular mountain biking destination, with 
trails maintained by a local mountain bike organization. Other outdoor 
points of interest in the Louisville area include Cave Hill Cemetery (the 
burial location of Col. Harland Sanders), Zachary Taylor National Cemetery 
(the burial location of President Zachary Taylor), the Louisville Zoo and 
the Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area. In development 
is the City of Parks, a project to create a 110-mile (180 km) continuous 
paved pedestrian and biking trail called the Louisville Loop around Louisville 
Metro while also adding a large amount of park land. Current plans call 
for making approximately 4,000 acres (16 km2) of the Floyds Fork flood 
plain in eastern Jefferson County into a new park system called The Parklands 
of Floyds Fork, expanding area in the Jefferson Memorial Forest, and adding 
riverfront land and wharfs along the Riverwalk and Levee Trail, both completed 
segments of the Louisville Loop. On January 6, 2003, Louisville merged 
its government with that of Jefferson County, forming coterminous borders.[14] 
Louisville was the second and only other city in the state to merge with 
its county since Lexington merged with Fayette County in 1974. Louisville 
Metro is governed by an executive called the Metro Mayor and a city legislature 
called the Metro Council. The second and current Metro Mayor is Greg Fischer 
(D), who entered office on January 3, 2011. The Metro Council consists 
of 26 seats representing districts apportioned by population throughout 
the city and county. The residents of the semi-independent municipalities 
within Louisville Metro are apportioned to districts along with all other 
county residents. Half (13) of the seats come up for reelection every two 
years. The council is chaired by a Council President, currently David Yates 
(D), who is elected by the council members annually. Democrats currently 
have a 17 to 9 seat majority on the council. Before merger, under the Kentucky 
Constitution and statutory law Louisville was designated as a first-class 
city in regard to local laws affecting public safety, alcohol beverage 
control, revenue options, and various other matters; as of 2014, it is 
the only such designated city in the state.[81] The Official Seal of the 
City of Louisville, no longer used following the merger, reflected its 
history and heritage in the fleur-de-lis representing French aid given 
during the Revolutionary War and the thirteen stars signifying the original 
colonies. The new Seal of Louisville Metro retains the fleur-de-lis, but 
has only two stars, one representing the city and the other the county. 
Kentucky's 3rd congressional district encompasses most of Louisville Metro, 
and is represented by Rep. John Yarmuth (D). Far eastern portions of the 
county are part of the 4th congressional district, which is represented 
by Thomas Massie (R).[82][83] In a 2005 survey, Morgan Quitno Press ranked 
Louisville as the seventh safest large city in the United States.[84] The 
2006 edition of the survey ranked Louisville eighth.[85] In 2004, Louisville 
recorded 70 murders. The numbers for 2005 ranged from 55 to 59 (FBI says 
55, LMPD says 59), which was down 16 percent from 2004.[86] In 2006, Louisville-Jefferson 
County recorded 50 murders, which was significantly lower than previous 
years. In 2008, Louisville recorded 79 murders.[87] The Louisville Metro 
Area's overall violent crime rate was 412.6 per 100,000 residents in 2005.[88] 
The Elizabethtown, Kentucky Metro Area, which is part of Louisville's Combined 
Statistical Area, was the 17th safest Metro in the U.S.[89] Kentucky has 
the 5th lowest violent crime rate out of the 50 states.[90] Violent crime 
is most concentrated west of downtown, especially in the Russell neighborhood. 
The West End, located north of Algonquin Parkway and West of 9th Street, 
had 32 of the city's 79 murders in 2007.[91] The primary law enforcement 
agencies are the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) and the Jefferson 
County Sheriff's Office (JCSO). 911 emergency medical services are provided 
by the government as Louisville Metro EMS (LMEMS) which responds to about 
100,000 calls for service annually. Louisville Metro Department of Corrections 
operates two facilities housing approximately 2,000 inmates. Louisville 
has recently been featured on the television show First 48. The show follows 
LMPD's homicide unit while they try to solve murders. Fire protection, 
which is not solely a Metro government function, is provided by 20 independent 
fire departments (most of which are autonomous taxing districts) working 
in concert through mutual aid agreements. The only fire department operated 
by metro government is Louisville Fire & Rescue (formerly Louisville Division 
of Fire before city-county merger in 2003). The independent city of Shively 
in western Jefferson County possesses a city-run department. The other 
18 fire departments in Louisville-Jefferson County are taxing districts 
known collectively as the Jefferson County Fire Service. Louisville is 
home to several institutions of higher learning. There are six four-year 
universities, the University of Louisville, Bellarmine University, Boyce 
College, Spalding University, Sullivan University and Simmons College of 
Kentucky; Louisville Bible College; a two-year community college, Jefferson 
Community and Technical College; and several other business or technical 
schools such as Spencerian College, ITT Technical Institute, Strayer University 
and Sullivan College of Technology and Design. Indiana University Southeast 
is located across the Ohio River in New Albany, Indiana. The University 
of Louisville has had notable achievements including several hand transplants[92] 
and the world's first self-contained artificial heart transplant.[93] The 
school's Health Sciences Center in Downtown Louisville is currently adding 
an expansive medical research market on the city's old Haymarket site, 
which is projected to add 10,000 high paying jobs within 10 years.[when?][citation 
needed] Two major graduate-professional schools of religion are also located 
in Louisville. The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, with more than 
2,000 students, is the flagship institution of the Southern Baptist Convention. 
It was founded in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1859 and moved to Louisville 
in 1877, occupying its present campus on Lexington Road in 1926. Louisville 
Presbyterian Theological Seminary, product of a 1901 merger of two predecessor 
schools founded at Danville, Kentucky in 1853 and in Louisville in 1893, 
occupied its present campus on Alta Vista Road in 1963. According to the 
U.S. Census, of Louisville's population over 25, 21.3% (the national average 
is 24%) hold a bachelor's degree or higher and 76.1% (80% nationally) have 
a high school diploma or equivalent. The public school system, Jefferson 
County Public Schools, consists of more than 100,000 students in 173 schools.[94] 
Due to Louisville's large Catholic population, there are 27 Catholic schools 
in the city. The Kentucky School for the Blind, for all of Kentucky's blind 
and visually impaired students, is located on Frankfort Avenue in the Clifton 
neighborhood. Louisville's newspaper of record is The Courier-Journal. 
The alternative paper is the progressive alt-weekly Louisville Eccentric 
Observer (commonly called 'LEO'), which was founded by 3rd district U.S. 
Representative John Yarmuth (D). WAVE 3, an NBC affiliate, was Kentucky's 
first TV station. Another prominent TV station is ABC affiliate WHAS 11, 
formerly owned by the famous Bingham family (who also owned The Courier-Journal), 
which hosts the regionally notable annual fundraiser, the WHAS Crusade 
for Children. CBS affiliate WLKY 32 and Fox affiliate WDRB 41 (along with 
its sister stations WMYO and WBKI) round out the major television stations 
in the city. The most popular radio station is 84 WHAS 840 AM, designated 
by the FCC as a clear-channel station. This station was also formerly owned 
by the Binghams (now iHeartMedia), and is a talk radio station which also 
broadcasts regional sports. As with most American cities, transportation 
in Louisville is based primarily on automobiles. However, the city traces 
its foundation to the era where the river was the primary means of transportation, 
and railroads have been an important part of local industry for over a 
century. In more recent times, Louisville has become an international hub 
for air cargo. Louisville has inner and outer interstate beltways, I-264 
and I-265 respectively. Interstates I-64 and I-65 pass through Louisville, 
and I-71 has its southern terminus in Louisville. Since all three of these 
highways intersect at virtually the same location on the east side of downtown, 
this spot has become known as "Spaghetti Junction". Two bridges carry I-64 
and I-65 over the Ohio River, and a third automobile bridge carries non-interstate 
traffic, including bicyclists and pedestrians. Immediately east of downtown 
is the Big Four Bridge, a former railroad bridge now renovated as a pedestrian 
bridge. The Ohio River Bridges Project, a plan under consideration for 
decades to construct two new interstate bridges over the Ohio River to 
connect Louisville to Indiana, including a reconfiguration of Spaghetti 
Junction, began construction in 2012.[95] One bridge, the Abraham Lincoln 
Bridge, is located downtown beside the existing Kennedy Bridge for relief 
of I-65 traffic. The other, currently dubbed the East End Crossing, will 
connect I-265 between the portions located in southeast Clark County, Indiana 
and northeast Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville Metro).[96] Both bridges 
and corresponding construction are slated to be finished sometime in 2016.[97][98] 
As with any major project, there have been detractors and possible alternatives; 
one grassroots organization, 8664.org, has proposed options for downtown 
revitalization improvements, and a simpler and less expensive roadway design. 
Louisville's main airport is the centrally located Louisville International 
Airport, whose IATA Airport Code (SDF) reflects its former name of Standiford 
Field. The airport is also home to UPS's Worldport global air hub. UPS 
operates its largest package-handling hub at Louisville International Airport 
and bases its UPS Airlines division there. Over 3.2 million passengers 
and over 4.7 billion pounds (2,350,000 t) of cargo pass through the airport 
each year.[99] It is also the third busiest airport in the United States 
in terms of cargo traffic, and seventh busiest for such in the world.[100] 
Furthermore, since Louisville is located only around 35 minutes from Fort 
Knox, the airport is a major hub for armed services personnel traveling 
to and from the military installation. The historic but smaller Bowman 
Field is used mainly for general aviation while nearby Clark Regional Airport 
is used mostly by private jets. The McAlpine Locks and Dam is located on 
the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, near the downtown area. The locks 
were constructed to allow shipping past the Falls of the Ohio. In 2001 
over 55 million tons of commodities passed through the locks. Public transportation 
consists mainly of buses run by the Transit Authority of River City (TARC). 
The city buses serve all parts of downtown Louisville and Jefferson County, 
as well as Kentucky suburbs in Oldham County, Bullitt County, and the Indiana 
suburbs of Jeffersonville, Clarksville and New Albany. In addition to regular 
city buses, transit throughout the downtown hotel and shopping districts 
is served by a fleet of zero-emissions buses called ZeroBus. In late 2014, 
these vehicles replaced the series of motorized trolleys known as the Toonerville 
II Trolley.[101] A light rail system has been studied and proposed for 
the city, but no plan was in development as of 2007.[102] Louisville has 
historically been a major center for railway traffic. The Louisville and 
Nashville Railroad was once headquartered here, before it was purchased 
by CSX Transportation. Today the city is served by two major freight railroads, 
CSX (with a major classification yard in the southern part of the metro 
area) and Norfolk Southern. Five major main lines connect Louisville to 
the rest of the region. Two regional railroads, the Paducah and Louisville 
Railway and the Louisville and Indiana Railroad, also serve the city. With 
the discontinuance of the stop in Louisville in 2003 for a more northerly 
route between New York and Chicago, the Kentucky Cardinal no longer serves 
the city; it is thus the fifth largest city in the country with no passenger 
rail service.[103] A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Louisville 41st most 
walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.[104] Electricity is provided to 
the Louisville Metro area by Louisville Gas & Electric. Water is provided 
by the Louisville Water Company, which provides water to more than 800,000 
residents in Louisville as well as parts of Oldham and Bullitt counties. 
Additionally, they provide wholesale water to the outlying counties of 
Shelby, Spencer and Nelson.[105] The Ohio River provides for most of the 
city's source of drinking water. Water is drawn from the river at two points: 
the raw water pump station at Zorn Avenue and River Road, and the B.E. 
Payne Pump Station northeast of Harrods Creek. Water is also obtained from 
a riverbank infiltration well at the Payne Plant. There are also two water 
treatment plants serving the Louisville Metro area: The Crescent Hill Treatment 
Plant and the B.E. Payne Treatment Plant. In June 2008, the Louisville 
Water Company received the "Best of the Best" award from the American Water 
Works Association, citing it as the best-tasting drinking water in the 
country.[106] Important events occurring in the city have included the 
first large space lighted by Edison's light bulb which occurred during 
the Southern Exposition. (At the time, in 1883, the largest such installation 
to date.) Also, Louisville had the first library open to African Americans 
in the South,[107][108] and medical advances including the first human 
hand transplant[92] and the first self-contained artificial heart transplant.[93] 
Louisville has nine sister cities as of 2012:[109][110][111] In addition, 
Leeds has been recognized as a "friendship city". The two cities have engaged 
in many cultural exchange programs, particularly in the fields of nursing 
and law, and cooperated in several private business developments, including 
the Frazier History Museum.[112] On April 15, 2008, it was announced that 
Louisville would be twinned with the town of Bushmills in Northern Ireland. 
The two places share a tradition for the distilling of whiskey. The choice 
of Louisville came after a search of U.S. cities, followed by an online 
poll conducted for the public to decide between three finalists, which
