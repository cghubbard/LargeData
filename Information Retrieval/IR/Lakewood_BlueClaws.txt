The Lakewood BlueClaws are a minor league baseball team affiliated with 
the Philadelphia Phillies. They are based in Lakewood Township, New Jersey. 
They play in the Class A South Atlantic League. Their home field is FirstEnergy 
Park. The BlueClaws moved to Lakewood from Fayetteville, North Carolina, 
where they had been known as the Fayetteville Generals and later as the 
Cape Fear Crocs. Their first season in Lakewood was 2001. The Phillies' 
previous South Atlantic League affiliate was based in Kannapolis, North 
Carolina, and known as the Piedmont Boll Weevils from 1995 to 2000 (the 
team is now known as the Kannapolis Intimidators). Prior to that, the team 
was based in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Since their arrival in New Jersey, 
the BlueClaws have been a success at the gate. In each of their first five 
seasons, they averaged over 6,500 fans per game. On August 26, 2002, in 
a game against the Hickory Crawdads which the BlueClaws won 3–0, attendance 
was a South Atlantic League record 13,003. The BlueClaws have led the South 
Atlantic League in either average or total attendance every year, and became 
the fastest team in South Atlantic League history to reach the 2 and 3 
million fan attendance mark. On August 24, 2009, Phillies pitcher Brett 
Myers threw a scoreless inning in a rehab assignment on the same day a 
seven-year-old from Toms River, New Jersey became the 4 millionth fan in 
team history. This box office success comes in the absence of great success 
on the field. In their first five seasons, the BlueClaws failed to qualify 
for the playoffs. Their overall record topped the .500 mark for the first 
time in 2004. All told, in their first eight seasons, the BlueClaws have 
topped 10,000 fans at a game three times, most recently in 2010 when they 
retired Ryan Howard's #29. They have led the South Atlantic League and 
New Jersey in attendance in all 13 years of existence. Each season a group 
of fans choose one person on the BlueClaws to cheer for, and in 2008, these 
fans chose third baseman Travis "Moose" Mattair. These fans, who called 
themselves "Mooseketeers" in reference to Mattair's childhood nickname, 
cheered loudly for both Mattair and the team in general. They are known 
for displaying homemade signs and jerseys, and their novelty moose hats 
were a regular fixture at FirstEnergy Park throughout the 2008 season. 
On September 1, 2004, Ryan Howard became the first former BlueClaw to play 
in the major leagues, playing first base for the Phillies in a 7–2 loss 
to the Atlanta Braves at Citizens Bank Park. He played for the BlueClaws 
in the 2002 season. In 2005, he was named the National League Rookie of 
the Year, and in 2006 he was named the National League Most Valuable Player. 
In May 2007, while on the 15-day disabled list, Ryan Howard played two 
rehab games with the BlueClaws after suffering a hamstring injury. Each 
game drew over 8,000 fans and helped push the BlueClaws to a new team attendance 
record for the month of May. The 2008 World Champion Philadelphia Phillies 
featured several former BlueClaws on their roster. Former NL MVP Ryan Howard 
was with the BlueClaws in 2002. World Series MVP Cole Hamels was with Lakewood 
in 2003, and starting catcher Carlos Ruiz was a member of the original 
Lakewood BlueClaws roster, in 2001. The team offers a post-game fireworks 
show after every Friday home game, and at the ballpark, and seniors eat 
free every Tuesday night. Thursday nights are "Thirsty Thursdays", with 
discounted beverages and live music all night. During the 2009 season, 
the BlueClaws announced that the team would adopt a new logo, color scheme, 
and uniforms for the 2010 season. The BlueClaws won the 2006 South Atlantic 
League Championship on September 15, first defeating the Lexington Legends 
in the Northern division final, two games to none, then defeating the Augusta 
GreenJackets in a dramatic 5–0 victory, winning the championship series 
three games to one. In 2009, the BlueClaws won the South Atlantic League 
Championship by first defeating the Kannapolis Intimidators 9–0 and winning 
the series by two games to none in the Northern Division final. In the 
championship round, the Blue Claws defeated the Greenville Drive 5–1 in 
game four and then taking the series three games to one. In 2010, the BlueClaws 
won both halves of the season. They became the first team to do so and 
win the championship, defeating Hickory 2 games to 1 in the Northern Division 
Final and the Greenville Drive 3 games to 1 in a rematch series. It was 
announced that the Phillies had extended their affiliation agreement through 
2014. Number 19, worn by Cole Hamels, and #29, worn by Ryan Howard, have 
been retired by the BlueClaws. The team is part-owned by New-Jersey-born 
Joe Plumeri. He is Vice Chairman of the First Data Board of Directors and 
he is part owner of the Trenton Thunder.[1][2][3] Pitchers Catchers Infielders
