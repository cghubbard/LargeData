John Timothy Flaherty (born October 21, 1967) is a television baseball 
broadcaster and a retired Major League Baseball player. Flaherty was a 
catcher, and last played in the major leagues for the New York Yankees.[1] 
Flaherty grew up in West Nyack, New York and graduated in 1985 from Saint 
Joseph Regional High School in Montvale, New Jersey. He went to grammar 
school at St. Anthony School in Nanuet, New York. He attended George Washington 
University, graduating in 1988, and he batted and threw right-handed. Drafted 
by the Boston Red Sox in 1988, he moved through the farm system and broke 
through with the Sox in 1992. He also played for the Red Sox in 1993, and 
in 1994 he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for Rich Rowland. In 1996, 
Flaherty had a 27-game hitting streak.[2] This ranks as the third-longest 
hitting streak of all time by a catcher, behind only Sandy Alomar, Jr.'s 
30-game streak and Benito Santiago's 34-game streak. In 1996, the Tigers 
traded Flaherty to the San Diego Padres, along with Chris Gomez, for Brad 
Ausmus, Andújar Cedeño, and a minor leaguer. In 1997, the Padres traded 
Flaherty to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for Andy Sheets and Brian Boehringer. 
He played as the Devil Rays' everyday catcher through the 2002 season. 
As a member of the Devil Rays, he earned notoriety for breaking up a Pedro 
Martínez no-hitter in the ninth inning.[3] In 2003, he signed as a free 
agent with the New York Yankees.[4] With the Yankees, he served as a back-up 
to regular catcher Jorge Posada. He is best known for a 2004 pinch-hit 
game-winning single that ended a 13 inning game against the Boston Red 
Sox. In the 2005 season, Flaherty developed a good working relationship 
with pitcher Randy Johnson, and was paired with Johnson for most of the 
pitcher's starts that season.[5] He rejoined the Red Sox in December 2005, 
but announced his retirement March 7, 2006 during spring training with 
the team.[6] Flaherty's career stats include a .252 batting average in 
1,047 games and 849 hits, including 80 home runs. Flaherty participated 
in the 67th annual Yankees Old-Timers' Day on June 23, 2013, the first 
time he played on Old-Timers' Day. He also appeared in 2014, 2015 and 2016. 
In 2011, Flaherty founded the Rockland Boulders, a member of Canadian American 
Association of Professional Baseball. They play their home games at their 
new 4,350-seat/16 suite Provident Bank Park in Rockland County, New York. 
Following his retirement, Flaherty joined the YES Network as a color analyst 
on Yankees telecasts. In addition to game commentary, Flaherty has also 
served the network as an analyst on the New York Yankees Pre-Game Show, 
Yankees Batting Practice Today, and the New York Yankees Post-Game Show. 
He has also appeared on the network's youth-oriented show Yankees on Deck.

John Flaherty was among the "Starting Nine" inducted into the Irish American 
Baseball Hall of Fame. On May 15, 2009, Flaherty was awarded an honorary
