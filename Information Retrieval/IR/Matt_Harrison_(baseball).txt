Matthew Reid Harrison (born September 16, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Texas Rangers. Harrison was born in Durham, North Carolina 
on September 16, 1985. He attended South Granville High School in Creedmoor, 
North Carolina. He had signed a letter of intent to play baseball at North 
Carolina State University, but was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 
third round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft and subsequently signed 
a professional contract.[1] Harrison made his professional debut with the 
Gulf Coast League's Gulf Coast Braves in 2003. He played in 2004 with the 
Danville Braves of the Appalachian League and in 2005 with the Rome Braves 
of the Single-A South Atlantic League. 2006 saw Harrison split time between 
the Single-A Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina League and the Double-A 
Mississippi Braves of the Southern League. He was named the Braves' Minor 
League Player of the Year, the Pelicans' Pitcher of the Year and was a 
Carolina League All-Star that season.[2] Entering 2007, Harrison was rated 
by Baseball America as the third-best prospect in the Braves organization 
and the seventh-best prospect in the Carolina League.[2] He began 2007 
with Double-A Mississippi, starting 20 games for the team, compiling a 
5–9 record with a 3.39 ERA and 78 strikeouts. On July 30, 2007, Harrison, 
along with catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, minor league pitchers Neftalí 
Feliz and Beau Jones, and shortstop prospect Elvis Andrus, were traded 
by the Braves to the Texas Rangers for Mark Teixeira and Ron Mahay.[3] 
Harrison missed the end of the 2007 minor league regular season due to 
shoulder inflammation.[4] He made his first appearance for the Rangers 
organization with the Surprise Rafters during the 2007 Arizona Fall League 
season, where he accounted for a perfect 5–0 record.[4] At the start of 
the 2008 season, Harrison was assigned to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders 
of the Texas League. On May 18, he threw a no-hitter against the San Antonio 
Missions, only the second no-hitter in RoughRiders' history.[5] After only 
nine appearances with Frisco, Harrison earned a promotion to the Triple-A 
Oklahoma RedHawks in June.[6] While in Oklahoma, he went 3–1, with a 3.55 
ERA in six appearances. As the middle of the 2008 season wore on, the Rangers 
pitching staff suffered a number of injuries, forcing the club to call 
up Harrison from Frisco on July 8.[7] He made his major league debut with 
the Rangers that day, beating the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 3–2, outdueling 
All-Star pitcher Joe Saunders in the process. On September 12, Harrison 
threw a complete game shutout in a 7–0 road victory against the Oakland 
Athletics.[8] This was the first shutout by a Rangers rookie left-hander 
in two decades. Harrison—one of 12 Rangers rookies to make their major 
league debuts in 2008[9]—finished out the season in the majors, ending 
up with a 9–3 record and a 5.49 ERA. In 2009, Harrison was limited to 11 
starts going 4-5 with a 6.11 ERA. In 2010, he was 3–2 with a 4.71 ERA, 
pitching in 37 games (6 of which he started).[10] With the Rangers finishing 
90-72, the team made the postseason but lost to the San Francisco Giants 
in the 2010 World Series. Harrison was 14–9, with a 3.39 ERA in 2011.[10] 
He started the game the Rangers won to clinch the AL West (Pitched 6 innings, 
gave up 1 run).[citation needed] Harrison won Game 4 Of the ALDS versus 
the Tampa Bay Rays. With that win Texas won the series and advanced to 
the ALCS. The Rangers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2011 World 
Series. 2012 became a good year for Harrison as he earned his first career 
All-Star selection. He went 18-11 with a 3.29 ERA in 32 starts. 2013 became 
a short-lived season for Harrison as he experienced back soreness. He was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list due to back stiffness on April 10, 2013. 
On April 20, 2013, Harrison underwent back surgery to repair a herniated 
disc. He underwent a second back surgery on May 2, 2013, which was season 
ending. In only 2 starts of the 2013 season, Harrison went 0-2 with an 
8.44 ERA. During the 2014 season, Harrison made only 4 starts going 1-1 
with a 4.15 ERA. On May 13, 2014, Harrison left the game with an apparent 
back injury, which landed him on the disabled list the following day. On 
June 3, 2014, Harrison underwent lumbar spinal disc fusion surgery, effectively 
ending his 2014 season. Most news affiliates projected that this surgery 
could end Harrison’s career playing any professional sport. Harrison started 
the 2015 season on the 60-day disabled list in an effort to continue recovery 
from his spinal fusion surgery. Sources projected that he could return 
by July or after the All-Star break. He made a start against the Yankees 
where he would experience more back pain which elected the Rangers to end 
his season. On July 31, 2015, Harrison was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies 
along with Nick Williams, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Alec Asher, and 
Jerad Eickhoff in exchange for Cole Hamels and Jake Diekman.[11][12] Harrison 
was released by the Phillies on November 15, 2016, having not thrown a 
single pitch for the organization.[13] Harrison is a sinkerballer, although 
he uses five pitches regularly. The 89–94 mph sinker is complemented by 
a four-seam fastball (90–94), a cutter (85–88), a curveball (77–80), and 
a changeup (80–83). The changeup is rarely used against left-handed hitters, 
as is the cutter against right-handed hitters. His changeup garnered a 
very effective 37% whiff rate in the first half of 2012.[14] Matt met his 
wife Meghan in 2002 while attending South Granville High School. They were 
married on December 13, 2008.[15] On December 14, 2011, the couple welcomed
