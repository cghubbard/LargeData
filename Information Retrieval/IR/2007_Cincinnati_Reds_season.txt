The Cincinnati Reds' 2007 season has been completed, and the Cincinnati 
Reds finished out of playoff contention. Following an 11–7 loss to the 
St. Louis Cardinals on July 1, general manager Wayne Krivsky fired manager 
Jerry Narron and named advance scout Pete Mackanin interim manager. It 
was the second managerial change of the day, following the resignation 
of Seattle Mariners skipper Mike Hargrove. The Reds won Mackanin's first 
game at the helm, 7–3 over the San Francisco Giants on the strength of 
a grand slam by Brandon Phillips. The season also included highlights such 
as the Red's 2004 first-round draft pick, Homer Bailey, and right-handed 
starting pitcher, making his MLB debut against the Indians on June 8. He 
pitched 5 innings, gave up 2 earned runs, struck out 3, and walked 4.[1]
