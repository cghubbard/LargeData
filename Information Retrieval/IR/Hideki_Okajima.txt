Hideki Okajima (岡島 秀樹, Okajima Hideki?, born December 25, 1975) is a former 
Japanese professional baseball pitcher. Okajima has pitched for the Yomiuri 
Giants, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, and Yokohama 
DeNA BayStars of Nippon Professional Baseball, and the Boston Red Sox and 
Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball. Okajima was elected to the 
2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game as a first time All-Star via the 
All-Star Final Vote.[1] He became the first Japanese-born pitcher to play 
in the World Series in Game 2 of the 2007 World Series. On July 18, 2016, 
Okajima announced his retirement. Okajima attended Higashiyama High School 
and pitched in the 1994 Koshien National High School Tournament.[2] Okajima 
was drafted in the third round in 1993 by the Yomiuri Giants of the Nippon 
Professional Baseball League. Okajima pitched mostly as a setup man, but 
sometimes played the role of a starter until 1999. When he played with 
the Giants in Japan, Okajima chose to go by the nickname "Okaji" instead 
of "Hideki" because Hideki Matsui had preceded him on the Giants.[3] Okajima 
became the team's closer in 2000–2001, before returning to his setup role 
in 2002. Okajima was traded to the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters right before 
the start of the 2006 season for two position players, and was a valuable 
lefty setup man for the team, pitching in 55 games, with a 2.14 ERA. The 
Fighters won the championship that year. In Japan, Okajima had a career 
record of 34–32 with a 3.36 ERA.[4] Okajima became a free agent in 2006, 
and signed a two-year, $2,500,000 deal with the Boston Red Sox.[5] The 
deal included a $1.75m club option for a third year. During spring training 
in 2007, Okajima was asked what he felt about being relatively anonymous 
while his teammate and countryman Daisuke Matsuzaka's every move was scrutinized. 
Okajima stated, "I'm willing to be a hero in the dark."[6] Okajima allowed 
a home run to John Buck on his very first pitch in the major leagues.[7] 
It was the 7th time in MLB history a pitcher gave up a home run on his 
first pitch.[8] However, Okajima then proceeded to hold opponents scoreless 
for nearly two months until the Yankees scored a run off of him via a fielder's 
choice on May 22.[9] At the start of the 2007 Red Sox season, injuries 
and poor performances limited the effectiveness of anticipated setup relievers 
Mike Timlin and Joel Piñeiro. Okajima stepped into the role of primary 
setup man for closer Jonathan Papelbon and quickly became one of the most 
dominant relievers in the major leagues. Through the first two months of 
the season, Okajima cemented himself as the top setup man in the Red Sox 
bullpen garnering the American League Rookie of the Month for April.[10] 
Okajima's scoreless streak from April to May 2007 was the longest by a 
Red Sox left-hander since Bruce Hurst 20 years prior.[11] Okajima earned 
his first MLB save on April 20, 2007, against the New York Yankees.[12] 
After getting a save in his first appearance during a Red Sox–Yankees series, 
Okajima compared the experience to winning the pennant.[13] For all of 
his early success, Okajima remained relatively anonymous in his forays 
around Boston. While Okajima was taking a cab ride with his wife to a local 
restaurant, his cab driver gushed about the amazing performance of the 
Red Sox's newly acquired lefty without knowing that the reliever was in 
the cab with him.[14] In Japan, Okajima was known as a gloomy man.[15] 
However, Okajima has revealed more of his humorous side in the United States. 
On May 17, 2007, Okajima faced the heart of the Detroit Tigers order for 
the second time in one day to earn his second major league save. When Japanese 
reporters asked him about facing the same three batters in both games of 
the doubleheader, he answered with a smile, "I did?"[16] Okajima made the 
All-Star team as the winner of the final vote, but did not play in the 
game; he is the third Red Sox player to make the team this way.[17] Following 
the All-Star break, Okajima continued to pitch solid and reliable relief 
innings occasionally closing games for the Sox as they held their place 
at the top of the AL East. However, the rigors of the MLB season began 
to catch up with Okajima in the later stages of the season and he began 
to struggle culminating in a career-high four-run meltdown in a game against 
the Yankees on September 14, 2007. Red Sox management decided to shut him 
down following this outing to allow Okajima to relieve the physical and 
mental fatigue of the longer American season.[18] On his return during 
the final stages of the regular season, Okajima regained his sharp early 
season form, pitching scoreless frames to establish himself again as an 
integral part of the dominant Red Sox bullpen as they headed into the postseason. 
He was selected to the 2007 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team. The 
selection was the result of the 49th annual Topps balloting of Major League 
managers.[19] Okajima's performance really returned in Game 2 of the World 
Series against the Colorado Rockies, in which he pitched 2⅓ perfect innings 
in relief of Curt Schilling, striking out four at Fenway Park. He became 
the first Japanese born pitcher to play in the World Series.[20] He closed 
the 2007 postseason with a home run to Garrett Atkins.[21] Okajima helped 
win the opening game in the MLB Japan Opening Series 2008.[22] On December 
3, 2010, he was non-tendered by the Red Sox, making him a free agent. However, 
both parties agreed on a one-year deal on January 2.[23] Okajima did not 
make the 2011 Opening Day roster, starting the season in Triple-A Pawtucket. 
On April 18, he was called up to the Red Sox. On May 20, 2011, Okajima 
was designated for assignment.[24] On May 24, 2011, Okajima cleared waivers, 
and he accepted his assignment to the Red Sox's AAA affiliate, the Pawtucket 
Red Sox.[25] The New York Yankees signed Okajima to a minor league contract 
on December 28, 2011. He also received an invitation to spring training. 
However, Okajima failed his physical at the beginning of spring training 
resulting in his release.[26] Okajima agreed to terms on a one-year contract 
with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks on February 26, 2012. He was granted his 
release from the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks on January 29, 2013 to pursue opportunities 
in MLB.[27] Okajima inked a minor league deal with an invitation to spring 
training pending a physical on February 11, 2013.[28] He was optioned to 
Triple-A to begin the 2013 season. He had a 2.16 ERA with 18 strikeouts 
and two walks in 16 2/3 innings during his tenure in Triple-A. He was called 
up to join the A's 25-man roster on May 17, 2013. He was designated for 
assignment on September 3, 2013. Okajima returned to Japan in 2014, signing 
a one-year contract with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. After the 2014 season 
Okajima considered returning to the MLB but instead chose to stay in Japan, 
signing with the Yokohama Bay Stars in December 2014.[29] Okajima signed 
a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles in February 2015. He was 
released on March 31, 2016. He retired on July 18, 2016. Okajima has a 
distinctive pitching form in which he turns his head downwards just before 
he releases the ball and after release jerks it hard towards third base. 
These extra movements appear to give Okajima some added velocity to his 
pitches as they torque his body towards home plate and reportedly disguise 
his pitches and cause batters to swing early. Okajima is said to have mimicked 
the pitching form of a pitcher in Yoichi Takahashi's manga Ace! who torqued 
his head so much after every pitch that his hat came flying off.[30] Okajima 
admits, "I was trying to copy the motion. I believed it would make me throw 
harder."[31] A part of the Japanese people dubbed this pitching form "Looking 
the Other Way" after a local version of the rock-paper-scissors game.[32] 
Initially, numerous coaches in Japan, such as Tsuneo Horiuchi, attempted 
to change Okajima's pitching form.[33] This all stopped, however, when 
pitching coach Yoshitaka Katori of the Yomiuri Giants accepted his pitching 
approach.[34] In the past, Okajima was prone to bouts of wildness — even 
being booed in his home park for his poor control.[35] After the 2005 season, 
Okajima was traded to the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters where he changed 
his pitching form and reestablished good control.[36] Okajima's pitches 
are of lower than average velocity, forcing him to develop a more consistent 
release point to better control them. His fastball is usually in the 85–89 mph 
range, rarely ever reaching 90 mph. His out pitch in Japan was his sharp 
rainbow curveball in the 70–75 mph range, which left-handed hitters find 
hard to hit. He also occasionally throws a circle changeup, a forkball 
in the 80–84 mph range and changeup usually 82–84 mph. After joining the 
Red Sox, Okajima displayed such pinpoint accuracy that former teammate 
Hideki Matsui of the New York Yankees was amazed because, since his time 
with Okajima in Japan, he never believed Okajima could gain such "great 
control".[37] Okajima's success in the major leagues against more than 
one batter in an outing was a departure from his time in Japan, where he 
was known as a situational lefty brought in to face one left-handed batter 
in key late-game situations.[38] During an April 15 rainout in 2007, Red 
Sox pitching coach John Farrell tweaked Okajima's changeup delivery. The 
result was a changeup with screwball motion dubbed the "Okie-Dokie" by 
bullpen coach Gary Tuck.[35] As of May 10, 2007, the Okie-Dokie had been 
thrown for strikes 79% of the time with hitters swinging through the pitch 
14 out of 30 times.[35] Detroit Tigers slugger Gary Sheffield declared 
Okajima "one of the most impressive lefties I've ever seen" with "stuff 
I have never seen before from anybody."[16] Former Yankees manager Joe 
Torre called Okajima "unhittable."[39] Okajima calls Masumi Kuwata his 
"master."[40] Okajima's wife is sports announcer Yuka Kurihara (栗原 由佳, 
Kurihara Yuka?),[41] with whom he has a son and a daughter.[2] He met his 
wife during a champagne/beer celebration after his Yomiuri Giants won the 
2000 Japan Series. Okajima's favorite films are romances including Ghost, 
Pretty Woman, and Autumn in New York.[42] Okajima ran the Honolulu Marathon 
on December 14, 2008, completing the run with a time of 6:10:26 (gun time).[43]
