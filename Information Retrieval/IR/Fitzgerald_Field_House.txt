-79.964149 Fitzgerald Field House is a 4,122-seat multi-purpose athletic 
venue on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
United States. Fitzgerald Field House is named for Rufus Fitzgerald, a 
past chancellor (1945–1955) of the university. It is the primary home competition 
venue for the university's gymnastics, volleyball, and wrestling teams. 
Fitzgerald Field House is the competitive venue for the Pitt varsity sports 
of volleyball, gymnastics, and wrestling. With an indoor track, the Field 
House also serves as the primary indoor facility for the university's track 
and field team, as well as housing the wrestling training facility and 
the primary training and weight facilities for Pitt's Olympic sports. In 
addition, it contains the offices and locker rooms for baseball, cross 
country, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, and tennis. The facility 
also has squash courts. The Field House is connected by an underground 
tunnel to Trees Pool and the Gymnastics Training Center, both located in 
Trees Hall. Built in 1951, Fitzgerald Field House was, for five decades, 
the home of Pitt's basketball program. The Field House provided a home 
court advantage that allowed the program to achieve a 414-175 (.703) record 
while utilizing the facility.[2] It also served as the home basketball 
court of Pitt's intracity rival, the Duquesne University Dukes, from 1956-57 
to 1963-64.[3] From 1984 until 2002, the Pitt men's basketball team also 
played selected Big East Conference and non-conference games at Mellon 
Arena.[4] Pitt's women's basketball team also used the Field House as their 
primary home court. Both the men's and women's Pitt basketball teams moved 
to the Petersen Events Center in 2002. In 1999, Fitzgerald Field House 
underwent a $3.8 million ($5.4 million today) in renovations of existing 
facilities and a major addition to the west side of the building for locker 
rooms, team dressing rooms, and training and equipment rooms.[5] In the 
summer of 2005, the wrestling training facility built in 1951 was reconstructed 
to be twice the size of the previous training facility and also received 
new floor and wall mats, a new ventilation system, new lighting, a video 
and recruitment room, and a balcony suspended above the mats featuring 
cardio equipment.[6] In addition, an Olympic sports weight room was added 
to serve as a primary training facility for over 300 Pitt student-athletes 
and includes Hammer Strength and Nautilus Next Generation machines, nearly 
8,600 pounds of free weights, and a comprehensive cardiovascular unit, 
including treadmills, stationary bikes and the Stairmaster Gauntlet.[7] 
The renovations and addition of the weight room reduced the seating capacity 
from the original 6,798 seats to a capacity of 4,122. Further renovations 
of the Field House in 2008 totaled $1.4 million ($1.5 million today) and 
included new volleyball courts and installation of seating and electronic 
equipment to meet NCAA requirements.[8][9] In November, 2011, the Nathan 
Hershey Athletic Training Facility was dedicated in the Field House.[10]
