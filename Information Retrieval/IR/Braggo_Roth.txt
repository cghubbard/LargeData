Robert Frank "Bobby" Roth (August 28, 1892 – September 11, 1936), nicknamed 
Braggo, was an American professional baseball player. He was an outfielder 
over parts of eight seasons in Major League Baseball with the Chicago White 
Sox, Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Athletics, Boston Red Sox, Washington 
Senators, and New York Yankees. Robert Frank Roth was born in Burlington, 
Wisconsin, on August 28, 1892. Roth's parents resided in Chicago, but vacationed 
in Burlington each summer at his mother's brother's house on the Fox River. 
Roth's brother, Frank, was fourteen years older than Bobby. He was a catcher 
in the major leagues between 1903 and 1910.[1] Braggo began his minor league 
career in 1910 with Green Bay of the Class-D Wisconsin–Illinois League.[1] 
After less than three months, Roth was released and he signed with the 
Red Wing Manufacturers of the Class-D Minnesota–Wisconsin League.[1] In 
1912, he played for the St. Joseph Drummers of the Western League. He played 
for the Kansas City Blues of the American Association in 1913 and 1914. 
Roth played third base for the first four years of his career, but was 
converted into an outfielder in 1914.[1] He also earned the nickname "Braggo" 
during the 1914 season due to his boastful attitude about hitting.[1][2] 
Roth made his MLB debut with the Chicago White Sox of the American League, 
when they purchased him from the Blues in August 1914. He was switched 
back to third base, but his playing time decreased in 1915 due to his poor 
defensive play and the acquisition of Eddie Murphy,[1] resulting in the 
White Sox trading Roth with a player to be named later (later decided to 
be Larry Chappell), Ed Klepfer and $31,500 to the Cleveland Indians for 
Shoeless Joe Jackson in August 1915.[1] Roth hit three home runs in the 
final week of the 1915 season to increase his season total to seven, one 
more than Rube Oldring.[1] Braggo struck out often, leading the American 
League in strikeouts in 1917, and finishing among the leaders four other 
times. However, he also drew decent numbers of walks for the times, with 
a lifetime .367 on-base percentage. He was several times among the stolen 
base leaders, finishing as high as second in the league in 1918. He led 
the league in hit-by-pitch in 1918 and was two other times among the leaders. 
With the Indians seeking pitching, they traded Roth to the Philadelphia 
Athletics for Larry Gardner, Charlie Jamieson and Elmer Myers before the 
1919 season.[1] However, Roth's loud personality clashed with the reserved 
Connie Mack, so Mack traded Roth with Red Shannon to the Boston Red Sox 
for Jack Barry and Amos Strunk in June 1919.[1] Before the 1920 season, 
the Boston Red Sox traded Roth and Shannon to the Washington Senators for 
Eddie Foster, Harry Harper and Mike Menosky. Roth slumped with the Red 
Sox, and after the season, he was traded by the Senators to the New York 
Yankees for Duffy Lewis and George Mogridge.[1] Roth missed a substantial 
portion of the 1921 season with a knee injury.[1] Before the 1922 season, 
Roth declared his knee fit for play,[3] but the Yankees released him due 
to his knee injury, which did not respond to treatment.[4] Roth played 
for the Blues and St. Paul Saints, also of the American Association, in 
1923. He surfaced again with the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League 
in 1928. Roth died in an automobile accident with a newspaper truck at
