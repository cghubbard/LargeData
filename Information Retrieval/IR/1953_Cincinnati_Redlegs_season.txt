The 1953 Cincinnati Redlegs season was a season in American baseball. The 
team finished sixth in the National League with a record of 68â€“86, 37 games 
behind the Brooklyn Dodgers. The team changed its name from "Reds" to "Redlegs" 
prior to this season in response to rampant American anti-communist sentiment 
during this time period. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches
