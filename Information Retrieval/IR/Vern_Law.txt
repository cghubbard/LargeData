Vernon Sanders "Vern" Law (born March 12, 1930) is an American former baseball 
pitcher who played sixteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. He played in 1950–51 and 1954–67. He batted and threw 
right-handed and was listed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and 195 pounds 
(88 kg).[1] Law signed for the Pirates as an amateur free agent in 1948 
and played for three of their minor league affiliates until 1950, when 
he was promoted to the major leagues.[1] Law was born on March 12, 1930 
in Meridian, Idaho. He was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates before the 
1948 season and spent 1948 and 1949 in the minor leagues.[1][2] Law made 
his major league debut for the Pirates in 1950. He played one season and 
then served in the military from 1951 to 1954. Upon returning the major 
leagues, eventually earned a spot in the Pirates' starting rotation, steadily 
demonstrating solid pitching abilities. He shared the NL Player of the 
Month award in August 1959 (4-0, 1.94 ERA, 25 SO) with Willie McCovey. 
In 1960, he had a win–loss record of 20-9 with a 3.08 earned run average. 
He led the National League in complete games, made the all-star team, and 
won the Cy Young Award that season. In the 1960 World Series, he won two 
games to help the Pirates defeat the New York Yankees.[1] His career was 
derailed by an injury to his ankle sustained on the bus trip on which the 
team was celebrating clinching the 1960 pennant. Law was forced to change 
his pitching style and pitched in pain for the rest of the season and the 
World Series. Because of his weak ankle, he tore some muscles in the back 
of his pitching shoulder during the Series. He thought the injury would 
heal over the winter, but he was not the same for several seasons.[3] He 
did manage to win the NL Comeback Player of the Year award in 1965, with 
a 17-9 record, and a 2.15 ERA in 29 games. He shared the NL Player of the 
Month award in June of that year (with Willie Stargell), with a 6-1 record, 
0.87 ERA, and 32 SO. After two more seasons, he retired in 1967. Law finished 
his career with a record of 162-147. He won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award 
in 1965 for his contributions both on and off the field.[1] Law was made 
an LDS deacon at the age of 12, became a teacher two years later and was 
ordained a priest at 17.[4] During his playing career, Law was tagged with 
the nickname "Deacon" by Pirate broadcaster Bob Prince. According to Law, 
it was given to him by former Pirate teammate Wally Westlake because he 
is a member of the ordained priesthood of the LDS Church. Law is the pitching 
coach for the Provo High School (PHS) varsity baseball team and is an active 
member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He currently 
lives in Provo, Utah. Law has been credited with saying, "A winner never 
quits and a quitter never wins" and "Experience is a hard teacher because 
she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards."[5] His son Vance Law
