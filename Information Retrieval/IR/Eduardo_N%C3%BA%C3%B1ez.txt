Eduardo Michelle Núñez Méndez (born June 15, 1987) is a Dominican professional 
baseball infielder for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He played in MLB for the New York Yankees from 2010 through 2013, 
and the Minnesota Twins from 2014 to mid-2016. Although shortstop is his 
primary position, Núñez serves as a utility infielder, and played in the 
outfield for the Yankees as well. The Yankees signed Núñez as an international 
free agent in 2004. He played minor league baseball in their organization 
from 2005 through 2010, until he made his MLB debut with the Yankees on 
August 19, 2010. He has served to allow Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez 
the ability to take days off in the field. Due to struggles and inconsistency, 
the Yankees designated Núñez for assignment at the start of the 2014 season. 
He was traded to the Twins, and enjoyed a breakout season in 2016, when 
he was named to appear in the MLB All-Star Game. He was traded to the San 
Francisco Giants on July 28, 2016. The New York Yankees signed Núñez as 
an international free agent in February 2004.[1][2] The organization introduced 
him to Derek Jeter, his childhood idol, at a press conference, where they 
told Jeter that Núñez was to be their eventual replacement for Jeter as 
the Yankees' starting shortstop.[3] Núñez made his professional debut in 
minor league baseball with the Staten Island Yankees of the Class A Short 
Season New York–Pennsylvania League in the 2005 season. Nunez represented 
the Yankees in the league's All-Star Game.[4] That season, the Yankees 
won their third consecutive league championship,[5] and Nunez was rated 
as the fourth-best prospect in the New York–Penn League.[6] Going into 
the 2006 season, Baseball America ranked Núñez the sixth-best prospect 
in the Yankees organization, and the prospect with the best throwing arm.[7] 
The Yankees started Núñez with the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced 
Florida State League in 2006; he struggled with Tampa,[8] and the Yankees 
demoted him to the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League 
(SAL) on May 17. Overall, Núñez had a .214 batting average for Tampa and 
Charleston.[9] In 2007, Núñez started the season with Charleston, and was 
named the starting shortstop for the Southern Division in the SAL All-Star 
Game.[9] He was promoted to Tampa on July 28. He played for Tampa in 2008, 
batting .271 with six home runs and 42 runs batted in (RBI) in 94 games.[2] 
He was promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League for 
the 2009 season. With Trenton, he had a .322 batting average in 123 games 
and appeared in the Eastern League All-Star Game,[1] in which he got two 
hits.[10] The Yankees promoted Núñez to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees 
of the Class AAA International League for the 2009 playoffs.[11] Following 
the 2009 season, the Yankees added Núñez to their 40-man roster to protect 
him from being selected by another franchise in the Rule 5 draft.[12] In 
2010, the Yankees assigned Núñez to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. There, he batted 
.289 in 118 games,[13] with 55 runs scored, 25 doubles, three triples, 
four home runs, 50 RBI, and 23 stolen bases.[14] He was named to the International 
League All-Star team,[1] the postseason All-Star team,[15] and the Topps 
Triple-A All-Star Team.[16] Núñez won the Kevin Lawn Award as the Yankees' 
minor league player of the year for 2010.[14][17] Núñez was called up to 
the majors for the first time on August 19, 2010 after Lance Berkman was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list.[18] Núñez debuted on the same day, 
replacing Jeter in the seventh inning and fouling out in his only plate 
appearance. Núñez received playing time as a fill-in for Jeter and the 
then-injured Alex Rodriguez. On August 21, Núñez recorded his first major 
league hit, a go-ahead RBI single into right field.[19] Núñez hit his first 
career home run against the Chicago White Sox on August 28, 2010. He also 
stole his first career base the same day.[20] In 30 games for the Yankees, 
Nunez hit .280, with one home run, seven RBIs, and scored 12 runs.[14] 
After the season, Baseball America rated him as the eighth-best prospect 
in the Yankees organization, while also naming him the "Best Defensive 
Infielder" and the "Best Infield Arm" in the Yankees organization.[14] 
Núñez was part of the Yankees postseason in case Jeter or A-Rod get injured 
again. The Yankees ventured through the playoffs until losing to the Texas 
Rangers in the 2010 ALCS. Núñez beat out Ramiro Peña for the role as the 
utility infielder to start the 2011 season.[21] With the Yankees, Núñez 
played approximately two games a week, allowing Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez 
to rest more often.[22] Núñez batted .339 while filling in for the Yankees 
as their starting shortstop for three weeks while Jeter was injured; he 
later became the team's starting third baseman when Rodriguez required 
arthroscopic knee surgery.[23] In addition to playing various infield positions, 
manager Joe Girardi also used Núñez as an outfielder when Nick Swisher 
experienced tendinitis in his elbow.[24] Núñez played in 112 games for 
the Yankees,[25] and led the team in errors with 20, despite only playing 
part-time.[26] Despite his defensive struggles, the Yankees viewed Núñez 
as likely to make their 25-man roster out of spring training in 2012 as 
a utility infielder.[27] With Brett Gardner, the Yankees' starting left 
fielder, injuring his elbow, Núñez received playing time in left field, 
as well as the infield.[28] In his first twenty games of the 2012 New York 
Yankees season, Núñez hit .294, but committed four errors in 58 chances. 
The day after he committed two errors in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, 
Núñez was demoted to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre team. The team 
decided to abandon their approach of using Núñez as a utility player so 
that he can receive daily playing time at shortstop and second base, as 
the organization still views him as an everyday shortstop.[29][30][31] 
On September 1, 2012, the Yankees promoted Núñez from Triple-A and manager 
Joe Girardi placed him into the starting lineup against the Baltimore Orioles 
for that day.[32] He finished the regular season with a .292 batting average 
in 82 at-bats.[33] Though he was left off of the Yankees' postseason roster 
for the 2012 American League Championship Series, he was added to the roster 
when Jeter suffered a fractured ankle.[34] In Game 3 of the 2012 ALCS, 
Núñez hit his first career postseason home run off of Tigers pitcher Justin 
Verlander.[35] The Yankees lost the series to the Tigers in a 4-game sweep. 
Heading into the 2013 season, Yankees' General Manager Brian Cashman said 
that if Núñez were to make the team, he would do so as a utility infielder, 
reversing the team's position.[33] However, Núñez only played shortstop 
during spring training. Jeter began the season on the disabled list, and 
Núñez started at shortstop for the Yankees on Opening Day. Núñez was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list on May 12 after missing the previous week due 
to soreness in his left rib cage.[36] He was then transferred to the 60-day 
disabled list due to a strained left oblique. He was activated from the 
disabled list on July 6 after missing 2 months.[citation needed] He ended 
the season with .a 260 batting average and 28 RBIs in 90 games played.[37] 
In spring training in 2014, Núñez competed with Zelous Wheeler, Yangervis 
Solarte, Dean Anna, and Scott Sizemore for a reserve infielder role with 
the Yankees.[38] With reserve infielder Brendan Ryan starting the season 
on the disabled list, the Yankees chose Anna and Solarte over Núñez.[39][40] 
To add Solarte to the roster, the Yankees designated Núñez for assignment.[41] 
With the hope of improving their offense,[37] the Minnesota Twins acquired 
Núñez from the Yankees on April 7, 2014, in exchange for minor league pitcher 
Miguel Sulbaran.[42] The Twins optioned him to the Rochester Red Wings 
of the International League.[43] After batting 7-for-22 (.318) for Rochester, 
he was promoted to the Twins as the 26th man on their roster for a doubleheader 
on April 17,[44] and was optioned back the next day. He finished the season 
with a .250 batting average in 72 games played with the Twins.[45] Núñez 
and the Twins agreed to a $1.025 million salary for the 2015 season, avoiding 
salary arbitration.[45] In 72 games in 2015, Núñez hit .282/.327/.431 with 
4 HR and 20 RBI across 4 positions for the Twins. Avoiding arbitration 
with the Twins at $1.475 million for the 2016 season, Núñez entered the 
season expecting to compete for a reserve role.[46] On the Twins Opening 
Day roster in 2016, Núñez impressed in April, hitting .373 in 18 games 
in a reserve role. However, following an injury to shortstop Eduardo Escobar, 
Núñez began earning more playing time as the team's starting shortstop.[47] 
With an injury to third baseman Trevor Plouffe, Núñez remained in the lineup 
following Escobar's return. He became the Twins' leadoff hitter. On July 
5, Núñez was named to his first All-Star Game.[48][49] On July 28, 2016, 
the Twins traded Núñez to the San Francisco Giants for left-handed minor 
league pitcher Adalberto Mejía.[49] Núñez was batting .296 with 12 home 
runs, 47 RBIs, and leading the American League in stolen bases with 27 
at the time of the trade to the Giants. The Yankees viewed Núñez as a possible 
replacement at shortstop for Jeter.[33] Though they were willing to trade 
Jesús Montero, their top hitting prospect, the Yankees considered Núñez 
untouchable in trade negotiations. Scouts consider Núñez's throwing arm 
to be strong, and compliment his ability to hit for average, hit for power, 
and baserunning ability. However, scouts feel he can get "lackadaisical 
in the field" and swings at too many pitches outside of the strike zone.[50]
