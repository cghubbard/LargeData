Gilbert James "Gil" McDougald (May 19, 1928 – November 28, 2010) was an 
American Major League Baseball (MLB) infielder who spent ten major league 
seasons playing for the New York Yankees from 1951 through 1960. McDougald 
was the 1951 American League (AL) Rookie of the Year. He was an All-Star 
for five seasons, and was a member of eight American League pennant-winning 
teams and five World Series champion teams. He was known for hitting a 
line drive that severely injured pitcher Herb Score's right eye during 
a game in 1957. McDougald was born in San Francisco, the younger of two 
sons born to William James McDougald and his wife, the former Ella McGuire. 
He attended Commerce High School, where he was an All-City basketball player. 
He did not make the varsity baseball team until his senior year. After 
graduation in 1946, he attended City College of San Francisco and the University 
of San Francisco. During this time, he played with the local Boston Braves 
feeder team, the Bayside Braves, where he adopted his unorthodox but effective 
batting stance. The Yankees signed him to a contract in the spring of 1948. 
He played for various minor league teams before being promoted to the big 
leagues in 1951. McDougald played his first major league game on April 
20, 1951. On May 3 of that year, he tied a major league record, since broken, 
by batting in six runs in one inning.[1] Later in the year, in the World 
Series, he became the first rookie to hit a grand slam home run in the 
Series. He narrowly beat out Minnie Miñoso in the voting for the 1951 American 
League Rookie of the Year. His entire major league career was spent on 
the New York Yankees. He was a versatile player, playing all the infield 
positions except first base: 599 games at second base, 508 games at third, 
and 284 at shortstop. He was an All-Star in 1952, 1956, 1957, 1958, and 
1959, playing in four of the six games that were played (two All-Star games 
were held in 1959). McDougald led all American League infielders in double 
plays at three different positions – at third base (1952), at second base 
(1955) and shortstop (1957). He was the double play leader at shortstop 
despite sharing time at the position with rookie Tony Kubek. On May 7, 
1957, McDougald, batting against Herb Score of the Cleveland Indians, hit 
a line drive that hit Score in the right eye. It caused Score to miss the 
rest of the 1957 and much of the 1958 season. While addressing reporters 
following the contest, McDougald said, "If Herb loses the sight in his 
eye, I'm going to quit the game." Score regained his vision and returned 
to pitching in the majors late in 1958.[2] Only two years before, McDougald 
was struck in the left ear during batting practice by a ball hit by teammate 
Bob Cerv. Though initially believed to be a concussion (he missed only 
a few games), McDougald soon lost the hearing in his left ear and later 
also in his right. He retired in 1960 at only age 32, though not directly 
because of his hearing loss.[3] In 1958, McDougald was given the Lou Gehrig 
Memorial Award, which is awarded annually by the Phi Delta Theta fraternity 
(to which Gehrig belonged) at Columbia University. His last appearance 
was in Game Seven of the 1960 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates; 
as a pinch runner in the top of the ninth, he scored on Yogi Berra's ground 
ball to tie the game at 9–9. The Pirates, however, won the Series on Bill 
Mazeroski's walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth. On December 9, 
1960, McDougald announced his retirement. McDougald said he made up his 
mind to retire during the World Series and that his inclusion by the Yankees 
on a list of players eligible to be selected in the 1960 Expansion Draft 
had nothing to do with his decision.[4] While with the Yankees, McDougald 
was a resident of Tenafly, New Jersey.[5] McDougald was the head baseball 
coach at Fordham University from 1970 to 1976. He resigned this position 
due to his worsening hearing loss, a result of being hit in the head by 
a line drive during batting practice in 1955. His hearing loss was somewhat 
restored by a cochlear implant he received during surgery at the New York 
University Medical Center in 1994.[6] McDougald later became a paid spokesperson 
for the implant manufacturer, Cochlear Americas. He also became a speaker 
at benefits for hearing organizations, and testified before Congress.[3] 
McDougald died of prostate cancer at his home in Wall Township, New Jersey, 
at the age of 82. He was survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Lucille
