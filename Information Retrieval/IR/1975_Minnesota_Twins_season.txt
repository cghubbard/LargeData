The 1975 Minnesota Twins finished 76-83, fourth in the American League 
West. Having released Harmon Killebrew during the off-season, owner Calvin 
Griffith devised "Harmon Killebrew Day" as a promotion for the slugger's 
return with his new club, the Kansas City Royals. On Sunday, May 4, DH 
Killebrew greeted the crowd of just 14,805 with a first-inning home run. 
In the fifth inning, Minnesota pitcher Jim Hughes hit Harmon with a pitch. 
Only one Twins player made the All-Star Game, second baseman Rod Carew. 
Only 737,156 fans attended Twins games, the lowest total in the American 
League. On August 22, Dave McKay debuted in the majors as the starting 
third baseman for the Twins. In his first at bat leading off the third 
inning, he homered off Detroit's Vern Ruhle. Only one other Twin had homered 
in his first at bat -- Rick Renick in 1968. The duo will be joined in history 
by Gary Gaetti (1981), Andre David (1984) and Eddie Rosario (2015), who 
homers on the first major-league pitch thrown to him. Carew won his fifth 
AL batting title with a .359 average. Three pitchers had double digit wins: 
Jim Hughes (16-14), Bert Blyleven (15-10), and Dave Goltz (14-14). [1]
