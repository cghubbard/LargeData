Edwin Douglas "Ed" Charles (born April 29, 1933) is a retired third baseman 
in Major League Baseball. A right-handed hitter, Charles played for the 
Kansas City Athletics (1962–67) and New York Mets (1967–69). Charles was 
originally signed by the Boston Braves in 1952. He spent eight seasons 
in the Braves' farm system in the still-segregated Deep South, during which 
he wrote poetry concerning baseball and racism. Due to the presence of 
longtime All-Star Eddie Mathews at third base, the Braves traded Charles 
to the Kansas City Athletics prior to the 1962 season with Joe Azcue and 
Manny Jiménez for Lou Klimchock and Bob Shaw.[1] In his rookie season of 
1962, Charles batted .288 with 17 home runs, 74 runs batted in and 20 stolen 
bases; the batting average, home runs and stolen bases would all be career 
highs. He was also named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Roster. Charles would 
retain his steady play for the Athletics over the next four seasons; in 
1963 he batted .267 with 15 home runs and a career-best 79 RBIs, and while 
his batting average fell to .241 in 1964 he still managed 16 home runs 
and 63 RBIs. Prior to the 1965 season, Athletics owner Charlie Finley moved 
the fences back in Municipal Stadium, and though Charles batted .269 that 
year and .286 in 1966, his combined home run total was 17—the same number 
he had hit in his rookie season. On May 10, 1967, the Athletics traded 
Charles to the New York Mets for Larry Elliot and $50,000. He would be 
the oldest regular on his new team. In 1968, he led the Mets in home runs 
with 15. In 1969, he shared third base duties with rookie Wayne Garrett 
as a member of the Miracle Mets team that unexpectedly won the World Series, 
after finishing dead last in five of its first seven seasons and 9th in 
a 10-team National League in the other two. That year, the Mets had trailed 
the Chicago Cubs by as many as 10 games in the National League East (both 
leagues had split into two divisions after expanding from 10 teams to 12) 
on August 13. On September 24, they clinched the division with a 6–0 victory 
over the St. Louis Cardinals, with Charles homering off Steve Carlton (his 
final Major League home run) and Donn Clendenon homering twice and Gary 
Gentry pitching a four-hitter for the victory. Charles played in four of 
the five games in the World Series, in which the Mets defeated the heavily 
favored Baltimore Orioles. After losing the first game, the Mets won the 
next four; Charles scored the winning run in Game Two on an Al Weis single 
in the ninth inning. He was the oldest of the "Miracle Mets" at age 36.[2] 
After the Series, Charles, whose nickname, "The Glider", came from his 
third base play and graceful base running, was unconditionally released 
by the Mets.[3] In his career he batted .263 with 86 home runs and 421 
RBIs in 1005 games played. Charles served as a scout for the Mets, and 
coached the Kingsport Mets. He worked with at-risk youth in group homes 
in The Bronx.[4] Ed Charles appears in the 2013 movie 42 (film), played 
by Dusan Brown. The scene depicts Charles' meeting with Jackie Robinson, 
when (after Jackie's train had long since departed) Charles dashed out 
and put his ear to the train tracks, enthusiastically declaring that he
