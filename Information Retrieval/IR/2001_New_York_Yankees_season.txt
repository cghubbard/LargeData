The New York Yankees' 2001 season was the 99th season for the Yankees. 
The team finished with a record of 95-65 finishing 13.5 games ahead of 
the Boston Red Sox. New York was managed by Joe Torre. The Yankees played 
at Yankee Stadium. Roger Clemens had sixteen straight wins, tying an American 
League mark shared by Walter Johnson, Lefty Grove, Schoolboy Rowe, and 
Smoky Joe Wood. Clemens would finish the season with the AL Cy Young Award 
and become the first pitcher to win six Cy Young Awards.[1] Another chapter 
was written in the story of the Yankee-Red Sox rivalry. On September 2, 
2001, Mike Mussina came within one strike of a perfect game before surrendering 
a bloop single to Carl Everett. This was Mussina's third time he has taken 
a perfect game to or beyond the 8th inning. Coincidentally, it would have 
been the 3rd perfect game in for the Yankees in a span of 4 seasons and 
could have been the 4th perfect game in franchise history. In the emotional 
times of September 2001 in New York City, following the September 11 attack 
on New York's World Trade Center, the Yankees defeated the Oakland A's 
three games to two in the ALDS, and then the Seattle Mariners, who had 
won 116 games, four games to one in the ALCS. By winning the pennant for 
a fourth straight year, the 1998–2001 Yankees joined the 1921–1924 New 
York Giants, and the Yankee teams of 1936–1939, 1949–1953, 1955–1958 and 
1960–1964 as the only dynasties to reach at least four straight pennants. 
The Yankees had now won eleven consecutive postseason series over a four-year 
period. However, the Yankees lost the World Series in a dramatic 7 game 
series to the Arizona Diamondbacks, when Yankee star closer Mariano Rivera 
uncharacteristically lost the lead – and the Series – in the bottom of 
the ninth inning of the final game. With the loss, this marked the second 
time in five years that a team lost the World Series after taking a lead 
into the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 (following the Cleveland 
Indians in 1997) and the first time since 1991 that the home team won all 
seven games of a World Series.[2][3] Despite the loss in the series, Derek 
Jeter provided one bright spot. Despite a very poor series overall, batting 
under .200, he got the nickname, "Mr. November", for his walk-off home 
run in Game 4, though it began October 31, as the game ended in the first 
minutes of November 1. In calling the home run, Yankees broadcaster Michael 
Kay said "See ya! See ya! See ya! A home run for Derek Jeter! He is Mr. 
November! Oh what a home run by Derek Jeter!" He said this after noticing 
a fan's sign that said "Mr. November". Also, during the emotional times 
following the attacks, Yankee Stadium played host to a memorial service, 
just before the Yankees played their first home game following the attacks. 
The service was titled "Prayer for America". [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
