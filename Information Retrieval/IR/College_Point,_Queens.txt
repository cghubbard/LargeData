College Point is a working-middle-class neighborhood in the New York City 
borough of Queens. It is located north of Flushing on Flushing Bay and 
the East River also part of the Queens Community Board 7.[3] Willets Point 
Boulevard and the Whitestone Expressway are often the neighborhood's approximate 
boundaries with Flushing and Whitestone, respectively; College Point also 
borders Willets Point at the Flushing River at the extreme southwest corner. 
The 109th Precinct of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) serves 
College Point.[4] College Point is a diverse community, mostly residential 
with some industrial areas. College Point was named for St. Paul's College, 
a seminary founded in 1835 by the Rev. William Augustus Muhlenberg.[5][6] 
The college closed around 1850. Former names include Lawrence's Neck, Tew's 
Neck, Flammersberg, and Strattonsport. The original European settler of 
this area was Captain William Lawrence.[7] He was also the largest land 
holder of the original incorporators of the Town of Flushing, now in Queens. 
He arrived in America on the ship Planter in the 1630s. He married the 
oldest daughter of Richard "Bull Rider" Smith, who founded Smithtown on 
Long Island. With his first wife he had a son, William Jr., who married 
the Smiths' youngest daughter. In 1854 the German-American industrialist, 
Conrad Poppenhusen arrived, already a prosperous manufacturer in Brooklyn 
of hard rubber goods, expanded his operation to this small farming community. 
College Point became a factory town primarily for his workers, most of 
them German immigrants like himself, and the tycoon became a philanthropist 
contributing to churches, libraries, and the Poppenhusen Institute, an 
educational beacon of College Point.[8] He is responsible for the first 
free kindergarten in America. He connected College Point to Flushing by 
the Flushing and North Side Railroad, later called Whitestone Branch. A 
monument on College Point Boulevard, one of the main streets in College 
Point, stands testament to Poppenhusen.[9] College Point became a center 
for breweries and day trip resorts, and in the 1920s shifted towards airplane 
parts manufacturing. In 1997, the Queens Historical Society bestowed a 
"Queensmark" award on College Point, in hopes of encouraging historical 
preservation of local landmark architecture.[10] Based on data from the 
2010 United States Census, the population of College Point was 24,275, 
an increase of 2,868 (13.4%) from the 21,407 counted in 2000. Covering 
an area of 1,148.84 acres (464.92 ha), the neighborhood had a population 
density of 21.1 inhabitants per acre (13,500/sq mi; 5,200/km2).[1] The 
racial makeup of the neighborhood was 32.0% (7,757) White, 2.3% (551) African 
American, 0.1% (26) Native American, 27.9% (6,774) Asian, 0.0% (2) Pacific 
Islander, 0.4% (97) from other races, and 1.7% (402) from two or more races. 
Hispanic or Latino of any race were 35.7% (8,666) of the population.[2] 
MTA Regional Bus Operations provides public bus service to College Point 
via the Q20A/B, Q25, Q65, and Q76 lines. No New York City Subway lines 
have ever been built to the area, although a spur from the IRT Flushing 
Line was proposed during much of the early 20th century. The Long Island 
Rail Road's Whitestone Branch used to run near the area. Public elementary 
schools, defined as kindergarten through 5th grades, include PS 29 and 
PS 129. College Point is home to St. Fidelis Parish, founded in 1856. The 
present church was completed in 1906. Adjacent to the church is the grave 
of Father Huber, the founding pastor. For over 150 years, the parish conducted 
an elementary school including kindergarten through 8th grades. In 1924, 
St. Fidelis School, a three story building of 18 classrooms, opened its 
doors on the present 14th Avenue and 124th Street. In 1961, the 12 classroom 
annex was opened. During most of these years, it was staffed by the Dominican 
Sisters of Amityville (Dominican Sisters of the American Congregation of 
the Holy Cross). Due to significant demographic changes in College Point, 
the elementary school was finally closed in June 2013. St. Agnes Academic 
High School, a private Catholic high and independent of St. Fidelis parish, 
has been operating for over one hundred years. In its early years, it was 
very briefly co-educational, but is now restricted to girls. It is owned 
and still staffed by the Dominican Sisters of Amityville, assisted by lay 
men and women. The Dominican Sisters reside in Saint Agnes Convent as well 
as the Harbor of Grace Convent, which was the original convent for this 
community. College Point is also home to St. John's Lutheran School, another 
elementary program. St. Fidelis Roman Catholic Church,[17] St. Paul's Episcopal, 
St. John's Lutheran, and The First Reformed Church of College Point host 
the community's four largest congregations. A large, new New York City 
Police Academy campus is being built at 20th Avenue and College Point Boulevard.[18]
