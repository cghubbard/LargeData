James Patrick "Jim" Edmonds (born June 27, 1970) is an American former 
center fielder in Major League Baseball and a current broadcaster for Fox 
Sports Midwest. He played for the California/Anaheim Angels, St. Louis 
Cardinals, San Diego Padres, Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers, and Cincinnati 
Reds. Known for his defensive abilities – particularly his catches – Edmonds 
also was a prolific hitter, batting .284 with 393 home runs and an on-base 
plus slugging percentage (OPS) of .903. He is affectionately known by Cardinal 
fans as "Jimmy Baseball" [1] and "Jimmy Ballgame".[2] Edmonds was born 
on June 27, 1970 in Fullerton, California. He attended Diamond Bar High 
School in Diamond Bar, in eastern Los Angeles County. Edmonds has two daughters, 
Lauren and Hayley, with his first wife Lee Ann Horton. Edmonds and second 
wife Allison Jayne Raski were married on July 16, 2008, at the St. Louis 
County, Missouri Courthouse in Clayton, Missouri and the couple divorced 
in January 2014. The couple have two children: a son (Landon James) and 
a daughter (Sutton Jayne). Edmonds married Meghan O'Toole King (his third 
marriage) in St. Louis on October 24, 2014. His wife, Meghan, joined the 
cast of Real Housewives of Orange County in 2015. Edmonds himself also 
appears on the show.[3] In September 2013, Jim Edmonds 15 Steakhouse closed 
in St. Louis, of which he was a 50 percent owner and it was named for his 
jersey number.[4] In December 2013, Edmonds and his business partner Mark 
Winfield, reopened the F15teen space as a restaurant called The Precinct.[5] 
The restaurant was dubbed "the safest bar in town" and also the "home of 
the hottest wings". The former claim, like the name of the restaurant itself, 
was a bid to become the hangout of choice of city cops once they moved 
into their new headquarters just around the corner. Police-themed memorabilia 
shared space on the walls with framed Cardinals jerseys and flat-screen 
TVs. In May 2015, The Precinct closed.[6] Edmonds and Winfield continue 
to partner in the restaurant business with the opening of Winfield's Gathering 
Place in Kirkwood, Missouri as a BBQ-style restaurant. It does not promote 
Edmonds’ celebrity brand. In fact, there are no Edmonds, Cardinals or other 
sports memorabilia although there are televisions in both the dining room 
and the bar area for watching games.[7] Edmonds was selected in the seventh 
round of the 1988 draft by the California Angels. Following the draft, 
he was assigned to the Bend Bucks (in Bend, Oregon), the Angels' A-Short 
Season affiliate in the Northwest League. In 1988, he played in 35 games 
for the Bucks and hit .221. The following year, he was promoted to the 
Quad Cities Angels, the team's Class-A affiliate in the Midwest League. 
He played in 31 games and hit .261. In 1990, Edmonds advanced to the Palm 
Springs Angels, a "High-A" team in the California League. He played 91 
games and hit .293. He remained with Palm Springs for the 1991 season as 
well. In 1992, he was promoted to Double-A with the Midland Angels in the 
Texas League. He hit .313 in 70 games for Midland. He was promoted again 
in 1992, moving up to Triple-A Edmonton Trappers for 50 games. The Angels 
changed Triple-A teams in 1993, so Edmonds played for Vancouver Canadians. 
Edmonds was traded from Anaheim to St. Louis for second baseman Adam Kennedy 
and pitcher Kent Bottenfield shortly before the beginning of the 2000 season. 
Throughout his career, Edmonds predominantly played center field. However, 
he played first base in stretches, usually as a result of injury to a starting 
first baseman, but sometimes simply to provide rest to regular position 
players, or to give another outfielder playing time. For instance, Edmonds 
made six starts at first when Albert Pujols suffered an oblique injury 
in June 2006. Additionally, he pitched two innings while in High-A ball 
in 1991. Edmonds hit 30 or more home runs in five seasons, while maintaining 
a .285 career batting average, and knocked in 1,199 runs in his career. 
He also received eight Gold Glove Awards in his career at center field, 
most of them coming as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals. Three of Edmonds's 
most spectacular defensive plays came while on the Cardinals and the Angels. 
On June 10, 1997, while playing center field for the Anaheim Angels, Edmonds 
ran straight back towards the center field wall of Kauffman Stadium in 
Kansas City, and dove outstretched for a fly ball over his head, making 
the catch on the warning track. His other memorable catch came when on 
the St. Louis Cardinals on July 16, 2004, while covering center field against 
Reds batter Jason LaRue. LaRue hit a deep shot to center field that surely 
would have been enough to be a home run. On a dead run, Edmonds scaled 
the wall, reached his entire right arm over the fence, and caught the ball. 
During the 2004 NLCS against the Houston Astros, Edmonds made a diving, 
game-saving catch. The 2004 season was Edmonds' best season. He hit .301, 
had a .643 slugging percentage, 42 HRs, and 111 RBI; all but batting average 
were career highs. As a result, he earned a Silver Slugger Award, a Gold 
Glove Award, and was fifth in the voting for the Most Valuable Player Award. 
A defining moment of Edmonds' career came in the 2004 National League Championship 
Series, in which Edmonds hit an extra-inning home run to win Game 6. In 
Game 7, Edmonds made a spectacular defensive play in center, helping the 
Cardinals win the pennant. During a Chicago Cubs-Cardinals game at Wrigley 
Field on July 19, 2004, pitcher Carlos Zambrano was ejected from the game 
for throwing at Edmonds. Zambrano screamed at Edmonds as he rounded the 
bases on a home run, earning Zambrano a five-game suspension.[8] Edmonds, 
along with Albert Pujols and Scott Rolen, earned the nickname "MV3" for 
their phenomenal 2004 seasons. Edmonds was on the cover of video game MLB 
Slugfest 2004. On Mother's Day, May 14, 2006, Edmonds was one of more than 
50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. 
In 2006, Edmonds helped the St. Louis Cardinals win their first World Series 
title since 1982 while contributing 4 RBI. In his last two seasons in St. 
Louis (2006 and 2007), Edmonds struggled with post-concussion syndrome, 
which caused dizziness and blurred vision.[9][10] On December 14, 2007, 
Edmonds was traded to the San Diego Padres in exchange for prospect David 
Freese. As part of the deal, the Cardinals also agreed to pay part of Edmonds' 
2008 salary.[11] Edmonds' 241 home runs with the Cardinals are the fourth-most 
in franchise history.[12] On May 9, 2008, the Padres released him after 
hitting only .178 with one home run in 90 at bats. On May 14, 2008, the 
Chicago Cubs, in need of a left-handed bat, signed Edmonds to a one-year 
contract of which the Cubs were only responsible for the league minimum. 
He started the next day against his former team, the Padres, and went 1 
for 4. Edmonds was not well received initially by the fans in Chicago, 
but after joining the Cubs, he hit over .300 with 8 home runs in his first 
six weeks. On June 21, 2008, Edmonds hit two home runs in the fourth inning 
against the Chicago White Sox. He also had two other multi-homer games 
as a Cub: one on July 31, 2008 against the Milwaukee Brewers and one on 
August 8, 2008 against his former team, the St. Louis Cardinals. Edmonds 
did not play in 2009, sitting out because he did not receive what he or 
his agent considered a good offer.[9] In January 2010, he announced his 
intention to return to the majors.[13] On January 28, Edmonds signed a 
minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers. The Brewers added him to 
the major league roster on March 25.[14] At that time, he said, "last year 
was a mistake, I should have played somewhere."[9] On August 9, 2010, Edmonds 
was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Chris Dickerson. Both 
Edmonds and Dickerson had to clear waivers because the non-waiver Trade 
Deadline had already passed.[15] On February 4, 2011, Edmonds signed a 
minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals;[16] however, after 
continuing symptoms from a strained Achilles tendon suffered during the 
2010 season, Edmonds officially announced his retirement from baseball 
on February 18, 2011.[17] On March 14, 2013, Fox Sports Midwest announced 
the hiring of Jim Edmonds as a member of their St. Louis Cardinals broadcasting 
crew.[18] Edmonds will work as an analyst during Cardinals Live pre-game 
and post-game broadcasts. He replaces former Cardinal pitcher Cal Eldred, 
who had served in the same role for FSM since 2009. Eldred now works as 
a special assistant in the Cardinals organization.[18] Since retiring from 
baseball Edmonds has remained in the St. Louis area and owns a local restaurant. 
He has expressed a desire to one day be a part of the Cardinals ownership 
group.[19] Edmonds' fielding ability has earned him recognition from Major 
League coaches and managers, who voted him a Rawlings Gold Glove winner 
eight times in nine seasons from 1997 to 2005. ESPN's Rob Neyer lists Edmonds 
as #12 of the top 100 players of the first decade of the 21st century due 
to his productivity at the plate and gold-glove skills in center field.[20] 
On August 8, 2014, Edmonds was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall 
of Fame. He was announced as a candidate for the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame and Museum on November 9, 2015, but was removed from the ballot 
on January 6, 2016 after only receiving 2.5% of the vote in his first year
