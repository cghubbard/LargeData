The Newark Bears were a team in the International League, beginning in 
1917 at the Double-A level. They played in the International League through 
the 1949 season, except for 1920 and part of the 1925 season.[1][2] In 
the Bears' last four seasons in the International League (1946–1949), they 
were a Triple-A team, the highest classification in minor league baseball. 
They played their home games at Ruppert Stadium in what is now known as 
the Ironbound section of Newark; the stadium was demolished in 1967. Players 
in the Bears' early years who had Major League careers include Eddie Rommel, 
who pitched for the International League Newark Bears in 1918 and 1919.[3] 
Harry Baldwin played three seasons for the Newark Bears (1921–1923) before 
playing for the New York Giants.[4] Fred Brainard, who also played for 
the New York Giants 1914–1916, later played for the Newark Bears between 
1922–1924 and was the Bears' player-manager in 1923 and 1924. Other former 
Major League players who managed the Newark Bears include Hall of Fame 
members Walter Johnson in 1928 and player-manager Tris Speaker in 1929–1930.[5] 
Newark was a hotbed of minor league baseball from the time of the formation 
of the Newark Indians in 1902, and the addition of the Newark Eagles of 
the Negro National Leagues in 1936. A Federal League team, the Newark Peppers, 
played in 1915. in 1931 Jacob Ruppert bought the Newark Bears who played 
at Ruppert Stadium in Newark, New Jersey, and begin building the farm system 
for the Yankees.[6] In 1937, as a farm club of the New York Yankees, the 
Bears featured one of the most potent lineups in baseball, including Charlie 
Keller, Joe Gordon, Spud Chandler and George McQuinn, among others. They 
won the pennant by 25½ games to become known as one of the greatest minor 
league teams of all time.[7][8] Their legacy was ensured when, after trailing 
3 games to 0, they won the last four games against the Columbus Red Birds 
of the American Association to capture the Junior World Series. Following 
the 1949 season, the Bears moved to Springfield, Massachusetts. Their departure, 
and the folding of the Eagles a year later, left Newark without professional 
baseball for nearly 50 years, until the formation of the Atlantic League 
Bears (see above). One of the Bears' players, veteran pitcher George Earl 
Toolson, was reassigned by the Yankees to the AA Binghamton Triplets for 
the 1950 season. He refused to report and sued, challenging baseball's 
reserve clause in Toolson v. New York Yankees, which went all the way to 
the U. S. Supreme Court. The justices upheld the clause and baseball's 
antitrust exemption, 7-2. The Bears won the Governors' Cup, the championship
