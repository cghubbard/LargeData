The 1987 Chicago Cubs season was the 116th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 112th in the National League and the 72nd at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished sixth and last in the National League East with a record of 76–85, 
18½ games behind the division and pennant-winning St. Louis Cardinals. 
The team opened camp in Mesa, Arizona, apparently content with Brian Dayett 
to start in right field.[citation needed] However, Andre Dawson and his 
agent Dick Moss showed up after camp opened hoping that Green would consider 
signing the all-star outfielder.[citation needed] Dawson was one of the 
top free agents on the market during the off-season, but he garnered little 
interest. He made no secret that he wanted to leave Montreal, where his 
knees were battered by the Olympic Stadium Astroturf.[citation needed] 
He also made it known during the off season that the Cubs were his top 
choice, as Wrigley Field had a natural grass surface and had no lights.[citation 
needed] Dawson hit considerably better during the day.[citation needed] 
After a couple weeks of Green saying he was flatly uninterested in Dawson, 
Dawson and Moss presented Green with a "blank" signed contract. Green filled 
in the amount -- $500,000 for one year. Spring training also began with 
the dark news of broadcaster Harry Caray suffering a stroke in Palm Springs. 
WGN announced that until Caray was well enough to return, guest announcers 
would fill in and sit alongside color analyst Steve Stone.[1] The 1987 
season featured a career year from free-agent acquisition Andre Dawson, 
who captured National League Most Valuable Player honors following a 49-home 
run season. It was also the rookie season for starting pitcher Greg Maddux, 
the final full season for Wrigley Field without lights, and the last year 
for general manager Dallas Green, who resigned in late October 1987. An 
18–10 May propelled the Cubs into the race, and they spent time in first 
place in early June. However, injuries to Ryne Sandberg and Shawon Dunston 
within days of each other crippled the Cubs' middle infield and hampered 
their offense. Their replacements were Paul Noce and Mike Brumley, respectively, 
Brumley having been acquired as "thrown-in" in the 1984 Buckner-for-Eckersley 
trade. Neither player was able to come close to replacing the lost production 
from Sandberg and Dunston and, consequentially, the team struggled. In 
the month of August, two incidents occurred in which players cheated against 
the Cubs. Phillies pitcher Kevin Gross was pitching against the Chicago 
Cubs on Aug 10, 1987. Gross was caught with sandpaper in his glove and 
suspended for 10 games.[7] Astros batter Billy Hatcher was batting against 
the Chicago Cubs on Aug 31, 1987, when he broke his bat and it flew down 
the third base line. Cubs third baseman Keith Moreland saw cork, and Hatcher 
was suspended for 10 games.[7] Later on, Hatcher claimed that he was using 
pitcher Dave Smith's bat, and not his own. After a woeful August, Michael 
told the press that he was planning on resigning after the season. Green 
said that he would accept the resignation, effective immediately, and replaced 
Michael with Frank Lucchesi, a longtime scout in the Philadelphia organization 
who had become a Cubs roving instructor. As the Cubs played out the string 
under Luchessi, they finished last, although they were a markedly improved 
team over the '86 club, with a promising future. Infielders Coaches Note:
