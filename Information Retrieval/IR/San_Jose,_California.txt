San Jose (/ˌsæn hoʊˈzeɪ/; Spanish for Saint Joseph), originally Pueblo 
de San José de Guadalupe and officially the City of San José, is the third-largest 
city by population in California, the tenth-largest by population in the 
United States,[14] and the county seat of Santa Clara County. San Jose 
is the largest city within the Bay Area and the largest city in Northern 
California. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the area around San Jose 
was inhabited by the Ohlone people. San Jose was founded on November 29, 
1777, as San José de Guadalupe, the first civilian town in the Spanish 
colony of Alta California.[15] The city served as a farming community to 
support Spanish military installations at San Francisco and Monterey. When 
California gained statehood in 1850, San Jose became the capital.[16] After 
more than 150 years as a small farming community, the San Jose area in 
the mid-20th century contained some of the last undeveloped land near San 
Francisco Bay. It then began to experience rapid population growth, much 
of it coming from veterans returning from World War II. San Jose then continued 
its aggressive expansion during the 1950s and 1960s by annexing more land 
area. The rapid growth of the high-technology and electronics industries 
further accelerated the transition from an agricultural center to an urbanized 
metropolitan area. By the 1990s, San Jose's location within the booming 
local high tech industry earned the city the nickname "Capital of Silicon 
Valley". San Jose is now considered to be a global city,[17] and notable 
for its affluence[18][19][20][21] and high cost of living.[22] The U.S. 
Census Bureau estimated the population of the city to be 1,015,785 as of 
July 1, 2014.[23] Spanish Empire 1777–1821 First Mexican Empire 1821–1823 
United Mexican States 1823–1848 California Republic 1846  United States 
1848–present Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by several 
groups of Ohlone Native Americans.[24] The first lasting European presence 
began with a series of Franciscan missions established from 1769 by Junípero 
Serra.[25] On orders from Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa, Spanish Viceroy 
of New Spain, San Jose was founded by Lieutenant José Joaquín Moraga as 
Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe (in honor of Saint Joseph) on November 
29, 1777, to establish a farming community. The town was the first civil 
settlement in Alta California[26] In 1797, the pueblo was moved from its 
original location, near the present-day intersection of Guadalupe Parkway 
and Taylor Street, to a location in what is now Downtown San Jose. San 
Jose came under Mexican rule in 1821 after Mexico broke with the Spanish 
crown. It then became part of the United States, after it capitulated in 
1846 and California was annexed.[24] On March 27, 1850, San Jose became 
the second incorporated city in the state (after Sacramento), with Josiah 
Belden its first mayor. San Jose was California's first State capital, 
and hosted the first and second sessions (1850–1851) of the California 
Legislature. Today the Circle of Palms Plaza in downtown is the historical 
marker for the first state capital. The city was a station on the Butterfield 
Overland Mail route. In the period 1900 through 1910, San Jose served as 
a center for pioneering invention, innovation, and impact in both lighter-than-air 
and heavier-than-air flight. These activities were led principally by Prof. 
John Montgomery and his peers. The City of San Jose has established Montgomery 
Park, a Monument at San Felipe and Yerba Buena Roads, and John J. Montgomery 
Elementary School in his honor. During this period, San Jose also became 
a center of innovation for the mechanization/industrialization of agricultural 
and food processing equipment.[27] Though not affected as severely as San 
Francisco, San Jose also suffered much damage from the 1906 San Francisco 
earthquake. Over 100 people died at the Agnews Asylum (later Agnews State 
Hospital) after its walls and roof collapsed,[28] and the San Jose High 
School's three-story stone-and-brick building was also destroyed. The period 
during World War II was a tumultuous time. Japanese Americans primarily 
from Japantown were sent to internment camps, including the future mayor, 
Norman Mineta. Following the Los Angeles zoot suit riots, anti-Mexican 
violence took place during the summer of 1943. In 1940, the Census Bureau 
reported San Jose's population as 98% white.[29] As World War II started, 
the city's economy shifted from agriculture (the Del Monte cannery was 
the largest employer) to industrial manufacturing with the contracting 
of the Food Machinery Corporation (later known as FMC Corporation) by the 
United States War Department to build 1000 Landing Vehicle Tracked.[30] 
After World War II, FMC (later United Defense, and currently BAE Systems) 
continued as a defense contractor, with the San Jose facilities designing 
and manufacturing military platforms such as the M113 Armored Personnel 
Carrier, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and various subsystems of the M1 
Abrams battle tank.[31] IBM established its West Coast headquarters in 
San Jose in 1943 and opened a downtown research and development facility 
in 1952. Both would prove to be harbingers for the economy of San Jose, 
as Reynold Johnson and his team would later invent RAMAC, as well as the 
Hard disk drive, and the technological side of San Jose's economy grew.[32] 
The Ford Motor Company relocated its factory in Richmond to a new location 
in the suburb of Milpitas, called the San Jose Assembly Plant which was 
one of the primary locations for manufacturing the Ford Mustang. During 
the 1950s and 1960s, City Manager A. P. "Dutch" Hamann led the city in 
a major growth campaign. The city annexed adjacent areas, such as Alviso 
and Cambrian Park, providing large areas for suburbs. An anti-growth reaction 
to the effects of rapid development emerged in the 1970s championed by 
mayors Norman Mineta and Janet Gray Hayes. Despite establishing an urban 
growth boundary, development fees, and incorporations of Campbell and Cupertino, 
development was not slowed, but rather directed into already incorporated 
areas.[30] On April 3, 1979, the San Jose City Council adopted San José, 
with the diacritical mark on the "e", as the spelling of the city name 
on the city seal, official stationery, office titles and department names.[33] 
Also, by city council convention, this spelling of San José is used when 
the name is stated in both upper- and lower-case letters, but not when 
the name is stated only in upper-case letters. The accent reflects the 
Spanish version of the name, and the dropping of accents in all-capital 
writing was typical in Spanish. While San José is commonly spelled both 
with and without the acute accent over the "e," the City's official guidelines 
indicate that it should be spelled with the accent most of the time and 
sets forth narrow exceptions such as when the spelling is in URLs, when 
the name appears in all capital letters, when the name is used on social 
media sites where the diacritical mark does not render properly, and where 
San Jose is part of the proper name of another organization or business, 
such as San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce, that has chosen not 
to use the accent mark name.[34] The City's name without the accent can 
still be found in its 1965 Charter document, as amended, which formally 
chartered the municipality as City of San Jose.[35] Similarly, the City's 
website appears to use a mixture of both; for example, the "City of San 
José" in the text uses the mark but the "City of San Jose" logo image does 
not.[36] San Jose's position in Silicon Valley triggered further economic 
and population growth. Results from the 1990 U.S. Census indicated that 
San Jose surpassed San Francisco as the most populous city in the Bay Area 
for the first time.[37] This growth led to the highest housing costs increase 
in the nation, 936% between 1976 and 2001.[38] Efforts to increase density 
continued into the 1990s when an update of the 1974 urban plan kept the 
urban growth boundaries intact and voters rejected a ballot measure to 
ease development restrictions in the foothills. Sixty percent of the housing 
built in San Jose since 1980 and over three-quarters of the housing built 
since 2000 have been multifamily structures, reflecting a political propensity 
toward Smart Growth planning principles.[39] San Jose is located at 37°20′07″N 
121°53′31″W﻿ / ﻿37.335278°N 121.891944°W﻿ / 37.335278; -121.891944. According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 180.0 sq mi 
(466 km2), of which 3.4 sq mi (8.8 km2) (1.91%) is water. San Jose lies 
between the San Andreas Fault, the source of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, 
and the Calaveras Fault. San Jose is shaken by moderate earthquakes, above 
four on the Richter Scale, on average of one to two times a year. These 
quakes originate just east of the city on the creeping section of the Calaveras 
Fault, which is a major source of earthquake activity in Northern California. 
On April 14, 1984, at 1:15 pm, local time a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck 
the Calaveras Fault near San Jose's Mount Hamilton.[40] The most serious 
earthquake, in 1906, damaged many buildings in San Jose as described earlier. 
Earlier significant quakes rocked the city in 1839, 1851, 1858, 1864, 1865, 
1868, and 1891. The Daly City Earthquake of 1957 caused some damage. The 
Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 also did some damage to parts of the city. 
The other faults near San Jose are the Monte Vista Fault and the Hayward 
Fault Zone. The city is generally divided into the following areas: Downtown 
San Jose, Central, West San Jose, North San Jose, East San Jose, and South 
San Jose. Many of these regions were originally unincorporated communities 
or separate municipalities that were later annexed by the city. Besides 
those mentioned above, some well-known communities within San Jose include 
Japantown, Rose Garden, Sunol-Midtown, Willow Glen, Naglee Park, Burbank, 
Winchester, Alviso, East Foothills, Alum Rock, Little Portugal, Blossom 
Valley, Cambrian, Almaden Valley, Silver Creek Valley, Evergreen Valley, 
Edenvale, Santa Teresa, Seven Trees, Coyote Valley, and Berryessa. San 
Jose's urban sprawl was made by the design of "Dutch" Hamann, the City 
Manager from 1950 to 1969. During his administration, with his staff referred 
to as "Dutch's Panzer Division," the city annexed property 1389 times,[41] 
growing the city from 17 to 149 square miles (44 to 386 km2),[42] absorbing 
the communities named above, changing their status to "neighborhoods." 
They say San José is going to become another Los Angeles. Believe me, I'm 
going to do everything in my power to make that come true. Sales taxes 
were a chief source of revenue. Hamann would determine where major shopping 
areas would be, then would annex narrow bands of land along major roadways 
leading to those locations, pushing tentacles across the Santa Clara Valley 
and in turn walling off the expansion of adjacent communities.[44] During 
his reign, it was said the City Council would vote according to Hamann's 
nod. In 1963, the State of California imposed Local Agency Formation Commissions 
statewide, but largely to try to maintain order with San Jose's aggressive 
growth. Eventually the political forces against growth grew as local neighborhoods 
bonded together to elect their own candidates, ending Hamann's influence 
leading to his resignation.[45] While the job was not complete, the trend 
was set. The city had defined its sphere of influence in all directions, 
sometimes chaotically leaving unincorporated pockets to be swallowed up 
by the behemoth, sometimes even at the objection of the residents.[41]

the South Bay from the Pacific Coast) flowing north through San Jose, ending 
in the San Francisco Bay at Alviso. Along the southern part of the river 
is the neighborhood of Almaden Valley, originally named for the mercury 
mines which produced mercury needed for gold extraction from quartz during 
the California Gold Rush as well as mercury fulminate blasting caps and 
detonators for the U.S. military from 1870 to 1945.[46] East of the Guadalupe 
River, Coyote Creek also flows to south San Francisco Bay and originates 
on Mount Sizer near Henry W. Coe State Park and the surrounding hills in 
the Diablo Range, northeast of Morgan Hill, California. The lowest point 
in San Jose is 13 feet (4 m) below sea level at the San Francisco Bay in 
Alviso;[47] the highest is 2,125 feet.[48] Because of the proximity to 
Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton, San Jose has taken several steps 
to reduce light pollution, including replacing all street lamps and outdoor 
lighting in private developments with low pressure sodium lamps.[49] To 
recognize the city's efforts, the asteroid 6216 San Jose was named after 
the city.[50] San Jose lies close to the Pacific Ocean and close to San 
Francisco Bay (a small portion of its northern border touches the bay). 
Santa Clara Valley is the population center of the Bay Area, and like the 
hub and spokes of a wheel, surrounding communities emanate outwards from 
the valley. This growth in part, has shaped the greater Bay Area as it 
is today in terms of geographic population distribution and the trend of 
suburbanization away from the valley. There are four distinct valleys in 
the city of San Jose: Almaden Valley, situated on the south-west fringe 
of the city; Evergreen Valley to the south-east, which is hilly all throughout 
its interior; Santa Clara Valley, which includes the flat, main urban expanse 
of the South Bay; and the rural Coyote Valley, to the city's extreme southern 
fringe. San Jose, like most of the Bay Area, has a subtropical Mediterranean 
climate (Köppen Csb).[51] San Jose has an average of 301 days of sunshine 
and an annual mean temperature of 60.5 °F (15.8 °C). It lies inland, surrounded 
on three sides by mountains, and does not front the Pacific Ocean like 
San Francisco. As a result, the city is somewhat more sheltered from rain, 
giving it a semiarid feel with a mean annual rainfall of 15.82 in (402 mm), 
compared to some other parts of the Bay Area, which can receive about three 
times that amount. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from around 
50 °F (10 °C) in December and January to around 70 °F (21 °C) in July and 
August.[52] The highest temperature ever recorded in San Jose was 114 °F 
(46 °C) on June 14, 1961; the lowest was 19 °F (−7 °C) on December 22–23, 
1990. On average, there are 2.7 nights annually where the temperature lowers 
to or below the freezing mark, and 16 days where the high reaches or exceeds 
90 °F (32 °C). Diurnal temperature variation is far wider than along the 
coast or in San Francisco but still a shadow of what is seen in the Central 
Valley. With the light rainfall, San Jose and its suburbs experience about 
300 full or partly sunny days a year. Rain occurs primarily in the months 
from November through April or May. During the winter and spring, hillsides 
and fields turn green with grasses and vegetation, although deciduous trees 
are few. With the coming of the annual hot summer dry period, the vegetation 
dies and dries, giving the hills a golden cover, which unfortunately also 
provides fuel for frequent grass fires. Measurable precipitation falls 
in downtown San Jose on an average of 62 days a year. Annual precipitation 
has ranged from 6.12 in (155 mm) in 1953 to 32.57 in (827 mm) in 1983. 
The most precipitation in one month was 10.23 in (260 mm) in February 1998. 
The maximum 24-hour rainfall was 3.60 in (91 mm) on January 30, 1968. Although 
summer is normally quite dry in San Jose, a very heavy thunderstorm on 
August 21, 1968, brought 1.92 in (49 mm) of rain, causing some flooding.[53] 
The snow level drops as low as 2,000 ft (610 m) above sea level, or lower, 
occasionally coating nearby Mount Hamilton, and less frequently the Santa 
Cruz Mountains, with snow that normally lasts a few days. This sometimes 
snarls traffic traveling on State Route 17 towards Santa Cruz. Snow rarely 
falls in San Jose; the most recent snow to remain on the ground was on 
February 5, 1976, when many residents around the city saw as much as 3 in 
(7.6 cm) on car and roof tops. The official observation station measured 
only 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of snow.[54] Like most of the Bay Area, San Jose is 
made up of dozens of microclimates. Because of a more prominent rain shadow 
from the Santa Cruz Mountains, Downtown San Jose experiences the lightest 
rainfall in the city, while South San Jose, only 10 mi (16 km) distant, 
experiences more rainfall, and somewhat more extreme temperatures. In 2014, 
the U.S. Census Bureau released its new population estimates. With a total 
population of 1,015,785,[59] San Jose became the 11th U.S. city to hit 
the 1 million mark, even though it is currently the 10th most populous 
city. In 1930, Detroit had reached 1,568,662, but by 2000, it had dropped 
below 1,000,000. The 2010 United States Census[62] reported that San Jose 
had a population of 945,942. The population density was 5,256.2 people 
per square mile (2,029.4/km²). The racial makeup of San Jose was 404,437 
(42.8%) White, 303,138 (32.0%) Asian (10.4% Vietnamese, 6.7% Chinese, 5.6% 
Filipino, 4.6% Indian, 1.2% Korean, 1.2% Japanese, 0.3% Cambodian, 0.2% 
Thai, 0.2% Pakistani, 0.2% Laotian), 30,242 (3.2%) African American, 8,297 
(0.9%) Native American, 4,017 (0.4%) Pacific Islander, 148,749 (15.7%) 
from other races, and 47,062 (5.0%) from two or more races. Hispanic or 
Latino of any race were 313,636 persons (33.2%). 28.2% of the city's population 
were of Mexican descent; the next largest Hispanic groups were those of 
Salvadoran (0.7%) and Puerto Rican (0.5%) heritage. Non-Hispanic Whites 
were 28.7% of the population in 2010,[63] down from 75.7% in 1970.[29] 
The census reported that 932,620 people (98.6% of the population) lived 
in households, 9,542 (1.0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, 
and 3,780 (0.4%) were institutionalized. There were 301,366 households, 
out of which 122,958 (40.8%) had children under the age of 18 living in 
them, 162,819 (54.0%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 
37,988 (12.6%) had a female householder with no husband present, 18,702 
(6.2%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 16,900 (5.6%) 
unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 2,458 (0.8%) same-sex married 
couples or partnerships. 59,385 households (19.7%) were made up of individuals 
and 18,305 (6.1%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. 
The average household size was 3.09. There were 219,509 families (72.8% 
of all households); the average family size was 3.54. The age distribution 
of the city was as follows: 234,678 people (24.8%) were under the age of 
18, 89,457 people (9.5%) aged 18 to 24, 294,399 people (31.1%) aged 25 
to 44, 232,166 people (24.5%) aged 45 to 64, and 95,242 people (10.1%) 
who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35.2 years. For every 
100 females there were 101.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 99.8 males. There were 314,038 housing units at an average density 
of 1,745.0 per square mile (673.7/km²), of which 176,216 (58.5%) were owner-occupied, 
and 125,150 (41.5%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate 
was 1.6%; the rental vacancy rate was 4.3%. 553,436 people (58.5% of the 
population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 379,184 people (40.1%) 
lived in rental housing units. As of the census[64] of 2000, there were 
894,943 people, 276,598 households, and 203,576 families residing in the 
city. The population density was 5,117.9 people per square mile (1,976.1/km²). 
There were 281,841 housing units at an average density of 1,611.8 per square 
mile (622.3/km²). Of the 276,598 households, 38.3% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 56.0% were married couples living together, 
11.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.4% were 
non-families. 18.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 4.9% 
had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 3.20 and the average family size was 3.62. In the city 
the population was spread out with 26.4% under the age of 18, 9.9% from 
18 to 24, 35.4% from 25 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.3% who were 65 
years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females 
there were 103.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
102.5 males. According to a 2007 estimate, the median income for a household 
in the city was the highest in the U.S. for any city with more than a quarter 
million residents with $76,963 annually. The median income for a family 
was $86,822.[65] Males had a median income of $49,347 versus $36,936 for 
females. The per capita income for the city was $26,697. About 6.0% of 
families and 8.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 
10.3% of those under age 18 and 7.4% of those age 65 or over. San Jose 
and the rest of the Bay Area is home to many Christian congregations, including 
large Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, Mormons, and Jehovah's 
Witnesses, alongside centers of Jewish, Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist and Sikh 
faiths, among numerous other religious communities. A high percentage of 
foreign-born residents (39.0% of the population) live in the city. These 
include many high-tech workers from East and South Asia, Eastern European 
immigrants, as well as poorer immigrants from Latin America, many of whom 
can be found in the large, multi-generational barrio Alum Rock district. 
San Jose has the largest Vietnamese population of any city in the world 
outside of Vietnam.[66] The people from these countries have settled in 
the city and across the Santa Clara Valley primarily during the last three 
or four decades. The large concentration of high-technology engineering, 
computer, and microprocessor companies around San Jose has led the area 
to be known as Silicon Valley. As the largest city in the valley, San Jose 
has billed itself "the capital of Silicon Valley." Area schools such as 
the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Santa 
Cruz, San Jose State University, San Francisco State University, California 
State University, East Bay, Santa Clara University, and Stanford University 
pump thousands of engineering and computer science graduates into the local 
economy every year. High economic growth during the tech bubble caused 
employment, housing prices, and traffic congestion to peak in the late 
1990s. As the economy slowed in the early 2000s, employment and traffic 
congestion diminished somewhat. In the mid-2000s, traffic along major highways 
again began to worsen as the economy improved. San Jose had 405,000 jobs 
within its city limits in 2006, and an unemployment rate of 4.6%. In 2000, 
San Jose residents had the highest median household income of any city 
in the United States with a population over 300,000, and currently has 
the highest median income of any U.S. city with over 280,000 people. San 
Jose lists many companies with 1,000 employees or more, including the headquarters 
of Adobe, Altera, Brocade Communications Systems, Cadence Design Systems, 
Cisco Systems, eBay, Lee's Sandwiches, Lumileds, PayPal, Rosendin Electric, 
Sanmina-SCI, and Xilinx, as well as major facilities for Becton Dickinson, 
Ericsson, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, IBM, Kaiser Permanente, KLA Tencor, 
Lockheed Martin, Nippon Sheet Glass, Qualcomm, and AF Media Group. The 
North American headquarters of Samsung Semiconductor are located in San 
Jose.[67][68] Approximately 2000 employees will work at the new Samsung 
campus which opened in 2015. Other large companies based in San Jose include 
Altera, Atmel, CEVA, Cypress Semiconductor, Echelon, Extreme Networks, 
Harmonic, Integrated Device Technology, Maxim Integrated, Micrel, Move, 
Netgear, Novellus Systems, Oclaro, OCZ, Online Trading Academy, Quantum, 
SunPower, Sharks Sports and Entertainment, Supermicro, Tessera Technologies, 
TiVo, Ultratech, and VeriFone. Sizable government employers include the 
city government, Santa Clara County, and San Jose State University.[69] 
Acer's United States division has its offices in San Jose.[70] Prior to 
its closing, Netcom had its headquarters in San Jose.[71][72] The cost 
of living in San Jose and the surrounding areas is among the highest in 
California and the nation, according to 2004 data.[73] Housing costs are 
the primary reason for the high cost of living, although the costs in all 
areas tracked by the ACCRA Cost of Living Index are above the national 
average. Households in the city limits have the highest disposable income 
of any city in the U.S. with over 500,000 residents.[74][75] San Jose residents 
produce more U.S. patents than any other city.[76] On October 15, 2015, 
the United States Patent and Trademark Office opened a satellite office 
in San Jose to serve Silicon Valley and the Western U.S. States.[77][78] 
Thirty-five percent of all venture capital funds in the U.S. are invested 
in San Jose and Silicon Valley companies.[76] In January 2014 Forbes Magazine 
reported that Careerbliss.com had ranked San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara 
metro area as the happiest place to work in the USA. The report cited a 
large concentration of technology jobs that typically offer a high salary 
and opportunity for growth, in addition to companies providing "fun and 
innovative work environments" as some of the reasons for the ranking.[79] 
On July 31, 2015, Cupertino-based Apple Inc. purchased a 40-acre site in 
San Jose. The site, which is bare land, will be the site of an office and 
research campus where it is estimated that up to 16,000 employees will 
be located. Apple paid $138.2 million in cash for the site.[citation needed] 
The seller, Connecticut-based Five Mile Capital Partners paid $40 million 
for the site in 2010.[80] Real estate experts expect that other tech companies 
currently located in Silicon Valley will also follow in Apple's path by 
purchasing land or property in San Jose.[81] As of June 30, 2015, the top 
employers in the city are:[82] Because the downtown area is in the flight 
path to nearby Mineta San Jose International Airport (also evidenced in 
the above panoramic), there is a height limit for buildings in the downtown 
area, which is under the final approach corridor to the airport. The height 
limit is dictated by local ordinances, driven by the distance from the 
runway and a slope defined by Federal Aviation Administration regulations. 
Core downtown buildings are limited to approximately 300 feet (91 m) but 
can get taller farther from the airport.[83] There has been broad criticism 
over the past few decades of the city's architecture.[84] Citizens have 
complained that San Jose is lacking in aesthetically pleasing architectural 
styles. Blame for this lack of architectural "beauty" can be assigned to 
the re-development of the downtown area from the 1950s onward, in which 
whole blocks of historic commercial and residential structures were demolished.[85] 
Exceptions to this include the Downtown Historic District, the Hotel De 
Anza, and the Hotel Sainte Claire, both of which are listed in the National 
Register of Historic Places for their architectural and historical significance. 
Municipal building projects have experimented more with architectural styles 
than have most private enterprises.[86] The Children's Discovery Museum, 
Tech Museum of Innovation, and the San Jose Repertory Theater building 
have experimented with bold colors and unusual exteriors. The new City 
Hall, designed by Richard Meier & Partners opened in 2005 and is a notable 
addition to the growing collection of municipal building projects.[87] 
Public art is an evolving attraction in the city. The city was one of the 
first to adopt a public art ordinance at 2% of capital improvement building 
project budgets,[88] and the results of this commitment are beginning to 
affect the visual landscape of the city. There are a considerable number 
of public art projects throughout the downtown area, and a growing collection 
in the newer civic locations in neighborhoods including libraries, parks, 
and fire stations. Of particular note, the Mineta Airport expansion is 
incorporating a program of Art & Technology into its development. Within 
the early efforts at public art, there are notable controversies. Two examples 
include the statue of Quetzalcoatl (the plumed serpent) in downtown which 
was controversial in its planning because some religious groups felt that 
it was pagan, and controversial in its implementation because many felt 
that the final statue by Robert Graham did not closely resemble a winged 
serpent, and was more noted for its expense than its aesthetics. This has 
resulted in locals joking that the statue resembles a pile of feces.[89] 
The statue of Thomas Fallon also met strong resistance from those who felt 
that people like him were largely responsible for the decimation of early 
native populations and Chicano/Latino activists protested he captured San 
Jose by violent force in the Mexican-American war (1846) as well "repressed" 
historic documents of Fallon ordered the expulsion of most of the city's 
Californio (early Spanish or Mexican) residents. In October 1991 after 
protests in part of Columbus Day and Dia de la Raza celebrations, the Fallon 
statue plan was scrapped and the statue was stored in a warehouse in Oakland 
for more than a decade. The statue was returned to public display in 2002, 
albeit in a less conspicuous location: Pellier Park, a small triangular 
patch formed by the merge of West Julian and West St. James streets.[90] 
In 2001, the city sponsored SharkByte, an exhibit of decorated sharks, 
based on the mascot of the hockey team, the San Jose Sharks, and modeled 
after Chicago's display of decorated cows.[91] Large models of sharks were 
decorated in a variety of clever, colorful, or creative ways by local artists 
and were then displayed for months at dozens of locations around the city. 
Many displays were removed early because of vandalism. After the exhibition, 
the sharks were auctioned off and the proceeds donated to charity. The 
sharks can still be found in their new owners' homes and businesses. In 
2006, Adobe Systems commissioned an art installation titled San Jose Semaphore 
by Ben Rubin,[92] which is located at the top of its headquarters building. 
Semaphore is composed of four LED discs which "rotate" to transmit a message. 
The content of the San Jose Semaphore's message remained a mystery until 
it was deciphered in August 2007.[93][94] The visual art installation is 
supplemented with an audio track, transmitted from the building on a low-power 
AM station. The audio track provides clues to decode the message being 
transmitted. The city is home to many performing arts companies, including 
Opera San Jose, Symphony Silicon Valley, Ballet San Jose Silicon Valley, 
sjDANCEco, Children's Musical Theater of San Jose (45 years old in 2013),[95] 
the San Jose Youth Symphony, the San Jose Repertory Theatre, City Lights 
Theatre Company, The Tabard Theatre Company, San Jose Stage Company, and 
the now-defunct American Musical Theatre of San Jose which was replaced 
by Broadway San Jose in partnership with Team San Jose. San Jose also is 
home to the San Jose Museum of Art,[96] one of the nation's premiere Modern 
Art museums. The annual Cinequest Film Festival in downtown has grown to 
over 60,000 attendees per year, becoming an important festival for independent 
films. The San Francisco Asian American Film Festival is an annual event, 
which is hosted in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Downtown San Jose. Approximately 
30 to 40 films are screened in San Jose each year at the Camera 12 Downtown 
Cinemas. The San Jose Jazz Festival is another of many great events hosted 
throughout the year. The SAP Center at San Jose is one of the most active 
venues for events in the world. According to Billboard Magazine and Pollstar, 
the arena sold the most tickets to non-sporting events of any venue in 
the United States, and third in the world after the Manchester Evening 
News Arena in Manchester, England, and the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, 
Canada, for the period from January 1 – September 30, 2004.[97] Including 
sporting events, the SAP Center averages 184 events a year, or roughly 
one event for every two days, which is significantly higher than the average 
for NHL arenas.[98] San Jose has many examples of houses with fine architecture. 
Late 19th century and early 20th century styles exist in neighborhoods 
such as Hanchett Park, Naglee Park, Rose Garden, and Willow Glen (including 
Palm Haven). Styles include Craftsman, Mission Revival, Prairie style, 
and Queen Anne style Victorian. Notable architects include Frank Delos 
Wolfe, Theodore Lenzen, Charles McKenzie.[99] and Julia Morgan[100] San 
Jose is home to the San Jose Sharks of the NHL, the San Jose Barracuda 
of the AHL, and the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. The Sharks 
and the Barracuda play in the SAP Center at San Jose. The Earthquakes built 
an 18,000 seat new stadium that opened in March 2015. San Jose was a founding 
member of both the California League and Pacific Coast League in minor 
league baseball. San Jose currently fields the San Jose Giants, a High-A 
affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. The NFL's San Francisco 49ers call 
neighboring Santa Clara, California home. San Jose has "aggressively wooed" 
the Oakland Athletics to relocate to San Jose from nearby Oakland, and 
the Athletics in turn have said that San Jose is their "best option," but 
the San Francisco Giants have thus far exercised a veto against this proposal.[101] 
In 2013, the city of San Jose sued Major League Baseball for not allowing 
the Athletics to relocate to San Jose.[102][103] On October 5, 2015 the 
United States Supreme Court rejected San Jose's bid on the Athletics.[104] 
From 2005 to 2007, the San Jose Grand Prix, an annual street circuit race 
in the Champ Car World Series, was held in the downtown area. Other races 
included the Trans-Am Series, the Toyota Atlantic Championship, the United 
States Touring Car Championship, the Historic Stock Car Racing Series, 
and the Formula D Drift racing competition. In 2004, the San Jose Sports 
Authority hosted the U.S. Olympic team trials for judo, taekwondo, trampolining 
and rhythmic gymnastics at the San Jose State Event Center. In 2008, around 
90 percent of the members of the United States Olympic team were processed 
at San Jose State University prior to traveling to the 2008 Summer Olympics 
in Beijing.[105] The 2009 Junior Olympics for trampoline were also held 
here. In August 2004, the San Jose Seahawk Rugby Football Club hosted the 
USA All-Star Rugby Sevens Championships at Watson Bowl, east of Downtown. 
San Jose State hosted the 2011 American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) 
national tournament.[106] The NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament 
is also frequently held in San Jose. San Jose possesses about 15,950 acres 
(6,455 ha) of parkland in its city limits, including a part of the expansive 
Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The city's oldest 
park is Alum Rock Park, established in 1872.[107] In its 2013 ParkScore 
ranking, The Trust for Public Land, a national land conservation organization, 
reported that San Jose was tied with Albuquerque and Omaha for having the 
11th best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities.[108] Early 
written documents record the local presence of migrating salmon in the 
Rio Guadalupe dating as far back as the 18th century.[112] Both steelhead 
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) and King salmon are extant in the Guadalupe River, 
making San Jose the southernmost major U. S. city with known salmon spawning 
runs, the other cities being Anchorage, Alaska; Seattle, Washington; Portland, 
Oregon and Sacramento, California.[113] Runs of up to 1,000 Chinook or 
King Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) swam up the Guadalupe River each 
fall in the 1990s, but have all but vanished in the current decade apparently 
blocked from access to breeding grounds by impassable culverts, weirs and 
wide, exposed and flat concrete paved channels installed by the Santa Clara 
Valley Water District.[114] In 2011 a small number of Chinook salmon were 
filmed spawning under the Julian Street bridge.[115] San Jose's trail network 
offers over 53 miles (90 km) of recreational and commute trails throughout 
the city.[116] The major trails in the network include: This large urban 
trail network, recognized by Prevention Magazine as the nation's largest, 
is linked to trails in surrounding jurisdictions and many rural trails 
in surrounding open space and foothills. San Jose is a charter city under 
California law, giving it the power to enact local ordinances that may 
conflict with state law, within the limits provided by the charter.[117] 
The city has a council-manager government with a city manager nominated 
by the mayor and elected by the city council. The San Jose City Council 
is made up of ten council members elected by district, and a mayor elected 
by the entire city. During city council meetings, the mayor presides, and 
all eleven members can vote on any issue. The mayor has no veto powers. 
Council members and the mayor are elected to four-year terms; the even-numbered 
district council members beginning in 1994; the mayor and the odd-numbered 
district council members beginning in 1996.[118] Each council member represents 
approximately 100,000 constituents. Council members and the mayor are limited 
to two successive terms in office, although a council member that has reached 
the term limit can be elected mayor, and vice versa. The council elects 
a vice-mayor from the members of the council at the second meeting of the 
year following a council election. This council member acts as mayor during 
the temporary absence of the mayor, but does not succeed to the mayor's 
office upon a vacancy.[118] The City Manager is the chief administrative 
officer of the city, and must present an annual budget for approval by 
the city council. When the office is vacant, the Mayor proposes a candidate 
for City Manager, subject to council approval. The council appoints the 
Manager for an indefinite term, and may at any time remove the manager, 
or the electorate may remove the manager through a recall election. Other 
city officers directly appointed by the council include the City Attorney, 
City Auditor, City Clerk, and Independent Police Auditor.[118] Like all 
cities and counties in the state, San Jose has representation in the state 
legislature. Like all California cities except San Francisco, both the 
levels and the boundaries of what the city government controls are determined 
by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO).[119] The goal of a LAFCO 
is to try to avoid uncontrolled urban sprawl. The Santa Clara County LAFCO 
has set boundaries of San Jose's "Sphere of Influence" (indicated by the 
blue line in the map near the top of the page) as a superset of the actual 
city limits (the yellow area in the map), plus parts of the surrounding 
unincorporated county land, where San Jose can, for example, prevent development 
of fringe areas to concentrate city growth closer to the city's core. The 
LAFCO also defines a subset of the Sphere as an 'Urban Service Area' (indicated 
by the red line in the map), effectively limiting development to areas 
where urban infrastructure (sewers, electrical service, etc.) already exists. 
San Jose is the county seat of Santa Clara County.[120] Accordingly, many 
county government facilities are located in the city, including the office 
of the County Executive, the Board of Supervisors, the District Attorney's 
Office, eight courthouses of the Superior Court, the Sheriff's Office, 
and the County Clerk.[121] In the California State Senate, San Jose is 
split between the 10th, 15th, and 17th districts,[5] represented by Democrat 
Bob Wieckowski, Democrat Jim Beall, and Democrat Bill Monning respectively. 
In the California State Assembly, San Jose is split between the 25th, 27th, 
28th, and 29th districts,[6] represented by Democrat Kansen Chu, Democrat 
Nora Campos, Democrat Evan Low, and Democrat Mark Stone, respectively. 
Federally, San Jose is split between California's 17th, 18th, and 19th 
congressional districts,[122] represented by Democrat Mike Honda, Democrat 
Anna Eshoo, and Democrat Zoe Lofgren, respectively.[123] Several state 
and federal agencies maintain offices in San Jose. The city is the location 
of the Sixth District of the California Courts of Appeal.[124] It is also 
home to one of three courthouses of the United States District Court for 
the Northern District of California, the other two being in Oakland and 
San Francisco.[125] Crime in San Jose had been lower than in other large 
American cities until 2013, when crime rates in San Jose climbed above 
California and U.S. averages.[126] Like most large cities, crime levels 
had fallen significantly after rising in the 1980s.[127] Today it is no 
longer ranked as one of the safest cities in the country with a population 
over 1,000,000 people. The designation is based on crime statistics reported 
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in six categories: murder, rape, 
robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and auto theft. Recently, the city 
had the second lowest violent crime rate of any city with 500,000 or more 
residents, only behind Honolulu.[127] However, homicides since 2011 have 
surged; there were 20 homicides in 2010, 42 in 2011, 46 in 2012, and 44 
in 2013.[128] San Jose is home to several colleges and universities. The 
largest is San Jose State University, which was founded by the California 
legislature in 1862 as the California State Normal School, and is the founding 
campus of the California State University (CSU) system. Located in downtown 
San Jose since 1870, the university enrolls approximately 30,000 students 
in over 130 different bachelor's and master's degree programs. The school 
enjoys a good academic reputation, especially in the fields of engineering, 
business, art and design, and journalism, and consistently ranks among 
the top public universities in the western region of the United States.[129] 
San Jose State is one of only three Bay Area schools that fields a Football 
Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Division I college football team; Stanford University 
and U.C. Berkeley are the other two. National Hispanic University, with 
an enrollment of 600, offers associate and bachelor's degrees and teaching 
credentials to its students, focusing on Hispanic students. California 
University of Management and Technology (CALMAT) offers many degree programs, 
including MBA, Computer Science, Information Technology. Most classes are 
offered both online and in the downtown campus. Many of the students are 
working professionals in the Silicon Valley. Lincoln Law School of San 
Jose and University of Silicon Valley Law School offer law degrees, catering 
to working professionals. National University maintains a campus in San 
Jose. The San Jose campus of Golden Gate University offers business bachelor 
and MBA degrees. San Jose's community colleges, San Jose City College, 
West Valley College, Mission College and Evergreen Valley College, offer 
associate degrees, general education units to transfer to CSU and UC schools, 
and adult and continuing education programs. The West campus of Palmer 
College of Chiropractic is also located in San Jose. WestMed College is 
headquartered in San Jose and offers paramedic training, emergency medical 
technician training, and licensed vocational nursing programs. The University 
of California, Santa Cruz operates Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton. 
Western Seminary has one of its four campuses in San Jose, which opened 
on the campus of Calvary Church of Los Gatos in 1985. The campus relocated 
in 2010 to Santa Clara. Western is an evangelical, Christian graduate school 
that provides theological training for students who hope to serve in a 
variety of ministry roles including pastors, marriage and family therapists, 
educators, missionaries and lay leadership. The San Jose campus offers 
four master's degrees, and a variety of other graduate-level programs.[130] 
Up until the opening of Lincoln High School in 1943, San Jose students 
only attended San Jose High School. Some of the city's history is embedded 
within these two high schools, which hold a Thanksgiving Day high school 
football game, called the "Big Bone." As of 2010[update], there are 127 
elementary, 47 middle, and 44 high schools, of which are all public. Public 
education in the city is provided by four high school districts, fourteen 
elementary districts, and four unified school districts (which provide 
both elementary and high schools). In addition to the main San Jose Unified 
School District (SJUSD), other nearby unified school districts of nearby 
cities are Milpitas Unified School District, Morgan Hill Unified School 
District, and Santa Clara Unified School District. Districts using the 
"feeder" system: Prior to 1954, California law required cities and school 
districts to have the same boundaries. When San Jose began expanding, rural 
school districts became one of the major opponents, as their territory 
and tax base was taken by the city. The city's legislators pushed a bill 
through the California Legislature, removing that requirement, and ending 
much of the opposition. The result is a patchwork of local school districts 
in the areas annexed after 1954.[30] Private schools in San Jose are primarily 
run by religious groups. The Catholic Diocese of San Jose has the second 
largest student population in the Santa Clara County, behind only SJUSD; 
the diocese and its parishes operate several schools in the city, including 
six high schools: Archbishop Mitty High School, Bellarmine College Preparatory, 
Notre Dame High School, Saint Francis High School, St. Lawrence High School, 
and Presentation High School.[131] Other private high schools not run by 
the Diocese include two Baptist high schools, Liberty Baptist School[132] 
and White Road Baptist Academy, one Non-Denominational Protestant high 
school, Valley Christian High School (San Jose, California), one University-preparatory 
school, Cambrian Academy, and a nonsectarian K-12 Harker School west of 
the city in the Blackford neighborhood. The San Jose Public Library system 
is unique in that the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library combines the collections 
of the city's system with the San Jose State University main library. In 
2003, construction of the library, which now holds more than 1.6 million 
items, was the largest single library construction project west of the 
Mississippi, with eight floors that result in more than 475,000 square 
feet (44,100 m2) of space with a capacity for 2 million volumes.[133] The 
city has 23 neighborhood branches including the Biblioteca Latinoamericana 
which specializes in Spanish language works.[134] The East San Jose Carnegie 
Branch Library, a Carnegie library opened in 1908, is the last Carnegie 
library in Santa Clara County still operating as a public library and is 
listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As the result of a 
bond measure passed in November 2000, a number of brand new or completely 
reconstructed branches have been completed and opened. The yet-to-be-named 
brand new Southeast Branch is also planned, bringing the bond library project 
to its completion.[135] The San Jose system (along with the University 
system) were jointly named as "Library of the Year" by the Library Journal 
in 2004.[136] San Jose is served by Greater Bay Area media. Print media 
outlets in San Jose include the San Jose Mercury News, the weekly Metro 
Silicon Valley, El Observador and the Silicon Valley / San Jose Business 
Journal. The Bay Area's NBC O&O, KNTV 11, is based in San Jose. In total, 
broadcasters in the Bay Area include 34 television stations, 25 AM radio 
stations, and 55 FM radio stations.[137] In April 1909, Charles David Herrold, 
an electronics instructor in San Jose, constructed a radio station to broadcast 
the human voice. The station "San Jose Calling" (call letters FN, later 
FQW), was the world's first radio station with scheduled programming targeted 
at a general audience. The station became the first to broadcast music 
in 1910. Herrold's wife Sybil became the first female "disk jockey" in 
1912. The station changed hands a number of times before eventually becoming 
today's KCBS in San Francisco.[138] Therefore, KCBS technically is the 
oldest radio station in the United States, and celebrated its 100th anniversary 
in 2009 with much fanfare. Rail service to and from San Jose is provided 
by Amtrak (the Sacramento–San-Jose Capitol Corridor and the Seattle–Los-Angeles 
Coast Starlight), Caltrain (commuter rail service between San Francisco 
and Gilroy), ACE (commuter rail service to Pleasanton and Stockton), and 
a local light-rail system connecting downtown to Mountain View, Milpitas, 
Campbell, and Almaden Valley, operated by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation 
Authority (VTA). Historic streetcars from History Park operate on the light 
rail lines in downtown during holidays. Long-term plans call for BART to 
be expanded to Santa Clara through Milpitas and San Jose from the current 
terminal in Fremont. Originally, the extension was to be built all at once, 
but due to the recession, sales tax revenue has dramatically decreased. 
Because of this, the extension will be built in two phases. Phase 1 will 
extend service to a temporary terminal in north-eastern San Jose in 2018 
at Berryessa station. Construction has been approved and funded and began 
in Summer 2012 and will connect with the Warm Springs extension to southern 
Fremont. In addition, San Jose will be a major stop on the future California 
High Speed Rail route between Los Angeles and San Francisco.[139] Diridon 
Station (formerly Cahill Depot, 65 Cahill Street) is the meeting point 
of all regional commuter rail service in the area. It was built in 1935 
by the Southern Pacific Railroad, and was refurbished in 1994. VTA also 
operates many bus routes in San Jose and the surrounding communities, as 
well as offering paratransit services to local residents. Additionally, 
the Highway 17 Express bus line connects central San Jose with Santa Cruz. 
Intercity bus providers include Greyhound, BoltBus, Megabus, California 
Shuttle Bus, TUFESA, Intercalifornias, Hoang, and USAsia.[140] San Jose 
is served by Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport (IATA: SJC, ICAO: 
KSJC, FAA LID: SJC), two miles (3 km) northwest of downtown, and by Reid-Hillview 
Airport of Santa Clara County (ICAO: KRHV, FAA LID: RHV) a general aviation 
airport located in the eastern part of San Jose. San Jose residents also 
use San Francisco International Airport (IATA: SFO, ICAO: KSFO, FAA LID: 
SFO), a major international hub located 35 miles (56 km) to the northwest, 
and Oakland International Airport (IATA: OAK, ICAO: KOAK, FAA LID: OAK), 
another major international airport located 35 miles (56 km) to the north. 
The airport is also near the intersections of three major freeways, U.S. 
Route 101, Interstate 880, and State Route 87. The San Jose area has a 
large freeway system, including three Interstate freeways and one U.S. 
Route. It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a 
primary Interstate; most of the Interstate Highway Network was planned 
by the early 1950s well before San Jose's rapid growth decades later. U.S. 
101 runs south to the California Central Coast and Los Angeles, and then 
runs north up near the eastern shore of the San Francisco Peninsula to 
San Francisco. I-280 also heads to San Francisco, but goes along just to 
the west of the cities of San Francisco Peninsula. I-880 heads north to 
Oakland, running parallel to the southeastern shore of San Francisco Bay. 
I-680 parallels I-880 to Fremont, but then cuts northeast to the eastern 
cities of the San Francisco Bay Area. Several state highways also serve 
San Jose: SR 17, SR 85, SR 87 and SR 237. Additionally, San Jose is served 
by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the Almaden Expressway, 
Capitol Expressway, San Tomas Expressway, and Lawrence Expressway. Several 
regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to 
deal with congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expansion of State 
Route 87 including more lanes near the downtown San Jose area. The interchange 
for I-280 connecting with I-680 and US 101, a rush-hour spot where the 
three freeways meet has been known to have high-density traffic similar 
to Los Angeles County interchanges. The interchange at the beginning of 
I-280 and I-680 was constructed years before its completion. The two bridges, 
with no on ramps or off ramps stood over U.S. Route 101 as a 110 foot tall 
monument to inefficiency for years in the 1970s. It became the butt of 
many local jokes. The highlight prank occurred in January 1976, when a 
1960 Chevrolet Impala was placed on the highest bridge overnight, where 
it obviously would be impossible to drive. The following day, San Jose 
City Councilman Joe Colla was photographed standing next to the car, a 
photo which was circulated across many newspapers.[141] It has been suggested 
this stunt nudged the wheels of progress to find the funds to complete 
the freeway. In 2010, the interchange was named the Joe Colla Interchange.[142] 
A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked San Jose the nineteenth most walkable 
of fifty largest cities in the United States.[143] Potable water is provided 
primarily by the private-sector San Jose Water Company, with some by the 
Great Oaks Water Company, and ten percent by the public-sector San Jose 
Municipal Water System. Great Oaks provides exclusively well water, while 
the other two provide water from multiple sources, including well water, 
and surface water from the Los Gatos Creek watershed, Santa Clara Valley 
Water District, and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission's Hetch 
Hetchy Reservoir. The city recycles over 50% of its solid waste.[144][145] 
It accepts textiles and "small metal appliances" for recycling, but not 
polystyrene foam.[146] Wastewater treatment happens at the San Jose-Santa 
Clara Regional Wastewater Facility (RWF), which treats and cleans the wastewater 
of more than 1,500,000 people that live and work in the 300+ square mile 
(780 km²) area encompassing San Jose, Santa Clara, Milpitas, Campbell, 
Cupertino, Los Gatos, Saratoga, and Monte Sereno.[145] About 18% of the 
treated wastewater is sold for irrigation ("water recycling") in San Jose, 
Santa Clara, and Milpitas, through local water providers San Jose Municipal 
Water System, City of Milpitas Municipal Services, City of Santa Clara 
Water & Sewer Utility, and San Jose Water Company. PG&E provides residents 
natural gas and electricity service. Telephone communications are provided 
primarily by AT&T, and cable television is provided by Comcast. Internet 
services are provided by several companies, but primarily by Comcast and 
AT&T. On March 14, 2013, San Jose implemented a public wireless connection 
in the downtown area.[147] Wireless access points were placed on outdoor 
light posts throughout the city.[148] San Jose has one of the oldest Sister 
City programs in the nation. In 1957, when the city established a relationship 
with Okayama, Japan, it was only the third Sister City relationship in 
the nation, which had begun the prior year. The Office of Economic Development 
coordinates the San Jose Sister City Program which is part of Sister Cities 
International. As of 2014[update], there are eight sister cities:[150]
