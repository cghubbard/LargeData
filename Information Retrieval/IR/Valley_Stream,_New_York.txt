Valley Stream is a village in Nassau County, New York in the United States. 
The population in the village of Valley Stream was 37,511 at the 2010 census.[1] 
The associated Village of Valley Stream is inside the southwest part of 
the town of Hempstead, along the border with Queens. The village is served 
by the Long Island Rail Road at the Valley Stream station, located at Sunrise 
Highway and Franklin Avenue. It is also served by the Gibson station at 
Gibson and Munro Boulevards, but only along the Far Rockaway Branch. Valley 
Stream is located at 40°39′53″N 73°42′12″W﻿ / ﻿40.664780°N 73.703327°W﻿ 
/ 40.664780; -73.703327 (40.664780, -73.703327).[2] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 3.5 square miles 
(9.1 km2), of which 3.4 square miles (8.8 km2) is land and 0.04 square 
miles (0.10 km2), or 0.86%, is water. Communities bordering Valley Stream 
are Elmont (Home of Belmont Park Racetrack), Lynbrook, Malverne, Franklin 
Square, Hewlett, Woodmere, and Rosedale (a neighborhood in Queens in New 
York City). There are many different sections of Valley Stream: In the 
year 1640, 14 years after the arrival of the Dutch settlers in Manhattan, 
the area that is now Valley Stream was purchased by the Dutch West India 
Company from Rockaway Native Americans. There was no development of the 
woodland area for the next two centuries. The census of 1840 list about 
20 families, most of whom owned large farms. At that time, the northwest 
section was called “Fosters Meadow”. The business section on Rockaway Avenue 
was called “Rum Junction” because of its lively nightlife. The racy northern 
section was known as “Cookie Hill”, and the section of the northeast that 
housed the local fertilizer plant was called “Skunks Misery”. Hungry Harbor, 
a section that has retained its name, was home to a squatter’s community. 
Robert Pagan was born in Scotland on December 3, 1796. In or about the 
late 1830s, Robert, his wife Ellen, and their children emigrated from Scotland. 
On the journey to America, one of their children died and was buried at 
sea. The 1840 U.S. Census for Queens County lists Pagan's occupation as 
a farmer. Two children were born to Robert and Ellen Pagan after they settled 
in the town of Hempstead. At this time, the community did not have a post 
office, so mail had to be picked up in Hempstead. Pagan petitioned the 
appropriate authorities for a post office and it was housed in his home, 
the Pagan-Fletcher House.[3] He was advised that the community needed a 
name. Pagan chose "Valley Stream" based on the topographical appearance 
of the area. In 1843, the U.S. Post Office formally accepted the name of 
Valley Stream. As a consequence, Pagan is credited with naming the community. 
Pagan died on March 25, 1870. Mr. Pagan’s wife, Ellen, also played a significant 
role in village history. Tired of traveling to Lynbrook for religious services, 
she began holding the services in her home. A Methodist minister was hired 
for periodic stops in the Pagan home, and the first congregation in Valley 
Stream was founded. She also pushed for her husband to change the family 
to Payan, seen now in Payan Avenue. In 1853, Hempstead Turnpike was the 
only route that connected Valley Stream to Jamaica and New York City. The 
main streets in Valley Stream that connected the small village to the turnpike 
were Mill Road (which is Corona Avenue today) in the west, Sand Street 
(Central Avenue) in the south, and Dutch Broadway in the north. That year 
Merrick Road, a planked, one lane road came through Valley Stream, connecting 
the village to Merrick in the east, and Jamaica to the west. With the new 
thoroughfare in the area, Valley Stream residents and industry began to 
move southward. In 1869, the South Side Railroad began stopping in Valley 
Stream and a branch of the railroad was constructed that connected the 
main line with the Rockaways. The new branch is now called the Far Rockaway 
Branch of the Long Island Railroad. The new railroad, combined with the 
emergence of Merrick Road as a major artery, caused Valley Stream to grow 
into a substantial community. Around the start of the 20th century, Hendrickson 
Park became a prime vacationing spot for people from Brooklyn and Queens. 
The Valley Stream Hotel opened at the beginning of the 20th Century, overlooking 
the golf course. Many tourists who came to visit wound up moving to Valley 
Stream. The Village of Valley Stream was incorporated in 1925 as a result 
of its growth. In 1922, developer William R. Gibson came to Valley Stream 
after building more than 2,500 homes in Queens. He bought 500 acres (2.0 km2) 
of land on Roosevelt Avenue and built homes on Avondale, Berkeley, Cambridge, 
Derby, and Elmwood Streets. Five years later he expanded his development 
to Cochran Place and Dartmouth Street. Realizing that his development was 
perfectly designed for the new class of white-collar commuters, he petitioned 
the Long Island Railroad for a stop. The LIRR agreed to stop in the area 
if Gibson would build the station himself. On May 29, 1929, the Gibson 
station was opened. Gibson station, as it became known, still retains the 
name of its founder. As of the census[6] of 2000, there were 36,368 people,
