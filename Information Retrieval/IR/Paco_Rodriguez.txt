Steven Francis "Paco" Rodríguez (born April 16, 1991) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Prior to playing professionally, Rodriguez attended the University of Florida, 
where he played college baseball for the Florida Gators. He previously 
played for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Rodriguez is of Cuban descent. His 
parents met and married in Spain after defecting from their home country 
separately. They then moved to the Dominican Republic, Canada, and New 
Jersey before living in the Miami, Florida area, where their son was born 
on April 16, 1991.[1] Rodriguez has an older sister.[2] He attended Gulliver 
Preparatory School in Miami, Florida,[3] where he was named to Class 3A 
All-State and the Miami Herald All-Dade Team.[4] The Houston Astros selected 
Rodriguez in the 48th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft after 
his high school graduation, but he did not sign.[5] Rodriguez enrolled 
at the University of Florida, in order to play college baseball for the 
Florida Gators baseball team in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). For 
the Gators, Rodriguez served as the team's closer.[6] His career earned 
run average (ERA) at Florida (2.19) in 86 appearances is the lowest since 
the introduction of aluminum bats in 1974. He was an All-SEC selection 
in 2012.[7] Rodriguez helped lead the Gators to the College World Series 
in three consecutive years.[5] The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Rodriguez 
in the second round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft. Draft experts 
suggested that he would be one of the first players from the draft to reach 
the majors.[8] After signing with the Dodgers, he was assigned to the Great 
Lakes Loons of the Class A Midwest League.[5] After six appearances with 
the Loons, he was promoted to the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Class AA 
Southern League,[9] where he pitched in 15 games with a 1.32 ERA.[10] The 
Dodgers promoted Rodriguez to the major leagues on September 5, 2012,[10] 
and became the first 2012 draftee to reach the majors.[11] He made his 
debut in a game on September 9 against the San Francisco Giants and retired 
the one batter he faced.[2] He appeared in 11 games for the Dodgers in 
2012, as a left-handed specialist, and allowed only one run to score in 
6.2 innings.[12] Rodriguez started the 2013 season on the Dodgers' major 
league roster. After a rocky April,[13] he became a trusted member of the 
Dodgers' bullpen,[14] though he faltered in September and October under 
the heavy workload of an MLB season.[13] From May through August, his ERA 
was 1.31 in 52 appearances.[13] His season totals were a record of 3-4 
with a 2.32 ERA in 76 games.[13] Rodriguez spent most of 2014 with the 
AAA Albuquerque Isotopes, but had four separate brief stints with the Dodgers.[15] 
In July, Rodriguez strained an upper back muscle.[16] In 32 games with 
the Isotopes, he was 2–3 with a 4.40 ERA and in 19 games for the Dodgers, 
he was 1–0 with a 3.86 ERA.[17] In May 2015, Rodriguez was added to the 
disabled list and underwent a bone spur removal surgery in July.[18] On 
July 30, 2015, in a three-team trade, the Atlanta Braves acquired Rodriguez, 
Héctor Olivera, minor league pitcher Zachary Bird, and a competitive balance 
draft pick for the 2016 MLB Draft, while the Dodgers acquired Mat Latos, 
Michael Morse, Bronson Arroyo, Alex Wood, Jim Johnson, Luis Avilán, and 
José Peraza, and the Miami Marlins acquired minor league pitchers Victor 
Araujo, Jeff Brigham, and Kevin Guzman.[19] Though he was expected to recover 
sufficiently from multiple injuries by September and make his first appearances 
for the Braves, Rodriguez did not pitch at the major league level for the 
rest of the 2015 season, and underwent Tommy John surgery in September.[18] 
Rodriguez has an unusual and deceptive delivery in which, from the batter's 
perspective, he hides the ball behind his head before slinging it towards
