Williamsport is a city in and the county seat of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, 
United States.[4] In 2009, the population was estimated at 29,304. It is 
the principal city of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical 
Area, which has a population of about 117,000. Williamsport was settled 
by Americans late in the 18th century, and the town began to prosper due 
to its lumber industry. By the early 20th century, the town reached the 
height of its prosperity and the population has since declined by about 
a third from its peak of around 45,000 in 1950. Williamsport is the birthplace 
of Little League Baseball. South Williamsport, a town nearby, is the headquarters 
of Little League Baseball and annually hosts the Little League World Series 
in late summer. Colonial settlement in what is today Williamsport dates 
back to 1786 but the area was previously inhabited by the Iroquois. Williamsport 
was incorporated as a borough on March 1, 1806, and as a city on January 
15, 1866. In the late 19th century, Williamsport was known as "The Lumber 
Capital of the World" because of its thriving lumber industry. The city 
is the original home of Little League Baseball, founded in 1939 as a three-team 
league. Following World War II the city's population and economic prosperity 
have declined. In 1763 the Battle of Muncy Hills took place during the 
French and Indian War. It was a clash between the Native Americans and 
colonists seeking homestead sites in Native American territory.[5] In 1768, 
at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the British purchased the land that became 
Lycoming County from the Iroquois Nation who controlled the lands.[5] In 
1786 the first house was built in Williamsport. James Russell built his 
inn on what is now the corner of East Third and Mulberry Streets in downtown.[6] 
On April 13, 1795 Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County. 
It encompassed all the lands of Northumberland County situated west of 
Muncy Hills and was a domain of 12,500 square miles (32,000 km2), comprising 
most of north central Pennsylvania.[5] In 1796 the first recorded childbirth 
in Williamsport was James Russell the son of Mr. and Mrs. William Russell 
and grandson of James Russell of the Russell Inn[6] and the first school 
was built as a one-room log addition to the building that would eventually 
become the first Lycoming County Courthouse.[6] In 1798 the first brick 
house in Williamsport was erected on Front Street, between Market and Mulberry, 
by Andrew Tulloh, a lawyer. The bricks were made on the banks of Grafius 
Run where that stream crossed Hepburn Street.[5] In 1799, a post office 
opened at the corner of Third and State Streets in what is now downtown,[6] 
and the following year, a jail was constructed at the northeast corner 
of William and Third Streets.[5] The post office was later converted to 
a saloon,[6] In 1801 the town's first store was opened by William Winter 
on Third Street.[6] In 1831 Jacob L. Mussina established the Repasz Band, 
the oldest brass band in America still in existence.[5] On Oct. 15 1834 
The West Branch Canal opened and the first boat to pass through the canal 
en route to Jersey Shore was that of George Aughenbaugh. The first freight 
carried into town was iron for the foundry of John B. Hall.[5] The same 
year the enactment of the common school law by Pennsylvania Legislature 
led to public education here. In May 1835, the first public schools opened 
in Williamsport and also the town's first bank, the West Branch National 
Bank.[5] From 1830 until 1865, the underground railroad, a system of safe 
houses and routes for slaves escaping to freedom, operated in Lycoming 
County; many local abolitionists, including Daniel Hughes, served as conductors 
and agents.[5] In 1849 the Market Street Bridge was built over the West 
Branch Susquehanna River. It was opened as a toll bridge to cover the state's 
costs of $23,797.[6] In 1854 a brewery opened. The brewery was sold to 
Henry Flock in 1865. This brewery was run by the Flock family until the 
1940s. The Flock's business survived Prohibition by converting to a dairy.[6] 
In 1875 the first tower clock in the United States to sound the Cambridge 
Quarters (Westminster Chime) was installed at Trinity Episcopal Church, 
a gift of Peter Herdic with bells given by the Honorable Judge J. W. Maynard. 
The following year the Williamsport Hospital opened its first facility 
April 1 at Elmira and Edwin Streets.[5] In 1881 a state law ended racial 
segregation in Pennsylvania schools. By 1948, all schools in this area 
were integrated.[5] In 1895 Harry Houdini appeared in one of his earliest 
performances at the Old Fair Grounds with The Welch Brothers Circus.[7] 
Williamsport was the birthplace of the national newspaper Grit in 1882. 
Williamsport once had more millionaires per-capita than anywhere else in 
the world.[citation needed] For this reason, the area's local high school, 
the Williamsport Area High School, uses "Millionaires" as its team nickname. 
The Flood of March 17–18, 1936 caused the river to crest at 33.9’. Flood 
waters reached High Street. It was known locally as the Hello, Al flood 
because Al Glaes, operating a short-wave radio station from his home on 
High Street, kept the city in touch with the rest of the world after the 
flood disrupted electricity and telephone service.[5] On June 6, 1939 the 
first Little League Baseball game was played on a sandlot outside Bowman 
Field in Williamsport. Carl Stotz conceived the idea of a Little League, 
and he and Bert and George Bebble managed the first three teams.[5] In 
1941 the U.S. entered World War II after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. 
Williamsport native Joe Lockard, stationed on Oahu, gave warning of the 
impending attack based on radar readings. His readings were dismissed as 
American B17 bombers coming in from the mainland.[5] Also in 1941 the Williamsport 
School Board created the Williamsport Technical Institute for high school 
and post-high school students. It grew into the Williamsport Area Community 
College, and later became Pennsylvania College of Technology.[5] Williamsport
