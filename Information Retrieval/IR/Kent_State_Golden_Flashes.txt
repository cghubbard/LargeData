The intercollegiate athletic teams at Kent State University are known as 
the Golden Flashes or simply as the Flashes. The university fields sixteen 
varsity athletic teams in the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) at the Division I level with football competing in the Football 
Bowl Subdivision. Kent State is a full member of the Mid-American Conference 
(MAC) and has been part of the MAC East division since it was created in 
1998. Official school colors are Kent State Blue and Kent State Gold. Joel 
Nielsen is athletic director, a position he has held since May 1, 2010.[3] 
Athletic events were held during the very first semester at Kent State 
in late 1913, with several intramural teams for female students and a limited 
number of opportunities for male students. Early men's athletic events, 
in basketball and baseball, were played against local high school, church, 
and company teams. The first intercollegiate athletic event, a men's basketball 
game, was held in January 1915 and the baseball team held their first intercollegiate 
game later that year. A dedicated athletic field was built around 1920 
and the school's first gymnasium opened in 1925. Football also debuted 
as a sport in 1920, followed by wrestling, men's tennis, men's gymnastics, 
and men's swimming. From 1932–1951, Kent State competed as a member of 
the Ohio Athletic Conference before joining the Mid-American Conference 
in 1951. The school's first permanent football stadium and a new basketball 
gym opened in 1950. Although women's intramural athletics had been part 
of the university since it was first established, the first women's intercollegiate 
athletic team was not founded until 1959 when the women's gymnastics team 
was established, the first women's collegiate gymnastics team in the U.S. 
Additional women's sports, including swimming, field hockey, basketball, 
and volleyball, were added in the mid-1970s following the passage and implementation 
of Title IX. Budget constraints and other factors led to the university 
dropping swimming, tennis, ice hockey, and men's soccer during the 1980s 
and 1990s, with ice hockey becoming a club-level sport in the American 
Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) Division I as part of the Great Lakes 
Collegiate Hockey League (GLCHL). The most recent changes occurred in the 
late 1990s when women's golf and women's soccer were added as varsity sports. 
Plans were announced in March 2016 to add a women's lacrosse program for 
the 2018–19 season. Several Kent State athletic teams have enjoyed success 
in the Mid-American Conference and at the national level over the years 
and the university has produced individual national champions in both wrestling 
and track and field. Both the men's and women's golf teams have been the 
most successful in MAC play having won the most conference titles in MAC 
history through 2015. The men's golf team has also finished as high as 
5th nationally in 2012 to go with 6th and 9th-place finishes. Additionally, 
the men's basketball team made a notable run to the Elite Eight in 2002, 
the baseball team advanced to the College World Series in 2012, and the 
softball team qualified for the Women's College World Series in 1990. Kent 
State also has had high national finishes from the men's indoor and outdoor 
track and field teams, women's gymnastics, and wrestling. A number of Golden 
Flashes alumni have gone on to play and coach in both college and major 
professional sports, such as Jack Lambert, Antonio Gates, Nick Saban, Lou 
Holtz, Thurmon Munson, and Emmanuel Burriss. Athletics at Kent State began 
shortly after the school was first organized in 1910 and the first classes 
held in 1912. The school's first sporting event was a men's basketball 
game in 1913 against Kent High School and the following spring (1914) the 
baseball team was organized, known as the "Normal Nine". The football team 
followed in 1920 and held their first game on October 30, a 6-0 loss to 
Ashland College.[4] Around this same time, the teams became known as the 
"Silver Foxes" because then-president John Edward McGilvrey raised silver 
foxes on his farm east of campus. After McGilvrey's controversial firing 
in 1926, the new administration held a contest to choose a different team 
name and "Golden Flashes" was chosen, though no significance was included 
in the name. The first use of "Golden Flashes" occurred in 1927 after it 
was approved by the student body and faculty athletic committee. The school 
colors are officially defined as "Kent State blue" and "Kent State gold", 
which are shades of Navy blue and gold. The original school colors, as 
chosen by the school's first president John Edward McGilvrey, were orange 
and blue, believed to have been inspired by the school colors for the University 
of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where McGilvrey had been a professor. 
Gold was also used with blue during the 1920s. A committee formally set 
the colors as royal blue and gold in 1925.[5] Kent State was a member of 
the Ohio Athletic Conference from 1932–1951 and joined the Mid-American 
Conference in 1951. Although no Kent State team has won a national title 
in any sport, several Golden Flashes teams have placed highly in NCAA national 
tournaments. Notable national finishes include: Kent State sponsors 16 
athletic teams at the NCAA Division I level, seven men's teams and nine 
women's. All teams compete in the Mid-American Conference. The academic 
year is divided into three seasons, with the fall sports season typically 
lasting from August into December, the winter sports season going from 
late November into March, and the spring sports season beginning in early 
March and ending in June. Fall sports are football, women's field hockey, 
women's soccer, women's volleyball, men's and women's golf, and men's and 
women's cross country. During the winter sports season, Kent State has 
men's and women's basketball, women's gymnastics, wrestling, and men's 
and women's indoor track & field. The spring sports season features men's 
and women's golf, baseball, softball, and men's and women's outdoor track 
& field. Both men's and women's golf compete in tournaments around the 
country in both the fall and spring seasons, with MAC and NCAA championship 
play held in the spring season. Beginning in 2018–19, the university will 
add a women's lacrosse team, which will share Murphy-Mellis Field with 
the field hockey team. The lacrosse team will play in the spring season.[8] 
The baseball team is Kent State's second oldest sport, though it is the 
school's oldest intercollegiate team.[4] Formed in 1914, they were known 
originally as the "Normal Nine" as the school was originally known as Kent 
State Normal School. The team has enjoyed significant success both in the 
Mid-American Conference and on the national level and has sent several 
players to the major leagues over the years. The team's home field is Olga 
Mural Field at Schoonover Stadium, opened in 2005 on the site of the team's 
previous home, Gene Michael Field. The coach is Jeff Duncan, who was hired 
as coach after the 2013 season. Through the 2014 season, the team has 11 
MAC East titles, 13 MAC regular-season titles, 11 MAC tournament titles, 
and 13 NCAA tournament appearances.[9] In 2012, the team made its first 
appearances in both the Super Regional round of the NCAA baseball tournament 
and the College World Series.[10] The men's basketball team, which began 
play in 1913 and intercollegiate competition in 1914,[4] plays in the Memorial 
Athletic and Convocation Center and is Kent State's oldest sport and second-oldest 
intercollegiate team. After decades of near anonymity, since 1998 the team 
has been one of the most consistent in the Mid-American Conference with 
a league record ten straight twenty-win seasons from the 1998–99 season 
through the 2007–08 season (the previous record was five straight). Kent 
State was one of only eight NCAA Division I men's basketball programs in 
the United States to have ten consecutive seasons with twenty or more wins.[12] 
Kent State also holds the MAC record for consecutive seasons with double-digit 
conference wins, also for ten consecutive seasons (the previous record 
was eight straight),[13] and in 2002 finished 17–1 in conference play, 
setting a MAC record for conference wins in a season. The Flashes amassed 
thirty victories in the 2001–02 season which culminated in a berth in the 
NCAA Elite Eight. In the tournament they defeated seventh-seeded Oklahoma 
State, second-seeded Alabama, and third-seeded Pitt. One of the stars on 
this team, power forward Antonio Gates, went on to become a superstar tight 
end with the San Diego Chargers. Kent State has made ten MAC tournament 
title game appearances (second most in conference history) and has won 
five (second most), along with three regular-season MAC overall titles 
and six MAC East titles. The women's basketball team, which began play 
during the 1975–1976 season, also plays home games at the Memorial Athletic 
and Convocation Center. Currently, they are coached by Bob Lindsay, who 
has been with Kent State for 21 seasons as of 2009–2010.[14] They have 
seven MAC East titles, six MAC overall titles, and four MAC tournament 
titles. In addition, they have five NCAA tournament appearances, the most 
recent being in 2002, and one WNIT appearance. Kent State has appeared 
in eleven MAC Tournament championship games (tied for most appearances 
with Toldeo), including seven in a row from 1996–2002. In fact, the 1996–2001 
MAC title games all featured Kent State vs. Toledo. In 1998, Kent State 
became one of only two MAC schools (Bowling Green being the other) to complete 
the regular season and tournament with a perfect record, going 18-0 in 
the regular season and winning the conference tournament. Prior to the 
start of the 2009–2010 season, Kent State had an overall record of 535-387 
and a MAC record of 280-179.[14] The field hockey team plays its home matches 
at Murphy-Mellis Field, which opened in 2005 and is adjacent to Dix Stadium. 
The team has won 13 MAC titles, with the most recent in 2015 and has 11 
MAC tournament titles and NCAA appearances, the most recent being in 2015.[16] 
In 2001, Kent State hosted the NCAA Division I national championship at 
Dix Stadium, where they played their home games from 1997–2004. The Golden 
Flashes football team plays in the NCAA's Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. 
Home games are played at Dix Stadium on the far eastern edge of the Kent 
State campus. Since 2012, the head coach is Paul Haynes. Behind Dix Stadium 
are practice fields, as well as the Kent State Field House, which contains 
a full indoor football field. Kent State has three post-season bowl appearances: 
a 1954 trip to the now-defunct Refrigerator Bowl in Evansville, Indiana, 
where they lost to the Delaware Blue Hens 19-7, a 1972 bid to the Tangerine 
Bowl in Orlando, Florida, where they lost to Tampa 21-18,[17] and the 2013 
GoDaddy.com Bowl. Although the team has not enjoyed many winning seasons, 
Kent State has sent a fair amount of players to the ranks of the National 
Football League as well as in other areas of college football. Don James 
coached the team from 1971–1974 during the era which also saw future NFL 
great Jack Lambert and current Alabama head coach Nick Saban playing for 
the Golden Flashes and Kent State's only Mid-American Conference championship 
in 1972 and their most recent bowl appearance. NFL players as of 2011 who 
played football at Kent State include Dri Archer, Joshua Cribbs of the 
New York Jets, Julian Edelman of the New England Patriots, and James Harrison 
of the Cincinnati Bengals. In addition, Antonio Gates, who played for the 
men's basketball team, plays for the NFL's San Diego Chargers. Other notable 
football alumni and former coaches include current ESPN analyst and former 
Notre Dame and South Carolina head coach Lou Holtz, former Houston Texans 
head coach and current Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Dom Capers 
(graduate assistant at Kent State), former Toronto Argonauts standout Jim 
Corrigall (who also served as head coach at KSU) and Gary Pinkel, head 
coach of the Missouri Tigers. The men's golf team has had success both 
in the Mid-American Conference and at the national level, winning 23 MAC 
titles and making 26 trips to the NCAA level competition, including 14 
trips to the championship round and three regional championships.[18] They 
practice at Windmill Lakes Golf Club in nearby Ravenna, where they occasionally 
host matches, and the Kent State Golf Course, located just east of campus 
in Franklin Township. The program has produced several pro-golfers and 
in 2003, former Golden Flashes standout Ben Curtis won the British Open 
in what ABC commentator Mike Tirico called "one of the most amazing stories 
in the history of the Open Championship" and the "all-time Cinderella story."[19] 
The team is coached by Herb Page, a Kent State alum who has been head coach 
since 1978. He has led the Flashes to 20 of their 23 MAC titles, their 
three regional titles, and 24 of their 26 trips to NCAA competition. In 
2008, he coached Kent State to its highest finish ever at the national 
level, finishing 6th in the country at the NCAA championship[20] as well 
as a ninth-place NCAA finish in 2000. Page has been named MAC Coach of 
the Year fifteen times and NCAA district IV Coach of the Year eight times.[21] 
In mid–2007, Kent State opened the Ferrara and Page Golf Training and Learning 
Center located at the southern edge of the Kent State Golf Course. The 
facility includes a 350-yard outdoor practice range, outdoor practice tees, 
and outdoor short-game practice areas as well as an indoor putting and 
chipping area, a video analysis room, and a Science and Motion Putt lab. 
In addition, the rear of the facility features heated stalls which allow 
team members to access the driving range even during the winter months 
to provide year-round training for both the men's and women's teams.[22] 
The women's golf team, founded in the fall of 1998, has enjoyed success 
from its beginning. Every year of the program's existence it has won the 
Mid-American Conference title and is so far the only school to win the 
MAC's women's golf championship, which began in April 1999. Through 2016, 
they have advanced to NCAA play in the last 16 seasons, reaching the championship 
round in 4 of them.[23] 2001 saw the Flashes finish fifteenth in the country, 
their highest finish to date,[24] while 2008 saw the Flashes win two regular-season 
tournaments, gain a national ranking of thirteenth, and win their tenth 
consecutive MAC title by 51 strokes.[25] Their 18th consecutive MAC championship 
in 2016 set the conference record for most consecutive championships in 
a sport.[26] Along with the men's team, they practice at Windmill Lakes 
Golf Course in Ravenna, and the Kent State Golf Course and adjacent Ferrara 
and Page Golf Training and Learning Center in Franklin Township. The team 
is coached by Greg Robertson, who began his tenure in June 2013.[27] He 
replaced Mike Morrow, who had coached the team from its inception. In addition 
to the 15 MAC titles and 13 NCAA appearances, Morrow also coached the team 
to 27 titles at various regular-season tournaments.[28][29] First developed 
in 1959, the Kent State women's gymnastics team was the first women's gymnastics 
team at the collegiate level.[30] They began intercollegiate competition 
in 1964[31] and Mid-American Conference competition in 1981 and have enjoyed 
consistent success throughout their existence, which includes 11 Mid-American 
Conference meet championships[32] and 14 regular-season titles. Home meets 
are held in the MAC Center and the team practices in the MAC Gymnastics 
Center, an annex on the north side of the building which opened in 1979.[33] 
The current coach is Brice Biggin, a Kent State alum of the men's gymnastics 
team who has been coach since 1992. Through the 2013 regular season, he 
has a record of 342-209 at Kent State.[34] * the Ohio state championship 
was held prior to the Mid-American Conference adding gymnastics as a sport. 
Occasionally the three remaining Division I teams in Ohio will hold the 
"All-Ohio Meet".[37] The softball team plays its home games at the Diamond 
at Dix, adjacent to Dix Stadium. The team has won six regular season MAC 
titles and 10 MAC East Division titles, the most recent in 2016, and two 
MAC Tournament championships, with the most recent in 2008. In 1990, the 
team went 43-9 en route to their first MAC title, an NCAA regional championship, 
and a berth in the Women's College World Series. The head coach since August 
2015 is Eric Oakley, who came to the program in 2014 as an assistant. The 
team was established in 1976 and began regular-season play in the Mid-American 
Conference in 1982 when the MAC added softball as a conference sport.[38][39] 
The wrestling team is one of Kent State's oldest sports, going back to 
its establishment in 1927.[40] It has historically been one of the school's 
most successful teams, winning multiple conference titles and making a 
series of appearances in the NCAA tournament, finishing as high as 5th 
nationally in both 1941 and 1942.[6] For 42 seasons, the team was led by 
legendary coach Joseph Begala, who compiled a career record of 307-69-5 
and the national reputation as the "winningest wrestling coach" coaching 
Kent State from 1929–1942 and again from 1945 until his retirement in 1971.[41] 
The team has its home meets at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, 
its home venue since 1950.[42] More recently, the Flashes have again received 
national attention appearing in the national top-25 rankings in each of 
the past three seasons[43] and began the 2008–2009 season ranked 23rd.[44] 
The wrestling team is currently led by head coach and Kent State alum Jim 
Andrassy, who has been with the team as a wrestler, graduate assistant, 
and assistant coach since 1990 and as head coach since 2003.[40] In 2011, 
Kent State had its first national champion with Dustin Kilgore at the 197-pound 
class. Additionally, Kent State used to sponsor the following sports, which 
were eliminated due to either budget constraints and/or Title IX compliance: 
The most prominent rival for Kent State is the Akron Zips of the University 
of Akron, located approximately 10 miles (16 km) to the southwest of Kent 
in Akron, Ohio. The earliest athletic meeting between the two schools is 
a men's basketball game on February 19, 1916, in Kent, followed by a baseball 
game later that year, also in Kent. The two schools first met in football 
in 1923. They were conference rivals as members of the Ohio Athletic Conference 
from 1932–1936 and again from 1944–1951. Kent State joined the Mid-American 
Conference in 1951 and Akron joined the MAC in 1992 after transitioning 
to Division I-A in football. The Flashes compete with the Zips in baseball, 
softball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's indoor and outdoor 
track and field, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, 
women's soccer, and women's volleyball. Since 1946, the two football teams 
have competed for the Wagon Wheel trophy. Through the 2015 meeting, Akron 
leads the overall series in football 32–24–2, but Kent State leads the 
series since the Wagon Wheel was contested, 23–21–1. The rivalry in men's 
basketball is an even closer series with Kent State leading the Zips 72–71 
through the 2015–16 season. Since the late 1990s, both teams have been 
consistent contenders for the MAC East, MAC, and MAC Tournament titles, 
so games between the two often have implications in the conference standings 
or in the tournament. Since Akron's first MAC East title in 1998, the two 
teams have combined for eight MAC Tournament championships, eight MAC regular-season 
championships, and 13 MAC East division titles. In 2011, the two schools 
created the Wagon Wheel Challenge, which counts all athletic contests in 
the 15 sports where they compete head-to-head. Through a sponsorship agreement 
with PNC Financial Services it is known as the "PNC Wagon Wheel Challenge". 
Each sport is worth one point, awarded to the winning team. In sports with 
multiple meetings per season, whichever team wins the most games takes 
the full point. If the teams split the season's meetings, each school gets 
a half-point. For sports that only compete against each other as part of 
the conference championship meet, such as cross country, golf, and track 
and field, whichever team finishes higher in the championship meet is awarded 
the point. Games in the respective conference tournaments can also factor 
in to which school receives the point if the teams split their regular-season 
meetings, with the conference tournament meeting acting as a deciding game. 
Kent State took the first four seasons of the challenge, while the Zips 
claimed the overall challenge in 2015–16.[47] Kent State also has a long-standing 
rivalry with the Bowling Green Falcons from Bowling Green State University 
in Bowling Green, Ohio. The two are sister schools, created together by 
the Lowry Bill in 1910, and both have been members of the Mid-American 
Conference since Bowling Green joined in 1952, the season after Kent State. 
While both schools have primary rivals in their immediate geographic regions, 
the two football teams play annually for the Anniversary Award and during 
the 2009–10 season both schools competed for the Centennial Cup to celebrate 
the respective centennial anniversaries of each school. Points were awarded 
for every head-to-head matchup in the 14 sports offered at both schools. 
Kent State won the cup 13.5–7.5.[48] Outside the Mid-American Conference, 
Kent State has established rivalries with the two other NCAA Division I 
programs in Northeast Ohio, the Cleveland State Vikings from Cleveland 
State University, and the Youngstown State Penguins from Youngstown State 
University, both members of the Horizon League. The Flashes and Vikings 
regularly meet in men's and women's basketball, wrestling, and softball, 
and previously had a long-standing series in baseball until the CSU baseball 
program was eliminated in 2011. Kent State and Youngstown State play regularly 
in men's and women's basketball, baseball, and softball, and have played 
periodically in football, where YSU competes in the Football Championship 
Subdivision (FCS). Through 2014, the teams have played 10 times with the
