Minnesota In St. Louis In Tempe, Arizona In Glendale, Arizona The Arizona 
Cardinals are a professional American football franchise based in the Phoenix 
metropolitan area. The Cardinals compete in the National Football League 
as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West 
division. The Cardinals were founded as the Morgan Athletic Club in 1898, 
and are the oldest continuously run professional football team in the United 
States.[4] The Cardinals play their home games at the University of Phoenix 
Stadium, which is located in the northwestern suburb of Glendale, Arizona. 
The team was established in Chicago in 1898 and was a charter member of 
the NFL in 1920. Along with the Chicago Bears, the club is one of two NFL 
charter member franchises still in operation since the league's founding. 
(The Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL 
in 1921). The club then moved to St. Louis in 1960 and played in that city 
through 1987 (sometimes referred to as the "Football Cardinals" or the 
"Big Red" to avoid confusion with the Major League Baseball St. Louis Cardinals). 
Before the 1988 season, the team moved west to Tempe, Arizona, a college 
suburb east of Phoenix, and played their home games for the next 18 seasons 
at Arizona State University's Sun Devil Stadium. In 2006, the club began 
playing all home games at the newly constructed University of Phoenix Stadium 
in Glendale, although the team's training facility is in Tempe. The franchise 
has won two NFL championships, both while it was based in Chicago. The 
first occurred in 1925, but is the subject of controversy, with supporters 
of the Pottsville Maroons believing that Pottsville should have won the 
title. Their second title, and the first to be won in a championship game, 
came in 1947, nearly two decades before the first Super Bowl. They returned 
to the title game to defend in 1948, but lost the rematch 7–0 in a snowstorm 
in Philadelphia. Since winning the championship in 1947, the team suffered 
many losing seasons, and currently holds the longest active championship 
drought of North American sports at 68 consecutive seasons. In 2012 the 
Cardinals became the first NFL franchise to lose 700 games since its inception. 
The franchise's all-time win-loss record (including regular season and 
playoff games) at the conclusion of the 2015 season is 542–733–39 (535–724–39 
in the regular season, 7–9 in the playoffs).[5] They have been to the playoffs 
ten times and have won seven playoff games, three of which were victories 
during their run in the 2008–09 NFL playoffs. During that season, they 
won their only NFC Championship Game since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, and 
reached Super Bowl XLIII. The team has also won five division titles (1974, 
1975, 2008, 2009 and 2015) since their 1947–1948 NFL championship game 
appearances. The Cardinals are the only NFL team who have never lost a 
playoff game at home, with a 5-0 record: the 1947 NFL Championship Game, 
two postseason victories during the aforementioned 2008–09 NFL playoffs, 
one during the 2009-10 playoffs, and one during the 2015–16 playoffs. From 
1988 through 2012 (except 2005, when they trained in Prescott), the Cardinals 
conducted their annual summer training camp at Northern Arizona University 
in Flagstaff. The Cardinals moved their training camp to University of 
Phoenix Stadium in 2013. The stadium was the site of the 2015 Pro Bowl, 
unlike in past years, where it was held at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
The stadium also played host to Super Bowls XLII and XLIX. The franchise's 
inception dates back to 1898, when a neighborhood group gathered to play 
in the Chicago South Side, calling themselves Morgan Athletic Club. Chicago 
painting and building contractor Chris O'Brien acquired the team, which 
he relocated to Normal Field on Racine Avenue. The team was known as Racine 
Normals until 1901, when O'Brien bought used jerseys from the University 
of Chicago. He described the faded maroon clothing as "Cardinal red" and 
the team became the Racine Street Cardinals. The team eventually became 
in 1920 a charter member of the American Professional Football Association 
(APFA), which two years later was rechristened to National Football League 
(NFL). The team entered the league as the Racine Cardinals, however the 
name was changed in 1922 to Chicago Cardinals to avoid confusion with the 
Horlick-Racine Legion who entered the league the same year.[6] Except for 
1925, when they were awarded the championship after the Pottsville Maroons 
were suspended, the Cardinals experienced only minimal success on the playing 
field during their first 26 seasons in the league. During the post-World 
War II years, the team reached two straight NFL finals against the Philadelphia 
Eagles, winning in 1947 – eight months after the death of owner Charles 
Bidwill – and losing the 1948 NFL Championship Game the following year. 
After years of bad seasons and losing fans to the cross-town rivals Chicago 
Bears, by the late 1950s the Cardinals were almost bankrupt, and owner 
Violet Bidwill Wolfner became interested in a relocation. Due to the formation 
of the rival American Football League, the NFL allowed Bidwill to relocate 
the team to St. Louis, Missouri, where they became the St. Louis Cardinals 
(locally, they were called the "Big Red" or the "Football Cardinals" in 
order to avoid confusion with the baseball team).[7] During the Cardinals' 
28-year stay in St. Louis, they advanced to the playoffs just three times 
(1974, 1975 & 1982), never hosting or winning in any appearance. The overall 
mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with a then-21-year-old stadium, 
caused game attendance to dwindle, and owner Bill Bidwill decided to move 
the team to Arizona. Not long after the 1987 NFL season, Bidwill agreed 
to move to the Phoenix metropolitan area on a handshake deal with state 
and local officials, and the team became the Phoenix Cardinals.[8] The 
franchise changed its geographic name from Phoenix to Arizona on March 
17, 1994.[9] The 1998 NFL season made the Cardinals break two long droughts, 
qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in 16 years, and by winning 
the Wild Card Playoffs, getting their first postseason win since 1947. 
Ten years later, the Cardinals won the NFC Championship Game to advance 
to the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history. They lost Super 
Bowl XLIII 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the final seconds.[10] Starting 
in 1947, the team had a logo of a cardinal bird perched on the stitches 
of a football. The Cardinals moved to Arizona in 1988, and the flag of 
Arizona was added to the sleeves the following year. In 1990, the team 
began wearing red pants with their white jerseys, as new coach Joe Bugel 
wanted to emulate his former employer, the Washington Redskins, who at 
the time wore burgundy pants with their white jerseys (the Redskins later 
returned to their 1970s gold pants with all their jerseys). In 1994, the 
Cardinals participated in the NFL's 75th anniversary throwback uniform 
program. The jerseys were similar to those of the 1920s Chicago Cardinals, 
with an interlocking "CC" logo and three stripes on each sleeve. The uniform 
numbers were relocated to the right chest. The pants were khaki to simulate 
the color and material used in that era. The Cardinals also stripped the 
logos from their helmets for the two games, at Cleveland (Sept. 18) and 
home vs. Pittsburgh (Oct. 30). The Cardinal head on the helmet was repeated 
on the white jersey from 1982 to 1995. In 1996, the state flag of Arizona 
was moved higher on the sleeve after the Cardinal head was eliminated, 
and black was removed as an accent color, instead replaced with a blue 
to match the predominant color of the state flag. In 2002, the Cardinals 
began to wear all-red and all-white combinations, and continued to do so 
through 2004, prior to the team's makeover. In 2005, the team unveiled 
its first major changes in a century. The cardinal-head logo was updated 
to look sleeker and meaner than its predecessor. Numerous fans had derisively 
called the previous version a "parakeet".[11] Black again became an accent 
color after an eight-year absence, while trim lines were added to the outside 
shoulders, sleeves, and sides of the jerseys and pants. Both the red and 
white jerseys have the option of red or white pants.[1] Hoping to break 
a six-game losing streak, the Cardinals wore the red pants for the first 
time on October 29, 2006, in a game at Lambeau Field against the Green 
Bay Packers. The Packers won 31–14, and the Cards headed into their bye 
week with a 1–7 mark. Following the bye week, the Cardinals came out in 
an all-red combination at home against the Dallas Cowboys and lost, 27–10. 
Arizona did not wear the red pants for the remainder of the season and 
won four of their last seven games. However, the following season, in 2007, 
the Cardinals again wore their red pants for their final 3 home games. 
They wore red pants with white jerseys in games on the road at the Cincinnati 
Bengals and Seattle Seahawks. They paired red pants with red jerseys, the 
all-red combination, for home games against the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 
49ers, Cleveland Browns, and St. Louis Rams. The red pants were not worn 
at all in 2008, but they were used in home games vs. Seattle, Minnesota, 
and St. Louis in 2009. The red pants were paired with the white road jersey 
for the first time in three years during a 2010 game at Carolina, but the 
white jersey/red pants combination has not been used since. The Cardinals' 
first home game in Arizona, in 1988, saw them play in red jerseys. Thereafter, 
for the next 18 years in Arizona, the Cardinals, like a few other NFL teams 
in warm climates, wore their white jerseys at home during the first half 
of the season—forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys during 
Arizona autumns that frequently see temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C). However, 
this tradition did not continue when the Cardinals moved from Sun Devil 
Stadium to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2006, as early-season games 
(and some home games late in the season) were played with the roof closed. 
With the temperature inside at a comfortable 70 °F (21 °C), the team opted 
to wear red jerseys at home full-time. The Cardinals wore white jerseys 
at home for the first time in University of Phoenix Stadium on August 29, 
2008, in a preseason game against the Denver Broncos. The Cardinals wore 
white at home for the first time in a regular season game at University 
of Phoenix Stadium against the Houston Texans on October 11, 2009. In October 
2009, the NFL recognized Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and players wore 
pink-accented items, including gloves, wristbands, and shoes. The team 
thought the pink accents looked better with white uniforms than with red.[12] 
From 1970 through 1983, and again in many seasons between 1989 and 2002, 
the Cardinals would wear white when hosting the Dallas Cowboys in order 
to force the Cowboys to don their "jinxed"[clarification needed] blue jerseys. 
They have not done this since moving into University of Phoenix Stadium, 
however.[citation needed] The 2010 season saw the Cardinals debut a new, 
alternate black jersey.[13] Prior to its introduction, the Cardinals were 
the only NFL team without an alternate jersey or throwback kit, save for 
the NFL's 75th anniversary program in 1994.[14] Points Scored: 489 (2015)

was KMVP AM, "ESPN Radio 860." KMVP assumed the broadcast rights in 2006 
after many years on KSLX-FM and KDUS. Dave Pasch, Ron Wolfley, and Paul 
Calvisi handle the radio broadcast. Most preseason games are televised 
on KNXV, channel 15, the local ABC affiliate. For regular season games, 
it can be aired on the Fox O&O affiliate KSAZ-TV, CBS affiliate KPHO-TV 
when they host an AFC Team, and KPNX, the local NBC station for Sunday 
Night Football. On New Year's Day 2007, KMVP began a simulcast of KTAR, 
which switched to an all-sports format (the news/talk station became 92.3, 
KTAR-FM). For the 2007 season, KTAR was the official flagship station; 
however, some broadcasts were also heard on 92.3 FM because of conflicts 
with Arizona Diamondbacks baseball games on 620 AM. In January 2014, Bonneville 
International, owners of KTAR and KMVP, created Arizona Sports 98.7 (KMVP-FM), 
a new local FM sports talk outlet. All Cardinals games in 2014 and beyond 
have been heard on KMVP-FM. Spanish-language radio broadcasts are heard 
on the combo of KQMR/KHOV-FM "Latino Mix" under a contract with Univisión, 
signed in 2015.[16] Prior to 2015, they were heard on KDVA/KVVA-FM "José 
FM", as well as co-owned KBMB AM 710. The Cardinals were the first NFL 
team to offer all 20 preseason and regular season games on Spanish-language 
radio, doing so in 2000. Gabriel Trujillo and Rolando Cantú are the Spanish 
broadcast team. The Cardinals have the most extensive Mexican affiliate 
network in the NFL, with contracts with Grupo Larsa (in the state of Sonora) 
and Grupo Radiorama (outside Sonora) and stations in 20 cities, including 
Hermosillo, Guadalajara and Mexico City. Cardinals Radio Affiliates Due 
to Phoenix's high temperature and strong sunshine in early September, eight 
of the team's first 13 home openers in Arizona were held, at earliest, 
in week three. In 1989, 1990 and 1991, the Cardinals opened with three 
consecutive road games before finally coming home in week four. For the 
same reason, the team's home opener was a nationally televised night game 
(two Monday Night Football games and 11 Sunday Night Football (ESPN) games) 
from 1988 to 2001. The team hosted nine straight home openers as Sunday 
Night Football games from 1990 to 1998. In 2001, the NFL schedule and the 
September 11 attacks allowed the Cardinals to play their first two games 
at home. Since the NFL had an odd number of teams (31) from 1999 through 
2001, there had to be at least one bye in every week of the season. In 
2001, the Cardinals' bye was week one. They were scheduled to travel to 
Washington in week two, but the game was postponed due to the terrorist 
attacks and moved to the very end of the slate. The Cardinals' scheduled 
home opener, a Sunday Night Football game vs. Denver, became the season 
opener, the only time Arizona played its season opener at home when it 
resided at Sun Devil Stadium. Arizona also played at home the next week 
vs. Atlanta. Patrick Daniel "Pat" Tillman (November 6, 1976 – April 22, 
2004) was an American football player who left his professional career 
while with the Arizona Cardinals and enlisted in the United States Army 
in June 2002 in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. His service 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, and subsequent death, were the subject of much
