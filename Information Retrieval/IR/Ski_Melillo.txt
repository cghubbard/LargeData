As player As manager Oscar Donald "Ski" Melillo (August 4, 1899 – November 
14, 1963) was an American second baseman and coach in Major League Baseball. 
He briefly served as manager of the St. Louis Browns in 1938 and was also 
a member of the coaching staff for the Cleveland Indians' 1948 World Series 
championship team. A native of Chicago Illinois, Melillo reached the majors 
in 1926 with the Browns, spending nine and a half years with them before 
moving to the Boston Red Sox (1935–37). Basically a line-drive hitter, 
he enjoyed a good year in 1929 ending with a .296 batting average in 141 
games, hitting for the cycle on May 23. His most productive season came 
in 1931, when he hit .306 with five home runs, 88 runs, 189 hits, 34 doubles 
and 11 triples, all career numbers, while adding 75 runs batted in, a significant 
offensive contribution for a middle infielder of his era. Listed at 5 feet 
8 inches (173 cm) tall and 150 pounds (68 kg; 11 st), he batted and threw 
right-handed. A fine defensive second baseman, in 1930 Melillo handled 
971 chances without committing an error (17 fewer that Nap Lajoie's 1908 
MLB record). In 1933, he hit .292 with a career-high 79 RBI and posted 
a .991 fielding average that stood for more than 10 years. In a 12-season 
career, Melillo was a .260 hitter (1,316-for-5,063) with 22 home runs and 
548 RBI in 1,377 games, including 590 runs, 210 doubles, 64 triples, and 
69 stolen bases. Following his playing retirement, Melillo became a coach 
for the Browns in 1938. That season, he received his only chance to manage 
at the Major League level when he became a late-season replacement for 
Gabby Street. Melillo finished with a 2–7 mark (.222) as the Browns lost 
97 games and placed seventh in the eight-team American League. He later 
served as a coach for the Indians under Oscar Vitt and Lou Boudreau (1939–40; 
1942; 1945–48; 1950). After the 1947 season, he was dropped from Boudreau's 
coaching staff at the insistence of owner Bill Veeck.[1] Melillo spent 
part of 1948 managing in the Indians' farm system, but returned to Cleveland 
to serve part of the year as an aide to Boudreau for the 1948 world champions. 
After spending the 1949 season as a minor league manager, he coached under 
Boudreau in 1950, his final year with the Indians, then again with the 
Red Sox (1952–53) and Kansas City Athletics (1955–56). Melillo died of
