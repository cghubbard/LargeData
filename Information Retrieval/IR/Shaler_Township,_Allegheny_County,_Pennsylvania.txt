Shaler Township is a township in Allegheny County in the U.S. state of 
Pennsylvania. It consists of much of the community of Glenshaw and several 
neighboring communities. The population was 28,757 at the 2010 census. 
Traders began settling in the Shaler area in the mid-18th century. The 
most prominent early trader in the area was George Croghan, who came in 
the early 1740s. By 1754, settlement included the Pine Creek trading post, 
where Europeans traded fur and skins with the Mingo and other Native Americans 
in the Ohio Valley. The second early European settlement was Girty's Run, 
established by Simon Girty.[1] The village of Glenshaw, Pennsylvania—at 
the center of what became Shaler Township—was established in the early 
19th century, beginning with a log sawmill built by John Shaw, Sr. after 
he bought 600 acres (2.4 km2) of land north of Pittsburgh in 1800. The 
area became known as "Shaw's Glen", and later Glenshaw. Members of the 
Shaw family subsequently built a log gristmill, a sickle factory, and a 
coal mine.[2] On March 20, 1845, a petition to form a new township from 
portions of Ross and Indiana townships was presented to the Court of Quarter 
Sessions. Col. James A. Gibson, Alexander V. Brackenridge and John Murray 
were appointed as viewers. They reported in favor on June 10 of the same 
year, although it was two years later on March 20, 1847 that the court 
decree establishing the township was issued, in the name of Marion.[3] 
While the township was initially confirmed with the name Marion; on the 
same day the name was changed to Shaler, after Charles Shaler, a prominent 
mid-19th century Pittsburgh area judge, who served as President Judge of 
the 5th District Court in Beaver County.[4] The township is not named for 
the numerous deposits of shale rock found within its borders; this is instead 
a common misconception. At the time of establishment, Shaler Township encompassed 
all of its current holdings plus the boroughs of Etna, Millvale, and a 
large tract of Ross Township. By 1868, Shaler lost much of its land to 
the new boroughs. In 1900, Shaler became one of the early townships to 
be classified as a township of the first class. The township's boundaries 
remain basically the same today as they were in 1900. Early settlement 
of the Shaler area was sporadic, with small farming and mercantile villages 
appearing. These mainly developed in the valleys next to Pine Creek and 
Girtys Run. At the time of its incorporation, Shaler Township had a population 
of 2,000; by 1860 it had grown to 16,399.[2] In the late 19th century, 
the creation of the Glenshaw Glass plant sped up settlement to a certain 
degree, drawing workers to settle in the vicinity. From 1907 until 1931 
the interurban Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway passed through the 
township, linking it with Pittsburgh and Butler. Following the Second World 
War Shaler became an affluent suburb with many former City of Pittsburgh 
residents now populating the Township. Shaler, along with Ross Township, 
was among the first outer-city areas to develop into the modern suburbs 
which today define the North Hills region of Allegheny County. Home building 
and development during this time period was extensive. Shaler remained 
and still remains a primarily residential municipality, and it was during 
this period which the Township came to acquire the attributes it still 
holds today. Shaler Township is located at 40°31′15″N 79°57′49″W﻿ / ﻿40.52083°N 
79.96361°W﻿ / 40.52083; -79.96361 (40.520926, -79.963784).[5] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 11.2 square 
miles (29.0 km²), of which, 11.0 square miles (28.5 km²) of it is land 
and 0.2 square miles (0.5 km²) of it (1.70%) is water. Shaler is largely 
hilly, with three stream valleys which run from the north into the Allegheny 
River: the valleys of Pine Creek and Little Pine Creek converge in the 
Pittsburgh borough of Etna, while the valley of Girtys Run goes from Shaler 
into the borough of Millvale.[6] Bordering Shaler Township, starting from 
the north and going clockwise on the map, are Hampton Township, Indiana 
Township, O'Hara Township, Sharpsburg, Etna, Pittsburgh, Millvale, Reserve 
Township, and Ross Township. Although Shaler does not share a border with 
McCandless Township it is opposed diagonally to Shaler in the northwest.
