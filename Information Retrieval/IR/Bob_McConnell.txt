Robert Churchill McConnell (January 18, 1925 â€“ March 18, 2012) was a founding 
member of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), serving as 
its secretary and treasurer. In 1985, he won the first Bob Davids Award, 
SABR's highest honor.[1] McConnell was born on January 18, 1925 in Seattle, 
Washington, though he moved around continuously throughout his youth. His 
family settled in Newark, New Jersey in 1935. He joined the Navy in 1942, 
serving on the U.S.S. Whitman and U.S.S. Mifflin during his first three 
years in the service. He was sent for officer training at Vanderbilt University 
in July 1945, whence he earned a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering 
in 1949.[2] McConnell is credited with finding, filling in and fixing considerable 
amounts of missing, incomplete or incorrect historical baseball information, 
especially that concerning home runs.[2] His work largely included seeking 
out old box scores, gleaning statistics and details from those, his new 
findings and sharing them with other baseball research enthusiasts - many 
of whom would be among the founding SABR members. Considered an expert 
on home runs, he co-wrote the book The Home Run Encyclopedia.[3] His expertise 
was cited by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Associated Press and The Press 
of Atlantic City, among others.[4][5][6] He died on March 18, 2012 in Newark,
