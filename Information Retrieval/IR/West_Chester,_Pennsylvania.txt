West Chester is a borough and the county seat of Chester County, Pennsylvania 
in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.[1] The population was 18,461 at the 
2010 census.[2] West Chester University of Pennsylvania is located in the 
borough. Valley Forge, the Brandywine Battlefield, Marsh Creek State Park, 
and other historical attractions are nearby, as are Longwood Gardens, the 
Brandywine River Museum, and Christian C. Sanderson Museum. The area was 
originally known as Turk's Head — after the inn of the same name located 
in what is now the center of the borough.[3] West Chester has been the 
seat of government in Chester County since 1786, and the borough incorporated 
in 1799.[4] In the heart of town is its courthouse, a classical revival 
building designed in the 1840s by Thomas U. Walter, one of the architects 
for the Capitol in Washington, D.C.[5] In the 18th century West Chester 
was a center of clockmaking. In the late 19th century the Hoopes, Bro. 
and Darlington company became a major wheelworks, first for wagons and 
later automobiles.[6][7] In the early 20th century, an important industry 
was the Sharples cream separator company.[8] In the late 20th century, 
Commodore International, one of the pioneers of home computers, giving 
its headquarters as West Chester, was located approximately a mile northeast 
of the borough. The West Chester Downtown Historic District was listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Other listed buildings 
are the Bank of Chester County, Buckwalter Building, Butler House, Chester 
County Courthouse, William Everhart Buildings, Farmers and Mechanics Building, 
First Presbyterian Church of West Chester, New Century Clubhouse, Joseph 
Rothrock House, Sharples Homestead, Sharples Separator Works, Warner Theater, 
West Chester Boarding School for Boys, and the components of the West Chester 
State College Quadrangle Historic District.[9] West Goshen Township borders 
West Chester to the north, south, and east, while East Bradford Township 
borders West Chester to the west. The borough straddles the Brandywine 
Creek and Chester Creek watersheds.[10] It is located 25 miles (40 km) 
west of Philadelphia and 17 miles (27 km) north of Wilmington, Delaware. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area 
of 1.8 square miles (5 km2), all of it land. As with much of Eastern Pennsylvania 
east of the Appalachian mountains, West Chester straddles the humid continental 
(Köppen: Dfa ) and humid subtropical (Köppen: Cfa ) climate zones, with 
generally more characteristics of the former than the latter.[11] Summers 
are hot and humid and winters are cold but variable. Annual high temperatures

QVC has its headquarters and television studios in West Goshen Township,[20][21] 
near West Chester. It is located in the same buildings that were once the 
corporate headquarters of Commodore International. Electronics Boutique, 
when it existed as an independent company, had its headquarters in West 
Goshen Township,[22][23] in proximity to West Chester.[21][24] Among the 
major shopping centers in the area is Bradford Plaza, a 22-acre property 
with a 161,000-square foot center which sold in 2014 to New York Life for 
US$35,700,000.[25] The West Chester Public Library has provided library 
services to area residents since 1872. It currently has a collection of 
50,000 items and receives 110,000 visits every year.[26] The Francis Harvey 
Green Library on the university campus has additional collections.[27] 
The Daily Local News is a daily newspaper headquartered in West Chester 
that covers Chester County events.[28] The Quad is the student-run newspaper 
of West Chester University. Beginning in 1932, it covers not only campus 
events but also regional and national news.[29] Radio station WCUR broadcasts 
from the borough and is managed by university students.[30] The main east-west 
road to West Chester is West Chester Pike, which begins in Upper Darby, 
Delaware County, just outside Philadelphia, and is part of PA 3.[40] The 
West Chester Pike originally existed as a private turnpike connecting Philadelphia 
and West Chester between 1850 and 1918, at which time it became a public 
road.[41] In West Chester, PA 3 follows Market Street eastbound and Gay 
Street westbound. The main north-south road in West Chester is High Street. 
To the north of town, the road is known as Pottstown Pike, which connects 
to PA 100 in Exton (PA 100 formerly ran through town). To the south of 
town, the road is known as Wilmington-West Chester Pike (US 202 and US 
322). US 202 and US 322 both bypass the center of West Chester on the limited-access 
West Chester Bypass, with US 202 heading northeast to King of Prussia and 
south to Wilmington, Delaware and US 322 heading northwest to Downingtown 
and southeast to Chester. US 322 Business passes through West Chester along 
Hannum Avenue, Chestnut and Market streets, and South High Street. Other 
state routes serving West Chester include PA 162 and PA 842, which head 
west towards Unionville, and PA 52, which heads southwest towards Kennett 
Square.[40] West Chester is home to the West Chester Transportation Center, 
which serves as a parking garage for the Chester County Justice Center 
and a bus terminal, which is located on the lower level of the facility. 
Two of SEPTA's suburban bus routes serve West Chester. The Route 92 bus 
connects West Chester to the Exton Square Mall and the King of Prussia 
Mall while the Route 104 bus runs between West Chester University and the 
69th Street Transportation Center, mostly following West Chester Pike.[42] 
The Route 104 bus replaced a trolley service that connected West Chester 
to Philadelphia along the West Chester Pike between 1898 and the 1950s.[41] 
West Chester is also served by the Transportation Association of Chester 
County's SCCOOT, which provides service to Kennett Square and Oxford, and 
Krapf's Transit's Route A, which provides service to Exton, Downingtown, 
and Coatesville.[42] Until September 1986, West Chester was served by SEPTA's 
R3 commuter rail line, then known as the Media/West Chester line. Service 
on the line was discontinued because of poor track conditions west of the 
Elwyn station. At the time, SEPTA had limited funds for the necessary repairs, 
and offered Chester County the option of either improving the rail line 
or expanding parking availability at the nearby Exton station on SEPTA's 
Paoli/Thorndale Line. The county opted for the latter and service on the 
line was cut back to its current terminus of Elwyn. The rail line into 
West Chester is used by the West Chester Railroad, a heritage railroad. 
The oldest continuous running cab company in the area is Rainbow Cab and 
Limousine, which offers an 85% discount for Seniors, has been in operation 
since 1952 (under other names.) The borough is governed by the town council 
form of government. Led by the Borough Manager, there are seven council 
members each representing one of the seven voting wards. The council controls 
all departments except the Police Department (the Mayor directs Police 
Department activities through the Chief of Police). The mayor and council 
members are directly elected by borough voters. In January 2010, Carolyn 
Comitta took office as the borough's 58th Mayor. In succeeding the term-limited 
incumbent, Republican Dick Yoder,[44] Comitta became West Chester's first 
ever female Mayor, and the first Democrat to hold the office since 1992.[45]
