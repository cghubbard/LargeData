The Asahi were a Japanese-Canadian baseball team established in 1914. The 
team went on to great success, particularly in the 1930s, winning numerous 
tournaments and championships. The team was based in Vancouver's Oppenheimer 
Park, in the cityâ€™s Japantown. The team was disbanded when its members 
were dispersed across Canada due to the Japanese-Canadian internment during 
World War II. The team was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 2003[1] and the BC Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.[2] The team was 
designated an Event of National Historic Significance in 2008, with a plaque 
unveiled in Oppenheimer Park on September 18, 2011. (the 70th anniversary 
of the Asahi's last game) In December 2014, a Japanese studio released 
a period drama called Vancouver Asahi starring Satoshi Tsumabuki and Kazuya 
Kamenashi. Jari Osborne directed a 2003 documentary about the team, Sleeping 
Tigers: The Asahi Baseball Story. Produced by the National Film Board of 
Canada, the documentary combines archival film and dramatic recreations, 
along with interviews with the last of the Asahi. The 50 minute film garnered 
four awards including a Rockie Award for Best Sports Program at the Banff 
Television Festival and a Golden Sheaf Award.[3][4] Vancouver Asahi at
