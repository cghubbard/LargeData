Robert Vavasour Ferguson (January 31, 1845 – May 3, 1894) was an American 
infielder, league official, manager and umpire in the early days of baseball, 
playing both before and after baseball became a professional sport.[1] 
In addition to playing and managing, he served as president of the National 
Association of Professional Base Ball Players from 1872 through 1875, the 
sport's first entirely professional league. His character and unquestioned 
honesty were highly regarded during a period in baseball history where 
the game's reputation was badly damaged by gamblers and rowdy behavior 
by players and fans.[2] However, his bad temper and stubbornness were traits 
that created trouble for him at times during his career, and caused him 
to be disliked by many.[2] His nickname, "Death to Flying Things",[3] was 
derived from his greatness as a defensive player.[4] A native of Brooklyn, 
Ferguson played for two of New York's earliest semi-professional clubs 
in the late 1860s and early 1870s, the Atlantics and Mutuals.[4] On June 
14, 1870, Ferguson provided the hit that created the tying run and he later 
scored the winning run in a match against the famous Cincinnati Red Stockings, 
the first team that was composed entirely of professional players. This 
win brought to an end the Red Stockings' 81 consecutive game winning streak.[2] 
He is credited with being the first player to bat from both sides of home 
plate, known as switch-hitting, but the practice was not popular at first.[5] 
Among the explanations for this, it is claimed that, due to his personality, 
players did not want to emulate him.[5] Managers, however, recognized the 
practice's importance soon after, and began to play their players according 
to the opposing pitcher that day, known today as platooning, and the advantages 
that switch-hitting posed would later become accepted strategic baseball 
philosophy, and many players began to experiment with the idea.[5] In 1871, 
Ferguson took over the Mutual team as the player-manager. In 33 games, 
he batted .241, while the team finished with a 16–17 record, which put 
them in fifth place at the season's end.[1] As manager, Ferguson insisted 
upon implicit obedience from his men, but was forced to leave following 
the season due to heavy rumors of gambling surrounding the team.[2] For 
the 1872 season, Ferguson re-joined his Atlantics team, which was now a 
member of the National Association as well, and he would stay there through 
the 1874 season.[1] In 1872, he was elected by the players to be the president 
of the National Association, an office he held through the 1875 season, 
the last season of the Association.[4] On September 1, 1872, Ferguson arranged 
a benefit game for Al Thake, a 22-year-old left fielder for the Atlantics, 
who drowned during a fishing trip off Fort Hamilton, in New York Harbor. 
The old Brooklyn Atlantics and Members of the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings 
played against each other in the benefit game.[2] While serving as a substitute 
umpire during a game between the Baltimore Canaries and Mutuals on July 
24, 1873, Ferguson received continuous, loud, verbal abuse from Mutuals 
catcher Nat Hicks.[2] Ferguson and Hicks got into an altercation at the 
conclusion of the game, which Ferguson ended by hitting Hicks in the left 
arm with a bat, breaking his arm in two places. Ferguson required a police 
escort to leave the playing field, and Hicks refused to press charges and 
the two reconciled afterwards.[2] During the final season of the Association, 
he played and managed the Hartford Dark Blues.[1] When the Association 
dissolved, his Hartford team was accepted into the National League for 
its inaugural season in 1876,[1] and Ferguson became a League Director.[2] 
As a league official, he was involved in a landmark decision that season. 
The case involved Jim Devlin, pitcher for the Louisville Grays. Devlin 
wanted to be released from his contract, claiming that Louisville had failed 
to fulfill the terms of his contract.[2] Surrounding Devlin were rumors 
that he took money from gamblers to throw games, known in the day as "hippodroming". 
Ferguson, along with fellow league directors, ruled in favor of the Grays' 
Vice-President Charles Chase, and Devlin was ordered to remain with the 
Grays. The following season, Devlin and three other teammates, SS/2B Bill 
Craver, OF George Hall and 3B Al Nichols would receive life suspensions 
for throwing games. Devlin attempted to gain reinstatement for a number 
of years, but this was never granted.[2] The Dark Blues had turned to Ferguson 
to play for and manage the team because of his reputation as the most authoritarian 
captain in the game. He was an honest and upstanding citizen in a time 
when not many ballplayers could say the same. However, he was also a domineering, 
dictatorial captain with a violent streak.[6] Team discipline did improve 
in his first season, but his overbearing ways proved divisive, causing 
the team to bicker amongst themselves. Ferguson's temper would flare up 
often, even when the team was winning.[6] The Chicago Tribune reported 
that if anyone on the Hartford nine committed an error, "Ferguson [would] 
swear until everything looks blue."[6] He was particularly rough on second 
baseman Jack Burdock, who on more than one occasion heard his captain publicly 
threaten "to ram his fist down Burdock's throat."[6] Some players tolerated 
his behavior; others, however, refused to comply. Shortstop Tom Carey and 
center fielder Jack Remsen did not hesitate to yell back, while Burdock 
and pitcher Candy Cummings, on the other hand, often sulked.[6] The situation 
in Hartford came to a head after a tough loss to the Red Stockings, a game 
in which Ferguson had committed several errors. Hartford's main pitcher, 
Tommy Bond, suggested that Ferguson was "crooked". Ferguson denied the 
charge, and Bond quickly retracted his statement, claiming that he said 
it in anger.[6] Bond then requested that he be able to leave the team because 
he could not play for Ferguson, a request that was granted by league president 
Morgan Bulkeley, a former owner of the Dark Blues.[6] Hartford finished 
third in both of its two seasons in the National League,[1] and when the 
team folded, Ferguson became the new Chicago White Stockings player-manager. 
It would be his only season in Chicago.[1] Al Spalding had hired Ferguson 
to captain his Chicago team because of his reputation, openly saying that 
he admired Ferguson's style and leadership that made the Hartford teams 
successful.[2] Ferguson personally had his most successful season as a 
player that season, as he batted .351, which was third in the league, led 
the league in on-base percentage, tied for fourth in runs batted in, and 
ranked fourth in hits.[2] Unfortunately, the White Stockings finished at 
.500, and in Spalding's memoirs he called Ferguson "tactless" and hopelessly 
lacking any knowledge "of the subtle science of handling men by strategy 
rather than by force."[2] Cap Anson would eventually take over that role 
in 1879.[7] Ferguson again moved on, this time accepting the player-manager 
role with the new Troy Trojans team who began their time in the National 
League in 1879, and would stay in that role until the team folded after 
the 1882 season.[1] In 1883, he became the first manager in the history 
of the Philadelphia Phillies franchise, which was known at the time as 
the Quakers, but was relieved of command when the team won only four of 
its first 17 games.[1] On August 21 of that season, his Quakers traveled 
to Providence, Rhode Island to play the Grays. To increase ticket sales, 
he gave the day's pitching duty to Rhode Island native Art Hagan in hopes 
that Hagan's appearance would attract more locals to come watch the game.[2] 
The strategy worked, but Hagen surrendered 28 runs and the Quakers made 
20 errors behind him and did not score a run. Financially sound decision 
as it was, a bad decision for public relations as Ferguson was labeled 
a sadist for not relieving Hagen.[2] Ferguson's last two managerial positions 
were in the American Association. He was player-manager for the Pittsburgh 
Alleghenys, who later became the Pittsburgh Pirates, in 1884 and later 
took over the managerial role for parts of two seasons with the New York 
Metropolitans.[1] Overall, as manager, his teams won 417 games and lost 
516, for a winning percentage of .447, and never finished higher than the 
third-place finishes his Trojans achieved. The totals reflect his time 
in the National Association as well as the National League and American 
Association.[1] Ferguson had, on numerous occasions during his playing 
and managerial career, served as a substitute umpire, but did not start 
doing it full-time until after his departure from Philadelphia. In 1888, 
he became a full-time professional umpire, working in the American Association, 
and later in the Players' League in 1890.[1] By the end of the 1890 season 
he had passed Kick Kelly to take over the record for career games as an 
umpire with 650; John Gaffney surpassed his final total of 786 in 1893. 
Ferguson officially umpired 804 games if his National Association games 
are taken into account, and his career came to a close after the 1891 season.[1] 
On his umpiring philosophy, he once stated "Umpiring always came as easy 
to me", he said, "as sleeping on a featherbed. Never change a decision, 
never stop to talk to a man. Make 'em play ball and keep their mouths shut, 
and never fear but the people will be on your side and you'll be called 
the king of umpires."[8] Ferguson died in Brooklyn of apoplexy at the age 
of 49.[4] Initially buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, 
he was later reinterred in Cypress Hills Cemetery, also in the borough 
of Brooklyn.[1] Despite his career that was filled with incidents of turmoil 
between him and his players and other baseball people, his funeral, which 
was held at his home, was quickly crowded, as was the front stoop. Eventually,
