Roy Duane Ward (born May 28, 1964) is a former Major League Baseball relief 
pitcher who played with the Atlanta Braves and Toronto Blue Jays. Ward 
went to school and made his early athletic mark in Farmington, New Mexico, 
a small oil and gas city, and one known for its amateur baseball programs. 
Ward thrived in the American Amateur Baseball Congress-sponsored baseball 
leagues and graduated from Farmington High School, home of the Scorpions. 
He was drafted out of high school in 1982. Ward also starred in the Connie 
Mack World Series, a baseball tournament for 18-and-under players that 
has been hosted in Farmington since 1965. Since 1988, Ward has lived in 
Las Vegas, Nevada. A hard-throwing pitcher, Ward was drafted with the ninth 
pick in the 1st round of the 1982 amateur draft by the Atlanta Braves. 
He is tied with Jim Kremmel (1971) for the second-highest draft pick of 
players hailing from New Mexico, behind shortstop Alex Bregman, who was 
selected with the second pick in the first round of the 2015 MLB draft.[1] 
He made his major league debut on April 12, 1986, but after limited success 
was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays on July 6 for pitcher Doyle Alexander. 
Ward became one of the Jays' most dependable middle relievers in 1988, 
and remained in the role through the 1992 season, when the Blue Jays won 
their first World Series championship. His pitching repertoire featured 
a live, mid-90s fastball and a hard slider. After years of being in Tom 
Henke's shadow, Ward took over the closer's role in 1993. In the regular 
season, Ward set Toronto's single-season team record for saves with 45. 
He was tied with Jeff Montgomery of the Kansas City Royals for most saves 
in the American League. Ward was the closing pitcher for the American League 
in its 9-3 victory at the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game; however, 
constant booing and demand for Mike Mussina of the host Baltimore Orioles 
cost Ward his save. In helping the Blue Jays repeat as World Series Champions 
in 1993 Ward reached the peak of his career and, unexpectedly, the last 
significant duty of this career. In the 1993 World Series, Ward earned 
two saves over Philadelphia, in Game 1 (8-5 save, in Toronto) and in the 
wild Toronto 15-14 victory in Game 4 in Philadelphia, when Ward got the 
last four outs after Toronto scored the final six runs of the game. Ward 
was the winning pitcher for the decisive Game 6 in which his teammates 
came back from behind after he pitched in relief. The rest of Ward's career 
was beset by injuries and he would never save another Major League game 
after 1993.[2] After missing the entire 1994 season due to biceps tendinitis, 
he retired from the Toronto Blue Jays after pitching four games during 
the 1995 season. He finished with a 3.28 ERA and 121 saves. Since 2014, 
Ward has been featured on the Blue Jays' radio broadcasts for Sportsnet 
590 The Fan. He occasionally fills in for regular colour commentator Joe
