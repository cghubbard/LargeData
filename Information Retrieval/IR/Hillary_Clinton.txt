U.S. Secretary of State U.S. Senator from New York First Lady of the United 
States Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton (/ˈhɪləri daɪˈæn ˈrɒdəm ˈklɪntən/; 
born October 26, 1947) is an American politician who served as the First 
Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001 and as the 67th United States 
Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and was the Democratic Party's nominee 
for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Born in Chicago 
and raised in the suburban town of Park Ridge, Illinois, Clinton attended 
Wellesley College, graduating in 1969, and earned a J.D. from Yale Law 
School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved 
to Arkansas and married Bill Clinton in 1975. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas 
Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female 
chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first woman 
partner at Rose Law Firm the following year. As First Lady of Arkansas, 
she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas's public 
schools, and served on several corporate boards. As First Lady of the United 
States, Clinton led the unsuccessful effort to enact the Clinton health 
care plan of 1993. In 1997 and 1999, she helped create the State Children's 
Health Insurance Program. She also tackled the problems of adoption and 
family safety and foster care. At the 1995 UN conference on women (held 
in Beijing), Clinton stated in a then controversial and influential speech, 
that "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights". 
Her marriage survived the Lewinsky scandal of 1998, and her role as first 
lady drew a polarized response from the public. Clinton was elected in 
2000 as the first female senator from New York, the only first lady ever 
to seek elective office. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, 
she voted to approve the war in Afghanistan. She also voted for the Iraq 
Resolution (a vote she later said she regretted). She took a leading role 
in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders. She 
further voted against the Bush tax cuts, and against drilling in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running 
for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female 
candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama. As Secretary 
of State in the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2013, Clinton responded 
to the Arab Spring, during which she advocated the U.S. military intervention 
in Libya. She helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international 
sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that 
country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Leaving office after 
Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements 
before announcing her second presidential run in the 2016 election. Clinton 
received the most votes and primary delegates in the 2016 Democratic primaries, 
formally accepting her party's nomination for President of the United States 
on July 28, 2016, with vice presidential running mate Senator Tim Kaine. 
She became the first female candidate to be nominated for president by 
a major U.S. political party. As part of her 2016 platform, she emphasized 
raising incomes, improvements to the Affordable Care Act and reform of 
campaign finance and Wall Street. She favored allowing pathways to citizenship 
for undocumented immigrants, combating climate change, expanding and protecting 
LGBT and women's rights, and instituting family support through paid parental 
leave and universal preschool. On November 8, 2016, Clinton lost the election 
to Republican rival Donald Trump, failing to obtain a majority in the electoral 
college, despite winning the national popular vote. Hillary[a] Diane Rodham 
was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[2][3] 
She was raised in a United Methodist family, living first in Chicago; when 
she was three, her family moved to Park Ridge, Illinois.[4] Her father, 
Hugh Ellsworth Rodham (1911–1993), was of Welsh and English descent;[5] 
he managed a successful small business in the textile industry.[6] Her 
mother, Dorothy Emma Howell (1919–2011), was a homemaker of English, Scottish, 
French-Canadian, Welsh and Dutch descent.[5][7][8] Hillary has two younger 
brothers, Hugh and Tony.[9] As a child, Rodham was a favorite of her teachers 
at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge.[10] She participated 
in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a 
Brownie and a Girl Scout.[10] She has often told a story[11][12][13] of 
being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter 
to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only 
to be told that no women were being accepted into the program.[14] She 
attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student 
council, the school newspaper, and was selected for the National Honor 
Society.[2][15] She won election as class vice president for her junior 
year, but then lost an election for class president for her senior year 
against two boys, one of whom told her, "you are really stupid if you think 
a girl can be elected president."[16] For her senior year, she and other 
students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where 
she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted "most likely to succeed". 
She graduated in the top five percent of her class of 1965.[17] Rodham's 
mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,[8] and her 
father, otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities 
and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[18] Raised in a politically 
conservative household,[8] Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at 
age thirteen following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, 
where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries 
showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard 
Nixon.[19] She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry 
Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[20] Rodham's early 
political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher 
(like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's 
The Conscience of a Conservative, and by her Methodist youth minister (like 
her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw, 
and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 
at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.[21] In 1965, Rodham enrolled 
at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[22][23] During 
her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans;[24][25] 
with this Rockefeller Republican-oriented group,[26] she supported the 
elections of John Lindsay to Mayor of New York City and Massachusetts Attorney 
General Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[27] She later stepped 
down from this position. Clinton would later write in 2003 that her views 
at this time changed regarding the American Civil Rights Movement and the 
Vietnam War.[24] In a letter to her youth minister at this time, she described 
herself as "a mind conservative and a heart liberal".[28] In contrast to 
the 1960s current that advocated radical actions against the political 
system, she sought to work for change within it.[29][30] In her junior 
year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination 
campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[31] In early 1968, she was elected 
president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through 
early 1969.[29][32] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., 
Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black 
students to recruit more black students and faculty.[31] In her student 
government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled 
in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[29][33] A number of 
her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female 
President of the United States.[29] To help her better understand her changing 
political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at 
the House Republican Conference, and she attended the "Wellesley in Washington" 
summer program.[31] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican 
Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry 
campaign for the Republican nomination.[31] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican 
National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard 
Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the 
convention's "veiled" racist messages, and left the Republican Party for 
good.[31] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of 
radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[34] 
(Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted 
at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. 
The thesis was later released.[34]) In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor 
of Arts,[35] with departmental honors in political science.[34] After some 
fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student 
speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College 
history to speak at the event, following commencement speaker Senator Brooke.[32][36] 
Her speech received a standing ovation lasting seven minutes.[29][37][38] 
She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[39][40] due 
to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[36] 
She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk 
show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[41] That summer, 
she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National 
Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired 
her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).[42] 
Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial 
board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[43] During her second 
year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[44] learning about new 
research on early childhood brain development and working as a research 
assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[45][46] 
She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital[45] and 
volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for 
the poor.[44] In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at 
Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned 
to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she 
researched migrant workers' problems in housing, sanitation, health and 
education.[47] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[48] Rodham was 
recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign 
of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting 
Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[49] In the late spring 
of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, also a law student at Yale. During 
the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, 
Walker and Burnstein.[50] The firm was well known for its support of constitutional 
rights, civil liberties, and radical causes (two of its four partners were 
current or former Communist Party members);[50] Rodham worked on child 
custody and other cases.[b] Clinton canceled his original summer plans 
in order to live with her in California;[54] the couple continued living 
together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[51] The following 
summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic 
presidential candidate George McGovern.[55] She received a Juris Doctor 
degree from Yale in 1973,[35] having stayed on an extra year to be with 
Clinton.[56] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but 
she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[56] Rodham 
began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale 
Child Study Center.[57] Her first scholarly article, "Children Under the 
Law", was published in the Harvard Educational Review in late 1973.[58] 
Discussing the new children's rights movement, it stated that "child citizens" 
were "powerless individuals"[59] and argued that children should not be 
considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead 
that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, 
on a case-by-case basis.[60] The article became frequently cited in the 
field.[61] During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney 
for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[62] 
and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[63] In 1974 she 
was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising 
the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[64] 
Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard 
W. Nussbaum,[45] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the 
historical grounds and standards for impeachment.[64] The committee's work 
culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[64] 
By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic 
political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to 
Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.[65] Wright 
thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.[66] 
Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry 
him and she continued to demur.[67] After failing the District of Columbia 
bar exam[68] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. 
As she later wrote, "I chose to follow my heart instead of my head".[69] 
She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, 
where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running 
for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 
1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and became one of only two 
female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, 
Fayetteville.[70][71] At the university, Rodham gave classes in criminal 
law, where she was considered a rigorous teacher and tough grader.[72] 
She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, 
securing support from the local bar association and gaining federal funding.[73] 
Among her cases was one where she was obliged by request of the court to 
serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl; 
she put on an effective defense that led to his pleading guilty to a much 
lesser charge.[74] Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel 
had put her "through hell" during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has 
called the trial a "terrible case".[74] During her time in Fayetteville, 
Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.[73] 
Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate 
identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone 
else's.[75] Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the 
summer of 1975, and she finally agreed to marry him.[76] Their wedding 
took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living 
room.[77] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated 
that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham.[78][79] The motivation 
was to keep the couple's professional lives separate and avoid apparent 
conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, "it 
showed that I was still me."[80] The decision did upset both their mothers.[81] 
Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was 
elected Arkansas Attorney General, and so the couple moved to the state 
capital of Little Rock.[82] There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the 
venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[83] 
She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[43] 
while also working pro bono in child advocacy;[84] she rarely performed 
litigation work in court.[85] Rodham maintained her interest in children's 
law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles "Children's Policies: 
Abandonment and Neglect" in 1977[86] and "Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective" 
in 1979.[87] The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence 
depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical 
rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted.[60] An American 
Bar Association chair later said, "Her articles were important, not because 
they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that 
had been inchoate."[60] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her 
as "one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades",[88] 
while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental 
authority,[89] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against 
their parents,[60] and exemplified legal "crit" theory run amok.[90] In 
1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a 
state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.[43][92] Later that 
year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign 
director of field operations in Indiana)[93] appointed her to the board 
of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,[94] and she served in that 
capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.[95] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[c] 
she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job.[96] During 
her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million 
to $300 million; subsequently she successfully fought President Ronald 
Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[84] 
Following her husband's November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, 
Rodham became First Lady of Arkansas in January 1979, a title that she 
held for twelve years (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed her chair of 
the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[97] where she secured 
federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas 
without affecting doctors' fees.[98] In 1979, Rodham became the first woman 
to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.[99] From 1978 until they entered 
the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[100] During 
1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged 
in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[101] an initial $1,000 investment 
generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[102] 
The couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development 
Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal at this time.[101] 
Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s. On February 
27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to a daughter, Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill 
Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[103] Bill Clinton returned 
to the governor's office two years later after winning the election of 
1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name "Hillary 
Clinton", or sometimes "Mrs. Bill Clinton", to assuage the concerns of 
Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign 
for him full-time.[104] As First Lady of Arkansas again, she made a point 
of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[d] She was named chair of 
the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to 
reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system.[110][111] 
In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought 
a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education 
Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards 
for curriculum and classroom size.[97][110] It became her introduction 
into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[79][110] In 
1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool 
Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool 
preparedness and literacy.[112] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year 
in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[113][114] Clinton continued 
to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. 
She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,[115] 
but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[116] The firm 
considered her a "rainmaker" because she brought in clients, partly thanks 
to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections.[116] 
She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[116] 
Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election 
campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law 
did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state 
fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[117] 
From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as 
chair, of the New World Foundation,[118] which funded a variety of New 
Left interest groups.[119] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of 
the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created 
to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association 
to adopt measures to combat it.[120] She was twice named by The National 
Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 
and in 1991.[121] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for 
governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls 
were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final 
time.[122] Clinton served on the boards of the Arkansas Children's Hospital 
Legal Services (1988–92)[123] and the Children's Defense Fund (as chair, 
1986–92).[2][124] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, 
she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92),[125] 
Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92)[126] and Lafarge (1990–92).[127] TCBY and Wal-Mart 
were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[116][128] 
Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following 
pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[128] Once there, 
she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly 
practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be 
added to the company's management, and was silent about the company's famously 
anti-labor union practices.[126][128][129] Clinton received sustained national 
attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 
1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, 
tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in 
an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[130] In response, the Clintons 
appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged 
"causing pain in my marriage".[131] This joint appearance was credited 
with rescuing his campaign.[132] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally 
disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described 
in her classic song "Stand by Your Man",[e] and later in the campaign about 
how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies 
and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[f] The remarks 
were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home 
mothers, and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill 
said that in electing him, the nation would "get two for the price of one", 
referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[138] Beginning with 
Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article "The Lady 
Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record 
came under attack from conservatives.[89] At least twenty other articles 
in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[139] 
When Bill Clinton took office as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton became the First Lady, and her press secretary reiterated that 
she would be using that form of her name.[d] She was the first inaugural 
First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional 
career up to the time of entering the White House.[140] She was also the 
first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition 
to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[57][141] She was part 
of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration 
and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more 
lower-level ones.[142] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as 
the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[143][144] 
Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central 
role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's 
role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors 
and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role 
in her husband's presidency.[145] Bill Clinton's campaign promise of "two 
for the price of one" led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons 
as "co-presidents" or sometimes use the Arkansas label "Billary".[97][146][147] 
The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were 
enough to send Hillary Clinton into "imaginary discussions" with the also-politically-active 
Eleanor Roosevelt.[g] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also 
found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives 
of conservative Washington figures.[151][152] Triggered in part by the 
death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis 
of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy, and Tikkun 
editor Michael Lerner's "politics of meaning" to overcome what she saw 
as America's "sleeping sickness of the soul"; that would lead to a willingness 
"to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the 
twentieth century, moving into a new millennium."[153][154] In January 
1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a Task Force on National 
Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading 
the effort for Arkansas education reform.[155] Unconvinced regarding the 
merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately 
urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[156][157] 
The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health 
care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide 
health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance 
organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as "Hillarycare", 
and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.[158] Some 
protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic, and during a July 
1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof 
vest at times.[158] Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in 
either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), 
the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[159] Clinton later acknowledged 
in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the 
defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady's approval ratings, 
which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first 
year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.[160] 
Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of 
the 1994 midterm elections.[161] Republicans saw a net gain of fifty-three 
seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control 
of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor 
in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.[162] The 
White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy.[163] 
Opponents of universal health care would continue to use "Hillarycare" 
as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[164] Along with Senators 
Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of 
the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal effort 
that provided state support for children whose parents could not provide 
them with health coverage, and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of 
enrolling children in the program once it became law.[165] She promoted 
nationwide immunization against childhood illnesses and encouraged older 
women to seek a mammogram to detect breast cancer, with coverage provided 
by Medicare.[166] She successfully sought to increase research funding 
for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of 
Health.[57] The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness 
that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf 
War syndrome.[57] Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill 
Clinton's presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from 
a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming 
off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[167][168] 
A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that 
restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other 
areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the 
president to veto it again.[167] But she decided to support the bill, which 
became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise 
available.[167][168] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later 
called "sad and painful".[168] Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, 
Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department 
of Justice.[57] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and 
Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as 
first lady.[57][169] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the 
Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers 
aging out of foster care.[169] As first lady, Clinton hosted numerous White 
House conferences, including ones on Child Care (1997),[170] on Early Childhood 
Development and Learning (1997),[171] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[172] 
She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000)[173] 
and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[174] 
Clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time,[175] breaking the mark 
for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon.[176] She did not hold a 
security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played 
a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[177] A March 1995 five-nation 
trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without 
her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[178] 
Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found 
a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained 
a better relationship with the American press corps.[179] The trip was 
a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in 
diplomacy.[180] In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference 
on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against practices that 
abused women around the world and in the People's Republic of China itself,[181] 
declaring that "it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as 
separate from human rights".[181] Delegates from over 180 countries heard 
her say: "If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, 
let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human 
rights, once and for all."[182] In doing so, she resisted both internal 
administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[175][182] The 
speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later 
women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases.[183] She was 
one of the most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to 
speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[184][185] 
She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by 
the U.S. to promote the participation of women in the political processes 
of their countries.[186] It and Clinton's own visits encouraged women to 
make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[187] First 
Lady Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States 
Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress, and 
the press. The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention 
from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential 
campaign[188] and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost 
their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; 
at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, 
operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained 
the legal services of Rose Law Firm[189] and may have been improperly subsidizing 
Whitewater losses.[188] Madison Guaranty later failed, and Clinton's work 
at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing 
the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed.[188] She 
said she had done minimal work for the bank.[190] Independent counsels 
Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; 
she said she did not know where they were.[191][192] The records were found 
in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered 
to investigators in early 1996.[192] The delayed appearance of the records 
sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they 
surfaced and where they had been.[192] Clinton's staff attributed the problem 
to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the 
Arkansas Governor's Mansion.[193] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the 
first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[191] 
After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was 
issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either 
Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[194] Scrutiny of the May 1993 
firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an affair that became 
known as "Travelgate", began with charges that the White House had used 
audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse 
to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[195] The 1996 discovery 
of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on 
whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements 
she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[196][197] 
The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in 
the firings and that she had made "factually false" statements, but that 
there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, 
or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[198] 
Following deputy White House counsel Vince Foster's July 1993 suicide, 
allegations were made that Clinton had ordered the removal of potentially 
damaging files (related to Whitewater or other matters) from Foster's office 
on the night of his death.[199] Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr investigated 
this, and, by 1999, Starr was reported to be holding the investigation 
open, despite his staff having told him there was no case to be made.[200] 
When Starr's successor Robert Ray issued his final Whitewater reports in 
2000, no claims were made against Clinton regarding this.[194] An outgrowth 
of the "Travelgate" investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper 
White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican 
White House employees, an affair that some called "Filegate".[201] Accusations 
were made that Clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended 
hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[202] 
The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible 
evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[201] 
In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from 
trading in 1978–79, thus leading to the cattle futures controversy.[203] 
Allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised 
bribery, and several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal 
investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[204] 
There was a controversy that arose in early 2001 over gifts made to the 
White House, rather than to the Clintons personally, that were removed 
and shipped to the Clintons' private residence during the last year of 
Bill Clinton's time in office.[205] Following public pressure the couple 
returned $134,000 worth of such gifts.[206] Hillary Clinton faced additional 
criticism for having possibly solicited personal gifts shortly before being 
sworn in as a senator, at which time she would have been barred from accepting 
them.[206] In 1998, the Clintons' relationship became the subject of much 
speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged 
in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[207] 
Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment 
of Bill Clinton by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by 
the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, 
Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a "vast right-wing 
conspiracy,"[208][209] characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest 
in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political 
enemies[h] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that 
she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had 
taken place.[211] After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters 
with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming 
her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious 
at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.[212] The White 
House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the 
couple during this period.[213] Public reaction varied. Some women admired 
her strength and poise in private matters that were made public, some sympathized 
with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior, others criticized 
her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions, while still others 
accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping 
or even fostering her own political influence.[214] Her public approval 
ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70 percent, 
the highest they had ever been.[214] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute 
her decision to stay married to "a love that has persisted for decades" 
and add: "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the 
way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, 
energizing and fully alive person I have ever met."[215] Matters surrounding 
the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 
2014, Hillary would state that she and Bill had left the White House "not 
only dead broke, but in debt." The statement may have been literally accurate 
but ignored the potentially enormous earnings potential of ex-presidents 
giving paid speeches upon leaving office as well as the couple's ability 
to secure loans from banks.[216] Clinton initiated and was the founding 
chair of the Save America's Treasures program, a national effort that matched 
federal funds to private donations to preserve and restore historic items 
and sites,[217] including the flag that inspired "The Star-Spangled Banner" 
and the First Ladies Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[57] She was head of 
the White House Millennium Council[218] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[219] 
a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became 
the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[57] Clinton also 
created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline 
Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art 
loaned from museums.[220] In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts 
of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating 
display in the state rooms.[57] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue 
Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe[221] and 
the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[222] Working with Arkansas 
interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw 
extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often 
trying to make it look brighter.[223] These included changing the look 
of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines.[222] 
Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings 
for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[223] Clinton hosted 
many large-scale events at the White House, such as a Saint Patrick's Day 
reception, a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a contemporary 
music concert that raised funds for music education in public schools, 
a New Year's Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century, and a state 
dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[57] 
When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced 
his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, 
including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run 
for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[224] Once she 
decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north 
of New York City, in September 1999.[225] She became the first First Lady 
of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[226] Initially, 
Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as 
her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race 
in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related 
to his failing marriage became public, and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, 
a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New 
York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused 
Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated 
in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.[227] Clinton began 
her campaign, which was managed by Bill de Blasio, by visiting all 62 counties 
in the State, in a "listening tour" of small-group settings.[228] She devoted 
considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions.[229] 
Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising 
to deliver 200,000 jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax 
credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially 
in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition 
and long-term care.[229] The contest drew national attention. Lazio blundered 
during a September debate by seeming to invade Clinton's personal space 
trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[230] The campaigns of 
Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record 
combined $90 million.[231] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, 
with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio's 43 percent.[230] She was sworn in 
as U.S. senator on January 3, 2001,[232] making her the first (and so far 
only) woman to have held an elected office either while,[i] or after, serving 
as first lady. Upon entering the Senate, Clinton maintained a low public 
profile and built relationships with senators from both parties.[233] She 
forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular 
participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast.[151][234] She served on five 
Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001–02),[235] Committee on Armed 
Services (2003–09),[236] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001–09),[235] 
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001–09)[235] and Special 
Committee on Aging.[237] She was also a member of the Commission on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe[238] (2001–09).[239] Following the September 
11 terrorist attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery 
efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working 
with New York's senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in 
securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment.[240] 
She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues 
faced by 9/11 first responders.[241] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot 
Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed 
concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding 
civil liberties,[242] before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement 
and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority 
support.[243] Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action 
in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving 
the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[244] 
Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized 
President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[245] After 
the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit 
American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton 
noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections 
held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[246] 
Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, 
she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. 
Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain.[247] In late 2005, Clinton 
said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's 
pledge to stay "until the job is done" was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis 
"an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves".[248] Her stance 
caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick 
withdrawal.[249] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits 
for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, 
especially those in New York.[250][251] She used her position on the Armed 
Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking 
military officers.[251] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself 
on the Iraq War Resolution, saying that she "got it wrong" and the vote 
in support had been a "mistake".[252]) Clinton voted against President 
Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation 
Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[253] 
Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice 
of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[254][255] In 2005, Clinton called 
for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed 
up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[256] 
Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family 
Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate 
content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the 
Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[253][257] 
Looking to establish a "progressive infrastructure" to rival that of American 
conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led 
to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration Chief of Staff John 
Podesta's Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for 
Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003, and advised the 
Clintons' former antagonist David Brock's Media Matters for America, created 
in 2004.[258] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed 
new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to 
handle daily political messaging.[259] In November 2004, Clinton announced 
that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic 
nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[260] 
The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County 
District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several 
months of poor campaign performance.[261] Clinton's eventual opponent in 
the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor 
of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent 
of the vote to Spencer's 31 percent,[262] carrying all but four of New 
York's sixty-two counties.[263] Her campaign spent $36 million for her 
re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. 
Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, 
while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a 
potential presidential bid in 2008.[264] In the following months, she transferred 
$10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[265] 
Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and 
domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging 
that the surge had been successful).[j] In March of that year, she voted 
in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing 
troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party 
lines[267] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war 
funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress 
benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 
and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against 
it.[268] Clinton responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report 
to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, "I think that the reports 
that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief."[269] 
In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, 
Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[270] Regarding 
the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive 
Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of 
the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[271] As the financial 
crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 
2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, 
voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset 
Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American 
people. It passed the Senate 74–25.[272] In 2007, Clinton and Virginia 
Senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor 
issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[273] Clinton had been preparing 
for a potential candidacy for U.S. President since at least early 2003.[274] 
On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential 
exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, 
stating "I'm in, and I'm in to win."[275] No woman had ever been nominated 
by a major party for the presidency, and no First Lady had ever run for 
President. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was 
established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to 
avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments 
as Hillary undertook her presidential race.[276] Later disclosure statements 
revealed that the couple's worth was now upwards of $50 million,[276] and 
that they had earned over $100 million since 2000, with most of it coming 
from Bill's books, speaking engagements, and other activities.[277] Throughout 
the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic 
presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack 
Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina were 
her strongest competitors.[245] The biggest threat to her campaign was 
her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[245] 
Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the 
money lead each quarter.[278] By September 2007, polling in the first six 
states holding Democratic contests showed that Clinton was leading in all 
of them, with the races being closest in Iowa and South Carolina. By the 
following month, national polls showed Clinton far ahead of Democratic 
competitors.[279] At the end of October, Clinton suffered a rare poor debate 
performance against Obama, Edwards, and her other opponents.[280][281] 
Obama's message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate 
better than Clinton's message of experience.[282] The race tightened considerably, 
especially in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, 
with Clinton losing her lead in some polls by December.[283] In the first 
vote of 2008, she placed third in the January 3 Iowa Democratic caucus 
behind Obama and Edwards.[284] Obama gained ground in national polling 
in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the 
New Hampshire primary.[285] Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 
8, defeating Obama narrowly.[286] It was the first time a woman had won 
a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate 
selection.[287] Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied 
but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by 
women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding 
to a voter's question the day before the election.[288] The nature of the 
contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton 
and other surrogates,[289] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin 
Luther King, Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[k] were perceived by many as, accidentally 
or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise 
denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[290] 
Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic 
voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her 
support among African Americans.[289][291] She lost by a two-to-one margin 
to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[291] setting up, with 
Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two 
February 5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements 
attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the 
South Carolina campaign, and his role was seen as damaging enough to her 
that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former 
President "needs to stop".[292] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting 
damage to Hillary Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment 
and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[293] On 
Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New 
York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;[294] they 
almost evenly split the total popular vote.[295] But Obama was gaining 
more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better 
exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[296] The 
Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday 
and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; 
lagging in Internet fundraising, Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[282][297] 
There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff and she made several 
top-level personnel changes.[297][298] Obama won the next eleven February 
contests across the country, often by large margins, and took a significant 
pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[296][297] On March 4, Clinton broke 
the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[297] where 
her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped 
in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.[299] Throughout the 
campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely 
ignored preparation.[282][296] Obama did well in primaries where African 
Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily 
represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, 
or working-class white voters predominated.[300][301] Behind in delegates, 
Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, 
party-appointed superdelegates.[302] Clinton's admission in late March, 
that her repeated campaign statements about having been under hostile fire 
from snipers during a March 1996 visit to U.S. troops at Tuzla Air Base 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina were not true, attracted considerable media attention.[303] 
On April 22, she won the Pennsylvania primary and kept her campaign alive.[304] 
On May 6, a narrower-than-expected win in the Indiana primary, coupled 
with a large loss in the North Carolina primary, ended any realistic chance 
she had of winning the nomination.[304] She vowed to stay on through the 
remaining primaries, but stopped attacks against Obama; as one advisor 
stated, "She could accept losing. She could not accept quitting."[304] 
She won some of the remaining contests, and indeed over the last three 
months of the campaign won more delegates, states, and votes than Obama, 
but she failed to overcome Obama's lead.[297] Following the final primaries 
on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive 
nominee.[305] In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended 
her campaign and endorsed Obama.[306] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 
1,640 pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763;[307] at the time of the clinching, 
Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama's 395,[308] with those numbers 
widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[307] 
Clinton and Obama each received over 17 million votes during the nomination 
process[l] with both breaking the previous record.[309] Clinton was the 
first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state, and she eclipsed, 
by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for 
most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[287] Clinton gave a passionate 
speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and 
campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory 
over McCain in the general election on November 4.[310] Clinton's campaign 
ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors 
and wrote off the $13 million that she lent it herself.[311] The debt was 
eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[311] In mid-November 2008, 
President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving 
as U.S. Secretary of State in his administration.[312] She was initially 
quite reluctant, but on November 20, she told Obama she would accept the 
position.[313][314] On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced 
that Clinton would be his nominee for Secretary of State.[315][316] Clinton 
said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented 
a "difficult and exciting adventure".[316] As part of the nomination and 
in order to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed 
to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities 
and fundraising efforts for the William J. Clinton Foundation and Clinton 
Global Initiative.[317] The appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and 
signed into law in December 2008.[318] Confirmation hearings before the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before 
the Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16–1 to approve 
Clinton.[319] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65 percent, 
the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[320] On January 21, 2009, 
Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94–2.[321] Clinton 
took the oath of office of Secretary of State, resigning from the Senate 
later that day.[322] She became the first former first lady to serve in 
the United States Cabinet.[323] Clinton spent her initial days as Secretary 
of State telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign 
policy would change direction: "We have a lot of damage to repair."[324] 
She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State 
Department and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, 
especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic 
missions.[325] Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental 
reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes 
specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; 
it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she 
was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.[326] 
The first such review was issued in late 2010 and called for the U.S. leading 
through "civilian power" as a cost-effective way of responding to international 
challenges and defusing crises.[327] It also sought to institutionalize 
goals of empowering women throughout the world.[182] A cause Clinton advocated 
throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing 
world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation 
and reduce smoke dangers to women.[313] In an internal debate regarding 
the war in Afghanistan during 2009, Clinton sided with the military's recommendations 
for a maximal "Afghanistan surge", recommending 40,000 troops and no public 
deadline for withdrawal; she prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden's 
opposition, but eventually supported Obama's compromise plan to send an 
additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual 
withdrawal.[251][328] In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign 
Minister Sergey Lavrov with a "reset button" symbolizing U.S. attempts 
to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[329][330] 
The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, 
which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in 
several areas during Medvedev's time in office, but relations would worsen 
considerably following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012.[329] 
In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame 
last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian 
accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between 
the two long-hostile nations.[331][332] In Pakistan, she engaged in several 
unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts, and tribal 
elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[180][m] 
Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international 
sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that 
country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[313][334][335] 
Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; 
she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to 
the outside, and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage 
the president.[336][337] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense 
Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[338] Obama and Clinton 
both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic 
exercise.[313] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily 
relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[337] 
moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White 
House or Pentagon.[339][340] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her 
actions.[313] In a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies 
between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet.[341] Chinese 
officials reacted negatively towards it and the speech garnered attention 
as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet 
as a key element of American foreign policy.[342] In July 2010, she visited 
Korea, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, all the while preparing for 
the July 31 wedding of daughter Chelsea amid much media attention.[343] 
The 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis 
for the administration yet.[344] Clinton's public response quickly evolved 
from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was "stable", 
to a stance that there needed to be an "orderly transition [to] a democratic 
participatory government", to a condemnation of violence against the protesters.[345][346] 
Obama came to rely upon Clinton's advice, organization, and personal connections 
in the behind-the-scenes response to developments.[344] As Arab Spring 
protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of 
a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing 
some regimes while supporting protesters against others.[347] As the Libyan 
Civil War took place, Clinton's shift in favor of military intervention 
aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security 
Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming 
internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security 
advisor Thomas E. Donilon, and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in 
gaining the backing for, and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military 
intervention in Libya.[347][348][349] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress 
that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its 
military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of 
both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution, 
and the State Department's legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution's 
60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in 
a legal debate within the Obama administration).[350] Clinton later used 
U.S. allies and what she called "convening power" to promote unity among 
the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[348] 
The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed 
state,[351] and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what 
happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[352][353][354] 
During April 2011 internal deliberations of the president's innermost circle 
of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid 
into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued 
in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks 
to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[355][356] Following completion 
of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden's death, Clinton played 
a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs 
of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[357] During internal discussions regarding 
Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 
U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for 
a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).[251][358] In a 
speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, 
Clinton said that "Gay rights are human rights", and that the U.S. would 
advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.[359] The 
same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a 
direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary 
of state since 1955, as she met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition 
leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic 
reforms.[360][361] She also said that the 21st century would be "America's 
Pacific century",[362] a declaration that was part of the Obama administration's 
"pivot to Asia".[363] During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama 
administration initially sought to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 
to engage popular demonstrations with reform, then as government violence 
allegedly rose in August 2011, called for him to resign from the presidency.[364] 
The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance 
to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups 
working in Syria.[365] During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA 
Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming 
and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels, but the proposal was rejected 
by the White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in 
the conflict and who feared that extremists hidden among the rebels might 
turn the weapons against other targets.[360][366] In December 2012 Clinton 
was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right 
transverse venous sinus.[367] Her doctors had discovered the clot during 
a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted 
and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration 
from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe.[367][368] 
The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with 
anticoagulant medication, and her doctors have said she has made a full 
recovery.[368][369][n] Throughout her time in office, and in her final 
speech concluding it, Clinton viewed "smart power" as the strategy for 
asserting U.S. leadership and values—in a world of varied threats, weakened 
central governments, and increasingly important nongovernmental entities—by 
combining military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities 
in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity, and human 
rights advocacy.[348][373] As such, she became the first secretary of state 
to methodically implement the smart power approach.[374] In debates over 
use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices 
in the administration.[251][338][358] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing 
multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response 
towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[375] 
Clinton greatly expanded the State Department's use of social media, including 
Facebook and Twitter, both to get its message out and to help empower citizens 
of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments.[348] And in the Mideast 
turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the 
central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and 
girls worldwide.[182] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the 
"Hillary Doctrine", she viewed women's rights as critical for U.S. security 
interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and 
gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international 
security of that state.[336][376] In turn, there was a trend of women around 
the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, 
as the result of her actions and visibility.[377] Clinton visited 112 countries 
during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[378][o] 
(Time magazine wrote that "Clinton's endurance is legendary").[348] The 
first secretary of state to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, 
she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the 
virtual age.[381] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested 
in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected 
in 2012;[349] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated 
Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor.[368] Her last day as Secretary 
of State was February 1, 2013.[382] Upon her departure, analysts commented 
that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs 
as some other Secretaries of State had,[339][340] and highlighted her focus 
on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting 
effect.[383] On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, 
Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. 
Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding 
the security of the U.S. consulate, and the varying explanations given 
afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically 
controversial in the U.S.[384] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility 
for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations 
were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[384][385] 
On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued 
its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials 
in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, 
and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security 
environment.[386] It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of 
Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department 
officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from 
their posts as a consequence.[387] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions 
of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested 
recommendations.[386] Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign 
affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. 
She defended her actions in response to the incident and, while still accepting 
formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions 
beforehand regarding consulate security.[388] Congressional Republicans 
challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, 
after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had 
issued inaccurate "talking points" after the attack, Clinton responded 
with the much-quoted rejoinder, "With all due respect, the fact is we had 
four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys 
out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? 
What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out 
what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening 
again, Senator."[388][389] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee 
issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration's 
response to the attack.[390] The House Select Committee on Benghazi was 
created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 
2012 attack.[391] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic 
politics.[391][392] This was especially the case in September 2015, when 
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with 
lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' 
previous talking points on the investigation.[391][393] On October 22, 
2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the 
committee.[394][395] The hearing included many heated exchanges between 
committee members and Clinton, and among the committee members themselves.[394] 
Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, 
because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor, and 
a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[396] 
The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along 
partisan lines,[391] with the Republican report offering some new details 
about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[392] A 
controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department's 
inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts 
on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts 
maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business 
during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members 
of Congress, and political opponents contended that her use of private 
messaging system software and a private server violated State Department 
protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping 
requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 
2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select 
Committee on Benghazi.[397][398] In a joint statement released on July 
15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector 
general of the intelligence community said that their review of the emails 
found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time 
of their inspection, and "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified 
personal system."[399] They also stated unequivocally that this classified 
information should never have been stored outside of secure government 
computer systems.[399] Clinton had said over a period of months that she 
kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in 
her house.[399] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement 
signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive 
information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[400] 
After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell 
into the so-called "born classified" category, an FBI probe was initiated 
regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[401] 
The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored 
on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[402] 
Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress 
to say that some of the emails "contained classified State Department information 
when originated."[403] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State 
Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary 
of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would 
not have received it if she had asked.[404] Clinton maintained that she 
did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential 
at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders 
on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, "I never sent or received any classified 
material – they are retroactively classifying it." On July 2, 2016, Clinton 
stated: "Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never 
received nor sent any material that was marked classified."[405][406] On 
July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI 
director James Comey said: 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined 
by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they 
were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that 
was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information 
at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the 
lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional 
e-mails were "up-classified" to make them Confidential; the information 
in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[402][407] 
Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although 
they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small "c" in 
parentheses, described as "portion markings" by Comey. He also said it 
was possible Clinton was not "technically sophisticated" enough to understand 
what the three classified markings meant.[407] The probe found that Clinton 
used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both 
sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated 
adversaries. The FBI assessed that it "is possible that hostile actors 
gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account."[402] Comey 
stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were "extremely careless 
in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information", the 
FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that "no charges are appropriate 
in this case."[402] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch 
confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers while 
secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.[408] When Clinton 
left the State Department, she became a private citizen for the first time 
in thirty years.[409] She and her daughter joined her husband as named 
members of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[410] 
There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an 
initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage 
the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian 
Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[410][411] Clinton also led the No Ceilings: 
The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls 
around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[412] its March 2015 
report said that while "There has never been a better time in history to 
be born a woman ... this data shows just how far we still have to go."[413] 
The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, 
which it had stopped doing while she was secretary.[p] However, even though 
the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, 
they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes 
linked to their governments.[416] She began work on another volume of memoirs, 
and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[417] There she received 
$200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms 
or at business conventions.[417][418] She also made some unpaid speeches 
on behalf of the foundation.[417] For the fifteen months ending in March 
2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches.[419] For the overall 
period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million 
in federal and state taxes, and donated about $15 million to charity.[420] 
As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, 
or $45–53 million with her husband.[421] Clinton resigned from the foundation's 
board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign, and the 
foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from 
six Western nations only.[p] On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced 
her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[422] She had a campaign-in-waiting 
already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives, 
and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees, 
and other infrastructure.[423] The campaign's headquarters were established 
in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[424] Focuses of her campaign 
have included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool 
and making college more affordable, and improving the Affordable Care Act.[425][426] 
Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[422] 
Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from self-professed democratic 
socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against 
the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated 
with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality 
in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.[418][426] In 
the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly 
won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly 
popular Sanders,[427][428] making her the first woman to win the Iowa caucuses.[427] 
In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to 
Sanders by a wide margin.[429] Sanders was an increasing threat in the 
next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[430] but Clinton managed 
a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino 
workers.[431] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South 
Carolina primary on February 27.[430] These two victories stabilized her 
campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed 
her 2008 effort.[430] On March 1 ("Super Tuesday"), Clinton won seven of 
eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the 
South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters, and opened 
up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[432] She maintained 
this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, 
with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among 
younger, whiter, more rural, and more liberal voters and in states that 
held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton 
did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states 
that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[433][434][435] 
By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive 
superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[436] 
On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of 
primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became 
the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major 
American political party.[437] By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 
pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates 
compared to Sanders' 47.[438] She received almost 17 million votes during 
the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13 million.[439] Clinton 
was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia 
on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president 
by a major U.S. political party.[440] Her choice of vice presidential running 
mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following 
day.[441] Her opponents in the general election were Republican Donald 
Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson, and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Clinton 
held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 
2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton became tied in major polls following 
the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[442] FBI Director 
James Comey concluded Clinton had been "extremely careless" in her handling 
of classified government material.[443] In late July, Trump gained his 
first lead over Clinton in major polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point 
convention bounce at the Republican National Convention, in line with the 
average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it is toward the small 
side by historical standards.[444][445] Following Clinton's 7 percentage 
point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained 
a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[446][447] 
If elected, Clinton would have become the first female President of the 
United States. However, she was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 
8, 2016 presidential election.[448] As of the early morning of November 
9, Trump had received 279 electoral college votes to Clinton's 218.[449] 
A candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win. Of total votes counted 
by Thursday November 10, Trump has received 59,791,135 (47.5%) to Clinton's 
60,071,781 (47.7%).[450] Breaking with tradition, Clinton did not deliver 
a concession speech when the results of the vote were finalized, but chose 
to wait until the next day. Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, told supporters 
instead to go home to sleep, saying, "We are not going to say anything 
more tonight." Clinton did call Trump to concede and congratulate him on 
his victory.[451] Several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's 
place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. 
National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating 
of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with 
a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[452] 
National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal 
senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[453] A 2004 analysis 
by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon 
Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the 
sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[454] The Almanac of American Politics, 
edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 
through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, 
in three areas: Economic, Social, and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, 
the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 
6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 
75 liberal, 20 conservative.[q] According to FiveThirtyEight's measure 
of political ideology, "Clinton was one of the most liberal members during 
her time in the Senate."[455] Organizations have also attempted to give 
newer assessments of Clinton once she reentered elective politics in 2015. 
Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues 
places her in their "Left Liberal" region on their two-dimensional grid 
of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale 
of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances and an economic score 
of 10 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[456] 
Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes, 
and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale 
from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[457] Through 2008, 
she had an average lifetime 90 percent "Liberal Quotient" from Americans 
for Democratic Action,[458] and a lifetime 8 percent rating from the American 
Conservative Union.[459] In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic 
plan, which The New York Times called "optimistic" and "wide-ranging".[460] 
Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed 
a "clawback" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies 
that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share 
profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing 
on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; 
increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an "exit tax" on companies 
that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax 
rate overseas.[460] Clinton 'opposes' (though previously described it as 
"the gold standard"[461] of trade deals) the Trans-Pacific Partnership 
(TPP), supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and holds that "any trade 
deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect 
our security".[462][463] As Senator (2001-2009), her record on trade was 
mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[462] Given 
the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court's 
Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment 
to limit "unaccountable money" in politics.[464] In July 2016, she "committed" 
to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning 
the 2010 Citizens United decision.[465][466] On December 7, 2015, in The 
New York Times, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall 
Street financial activities.[467] Clinton accepted the scientific consensus 
on climate change, supports cap-and-trade,[468] and opposed the Keystone 
XL pipeline.[469] She supported equal pay for equal work, to address current 
shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.[470] 
Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal 
preschool.[464] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases 
on the wealthy, including a “fair share surcharge".[471] Clinton supported 
the Affordable Care Act[472] and would have added a "public option" that 
would have competed against private insurers and enabled people "50 or 
55 and up" to buy into Medicare.[473][474] On LGBT rights, she supported 
the right to same-sex marriage.[464] Clinton first expressed support for 
a national right to same-sex marriage in 2013; in 2000, she had been against 
such unions altogether, and in 2006, she said only that she would support 
a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages.[475] In 2000, she was 
the first First Lady to march in an LGBT pride parade.[476] In 2016, she 
was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed 
for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).[477] Clinton held that allowing 
undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship "[i]s at its heart 
a family issue,"[478] and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action 
for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five 
million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization 
to legally work in the United States.[479][480] She opposed and criticized 
Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[481] 
Clinton expressed support for Common Core.[482] She said, "The really unfortunate 
argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because 
the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. 
It wasn't politicized.... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core 
curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the 
value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education 
system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that, and so don't 
understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core."[483] On foreign 
affairs, Clinton voted in October 2002 in favor of the Authorization for 
Use of Military Force Against Iraq,[484] a vote she later "regretted." 
She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the 
removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[485] She supported the NATO 
bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in 
Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[486][487] Clinton 
is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[481] 
She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, "America can't 
ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival."[488] 
Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 
2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[489][490] In 2000, Clinton 
advocated for eliminating the electoral college[491] and promised to co-sponsor 
legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the 
president.[492][493] Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various 
churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist 
Church: She discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally 
at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[494] 
However, she has infrequently discussed her faith while campaigning.[495][496] 
As of 2016[update], Clinton has openly discussed her Christianity on several 
occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one's neighbor 
as oneself, of helping the poor and "creating opportunities for others 
to be lifted up".[496] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that "Christianity, 
which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so 
quickly and judge so harshly."[496] Professor Paul Kengor, author of God 
and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton's political 
positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton often expresses a certain maxim 
which is often attributed to John Wesley: "Do all the good you can, by 
all the means you can, in all the ways you can."[495] In fact, Clinton 
repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National 
Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy "made sure I learned [these] 
words from our Methodist faith."[497] As First Lady of the United States, 
Clinton published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled "Talking 
It Over" from 1995 to 2000.[498][499] It focused on her experiences and 
those of women, children, and families she met during her travels around 
the world.[2] In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for the children of America 
in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. The 
book made the Best Seller list of The New York Times and Clinton received 
the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio 
recording.[500] She was the first First Lady to win a Grammy Award.[501] 
Other books published by Clinton when she was first lady include Dear Socks, 
Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to 
the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword 
to the children's book Beatrice's Goat.[502] In 2003, Clinton released 
a 562-page autobiography, Living History, for which publisher Simon & Schuster 
paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million.[503] The book set a first-week 
sales record for a nonfiction work,[504] went on to sell more than one 
million copies in the first month following publication,[505] and was translated 
into twelve foreign languages.[506] Clinton's audio recording of the book 
earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[507] 
In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused 
on her time as Secretary of State. As of July 2015, the book has sold about 
280,000 copies.[508] In 2016, Clinton, along with her running mate Tim 
Kaine, published Stronger Together, outlining her vision for the United 
States if she had been elected in the 2016 presidential election.[509] 
Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton, 
from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found "a 
virtual cottage industry" of "anti-Clinton literature",[510] put out by 
Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints,[510] with titles such 
as Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: 
Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House, and 
Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the 
United States Unless ... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as 
well[510] (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When 
she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save 
Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang 
up to oppose her.[511] Van Natta found that Republican and conservative 
groups viewed her as a reliable "bogeyman" to mention in fundraising letters,[512] 
on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal 
appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[512] Clinton has also been featured in 
the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. 
In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton 
as a Rorschach test,[513] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist 
writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, "Coverage of Hillary Clinton 
is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society."[514] 
She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night 
Live, beginning with her time as first lady, and has made guest appearances 
on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers.[515][516] 
Clinton has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, 
with some arguing otherwise.[517] James Madison University political science 
professor Valerie Sulfaro's 2007 study used the American National Election 
Studies' "feeling thermometer" polls, which measure the degree of opinion 
about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton's first 
lady years confirm the "conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing 
figure", with the added insight that "affect towards Mrs. Clinton as first 
lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant 
one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral".[518] University 
of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson's 2006 study 
of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval 
ratings of the state's senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan 
difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval 
between New York's Democrats and Republicans.[519] Northern Illinois University 
political science professor Barbara Burrell's 2000 study found that Clinton's 
Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout 
her time as first lady, with 70 to 90 percent of Democrats typically viewing 
her favorably while only 20 to 40 percent of Republicans did.[520] University 
of Wisconsin–Madison political science professor Charles Franklin analyzed 
her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls, 
and found that there was more variation in them during her first lady years 
than her Senate years.[521] The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 
50 percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40 percent range; Franklin 
noted that, "This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked 
aspects of Sen. Clinton's public image."[521] McGill University professor 
of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: 
Polarizing First Lady, and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton 
"was a polarizing figure, with 42 percent [of the public] saying she came 
closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41 percent 
disagreeing."[522] Troy further wrote that Clinton "has been uniquely controversial 
and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen 
in 1992"[523] and that she "has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched, 
and appalled Americans."[523] Burrell's study found women consistently 
rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points during 
her first lady years.[520] Jacobson's study found a positive correlation 
across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized 
response.[519] Colorado State University communication studies professor 
Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a "site" for 
American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female 
identity.[526] In particular, Anderson states there has been a cultural 
bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against 
modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had 
become a site of heterogeneity and paradox.[526] Burrell, as well as biographers 
Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest 
approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political 
achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband's 
very public infidelity.[214][520] University of Pennsylvania communications 
professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the double 
bind, who though able to live in a "both-and" world of both career and 
family, nevertheless "became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes 
about attributes once thought incompatible", leading to her being placed 
in a variety of no-win situations.[514] Quinnipiac University media studies 
professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both 
as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political 
interloper interested in usurping power for herself.[527] University of 
Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists 
using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist 
as emasculator, and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray 
Clinton as violating gender norms.[528] Going into the early stages of 
her presidential campaign for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large 
picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled "Love Her", "Hate Her",[529] 
while Mother Jones titled its profile of her "Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary".[530] 
Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls 
of their desired candidates,[531] while some conservative figures such 
as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton 
presidency not so bad after all.[532][533] An October 2007 cover of The 
American Conservative magazine was titled "The Waning Power of Hillary 
Hate".[534] By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed 
that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the 
Internet,[535] up to and including Facebook and other sites devoted to 
depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation.[535] She noted, in response 
to widespread comments on Clinton's laugh,[536] that "We know that there's 
language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We 
call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was 
being described as a cackle."[535] The "bitch" epithet, which had been 
applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen 
by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American 
politics,[537] flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet 
but via conventional media as well.[538] Following Clinton's "choked up 
moment" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire 
primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of 
gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[539][540] 
Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and 
the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events "brought an 
odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery 
or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most 
recognizable but least understood figures in American politics."[540] Once 
she became Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically 
among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[336][541] 
She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of 
her career except during the Lewinsky scandal),[542] and her favorable-unfavorable 
ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally 
prominent American political figure.[541][543] A 2012 Internet meme, "Texts 
from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military 
plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients 
and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, 
technically adept followers of politics.[544] Clinton sought to explain 
her popularity by saying in early 2012, "There's a certain consistency 
to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, 
you know, I kinda get her now.'"[336] She continued to do well in Gallup's 
most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired 
woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth 
time overall.[545] Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she 
left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics 
again.[546] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway 
and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the 
State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels 
ever.[547] During 2016 she acknowledged that: "I'm not a natural politician, 
in case you haven't noticed."[548] This section is very long. You can click
