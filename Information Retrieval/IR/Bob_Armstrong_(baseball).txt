Robert "Bob" Armstrong (1850 – ?) was an American professional baseball 
player. He played 12 of 21 games, eleven in center field, for the Fort 
Wayne Kekiongas in the first professional league, the 1871 National Association 
of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). Previously Armstrong played 
three seasons for the Maryland club of Baltimore, Maryland in the National 
Association of Base Ball Players. The Marylands were a strong club among 
the hundreds of NABBP members but a weak club among the twelve that contested 
the first professional pennant race in 1869, or the second one in 1870.
