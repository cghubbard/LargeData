Charles Ernest "Charlie" Keller (September 12, 1916 – May 23, 1990) was 
a left fielder in Major League Baseball. From 1939 through 1952, Keller 
played for the New York Yankees (1939–43, 1945–49, 1952) and Detroit Tigers 
(1950–51). A native of Middletown, Maryland, he batted left-handed and 
threw right-handed. His ability to hit massive wall reaching fly balls, 
and home runs, earned him the nickname "King Kong". A splendid all-round 
athlete at the University of Maryland, where he earned a degree in agricultural 
economics in 1937, Keller joined the Yankees in 1939 and quickly became 
the regular left fielder, with Tommy Henrich patrolling right field and 
Joe DiMaggio in center field. For much of ten American League seasons, 
Keller, DiMaggio, and Henrich formed one of the best-hitting outfields 
in baseball history. Through much of his career, Keller was a feared slugger 
and a competent fielder. In his rookie season he hit .334 with 11 home 
runs and 83 RBI in 111 games. He hit three homers and batted .438 as the 
Yankees swept four games from the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. 
In his second MLB season, Keller hit .286 with 21 home runs, 93 RBI, 18 
doubles and a career-high 15 triples. His most productive season came in 
1941, when he hit .298 and posted career-highs in home runs (33) and RBI 
(122), while also hitting 10 triples and 24 doubles, making it his first 
30-20-10 season. In 1942, he scored over 100 runs and walked over 100 times 
for the third straight season, slashing .292/.417/.513/.930, while also 
stealing a career-high 14 bases. Following service with the United States 
Merchant Marine in 1944 and 1945, Keller returned as a regular with the 
Yankees for the 1946 season. He collected 30 home runs, 29 doubles, and 
10 triples, the second of his two 30-20-10 seasons. Keller played part-time 
from 1947 to 1949 while troubled by a ruptured disc in his back. He was 
released by the Yankees before the 1950 season and signed a two-year contract 
with the Detroit Tigers, serving mostly as a pinch-hitter. In 1952 he re-signed 
with New York in September, appearing in two games, then was released in 
October, marking the end of his career. In a 13-season career, Keller was 
a .286 hitter with 189 home runs and 760 RBI in 1170 games. A five-time 
All-Star selection, he compiled a career .410 on-base percentage and a 
.518 slugging average for a combined .928 OPS. In his four World Series 
appearances, he batted .306 with five home runs, and 18 RBI in 19 games. 
Keller led the American League in bases on balls twice (1940 and 1943), 
batting strikeouts once (1946), and On-base plus slugging percentage once 
(1943). He did, at one time, have the 7th highest career park-adjusted 
offensive winning percentage of qualified outfielders at .762. Babe Ruth 
tops the list at .865. Although he was sometimes overlooked by some due 
to the popularity of fellow outfielder and superstar, Joe DiMaggio, according 
to Bill James' Historical Baseball Abstract, Keller had two seasons (1941, 
1946) when he was a more valuable player than DiMaggio. His career Adjusted 
On-base Percentage plus Slugging (OPS+) of 152, the sum of his On-base 
percentage plus Slugging Average adjusted for era, stadium, and other cross-time 
considerations, places him number 28 on the all-time list, ahead of a retinue 
of dozens of Hall of Famers that includes Honus Wagner, Mike Schmidt, Frank 
Robinson, Duke Snider, Willie McCovey, and Reggie Jackson. Beginning with 
his first of two 30-20-10 seasons in 1941, only several other players have 
matched the feat: Joe DiMaggio (who had done it twice before that), Willie 
Mays, Jim Rice, Hank Aaron, Stan Musial, Johnny Callison, and Duke Snider. 
Before 1941, several players had managed to have more than one 30-20-10 
season including: Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Chuck Klein, Rogers Hornsby, Jimmie 
Foxx, Earl Averill, and Hank Greenberg. The list of players who managed 
it only once – which includes Mickey Mantle, Ken Williams, Ripper Collins, 
Mel Ott, Wally Berger, Rudy York, Ernie Banks, Dick Allen, Hack Wilson, 
Mike Schmidt, Ted Williams, Andre Dawson, Dave Parker, Joe Medwick, Bob 
Meusel, Nomar Garciaparra, Ken Boyer, Ival Goodman, Steve Finley, Goose 
Goslin, Al Simmons, Dave Winfield, Vladimir Guerrero, Jim Bottomley, Curtis 
Granderson, and Jimmy Rollins – gives some indication of the power and 
versatility Keller brought to the game. Following his retirement as a player, 
Keller founded Yankeeland Farm[1] and had a successful career as a horse 
breeder – pacers and trotters – near his hometown of Middletown, Maryland. 
He named many of his horses after the franchises he played for: Fresh Yankee, 
Handsome Yankee, Yankee Slugger and Guy Yankee. He also benefited by owning 
syndicated shares of several stallions, which entitled him to free stud 
fees. Keller was elected to the Frederick County and Maryland Sports Hall 
of Fame, the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame, the International 
League Hall of Fame and the University of Maryland Hall of Fame.[2] Charlie
