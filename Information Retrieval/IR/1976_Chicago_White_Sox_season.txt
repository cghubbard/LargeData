The 1976 Chicago White Sox season was the team's 76th season in Major League 
Baseball, and its 77th season overall. They finished with a record 64-97, 
good enough for sixth place in the American League West, 25.5 games behind 
the first-place Kansas City Royals. In 1975, White Sox owner John Allyn 
was broke and placed under enormous pressure from fellow owners to sell 
his club to Seattle interests and undercut a lawsuit which Seattle had 
against them.[1] The Seattle lawsuit was directly related to the American 
League owners' approval of moving the Seattle Pilots franchise to Milwaukee. 
The AL owners also planned to appease Oakland Athletics owner Charlie Finley 
by making Chicago available to his A's.[1] Charlie wanted out of Oakland 
and had years earlier tried to buy the Sox. Everyone was lined up against 
John Allyn and Chicago's Sox fans. As fall turned to winter in 1975, Bill 
Veeck emerged as leader of the sole investment group intent on saving the 
club for Chicago and its Sox fans.[1] The AL owners reluctantly agreed 
to his offer and later voted to expand the league to include an expansion 
franchise in Seattle, Washington. Veeck purchased 80% of the White Sox, 
effective December 18, 1975. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
