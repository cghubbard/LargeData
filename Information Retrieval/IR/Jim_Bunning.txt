James Paul David "Jim" Bunning (born October 23, 1931) is an American former 
Major League Baseball pitcher and politician. During his baseball career, 
he pitched from 1955 to 1971, most notably with the Detroit Tigers and 
the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1959, the right-hander struck out the side, 
throwing the minimum nine pitches as a reliever in the top of the ninth 
inning of Detroit's 5–4 loss to Boston at Briggs Stadium. Sammy White, 
Jim Mahoney and Ike Delock were the victims of his immaculate inning. When 
Bunning retired, he had the second-highest total of career strikeouts in 
Major League history; he currently ranks 17th. As a member of the Phillies, 
Bunning pitched the seventh perfect game in Major League Baseball history 
on Father's Day Sunday, June 21, 1964, against the New York Mets. He was 
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1996. After 
retiring from baseball, Bunning returned to his native northern Kentucky 
and was elected to the city council, then the state senate, in which he 
served as minority leader. In 1986, Bunning was elected to the U.S. House 
of Representatives from Kentucky's 4th congressional district, and served 
in the House from 1987 to 1999. He was elected to the United States Senate 
from Kentucky in 1998 and served two terms as the Republican junior U.S. 
Senator. In July 2009, he announced that he would not run for re-election 
in 2010. Bunning gave his farewell speech to the Senate on December 9, 
2010, and was succeeded by current Senator Rand Paul on January 3, 2011. 
Bunning was born in Southgate, Kentucky, the son of Gladys (née Best) and 
Louis Aloysius Bunning.[1] He graduated from St. Xavier High School in 
Cincinnati in 1949[2] and received a bachelor's degree in economics from 
Xavier University. In 1952, Bunning married Mary Catherine Theis. They 
had five daughters and four sons. One of Bunning's sons, David L. Bunning, 
is a federal judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of Kentucky, who presided over the Kim Davis case. Another son, 
Bill, is the head brew master at Ye Olde Brothers Brewery in Navarre, Florida. 
Jim and Mary Catherine also have thirty-five grandchildren and fourteen 
great-grandchildren, as of 2013.[3] One of those grandchildren is Patrick 
Towles, starting quarterback for the University of Kentucky football team.[4] 
Towles uses the same number 14 that his grandfather did. Bunning's first 
game as a major league pitcher was on July 20, 1955, with the Detroit Tigers, 
after having toiled in the minor leagues 1950–1954 and part of the 1955 
season, when the Tigers club described him as having "an excellent curve 
ball, a confusing delivery and a sneaky fast ball".[5] Bunning pitched 
for the Detroit Tigers (1955–63). He then went to the Philadelphia Phillies 
(1964–67), the Pittsburgh Pirates (1968 to mid-1969), and finished the 
1969 season with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Bunning then returned to the 
Phillies in 1970 and retired in 1971. He wore uniform number 15 on the 
1955 Tigers, and then switched to 14 in 1956 for the rest of his time with 
Detroit. He stayed with number 14 on his jersey with the Phillies and Pirates. 
When he was traded to the Dodgers in 1969 he wore number 17. The Phillies 
retired his number 14 jersey in 2001 after his election to the Hall of 
Fame in 1996. Bunning is remembered for his role in the pennant race of 
1964, in which the Phillies held a commanding lead in the National League 
for most of the season, eventually losing the title to the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Manager Gene Mauch used Bunning and fellow hurler Chris Short heavily down 
the stretch, and the two became visibly fatigued as September wore on.[citation 
needed] The collapse of the 1964 Phillies remains one of the most infamous 
in baseball history.[citation needed] With a six and a half game lead as 
late as September 21, they lost 10 games in a row to finish tied for second 
place. Despite year in and year out putting up excellent numbers, Bunning 
rarely led the league in any pitching categories. He never led the league 
in ERA; the only year he led the league in wins (20, in 1957, with the 
Detroit Tigers) was the only year he ever won 20 or more games; he did, 
however, lead the league in strikeouts three times (with 201 in 1959 and 
1960, and 253 in 1967). He never won a Cy Young Award; the closest he would 
come was in 1967, his best year, when at age 35, he came in second behind 
Mike McCormick. He finished with a middling 17-15 record, but posted a 
career-best ERA (2.29), and led the league in shutouts (6), games started 
and innings pitched (40/302.1), and strikeouts (253). It was the only year 
in his career he earned any Cy Young Award votes. He did, however, win 
the NL Player of the Month Award June 1964, the month of his perfect game 
(3-0, 2.20 ERA, 42 SO). Bunning pitched his first no-hitter on July 20, 
1958, for the Detroit Tigers against the Boston Red Sox. His second, for 
the Philadelphia Phillies, was a perfect game against the New York Mets 
on Father's Day, June 21, 1964.[2] In his first season with the Phillies, 
Bunning entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season.[6] He 
was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard in the first game of a doubleheader. 
Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through 
twelve batters.[7] In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor 
preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch 
and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off the bases.[8] 
Bunning also had a good day at the plate, hitting a double and driving 
in two runs in the sixth inning.[7] By the end of the game, even the Mets 
fans were cheering Bunning's effort;[9] he had reached a three-ball count 
on only two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, 
and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete 
the perfect game.[7] Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said 
that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could not have come at a more appropriate 
time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, "'just like the no-hitter 
I pitched for Detroit six years ago'".[8] Bunning posted the first regular-season 
perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's perfect game 
was in the 1956 World Series).[10] The Phillies also won the second game 
of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise, who earned his first major 
league victory in his first start.[11] Bunning's perfect game was the first 
thrown by a National League pitcher in 84 years. It was also the first 
no-hitter by a Phillies pitcher since Johnny Lush no-hit the Brooklyn Superbas 
on May 1, 1906. He is one of only seven pitchers to throw both a perfect 
game and an additional no-hitter, the others being Randy Johnson, Sandy 
Koufax, Addie Joss, Cy Young, Mark Buehrle, and fellow Phillie Roy Halladay, 
whose additional no-hitter came in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division 
Series.[2] He was also the first of only five players to throw a no-hitter 
in both leagues, the others being Young, Johnson, Nolan Ryan and Hideo 
Nomo. On August 2, 1959, Bunning struck out three batters on nine pitches 
in the ninth inning of a 5–4 loss to the Boston Red Sox. Bunning became 
the fifth American League pitcher and the 10th pitcher in Major League 
history to accomplish the nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning. Bunning's 
2,855 career strikeouts put him in second place on the all-time list at 
the time of his retirement, behind only Walter Johnson.[12] His mark was 
later surpassed by other pitchers, and he is currently 17th all-time. In 
1996 he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame via the Veterans Committee. 
Bunning was one of the Senate's most conservative members, gaining high 
marks from several conservative interest groups. He was ranked by National 
Journal as the second-most conservative United States Senator in their 
March 2007 conservative/liberal rankings, after Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC).[13] 
First elected to office in 1977, Bunning served two years on the city council 
of Fort Thomas, Kentucky before running for and winning a seat in the Kentucky 
Senate as a Republican. He was elected minority leader by his Republican 
colleagues, a rare feat for a freshman legislator. Bunning was the Republican 
candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1983. He and his running mate Eugene 
P. Stuart lost in the general election to Democrat Martha Layne Collins. 
In 1986, Bunning won the Republican nomination in Kentucky's 4th congressional 
district, based in Kentucky's share of the Cincinnati metro area, after 
10-term incumbent Republican Gene Snyder retired. He won easily in November 
and was reelected five more times without serious opposition in what was 
considered the most Republican district in Kentucky. After the Republicans 
gained control of the House in 1995, Bunning served as chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security until 1999. In 1998, 
Senate Minority Whip Wendell Ford decided to retire after 24 years in the 
Senate—the longest term in Kentucky history (later passed by Senate Republican 
Leader Mitch McConnell). Bunning won the Republican nomination for the 
seat, and faced fellow Congressman Scotty Baesler, a Democrat from the 
Lexington-based 6th District, in the general election. Bunning defeated 
Baesler by just over half a percentage point. The race was very close; 
Bunning only won by swamping Baesler in the 4th by a margin that Baesler 
couldn't make up in the rest of the state (Baesler barely won the 6th).[citation 
needed] Bunning was 67 years old when he entered U.S. Senate. Among the 
bills that Bunning sponsored is the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance 
Reform Act of 2004. Bunning was heavily favored for a second term in 2004 
after his expected Democratic opponent, Governor Paul Patton, saw his career 
implode in a scandal over an extramarital affair, and the Democrats chose 
Daniel Mongiardo, a relatively unknown physician and state senator from 
Hazard. Bunning had an estimated $4 million campaign war chest, while Mongiardo 
had only $600,000. However, due to a number of controversial incidents 
involving Bunning, the Democrats began increasing financial support to 
Mongiardo when it became apparent that Bunning's bizarre behavior was costing 
him votes, purchasing more than $800,000 worth of additional television 
airtime on his behalf. During his reelection bid, controversy erupted when 
Bunning described Mongiardo as looking "like one of Saddam Hussein's sons."[14] 
Public pressure compelled him to apologize. Bunning was also criticized 
for his use of a teleprompter during a televised debate with Mongiardo 
where Bunning participated via satellite link, refusing to appear in person.[15] 
Bunning was further criticized for making an unsubstantiated claim that 
his wife had been attacked by Mongiardo's supporters,[16] and for calling 
Mongiardo "limp wristed".[14] Bunning's mental health was also questioned 
during the campaign.[14] In October 2004 Bunning told reporters "Let me 
explain something: I don't watch the national news, and I don't read the 
paper. I haven't done that for the last six weeks. I watch Fox News to 
get my information."[17] The race turned out to be very close, with Mongiardo 
leading with as many as 80% of the returns coming in. However, Bunning 
eventually won by just over one percentage point after the western portion 
of the state broke heavily for him. As was expected in light of Bunning's 
previous career as a baseball player, he has been very interested in Congress's 
investigation of steroid use in baseball. Bunning has also been outspoken 
on the issue of illegal immigration taking the position that all illegal 
immigrants should be deported. Bunning was also the only member of the 
United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to 
have opposed Ben Bernanke for Chief of the Federal Reserve.[18] He said 
it was because he had doubts that Bernanke would be any different from 
Alan Greenspan. In April 2006, Time magazine called him one of America's 
Five Worst Senators.[19] The magazine dubbed him 'The Underperformer' for 
his "lackluster performance", saying he "shows little interest in policy 
unless it involves baseball", and criticized his hostility towards staff 
and fellow Senators and his "bizarre behavior" during his 2004 campaign.[20] 
On December 6, 2006, only Bunning and Rick Santorum voted against the confirmation 
of Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense, with Bunning saying that "Mr. 
Gates has repeatedly criticized our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan without 
providing any viable solutions to the problems our troops currently face. 
We need a secretary of defense to think forward with solutions and not 
backward on history we cannot change." Jim Bunning reportedly blocked[21] 
the move to restore public access to the records of past United States 
Presidents which had been removed under Executive Order 13233. A September 
2009 statewide opinion poll said Bunning had a 35% approval rating, with 
55% disapproving of his performance.[22] In January 2009, Bunning missed 
more than a week of the start of Congress in January 2009. Bunning said 
by phone that he was fulfilling "a family commitment six months ago to 
do certain things, and I'm doing them." Asked whether he would say where 
he was, Bunning replied: "No, I'd rather not."[23] In February 2009, at 
the Hardin County Republican Party's Lincoln Day Dinner, while discussing 
conservative judges, Bunning predicted that Supreme Court Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg would likely be dead from pancreatic cancer within nine 
months.[24] Bunning later apologized if he had offended Ginsburg with his 
remarks and offered his thoughts and prayers to Ginsburg.[25] Bunning was 
the only senator to miss the Senate's historic Christmas Eve 2009 vote 
on the health care reform bill; he cited family commitments as his reason 
for missing the vote. The bill passed without any Republican votes, 60–39.[26][27][28] 
On February 25, 2010, Bunning objected to a proposal of unanimous consent 
for an extension of unemployment insurance, COBRA, and other federal programs, 
citing that this extension was not pay-as-you-go. He proposed an amendment 
which sought to find the funds to pay for the bill from the Stimulus Bill 
of 2009, and declared that he supported the unemployed, but that a bill 
such as this only adds to the growing deficit and that it should be paid 
for immediately.[29][30] I have offered to do the same thing for the same 
amount of time. The only difference that I have....is that I believe we 
should pay for it....There are going to be other bills brought to this 
floor that are not going to be paid for, and I'm going to object every 
time they do it.[31] Senator Bob Corker joined Bunning, while other senators 
worked to cease his objections until 11:48 pm EST. When Senator Jeff Merkley 
urged him to drop his objections to vote on a 30-day extension of benefits, 
Bunning responded "tough shit."[32] On March 2, Bunning finally agreed 
to end his objection to the bill in exchange for a vote on his amendment 
to pay for the package. It failed 53–43 on a procedural vote.[33] The extension 
of unemployment benefits then passed by a vote of 78–19.[34] In January 
2009, when asked whether Bunning was the best candidate to run or whether 
there were better GOP candidates for Bunning's Senate seat, National Republican 
Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn said: "I don't know. I think 
it's really up to Senator Bunning." Bunning replied: "Anybody can run for 
anything they choose. I am gearing up, and I look forward to the challenge 
of taking on whoever comes out of the Democrat primary in May of 2010."[35] 
Kentucky State Senate President David L. Williams was reportedly considering 
running against Bunning in the primary.[36] Bunning responded by threatening 
to sue the National Republican Senatorial Committee if they recruited a 
candidate to run against him in the primary. He also attacked NRSC Chairman 
John Cornyn: The NRSC never helped me last time and they're probably not 
going to help me this time ... [David Williams] owes me $30,000 and he 
said he'll repay me. I was short in my FEC money and he asked me if I would 
help save two state senate seats ... I told him if I did it I would have 
to have it replaced at the first of the year. So far he has not.[37] As 
of the end of September 2008, Bunning had $175,000 in his campaign account. 
By comparison, all other Republican senators facing competitive 2010 races 
had at least $850,000 at that point.[35] In the last quarter of 2008, the 
senator's campaign committee Citizens for Bunning had raised $27,000 from 
26 separate contributions, ending the year with $150,000 in cash.[38] In 
mid-April, KYWORDSMITH.com reported that of the $263,000 that Bunning collected 
during the first quarter of 2009, over 77% ($203,383) was received from 
out of state, while over 10% ($28,100) was actually untouchable for another 
13 months as it was contributed exclusively for use in a general election.[39] 
Bunning had two fund raisers scheduled in the first half of April.[40] 
In an April 2009 poll, Bunning's approval rating was just 28%, and he trailed 
the four most likely Democratic candidates in hypothetical contests. 54% 
of voters in the state disapproved of Bunning's performance.[41] Kentucky 
Secretary of State Trey Grayson announced on April 30, 2009, that he would 
form an exploratory committee to run for Bunning's seat. It was speculated 
that this was a precursor to Bunning's retirement. "He (Bunning) told Trey 
to do this", one senior congressional official said of Bunning. "Why else 
would he tell his main rival to prepare for a run?" [42] However, Bunning 
said at a Lincoln Day dinner in Kentucky on 9 May that he still planned 
to run: "The battle is going to be long, but I am prepared to fight for 
my values."[43] In a press conference on May 19, Bunning called Senate 
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell a "control freak": "If Mitch McConnell 
doesn't endorse me, it could be the best thing that ever happened to me 
in Kentucky."[44] On July 27, 2009, Bunning announced he would not run 
for re-election in 2010, blaming fellow Republicans for doing "everything 
in their power to dry up my fundraising."[45] On April 14, 2010, in a further 
show of disdain for GOP leadership and insiders, Bunning announced his 
support for outsider candidate Rand Paul over establishment favorite Trey 
Grayson.[46] On December 18, 2008, the Lexington Herald Leader reported 
that Sen. Bunning's non-profit foundation, the Jim Bunning Foundation, 
has given less than 25 percent of its proceeds to charity. The charity 
has taken in $504,000 since 1996, according to Senate and tax records; 
during that period, Senator Bunning was paid $180,000 in salary by the 
foundation while working a reported one hour per week. Bunning Foundation 
board members include his wife Mary, and Cincinnati tire dealer Bob Sumerel. 
In 2008, records indicate that Bunning attended 10 baseball shows around 
the country and signed autographs, generating $61,631 in income for the 
charity.[47] "The whole thing is very troubling", said Melanie Sloan, Executive 
Director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. *In 
1986, Walter T. Marksberry received 735 votes, W. Ed Parker received 485 
votes, and other write-ins received 11 votes. In 2005 Bunning received 
the United States Sports Academy's highest honor, the Eagle Award, which 
is given in recognition of an individual's significant contributions to 
international sport.[49] The 1996 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, 
held in Philadelphia, was dedicated to Bunning and fellow Phillies legends 
Richie Ashburn, Steve Carlton, Robin Roberts and Mike Schmidt, all of whom 
threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Italics denotes post-season perfect game
