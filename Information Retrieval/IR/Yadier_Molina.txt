MLB Yadier Benjamin Molina (Spanish pronunciation: [ʝaˈdjer moˈlina]; born 
July 13, 1982), also known as "Yadi", is a Puerto Rican professional baseball 
catcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). A winner 
of two World Series and four National League pennants, he is considered 
an essential figure in the Cardinals' postseason success, with nine appearances 
in his first twelve seasons. Considered one of the top defensive catchers 
of all time, his awards include seven consecutive selections to the All 
Star Game, eight consecutive Gold Gloves, four Platinum Gloves, and one 
Silver Slugger. Offensively, he has accrued more than 1,500 hits, 100 home 
runs, 600 runs batted in, and a .284 batting average. In international 
competition, he has represented Puerto Rico in all three tournaments of 
the World Baseball Classic (WBC), and in 2013, was the runner-up and an 
All-WBC Team selection. Coming from a baseball family, Molina grew up in 
Vega Alta, Puerto Rico. His father was an amateur second baseman and the 
all-time hits leader in Puerto Rican baseball, and his two older brothers, 
Bengie and José, were also defensive standouts as catchers with lengthy 
MLB careers. Molina's pitch-handling and throwing skills originally caught 
the attention of scouts before being drafted. The Cardinals' fourth round 
selection in the 2000 MLB draft, he made his MLB debut four years later, 
quickly garnering a reputation for possessing one of the strongest and 
most accurate arms in the game. As of 2016, he had thrown out 41.69% of 
runners attempting a stolen base over his career, which is currently 184th 
all time and led active MLB catchers with 55 pickoffs.[1] Molina also formulates 
fielder positioning plans and complete pitching strategies to opposing 
hitters, earning a reputation as an on-field leader. Initially considered 
a light hitter, Molina significantly improved his offense and raised his 
career batting average from .248 in 2007. Through 2015, he had a .286 career 
batting average in the postseason. In 2006, he became just the third catcher 
to play in two World Series before age 25, following Johnny Bench and Yogi 
Berra. He became the all-time Cardinals' leader in games caught with 1,439 
on April 8, 2016. Molina is under contract through 2017. Molina was born 
in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, to Gladys Matta and Benjamín Molina, Sr. and attended 
Maestro Ladíslao Martínez High School in Vega Alta. Molina's father played 
second base as an amateur and worked as a tools technician ten hours per 
day in a Westinghouse factory. He was a .320 lifetime hitter and the all-time 
hits leader in the Doble-A Beísbol league, gaining election to the Puerto 
Rican baseball hall of fame in 2002. Molina's two older brothers, Bengie 
and José, eventually also became major league catchers.[2] Each day when 
he completed work, Molina directly went home, ate dinner and crossed the 
street from his family's home with his sons to Jesús Mambe Kuilan Park, 
where he spent countless evening hours teaching them the fundamentals of 
the sport.[3] He remained hopeful that his sons would become professional 
baseball players.[4] Molina's catching aptitude showed as early as age 
five, and he developed quickly.[3] Nonetheless, he played all over the 
baseball field, and as Bengie Molina recalled, always seemed to "be the 
first player taken in the youth league draft."[4] Molina concentrated on 
infield positions until about age 16, when he began developing into the 
familiar Molina physique; as of 2013, he stood 5'11" and weighed 220 pounds.[5] 
Molina's father also sought to accelerate him on the diamond. Following 
a suspension from his youth league about age 15, Benjamín Molina anticipated 
the desistance would stagnate his development, so he searched for an alternative. 
Against the wishes of coaches, family members and friends, he scheduled 
Yadier for a workout with the Hatillo Tigres, an amateur league team. Molina 
made the team after a single workout and immediately became the starting 
catcher.[4] The Tigres' first baseman, Luís Rosario, was the one that recommended 
him to the organization.[6] The Tigres played in a league composed mainly 
of players ten or more years older than Molina, well before he was eligible 
for the Major League Baseball draft.[7] Minnesota Twins scout Edwin Rodríguez 
scrutinized Molina starting in high school. He observed that Molina's skills 
closely resembled that of both his older brothers – both accomplished major 
league catchers[8][9] – and decided that his defense was "polished" enough 
to be considered more advanced than most high schoolers in the United States. 
However, Molina's hitting lagged behind his defense. The initial report 
on his skill set was "defensive catcher, great arm, weak bat"; his closest 
comparable hitter as catcher was one who the Cardinals eventually placed 
at the top of their organizational ladder, and his future manager, Mike 
Matheny.[10] Before he was drafted, Molina worked out for the Cincinnati 
Reds. He put on a spectacle at Riverfront Stadium with his arm and bat 
that grabbed the attention of executives, scouts, and prominent former 
Reds players, including Johnny Bench and Bob Boone. As Molina recalled, 
he left the session with the impression the Reds intended to draft him.[11] 
Undeterred by the universal reservations about his offensive ceiling, the 
St. Louis Cardinals instead took Molina in the fourth round of the 2000 
MLB draft and signed him for $325,000.[10][12] "I saw the kid that's going 
to steal my job." The Cardinals invited Molina to major league spring training 
camp following his draft. Although described as "raw," the young catcher 
purposed with fascination to emulate Matheny.[13]At one point in that extended 
spring training, Cardinals instructor Dave Ricketts observed Molina from 
a golf cart during a game as he was still learning how to catch; he had 
been transitioning from third base. After allowing a passed ball through 
his legs with a runner on third base, Molina raced to the backstop to retrieve 
the ball. Still hoping to prevent the runner from scoring, he instead found 
Ricketts in the golf cart parked on top of home plate. Ricketts had a reputation 
for getting upset when Cardinals minor league catchers allowed balls to 
bounce between their legs; for this, he removed Molina from the game and 
drove him to the batting cage. There, Ricketts batted 150 to 200 ground 
balls, as Molina estimated, to improve the young catcher's ability to block 
pitches.[14] Molina began his professional career with the Johnson City 
Cardinals of the Rookie-level Appalachian League in 2001, playing 44 total 
games and batting .259. He advanced one level in each of four seasons in 
the minor leagues. Even without highly developed offensive skills, Molina 
proved difficult to strike out. Mainly a singles hitter who favored hitting 
the ball the other way, he batted .278 with 14 home runs and 133 runs batted 
in (RBI) with 118 strikeouts in 1,044 at bats in four minor league seasons. 
In his first three seasons, he threw out 111 base runners attempting to 
steal while allowing 133 stolen bases, for a caught-stealing percentage 
of 45%.[10][15] Molina's first chance in the Major Leagues arrived when 
incumbent Matheny went on the disabled list (DL) with a strained rib in 
the Cardinals' pennant-winning season of 2004. Molina made his Major League 
debut on June 3.[13] One of his first game-winning hits occurred on August 
7. He stroked a broken-bat single to shallow center field in the bottom 
of the ninth inning against the New York Mets that center fielder Mike 
Cameron did not recognize had splintered, allowing Jim Edmonds to score.[16] 
Three weeks later (August 29), the Cardinals were victorious over the Pittsburgh 
Pirates 6–4 thanks in part to two separate plays in which Molina tagged 
out the runner at home plate, including a collision with Ty Wigginton.[17] 
Molina appeared in 51 regular-season games and batted .267 with two home 
runs and 15 RBI in 151 plate appearances.[1] He made an immediate impact 
with his arm, throwing out more than 50% percent of would-be basestealers 
(nine of 17).[12] In the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, manager 
Tony La Russa elected to start Molina over Matheny in Game 4.[18] The Red 
Sox swept the Cardinals and claimed the title that game, their first in 
86 years.[19] The following offseason, Matheny signed a three-year, $10.5-million 
contract with the San Francisco Giants, clearing the way for Molina to 
become the Cardinals' starting catcher.[20] In 2005, Molina struggled with 
injuries and saw a drop off in the offensive performance in his rookie 
season. He doubled and scored on David Eckstein's go-ahead single on his 
way to three hits in a June 12 defeat of the New York Yankees, 5–3.[21] 
Molina returned from a 33-game absence on August 19 induced by a hairline 
fracture of his left fifth metacarpal bone from being hit by a pitch on 
July 7.[22] Starting pitcher Chris Carpenter, attempting to extend a winning 
streak to ten games on an August 20 game versus the San Francisco Giants, 
found himself in a 4–0 deficit in the ninth inning. Capped by Molina's 
three-run home run, the Cardinals rallied and won 5–4 in the ninth.[23] 
The next day, Molina's suicide squeeze bunt scored Mark Grudzielanek, tying 
the game and allowing the Cardinals to win 4–2.[24] Those were just two 
wins of 100 as St. Louis made their way to another division title following 
105 wins the season before.[25][26] In 114 games, Molina posted a .252 
batting average with eight home runs and 49 RBI with just 30 strikeouts 
in 421 plate appearances. Defensively, he registered career-highs of nine 
pickoffs and a 64% caught-stealing percentage from throwing out 25 of 39 
would-be basestealers.[1] According to Baseball-Reference.com, as of 2013, 
that percentage ranked as the 26th-highest all-time season-single caught 
stealing percentage. Further, it was the second-highest figure since 1957; 
only Mike LaValliere's 1993 figure of 72.7% was higher during that time 
period.[27] Before the 2006 season commenced, Molina participated in the 
inaugural World Baseball Classic (WBC) for Puerto Rico. After returning 
to the Cardinals, he changed his jersey number from 41 to 4. However, the 
regular season presented some of his greatest offensive challenges as he 
struggled through a career-worst .216 batting average in 461 regular-season 
plate appearances. In fact, in a culmination of a three-year downward trend 
in his offense, Molina's on-base plus slugging percentages declined from 
.684 in 2004, .654 in 2005 and a career-worst .595 in 2006.[1] The low 
batting average was due in part to a deflated batting average on balls 
in play (BABIP) of .226 (normal is around .300), a career low.[a][28] In 
a May 27 game against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park in San Diego with 
the Cardinals holding a 4–3 lead in the bottom of the ninth, Molina picked 
Brian Giles off first to end the game,[29] the first pickoff to end a major 
league game in nearly four years.[30] The Cardinals faced the Padres again 
in the National League Division Series (NLDS) playoff game in the playoffs, 
he again picked a Padre off at first, this time Mike Piazza, while bailing 
pitcher Jeff Suppan out of a jam.[29] For the season, he caught 41% of 
all base-stealing attempts and picked off seven runners.[12] Even as his 
bat languished, Molina's defense was instrumental in propelling the Cardinals 
to the National League Central division crown in a season heavily marred 
by injuries.[31] However, the following playoffs marked a turning point 
in his career offensive output. He posted a .358 composite batting average, 
.424 on-base percentage (OBP), two home runs and eight RBI in 16 games 
as the Cardinals reached the World Series.[1][12] He batted .308 in the 
National League Division Series (NLDS), .348 in the National League Championship 
Series (NLCS) and .412 in the World Series.[1] One of Molina's landmark 
playoff performances came in Game 7 of the NLCS against the New York Mets, 
the final game of the series tied at three games each. Starting in the 
top of the ninth, he batted with a 1–1 score. In the sixth inning, Mets 
left fielder Endy Chávez had prevented the Cardinals from taking the lead 
when he leapt to catch Scott Rolen's near-miss home run over the center 
field fence. This time, however, Molina hit a two-run home run off Aaron 
Heilman over center field that was too high for Chávez to catch and gave 
the Cardinals a 3–1 edge.[32] In the bottom of the ninth, rookie pitcher 
Adam Wainwright – filling in as an emergency closer – found himself in 
a two-out, bases-loaded situation against center fielder Carlos Beltrán, 
who had already homered three times in the NLCS. Molina called for a mound 
conference. Initially, he wanted a sinker from Wainwright but changed his 
mind because he suspected he would overthrow it and give Beltrán an easy 
pitch to hit. He made an unconventional choice by calling for a changeup 
to start the sequence against Beltrán. It was called for a strike. Had 
Beltrán successfully got a base hit, the scheme may have caused tension 
for the third-year catcher with La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan 
because throwing a first-pitch changeup ran contrary to Duncan's teaching. 
Molina then called for two curveballs. Beltrán fouled off the first, but 
Wainwright struck him out looking at a "bender that started up and away 
and bit hard to the low inside corner" for the final out of the game. The 
Cardinals' conquest of the NLCS gave them a return trip to the World Series 
after two years. They proceeded to defeat the Detroit Tigers in five games, 
giving Molina his first championship ring.[5][33][34] His mask was turned 
in for display at the Baseball Hall of Fame.[35] Batting out of the number-five 
spot in the batting order for the first time in his career on Opening Day, 
2007, Molina collected two hits. In a game against the Milwaukee Brewers 
on April 15, Molina picked Prince Fielder off first base as he leaned far 
off the bag, tipping off Molina and first baseman Albert Pujols to a hit 
and run the Brewers were planning.[29] Four days later, Molina faced his 
brother Bengie for the first time in a game against the San Francisco Giants. 
It was also the first time they had seen each other in about three and 
one-half years.[36] From May 1 to May 24, Molina strung together a then-career 
high 15-game hitting streak, during which he batted .373. It was the longest 
streak for a Cardinals catcher since Erik Pappas' 16-game streak in 1993.[37] 
Molina was absent for most of the month of June due of a fractured left 
wrist.[12][38] In the third inning of the May 29 game against Colorado, 
he took a foul tip off his wrist from Rockies right fielder Brad Hawpe's 
bat. After missing 26 games, the Cardinals activated him from the disabled 
list on June 28.[37] The first multi-error game of Molina's career occurred 
July 13 against the Philadelphia Phillies on a catch and throw. In a span 
of 11 starts from August 2–16, he racked up four three-hit games. On August 
16, he hit two home runs against the Brewers for his first career multi-homer 
game. Molina homered and stroked the go-ahead double in an August 22 defeat 
of Florida. One week later, he homered in back-to-back games against the 
Cincinnati Reds; he, Edmonds, and Rick Ankiel each drove in three runs 
in an 11–3 victory on September 2.[39] On Yadier Molina Bobblehead Night 
September 19 versus Philadelphia, he stroked three hits including the game-winning 
single in the tenth inning.[37] Molina suffered a concussion in September 
and underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right 
knee. The knee surgery ended his season early on September 24.[12][38] 
In Molina's final 50 games, he successfully collected 49 hits in 158 AB 
for a .310 AVG. Of his final 35 starts, 12 were multi-hit games. His .281 
batting average after the All-Star break ranked fifth among NL catchers.[37] 
He finished the season with a new career-best .275 batting average, six 
home runs, and 40 RBI in 111 games.[1] He threw out 50% (23 of 46) baserunners 
attempting to steal, the highest percentage in the majors. From 2005–07, 
he led all MLB with a 47% caught-stealing rate and 18 pick-offs.[37] On 
January 14, 2008, Molina and the Cardinals agreed to a four-year, $15.5 
million deal with a club option for a fifth, cementing his position as 
their starting catcher. He reported to spring training having lost 15 pounds 
and in improved physical shape from rehabilitating following knee surgery.[40] 
He started the season with an Opening Day home run and seven-game hitting 
streak.[41] After a home plate collision with Eric Bruntlett on June 15 
against the Philadelphia Phillies in the ninth inning, Molina sustained 
head and neck injuries and was removed from the field on a stretcher. There 
were no indications of a concussion.[42] He held on to the ball to help 
the Cardinals win.[41] He missed the next four games.[43] To that point, 
Molina was batting .295 with three home runs and 24 RBI. He also had thrown 
out 10 of 32 baserunners (31.3%) – well below his career average of 45% 
– but an Associated Press reporter attributed the decline to an inexperienced 
pitching staff.[44] Molina returned to the field against Boston at Fenway 
Park as the designated hitter. In that game, his solo home run provided 
the difference in a 5–4 Cardinals victory. It was also the first game of 
the first of two 13-game hitting streaks for the season. His first career 
start at first base, also against Boston, occurred two days later. During 
that streak, he collected 17 hits in 47 at-bats for a .362 batting average. 
The second hitting streak spanned from August 16 to September 2, where 
he successfully hit 19 times in 50 at bats for a .380 average.[41] On September 
2, he and Felipe López hit consecutive home runs against the Arizona Diamondbacks 
en route to an 8–2 victory.[45] Overall, Molina enjoyed a breakout offensive 
season, finishing with new career highs with a .304 batting average – his 
first over .300 – and in hits (135), OBP (.349), SLG (.392), runs (37) 
and RBI (56). Of all catchers in franchise history with at least 450 PA 
in a season, he became just the second ever, after Simmons, to bat over 
.300; it was then the fourth-best season batting average; and, his 29 strikeouts 
were the fewest since Simmons fanned 20 times in 1976. Molina led the team 
and was sixth in the NL with a .340 batting average with runners in scoring 
position.[41] For the season, he successfully caught 35% of opposing baserunners, 
still higher than the league average of 27%.[1] He led all MLB with seven 
pickoffs. That November, Molina received his first Gold Glove Award, becoming 
the third Cardinal catcher ever to win the honor, after Tom Pagnozzi and 
Matheny.[41] Before the 2009 season commenced, Molina participated with 
Puerto Rico in his second WBC. When the event concluded, he returned to 
the Cardinals. In an April 16 game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, he 
reached base in all five of his plate appearances in a 12–7 victory.[46] 
Starting pitcher Joel Piñeiro – struggling with his fastball command in 
previous starts – experimented with a sinker and shut out the New York 
Mets on June 24 with just two hits. Molina erased a Mets runner by throwing 
out Luis Castillo attempting to steal second base.[47] Molina was batting 
.278 with five home runs and 25 RBI through July 5, 2009. He was selected 
through fan vote to represent the Cardinals in the All-Star Game in St. 
Louis' Busch Stadium – his first All-Star Game.[48] As the top vote-getter 
among NL catchers with 2,641,467 votes, Molina was named the NL's starting 
catcher.[49][50] He caught eight innings and drove home a run.[51] Following 
the All-Star break on July 18, Molina's four hits and Albert Pujols' two 
home runs helped cap Chris Carpenter's 6–1 victory over the Diamondbacks, 
who pitched around nine runners on base in eight innings.[52] On August 
15, Molina picked off San Diego's Kevin Kouzmanoff at first on the way 
to a 7–4 victory, the 33rd of his career.[53] At that point, Bill James 
Online rated that Molina saved his team fifteen total runs from pickoffs 
alone in his career.[54] A sore left knee sustained after taking a foul 
ball of his kneecap temporarily disabled Molina on September 26. He was 
back in action on October 1 against Cincinnati, although he was removed 
from that game due to a "tweaked" knee.[55] He finished the season with 
a .293 batting average, six home runs, 54 RBI, and a major league-leading 
136 games caught, the highest franchise total since Ted Simmons' total 
in 1977.[12] His strikeout rate of once every 13.9 PA was the second-lowest 
in the NL. While accumulating 39 mult-hit games, the Cardinals won 27 of 
them. He led the major leagues with eight pickoffs and was second in the 
NL in innings caught.[51] He also won his second Gold Glove award after 
the season.[1][12] The Sporting News announced that major league managers 
and coaches had selected Molina for the magazine's end-of-season All-Star 
award.[56] For the first time in his career, Molina earned Most Valuable 
Player Award (MVP) consideration. He finished tied for 23rd with Miguel 
Tejada with one percent of the vote share.[57] On Opening Day, April 5, 
2010, Molina connected for a grand slam, becoming just the third Cardinals 
player to hit an Opening Day grand slam, following Mark McGwire and Scott 
Rolen.[58] On April 17, he caught all 20 innings of a game against the 
Mets.[59] Molina turned in a productive April, driving in 15 runners, the 
most for a Cardinals catcher in the month of April since Ted Simmons drove 
in 20 in 1977. He also continued his productivity with the bases loaded 
that month, collecting four hits and 11 RBI in five at bats.[60] Before 
the All-Star break, Molina batted just .223. However, he was voted to start 
his second consecutive game, and second overall, and played four innings.[61] 
After the All-Star break, his hitting improved, as he stroked 63 hits in 
200 at bats for .315 batting average. During a game against the Cincinnati 
Reds on August 10, as second baseman Brandon Phillips came to bat, he exchanged 
words with Molina that escalated to a bench-clearing confrontation, although 
no one was ejected.[62] On September 17, he amassed a career-high five 
RBI and career-tying four hits against San Diego, including two doubles.[61] 
After an examination on his sore right knee on September 23, Molina was 
shut down for the rest of the season, missing 12 games.[63][64] The final 
batting results for Molina's 2010 season consisted of a .262 batting average, 
six home runs, and 62 RBI. He ranked as the fourth toughest in the NL to 
strike out with 10.2 at bats per strikeout. He led all NL catchers in at-bats 
(465) and stolen bases (eight), and his 122 hits ranked second, just behind 
Brian McCann's 123. He was tops in the NL with 24 bases-loaded RBI, collecting 
eight hits in 15 AB for a .533 batting average in those situations. He 
also was first in the Majors with a .455 batting average (10–22) on 0–2 
counts. He led all MLB catchers in innings (1138.0), games started (130) 
and assists (79),[61] and led the NL for the third time in caught-stealing 
percentage at 49%.[1] On November 1, he won his fourth consecutive Fielding 
Bible Award as the sole catcher. In addition, Molina became the first player 
at any position to win the award unanimously with a perfect score of 100.[65] 
Nine days later, he was awarded his third consecutive Gold Glove Award.[66] 
With increased offensive productivity in 2011, Molina continued to help 
anchor the middle of Cardinals lineup in addition to the pitching staff 
and defense. From May 15 to May 18, he put together four consecutive multi-hit 
games. Selected to his third consecutive All-Star Game, he substituted 
for the starter, McCann, played four innings and doubled in his only at-bat. 
Molina hit safety in 14 consecutive games from July 21 to August 11, one 
fewer than his career high. From July 22–25, he homered in three consecutive 
games, the second time in his career he had done so.[67] On August 2, Molina 
was ejected from a game against the Milwaukee Brewers for arguing a called 
strike. He bumped umpire Rob Drake in the chest multiple times and appeared 
to spit upon him. Molina later apologized, stating that he did not intend 
to spit on the umpire and that he "was caught up in the moment. That's 
what happens when you're caught up in the race and trying to win. I didn't 
handle it the right way." He served a five-game suspension handed down 
by MLB for "making contact with umpire Rob Drake multiple times and spraying 
him with spit twice while arguing."[68][69][70] Although the Cardinals 
stayed competitive, they were, at best, on the fringes of making the playoffs 
through August. As of August 28, with a 70–64 record, they faced a 10 1⁄2-game 
deficit to the Braves for the wild card playoff berth with 28 left to play. 
Molina provided a spark to the offense in the close of the season, batting 
.342 in August and .341 in September.[67] With his 30th double on September 
21, he became the fourth catcher in Cardinals history to reach that milestone, 
following Simmons, Bob O'Farrell and Walker Cooper.[71] St. Louis won 20 
of 28 games to finish the season, allowing them to tie the Braves for the 
wild card lead going into the final day. Molina caught Carpenter's 8–0 
shutout of the Astros, the final game of the regular season.[72] Meanwhile, 
the Philles defeated the Braves 4–3 in 13 innings, giving the Cardinals 
the wild card title and eliminating the Braves from the playoffs. The 10 1⁄2 
games-won deficit marked the largest lead surrendered with 28 left to play 
in MLB history,[73] consummating what St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter 
Bernie Miklasz termed an "improbable comeback,"[74] and one of the greatest 
sports history. It was just the first in a series of improbable comebacks 
for the Cardinals in 2011. Molina compiled a .305 batting average, 32 doubles, 
14 home runs and 65 RBI during the 2011 regular season. His batting average 
led the Cardinals and was eighth in the NL. However, his posted a career-low 
29% caught-stealing percentage.[1][12] His OPS+ (126),[75] batting average, 
and hit totals led NL catchers, doubles placed second and RBI third. His 
.337 batting average following the All-Star Break tied for seventh in the 
NL. He also led all NL catchers with 12 three-hit games, and collated 39 
multi-hit games and 13 multi-RBI games.[67] By making the playoffs, Molina 
became the first catcher in franchise history to appear in five postseasons 
for the Cardinals. He batted .333 in the NLCS against Milwaukee, including 
five hits in eight AB in the final two games.[67] In Game 1 of the World 
Series against the Texas Rangers, Molina threw out Ian Kinsler attempting 
to steal in the first inning on the way to a 3–2 win. It was the Rangers' 
only attempted steal of the game. That caught stealing gave Molina five 
in seven total chances in the 2011 postseason to that point; the Rangers 
had been tied with the Cardinals for most steals in that postseason.[76] 
For the series, the Rangers attempted to steal four bases and were successful 
just once.[77] In Game 3, Molina accumulated four RBI, and two more each 
in Games 6 and 7.[67] The Cardinals won the Series in seven games, giving 
Molina his second championship ring. He batted .333 and set a team World 
Series record with nine RBI.[12] It was the highest World Series RBI total 
among catchers since Sandy Alomar, Jr., drove in 10 in 1997. Molina started 
all 18 games and played every inning in that 2011 playoff run, including 
one at first. Overall, he batted .299 with five doubles and 12 RBI. His 
20 hits were the most by a catcher in the postseason since Iván Rodríguez 
stroked 21 in 2003.[67] On November 1, Molina won his fourth consecutive 
Gold Glove Award,[78] becoming just the fifth catcher on a pennant-winning 
club to lead his position in OPS+ in his league while winning a Gold Glove.[75] 
He also won the first-ever National League Rawlings Platinum Glove Award, 
bestowed upon one player in each league.[79] For the second time in his 
career, he won MVP consideration; he finished tied for 21st for the NL 
MVP balloting.[80] On March 1, 2012, Molina signed a five-year extension 
with the Cardinals worth $75 million through 2017. The contract included 
a $1 million signing bonus, no-trade clause, and a mutual option for 2018 
worth another $15 million.[81][82] The deal made him the second-highest-paid 
catcher in the majors.[83] He collected his tenth career four-hit game 
against the Brewers on April 29 with a two-run home run that led the Cardinals 
to a 7–3 win.[84] On May 1, Molina mounted the first of two two-stolen 
base games of the season; the other occurred August 3.[85] On May 27 against 
the Phillies, Molina blasted his third career grand slam against Roy Halladay. 
His made his 1,000th career appearance in an MLB game against the Chicago 
White Sox on June 12. From July 25 to August 7, he maintained a season-best 
11-game hitting streak in which he batted .413.[85] In a game against Pittsburgh 
at PNC Park on August 28, he sustained head, neck and back injuries – although 
no concussion – in a second-inning home plate collision with second baseman 
Josh Harrison.[86] In August, he batted .403 with a .453 OBP, both tied 
for third in the NL.[85] As the season progressed, he garnered widespread 
consideration for the National League MVP award.[87][88] On September 4, 
Molina collected his 1,000th career hit, an infield single against the 
Mets at home in the second inning.[89] The 2012 season was one of Molina's 
crowning achievements as a hitter, especially considering early professional 
scouting reports did not forecast his bat being much of a factor in the 
major leagues. He set new career highs in multiple offensive categories, 
including a .315 batting average, 22 home runs, 76 RBI, 65 runs scored, 
.373 OBP, .501 slugging percentage and 12 stolen bases.[1] He led the team 
in batting average for the second straight season, thus becoming the first 
catcher in franchise history to do so.[13] Panning Molina's performance 
National League-wide, he ranked fourth batting,[1] tenth in OBP, 14th in 
SLG and tied for 18th with 46 multihit games. He led NL catchers in stolen 
bases and set a Cardinals single-season record for catchers,[12] and ranked 
second among NL catchers in HR and third in RBI and batting average.[85] 
An aggressive hitter, he batted .380 with seven HR on the first pitch; 
the HR total on first pitches ranked seventh in the NL. His 32 baserunners 
caught stealing topped MLB, 47.9 caught stealing percentage ranked second, 
and three pickoffs tied for first in the NL and were second in MLB.[85] 
From a historic perspective, Fangraphs' Dave Cameron noted that Molina's 
combination of offensive productivity and interception of base runners 
in 2012 was one of the rarest performances in history. He became just the 
ninth MLB catcher to post a season with a weighted runs created (WRC+)[b] 
factor of 140 and 45 percent of runners caught stealing. At 143, his WRC+ 
was tied for eighth all-time among catchers with at 45% of base runners 
caught stealing. Further, those figures aligned with peak seasons of other 
catchers such as Johnny Bench, Elston Howard, Carlton Fisk, and Rick Wilkins.[90] 
After being the subject of much speculation for the MVP award throughout 
the season, Molina ultimately finished fourth. He and winner Buster Posey 
became the first pair of catchers to finish in the top four in the award's 
88-year history.[91] However, like in years past, other awards were on 
their way. In November, he won his fifth straight Gold Glove award, making 
him the first Cardinal since Jim Edmonds to win that many consecutively,[92] 
which Edmonds did in 2004. On December 4, he won his first GIBBY Award 
for Defensive Player of the Year.[93] The St. Louis chapter of the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) named him the St. Louis Baseball 
Man of the Year for 2012.[37] In a Los Angeles Times report that published 
the top MLB jersey sales from the All-Star break until October 1, his jersey 
ranked 18th.[94] With increased profile coming in conjunction with his 
offensive breakout from the year before, Molina's popularity with fans 
around the game also increased. Following his 2012 fourth-place MVP finish, 
his 2013 in-season jersey sales rose to third place, just after Posey and 
retiring New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, according to a July 11 
report.[95] On June 2 he was ejected by 1st base umpire Clint Fagan for 
throwing his helmet. Molina collected two doubles in a three-hit game on 
June 12, giving him 21 doubles for the season, a pre-All-Star break career 
high. It was also the second-highest pre-All-Star break total in franchise 
history following Ted Simmons' 29 thirty-five years earlier. That three-hit 
game also gave Molina 78 for his career, tied for 43 on the all-time list 
for catchers.[96] Through July 15, Molina led the NL with a .341 (110 hits 
in 323 at-bats) batting average. In the final All-Star Game balloting, 
Molina (6,883,258 votes) edged out Posey (6,474,088) for the role of the 
NL's starting catcher in the game held at Citi Field in Queens, New York 
City.[97] The Cardinals placed Molina on the 15-day disabled list on July 
31 due to a right knee sprain.[98] At the time he went on the DL, Molina 
was batting .330 with eight homers, thirty doubles, and 54 RBI.[98] A magnetic 
resonance image (MRI) indicated inflammation but no structural damage, 
so the knee was drained of excess fluid buildup and Molina was given a 
cortisone injection.[99] The knee injury impacted his batting average, 
contributing to a late-season slump. On September 16, Molina collected 
four hits with three runs scored to help the Cardinals to a 12–2 win over 
the Seattle Mariners and break an 0–15 slump, raising his batting average 
to .317.[100] Eight days later, Molina was behind the plate to call rookie 
Michael Wacha's one-hit, 8 2⁄3 innings of shutout work in a 2–0 victory 
over the Washington Nationals. It was actually a no-hitter through that 
point until Ryan Zimmerman broke it up with a high-bouncing ground ball 
that glanced off Wacha's glove for the Nationals' only hit of the game.[101] 
For the year, Molina set new career highs in batting average (.319), doubles 
(44), runs scored (68), and RBI (80). He also hit .373 with runners in 
scoring position (RISP) in a season in which the Cardinals set the all-team 
team record for batting average with RISP at .330. He finished fourth in 
the NL in batting average, second in doubles and sixth in batting average 
with RISP. His 44 doubles were the most in the Major Leagues among catchers 
since Iván Rodríguez' 47 in 1996.[1][102][103] Molina was also noted for 
his handling of the pitching staff. The Cardinals overcame losing key pitchers 
Chris Carpenter, Jason Motte, and Jaime García – among others – early in 
the season by substituting twelve rookie pitchers en route to winning a 
competitive NL Central division title over the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati 
Reds (each team finished with at least 90 wins). A continuously evolving 
core exceeded expectations by filling in for 52 games started, 36 wins, 
and five saves and Molina was credited with their success in a large part 
due to his pitch-calling skills and aptness to guide. The rookies' 36 wins 
were the most in franchise history since 1941.[c][104][105] The Cardinals 
squared off against the Pirates in the NLDS. Two weeks removed from just 
missing a no-hitter, Wacha again nearly repeated the feat with Molina behind 
the plate in an elimination game, Game 4. Molina threw out pinch runner 
Josh Harrison attempting to steal second base in the eighth inning to help 
the Cardinals preserve a 2–1 lead.[106] In the World Series against the 
Boston Red Sox, Molina became just the ninth player – and the first in 
the expansion era – in franchise history to appear in four World Series 
with the club, and the first since Stan Musial in the 1946 World Series, 
also against the Red Sox.[107] Molina collected more awards following the 
season, including his first Silver Slugger Award,[108] sixth Gold Glove, 
and a third-place finish in MVP voting.[109] Molina was a co-winner, along 
with Wainwright and Matt Carpenter, for the BBWAA St. Louis Baseball Man 
of the Year.[37] Along with three other players each separately displayed, 
Sports Illustrated featured Molina on the cover of their March 31 issue 
complementing the 2014 MLB season preview article.[110] On the 2014 Opening 
Day – the same day Sports Illustrated published the Molina cover edition 
– he stroked his second season-entry home run and the 90th of his career, 
accounting for the difference in a 1–0 defeat of the Reds in Cincinnati. 
It also secured the 100th win for batterymate Adam Wainwright. Molina added 
a single for two of the Cardinals' five hits.[111] With a one ball, two 
strike pitch from relief pitcher Randy Choate incoming to Cubs outfielder 
Nate Schierholtz in a May 4 game, the batter foul tipped the pitch. Instead 
of Molina being in a position to catch it cleanly with his glove, the ball 
hit the thigh. Molina instantly hunched over the ball, trapping it between 
the thigh and rib cage. He held on, qualifying it as a third strike.[112] 
"Do you want another St. Louis Cardinals catcher to star in an All Star 
game? Isn’t there a better way? Cast a ballot for change. Cardinals fans 
need to know that enough is enough." With the All-Star Game nearing, Brewers 
catcher Jonathan Lucroy aired a satirical television commercial in the 
style of a political advertising campaign on June 17 to outgain Molina 
in the All-Star voting totals. The voice-over narrator posed the question, 
"Do you want another St. Louis Cardinals catcher to star in an All Star 
game? Isn’t there a better way? Cast a ballot for change. Cardinals fans 
need to know that enough is enough." At that point, Molina led the vote 
total for NL catchers with more than two million, while Posey was second 
at 1.4 million and Lucroy third with 1.1 million.[113] Some, including 
Matheny, took the message literally.[114] However, Brad Weimer, the advertisement's 
creator, confirmed the humor was meant to be tongue-in-cheek.[115] Molina 
stayed in the lead and won the vote as the starting catcher in the All-Star 
Game at Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota, his sixth consecutive appearance.[116] 
His season was interrupted on July 9 against the Pirates. While sliding 
past third base, he attempted to grab the bag to stay on. However, during 
the play, he injured his right thumb. An MRI revealed torn ligaments, requiring 
surgery and forcing him to miss the next eight to 12 weeks. Regarding the 
injury as having a significance impact on the Cardinals' season, St. Louis 
Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bernie Miklasz commented, "Losing the best catcher 
in the world for the next 8 to 12 weeks with a torn thumb ligament is a 
horrendous, demoralizing setback for the Cardinals. This could be a season-ending 
injury."[117] At that point, he was batting .287 with a .341 OBP, .409 
SLG, 16 doubles, seven homers, and 30 RBI through 83 games. He also led 
MLB with a 49 caught-stealing percentage.[118][119] He returned from the 
DL ahead of schedule, about seven weeks and 40 games missed after the injury, 
and was activated August 29 before a series against the Cubs.[120] However, 
he still had not fully recovered, as he batted .250 in September with a 
pronounced drop in power production.[121] His 110 appearances were his 
fewest since his rookie season in 2004. He finished the season with a .282 
batting average, seven HR, 38 RBI, 21 doubles, a .333 OBP and .386 SLG, 
all lower totals than 2013, and many since 2010. Among players with at 
least 90 games played, Molina's 48% caught stealing and 3.20 catcher's 
ERA were both first in the major leagues.[122] During Game 1 of the NLDS 
against the Dodgers, Wainwright hit Adrian Gonzalez with a pitch, and both 
benches cleared. Umpire Jerry Meals attempted to get between Gonzalez and 
Molina, but Molina briefly shoved Meals. MLB fined Molina $5,000 without 
suspending him.[123] In Game 2 of the NLCS against the Giants, Molina collected 
his 89th career hit in the postseason, passing Pujols for the franchise 
record. However, he sustained his second significant injury of the season 
in that same game, straining his left abdominal oblique muscle during another 
at bat,[124] due in part to compensation in his swing for lost power following 
his thumb injury earlier in the season.[121] After missing the next game, 
his string of 83 consecutive playoff games started was stopped, which was 
a major league record. The last playoff game he had not started was Game 
3 of the 2004 World Series.[125] On November 4, Molina was announced as 
winning his seventh consecutive Gold Glove, tying Boone as having won the 
third-most Gold Gloves among catchers. Further, only Bench and Rodríguez 
had won more consecutive (10 each) as catchers in major league history.[126] 
He won the National League Platinum Glove award on November 8, his third 
time in the award's first four years.[127] With his 11th consecutive Opening 
Day start on April 5, 2015, against the Cubs, Molina became the first catcher 
in club history to achieve this feat.[128] On May 10 against the Pirates, 
he was on the dubious end of a piece of MLB history: lining out into the 
first "4–5–4"[d] triple play in MLB history. Second baseman Neil Walker 
caught his line drive with two runners on, then threw to third baseman 
Jung-ho Kang to double up Jhonny Peralta for the second out. Kang briefly 
pirouetted the ball in his hand, albeit confused, but threw back to Walker 
to tag Jason Heyward for the third out.[129] Molina's first home run of 
the season and first in 95 games occurred against the Minnesota Twins on 
June 15; his previous home run dated back to June 27, 2014.[130] On July 
7, he was selected to his seventh consecutive All-Star Game, played at 
Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati.[131] In the Reds' clubhouse for 
the All-Star Game, Molina shared a locker with Reds' second baseman Brandon 
Phillips. Since the brawl between the Cardinals and Reds in 2010, the two 
mended their schism, and Molina has a photograph of their families together.[132] 
When informed whose locker he was using, Molina replied, "This is Phillips' 
locker? How about that? I'll have to write something to him."[133] While 
the pregame roster introductions were made, Reds fans booed all six Cardinals 
players who were selected, and even former Cardinal Albert Pujols. When 
Molina was introduced, he smiled and turned and pointed his thumbs toward 
the back of his jersey. Pujols provided levity when he then joined in the 
booing. After the game, Molina remarked to reporters, "when you spend 12 
years coming to Cincinnati and you beat them so many times, they’re going 
to boo you." In his career to that point, he hit .319 with a .352 on-base 
percentage and .500 slugging percentage in 270 career at-bats at Great 
American Ball Park.[134] Hitting his first triple in more than four years 
and 2,000 at bats, with the bases loaded, Molina provided the decisive 
run in a 3–2 outcome against the Chicago White Sox on July 22.[135] In 
the annual Baseball America Toolbox Awards, managers and coaches around 
the National League rated Molina as both the "Best hit and run artist" 
and "Best defensive catcher" in the NL.[136] His 100th career home run 
was well-timed, becoming the game-winning run in the bottom of the eighth 
inning at Busch Stadium on August 19 in a 4–3 win over San Francisco.[137] 
After sustaining an injury to his left thumb during a September 20 game 
against the Cubs, an MRI revealed a partial ligament tear, preventing him 
from playing.[138] Molina won his eighth consecutive Gold Glove Award[139] 
and fourth Platinum Glove Award in 2015.[140] In December, it was revealed 
that Molina had a second surgery on his left thumb, pushing his return 
to late in 2016 spring training.[141] He was winner of the Darryl Kile 
Good Guy Award.[142] At age 33, Molina broke the Cardinals' all-time games 
caught record on April 8, 2016, in his 1,440th game, passing Ted Simmons 
(1968–80). His 1,343 games started since the beginning of the 2005 season 
was the highest total in the major leagues.[143] He made his 1,500th career 
major league appearance on May 14 in a 5–3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[144] 
While playing the Washington Nationals in the seventh inning of a 2–1 loss 
at Nationals Park on May 26, Stephen Drew hit a high infield fly that stayed 
over the pitcher's mound. With both Aledmys Díaz and Mike Leake attempting 
to catch the ball, Molina posited himself and waited. As the ball deflected 
off Díaz' glove, he almost collided with Leake, but Molina instinctively 
moved his glove and caught the ball before it hit the ground.[145] He recorded 
his 1,500th career hit on July 2 against Milwaukee, becoming the 34th catcher 
in MLB history, and second for the Cardinals, after Simmons.[146] Molina's 
ninth-inning, RBI double, tied the July 27 game against the New York Mets 
at 4−4, ending Jeurys Familia’s consecutive-saves streak of 52, the third-longest 
in major league history.[147] His tenth-inning double against Milwaukee 
on August 30, his 30th of the season and 300th of his career, helped lead 
the Cardinals to a 2–1 victory.[148] He caught a career-high 146 games. 
After starting with a .256 average through 85 games, Molina batted .365 
from July 8 to the end of the season, and overall hit .307, eight home 
runs, 58 RBI,[149] and led all major league catchers with 164 hits and 
38 doubles.[150] His hit total was also a career-high, leading the club,[151] 
and he was eighth in the league in batting and ninth in doubles. Three 
World Baseball Classic (WBC) tournaments have been held – 2006, 2009 and 
2013 – and Molina has participated in all of them for the Puerto Rican 
team. He was fellow defensive standout Iván Rodríguez' understudy in 2006 
and 2009 and the primary catcher for the 2013 squad.[152] In his first 
classic in 2006, Molina played four games and collected three hits in five 
at-bats. In a 2009 tournament game against the Netherlands on March 9, 
Molina's eighth-inning double keyed a rally in which Puerto Rico won 3–1.[153] 
Speaking the next day, Molina stated that the previous night's double had 
been a bigger thrill than his two-run homer to beat the Mets in Game 7 
of the 2006 NLCS.[154] With Molina as the starting catcher in 2013, Puerto 
Rico earned the silver medal. Edwin Rodríguez, who scouted Molina in Puerto 
Rico before the Cardinals signed him, became the manager for the 2013 squad. 
Shortly after learning he would be the 2013 manager, Rodríguez contacted 
Molina for input on constructing the roster. Molina prepared for the Classic 
by playing 14 games for the winter league team in Puerto Rico Rodríguez 
managed.[10] Molina was voted on the All-World Baseball Classic Team for 
the first time.[155] In a 2013 semifinal game against Japan, Molina alertly 
took advantage of a baserunning mistake to record an unusual putout. With 
Shinnosuke Abe batting for Japan in the top of the eighth inning, and Hirokazu 
Ibata on second and Seiichi Uchikawa on first, J. C. Romero was pitching 
for Puerto Rico. Abe took a pitch from Romero inside for a ball as the 
runners went in motion. However, Ibata retreated to second as Uchikawa 
charged toward him. Instead of throwing and risking an error, Molina held 
on to the ball. He then chased Uchikawa, cornered him by positioning himself 
between first and second and tagged out Uchikawa – an unassisted caught 
stealing. The Japanese later stated they were attempting to exploit Romero's 
slow delivery.[156] The winner of eight consecutive Gold Gloves,[157] Molina 
has been widely praised for his preparation, defense and leadership, not 
just of the pitching staff, but also of the entire team. Fellow catchers 
Jorge Posada and Brian McCann stated in 2009 that Molina was "the best 
defensive catcher in baseball;" Víctor Martínez also called him "the best 
behind the plate."[5] In 2013, a scout pronounced Molina the "one piece 
the St. Louis Cardinals cannot lose" while another commented that he is 
"irreplaceable."[10] When the club did lose Molina midway through the 2014 
season to a thumb injury, ESPN's Keith Law tweeted, "Yadier Molina missing 
two-plus months would be bad for the Cardinals, but also just bad for baseball, 
period." In his time in the major leagues, Molina has been widely viewed 
as evolving into a competitive influence and an unofficial, on-field coach.[117] 
"Yadier Molina missing two-plus months would be bad for the Cardinals, 
but also just bad for baseball, period." As a part of his pre-game preparation, 
Molina meticulously studies and prepares for the upcoming game's opposing 
hitters by creating a complete pitching and defensive plan. Other preparation 
includes handling ground balls at shortstop and third base, extending his 
agility for blocking pitches thrown in the dirt.[33] According to former 
Cardinals starter Jake Westbrook, he was "a part of every aspect of the 
game: starters, relievers, offense, defense."[10][158] Advanced defensive 
metrics – known as sabermetrics – show he is a top defender among catchers 
in MLB history. Molina ranked second all-time among catchers at the end 
of the 2014 season on Baseball-Reference.com's career defensive runs saved 
(DRS)[e] with 120, behind only Iván Rodríguez (167), and ahead of Jim Sundberg 
(114), Bob Boone (107) and Gary Carter (106), the only catchers with over 
100 on the list. He was the season leader in the NL every year from 2005–14, 
except 2008 and 2011–12.[1][159] Fangraphs tallied his career DRS at 106, 
with a career-high of 20 in 2010.[160] The sabremetric stat defensive wins 
above replacement (DWAR) has also ranked Molina's defense highly; he has 
never had a full season with a negative DWAR, and he had a career-high 
2.9 DWAR in 2010.[161] "You don't ever have to worry about bouncing a ball 
to Yadier. He's a human vacuum behind the plate. The only thing you have 
to think about is making the pitch, because you know Yadi's going to catch 
whatever you throw." Molina is known for his in-game pitch-calling skills, 
and pitchers rarely reject signs that he shows for the next pitch. Matheny 
stated, "We tell all our young pitchers when they come up to pitch their 
game. Yadi needs to find out how they work. He's a quick study. But at 
the same time, they tend to just follow him. We do put them in Yadi's hands."[162] 
Molina reads opposing hitters and will move fielders with subtle signs 
and gestures to align them with his pitch calling.[10][158] La Russa commented 
that "it's not just instinct. It's sense, based on how a hitter's standing, 
how he responds to the pitch or two before, and he's very creative in how 
he makes his adjustment based on what he sees with the hitter and knowing 
what his pitcher can do."[33] "During the course of games, he would do 
something and I'd go, 'I can't believe he did that.' But it worked. His 
pitch calling, sometimes you're thinking he's doing something so out of 
the norm, yet it was the right thing to do at the time." Baseball Prospectus 
estimated in 2013 that Molina saved 35 defensive runs per season through 
his pitch framing and had moved 301 out-of-zone pitches that were called 
strikes between April 1 and June 30, 2013. As of July 2013, Molina had 
also thrown out 45% of would-be base stealers. At one time, an Arizona 
Diamondbacks official stated a team policy existed not to run on Molina.[158] 
With pickoffs, Molina throws from behind left-handed batters to obfuscate 
the runner's view of his motion to first base. Besides studying hitters 
at the plate, Molina also studies base runners to watch their decision-making 
process about stealing bases or when they are less guarded against a pickoff.[5] 
He practices pickoff moves and coordinates signals with the first basemen 
to indicate when he is primed to move for a pickoff throw.[29] In 2012, 
a Sports Illustrated poll of 306 players found that Molina was the "toughest 
catcher to run on."[164] As the publication Viva El Birdos wrote, "Yadier 
Molina broke into the majors as a light-hitting defensive specialist", 
who hit mostly singles.[165] Molina pushed to shed the light-hitter label 
he had in common with his brothers. A fidgeter with his batting stance 
early in his career, Molina mimicked and vacillated between more accomplished 
hitters such as Andrés Galarraga and Albert Pujols. However, it was a dip 
in his swing and an inability to get around on fastballs that sapped his 
efforts. Over time, with assistance of teammates such as Pujols, Molina 
found his comfortable stance, sounder mechanics and adopted a line-drive 
style of swing that eliminated the dip and helped him hit fastballs with 
more authority.[158][166] Thus, he became a more consistent hitter as his 
career progressed, defying the scouting reports that he would have a weak 
bat. In combination with an improved his ability to pull the ball and hit 
it up the middle, he improved his batting average, batting .293 or higher 
in five of his last six seasons. His line-drive pull percentage of 2009–11 
increased by about 6% in 2012–13; BABIP increased from .280 in 2005–10 
to .327 in 2011–13 and pull weighted on-base average (wOBA)[f] has increased 
from .290 in 2009 to over .520 in 2013.[158][166] To keep his bat in the 
lineup but allow respite from the rigors of his in-game catching duties, 
Molina has occasionally started at first base. Aside from swinging with 
increased line-drive contact and hitting fastballs with more authority, 
very little has actually changed in the catcher's approach.[166] One trait 
that has always persisted is that Molina is an aggressive and free-swinging 
– but high-contact – hitter. Through 2012, he swung at more than 51% percent 
of the pitches he saw – he has a reputation for swinging at pitches in 
and out of the strike zone, low and away and even in toward his hands.[165] 
Because of his free-swinging tendency, he naturally has a walk rate (7.1%) 
below the Major League average (8.4%).[28] Combined with his ability to 
put the bat on the ball quite frequently (87%) and his improved approach 
at the plate, he increased his career-high single-season batting average 
five times between 2006 and 2013.[1] Despite batting just .238 in his first 
three seasons and .240 after 1,000 at-bats, Molina increased his average 
to .284 average after 3,983 at-bats (1,132 hits) as of 2013 due in part 
to having only one season lower than .293 from 2009–13. He hit into 27 
double plays in 2009, but in 2012 reduced that figure to ten.[167] Molina's 
home run and doubles rates also increased; from 2011–13, he hit 104 of 
his 226 career doubles.[1] Note: Per Baseball-Reference.com Bold: league 
leader Molina lives in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, and stays in Caseyville, 
Illinois, during the baseball season.[177] He married his wife Wanda Torres 
in 2007. On September 4, 2008, he had a son named Yanuell, on July 4, 2010, 
a daughter named Arianna, and on February 6, 2016, a son named Daniel Benjamin.[178] 
After signing his $75 million contract in 2012, Molina purchased a home 
on a four-acre property located in Jupiter, Florida for $7.15 million.[179] 
His agent is Melvin Roman of MDR Sports Management, who has represented 
him since he signed his first professional contract with the Cardinals 
shortly after being drafted in 2000.[180][181] Molina's charitable organization, 
named Foundation 4, has helped to raise donations for childhood cancer 
patients in Puerto Rico.[37] Molina's two older brothers, Bengie and José 
Molina, have played a combined 28 seasons in the Major Leagues. Each of 
the three brothers has won at least one World Series ring, making them 
the only trio of brothers with such a distinction (Bengie and José both 
won their first while with the Anaheim Angels in 2002). They are also the 
only trio of brothers to play as catchers in the major leagues.[3] Of a
