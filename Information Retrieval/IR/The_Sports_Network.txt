The Sports Network (TSN) is a Canadian English language sports specialty 
service. Established by the Labatt Brewing Company in 1984 as part of the 
first group of Canadian specialty cable channels, the idea coming from 
a 12 year old Sean Skoreyko,[1] since 2001, TSN has been majority-owned 
by communications conglomerate Bell Canada (presently through its broadcasting 
subsidiary Bell Media) with a minority stake held by ESPN Inc. via a 20% 
share in the Bell Media subsidiary CTV Specialty Television. TSN is the 
largest specialty channel in Canada in terms of gross revenue, with a total 
of $400.4 million in revenue in 2013.[2] TSN's networks focus on sports-related 
programming, including live and recorded event telecasts, sports talk shows, 
and other original programming. TSN was the first, and most recent national 
cable broadcaster of the National Hockey League in Canada—its stint has 
been interrupted twice by rival network Sportsnet—most recently as of the 
2014-15 season under an exclusive 12-year rights deal. TSN holds regional 
television rights to three of the NHL's seven Canadian franchises. As of 
2015, major programming rights held by TSN include exclusive coverage of 
the Canadian Football League and Curling Canada's national championships, 
coverage of the NBA and the Toronto Raptors, coverage of Major League Soccer 
and exclusive rights to Vancouver Whitecaps FC, along with Canadian rights 
to the tournaments of FIFA (soccer) and the IIHF (ice hockey), the NFL 
(shared with sister network CTV), Formula One, NASCAR, the Premier League 
(split with Sportsnet), the UEFA Champions League, Ultimate Fighting Championship, 
and the Grand Slam tennis tournaments, among others. TSN also receives 
a large amount of programming through its minority partner, ESPN. The TSN 
license currently comprises five 24-hour programming services; from its 
launch until 2006, TSN operated as a single, national service. In 2006, 
the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) 
ruled that TSN could operate multiple feeds with a limited amount of alternative 
national programming—this was followed by the launch of TSN2—a second 24-hour 
network under the TSN license that was legally considered a west coast 
feed of TSN. As of 2010, TSN has been subject to deregulated Category C 
licensing by the CRTC, which allows multiple feeds to be operated under 
the TSN license with no restrictions on alternate programming; TSN used 
this new ability to operate an autonomous TSN2, along with part-time feeds 
for regional NHL coverage. On August 25, 2014, the primary TSN service 
was re-structured into four 24-hour feeds—TSN1, TSN3, TSN4, and TSN5—with 
each designated as the primary TSN network for each region of Canada. TSN 
now essentially operates as a group of regional sports networks similarly 
to Sportsnet, alongside the national TSN2; the four channels air some common 
programming and simulcast major events, but are capable of airing programming 
autonomously—including alternative national events and studio shows, supplemental 
coverage of larger events, and regional programming (such as NHL games; 
subject to blackout outside of the respective team's market).[2][3] Licensed 
by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) 
on April 2, 1984, as Action Canada Sports Network,[4] the channel was launched 
by the Labatt Brewing Company on September 1 of the same year as The Sports 
Network, or TSN. The network was founded under the leadership of Gordon 
Craig, a former employee of CBC Sports; alongside coverage of the co-owned[4] 
Toronto Blue Jays, TSN also reached a deal with ESPN (itself only 5 years 
old) shortly before launch to provide additional programs. Although reaching 
around 400,000 subscribers, TSN's early years were hindered by its initial 
status as a premium service, bundled in a high-cost package with movie 
channels such as First Choice and Superchannel, alongside competition with 
free-to-air sports broadcasts by CBC Television among others.[5] To improve 
the prominence of the network, TSN sought to obtain the national cable 
rights to the National Hockey League—rights that, according to the league, 
were not sold under the current arrangement with CBC. However, the task 
was complicated by claims by CBC that it owned the cable rights to the 
NHL, along with the involvement of competing beer company Molson in Canadian 
NHL rights at the time. With the help of a Molson employee who was a friend 
of Gordon, a deal was reached between TSN, Molson, and the NHL to allow 
the network to broadcast games on cable.[5] By December 1987, TSN had reached 
one million subscribers, but the network's staff sought wider distribution 
for the channel as part of basic cable service; the CRTC approved the network's 
request for permission to allow TSN to be carried as part of a basic cable 
lineup. Mike Day, producer of TSN's daily sports news program SportsDesk 
lamented about the shift to basic cable and the larger audience it would 
bring, commenting that "one night you're doing a news show that potentially 
has an audience of one million people, and the next day the potential is 
five million people."[5][6] In 1991, TSN acquired rights to the IIHF World 
U20 Championship, otherwise known as the "World Juniors", which were previously 
broadcast by CBC. TSN's coverage, along with the recent "Punch-up in Piestany" 
incident and a strong performance by Canada at the tournament in the mid-1990s, 
helped to significantly heighten the profile of the tournament in the country 
(even more so than in other participating countries), to the point that 
it is, alongside U.S. college football bowl games, regarded as a traditional 
sporting event of the holiday season in Canada.[7] Due to CRTC regulations 
on the foreign ownership of broadcasters, Labatt was forced to sell TSN 
and RDS upon its acquisition by Interbrew in 1995. Labatt's broadcasting 
assets were sold to a privately held consortium named NetStar Communications, 
the investors of which included a number of Canadian firms as well as ESPN 
Inc., which held an interest of about 30%. The Sports Network launched 
its website TSN.ca on October 1, 1995.[8] In 1997, the CRTC began permitting 
TSN to offer an "alternate feed", which could be used to provide a regional 
opt-out of the main TSN service for programming that must be blacked out 
in the rest of the country. Alternate programming could make up a maximum 
of 10% of the TSN schedule—an average of 2.4 hours a day.[9] In 2000, after 
ESPN blocked two attempts by the Canadian partners to sell NetStar to Canwest, 
CTV Inc. acquired the Canadian partners' shares. CTV Inc. was acquired 
by Bell Canada and The Woodbridge Company (publisher of The Globe and Mail 
newspaper) as part of the joint venture Bell Globemedia in 2001. As a result 
of its purchase of TSN, CTV would be forced to sell its regional sports 
network CTV Sportsnet, eventually selling it to minority shareholder Rogers 
Media. Following the acquisition, TSN would move its operations to CTV's 
Agincourt complex. However, Sportsnet would not move from Agincourt until 
2008 (when it moved to the Rogers Building in Downtown Toronto), which 
led to the now-competing networks sharing the same building as their headquarters. 
This oddity would become an inside joke between personalities on both networks, 
who commonly referred to jumping between the two networks as "crossing 
the parking lot."[10] Following the sale, TSN began to closer align its 
on-air imaging with that of ESPN; the most prominent effect of these changes 
came with the re-branding of TSN's flagship sports news program SportsDesk 
as SportsCentre—a Canadian version (in both format and spelling) of ESPN's 
SportsCenter.[5] TSN also launched a number of digital specialty channels 
in 2001; including a local version of ESPN Classic, the NHL Network— a 
network devoted to ice hockey and the National Hockey League, and WTSN—a 
channel dedicated to women's sports[11] On August 15, 2003, TSN became 
one of the first two specialty television services in Canada (the other 
being fellow Bell property Discovery Channel) to be available in high definition.[12] 
TSN's first live HD broadcast was of a Canadian Football League game between 
the Montreal Alouettes and Hamilton Tiger-Cats—it was to occur on the same 
day, but was delayed to August 16 due to a major blackout which occurred 
the day prior.[5] Beginning in 2006, the CRTC officially allowed TSN to 
operate national secondary digital feeds with limited amounts of alternative 
programming.[13] Following this development, TSN began to use such a feed 
to broadcast additional programming that could not be aired on TSN due 
to scheduling conflicts or other events. On August 29, 2008, the feed evolved 
into a new 24-hour channel, similar to ESPN2, known as TSN2.[14] Upon its 
launch, TSN2 was legally considered a west coast timeshift feed of TSN,[15] 
although soon after TSN2 was launched, the CRTC announced a proposal to 
remove genre exclusivity protections for "mainstream sports" and "national 
news" channels in the near future. As a byproduct of the decision, TSN 
would be allowed to use streamlined conditions of licence (legally referred 
to as a Category C license as of September 2011),[16] which state that 
the service may offer "multiple feeds", without any restrictions on alternate 
programming.[17] TSN was officially permitted to use these streamlined 
conditions of licence on February 1, 2010.[18] On September 10, 2010, Bell 
Canada announced plans to re-acquire 100% of CTVglobemedia's broadcasting 
arm, including its majority control of TSN. Under the deal, Woodbridge 
Company Limited, Torstar, and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan would 
together receive $1.3 billion in either cash or equity in BCE, while BCE 
would also assume $1.7 billion in debt (BCE's existing equity interest 
is $200 million, for a total transaction value of $3.2 billion). Woodbridge 
has since simultaneously regained majority control of The Globe and Mail, 
with Bell retaining a 15% interest in December 2010. The deal closed on 
April 1, 2011, after the CRTC approved the sale on March 7, 2011 – the 
new company became known as Bell Media.[19] After a longstanding speculation 
about TSN's interest in launching its own TSN-branded radio network (similarly 
to its U.S. counterpart), TSN entered radio broadcasting with the launch 
of the first TSN Radio station, a relaunch of AM station CHUM in Toronto 
on April 13, 2011.[20] Bell Media's Bell Media Radio division already operated 
several sports radio stations elsewhere in Canada (most of which were branded 
as The Team, a name introduced by previous owner CHUM Limited in its own 
failed attempt at establishing a national sports radio network), it was 
reported that Bell could theoretically relaunch these other stations under 
the TSN Radio brand in the future.[21] Also in 2011, TSN acquired broadcast 
rights to the returning Winnipeg Jets. TSN would establish another part-time 
feed, TSN Jets, to broadcast the games. Additionally, co-owned CFRW would 
also gain radio rights to the new Jets.[22] CFRW, along with Montreal station 
CKGM, also migrated to the TSN Radio brand on October 5, 2011.[23] Additionally, 
Bell would also launch TSN Mobile TV, streaming versions of TSN and TSN2 
offered through Bell Mobility's Mobile TV services.[24] On December 9, 
2011, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan announced that it would sell its 
majority stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment to two major telecommunications 
companies; Bell Canada (TSN's main parent company) and Rogers Communications 
(owners of the competing Sportsnet chain of sports channels) with a 37.5% 
share each (Larry Tanenbaum increased his ownership to a quarter of the 
company as well), in a deal expected to be valued at around $1.32 billion 
in total.[25] The deal was completed in summer 2012, following the approval 
of Canada's Competition Bureau, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications 
Commission (with regards to MLSE's television channels), as well as the 
leagues for each of MLSE's main sports franchises. The deal was expected 
to have a major impact on future broadcast rights for MLSE's teams, including 
the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors, as their ownership of the 
teams will offer enhanced coverage for the team through new platforms such 
as mobile television.[24] In March 2014, TSN launched its TV Everywhere 
service TSN Go, allowing subscribers to TSN on participating service providers 
to stream TSN networks online or through a mobile app. On launch, TSN Go 
was available exclusively to Bell TV and Rogers Cable subscribers.[26] 
It has since been expanded to other providers, such as Shaw.[27] Following 
the announcement of Bell and Rogers' acquisition of MLSE, concerns were 
again raised by critics, speculating that Bell Media could attempt to acquire 
full rights to the NHL after CBC's current contract with the league expires 
in the 2013–14 season – using their ownership of the Toronto Maple Leafs, 
the NHL's highest valued franchise, as an impetus for such a coup. Concerns 
were also raised that such an arrangement could prevent wireless service 
providers other than Bell and Rogers from accessing its content; the CRTC 
had ruled in favour of Telus in a decision requiring Bell and other media 
companies to allow other competing wireless providers access to its content, 
and not exclusively tie it to their own service (as they had attempted 
to do with TSN Mobile TV).[24] However, in November 2013, Rogers Communications 
announced that it had reached a 12-year deal to become the sole national 
television rightsholder of the NHL, beginning in the 2014-15 season.[28] 
Critics considered Rogers' move to be a major blow against Bell and TSN, 
showing concerns for how the network could sustain itself without what 
is considered a key property in Canadian sports broadcasting. However, 
they also acknowledged the network's continuing rights to IIHF hockey tournaments 
(including the popular World Junior Hockey Championships), the Canadian 
Football League (who renewed their contract with TSN without allowing any 
outside bidders in 2013 and whose current contract lasts through 2018), 
and TSN's growing regional NHL rights portfolio, including the Maple Leafs—which 
would, beginning in the same season, air 26 games on TSN per season.[29] 
In a series of Twitter posts by TSN personality Bob McKenzie, he explained 
that even with the loss of national NHL rights, TSN's goal was to remain 
"THE source for all things hockey" through its analysis programs and regional 
coverage, and that this was not the first time that TSN had lost its cable 
rights to the NHL (having lost them to CTV Sportsnet for a period upon 
its launch in 1998).[28][30][31] On May 6, 2014, TSN announced that it 
would launch three new channels—TSN3, TSN4, and TSN5, in September 2014 
to coincide with the network's 30th anniversary. TSN president Stewart 
Johnston described the expansion as an "important evolution" for the network, 
as it would allow TSN to make more efficient use of its portfolio of sports 
properties: the network promoted that these new channels would allow TSN 
to broadcast a larger amount of ESPN content and live events, particularly 
including expanded coverage of major events (such as Grand Slam tennis, 
curling tournaments, and the NCAA basketball tournament) with multiple 
games occurring simultaneously. Although the expansion was discussed by 
TSN staff as early as 2012, critics considered the loss of NHL rights to 
Rogers (which had recently launched its seventh Sportsnet-branded television 
service with its acquisition of The Score, now Sportsnet 360) to be a catalyst 
for the move, as TSN attempts to defend its position as the largest specialty 
television service in Canada in terms of total revenue.[2][32] The launch 
date of these new channels were pushed up to August 25, 2014, in order 
to allow multi-court coverage of the 2014 US Open tennis tournament, which 
began the same day.[33] TSN also announced that it would use these new 
channels to house regional NHL games beginning in the 2014-15 season, featuring 
the Jets, Maple Leafs, and Ottawa Senators.[29] On January 13, 2016, TSN 
announced that it would present its first telecast in 4K ultra high-definition—a 
Toronto Raptors basketball game—on January 20, 2016. It will be followed 
by a slate of regional NHL games and other Raptors games in the format.[34] 
As is permitted for all Category C sports services, the TSN licence is 
permitted to have multiple channels, and currently encompasses all of the 
channels listed in the table below. However, unlike premium services like 
The Movie Network, subscribers receiving one TSN channel are not necessarily 
automatically entitled to receive all additional channels, and in many 
cases they are (or previously were) only available by paying a separate 
charge to a service provider. For example, until 2013, Rogers Cable customers 
were required to subscribe to the HD Specialty Pack add-on in order to 
receive TSN HD (whereas most other HD simulcast channels were provided 
at no additional charge). On many providers including Rogers, TSN1, 3, 
4 and 5 are included in a single package, but TSN2 is still provided only 
as part of a separate higher-tier package.[35] On May 6, 2014, TSN announced 
plans to launch three additional multiplex channels, for a total of five 
24-hour national channels. The existing "TSN" service was replaced by four 
regionally-focused channels (referred to as "feeds")—TSN1, 3, 4, and 5—similar 
to the Sportsnet regional channels. All five channels are available nationally, 
but on most local providers, the channel location previously occupied by 
TSN's primary service was filled by the appropriate regional feed. While 
major sports telecasts are simulcast across TSN1, 3, 4, and 5 to ensure 
national coverage, alternative studio shows and live events can also be 
split across the channels.[2][3] The feeds carry a small amount of programming 
tailored towards their respective regions, including simulcasts of lunch-hour 
shows from TSN Radio stations in their relevant region, and regional NHL 
coverage.[2][3][36] When TV listings and promotions make a reference to 
a program airing on "the TSN network" or simply "TSN" without disambiguation, 
it can normally be assumed that the program will be simulcast on TSN1, 
3, 4 and 5.[37] Their launch date was originally announced as September 
1, 2014, to coincide with the 30th anniversary of TSN's launch,[2][3] but 
was moved up to August 25 in order to accommodate multiple-court coverage 
throughout the 2014 US Open.[33] Prior to the launch of the additional 
feeds, Bell executives stated that the expanded five-channel service would 
be offered for the same rate as was charged at the time for TSN and TSN2 
together.[32] Notwithstanding this claim, some providers, including Shaw 
Cable, have elected to charge extra for some of the new feeds.[38] Most 
major Canadian television providers carried the new channels upon their 
launch, including Bell, Cogeco, Eastlink, MTS, SaskTel, Shaw, Source Cable, 
Rogers, and Telus.[33][39] Videotron, a cable provider which primarily 
serves the province of Quebec, was a notable hold-out for the new feeds. 
On October 13, a Monday Night Football game was left unavailable in English 
(due to a rained out MLB playoff game, RDS2 was able to carry the game 
in French) to Videotron subscribers because TSN5—the only feed it carried—was 
airing a regional Ottawa Senators/Florida Panthers NHL game (a game which 
also attracted infamy for having the lowest attendance of any Panthers 
game in team history).[40] On October 16, 2015, Videotron president Manon 
Brouillette responded to complaints by subscribers surrounding the incident, 
and confirmed that it had reached a deal in September to carry the new 
feeds; the addition of TSN1 to the lineup was accelerated to October 20, 
2014, to ensure the availability of that week's Monday Night Football game, 
with the remainder added on October 29, 2014.[41] The current TSN feeds, 
and any programming unique to each feed as per TSN's current TV schedules 
(subject to pre-emption by either ESPN or TSN due to live events), is shown 
below. On August 15, 2003, TSN launched a high definition simulcast, branded 
as TSN HD, airing widescreen and high-definition feeds of programming when 
available. As virtually TSN's entire schedule is now broadcast in HD, the 
separate branding was dropped from on-air usage in 2013, and the HD feed 
is now letterboxed for standard definition viewers. All of the other TSN 
channels below have had HD simulcasts available since their respective 
launch dates. The other sports channels owned or managed by Bell Media 
and ESPN Inc., including ESPN Classic, NHL Network, and the French-language 
Réseau des sports and related channels, operate under separate licences. 
TSN's flagship news program is SportsCentre, a sports news program airing 
several times throughout the day. Formerly known as Sportsdesk, it was 
revamped to closer resemble ESPN's own SportsCenter (including the use 
of its theme music, logo, and opening) in the Fall of 2001 as part of a 
corporate restructuring, closer aligning itself with minority owner ESPN. 
In 2006, a new studio was built in order to prepare the show for its transition 
to high definition – becoming the first daily news program in Canada to 
be produced in HD beginning on September 25, 2006. Other original programs 
on TSN include the daily hockey news program That's Hockey, the talk show 
Off the Record with Michael Landsberg, the automotive newsmagazine Motoring, 
and TSN The Reporters. In connection with ESPN's minority ownership in 
TSN, the network has a long-term agreement with ESPN International for 
the Canadian rights to ESPN original and studio programs, including Pardon 
the Interruption, Around the Horn, Sunday NFL Countdown, NFL Live, Baseball 
Tonight, ESPN FC, and ESPN Films documentaries including the 30 for 30 
series, among others, though it does not always air these programs simultaneously 
with their U.S. broadcasts.[51] TSN is a major broadcaster of ice hockey 
in Canada. From 1987 to 1998, and again from 2002 to 2014, TSN held national 
cable rights to broadcast the NHL in Canada. Under its most recent contract, 
TSN aired regular season games on weeknights and Sundays, including exclusivity 
on Wednesday nights, as well as various Stanley Cup Playoffs games, as 
the league's secondary rightsholder after CBC Sports. Its most recent contract 
expired at the end of the 2013–14 NHL season (following the 2014 NHL Draft); 
Rogers Communications (owners of Sportsnet) secured a twelve-year contract 
for sole national rights beginning with the following season.[28][52][53] 
TSN's then-parent company CTVglobemedia attempted to strike a similar exclusive 
deal in 2006 ($1.4 billion over ten years), but was not successful.[54][55] 
CTV acquired the rights to The Hockey Theme, which has been the theme song 
of Hockey Night in Canada for 40 years, after the CBC decided not to renew 
its rights to the theme song in June 2008 amid a legal dispute with its 
composer, Dolores Claman. A reorchestrated version of the tune has been 
used for hockey broadcasts on TSN and RDS since fall 2008.[56] TSN continues 
to hold three regional, English-language rights contracts: These games 
are subject to blackout outside of the teams' designated home markets.[29] 
TSN also held regional English-language rights to the Montreal Canadiens 
(separate from the French-language contract held by sister channel RDS) 
through the 2013–14 season; they have since been acquired by Sportsnet.[47] 
TSN also has a broadcasting contract with Hockey Canada, giving it the 
rights to broadcast the IIHF World Junior Championships, Men's and Women's 
World Hockey Championship, the IIHF World U18 Championship, Allan Cup, 
Royal Bank Cup, Spengler Cup, Telus Cup and Esso Cup. In the 2014-15 season, 
TSN began to broadcast a package of NCAA Division I college hockey games, 
including regular season games, and the Frozen Four.[60] Since the 2008 
season, TSN has been the exclusive broadcaster of the Canadian Football 
League, airing all of the league's games, including the season-ending Grey 
Cup.[61] TSN broadcasts Canada's major curling tournaments; it holds exclusive 
rights to Curling Canada's Season of Champions series through 2020 (which 
include Canada's men's and women's national championships, the Scotties 
Tournament of Hearts and Tim Horton's Brier, along with the World Curling 
Championships).[62] It also organizes the Pinty's All-Star Curling Skins 
Game, an annual skins curling tournament. TSN also broadcasts Toronto Raptors 
games produced by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, which included 47 
games across TSN and TSN2 in the 2010–11 season.[63][needs update] TSN 
acquired Canadian rights to Major League Soccer in 2011, airing 24 matches 
during the 2011 season that involved the league's Canadian clubs, Toronto 
FC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Its slate expanded to 30 games in 2012 with 
the debut of the Montreal Impact in the league. TSN's channels broadcast 
a package of other regular-season games, the MLS All-Star Game, MLS Cup 
Playoffs and the MLS Cup.[64] In January 2014, TSN announced that it would 
take over broadcast rights to Whitecaps games beginning in the 2014 Major 
League Soccer season, under a separate deal.[65] On October 27, 2011, Bell 
Media and TSN announced that they had secured broadcast rights for FIFA 
soccer tournaments from 2015 to 2022. The rights include the 2018 FIFA 
World Cup, 2022 FIFA World Cup, and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup hosted 
by Canada.[66] TSN has hosted much of Canada's supplementary Olympic coverage, 
being the first pay television channel in the world to ever broadcast the 
Olympics with the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, and having been part 
of the CBC's coverage from 1998 to 2008. In 2010, TSN began to participate 
in CTV and Rogers' joint broadcast rights to the Olympic Games for 2010 
and 2012. TSN continued to be a part of CBC's coverage of the 2014 Winter 
Olympics, but also in conjunction with Sportsnet (who participated in the 
CTV/Rogers coverage).[67] The channel also previously held rights to the 
country's university football playoff tournaments, including the Hardy 
Cup, Uteck Bowl, Mitchell Bowl and the Vanier Cup championship.[68] The 
Hardy Cup coverage reverted to Shaw TV in 2014 while the Uteck, Mitchell 
and Vanier contests moved to Sportsnet, who acquired exclusive rights to 
CIS tournaments in May 2013.[69] TSN has also historically been a broadcaster 
for Major League Baseball in Canada, as its former parent company, Labatt, 
was also the owner of the Toronto Blue Jays. Under Rogers ownership, TSN 
continued to sub-license a package 25 of Blue Jays games per-season, with 
the rest of the games televised by the co-owned Sportsnet, who is also 
the primary rightsholder of Major League Baseball in Canada. In 2010, TSN 
traded its Blue Jays games to Sportsnet for rights to ESPN Sunday Night 
Baseball.[70] In 2014, TSN reached a deal directly with MLB International 
for Canadian rights to all of ESPN's MLB coverage, adding Monday Night 
Baseball and Wednesday Night Baseball beginning in the 2014 season.[71][72][73] 
In May 2011, Bell Media and Skate Canada announced a 10-year rights agreement 
making CTV, TSN and RDS the official broadcasters of Skate Canada. As part 
of the agreement, CTV, TSN and RDS acquired exclusive multimedia rights 
to all of Skate Canada’s premier domestic events including Skate Canada 
International and the Canadian Figure Skating Championships. Since 2011, 
TSN has carried the Rugby World Cup, also with live and tape-delayed coverage. 
Along with its coverage of Canadian events, TSN also airs coverage of international 
sporting events (primarily American), often simulcast from other broadcasters. 
TSN also currently airs Formula One and NASCAR racing events (as of the 
2016 season, coverage of F1 events is supplied from Sky Sports). [74] TSN2 
carries a weekly early NFL game (to compliment sister terrestrial network 
CTV's other regional games), NBC Sunday Night Football and Monday Night 
Football. TSN also carries some of ESPN's NFL analysis and highlight programs, 
including NFL Live, Sunday NFL Countdown, and Monday Night Countdown. In 
December 2013, Bell Media and the NFL agreed on a multi-year extension 
of their broadcast partnership which will see more NFL games on TSN, including 
the Sunday 1pm and 4pm et regular season games.[75] TSN also currently 
serves as the main Canadian outlet for TNT's NBA coverage, along with exclusive 
Canadian rights to the NBA Finals. TSN is the exclusive rights holder in 
Canada for all four Tennis Grand Slams; in 2012, the channel signed multi-year 
extensions for the Australian Open,[76] French Open[77] and Wimbledon.,[78] 
followed by the US Open the following year.[79] In 2016, TSN also re-gained 
rights to the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and ATP World Tour 500 series, 
excluding the Canadian Open due to exclusive media and sponsorship rights 
held by Rogers Media.[80] TSN is also the rights holder for all four of 
golf's major championships – The Masters (first two rounds, and late-round 
coverage on CTV beginning 2016)[81][82] , US Open, British Open and PGA 
Championship. In addition, it carries the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup 
and simulcasts the RBC Canadian Open.[83] On February 1, 2011, TSN announced 
that they had acquired the rights to the Tour de France in a "multi-year" 
deal.[84] This deal ultimately lasted for three years; the rights were 
acquired by Sportsnet in 2014. In 2011, as part of a larger deal with ESPN 
International, TSN acquired rights to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball 
Championship.[85] In the 2013-14 season, TSN began to air more regular 
season games, with a particular focus on the Kansas Jayhawks due to their 
addition of Thornhill, Ontario native Andrew Wiggins.[86] As of the 2013-14 
season, TSN jointly holds Canadian rights to the Premier League with Sportsnet 
through 2016.[87] In August 2009, TSN and TSN2 began airing live and delayed 
coverage of Australian Rules Football. Selected games from the Australian 
Football League (AFL) Premiership Season and Finals Series including the 
AFL Grand Final are broadcast live or on delay every weekend.[88][89] On 
December 19, 2014, Bell Media announced that it had acquired rights to 
the UEFA Champions League and Europa League for TSN and RDS beginning in 
2015, in conjunction with beIN Sports.[90] On December 22, 2014, it was 
also announced that TSN had also acquired Canadian rights to UFC mixed 
martial arts, beginning in 2015. TSN's networks air all major events, including 
PPV preliminaries, domestic UFC Fight Night events, and The Ultimate Fighter. 
TSN also sub-licensed portions of its rights to fighting sports-oriented 
specialty channel Fight Network, which airs international Fight Night events 
and preliminaries for non-PPV events. The contract also includes French-language 
rights for RDS. Rights to both in Canada were previously held by Sportsnet.[91][92] 
Through minority owner ESPN, TSN also holds exclusive Canadian broadcast 
rights to several other events which ESPN either owns outright, such as 
the X Games, or for which it owns the worldwide broadcast rights, such 
as the College Football Playoff, and the World Series of Poker.[51] TSN 
featured live professional wrestling in the form of World Wrestling Entertainment's 
flagship show, WWE Raw for over a decade. However, the Raw program, which 
aired live, occasionally had been censored live for extremely violent scenes, 
or when female wrestlers or characters were assaulted by male wrestlers. 
These actions are supposed to be in order to meet Canadian broadcast standards, 
with repeat broadcasts often more heavily edited. This disappointed many 
wrestling fans over the years, and is unusual since the violence of wrestling 
scenes are not significantly different from other television programs aired 
on regular Canadian networks.[93][94] (WWE has since toned down the level 
of violence and sexuality on its programming to meet standards for the 
U.S. TV-PG rating.) It was expected that in fall 2006, when TSN started 
airing the ESPN iteration of Monday Night Football (as well as the NBC 
Sunday Night Football games), that WWE Raw would air on tape delay during 
the NFL season. However, WWE instead decided to move the program to rival 
sports network The Score (now known as Sportsnet 360) rather than air on 
tape delay, although Raw was still aired on a 15-minute delay due to limits 
on the amount of live programming that channel could air in a week. As 
of Raw 1000 in 2012, the program is aired without a tape delay. The final 
episode of WWE Raw on TSN aired July 31, 2006; the 2007 WWE Hall of Fame 
induction ceremony was also aired on the network, but no other professional 
wrestling programming is known to have aired on the channel since then 
(though TSN's sister network E! Canada does air the WWE reality show Total 
Divas). Off The Record with Michael Landsberg continues to occasionally 
feature professional wrestlers in unscripted interviews, which it has throughout 
its run. In 2004, both TSN and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA Wrestling), 
(known then as NWA-TNA), erroneously announced that Impact! would air on 
the network, although that deal was never completed and the article on 
the TSN Wrestling page was taken down shortly after. However, TSN's French-language 
sister network RDS airs the program. In past years, TSN also aired shows 
from the American Wrestling Association (AWA), Stampede Wrestling and World 
Championship Wrestling (WCW) Monday Nitro, as well as producing a one-hour 
show called Pro Wrestling Plus, which featured highlights from various 
promotions and was hosted by Stampede announcer Ed Whalen; that program 
was the Canadian equivalent of the syndicated American program Pro Wrestling
