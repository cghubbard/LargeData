The Detroit Red Wings are a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit, 
Michigan. They are members of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference 
of the National Hockey League (NHL)[1] and are one of the Original Six 
teams of the league.[2] Founded in 1926, the team was known as the Detroit 
Cougars from then until 1930. For the 1930–31 and 1931–32 seasons the team 
was called the Detroit Falcons, and in 1932 changed their name to the Red 
Wings.[3] As of 2016[update], the Red Wings have won the most Stanley Cup 
championships (11)[4] of any NHL franchise based in the United States, 
and are third overall in total NHL championships, behind the Montreal Canadiens 
(24) and Toronto Maple Leafs (13). The Wings have played their home games 
at Joe Louis Arena since 1979, after having spent over 40 years playing 
in Olympia Stadium, and are scheduled to move into Little Caesars Arena 
for the start of the 2017-18 season. The Red Wings are one of the most 
popular franchises in the NHL, and fans and commentators refer to Detroit 
and its surrounding areas as "Hockeytown," which has been a registered 
trademark owned by the franchise since 1996.[5] Between the 1933–34 and 
1965–66 seasons, the Red Wings missed the playoffs only four times. Between 
the 1966–67 and 1990–91 seasons, the Red Wings made the playoffs only eight 
times in 25 seasons. During the last 11 years of this stretch, only five 
of the League's 21 teams did not make the post-season, yet the Wings still 
managed to miss the playoffs five times. This rough period for the team 
provoked the nickname of the "Dead Wings." Near the end of that 25-year 
period, however, the Red Wings advanced to the Conference Finals twice. 
Since then, the Red Wings have been one of the most successful NHL teams 
in the last quarter century, with six regular season first-place finishes, 
and winning the Stanley Cup four times in six Finals appearances. They 
have made the playoffs in 29 of the last 31 seasons; their playoff streak 
currently stands at 25 in a row (1991–2016),[6] which is the longest current 
streak of post-season appearances in all of North American professional 
sports. Following the 1926 Stanley Cup playoffs, during which the Western 
Hockey League was widely reported to be on the verge of folding,[7] the 
NHL held a meeting on April 17 to consider applications for expansion franchises, 
at which it was reported that five different groups sought a team for Detroit.[8] 
During a subsequent meeting on May 15, the league approved a franchise 
to the Townsend-Seyburn group of Detroit and named Charles A. Hughes as 
governor.[9] Frank and Lester Patrick, the owners of the WHL, made a deal 
to sell the league's players to the NHL and cease league operations. The 
new Detroit franchise purchased the players of the folded Victoria Cougars 
(Winner of the 1925 Stanley Cup) WHL club to play for the team. The new 
Detroit franchise also adopted the Cougars' nickname in honor of the folded 
franchise.[10] Since no arena in Detroit was ready at the time, the Cougars 
played their first season in Windsor, Ontario at the Border Cities Arena.[11] 
For the 1927–28 season, the Cougars moved into the new Detroit Olympia, 
which would be their home rink until December 27, 1979. This was also the 
first season behind the bench for Jack Adams, who would be the face of 
the franchise the next 36 years as either coach or general manager. The 
Cougars made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in 1929 with Carson 
Cooper leading the team in scoring. The Cougars were outscored 7–2 in the 
two-game series with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 1930, the Cougars were 
renamed the Falcons,[12] but their woes continued, as they usually finished 
near the bottom of the standings, even though they made the playoffs again 
in 1932. In 1932, the NHL let grain merchant James E. Norris, who had made 
two previous unsuccessful bids to buy an NHL team, purchase the Falcons. 
Norris' first act was to choose a new name for the team—the Red Wings. 
Earlier in the century, Norris had been a member of the Montreal Amateur 
Athletic Association, a sporting club with cycling roots. The MAAA's teams 
were known by their club emblem and these Winged Wheelers were the first 
winners of the Stanley Cup in 1893. Norris decided that a version of their 
logo was perfect for a team playing in the Motor City and on October 5, 
1932 the club was renamed the Red Wings.[13] Norris also placed coach Jack 
Adams on a one-year probation for the 1932–33 NHL season. Adams managed 
to pass his probationary period by leading the renamed franchise to first 
ever playoff series victory over the Montreal Maroons. Despite this success, 
the team lost in the semi-finals to the New York Rangers.[14] In 1934 the 
Wings made the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time, with John Sorrell 
scoring 21 goals over 47 games and Larry Aurie leading the team in scoring. 
However, the Chicago Black Hawks defeated Detroit in the finals, winning 
the best-of-five series in four games and winning their own first title. 
The Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 1936, defeating Toronto in 
four games. Detroit repeated as Stanley Cup champions in 1937, winning 
over the Rangers in the full five games.[15] In 1938, the Wings and the 
Montreal Canadiens became the first NHL teams to play in Europe, playing 
in Paris and London. The Wings played nine games against the Canadiens 
and went 3-5-1; they did not play in Europe again until the preseason and 
start of the 2009-10 NHL season in Sweden against the St. Louis Blues.[16] 
The Wings made the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive years during 
the early 1940s. In 1941 they were swept by the Boston Bruins, and in 1942 
they lost a seven-game series to Toronto after winning the first three 
games. However, in 1943, with Syd Howe and Mud Bruneteau scoring 20 goals 
apiece, Detroit won their third Cup by sweeping the Bruins. Through the 
rest of the decade, the team made the playoffs every year, and reached 
the Finals three more times. In 1946, one of the greatest players in hockey 
history came into the NHL with the Red Wings. Gordie Howe, a right-winger 
from Floral, Saskatchewan, only scored seven goals and 15 assists in his 
first season and would not reach his prime for a few more years. It was 
also the last season as head coach for Adams, who stepped down after the 
season to concentrate on his duties as general manager. He was succeeded 
by minor league coach Tommy Ivan. By his second season, Howe was paired 
with Sid Abel and Ted Lindsay to form what would become one of the great 
lines in NHL history—the "Production Line". Lindsay's 33 goals propelled 
the Wings to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were swept by the Maple 
Leafs. Detroit reached the Finals again the following season, only to be 
swept again by Toronto. During the 1950 Stanley Cup Semi-Finals, Leo Reise 
Jr. scored the winning goal in overtime preventing the Leafs from winning 
four straight championships. This goal, as Gordie Howe put it, "propelled 
the Red Wings to an eventual Stanley Cup Championship", with Pete Babando 
scoring the game winner in double overtime of Game 7 to beat the Rangers 
in the Finals. After the game, Lindsay skated around the Olympia ice with 
the Cup, beginning a tradition that continues today.[17] After being upset 
by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1951 semifinals, Detroit won its fifth 
Cup in 1952, sweeping both the Leafs and the Canadiens, with the Production 
Line of Howe, Abel and Lindsay joined by second-year goaltender Terry Sawchuk. 
Detroit would become the first team in 17 years to go undefeated in the 
playoffs.[citation needed] They also scored 24 playoff goals, compared 
to Toronto and Montreal's combined total of 5. Abel left the Wings for 
Chicago following the season, and his spot on the roster was replaced by 
Alex Delvecchio. James E. Norris died in December 1952. He was succeeded 
as team president by his daughter, Marguerite, the first (and as of the 
2015–16 season, only) woman to head an NHL franchise.[18] She made no secret 
of her dislike for Adams. While she could have summarily fired him, since 
he was still without a contract, she chose not to do so.[citation needed] 
Following another playoff upset in 1953 at the hands of the Bruins, the 
Red Wings won back to back Stanley Cups, beating the rival powerhouse Montreal 
Canadiens. Both of the Stanley Cup Finals played between the two teams 
were decided in seven games. The 7th final game during the 1953-1954 finals 
was won with one of the oddest cup winning goals ever, when the pesky 5'7" 
left winger Tony Leswick, known more for his relentless checking than scoring 
prowess, shot a puck towards the Montreal goal from the middle of the ice. 
Habs defenseman Doug Harvey tried to gain control of the wobbly puck with 
his glove, but instead redirected it past Montreal goalie Gerry McNeil.[19] 
The repeat of the series the season after was another nailbiter, as all 
of the games were won by their respective home teams, with Detroit taking 
the 7th game at home. Montreal was sorely lacking its all-star Maurice 
Richard, who was suspended after hitting a linesman during the regular 
season, and the Red Wings' stars carried their team, as Lindsay scored 
four goals in a single game and Howe scored 20 points during the playoffs, 
12 of which during the finals, all new records in the league.[20] The 1954–55 
season ended a run of eight straight regular season titles, an NHL record.[21] 
During the 1955 off-season, Marguerite Norris lost an intra-family power 
struggle, and was forced to turn over the Wings to her younger brother 
Bruce, who had inherited his father's grain business.[citation needed] 
Detroit and Montreal once again met in the 1956 finals, but this time the 
Canadiens won the Cup, their first of five in a row. In 1957 Ted Lindsay, 
who had scored 30 goals and led the league in assists with 55, teamed up 
with Harvey to help start the National Hockey League Players' Association 
(NHLPA).[citation needed] As a result, he, along with outspoken young goaltender 
Glenn Hall, was promptly traded to Chicago (which was owned by James D. 
Norris, Bruce's elder brother) after his most productive year. The Lindsay 
deal was one of several trades made by Adams, which showed his tendency 
to shuffle the roster regardless of whether the team had had success the 
previous season. In 1950 he had traded Harry Lumley, who had just backstopped 
the team to a Stanley Cup, to the Chicago Black Hawks in order to make 
room for Terry Sawchuk, who in turn would then make room for the future 
Hall of Famer Hall. Eventually he re-acquired Sawchuk in a trade for the 
young left winger Johnny Bucyk. Bucyk went on to play 21 more years with 
the Bruins. In 1959 the Red Wings missed the playoffs for the first time 
in 21 years, but within a couple of years the franchise was able to rejuvenate 
itself. The Red Wings made the Finals for four of the next six years between 
1961 and 1966. However, despite having Howe, Delvecchio, Norm Ullman, and 
Parker MacDonald as consistent goal-scorers, Lindsay's sudden one-year 
comeback in 1964–65, and Sawchuk and later Roger Crozier between the pipes, 
the Wings came away empty-handed. Adams was fired as general manager in 
1963. He had coached for 15 years and served as general manager for 31 
years on a handshake, and his 36–year tenure as general manager is still 
the longest for any general manager in NHL history.[citation needed] Only 
a year after making the Finals, the Red Wings finished a distant fifth, 
24 points out of the playoffs. It was the beginning of a slump from which 
they would not emerge for almost 20 years. Between 1967 and 1983, Detroit 
only made the playoffs twice, winning one series. From 1968 to 1982, the 
Wings had 14 head coaches (not counting interim coaches), with none lasting 
more than three seasons. In contrast, their first six full-time coaches—Art 
Duncan, Adams, Ivan, Jimmy Skinner and Abel—covered a 42-year period. During 
this dark era in franchise history, the team was derisively known as the 
"Dead Wings."[22] One factor in the Red Wings' decline was the end of the 
old development system, which allowed Adams to get young prospects to commit 
to playing for Detroit as early as their 16th birthday. Another factor 
was Ned Harkness, who was hired as coach in 1970 and was promoted to general 
manager midway through the season. A successful college hockey coach, Harkness 
tried to force his two-way style of play on a veteran Red Wings team resistant 
to change. The Wings chafed under his rule in which he demanded short hair 
and no smoking, and put other rules in place regarding drinking and phone 
calls.[23] Harkness was forced to resign in 1973 ending the period colloquially 
referred to as "Darkness with Harkness."[citation needed] In the expansion 
season of 1967–68, the Red Wings also acquired longtime star left-winger 
Frank Mahovlich from the defending Cup champs in Toronto. Mahovlich would 
go on a line with Howe and Delvecchio, and in 1968–69, he scored a career-high 
49 goals and had two All-Star seasons in Detroit. But this could not last. 
Mahovlich was traded to Montreal in 1970, and Howe retired after the 1970–71 
season. Through the decade, with Mickey Redmond having two 50–goal seasons 
and Marcel Dionne starting to reach his prime (which he did not attain 
until he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings), a lack of defensive and 
goaltending ability continually hampered the Wings. During 1979–80, the 
Wings left the Olympia for Joe Louis Arena. In 1982, after 50 years of 
family ownership, Bruce Norris sold the Red Wings to Mike Ilitch, founder 
of Little Caesars.[24] In 1983 the Wings drafted Steve Yzerman, a center 
from the Peterborough Petes with their first-round pick. He led the team 
in scoring in his rookie year and started the Wings' climb back to the 
top. That season, with John Ogrodnick scoring 42 times and Ivan Boldirev 
and Ron Duguay also with 30–goal seasons, Detroit made the playoffs for 
the first time in six years. Defenseman Brad Park, acquired from the Boston 
Bruins in the 1983 free-agent market and a player who had never missed 
the playoffs, also helped the Wings reach the postseason and ended up winning 
the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy the same season. Later, Park was asked 
to coach the Wings, but was sacked after 45 games in 1985–86. He admitted, 
"I took over a last-place team, and I kept them there." They did indeed 
end up in the basement with a 17–57–6 record for only 40 points. This was 
the same year that the Wings added enforcer Bob Probert, one of the most 
familiar faces of the Wings in the 1980s and 1990s. By 1987, with Yzerman, 
now the captain following the departure of Danny Gare, joined by Petr Klima, 
Adam Oates, Gerard Gallant, defenseman Darren Veitch and new head coach 
Jacques Demers, the Wings won a playoff series for only the second time 
in the modern era. They made it all the way to the conference finals against 
the powerful and eventual Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers, but lost 
in five games. In 1988 they won their first division title in 23 years 
(since 1964–65, when they finished first in a one-division league). They 
did so, however, in a relatively weak division; no other team in the Norris 
finished above .500. As was the case in the previous season, they made 
it to the conference finals only to lose again to the eventual Cup champion 
Oilers in five games. In 1989, Yzerman scored a career-best 65 goals,[25] 
but Detroit was upset in the first round by the Chicago Blackhawks. The 
following season, Yzerman scored 62 goals, but the team missed the playoffs 
(which, as of 2016, is the most recent time they did so). But it was Demers, 
not Yzerman, who got the pink slip. New coach Bryan Murray was unable to 
get them back over .500, but they returned to the playoffs. Yzerman was 
joined by Sergei Fedorov, who would be an award-winner and frequent all-star 
for the team in the 1990s. In 1992, the team acquired Ray Sheppard, who 
had a career-best 52 goals two years later; and in 1993, top defenseman 
Paul Coffey. Also joining the Red Wings around this time were draft picks 
like Vyacheslav Kozlov, Darren McCarty, Vladimir Konstantinov and Nicklas 
Lidstrom. Former Montreal Canadiens coach Scotty Bowman got behind the 
Motown bench in 1993. In his second season, the lockout-shortened 1994–95 
NHL season. Bowman guided Detroit to its first Finals appearance in 29 
years, only to be swept by the New Jersey Devils. The Wings kept adding 
more star power, picking up Slava Fetisov, Igor Larionov, and goaltender 
Mike Vernon in trades and winning an NHL record 62 games in 1995-96 in 
an 82-game schedule. After defeating the St. Louis Blues in seven games 
the Wings would fall in the Western Conference Finals to the eventual Stanley 
Cup champion Colorado Avalanche. The following year, Detroit, joined by 
Brendan Shanahan and Larry Murphy during the season, once again reached 
the Finals in 1997. After defeating the St. Louis Blues, the Mighty Ducks 
of Anaheim and the Avalanche in the first three rounds, the Wings went 
on to beat the Philadelphia Flyers in four straight games in the Stanley 
Cup Finals. It was the Wings' first Stanley Cup since 1955, breaking the 
longest drought (42 years long) in the league at that time. Mike Vernon 
accepted the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in 1997 playoffs. 
Misfortune befell the Wings six days after their championship; defenseman 
Vladimir Konstantinov, one of the Wings' "Russian Five", suffered a brain 
injury[26] in a limousine accident, and his career came to an abrupt end. 
The Red Wings dedicated the 1997–98 season to Konstantinov. The Wings won 
the Cup finals in four games, this time over the Washington Capitals, and 
Konstantinov came out onto the ice in his wheelchair on victory night to 
touch the Cup. Despite his Conn Smythe Trophy in the 1997 playoffs, Mike 
Vernon had been replaced as the regular Wings goaltender during the season 
with the younger Chris Osgood. The following season, the Wings looked poised 
to "three-peat" for the first time in franchise history, acquiring three-time 
top blueliner Chris Chelios from his hometown Chicago Blackhawks in March 
1999. Also acquired at the trade deadline were defenseman Ulf Samuelsson 
and winger Wendel Clark. Despite high aspirations, however, Detroit would 
end up losing in the Western Conference Semifinals to Colorado in six games. 
The Wings had built up a fierce rivalry with the Avalanche. With Colorado 
beating Detroit in the third round in 1996, in the second round of both 
1999 and 2000, and the Red Wings beating the Avs in the third round in 
1997, the battles between these two teams had become one of the fiercest 
in the League. During a notorious game on March 26, 1997, a brawl ensued 
between Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy and his Detroit counterpart Mike 
Vernon. In 2001, Detroit, the NHL's second-best team in the regular season, 
were upset in the playoffs by the Los Angeles Kings. During the ensuing 
off-season, the team acquired goalie Dominik Hasek (the defending Vezina 
Trophy winner) and forwards Luc Robitaille and Brett Hull. Russian prospect 
Pavel Datsyuk also joined the team. Strengthened by the additions, the 
Wings posted the League's best record in the 2001–02 regular season and 
defeated Colorado in seven games in the Western Conference Finals after 
beating the Vancouver Canucks and St. Louis Blues in rounds one and two. 
The Red Wings then went on to capture another Stanley Cup in five games 
over the Carolina Hurricanes, with Nicklas Lidstrom winning the Conn Smythe 
Trophy as the playoffs' MVP. Bowman and Hasek both retired after the season. 
The 2003 season saw the Red Wings promote Associate Coach Dave Lewis to 
the head coach position after Bowman's retirement. In the market for a 
new starting goaltender after Hasek's retirement, the Red wings signed 
Curtis Joseph from the Toronto Maple Leafs to a three-year, $24 million 
deal. Also new to the lineup was highly touted Swedish prospect Henrik 
Zetterberg. The Red Wings finished the season second in the Western Conference 
and third overall in the NHL, beginning the 2003 playoffs against the seventh-seeded 
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The Ducks, however, shocked the hockey world by 
sweeping the Red Wings in four games en route to a Finals appearance. In 
the off-season, long-time Red Wing Sergei Fedorov signed with the Mighty 
Ducks as a free agent after a lengthy contract dispute. Additionally, Dominik 
Hasek opted to come out of retirement and join the Wings for the 2003–04 
season. Joseph, despite being one of the highest-paid players in the NHL, 
spent part of the season in the minor leagues, but after Hasek was sidelined 
for the season with an injury, Joseph led the team to the top of the Central 
Division and the NHL standings. The Red Wings eliminated the Nashville 
Predators in six games in the first round of the 2004 playoffs, which led 
to a second round matchup with the Calgary Flames. The teams split the 
first four games, and headed to Detroit for a pivotal Game 5, which the 
Red Wings lost, 1–0. They were then eliminated two nights later in Calgary 
by the same scoreline in overtime. During the 2004 off-season, the Wings 
focused on retaining players already on the roster and in the organization 
instead of testing the free agent market, re-signing several players before 
the 2004–05 NHL lockout eventually canceled the entire season. On July 
15, 2005, Mike Babcock, former head coach in Anaheim, became the new head 
coach for the Wings. During a November 21, 2005, game against Nashville, 
defenseman Jiri Fischer suffered a heart arrhythmia and collapsed on the 
bench. The game was canceled because of his injury, and was made up on 
January 23, 2006. This was the first time in NHL history a game had been 
postponed by injury. The game was played for the full 60 minutes; however, 
the Predators were allowed to maintain their 1–0 lead from the original 
game and won, 3–2. The Red Wings won the Presidents' Trophy with a 58–16–8 
record, earning them 124 points, and secured home ice advantage for the 
entire playoffs. They opened the 2006 playoffs against the Edmonton Oilers 
with a 3–2 overtime victory at Joe Louis Arena, but the Oilers won four 
of the next five games to take the series. Continuing the shakeup of the 
Red Wings roster, the off-season saw the departure of Brendan Shanahan 
and the return of Dominik Hasek, while Steve Yzerman announced his retirement 
after a 23-season Hall of Fame-caliber career with the Wings, at the time 
having played the second most games in history all with a single team (behind 
fellow Red Wing Alex Delvecchio and later also surpassed by Nicklas Lidstrom). 
Yzerman retired with the additional distinction of having been the longest-serving 
team captain in NHL history. The Red Wings opened the 2006–07 season with 
Nicklas Lidstrom as the new captain. The team retired Steve Yzerman's jersey 
number 19 on January 2. The Wings finished first in the Western Conference 
and tied for first in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres, but the Sabres were 
awarded the Presidents' Trophy by virtue of having the greater number of 
wins. Detroit advanced to the third round of the 2007 playoffs after defeating 
Calgary and the San Jose Sharks both in six games, coming back three-straight 
after the Sharks' 2–1 series lead. The Red Wings, however, then lost to 
the eventual Stanley Cup winning team, the Anaheim Ducks, in the Western 
Conference Finals, four games to two. To start the 2007–08 campaign, Henrik 
Zetterberg recorded at least a point in each of Detroit's first 16 games, 
setting a club record. The Wings cruised to the playoffs, where they faced 
the Nashville Predators. After goalie Dominik Hasek played poorly in Games 
3 and 4 of the series, both losses, Head Coach Mike Babcock replaced him 
with Chris Osgood. Osgood had departed the Wings earlier in the decade, 
only to be re-acquired as a backup in 2005. Osgood never left the net for 
the remainder of the playoffs, as the Red Wings came back in that series 
on their way to winning their 11th Stanley Cup. The final victory came 
in Game 6 on June 4, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, by a score 
of 3–2. This was the Wings' fourth Stanley Cup in 11 years. Zetterberg 
scored the winning goal in the decisive game, and was also named the winner 
of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. 
It was the first time a team captained by a non-North American player (Nicklas 
Lidstrom) won the Stanley Cup. On July 2, 2008, the Detroit Red Wings announced 
the signing of Marian Hossa. From the beginning of the 2008–09 season to 
New Year's Day, the Wings enjoyed success. Although they finished second 
in the conference to the San Jose Sharks, the Wings became the first team 
in NHL history to top 100 points in nine straight seasons. On January 1, 
2009, the Red Wings played the Chicago Blackhawks in the third NHL Winter 
Classic at Chicago's Wrigley Field, beating them 6–4. The Wings entered 
the 2009 playoffs as the second overall seed in the Western Conference. 
The Red Wings handily swept the Columbus Blue Jackets, then beat the eighth-seeded 
Anaheim Ducks in a hard fought seven-game series. They took on the vastly 
improved Chicago Blackhawks in the Conference Finals, winning in five games. 
The Red Wings would face the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Finals for a second 
consecutive year, but this series would feature a different outcome. Pittsburgh 
defeated the Red Wings in seven games, Detroit becoming only the second 
NHL team to lose the Cup at home in Game 7. The Red Wings began the 2009–10 
NHL season in Stockholm, falling in both games to the St. Louis Blues by 
scores of 4–3 and 5–3, respectively. They were plagued by injuries throughout 
the season and lost the second most man-games to injury, with only the 
last place Edmonton Oilers losing more. The beginning of the season was 
a struggle for the Wings, with key players out of the lineup including 
Henrik Zetterberg, Tomas Holmstrom, Johan Franzen, Valtteri Filppula and 
Niklas Kronwall. After the Olympic break, Detroit posted a record of 13–2–2 
and earned 28 points, the most by any team in the NHL in the month of March. 
This run helped them secure the fifth playoff seed in the Western Conference. 
Detroit won their first-round playoff series over the Phoenix Coyotes in 
seven games. In the second round, they fell behind the San Jose Sharks 
three games to one, before being knocked out of the playoffs in five games. 
All four games that the Red Wings lost that series were decided by one 
goal. The lone game that they won ended with a final score of 7–1. A healthier 
Red Wings team finished the 2010–11 NHL season with a 47–25–10 record and 
104 points to win the Central Division title. They earned the #3 seed in 
the Western Conference for the Stanley Cup playoffs (extending their professional 
sports record of post-season appearances to 20 seasons), finishing behind 
the Vancouver Canucks (117) and San Jose Sharks (105). The Wings again 
faced the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round of the playoffs, this time 
sweeping them 4–0—making them the only team in the 2011 playoffs to sweep 
the first round—and again moved on to play the Sharks in Round 2. After 
losing the first three games of the series against the Sharks, the Red 
Wings won three consecutive games to force a Game 7, becoming just the 
eighth team in NHL history to accomplish the feat (the Chicago Blackhawks 
became the seventh team to do so earlier in the 2011 playoffs, against 
Vancouver). The Red Wings lost Game 7 to the Sharks by a score of 3–2, 
and were eliminated. During the 2011 off-season, Red Wings defenseman Brian 
Rafalski retired, citing injuries as the main reason behind his decision. 
Detroit soon signed free agent defenseman Ian White to take his place. 
Long-time Red Wings Kris Draper and Chris Osgood also announced their retirement 
from hockey, with both soon taking positions within the club. Detroit signed 
goaltender Ty Conklin for his second tour of duty with the team. Tragedy 
struck the organization and the rest of the National Hockey League upon 
the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl air disaster, which claimed the lives of former 
Red Wings assistant coach Brad McCrimmon and defenseman Ruslan Salei, who 
had joined the KHL team during the summer. Stefan Liv, a former Red Wings 
goaltending prospect, was also among the fatalities. The Red Wings then 
added a patch to the left arm of their uniforms with the trio's initials. 
On February 14, 2012, the Red Wings set the NHL record for most consecutive 
wins at home in a single season by winning their 21st home game with a 
3–1 victory over the Dallas Stars, and on Sunday, February 19, 2012, defeated 
the San Jose Sharks to record their 23rd consecutive home victory, breaking 
the overall record previously held by the Boston Bruins over two seasons 
from 1929 to 1930. The Red Wings also made the NHL playoffs extending their 
streak of 21-straight playoff appearances as the fifth seed. They were 
defeated in five games by their opening-round opponent, the Nashville Predators. 
On Thursday, May 31, 2012, Nicklas Lidstrom retired after his 20th consecutive 
NHL season, and sixth year as captain of the Detroit Red Wings.[27] Later 
in the off-season, fellow longtime Swedish Red Wing Tomas Holmstrom would 
also retire. Henrik Zetterberg was named successor to Nicklas Lidstrom 
as team captain. On July 1, 2012, the first day of the NHL free agency 
period, the Detroit Red Wings signed Swiss forward Damien Brunner to a 
one-year, entry-level contract; forward Jordin Tootoo to a three-year, 
$5.7 million contract; and goaltender Jonas Gustavsson to a two-year, $3 
million deal. The team won their final four games of the 2012–13 season 
to earn the seventh seed of the playoffs. The Red Wings' 3–0 victory over 
the Dallas Stars on April 27, 2013, clinched a playoff appearance; had 
they lost the game in regulation, they would have missed the playoffs by 
one point. Detroit's win preserved their streak of 22 consecutive playoff 
appearances, extending their North American professional sports franchise 
record. As the seventh seed in the 2013 playoffs, the Red Wings faced the 
second-seeded Anaheim Ducks. The Wings survived a fierce battle that included 
four overtime games, winning the series 4–3 after a 3–2 Game 7 victory 
in Anaheim.[28] The next round pitted the Red Wings against the top-seeded 
and eventual Stanley cup winners Chicago, and also went seven games. Even 
after jumping out to a 3-1 series lead, on May 29, the Wings were eliminated 
from the playoffs in a 2–1 overtime loss to the 'Hawks in Game 7. On July 
5, 2013, the Red Wings signed long time Ottawa Senators captain Daniel 
Alfredsson to a one-year contract and long time Florida Panther Stephen 
Weiss to a five-year contract. In the 2013–14 season, the Red Wings moved 
to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. On April 9, 2014, the 
Red Wings clinched their 23rd consecutive playoff appearance, though they 
were eliminated in the first round by the Boston Bruins. On April 9, 2015, 
after the 2014–15 regular season, the Red Wings clinched their 24th consecutive 
playoff appearance, thus extending the longest streak in the four major 
North American sports. The team, however, was eliminated in the first round 
by the Tampa Bay Lightning. Petr Mrazek had gained the #1 goalie role from 
Jimmy Howard, and Niklas Kronwall was suspended for the deciding game 7 
as Tampa Bay erased a 3-2 deficit to win the series. Head coach Mike Babcock, 
concluding the final year of his contract, left the Red Wings and became 
coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Jeff Blashill, head coach of the Red 
Wings' top farm club, the Grand Rapids Griffins, was named his successor 
on June 9. On April 9, 2016, even though the Red Wings lost 3-2 to the 
New York Rangers, the Ottawa Senators beat the Boston Bruins 6-1 as the 
Red Wings narrowly made the playoffs and the longest streak in the four 
major North American sports was extended to a 25th consecutive season. 
The Red Wings lost the first two games of their 2016 opening round playoff 
series with Tampa Bay in a rematch of the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs meeting 
between the two. Detroit won Game 3 at home, but ended up losing the series, 
four games to one. The Red Wings' jerseys (traditionally known in hockey 
as "sweaters") have been more or less the same since the 1930s – a white 
or red base with red or white piping. The only significant changes have 
been the replacement of the word "DETROIT" with the "winged wheel" logo 
in 1932, and vertical arch lettering for the players' names and block letters 
in 1983. The Hockey News voted the Red Wings' "winged wheel" logo as one 
of the best in the league in 2009.[29] The Red Wings, like all NHL teams, 
updated their jerseys to the new Rbk Edge standard for the 2007–08 NHL 
season. The Red Wings kept their design as close as possible, with a few 
exceptions: On the road (white) jersey, there is more red on the sleeves 
as the color panel begins closer to the shoulder. The white sleeve numbers 
on both jerseys were also moved up a bit, creating more red space between 
the bottom of the number and the wraparound white trim. The letters of 
the captain and alternate captains were moved to the player's right shoulder; 
Detroit is the only team in the league that made this change (the change 
was necessitated by the stitching of the sweater), although the 2008 NHL 
All Star jerseys featured this as well. All teams now have an NHL shield 
panel on the front of the jersey near the collar, and a rounded hemline 
at the bottom of the jersey which goes up at the hips, providing more mobility. 
The Red Wings have not used any alternate logos or uniforms since the trend 
became popular in the 1990s, the sole exceptions were select games of the 
1991–92 season commemorating the league's 75th Anniversary, and for a commemorative 
game in 1994 at Chicago Stadium. Those jerseys were based on the uniforms 
worn by the team (then the Detroit Cougars) in 1927–28. The throwbacks 
are primarily white with five red horizontal stripes on the body, the broadest 
middle stripe bearing "DETROIT" in bold letters, and three red stripes 
on the sleeves. The striped throwbacks have been a popular design, as replicas 
continue to be marketed by the NHL.[30] This jersey was also a basis for 
the uniforms worn by Wayne Gretzky's team of NHLPA All-Stars, nicknamed 
the "99ers," for their exhibition tour in Europe during the 1994–95 NHL 
lockout; a picture of Gretzky in this jersey was used for the cover art 
of a video game bearing his name. Alternate jerseys for the RBK Edge system 
were made for 2008–09 and continues today, but Detroit has thus far opted 
not to use alternates. The Red Wings wore alternative "Retro" jerseys for 
the 2009 NHL Winter Classic in Chicago. The one-time jerseys were based 
on the uniforms worn by the then-Detroit Cougars during their inaugural 
season of 1926–27.[31] These jerseys were white, with a single bold red 
stripe on the sleeves and chest, and a uniquely styled white Old English 
"D" (a Detroit sports tradition, but formerly used by the Wings, Detroit 
Lions, and the University of Detroit Titans) centered on the chest stripe, 
but not to be confused with the Old English "D" used by the Detroit Tigers. 
These jerseys were also worn for their final 2009 regular season home game, 
again against the Chicago Blackhawks. The Red Wings again used an alternate 
jersey mimicking throwback jerseys for the 2014 NHL Winter Classic against 
the Toronto Maple Leafs at Michigan Stadium. The Red Wings wore a specially 
designed one-time only jersey for their 2015-2016 Stadium Series game in 
Denver against the Colorado Avalanche on February 27, 2016. The majority 
of this jersey was the traditional red, decorated with a thick diagonal 
white stripe running from the player's right shoulder across the front 
towards the left hip. The bottom of each sleeve featured a thick white 
stripe from wrist to elbow. The crest on the front of the jersey was a 
stylized red "D". The words "Red Wings" were printed in all capital letters 
on the left side of the collar, and the phrase "EST. 1926" was printed 
inside the back of the collar. These jerseys featured the current Red Wings 
logo on the left shoulder cap. The names and numbers were printed larger 
than traditional NHL jerseys to increase visibility and player identification 
for fans watching the game at Coors Field, a stadium traditionally used 
for Major League Baseball. The "Legend of the Octopus" is a sports tradition 
during Detroit Red Wings playoff games, in which an octopus is thrown onto 
the ice surface for good luck.[32] During the playoffs, Joe Louis Arena 
is generally adorned with a giant octopus with red eyes, nicknamed "Al" 
after Joe Louis Arena head ice manager Al Sobotka.[33] The 1952 playoffs 
featured the start of the tradition—the octopus throw. The owner of a local 
fish market, Peter Cusimano, threw one from the stands onto the ice. The 
eight legs are symbolic of the eight wins it took to win the Stanley Cup 
at the time. The Red Wings went on to sweep both of their opponents that 
year en route to a Stanley Cup championship. The NHL has, at various times, 
tried to eliminate this tradition but it continues to this day.[34][35] 
Al Sobotka is the man responsible for removing the thrown creatures from 
the ice. He is known for swinging the tossed octopi above his head when 
walking off the ice. On April 19, 2008, NHL director of hockey operations 
Colin Campbell sent a memo to the Detroit Red Wings organization that forbids 
Zamboni drivers from cleaning up any octopi thrown onto the ice and that 
violating the mandate would result in a $10,000 fine.[36] Instead, it will 
be the linesmen who will perform this duty. In an email to the Detroit 
Free Press, NHL spokesman Frank Brown justified the ban because "matter 
flies off the octopus and gets on the ice" when Al Sobotka does it.[37] 
This ban, however, was later loosened to allow for the octopus twirling 
to take place at the zamboni entrance.[38] Typically during the last minute 
or two of games that the Red Wings are winning, especially around the end 
of the season and during the playoffs, the fans at Joe Louis Arena are 
known to start singing along to Journey's "Don't Stop Believin'." The song 
is played over the PA system and continues until it is muted while the 
crowd sings the words "Born and raised in South Detroit," then the song 
resumes over the speakers in the arena. [39] The Red Wings' flagship radio 
stations are Detroit sister stations WXYT-AM 1270 and WXYT-FM 97.1. Games 
are carried on both stations unless there is a conflict with Detroit Tigers 
baseball. There are several affiliate stations throughout Michigan, Northwestern 
Ohio, and Southwestern Ontario.[40] The Red Wings' exclusive local television 
rights are held by Fox Sports Detroit.[41] Announcers: Three members of 
the Red Wings organization have received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award: 
Lynch called the first locally televised game at Olympia for the original 
WWJ-TV in 1949. He remained with the organization for 63 years, serving 
as Director of Publicity from 1975 to 1982, and was the public address 
announcer from 1982 until his death in 2012.[43] From 2008-12, a second 
PA Announcer was added to work alongside him, first John Fossen, then Erich 
Freiny. Lynch died in the offseason following the 2012 season,[44] and 
Freiny has been the sole PA announcer since then. A recording of Lynch 
can still be heard in the arena when there is one minute of play remaining 
in each period. This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed 
by the Detroit Red Wings. For the full season-by-season history, see List

members of the Red Wings organization have been honored by the Hockey Hall 
of Fame over the course of the team's history. The first such selections 
came in 1958 when former players Alec Connell, Frank Foyston, Frank Fredrickson, 
George Hay and Duke Keats, as well as former owner James E. Norris, were 
all inducted. In 1959, they were joined by long-time coach Jack Adams and 
former player Tiny Thompson, both inducted as players. Since then, many 
more Red Wings have been inducted, including James D. Norris, Jack Stewart, 
Syd Howe, Ted Lindsay, Sid Abel, Red Kelly, Terry Sawchuk, Gordie Howe, 
Alex Delvecchio, Viacheslav Fetisov, Mike Ilitch, Mark Howe, Steve Yzerman, 
Chris Chelios and Brendan Shanahan. Red Wings radio broadcaster Budd Lynch 
was named the recipient of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award in 1985 for 
his years of service as the radio play-by-play announcer for the team. 
Lynch also served as Detroit's public address announcer from 1985 until 
his death in 2012. In addition to Lynch, Bruce Martyn and Mickey Redmond 
have also won the award. The Red Wings have retired seven numbers. The 
first number the Red Wings retired was #9 in 1972 in honor of Gordie Howe, 
who played right wing for the team from 1946 to 1971. Howe won both the 
Art Ross Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy six times each and won the 
Stanley Cup as a Red Wing four times. In 2007, the Red Wings retired Steve 
Yzerman's #19. During Yzerman's career, he won the Bill Masterton Memorial 
Trophy, the Conn Smythe Trophy, the Frank J. Selke trophy and the Ted Lindsay 
Award. Yzerman served as Detroit's captain for 19 seasons, an NHL record, 
and won the Stanley Cup three times as a player with the Red Wings. The 
most recent retired number is Nicklas Lidstrom's #5, which was retired 
on March 6, 2014. Lidstrom won the Norris Trophy seven times, the Conn 
Smythe Trophy once and the Stanley Cup four times during his career in 
Detroit. The Red Wings have also made the number 6 of Larry Aurie and the 
number 16 of Vladimir Konstantinov no longer available for issue. However, 
the numbers are not considered to be officially retired.[46] Although Aurie's 
uniform was retired in 1938 by James E. Norris, current team owner Mike 
Ilitch does not consider the number to be retired.[47] Konstantinov's number 
has not been issued to any player since he was permanently disabled in 
a vehicle accident after the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals.[48] Number 99 is 
also unavailable due to having been retired by the league in honor of Wayne 
Gretzky.[49] All the players who have served as team captain with the Detroit 
franchise.[50] These players rank in the top ten in franchise history for 
goals, assists, and/or points as of the end of the 2015−16 season. Since 
it is possible to rank in one category but not others there are more than 
ten players listed in each table.[51] Figures are updated after each completed 
NHL season. Note: Pos = Position; GP = Games Played; G = Goals; A = Assists; 
Pts = Points; P/G = Points per game; * = current Red Wings player These 
players rank in the top ten in franchise history for wins as of the end 
of the 2015−16 season. There is a four way tie for ninth place in post 
season wins, resulting in twelve players listed in that table.[52] Figures 
are updated after each completed NHL season. Note: GP = Games Played; W
