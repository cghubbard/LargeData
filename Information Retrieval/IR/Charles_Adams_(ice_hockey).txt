Charles Francis Adams (October 18, 1876 â€“ October 2, 1947) was an American 
businessman and sports promoter who was the owner of the Boston Bruins, 
Boston Braves, Suffolk Downs, and The First National grocery store chain. 
Adams was born in Newport, Vermont on October 18, 1876 to Frank and Elizabeth 
(Benoit) Adams. His family struggled financially and at a young age Adams 
took a job as a chore boy at a corner grocery store to help subsidize the 
family's income. As a teenager Adams purchased logs for his father's sawmill.[1] 
After graduating from Jenney Business College in Enosburgh, Vermont, Adams 
moved to Springfield, Vermont where he worked for his uncle Oscar Adams' 
wholesale grocery business. After working for a time as a traveling grocer 
and tobacco salesman, Adams moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he 
became treasurer of the New England Maple Syrup Company. He later worked 
for the Fitzgerald, Hubbard & Company banking and brokerage firm.[1] Adams 
left Fitzgerald, Hubbard & Company to work for the John T. Connor Company, 
which later became the First National Store chain.[1] Adams was an avid 
hockey fan, watching amateur hockey in Boston and traveling to Montreal 
to watch professional hockey. After a scandal involving Boston amateur 
hockey players that resulted in many Boston fans becoming disenchanted 
with amateur hockey, Adams decided to try to bring professional hockey 
to the United States. On November 1, 1924, Adams was awarded the Bruins 
franchise for $15,000.[1] In 1926 Adams bought the entire Western Canada 
Hockey League from Frank Patrick and Lester Patrick for $300,000. This 
gave the Bruins the rights to Eddie Shore, Harry Oliver, Duke Keats, and 
Frank Boucher. To ensure the team had a fitting arena to play in, Adams 
guaranteed[2] $500,000 toward the construction of the Boston Garden.[1] 
Under his leadership the Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 1929.[1] 
In 1936 he transferred his stock to his son Weston Adams and minority owners 
Art Ross and Ralph Burkard.[3] On May 15, 1927, Charles Adams bought out 
the shares of Albert H. Powell to become a minority owner and vice-president 
of the Boston Braves.[4][5] In 1935, after Emil Fuchs' attempt to revive 
interest in the team by signing Babe Ruth failed, Adams demanded that Fuchs 
either step down as President or buy out his shares. On July 31, 1935, 
Emil Fuchs forfeited his shares to Charles F. Adams, who planned to sell 
the team as soon as possible.[6] On November 26, the National League took 
over control of the Braves due to the club's failure to fulfill its contractual 
obligations.[7] The club was awarded to Bob Quinn on December 10. Commissioner 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis did not allow Adams to be part of the new ownership 
group due to his stake in Suffolk Downs.[8] Adams was the head of Eastern 
Racing Association, the syndicate that founded Suffolk Downs.[9][10] He 
remained involved with the race track until 1945, when he sold his shares 
for $4 million.[11] Adams died on October 2, 1947 in Boston after a long 
illness.[12] He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1960. The NHL's 
Adams Division was formed in 1974 as part of the Prince of Wales Conference. 
The division existed for 19 seasons until 1993. It was named in honor of 
Adams. It is the fore-runner of the NHL's Northeast Division. Adams was
