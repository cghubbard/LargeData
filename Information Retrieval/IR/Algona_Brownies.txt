The Algona Brownies were an independent interracial baseball team that 
played in the 1902 and 1903 seasons. They were based in Algona, Iowa, and 
was primarily made up of former members of the Chicago Unions, Columbia 
Giants, and Chicago Union Giants teams. During their second and final season, 
the team makeup changed from having both black and white players to a team 
of only black players. That year, their final year, they won the Western 
championship, defeating the Chicago Union Giants in a challenge playoff.
