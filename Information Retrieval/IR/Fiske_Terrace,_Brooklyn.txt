Fiske Terrace is a planned community and neighborhood in the New York City 
borough of Brooklyn. Fiske Terrace is located in south central Brooklyn 
in the southern edge of the community of Flatbush and north of the community 
of Midwood. It is bounded by Glenwood Road on the north, Ocean Avenue on 
the east, the Bay Ridge Branch of the Long Island Rail Road/New York and 
Atlantic Railway right-of-way on the south, and the New York City Subway 
BMT Brighton Line subway line (B Q trains) on the west. Fiske Terrace was 
developed, along with Midwood Park with individually designed housing by 
the T.B. Ackerson Company in 1905;[1] after the T. B. Ackerson Company 
bought what was then a forest, it was razed within 18 months, giving way 
to about 150 custom-made houses as well as streets and utilities.[2] Prominent 
past residents included Richard Hellmann, creator and founder of "Hellmann's 
Mayonnaise",[3] and Charles Ebbets, owner of Ebbets Field Baseball Stadium 
and the Brooklyn Dodgers.[4] On March 18, 2008, the New York City Landmarks 
Preservation Commission unanimously approved designation of the Fiske Terrace-Midwood 
Park Historic District. 250 homes were designated.[5] The community is 
served by the Avenue H (formerly Fiske Terrace) station of the BMT Brighton 
Line, whose century-old station house was declared a landmark by the New 
York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on June 29, 2004. This allows 
renovations inside, but preserves the major structure and exterior. The 
contract to "restore the landmark station control house" as well as rehabilitation 
of the platforms and other stations structures was advertised for bids 
by the MTA for January 2007. The official designation report describes 
the building: Coordinates: 40°37′45″N 73°57′40″W﻿ / ﻿40.62917°N 73.96111°W﻿
