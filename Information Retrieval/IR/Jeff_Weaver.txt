Jeffrey Charles Weaver (born August 22, 1976) is a former right-handed 
Major League Baseball pitcher. During his career, he pitched for the Detroit 
Tigers, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 
St. Louis Cardinals, and Seattle Mariners. He is the older brother of fellow 
pitcher Jered Weaver. He is currently the pitching coach for the Oaks Christian 
School Baseball Team Weaver, a graduate of Simi Valley High School in Simi 
Valley, California, attended California State University, Fresno to play 
for the Bulldogs.[1] He was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the first 
round of the 1998 amateur draft, and made his Major League debut a year 
later.[2] He was the Detroit Tigers Opening Day starter in 2001 and 2002. 
In the 2002 season, he was traded to the New York Yankees in a three team 
deal that also involved the Oakland Athletics and Yankees prospects John-Ford 
Griffin, Jason Arnold, and Ted Lilly. Weaver's time with the Yankees was 
very turbulent, bouncing in and out of the starting rotation. In Game 4 
of the 2003 World Series, he allowed a 12th inning walk-off home run to 
Álex González. Following the 2003 season the Yankees traded Weaver to the 
Los Angeles Dodgers for Kevin Brown. In 2005, he went 14-11, with a 4.22 
ERA, a 1.17 WHIP, 3 complete games and a career-high 157 strikeouts in 
224 innings. Following the 2005 season, Weaver filed for free agency. The 
Dodgers offered him salary arbitration, but the two sides were unable to 
reach an agreement. On February 15, 2006, Weaver signed a 1-year deal with 
the Angels for $8.5 million. After posting a 3-10 record with a 6.29 ERA 
in Anaheim, he was designated for assignment on June 30. In a bit of an 
ironic coincidence, his younger brother, Jered Weaver, was recalled from 
the minor leagues and replaced Jeff in the starting rotation. On July 5, 
2006, the St. Louis Cardinals acquired Weaver from the Angels in exchange 
for minor leaguer Terry Evans and cash considerations. He debuted with 
the team as a pinch hitter in a 14-inning game between the Cardinals and 
Dodgers on July 13, 2006, at Busch Stadium. Jered and Jeff both appeared 
in the September 11, 2006, issue of Sports Illustrated that chronicled 
how Jeff Weaver's trade impacted Jeff and Jered both baseball-wise and 
in life away from the game. The younger Weaver was disappointed that his 
brother left without being around to see him make history by winning his 
first 9 career decisions. After yielding six runs in four innings in his 
first start, Weaver played a key role in the Cardinals World Series win. 
He won important games for the Cardinals in the final weeks of the season, 
helping them win the National League Central Division, and he started and 
won Game 2 of the 2006 National League Division Series. Weaver started 
and was the losing pitcher for Game 1 of the National League Championship 
Series against the New York Mets on October 12, 2006. He pitched five scoreless 
innings before giving up a two-run home run to Mets center fielder Carlos 
Beltrán in the sixth inning; as the Cards lost 2-0. In Game 5 of the National 
League Championship Series on October 17, 2006, Weaver pitched 6 innings 
allowing 2 runs on 6 hits, winning his second game of the 2006 postseason. 
After losing Game 2 of the 2006 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, Weaver 
came back on October 27, 2006, in Game 5 to pitch 8 innings, giving up 
4 hits and 1 earned run. He was credited with the win as the Cardinals 
clinched the series 4-1. On January 26, 2007, the Seattle Mariners signed 
Weaver as a free agent to a one-year deal worth $8–9 million. Weaver had 
a 14.32 ERA with only 22 innings pitched after six starts and was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list with "right shoulder tendinitis". It was speculated 
that this was a strategic move by the team to allow Weaver to take some 
time off and make a series of "Rehab" starts with a minor league affiliate. 
The hope was that he would be able to work out his problems without adversely 
impacting the Major League ball club; it seemed to work as Weaver pitched 
more effectively after his return. On June 20 versus the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Weaver posted a 4-hit, complete game, 7–0 shutout, which was his first 
win with Seattle. Although he pitched well in July and August, he finished 
with a 7–13 record and 6.20 ERA and became a free agent after the season. 
On April 15, 2008, Weaver signed a minor league deal with the Milwaukee 
Brewers.[3] However, after pitching in just nine minor league games, Weaver 
requested and was granted a release from his contract. On July 5, Weaver 
signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians, but did not 
appear in the majors with them, spending the rest of the season in AAA 
with the Buffalo Bisons. He signed a minor-league deal with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in February 2009[4] and was assigned to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes. 
After a few appearances with the Isotopes, Weaver was recalled to the Dodgers 
on April 30 and he pitched four scoreless innings of relief against the 
San Diego Padres, his first appearance in a Major League game since 2007. 
He made his first start of 2009 vs. the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 5 and 
allowed one run and struck out six in five innings. On June 20, 2009, Jeff 
Weaver started for the Dodgers against the Los Angeles Angels. The opposing 
starter was his younger brother Jered Weaver. This was the first pitching 
matchup between brothers since 2002 when Andy and Alan Benes matched up 
and only the 15th such game since 1967. The Dodgers won 6-4, with Jeff 
getting the win and Jered taking the loss.[5] On October 7, 2009, Weaver 
was the winning pitcher in Game One of the 2009 National League Division 
Series between the Dodgers and his former team, the St. Louis Cardinals. 
It was the fourth post-season victory of his career. Weaver returned to 
the Dodgers for the 2010 season on another minor league contract. He once 
more made the opening day roster as a reliever. On May 7, 2010, Weaver 
picked up his 100th career victory in a relief outing against the Colorado 
Rockies. He appeared in 43 games with the Dodgers in 2010, all in relief, 
and finished 5-1 with a 6.09 ERA. On September 28, 2016, Weaver was hired 
as the pitching coach for the Oaks Christian School Varsity Baseball team
