Daniel William Descalso (born October 19, 1986) is an American professional 
baseball infielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB). The St. Louis Cardinals drafted him in the third round of the MLB 
draft from University of California, Davis, and he made his MLB debut for 
the Cardinals in 2010. He later played for the Colorado Rockies. A versatile 
infielder, Descalso has played all four infield positions. Italian-American 
Descalso was born in Redwood City, California,[1] on October 19, 1986, 
to Marylou and George Descalso.[2] He is the oldest of six children.[3] 
He played baseball in San Carlos Little League[4] and went to Saint Francis 
High School in Mountain View, California.[5] He pitched as the team's number 
1 starter for three straight seasons, and played 2nd base.[3] He made the 
All-Central Coast Section squads twice, including first team as a senior, 
second team as a junior. He made the West Catholic Athletic League first 
teams in each of last two seasons, including WCAL MVP distinction in 2004. 
He also played football, winning first-team All-WCAL, second-team All-CCS 
and honorable mention All-Metro as a senior. He scored three touchdowns 
against their crosstown rivals during 2003 Homecoming game. He graduated 
in 2004.[6] He played baseball at St. Francis HS in Mountain View, California. 
He went on to UC Davis, where he played third base and majored in economics.[2] 
In 2007, Descalso was named to the NCAA All-Independent First Team.[7] 
He put up some of the best stats ever at UC Davis, with a .397 lifetime 
batting average and 92 career hits. His 22 doubles rank second all-time 
in school history.[8] Following his junior year, he was selected by the 
St. Louis Cardinals in the 3rd round (112th overall)[9] of the 2007 amateur 
entry draft. He was selected in the highest draft position ever for an 
Aggie player.[8] He is 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 190 pounds.[10] Following 
the draft, Descalso began his pro career with the Batavia Muckdogs, the 
Short-Season A affiliate of the Cardinals in the New York–Penn League. 
He played 69 games for the Muckdogs in 2007, splitting time between 3rd 
base and 2nd base.[11] In 2008, Descalso began with the Palm Beach Cardinals, 
the High-A affiliate of the Cardinals in the Florida State League. He played 
115 games in Jupiter, where he batted .243 and played shortstop, 2nd base, 
and 3rd base. In August 2008, he was advanced to the Springfield Cardinals, 
the Double-A affiliate in Missouri. He played in just 9 games, but hit 
.351. In 2009 with Springfield, Descalso had eight home runs and 51 RBI 
in 288 at-bats over 73 games, all at 2nd base. His line was an impressive 
.323/.396/.531. At the end of the 2009 season, he was named to the Double-A 
Texas League post-season all star team. However, he did not play in that 
game, instead was promoted to Triple-A Memphis in early July when Jarrett 
Hoffpauir was recalled by the Cardinals. After the call up, Descalso played 
most games at 2nd base, with 9 at 1st base. He was also named the 2009 
Springfield Cardinals Player of the Year. He missed final two weeks of 
2009 season to play for the gold medal winning team USA in the 2009 Baseball 
World Cup in Italy.[12] The Cardinals invited Descalso to the 2010 Spring 
camp, where he batted .500 with nine RBI in 14 games.[12] Through the first 
two months of the 2010 season, he exclusively played 2nd base.[11] On September 
18, Descalso's contract was purchased by the Cardinals and he was promoted 
to the major leagues.[13] He officially made his major league debut on 
September 18, 2010, at home against the San Diego Padres when he was announced 
as a pinch hitter (although he did not bat and was replaced by right-handed 
batter Nick Stavinoha).[14] His first game as a starter was on September 
22, 2010, against the Pirates at their park, where he garnered his first 
hit and first RBI on a 2-run double. It was at third base, rather than 
his natural second base position.[14] Nonetheless, his first MLB career 
fielding attempt was the front end of a 6–4–3 double play (Descalso-Schumaker–Pujols). 
He finished the year solidly, and remained on the 40-man roster. Given 
his late season performance, Descalso started the 2011 Spring training 
with a legitimate chance to make the Cardinals. However, the Cards had 
a number of capable infielders fighting for roster spots, including David 
Freese, Tyler Greene, Double-A prospect Matt Carpenter, and off-season 
acquisitions Ryan Theriot and Nick Punto.[15] The difficulty would be determining 
a position and securing a spot. An injury to Punto[16] and questions about 
Freese's durability left the Cards desperate for an extra utility infielder 
(rather than an outfielder). Ultimately, Descalso secured a roster spot 
out of training camp.[17] He hit his first major league home run on May 
3 in St. Louis in the 7th inning. The three-run blast was a game winner 
that vaulted the Cardinals to a come-from-behind 7–5 win against the Florida 
Marlins.[18] In a July 7 game against the Cincinnati Reds, he stroked four 
hits with two RBI.[19] Following the 2011 season, Daniel Descalso was a 
finalist for the Rawlings Gold Glove Award at third base for the National 
League, although the honor was later awarded to Plácido Polanco of the 
Philadelphia Phillies.[20] After playing regularly at second base during 
the 2012 season, Descalso played an integral role in the postseason. In 
Game 5 of the 2012 National League Division Series, where the Cardinals 
came back from a 6-run deficit to defeat the Washington Nationals 9–7, 
Descalso homered, doubled, and then hit a two-run single to tie the game.[21] 
On May 21, 2013, Decalso hit his first career grand slam and tallied a 
career-high five RBI as the Cardinals beat the San Diego Padres 10–2 at 
Petco Park.[22] Prior to the game, Descalso was batting just .197 with 
one home run.[22] For his 2013 season statistics, Descalso batted .238 
with five home runs and 42 RBI. He continued his versatility in the infield 
by making starts at second base, third base, and shortstop. He filed for 
a $1.65 million contract request following the season. The Cardinals and 
Descalso avoided arbitration and agreed to a one-year, $1.29 million contract 
on January 30, 2014.[23] Descalso made his Major League pitching debut 
against the Chicago Cubs in the top of the ninth inning with two outs on 
May 12, 2014. He threw two pitches, recording one out and allowing no hits. 
With a chance for increased playing time during interleague play against 
the Baltimore Orioles, he collected five hits in 10 AB over an August 8–10 
series.[24] Within the three consecutive days and four consecutive games, 
August 30 through September 1, 2014, Descalso became the first Cardinal 
player in team history to start a game at each of the four infield positions 
as follows; Saturday August 30, vs. Chicago Cubs (game 1) 2B, Saturday 
August 30, vs. Chicago Cubs (game 2) SS, Sunday August 31, vs. Chicago 
Cubs 1B, Monday, September 1, vs. Pittsburgh Pirates, 3B.[25][26][27][28] 
Descalso signed a two-year deal with the Colorado Rockies on December 16, 
2014. The deal totaled $3.6 million with the opportunity for another $1
