The 1938 elections to select inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame were 
conducted along much the same lines as the 1937 vote. Toward the goal of 
10 initial inductees from the 20th century, 8 had now been selected; members 
of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) were once again 
given authority to select any players active in the 20th century, excepting 
active players. The Centennial Commission retained the responsibility of 
selecting inductees whose contributions were largely as non-players. In 
the BBWAA election, voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates. 
Any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored 
with induction to the Hall upon its opening in the sport's supposed centennial 
year of 1939. Individuals who had been barred from baseball, though not 
formally ineligible, no longer received even the minimal support given 
them in the two prior elections. As the obvious stars had already been 
elected, only pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander made it out of this ballot. 
A total of 262 ballots were cast, with 2,474 individual votes for 119 specific 
candidates, an average of 9.44 per ballot; 197 votes were required for 
election. The balloting was dominated by players of the 1900s and 1910s, 
rather than those of the more recent two decades; the results were announced 
in January 1938. The sole candidate who received at least 75% of the vote 
and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since 
been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in italics: Once again, 
the Hall opted to have this small committee of six members select inductees 
"for outstanding service to base ball apart from playing the game." After 
selecting five individuals in 1937, the Commission chose two inductees 
at the major league winter meetings in New York City in December 1938,
