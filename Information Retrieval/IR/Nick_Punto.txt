Nicholas Paul Punto (born November 8, 1977) is an American former professional 
baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia 
Phillies, Minnesota Twins, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles 
Dodgers, and Oakland Athletics. He has also played for the Italian national 
baseball team in the World Baseball Classic. Punto is a 1996 graduate of 
Trabuco Hills High School in Mission Viejo, California. After high school, 
he attended Saddleback College, also in Mission Viejo. His father, Lou, 
was drafted by the Boston Red Sox. Nick and his wife, Natalie, have two 
children Nicole Jayne born on May 30, 2008 and a son, Nash. Punto was drafted 
in the 21st round of the 1998 MLB draft and made his major league debut 
with the Philadelphia Phillies on September 9, 2001. He singled to right 
field off Bob Scanlan of the Montreal Expos as a pinch hitter in the 8th 
inning. He had 2 hits in 5 at-bats in just 4 games with the Phillies that 
season. In 2002 with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, he played in 
115 games and hit .271, earning a selection as an International League 
All-Star. In 3 years with the Phillies he played in a total of 77 games 
and hit .223. His first, and only, home run with the Phillies was hit off 
Steve Trachsel of the New York Mets on July 10, 2003. After playing in 
a career-high 64 major-league games in 2003, he was acquired by the Minnesota 
Twins in the 2004 offseason (along with Carlos Silva) for Eric Milton. 
He started the season with the team, but he was injured twice and spent 
the majority of his time in 2004 on the disabled list. In 2005, he competed 
for the starting job at second base, which he eventually won, and in 2006 
became the starting third baseman. Punto was one of four Twins players 
nicknamed "The Piranhas" by White Sox manager, Ozzie Guillén.[1] The other 
Piranhas were Jason Tyner, Jason Bartlett, and Luis Castillo. In 2005 Nick 
Punto batted .239, with a career high 4 home runs, and 26 runs batted in 
over the duration of 112 games. Punto had his best full season in Minnesota 
during the 2006 season when he batted .290 with 45 runs batted in, and 
posted 17 stolen bases in 135 games. In 2007, Punto experienced his statistically 
worst full season with Minnesota, batting .210 with 25 runs batted in 150 
games. He posted the lowest slugging percentage (.271) of any major league 
player with at least 200 at-bats in a single season. This was the lowest 
slugging percentage by a player with over 400 at-bats since José Lind recorded 
a .269 slugging percentage for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1992. Punto also 
posted a −27.1 VORP in 2007, 8.5 runs worse than the second-worst position 
player in baseball, White Sox infielder Andy González. However, he has 
always played excellent defense and believed in his defensive abilities 
which the Twins are so keen on. On May 27 during an MPR broadcast Punto 
said, "I take too much pride in my defense to ever let (offensive struggles) 
affect me or affect my team. The one thing I can control is how I play 
defense." After being injured most of the first half of the 2008 season, 
Punto was activated from the DL on June 25, 2008 and finished the season 
batting .284 with 28 runs batted in.[2] Punto spent most of the 2008 season 
as the Twins' primary shortstop.[3] Punto signed a new two-year deal with 
the Twins worth $8.5 million following the 2008 season, with a club option 
for 2011 worth $5 million.[4] Punto represented Team Italy in the 2009 
World Baseball Classic. After struggling as the Twins regular shortstop 
in 2009, Punto began losing time in the lineup to fellow Twin Brendan Harris. 
After returning from the disabled list, Punto was re-inserted into the 
regular lineup at second base, following the struggles of infielders Alexi 
Casilla and Matt Tolbert. He finished the season batting .228 with 38 RBI 
over 440 plate appearances. Punto began the 2010 season as the Twins' starting 
third baseman, but ended up on the disabled list before the end of April 
with a strained groin muscle. Punto returned to the lineup in May, playing 
at third base, shortstop, and second base as injuries cropped up among 
other players. In July, he was essentially replaced as the starter at third 
base by Danny Valencia, but he continued to play regularly due to injuries 
to Orlando Hudson and J. J. Hardy. On October 29, the Twins declined Punto's 
$5 million team option, making him a free agent. In 7 years with the Twins, 
Punto played in 747 games with a .248 batting average. On January 21, 2011 
Punto signed a one-year contract with the St. Louis Cardinals worth $700,000.[5] 
He played in 63 games with the Cardinals, as a utility player, and hit 
.278. Punto had 3 hits in 14 at-bats in the 2011 World Series. On December 
14, 2011, Punto agreed to a 2-year contract with the Boston Red Sox worth 
$3 million. In 65 games with the Red Sox in 2012, he hit .200 while starting 
games at second base, third base and shortstop. He also appeared in five 
games at first base. On August 25, 2012 he was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers (along with Josh Beckett, Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez and 
$11 million in cash) for James Loney, Iván DeJesús, Jr., Allen Webster 
and two players to be named later (Jerry Sands and Rubby De La Rosa).[6] 
He appeared in 22 games with the Dodgers and hit .286. Punto represented 
Italy in the 2013 World Baseball Classic in March 2013. In the 2013 season, 
Punto saw extensive time at short stop due to injuries to Hanley Ramírez. 
He appeared in 116 games, his most since 2009, and hit .255 with 2 HR, 
21 RBI and 34 runs. On September 16, 2013, Punto led off a game against 
the Arizona Diamondbacks with a single to center field off of Trevor Cahill. 
Despite the fact that the ball traveled into the outfield, Punto made a 
headfirst slide into first base anyway. On November 13, 2013, Punto agreed 
to a one-year, $3 million contract with the Oakland Athletics, that included 
a vesting option for 2015.[7] His numbers dropped off from the year before, 
as he hit just .207 with 2 home runs and 14 RBIs in 198 at-bats. Punto's 
option for the 2015 season vested[8] but the Athletics released him on 
December 19, 2014.[9] On January 7, 2015, Punto signed a minor league contract 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks that included an invitation to spring training.[10][11] 
However, on February 20, Punto informed the Diamondbacks that he would 
not be reporting to spring training and would be taking the year off from
