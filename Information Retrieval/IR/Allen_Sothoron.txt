As player As manager Allen[1] Sutton Sothoron (April 27, 1893 – June 17, 
1939) was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager. 
As a player, he was a spitball pitcher who spent 11 years in the Major 
Leagues playing for the St. Louis Browns, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians 
and the St. Louis Cardinals. Born in Bradford, Ohio, Sothoron threw -handed5 feet 
11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 182 pounds (83 kg). He attended Albright 
College and Juniata College. Sothoron broke into the Major Leagues when 
the spitball was still legal. His best season came in 1919, when he posted 
a 20–13 record with a 2.20 earned run average for the Browns, finishing 
fifth in the American League in wins and ERA. After the spitball was outlawed 
following the 1919 campaign, Sothoron at first was not permitted to throw 
the spitter, then in mid-1920 he was added to a list of 17 spitballers 
in the Majors who were allowed to continue using the banned pitch.[1] But 
he was never able to match his 1919 numbers. His pitching career ended 
in St. Louis with the National League Cardinals, where he played for his 
first MLB manager, Branch Rickey, and led the NL in shutouts with four 
in 1924, despite a medicocre 10–16 (3.57) record. During his MLB career, 
he appeared in 264 games pitched, and allowed 1,583 hits and 596 bases 
on balls in 1,582⅓ innings pitched. He struck out 576 and hurled 102 complete 
games. In 1921, sportswriter Bugs Baer came up with this immortal quip: 
"Allen S. Sothoron pitched his initials off yesterday."[2] After his playing 
days, he managed in minor league baseball, coached for the Cardinals (1927), 
Boston Braves (1928), and Browns (1932–1933), and with the 1933 Browns 
he served a brief, eight-game managerial stint after the dismissal of Bill 
Killefer. He was replaced with hometown favorite Rogers Hornsby. Sothoron 
(whose first name is sometimes spelled "Allan" but whose personal documents 
show his preference for "Allen")[1] died in St. Louis at age 46 in the 
middle of the 1939 season after a series of illnesses. He is interred at
