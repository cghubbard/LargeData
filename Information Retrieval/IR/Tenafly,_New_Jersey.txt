Tenafly /ˈtɛnəflaɪ/ is a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. 
As of the 2010 census, the borough's population was 14,488,[9][10][11] 
reflecting an increase of 682 (+4.9%) from the 13,806 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 480 (+3.6%) from the 13,326 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[20] Tenafly is a suburb of New York City. The first 
European settlers in Tenafly were Dutch immigrants, who began to populate 
the area during the late 17th century. The name "Tenafly" itself is derived 
from the early-modern Dutch phrase "Tiene Vly" or "Ten Swamps" which was 
given by Dutch settlers in 1688.[21][22] Other derivations cite a Dutch 
language connection to its location on a meadow.[23][24] Tenafly was incorporated 
as a borough on January 24, 1894, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature 
from portions of the now-defunct Palisades Township, based on the results 
of a referendum held the previous day.[25][26] The borough was the first 
formed during the "Boroughitis" phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen 
County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone.[27] 
Portions of Palisades Township were acquired based on legislation approved 
on April 8, 1897.[25][28] New Jersey Monthly magazine ranked Tenafly as 
the 7th best place to live in New Jersey in its 2013 rankings of the "Best 
Places To Live" in New Jersey.[29] According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the borough had a total area of 5.184 square miles (13.428 km2), 
including 4.601 square miles (11.917 km2) of land and 0.583 square miles 
(1.510 km2) of water (11.25%).[1][2] The borough borders Alpine, Bergenfield, 
Cresskill, Englewood and Englewood Cliffs, and The Bronx in New York City, 
across the Hudson River.[30] Tenafly's street plan and overall development 
were largely determined by its hills and valleys. The eastern part of the 
borough is referred to as the "East Hill" for its higher elevation in relation 
to the rest of the borough. There, the terrain rises dramatically to the 
east of the downtown area, terminating at the New Jersey Palisades, overlooking 
the Hudson River. Nearby is the Tenafly Nature Center, located at 313 Hudson 
Avenue. At the 2010 United States Census, there were 14,488 people, 4,766 
households, and 3,956 families residing in the borough. The population

granted by the New Jersey Legislature. This charter retains most aspects 
of the Borough form of government, with the addition of initiative, referendum, 
and recall features.[43][44] The governing body consists of a Mayor and 
a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected 
at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. 
A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office, 
and is eligible for re-election. The Borough Council consists of six members 
elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats 
coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[7] As the legislative 
body, the Borough Council adopts ordinances and resolutions, decides on 
appropriations, approves appointments made by the Mayor, determines policy, 
and establishes the functions of the various departments of the local government. 
Each Council member is chairperson of one of six standing committees. The 
Mayor presides over Council meetings, but only votes in case of a tie, 
and can cast a veto which can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the 
Council.[3] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Tenafly is Independent Peter 
Rustin, whose term of office ends December 31, 2019. Members of the Tenafly 
Borough Council are Council President Mark Zinna (D, 2017), Anthony Barzelatto 
(D, 2018), Maxim Basch (D, 2016), Shama Haider (D, 2018), Daniel Park (D, 
2016) and Paul Stefanowicz (D, 2017).[3][45][46][47][48][49] Tenafly is 
located in the 9th Congressional District[50] and is part of New Jersey's 
37th state legislative district.[10][51][52] Prior to the 2010 Census, 
Tenafly had been part of the 5th Congressional District, a change made 
by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 
2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[53] 
New Jersey's Ninth Congressional District is represented by Bill Pascrell 
(D, Paterson).[54] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate 
by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[55] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 
2019).[56][57] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 
37th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented 
in the State Senate by Loretta Weinberg (D, Teaneck) and in the General 
Assembly by Valerie Huttle (D, Englewood) and Gordon M. Johnson (D, Englewood).[58] 
The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[59] 
The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[60]

legislative functions performed by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders.[61] 
As of 2015[update], the County Executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus; 
term ends December 31, 2018).[62] The seven freeholders are elected at-large 
in partisan elections on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming 
up for election each year, with a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chairman 
Pro Tempore selected from among its members at a reorganization meeting 
held each January.[63] Bergen County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chairwoman

had an enrollment of 3,605 students and 282.2 classroom teachers (on an 
FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.77:1.[87] Schools in the 
district (with 2011-12 enrollment data from the National Center for Education 
Statistics)[88] are four elementary schools — Malcolm S. Mackay Elementary 
School[89] (387 students; in grades K-5), Ralph S. Maugham Elementary School[90] 
(384; K-5), J. Spencer Smith Elementary School[91] (365; K-5) and Walter

(844) for grades 6-8 and Tenafly High School[94] (1,231) for grades 9-12.[95] 
Students from Alpine attend Tenafly High School as part of a sending/receiving 
relationship.[96] The United States Department of Education awarded Tenafly 
High School the National Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence at a special 
assembly to the Tenafly High School community on September 20, 2005. Tenafly 
was the only high school in New Jersey and one of 38 public high schools 
in the U.S. to receive the 2005 Blue Ribbon School Award.[97] The school 
was the third-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 328 schools 
statewide in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2012 cover story on 
the state's "Top Public High Schools", after also being ranked third in 
2010 out of 322 schools listed.[98] Schooldigger.com ranked the school 
as tied for 26th out of 376 public high schools statewide in its 2010 rankings 
(unchanged from the 2009 rank) which were based on the combined percentage 
of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the language 
arts literacy and mathematics components of the High School Proficiency 
Assessment (HSPA).[99] Public school students from the borough, and all 
of Bergen County, are eligible to attend the secondary education programs 
offered by the Bergen County Technical Schools, which include the Bergen 
County Academies in Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro 
or Paramus. The district offers programs on a shared-time or full-time 
basis, with admission based on a selective application process and tuition 
covered by the student's home school district.[100][101] Academy of Our 
Lady of Mount Carmel, which operates under the supervision of the Roman 
Catholic Archdiocese of Newark,[102] was recognized in 2012 by the National 
Blue Ribbon Schools Program of the United States Department of Education, 
one of 15 private and public schools in the state to be honored that year.[103] 
As of May 2010[update], the borough had a total of 64.55 miles (103.88 km) 
of roadways, of which 54.71 miles (88.05 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
6.85 miles (11.02 km) by Bergen County, 1.50 miles (2.41 km) by the New 
Jersey Department of Transportation and 1.49 miles (2.40 km) by the Palisades 
Interstate Park Commission.[104] County Route 501, U.S. Route 9W and the 
Palisades Interstate Parkway all pass through Tenafly. The Palisades Interstate 
Parkway runs above the Hudson River from Englewood Cliffs north towards 
Alpine.[105] There are no exits on the parkway in Tenafly; the nearest 
interchanges are Exit 1 in Englewood Cliffs to the south, and Exit 2 in 
Alpine in the north.[106] U.S. Route 9W adjoins and runs parallel to the 
Palisades Interstate Parkway.[107] Local and express bus service to and 
from New York City is available via NJ Transit bus route 166 to and from 
the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.[108][109] Rockland 
Coaches provides service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Route 14ET 
from Montvale, the 9/9A/9T/9TA from Stony Point, New York and the 20/20T 
routes from West Nyack, New York.[110][111] Saddle River Tours/Ameribus 
offers service on the 20/84 routes to the George Washington Bridge Bus 
Station.[112] From the mid 1850s until September 1966, Tenafly was served 
by rail along the Northern Branch, originally to Pavonia Terminal, and 
later to Hoboken Terminal. CSX now provides freight service along the line. 
The former Tenafly Station, currently a restaurant, was added to the National 
Register of Historic Places in 1979; it is one of four surviving stations 
on the Northern Branch.[113] The Northern Branch Corridor Project, a proposal 
by New Jersey Transit to extend the Hudson Bergen Light Rail for nine stops 
and 11 miles (18 km) northward from its current terminus in North Bergen 
to two stations in Tenafly, the last of which would be a new terminus near 
the Cresskill town line, met with mixed reactions.[114][115] Many residents 
and officials believed that the negative impact on the borough in terms 
of traffic and noise outweighed the benefits.[114][116] In November 2010, 
voters rejected the plan to re-establish rail service to the town by a 
nearly 2-1 ratio in a non-binding referendum, with all of the borough council 
candidates opposing the restoration of commuter train service.[117] There 
is continued resistance to New Jersey Transit's preferred alternative as 
described in the plan's December 2011 announcement.[118] Despite local 
opposition, officials in Bergen County asked the North Jersey Transportation 
Planning Authority to support the proposal.[119] In 2013, New Jersey Transit 
announced that the line would end in Englewood, after Tenafly officials 
estimated that as much in $8 million in commercial property valuation would 
be lost and residents raised strong objections.[120] Historic locations 
in Tenafly include:[121] People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise
