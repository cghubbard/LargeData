The Columbus Blue Birds were a professional baseball team based in Columbus, 
Ohio in 1933. Their name appears to have been derived from that of the 
Columbus Red Birds, the top-level minor league baseball team that played 
in the American Association from 1931 through 1954. The Blue Birds, which 
was one of the five founder members of the second incarnation of the Negro 
National League, was organized under the ownership of WJ Peebles of Columbus. 
Peebles was reported to have built up "a formidable aggregation" and one 
that was fast growing in favor in the capital city.[2] Several players, 
who formerly wore the colors of the Homestead Grays and Kansas City Monarchs 
had been added to the Birds' roster for their first season.[2] Columbus 
started the season well, but proved too weak and finished the first half 
of the split season in last place of the six team league with a record 
of 11-18. The team was disbanded and ended up merging with the Akron Tyrites, 
one of the top independent Negro league teams of their day.[3] The merged 
team more or less became the Cleveland Giants, which finished the season.[4] 
Batting champion Leroy Morney and slugger Jabbo Andrews were the top stars.
