Anthony Darrell Womack (born September 25, 1969) is a former professional 
baseball player. He played all or part of thirteen seasons in Major League 
Baseball, with most of his career spent with the Pittsburgh Pirates and 
the Arizona Diamondbacks, then with several other teams during his last 
four years. A middle infielder, Womack was recognized for his speed and 
base-stealing prowess and his key hits in the 2001 playoffs which led to 
the 2001 World Series win over the New York Yankees. Womack was born in 
Java, Virginia. He is a graduate of Gretna High School in Gretna, Virginia 
and Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina.[1] Womack was drafted 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1991 and became their everyday second baseman 
in 1997. That year, which was his first full year in the majors, he played 
in his only All-Star Game and led the National League in stolen bases (60). 
In 1998, he again led the National League in stolen bases (58). After the 
1998 season, he was traded to the Diamondbacks for two minor leaguers. 
The Diamondbacks moved Womack from second base to right field in 1999, 
then to shortstop in 2000. In 1999, Womack led the major leagues in stolen 
bases (72) which set a Diamondback record for most stolen bases in a season. 
Womack was an important part of the Arizona Diamondbacks' World Championship 
Team in 2001, especially with two key base hits that both came in the bottom 
of the ninth inning of deciding games in the playoffs. Womack ended the 
first-round series with a walk-off single off the Cardinals' Steve Kline. 
Later, Womack set up Luis Gonzalez' famous game-winning single in Game 
7 of the World Series with a game-tying one-out hit against the Yankees' 
Mariano Rivera. Womack's game-tying double was cited by the Wall Street 
Journal as the most significant clutch hit in baseball history.[2] Womack 
owns the Diamondbacks record for most stolen bases in a career (182). Womack 
signed with the Cardinals for 2004,[3] and he was moved back to his original 
position at second base. After recovering from Tommy John surgery and a 
disappointing 2003 season, Womack batted a career-high .307 with five home 
runs, 38 runs batted in, and 26 stolen bases for the Cardinals. After the 
2004 season, Womack chose to sign with the New York Yankees, rather than 
wait for the Cardinals to offer him an extension. Despite turning in a 
productive 2004, Womack struggled with the Yankees in 2005, losing his 
starting second base job to Robinson Can√≥.[4] In 2006, after being released 
by the Reds, the Chicago Cubs signed him to a minor league deal and called 
him up on May 26. Womack was designated for assignment on June 30 and became 
a free agent on July 10. He received a non-roster invitation to spring 
training with the Washington Nationals for the 2007 season, but was released
