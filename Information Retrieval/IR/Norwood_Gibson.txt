Norwood Ringold Gibson [Gibby] (March 11, 1877 – July 7, 1959) was a starting 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Boston 
Americans between 1903 and 1906. Listed at 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m), 165 lb., 
Gibson batted and threw right-handed. A native of Peoria, Illinois, he 
went to college at the University of Notre Dame.[1] After college, he played 
for several minor league baseball teams.[1] During that time he was signed 
by the Cincinnati Reds but never got an opportunity to play an official 
game for the Reds.[1][2] According to Sporting Life magazine, he did pitch 
an exhibition game for the Reds.[2] In 1902 he pitched for the Kansas City 
Blue Stockings, managed by former Boston Beaneaters star pitcher Kid Nichols.[1][2] 
He pitched two no-hitters for the Blue Stockings that season.[2] After 
the season, apparently on Nichols' recommendation, Gibson was signed to 
a Major League contract by the Americans for $3000.[2] During his rookie 
1903 season, Gibson was the fourth man of a Boston rotation that included 
Cy Young, Bill Dinneen, Long Tom Hughes, George Winter and Nick Altrock. 
He responded with a 13–9 mark, 76 strikeouts, and a 3.19 in 183⅓ innings 
pitched. He thus won a World Series ring as a member of the Americans that 
won the first World Series that season, although Gibson did not play as 
Collins used only three pitchers, Young, Dineen and Hughes, for the entire 
series.[2] His second season was much better, when he recorded 17 wins, 
112 strikeouts, a 2.21 ERA and 273.0 innings, all career-highs, as his 
.592 winning percentage ranked him seventh between American League pitchers. 
The next two years, his playing time was limited by arm injuries. He retired 
after the 1906 season. In a four-season career, Gibson posted a 34–32 record 
with 258 strikeouts and a 2.93 ERA in 85 appearances, including 72 starts, 
56 complete games, three shutouts, 12 games finished, and 609.0 innings 
of work. Gibson died in his homeland of Peoria, Illinois, at the age of
