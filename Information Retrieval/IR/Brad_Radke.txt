Brad William Radke (born October 27, 1972) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed pitcher who played his entire 12 season career with the Minnesota 
Twins. Radke won 148 career games and was one of the most consistent pitchers 
in the Twins organization during the late 1990s. He officially announced 
his retirement from baseball on December 19, 2006. Radke was born in Eau 
Claire, Wisconsin and graduated from Jesuit High School of Tampa where 
he was known as a scholar-athlete. Radke was not considered a top prospect 
before being drafted in the 8th round of the 1991 amateur draft by the 
Twins. Once he was in the majors though, he was valued highly and the Twins 
were offered a large amount of talent for him, but they never gave him 
up. In his debut season (1995), he finished 11-14 with a 5.32 ERA. In 1997, 
he finished an excellent season with a 20-10 record and a 3.87 ERA in 239 
innings. During the year, he won 12 consecutive games in 12 consecutive 
starts, becoming only the 3rd player since 1950 (along with Bob Gibson 
and Pat Dobson) to accomplish the feat.[1] From 1998-2001, Radke averaged 
12 wins a year and 32 starts each season. He pitched over 210 innings a 
season for the Twins. In 2002, for the first time in his big league career, 
he failed to pitch in 30 games and fell one win short from finishing with 
10 wins for the eight straight season. His ERA for the first time since 
his rookie season in 1995 was over 4.50, finishing with a 4.72 ERA. In 
2003 and 2004, Radke came back to form, notching 14 and 11 wins in each 
season. He was known for being one of the best control pitchers of the 
modern era, walking an average of only 41 batters a year, in an average 
of 34 games a year. He was, however, also known for giving up home runs, 
yielding as many as 40 in a single season, and he was often plagued by 
first-inning troubles. This had the effect of making his ERA totals sometimes 
seem deceptively high,[citation needed] as his first-inning ERA was sometimes 
more than a full run higher than his ERA's for the rest of the game. His 
susceptibility to home runs was lampooned in a commercial for 1995's Sega 
Sports World Series Baseball II, and featured Radke watching as home runs 
sailed out of the park.[2] Radke had hinted that he might retire following 
the 2006 season, citing a torn labrum (through which he had been pitching 
the 2006 season). A stress fracture in his shoulder suffered in late August 
sidelined him as of September 2. On September 12, he threw catch from a 
distance of 110 feet (slightly less than twice the distance from the pitcher's 
mound to home plate) without pain, an important step in the way to his 
return for the last week or two of the season and the Twins' playoff drive, 
and even more important with Francisco Liriano's season appearing to be 
over with the reappearance of pain in his left elbow on September 13. On 
September 28, Radke returned to action, pitching five innings and surrendering 
one unearned run, earning no decision in a 2-1 Twins victory over the Kansas 
City Royals. It was Radke's last regular season start. He finished the 
season with a 12-9 record in 28 starts. In his last major league appearance, 
he pitched in the third game of the division series against the Oakland 
Athletics, giving up four runs on two two-run home runs in four innings. 
On July 11, 2009, Radke was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame. 
On April 12, 2010, Radke was selected to raise one of the Twins pennant 
flags in left field at Target Field. [3] Being in the AL, interleague play 
forced him to bat 29 times. He had 3 hits, a .130 batting average. He had 
0 walks, but 5 sacrifice hits.[4] Radke made his first of back-to-back-to-back 
postseason appearances in 2002. His postseason totals are very solid with 
an overall 3.19 ERA in 31 innings pitched. His best postseason series was 
his first, against Oakland. He started 2 games out of the 5, winning both 
with a 1.54 ERA. Radke only gave up 1 run in the deciding game of the series 
before the 5-1 Twins lead was almost squandered in the 9th, when Eddie 
Guardado gave up 3 runs. But the Twins won 5-4 and advanced to the 2002 
American League Championship Series. He would go on to lose the only game 
he pitched against the Angels, but shut them out for the first 6 innings 
of that game. In the end, the Twins bullpen and offense failed and they 
lost 7-1 and lost the series 4-1. He was 2-3 overall in the postseason.
