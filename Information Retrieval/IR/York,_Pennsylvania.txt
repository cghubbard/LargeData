York (Deitsch: Yarrick), known as the White Rose City (after the symbol 
of the House of York), is the city serving as the county seat of York County, 
Pennsylvania, United States, both being located in the south-central region 
of the state. The population within York's city limits was 43,718 at the 
2010 census, a 7.0% increase from the 2000 count of 40,862. When combined 
with the adjacent boroughs of West York and North York and surrounding 
Spring Garden, West Manchester, and Springettsbury townships, the population 
of Greater York was 108,386. York is the county seat of York County[1] 
and is located at 39°58′00″N 76°45′00″W﻿ / ﻿39.96667°N 76.75000°W﻿ / 39.96667; 
-76.75000. York is currently the 11th largest city in Pennsylvania.[2] 
The city has been called an "architectural museum,"[3] because the downtown 
features numerous well-preserved historic structures, such as the 1741 
Golden Plough Tavern,[4] the 1751 General Horatio Gates House,[5] the 1766 
York Meetinghouse,[6] the 1863 Billmeyer House,[7] the 1888 York Central 
Market,[8] and the 1907 Moorish Revival Temple Beth Israel. Other notable 
buildings are the Laurel-Rex Fire Company House, Forry House, Farmers Market, 
Barnett Bobb House, Cookes House, United Cigar Manufacturing Company building, 
Stevens School, York Dispatch Newspaper Offices, and York Armory.[9] The 
city is home to four national historic districts: Fairmount Historic District, 
Northwest York Historic District, Springdale Historic District, and York 
Historic District.[9] York, also known as Yorktown in the mid 18th to early 
19th centuries, was founded in 1741 by settlers from the Philadelphia region 
and named for the English city of the same name. By 1777, most of the area 
residents were of either German or Scots-Irish descent.[10] York was incorporated 
as a borough on September 24, 1787, and as a city on January 11, 1887. 
During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), York served as the temporary 
capital of the Continental Congress. The Articles of Confederation were 
drafted and adopted in York, though they were not ratified until March 
1781. York styles itself the first Capital of the United States, although 
historians generally consider it to be the fourth capital, after Philadelphia, 
Baltimore and Lancaster.[11] The claim arises from the assertion that the 
Articles of Confederation was the first legal document to refer to the 
colonies as "the United States of America".[12] The argument depends on 
whether the Declaration of Independence, which also uses the term, would 
be considered a true legal document of the United States, being drafted 
under and in opposition to British rule. This does not, however, prevent 
modern businesses and organizations in the York area, such as the First 
Capital Dispensing Co., First Capital Engineering and First Capital Federal 
Credit Union from using the name. The Conway Cabal, a political intrigue 
against General George Washington, had its origins in the Golden Plough 
Tavern in York.[13] According to U.S. census reports from 1800 through 
1840, York ranked within the nation's top 100 most populous urban areas. 
During the American Civil War (1861–1865), York became the largest Northern 
town to be occupied by the Confederate army when the division of Major 
General Jubal Anderson Early spent June 28–30, 1863, in and around the 
town while the brigade of John B. Gordon marched to the Susquehanna River 
at Wrightsville and back. Early laid York under tribute and collected food, 
supplies, clothing, shoes, and $28,000 in cash from citizens and merchants 
before departing westward obeying the revised orders of Robert E. Lee. 
The sprawling York U.S. Army Hospital on Penn Commons served thousands 
of Union soldiers wounded at the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg.[14] 
In the Postbellum era (1865–1877), York remained a regional center for 
local agriculture, but increasingly became an important industrial center, 
with such industries as steam engines, railroad manufacturing, and papermaking 
coming to the forefront. York also features some unique architecture ranging 
from colonial era buildings to large gothic churches. The York Motor Car 
Co. built Pullman automobiles on North George St. from 1905 thorough 1917. 
An early and unique six-wheeled prototype was involved in one of the city's 
first known automobile accidents.[15] Another model was driven to San Francisco 
and back over about one month to prove its reliability several years before 
the creation of the Lincoln Highway which ran through town, connecting 
New York and San Francisco. The York area had also been home for more than 
100 years to the Pfaltzgraff company, which built its first pottery factory 
in the area in 1895 and continued manufacturing in York until 2005.[16] 
Though now produced by The Hershey Company, the York Peppermint Pattie 
was created in York in 1940.[17] Throughout the middle 20th Century, the 
black residents of the city were subject to hostile racial prejudice and 
social injustices.[18] Between 1955 and 1970, the people of York experienced 
racial discrimination leading to riots, most notably the 1969 York Race 
Riot, which resulted in the death of Lily Allen and Henry C. Schaad. These 
murders were largely left ignored until 31 years later, when allegations 
of murder and racial prejudice were raised against the mayor at the time, 
Charlie Robertson.[19] Additionally, throughout the entire century, the 
city commonly held unopposed Ku Klux Klan rallies and public meetings, 
despite continuous racial tensions.[20] Though the murders of Allen and 
Schaad were solved and the perpetrators were apprehended, the actions, 
which originate back to the beginnings of the hate group, continue to present 
day.[21] In 2002, the city faced a budget shortfall of $1,000,000. Mayor 
John S. Brenner's plan to raise the money by asking York County's 302,000 
adult residents to donate $3.32 to the city received national attention.[22] 
The plan, referred to by some as the "Big Mac" Plan, did not raise all 
the monies sought. After many years of attempting to secure funding for 
a stadium and a baseball team to play in it, the first decade of the century 
saw York realize both goals. In 2007, Santander Stadium, home of the York 
Revolution, opened in the Arch Street neighborhood. The stadium, along 
with other large projects such as the York County Judicial Center and the 
Codo 241 luxury apartment lofts, symbolizes York's extensive redevelopment 
efforts.[citation needed] York was featured during the 2008 U.S. Presidential 
Election, when National Public Radio's Michele Norris and Steve Inskeep 
chose to showcase the city in "The York Project: Race & the '08 Vote." 
The program was aired as a 7-part series and featured different York citizens 
discussing race relations, racial perceptions, and the emotions inspired 
by the 2008 election. Norris stated that York was chosen due to its central 
location in a battleground state, its rich history (including its strained 
race relations), and demographics.[23] On June 19, 2009, Norris announced 
on the air that she was taking time off to write a book inspired by her 
conversations "with a diverse group of voters" in York,[24] and The Grace 
of Silence: A Memoir was published in September 2010.[25] In 2009, Kim 
Bracey won the Democratic primary and became the favored candidate for 
mayor. She won the general election in November against Republican opponent 
Wendell Banks and took office on the first Monday in 2010 as the city's 
first African-American and second woman mayor.[26] Bracey won reelection 
in November 2013 against Libertarian challenger Dave Moser. York Barbell 
is a reseller of barbells and other equipment for weight training and bodybuilding, 
and is the home of the USA Weightlifting Hall of Fame.[27] A large Harley-Davidson 
motorcycle factory, which employs roughly half of Harley's production workforce, 
is located just northeast of York. York is home to two major manufacturers 
of modern hydro-power water turbines, Voith Hydro[28] and American Hydro,[29] 
both of which manufacture enormous parts in their plants. York is headquarters 
to York International, a Johnson Controls Company and one of the largest 
suppliers of HVAC systems in the United States. On February 2, 1998, a 
massive explosion occurred at the York International plant. A spark had 
set off a leak in the nearby propane storage house. The blast was felt 
up to 25 miles away, and blew out windows nearby as well as knocking down 
doors. About 20 people were injured in the blast but only one person was 
killed, as the explosion fortunately occurred during a shift change.[30][31] 
The Stauffer Biscuit Company (owned by Meiji Seika of Japan since February 
2004) is rooted in York and has produced animal crackers since 1871.[32] 
A major regional department store, The Bon-Ton, is headquartered in York.[33] 
Just north of York is one of only four Starbucks roasting facilities in 
the world.[34] York also boasts a BAE Systems facility which assembles 
various military tanks and equipment.[35] York is also home to dental equipment 
and false teeth giant, Dentsply Sirona. Though originally founded in New 
York by four men, the company moved its headquarters to the site of its 
factory in the 1900s, where it was run by one of the four founders, George 
H. Whiteley. Whiteley was an experienced ceramist who was familiar with 
the process of making artificial teeth. Whiteley was sent by the group 
to oversee the factory and his family presided over the factory for multiple 
generations. Dentsply Sirona is a NASDAQ listed company, and internationally 
known throughout the dentistry business.[36][37][38] York is located at 
39°57′46″N 76°43′41″W﻿ / ﻿39.96278°N 76.72806°W﻿ / 39.96278; -76.72806

the city has a total area of 5.3 square miles (14 km2), of which, 5.2 square 
miles (13 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it (1.14%) 
is water. Like most of Pennsylvania, York has a humid continental climate, 
it is characterized by warm to hot, humid summers and moderately cold winters. 
The mean annual precipitation total of 41.1 in (1,040 mm) is fairly evenly 
spread throughout the year, and falls on an average of 126.6 days per annum. 
Record temperatures from the York COOP range from 107 °F (42 °C), set on 
July 2, 1901, down to −21 °F (−29 °C), recorded on January 28, 1925 and 
January 21, 1994; at York Airport, with a considerably shorter period of 
record, the range is 100 °F (38 °C), set on July 22, 2011, down to −12 °F

represents the city's evolving role as an agricultural and industrial center. 
The historic York Fair, which claims to be the country's oldest,[49] traces 
its roots to 1765. It runs every year in September for 10 days, encompassing 
an entire week and two weekends. In addition to typical fair attractions, 
such as rides, games and contests, it also wins regional recognition for 
hosting many (usually country) musical artists, such as Alabama, Gretchen 
Wilson, Carrie Underwood, Toby Keith, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.[50][51] [52] 
The fairgrounds, branded the York Expo Center, also hosts the annual National 
Street Rod Association Street Rod Nationals East, the largest annual street 
rod event in the Eastern US.[53] The event brings thousands of street rods 
into the city for a few days in June. On Friday afternoon the city holds 
a parade through the center of the city for participating vehicles. York 
City Recreation and Parks helps sponsor the Olde York Street Fair each 
year on Mothers Day, the second Sunday of May – a tradition since the early 
1980s. In recent years more than 150 art, craft and food vendors have lined 
Market and George streets. Average attendance was 60,000 people as of 2004, 
according to city officials.[54] York is home to the York Little Theatre 
and to the Strand-Capitol Performing Arts Center, which brings many nationally 
acclaimed acts to the York area. Performers here have included Kenny G, 
Bill Cosby,[55] B.B. King,[56] Béla Fleck,[57] and George Carlin.[58] The 
historic Capitol Theatre also features many independent and foreign films, 
making it the only venue in York (and sometimes the entire Susquehanna 
Valley) to feature some rare, yet critically acclaimed films. The Strand 
Studio has also branched out from the recently Renovated Strand-Capitol 
Performing Arts Center. The Studio offers live music, usually jazz & acoustic, 
for the community. The York County History Center (YCHC) is a not-for-profit 
educational institution that preserves and uses its collections, historic 
sites and museums to inspire people to explore the history and culture 
of York County, Pennsylvania. YCHC maintains eight historical sites that 
preserve and present 300 years of York County's rich and diverse history. 
The YCHC was founded in 1999 after a merger of the Historical Society of 
York County and the Agricultural and Industrial Museum of York County (AIM). 
Currently, the YCHC historical sites include the Worker's House (c. 1875), 
Golden Plough Tavern (c.1741), the Barnett Bobb Log House (1812), the Bonham 
House (c.1885) and old Eastern Market House (c.1886). In 1992, AIM acquired 
an industrial complex consisting of six buildings (c.1874 to 1955); three 
of the buildings were renovated and now house the industrial portion of 
the collection. The YCHC hosts a variety of events throughout the year, 
and holds the rights to the Murals of York, PA, a group of murals that 
depict York's rich history. The History Center purchased a former Met-Ed 
steam plant in York in late 2015, and has plans to turn it into a new history 
center. In 2016, what was the York County Heritage Trust rebranded as the 
York County History Center.[citation needed] The York Factory Whistle holds 
the world record for the loudest music without amplification from a non-musical 
instrument.[59] Every Christmas Eve the whistle uses a compressor to create 
air pressure, then releases it through a series of tubes using a device 
much like a slide whistle. (Prior to 2010, the pressure was created using 
steam produced by a boiler.) The music had a loudness of 140 dB and can 
be heard 10 to 12 miles away with proper weather conditions. Various Christmas 
music is played for a short time around midnight. It is thought that this 
annual tradition was started around 1925.[60][61][62] After the hosting 
New York Wire Cloth Company plant closed in 2013, Metso moved the whistle 
to their factory in York and the annual concert tradition has continued.[63] 
Metso announced in August 2015 that it would close its York plant by the 
end of March 2016.[64] Organizers hope to be able to hold the 2016 whistle 
concert at the same location.[65] The alternative rock band Live is from 
York.[66] Many of Live's songs are about the town including "Shit Towne" 
from their most successful album Throwing Copper.[67] York is home to many 
veteran as well as up-and-coming talented artists and musicians from all 
genres including funk, blues, jazz, rock, experimental, country, and bluegrass. 
The rock band Hexbelt is known for its brand of "Susquehanna Hexbelt Swing" 
music.[68] York hosts a variety of open mics and underground venues such 
as the Sign of the Wagon[69] and The Depot.[70] The area's main shopping 
centers are York Galleria and West Manchester Town Center. York and the 
surrounding area are served by the York City, Dallastown, Eastern York, 
West York, Central York, York Suburban, Southern York County, Red Lion, 
Northeastern York, Dover, Spring Grove, and South Eastern public school 
districts. Of the several private Christian schools in the area, the largest 
is York Catholic High School. In 2009 Helen Thackston Middle School opened 
on East Philadelphia Street. The city is home to York College of Pennsylvania, 
which was originally founded in 1787; Penn State York; YTI Career Institute 
(YTI), which offers accredited technology- and business-based degree programs; 
Yorktowne Business Institute (YBI) & School of Culinary Arts, which offers 
accredited degree and diploma programs in the Business, Medical and Culinary 
fields; York Time Institute; HACC's York Campus; and The Art Institute 
of York-Pennsylvania, formerly Bradley Academy for the Visual Arts.[71] 
Other colleges within 35 miles include Elizabethtown College, Penn State 
Harrisburg and Penn State Hershey. The city of York is protected at all 
hours by the 59 professional firefighters and 45 volunteer firefighters 
of the city of York Fire Department (YFD). The YFD operates out of four 
fire stations, located throughout the city, and maintains a fire apparatus 
fleet of 4 engines, 2 trucks, 1 service, and numerous other special, support, 
and reserve units. The YFD responds to approximately 2,700 emergency calls 
annually.[72] The York Revolution plays in the independent Atlantic League 
of Professional Baseball. After 36 years without professional baseball, 
the Revolution arrived in 2007 to fill the void left by the departed York 
White Roses. The Revolution are named after the city's colonial past, when 
the Continental Congress met in York and passed the Articles of Confederation 
during the Revolutionary War. The Revolution continue the old baseball 
rivalry between York and the nearby city of Lancaster.[73] The Revolution 
play at PeoplesBank Park in York's Arch Street neighborhood. The stadium 
features a plaza and statue in honor of MLB Hall of Fame third baseman 
Brooks Robinson, a one-time member of the aforementioned White Roses, with 
whom he made his professional baseball debut in 1955. Robinson currently 
serves as a special assistant and advisor to Opening Day Partners, the 
group largely responsible for bringing professional baseball back to York. 
PeoplesBank Park has the distinction of having the tallest wall in baseball. 
At 37 feet, 8 inches, the left field wall of York's ballpark surpasses 
the height of the Green Monster at Fenway Park, the home of the Boston 
Red Sox. The people of York (the White Rose City) and the similar city 
of Lancaster (the Red Rose City) across the Susquehanna River often engage 
in rivalry and competition that has its roots in the Wars of the Roses. 
Both cities take their names from the English cities, York and Lancaster, 
from which the opposing royal houses took their names in the 15th-century 
wars. The War of the Roses All-Star Game is played in York every year over 
the weekend of Thanksgiving. The game pits the best high school football 
players in their senior seasons from the York-Adams League against a similar 
team from the Lancaster-Lebanon League. As the game only involves seniors 
and occurs during the first weekend of the PIAA District 3 football playoffs 
(players on teams which qualify for the playoffs do not participate), it 
is the final high school football game for each of the participants. Former 
Minnesota Vikings, Atlanta Falcons, and San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman 
Chris Doleman graduated from York's William Penn High School.[74] York 
was the birthplace of former New York Giants Linebacker Andre Powell,[75] 
former Miami Dolphins Running Back Woodrow (Woody) Bennett,[76] former 
Los Angeles Raiders and Atlanta Falcons Tackle/Guard Lincoln Kennedy[77][78] 
and former Atlanta Falcons Safety Omar Brown.[74] Arizona Cardinals Head 
Coach, Bruce Arians, is also a graduate of William Penn Senior High School 
(1970).[79][80] New York Giants Offensive Tackle William Beatty is also 
a York, Pennsylvania native. The York Capitals were founded in 2012 and 
began play with the American Indoor Football league in April 2013.[81] 
The team moved to Harrisburg after the 2015 season and was renamed the 
Central Penn Capitals. The Bob Hoffman Auditorium at York Barbell hosts 
a variety of powerlifting, Olympic lifting, strongman and bodybuilding 
competitions and shows.[82] York is home to the "Plywood Hoods", a group 
of BMX freestylers, including Kevin Jones, who gained broad acclaim in 
the 1980s and 1990s.[83][84] York is also the home of the York County Silver 
Bullets semiprofessional football team (Colonial Football Alliance). In 
their 2006 inaugural season they had a record of 5–5, and gained a playoff 
berth, though lost in the first round.[85] "The Pogo Squad", a group of 
about twelve extreme pogo performers, is located in York. They participate 
in area events, including the York St. Patrick's Day Parade,[86] and perform 
shows.[87] A photo of one member's pogo stunt against a sunset background 
won first place out of over 800 entries in a 2007 York newspaper photo 
contest.[88] York was home to the Thunder D'ohm Skateboard Park, now defunct. 
There has been a new park built entitled "Reid Menzer Memorial Skatepark", 
named for a York Catholic High School student who was killed riding a skateboard 
like a streetluge.[89] York US30 was a drag strip just outside York. It 
held the 1965 Super Stock championships – "the largest one day drag race" 
in the United States. An annual Musclecar Madness event is held in York 
to commemorate the defunct strip.[90] York is unusual in that it supports 
two daily newspapers, despite its relatively small size. The York Daily 
Record/Sunday News is published mornings, seven days a week, and The York 
Dispatch is published Monday through Friday afternoons. The Daily Record/Sunday 
News currently has the lead in terms of circulations of the daily newspapers. 
The York area is part of the Susquehanna Valley (Harrisburg/Lancaster/Lebanon/York) 
media market. Of the major television network affiliates in this media 
market, only one, the Fox affiliate WPMT, has its base of operations in 
York. Other stations in the market include NBC affiliate WGAL, ABC affiliate 
WHTM-TV, CBS/MyNetworkTV/CW affiliate WHP-TV, Grit affiliate WXBU, and 
PBS member station WITF-TV, all of which are from Harrisburg except WGAL 
which is from Lancaster. It is also not uncommon for York residents to 
receive some stations from the Baltimore, Maryland media market, due to 
its proximity to the south of York. York has a Public, educational, and 
government access (PEG) cable TV station called WRCT (White Rose Community 
Television) wrct.tv[91] which used to be YCAT (York Community Access Television).[92][93] 
The pop music radio station, WSBA AM 910, achieved high ratings in not 
only York, but also in nearby Harrisburg and Lancaster, during the 1960s 
and 1970s. WSBA, now a news-talk station, was well known for being the 
flagship station of Susquehanna Broadcasting, which had its corporate offices 
in York, as well.[94] Other radio stations in York include WVYC from York 
College, WARM FM, WQXA FM, and WOYK. FM stations in the greater York, Pennsylvania 
metropolitan area include: York is officially twinned[95] with: York is 
served, through public transportation, by Rabbit Transit, which operates 
multiple bus routes in the city and the surrounding suburbs. In 2006 a 
rabbitEXPRESS bus route was established to transport commuters to Harrisburg 
and back, making six round trips weekdays.[96] Rabbit Transit introduced 
a new route on February 2, 2009 that provides three daily round trips between 
York and Timonium, Maryland.[97][98] The $5 fare each way covers 80% of 
the operating costs.[99] In addition to Rabbit Transit the city has a Greyhound/Trailways 
bus depot where service through Harrisburg to Syracuse, or to Baltimore 
and Washington, D.C. is provided by Greyhound Lines. Service through Lancaster 
to Philadelphia and New York City is provided by Capitol Trailways.[100] 
Service to New York is provided by Bieber Tourways.[101] Rail enthusiasts 
have suggested commuter rail service could be started between York and 
Philadelphia with much of the necessary infrastructure already in place, 
using SEPTA's system. Transportation planners say this is too expensive, 
with bus and van services more feasible.[102] The former Pennsylvania Railroad 
station for York now lies along the York County Heritage Rail Trail across 
from the baseball park. York does not have any commercial airports, though 
the small York Airport (THV) is located 7 miles southwest in Thomasville. 
Many residents use either Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) or Harrisburg 
International Airport (MDT). Lancaster, 24 miles to the east, has frequent 
Amtrak train service to Philadelphia. York is the hometown of the protagonist 
of John Grisham's novel " The Associate". At the book's end the protagonist 
happily abandons a well-paid but highly unpleasant job in a giant Wall 
Street law firm, returning to his hometown to work there with his lawyer
