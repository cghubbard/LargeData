The City Series was the name of a series of baseball games played between 
Major League Baseball's Philadelphia Athletics of the American League and 
Philadelphia Phillies of the National League that ran from 1903 through 
1955. After the A's move to Kansas City in 1955, the City Series rivalry 
came to an end. The teams have since faced each other in Interleague play 
(since its introduction in 1997) but the rivalry has effectively died in 
the intervening years since the A's left Philadelphia. The first City Series 
was held in 1883 between the Phillies and American Association Philadelphia 
Athletics.[1] When the Athletics first joined the American League, the 
two teams played each other in a spring and fall series. No City Series 
was held in 1901 and 1902 due to legal warring between the NL and AL. The 
rivalry started almost immediately at the establishment of the American 
League in 1901. Superstar Nap Lajoie had played for several years on the 
Phillies, but was displeased with the salary cap of $2,400 placed by the 
National League. So when the Athletics were established, Lajoie quit the 
Phillies and signed with the A's. In response, the Phillies filed an injunction 
lawsuit preventing Lajoie from playing on any other team, but the case 
was ruled that Lajoie was only barred from playing in Pennsylvania. Due 
to the lawsuit, Lajoie was sent to the Cleveland Bluebirds due to the financial 
assistance Cleveland had provided for the A's early on. In 1903, the injunction 
was dropped when the NL and AL made peace. Lajoie went on to have an outstanding 
Hall of Fame career. Eventually, he did return to the A's at the twilight 
of his career. The first City Series game was played on April 9, 1903 at 
Baker Bowl. The Phillies won 6-5 in ten innings.[2] The Phillies and A's 
played both a spring and fall series in 1903. The Phillies took four of 
five games in the spring. With Baker Bowl in disrepair following the collapse 
of a section of bleachers on August 8, 1903, all of the post-season games 
were played at Columbia Park. The A's won four of the seven games.[3] In 
1905, the A's and Phillies only played the spring series as the A's were 
in the 1905 World Series against the New York Giants. The two teams played 
eight games between April 1 and April 12, 1905, alternating games between 
the A's Columbia Park and the Phillies' Philadelphia Park. The teams split 
the 1905 series four games to four.[4] Seven games were scheduled for April 
1909. Shibe Park was being completed for its grand-opening so the Phils 
and A's played the entire series at the Phillies' Baker Bowl. The teams 
played six games with the Phillies winning five.[5] Phillies Hall of Fame 
pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander made his Philadelphia debut during the 
pre-season 1911 Series. Alexander pitched five-innings of no-hit no-run 
baseball. He would make his official Major League debut on April 15, 1911.[6] 
The Athletics entered the 1913 preseason City Series riding a 19-game exhibition 
season winning streak. The A's and Phillies had six games scheduled prior 
to Opening Day 1913. The A's won the first four, game five went 18-innings 
and ended tied 2-2, and the Athletics won the sixth game to run their streak 
to 23 wins before starting the season.[7] The Phillies left Baker Bowl 
after the 1938 season with a 30-38-1 record in City Series games at Baker 
Bowl against the A's.[2] The 1950 series was planned for three games prior 
to Opening Day. Snow flurries and cold weather caused the cancellation 
of the first game. The Athletics beat the Phillies 7-4 in the first game 
and the Phillies won the following game 11-2.[8] The Athletics moved to 
Kansas City prior to the 1955 season. The A's, now based in Kansas City, 
traveled to Philadelphia at the end of spring training to play the pre-season 
exhibitions against the Phillies. The A's beat the Phillies in the second 
game, 10-2, at Wilmington Park, home of the original Wilmington Blue Rocks.[9] 
The Athletics continued to hold spring training in Florida through 1968 
in West Palm Beach and then Bradenton. The Phillies and A's continued to 
face each other in spring training until the A's moved their spring training 
to Mesa in 1969.[10] The Athletics played the Phillies for the first time 
in interleague play in June 2003 at Veterans Stadium. The Phillies invited 
former A's Eddie Joost and Gus Zernial to the games. Connie Mack's daughter 
Ruth Mack Clark attended the first game. Former Florida U.S. Senator Connie 
Mack III, Mack's grandson, threw out the first ball.[11] The Phillies played 
the Athletics in Oakland in June 2005. The A's invited Eddie Joost to throw 
out the first pitch before the series opening game on June 17, 2005.[12] 
In 2011 the Athletics visited the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park for an
