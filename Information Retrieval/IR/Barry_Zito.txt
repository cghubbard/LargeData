Barry William Zito (born May 13, 1978) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 
the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants. His pitching repertoire 
consisted of a curveball (his strikeout pitch), a four-seam fastball, a 
two-seam fastball, a circle changeup, and a cutter–slider. Zito attended 
the University of California, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles Pierce College, 
and the University of Southern California. Drafted three times while in 
college, Zito signed with the Athletics when they chose him in the first 
round of the 1999 MLB draft. A year later, he was in the major leagues, 
finishing fifth in American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. He struggled 
to begin the 2001 season but improved greatly down the stretch, finishing 
the year with an 11–1 win–loss record over his final two months. He won 
23 games (while only losing five) in 2002 and won the Cy Young Award. His 
record was only 14–12 in 2003, but he still made the All-Star team for 
the second year in a row. In 2004, he had his worst season at the time, 
going 11–11 with a career-high 4.48 earned run average. He became Oakland's 
Opening Day starter in 2005 and finished fifth in the AL with 171 strikeouts. 
In 2006, he made the All-Star team and posted a 15–1 record when receiving 
two or more runs of support. Following his seventh season with the Athletics, 
Zito signed a seven-year deal with the Giants in December 2006. At the 
time, it was the largest contract ever given to a pitcher. He posted double-digit 
wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win 
their first championship since 1954. However, he struggled the last month 
of the season and he was left off the postseason roster. After sitting 
out much of the 2011 season with a foot and ankle injury, he came back 
in 2012 and flourished, finishing with a 15–8 record, his best season in 
a Giants uniform. The same October, Zito helped lead the Giants to their 
second World Series title in San Francisco history by going 2–0 with a 
1.69 ERA in three postseason starts. In his first career World Series start, 
he outdueled Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1, setting the stage 
for San Francisco's sweep to their seventh World Series title in franchise 
history. Zito struggled in 2013 but received a standing ovation from the 
fans in his final appearance as a Giant. Following the year, he became 
a free agent. Zito, a philanthropist, founded Strikeouts For Troops, a 
national non-profit that provides comforts of home and lifts the spirits 
and morale of injured troops as well as offering support to military families. 
Zito was born May 13, 1978, in Las Vegas, Nevada. His family moved to San 
Diego, California, to help him concentrate on his baseball career. His 
father even stopped working to coach him.[1] He transferred from El Cajon's 
Grossmont High School to University of San Diego High School, a Roman Catholic 
school.[2][3] Zito then attended UC Santa Barbara where he earned Freshman 
All-America Honors with 125 strikeouts in 85⅓ innings.[2] In his sophomore 
season, Zito transferred to Los Angeles Pierce College so that he could 
be eligible for the Major League Baseball draft. At Pierce, he posted a 
2.62 earned run average (ERA), went 9–2 with 135 strikeouts in 103 innings, 
and was named to the all-state and all-conference teams.[2][4] He then 
transferred to the University of Southern California (USC), where he was 
a first-team All-America selected by USA Today Baseball Weekly, Collegiate 
Baseball, and Baseball America. With a 12–3 record, a 3.28 ERA, and 154 
strikeouts in 113⅔ innings, Zito was named Pac-10 Pitcher of the Year.[2] 
Zito also played in the Cape Cod Baseball League, a summer wooden bat league 
which showcases the nation's top amateur prospects. He led the Wareham 
Gatemen to the league championship in 1997, and a runner-up finish in 1998.[5][6] 
Zito was taken by the Seattle Mariners in the 59th round (1,586th overall) 
of the 1996 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, and in the third round (83rd 
overall) by the Texas Rangers in 1998, but did not sign with either team.[7] 
In the 1999 draft, he was selected by the Oakland Athletics with the ninth 
pick of the first round, and signed for a $1.59 million bonus.[7][8] In 
1999, Zito began his professional career with the Visalia Oaks, Oakland's 
A team. He went 3–0 with a 2.45 ERA in eight starts. He struck out 62 in 
40⅓ innings.[7] Zito was promoted to the Midland RockHounds, and went 2–1 
with a 4.91 ERA to finish the AA schedule.[7] He then got one start for 
the AAA Vancouver Canadians, allowing a lone run with six strikeouts in 
six innings.[8] Zito began the 2000 season in AAA with the Sacramento River 
Cats (the Canadians franchise had moved to Sacramento). He pitched 101⅔ 
innings in 18 starts, going 8–5 with a 3.19 ERA, 91 strikeouts, and 41 
walks.[8] Zito made his major league debut on July 22, 2000, against the 
Anaheim Angels wearing #53. He allowed one run in five innings, and got 
the win.[9] In his next start, Zito went seven innings while giving up 
three runs to the Boston Red Sox. Zito continued to have great success 
early in his rookie season. In his third career start, he went seven innings 
and gave up one run against the Toronto Blue Jays. On September 10, Zito 
pitched his first complete game shutout against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
He threw 110 pitches, struck out eight, and allowed five hits.[10] During 
the month of September, he went 5–1 with a 1.73 ERA.[11] Zito finished 
with a 7–4 record and a 2.72 earned run average in 14 starts.[2] Despite 
his late start to the season, Zito still finished fifth in American League 
(AL) Rookie of the Year Award voting.[12] Zito made his postseason debut 
in Game 4 of the AL Division Series (ALDS) against the New York Yankees. 
He went 5.2 innings, struck out 5, walked 2, and allowed an earned run. 
Zito earned the win, outpitching Roger Clemens.[13] However, the Yankees 
would win the series, 3–2, and would go on to win their third straight 
World Series.[14] In 2001, Zito Switched his Uniform Number to 75 (which 
he would wear throughout the rest of his career) finished third in the 
American League (AL) in strikeouts per nine innings (8.61), fourth in strikeouts 
(205), sixth in wins (17), eighth in ERA (3.49), and tenth in winning percentage 
(.680).[12] Zito became the sixth lefty aged 23 or younger since 1902 to 
strike out at least 200 batters in a season. After a great rookie season, 
Zito struggled through the early part of the 2001 season, posting a 6–7 
record with a 5.01 ERA in his first 22 starts. However, he rebounded nicely 
and by August, he was putting up good pitching numbers. Zito was named 
Pitcher of the Month in August, going 5–1 with a 1.02 ERA. Zito won Pitcher 
of the Month again in September, going 6–0 with a 1.89 ERA. During those 
last two months of the season, Zito went a combined 11–1 with a 1.32 ERA, 
best in baseball.[2][15] The Athletics made the postseason and again played 
the Yankees in the ALDS. Zito pitched in Game 3 against Mike Mussina. He 
went eight innings, striking out six, walking one, and allowing an earned 
run. But Zito took the loss as the Yankees won the game, 1–0.[2] The Yankees 
would end up taking the series, 3–2.[16] In 2002, Zito became one of the 
best pitchers in baseball. On June 22, Zito won his 10th game of the season. 
It was the earliest that an A's pitcher had reached the 10-win mark since 
Bob Welch got there on June 15, 1990. Zito was named to the All-Star team 
for the first time in his career. On July 18, he went 7.1 innings while 
giving up no runs against the Angels. That win gave Zito a team-record 
16th straight win at home. Zito again faced the Angels in his next start 
and produced similar results. He went 6.1 innings and gave up just one 
run. That win gave Zito the most wins by an AL pitcher (14). Zito would 
become the AL's first 15-game winner when he beat the Rangers. On August 
23, Zito recorded his 18th win of the season, giving him one more than 
his previous career high of 17, in a game against the Detroit Tigers.[2] 
On August 28, Zito earned his 19th win of the season against the Kansas 
City Royals. However, he lost his bid for a perfect game in the sixth inning 
when Neifi Pérez singled with one out. Zito gave credit to Pérez. "I wasn't 
pitching to maintain a no-hitter or something", Zito said. "I left the 
ball up over the middle to Pérez, and he hit it up the middle. It was a 
good piece of hitting."[17] On September 8, Zito became the first pitcher 
in the AL to win 20 games when he pitched seven innings and allowed no 
earned runs against the Minnesota Twins. "I'm not pitching for the Cy Young", 
Zito said. "I'm pitching to get the Oakland A's into the playoffs and to 
the World Series."[18] In his next start, against the Seattle Mariners, 
Zito took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before John Olerud singled 
to leadoff the inning. Seattle manager Lou Piniella said if he could vote 
for the Cy Young Award winner, "It would go to that young man who pitched 
for the Oakland team. There are other deserving pitchers, but [Zito] has 
won 21 games and he competes well."[19] In his last start of the season, 
Zito went six innings and allowed just a run against the Texas Rangers. 
In his last 10 starts, Zito went 8–0, boosting his chances of winning the 
AL Cy Young Award. "Barry pitched another gem", said Oakland manager Art 
Howe. "He's certainly had a Cy Young-type season. He's just been steady 
all season long."[20] In Game 3 of the ALDS, Zito went six innings and 
gave up three earned runs against the Twins, earning the win.[2] However, 
the Twins defeated the Athletics in five games, making the Athletics the 
first team to lose the deciding game of a series three years in a row.[21] 
Zito would go on to win the AL Cy Young Award with a 23–5 record, narrowly 
defeating Pedro Martínez in the voting. He led the league with 23 wins, 
was second in winning percentage (.821), and third in both ERA (2.75) and 
strikeouts (182). Zito's 23 wins were the most by an AL left-hander since 
Frank Viola had 24 wins for Minnesota in 1988. Zito also allowed a .185 
average to opposing hitters, the lowest in the AL.[12] Martínez, who'd 
led the AL in ERA (2.26), strikeouts (239), and winning percentage (.833), 
became the first pitcher since the introduction of the award to lead his 
league in each of the three categories and not win the award.[22] Zito 
became the first A's pitcher to win the Cy Young Award since Dennis Eckersley 
did it in 1992. Zito was also named AL TSN Pitcher of the Year.[2] In 2003, 
Zito started off with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and 
allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In 
his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed 
one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher 
to win 10 straight games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito 
went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the 
Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, 
Texas manager Buck Showalter said, "I got the feeling he made it look pretty 
easy. When he has that kind of command, you can see what happens."[23] 
Zito struggled in his second-to last start before the All-Star Break on 
July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. 
The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was 
stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, "If you'd have told me we'd get 15 
hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little 
funny."[24] Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went 
eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. 
Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been 
named to the team.[2] In 2003, Zito was seventh in the AL in ERA (3.30). 
He had a 14–12 record and 146 strikeouts over a career-high 231 2⁄3 innings 
pitched.[12] In Game 2 of the ALDS against the Red Sox, Zito went seven 
innings, striking out nine, walking two, allowing one earned run, and earning 
the win in Oakland's 5–1 triumph. In Game 5, Zito went six innings and 
allowed four earned runs, taking the loss as the Red Sox won the game and 
the series.[25] In 2004, Zito struggled and posted the worst numbers of 
his career at the time. Zito went 2–3 with a 6.83 ERA in the month of April.[26] 
On May 28, facing Cliff Lee, he threw eight shutout innings but received 
a no-decision in a 1–0 loss to the Cleveland Indians.[27] He threw eight 
shutout innings of four-hit ball in a 5–0 victory over the Devil Rays on 
August 21. Oakland manager Ken Macha would have let him throw a complete 
game, but Zito said, "I was worrying about being fresh for the next game. 
I didn't want to end up [throwing] 115–120 [pitches], so I took advantage 
of the situation and shut it down."[28] On September 12, he threw seven 
shutout innings and had 10 strikeouts, earning the win in a 1–0 victory 
over the Indians.[29] For the season, he went 11–11 with a 4.48 ERA. That 
was his only year with the Athletics that his ERA was more than 4.00. He 
still finished 10th in the league in strikeouts with 163.[12] Following 
the departure of Tim Hudson and Mark Mulder, Zito was given his first Opening 
Day assignment in 2005. He allowed four runs over six innings in a 4–0 
loss to the Orioles on April 4.[30] In 2005, Zito again struggled in the 
month of April, going 0–4 with a 6.60 ERA. In his first 16 starts of the 
campaign, he was 3–8 with a 4.41 ERA. However, Zito pitched better the 
rest of the season. He had a streak of 14 consecutive starts from May 17 
through July 25 (and 20 out of 21 through August 30) in which he gave up 
fewer hits than innings pitched. From June 28 through August 4, he earned 
the win in eight consecutive starts.[31] On June 6, Zito allowed two runs 
in six innings in a 2–1 loss to the Washington Nationals. During the game, 
he collected his first major league hit, against Tony Armas, Jr..[32] Zito 
was named Pitcher of the Month in July, going 6–0 with a 2.51 ERA. In 35 
starts, Zito went 14–13 with a 3.86 ERA. Zito's 35 starts were the most 
in Major League Baseball that season, demonstrating his durability as a 
pitcher. He also had 171 strikeouts, good for fifth in the league.[12] 
In 2006, Zito went 1.1 innings and allowed seven earned runs on Opening 
Day (April 3) against the Yankees. It was the shortest outing of his career.[33] 
However, Zito quickly rebounded from that bad start. On June 1, he allowed 
four hits over seven innings in a 4–0 victory over the Twins. During the 
game, he recorded his 1,000th career strikeout by punching out Lew Ford.[34] 
On July 2, Zito and Brandon Webb both allowed one run through eight innings 
before Zito gave up two unearned runs while only getting two outs in the 
ninth; Webb threw a complete game as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the 
Athletics 3–1.[35] When the All-Star Break rolled around, Zito was 8–6 
with a 3.29 earned run average. He was named to the 2006 All-Star Game.[2] 
On August 25, Zito earned his 100th career win when he defeated the Rangers 
9–3. He had a no-hitter going into the eighth inning, but Mark DeRosa singled 
to lead it off.[36] In 35 starts (first in the league again), he had a 
16–10 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 151 strikeouts. Zito was tied for eighth 
in the league in wins, he ranked tenth in ERA, and he was third in innings 
pitched (221). He had the eighth-lowest run support of AL pitchers (4.97) 
but had a 15–1 record if he received at least two runs of support.[2] Zito 
helped the Athletics reach the postseason. In Game 1 of the ALDS, he allowed 
one run and four hits over eight innings, outdueling Johan Santana and 
earning the win in a 3–2 victory over the Twins and setting the stage for 
an Oakland sweep.[37][38] Zito did not fare as well in Game 1 of the AL 
Championship Series (ALCS) against the Tigers, allowing five runs over 
3 2⁄3 innings in a 5–1 defeat.[39] The Tigers went on to sweep the Athletics 
in four games.[40] Zito replaced his agent Arn Tellem with Scott Boras 
in July 2006.[41] Zito was a focal point of the 2006 trade deadline, and 
was widely rumored to be headed to the Mets in a potential deal for prospect 
Lastings Milledge. Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that 
if the Mets were unwilling to trade Milledge, the Athletics might be interested 
in Aaron Heilman and John Maine.[42] However, Athletics' general manager 
Billy Beane decided to keep Zito for the rest of the season.[2] Following 
his seventh season with the Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with 
the San Francisco Giants worth $126 million, plus $18 million option for 
2014 with a $7 million buyout.[43] Zito's contract on December 29, 2006, 
became the highest for any pitcher in Major League history at the time.[43] 
During spring training in 2007, he and Barry Bonds made shirts that read 
"Don't ask me, ask Barry" with an arrow pointing to the other Barry. By 
all accounts, Zito and Bonds got along well during their short time as 
teammates, and Zito made a point of saying he would stand by Bonds through 
onslaughts from the media.[44] In his first start as a member of the Giants, 
Opening Day (April 3), Zito went five innings and allowed two earned runs 
against the San Diego Padres. He would take the loss. In his next start, 
Zito struggled. He went six innings but allowed eight earned runs against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers.[45] Zito would earn his first win as a member 
of the Giants in his next start on April 16 when he went six innings, gave 
up three hits, and allowed no runs to the Colorado Rockies. "I've been 
trying to have a good game", Zito said. "You can't try to do anything. 
You either do or you don't. I tried to get too fine with my pitches. I 
wasn't aggressive." Rockies manager Clint Hurdle gave Zito credit by saying,"We 
faced a tough pitcher. We are not playing the way that we believe we can 
play. We have to continue to believe what we believe in, but you can't 
let your confidence get swayed."[46] On May 18, Zito made his return to 
Oakland as a Giant. He lasted only four innings as he gave up seven runs 
while walking seven, including two bases-loaded walks. The A's beat the 
Giants, 15–3.[47] He faced his old team again on June 9, this time in San 
Francisco. Zito pitched four innings while giving up three earned runs 
on nine hits in a 6–0 defeat.[48] Zito made his first Major League relief 
appearance on August 5 against the Padres due to an early exit by starter 
Noah Lowry and an overworked bullpen. He pitched a scoreless seventh inning.[49] 
He recorded his first career run batted in (RBI) two days later against 
the Nationals' Mike Bacsik, in the same game that Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 
756th career home run.[50] After Zito's start on August 12, his ERA was 
5.13.[45] Over his final nine starts, he posted the fifth-best ERA in the 
NL, at 3.10.[2] He also had a 3–2 record.[45] He admitted that he had put 
pressure on himself to perform because of the large contract and was learning 
that he just needed to be himself. Zito also said that it had been difficult 
for him to adjust to a new league, team, and ballpark.[51] On the final 
day of the season, in Los Angeles against the Dodgers, Zito allowed two 
runs on five hits and had four strikeouts in an 11–2 win.[45] For the first 
time in his career, Zito had a losing record, as he finished the season 
at 11–13. He failed to reach 200 innings ( 196 2⁄3) for the first time 
since 2000 and posted a career-high 4.53 ERA.[2] Zito began the 2008 season 
as the oldest starter and the veteran presence in the Giants' starting 
rotation.[52] In April, Zito went 0–6 with a 7.53 ERA and 11 strikeouts. 
He was the third pitcher in the last 52 years to go 0–6 before May 1.[53] 
On April 28, the Giants moved him to the bullpen.[54] Zito did not make 
an appearance out of the bullpen and returned to the rotation on May 7 
against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In that game, Zito allowed five hits and 
two earned runs over five innings and took the loss, his seventh of the 
season.[55] On May 23, Zito collected his first win of the 2008 season 
against the Florida Marlins.[2] On June 13, Zito became the first pitcher 
to record 10 losses in the Major Leagues following a 5–1 loss to Oakland. 
His 5.1 walks per nine innings pitched for the season, 51.5% first-pitch-strike 
percentage, and 14 sacrifice flies allowed, were all the worst in the majors.[56][57] 
Beginning June 25, Zito saw some improvement, as he posted an 8–6 record 
for the rest of the season to go along with a 4.33 ERA.[55] He finished 
the year 10–17 with a career-high 5.15 ERA and 120 strikeouts. His 17 losses 
led the National League and were the second-worst total in San Francisco 
history (Ray Sadecki lost 18 games in 1968).[2] The 2009 season seemed 
to mark a rebound in Zito's pitching performance. Though starting the season 
0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended the season with an ERA of 4.03. His ERA 
would have been 3.74 had it not been for his first two starts.[58] Though 
going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more the fault of 
his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his 
performance on the mound.[59] On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through 
six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in 
the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season.[60] 
On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. 
He pitched 8⅓ innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on 
four hits, striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth 
win of the season.[61] Zito started the 2010 season by pitching six shutout 
innings against the Houston Astros to earn a win; it was the first time 
he had won his season opening start since 2003. On April 24, Zito stifled 
the St. Louis Cardinals, throwing eight shutout innings with ten strikeouts 
for his third victory of the season, en route to starting the season 5–0 
for the first time in his career. It was the best start by a Giants' pitcher 
since 2004, when Lowry started 6–0. On June 12, 2010, Zito earned his first 
win against his former team, the Athletics, which gave him victories against 
every MLB team.[2] Through June 12, Zito was 7–2 with a 3.10 ERA. After 
a strong start to the season, Zito regressed down the stretch, going 2–12 
with a 4.97 ERA the rest of the way.[62] He finished the season 9–14 with 
a 4.15 ERA, snapping a streak of nine straight seasons in which he had 
10 or more wins.[2] In a rotation featuring Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, Jonathan 
Sánchez, and Madison Bumgarner, Zito was the odd man out for the playoffs. 
In fact, he was left completely off the Giants' 25-man active roster for 
the postseason. Zito worked out throughout the playoffs so that he would 
be ready to join the roster in case of an injury, but he was never needed 
and remained on the secondary squad.[63] Nevertheless, he won his first 
World Series ring as a member of the full roster.[2] Early in the 2011 
season Zito experienced his first trip to the disabled list after an injury 
to his right foot during a fielding play.[2] His replacement, Ryan Vogelsong, 
excelled, but Zito was able to rejoin the rotation when he returned in 
June because Sánchez was placed on the disabled list with left biceps tendinitis.[64][65] 
Zito pitched well in his first few starts back, pitching well against the 
Tigers, Chicago Cubs, and Padres en route to three Giants wins, but later 
resumed his struggle, going 0–3 with a 10.91 ERA over his next three starts.[66] 
He returned to the disabled list after aggravating his right foot injury; 
ironically, his trip to the DL made room for Sánchez to return to the rotation.[67] 
On August 13, Zito injured his right ankle on another fielding play in 
a Triple-A rehab start, sidelining him for another month.[68] Zito returned 
from the DL on September 11 but was used out of the bullpen for the rest 
of the year; he posted a 9.00 ERA over his final four games.[66][69] In 
a career-low 13 games (nine starts), he had a 3–4 record, a career-high 
5.87 ERA, 32 strikeouts, and 24 walks in a career-low 53 2⁄3 innings.[2] 
After struggling mightily during spring training in which he threw with 
a new crouched delivery, Zito began the 2012 season with a start against 
the Rockies on April 9. He threw arguably one of the best games of his 
career, throwing a complete game shutout while giving up just 4 hits in 
the 7–0 Giants victory. It was his first shutout since 2003 when he was 
a member of the Oakland Athletics.[70] In a June 3 home game matchup with 
the Cubs, Zito pitched four-hit shutout ball into the ninth inning for 
a 2–0 Giants win and brought his season ERA below 3.00.[71] In earning 
the win, Zito earned his 150th career win, becoming the 246th pitcher to 
hit the mark.[72] Zito had a hand in the Giants' second road shutout win 
of the season when he pitched seven innings, allowing three hits and recording 
four strikeouts, in a July 17 game versus the Atlanta Braves. The win pushed 
his season record to 8–6.[73] Zito would go on to finish the season with 
a 15–8 record, his most wins in a season with the Giants, while sporting 
a 4.15 ERA.[2] Zito faced off against the Reds in Game 4 of the National 
League Division Series (NLDS) on October 10 and struggled, being pulled 
in the third inning after allowing two runs. However, the Giants went on 
to win 8–3.[74] The Giants, after losing the first two games of the series, 
became the first team to rally from a 2–0 deficit in an NLDS, winning the 
series in five games.[75] On October 19, 2012, Zito rebounded and pitched 
arguably the best game of his career, tossing 7 2⁄3 shutout innings against 
the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series 
(NLCS), earning the win.[76] It was his first postseason win since 2006 
and according to Zito himself, was the biggest win of his career.[77] That 
same day, Zito inspired the Twitter hashtag #rallyzito, which, behind the 
efforts of Giants fans, was trending worldwide on the social networking 
site.[78] The Giants, after trailing 3–1 in the series, prevailed in seven 
games.[79] On October 24, 2012, Zito pitched in the first World Series 
of his career. As the Game 1 starter, Zito earned the win, outpitching 
Detroit's Justin Verlander by tossing 5 2/3 innings of one-run ball. Zito 
also added an RBI single en route to an 8–3 Giants win.[80] The Giants 
went on to sweep the Tigers in the World Series, and Zito went 2–0 with 
a 1.69 earned run average in the postseason.[81] Zito did not lose a single 
game after August 2 against the Mets, and San Francisco won his last 14 
starts.[82] On April 5, 2013, during the Giants' home opener, Zito held 
the Cardinals scoreless over seven shutout innings, earning the 1–0 win.[83] 
He followed this performance with seven more shutout innings and some personal 
offensive contribution at the plate against the Rockies in a 10–0 win to 
complete a 3-game series sweep.[84] It was the Giants' 16th straight victory 
in a row in games started by Zito (including the 2012 regular season and 
postseason), the longest such streak by a Giants pitcher since 1936 by 
Hall of Fame left-handed pitcher Carl Hubbell.[84] However, Zito struggled 
for the rest of the season, going 2–10 with a 6.24 ERA after April 21 and 
losing his rotation spot a couple times late in the year.[85][86] On September 
25, manager Bruce Bochy decided to give Zito one final start with the Giants 
as a tribute to his tenure with the team. Zito responded by allowing two 
runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory 
over the Dodgers.[87] However, because Zito was removed between innings 
during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in to pitch in relief in the final 
game of the year so that Giants' fans could give him a standing ovation. 
Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 and struck 
out Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 
7–6.[88] He finished the 2013 season at 5–11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 
25 of which were starts.[2] Following the season, Zito took out a full-page 
ad in the San Francisco Chronicle thanking Giants fans for their support.[89] 
The Giants declined Zito's 2014 option, buying it out for $7 million.[90] 
After taking a year off from baseball, Zito signed a minor league contract 
to return to the Athletics on February 16, 2015.[91] In spring training, 
Zito competed for a role on the Athletics' 25-man roster, possibly as a 
long reliever.[92] On April 4, 2015, Zito accepted an assignment to the 
Triple-A Nashville Sounds.[93][94] Zito's Nashville teammates lauded him 
for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: 
charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner 
for the entire team on his birthday.[95] Zito spent the entire season with 
Nashville, including about a month on the disabled list with left shoulder 
tendinitis. He was activated on the next-to-last day of the season on which 
he pitched one scoreless inning of relief. In a total of 24 appearances 
(22 starts), he accrued an 8–7 record with a 3.46 ERA and 91 strikeouts. 
Zito revealed in an interview that he had learned the Athletics would not 
be bringing him up to the major league club in September.[96] However, 
following a season-ending injury to Jesse Chavez, Oakland purchased Zito's 
contract from Triple-A on September 16, placing him on the major league 
roster.[97] Zito made his first major league appearance on September 20, 
pitching an inning in relief.[98] On September 26, 2015, Zito started for 
the Athletics against Hudson and the Giants in a matchup that was arranged 
as a tribute to the A's "Big Three" of the early 2000s. Both pitchers received 
lengthy standing ovations from the sold-out Coliseum crowd (which included 
the third Big Three member, Mulder) upon leaving the game.[99] On October 
19, 2015, Zito announced his retirement from baseball in an article for 
The Players' Tribune.[100] Zito's fastball has hovered between 84 miles 
per hour (135 km/h) and 88 miles per hour (142 km/h).[101] He augments 
it with a circle changeup and a curveball that he uses as a strikeout pitch.[102] 
His curveball was voted the best in the Major Leagues in a player poll 
conducted by Sports Illustrated in 2005. Alex Rodriguez once stated that 
he had never seen anything like Zito's curveball, commenting: "It's such 
a high one, and it drops three to four feet. You might as well not even 
look for it because you're not going to hit it."[103] Since mid-2004, Zito 
has added a two-seam fastball and a cutter–slider hybrid to his arsenal. 
In the 2009 season, this cutter-slider became a prominent part of his repertoire, 
being used more frequently than his changeup.[102] Zito's diminished velocity 
at the start of the 2007 season (his fastball velocity slowed to 83–85 
miles per hour (134–137 km/h)) and loss of command were the key mechanical 
reasons for his struggles that year, as he more often got behind in the 
count and had to rely more on his fastball.[1] During the 2009 season, 
Zito made changes to his delivery, lowering his arm slot from an over the 
top angle to a three quarters delivery. This change helped his fastball 
velocity go back up to the 86–89 miles per hour (138–143 km/h) range as 
well as sharpening the break of his curveball. However, in 2011, he was 
once again in the 84–87 miles per hour (135–140 km/h) range with his fastball. 
In 2012, Zito relied mostly on his two-seam fastball and cutter, and reduced 
his reliance on the four-seamer,[102] which was the slowest four-seamer 
in MLB among starting pitchers that year, at 84.6 miles per hour (136.2 km/h).[104] 
Addressing his finesse pitching style, Zito said, "My fastball is set up 
by my offspeed, that's no secret. So if I can command my fastball to both 
sides of the plate and throw most of my offspeed for strikes, I'll get 
them to miss the barrel. That's what I'm going for."[105] From 2000 through 
2004 with the Athletics, Zito, Hudson, and Mulder were known as the "Big 
Three."[106] Of the three, Zito had the highest single-season win total 
and was the only one to win the Cy Young Award.[2][107][108] Zito's .618 
winning percentage is 10th all-time in Athletics history. His 6.896 strikeouts 
per 9 innings pitched ranks seventh, his 1,096 strikeouts rank eighth, 
and his 222 games started rank 10th. Zito also holds a couple more dubious 
positions on Oakland's list: his 148 home runs allowed rank fifth, and 
his 65 hit by pitches rank fourth (although he trails Eddie Plank, Chief 
Bender, and Rube Waddell in that category).[109] Zito's .821 winning percentage 
in 2002 is tied with Bender's in 1910 for 10th among Athletics' single-season 
totals. His 8.608 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched in 2001 rank seventh, 
and his 205 strikeouts in 2001 are tied for 10th (with Dave Stewart's 1987 
total and Todd Stottlemyre's 1995 total).[109] Zito's regular season performance 
with the Giants was less successful; he went 63–80 with a 4.62 ERA.[12] 
However, he had significantly more playoff success with them. Aided by 
his contributions in 2010, the team won its first World Series since 1954. 
Zito did not pitch in the playoffs that year, but did pitch in the 2012 
postseason, saving the Giants' season by pitching them to a Game 5 victory 
in the NLCS against the Cardinals, and then outdueling Tigers' ace Justin 
Verlander in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series. The Giants went on to win 
their second World Series in three years.[81] Zito became engaged to former 
Miss Missouri Amber Seyer in April 2011, and they were married on December 
3, 2011.[111] His father, Joe Zito, who died June 19, 2013, at the age 
of 84, composed and arranged music for Nat King Cole in the early 1960s 
(ca.1961–64) and arranged for the Buffalo Symphony Orchestra.[112][113] 
Zito's mother Roberta was a musician who sang in a choral group known as 
The Merry Young Souls and with Nat King Cole and his band.[114] Zito is 
also a musician. He plays guitar, and he co-wrote the song "Butterflies" 
that was used in the Eddie Murphy film A Thousand Words.[115][116] Zito's 
uncle is television actor Patrick Duffy.[115] Zito and wife Amber gave 
birth to their first child, a son, in July 2014.[117][118] Zito is known 
for his idiosyncrasies and his offbeat personality. Early in his career, 
Zito dyed his hair blue. He earned the nicknames "Planet Zito" and "Captain 
Quirk" when with Oakland.[115] Zito says he likes the way his uniform number 
75 looks because the 7 and the 5 are like a "shelf" to hold the name "Zito" 
up.[119] He surfs and practices yoga. He has done yoga poses in the outfield,[120] 
and meditated before games.[121] Zito practices Transcendental Meditation 
and supports the David Lynch Foundation.[122] Zito has said, however, that 
he believes terms such as "flaky" or "hippie" have been applied to him 
by people who do not know him well enough to know better.[123] Zito was 
raised in a "spiritual, metaphysical type church" that was founded by his 
grandmother and that his mother, Roberta, who died in 2008, formerly preached 
at.[124][125] In 2001, Zito espoused a universal life force that he credited 
with his midseason turnaround. He said that he discovered this force by 
reading Creative Mind by Ernest Holmes.[126] However, in August 2011, Zito 
became a Christian, saying he "committed to Jesus Christ as his Lord and 
Savior." Zito explained that God got his attention through his being left 
off the 2010 Giants postseason roster and a car accident and freak foot 
injury in early 2011. He got a tattoo (his only one) of a golden calf on 
the inside of his right bicep as a reminder for him to "not worship false 
idols" and to remember that God comes first. Zito said that his wife is 
a Christian as well.[123][125] Zito founded the charity Strikeouts For 
Troops. The charity provides comforts of home and works to lift the spirits 
and morale of injured US troops and offers support to military families.[127] 
In 2010, Zito announced that he would donate $1,500 for every strikeout 
in the Giants–Padres game on September 11.[128] There were a total of 14 
strikeouts in the game.[129] In 2003, Zito portrayed a United States Navy 
petty officer in an episode of JAG on CBS. Zito's character, a pitcher, 
faced assault charges after hitting a Marine with a ball during the annual
