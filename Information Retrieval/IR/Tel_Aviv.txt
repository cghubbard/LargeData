Tel Aviv-Yafo (Hebrew: תֵּל אָבִיב-יָפוֹ, [tel a'viv jafo], Arabic: تل 
أَبيب-يافا‎‎) is a major city in Israel, located on the country's Mediterranean 
coastline. It is known to be the financial center and the technology hub 
of Israel, with a population of 432,892 within city limits. Tel Aviv is 
the largest city in the Gush Dan region of Israel. Tel Aviv is also a focal 
point in the high-tech concentration known as the "Silicon Wadi". Tel Aviv 
is governed by the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality, headed by Ron Huldai, and 
is home to many foreign embassies.[6] Tel Aviv is a global city, and is 
the thirty eighth most important financial center in the world.[7] Tel 
Aviv is known to have the third-largest economy of any city in the Middle 
East after Abu Dhabi and Kuwait City,[8] and has the 31st highest cost 
of living in the world.[9] The city receives over a million international 
visitors annually.[10][11] Known as "The City that Never Sleeps" and a 
"party capital", it has a lively nightlife, dynamic atmosphere and a famous 
24-hour culture.[12][13] The city was founded in 1909 by Jewish immigrants 
on the outskirts of the ancient port city of Jaffa (Hebrew: יָפוֹ Yafo). 
The modern city's first neighbourhoods had already been established in 
1886, the first being Neve Tzedek.[14] Immigration by mostly Jewish refugees 
meant that the growth of Tel Aviv soon outpaced Jaffa's, which had a majority 
Arab population at the time.[15] Tel Aviv and Jaffa were merged into a 
single municipality in 1950, two years after the establishment of the State 
of Israel. Tel Aviv's White City, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site 
in 2003, comprises the world's largest concentration of International Style 
buildings (Bauhaus and other related modernist architectural styles).[16][17] 
Tel Aviv is the Hebrew title of Theodor Herzl's Altneuland ("Old New Land"), 
translated from German by Nahum Sokolow. Sokolow had adopted the name of 
a Mesopotamian site near the city of Babylon mentioned in Ezekiel: "Then 
I came to them of the captivity at Tel Abib, that lived by the river Chebar, 
and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days."[18] 
The name was chosen in 1910 from several suggestions, including "Herzliya". 
It was found fitting as it embraced the idea of a renaissance in the ancient 
Jewish homeland. Aviv is Hebrew for "spring", symbolizing renewal, and 
tel is a man-made mound accumulating layers of civilization built one over 
the other and symbolizing the ancient. Theories vary about the etymology 
of Jaffa or Yafo in Hebrew. Some believe that the name derives from yafah 
or yofi, Hebrew for "beautiful" or "beauty".[citation needed] Another tradition 
is that Japheth, son of Noah, founded the city and that it was named after 
him.[19] The ancient port of Jaffa changed hands many times in the course 
of history. Archeological excavations from 1955 to 1974 unearthed towers 
and gates from the Middle Bronze Age.[21] Subsequent excavations, from 
1997 onwards, helped date earlier discoveries.[21] They also exposed sections 
of a packed-sandstone glacis and a massive brick wall, dating from the 
Late Bronze Age, as well as a temple attributed to the Sea Peoples and 
dwellings from the Iron Age.[21] Remnants of buildings from the Persian 
and Hellenistic periods were also discovered.[21] The city, Jaffa, is first 
mentioned in letters from 1470 BC that record its conquest by Egyptian 
Pharaoh Thutmose III.[22] Jaffa is mentioned several times in the Bible, 
as the port from which Jonah set sail for Tarshish;[23] as bordering on 
the territory of the Tribe of Dan;[24] and as the Jaffa Port at which the 
wood for Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem arrived from Lebanon.[25] According 
to some sources it has been a port for at least 4,000 years.[19] Jaffa 
is also mentioned as the place where the Apostle Peter raised Tabitha and 
visited Simon the Tanner.[26] In the early state of the Great Revolt in 
Judea, Cestius Gallus, the Roman legate of Syria, assembled the Syrian 
legion XII Fulminata reinforced with units of III Gallica, IIII Scythica, 
and VI Ferrata, plus auxiliaries and allies (a total of approximately 30,000 
soldiers) in order to restore order in the neighbouring province. In late 
66, The Syrian legion captured Narbata and also took Sipporis, which surrendered 
with no fight. Gallus later reached Acre in Western Galilee, and then marched 
on Caesarea and Jaffa, where he massacred some 8,400 people, razing the 
city to the ground. In mid-67, Jews, who were driven out of Galilee rebuilt 
Jaffa, which had been destroyed earlier by Cestius Gallus. Surrounded and 
cut off by the Romans, they rebuilt the city walls, and used a light flotilla 
to demoralize commerce and interrupt the grain supply to Rome from Alexandria.[27] 
In his The Jewish War Josephus wrote: They also built themselves a great 
many piratical ships, and turned pirates upon the seas near to Syria, and 
Phoenicia, and Egypt, and made those seas unnavigable to all men.[28] In 
1099, the Catholic armies of the First Crusade, led by Godfrey of Bouillon, 
occupied Jaffa, which had been abandoned by the Muslims, fortified the 
town and improved its harbor.[29] As the County of Jaffa, the town soon 
became important as the main sea supply route for the Kingdom of Jerusalem.[30] 
Jaffa was captured by Saladin in 1187 but swiftly re-taken by Richard the 
Lionheart in 1191, who added to its defenses.[31] In 1223, Emperor Frederick 
II added further fortifications.[31] Crusader domination ended in 1268, 
when the Mamluk Sultan Baibars captured the town, destroyed its harbor 
and razed its fortifications.[31][32] In 1336, when a new Crusade was being 
planned, Al-Nasir Muhammad had the harbor destroyed to prevent the Franks 
from landing there.[33] For the same reason, both the town and the harbor 
were destroyed in 1345.[33] In the 16th century, Jaffa was conquered by 
the Ottomans and was administered as a village in the Sanjak of Gaza.[32] 
Napoleon besieged the city in 1799 and killed scores of inhabitants; a 
plague epidemic followed, decimating the remaining population.[32] The 
surrendering garrison of several thousand Muslims was massacred.[34] Jaffa 
began to grow as an urban center in the early 18th century, when the Ottoman 
government in Istanbul intervened to guard the port and reduce attacks 
by Bedouins and pirates.[32] However, the real expansion came during the 
19th century, when the population grew from 2,500 in 1806 to 17,000 in 
1886.[35] From 1800 to 1870, many of Jaffa's old walls and towers were 
torn down to allow for expansion.[36] The sea wall, 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) 
high, remained intact until the 1930s, when it was built over during a 
renovation of the port by the British Mandatory authorities.[36] Trade 
with Europe began to develop in the mid-19th century.[37] In the 1860s 
Jaffa's Jewish community was consisted mainly of Jews from Morocco and 
Turkey, and small numbers of Ashkenazi Jews. Since 1886, Jewish settlers 
had founded new neighborhoods outside Jaffa on the current territory of 
Tel Aviv. The first was Neve Tzedek, built on lands owned by Aharon Chelouche.[14] 
Other neighborhoods were Neve Shalom (1890), Yafa Nof (1896), Achva (1899), 
Ohel Moshe (1904), Kerem HaTeimanim (1906), and others. Once Tel Aviv received 
city status in the 1920s, those neighborhoods joined the newly formed municipality, 
now becoming separated from Jaffa. The Second Aliyah led to further expansion. 
In 1906, a group of Jews, among them residents of Jaffa, followed the initiative 
of Akiva Aryeh Weiss and banded together to form the Ahuzat Bayit (lit. 
"homestead") society. The society's goal was to form a "Hebrew urban centre 
in a healthy environment, planned according to the rules of aesthetics 
and modern hygiene."[38] The urban planning for the new city was influenced 
by the Garden city movement.[39] The first 60 plots were purchased in Kerem 
Djebali near Jaffa by Jacobus Kann, a Dutch citizen, who registered them 
in his name to circumvent the Turkish prohibition on Jewish land acquisition.[40] 
Meir Dizengoff, later Tel Aviv's first mayor, also joined the Ahuzat Bayit 
society.[41][42] His vision for Tel Aviv involved peaceful co-existence 
with Arabs.[35][unreliable source] On 11 April 1909, 66 Jewish families 
gathered on a desolate sand dune to parcel out the land by lottery using 
seashells. This gathering is considered the official date of the establishment 
of Tel Aviv. The lottery was organised by Akiva Aryeh Weiss, president 
of the building society.[43][44] Weiss collected 120 sea shells on the 
beach, half of them white and half of them grey. The members' names were 
written on the white shells and the plot numbers on the grey shells. A 
boy drew names from one box of shells and a girl drew plot numbers from 
the second box. A photographer, Avraham Soskin, documented the event. The 
first water well was later dug at this site (today Rothschild Boulevard, 
across from Dizengoff House).[45] Within a year, Herzl, Ahad Ha'am, Yehuda 
Halevi, Lilienblum, and Rothschild streets were built; a water system was 
installed; and 66 houses (including some on six subdivided plots) were 
completed.[39] At the end of Herzl Street, a plot was allocated for a new 
building for the Herzliya Hebrew High School, founded in Jaffa in 1906.[39] 
On 21 May 1910, the name Tel Aviv was adopted.[39] The flag and city arms 
of Tel Aviv (see above) contain under the red Star of David 2 words from 
the biblical book of Jeremiah: "I (God) will build You up again and you 
will be rebuilt." (Jer 31:4) Tel Aviv was planned as an independent Hebrew 
city with wide streets and boulevards, running water at each house, and 
street lights.[46] By 1914, Tel Aviv had grown to more than 1 square kilometre 
(247 acres).[39] However, growth halted in 1917 when the Ottoman authorities 
expelled the residents of Jaffa and Tel Aviv.[39] A report published in 
The New York Times by United States Consul Garrels in Alexandria, Egypt 
described the Jaffa deportation of early April 1917. The orders of evacuation 
were aimed chiefly at the Jewish population.[47] Jews were free to return 
to their homes in Tel Aviv at the end of the following year when, with 
the end of World War I and the defeat of the Ottomans, the British took 
control of Palestine. With increasing Jewish immigration during the British 
administration, friction between Arabs and Jews in Palestine increased. 
On 1 May 1921, the Jaffa Riots resulted in the deaths of 48 Arabs and 47 
Jews and injuries to 146 Jews and 73 Arabs.[48] In the wake of this violence, 
many Jews left Jaffa for Tel Aviv, increasing the population of Tel Aviv 
from 2,000 in 1920 to around 34,000 by 1925.[16][49] Tel Aviv began to 
develop as a commercial center.[50] In 1923, Tel Aviv was the first town 
to be wired to electricity in Palestine, followed by Jaffa later in the 
same year. The opening ceremony of the Jaffa Electric Company powerhouse, 
on 10 June 1923, celebrated the lighting of the two main streets of Tel 
Aviv.[51] In 1925, the Scottish biologist, sociologist, philanthropist 
and pioneering town planner Patrick Geddes drew up a master plan for Tel 
Aviv which was adopted by the city council led by Meir Dizengoff. Geddes's 
plan for developing the northern part of the district was based on Ebenezer 
Howard's garden city movement.[52] The plan consisted of four main features: 
a hierarchical system of streets laid out in a grid, large blocks consisting 
of small-scale domestic dwellings, the organization of these blocks around 
central open spaces, and the concentration of cultural institutions to 
form a civic center.[53] While most of the northern area of Tel Aviv was 
built according to this plan, the influx of European refugees in the 1930s 
necessitated the construction of taller apartment buildings on a larger 
footprint in the city.[54] Ben Gurion House was built in 1930–31, part 
of a new workers' housing development. At the same time, Jewish cultural 
life was given a boost by the establishment of the Ohel Theatre and the 
decision of Habima Theatre to make Tel Aviv its permanent base in 1931.[39] 
Tel Aviv was granted municipal status in 1934.[39] The Jewish population 
rose dramatically during the Fifth Aliyah after the Nazis came to power 
in Germany.[39] By 1937 the Jewish population of Tel Aviv had risen to 
150,000, compared to Jaffa's mainly Arab 69,000 residents. Within two years, 
it had reached 160,000, which was over a third of Palestine's total Jewish 
population.[39] Many new Jewish immigrants to Palestine disembarked in 
Jaffa, and remained in Tel Aviv, turning the city into a center of urban 
life. Friction during the 1936–39 Arab revolt, led to the opening of a 
local Jewish port, Tel Aviv Port, independent of Jaffa, in 1938, (it closed 
on 25 October 1965). Lydda Airport (later Ben Gurion Airport) and Sde Dov 
Airport opened between 1937 and 1938.[35][unreliable source] Many German 
Jewish architects trained at the Bauhaus, the Modernist school of architecture 
in Germany, and left Germany during the 1930s. Some, like Arieh Sharon, 
came to Palestine and adapted the architectural outlook of the Bauhaus 
and similar schools to the local conditions there, creating what is recognized 
as the largest concentration of buildings in the International Style in 
the world.[16][35][unreliable source] Tel Aviv's White City emerged in 
the 1930s, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003.[55] Tel Aviv 
was hit during the Italian Bombing of Palestine in World War II. On 9 September 
1940, 137 were killed in the bombing of Tel Aviv.[56] According to the 
1947 UN Partition Plan for dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, 
Tel Aviv, by then a city of 230,000, was to be included in the proposed 
Jewish state. Jaffa with, as of 1945, a population of 101,580 people—53,930 
Muslims, 30,820 Jews and 16,800 Christians—was designated as part of the 
Arab state. Civil War broke out in the country and in particular between 
the neighbouring cities of Tel Aviv and Jaffa, which had been assigned 
to the Jewish and Arab states respectively. After several months of siege, 
on 13 May 1948, Jaffa fell and the Arab population fled en masse. When 
Israel declared Independence on 14 May 1948, the population of Tel Aviv 
was over 200,000.[57] Tel Aviv was the temporary government center of the 
State of Israel until the government moved to Jerusalem in December, 1949. 
Due to the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most embassies 
remained in or near Tel Aviv.[58] In the early 1980s, 13 embassies in Jerusalem 
moved to Tel Aviv as part of the UN's measures responding to Israel's 1980 
Jerusalem Law.[59] Today, all national embassies are in Tel Aviv or environs.[60] 
The boundaries of Tel Aviv and Jaffa became a matter of contention between 
the Tel Aviv municipality and the Israeli government in 1948.[61] The former 
wished to incorporate only the northern Jewish suburbs of Jaffa, while 
the latter wanted a more complete unification.[61] The issue also had international 
sensitivity, since the main part of Jaffa was in the Arab portion of the 
United Nations Partition Plan, whereas Tel Aviv was not, and no armistice 
agreements had yet been signed.[61] On 10 December 1948, the government 
announced the annexation to Tel Aviv of Jaffa's Jewish suburbs, the Palestinian 
neighborhood of Abu Kabir, the Palestinian village of Salama and some of 
its agricultural land, and the Jewish 'Hatikva' slum.[61] On 25 February 
1949, the depopulated Palestinian village of al-Shaykh Muwannis was also 
annexed to Tel Aviv.[61] On 18 May 1949, Manshiya and part of Jaffa's central 
zone were added, for the first time including land that had been in the 
Arab portion of the UN partition plan.[61] The government voted on the 
unification of Tel Aviv and Jaffa on 4 October 1949, but the decision was 
not implemented until 24 April 1950 due to the opposition of Tel Aviv mayor 
Israel Rokach.[61] The name of the unified city was Tel Aviv until 19 August 
1950, when it was renamed Tel Aviv-Yafo in order to preserve the historical 
name Jaffa.[61] Tel Aviv thus grew to 42 square kilometers (16.2 sq mi). 
In 1949, a memorial to the 60 founders of Tel Aviv was constructed.[62] 
Over the past 60 years, Tel Aviv has developed into a secular, liberal-minded 
center with a vibrant nightlife and café culture.[35][unreliable source] 
In the 1960s, some of the older buildings were demolished, making way for 
the country's first high-rises. The Shalom Meir Tower, which was completed 
in 1965. was Israel's tallest building until 1999. Tel Aviv's population 
peaked in the early 1960s at 390,000, representing 16 percent of the country's 
total.[63] A long period of steady decline followed, however, and by the 
late 1980s the city had an aging population of 317,000.[63] High property 
prices pushed families out and deterred young people from moving in.[63] 
At this time, gentrification began in the poor neighborhoods of southern 
Tel Aviv, and the old port in the north was renewed.[35][unreliable source] 
New laws were introduced to protect Modernist buildings, and efforts to 
preserve them were aided by UNESCO recognition of the Tel Aviv's White 
City as a world heritage site. In the early 1990s, the decline in population 
was reversed, partly due to the large wave of immigrants from the former 
Soviet Union.[63] Tel Aviv also began to emerge as a high-tech center.[35][unreliable 
source] The construction of many skyscrapers and high-tech office buildings 
followed. In 1993, Tel Aviv was categorized as a world city.[64] The city 
is regarded as a strong candidate for global city status.[65] In the Gulf 
War in 1991, Tel Aviv was attacked by Scud missiles from Iraq. Iraq hoped 
to provoke an Israeli military response, which could have destroyed the 
US–Arab alliance. The United States pressured Israel not to retaliate, 
and after Israel acquiesced, the US and Netherlands rushed Patriot missiles 
to defend against the attacks, but they proved largely ineffective. Tel 
Aviv and other Israeli cities continued to be hit by Scuds throughout the 
war, and every city in the Tel Aviv area except for Bnei Brak was hit. 
A total of 74 Israelis died as a result of the Iraqi attacks, mostly from 
suffocation and heart attacks,[66] while approximately 230 Israelis were 
injured.[67] Extensive property damage was also caused, and some 4,000 
Israelis were left homeless. It was feared that Iraq would fire missiles 
filled with nerve agents or sarin. As a result, the Israeli government 
issued gas masks to its citizens. When the first Iraqi missiles hit Israel, 
some people injected themselves with an antidote for nerve gas. The inhabitants 
of the southeastern suburb of HaTikva erected an angel-monument as a sign 
of their gratitude that "it was through a great miracle, that many people 
were preserved from being killed by a direct hit of a Scud rocket."[68] 
On 4 November 1995, Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated 
at a rally in Tel Aviv in support of the Oslo peace accord. The outdoor 
plaza where this occurred, formerly known as Kikar Malchei Yisrael, was 
renamed Rabin Square.[35][unreliable source] In 2009, Tel Aviv celebrated 
its official centennial.[69] In addition to city- and country-wide celebrations, 
digital collections of historical materials were assembled. These include 
the History section of the official Tel Aviv-Yafo Centennial Year website;[69] 
the Ahuzat Bayit collection, which focuses on the founding families of 
Tel Aviv, and includes photographs and biographies;[70] and Stanford University's 
Eliasaf Robinson Tel Aviv Collection,[71] documenting the history of the 
city. Since the First Intifada, Tel Aviv has suffered from Palestinian 
political violence. The first suicide attack in Tel Aviv occurred on 19 
October 1994, on the Line 5 bus, when a bomber killed 22 civilians and 
injured 50 as part of a Hamas suicide campaign.[72] On 6 March 1996, another 
Hamas suicide bomber killed 13 people (12 civilians and 1 soldier) in the 
Dizengoff Center suicide bombing.[73][74] Three women were killed by a 
Hamas terrorist in the Café Apropo bombing on 27 March 1997.[75][76][77] 
One of the most deadly attacks occurred on 1 June 2001, during the Second 
Intifada, when a suicide bomber exploded at the entrance to the Dolphinarium 
discothèque, killing 21, mostly teenagers, and injuring 132.[78][79][80][81] 
Another Hamas suicide bomber killed six civilians and injured 70 in the 
Allenby Street bus bombing.[82][83][84][85][86] Twenty-three civilians 
were killed and over 100 injured in the Tel Aviv central bus station massacre.[87][88] 
Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack. In the 
Mike's Place suicide bombing, an attack on a bar by a British Muslim suicide 
bomber resulted in the deaths of three civilians and wounded over 50.[89] 
Hamas and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed joint responsibility. An Islamic 
Jihad bomber killed five and wounded over 50 in the 25 February 2005 Stage 
Club bombing.[90] The most recent suicide attack in the city occurred on 
17 April 2006, when 11 people were killed and at least 70 wounded in a 
suicide bombing near the old central bus station.[91] Another attack took 
place on 29 August 2011 in which a Palestinian attacker stole an Israeli 
taxi cab and rammed it into a police checkpoint guarding the popular Haoman 
17 nightclub in Tel Aviv which was filled with 2,000[92] Israeli teenagers. 
After crashing, the assailant went on a stabbing spree, injuring eight 
people.[90] Due to an Israel Border Police roadblock at the entrance and 
immediate response of the Border Police team during the subsequent stabbings, 
a much larger and fatal mass-casualty incident was avoided.[93] On 21 November 
2012, during Operation Pillar of Defense, the Tel Aviv area was targeted 
by rockets, and air raid sirens were sounded in the city for the first 
time since the Gulf War. All of the rockets either missed populated areas 
or were shot down by an Iron Dome rocket defense battery stationed near 
the city. During the operation, a bomb blast on a bus wounded at least 
28 civilians, three seriously.[94][95][96][97] This was described as a 
terrorist attack by Israel, Russia, and the United States and was condemned 
by the United Nations, United States, United Kingdom, France and Russia, 
whilst Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri declared that the organisation "blesses" 
the attack.[98] Tel Aviv is located around 32°5′N 34°48′E﻿ / ﻿32.083°N 
34.800°E﻿ / 32.083; 34.800 on the Israeli Mediterranean coastline, in central 
Israel, the historic land bridge between Europe, Asia and Africa. Immediately 
north of the ancient port of Jaffa, Tel Aviv lies on land that used to 
be sand dunes and as such has relatively poor soil fertility. The land 
has been flattened and has no important gradients; its most notable geographical 
features are bluffs above the Mediterranean coastline and the Yarkon River 
mouth.[99] Because of the expansion of Tel Aviv and the Gush Dan region, 
absolute borders between Tel Aviv and Jaffa and between the city's neighborhoods 
do not exist. The city is located 60 kilometers (37 mi) northwest of Jerusalem 
and 90 kilometers (56 mi) south of the city of Haifa.[100] Neighboring 
cities and towns include Herzliya to the north, Ramat HaSharon to the northeast, 
Petah Tikva, Bnei Brak, Ramat Gan and Giv'atayim to the east, Holon to 
the southeast, and Bat Yam to the south.[101] The city is economically 
stratified between the north and south. Southern Tel Aviv is considered 
less affluent than Northern Tel Aviv with the exception of Neve Tzedek 
and some recent development on Jaffa beach. Central Tel Aviv is home to 
Azrieli Center and the important financial and commerce district along 
Ayalon Highway. The northern side of Tel Aviv is home to Tel Aviv University, 
Hayarkon Park, and upscale residential neighborhoods such as Ramat Aviv 
and Afeka.[102] Tel Aviv has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: 
Csa),[103] characterised by hot, humid yet rainless summers and mild, wet 
winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between October and 
May. The average annual temperature is 20.9 °C (69.6 °F), and the average 
sea temperature is 18–20 °C (64–68 °F) during the winter, and 24–29 °C 
(75–84 °F) during the summer. The city averages 528 millimeters (20.8 in) 
of precipitation annually. Summers in Tel Aviv last about five months, 
from June to October. Precipitation during the summer is rare, although 
light drizzles may occur in some early mornings. August, the warmest month, 
averages a high of 30.6 °C (87.1 °F), and a low of 25 °C (77 °F). The high 
relative humidity due to the location of the city by the Mediterranean 
Sea, in a combination with the high temperatures, creates a thermal discomfort 
during the summer. Summer low temperatures in Tel Aviv seldom drop below 
20 °C (68 °F). Winters are mild and wet, with most of the annual precipitation 
falling within the months of December, January and February as intense 
rainfall and thunderstorms. In January, the coolest month, the average 
maximum temperature is 17.6 °C (63.7 °F), the mimimum temperature averages 
10.2 °C (50.4 °F). During the colder days of winter, temperatures may reach 
a low of 6 °C (43 °F). Autumns and springs are characterized by sharp temperature 
changes, with heat waves that might be created due to hot and dry air masses 
that arrive from the nearby deserts. During heatwaves in autumn and springs, 
temperatures usually climb up to 35 °C (95 °F) and even up to 40 °C (104 °F), 
accompanied with exceptionally low humidity. An average day during autumn 
and spring has a high of 23 °C (73 °F) to 25 °C (77 °F), and a low of 15 °C 
(59 °F) to 18 °C (64 °F). The highest recorded temperature in Tel Aviv 
was 46.5 °C (115.7 °F) on 17 May 1916, and the lowest is −1.9 °C (28.6 °F) 
on 7 February 1950, during a cold wave that brought the only recorded snowfall 
in Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv is governed by a 31-member city council elected for 
a five-year term in direct proportional elections.[112] All Israeli citizens 
over the age of 18 with at least one year of residence in Tel Aviv are 
eligible to vote in municipal elections. The municipality is responsible 
for social services, community programs, public infrastructure, urban planning, 
tourism and other local affairs.[113][114][115] The Tel Aviv City Hall 
is located at Rabin Square. Ron Huldai has been mayor of Tel Aviv since 
1998.[112] Huldai was reelected for a fourth term in the 2013 municipal 
elections, defeating Nitzan Horowitz who ran at the head of the Meretz 
list.[116] The longest serving mayor was Shlomo Lahat, who was in office 
for 19 years. The shortest serving was David Bloch, in office for two years, 
1925–27. Tel Aviv is known to be a stronghold for the left. This is especially 
true for the city's mostly affluent central and northern neighborhoods, 
though not the case for its working-class southeastern neighborhoods.[117] 
Outside the kibbutzim, Meretz receives more votes in Tel Aviv than in any 
other city in Israel.[118] Following the 2013 municipal elections, Meretz 
gain an unprecedented 6 seats on the council. However, having been reelected 
as mayor, Huldai and the Tel Aviv 1 list lead the coalition, which controls 
29 of 31 seats. In 2006, 51,359 children attended school in Tel Aviv, of 
whom 8,977 were in municipal kindergartens, 23,573 in municipal elementary 
schools, and 18,809 in high schools.[119] Sixty-four percent of students 
in the city are entitled to matriculation, more than 5 percent higher than 
the national average.[119] About 4,000 children are in first grade at schools 
in the city, and population growth is expected to raise this number to 
6,000 by 2012.[120] As a result, 20 additional kindergarten classes were 
opened in 2008–09 in the city. A new elementary school is planned north 
of Sde Dov as well as a new high school in northern Tel Aviv.[120] The 
first Hebrew high school, called Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium, was built in 
1905 on Herzl Street. Tel Aviv University, the largest university in Israel, 
is known internationally for its physics, computer science, chemistry and 
linguistics departments. Together with Bar-Ilan University in neighboring 
Ramat Gan, the student population numbers over 50,000, including a sizeable 
international community.[121][122] Its campus is located in the neighborhood 
of Ramat Aviv.[123] Tel Aviv also has several colleges.[124] The Herzliya 
Hebrew Gymnasium moved from Jaffa to Tel Aviv in 1909. The school continues 
to operate, although it has moved to Jabotinsky Street.[125] Other notable 
schools in Tel Aviv include Shevah Mofet, the second Hebrew school in the 
city, Ironi Alef High School for Arts and Alliance. Tel Aviv has a population 
of 426,138 spread over a land area of 52,000 dunams (52.0 km2) (20 mi²), 
yielding a population density of 7,606 people per square km (19,699 per 
square mile). According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), 
as of 2009[update] Tel Aviv's population is growing at an annual rate of 
0.5 percent. Jews of all backgrounds form 91.8 percent of the population, 
Muslims and Arab Christians make up 4.2 percent, and the remainder belong 
to other groups (including various Christian and Asian communities).[126] 
As Tel Aviv is a multicultural city, many languages are spoken in addition 
to Hebrew. According to some estimates, about 50,000 unregistered Asian 
foreign workers live in the city.[127] Compared with Westernised cities, 
crime in Tel Aviv is relatively low.[128] According to Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality, 
the average income in the city, which has an Unemployment Rate of 4.6%,[129] 
is 20% above the National Average.[119] The city's education standards 
are above the national average: of its 12th-grade students, 64.4 percent 
are eligible for matriculation certificates.[119] The age profile is relatively 
even, with 22.2 percent aged under 20, 18.5 percent aged 20–29, 24 percent 
aged 30–44, 16.2 percent aged between 45 and 59, and 19.1 percent older 
than 60.[130] Tel Aviv's population reached a peak in the early 1960s at 
around 390,000, falling to 317,000 in the late 1980s as high property prices 
forced families out and deterred young couples from moving in.[63] Since 
the mass immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s, population 
has steadily grown.[63] Today, the city's population is young and growing.[120] 
In 2006, 22,000 people moved to the city, while only 18,500 left,[120] 
and many of the new families had young children. The population is expected 
to reach 450,000 by 2025; meanwhile, the average age of residents fell 
from 35.8 in 1983 to 34 in 2008.[120] The population over age 65 stands 
at 14.6 percent compared with 19% in 1983.[120] Tel Aviv has 544 active 
synagogues,[131] including historic buildings such as the Great Synagogue, 
established in the 1930s.[132] In 2008, a center for secular Jewish Studies 
and a secular yeshiva opened in the city.[133] Tensions between religious 
and secular Jews before the gay pride parade ended in vandalism of a synagogue.[134] 
The number of churches has grown to accommodate the religious needs of 
diplomats and foreign workers.[135] The population was 93% Jewish, 1% Muslim, 
and 1% Christian. The remaining 5 percent were not classified by religion.[136] 
Israel Meir Lau is chief rabbi of the city.[137] Tel Aviv is an ethnically 
diverse city. The Jewish population, which forms the majority group in 
Tel Aviv consists of immigrants from all parts of the world and their descendants, 
including Ashkenazi Jews from Europe, North America, South America, Australia 
and South Africa, as well as Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews from Southern Europe, 
North Africa, India, Central Asia, West Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula. 
There are also a sizable number of Ethiopian Jews and their descendants 
living in Tel Aviv. In addition to Muslim and Arab Christian minorities 
in the city, several hundred Armenian Christians who reside in the city 
are concentrated mainly in Jaffa and some Christians from the former Soviet 
Union who immigrated to Israel with Jewish spouses and relatives. In recent 
years, Tel Aviv has received many non-Jewish migrants, students, foreign 
workers (documented and undocumented) and refugees. There are many refugees 
from African countries located in the southern part of the city.[138] Tel 
Aviv is divided into nine districts that have formed naturally over the 
city's short history. The oldest of these is Jaffa, the ancient port city 
out of which Tel Aviv grew. This area is traditionally made up demographically 
of a greater percentage of Arabs, but recent gentrification is replacing 
them with a young professional and artist population. Similar processes 
are occurring in nearby Neve Tzedek, the original Jewish neighborhood outside 
of Jaffa. Ramat Aviv, a district in the northern part of the city that 
is largely made up of luxury apartments and includes Tel Aviv University, 
is currently undergoing extensive expansion and is set to absorb the beachfront 
property of Sde Dov Airport after its decommissioning.[139] The area known 
as HaKirya is the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) headquarters and a large 
military base.[102] Moreover, in the past few years, Rothschild Boulevard 
which is located at beginning in Neve Tzedek had become an attraction both 
of tourist, businesses and startups. It features a wide, tree-lined central 
strip with pedestrian and bike lanes. Historically, there was a demographic 
split between the Ashkenazi northern side of the city, including the district 
of Ramat Aviv, and the southern, more Sephardi and Mizrahi neighborhoods 
including Neve Tzedek and Florentin.[35][unreliable source] Since the 1980s, 
major restoration and gentrification projects have been implemented in 
southern Tel Aviv.[35][unreliable source] Baruch Yoscovitz, city planner 
for Tel Aviv beginning in 2001, reworked old British plans for the Florentin 
neighborhood from the 1920s, adding green areas, pedestrian malls, and 
housing. The municipality invested two million shekels in the project. 
The goal was to make Florentin the Soho of Tel Aviv, and attract artists 
and young professionals to the neighborhood. Indeed, street artists, such 
as Dede, installation artists such as Sigalit Landau, and many others made 
the upbeat neighborhood their home base.[140][141] Florentin is now known 
as a hip, "cool" place to be in Tel Aviv with coffeehouses, markets, bars, 
galleries and parties.[142] Tel Aviv is home to different architectural 
styles that represent influential periods in its history. The early architecture 
of Tel Aviv consisted largely of European-style single-story houses with 
red-tiled roofs.[143] Neve Tzedek, the first neighborhood to be constructed 
outside of Jaffa is characterised by two-story sandstone buildings.[16] 
By the 1920s, a new eclectic Orientalist style came into vogue, combining 
European architecture with Eastern features such as arches, domes and ornamental 
tiles.[143] Municipal construction followed the "garden city" master plan 
drawn up by Patrick Geddes. Two- and three-story buildings were interspersed 
with boulevards and public parks.[143] Various architectural styles, such 
as Art Deco, classical and modernist also exist in Tel Aviv. Bauhaus architecture 
was introduced in the 1920s and 1930s by German Jewish architects who settled 
in Palestine after the rise of the Nazis. Tel Aviv's White City, around 
the city center, contains more than 5,000 Modernist-style buildings inspired 
by the Bauhaus school and Le Corbusier.[16][17] Construction of these buildings, 
later declared protected landmarks and, collectively, a UNESCO World Heritage 
Site, continued until the 1950s in the area around Rothschild Boulevard.[17][144] 
Some 3,000 buildings were created in this style between 1931 and 1939 alone.[143] 
In the 1960s, this architectural style gave way to office towers and a 
chain of waterfront hotels and commercial skyscrapers.[35] Some of the 
city's Modernist buildings were neglected to the point of ruin. Before 
legislation to preserve this landmark architecture, many of the old buildings 
were demolished. Efforts are under way to refurbish Bauhaus buildings and 
restore them to their original condition.[145] The Shalom Meir Tower, Israel's 
first skyscraper, was built in Tel Aviv in 1965 and remained the country's 
tallest building until 1999. At the time of its construction, the building 
rivaled Europe's tallest buildings in height, and was the tallest in the 
Middle East. In the mid-1990s, the construction of skyscrapers began throughout 
the entire city, altering its skyline. Before that, Tel Aviv had had a 
generally low-rise skyline.[146] However, the towers were not concentrated 
in certain areas, and were scattered at random locations throughout the 
city, creating a disjointed skyline. New neighborhoods, such as Park Tzameret, 
have been constructed to house apartment towers such as YOO Tel Aviv towers, 
designed by Philippe Starck. Other districts, such as Sarona, have been 
developed with office towers. Other recent additions to Tel Aviv's skyline 
include the 1 Rothschild Tower and First International Bank Tower.[147][148] 
As Tel Aviv celebrated its centennial in 2009,[149] the city attracted 
a number of architects and developers, including I. M. Pei, Donald Trump, 
and Richard Meier.[150] American journalist David Kaufman reported in New 
York magazine that since Tel Aviv "was named a UNESCO World Heritage site, 
gorgeous historic buildings from the Ottoman and Bauhaus era have been 
repurposed as fabulous hotels, eateries, boutiques, and design museums."[151] 
In November 2009, Haaretz reported that Tel Aviv had 59 skyscrapers more 
than 100 meters tall.[152] Currently, dozens of skyscrapers have been approved 
or are under construction throughout the city, and many more are planned. 
The tallest building approved is the Egged Tower, which would become Israel's 
tallest building upon completion.[153] According to current plans, the 
tower is planned to have 80 floors, rise to a height of 270 meters, and 
will have a 50-meter spire.[154] In 2010, the Tel Aviv Municipality's Planning 
and Construction Committee launched a new master plan for the city for 
2025. It decided not to allow the construction of any additional skyscrapers 
in the city center, while at the same time greatly increasing the construction 
of skyscrapers in the east. The ban extends to an area between the coast 
and Ibn Gabirol Street, and also between the Yarkon River and Eilat Street. 
It did not extend to towers already under construction or approved. One 
final proposed skyscraper project was approved, while dozens of others 
had to be scrapped. Any new buildings there will usually not be allowed 
to rise above six and a half stories. However, hotel towers along almost 
the entire beachfront will be allowed to rise up to 25 stories. According 
to the plan, large numbers of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings at least 
18 stories tall would be built in the entire area between Ibn Gabirol Street 
and the eastern city limits, as part of the master plan's goal of doubling 
the city's office space to cement Tel Aviv as the business capital of Israel. 
Under the plan, "forests" of corporate skyscrapers will line both sides 
of the Ayalon Highway. Further south, skyscrapers rising up to 40 stories 
will be built along the old Ottoman railway between Neve Tzedek and Florentine, 
with the first such tower there being the Neve Tzedek Tower. Along nearby 
Shlavim Street, passing between Jaffa and south Tel Aviv, office buildings 
up to 25 stories will line both sides of the street, which will be widened 
to accommodate traffic from the city's southern entrance to the center.[155][156] 
In November 2012, it was announced that to encourage investment in the 
city's architecture, residential towers throughout Tel Aviv would be extended 
in height. Buildings in Jaffa and the southern and eastern districts may 
have two and a half stories added, while those on Ibn Gabirol Street might 
be extended by seven and a half stories.[157] Tel Aviv has been ranked 
as the twenty-fifth most important financial center in the world.[7] It 
was built on sand dunes in an area unsuitable for farming. Instead, it 
developed as a hub of business and scientific research.[35][unreliable 
source] In 1926, the country's first shopping arcade, Passage Pensak, was 
built there.[158] By 1936, as tens of thousands of middle class immigrants 
arrived from Europe, Tel Aviv was already the largest city in Palestine. 
A small port was built at the Yarkon estuary, and many cafes, clubs and 
cinemas opened. Herzl Street became a commercial thoroughfare at this time.[159] 
Economic activities account for 17 percent of the GDP.[63] In 2011, Tel 
Aviv had an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent.[160] The city has been described 
as a "flourishing technological center" by Newsweek and a "miniature Los 
Angeles" by The Economist.[162][163] In 1998, the city was described by 
Newsweek as one of the 10 most technologically influential cities in the 
world. Since then, high-tech industry in the Tel Aviv area has continued 
to develop.[163] The Tel Aviv metropolitan area (including satellite cities 
such as Herzliya and Petah Tikva) is Israel's center of high-tech, sometimes 
referred to as Silicon Wadi.[163][164] Tel Aviv is home to the Tel Aviv 
Stock Exchange (TASE), Israel's only stock exchange, which has reached 
record heights since the 1990s.[165] The Tel Aviv Stock exchange has also 
gained attention for its resilience and ability to recover from war and 
disasters. For example, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange was higher on the last 
day of both the 2006 Lebanon war and the 2009 Operation in Gaza than on 
the first day of fighting[166] Many international venture-capital firms, 
scientific research institutes and high-tech companies are headquartered 
in the city. Industries in Tel Aviv include chemical processing, textile 
plants and food manufacturers.[35][unreliable source] The city's nightlife, 
cultural attractions and architecture attract tourists whose spending benefits 
the local economy.[167] In 2008, the Globalization and World Cities Study 
Group and Network (GaWC) at Loughborough University reissued an inventory 
of world cities based on their level of advanced producer services. Tel 
Aviv was ranked as a beta+ world city.[168] The Kiryat Atidim high tech 
zone opened in 1972 and the city has become a major world high tech hub. 
In December 2012, the city was ranked second on a list of top places to 
found a high tech startup company, just behind Silicon Valley.[169] In 
2013, Tel Aviv had more than 700 startup companies and research and development 
centers, and was ranked the second-most innovative city in the world, behind 
Medellín and ahead of New York City.[170] According to Forbes, nine of 
its fifteen Israeli-born billionaires live in Israel; four live in Tel 
Aviv and its suburbs.[171][172] The cost of living in Israel is high, with 
Tel Aviv being its most expensive city to live in. According to Mercer, 
a human resources consulting firm based in New York, as of 2010[update] 
Tel Aviv is the most expensive city in the Middle East and the 19th most 
expensive in the world.[164] Shopping malls in Tel Aviv include Dizengoff 
Center, Ramat Aviv Mall and Azrieli Shopping Mall and markets such as Carmel 
Market, Ha'Tikva Market, and Bezalel Market. Tel Aviv is a major center 
of culture and entertainment.[173] Eighteen of Israel's 35 major centers 
for the performing arts are located in the city, including five of the 
country's nine large theatres, where 55% of all performances in the country 
and 75 percent of all attendance occurs.[63][174] The Tel Aviv Performing 
Arts Center is home of the Israeli Opera, where Plácido Domingo was house 
tenor between 1962 and 1965, and the Cameri Theatre.[175] With 2,482 seats, 
the Tel Aviv Culture Palace is the city's largest theatre and home to the 
Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.[176] Habima Theatre, Israel's national theatre, 
was closed down for renovations in early 2008, and reopened in November 
2011 after major remodeling. Enav Cultural Center is one of the newer additions 
to the cultural scene.[174] Other theatres in Tel Aviv are the Gesher Theatre 
and Beit Lessin Theater; Tzavta and Tmuna are smaller theatres that host 
musical performances and fringe productions. In Jaffa, the Simta and Notzar 
theatres specialize in fringe as well. Tel Aviv is home to the Batsheva 
Dance Company, a world-famous contemporary dance troupe. The Israeli Ballet 
is also based in Tel Aviv.[174] Tel Aviv's center for modern and classical 
dance is the Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theatre in Neve Tzedek.[177] 
The city often hosts global musical acts such as Paul McCartney, Madonna 
and The Rolling Stones in venues such as Hayarkon Park, the Israel Trade 
Fairs & Convention Center, the Barby Club and the Zappa Club.[178][179][180] 
Opera and classical music performances are held daily in Tel Aviv, with 
many of the world's leading classical conductors and soloists performing 
on Tel Aviv stages over the years.[174] The Tel Aviv Cinematheque screens 
art movies, premieres of short and full-length Israeli films, and hosts 
a variety of film festivals, among them the Festival of Animation, Comics 
and Caricatures, "Icon" Science Fiction and Fantasy Festival, the Student 
Film Festival, the Jazz, Film and Videotape Festival and Salute to Israeli 
Cinema. The city has several multiplex cinemas.[174] Tel Aviv attracts 
over a million international visitors annually. In 2010, Knight Frank's 
world city survey ranked it 34th globally.[181] Tel Aviv has been named 
the third "hottest city for 2011" (behind only New York City and Tangier) 
by Lonely Planet, third-best in the Middle East and Africa by Travel + 
Leisure magazine (behind only Cape Town and Jerusalem), and the ninth-best 
beach city in the world by National Geographic.[182][183][184] Tel Aviv

Roberto Cavalli as a guest of honor.[197] Named "the best gay city in the 
world" by American Airlines, Tel Aviv is one of the most popular destinations 
for LGBT tourists internationally, with a large LGBT community.[198][199] 
American journalist David Kaufman has described the city as a place "packed 
with the kind of ‘we're here, we're queer’ vibe more typically found in 
Sydney and San Francisco. The city hosts its well-known pride parade, the 
biggest in Asia, attracting over 100,000 people yearly.[200] In January 
2008, Tel Aviv's municipality established the city's LGBT Community centre,

division that represents a neighborhood, the Hatikva Quarter in Tel Aviv, 
and not a city. Shimshon Tel Aviv and Beitar Tel Aviv both formerly played 
in the top division, but dropped into the lower leagues, and merged in 
2000, the new club now playing in Liga Artzit, the third tier. Another 
former first division team, Maccabi Jaffa, is now defunct, as are Maccabi

best to-skateboarding city by Transworld Skateboarding. The three largest 
newspaper companies in Israel – Yedioth Ahronoth, Maariv and Haaretz – 
are all based within the city limits.[216] Several radio stations cover 
the Tel Aviv area, including the city-based Radio Tel Aviv.[217] The three 
major Israeli television networks, Israel Broadcasting Authority, Keshet, 
Reshet, and Channel 10, are based in the city, as well as two of the most 
popular radio stations in Israel: Galatz and Galgalatz, which are both

based at Kikar Hamedina. Tel Aviv is ranked as the greenest city in Israel.[219] 
Since 2008, City lights are turned off annually in support of Earth Hour.[220] 
In February 2009, the municipality launched a water saving campaign, including 
competition granting free parking for a year to the household that is found 
to have consumed the least amount of water per person.[221] In the early 
21st century, Tel Aviv's municipality transformed a derelict power station 
into a public park, now named "Gan HaHashmal" ("Electricity Park"), paving 
the way for eco-friendly and environmentally conscious designs.[222] In 
October 2008, Martin Weyl turned an old garbage dump near Ben Gurion International 
Airport, called Hiriya, into an attraction by building an arc of plastic 
bottles.[223] The site, which was renamed Ariel Sharon Park to honor Israel's 
former prime minister, will serve as the centerpiece in what is to become 
a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) urban wilderness on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, designed 
by German landscape architect, Peter Latz.[223] At the end of the 20th 
century, the city began restoring historical neighborhoods such as Neve 
Tzedek and many buildings from the 1920s and 1930s. Since 2007, the city 
hosts its well-known, annual Open House Tel Aviv weekend, which offers 
the general public free entrance to the city's famous landmarks, private 
houses and public buildings. In 2010, the design of the renovated Tel Aviv 
Port (Nemal Tel Aviv) won the award for outstanding landscape architecture 
at the European Biennial for Landscape Architecture in Barcelona.[224] 
Tel Aviv is a major transportation hub, served by a comprehensive public 
transport network, with many major routes of the national transportation 
network running through the city. As with the rest of Israel, bus transport 
is the most common form of public transport and is very widely used. The 
Tel Aviv Central Bus Station is located in the southern part of the city. 
The main bus network in Tel Aviv metropolitan area operated by Dan Bus 
Company, Metropoline and Kavim. the Egged Bus Cooperative, Israels's largest 
bus company, provides intercity transportation.[225] The city is also served 
by local and inter-city share taxis. Many local and inter-city bus routes 
also have sherut taxis that follow the same route and display the same 
route number in their window. Fares are standardised within the region 
and are comparable to or less expensive than bus fares. Unlike other forms 
of public transport, these taxis also operate on Fridays and Saturdays 
(the Jewish sabbath "Shabbat"). Private taxis are white with a yellow sign 
on top. Fares are standardised and metered, but may be negotiated ahead 
of time with the driver. The Tel Aviv Central railway station is the main 
railway station of the city, and the busiest station in Israel. The city 
has three additional railway stations along the Ayalon Highway: Tel Aviv 
University, HaShalom (adjacent to Azrieli Center) and HaHagana (near the 
Tel Aviv Central Bus Station), Tel Aviv Mercaz. It is estimated that over 
a million passengers travel by rail to Tel Aviv monthly. The trains do 
not run on Saturday and holidays. Jaffa Railway Station was the first railway 
station in the Middle East. It served as the terminus for the Jaffa–Jerusalem 
railway. The station opened in 1891 and closed in 1948. In 2005–2009, the 
station was restored and converted into an entertainment and leisure venue 
marketed as "HaTachana", Hebrew for "the station" (see homepage here:[226]). 
The main highway leading to the city is the Ayalon Highway (Highway 20), 
which runs along the eastern side of the city from north to south along 
the Ayalon River riverbed, dividing for the most part Tel Aviv and Ramat 
Gan. Driving south on the Ayalon gives access to Highway 1, leading to 
Ben Gurion International Airport and Jerusalem. Within the city, main routes 
include Kaplan Street, Allenby Street, Ibn Gabirol Street, Dizengoff Street, 
Rothschild Boulevard, and in Jaffa the main route is Jerusalem Boulevard. 
Namir Road connects the city to Highway 2, Israel's main north–south highway, 
and Begin/Jabotinsky Road, which provides access from the east through 
Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Petah Tikva. Tel Aviv, accommodating about 500,000 commuter 
cars daily, suffers from increasing congestion. In 2007, the Sadan Report 
recommended the introduction of a congestion charge similar to that of 
London in Tel Aviv as well as other Israeli cities. Under this plan, road 
users traveling into the city would pay a fixed fee.[227] The main airport 
serving Greater Tel Aviv is Ben Gurion Airport. Located in the neighboring 
city of Lod, it is a main international airport handling over 14 million 
passengers in 2013. The airport serves both international flights and domestic 
flights, and is the main hub of El Al, Arkia, Israir Airlines and Sun D'Or. 
The airport is 15 kilometres (9 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, on Highway 1 
between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Another airport in the Tel Aviv area, Sde 
Dov (IATA: SDV), in northwestern Tel Aviv close to Tel Aviv Port, serves 
mainly domestic flights and may be closed in favor of real-estate development.[228] 
In the future all services to Sde Dov will be transferred to Ben Gurion 
Airport. The first line of a light rail system is under construction and 
scheduled to open in 2020.[229] The Red Line starts at Petah Tikva's Central 
Bus Station, east of Tel Aviv and follows the Jabotinsky Road (Route 481) 
westwards at street level. At the point where Jabotinsky Road and Highway 
4 intersect the line drops into an underground tunnel for 10 km (6.21 mi) 
through Bnei Brak, Ramat Gan and Tel Aviv and emerges again to street level 
just before Jaffa, where it turns southwards towards Bat Yam. The underground 
section will include 10 stations, including an interchange with Israel 
Railways services at Tel Aviv Central Railway Station and the nearby 2000 
Terminal. A maintenance depot, connected via a branch line and tunnel to 
the main section of the line, will be constructed in Kiryat Arye, across 
from the existing Kiryat Arye suburban railway station. The intended builder 
and operator of the first line, MTS, has had financial difficulties that 
postponed the line's opening. In May 2010, the ministry of finance decided 
to cancel the agreement with MTS due to the difficulties and the agreement 
was cancelled in August 2010.[230] The line is being built instead by NTA 
– The Tel Aviv region's mass transit development authority. Initially, 
the line's targeted opening was in 2012 and today the target is 2016 after 
several postponements due to the disagreements with MTS and NTA's takeover 
of the project. The second line is scheduled to open in 2021. The Tel Aviv 
municipality is currently working on building a SkyTran system across the 
city, under which light, two-person cars will be transported along elevated 
magnetic levitation tracks. Initially, a SkyTran loop will be built around 
the campus of Israel Aerospace Industries, followed by a commercial network 
around the city. This will be the pilot project of the SkyTran system, 
which is planning other such projects around the world.[231] Tel Aviv Municipality 
encourages the use of bicycles in the city. Plans called for expansion 
of the paths to 100 kilometers (62.1 mi) by 2009.[232] As of April 2011 
the municipality has completed construction of the planned 100 kilometres 
(62 miles) of bicycle paths. In April 2011, Tel Aviv municipality launched 
Tel-O-Fun, a bicycle sharing system, in which 150 stations of bicycles 
for rent were installed within the city limits.[233] As of October 2011, 
there are 125 active stations, providing more than 1,000 bicycles. Asia
