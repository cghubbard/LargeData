Early history of baseball in San Francisco, California. It has been speculated 
that the game of baseball was played in California by men during the Gold 
Rush of 1849 when Alexander Cartwright, who is sometimes referred to as 
"the father of baseball", came to San Francisco and is reported to have 
brought his baseball to the city in 1849.[1][2] The Daily Alta California 
newspaper reports a game of base ball being played upon the Plaza (Portsmouth 
Square) "by a number of the sporting gentlemen about town", on February 
3, 1851.[3] Mention of the play of a game of Townball at Portmouth Square 
is recorded in The Daily Alta California newspaper on January 14, 1852.[1][4] 
An early town leader serving on the city council as second alcalde, or 
assistant mayor, of San Francisco during the years 1849-1854 was Frank 
Turk a New York Knickerbocker.[1][5] According to historian Frank Joel, 
baseball was formally introduced into California, at San Francisco in 1859.[6] 
In the 1860s baseball grew in prominence in San Francisco, with the first 
game reported to be between the Eagles and the Red Rovers on February 22, 
1860.[2] The San Francisco Directory in 1860 identifies three base ball 
clubs, the Eagle, Em Quad, and Excelsior Clubs.[7] In 1867 it was reported 
that "baseball clubs are now the rage" and the game of baseball drew plaudits 
from influential quarters. That year marked the establishment of the first 
baseball league in San Francisco known as the Pacific Coast Base Ball Convention 
with play 14 clubs from San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Clara county. 
The San Francisco clubs were named the Eagles, Pacifics, Lafayettes, Knickerbockers, 
Atlantics, Bay City, Empires, Brodericks[8] and the Cosmopolitans. The 
1867 championship game, between the Atlantic and Cosmopolitan clubs, was 
won by the Cosmopolitans by a score 50 to 45 on April 27, 1867.[9] In the 
1870s additional teams were named the Libertys, Wide Awakes (Oakland), 
Alhambra, Americans, Excelciors and the San Franciscos.[10] California's 
and San Francisco's first enclosed professional baseball park, located 
in the heavily Irish workingman Mission District, was named simply 'The 
Recreation Grounds' and opened November 26, 1868 [11][12][13][14] and operated 
until November 23, 1884.[15] Built on the site of the Pioneer Race Course, 
a horse race track owned by George Treat, and the facility was used for 
multi-purposes including base ball games and cricket matches as early as 
October 1860.[16] The grandstand accommodated initially a capacity of 12,000 
fans and was later expanded to hold 17,000.[17] Home of the Pacific Baseball 
League beginning in 1878, was owned an operated by the politically active 
Captain Al Fritz of the influential Workingman's Party of California in 
partnership with Samuel Shear on land leased from San Francisco Mayor Andrew 
J. Bryant.[18] In the later years after the death of Fritz, the Recreation 
Grounds was leased by Waller Walace and Andy Pierce for organized ball 
play with the preeminent team of that era being the Haverlys.[19] In 1879 
league play included a new Military League, organized by newspaper reporter 
Joseph H. McCloskey, drawn from teams of local militias which were generally 
aligned along ethnic lines.[20] The period of 1881 to 1886 saw league play 
from the California League which failed to achieve much organizational 
competence, during the year 1883 for instance, there was only 36 games 
among four teams.[21] The location of this ballpark bordered Harrison, 
Twenty-Fifth, Folsom and Twenty-Sixth Streets, including present day Garfield 
Square. Photo. Other teams playing in Recreation Grounds included the Eagles, 
Wide Awakes, Niantics, Woonsockets and the Reddingtons. 37°45′2.63″N 122°24′49.33″W﻿

League, which was moved the following year for play at a new baseball park 
in the Haight District. With grandstands seating 14,000 and located at
