As a player As a coach Kevin Lee Seitzer (/ˈsaɪtsər/; born March 26, 1962) 
is an American former third baseman in Major League Baseball with the Kansas 
City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers, Oakland Athletics, and Cleveland Indians.[1] 
He is currently the hitting coach for the Atlanta Braves, having also coached 
for the Royals, the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Toronto Blue Jays. After 
starring at Eastern Illinois University, Seitzer was drafted by the Royals 
in the 11th round of the 1983 draft.[2] Seitzer made his big-league debut 
as a September call-up in 1986 with the Royals. He made it to the majors 
to stay in 1987, where he started the season as the Royals' regular first 
baseman. He traded positions with Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett 
later in the season, in hopes of reducing Brett's chances of injury. Seitzer 
hit .323 with 15 home runs and 207 hits (tying the MLB record) in his rookie 
1987 season and, though overshadowed by fellow rookie teammate Bo Jackson, 
he was selected to the American League All-Star team. Seitzer also became 
one of only (currently) three Royals to collect six hits in a nine-inning 
game, which he did on August 2 of that year in a 13-5 victory over the 
Boston Red Sox at Royals Stadium; two of those hits were home runs. He 
joined Bob Oliver in 1969 (the franchise's inaugural season) in accomplishing 
this feat; Joe Randa would join them in 2004. Seitzer finished the 1987 
season as the runner-up for the American League Rookie of the Year award, 
behind the Oakland A's Mark McGwire. He holds Royal rookie records in games 
(161), hits (207), singles (151) and walks (80) and is tied with Carlos 
Beltrán in extra-base hits (56) and total bases (301). He led the league 
in hits, singles and plate appearances (725). He ranks eighth on the Royals 
all-time list with 369 walks while his .380 career on-base percentage as 
a Royals is second all-time. He is one of six players in Royals history 
to top the 200 hits mark in a season (207 in 1987). He appeared in the 
postseason twice with the Indians in 1996 and 1997, appearing in the 1997 
World Series for the Tribe against Florida. After subsequent seasons of 
.304, .281, .275, and .265, the Royals released Seitzer during spring training 
in 1992. He signed with Milwaukee, who installed him as their regular third 
baseman. In 1993 Seitzer became a free agent, signed with Oakland and after 
a slow start was released at the All Star break that season. He then resigned 
with Milwaukee, solidified himself as an everyday player, and again made 
the All-Star team in 1995. He enjoyed what many feel was his best season 
in 1996 with the Brewers and Cleveland Indians. Seitzer batted .326 with 
13 home runs and 78 RBI in '96 while posting a career-high .416 on-base 
percentage. In two postseason appearances with Cleveland, mostly coming 
off the bench, he hit .192 with a double, one run scored and four runs 
batted in. He retired following the 1997 season with a career batting average 
of .295. During the final years of his career, Seitzer wore an attachment 
to his batting helmet called a C-flap which was an extra piece of plastic 
attached to the ear flap that covered the left side of his jaw. He was 
forced to wear this protection after being hit in the face twice by a pitch; 
once in 1994 and again in 1995. The helmet evidently did not obscure his 
batting eye, as he wore it for the rest of his career. On October 27, 2006, 
Seitzer was named hitting coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Seitzer was 
replaced by Rick Schu on July 11, 2007 as the Diamondbacks' hitting coach.[3] 
On February 7, 2009, Seitzer was named hitting coach of the Kansas City 
Royals.[4] On October 4, 2012, the Royals announced Seitzer's contract 
would not be renewed. Seitzer was hired by the Toronto Blue Jays to be 
their hitting coach on October 31, 2013.[5] He joined the Braves in the 
same role on October 27, 2014.[6] Seitzer and his wife, Beth, reside in 
Leawood, Kansas. They have four sons, Tyler, Brandon, Nick and Cameron. 
They have two grandsons, Weston and Max. His step-son Nick Graffeo was 
drafted as a pitcher by the Kansas City Royals in the 2010 draft.[9] He 
was released on March 29, 2013 by the Royals.[10] His son Cameron is an 
infielder in the Tampa Bay Rays organization.[11] Seitzer owns and operates 
a baseball and softball training facility in Kansas City, Missouri called 
Mac-N-Seitz Baseball and Softball with former Royals teammate Mike Macfarlane.[12]
