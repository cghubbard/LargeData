Game 6 (stylized as Game6) is a 2005 American film directed by Michael 
Hoffman, first presented at the Sundance Film Festival, released in the 
United States in 2006, and starring Michael Keaton. It follows a fictional 
playwright, Nicky Rogan, on the day he has a new stage play opening which 
is also the same day as the sixth game of the 1986 World Series is played. 
It realizes a 1991 screenplay by Don DeLillo, with a soundtrack written 
and performed by Yo La Tengo. Nicky Rogan has written several plays and 
has achieved success. It is now opening night of his latest effort, and 
all around him assure him that this one will be the best yet. But as opening 
hour approaches, Rogan falls prey to doubts and fears, egged on by another 
playwright whose last work was trashed by the local newspaper's new drama 
critic, Steven Schwimmer. He eventually lets those fears drive him to adopt 
a resolve to kill the critic (who he assumes will also trash his play), 
and he procures a handgun with which to perform the deed. Instead of attending 
the play's opening night Rogan spends the time in a bar, accompanied by 
a lady cab driver and her grandson; earlier in the evening the lady misidentified 
Rogan as a local small-time hoodlum, and Rogan does not correct her misidentification. 
They watch the most crucial Game 6 of the World Series playoff between 
the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets. The Sox had won 3 games and could 
clinch the title by winning Game 6, but Rogan, a lifelong Sox fan, knows 
how easily they can lose when they should win. He spends the evening waiting 
for the inevitable, even though the Sox are ahead most of the time. When 
the inevitable does occur (due to an unexpected pair of errors at the end 
of the final inning), he snaps, and heads out to take out his rage on the 
newspaper critic. He not only finds the critic, but finds him in the early 
stages of deflowering the playwright's daughter. He begins firing wildly, 
but is finally calmed when he learns that the critic is equally devastated 
by the Sox's loss. They end up together, watching an interminable rerun 
of the final error on a small television set in the critic's apartment. 
The film was made as an independent effort, largely as a labor of love, 
with all the "name" players working for little more than scale (Keaton's 
salary was $100/day, for instance). Filming was completed in 20 days, and 
the filming budget was $500,000. Most of the filming occurred in New York 
City. Based on 38 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten 
Tomatoes, 58% of critics gave Game 6 a positive review, with an average 
rating of 5.9/10.[1] Leonard Maltin gave the film two and a half stars,
