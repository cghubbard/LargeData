As player As manager Robert Raymond Boone (born November 19, 1947) is an 
American former catcher and manager in Major League Baseball who was a 
four-time All-Star. Born in San Diego, California, Bob Boone is the son 
of a major league player, the late third baseman Ray Boone, and the father 
of two major leaguers: former second baseman Bret Boone and former utility 
infielder Aaron Boone. All four family members were named All-Stars during 
their careers. Bob Boone was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 
sixth round of the 1969 amateur draft after attending Stanford University, 
where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity. He was brought to the 
majors in late 1972, and, while he never had excellent hitting numbers, 
he was a phenomenal defensive catcher, committing only eight errors and 
allowing only three passed balls in the 1977 season. He made the National 
League All-Star team three times in a Phillies uniform, and helped the 
team win the 1980 World Series. In 1982, the Phillies decided to trade 
the veteran catcher to the California Angels, following an unproductive 
year from Boone, and also as a possible retaliation for Boone's key role 
in leading the players in negotiations during the 1981 Major League Baseball 
strike. But Boone rebounded by throwing out 21 of the first 34 steal attempts 
and helping the Angels to the AL West title, and followed in 1983 with 
his fourth and final All-Star appearance. On September 30, 1984, Boone 
caught Mike Witt's perfect game.[1] Boone stayed with the Angels for seven 
seasons and was let go in 1988. As a free agent, he signed with the Kansas 
City Royals, but a broken finger in 1990 led to his retirement at age 42 
following his shortened season. Boone was a career .254 hitter with 105 
home runs and 826 RBI in 2,264 games. He was selected an All-Star in 1976, 
1978â€“79, and 1983. He was one of the top defensive catchers of his era, 
winning seven Gold Glove awards. Boone caught 2,225 games in a 19-year 
Major League career, a record which was later broken by Carlton Fisk (2,226). 
He caught 117 shutouts during his career, ranking him 14th all-time among 
major league catchers.[2] He returned to the Royals in 1995 as the manager 
of the team, but was let go during the 1997 season after a third straight 
sub-.500 season. In 2001, he was hired to be the skipper of the Cincinnati 
Reds, replacing Jack McKeon. However, after another two and a half sub-.500 
seasons, the Reds fired Bob Boone on July 28, 2003. In 2005, Boone was 
inducted into the Phillies Wall of Fame. He currently serves as Assistant 
General Manager and Vice President of Player Development for the Washington 
Nationals. Besides his baseball family, Bob and his family are descendants 
of American pioneer Daniel Boone[3] Bob Boone and his wife, Susan Boone, 
have 3 sons. Two of his sons, Aaron Boone and Bret Boone, were former Major 
League Baseball players.[4] Bob Boone's extended family are considered 
sportsmen. His mother, Patsy Boone, was a synchronized swimmer who swam 
with Esther Williams in the movies. His sister Terry Boone was a champion 
swimmer, and his brother Rod Boone was a college baseball star who played
