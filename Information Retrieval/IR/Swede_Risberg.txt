Charles August "Swede" Risberg (October 13, 1894 â€“ October 13, 1975) was 
a Major League Baseball shortstop. He played for the Chicago White Sox 
from 1917 to 1920. He is best known for his involvement in the 1919 Black 
Sox scandal. Charles Risberg was born and raised in San Francisco, California. 
He had very little education growing up and dropped out of school in the 
third grade. However, he soon developed a reputation as a good semipro 
pitcher and began his professional baseball career in 1912. Risberg soon 
converted to shortstop. In 1914, he hit .366 in the Class D Union Association[1] 
and was acquired by the Venice Tigers of the Pacific Coast League. He was 
the club's utility infielder in 1915 and 1916, gaining acclaim for his 
defensive skills. He was then bought by the American League's Chicago White 
Sox in early 1917.[2] Risberg made his debut on April 11, 1917 for the 
White Sox. He was a below-average hitter, but due to his superb defensive 
abilities, he won the full-time job at shortstop. Late in the season, though, 
Risberg went into a terrible slump, and he therefore only pinch hit twice 
when the Sox beat the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series.[2] The 
next season, Risberg briefly returned to California to work in a shipyard 
as part of the war effort. Although his job was termed essential and enabled 
him to avoid the draft, it consisted largely of playing baseball, as he 
batted .308 for the shipyard ballclub.[2] Risberg returned to the Sox for 
the pennant-winning 1919 season. In September, he received good press in 
the Atlanta Constitution, which labeled him a "miracle man" who had "blossomed 
out as a wonder" after making four plays that were "phenomenal."[2] Chicago 
was heavy favorites in 1919 World Series versus the Cincinnati Reds. However, 
a group of White Sox players, including Risberg, decided to intentionally 
lose the series in exchange for monetary payments from a network of gamblers. 
Risberg was one of the ringleaders, helping to convince some of his teammates 
to go along with the scheme. In the eight-game series, he went 2 for 25 
at the plate and made a Series-record eight errors. Risberg received $15,000 
for his role in the fix,[2] which was over four times his regular season 
salary. The scandal broke in late 1920, and though the eight players were 
acquitted in the trial that followed, they were all banned from organized 
baseball by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.[3] Risberg continued 
to play semi-pro baseball for a decade after his banishment. According 
to one source, "he came to Minnesota in 1922 with a traveling team called 
the Mesaba Range Black Sox, which featured three other members of the 1919 
Black Sox team: Happy Felsch and Lefty Williams."[4] He played throughout 
the midwest United States and Canada. Columbus, North Dakota newspaper 
reports claimed that Risberg played part of the 1927 season with a traveling 
team called Dellage's Cubans based in Lignite, North Dakota. In 1926, Risberg 
was called to testify about a 1919 gambling scandal involving Ty Cobb and 
Tris Speaker. Although he presented no evidence regarding the 1919 scandal, 
he claimed that in 1917 he had collected money from other White Sox players 
to give to the Detroit Tigers so the Tigers would intentionally lose some 
games. However, his story was contradicted by over 30 other men, and it 
was disregarded.[2] Risberg also worked on a dairy farm. After his outlaw 
baseball career ended, he eventually ran a tavern and lumber business in 
the northwest United States. During his playing days, he had been spiked 
by an opposing player; the injury never properly healed, and he eventually 
had to have his leg amputated.[2] At the end of his life, he lived with 
his son[4] and remained an avid baseball fan. Risberg died in Red Bluff, 
California, in 1975, on his 81st birthday. He was the last living Black 
Sox player.[2] Risberg would be portrayed by actor Don Harvey in the 1988
