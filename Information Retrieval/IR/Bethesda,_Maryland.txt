Bethesda is a census-designated place in southern Montgomery County, Maryland, 
just northwest of the United States capital of Washington, D.C. It takes 
its name from a local church, the Bethesda Meeting House (1820, rebuilt 
1849), which in turn took its name from Jerusalem's Pool of Bethesda.[2] 
(In Aramaic, ܒܝܬ ܚܣܕܐ beth ḥesda means "House of Mercy" and in Hebrew, 
בית חסד "beit ḥesed" means "House of Kindness".) The National Institutes 
of Health main campus and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center 
are in Bethesda, as are a number of corporate and government headquarters. 
In 2014 it placed first in Forbes's list of America's most educated small 
towns[3] and first on Time's list of top earning towns.[4] As an unincorporated 
area, Bethesda has no official boundaries. The United States Census Bureau 
defines a census-designated place named Bethesda whose center is located 
at 38°59′N 77°7′W﻿ / ﻿38.983°N 77.117°W﻿ / 38.983; -77.117. The United 
States Geological Survey has defined Bethesda as an area whose center is 
at 38°58′50″N 77°6′2″W﻿ / ﻿38.98056°N 77.10056°W﻿ / 38.98056; -77.10056, 
slightly different from the Census Bureau's definition. Other definitions 
are used by the Bethesda Urban Planning District, the United States Postal 
Service (which defines Bethesda to comprise the zip codes 20810, 20811, 
20813, 20814, 20815, 20816, and 20817), and other organizations. According 
to estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2013, the community 
had a total population of 63,374. Most of Bethesda's residents are in Maryland 
Legislative District 16. Bethesda is situated along a major thoroughfare 
that was originally the route of an ancient Native American trail. Henry 
Fleet, an English fur trader, was the first European to travel to the area, 
which he reached by sailing up the Potomac River. After staying for two 
years with the Piscataway tribe—either as a guest or prisoner—he returned 
to England, spoke of potential riches in fur and gold, and won funding 
for another North American expedition.[5] Most early settlers in Maryland 
were tenant farmers who paid their rent in tobacco. The extractive nature 
of tobacco farming meant that colonists continued to push farther north 
in search of fertile land, and in 1694 Henry Darnell surveyed a 710-acre 
area that became the first land grant in present-day Bethesda.[5] Rural 
tobacco farming was the primary way of life in Bethesda throughout the 
1700s; while the establishment of Washington D.C. in 1790 deprived Montgomery 
County of Georgetown, its economic center, the event had little effect 
on the small farmers throughout Bethesda.[5] Between 1805 and 1821, the 
area of present-day Bethesda became a rural way station after development 
of a toll road, the Washington and Rockville Turnpike, which carried tobacco 
and other products between Georgetown and Rockville, and north to Frederick. 
A small settlement grew around a store and tollhouse along the turnpike. 
By 1862, the community was known as "Darcy's Store" after the owner of 
a local establishment, William E. Darcy. The settlement was renamed in 
1871 by the new postmaster, Robert Franck, after the Bethesda Meeting House, 
a Presbyterian church built in 1820 on the present site of the Cemetery 
of the Bethesda Meeting House. The church burned in 1849 and was rebuilt 
the same year about 100 yards south at its present site.[6] Throughout 
most of the 19th century, Bethesda never developed beyond a small crossroads 
village, consisting of a post office, a blacksmith shop, a church and school, 
and a few houses and stores. It was not until the installation of a streetcar 
line in 1890 and the beginnings of suburbanization in the early 1900s that 
Bethesda began to grow in population. Until that time, dependence on proximity 
to rail lines insulated Bethesda from growth, even as surrounding communities 
located directly on these lines blossomed. The arrival of the personal 
automobile ended this dependency, and Bethesda planners grew the community 
with the newest transportation revolution in mind.[5] Subdivisions began 
to appear on old farmland, becoming the neighborhoods of Drummond, Woodmont, 
Edgemoor, and Battery Park. Further north, several wealthy men made Rockville 
Pike famous for its mansions. These included Brainard W. Parker ("Cedarcroft", 
1892), James Oyster ("Strathmore", 1899), George E. Hamilton ("Hamilton 
House", 1904; now the Stone Ridge School), Luke I. Wilson ("Tree Tops", 
1926), Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor ("Wild Acres", 1928–29), and George Freeland 
Peter ("Stone House", 1930). In 1930, Dr Armistead Peter's pioneering manor 
house "Winona" (1873) became the clubhouse of the original Woodmont Country 
Club (on land that is now part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
campus). Merle Thorpe's mansion, "Pook's Hill" (1927, razed 1948)—on the 
site of the current neighborhood of the same name—became the home-in-exile 
of the Norwegian Royal Family during World War II.[6] That war, and the 
expansion of government that it created, further fed the rapid expansion 
of Bethesda. Both the National Naval Medical Center (1940–42) and the NIH 
complex (1948) were built just to the north of the developing downtown. 
This, in turn, drew further government contractors, medical professionals, 
and other businesses to the area. In recent years, Bethesda has consolidated 
as the major urban core and employment center of southwestern Montgomery 
County.[6] This recent growth has been significantly vigorous following 
the expansion of Metrorail with a station in Bethesda in 1984. Alan Kay 
built the Bethesda Metro Center over the Red line metro rail which opened 
up further commercial and residential development in the immediate vicinity.[7] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area 
of 13.2 square miles (34 km2). 13.1 square miles (34 km2) of it is land 
and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it (0.38%) is water. The main commercial 
corridor that runs through Bethesda is Maryland Route 355 (known as Wisconsin 
Avenue in Bethesda and as Rockville Pike and Hungerford Drive in more northern 
communities), which, to the north, connects Bethesda with the communities 
of North Bethesda and Rockville, ending, after several name changes, in 
Frederick, Maryland. Toward the South, Rockville Pike becomes Wisconsin 
Avenue near the NIH Campus and continues beyond Bethesda through Chevy 
Chase, Friendship Heights and into Washington, D.C., ending in Georgetown. 
The area commonly known as "Downtown Bethesda" is centered at the intersection 
of Wisconsin Avenue, Old Georgetown Road and East-West Highway. Other focal 
points of downtown Bethesda include the Woodmont Triangle, bordered by 
Old Georgetown Road (Maryland Route 187), Woodmont and Rugby Avenues, and 
the Bethesda Row, centered at the intersection of Woodmont Avenue and Bethesda 
Avenue. Much of the dense construction in that area followed the opening 
of the Bethesda station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro rapid transit 
system, also located at this intersection and the centerpiece of the Bethesda 
Metro Center development. The Medical Center Metro stop lies about 0.7 
miles north of the Bethesda stop, Medical Center, which serves the NIH 
Campus, the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and the Uniformed 
Services University of the Health Sciences. As of the census[9] of 2000, 
there were 55,277 people, 23,659 households, and 14,455 families residing 
in the CDP. The population density was 4,205.8 inhabitants per square mile 
(1,624.2/km²). There were 24,368 housing units at an average density of 
1,854.1 per square mile (716.0/km²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 85.86%

were 23,659 households out of which 28.0% had children under the age of 
18 living with them, 53.4% were married couples living together, 6.0% had 
a female householder with no husband present, and 38.9% were non-families. 
32.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.6% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.30 and the average family size was 2.92. In the CDP the population 
was spread out with 21.8% under the age of 18, 4.6% from 18 to 24, 29.2% 
from 25 to 44, 27.1% from 45 to 64, and 17.2% who were 65 years of age 
or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females there were 
87.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.0 males. 
Bethesda is a very wealthy and well-educated area. According to the 2000 
Census, Bethesda was the best-educated city in the United States of America 
with a population of 50,000 or more. 79% of residents 25 or older have 
bachelor's degrees and 49% have graduate or professional degrees. According 
to a 2007 estimate,[10] the median income for a household in the CDP was 
$117,723, and the median income for a family was $168,385. Males had a 
median income of $84,797 versus $57,569 for females. The per capita income 
for the CDP was $58,479. About 1.7% of families and 3.3% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 1.8% of those under age 18 and 4.1% 
of those age 65 or over. Many commute to Washington D.C. for work. The 
average price of a four bedroom, two bath home in Bethesda in 2010 was 
$806,817 (which ranks it as the twentieth most expensive community in America).[11] 
Bethesda is often associated with its neighboring communities, Potomac, 
Maryland, Chevy Chase, Maryland, Great Falls, Virginia, and McLean, Virginia 
for their similar demographics. In April 2009, Forbes ranked Bethesda second 
on its list of "America's Most Livable Cities."[12] In October 2009, based
