Jesús María Rojas Alou (born March 24, 1942) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. During a 15-year baseball career, he played for the San Francisco 
Giants (1963–68), Houston Astros (1969–73; 1978–79), Oakland Athletics 
(1973–74), and New York Mets (1975). He was the youngest of the trio of 
baseball-playing brothers that included Felipe and Matty. Alou was considered 
a better prospect than either of his brothers and received a $4,000 signing 
bonus. He made his debut at the end of 1963, and his first game, on September 
10, was notable in that all three Alou brothers batted in the same inning 
(they were retired in order). Five days later, for the first time, the 
three played in the outfield for the Giants at the same time.[1] In his 
first full year of Major League action in 1964, Alou failed to live up 
to expectations, hitting only .274 with little power, but on July 10, he 
went 6–6 with five singles and a home run. Alou was selected by the Montreal 
Expos in the 1968 MLB expansion draft and then was dealt to Houston. He 
had his most active season there, hitting .306 in 487 at-bats, but with 
few walks and little power. He was traded to the Athletics midway through 
the 1973 season, and served as a bench player on two World Series championship 
teams. Alou was released by the A's before the 1975 season, failed to catch 
on with the Mets and Córdoba of the Mexican League in short stints, and 
did not return to the majors until Houston signed him in 1978. He responded 
by hitting .324 in part-time action and became a player-coach the following 
year before retiring. Alou later served as a scout for the Expos, then 
moved to the Florida Marlins as the club's director of Dominican operations. 
He has held the same post with the Boston Red Sox since the 2002 season. 
Jesús Alou was awarded the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame 
Pioneer Award at a pre-game ceremony at Minute Maid Park, on September
