As player As coach As manager Bruce Edward Kimm (born June 29, 1951) is 
an American former professional baseball catcher, manager and coach. He 
played all or part of four seasons in Major League Baseball for the Detroit 
Tigers, Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox between 1976 until 1980. Although 
born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Kimm grew up in Norway, Iowa, and was a star 
player on the celebrated Norway High School baseball teams, all of which 
played in state championships during his high school days. He was a three-time 
all-state player in baseball and selected in the 7th round of the 1969 
amateur draft by the White Sox, signing in his senior year of high school. 
Kimm made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers on May 4, 1976, 
where he was Mark Fidrych's personal catcher in 1976 and 1977. He played 
his final major league game on September 19, 1980. Kimm began his managerial 
career in the Tigers organization in 1982. In 1995, he won Manager of the 
Year honors in the AA Southern League, compiling a 76–67 record with the 
Orlando Cubs en route to a playoff appearance. Kimm has also managed within 
the Cincinnati Reds organization. He managed in the minor leagues for five 
and a half seasons from 1982 to 2002, compiling a 405–382 record. After 
the 2002 Chicago Cubs started the season with a 34–49 record, then-manager 
Don Baylor was fired and replaced on an interim basis by Kimm (though bench 
coach Rene Lachemann managed one game on July 5 prior to Kimm's arrival), 
who had been managing the Cubs' AAA affiliate. This caused some controversy, 
as former Tampa Bay Devil Rays manager and then Cubs pitching coach Larry 
Rothschild was seen by some as a better choice. Kimm did not fare much 
better than Baylor, as the Cubs went 33–45 for the rest of the season. 
His departure was announced before the final game of the season; he was 
replaced by Dusty Baker. In 2003, Kimm was a third base coach for Chicago's 
other MLB team, the White Sox. Kimm has also been a coach for the Cincinnati 
Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Diego Padres, Florida Marlins, Chicago White
