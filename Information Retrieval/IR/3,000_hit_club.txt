In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 3,000 hit club is the group of batters 
who have collected 3,000 or more regular-season hits in their careers. 
Cap Anson was the first to join the club on July 18, 1897, although his 
precise career hit total is unclear.[a] Two players—Nap Lajoie and Honus 
Wagner—reached 3,000 hits during the 1914 season. Ty Cobb became the club's 
fourth member in 1921 and became the first player in MLB history to reach 
4,000 hits in 1927, ultimately finishing his career with more than 4,100.[7][b] 
Cobb, also MLB's all-time career batting average leader, remained the MLB 
hit leader until September 11, 1985, when Pete Rose collected his 4,192nd 
hit.[11] Rose, the current record holder, finished his career with 4,256 
hits, an achievement that on its own would have qualified him for the Hall 
of Fame had Major League Baseball not banned him for life due to Rose's 
having gambled on games as a manager. Roberto Clemente's career ended with 
precisely 3,000 hits, reaching the mark in the last at bat of his career.[12][13][c] 
Ichiro Suzuki is the most recent player to reach the milestone, achieving 
the feat on August 7, 2016.[16] In total, 30 players have reached the 3,000 
hit mark in MLB history. Of these, 15 were right-handed batters, 13 were 
left-handed, and two were switch hitters, meaning they could bat from either 
side of the plate. Ten of these players have played for only one major 
league team. Five players—Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Eddie Murray, Rafael 
Palmeiro, and Alex Rodriguez—are also members of the 500 home run club. 
At .367, Cobb holds the highest career batting average among club members, 
while Cal Ripken Jr. holds the lowest at .276. Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter, 
and Wade Boggs are the only players to hit a home run for their 3,000th 
hit and Paul Molitor and Ichiro Suzuki are the only players to hit a triple 
for their 3,000th; all others hit a single or double. Craig Biggio was 
thrown out at second base attempting to stretch his 3,000th hit, a single, 
into a double.[17] Biggio and Jeter are the only players to join the club 
in a game where they had five hits; Jeter reached base safely in all of 
his at bats.[18] Baseball writer Josh Pahigian wrote that membership in 
the club has been "long considered the greatest measure of superior bat 
handling."[19] Reaching 3,000 hits is often described as a guarantee of 
eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[20][21][22] All eligible 
club members, with the exception of Palmeiro, have been elected to the 
Hall, and since 1962 all club members who have been inducted were elected 
on the first ballot, except for Biggio. Rose is ineligible for the Hall 
of Fame because he was permanently banned from baseball in 1989.[23][24] 
After 4 years on the ballot, Palmeiro failed to be named on 5% of ballots 
in 2014 and his name will be off the ballot for future elections.[25] The 
only active player on this list is Suzuki. Italics denotes active player
