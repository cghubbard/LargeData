Patrick Joseph "Patsy" Donovan (March 16, 1865 – December 25, 1953) was 
an Irish-American right fielder and manager in Major League Baseball who 
played for several teams from 1890 to 1907, most notably the Pittsburg 
Pirates[1] and St. Louis Cardinals. He batted .300 lifetime and set a major 
league record for career games in right field, as well as retiring among 
the career leaders in total games (5th, 1813), assists (9th, 264) and double 
plays (5th, 69) as an outfielder. Donovan batted and threw left-handed. 
Born in Queenstown, County Cork, Donovan established himself as the most 
successful Irish-born major leaguer. He broke into organized baseball in 
1886 with the Lawrence, Massachusetts team in the New England League. In 
1888 and 1889, Donovan played outfield for the London Tecumsehs of the 
International Association at Tecumseh Park (today's Labatt Park) in London, 
Ontario, Canada, where, in his first season in 1888, he led the league 
in batting with a .359 batting average (according to the Donovan family 
Web site; however, the London Tecumsehs' official scorer C. J. Moorehead, 
in a 1903 copy of The London Advertiser, cited Donovan's 1888 batting average 
as .398), had 201 hits, scored 103 runs and stole 80 bases. His second 
season with the Tecumsehs was less successful due to a leg injury. In 1890 
he made his major league debut in the National League (NL) with the Boston 
Beaneaters, and moved to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms in midseason; it would 
be the only time in his career that he played for a league champion. In 
1891 he played in the American Association (AA) for the Louisville Colonels 
and Washington Statesmen; he then returned to the NL in 1892, first with 
the Senators (the former Statesmen, who had joined the NL in a league merger) 
before going to the Pirates for most of the year. Donovan starred with 
the Pirates from 1893 through 1899, notching six consecutive seasons batting 
.300 and serving as player-manager in 1897 and 1899. The team was sold 
late in 1899, during a time when the league was contracting from twelve 
teams to eight; new owner Barney Dreyfuss brought in Fred Clarke to be 
manager, with Donovan being sent to the Cardinals. He played for St. Louis 
from 1900–1903, sharing the league lead in stolen bases (45) in his first 
season, also managing the team in his last three seasons with them. By 
the end of the 1903 season he ranked among the NL's top ten career leaders 
in hits and at bats, though he would drop from among the leaders before 
his playing career ended. His 64 career double plays in the NL ranked one 
behind Jimmy Ryan's league record. He then served as player-manager for 
the American League's Washington Senators in 1904, his last season as a 
regular. In 1903, he broke Sam Thompson's major league record of 1401 games 
in right field; Willie Keeler passed him in 1906, before Donovan played 
his last several games and retired with a total of 1620. In 1906, he became 
manager of the Brooklyn Superbas, and made his last few playing appearances 
that year, along with one more game at the end of the 1907 season. In a 
17-season playing career, Donovan had 2246 hits, 1318 runs, 16 home runs 
and 736 runs batted in in 1821 games, along with 207 doubles and 75 triples. 
Donovan collected 302 stolen bases from 1890 to 1897, and 216 more after 
the statistic was revised to its modern definition in 1898. Donovan joined 
the Boston Red Sox as a scout in 1909, and managed the team in 1910 and 
1911. As a major league manager, he compiled a 684-879 record (.438) in 
11 seasons. He was also instrumental in bringing Babe Ruth to the Sox in 
1914 through his acquaintance with one of the Xaverian Brothers who coached 
Ruth at a Baltimore orphans' home. Later he went to the International League, 
where he led Buffalo to pennants in 1915 and 1916, and also managed Jersey 
City in 1921–22 and 1925–26. He finished out his career coaching High School 
baseball at Phillips Academy in Andover, where he coached the future 41st 
President, George H.W. Bush. Donovan died at the age of 88 in Lawrence, 
Massachusetts on Christmas Day 1953, and is interred at St. Mary Cemetery 
in Lawrence. In the Irish Baseball League, the annual award for best batter
