Houston (i/ˈhjuːstən/ HYOO-stən) is the most populous city in Texas and 
the fourth-most populous city in the United States, located in Southeast 
Texas near the Gulf of Mexico. With a census-estimated 2014 population 
of 2.239 million[5] within a land area of 599.6 square miles (1,553 km2),[6] 
it also is the largest city in the Southern United States,[7] as well as 
the seat of Harris County. It is the principal city of Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land, 
which is the fifth-most populated metropolitan area in the United States. 
Houston was founded on August 28, 1836, near the banks of Buffalo Bayou 
(now known as Allen's Landing)[8][9] and incorporated as a city on June 
5, 1837. The city was named after former General Sam Houston, who was president 
of the Republic of Texas and had commanded and won at the Battle of San 
Jacinto 25 miles (40 km) east of where the city was established. The burgeoning 
port and railroad industry, combined with oil discovery in 1901, has induced 
continual surges in the city's population. In the mid-20th century, Houston 
became the home of the Texas Medical Center—the world's largest concentration 
of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's Johnson Space Center, 
where the Mission Control Center is located.[10] Houston's economy has 
a broad industrial base in energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and transportation. 
It is also leading in health care sectors and building oilfield equipment; 
only New York City is home to more Fortune 500 headquarters within its 
city limits.[11][12] The Port of Houston ranks first in the United States 
in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage 
handled.[13] Nicknamed the "Space City", Houston is a global city, with 
strengths in business, international trade, entertainment, culture, media, 
fashion, science, sports, technology, education, medicine, and research. 
The city has a population from various ethnic and religious backgrounds 
and a large and growing international community. Houston is the most diverse 
city in Texas and has been described as the most diverse in the United 
States.[14] It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which 
attract more than 7 million visitors a year to the Museum District. Houston 
has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater District 
and offers year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.[15]

In August 1836, two real estate entrepreneurs from New York—Augustus Chapman 
Allen and John Kirby Allen—purchased 6,642 acres (26.88 km2) of land along 
Buffalo Bayou with the intent of founding a city.[16] The Allen brothers 
decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the 
Battle of San Jacinto,[16] who was elected President of Texas in September 
1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from 
the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic 
slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, 
but slave dealers were in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African Americans 
lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked 
on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits 
had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860, 49% of the city's population was 
enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as 2,000 between 1835 and 1865, 
came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as 
migrants poured into the cotton lands; they also brought or purchased enslaved 
African Americans, whose numbers more than tripled in the state from 1850 
to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566. Houston was granted incorporation on June 
5, 1837, with James S. Holman becoming its first mayor.[9] In the same 
year, Houston became the county seat of Harrisburg County (now Harris County) 
and the temporary capital of the Republic of Texas.[17] In 1840, the community 
established a chamber of commerce in part to promote shipping and waterborne 
business at the newly created port on Buffalo Bayou.[18] By 1860, Houston 
had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton.[17] 
Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met 
rail lines to the ports of Galveston and Beaumont. During the American 
Civil War, Houston served as a headquarters for General John Bankhead Magruder, 
who used the city as an organization point for the Battle of Galveston.[19] 
After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the 
city's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce 
between downtown and the nearby port of Galveston. By 1890, Houston was 
the railroad center of Texas. In 1900, after Galveston was struck by a 
devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water 
port were accelerated.[20] The following year, oil discovered at the Spindletop 
oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum 
industry.[21] In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1 million 
improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the city's population 
had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before. African Americans 
formed a large part of the city's population, numbering 23,929 people, 
or nearly one-third of the residents.[22] President Woodrow Wilson opened 
the deep-water Port of Houston in 1914, seven years after digging began. 
By 1930, Houston had become Texas' most populous city and Harris County 
the most populous county.[23] In 1940, the Census Bureau reported Houston's 
population as 77.5% white and 22.4% black.[24] When World War II started, 
tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended; 
however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical 
refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel 
because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the 
defense industry during the war.[25] Ellington Field, initially built during 
World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers 
and navigators.[26] The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 
to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in 
defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks 
and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had 
established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and 
blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although 
not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that 
erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered 
defense industries continued in the postwar years.[27] In 1945, the M.D. 
Anderson Foundation formed the Texas Medical Center. After the war, Houston's 
economy reverted to being primarily port-driven. In 1948, the city annexed 
several unincorporated areas, more than doubling its size. Houston proper 
began to spread across the region.[9][28] In 1950, the availability of 
air conditioning provided impetus for many companies to relocate to Houston, 
where wages were lower than the North; this resulted in an economic boom 
and produced a key shift in the city's economy toward the energy sector.[29][30] 
The increased production of the expanded shipbuilding industry during World 
War II spurred Houston's growth,[31] as did the establishment in 1961 of 
NASA's "Manned Spacecraft Center" (renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space 
Center in 1973). This was the stimulus for the development of the city's 
aerospace industry. The Astrodome, nicknamed the "Eighth Wonder of the 
World",[32] opened in 1965 as the world's first indoor domed sports stadium. 
During the late 1970s, Houston had a population boom as people from the 
Rust Belt states moved to Texas in large numbers.[33] The new residents 
came for numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry, created 
as a result of the Arab oil embargo. With the increase in professional 
jobs, Houston has become a destination for many college-educated persons, 
including African Americans in a reverse Great Migration from northern 
areas. One wave of the population boom ended abruptly in the mid-1980s, 
as oil prices fell precipitously. The space industry also suffered in 1986 
after the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated shortly after launch. 
A cutback in some activities existed for a period. In the late 1980s, the 
city's economy suffered from the nationwide recession. After the early 
1990s recession, Houston made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing 
on aerospace and health care/biotechnology, and reduced its dependence 
on the petroleum industry. Since the increase of oil prices in the 2000s, 
the petroleum industry has again increased its share of the local economy. 
In 1997, Houstonians elected Lee P. Brown as the city's first African American 
mayor.[34] In June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison dumped up to 40 inches 
(1,000 mm) of rain on parts of Houston, causing the worst flooding in the 
city's history. The storm cost billions of dollars in damage and killed 
20 people in Texas.[35] By December of that same year, Houston-based energy 
company Enron collapsed into the third-largest ever U.S. bankruptcy during 
an investigation surrounding fabricated partnerships that were allegedly 
used to hide debt and inflate profits. In August 2005, Houston became a 
shelter to more than 150,000 people from New Orleans, who evacuated from 
Hurricane Katrina.[36] One month later, about 2.5 million Houston-area 
residents evacuated when Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf Coast, leaving 
little damage to the Houston area. This was the largest urban evacuation 
in the history of the United States.[37][38] In September 2008, Houston 
was hit by Hurricane Ike. As many as 40% refused to leave Galveston Island 
because they feared the traffic problems that happened after Hurricane 
Rita. During the floods in 2015 and 2016, parts of the city were covered 
in several inches of water.[39] Houston is located 165 miles (266 km) east 
of Austin,[40] 112 miles (180 km) west of the Louisiana border, and 250 
miles (400 km) south of Dallas.[41] According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the city has a total area of 656.3 square miles (1,700 km2); this 
comprises 634.0 square miles (1,642 km2) of land and 22.3 square miles 
(58 km2) covered by water.[42] The Piney Woods are north of Houston. Most 
of Houston is located on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is 
classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built 
on forested land, marshes, swamp, or prairie which resembles the Deep South, 
and are all still visible in surrounding areas. The flatness of the local 
terrain, when combined with urban sprawl, has made flooding a recurring 
problem for the city.[43] Downtown stands about 50 feet (15 m) above sea 
level,[44] and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 125 
feet (38 m) in elevation.[45][46] The city once relied on groundwater for 
its needs, but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level 
water sources such as Lake Houston, Lake Conroe, and Lake Livingston.[9][47] 
The city owns surface water rights for 1.20 billion gallons of water a 
day in addition to 150 million gallons a day of groundwater.[48] Houston 
has four major bayous passing through the city. Buffalo Bayou runs through 
downtown and the Houston Ship Channel, and has three tributaries: White 
Oak Bayou, which runs through the Houston Heights community northwest of 
Downtown and then towards Downtown; Brays Bayou, which runs along the Texas 
Medical Center;[49] and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of Houston 
and downtown Houston. The ship channel continues past Galveston and then 
into the Gulf of Mexico.[25] Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated 
clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. 
The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion 
of the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and 
clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed 
into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited 
layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time 
and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments 
into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from 
the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface 
soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city 
continues to grow.[50][51] The Houston area has over 150 active faults 
(estimated to be 300 active faults) with an aggregate length of up to 310 
miles (500 km),[52][53][54] including the Long Point–Eureka Heights fault 
system which runs through the center of the city. No significant historically 
recorded earthquakes have occurred in Houston, but researchers do not discount 
the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past, nor 
occurring in the future. Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking 
because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may 
be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow 
and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly 
enough to create seismic waves.[55] These faults also tend to move at a 
smooth rate in what is termed "fault creep",[47] which further reduces 
the risk of an earthquake. Houston's climate is classified as humid subtropical 
(Cfa in the Köppen climate classification system), typical of the lower 
South. While not located in "Tornado Alley", like much of the rest of Texas, 
spring supercell thunderstorms sometimes bring tornadoes to the area. Prevailing 
winds are from the south and southeast during most of the year, which bring 
heat and moisture from the nearby Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the summer, 
temperatures commonly reach over 90 °F (32 °C), with an average of 106.5 days 
per year, including a majority from June to September, with a high of 90 °F 
(32 °C) or above and 4.6 days at or over 100 °F (38 °C).[57] However, humidity 
usually yields a higher heat index. Summer mornings average over 90% relative 
humidity.[58] Although sea breezes are present, they don't offer substantial 
relief, except in the southeastern areas of the city closer to the Gulf. 
[59] To cope with the strong humidity and heat, people use air conditioning 
in nearly every vehicle and building. In 1980, Houston was described as 
the "most air-conditioned place on earth".[60] Officially, the hottest 
temperature ever recorded in Houston is 109 °F (43 °C), which was reached 
both on September 4, 2000, and August 28, 2011.[57] Houston has mild winters 
in contrast to most areas of the United States. In January, the normal 
mean temperature at Intercontinental Airport is 53.1 °F (11.7 °C), while 
that station has an average of 13 days with a low at or below freezing. 
Snowfall is rare. Recent snow events in Houston include a storm on December 
24, 2004 when 1.0 in (2.5 cm) of snow accumulated in parts of the metro 
area.[61] Falls of at least 1.0 in (25 mm) on both December 10, 2008, and 
December 4, 2009, marked the first time measurable snowfall had occurred 
in two consecutive years in the city's recorded history. The coldest temperature 
officially recorded in Houston was 5 °F (−15 °C) on January 18, 1930.[57] 
Houston has historically received an ample amount of rainfall, averaging 
about 49.8 in (1,260 mm) annually per 1981–2010 normals. Localized flooding 
often occurs, owing to the extremely flat topography and widespread typical 
clay-silt prairie soils, which do not drain quickly. Houston has excessive 
ozone levels and is routinely ranked among the most ozone-polluted cities 
in the United States.[62] Ground-level ozone, or smog, is Houston's predominant 
air pollution problem, with the American Lung Association rating the metropolitan 
area's ozone level sixth on the "Top 10 Most Ozone-Polluted Cities" in 
2014.[63] The industries located along the ship channel are a major cause 
of the city's air pollution.[64] In 2006, Houston's air quality was comparable 
to that of Los Angeles.[64] Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the 
ward system of representation. The ward designation is the progenitor of 
the 11 current-day geographically oriented Houston City Council districts. 
Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or 
outside the Interstate 610 Loop. The inside encompasses the central business 
district and many residential neighborhoods that antedate World War II. 
More recently, high-density residential areas have been developed within 
the loop. The city's outlying areas, suburbs, and enclaves are located 
outside of the loop. Beltway 8 encircles the city another 5 miles (8.0 km) 
farther out. Though Houston is the largest city in the United States without 
formal zoning regulations, it has developed similarly to other Sun Belt 
cities because the city's land use regulations and legal covenants have 
played a similar role.[68][69] Regulations include mandatory lot size for 
single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants 
and customers. Such restrictions have had mixed results. Though some[69] 
have blamed the city's low density, urban sprawl, and lack of pedestrian-friendliness 
on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having 
significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the 
2008 real estate crisis.[70] The city issued 42,697 building permits in 
2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 
2009.[71] Voters rejected efforts to have separate residential and commercial 
land-use districts in 1948, 1962, and 1993. Consequently, rather than a 
single central business district as the center of the city's employment, 
multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to downtown 
which include Uptown, Texas Medical Center, Midtown, Greenway Plaza, Memorial 
City, Energy Corridor, Westchase, and Greenspoint. Houston has the fourth-tallest 
skyline in North America (after New York City, Chicago, and Toronto) and 
12th-tallest in the world, as of 2014[update].[72][73][74] A seven-mile 
(11 km) system of tunnels and skywalks links downtown buildings containing 
shops and restaurants, enabling pedestrians to avoid summer heat and rain 
while walking between buildings. In the 1960s, Downtown Houston consisted 
of a collection of midrise office structures. Downtown was on the threshold 
of an energy industry–led boom in 1970. A succession of skyscrapers was 
built throughout the 1970s—many by real estate developer Gerald D. Hines—culminating 
with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, 1,002-foot (305 m)-tall 
JPMorgan Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), completed in 
1982. It is the tallest structure in Texas, 15th tallest building in the 
United States, and the 85th-tallest skyscraper in the world, based on highest 
architectural feature. In 1983, the 71-floor, 992-foot (302 m)-tall Wells 
Fargo Plaza (formerly Allied Bank Plaza) was completed, becoming the second-tallest 
building in Houston and Texas. Based on highest architectural feature, 
it is the 17th-tallest in the United States and the 95th-tallest in the 
world. In 2007, downtown Houston had over 43 million square feet (4,000,000 m²) 
of office space.[75] Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, 
the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection 
of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along 
Interstate 610 West. Uptown became one of the most prominent instances 
of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, 901-foot 
(275 m)-tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams 
Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, 
it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside of a central 
business district. The new 20-story Skanska building[76] and BBVA Compass 
Plaza[77] are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years. 
The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects 
I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 
2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction 
occurred, with several over 30 stories tall.[78][79][80] Since 2000 more 
than 30 high-rise buildings have gone up in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises 
tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units.[81] In 2002, Uptown 
had more than 23 million square feet (2,100,000 m²) of office space with 
16 million square feet (1,500,000 m²) of class A office space.[82] The 
Niels Esperson Building stood as the tallest building in Houston from 1927 
to 1929. The JPMorgan Chase Tower is the tallest building in Texas and 
the tallest 5-sided building in the world. The Williams Tower is the tallest 
building in the U.S. outside of a central business district. The Bank of 
America Center by Philip Johnson is an example of postmodern architecture. 
JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston, Texas is the tallest composite building 
in the world. Houston is multicultural, in part because of its many academic 
institutions and strong industries, as well as being a major port city. 
Over 90 languages are spoken in the city.[84] It has among the youngest 
populations in the nation,[85][86][87] partly due to an influx of immigrants 
into Texas.[88] An estimated 400,000 illegal aliens reside in the Houston 
area.[89] According to the 2010 U.S. Census, whites made up 51% of Houston's 
population; 26% of the total population was non-Hispanic Whites. Blacks 
or African Americans made up 25% of Houston's population. American Indians 
made up 0.7% of the population. Asians made up 6% (1.7% Vietnamese, 1.3% 
Chinese, 1.3% Indian, 0.9% Pakistani, 0.4% Filipino, 0.3% Korean, 0.1% 
Japanese), while Pacific Islanders made up 0.1%. Individuals from some 
other race made up 15.2% of the city's population, of which 0.2% were non-Hispanic. 
Individuals from two or more races made up 3.3% of the city. At the 2000 
Census, 1,953,631 people inhabited the city, and the population density 
was 3,371.7 people per square mile (1,301.8/km²). The racial makeup of 
the city was 49.3% White, 25.3% African American, 6.3% Asian, 0.7% American 
Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 16.5% from some other race, and 3.1% from 
two or more races. In addition, Hispanics made up 37.4% of Houston's population, 
while non-Hispanic Whites made up 30.8%,[90] down from 62.4% in 1970.[24] 
The median income for a household in the city was $37,000, and for a family 
was $40,000. Males had a median income of $32,000 versus $27,000 for females. 
The per capita income was $20,000. About 19% of the population and 16% 
of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 26% of 
those under the age of 18 and 14% of those 65 and older were living below 
the poverty line. According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 
73% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, 
with 50% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered 
Protestant, and 19% professing Roman Catholic beliefs.[91][92] while 20% 
claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions 
(including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up 
about 7% of the population Houston is recognized worldwide for its energy 
industry—particularly for oil and natural gas—as well as for biomedical 
research and aeronautics. Renewable energy sources—wind and solar—are also 
growing economic bases in the city.[97][98] The Houston Ship Channel is 
also a large part of Houston's economic base. Because of these strengths, 
Houston is designated as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities 
Study Group and Network and global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.[12] 
The Houston area is the top U.S. market for exports, surpassing New York 
City in 2013, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce's 
International Trade Administration. In 2012, the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar 
Land area recorded $110.3 billion in merchandise exports.[99] Petroleum 
products, chemicals, and oil and gas extraction equipment accounted for 
roughly two-thirds of the metropolitan area's exports last year. The top 
three destinations for exports were Mexico, Canada, and Brazil.[100] The 
Houston area is a leading center for building oilfield equipment.[101] 
Much of its success as a petrochemical complex is due to its busy ship 
channel, the Port of Houston.[102] In the United States, the port ranks 
first in international commerce and 10th among the largest ports in the 
world.[13][103] Unlike most places, high oil and gasoline prices are beneficial 
for Houston's economy, as many of its residents are employed in the energy 
industry.[104] Houston is the beginning or end point of numerous oil, gas, 
and products pipelines:[105] The Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land MSA's 
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012 was $489 billion, making it the fourth-largest 
of any metropolitan area in the United States and larger than Austria's, 
Venezuela's, or South Africa's GDP.[106] Only 26 countries other than the 
United States have a gross domestic product exceeding Houston's regional 
gross area product (GAP).[107] In 2010, mining (which consists almost entirely 
of exploration and production of oil and gas in Houston) accounted for 
26.3% of Houston's GAP up sharply in response to high energy prices and 
a decreased worldwide surplus of oil production capacity, followed by engineering 
services, health services, and manufacturing.[108] The University of Houston 
System's annual impact on the Houston area's economy equates to that of 
a major corporation: $1.1 billion in new funds attracted annually to the 
Houston area, $3.13 billion in total economic benefit, and 24,000 local 
jobs generated.[110][111] This is in addition to the 12,500 new graduates 
the U.H. System produces every year who enter the workforce in Houston 
and throughout the state of Texas. These degree-holders tend to stay in 
Houston. After five years, 80.5% of graduates are still living and working 
in the region.[111] In 2006, the Houston metropolitan area ranked first 
in Texas and third in the U.S. within the category of "Best Places for 
Business and Careers" by Forbes magazine.[112] Foreign governments have 
established 92 consular offices in Houston's metropolitan area, the third-highest 
in the nation.[113] Forty foreign governments maintain trade and commercial 
offices here with 23 active foreign chambers of commerce and trade associations.[114] 
Twenty-five foreign banks representing 13 nations operate in Houston, providing 
financial assistance to the international community.[115] In 2008, Houston 
received top ranking on Kiplinger's Personal Finance Best Cities of 2008 
list, which ranks cities on their local economy, employment opportunities, 
reasonable living costs, and quality of life.[116] The city ranked fourth 
for highest increase in the local technological innovation over the preceding 
15 years, according to Forbes magazine.[117] In the same year, the city 
ranked second on the annual Fortune 500 list of company headquarters,[118] 
first for Forbes magazine's Best Cities for College Graduates,[119] and 
first on their list of Best Cities to Buy a Home.[120] In 2010, the city 
was rated the best city for shopping, according to Forbes.[121] In 2012, 
the city was ranked number one for paycheck worth by Forbes and in late 
May 2013, Houston was identified as America's top city for employment creation.[122][123] 
In 2013, Houston was identified as the number one U.S. city for job creation 
by the U.S. Bureau of Statistics after it was not only the first major 
city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn, but 
also after the crash, more than two jobs were added for every one lost. 
Economist and vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership 
Patrick Jankowski attributed Houston's success to the ability of the region's 
real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes. Furthermore, 
Jankowski stated that "more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated, 
expanded or started new businesses in Houston" between 2008 and 2010, and 
this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period 
when domestic demand was problematically low.[123] Also in 2013, Houston

Located in the American South, Houston is a diverse city with a large and 
growing international community.[125] The metropolitan area is home to 
an estimated 1.1 million (21.4 percent) residents who were born outside 
the United States, with nearly two-thirds of the area's foreign-born population 
from south of the United States–Mexico border.[126] Additionally, more 
than one in five foreign-born residents are from Asia.[126] The city is 
home to the nation's third-largest concentration of consular offices, representing 
86 countries.[127] Many annual events celebrate the diverse cultures of 
Houston. The largest and longest-running is the annual Houston Livestock 
Show and Rodeo, held over 20 days from early to late March, and is the 
largest annual livestock show and rodeo in the world.[128] Another large 
celebration is the annual night-time Houston Pride Parade, held at the 
end of June.[129] Other annual events include the Houston Greek Festival,[130] 
Art Car Parade, the Houston Auto Show, the Houston International Festival,[131] 
and the Bayou City Art Festival, which is considered to be one of the top 
five art festivals in the United States.[132][133] Houston received the 
official nickname of "Space City" in 1967 because it is the location of 
NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. Other nicknames often used by locals 
include "Bayou City", "Clutch City", "Magnolia City", "New Houston" (a 
tribute to the cultural contributions of New Orleans natives who left their 
city during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina catastrophe), and "H-Town". The 
Houston Theater District, located downtown, is home to nine major performing 
arts organizations and six performance halls. It is the second-largest 
concentration of theater seats in a downtown area in the United States.[134][135][136] 
Houston is one of few United States cities with permanent, professional, 
resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines: opera (Houston 
Grand Opera), ballet (Houston Ballet), music (Houston Symphony Orchestra), 
and theater (The Alley Theatre, Theatre Under the Stars).[15][137] Houston 
is also home to folk artists, art groups and various small progressive 
arts organizations.[138] Houston attracts many touring Broadway acts, concerts, 
shows, and exhibitions for a variety of interests.[139] Facilities in the 
Theater District include the Jones Hall—home of the Houston Symphony Orchestra 
and Society for the Performing Arts—and the Hobby Center for the Performing 
Arts. The Museum District's cultural institutions and exhibits attract 
more than 7 million visitors a year.[140][141] Notable facilities include 
The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Museum of Natural Science, the Contemporary 
Arts Museum Houston, the Station Museum of Contemporary Art, Holocaust 
Museum Houston, and the Houston Zoo.[142][143][144] Located near the Museum 
District are The Menil Collection, Rothko Chapel, and the Byzantine Fresco 
Chapel Museum. Bayou Bend is a 14-acre (5.7 ha) facility of the Museum 
of Fine Arts that houses one of America's best collections of decorative 
art, paintings, and furniture. Bayou Bend is the former home of Houston 
philanthropist Ima Hogg.[145] The National Museum of Funeral History is 
located in Houston near the George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The museum 
houses the original Popemobile used by Pope John Paul II in the 1980s along 
with numerous hearses, embalming displays, and information on famous funerals. 
Venues across Houston regularly host local and touring rock, blues, country, 
dubstep, and Tejano musical acts. While Houston has never been widely known 
for its music scene,[146] Houston hip-hop has become a significant, independent 
music scene that is influential nationwide.[147] The Theater District is 
a 17-block area in the center of downtown Houston that is home to the Bayou 
Place entertainment complex, restaurants, movies, plazas, and parks. Bayou 
Place is a large multilevel building containing full-service restaurants, 
bars, live music, billiards, and Sundance Cinema. The Bayou Music Center 
stages live concerts, stage plays, and stand-up comedy. Space Center Houston 
is the official visitors' center of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. 
The Space Center has many interactive exhibits including moon rocks, a 
shuttle simulator, and presentations about the history of NASA's manned 
space flight program. Other tourist attractions include the Galleria (Texas's 
largest shopping mall, located in the Uptown District), Old Market Square, 
the Downtown Aquarium, and Sam Houston Race Park. Of worthy mention are 
Houston's current Chinatown and the Mahatma Gandhi District. Both areas 
offer a picturesque view of Houston's multicultural makeup. Restaurants, 
bakeries, traditional-clothing boutiques, and specialty shops can be found 
in both areas. Houston is home to 337 parks, including Hermann Park, Terry 
Hershey Park, Lake Houston Park, Memorial Park, Tranquility Park, Sesquicentennial 
Park, Discovery Green, and Sam Houston Park. Within Hermann Park are the 
Houston Zoo and the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Sam Houston Park 
contains restored and reconstructed homes which were originally built between 
1823 and 1905.[148] A proposal has been made to open the city's first botanic 
garden at Herman Brown Park.[149] Of the 10 most populous U.S. cities, 
Houston has the most total area of parks and green space, 56,405 acres 
(228 km2).[150] The city also has over 200 additional green spaces—totaling 
over 19,600 acres (79 km2) that are managed by the city—including the Houston 
Arboretum and Nature Center. The Lee and Joe Jamail Skatepark is a public 
skatepark owned and operated by the city of Houston, and is one of the 
largest skateparks in Texas consisting of a 30,000-ft2 (2,800 m2)in-ground 
facility. The Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park—located in the Uptown District 
of the city—serves as a popular tourist attraction and for weddings and 
various celebrations. A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Houston the 23rd 
most walkable of the 50 largest cities in the United States.[151] Wet'n'Wild 
SplashTown is a water park located north of Houston. The Bayport Cruise 
Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel is port of call for both Princess 
Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line.[152] Houston has sports teams for every 
major professional league except the National Hockey League. The Houston 
Astros are a Major League Baseball expansion team formed in 1962 (known 
as the "Colt .45s" until 1965) that made one World Series appearance in 
2005.[153] The Houston Rockets are a National Basketball Association franchise 
based in the city since 1971. They have won two NBA Championships: in 1994 
and 1995 under star players Hakeem Olajuwon, Otis Thorpe, Clyde Drexler, 
Vernon Maxwell, and Kenny Smith.[154] The Houston Texans are a National 
Football League expansion team formed in 2002. The Houston Dynamo is a 
Major League Soccer franchise that has been based in Houston since 2006 
after it won two MLS Cup titles in 2006 and 2007. The Houston Dash team 
plays in the National Women's Soccer League.[155] The Scrap Yard Dawgs, 
a women's professional softball team, are expected to play in the National 
Pro Fastpitch from 2016.[156][157] Minute Maid Park (home of the Astros) 
and Toyota Center (home of the Rockets), are located in downtown Houston. 
Houston has the NFL's first retractable-roof stadium with natural grass, 
NRG Stadium (home of the Texans).[158] Minute Maid Park is also a retractable-roof 
stadium. Toyota Center also has the largest screen for an indoor arena 
in the United States built to coincide with the arena's hosting of the 
2013 NBA All-Star Game.[159] BBVA Compass Stadium is a soccer-specific 
stadium for the Houston Dynamo, the Texas Southern Tigers football team, 
and Houston Dash, located in East Downtown. In addition, NRG Astrodome 
was the first indoor stadium in the world, built in 1965.[160] Other sports 
facilities include Hofheinz Pavilion (Houston Cougars basketball), Rice 
Stadium (Rice Owls football), and Reliant Arena. TDECU Stadium is where 
the University of Houston Houston Cougars football team plays.[161] Houston 
has hosted several major sports events: the 1968, 1986 and 2004 Major League 
Baseball All-Star Games; the 1989, 2006 and 2013 NBA All-Star Games; Super 
Bowl VIII and Super Bowl XXXVIII, as well as hosting the 2005 World Series 
and 1981, 1986, 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals, winning the latter two. Super 
Bowl LI is currently slated to be hosted in NRG Stadium in 2017.[162] The 
city has hosted several major professional and college sporting events, 
including the annual Houston Open golf tournament. Houston hosts the annual 
NCAA College Baseball Classic every February and NCAA football's Texas 
Bowl in December.[163] The Grand Prix of Houston, an annual auto race on 
the IndyCar Series circuit is held on a 1.7-mile temporary street circuit 
in Reliant Park. The October 2013 event was held using a tweaked version 
of the 2006–2007 course.[164] The event has a 5-year race contract through 
2017 with IndyCar.[165] In motorcycling, the Astrodome hosted an AMA Supercross 
Championship round from 1974 to 2003 and the NRG Stadium since 2003. The 
city of Houston has a strong mayoral form of municipal government.[166] 
Houston is a home rule city and all municipal elections in the state of 
Texas are nonpartisan.[166][167] The city's elected officials are the mayor, 
city controller and 16 members of the Houston City Council.[168] The current 
mayor of Houston is Sylvester Turner, a Democrat elected on a nonpartisan 
ballot. Houston's mayor serves as the city's chief administrator, executive 
officer, and official representative, and is responsible for the general 
management of the city and for seeing that all laws and ordinances are 
enforced.[169] The original city council line-up of 14 members (nine district-based 
and five at-large positions) was based on a U.S. Justice Department mandate 
which took effect in 1979.[170] At-large council members represent the 
entire city.[168] Under the city charter, once the population in the city 
limits exceeded 2.1 million residents, two additional districts were to 
be added.[171] The city of Houston's official 2010 census count was 600 
shy of the required number; however, as the city was expected to grow beyond 
2.1 million shortly thereafter, the two additional districts were added 
for, and the positions filled during, the August 2011 elections. The city 
controller is elected independently of the mayor and council. The controller's 
duties are to certify available funds prior to committing such funds and 
processing disbursements. The city's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends 
on June 30. Ronald Green is the city controller, serving his first term 
as of January 2010. As the result of a 2015 referendum in Houston, a mayor 
is elected for a four-year term, and can be elected to as many as two consecutive 
terms.[172] The term limits were spearheaded by conservative political 
activist Clymer Wright.[173] The city controller and city council members 
are also subject to the same two-year, three-term limitations. Houston 
is considered to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often 
sways between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the city's wealthier areas 
vote Republican while the city's working class and minority areas vote 
Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68 percent of non-Hispanic 
whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent 
of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats. About 
62 percent Hispanics (of any race) in the area are declared or favor Democrats.[174] 
The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in 
Texas, a state known for being generally conservative.[174] As a result, 
the city is often a contested area in statewide elections.[174] In 2009, 
Houston became the first US city with a population over 1 million citizens 
to elect a gay mayor, by electing Annise Parker. Houston's murder rate 
ranked 46th of U.S. cities with a population over 250,000 in 2005 (per 
capita rate of 16.3 murders per 100,000 population).[175] In 2010, the 
city's murder rate (per capita rate of 11.8 murders per 100,000 population) 
was ranked sixth among U.S. cities with a population of over 750,000 (behind 
New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, and Philadelphia)[176] according 
to the FBI. Murders fell by 37 percent from January to June 2011, compared 
with the same period in 2010. Houston's total crime rate including violent 
and nonviolent crimes decreased by 11 percent.[177] Houston is a significant 
hub for trafficking of cocaine, cannabis, heroin, MDMA, and methamphetamine 
due to its size and proximity to major illegal drug exporting nations.[178] 
Houston is one of the country's largest hubs for human trafficking.[179] 
In the early 1970s, Houston, Pasadena and several coastal towns were the 
site of the Houston Mass Murders, which at the time were the deadliest 
case of serial killing in American history.[180][181] Seventeen school 
districts exist within the city of Houston. The Houston Independent School 
District (HISD) is the seventh-largest school district in the United States.[182] 
HISD has 112 campuses that serve as magnet or vanguard schools—specializing 
in such disciplines as health professions, visual and performing arts, 
and the sciences. There are also many charter schools that are run separately 
from school districts. In addition, some public school districts also have 
their own charter schools. The Houston area encompasses more than 300 private 
schools,[183][184][185] many of which are accredited by Texas Private School 
Accreditation Commission recognized agencies. The Houston Area Independent 
Schools offer education from a variety of different religious as well as 
secular viewpoints.[186] The Houston area Catholic schools are operated 
by the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston. Four separate and distinct state 
universities are located in Houston. The University of Houston is a nationally 
recognized Tier One research university, and is the flagship institution 
of the University of Houston System.[187][188][189] The third-largest university 
in Texas, the University of Houston has nearly 40,000 students on its 667-acre 
campus in southeast Houston.[190] The University of Houston–Clear Lake 
and the University of Houston–Downtown are stand-alone universities; they 
are not branch campuses of the University of Houston. Located in the historic 
community of Third Ward is Texas Southern University, one of the largest 
historically black colleges and universities in the United States. Several 
private institutions of higher learning—ranging from liberal arts colleges, 
such as The University of St. Thomas, Houston's only Catholic university, 
to Rice University, the nationally recognized research university—are located 
within the city. Rice, with a total enrollment of slightly more than 6,000 
students, has a number of distinguished graduate programs and research 
institutes, such as the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy.[191] 
Houston Baptist University, affiliated with the Baptist General Convention 
of Texas, offers bachelor's and graduate degrees. It was founded in 1960 
and is located in the Sharpstown area in Southwest Houston. Three community 
college districts exist with campuses in and around Houston. The Houston 
Community College System serves most of Houston. The northwestern through 
northeastern parts of the city are served by various campuses of the Lone 
Star College System, while the southeastern portion of Houston is served 
by San Jacinto College, and a northeastern portion is served by Lee College.[192] 
The Houston Community College and Lone Star College systems are within 
the 10 largest institutions of higher learning in the United States. The 
primary network-affiliated television stations are KPRC-TV (NBC), KHOU-TV 
(CBS), KTRK-TV (ABC), KRIV (Fox), KIAH (The CW), and KTXH (MyNetworkTV). 
KTRK-TV, KRIV and KTXH operate as owned-and-operated stations of their 
networks. The Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area is served 
by one public television station and one public radio station. KUHT (HoustonPBS) 
is a PBS member station and is the first public television station in the 
United States. Houston Public Radio is listener-funded and comprises one 
NPR member station, KUHF (KUHF News). The University of Houston System 
owns and holds broadcasting licenses to KUHT and KUHF. The stations broadcast 
from the Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting, located on the campus 
of the University of Houston. Houston is served by the Houston Chronicle, 
its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. The Hearst Corporation, 
which owns and operates the Houston Chronicle, bought the assets of the 
Houston Post—its long-time rival and main competition—when Houston Post 
ceased operations in 1995. The Houston Post was owned by the family of 
former Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby of Houston. The only other major 
publication to serve the city is the Houston Press—a free alternative weekly 
with a weekly readership of more than 300,000.[193] Houston is the seat 
of the internationally renowned Texas Medical Center, which contains the 
world's largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions.[194] 
All 49 member institutions of the Texas Medical Center are non-profit organizations. 
They provide patient and preventive care, research, education, and local, 
national, and international community well-being. Employing more than 73,600 
people, institutions at the medical center include 13 hospitals and two 
specialty institutions, two medical schools, four nursing schools, and 
schools of dentistry, public health, pharmacy, and virtually all health-related 
careers. It is where one of the first—and still the largest—air emergency 
service, Life Flight, was created, and a very successful inter-institutional 
transplant program was developed. More heart surgeries are performed at 
the Texas Medical Center than anywhere else in the world.[195] Some of 
the academic and research health institutions at the center include MD 
Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, UT Health Science Center, 
Memorial Hermann Hospital, The Methodist Hospital, Texas Children's Hospital, 
and University of Houston College of Pharmacy. The Baylor College of Medicine 
has annually been considered within the top ten medical schools in the 
nation; likewise, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has consistently ranked 
as one of the top two U.S. hospitals specializing in cancer care by U.S. 
News & World Report since 1990.[196][197] The Menninger Clinic, a renowned 
psychiatric treatment center, is affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine 
and The Methodist Hospital System.[198] With hospital locations nationwide 
and headquarters in Houston, the Triumph Healthcare hospital system is 
the third largest long term acute care provider nationally.[199] 71.7 percent 
of residents drive alone to work.[200] Houston's freeway system comprises 
739.3 miles (1,189.8 km) of freeways and expressways in a ten-county metropolitan 
area.[201] However, the Texas Transportation Institute's annual Urban Mobility 
Report found that Houston had the fourth-worst congestion in the country 
with commuters spending an average of 58 hours in traffic in 2009.[202] 
Houston's highway system has a hub-and-spoke freeway structure serviced 
by multiple loops. The innermost loop is Interstate 610, which encircles 
downtown, the medical center, and many core neighborhoods with around a 
8-mile (13 km) diameter. Beltway 8 and its freeway core, the Sam Houston 
Tollway, form the middle loop at a diameter of roughly 23 miles (37 km). 
A proposed highway project, State Highway 99 (Grand Parkway), will form 
a third loop outside of Houston, totaling 180 miles in length and making 
an almost-complete circumference, with the exception of crossing the ship 
channel. As of June 2014, two of eleven segments of State Highway 99 have 
been completed to the west of Houston, and three northern segments totaling 
38 miles. In addition to the Sam Houston Tollway loop mentioned above, 
the Harris County Toll Road Authority currently operates four spoke tollways: 
The Katy Managed Lanes of Interstate 10, the Hardy Toll Road, the Westpark 
Tollway, and the Fort Bend Parkway Extension. Other spoke roads either 
planned or under construction include Crosby Freeway, and the future Alvin 
Freeway. Houston's freeway system is monitored by Houston TranStar—a partnership 
of four government agencies that are responsible for providing transportation 
and emergency management services to the region.[203] The Metropolitan 
Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO) provides public transportation 
in the form of buses, light rail, and lift vans. METRO began light rail 
service on January 1, 2004, with the inaugural track ("Red Line") running 
about 8 miles (13 km) from the University of Houston–Downtown (UHD), which 
traverses through the Texas Medical Center and terminates at NRG Park. 
METRO is currently in the design phase of a 10-year expansion plan that 
will add five more lines.[204] and expand the current Red Line. Amtrak, 
the national passenger rail system, provides service three times a week 
to Houston via the Sunset Limited (Los Angeles–New Orleans), which stops 
at a train station on the north side of the downtown area. The station 
saw 14,891 boardings and alightings in fiscal year 2008.[205] In 2012, 
there was a 25 percent increase in ridership to 20,327 passengers embarking 
from the Houston Amtrak station.[206] Houston has the largest number of 
bike commuters in Texas with over 160 miles of dedicated bikeways.[207] 
The city is currently in the process of expanding its on and off street 
bikeway network.[208] A new Bicycle sharing system known as Houston B-Cycle 
currently operates 29 different stations in downtown and neighboring areas[209] 
Houston is served by three airports, two of which are commercial that served 
52 million passengers in 2007 and managed by the Houston Airport System.[210] 
The Federal Aviation Administration and the state of Texas selected the 
"Houston Airport System as Airport of the Year" for 2005,[211] largely 
because of its multi-year, $3.1 billion airport improvement program for 
both major airports in Houston. The primary city airport is George Bush 
Intercontinental Airport (IAH), the tenth-busiest in the United States 
for total passengers, and twenty eighth-busiest worldwide. Bush Intercontinental 
currently ranks fourth in the United States for non-stop domestic and international 
service with 182 destinations.[212] In 2006, the United States Department 
of Transportation named IAH the fastest-growing of the top ten airports 
in the United States.[213] The Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center 
stands on the George Bush Intercontinental Airport grounds. Houston was 
the headquarters of Continental Airlines until its 2010 merger with United 
Airlines with headquarters in Chicago; regulatory approval for the merger 
was granted in October of that year. Bush Intercontinental became United 
Airlines' largest airline hub.[214] The airline retained a significant 
operational presence in Houston while offering more than 700 daily departures 
from the city.[215][216] In early 2007, Bush Intercontinental Airport was 
named a model "port of entry" for international travelers by U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection.[217] The second-largest commercial airport is William 
P. Hobby Airport (named Houston International Airport until 1967) which 
operates primarily short- to medium-haul domestic flights. However, in 
2015 Southwest Airlines launched service from a new international terminal 
at Hobby airport to several destinations in Mexico, Central America, and 
the Caribbean. These were the first international flights flown from Hobby 
since 1969.[218] Houston's aviation history is showcased in the 1940 Air 
Terminal Museum located in the old terminal building on the west side of 
the airport. Hobby Airport has been recognized with two awards for being 
one of the top five performing airports in the world and for customer service 
by Airports Council International.[219] Houston's third municipal airport 
is Ellington Airport (a former U.S. Air Force base) used by military, government, 
NASA, and general aviation sectors.[220] The Houston Office of Protocol 
and International Affairs is the city's liaison to Houston's sister cities 
and to the national governing organization, Sister Cities International. 
Through their official city-to-city relationships, these volunteer associations 
promote people-to-people diplomacy and encourage citizens to develop mutual 
trust and understanding through commercial, cultural, educational, and 
humanitarian exchanges.[221][222] See also: List of companies in Houston
