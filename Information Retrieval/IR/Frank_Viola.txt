Frank John Viola, Jr. (born April 19, 1960) is an American former starting 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Minnesota Twins (1982–1989), 
New York Mets (1989–91), Boston Red Sox (1992–1994), Cincinnati Reds (1995) 
and Toronto Blue Jays (1996). A three-time All-Star, he was named World 
Series MVP with the Twins in 1987 and won the AL Cy Young Award in 1988. 
Long-time Tigers manager Sparky Anderson said of Viola, "...He's an artist; 
I love watching him work..." He is the pitching coach of the Las Vegas 
51s. He batted and threw left-handed, and was nicknamed "Sweet Music" – 
a nickname he picked up after a Minnesota sports writer declared that when 
Viola pitched, there was "Sweet Music" in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. 
The nickname was a play on the fact that his last name is also a name of 
a musical instrument, although pronounced differently. A fan began displaying 
a banner bearing the phrase in the outfield's upper deck whenever Viola 
pitched. Twins fans considered the banner to be a good luck charm. The 
banner is now property of the Minnesota Historical Society. It was again 
displayed when Viola was inducted into the Twins Hall of Fame. Frank was 
honored as a member of the Twins' "All Dome" team in 2009. Viola was born 
and grew up in East Meadow, New York, with his brother John and sister 
Nancy, and went on to attend and play baseball for East Meadow High School 
before playing collegiately for St. John's University. On May 21, 1981, 
Viola faced future Mets teammate Ron Darling, then playing for Yale University; 
the game is considered to be the best in college baseball history.[1] Viola 
was drafted following his freshman year in the 16th round of the 1979 Major 
League Baseball draft by the Kansas City Royals, but he did not sign. Viola 
signed with the Minnesota Twins after the team drafted him in the 2nd round 
of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft. After spending less than a full 
season in the minor leagues, Viola made his major league debut on June 
6, 1982. Although his statistics were fairly disappointing, finishing 11-25 
with a 5.37 ERA in the 1982 and 1983 seasons, Viola became a permanent 
fixture of the Twins' starting staff for the next 7 seasons, picking up 
112 of his 176 career wins. Viola helped pitch the Twins to their second 
World Series appearance and first World Series win in 1987, finishing the 
season 17-10, with a 2.90 ERA and 197 strikeouts in 251 2/3 innings. Viola 
would then sparkle in the post-season, going a combined 3-1 with 25 strikeouts 
in 31 1/3 innings despite a 4.31 ERA. Following the Twins' Game 7 series 
clinching win, a game which Viola won 4-2, he was named the 1987 World 
Series Most Valuable Player. Most baseball enthusiasts agree that Viola's 
best year was 1988, his last full year with the Twins. That year, he threw 
his signature circle change with skill, compiling an impressive 24-7 record, 
with 7 complete games and 2 shutouts in 255 innings pitched with a career-low 
ERA of 2.64. He also gave up only 20 home runs, and 54 walks. Viola led 
the league in wins and would go on to win the AL Cy Young Award in a landslide, 
finishing with 27 of the 28 first place votes and beating out 2nd place 
Dennis Eckersley by 86 total votes. At the trade deadline in July 1989, 
two years after Viola had led the Twins to a World Series title, the Twins 
traded him to the New York Mets for four pitchers and a player to be named 
later. Viola was not having a strong year and was 8-12 when he was traded, 
but managed a 5-5 record with the Mets and finished the year at 13-17. 
Meanwhile, two of the pitchers the Twins acquired in the deal went on to 
become key members of the team, as Kevin Tapani was one of the front line 
starters for the Twins in their 1991 World Series run while Rick Aguilera 
eventually became the team's closer and one of the better relievers in 
the major leagues. Viola had a much better year in 1990, winning 20 games 
for the second time in his career. He would finish third in the Cy Young 
Award voting behind Pittsburgh's Doug Drabek and Los Angeles' Ramón Martínez, 
and was named to the National League's All-Star Team. In 1991, Viola made 
the All-Star Game for a third time after posting an 11-5 record in the 
first half of the season. However, as the Mets collapsed in the second 
half of the year to finish with a 78-84 record, Viola collapsed with them 
and went 2-10 in his final 12 decisions. His last win came in his second 
to last start with the Mets, on September 29 at Shea Stadium against the 
Philadelphia Phillies. He became a free agent after the 1991 season when 
the Mets opted not to resign Viola. He signed with the Red Sox in January 
1992. In a spring training game on April 2, 1993, Viola and Cory Bailey 
combined on a no-hitter as the Red Sox defeated the Phillies 10-0 at Jack 
Russell Memorial Stadium in Clearwater, Florida.[2] He was injured while 
with the Red Sox and underwent Tommy John surgery. He finished his career 
with the Reds and Blue Jays, ending his career on May 28, 1996. He finished 
his career with 1844 strikeouts. He only got one chance in the postseason 
and he certainly made the most of it. It was with the Twins in 1987. After 
getting past the Detroit Tigers in the 1987 American League Championship 
Series, Viola and the Twins had to face favorites, the St. Louis Cardinals 
in the World Series. Viola pitched Game 1, when the Twins routed Cardinals, 
10-1. Game 4 was his second start, and the Twins went on to lose 7-2. After 
the Twins tied the series in Game 6 with an 11-5 win thanks to a Kent Hrbek 
grand slam, it was up to Viola in Game 7. He pitched a gem, shutting the 
Cardinals out after giving up 2 runs in the 2nd inning. Jeff Reardon pitched 
the ninth inning and the Twins won 4-2 and won the World Series 4-3. Viola 
was named World Series MVP. In retirement, Viola for a time coached baseball 
for Lake Highland Preparatory School in Orlando, Florida. He also coached 
with the Florida College Summer League's Leesburg Lightning. In 2009, Frank 
assisted the Cleveland Indians as a coach in spring training. Frank was 
also a part-time, substitute game broadcast announcer for NESN, network 
of the Boston Red Sox. On January 26, 2011, Viola was hired as pitching 
coach of the Brooklyn Cyclones, the Mets' Single-A (Short Season) team.[3] 
Viola spent 2012–2013 as the Single-A Affiliate Savannah Sand Gnats pitching 
coach, winning Coach of the Year in 2013. Following the season, Viola was 
named the pitching coach for the Las Vegas 51s, the Mets' Triple-A affiliate 
in the Pacific Coast League.[4] During a 2014 spring training physical, 
Viola was diagnosed with a heart condition that required open-heart surgery 
on April 2.[5] After surgery he signed with Las Vegas 51s.[6][7] Daughter 
Brittany was a diver at the University of Miami becoming the 2008 and 2011 
platform diving NCAA National Champion. Brittany narrowly missed making 
the 2004 United States Olympic diving team, but later competed at the 2012 
London Olympics.[8] Brittany will have Viola's first grandchild in August 
2014.[4] Daughter Kaley played volleyball at Winthrop University and is 
now an assistant coach at Davidson College.[9] Son Frank III attended Florida 
College and was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 29th round of the 
2004 MLB draft. Frank III struggled with injuries (including needing Tommy 
John surgery) and only pitched in 24 games at rookie level Bristol White 
Sox before being released following the 2007 season.[10] In 2010, he pitched 
for the independent league St. Paul Saints and was 1-2 with a 4.58 ERA 
in 21 games before retiring from professional baseball.[11] He now serves 
as analyst for Bright House Sports Network on their studio show and for 
their Florida State League broadcasts. Starting in 2012, Frank III has 
worked with R.A. Dickey and Hall of Fame pitcher Phil Niekro on developing 
a knuckleball to resurrect his baseball career.[10] On March 5, 2014, he 
was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays to a minor league contract and currently 
pitches for the Dunedin Blue Jays in the Advanced Single A Florida State
