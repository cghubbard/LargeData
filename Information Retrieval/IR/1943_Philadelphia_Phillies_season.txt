Lumber baron William B. Cox purchased the team in 1943. On March 9, Cox 
announced that the team would officially be called the "Phillies" again 
after former-President Gerald Nugent had named them "Phils" prior to the 
1942 season.[1] In 1943, the team rose out of the standings cellar for 
the first time in five years. The fans responded with an increase in attendance. 
Eventually, it was revealed by Cox that he had been betting on the Phillies, 
and he was banned from baseball. The new owner, Bob Carpenter, Jr., tried 
to polish the team's image by unofficially changing the name to the "Blue 
Jays"; however, the new moniker did not take, and it was quietly dropped 
by 1949.[2] The Phillies opened spring training on March 18 in Hershey, 
Pennsylvania. They used the baseball diamond at Hershey High School.[3]
