Holyoke is a city in Hampden County, Massachusetts, United States that 
lies between the western bank of the Connecticut River and the Mount Tom 
Range. As of 2012, the city had an estimated population of 40,135. Sitting 
eight miles north of Springfield, Holyoke is part of the Springfield Metropolitan 
Area, one of the two distinct metropolitan areas in Massachusetts. Englishmen 
first arrived in the Connecticut River Valley in 1633—a post was established 
at Windsor, Connecticut by traders from the Plymouth Plantation. In 1636, 
Massachusetts Bay Colony assistant treasurer and Puritan iconoclast William 
Pynchon led a group of settlers from Roxbury, Massachusetts to establish 
Springfield on land that scouts had vetted the previous year. They considered 
it the most advantageous land in the Connecticut River Valley for farming 
and trading. This settlement, on fertile farmland just north of the Connecticut 
River's first major falls (at Enfield Falls), the place where seagoing 
vessels necessarily had to transfer their cargo into smaller shallops to 
continue northward on the Connecticut River, quickly became a successful 
settlement—largely due to its advantageous position on the Bay Path to 
Boston, the Massachusetts Path to Albany, and beside the Connecticut River. 
Originally, Springfield spanned both sides of the Connecticut River; the 
region was eventually partitioned. The land on the western bank of the 
Connecticut River became West Springfield, Massachusetts. West Springfield's 
northernmost parish (alternately called Third Parish, North Parish, or 
Ireland Parish) became Holyoke, named after earlier Springfield settler 
William Pynchon's son-in-law, Elizur Holyoke, who had first explored the 
area in the 1650s.[2] The village of Holyoke was first settled in 1745 
and was officially incorporated in 1850. The first post office in the area 
was called Ireland. It was established June 3, 1822, with Martin Chapin 
as first postmaster. It was discontinued in 1883. Another post office called 
Ireland Depot was established February 26, 1847, with John M. Chapin as 
first postmaster and had its name changed to Holyoke (with George Whittle 
as first postmaster) March 14, 1850.[3] A part of Northampton known as 
Smith's Ferry was separated from the rest of the town by the creation of 
Easthampton in 1809. The shortest path to downtown Northampton was on a 
road near the Connecticut River oxbow, which was subject to frequent flooding. 
The neighborhood became the northern part of Holyoke in 1909.[4] Holyoke 
had few inhabitants until the construction of a dam and the Holyoke Canal 
System in 1849 and the subsequent construction of water-powered mills, 
particularly paper mills. At one point over 25 paper mills were in operation 
in the city. The Holyoke Machine Company, manufacturer of the Hercules 
water turbine, was among many industrial developments of the era.[5][6][7] 
Holyoke's population rose from just under 5,000 in 1860 to over 60,000 
in 1920. In 1888, Holyoke's paper industry spurred the foundation of the 
American Pad & Paper Company, which as of 2007[update] is one of the largest 
suppliers of office products in the world. The availability of water power 
enabled Holyoke to support its own electric utility company and maintain 
it independently of America's major regional electric companies. The city 
was thus a rare unaffected area in the Northeast blackout of 1965, for 
example. Holyoke was one of the first planned industrial communities in 
the United States. Holyoke features rectilinear street grids—a novelty 
in New England. This street hierarchy is seen as a potential economic development 
tool as it lends well to high-rise buildings, and the surrounding canals 
could be landscaped into a source of recreation and relaxation. Its grid 
pattern is notable in Western Massachusetts, where few roads are straight. 
The city's advantageous location on the Connecticut River—the largest river 
in New England—beside Hadley Falls, the river's steepest drop (60 feet), 
attracted the Boston Associates, who had successfully developed Lowell, 
Massachusetts' textile industry.[8] From the late 19th century until the 
mid-20th century, Holyoke was the world's biggest paper manufacturer.[8] 
The elaborate Holyoke Canal System, built to power paper and textile mills, 
distinguishes it from other Connecticut River cities. Holyoke is nicknamed 
"The Paper City" due to its fame as the world's greatest paper producer. 
Holyoke is located at 42°12′11″N 72°37′26″W﻿ / ﻿42.20306°N 72.62389°W﻿ 
/ 42.20306; -72.62389 (42.203191, -72.623969).[9] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.8 square miles (59 km2), 
of which 21.3 square miles (55 km2) is land and 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2) 
(6.70%) is water. The city is bordered by Southampton and Westfield to 
the west, Easthampton to the north, Hadley, South Hadley and Chicopee as 
river borders to the east, and West Springfield to the south. Holyoke is 
the location of East Mountain, the Mount Tom Range, and Mount Tom, 1202 
feet (363 m), the highest traprock peak on the Metacomet Ridge, a linear 
mountain range that extends from Long Island Sound to the Vermont border. 
Mount Tom is characterized by its high cliffs, sweeping vistas, and microclimate 
ecosystems. The 110-mile (180 km) Metacomet-Monadnock Trail traverses the 
Mount Tom Range and East Mountain. The City of Holyoke is divided into 
15 distinct neighborhoods; in alphabetical order, they are:[10] As of the 
census of 2010, there were 39,878 people, 14,977 households, and 9,478 
families residing in Holyoke. The population density was 1,871.8 people 
per square mile (722.5/km²). There were 16,229 housing units at an average 
density of 762.5 per square mile (294.0/km²). The racial makeup was 61.76% 
White (Non-Hispanic White 47.1%), 5.8% African American (Non-Hispanic 3.4%), 
0.38% Native American, 1.81% Asian, 0.12% Pacific Islander, and 6.81% from 
two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 47.4% of the population.[12] 
There were 14,977 households out of which 33.3% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 38.5% were married couples living together, 
20.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.7% were 
non-families. Of all households, 30.9% were made up of individuals and 
13.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.23. In the city 
the population was spread out with 29.5% under the age of 18, 9.0% from 
18 to 24, 26.8% from 25 to 44, 19.2% from 45 to 64, and 15.6% who were 
65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females 
there were 88.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
81.3 males. The median income for a household in the city was $ $33,242, 
and the median income for a family was $39,130. Males had a median income 
of $35,849 versus $26,652 for females. The per capita income for the city 
was $16,913. About 22.6% of families and 26.4% of the population were below 
the poverty line, including 41.7% of those under age 18 and 13.2% of those 
age 65 or over. Politically, the city of Holyoke has recently supported 
candidates from the Democratic Party by a wide margin. In the 2012 elections, 
voters supported President Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a margin of 
76%-22%,[13] and Elizabeth Warren over incumbent Senator Scott Brown 70%-30%.[14] 
Holyoke elected an openly gay mayor, Alex Morse, in the 2011 municipal 
election.[15] According to the 2003 FBI Report of Offenses Known to Law 
Enforcement Holyoke's crime rate in most categories was above the national 
average, in some categories, significantly. Most of these crimes are placed 
in the category of property theft, with a property crime count of 2,822.[16] 
Known by its moniker, the "Paper City", Holyoke's economic base was developed 
almost entirely around the paper industry for the better part of the late 
19th and early 20th century; at one time the city was reportedly the largest 
producer of stationary, writing, and archival goods in the world.[17][18] 
While writing paper production has largely left the city, Holyoke is still 
home to a number of specialty paper manufacturers, including companies 
like Eureka Lab Book, Hampden Paper, Hazen Paper, United Paper Box, and 
University Products. Several international companies also maintain facilities 
in the area, including a power transmission factory for U.S. Tsubaki in 
Springdale, and a Sonoco cardboard recycling plant in South Holyoke. In 
recent years there have been successful efforts to attract high-tech jobs 
to Holyoke and diversify its economic base. For example, a coalition of 
universities and tech companies have built the Massachusetts Green High 
Performance Computing Center, an energy-efficient, high-performance computing 
center, in Holyoke. It opened in 2012. These companies and institutions 
include Cisco Systems, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT,) the University of Massachusetts, Boston University, 
Northeastern University, EMC Corporation, and Accenture PLC. The data center 
has been built in Holyoke in part due to hydropower accessibility.[19] 
The retail sector has been a major employer since the construction of the 
Holyoke Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in New England, in 1979. 
Retail has provided the city with a large and steady tax base, contributing 
over $7 million in taxes annually.[20] Historically, a city of working-class 
immigrants (and the business owners who employed them), the first wave 
of mill workers was predominantly Irish. Irish immigrants had begun to 
settle in the region before the construction of the dam and the industrialization 
that followed, which is why the area's early name was "Ireland's Parish." 
The Irish roots of Holyoke is still seen in its annual St. Patrick's Day 
Parade (see below). In the 1850s, the mill owners began to recruit French-Canadians, 
who were viewed as more docile and less likely to form labor unions.[21] 
Later waves of immigration led to significant growth and cultural influence 
of communities of Germans, Poles, and Jews over first half of the 20th 
century. Starting in the 1950s, a large influx of Puerto Ricans and people 
from other Latino groups began to immigrate and migrate to Holyoke. Today 
Latinos form the largest minority group in the city, with the largest percentage 
Puerto Rican population of any city in the US outside Puerto Rico proper, 
at 44.7%.[22] The entire Latino population of Holyoke, as of the 2010 census, 
was 19,313, or 48.4% of the city's population of 39,880. Holyoke is home 
to the second-largest St. Patrick's Day parade in the United States, surpassed 
only by the New York City parade.[23] Held annually since 1952 on the Sunday 
following St. Patrick's Day, the parade draws hundreds of thousands of 
people from across New England and the Eastern seaboard of United States. 
The Holyoke Saint Patrick's Day Parade typically attracts 350,000 to 450,000 
people each year, although in certain years in the 1960s and 1970s when 
the March weather was "perfect", that number blossomed to what the police 
department estimated were 1,000,000 celebrants.[24] The Puerto Rican community 
of Holyoke holds an annual Puerto Rican Day parade on the third weekend 
of July as part of an Annual Hispanic Family Festival held by La Familia 
Hispana, inc. Every year the parade grows in popularity, attracting Puerto 
Ricans from across the northeast. Mayor Alex B. Morse, who first became 
an activist for LGBT rights as a high school student in Holyoke only six 
years earlier, presided at the city's first rainbow flag-raising ceremony 
in recognition of Gay Pride Month in June 2012.[25] On February 9, 1895, 
William G. Morgan invented volleyball at the former Holyoke YMCA. That 
YMCA building was on High Street at the intersection with Appleton Street 
but has since been demolished. The Volleyball Hall of Fame resides in Holyoke 
at Heritage State Park and inducts a new class of athletes, coaches, and 
contributors every October. The sport was originally known as mintonette. 
Holyoke School Department serves the city. Holyoke High School, William 
J. Dean Technical-Vocational High School, and the Paulo Friere Social Justice 
High School are the city's high schools. Holyoke Community College serves 
Holyoke and the western Massachusetts area. Holyoke Catholic High School 
was in Holyoke for five decades but is now in Chicopee.[28] Holyoke Public 
Library, found at 335 Maple Street, is one of the very few examples of 
neoclassical architecture in the city of Holyoke. It sits on Library Park, 
which was donated by the Holyoke Water Power Company in 1887. In 1870 the 
library was originally in a room in the old Appleton Street School. In 
1876 it moved to a large central room on the main floor of City Hall. It 
remained there until it was determined that it had outgrown the space and 
a modern facility was required.[29] Holyoke's citizens were charged to 
raise money to construct the library building and provide additional books. 
Under the leadership of Henry Chase, $95,000 was raised. William Whiting 
and William Skinner, each gave $10,000. Joseph Clough, the architect in 
charge of designing the building, gave his services gratis because his 
daughter was a faithful patron of the library. It opened officially in 
1902.[30] At the dedication ceremony William Whiting, who was library president 
at the time, referred to the library as the "people's college" and added 
that: “A library is as much a part of the intellectual life of a community 
as its schools, and should be supported generously as part of our educational 
system. Within these walls you will find authors devoted to literature, 
arts and science, and they are free to any who will ask. We can say to 
the citizens of Holyoke you have only to ask her and you will find knowledge 
to make your life useful and happy.”[29] Passenger rail service returned 
to the Holyoke in August 2015, after being absent since 1967.[31] Amtrak's 
Vermonter stops at the Holyoke station once a day in each direction. Several 
buses from the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority also operate in the city. 
Despite its industrial history, Holyoke has been fortunate enough to contain 
no Superfund sites.[32] One of the greatest producers of pollution in the 
area was the former Mount Tom Station, a coal plant in Smith's Ferry. Citizens 
cited higher rates of asthma, attributing them to the plant and after many 
years of discussion it was finally shuttered in December 2014.[33][34] 
In October 2016 ground was broken at the site for the construction of a
