George Farley "Boots" Grantham (May 20, 1900 â€“ March 16, 1954) was a Major 
League second baseman who played for the Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Cincinnati Reds, and New York Giants between 1922 and 1934. He attended 
Flagstaff High School and Northern Arizona University. After making his 
debut for the Cubs in the final week of the 1922 season, Grantham became 
their everyday second baseman in 1923, playing in a career-high 151 games 
and stealing 43 bases. Grantham hit over .300 every season from 1924 to 
1931. During the same span, his on-base percentage was .408. He was traded 
by the Cubs after the 1924 season to the Pirates in a six-player swap that 
sent future Hall of Famer Rabbit Maranville to Chicago, switching over 
to first base. With Pittsburgh, he appeared in the 1925 and 1927 World 
Series. He hit .364 in the '27 Series against what some consider the greatest 
Major League team of all time, the '27 Yankees. In 1930 he hit .324, setting 
career highs in hits (179), RBIs (99), and runs scored (120). In 1,444 
career games, Grantham had 1,508 hits with a lifetime average of .302.
