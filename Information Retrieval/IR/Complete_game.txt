In baseball, a complete game (denoted by CG) is the act of a pitcher pitching 
an entire game without the benefit of a relief pitcher.[1] A pitcher who 
meets this criterion will be credited with a complete game regardless of 
the number of innings played - pitchers who throw an entire official game 
that is shortened by rain will still be credited with a complete game, 
while starting pitchers who are relieved in extra innings after throwing 
nine or more innings will not be credited with a complete game. A starting 
pitcher who is replaced by a pinch hitter in the final half inning of a 
game will still be credited with a complete game. The frequency of complete 
games has evolved since the early days of baseball. The complete game was 
essentially an expectation in the early 20th century and pitchers completed 
almost all of the games they started. In modern baseball, the feat is much 
more rare and no pitcher has reached 30 complete games in a season since 
1975; in the 21st century, a pitcher has thrown 10 or more complete games 
in a season only twice. In the early 20th century, it was common for most 
good Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers to pitch a complete game almost 
every start, barring injury or ejection. Pitchers were expected to complete 
games they started. Over the course of the 20th century, complete games 
became less common, to the point where a good modern pitcher typically 
achieves only 1 or 2 complete games per season. (In the 2012 MLB season, 
2.6% of starts were complete games.)[4] To put this in perspective, as 
recently as the 1980s, 10â€“15 complete games a year by a star pitcher was 
not unheard of, and in 1980, Oakland Athletics pitcher Rick Langford threw 
22 consecutive complete games.[5] Years earlier, Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia 
Phillies threw 28 consecutive complete games, spanning the 1952 and 1953 
seasons. This change has been brought about by strict adherence to pitch 
counts as a basis for removing a pitcher, even though he may appear to 
be pitching well, and new pitching philosophies in general. Many have come 
to believe that the risk of arm injuries becomes far more prevalent after 
a pitcher has thrown 100 to 120 pitches in a single game.[6] Though Hall-of-Famer 
Nolan Ryan once threw well over 200 pitches in a single game (a 1974 contest 
in which he pitched 13 innings),[7] it is now rare for a manager to allow 
a pitcher to throw more than 120 pitches in a start. Former pitcher Carl 
Erskine noted the increase in ex-pitchers on coaching staffs since the 
1950s, whom he considered better evaluators of a pitchers' ability to pitch 
late into games. [8] Given this, sabermetricians generally regard Cy Young's 
total of 749 complete games as the career baseball record most unlikely 
to ever be broken.[citation needed] Further supporting the belief is that 
only three pitchers (Young, Ryan, and Don Sutton) even made at least 749 
starts in their careers. [9] James Shields threw a total of 11 complete 
games in the 2011 season for the Tampa Bay Rays, becoming the first pitcher 
to reach double digits in a single season since CC Sabathia threw 10 complete 
games for the Cleveland Indians and Milwaukee Brewers in 2008. The last 
pitcher to throw as many as 15 complete games in a single season was Curt 
Schilling, who accomplished that feat for the Philadelphia Phillies in 
1998. The last pitcher to throw 20 complete games in a single season was 
Fernando Valenzuela, who did so for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1986. The 
last pitcher to throw 25 complete games in a season was Rick Langford, 
who had 28 for the Oakland Athletics in 1980. The last pitcher to throw 
30 complete games in a season was Catfish Hunter, who did so for the New 
York Yankees in 1975. All pitchers above are right-handed, except for Eddie 
Plank. Through May 25, 2014, the top 10 active players who lead MLB in 
career complete games are:[10] All pitchers right-handed except Matt Kilroy
