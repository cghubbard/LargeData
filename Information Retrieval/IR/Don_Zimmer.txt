As Player As Manager As Coach Donald William Zimmer (January 17, 1931 – 
June 4, 2014) was an American infielder, manager, and coach in Major League 
Baseball (MLB). Zimmer was involved in professional baseball from 1949 
until his death, a span of 65 years.[1] Zimmer signed with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1949. He played in MLB with the Dodgers 
(1954–59, 1963), Chicago Cubs (1960–61), New York Mets (1962), Cincinnati 
Reds (1962), and Washington Senators (1963–65). Shortly thereafter came 
a stint with the Toei Flyers of Nippon Professional Baseball in 1966. In 
between, Zimmer saw action in all or parts of 18 minor league seasons spanning 
1949–67. He also played winter baseball with the Elefantes de Cienfuegos[2] 
and the Tigres de Marianao[3] of the Cuban League during the 1952–53 season, 
as well as for the 1954–55 Puerto Rican League champion Cangrejeros de 
Santurce en route to the 1955 Caribbean Series. Zimmer led his team to 
the Series title, topping all hitters with a .400 batting average (8-for-20), 
three home runs and a .950 slugging percentage, while claiming Most Valuable 
Player honors.[4][5] During a minor league game on July 7, 1953, Zimmer 
was struck by a pitch thrown by pitcher Jim Kirk, causing Zimmer to lose 
consciousness. He suffered a brain injury that required surgery. He woke 
up two weeks later, thinking that it was the day after the game where the 
incident took place. This led to Major League Baseball adopting batting 
helmets as a safety measure to be used by players when at-bat. Phil Rizzuto 
was the first player to use the batting helmets.[6] Following his retirement 
as a player, Zimmer began his coaching career. He worked in Minor League 
Baseball, before coaching the Montreal Expos (1971), San Diego Padres (1972), 
Boston Red Sox (1974–76, 1992) New York Yankees (1983, 1986, 1996–2003), 
Cubs (1984–86), San Francisco Giants (1987), Colorado Rockies (1993–95), 
and Tampa Bay Devil Rays / Rays (2004–14). He served as manager for the 
Padres (1972–73), Red Sox (1976–80), Texas Rangers (1981–82), and Cubs 
(1988–91). Zimmer was nicknamed "Zim", "Gerbil", and sometimes "Popeye" 
because of his facial resemblance to the cartoon character,[7] In addition, 
he was dubbed "El Galleguito" (The small Gallegan) in Cuba as well as "El 
Soldadito" (The small soldier) in Mexico and Puerto Rico.[8] Zimmer began 
his career in 1949 with the Cambridge Dodgers of the Class-D Eastern Shore 
League. He then played with the Hornell Dodgers of the Class-D PONY League 
in 1950, the Elmira Pioneers of the Single-A Eastern League in 1951, the 
Mobile Bears of the Double-A Southern League in 1952, and the St. Paul 
Saints of the Triple-A American Association in 1953 and 1954. He made his 
major league debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954. Zimmer's big league 
career lasted 12 seasons, almost exclusively as a utility infielder. Notably, 
he played for the 1955 World Series champion Brooklyn Dodgers, and with 
the 1962 New York Mets, who lost a record 120 games. Immediately following 
his rookie season, Zimmer played winter ball in Puerto Rico, emerging as 
a decidedly dark horse 1955 Caribbean Series MVP on the heavy-hitting 1954–1955 
Cangrejeros de Santurce club managed by Herman Franks.[9] Nicknamed El 
Escuadrón del Pánico (lit. "The Panic Squad"), the team featured future 
Hall-of-Famers Willie Mays and Roberto Clemente, future All-Stars George 
Crowe and Sam Jones, local hero Luis Olmo, as well as Negro League stars 
Bob Thurman and Buster Clarkson.[10] It was later described by Zimmer as 
"probably the best winter league baseball club ever assembled."[5] While 
with St. Paul in 1953, Zimmer nearly died after being hit in the temple 
with a pitch. He was not fully conscious for 13 days, during which holes 
were drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure of swelling. His vision 
was blurred, he could neither walk nor talk and his weight plunged from 
170 to 124. He was told his career was finished at age 22; fortunately 
for Zimmer, the prognosis proved incorrect and he made it to the major 
leagues the following year. Zimmer was beaned again in 1956 when a Cincinnati 
Reds fastball broke his cheekbone, but he persevered. Because of these 
beanings, it has been widely reported that he had a surgically implanted 
steel plate in his head.[11] This rumor is false, although the holes drilled 
in the surgeries following the 1953 beanball were later filled with four 
tantalum metal corkscrew-shaped "buttons."[12] In the major leagues, Zimmer 
remained with the Los Angeles Dodgers after their move west in 1958. In 
1960, the Dodgers traded Zimmer to the Chicago Cubs for Johnny Goryl, Ron 
Perranoski, Lee Handley and $25,000. After the 1961 season, the expansion 
New York Mets chose Zimmer from the Cubs as the fifth pick in the premium 
phase of the 1961 Major League Baseball expansion draft, costing the Mets 
$125,000. In May 1962, the Mets traded Zimmer to the Cincinnati Reds for 
Cliff Cook and Bob Miller. He returned briefly to the Dodgers in 1963, 
when the Reds traded him to the Dodgers for Scott Breeden. The Washington 
Senators purchased Zimmer from the Dodgers in June 1963. The Senators released 
Zimmer after the 1965 season, and he played for the Toei Flyers of Nippon 
Professional Baseball in 1966. In 12 seasons, Zimmer played 1,095 games. 
He compiled 773 hits, 91 home runs, 352 RBI, 45 stolen bases and a .235 
batting average. He played in the World Series with the Dodgers in 1955 
and 1959, and was selected to the National League All-Star team in 1961. 
Although he had a low career batting average, Zimmer was regarded as a 
fine infielder, willing to fill in at third base, shortstop, and second 
base. He also caught 33 games in his final season with Washington in 1965. 
Zimmer served as a player-manager for the Cincinnati Reds with the Double-A 
Knoxville Smokies and Triple-A Buffalo Bisons in 1967.[13] Zimmer ended 
his playing career after the 1967 season, and he managed the Triple-A Indianapolis 
Indians in 1968. In 1969, he managed the Class-A Key West Padres and the 
Triple-A Salt Lake Bees in 1970.[13] In 1971, he joined the Montreal Expos 
as third base coach.[14] He took a similar job with the San Diego Padres 
in 1972, but after only 11 games he was called on to replace Preston Gómez 
as manager, giving Zimmer his first managerial job in the major leagues.[15] 
After being fired by the Padres at the close of the 1973 campaign, he served 
as the third-base coach for the Boston Red Sox for 2½ seasons. Working 
under skipper Darrell Johnson, Zimmer's tenure included a memorable event 
during Game 6 of the 1975 World Series. Boston had the bases loaded and 
none out in the home half of the ninth inning. The score was tied. A soft 
fly to left field was too shallow to score the winning run, but baserunner 
Denny Doyle thought Zimmer's shouts of "No! No! No!" were actually "Go! 
Go! Go!"[16] He ran for home, and was thrown out at the plate. That play, 
and Dwight Evans' brilliant catch off Joe Morgan in extra innings, set 
up Carlton Fisk's classic, game-winning home run. The 1976 Red Sox never 
got on track under Johnson, and he was fired in July. Zimmer was named 
acting, then permanent, manager and he led them to a winning record, but 
a disappointing third-place finish in the AL East.[17] The Red Sox would 
win more than 90 games in each of Zimmer's three full seasons (1977–1979) 
as manager, only the second time they had pulled off this feat since World 
War I. His 1978 team won 99 games, still the fourth-best record in franchise 
history. However, he is best remembered among Red Sox fans for the team's 
dramatic collapse during the 1978 season. After leading the American League 
East by as many as fourteen games, the Red Sox stumbled in August. By early 
September that lead was reduced to four games.[18] That lead evaporated 
in a four-game series against the surging New York Yankees which is still 
known as "the Boston Massacre." The Red Sox spent the last month of the 
season trading first place with the Yankees, forcing a one-game playoff 
on October 2. In that game, the Yankees took the lead permanently on a 
legendary home run by Bucky Dent over the Fenway Park Green Monster. During 
this stretch, Zimmer made several questionable personnel moves. He never 
got along with left-handed starting pitcher Bill "Spaceman" Lee. As a matter 
of fact, his outright hatred of Lee (who had nicknamed Zimmer "The Gerbil.") 
ran so deep that he gave the starting assignment in the last game of the 
"Massacre" to rookie Bobby Sprowl, who had only been called up from Triple-A 
Pawtucket a few days earlier. Reportedly, Carl Yastrzemski pleaded with 
Zimmer to start Lee, who, along with Luis Tiant, had dominated the Yankees 
during their careers. (Lee, for example, won 12 out of 17 decisions against 
the Yankees in 10 years with Boston.) Sprowl allowed four walks, one hit 
and one run in the first inning before being pulled and made only three 
more major-league starts. Zimmer also penciled Fisk, the team's longtime 
starting catcher, into the lineup 154 times (out of a possible 162), a 
heavy workload for a catcher. Fisk complained of sore knees for much of 
this stretch and missed most of the next season with a sore arm. Finally, 
Zimmer kept third baseman Butch Hobson in the lineup, even though Hobson's 
elbow miseries (he had floating bone chips which he frequently rearranged 
before coming to the plate) made it impossible for him to hit for power 
or average, or throw accurately. Hobson made error after error, until finally 
Zimmer called on Jack Brohamer to replace him; with Brohamer at third, 
Boston won its last eight games of the regular season to force a tie with 
the Yankees, but the Red Sox lost the playoff game on home runs by Dent 
and Reggie Jackson. Zimmer next managed the Texas Rangers. He spent less 
than two years in the job and his firing by owner Eddie Chiles was different. 
Zimmer was fired on a Monday but asked to remain on through Wednesday's 
game before being replaced by Darrell Johnson.[19] When asked for the reason 
he fired Zimmer, Chiles said it was "something personal" but refused to 
elaborate further.[20] After Texas, Zimmer coached three stints with the 
Yankees (1983, 1986, 1996–2003), then coached for the San Francisco Giants 
in 1987.[14] He served as third base coach for the Chicago Cubs from 1984 
to 1986. Zimmer took over as manager of the Cubs in 1988. In 1989, he managed 
the Cubs to a division title and was named Manager of the Year.[21] He 
was fired as Cubs manager during the 1991 season after a slow start. Later, 
he returned to Boston for one season as a coach (under manager Hobson) 
in 1992.[14] Overall, Zimmer won 906 Major League games as a manager.[14] 
Zimmer was on the first coaching staff of the expansion Colorado Rockies 
in 1993, and coached with the Rockies through 1995.[14] In 1996, he joined 
the Yankees as their bench coach for their run of four World Series titles. 
In 1999, Zimmer filled in for Manager Joe Torre while Torre was recuperating 
from prostate cancer.[22] Zimmer went 21–15 while guiding the Yankees during 
Torre's absence. This record, however, is credited to Torre's managerial 
record. Many fans know him for his "brawl" with Pedro Martínez in the 2003 
American League Championship Series, when Zimmer ran at Martinez and Martinez 
threw Zimmer to the ground.[23] Zimmer accepted responsibility for the 
altercation and was apologetic to his family and the Yankees organization 
but maintained that Martínez was "one of the most unprofessional players" 
he had ever known.[24] He was also once hit by a sharply hit foul ball 
batted by Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch. The next game, Zimmer 
wore an army helmet with the word "ZIM" painted on the side and the Yankees 
logo stenciled on the front, which was given to him by Michael Patti, a 
Madison Ave. advertising executive. That event led to the installation 
of fences in front of the dugouts at Yankee Stadium, which eventually became 
commonplace at most MLB ballparks. Zimmer was a senior advisor for the 
Tampa Bay Rays. His role included assisting the team during spring training 
and during home games.[22] Every year, Zimmer incremented his uniform number 
by one to match the number of years he has worked in baseball. During the 
2014 season he wore #66,.[25] (In 2014, longtime Tampa Bay third base coach 
Tom Foley wore Zimmer's name and number on the back of his own uniform 
in tribute.)[26] Zimmer often noted that every paycheck he'd ever gotten 
came from baseball, and that he never held a job in any other profession. 
Zimmer wrote two books, Zim: A Baseball Life, and The Zen of Zim, that 
describe his life in baseball, as a player, manager, and coach. From the 
2008 season to his death, Zimmer was one of the last former Brooklyn Dodgers 
(besides pitcher Don Newcombe and announcer Vin Scully) still in baseball 
in some capacity. Zimmer also served as a member of the advisory board 
of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated 
to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players 
through financial and medical difficulties. At home plate before an Elmira 
night game in 1951, Zimmer married Soot (Carol Jean Bauerle), whom he started 
dating in 10th grade.[1] Until his death in June 2014, they were still 
married and lived in Seminole, Florida.[22] They had lived in the Tampa 
Bay Area since the late 1950s.[22] Zimmer's son Thomas is a scout with 
the San Francisco Giants. He also has a daughter, Donna, and four grandchildren.[28] 
Zimmer's grandson Beau works as a reporter at WTSP 10, St. Petersburg, 
Florida.[29] In December 2008, Zimmer suffered a stroke, causing loss of 
speech for a week.[30] Zimmer died at the age of 83 on June 4, 2014, in 
Dunedin, Florida, from heart and kidney problems.[1][31][32] On March 24, 
2015 the Rays announced they were retiring number 66 in honor of Zimmer.
