A sports rivalry is intense competition between athletic teams or athletes. 
This pressure of competition is felt by players, coaches, and management, 
but is perhaps felt strongest by the fans. The intensity of the rivalry 
varies from a friendly competition on one end to serious violence on the 
other that, in one case (the Football War), was suggested to have led to 
military conflicts. Owners typically encourage rivalries as they tend to 
improve game attendance and television ratings for rivalry matches, but 
a rivalry that gets out of control can lead to fighting, hooliganism, rioting 
and some, with career-ending or even fatal consequences. Rivalries stem 
from various sources. Simple geographic proximity as well as frequent meetings 
in important games can lead to rivalries. Games between two rivals of close 
geographical proximity are usually called a local derby, or simply just 
derby (UK: /ˈdɑːrbi/; DAR-bee or US: /ˈdɜːrbi/; DER-bee); a sporting fixture 
between two teams from the same town, city or region, particularly in association 
football. The phrase most likely originated from The Derby, a horse race 
in England, founded by the 12th Earl of Derby in 1780, since at least as 
early as 1840 'derby' has been used as a noun in English to denote any 
kind of sporting contest.[1] It was renowned as the site of a chaotic and 
exuberant game that involved the whole town and often resulted in fatalities. 
The goals were at Nuns Mill in the north and the Gallows Balk in the south 
of the town, and much of the action took place in the River Derwent or 
the Markeaton Brook. Nominally the players came from All Saints' and St 
Peter's parishes, but in practice the game was a free-for-all with as many 
as 1,000 players. A Frenchman who observed the match in 1829 wrote in horror, 
'if Englishmen call this play, it would be impossible to say what they 
call fighting'. The traditional Shrovetide football match is commonplace 
in the town of Ashbourne, Derbyshire."[2] ONEFA/CONADEIP (National College
