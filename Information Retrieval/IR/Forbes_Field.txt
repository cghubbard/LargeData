Forbes Field was a baseball park in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, from 1909 to June 28, 1970. It was the third home of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball (MLB) team, and the first home 
of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the city's National Football League (NFL) franchise. 
The stadium also served as the home football field for the University of 
Pittsburgh "Pitt" Panthers from 1909 to 1924. The stadium was named after 
British general John Forbes, who fought in the French and Indian War, and 
named the city in 1758. The US$1 million ($26.4 million today) project 
was initiated by Pittsburgh Pirates' owner Barney Dreyfuss, with the goal 
of replacing his franchise's then-current home, Exposition Park. The stadium 
was made of concrete and steel (one of the first of its kind) in order 
to increase its lifespan. The Pirates opened Forbes Field on June 30, 1909 
against the Chicago Cubs, and would play the final game that was also against 
the Cubs on June 28, 1970. The field itself featured a large playing surface, 
with the batting cage placed in the deepest part of center field during 
games. Seating was altered multiple times throughout the stadium's life; 
at times fans were permitted to sit on the grass in the outfield during 
overflow crowds. The Pirates won three World Series while at Forbes Field 
and the other original tenant, the Pittsburgh Panthers football team had 
five undefeated seasons before moving in 1924. Some remnants of the ballpark 
still stand, surrounded by the campus of the University of Pittsburgh. 
Fans gather on the site annually on the anniversary of Bill Mazeroski's 
World Series winning home run, in what author Jim O'Brien writes is "one 
of the most unique expressions of a love of the game to be found in a major 
league city".[6] In 1903, Pittsburgh Pirates' owner Barney Dreyfuss began 
to look for ground to build a larger capacity replacement for the team's 
then-current home, Exposition Park.[7] Dreyfuss purchased seven acres of 
land near the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, adjacent to Schenley Park, 
with assistance from his friend, industrialist Andrew Carnegie.[8] The 
low-priced land was selected so Dreyfuss could spend more on the stadium 
itself.[8] Dreyfuss signed a contract that he would "make the ballpark 
... of a design that would harmonize with the other structures in the Schenley 
Park district."[9] The site was initially labeled "Dreyfuss's Folly" due 
to its long distance—a 10-minute trolley ride—from downtown Pittsburgh, 
but the land around the park developed and criticisms were dropped.[8][10] 
Official Pirates' records show that Forbes Field cost US$1 million for 
site acquisition and construction, however some estimates place the cost 
at twice that amount.[10][11] Dreyfuss announced that unlike established 
wooden ballparks such as the Polo Grounds, he would build a three-tiered 
stadium out of steel and concrete to increase longevity—the first of its 
kind in the nation.[12][13] Charles Wellford Leavitt, Jr. was contracted 
to design the stadium's grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded 
an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897.[9] He had gained 
experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont 
and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss' architectural requirements, 
Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he would design.[9] 
Pirates' manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium's design, 
giving groundskeepers advice on the field, in addition to designing and 
patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield 
in case of rain.[14] Initial work on the land began on January 1, 1909,[9] 
but ground was not officially broken until March 1.[8] Nicola Building 
Company built the stadium in 122 days and play began less than four months 
after ground was broken, on June 30.[8][15] Though the scoreboard was operated 
by hand,[16] the ballpark featured multiple innovations such as ramps and 
elevators to assist fan movement throughout the park, a room for the umpires, 
and a visiting team clubhouse similar to the Pirates'.[8] The facade of 
the stadium featured "buff-colored terra cotta" spelling out "PAC" for 
the Pittsburgh Athletic Company.[8] The light green steelwork contrasted 
with the red slate of the roof.[8] Some members of the press urged Dreyfuss 
to name the stadium after himself. However, the owner decided on Forbes 
Field, in honor of General John Forbes, who captured Fort Duquesne from 
the French in 1758 and rebuilt a new "Fort Pitt" at the site.[8][17] In 
1935, after Dreyfuss' death, there was renewed media interest in renaming 
the stadium "Dreyfuss Field". His widow, Florence, resisted. However, a 
monument to Dreyfuss was placed in center field just in front of the wall.[18] 
"Pittsburg can now boast of the world's finest baseball park. It is a marvel 
of which people in other cities can have no adequate conception until they 
come here and see it." On June 29, 1909, the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated 
the Chicago Cubs, 8–1 at Exposition Park. The two teams opened Forbes Field 
the following day. Fans began to arrive at the stadium six and one-half 
hours early for the 3:30 pm game.[14] The game started at 3:30 p.m. Weather 
conditions were reported as clear skies with a temperature around 80°.[20] 
Of the crowd, the Pittsburgh Press wrote, "the ceremonies were witnessed 
by the largest throng that ever attended an event of this kind in this 
or any other city in the country ... Forbes Field is so immense—so far 
beyond anything else in America in the way of a baseball park—that old 
experts, accustomed to judging crowds at a glance, were at a loss for reasonable 
figures."[19] Records show that the first game was attended by a standing-room 
only crowd of 30,338.[10] Various National League officials and owners 
were present for the opening pre-game ceremonies, including league president 
Harry Pulliam, Civil War veteran and manager of Pittsburgh's first professional 
baseball team Al Pratt, and American League president Ban Johnson.[14] 
Pittsburgh Mayor William A. Magee threw out the stadium's ceremonial first 
pitch.[19] The Chicago Cubs won the first game, 3–2. Dreyfuss declared, 
"This is indeed the happiest day of my life."[19] The stadium was widely 
considered the best in the league.[17] It is more accurate to say Mayor 
Magee threw out the first ball. He was in the second tier and threw the 
ball to John M. Morin, Director of Public Safety, on the field below. Morin 
then went to the mound and threw the first pitch to the Pirate catcher.[21] 
Pictures depict the flag at Forbes Field at half staff on opening day. 
This occurred to honor recently deceased presidents of the Philadelphia 
Phillies and the Boston Doves.[20] The first batter at Forbes Field was 
future Hall of Famer Johnny Evers, the Cubs second baseman and lead off 
batter. He was hit by a pitch and later in the inning scored the first 
run. The first hit by a Pirate was by catcher George Gibson, who eventually 
became a Pirate manager.[20] Barney Dreyfuss "hated cheap home runs and 
vowed he'd have none in his park", which led him to design a large playing 
field for Forbes Field.[2] The original distances to the outfield fence 
in left, center, and right field were 360 feet (110 m), 462 feet (141 m) 
and 376 feet (115 m), respectively.[2] In 1925, the right field grandstand 
was extended into the corner and into fair territory, reducing the foul 
line distance from 376 feet (115 m) to 300 feet (91 m).[22] Due to the 
reduced distance, Dreyfuss erected a 28-foot (8.5 m) high screen to limit 
home runs.[23] Even at this long distance from home plate, the wall stood 
12 feet (3.7 m) in height all around the field, with the right field wall 
reduced to 9.5 feet (2.9 m) following the 1925 construction (topped by 
the screen).[10] The backstop was set at 110 feet (34 m) behind home plate, 
larger than the average of 60 feet (18 m) in most stadiums of the time. 
Additional seating eventually cut down the plate-to-screen distance to 
a still larger-than-average 75 feet (23 m).[2] With such a large outfield 
space, triples and inside-the-park home runs were common. The Pirates hit 
a record eight triples in a single game, on May 30, 1925.[22] Conversely, 
the stadium was one of the most difficult to hit over-the-fence home runs.[2] 
The closeness of the right field line from 1925 onward was the only area 
that compromised Dreyfuss' original design concept. Even at that, the right 
field wall angled sharply out to 375 feet (114 m), a typical distance for 
a major league power alley. The final three home runs of Babe Ruth's career 
were hit in Forbes Field on May 25, 1935; the third of these cleared the 
89-foot (27 m) right field roof and was considered the longest home run 
in the park's history.[2] Although Forbes Field developed a reputation 
as a "pitcher-friendly" ballpark, there was never a no-hitter thrown in 
the more than 4,700 games at the stadium.[15][24] The field itself consisted 
of natural grass grown in Crestline, Ohio.[25] "There wasn't much flubdubber. 
You just got a ballgame. If you didn't like it, you could stay home." The 
batting cage was placed just to the left of the 457-foot (139 m) center 
field "Death Valley" marker during games, because it was believed impossible 
to hit the ball that far. The open part of the cage faced the wall, the 
back of the cage effectively serving as a convex fence.[17] In right- and 
left-center fields, light towers stood on the field, and like the batting 
cage and flagpole in center field, were in-play.[26] In 1947, well after 
Dreyfuss' death, and upon the arrival of veteran slugger Hank Greenberg, 
the bullpens were moved from foul territory to the base of the scoreboard 
in left field and were fenced in, cutting 30 feet (9.1 m) from the left 
field area, from 365 feet (111 m) to 335 feet (102 m) down the line and 
406 feet (124 m) to 376 feet (115 m) in left-center field.[23] These were 
not abnormal major league outfield distances, but the obvious attempt to 
take advantage of Greenberg's bat led the media to dub the area "Greenberg 
Gardens". Greenberg retired after the season, but by then Ralph Kiner was 
an established slugger with the Pirates, and the bullpen was redubbed "Kiner's 
Korner". Kiner was traded after the 1953 season, and the field was restored 
to its previous configuration in time for the 1954 season. The final posted 
dimensions of the ballpark were left field line 365 feet (111 m), left-center 
field 406 feet (124 m), deepest left-center 457 feet (139 m), deep right-center 
436 feet (133 m), right-center field 375 feet (114 m), and right field 
line 300 feet (91 m). The only marker in exact straightaway center field 
was the Barney Dreyfuss monument, which sat on the playing field just in 
front of the wall. Forbes Field's ivy-covered walls featured no advertising, 
except a 32-foot (9.8 m) United States Marine Corps billboard during the 
1943 season.[24] The infield developed a "rock-hard" surface throughout 
the stadium's history.[16] During the final game of the 1960 World Series, 
Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek was struck in the neck with a ball that bounced 
off the hard dirt surface, breaking up a potentially rally-killing double 
play and causing Kubek to exit the game. Pittsburgh went on to win the 
game and the championship.[26] Groundskeepers burned gasoline on the mound 
to dry it off.[24] Because of the bounces, Pirates' play-by-play announcer 
Bob Prince nicknamed the ballpark The House of Thrills.[18] Forbes Field 
had an original capacity of 25,000, the largest in the league at the time.[14] 
Seating at the stadium was remodeled numerous times, peaking at a capacity 
of 41,000 in 1925 and closing in 1970 at 35,000 seats.[10] On opening day, 
ticket prices ranged from $1.25 (equal to $32.98 today) for box seats and 
$1 (equal to $26.38 today) for reserved grand stand sections;[2] temporary 
bleachers were set up for the occasion and cost $0.50.[14] Ticket prices 
were considered high for the day and steel pillars supporting the roof 
occasionally blocked fans' views of the field.[16] 2,000 bleachers were 
situated along the left field side, tickets were sold for a maximum of 
$1.[26] When winning streaks would attract high attendance to games, fans 
were permitted to sit on the grass in right field, provided they would 
agree to allow a player to catch any ball hit in the area.[27] The lowest 
season of attendance came in 1914 when 139,620 people attended games; the 
highest at the stadium came in 1960, when 1,705,828 people watched the 
Pirates play.[28] On September 23, 1956, the stadium's largest crowd, 44,932, 
gathered to see the home team play the Brooklyn Dodgers. The game was cut 
short in the top of the ninth inning, after a rain delay forced it past 
the Pennsylvania Sunday curfew. The Dodgers won the game 8–2 the following 
day.[28] At 200 people, June 10, 1938 marked the smallest crowd to ever 
attend a Pirates game.[15] On September 30, 1962, a crowd of 40,916 people 
saw the Steelers defeated by the New York Giants, at the Steelers' highest-attended 
game at the stadium.[28] Though Forbes Field was praised upon its opening, 
it began to show its age after 60 years of use. The park was the second 
oldest baseball field in the league at the time – only Shibe Park in Philadelphia 
was older (it too was replaced in 1971 by Veterans Stadium). The location 
of the park, which was initially criticized for not being developed, grew 
into a "bustling business district" which led to a lack of parking space.[29] 
One sportswriter wrote that The House of Thrills had become "as joyless 
as a prison exercise yard".[30] Following a plan to expand their adjacent 
campus, the University of Pittsburgh purchased Forbes Field in 1958, with 
an agreement to lease the stadium to the Pirates until a replacement could 
be built.[31] A proposal for a new sports stadium in Pittsburgh was first 
made in 1948, but plans did not attract much attention until the late 1950s.[29] 
Construction began on Three Rivers Stadium on April 25, 1968.[32] The Pittsburgh 
Pirates and the Chicago Cubs played a double-header on June 28, 1970.[16] 
Pittsburgh won the first game 3–2. In the later game Al Oliver hit the 
last home run in the park, and Matty Alou drove in two runs as the Pirates 
closed the 62-year-old stadium with a 4–1 victory.[33] The 40,918 spectators 
in attendance stood and cheered as Dave Giusti retired Willie Smith for 
the final out at the stadium.[28][34] Pirates Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente 
played 15 seasons at Forbes Field. He was emotional during the last game 
saying, "I spent half my life there."[35] After the game, home plate was 
dug up and taken by helicopter to Three Rivers Stadium to be installed 
in the artificial turf. A community group attempted to rescue the structure 
from demolition, proposing such things as a stage, apartments and a farmers 
market for the site and comparing it to the Eiffel Tower in significance.[36][37] 
The abandoned structure suffered two separate fires that damaged the park, 
on December 24, 1970 and July 17, 1971. 11 days after the second fire, 
demolition began, and the site was cleared for use by the University of 
Pittsburgh.[38] In 1955, a statue of Honus Wagner was dedicated in Schenley 
Plaza adjacent to Forbes Field. Several thousand fans attended the dedication 
as well as Wagner himself. His failing health caused him to never leave 
his open convertible in which he arrived (Wagner died near the end of that 
year). The 1,800 pound statue was moved to Three Rivers Stadium in 1970. 
Today, the statue stands at the home plate entrance of PNC Park.[20] The 
portion of the left field wall over which Bill Mazeroski hit his walk-off 
home run to end the 1960 World Series, between the scoreboard and the "406 
FT" sign, no longer stands at its original location. A portion of that 
wall, including the distance marker, had been sliced off and moved to the 
Allegheny Club at Three Rivers Stadium. Before the Three Rivers demolition, 
the section of the wall was salvaged, and in 2009 it was restored and placed 
on the Riverwalk outside of PNC Park.[39][40] Meanwhile, the original location 
of that wall is outlined by bricks extending from the left-center field 
wall across Roberto Clemente Drive and into the sidewalk. A plaque embedded 
in the sidewalk marks the spot where Mazeroski's home run cleared the wall.[41] 
The left-center and center field brick wall with "457 FT" and "436 FT" 
painted on it still stands at its original location, along with the stadium's 
flagpole, adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh's Mervis and Posvar 
Halls.[24] Despite not technically being the correct section of wall where 
Mazeroski's famous home run cleared, it is often locally referred to as 
"Mazeroski's Wall." This portion of the wall remained after Forbes Field 
was torn down, and was refurbished in 2006 in time for the All-Star Game 
hosted in Pittsburgh.[42][43] In addition, a wooden replica of an entrance 
to the stadium, including a ticket window and players entrance, was constructed 
and placed near the remaining wall in 2006.[44] The home plate used in 
the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's 
Posvar Hall.[42][45] However, its location has been altered; author John 
McCollister wrote, "Had architects placed home plate in its precise spot 
about half of the Pirates fans could not view it. The reason: it would 
have to be on display in the fifth stall of the ladies' restroom."[46] 
However, the original location of the home plate has been more recently 
determined by others to be approximately 81 feet away from its current 
display, just inside the GSPIA/Economics Library, and not in a restroom 
as has been popularly believed.[47] A ceremony is held each October 13 
at the outfield wall in Oakland to listen to a taped broadcast of the final 
game of the 1960 World Series.[41][48][49] The tradition was started by 
Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 
1985, sat alone at the base of the flagpole and listened to the NBC radio 
broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan.[6] Finkelstein continued 
the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people 
began attending in 1993.[6] On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 
600 people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself.[50] 
For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski 
was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski 
and several other former Pirates.[51] In 1909, Forbes Field's opening season, 
the Pirates beat the Detroit Tigers in the World Series. It would be the 
only meeting of eventual Hall of Famers Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb.[52] On 
October 2, 1920, Forbes Field hosted the last triple-header in MLB history.[22] 
On August 5, 1921, Forbes Field was the site of the first live radio broadcast 
of a Major League Baseball game in the United States.[22] Harold W. Arlin 
announced the play-by-play action between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the 
Philadelphia Phillies over KDKA from a box seat next to the first-base 
dugout.[53] Regular broadcasts began in 1936 by A. K. ′′Rosey′′ Rowswell, 
a local humorist and friend of owner Bill Benswanger. Rowswell is quoted 
as describing his broadcasting with, "It's not just play-by-play that matters. 
It's what you say in between the pitches that counts." His style influenced 
junior partner Bob Prince, who began broadcasting in 1948. Rowswell broadcast 
games at Forbes Field until his death in 1955.[20] In 1925, the Pirates 
became the first team to come back from a three-game to one deficit to 
defeat the Washington Senators and win the World Series.[54] Pittsburgh's 
third and final World Series championship while they played at Forbes Field 
came in 1960. Bill Mazeroski hit the first home run to end a World Series 
and as of 2015, the only walk-off home run in World Series Game 7 history.[55] 
Two unassisted triple plays were turned at Forbes Field. The first took 
place on May 7, 1925, when Pittsburgh's Glenn Wright achieved the feat. 
Two seasons later, in 1927, Jimmy Cooney—who had been a victim of the first 
triple play—also acquired three outs by himself.[22] On May 25, 1935, at 
Forbes Field, Babe Ruth hit the last three home runs of his career as his 
Boston Braves lost to the Pirates, 11-7. His last home run cleared the 
right field stands roofline, making him the first player to ever do so. 
On October 8, 1946, 6 months before his major league debut Jackie Robinson 
played with his African American all-stars against Honus Wagner's all-stars.[56] 
Most of the game-action scenes from the 1951 film Angels in the Outfield 
were filmed at the stadium.[22] On May 28, 1956, Dale Long of the Pirates 
took what one author has stated was the first-ever curtain call in baseball 
history, after hitting home runs in eight consecutive games caused fans 
to cheer for five minutes.[53] The Homestead Grays of the Negro leagues 
played all home games at Forbes Field from 1922 to 1939.[57] Grays owner 
Cumberland Posey became friends with Dreyfuss, who rarely missed a Grays 
game.[58] In 1930, Josh Gibson made his premiere for the Grays at Forbes 
Field.[59] Also in 1930, the Grays and the Kansas City Monarchs played 
the first baseball game at night in Pittsburgh on July 18, 1930. A crowd 
of over 15,000 was expected.[60] Floodlights were installed the day before 
the game after they were transported from Cleveland, where the Grays and 
Monarchs had played on July 16.[61] Six members of the Grays' 1936 team 
have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[62] Beginning in 1937, 
the Grays won nine consecutive Negro National League championships.[63] 
The University of Pittsburgh's baseball team would also often use Forbes 
Field for home games.[64][65][66] The University of Pittsburgh's football 
team moved from Exposition Park into Forbes Field upon its opening in 1909 
and played there until 1924 when it moved into the larger Pitt Stadium 
only a few blocks away.[67] In their first game at Forbes Field on October 
16, 1909, the Panthers defeated Bucknell University 18–6.[68] In 1910, 
Pitt's second year at Forbes Field, the Panthers went undefeated without 
allowing a single point. The Panthers had several successful seasons while 
playing at Forbes Field, including five in which they went undefeated[69] 
and were awarded national championship titles in 1910, 1915, 1916, 1917, 
and 1918.[67][70] During their years at Forbes Field, Pitt's teams were 
led by Hall of Fame coaches Joe Thompson, Glenn "Pop" Warner and Jock Sutherland.[71] 
Forbes Field was the site of yet another broadcasting first when on October 
8, 1921, Harold W. Arlin announced live play-by-play action of the Pitt-West 
Virginia football game on radio station KDKA, the first live radio broadcast 
of a college football game in the United States. Pittsburgh native, Art 
Rooney founded his NFL team under the name the Pittsburgh Pirates, on July 
8, 1933, for $2,500 ($45,778 in present-day terms).[72][73] The franchise's 
first game, against the New York Giants, was held on September 20, 1933,[74] 
at Forbes Field.[75] The Giants won the game 23–2 in front of 25,000 people.[75][76] 
Rooney wrote of the game, "The Giants won. Our team looks terrible. The 
fans didn't get their money's worth."[77] The Pirates would rebound to 
gain their first ever franchise victory a week later at Forbes Field, against 
the Chicago Cardinals.[76] The NFL's Pirates were renamed the Steelers 
in 1940, and otherwise struggled during much of their three-decades of 
tenancy at Forbes. The club achieved its first winning record in 1942; 
its tenth season of existence.[78] On November 30, 1952, the Steelers met 
the New York Giants at Forbes Field for a snowy afternoon game. Pittsburgh 
entered the game with a 3–6 record, but went on to set multiple team records, 
including scoring nine touchdowns, to win the game 63–7. Excited by their 
team's play, the 15,140 spectators ran onto the field and began to tear 
the field goal posts out of the ground.[79] The University of Pittsburgh's 
acquisition of Forbes Field in 1958 gave the Steelers some options, and 
they began transferring some of their home games to the much larger Pitt 
Stadium that year. The Steelers played their final game at Forbes Field 
on December 1, 1963. The franchise would move to Pitt Stadium exclusively 
the following season. Boxing bouts were held at Forbes Field from the 1910s 
to the 1950s, attracting crowds of over 15,000 people.[80] On June 23, 
1919, Harry "The Pittsburgh Windmill" Greb—the only boxer to beat Gene 
Tunney—defeated Mike Gibbons in a ten round bout at Forbes Field.[75] On 
July 18, 1951, the heavyweight boxing championship was held at the stadium. 
In seven rounds, Ezzard Charles was knocked out by Jersey Joe Walcott.[81] 
Another bout on September 25, 1939, was attended by 17,000 people including 
Art Rooney and Pie Traynor. Pittsburgh native Billy Conn defended his light 
heavyweight title against Melio Bettina, whom he had beaten months earlier. 
Conn won the bout by decision in 15 rounds.[82] Two years later, on June 
18, 1941, Conn fought Joe Louis at New York City's Polo Grounds, in an 
attempt to become the world heavyweight champion. The Pirates and the New 
York Giants, who were playing at Forbes Field, were called into their dugouts 
while the 24,738 fans in attendance listened to the radio broadcast of 
the hour-long bout. Conn led the bout into the final round, but fought 
for the knockout and was knocked out himself.[83] On Sunday, October 17, 
1909 at 3:00 p.m. a Communion Service was held at Forbes Field as the culmination 
of the International Centennial Celebration and Conventions of the Disciples 
of Christ[84] marking the 100th anniversary of the signing of the "Declaration 
and Address" by Thomas Campbell in September 1809. Campbell was a founding 
father of the American Restoration Movement (Disciples of Christ, Christian 
Church, Churches of Christ). Delegates and members of churches from all 
over the world were present. The Mine Safety and Health Administration 
hosted a mine rescue and safety demonstration at Forbes on October 30, 
1911.[85] The event included first-aid and rescue demonstrations. Around 
15,000 attended the event, including President William H. Taft.[85] Forbes 
Field also hosted circuses and concerts.[86] The seating capacity for baseball:[87]
