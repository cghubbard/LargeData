White House Tee Ball Initiative refers to efforts by President George W. 
Bush to promote baseball and softball by allowing youth tee-ball events 
on the grounds of the White House in Washington, D.C.. The event was first 
held in 2001. In 2001, U.S. President Bush initiated what he described 
as the "White House Tee Ball Initiative". The purpose was to promote interest 
in childhood sports, including baseball and softball. According to the 
White House, the Tee Ball Initiative promoted "a spirit of teamwork and 
service for America's youth." The plan was to invite teams from around 
the United States to play tee-ball at the White House. Teams were to be 
selected by the Little League Baseball Association. Tee-ball is considered 
"the entry sport to baseball for young players",[this quote needs a citation] 
as it generally requires less skill than baseball. Tee-ball associations 
allow children between the ages of four and eight to play in their leagues. 
It is estimated that 2.2 million children play tee-ball.[citation needed] 
The principal difference between tee-ball and softball or baseball is that 
the child hits the ball off of a tee; the ball is not pitched. Thus, tee-ball 
allows a young child to learn the skills of batting, catching, running 
the bases, and throwing, while making it both easier to hit the ball and 
less likely for batters to be injured since they do not need to dodge wayward 
pitches. The capitalized, spaced spelling "Tee Ball" is actually a registered 
trademark in the US of one particular, church-affiliated organization since 
the 1970s, though the game goes back to at least the 1950s in various parts
