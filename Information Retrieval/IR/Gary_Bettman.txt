Gary Bruce Bettman (born June 2, 1952) is the commissioner of the National 
Hockey League (NHL), a post he has held since February 1, 1993. Previously, 
Bettman was a senior vice-president and general counsel to the National 
Basketball Association (NBA). Bettman is a graduate of Cornell University 
and New York University School of Law. Under Bettman, the NHL has seen 
rapid growth of league revenues, from $400 million when he was hired to 
over $3.0 billion in 2010–11.[1][2][3] He also oversaw the expansion of 
the NHL's footprint across the United States, with six new teams added 
during his tenure, bringing the NHL to 30. In May 2014, Bettman was named 
"Sports Executive of the Year" by the SportsBusiness Journal and SportsBusiness 
Daily.[4] And in 2016, Bettman was inducted as a member of the International 
Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.[5] However, Bettman's tenure in the NHL has 
been controversial. He has often been criticized for attempting to "Americanize" 
the game, and expanding the league into non-traditional hockey markets 
such as the American South at the expense of the more traditional markets 
in Canada and the Northern United States.[1][6] Bettman has also been a 
central figure of three labor stoppages, including the 2004–05 NHL lockout 
that saw the entire season canceled.[7] These controversies have made him 
unpopular with many fans around the league.[8] Bettman was born to a Jewish 
family[9] in Queens, New York. He studied Industrial and Labor Relations 
at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he was a brother of the 
Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity, and graduated in 1974. After receiving a Juris 
Doctor degree from New York University School of Law in 1977, Bettman joined 
the New York City law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn. Bettman 
is Jewish and lives with his wife, Shelli, and their three children Lauren, 
Jordan, and Brittany. He is a resident of Saddle River, New Jersey.[10] 
Half brother Jeffrey Pollack was the Commissioner of the World Series of 
Poker.[11] Bettman joined the National Basketball Association in 1981, 
serving mainly in the marketing and legal departments.[12] Bettman rose 
to third in command of the NBA, spending many years as the league's general 
counsel and senior vice president.[13] Bettman played a key role in the 
development of the soft salary cap system implemented and agreed by the 
NBA in 1983,[14] a system it continues to use today.[15] On February 1, 
1993, Bettman began his tenure as the first commissioner of the National 
Hockey League, replacing Gil Stein, who served as the NHL's final president.[16] 
The owners hired Bettman with the mandate of selling the game in the U.S. 
market, ending labor unrest, completing expansion plans, and modernizing 
the views of the "old guard" within the ownership ranks.[17] When Bettman 
started as commissioner, the league had already expanded by three teams 
to 24 starting with the 1991–92 season, and two more were set to be announced 
by the expansion committee: the Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, 
who would begin play in 1993–94.[18] Led by Bettman, the league focused 
expansion and relocation efforts during the rest of the 1990s on the American 
South, working to expand the league's footprint across the country. The 
Nashville Predators (1998), Atlanta Thrashers (1999), Minnesota Wild (2000) 
and Columbus Blue Jackets (2000) completed this expansion period, bringing 
the NHL to 30 teams. In addition, four franchises relocated during the 
1990s under Bettman: The Minnesota North Stars to Dallas (1993), the Quebec 
Nordiques to Denver (1995), the original Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix (1996) 
and the Hartford Whalers to North Carolina (1997).[19] This move towards 
Southern markets was heavily criticized as well, however, with fans in 
Canada and the Northern United States lamenting the move away from "traditional 
hockey markets."[1] Critics have also accused Bettman of having an "anti-Canadian" 
agenda, citing the relocation of the franchises in Quebec City and Winnipeg 
and his apparent refusal to help stop it, along with the aborted sale of 
the Nashville Predators in 2007 to interests that would have moved the 
team to Hamilton, Ontario.[20] Jim Balsillie accused Bettman of forcing 
the Predators to end negotiations with him to purchase the team.[21] Bettman 
was satirized in this vein as the character "Harry Buttman" in the 2006 
Canadian movie Bon Cop, Bad Cop.[22] However, Bettman also championed the 
Canadian assistance plan, a revenue sharing agreement that saw American 
teams give money to help support the four small-market Canadian teams – 
Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, and Vancouver – throughout the late 1990s and 
early 2000s.[23] The results of expanding to Southern markets has been 
mixed. There has been in fact significant growth in the sport of hockey 
at the grassroots level with children in the U.S. South playing the game 
in increasing numbers.[19][24] And Southern teams like the Anaheim Ducks, 
Carolina Hurricanes, Dallas Stars, and Tampa Bay Lightning have been successful 
on the ice and have won the Stanley Cup. However, some of these Southern 
teams have not been as successful. The Phoenix Coyotes eventually filed 
for bankruptcy in May 2009 after incurring several hundred million dollars 
of losses since their 1996 move from Winnipeg. Under Bettman, the league 
then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the 
club's operations and then resell it to a new owner who would be committed 
to stay in the Phoenix market.[25][26] However, Bettman and the NHL still 
have not finalized a deal with any new owner for the sale of the Coyotes. 
Complicating matters is the Goldwater Institute, a taxpayer advocacy group, 
who is threatening to sue if any deal involves the sale of bonds by the 
City of Glendale to subsidize the potential new owner.[27] Keeping the 
team afloat for now is the City of Glendale itself: after paying $25 million 
for the 2010–11 season to the NHL, another agreement was reached for the 
city to pay another $25 million to the league keep the Coyotes at Jobing.com 
Arena for the 2011–12 season.[28] After joining the league in 1999, the 
Atlanta Thrashers suffered financial losses and ownership struggles, while 
only appearing in the playoffs just once. They were eventually sold to 
True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated the team 
to Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's attempts to expand into the 
Southern markets. Although Bettman was tasked with putting an end to the 
NHL's labor problems, the league has locked out its players three times 
during Bettman's tenure. The 1994–95 lockout lasted 104 days, causing the 
season to be shortened from 84 to 48 games.[29] A key issue during the 
lockout was the desire to aid small market teams. Led by Bettman, the owners 
insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and arbitration in the 
hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a luxury 
tax system.[29] The negotiations were at times bitter, with Chris Chelios 
famously issuing a veiled threat against Bettman, suggesting that Bettman 
should be "worried about [his] family and [his] well-being", because "Some 
crazed fans, or even a player [...] might take matters into their own hands 
and figure they get Bettman out of the way."[30] Last-ditch negotiations 
saved the season in January 1995. And while the owners failed to achieve 
a full salary cap, the union agreed to a cap on rookie contracts; changes 
to arbitration and restrictive rules for free agency that would not grant 
a player unrestricted free agency until he turned 31.[29] The deal was 
initially hailed as a win for the owners.[31] By the end of the deal in 
2004, the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown far faster 
than revenues, and that the league as a whole lost over US$300 million 
in 2002–03.[32] As a result, on September 15, 2004, Bettman announced that 
the owners again locked the players out prior to the start of the 2004–05 
season.[33] Five months later, Bettman announced the cancellation of the 
entire season: "It is my sad duty to announce that because a solution has 
not yet been attained, it is no longer practical to conduct even an abbreviated 
season. Accordingly, I have no choice but to announce the formal cancellation 
of play." The NHL therefore became the first North American league to cancel 
an entire season because of a labor stoppage, and the second league to 
cancel a postseason (the first being Major League Baseball, which lost 
its postseason in 1994 due to a strike). As in 1994, the owners' position 
was predicated around the need for a salary cap. In an effort to ensure 
solidarity amongst the owners, the league's governors voted to give Bettman 
the right to unilaterally veto any union offer as long as he had the backing 
of just eight owners. The players initially favored luxury tax system, 
and a 5% rollback on player salaries — later increased to 24 percent.[34] 
As the threat of a canceled season loomed, the players agreed to accept 
a salary cap, but the two sides could not come to terms on numbers before 
the deadline expired.[33] Following the cancellation of the season, negotiations 
progressed quickly, as a revolt within the union led to National Hockey 
League Players Association president Trevor Linden and senior director 
Ted Saskin taking negotiations over from executive director Bob Goodenow. 
Goodenow would resign from the NHLPA in July 2005.[35] By early July, the 
two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement.[33] The 
deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league 
revenues, a 24% rollback on salaries, and free agency beginning after seven 
years of service.[36] After being panned as one of the worst managers in 
business in 2004 for canceling the season,[37] Bettman was lauded as one 
of the best in 2005 for his role in bringing "cost certainty" to the NHL.[38] 
The 2012–13 NHL lockout lasted from September 15, 2012 to January 19, 2013, 
after the owners and players failed to agree on a new collective bargaining 
agreement.[39][40] The owners' original offer retained the framework established 
following the 2004–05 NHL lockout but made numerous changes to player salary 
and movement rights, including reducing the players' share of hockey-related 
revenues from 57 percent to 46 percent, introduce term limits on contracts, 
eliminate salary arbitration, and change free agency rules.[41] As the 
deadline for work stoppage approached, the union unsuccessfully challenged 
the league's ability to lock out players of the Calgary Flames and Edmonton 
Oilers (appealing to the Alberta Labour Relations Board), and the Montreal 
Canadiens (appealing to the Quebec Labour Relations Board).[42][43] After 
unsuccessful negotiations, the NHL and NHLPA agreed to mediation under 
the auspices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on November 
26.[44] The sides met with mediators on November 28 and 29, but the mediators 
quit after that point, determining they could not make any progress reconciling 
the two parties' demands, and thus both sides were on their own again.[45] 
After talks broke down again in December, rumours leaked that the NHLPA 
planned on filing a "disclaimer of interest" (a quicker, less formal way 
to dissolve the player's union, compared with decertification)[46] and, 
with collective bargaining no longer in effect, pursuing an antitrust lawsuit 
against the NHL. The NHL responded on December 14 by filing a class action 
suit with the U.S. District Court in New York seeking to establish that 
its lockout is legal. Included in the lawsuit was a request for all existing 
player contracts to be "void and unenforceable", should the NHLPA be dissolved, 
resulting in all NHL players becoming free agents.[47] The league also 
filed an unfair labour practice charge with the National Labor Relations 
Board, stating that the union has been negotiating in bad faith and that 
its threat to disclaim interest is a negotiating ploy that violates the 
collective bargaining process.[48][49] In a vote conducted from December 
17 to 21, the players authorized the union's executive board to file a 
disclaimer of interest, up until January 2, 2013, though it did not proceed 
with the filing.[50] On January 6, 2013, a tentative deal was reached on 
a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout.[51][52] The terms 
included a limit of eight years on contract extensions and seven years 
on new contracts, a salary floor of US$44 million and a salary cap of US$60 
million (a two-year transition period will allow teams to spend up to US$70.2 
million in the deal's first season, prorated for the season length, and 
up to a salary cap of US$64.3 million in the second season), a maximum 
50-percent variance in the salaries over the course of a contract, mandatory 
acceptance of arbitration awards under US$3.5 million, no realignment, 
and an amnesty period to buy out contracts that do not fit under the salary 
cap.[53][54] After the union ratified the deal, the lockout officially 
ended.[40] A 48-game regular season schedule was then played, starting 
on January 19, 2013 and ending on April 28, 2013, with no inter-conference 
games.[55] Despite the lockout, the average attendance for the season was 
17,768, up 2.6 percent from the previous year, while TV ratings in both 
Canada and the United States also increased.[56] Bettman quickly accomplished 
one of his stated goals, signing a five-year, $155 million deal with the 
Fox Broadcasting Company to broadcast NHL games nationally in the U.S. 
beginning in the 1994–95 season.[57] The deal was significant, as a network 
television contract in the United States was long thought unattainable 
during the presidency of John Ziegler.[58] The Fox deal is perhaps best 
remembered for the FoxTrax puck, which while generally popular according 
to Fox Sports, generated a great deal of controversy from longtime fans 
of the game.[59] Canadians were also upset as the league gave preference 
to Fox ahead of CBC for scheduling of playoff games, as Pat Hickey of the 
Montreal Gazette wrote that the schedule was "just another example of how 
the N.H.L. snubs its nose at the country that invented hockey and its fans."[60] 
The controversy repeated itself in 2007, as CBC was once again given second 
billing to Versus' coverage of the playoffs.[61] Despite falling ratings, 
Bettman negotiated a five-year, $600 million deal with ABC and ESPN in 
1998.[62] It was the largest television contract the NHL ever signed. The 
$120 million per year that ABC and ESPN paid for rights dwarfed the $5.5 
million that the NHL received from American national broadcasts in 1991–92.[63] 
The NHL's television fortunes faded after the ABC/ESPN deal. In 2004, the 
league could manage a revenue sharing deal with only NBC, with no money 
paid up front by the network.[64] Also, coming out of the lockout, ESPN 
declined its $60 million option for the NHL's cable rights in 2005–06. 
While wishing to retain the NHL, it stated the cost was overvalued.[62] 
However, Bettman was able to negotiate a deal with Comcast to air the NHL 
on the Outdoor Life Network channel, which was later renamed Versus in 
2006. The three-year deal was worth $207.5 million.[62] Bettman has been 
heavily criticized for the move to Versus, as detractors have argued that 
the league has lost a great deal of exposure since moving to the much smaller 
network.[65] The TV deal with Versus was later extended through the 2010-11 
season.[66] In January 2011, Comcast officially acquired NBC Universal, 
and then in April of that year Bettman negotiated a new 10-year deal with 
the merged media company, worth nearly $2 billion. Comcast/NBC also announced 
that both Versus and NBC would increase its number of games.[67] In signing 
this new TV deal, Bettman rejected offers from ESPN and others. Reaction 
to this new TV deal was mixed, noting that the NHL still lacks the exposure 
that ESPN can provide, while at the same time acknowledging that ESPN might 
not devote as much attention and promotion as Comcast/NBC would since the 
former is committed to various other sports properties.[68] Comcast/NBC 
then renamed Versus as the NBC Sports Network on January 2, 2012. On November 
26, 2013, Bettman and NHL announced that it had sold twelve seasons' worth 
of exclusive Canadian national broadcast rights to Rogers Media, who would 
broadcast games across its numerous platforms, including Sportsnet, Sportsnet 
One, and City, from at a price of C$5.2 billion. Hockey Night in Canada 
would continue on the CBC for the next four seasons, but under a sub-licensing 
deal the public broadcaster would give Rogers free airtime to air the broadcasts. 
CBC would be allotted time during the broadcasts to promote its other programming. 
These moves left Bell Media and its TSN networks shut out of NHL broadcasts 
except for its regional properties.[69] Bettman hosts an hour-long weekly 
radio show on NHL Home Ice (XM 204). The show provides fans with an opportunity 
to speak directly with the commissioner and voice any questions, comments, 
or concerns related to ice hockey.[70] For the lockout-shortened 2012–13 
season, Bettman received $8.8 million in total compensation by the NHL.[71] 
By 2013–14, his salary had increased to $9.5 million, according to the 
NHL's filings with the Internal Revenue Service. For the 2008–09 season, 
Bettman was paid $7.23 million, of which $5,529,490 was his base salary. 
It was $3.77 million prior to the 2004–05 lockout.[72] Bettman's controversial 
decisions, as well as presiding over three labor stoppages, have made him 
unpopular among many NHL fans.[73] He is regularly booed in various arenas 
around the league,[8][74] ranging from his appearances at the yearly NHL 
Entry Draft[75] to his annual presentation of the Stanley Cup to the league 
champion at the end of every season.[76] When asked if the booing ever 
bothers him, Bettman said, "Not doing this job, no. You're always going 
to have critics. What I've always told people: If I take the ice and it's 
completely silent, then I'll know I'm in trouble."[76] In another interview, 
he replied that he says to himself, "You know what, [the fans] got an opinion. 
We may not agree on everything, but they care, and I'll take that."[74] 
Still, writers such as Adam Proteau of The Hockey News and James O'Brien 
of NBC Sports' Pro Hockey Talk have advocated that someone else should 
hand out the Cup instead of Bettman so that the incessant booing does not 
spoil the ceremony.[77][78] In 2013, Grantland stated that Bettman's Cup 
presentations have "evolved into one of the most awkward traditions in 
all of sports".[79] On May 21, 2014, Bettman was named "Sports Executive 
of the Year" by the SportsBusiness Journal and SportsBusiness Daily at 
the publications' annual Sports Business Awards event in New York. At the 
same ceremony, the NHL was named "Sports League of the Year," the second 
time in four years the NHL has been so honored. The 2014 Bridgestone NHL 
Winter Classic was named "Sports Event of the Year." Bettman said, "It’s 
almost an out-of-body experience. This time of year, I’m normally presenting 
a trophy and getting booed. To receive one and get applause is really quite 
novel."[4] CBS Sports hockey writer Chris Peters said, "There's no question 
the game has grown throughout the United States with participation in the 
sport at an all-time high, in addition to rising revenues for the NHL itself. 
The game is also reaching its best exposure through its TV deal with NBC 
Sports. That could be one of Bettman's crowning achievements. The remarkable 
thing about the NHL is that it remains incredibly strong, if not stronger 
coming out of two lockouts in the last decade. Gary Bettman…may not be 
perfect…but (he) is a good leader for the NHL and probably deserves some 
recognition for it."[80] In 2016, Bettman was inducted as a member of the
