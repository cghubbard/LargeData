The Minneapolis Keystones was a small club of black baseball players formed 
in Minneapolis, Minnesota running from approximately 1908 to 1911.[1] While 
the Negro National League was not formed until 1920, the Keystones did 
have many top notch players, and at least one of them, Hurley McNair would 
go on to play with the Kansas City Monarchs and several other teams. Many 
of the top players of the day who were too old by the time the league was 
formed, and include William Binga, George Hopkins, Bobby Marshall, and 
Archie Pate. Many researchers do not consider the Keystones a "formal" 
Negro league team. However, like other barnstorming teams of the time, 
they had considerable impact on the desegregation of baseball. Today, the 
Keystones are rarely mentioned in Negro baseball history, and stats and 
rosters are hard to find.[citation needed] By at least 1911, sources say 
the team was being managed by Col. Edward F. Mitchell, and the teams address 
is listed at 1313 Washington Avenue in South Minneapolis.[1] "seamheads.com"
