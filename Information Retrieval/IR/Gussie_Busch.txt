August Anheuser "Gussie" Busch Jr. (March 28, 1899 â€“ September 29, 1989) 
was an American brewing magnate who built the Anheuser-Busch Companies 
into the largest brewery in the world by 1957 as company chairman from 
1946 to 1975.[2] He became a prominent sportsman as owner of the St. Louis 
Cardinals franchise in Major League Baseball from 1953 until his death. 
The Cardinals inducted him into the team Hall of Fame in 2014. August Anheuser 
Busch Jr. was born on March 28, 1899 in St. Louis, Missouri. His father 
was August Anheuser Busch Sr., the President of Anheuser-Busch. His mother 
was Alice Zisemann. His paternal grandfather, Adolphus Busch, was the German-born 
founder of Anheuser-Busch.[3] Starting at lower levels to learn the family 
business of Anheuser-Busch Company, Busch became superintendent of brewing 
operations in 1924 and head of the brewing division after his father's 
death in 1934.[4] After his older brother Adolphus Busch III's death in 
1946, August A. Jr. succeeded him as President and CEO. He led the company 
to become the largest brewery in the world by 1957, having previously competed 
with Pabst and Schlitz for the top spot. He expanded it from a single site 
in St. Louis to operating nine separate breweries nationwide. By 1973 Anheuser-Busch 
had "aggregate beer sales of 26,522,000 barrels."[2] In 1964, under his 
leadership, production at the St. Louis facility alone reached the ten 
million barrels-per-year mark. Described as a showman and salesman,[4] 
Busch began using the Clydesdale team in 1933, putting them into service 
to commemorate the end of Prohibition by having a team "haul the first 
case of Budweiser down Pennsylvania Avenue for delivery to President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt at the White House."[4] He made their image part of the company 
logo and had them appear regularly at public events.[5] In 1953, Cardinals 
owner Fred Saigh was convicted of tax evasion. Facing almost certain banishment 
from baseball, he put the Cardinals up for sale. When Busch got word that 
Saigh was seriously considering selling the team to interests who would 
move the team to Houston; he decided to have Anheuser-Busch get into the 
bidding in order to keep the Cardinals in St. Louis.[4] Ultimately, Busch 
persuaded Saigh to take less money ($3.75 million) than what he was being 
offered by out-of-town interests in the name of civic pride, and also achieved 
a marketing tool.[4] As chairman, president or CEO of the Cardinals from 
the time the club was purchased by the brewery in 1953 until his death, 
Busch oversaw a team that won six National League pennants (1964, 1967, 
1968, 1982, 1985, 1987) and three World Series (1964, 1967 and 1982). When 
his son, August Busch III, ousted him as president of Anheuser-Busch, the 
elder Busch remained as president of the Cardinals. Although the Cardinals 
were the dominant baseball team in St. Louis, they did not own their own 
ballpark. Since 1920 they had rented Sportsman's Park from the St. Louis 
Browns of the American League. Shortly after buying the Cardinals, Busch 
bought and extensively renovated the park, renaming it Busch Stadium (but 
only after a failed attempt to rename it as Budweiser Stadium). The team 
played there until Busch Memorial Stadium was built in the middle of the 
1966 season.[6] In 1984, the Cardinals retired a number, 85, in Busch's 
honor, which was his age at the time. Busch married four times, having 
a total of eleven children. Two of his marriages ended in divorce, and 
his fourth wife, the former Margaret Rohde, died in 1988.[4] At the time 
of his death, his surviving children (with married names) were Carlota 
Busch Giersch of Pasadena, California, and Lilly Busch Hermann (wife of 
Bob Hermann) of St. Louis, both daughters of the late Mrs. Marie Church 
Busch; August A. Busch III of St. Louis and Elizabeth Busch Burke of Middleburg, 
Virginia, both children of the late Elizabeth Overton Busch; and Adolphus 
A. Busch IV and Beatrice Busch von Gontard, both of St. Louis; Peter W. 
Busch of Vero Beach, Florida; and Trudy Busch Valentine, William K. Busch 
and Andrew D. Busch of St. Louis, all six the children of Gertrude Buholzer 
Busch.[4] His youngest child, daughter Christina Martina Busch, died at 
the age of eight in a car accident while on her way home from school in 
December 1974.[4] Busch died in St. Louis on September 29, 1989, at age 
90, of pneumonia.[4] Fred Kuhlman took over as Cardinals team president.[7] 
Seven years later in 1996, Anheuser-Busch sold the Cardinals to a group 
of investors led by William DeWitt Jr. In 2014, the Cardinals announced 
Busch among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. 
Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[8]
