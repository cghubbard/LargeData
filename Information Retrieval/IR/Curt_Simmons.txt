Curtis Thomas "Curt" Simmons (born May 19, 1929) is a former left-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1947 to 1950 and 1952 to 1967. With 
right-hander Robin Roberts, a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, Simmons 
was one of the twin anchors of the starting rotation of the "Whiz Kids", 
the Philadelphia Phillies' 1950 National League championship team. He is 
the youngest surviving player from the team. While attending Whitehall 
High School, Simmons led his high school team to three straight league 
titles, and also led the Coplay American Legion team to two Pennsylvania 
state crowns.[1] In 1947, Philadelphia Phillies owner Bob Carpenter arranged 
for an exhibition match between the Phillies and a team of all-star high 
school players from the Lehigh Valley. The game was played on the opening 
day of Egypt Memorial Park in front of a crowd of 4,500. Much to the surprise 
of the Phillies, Simmons struck out eleven and the game ended in a 4-4 
tie (in fact, a late-game error was the only thing that prevented the high 
school team from winning). Simmons was signed by the Phillies, and was 
awarded a $65,000 signing bonus, one of the highest ever awarded at that 
time.[1] That spring, Simmons also pitched and played outfield for an All-American 
high school game between teams managed by Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb. In 1949, 
Simmons would return to the Lehigh Valley, pitching for the Phillies in 
an exhibition match (and 10-3 win) against the Allentown Redbirds in front 
of a record crowd of 4,590 at Whitehall's Breadon Field. Simmons won 17 
of 25 decisions during the 1950 season, playing a major role in bringing 
Philadelphia its second NL championship of the 20th century. But, with 
the outbreak of the Korean War, Simmons was called to active military service 
in September 1950, with only a month remaining in the campaign. His absence 
from the Phils' rotation almost caused a swoon akin to the Quakers' 1964 
collapse, but the underdog Whiz Kids, a collection of young players (Roberts, 
Simmons, Richie Ashburn, Del Ennis, Willie Jones, Granny Hamner, etc.), 
managed to hold off the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1950 season's final contest 
(on Dick Sisler's 10th-inning home run) to win the NL flag by two games. 
Simmons was stationed at Camp Atterbury and requested and was granted a 
leave on October 4 to attend the Series. The Phillies chose not to request 
that Commissioner Chandler rule Simmons eligible for the Series but Simmons 
chose to attend to support the team. Simmons' place on the Series roster 
was taken by pitcher Jocko Thompson.[2] Without Simmons, the Phillies were 
swept in four games. Simmons also missed the entire 1951 campaign while 
in the military, but he returned in 1952 to win 14 games and post a stellar 
2.82 earned run average. The Phils would never again contend for a championship 
during his tenure there, although Simmons continued to pitch with success 
into the late 1950s. In 1959, he was stricken with a sore arm, and in 1960, 
the Phillies – now in last place and in rebuilding mode – released him 
after only four appearances. Signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals 
later that season, Simmons began a comeback that culminated in 15- and 
18-game-winning seasons in 1963-64 in a rotation with Bob Gibson and Ray 
Sadecki. In 1964, he finally appeared in the World Series, against the 
Yankees. He started two games for the eventual champion Cardinals, and 
lost his only decision but compiled a stellar 2.51 ERA. But 1964 saw his 
last winning record; he lost 15 games for St. Louis in '65, then finished 
his career with the Chicago Cubs and California Angels in 1966-67. His 
final record, over 20 years, was 193-182 (.515). Along with Smoky Burgess, 
he was the last player to formally retire who had played in the major leagues 
in the 1940s (not counting Minnie Miñoso, who un-retired twice). Simmons
