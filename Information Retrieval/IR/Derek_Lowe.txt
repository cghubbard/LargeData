Derek Christopher Lowe (born June 1, 1973) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher. During his career, he played for the Seattle Mariners, Boston 
Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, New York 
Yankees, and Texas Rangers. Lowe threw a no-hitter for the Red Sox in 2002. 
In the 2004 post-season he had a 3–0 win–loss record as he helped lead 
Boston to its first World Series championship in 86 years. He throws and 
bats right-handed. He is 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m), weighing in at 230 pounds 
(100 kg). Lowe attended Edsel Ford High School in Dearborn, Michigan, where 
he was a four-sport letterman in baseball, golf, soccer, and basketball. 
He was an All-League honoree in all four sports, and was a first-team all-state 
pick in basketball. Lowe committed to attend Eastern Michigan University 
on a basketball scholarship.[1] The Seattle Mariners drafted Lowe in the 
eighth round of the 1991 MLB draft. He signed with the Mariners on June 
7, 1991, forgoing his college scholarship.[1] The Mariners immediately 
assigned him to their rookie league team, where he went 5–3 with a 2.41 
earned run average (ERA) in 12 starts. He spent the next several years 
working his way through several minor league teams: 1992 – Single-A Bellingham 
(7–3, 2.42 – 13 starts), 1993 – Single-A Riverside (12–9, 5.26, 26 starts), 
1994 – Double-A Jacksonville (7–10, 4.94, 26 starts), 1995 – Double-A Port 
City (1–6, 6.08, 10 starts), 1996 – Triple-A Tacoma (6–9, 4.54, 16 starts). 
Lowe made his major league debut on April 26, 1997, working 3 2⁄3 innings 
in relief against the Toronto Blue Jays. He made his first major league 
start on May 27, 1997, against the Minnesota Twins, giving up four runs 
in 5 innings. His first career win came on June 6 against the Detroit Tigers, 
pitching 5 1⁄3 innings and giving up 3 runs in the Mariners 6–3 victory. 
Seattle, however, was desperate for immediate bullpen help and packaged 
Lowe and catcher Jason Varitek into a deal with the Boston Red Sox for 
Heathcliff Slocumb.[1][2] The trade is considered one of the most lopsided 
in MLB history. Lowe compiled a 5–15 record over his first two seasons, 
during which he split time starting and relieving, but came into his own 
in 1999 after being transferred into the closer's role, finishing the season 
with 15 saves and a 2.63 ERA.[1] Lowe had his best season as a closer in 
2000 when he led the American League with 42 saves and recorded a 2.56 
ERA.[1] Despite recording 24 saves early in the 2001 season, Lowe lost 
the closer's job soon after the trading deadline when the Red Sox acquired 
Ugueth Urbina.[1] Lowe was left in limbo, forced to take various setup 
jobs in the bullpen. Lowe asked manager Joe Kerrigan to return him to the 
starting rotation, and he pitched 16 innings as a starter before the end 
of the season.[1] As a starter in 2002, Lowe posted a 21–8 record, a 2.58 
ERA, and finished third in Cy Young Award voting behind Barry Zito and 
teammate Pedro Martínez. Lowe also no-hit the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Fenway 
Park on April 27 that year, becoming the first pitcher to do so at Fenway 
Park since Dave Morehead in 1965. Lowe faced just one over the minimum 
in the game; only a third inning walk to Brent Abernathy separated Lowe 
from a perfect game. Lowe posted a 17–7 record despite a 4.47 ERA in 2003. 
He recorded an improbable save in deciding Game 5 of the 2003 American 
League Division Series, helped by two clutch strikeouts. In 2004, he finished 
14–12 with a 5.42 ERA in 33 starts, spending part of the season demoted 
to the Red Sox bullpen. During the postseason he rebounded with a 3–0 record 
and 1.86 ERA in four games, three of them starts. He was the winner in 
the final game of all three postseason series—American League Division 
Series against the Anaheim Angels, American League Championship Series 
against the New York Yankees, and World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals 
(where he threw shutout ball for 7 innings in Game 4, to defeat Jason Marquis) 
— as the Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years. However, the 
win against the Angels was coming in relief. Lowe later said that the team 
would no longer have to hear "1918", a derisive chant mocking the Red Sox's 
previously most recent title win, at Yankee Stadium.[3][4] On January 11, 
2005, Lowe finalized a $36 million, four-year contract with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers.[5] Despite his signing with a new team, Lowe wore a Red Sox uniform, 
with his career-long number of 32, during the Red Sox World Series ring 
ceremony on April 11, 2005, after already making a start for the Dodgers. 
On August 31, 2005, Lowe nearly pitched the second no-hitter of his career. 
After giving up a leadoff single to the Cubs' Jerry Hairston, Jr., Lowe 
did not allow another Chicago hit, picking up a one-hit, two-walk, 7–0 
complete game victory while facing only 29 batters. For the 2008 season, 
after being the opening day starter for the Dodgers for the last three 
years, he was moved to the second starting position, behind Brad Penny. 
Lowe was chosen by manager Joe Torre to start Game 1 of the National League 
Championship series against the Philadelphia Phillies on October 9, 2008. 
Lowe opened the game with five scoreless innings. Both times that the Dodgers 
acquired Greg Maddux midseason, Lowe performed visibly better afterwards. 
He indicated that Maddux helped him considerably, and Maddux was often 
seen sitting next to him in the dugout.[6] Lowe agreed to a four-year, 
$60 million deal with the Atlanta Braves during the 2008–09 offseason.[7] 
Manager Bobby Cox announced that Lowe would start both Opening Day and 
the Braves home opener for the 2009 season.[citation needed] Lowe beat 
the Phillies 4–1 on Opening Night, going 8 innings and giving up just 2 
hits and 0 runs.[8] In 2010, Lowe was one of only two active players, along 
with Liván Hernández, to have played 12 or more seasons without going on 
the disabled list.[9] Despite having a mediocre season until August, Lowe 
was exceptional in September 2010, with a 5–0 record, a 1.77 ERA, 29 strikeouts 
while walking only three batters, which helped the Braves secure a playoff 
berth as the NL Wild Card, being one game ahead of the second place Padres 
at the end of the regular season. For this, Lowe was named National League 
Pitcher of the Month.[10] On August 31, 2011, Lowe hit his first home run 
(in 425 at-bats) off John Lannan of the Washington Nationals.[11] Following 
the 2011 season, the Braves traded Lowe to the Cleveland Indians for minor 
league left-handed relief pitcher Chris Jones. The Braves paid $10 million 
of Lowe's $15 million salary for the 2012 season.[12] On May 15, 2012 in 
a road game versus the Minnesota Twins, Lowe recorded his first shutout 
in seven years and also pitched a complete game in a 5-0 Tribe win, improving 
his season pitching record to 6-1. Lowe did not record a strikeout in the 
shutout, becoming the first pitcher to do so since 2002.[13] The Indians 
designated Lowe for assignment on August 1 to make room for Corey Kluber. 
Lowe was 8-10 with a 5.52 ERA in 21 starts and 119 innings pitched.[14] 
The Indians released Lowe on August 10.[15] On August 12, 2012, Lowe signed 
with the New York Yankees.[16] He made his Yankees debut on August 13 pitching 
4 scoreless innings of relief and got his first regular season save since 
2001.[17] Lowe was also on the team's postseason roster until the team 
lost to the Detroit Tigers in the 2012 ALCS. Lowe became a free agent after 
the 2012 season ended. On March 6, 2013, Lowe signed a minor league contract 
with the Texas Rangers.[18] He made the team's major league roster, and 
was with the Rangers on opening day.[19] He was designated for assignment 
on May 20, 2013.[20][21] On June 9, 2013, sports journalist Nick Cafardo 
reported that Lowe appeared to have retired. According to Cafardo, Lowe 
told his agent, Scott Boras, not to approach any teams to see if they have 
any interest in Lowe.[22] Lowe officially announced his retirement July 
18, 2013.[23] Lowe was a sinkerball pitcher, throwing the pitch over 60% 
of the time. He also threw a fastball, curveball and a slider.[24][25] 
Lowe has advocated for various causes to fight cancer. Himself a survivor 
of squamous cell carcinoma,[26] Lowe has worked with the Melanoma Foundation 
of New England,[27] the National Council on Skin Cancer Prevention,[28] 
and The Prostate Cancer Foundation.[29] Lowe was diagnosed with attention 
deficit disorder and received permission to treat it with Adderall, a substance 
banned by Major League Baseball.[30] Lowe was charged with fourth-degree 
domestic violence by King County police in 1997 after his girlfriend claimed 
that he struck her. Lowe was released on $1,000 bond the next day, and 
he allegedly violated a no-contact order by returning to her home shortly 
after his release.[31] Lowe entered counseling as a result.[32] Carolyn 
Hughes, who covered the Dodgers for Fox Sports West, was suspended pending 
an investigation into a potential relationship between her and Lowe during 
his tenure with the Dodgers. Shortly thereafter, Lowe filed for divorce 
from Trinka Lowe, his wife of seven years, with whom he fathered three 
children.[33] Hughes's husband had also filed for divorce. In the aftermath, 
Hughes ended her broadcasting career and she and Lowe continued their relationship. 
They were married on December 13, 2008 at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan.[34] 
On April 28, 2011, Lowe was arrested and charged with driving under the 
influence, reckless driving, and improper lane change after he was spotted 
drag racing down an Atlanta street with another car. The trooper who stopped 
him detected an odor of alcohol and administered a field sobriety test, 
which resulted in Lowe's arrest. Lowe declined to take a breath test before 
he was released after posting bail. The other driver was not charged with 
any offense and was released.[35] On May 26, 2011, both the DUI charge 
and the reckless driving charge were dismissed by City of Atlanta Solicitor-General 
Raines Carter, and Lowe entered a nolo contendere (no contest) plea to
