As player As coach As manager Major Kerby Farrell (September 3, 1913 – 
December 17, 1975) was an American professional baseball player, coach 
and manager. He was a longtime minor league manager who spent but a single 
season — 1957 — as a pilot in Major League Baseball. Farrell was a three-time 
winner of The Sporting News' Minor League Manager of the Year award (1954, 
1956 and 1961) — the only man to have won the award more than twice (as 
of 2015). Born in Leapwood, McNairy County, Tennessee, Farrell played college 
baseball at Freed-Hardeman College for two years. In his playing days, 
he was a first baseman and veteran minor-leaguer who appeared in two full 
MLB seasons during the World War II manpower shortage, with the 1943 Boston 
Braves and the 1945 Chicago White Sox, batting .262 with 177 hits, no home 
runs and 55 runs batted in in 188 games played. He also pitched in five 
games for the 1943 Braves, losing his only decision and compiling an earned 
run average of 4.30 in 23 innings of work. He batted and threw left-handed, 
stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 172 pounds (78 kg). Farrell 
began his managing career before the war in the Class C Middle Atlantic 
League in 1941–42. In 1947, he became a skipper in the farm system of the 
Cleveland Indians with the Spartanburg Peaches of the Class B Tri-State 
League and began a steady rise through the Cleveland organization. His 
1953 Reading Indians of the Class A Eastern League won 101 games, while 
his 1954 and 1956 Indianapolis Indians, then Cleveland's Triple-A club, 
won American Association pennants and the 1956 Junior World Series. These 
triumphs earned Farrell his first two managerial awards. At the close of 
the 1956 season, when the Indians finished as runners-up to the New York 
Yankees, Cleveland manager Al López resigned to become the new skipper 
of the White Sox and Farrell was promoted to succeed him. The 1957 campaign 
was a star-crossed season for the Indians. Prodigal left-handed pitcher 
Herb Score, a strikeout king and 20-game winner in 1956, was nearly blinded 
on May 7 by a line drive off the bat of the Yankees' Gil McDougald, and 
missed the rest of the campaign. Two other 20-game winners from '56, eventual 
Hall of Famers Bob Lemon and Early Wynn, slumped to below .500 records. 
While 1957 saw the debut of Roger Maris, who played for Farrell with Indianapolis,[1] 
the Indians fell to a 76–77 (.497) record and a sixth-place finish, the 
team changed general managers (from Hank Greenberg to Frank Lane), and 
Farrell was fired. He then returned to the minors, where he managed in 
the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets and Minnesota Twins organizations. 
He also coached for the White Sox (1966–69) and Indians (1970–71). As a 
minor league skipper over 21 seasons, Farrell won 1,710 games, losing 1,456 
(.540). Kerby Farrell died from a heart attack in Nashville, Tennessee,
