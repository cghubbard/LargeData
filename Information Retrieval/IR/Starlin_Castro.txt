Starlin DeJesus Castro (born March 24, 1990) is a Dominican professional 
baseball infielder for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played for the Chicago Cubs. Castro is a three-time MLB All-Star 
and holds the record for most runs batted in in an MLB debut. In 2011, 
he led the National League in hits, becoming the youngest player to do 
so. He is listed at 6 foot 2 inches (1.88 meters) and 230 lbs (104 kg). 
In 2009, Castro was named to the New York State League All-Star team, and 
won MVP honors, going 4-for-4 with an inside-the-park home run in the game.[1] 
He was also named All-Star Futures Game for the World Team. After the season, 
Castro was named the best prospect in Chicago's organization by Baseball 
America.[2] Castro was called up to the majors on May 7, 2010, from the 
Tennessee Smokies, the Cubs Double-A affiliate.[3] He became the first 
major league player born in the 1990s.[4] In his first major league at-bat, 
he hit a home run off of Homer Bailey of the Cincinnati Reds. He became 
the sixth player in Cubs history and 106th player overall to do so. Later 
in the game he hit a triple with the bases loaded, setting the record for 
most runs batted in (RBIs) in a major league debut with six. He finished 
the game two for five in the Cubs' 14 to 7 win.[5] Castro finished the 
season with a .300/.347/.408 line with three home runs and 41 RBIs in 463 
at-bats over 125 games. Despite his significant offensive contribution, 
Castro led the team and was second in the National League in errors with 
27. On October 19, 2010, Castro was named the shortstop on Baseball America's 
2010 All-Rookie Team.[6] He was also named the shortstop on the 2010 Topps 
Major League Rookie All-Star Team.[7] He finished tied for fifth in Rookie 
of the Year voting. 2011 was Castro's first full season as a MLB player, 
and also marked his first All-Star Game selection, as he was one of three 
shortstops selected to the National League All-Star team. Castro was the 
youngest Chicago Cub player to make an All-Star team.[8] The same day, 
Castro received Edward Jones Player of the Month Award honors. Castro was 
the National League Player of the Week twice during the 2011 season.[9] 
On September 23, 2011, Castro got his 200th base hit of the season, at 
Busch Stadium against the rival St. Louis Cardinals, and was the youngest 
member of the Cubs to ever do so. Castro was the youngest player to ever 
lead the National League in hits, achieving the feat with his 207th hit 
of the season on September 28, 2011. Castro's game jersey was sent to the 
Hall of Fame, in a similar manner to his MLB debut's game jersey. His line 
for the 2011 season was .307/.341/.432, and it was the first season in 
which he hit double digit home runs (10). Overall, Castro finished the 
2011 season with a .307 batting average, 10 home runs and 66 RBI. His 207 
base hits and 674 at-bats both led the National League. On defense, he 
led all major league shortstops in errors, with 29. He also had the lowest 
fielding percentage (.961).[10] Castro was selected to the National League 
All-Star team along with teammate Bryan LaHair. Castro finished the 2012 
season playing all 162 games with a .283 average, 14 homers, and 78 RBI. 
He was caught stealing 13 times which led the MLB. He also led the National 
League again with 646 at-bats. Castro had his worst year ending with a 
career low batting average of .245. He hit 10 home runs and had 44 RBIs, 
nine steals, and 2 triples while playing in 161 games.[11] After a disappointing 
2013, Castro was selected to appear in his third All-Star game along with 
teammate Anthony Rizzo in 2014. Unfortunately, Castro's All-Star year came 
to an early end when he was injured on September 2 when he awkwardly slid 
into home plate in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. He did not return 
for the balance of the year and finished with a strong batting average 
of .292 with 14 home runs, 65 RBI's, 4 stolen bases, 33 doubles and 1 triple 
in 528 at bats.[12] Castro was the top hitting shortstop (for average) 
in the National League ahead of the Dodgers' Hanley Ramírez.[13] On defense 
he had only 15 errors and a fielding percentage of .973. During an April 
20, 2015 game in Pittsburgh against the Pirates, Castro hit a ball that 
went foul behind home plate and accidentally struck a fan in her head. 
The game was delayed for 23 minutes until the fan was escorted on a stretcher 
and hospitalized due to a concussion.[14] Come the trade deadline, there 
was much speculation of a trade involving Castro. Potential deals might 
have involved him going to the Phillies[15] or the Padres.[16] Amid the 
speculation, Castro was told by manager Joe Maddon that he would not be 
traded.[17] In August, Castro was benched by Cubs manager Joe Maddon due 
to poor performance, including a career low .236 batting average.[18] With 
rookie Addison Russell taking over as the everyday shortstop, Castro made 
the switch to second base on August 12.[19][20][21] On September 18, in 
an important game against the division leading Cardinals, Castro hit two 
home runs and matched his career high with six RBIs to lead the Cubs to 
an 8-3 win. On December 8, 2015, Castro was traded to the New York Yankees 
in exchange for pitcher Adam Warren and a player to be named later. On 
December 15, 2015, Brendan Ryan was also traded to the Cubs to finalize 
the transaction.[22] On April 6, 2016, Castro had 5 RBI in a win over the 
Houston Astros, and he broke the franchise record for most RBI in the first 
two career games with the Yankees with 7, and the fourth player to get 
7 RBI in the first two games in a season.[23] On April 9, Castro recorded 
his 1000th career hit, in a win over the Detroit Tigers. On June 22, Castro 
hit his first ever walk-off home run in a 9-8 win over the Rockies. In 
2011, Castro was sought by Chicago Police for questioning regarding an 
alleged sexual assault. A woman claimed to have met Castro in a bar and 
later woken up to Castro sexually assaulting her in his apartment. No charges 
were filed.[24] On December 9, 2014,[25] Castro was detained for questioning 
by the police regarding a shooting in one of the Dominican Republic's nightclubs. 
It was alleged that he and his brother got into an argument with a government 
official. According to Castro's agent Paul Kinzer, he was cleared of any 
involvement and was not arrested, though his home was searched and Castro
