Football is a widely practiced and popular sport in Venezuela, although 
the sport has lagged behind baseball in popularity.[1][2][3][4][5][6] The 
country has proven one of the biggest underachievers in CONMEBOL and was 
formerly known as the Cenicienta of the region.[7] The Federación Venezolana 
de Fútbol was established in 1926 following the creation of the Liga Venezolana 
in 1921. Professionalism was not established until 1957 with the Copa de 
Venezuela arriving two years later. Caracas Fútbol Club are the country's 
most successful club side. A second division was added in 1979[8] with 
a third added in 1999 and a fourth in 2006.[9] Venezuela national football 
team played their first game in 1938 and since then have been one of South 
America's weakest teams. Following Ecuador's qualification for the 2002 
FIFA World Cup Venezuela are now the only CONMEBOL member to never have 
appeared at a World Cup finals. However the team are no longer seen as 
pushovers and are now recognised as stern opposition.[10] Their growing 
status was further demonstrated by their hosting of the Copa América 2007 
during which they reached the quarter finals. Furthermore, during the Copa 
América 2011, held in Argentina, they even improved this performance and 
reached the semifinals, after knocking out the Chilean team in the quarter-finals. 
They eventually lost in the semifinals against Paraguay.[11][12] An under-20
