Litchfield County is a county located in northwestern Connecticut of the 
New York metropolitan area. As of the 2010 census, the population was 189,927.[1] 
The county was named after Lichfield, in England.[2] Litchfield County 
has the lowest population density of any county in Connecticut and is geographically 
the state's largest county. Litchfield County comprises the Torrington, 
CT Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the New York-Newark, 
NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. As is the case with all eight counties 
in Connecticut, there is no county government; there is no county seat: 
in Connecticut, each town is responsible for all local services such as 
schools, snow removal, sewers, fire department and police departments. 
However, in some cases in rural areas, adjoining towns may agree to jointly 
provide services or even establish a joint school system. Litchfield County 
was created on October 9, 1751, by an act of the Connecticut General Court 
from land belonging to Fairfield, New Haven, and Hartford counties. The 
act establishing the county states: Between 1780 and 1807, several new 
towns were created at the boundaries between Litchfield County and other 
counties in Connecticut. The town of Watertown was established in 1780 
from Waterbury and was placed under Litchfield County jurisdiction. The 
establishment of the town of Brookfield from part of New Milford in 1788 
resulted in Litchfield County losing territory to Fairfield County. In 
1796, the town of Hartland was transferred to Hartford County. In 1798, 
the town of Oxford was established from part of Southbury causing Litchfield 
County to lose territory to New Haven County. In 1807, the town of Southbury 
was transferred to New Haven County. The final boundary change occurred 
on October 8, 1807, when the town of Middlebury was established from part 
of Woodbury.[4] In 1862, during the Civil War, Litchfield County raised 
the 2nd Connecticut Regiment of Volunteers Heavy Artillery. This regiment, 
originally the 19th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, served in the defense 
of Washington, D.C. from September 1862 to March 1864, at which time it 
was transferred to the Army of the Potomac. On June 1, 1864, the 2nd Connecticut 
Heavy Artillery fought as infantry (as it continued to do through the war) 
in the Battle of Cold Harbor, experiencing the heaviest proportionate losses 
of any Connecticut regiment in the Civil War. The regiment remained active 
to the end of the war, and its final mustering out September 5, 1865.[5]

voted for Republican presidential candidates more often than the rest of 
the state. In 2004 Bush won 51% to Kerry's 46%, making Litchfield the only 
county in southern New England that Bush carried. Litchfield was one of 
two Connecticut counties won by George H. W. Bush in 1992.[21] But in 2008, 
no county in Connecticut, including Litchfield, was won by Republican candidate 
John McCain. The county also went for the Democratic presidential candidate 
in 1964, 1996, and 2000. In 2012 it was the only county won by Mitt Romney 
in the state.[22] Litchfield is served by the Northwestern Connecticut 
Transit District.[23][24] Boroughs are incorporated portions of one or 
more towns with separate borough councils, zoning boards, and borough officials. 
Villages are named localities, but have no separate corporate existence 
from the towns they are in. All areas of the county are in area code 860 
except for the towns of Woodbury, Bethlehem and a small part of Roxbury, 
which are in the area code 203/area code 475 overlay. The geographical 
Woodbury Telephone Exchange (of the now defunct Woodbury Telephone Company) 
serves the two towns as well as the town of Southbury, which is in New 
Haven County and the small part of Roxbury. Ten digit dialing took effect 
for both area codes on November 14, 2009 as a result of the 203/475 overlay 
and the planned but not implemented 860/959 overlay. Coordinates: 41°47′N
