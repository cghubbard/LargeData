Rocco Domenico "Rocky" Colavito, Jr. (born August 10, 1933) is a former 
right fielder in Major League Baseball best known for his years with the 
Cleveland Indians. Colavito was the fifth player in American League history 
to have eleven consecutive 20-home run seasons (1956–66), and he exceeded 
40 home runs three times and 100 runs batted in six times during that span. 
He also led the AL in home runs, RBI and slugging average once each. Hitting 
all but three of his 374 career home runs in the AL, he ranked behind only 
Jimmie Foxx (524) and Harmon Killebrew (then at 397) among the league's 
right-handed hitters when he retired. In 1965, playing every game, Colavito 
became the first outfielder in AL history to complete a season with a perfect 
1.000 fielding percentage. His 1272 games in right field ranked eighth 
in American League history at the end of his career. Colavito currently 
lives in Berks County, Pennsylvania. Colavito grew up in The Bronx as a 
devoted fan of the New York Yankees, particularly Joe DiMaggio. By age 
nine he was playing semipro baseball, and he dropped out of school at age 
16 to pursue a baseball career. Major League rules called for a player 
to wait until his school class graduated before signing, and only a special 
appeal allowed him to go pro after a one-year wait. The Yankees expressed 
little interest in him, and the Philadelphia Athletics had to bow out due 
to financial problems; the Cleveland Indians finally signed him in 1950, 
with two-thirds of his signing bonus deferred until he progressed in their 
system. He spent most of the next six years working his way up. With the 
Indianapolis Indians in 1954, Colavito would hit 38 home runs and accumulate 
116 RBIs.[1] After breaking in with the Indians briefly in 1955, he started 
1956 in the Pacific Coast League, once showing off his throwing arm by 
hurling a ball over the center-field wall from home plate, with his longest 
mark at 436 feet (133 m). He returned to the Indians in July, and after 
batting .276 with 21 home runs he earned one vote in the AL Rookie of the 
Year voting. After slipping to a .252 average in 1957, in 1958 he batted 
.303 with 41 home runs (one behind Mickey Mantle's league lead) and 113 
runs batted in, and finished third in the MVP balloting. He also led the 
AL in slugging with a .620 average, the highest by a right-handed Indians 
hitter until Albert Belle in 1994. One year later Colavito became the first 
Indian to have two 40-HR seasons; with 42, he tied Harmon Killebrew for 
the AL lead and was one short of Al Rosen's club record. He finished fourth 
in the MVP vote, and also made the All-Star team for the first time; he 
was eventually chosen in six years, including both All-Star Games in 1959, 
1961 and 1962, when two were played annually. On June 10, 1959 he smashed 
four homers in consecutive at bats in a single game at the Baltimore Orioles' 
cavernous Memorial Stadium.[2] He later hit four home runs on the same 
day while playing for Detroit, but they were distributed between the two 
games of a double header. The Indians finished five games behind the Chicago 
White Sox in the 1959 pennant race, the closest he would come to a title 
until 1967. Colavito would hit 30-plus homers seven times, establishing 
himself as a major power hitter and as an excellent fielder with a strong 
arm despite being flat-footed. Colavito was easily the Cleveland fans' 
favorite, with his handsome appearance and approachability, always accommodating 
the hundreds of autograph seekers after each game even if it took a few 
hours. But just days before the Opening Day of the 1960 season, Indians 
general manager Frank Lane traded him to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey 
Kuenn, who had won the 1959 batting title. The trade proved to be a good 
one for the Tigers but a terrible, unpopular one for the Indians, whose 
fans lost their favorite player and best hitter. Kuenn had a minor injury 
early in the season and was traded away by the end of the year. Lane, whose 
reputation as a wheeler-dealer earned him the moniker Frank "Trader" Lane 
in the sports press, further irritated fans by saying, "What's all the 
fuss about? All I did was trade hamburger for steak." Tigers GM Bill DeWitt 
jokingly responded that he liked hamburger. In 1961 with the Tigers, Colavito 
enjoyed career highs of 45 home runs, 140 RBI and 129 runs scored as the 
team led the Major Leagues in scoring; he placed eighth in the MVP race. 
While in Detroit, he played left field, because Al Kaline was established 
in right field. Yet Tiger fans didn't take to him the same way as those 
in Cleveland, preferring the more consistent Kuenn; and sportswriter Joe 
Falls, who viewed Colavito as a "self-ordained deity", started a feature 
chronicling the runs he failed to drive in. In one game, Falls – acting 
as the official scorer – charged Colavito with a controversial error, and 
the outfielder tried to attack him; and on May 12, 1961, he was ejected 
from the game after climbing into the stands to go after a drunken fan 
who had been insulting his wife and father. The Detroit journalist kept 
a statistic on Colavito during his years as a member of the Detroit Tigers. 
When Colavito stranded a runner, Falls would give him an RNBI (Run Not 
Batted In).[3] This infuriated Colavito and created a tense relationship 
between the two for several years. After his excellent 1961 season, he 
drew the local fans' criticism by holding out for a higher salary than 
established team star Al Kaline. He was traded to the Athletics (at that 
time in Kansas City) after the 1963 season, but spent only one year with 
the team, becoming one of the youngest players to reach the 300-home-run 
mark. In 1965, with Gabe Paul running the Indians, Colavito was brought 
back; but to obtain the slugger in a three-team deal, Paul had to send 
the White Sox pitcher Tommy John, who would play until 1986 and win 286 
games after the trade, as well as Tommie Agee, who won the Rookie of the 
Year award in 1966, then became the New York Mets' top hitter in 1969 as 
they won their first pennant. Colavito made his last years in Cleveland 
worthwhile, making the All-Star team in 1965 and 1966 and placing fifth 
in the 1965 MVP vote after leading the league with 108 RBI and 93 walks 
while finishing among the AL's top five in home runs, hits and runs, as 
well as playing without an error in the outfield. In July 1967 he was traded 
to the Chicago White Sox after hitting only .241; he hit .221 with the 
Sox, who finished three games out of first, and was sent to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers before the next season, batting .204 with 3 home runs in his National 
League debut. Later in that final season of 1968, with his last team, his 
boyhood idol Yankees, he became the last position player until Brent Mayne 
in 2000 to be credited as the winning pitcher in a game, earned in a scoreless 
two and two-thirds inning relief appearance in the first game of a doubleheader 
– against his former team, the league-leading Detroit Tigers. Not only 
did he face down Al Kaline and Willie Horton, he further vexed the Tigers 
by scoring the winning run for the Yanks in the eighth inning. He also 
homered in the second game. Colavito's pitching feat was not seen again 
in the AL until May 6, 2012, when Baltimore Oriole Chris Davis earned a 
win.[4] Colavito coached for the Indians in the 1970s and the Kansas City 
Royals in the early to mid 1980s.[5][6][7][8] In 1982 Colavito and Royals 
Manager Dick Howser were involved in a traffic accident and struggle with 
police.[9] Howser and Colavito were convicted of interfering with police 
and received 90-day jail sentences. Both successfully appealed and served 
six months of probation.[10] Colavito was involved in the 1983 pine tar 
game and was ejected for arguing the umpires' decision to negate George 
Brett's home run and call him out, which would have given the Yankees the 
win.[11] (The decision was later overturned. When the game was resumed 
several days later with the Royals in the lead as the result of Brett's 
home run, the Royals held the lead and won the game.)[12] In his 1,841-game 
career, Colavito batted .266 with 374 HRs, 1,159 RBI, 971 runs, 1,730 hits, 
283 doubles and 21 triples. As an outfielder, he recorded 3323 putouts, 
123 assists, 26 double plays, and committed 70 errors in 3516 total chances 
for a .980 fielding percentage. In 1976 he was voted the most memorable 
personality in Indians history, and in 2001 he received a huge ovation 
at the introduction of the Indians' All-Century team.[13] During his Major 
League career Colavito wore either a #6, #7, or #21 jersey. In 1994, Terry 
Pluto, who covered the Indians for The Plain Dealer in the 1980s and became 
the top sports columnist for the Akron Beacon Journal (but returned to 
The Plain Dealer in 2007), published The Curse of Rocky Colavito, a book 
that tried to explain why the Indians had not come within even 11 games 
of first place since 1959. His explanation was that the trade of Colavito 
in 1960 sent the team on a path to mediocrity that lasted more than three 
decades, also suggesting that the trade to bring Colavito back was as bad 
as the one that sent him away. When the Indians finally won their first 
pennant in 41 years in 1995, Pluto wrote a sequel, Burying the Curse. The 
Indians also won the pennant in 1997, but lost the World Series both times, 
the second time after needing just two more outs in Game 7 to win. Insisting 
that the curse was still in effect, Pluto wrote Our Tribe, a history of 
the team, in 1999. The Indians' next American League Pennant came 19 years 
later, in 2016. Their last World Series title was in 1948, when they defeated 
the Boston Braves. The book Portrait of a Franchise: An Intimate Look at 
Cleveland Indians Baseball During the Rockin' Sixties by Doug Kurkul reflects 
on Colavito's unique contributions to the Indians, and argues a case for 
his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. On July 29, 2006, Colavito, 
along with Ray Chapman, Addie Joss, Sam McDowell, Al Rosen, Herb Score 
and manager Al López, was inducted into the Cleveland Indians' Hall of
