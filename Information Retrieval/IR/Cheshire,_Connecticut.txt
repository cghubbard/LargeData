Connecticut Route 10, a difficult passage that is busy, sometimes congested, 
and includes many stoplights. There are two east-west routes: Route 42 
and Route 68/Route 70. Route 10 is by far the busiest road in Cheshire, 
with the worst Route 10 traffic occurring between Routes 68/70 and Route 
42 every weekday during the morning commute, evening commute, and after 
the high school gets out at 2 pm. West Main Street and Main Street, Route

is home to two large state prison facilities located in the northern section 
of town. The larger of these facilities is the Cheshire Correctional Institution, 
which opened in 1913. In 1982, the Manson Youth Institution opened adjacent

The larger of these prisons is located across the street from Chapman Elementary
