Chad Griffin Durbin (born December 3, 1977) is a former Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher. He played with the Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals and 
Cleveland Indians of the American League, Arizona Diamondbacks, Washington 
Nationals, Philadelphia Phillies and Atlanta Braves of the National League. 
He attended Woodlawn High School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.[1] Durbin signed 
with the Tigers as a minor league free agent prior to the 2006 baseball 
season.[1] He was a part of the 2006 International League champion Toledo 
Mud Hens,[2] while also making 3 late-season appearances with the Tigers.[3] 
During 2007 spring training, Durbin was in the mix for one of the final 
spots in the Tigers bullpen. However, starting pitcher Kenny Rogers soon 
went on the disabled list with a shoulder injury, and the Tigers turned 
to Durbin to fill his spot in the rotation. Durbin served as a starting 
pitcher for several stints, before ultimately joining the bullpen. Pitching 
in relief, Durbin served several roles, including long relief and setup.[4] 
During a game on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball against the Atlanta Braves, 
Durbin had a sacrifice fly for his first career RBI.[5] He also recorded 
his first major league save in the same game.[6] On December 12, 2007, 
Durbin was not offered a new contract by the Tigers and he became a free 
agent. On December 20, 2007, he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies to 
compete for a spot in their starting rotation. Though he lost out to Adam 
Eaton for a starting spot, Durbin enjoyed a strong season out of the bullpen 
for the eventual World Series Champions. In 2009, Durbin earned the first 
two postseason victories of his career, as he was the winning pitcher in 
Game 3 of the NLDS against the Colorado Rockies and Game 5 of the NLCS 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The latter clinched a second straight 
trip to the World Series for the Phillies, where they'd lose to the New 
York Yankees in six games. Durbin spent one more season with the Phillies 
before rejoining the Indians as a free agent on March 1, 2011.[7] Durbin 
signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals on February 
1, 2012. He was released from Nationals after Spring Training. He was then 
signed by the Atlanta Braves to a one-year contract. With the Braves, he 
has posted an ERA of 3.13. On January 28, 2013, Durbin signed a one-year 
deal with the Phillies with a base salary of $1,100,000 and possible incentives 
totaling $350,000. The signing did not work out; the Phillies released 
Durbin on May 31, 2013 following a series of poor outings during which 
he had an ERA of 9.00.[8] Durbin retired on November 25, 2013.[9] Durbin 
lives with his wife Crystal and sons Cade and Cavan and daughter Caris[citation
