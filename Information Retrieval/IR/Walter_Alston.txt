As player As manager Walter Emmons Alston (December 1, 1911 – October 1, 
1984), nicknamed "Smokey", was an American baseball player and manager 
in Major League Baseball (MLB). He is best known for managing the Brooklyn/Los 
Angeles Dodgers between 1954 and 1976. Alston signed 23 one-year contracts 
with the Dodgers.[1] He had a calm, reticent demeanor, for which he was 
sometimes also known as "The Quiet Man". Alston grew up in rural Ohio and 
lettered in baseball and basketball at Miami University in Ohio. Though 
his MLB playing career consisted of one game and one at-bat with the St. 
Louis Cardinals in 1936, he played and managed for several seasons in minor 
league baseball. His service included a stint as manager of the Nashua 
Dodgers, the first integrated professional team in modern baseball. He 
was promoted to manage the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954 after several successful 
seasons in Brooklyn's Class AAA minor league teams. As a major league manager, 
Alston led Dodgers teams to seven National League (NL) pennants and four 
world championships. His 1955 team was the only World Series championship 
team while the club was in Brooklyn; they clinched the NL pennant earlier 
in the calendar year than any previous pennant winner in league history. 
Alston retired with more than 2,000 career wins and managed NL All-Star 
teams to seven victories. He was selected as Manager of the Year six times. 
Alston was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983. He suffered 
a heart attack that year, was hospitalized for a month and was unable to 
attend his Hall of Fame induction ceremony. He never fully recovered and 
he died at a hospital in Oxford, Ohio on October 1, 1984. Alston was born 
in Venice, Ohio.[2] He spent much of his childhood on a farm in Morning 
Sun, Ohio. When Alston was a teenager, the family moved to Darrtown, Ohio.[3] 
He attended Milford Township High School in Darrtown.[4] He received the 
nickname "Smokey" as a high school pitcher, owing to the speed of his fastball.[5] 
He graduated from high school in 1929 and married longtime girlfriend Lela 
Vaughn Alexander the next year.[6] In 1935, Alston graduated with a degree 
in industrial arts and physical education from Miami University in Oxford, 
Ohio. He said that finances were a challenge in college and that he had 
paid his way through school by playing pool.[6] He lettered three years 
in both basketball and baseball.[7] Alston played minor league baseball 
as an infielder for the Greenwood Chiefs and Huntington Red Birds in 1935 
and 1936, respectively. For the 1936 Huntington team, he hit 35 home runs 
in 120 games.[8] Alston's only major league game was with the St. Louis 
Cardinals on September 27, 1936, substituting for Johnny Mize at first 
base. He later described his major league playing career to a reporter 
by saying, "Well, I came up to bat for the Cards back in '36, and Lon Warneke 
struck me out. That's it". He also committed one error in two fielding 
chances at first base.[9] Alston returned to the minor leagues after his 
brief MLB appearance. He split the 1937 season between the Houston Buffaloes 
and Rochester Red Wings, hitting for a combined .229 batting average. Alston 
played for the Portsmouth Red Birds in 1938, finishing the season with 
a .311 average and 28 home runs as Portsmouth won its only Middle Atlantic 
League championship.[8][10] He returned to Portsmouth in 1940, hit 28 home 
runs and was a player-manager for part of the season. He was a player-manager 
for the next two seasons with the Springfield Cardinals and even appeared 
in seven games as a pitcher in 1942. He returned to Rochester as a first 
baseman and third baseman in 1943. He moved to the Trenton Packers, where 
he was a player-manager in 1944 and 1945.[8] Alston had been offered the 
job in Trenton, a minor league farm club of the Brooklyn Dodgers, by Branch 
Rickey, the executive who had signed him as a player with St. Louis.[11] 
After his two seasons with Trenton, Alston served as a player-manager for 
the first integrated U.S. baseball team based in the twentieth century, 
the Nashua Dodgers of the Class-B New England League. Alston managed black 
Dodgers prospects Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella, leading Nashua to a 
New England League title in 1946.[11] Alston later said that he did not 
give much consideration to racial issues and that he had simply thought 
about how much they would benefit the team.[12] Alston led the Pueblo Dodgers 
to the Western League title the next season. He appeared as a player in 
two games, which were his final professional playing appearances.[3] For 
his 13-season minor league playing career, Alston hit .295 with 176 home 
runs. However, he hit only .239 in 535 at bats in Class AA, which was the 
highest minor league classification through 1945.[8][13] In 1948, Alston 
managed the St. Paul Saints, a Dodgers Class AAA affiliate, to an 86-68 
win-loss record. The team finished in third place, 14 games behind an Indianapolis 
Indians team managed by Al López.[14] That year, Alston managed Campanella 
again, where Campanella integrated the American Association. The media 
was critical of Alston for playing Campanella; they said that the catcher 
was simply there to integrate the league. Campanella hit 13 home runs in 
35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers.[15] 
The 1949 Saints finished with a 93-60 record and four of its players collected 
more than 90 runs batted in (RBI).[16] The team finished in first place, 
half a game in front of Indianapolis.[17] During the baseball off-season, 
Alston worked as a teacher in Darrtown.[18] From 1950 to 1953, Alston managed 
another Dodgers AAA affiliate, the Montreal Royals of the International 
League. The team won between 86 and 95 games during each season of Alston's 
tenure.[19] The 1951 and 1952 Montreal Royals won International League 
pennants.[20][21] In 1951 and 1953, Montreal won the Governors' Cup playoff 
tournament. Alston was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame 
many years later.[22] Alston was named manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers 
for the 1954 season.[3] His predecessor, Charlie Dressen, had moved on 
from the Dodgers after the team's leadership refused to sign him to a two-year 
or three-year contract.[23] Dressen had won two pennants in three years 
and nearly won a third.[24] Dodgers executive Buzzie Bavasi fought for 
Alston to be hired in Brooklyn. Bringing Alston to Brooklyn has been described 
as Bavasi's biggest contribution to the team's history. Alston was an unknown 
at the major league level and the New York Daily News reported his hiring 
with the headline "Walter Who?"[25] Becoming immediately known for his 
quiet nature, Alston was sometimes referred to as "The Quiet Man".[26] 
Alston's personality contrasted with that of Dressen, who was much more 
outspoken. Sportswriters had difficulty writing about Alston at first because 
he did not say much. He also seemed more conservative in his decisions 
on the field, which drew criticism from his players even though he had 
managed many of them in the minor leagues. Don Zimmer said that he had 
learned more from Dressen and that Dressen knew more about baseball than 
Alston. Jackie Robinson did not like Alston at first either, according 
to Robinson's wife.[27] Alston commented on his approach, saying, "I never 
criticized a player for a mistake on the spot. Whenever I got steamed up 
about something, I always wanted to sleep on it and face the situation 
with a clear head."[18] Sportswriter Jim Murray said that Alston was "the 
only guy in the game who could look Billy Graham right in the face without 
blushing and who would order corn on the cob in a Paris restaurant."[28] 
The 1954 Dodgers finished second in the NL as both Gil Hodges and Duke 
Snider hit at least 40 home runs and registered 130 runs batted in.[29] 
The 1955 Dodgers got off to a strong start. Even so, an Associated Press 
article noted that Alston was reticent in response to questions and that 
he did not seem like a manager who had won ten consecutive games.[30] The 
1955 Brooklyn team won the pennant and its only World Series championship. 
They clinched the NL pennant earlier in the year than any team had in NL 
history.[31] In the World Series, Alston started Johnny Podres, who had 
a mediocre 9-10 regular season record, in the third and seventh games; 
Podres won both games.[32] The pitcher had struggled with arm problems 
for much of the season.[33] Sandy Koufax emerged as a pitcher for the Dodgers 
during that championship season.[34] Alston was criticized by Jackie Robinson 
and others over his sparse use of Koufax in his early career. During Koufax's 
second MLB start, he pitched a shutout, giving up two hits and striking 
out 14 batters. However, that success did not prompt a lot of opportunities 
for Koufax. The pitcher appeared in only 12 games that season, mostly in 
relief.[35] The 1956 team repeated as NL champions;[36] the team was bolstered 
by the play of Duke Snider, who hit a league-leading 43 home runs and also 
led the league in walks.[37] They fell to third place (84-70) in 1957.[36] 
The team finished in seventh place (71-83) in 1958, the club's first season 
after moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles.[36] Criticism of Alston had 
begun to mount during that season, but he led the Dodgers to a world championship 
in 1959.[38] Six players on the 1959 team finished with double-digit totals 
in home runs, while 22-year-old Don Drysdale led the team's pitchers with 
17 wins.[39] Several Los Angeles players, including Wally Moon, characterized 
Alston as indecisive in the late 1950s and 1960s. However, Moon later came 
to describe Alston as a good manager who had gotten "good mileage" out 
of his players.[40] Managing the NL All-Star Team in 1960, Alston attracted 
some controversy when he left Milwaukee Braves pitchers Warren Spahn and 
Lew Burdette off the All-Star roster. An Associated Press report said the 
omission may have been a snub directed at Dressen, who was by then managing 
in Milwaukee.[41] The 1960 Dodgers finished in fourth place. The following 
year, the team finished in second place after veteran Duke Snider missed 
two months with a broken arm.[42] The Dodgers lost the lead in the 1962 
NL pennant race and rumors surfaced that Alston and coach Leo Durocher 
might be fired, but the team retained both men for 1963.[43] The Dodgers 
won the 1963 World Series. This series represented the first time that 
the New York Yankees had lost a World Series in four games. Alston's pitchers 
excelled, as Koufax struck out 23 batters over two games and Drysdale threw 
a shutout in Game 3. Over the four games, Alston employed only three starting 
pitchers and one relief pitcher in the series.[44] In 1964, the team finished 
80-82 in its first losing season in several years.[4] Alston used the team's 
1964 performance to motivate them moving forward. In spring training before 
the 1965 season, he said that he would not let his team forget the difficulties 
they had in the previous season.[45] The Dodgers returned to the 1965 World 
Series. Alston could not start his number one pitcher, Koufax, in the opening 
game of that series because Koufax was observing Yom Kippur. Instead, Alston 
turned to Drysdale, who struggled, lasting 2 2⁄3 innings and surrendering 
seven runs. When Alston came to the mound to remove him, Drysdale said 
to his manager, "I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too."[46] The team 
recovered from losing that first game and they won the World Series in 
seven games.[4] Koufax appeared in three games during the series, registering 
two shutouts.[46] Alston's Dodgers teams of the 1960s benefited from the 
strong pitching by Drysdale and Koufax. In 1966, both players held out 
of spring training and demanded three-year contracts each worth $500,000, 
which was more money than anyone was making in baseball at the time. The 
players were eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that 
year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers went to the 1966 World Series 
but were defeated in four games. Koufax retired after the season on the 
advice of doctors who examined his sore arm.[47] Drysdale retired three 
years later.[48] Both men had pitched their entire major league careers 
for Alston.[49] Alston guided his teams to at least 85 wins per season 
between 1969 and 1976.[4] They finished in second place in their division 
six times during that span.[36] The team came very close to a pennant in 
1971; after falling 11 games out of first place, the team performed well 
late in the season and finished one game behind the San Francisco Giants. 
Beginning in 1973, Alston's team featured an infield of Steve Garvey, Davey 
Lopes, Bill Russell and Ron Cey. The group played together for eight years, 
remaining together long after the end of Alston's tenure.[50] In 1974, 
the Dodgers won the NL pennant and went to the World Series to face the 
Oakland Athletics. Alston used closer Mike Marshall in a record-setting 
106 games that season and Marshall won the Cy Young Award.[51] Alston received 
some media attention when he considered using Marshall as a starter.[52] 
Marshall ended up appearing in all five games of the series and gave up 
one run in nine innings, but he did not start a game. The Dodgers lost 
the series four games to one.[53] The 1975 and 1976 Dodgers won 88 and 
92 games respectively, but they finished well out of first place in both 
seasons.[36] In September 1976, Alston announced that he would retire at 
the end of the season.[54] At a press conference, Alston said, "I've been 
in baseball for 41 years and it's been awfully good to me. This has been 
a pretty big day. I had three birdies playing golf for the first time in 
my life and now I'm announcing that I'm stepping down as manager. I told 
Peter this afternoon to give somebody else a chance to manage the club."[55] 
Alston retired with 2,063 wins (2,040 in the regular season and 23 in the 
postseason).[4] Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times.[56] 
He also managed NL All-Star squads a record nine times and won seven of 
those games.[57] At a time when multi-year contracts were on the rise, 
Alston's managerial career consisted of 23 one-year contracts.[54] He earned 
seven NL pennants in that span.[4] Sportswriter Leonard Koppett described 
Alston's role with the Dodgers, pointing out that O'Malley was always seen 
as "the boss" while Alston stuck to the on-field management of the team. 
Koppett said that Alston's loyalty and subdued nature contributed to the 
stability that the team enjoyed.[58] O'Malley once commented that Alston 
was "non-irritating. Do you realize how important it is to have a manager 
who doesn't irritate you?"[6] The Dodgers retired Alston's number the year 
after he stepped down as manager; he was only the fourth Dodger to receive 
that honor.[59] He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and 
Museum in 1983.[60] Alston suffered a heart attack that year and was hospitalized 
for a month.[18] Alston's grandson traveled to Cooperstown to represent 
the ill former manager at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony.[61] Alston 
died in an Oxford hospital from complications from the recent heart attack 
on October 1, 1984. He was 72.[18] A funeral home spokesman said that Alston 
had remained ill since the heart attack.[62] He is interred at Darrtown 
Cemetery in Darrtown, Ohio.[3] Upon Alston's death, MLB commissioner Peter 
Ueberroth referred to him as one of baseball's greatest managers.[63] Former 
Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional run-ins with Alston, 
but he said that Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of 
each team that he managed.[64] Tommy Lasorda, who played and coached under 
Alston and ultimately succeeded him as manager, commented on how easy it 
was to play for Alston.[64] Broadcaster Vin Scully said, "I always imagined 
him to be the type who could ride shotgun on a stage through Indian territory. 
He was all man and two yards tall. He was very quiet, very controlled. 
He never made excuses. He gave the players the credit and he took the blame. 
He was so solid, so American."[65] Ohio State Route 177 was named the Walter 
"Smokey" Alston Memorial Highway in 1999.[66] He was inducted into the 
International League Hall of Fame in 2010.[67] In April 2013, readers of 
the Los Angeles Times named Alston number 16 on a list of the 20 greatest 
Dodgers of all time.[68] A memorial to Alston is located at Milford Township
