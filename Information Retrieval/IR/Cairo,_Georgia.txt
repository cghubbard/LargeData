Cairo i/ˈkeɪ.roʊ/[3] is a city in Grady County, Georgia, United States. 
As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 9,607.[4] The city 
is the county seat of Grady County, Georgia.[5] Cairo was founded in 1835. 
It was incorporated as a town in 1870 and as a city in 1906. In 1905, Cairo 
was designated seat of the newly formed Grady County.[6] The city was named 
after Cairo, the capital of Egypt.[7] Although Cairo is nicknamed the "Syrup 
City" it has no relationship with the Karo brand of syrup, which is pronounced 
like the city's name. Rather, Cairo earned its nickname by producing cane 
syrup from the early 1900s through the late 1990s. Of the several companies 
that produced cane syrup, Roddenbery's was the best known. Roddenbery's 
later became better known for its pickles and the world's largest outdoor 
brine yard, however the company was sold to Dean Foods in 1993 and the 
local factory shut down. Reflecting its "syrup" heritage, the Cairo High 
School football team is nicknamed the Syrupmakers, and the school mascot 
is the agriculturally based sugar cane farmer/syrupmaker similar to the 
Cornhusker and Boilermaker. According to local tradition, this began during 
a rainy football game, when the players wore donated ponchos with "Roddenbery 
Syrup" printed on them. The most widely accepted tradition and the one 
with the most supportive evidence claims that a newspaper reporter referred 
to the Cairo Tigers in print as "the syrupmakers from Cairo." The school's 
female athletic teams are named "Syrup Maids," often shortened to "Maids," 
while the male athletes are often dubbed "Makers." In 1986 ESPN chose "Syrupmakers" 
as the No. 1 nickname for a high school sports team. In 2009, ESPN's Sports 
Center selected the Syrupmakers as their number one mascot in the high 
school heritage category. Cairo is close to great hunting, fishing, and 
points of historical interest. The local industrial base continues to grow 
with manufacturing, service, and healthcare companies anchoring a strong 
economy. The area is home to several local festivals, including Calvary's 
Mule Day, Whigham's Rattlesnake Roundup, Cairo's own Antique Car Rally, 
and several competitive recreational programs. The Antique Car Rally features 
a wide range of cars, and includes many activities: a poker run, a parade, 
and even a street dance. It usually takes place on the second weekend of 
May. Sponsored by Mr. Chick, it is an annual event that attracts many people 
to the southwest corner of Georgia. Grady County Schools serves the city.
