El Cajon (/ɛlkəˈhoʊn/; Spanish: [elkaˈxon]) is a city in San Diego County, 
California, United States. In a valley surrounded by mountains, the city 
has acquired the nickname of "The Big Box."[6] Its name originated similarly, 
from the Spanish phrase "el cajón," which means "the box" or "the drawer." 
El Cajon, Spanish for "the big box," was first recorded on September 10, 
1821, as an alternative name for sitio rancho Santa Mónica to describe 
the "boxed in" nature of the valley in which it sat. The name appeared 
on maps in 1873 and 1875, shortened to "Cajon," until the modern town developed 
in which the post office was named "Elcajon." In 1905, the name was once 
again expanded to "El Cajon" under the insistence of California banker 
and historian, Zoeth Skinner Eldredge.[7] El Cajon is located at 32°47′54″N 
116°57′36″W﻿ / ﻿32.79833°N 116.96000°W﻿ / 32.79833; -116.96000 (32.798300, 
-116.960055).[8] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city 
has a total area of 14.4 square miles (37 km2), all land. It is bordered 
by San Diego and La Mesa on the west, Spring Valley on the south, Santee 
on the north, and unincorporated San Diego County on the east. It includes 
the neighborhoods of Fletcher Hills, Bostonia, and Rancho San Diego. Under 
the Köppen climate classification system, El Cajon straddles areas of Mediterranean 
climate (CSa) and semi-arid climate (BSh). As a result, it is often described 
as "arid Mediterranean" and "semi-arid Steppe". Like most inland areas 
in Southern California, the climate varies dramatically within a short 
distance, known as microclimate. El Cajon's climate has greater extremes 
compared to coastal San Diego. The farther east from the coast, the more 
arid the climate gets, until one reaches the mountains, where precipitation 
increases due to orographic uplift.[9][10] El Cajon's climate is warm during 
summer with mean temperatures averaging 70.1 °F (21.2 °C) or higher and 
cool during winter with mean temperatures averaging 55.4 °F (13.0 °C) or 
higher. The warmest month of the year is August with an average maximum 
temperature of 88.1 °F (31.2 °C), while the coldest month of the year is 
December with an average minimum temperature of 40.3 °F (4.6 °C). Temperature 
variations between night and day tend to be moderate with an average difference 
of 24 °F (13 °C) during the summer, and an average difference of 26 °F 
(14 °C) during the winter. The annual average precipitation at El Cajon 
is 11.96 inches (30.4 cm). Rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout 
the winter months, but rare in summer. The wettest month of the year is 
December with an average rainfall of 3.80 inches (9.7 cm). The record high 
temperature was 113 °F (45 °C) on June 14, 1917; September 1, 1955; July 
22, 2006; and September 27, 2010. The record low temperature was 19 °F 
(−7 °C) on January 8, 1913. The wettest year was 1941 with 28.14 inches 
(71.5 cm) and the dryest year was 1989 with 1.51 inches (3.8 cm). The most 
rainfall in one month was 11.43 inches (29.0 cm) in January 1993. The most 
rainfall in 24 hours was 5.60 inches (14.2 cm) on January 27, 1916. A rare 
snowfall in November 1992 totaled 0.3 inches (0.76 cm).[11] 3 inches of 
snow covered the ground in January 1882. During Spanish rule (1769–1821), 
the government encouraged settlement of territory now known as California 
by the establishment of large land grants called ranchos, from which the 
English word ranch is derived. Land grants were made to the Roman Catholic 
Church which set up numerous missions throughout the region. In the early 
nineteenth century, mission padres' search for pasture land led them to 
the El Cajon Valley. Surrounding foothills served as a barrier to straying 
cattle and a watershed to gather the sparse rainfall. For years the pasture 
lands of El Cajon supported the cattle herds of the mission and its native 
Indian converts. It was not until the Mexican era (1821–1846) that titles 
to plots of land were granted to individuals. The original intent of the 
1834 secularization legislation was to have church property divided among 
the former mission Indians. However, most of the grants were actually made 
to rich "Californios" of Spanish background who had long been casting envious 
eyes on the vast holdings of the Roman Catholic missions. In 1845 California 
Governor Pio Pico confiscated the lands of Mission San Diego de Alcala. 
He granted eleven square leagues (about 48,800 acres, 197 km2) of the El 
Cajon Valley to Dona Maria Antonio Estudillo, daughter of José Antonio 
Estudillo, alcalde of San Diego, to repay a $500 government obligation. 
The grant was originally called Rancho Santa Monica and encompassed present 
day El Cajon, Bostonia, Santee, Lakeside, Flinn Springs, and the eastern 
part of La Mesa. It also contained the 28-acre (0.11 km2) Rancho Cañada 
de los Coches grant. Maria Estudillo was the wife of Don Miguel Pedrorena 
(1808–1850), a native of Madrid, Spain, who had come to California from 
Peru in 1838 to operate a trading business. With the cession of California 
to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As 
required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho El Cajon was filed 
by Thomas W. Sutherland, guardian of Pedrorena's heirs (his son, Miguel, 
and his three daughters, Victoria, Ysabel and Elenain) with the Public 
Land Commission in 1852, confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the grant 
was patented in 1876. In 1868, Los Angeles land developer Isaac Lankershim 
bought the bulk of the Pedrorena's Rancho El Cajon holdings and employed 
Major Levi Chase, a former Union Army officer, as his agent. Chase received 
from Lankershim 7,624 acres (30.9 km2) known as the Chase Ranch. Lankershim 
hired Amaziah Lord Knox (1833–1918), a New Englander whom he had met in 
San Francisco, to manage Rancho El Cajon. In 1876, Knox established a hotel 
there to serve the growing number of people traveling between San Diego 
and Julian, where gold had been discovered in 1869. Room and board for 
a guest and horse cost $1 a night. The area became known as Knox's Corners 
and was later renamed.[12][13] By 1878 there were 25 families living in 
the valley and a portion of the hotel lobby became the valley post office 
with Knox as the first postmaster. El Cajon was incorporated as a city 
in 1912.[14] In the 1960s and 70s, Frontier Town, Big Oak Ranch, was a 
tourist attraction, featuring a typical frontier town themepark and a periodic 
simulated shootout. The park closed around 1980 and is being used for residential 
housing. The 2010 United States Census reported that El Cajon had a population

Until 2012 El Cajon was a general law city operating under a council-manager

city council.[22] On October 24, 2013, Mayor Mark Lewis resigned his position 
after coming under criticism for remarks he made about El Cajon's Chaldean 
community. Many notable figures including Congressman Juan Vargas and Neighborhood 
Market Association President Mark Arabo called for his resignation.[23] 
Lewis resigned shortly after due to health issues.[24] On November 12 the 
city council appointed Councilman Bill Wells, who had been serving as interim 
mayor, as the new mayor.The vote of the council was 4-0; Wells recused
