The 1978 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 96th season in the history 
of the franchise. The Phillies won their third straight National League 
East title with a record of 90-72, a game and a half over the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, as the Phillies defeated the Pirates in Pittsburgh on the next 
to last day of the season.[1][2] For the third consecutive season the Phillies 
came up short in the NLCS, as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated them three 
games to one, as they had the previous season. The Phils were managed by 
Danny Ozark and played their home games at Veterans Stadium. The Phillie 
Phanatic debuted on April 25, 1978 at The Vet when the Phils played the 
Chicago Cubs. Tim McCarver introduced the Phanatic on the "Captain Noah 
and His Magical Ark" show on WPVI-TV in his role promoting the team. The 
Phanatic was originally portrayed by Dave Raymond. Infielders Coaches Note:
