The following are the baseball events of the year 1968 throughout the world. 
In Major League Baseball, the trend throughout the 1960s was of increased 
pitching dominance.[1][2] After the record home run year by Roger Maris 
in 1961, the major leagues increased the size of the strike zone from the 
top of the batter's shoulders to the bottom of his knees.[3] A significant 
"power shortage" culminated in 1968, with far fewer runs scored than in 
the early 1960s.[1] Pitchers including Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals 
and Denny McLain of the Detroit Tigers dominated hitters, producing 339 
shutouts in 1968, almost double the number of shutouts thrown in 1962.[1] 
Individually, Gibson set a modern earned run average record of 1.12, the 
lowest in 54 years, and set a World Series record of 17 strikeouts in Game 
1. McLain won 31 regular season games, the only player to reach the 30 
win milestone since Dizzy Dean in 1934.[4] Mickey Lolich won three complete 
games in the World Series, the last player as of 2015 to do so. Luis Tiant 
of the Cleveland Indians had the American League's lowest ERA at 1.60 and 
allowed a batting average of only .168, a major league record.[1] Don Drysdale 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers threw a record 58 2/3 consecutive scoreless 
innings, and Catfish Hunter of the Oakland Athletics was the first American 
League pitcher to record a perfect game since Don Larsen in Game 5 of the 
1956 World Series during the 1968 season.[1] Hitting was anemic as Carl 
Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox would be the only American League hitter 
to finish the season with a batting average higher than .300.[1] Yastrzemski's 
batting average of .301 was the lowest batting average of any league batting 
champion. The American League's collective slugging average of .340 remains 
the lowest since 1915 (when the game was still in the so-called dead-ball 
era), while the collective batting average of .231 is the all-time lowest. 
As a result of the dropping offensive statistics, Major League Baseball 
Rules Committee took steps to reduce the advantage held by pitchers by 
lowering the height of the pitchers mound from 15 inches to 10 inches, 
and by reducing the size of the strike zone for the 1969 season.[5] 1969 
batting averages climbed back to their historical averages and never again 
would pitching have as large a statistical average over batting in the 
major leagues. 1968 was the final year when baseball had no divisions within 
the two leagues, with the only post-season competition being the World 
Series itself. Four expansion teams would join baseball for the season 
following in 1969. This was also the first season that the Athletics franchise 
played in Oakland, California, after their departure from Kansas City,
