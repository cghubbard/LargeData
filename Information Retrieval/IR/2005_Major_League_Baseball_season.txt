The 2005 Major League Baseball season was notable for the league's new 
steroid policy in the wake of the BALCO scandal, which enforced harsher 
penalties ever than before for steroid use in Major League Baseball. Several 
players, including veteran Rafael Palmeiro, were suspended under the new 
policy. Also, every team in the NL East division had at least 81 wins (at 
least half of the 162 games played). It was also notable for being the 
first season featuring a baseball team in Washington, D.C. for more than 
4 decades, with the Washington Nationals having moved from Montreal. The 
season ended when the Chicago White Sox defeated the Houston Astros in 
a four-game sweep in the World Series, winning their first championship 
since 1917. The standings in the National League East were quite notable 
because all the teams in that division finished with at least a .500 record. 
The San Diego Padres' record of 82–80 was also notable as it was the worst 
ever by a division champion in a full-length season. (It is not, strictly 
speaking, the worst record by a division champion as the strike-shortened 
1994 season ended with every team in the AL West at least 10 games under 
.500, nor is it the worst record by a team that made the postseason as 
due to the "split-season" format imposed in the wake of the 1981 Major 
League Baseball strike, the Kansas City Royals went to the playoffs as 
second-half AL West champions despite an overall record of 50–53.) The 
playoffs began on October 4, and ended on October 26. For more information,
