Marlborough (often spelled Marlboro) is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, 
United States. The population was 38,499 at the 2010 census. Marlborough 
became a prosperous industrial town in the 19th century and made the transition 
to high technology industry in the late 20th century after the construction 
of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Marlborough was declared a town in 1660. 
It was incorporated as a city in 1890 when it changed its Municipal charter 
from a New England town meeting system to a Mayor–council government. Christopher 
Allen was recorded as marshal of Marlborough in 1638 and married to Mary 
Wetherbee. John Howe, Jr. in 1656 was a fur trader and built a house at 
the intersection of two Indian trails, Nashua Trail and Connecticut path.[3] 
He could speak the language of the Algonquian Indians though the local 
tribe referred to themselves as the Pennacooks. The settlers were welcomed 
by the Indians because they protected them from other tribes they were 
at war with. In the 1650s, several families left the nearby town of Sudbury, 
18 miles west of Boston, to start a new town. The village was named after 
Marlborough, the market town in Wiltshire, England. It was first settled 
in 1657 by 14 men led by Edmund Rice, John Ruddock and John Howe; in 1656 
Rice and his colleagues petitioned the Massachusetts General Court to create 
the town of Marlborough and it was officially incorporated in 1660. Rice 
was elected a selectman at Marlborough in 1657. Sumner Chilton Powell wrote, 
in Puritan Village: The Formation of a New England Town, "Not only did 
Rice become the largest individual landholder in Sudbury, but he represented 
his new town in the Massachusetts legislature for five years and devoted 
at least eleven of his last fifteen years to serving as selectman and judge 
of small causes."[4] The Reverend William Brimstead was the first minister 
of the Puritan church and Johnathan Johnson was the first blacksmith. Marlborough 
was one of the seven "Praying Indian Towns" because they were converted 
to Christianity by the Rev. John Eliot of Roxbury. In 1674 a deed was drawn 
up dividing the land between the settlers and the natives. This is the 
only record of names of the natives. The settlement was almost destroyed 
by Native Americans in 1676 during King Philip's War. In 1711 Marlborough's 
territory included Northborough, Southborough, Westborough and Hudson. 
As population, business, and travel grew in the colonies, Marlborough became 
a favored rest stop on the Boston Post Road. Many travelers stopped at 
its inns and taverns, including George Washington, who visited the Williams 
Tavern (see citation below) soon after his inauguration in 1789.[5] In 
1836, Samuel Boyd, known as the "father of the city," and his brother Joseph, 
opened the first shoe manufacturing business - an act that would change 
the community forever. By 1890, with a population of 14,000, Marlborough 
had become a major shoe manufacturing center, producing boots for Union 
soldiers, as well as footwear for the civilian population. Marlborough 
became so well known for its shoes that its official seal was decorated 
with a factory, a shoe box, and a pair of boots when it was incorporated 
as a city in 1890.[6] The Civil War resulted in the creation of one of 
the region's most unusual monuments. Legend has it that a company from 
Marlborough, assigned to Harpers Ferry, appropriated the bell from the 
firehouse where John Brown last battled for the emancipation of the slaves. 
The company left the bell in the hands of one Mrs. Elizabeth Snyder for 
30 years, returning in 1892 to bring it back to Marlborough. The bell now 
hangs in a tower at the corner of Route 85 and Main Street. Around that 
time, Marlborough is believed to have been the first community in the country 
to receive a charter for a streetcar system, edging out Baltimore by a 
few months. The system, designed primarily for passenger use, provided 
access to Milford to the south, and Concord to the north. As a growing 
industrialized community, Marlborough began attracting skilled craftsmen 
from Quebec, Ireland, Italy, and Greece.[6] Shoe manufacturing continued 
in Marlborough long after the industry had fled many other New England 
communities. Rice & Hutchins, Inc. operated several factories in Marlborough 
from 1875 to 1929. Famous Frye boots were manufactured here through the 
1970s, and The Rockport Company, founded in Marlborough in 1971, continues 
to maintain an outlet store in the city. In 1990, when Marlborough celebrated 
its centennial as a city, the festivities included the construction of 
a park in acknowledgment of the shoe industry, featuring statues by the 
sculptor David Kapenteopolous. The construction of Interstates 495 and 
290 and the Massachusetts Turnpike has enabled the growth of the high technology 
and specialized electronics industries. With its easy access to major highways 
and the pro-business, pro-development policies of the city government, 
the population of Marlborough has more than doubled in the last 25 years 
to over 38,000 at the time of the last census.[when?] Bird's-eye view c.
