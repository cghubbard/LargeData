Canada competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States. 
Canada returned to the Summer Games after having participated in the American-led 
boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. 408 competitors, 257 men and 151 women, 
took part in 193 events in 23 sports.[1] Primarily due to the Soviet Union-led 
boycott of these Games, Canada enjoyed its best-ever results at the Summer 
Games, coming in sixth place in the number of Gold medals won, and fourth 
place in the total medals won - double their second best total in 1996 
and 2016. Women's Individual Competition: Men's 100 metres Men's 200 metres
