James Francis "Jim" Thorpe (Sac and Fox (Sauk): Wa-Tho-Huk, translated 
as "Bright Path";[1] May 22, 1887 – March 28, 1953)[2] was an American 
athlete and Olympic gold medalist. A member of the Sac and Fox Nation, 
Thorpe became the first Native American to win a gold medal for his home 
country. Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, 
he won Olympic gold medals in the 1912 pentathlon and decathlon, played 
American football (collegiate and professional), and also played professional 
baseball and basketball. He lost his Olympic titles after it was found 
he had been paid for playing two seasons of semi-professional baseball 
before competing in the Olympics, thus violating the amateurism rules that 
were then in place. In 1983, 30 years after his death, the International 
Olympic Committee (IOC) restored his Olympic medals. Thorpe grew up in 
the Sac and Fox Nation in Oklahoma. He played as part of several all American 
Indian teams throughout his career, and barnstormed as a professional basketball 
player with a team composed entirely of American Indians. From 1920 to 
1921, Thorpe was nominally the first president of the American Professional 
Football Association (APFA), which would become the National Football League 
(NFL) in 1922. He played professional sports until age 41, the end of his 
sports career coinciding with the start of the Great Depression. Thorpe 
struggled to earn a living after that, working several odd jobs. Thorpe 
suffered from alcoholism, and lived his last years in failing health and 
poverty. In a poll of sports fans conducted by ABC Sports, Thorpe was voted 
the Greatest Athlete of the Twentieth Century out of 15 other athletes 
including Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens, Wayne Gretzky, Jack Nicklaus, 
and Michael Jordan.[3][4] Information about Thorpe's birth, name and ethnic 
background varies widely.[5] He was baptized "Jacobus Franciscus Thorpe" 
in the Catholic Church. Thorpe was born in Indian Territory, but no birth 
certificate has been found. He was generally considered to have been born 
on May 22, 1887,[2] near the town of Prague, Oklahoma.[6] Thorpe himself 
said in an article in The Shawnee News-Star in 1949 that he was born May 
28, 1888, on his mother's allotment "near and south of Bellemont – Pottawatomie 
County – along the banks of the North Fork River ... hope this will clear 
up the inquiries as to my birthplace." However, most biographers believe 
that he was born on May 22, 1887, as that is what is listed on his baptismal 
certificate. Bellemont was a small community, now disappeared, on the line 
between Pottawatomie and Lincoln Counties.[7][8] While the town of Prague, 
Lincoln County, now claims to be the birthplace of Thorpe, there is no 
evidence that Thorpe himself called Prague his hometown. All his personal 
references were either Shawnee (the county seat of Pottawatomie County 
and about ten miles (16 km) southwest of his birthplace) or "Pott County". 
The Sac and Fox agency is in Stroud, Lincoln County, which could cause 
some of the confusion. Thorpe's parents were both of mixed-race ancestry. 
His father, Hiram Thorpe, had an Irish father and a Sac and Fox Indian 
mother. His mother, Charlotte Vieux, had a French father and a Potawatomi 
mother, a descendant of Chief Louis Vieux. He was raised as a Sac and Fox,[9] 
and his native name, Wa-Tho-Huk, translated as "path lit by great flash 
of lightning" or, more simply, "Bright Path".[5] As was the custom for 
Sac and Fox, he was named for something occurring around the time of his 
birth, in this case the light brightening the path to the cabin where he 
was born. Thorpe's parents were both Roman Catholic, a faith which Thorpe 
observed throughout his adult life.[10] Thorpe attended the Sac and Fox 
Indian Agency school in Stroud, Oklahoma, with his twin brother, Charlie. 
Charlie helped him through school until he succumbed to a bout of pneumonia 
when they were nine years old.[11] He ran away from school several times. 
His father then sent him to the Haskell Institute, an Indian boarding school 
in Lawrence, Kansas, so that he would not run away again.[12] When his 
mother died of childbirth complications two years later,[13] he became 
depressed. After several arguments with his father, he left home to work 
on a horse ranch.[12] In 1904 the sixteen-year-old Thorpe returned to his 
father and decided to attend Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, 
Pennsylvania. There his athletic ability was recognized and he was coached 
by Glenn Scobey "Pop" Warner, one of the most influential coaches of early 
American football history.[14] Later that year he became orphaned after 
Hiram Thorpe died from gangrene poisoning after being wounded in a hunting 
accident,[13] and Jim again dropped out of school. He resumed farm work 
for a few years and then returned to Carlisle Indian Industrial School.[12] 
Thorpe began his athletic career at Carlisle in 1907 when he walked past 
the track and beat all the school's high jumpers with an impromptu 5-ft 
9-in jump still in street clothes.[15] His earliest recorded track and 
field results come from 1907. He also competed in football, baseball, lacrosse 
and even ballroom dancing, winning the 1912 intercollegiate ballroom dancing 
championship.[16] Pop Warner was hesitant to allow Thorpe, his best track 
and field athlete, to compete in a physical game such as football.[17] 
Thorpe, however, convinced Warner to let him try some rushing plays in 
practice against the school team's defense; Warner assumed he would be 
tackled easily and give up the idea.[17] Thorpe "ran around past and through 
them not once, but twice".[17] He then walked over to Warner and said "Nobody 
is going to tackle Jim", while flipping him the ball.[17] Thorpe gained 
nationwide attention for the first time in 1911.[18] As a running back, 
defensive back, placekicker and punter, Thorpe scored all his team's points—four 
field goals and a touchdown—in an 18–15 upset of Harvard, a top ranked 
team in those early days of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.[17] 
His team finished the season 11–1. In 1912 Carlisle won the national collegiate 
championship largely as a result of his efforts – he scored 25 touchdowns 
and 198 points during the season.[14] Carlisle's 1912 record included a 
27–6 victory over Army.[6] In that game, Thorpe's 92-yard touchdown was 
nullified by a teammate's penalty, but on the next play Thorpe rushed for 
a 97-yard touchdown.[19] Future President Dwight Eisenhower, who played 
against him that season, recalled of Thorpe in a 1961 speech: "Here and 
there, there are some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes 
back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and he could do anything 
better than any other football player I ever saw."[14] He was awarded All-American 
honors in both 1911 and 1912.[6] Football was – and would remain – Thorpe's 
favorite sport.[20] He competed only sporadically in track and field, even 
though this turned out to be the sport in which he gained his greatest 
fame. In the spring of 1912, he started training for the Olympics. He had 
confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole 
vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer and 56 lb weight. In the Olympic trials 
held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all 
these events and so he riveted a claim to a place on the team that went 
to Sweden.[6] For the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, two new 
multi-event disciplines were included, the pentathlon and the decathlon. 
A pentathlon, based on the ancient Greek event, had been introduced at 
the 1906 Summer Olympics. The 1912 version consisted of the long jump, 
javelin throw, 200-meter dash, discus throw and 1500-meter run. The decathlon 
was a relatively new event in modern athletics, although it had been part 
of American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured 
on the program of the 1904 St. Louis Olympics. The events of the new decathlon 
differed slightly from the American version. Both seemed appropriate for 
Thorpe, who was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team 
in several track meets.[6] According to his obituary in The New York Times 
he could run the 100-yard dash in 10 seconds flat, the 220 in 21.8 seconds, 
the 440 in 51.8 seconds, the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35, the 120-yard 
high hurdles in 15 seconds, and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24 seconds.[6] 
He could long jump 23 ft 6 in and high-jump 6 ft 5 in.[6] He could pole 
vault 11 feet, put the shot 47 ft 9 in, throw the javelin 163 feet, and 
throw the discus 136 feet.[6] Thorpe entered the U.S. Olympic trials for 
both the pentathlon and the decathlon. He won the awards easily, winning 
three events, and was named to the pentathlon team, which also included 
future International Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage. There 
were only a few candidates for the decathlon team, however, and the trials 
were cancelled. His schedule in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon 
and pentathlon, he competed in the long jump and high jump. The first competition 
was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in 
the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the 
pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned 
for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. 
That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed 
fourth, and also took seventh place in the long jump. Even more remarkably, 
because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, 
he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing 
them.[21] He is shown in the 1912 photo wearing two different shoes and 
extra socks because one shoe was too big. Thorpe's final event was the 
decathlon, his first — and as it turned out, his only — Olympic decathlon. 
Strong competition from local favorite Hugo Wieslander was expected. Thorpe, 
however, easily defeated Wieslander by more than 700 points. He placed 
in the top four in all ten events, and his Olympic record of 8,413 points 
would stand for nearly two decades.[15] Overall, Thorpe won eight of the 
15 individual events comprising the pentathlon and decathlon. As was the 
custom of the day, the medals were presented to the athletes during the 
closing ceremonies of the games. Along with the two gold medals, Thorpe 
also received two challenge prizes, which were donated by King Gustav V 
of Sweden for the decathlon and Czar Nicholas II of Russia for the pentathlon. 
Several sources recount that, when awarding Thorpe his prize, King Gustav 
said, "You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world", to which Thorpe 
replied, "Thanks, King".[22][23] Contemporary sources from 1912 are lacking, 
suggesting that the story was apocryphal, however.[24] The anecdote appeared 
in newspapers as early as 1948, 36 years after his appearance in the Olympics,[25] 
and in books as early as 1952.[26] Thorpe's successes had not gone unnoticed 
at home, and he was honored with a ticker-tape parade on Broadway.[22] 
He remembered later, "I heard people yelling my name, and I couldn't realize 
how one fellow could have so many friends."[22] Apart from his track and 
field appearances, he also played in one of two exhibition baseball games 
at the 1912 Olympics, which featured two teams composed of U.S. track and 
field athletes. It was not Thorpe's first try at baseball, as the public 
would soon learn. After his victories at the Olympic Games in Sweden, on 
September 2, 1912, he returned to Celtic Park, the home of the Irish American 
Athletic Club, in Queens, New York (where he had qualified four months 
earlier for the Olympic Games), to compete in the Amateur Athletic Union's 
All-Around Championship. Competing against Bruno Brodd of the Irish American 
Athletic Club and J. Bredemus of Princeton University, he won seven of 
the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three. With 
a total point score of 7,476 points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 
7,385 points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by Martin Sheridan, 
the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club.[27] Sheridan, 
a five-time Olympic gold medalist, was present to watch his record broken, 
approached Thorpe after the event and shook his hand saying, "Jim, my boy, 
you're a great man. I never expect to look upon a finer athlete." He told 
a reporter from New York World, "Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever 
lived. He has me beaten fifty ways. Even when I was in my prime, I could 
not do what he did today."[28] In 1912, strict rules regarding amateurism 
were in effect for athletes participating in the Olympics. Athletes who 
received money prizes for competitions, were sports teachers or had competed 
previously against professionals were not considered amateurs and were 
barred from competition. In late January 1913, the Worcester Telegram published 
a story announcing that Thorpe had played professional baseball, and other 
U.S. newspapers followed up the story.[22][29] Thorpe had indeed played 
professional baseball in the Eastern Carolina League for Rocky Mount, North 
Carolina, in 1909 and 1910, receiving meager pay; reportedly as little 
as US$2 ($51 today) per game and as much as US$35 ($890 today) per week.[30] 
College players, in fact, regularly spent summers playing professionally 
but most used aliases, unlike Thorpe.[14] Although the public didn't seem 
to care much about Thorpe's past,[31] the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), 
and especially its secretary James Edward Sullivan, took the case very 
seriously.[32] Thorpe wrote a letter to Sullivan, in which he admitted 
playing professional baseball:[22] I hope I will be partly excused by the 
fact that I was simply an Indian schoolboy and did not know all about such 
things. In fact, I did not know that I was doing wrong, because I was doing 
what I knew several other college men had done, except that they did not 
use their own names ... His letter didn't help. The AAU decided to withdraw 
Thorpe's amateur status retroactively and asked the International Olympic 
Commission (IOC) to do the same. Later that year, the IOC unanimously decided 
to strip Thorpe of his Olympic titles, medals and awards and declare him 
a professional. Although Thorpe had played for money, the AAU and IOC did 
not follow the rules for disqualification. The rulebook for the 1912 Olympics 
stated that protests had to be made "within" 30 days from the closing ceremonies 
of the games.[19] The first newspaper reports did not appear until January 1913, 
about six months after the Stockholm Games had concluded.[19] There is 
also some evidence that Thorpe's amateur status had been questioned long 
before the Olympics, but the AAU had ignored the issue until being confronted 
with it in 1913. The only positive element of this affair for Thorpe was 
that, as soon as the news was reported that he had been declared a professional, 
he received offers from professional sports clubs.[33] Because the minor 
league team that last held Jim Thorpe's contract had disbanded in 1910, 
he found himself in the rare position of being a sought after free agent 
at the major league level during the era of the reserve clause, and thus 
had a choice of baseball teams for which to play.[34] In January 1913, 
he turned down a starting position with the American League cellar-dwelling 
St. Louis Browns, choosing instead to join the 1912 National League champion 
New York Giants, who, with Thorpe playing in 19 of their 151 games, would 
repeat as the 1913 National League champions. Immediately following the 
Giants' October loss in the 1913 World Series, Thorpe and the Giants joined 
the Chicago White Sox for a world tour.[35] Barnstorming across the United 
States and then around the world, Thorpe was the celebrity of the tour.[36] 
Thorpe's presence increased the publicity, attendance and gate receipts 
for the tour. He met with Pope Pius X and Abbas II Hilmi Bey (the last 
Khedive of Egypt), and played before 20,000 people in London including 
King George V. While in Rome, he was filmed wrestling with another baseball 
player on the floor of the Colosseum, although no known copy of that film 
has survived. Thorpe signed with the New York Giants baseball club in 1913 
and played sporadically with them as an outfielder for three seasons. After 
playing in the minor leagues with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1916,[37] he 
returned to the Giants in 1917 but was sold to the Cincinnati Reds early 
in the season. In the "double no-hitter" between Fred Toney of the Reds 
and Hippo Vaughn of the Chicago Cubs, Thorpe drove in the winning run in 
the 10th inning.[38] Late in the season, he was sold back to the Giants. 
Again, he played sporadically for them in 1918 before being traded to the 
Boston Braves on May 21, 1919, for Pat Ragan. In his career, he amassed 
91 runs scored, 82 runs batted in and a .252 batting average over 289 games.[39] 
He continued to play minor league baseball until 1922. But Thorpe had not 
abandoned football either. He first played professional football in 1913 
as a member of the Indiana-based Pine Village Pros, a team that had a several-season 
winning streak against local teams during the 1910s.[40] He then signed 
with the Canton Bulldogs in 1915. They paid him $250 ($5,858 today) a game, 
a tremendous wage at the time.[41] Before signing him Canton was averaging 
1,200 fans a game, but 8,000 showed up for his debut against the Massillon 
Tigers.[41] The team won titles in 1916, 1917, and 1919. He reportedly 
ended the 1919 championship game by kicking a wind-assisted 95-yard punt 
from his team's own 5-yard line, effectively putting the game out of reach.[41] 
In 1920, the Bulldogs were one of 14 teams to form the American Professional 
Football Association (APFA), which would become the National Football League 
(NFL) two years later. Thorpe was nominally the APFA's first president, 
but spent most of the year playing for Canton and a year later was replaced 
as president by Joseph Carr.[42] He continued to play for Canton, coaching 
the team as well. Between 1921 and 1923, he helped organize and played 
for the Oorang Indians (LaRue, Ohio), an all-Native American team.[43] 
Although the team's record was 3–6 in 1922,[44] and 1–10 in 1923,[45] he 
played well and was selected for the Green Bay Press-Gazette's first All-NFL 
team in 1923, which would later be formally recognized by the NFL as the 
league's official All-NFL team in 1931).[46] Thorpe never played for an 
NFL championship team. He retired from professional football at age 41,[11] 
having played 52 NFL games for six teams from 1920 to 1928.[47] Until 2005, 
most of Thorpe's biographers were unaware of his basketball career[48] 
until a ticket discovered in an old book that year documented his career 
in basketball. By 1926, he was the main feature of the "World Famous Indians" 
of LaRue which sponsored traveling football, baseball and basketball teams. 
"Jim Thorpe and His World-Famous Indians" barnstormed for at least two 
years (1927–28) in parts of New York and Pennsylvania as well as Marion, 
Ohio. Although pictures of Thorpe in his WFI basketball uniform were printed 
on postcards and published in newspapers, this period of his life was not 
well documented. Thorpe married three times and had eight children (one 
of whom died in childhood). In 1913 Thorpe married Iva M. Miller,[6] whom 
he had met at Carlisle. In 1917 Iva and Thorpe bought a house now known 
as the Jim Thorpe House in Yale, Oklahoma, and lived there until 1923.[49] 
They had four children: Gail Margaret (October 31, 1917 – June 3, 2005), 
James F. (May 8, 1918 – September 28, 1919), Charlotte Marie (September 
16, 1919 – December 8, 1998) and Grace Frances (December 10, 1921 – April 
1, 2008).[6][50] Miller filed for divorce from Thorpe in 1925, claiming 
desertion.[51] In 1926 Thorpe married Freeda Verona Kirkpatrick (September 
19, 1905 – March 2, 2007). She was working for the manager of the baseball 
team for which he was playing at the time.[52] They had four sons: Carl 
Phillip (May 1, 1927 – March 18, 1986), a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army,[53] 
William K., Richard A. and John R. "Jack" (June 29, 1937 – February 22, 
2011).[6][50] Kirkpatrick divorced Thorpe in 1941 after 15 years of marriage. 
Lastly, Thorpe married Patricia Gladys Evelyn "Patsy" Askew (née Woodbury) 
on June 2, 1945; she was with him when he died.[6][50] After his athletic 
career, Thorpe struggled to provide for his family. He found it difficult 
to work a non-sports-related job and never held a job for an extended period 
of time. During the Great Depression in particular, he had various jobs, 
among others as an extra for several movies, usually playing an American 
Indian chief in Westerns. He also worked as a construction worker, a doorman 
(bouncer), a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the 
United States Merchant Marine in 1945.[54][55] Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic 
during his later life.[56] He ran out of money sometime in the early 1950s. 
When hospitalized for lip cancer in 1950, he was admitted as a charity 
case.[57] At a press conference announcing the procedure, his wife, Patricia, 
wept and pleaded for help, saying, "We're broke ... Jim has nothing but 
his name and his memories. He has spent money on his own people and has 
given it away. He has often been exploited."[57] In early 1953, Thorpe 
went into heart failure for the third time while dining with Patricia in 
their home in Lomita, California. He was briefly revived by artificial 
respiration and spoke to those around him, but lost consciousness shortly 
afterward and died on March 28 at the age of 65.[6] Thorpe, whose parents 
were both half Caucasian, was raised as an American Indian. His accomplishments 
occurred during a period of severe racial inequality in the United States. 
It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his 
ethnicity.[58] While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment 
at the time largely reflected this view.[59] At the time Thorpe won his 
gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S. citizens. 
(The U.S. government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American 
ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American 
Indians until 1924.[60] While Thorpe attended Carlisle, students' ethnicity 
was used for marketing purposes.[61] The football team was called the Indians. 
A photograph of Thorpe and the 1911 football team emphasized racial differences 
among the competing athletes; the inscription on the most important game 
ball of that season reads, "1911, Indians 18, Harvard 15."[62] Additionally, 
the school and journalists often categorized sporting competitions as conflicts 
of Indians against whites; newspaper headlines such as "Indians Scalp Army 
27–6" or "Jim Thorpe on Rampage" made stereotypical journalistic play of 
the Indian background of Carlisle's football team.[61] The first notice 
of Thorpe in The New York Times was headlined "Indian Thorpe in Olympiad; 
Redskin from Carlisle Will Strive for Place on American Team."[18] His 
accomplishments were described in a similar racial context by other newspapers 
and sportswriters throughout his life.[63] Over the years, supporters of 
Thorpe attempted to have his Olympic titles reinstated.[64] US Olympic 
officials, including former teammate and later president of the IOC Avery 
Brundage, rebuffed several attempts, with Brundage once saying, "Ignorance 
is no excuse."[65] Most persistent were the author Robert Wheeler and his 
wife, Florence Ridlon. They succeeded in having the AAU and United States 
Olympic Committee overturn its decision and restore Thorpe's amateur status 
before 1913.[66] In 1982, Wheeler and Ridlon established the Jim Thorpe 
Foundation and gained support from the U.S. Congress. Armed with this support 
and evidence from 1912 proving that Thorpe's disqualification had occurred 
after the 30-day time period allowed by Olympics rules, they succeeded 
in making the case to the IOC. In October 1982, the IOC Executive Committee 
approved Thorpe's reinstatement.[30] In an unusual ruling, they declared 
that Thorpe was co-champion with Ferdinand Bie and Wieslander, although 
both of these athletes had always said they considered Thorpe to be the 
only champion. In a ceremony on January 18, 1983, the IOC presented two 
of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, with commemorative medals.[30] Thorpe's 
original medals had been held in museums, but they had been stolen and 
have never been recovered.[67] Although Thorpe is listed as a gold medalist 
by the IOC, his results from 1912 have not been restored to the official 
Olympic records.[68] Thorpe's monument, featuring the quote from Gustav V 
("You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world."), still stands near 
the town named for him, Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.[13] The grave rests on 
mounds of soil from Thorpe's native Oklahoma and from the stadium in which 
he won his Olympic medals.[69] Thorpe's achievements received great acclaim 
from sports journalists, both during his lifetime and since his death. 
In 1950 an Associated Press poll of almost 400 sportswriters and broadcasters 
voted Thorpe the "greatest athlete" of the first half of the 20th century.[70] 
That same year, the Associated Press named Thorpe the "greatest American 
football player" of the first half of the century.[71] In 1999, the Associated 
Press placed him third on its list of the top athletes of the century, 
following Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan.[72] ESPN ranked Thorpe seventh 
on their list of best North American athletes of the century.[73] Thorpe 
was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963, one of seventeen 
players in the charter class.[74] Thorpe is memorialized in the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame rotunda with a larger-than-life statue. He was also inducted 
into halls of fame for college football, American Olympic teams, and the 
national track and field competition.[14] President Richard Nixon, as authorized 
by U.S. Senate Joint Resolution 73, proclaimed Monday, April 16, 1973, 
as "Jim Thorpe Day" to promote the nationwide recognition of Thorpe.[75] 
In 1986, the Jim Thorpe Association established an award with Thorpe's 
name. The Jim Thorpe Award is given annually to the best defensive back 
in college football. The annual Thorpe Cup athletics meeting is named in 
his honor.[76] The United States Postal Service issued a 32¢ stamp on 3 
February 1998 as part of the Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series.[77] 
In 2015 proposed designs for the 2018 Native American dollar coin featuring 
Thorpe were released.[78] After Thorpe's funeral was held at St. Benedict's 
Catholic Church in Shawnee, Oklahoma,[79] his body was lying in state at 
Fairview Cemetery after citizens had paid to have it moved to Shawnee by 
train from California. The people were in a fund raising effort to erect 
a permanent monument and burial place for Thorpe at the town's Athletic 
Park. Local officials had asked the state legislature for funding but were 
turned down so they doubled their efforts to raise the money on their own. 
Meanwhile, Thorpe's third wife, unbeknownst to the rest of his family, 
"stole" Thorpe's body and had it shipped to Pennsylvania[80] when she heard 
that the small Pennsylvania towns of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were 
seeking to attract business. She made a deal with officials which, according 
to Thorpe's son Jack, was done by Patricia for monetary considerations.[81] 
The towns bought Thorpe's remains, erected a monument to him, merged, and 
renamed the newly united town in his honor Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania even 
though Thorpe had never been there.[82] The monument site contains his 
tomb, two statues of him in athletic poses, and historical markers describing 
his life story. The town of Shawnee, disappointed that they were unable 
to honor the man who considered Shawnee his hometown, named their football 
field in his honor. In June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed a federal lawsuit against 
the borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains returned 
to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. 
Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Jack 
was arguing to bring his father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma, 
where they would be buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, 
a mile from the place he was born. He claimed that the agreement between 
his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pa., borough officials was made against 
the wishes of other family members who want him buried in Native American 
land.[83][84] Jack Thorpe died at 73 on February 22, 2011.[85] In April 
2013, U.S. District Judge Richard Caputo ruled that Jim Thorpe borough 
in northeastern Pennsylvania amounts to a museum under the Native American 
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act ("NAGPRA"). A lawyer for Bill and 
Richard Thorpe said the men would pursue the legal process to have their 
father returned to Sac and Fox land in central Oklahoma.[86] On October 
23, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed 
Judge Caputo's ruling. The appeals court held that Jim Thorpe borough is 
not a "museum", as that term is used in NAGPRA, and that the plaintiffs 
therefore could not invoke that federal statute to seek reinterment of 
Thorpe's remains. It directed the trial court to enter a judgment in favor 
of the borough.[87] The appeals court said Pennsylvania law allows the 
plaintiffs to ask a state court to order reburial of Thorpe's remains, 
but noted, "once a body is interred there is great reluctance in permitting 
same to be moved, absent clear and compelling reasons for such a move."[88] 
On October 5, 2015, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the 
matter, effectively bringing the legal process to an end.[89] In the 1930s, 
Thorpe appeared in several short films and features. Usually, his roles 
were cameo appearances as an Indian, although in the 1932 comedy, Always 
Kickin, Thorpe was prominently cast in a speaking part as himself, a kicking 
coach teaching young football players to drop-kick. In 1931, during the 
Great Depression, he sold the film rights to his life story to MGM for 
$1,500 ($23,000 today).[90][91] The movie included archival footage of 
the 1912 and 1932 Olympics, as well as a banquet in which Thorpe was honored. 
Thorpe was seen in some long shots in the film; and one scene showed him 
as a coaching assistant. It was also distributed in the United Kingdom, 
where it was called Man of Bronze. Thorpe had a cameo appearance in the 
1940 film Knute Rockne, All American. Late in the film, he tells Pat O'Brien 
(playing Knute Rockne) at the halftime of a game, "Two minutes, Rock!" 
He is referenced by O'Brien earlier in the film, as a player you could 
build a team around. He played a member of the Navajo band in the 1950 
film Wagon Master. Thorpe was memorialized in the Warner Bros. film Jim 
Thorpe – All-American (1951) starring Burt Lancaster, with Billy Gray performing 
as Thorpe as a child. The film was directed by Michael Curtiz. Although 
there were rumors that Thorpe received no money, he was paid $15,000 by 
Warner Bros. plus a $2,500 donation toward an annuity for him by the studio 
head of publicity.[92] He is mentioned twice in Disney's 1973 film The 
World's Greatest Athlete. Thorpe is featured as a ghost figure in the 1994 
film WindRunner: A Spirited Journey, where he is portrayed by Russell Means.
