Arthur Clyde "Hack" Engle (March 19, 1884 – December 26, 1939) was a utility 
player who played in Major League Baseball between 1909 and 1916. Listed 
at 5' 10", 190 lb., Engle batted and threw right-handed. He was born in 
Dayton, Ohio. Engle was a sort of super-utility man at all positions but 
pitcher and catcher, playing mainly at first base and third. He entered 
the majors in 1909 with the New York Highlanders of the American League, 
playing for them one and a half seasons before joining the Boston Red Sox 
(1910–14). In his rookie year for New York, he hit a .278 batting average 
with a career-highs of 20 doubles and 71 RBI in 135 games. His most productive 
season came with Boston in 1913, when he posted career-numbers in average 
(.289), runs (75), triples (12) and stolen bases (28). He was also a member 
of the Boston Red Sox 1912 World Series champion team which defeated the 
New York Giants in eight games. During the 1914 midseason, Engle joined 
a significant number of players who jumped to the Buffalo teams of the 
outlaw Federal League (1914–15), returning to the American League with 
the Cleveland Indians in 1916, his last major league season. In an eight-season 
career, Engle was a .265 hitter (748-for-2822) with 12 home runs and 318 RBI 
in 836 games, including 373 runs, 101 doubles, 39 triples, 128 stolen bases, 
and a .335 on-base percentage. He made 748 appearances as a fielder at 
first base (255), third base (163), left field (142), center field (111), 
second base (81), right field (25) and shortstop (9). Following his majors 
career, Engle was the athletic director and coached the University of Vermont 
football team, and he later coached the freshman baseball team at Yale 
University, where the coach of the varsity squad was his former teammate 
and close friend Smoky Joe Wood. Engle died in Boston, Massachusetts at 
age 55. Engle will be known forever as the man who hit the ball that Fred 
Snodgrass missed in the eight and final game of the 1912 World Series. 
The Series lasted eight games, due to a 6–6 tie in Game 2 when the game 
was called by darkness after 11 innings. Engle had appeared twice before 
during the Series in pinch-hitting duties. In Game 6, he hit a two-run 
RBI double off Giants pitcher Rube Marquard that scored Boston's only runs 
in a 5–2 losing effort. The decisive Game 8 at Fenway Park faced Joe Wood 
for Boston and Christy Mathewson for the New York Giants, who had broken 
a 1–1 tie by scoring a run in the first half of the 10th inning. The Red 
Sox started its half and manager Jake Stahl sent Engle to pinch-hit for 
pitcher Wood. Then, he hit a fly ball off Mathewson that came toward CF 
Snodgrass, who dropped the ball. Snodgrass made a fine catch on the next 
batter, Harry Hooper, but Mathewson walked Steve Yerkes, gave a single 
to Tris Speaker, and Engle went on to score the tying run. Another walk 
to Duffy Lewis and a sacrifice fly by Larry Gardner scored Yerkes with
