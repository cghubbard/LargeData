Jarry Park (French: Parc Jarry) is an urban park in the Villeray neighbourhood 
of Montreal. From 1969 to 1976, the former Jarry Park Stadium (located 
in the southwest corner of the park, now Uniprix Stadium) was the home 
of the Montreal Expos, Canada's first Major League Baseball team. It also 
hosted a Mass by Pope John Paul II. There is now a hall dedicated to him 
in District Police Station 31 (Villeray). Facilities include softball, 
cricket and soccer fields, a skate park, tennis and basketball courts, 
a public pool and an artificial lake. In addition, there is a monument 
called "Paix des enfants" ("Children's Peace"), consisting of violent toys 
fused together. The park is bordered by Faillon Street to the south, Rue 
Jarry to the north, Boulevard Saint-Laurent to the east, and the Canadian 
Pacific rail tracks to the west. The park was named in honour of Raoul 
Jarry (1885–1930), a member of Montreal's City Council. On 24 June 1965, 
Jarry Park hosted the great show on Saint John Baptiste Day, (La Saint-Jean 
Baptiste), the French-Canadian annual celebration day. Since 1977 it is 
now officially called Quebec's National Holiday,[1] (La fête nationale 
du Québec). That year, Jarry Park was chosen to present the most important 
event of the celebrations. 40,000 people came to hear some of Québec's 
most acclaimed singers; namely Pauline Julien, Clémence Desrochers, Jean-Pierre 
Ferland, Christine Charbonneau, Hervé Brousseau, Les Cailloux, Pierre Calvé,
