The 2009 Minnesota Twins season was the 49th season for the franchise in 
Minnesota, and the 109th overall in the American League. It was their final 
season at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome with their new stadium, Target 
Field, opening in 2010. They ended the regular season as AL Central champions 
after defeating the Detroit Tigers in a one game tie-breaker.[1] They were 
then swept in the American League Division Series by the New York Yankees.[2] 
On April 17, Jason Kubel hit for the cycle, becoming the ninth Twin to 
accomplish the feat. Kubel joins just six other American League cycle-hitters 
that filled the 'HR' slot with a grand slam home run.[3] On May 22, Michael 
Cuddyer hit for the cycle, becoming the tenth Twin to accomplish the feat. 
When he homered twice in the seventh inning on August 23, Cuddy became 
the only man ever in baseball to accomplish both feats in the same season. 
Prior to Kubel last month, the eight previous Twins' cycle hitters were 
Rod Carew, 1970; César Tovar, 1972; Larry Hisle, 1976; Lyman Bostock, 1976; 
Mike Cubbage, 1978; Gary Ward, 1980; Kirby Puckett, 1986 and Carlos Gómez, 
2008. After 319 consecutive games, Justin Morneau sat out June 21. He hadn't 
missed a game since June 27, 2007, until manager Ron Gardenhire held him 
out today. His consecutive-games streak remains the longest for the Twins 
club.[4] At the All-Star Game at Busch Stadium, Joe Mauer was the American 
League's starting catcher, and doubled in three at-bats. Justin Morneau 
and Joe Nathan entered as reserves. Nathan pitched an inning, walked one, 
struck out one and gave up one hit, earning a 'hold'.[5] Joe Mauer won 
his third American League batting title, with a .365 average. In the forty-nine 
seasons the Minnesota Twins have existed, a Twin has won the AL batting 
title fourteen times -- Rod Carew (7), Tony Oliva (3), Joe Mauer (3) and 
Kirby Puckett (1).[6] Closer Joe Nathan saved 47 games to top Eddie Guardado's 
previous club record of 45. He was a co-winner of the Rolaids Relief Man 
Award (with Mariano Rivera), only the second Twin (after Bill Campbell, 
in 1976) to do so. Nathan now leads in Twins career saves with 260. For 
the first time ever, four Twins topped 90 RBI: Jason Kubel (103), Justin 
Morneau (100), Joe Mauer (96) and Michael Cuddyer (94).[7] Along with winning 
the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards, Joe Mauer was named American 
League MVP, the fifth Twin in history to be so honored. Mauer is the first 
AL catcher to lead the league in batting average, slugging percentage and 
on-base percentage. Through October 5, 2009 Infielders Outfielders Coaches 
The Twins ended the 162-game regular season tied with the Detroit Tigers, 
necessitating a one-game playoff. This made the Twins the first major league 
team ever to play in a tie-breaker two years in a row (they lost one to 
the Chicago White Sox in 2008). The game took place on Tuesday, October 
6 at the Metrodome. The Twins won the game, 6-5, in 12 innings on Alexi 
Casilla's game-winning hit scoring Carlos Gómez.[8] The Twins went on to 
face the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series, which 
they lost in three consecutive games. Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats;
