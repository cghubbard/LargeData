A screwball is a baseball and fastpitch softball pitch that is thrown so 
as to break in the opposite direction of a slider or curveball. Depending 
on the pitcher's arm angle, the ball may also have a sinking action. Carl 
Hubbell was one of the most renowned screwball pitchers in the history 
of Major League Baseball.[1] Hubbell was known as the "scroogie king" for 
his mastery of the pitch and the frequency with which he threw it. Other 
famous screwball artists include Tug McGraw and Cy Young Award winners 
Mike Cuellar, Fernando Valenzuela and Mike Marshall. When thrown by a right-handed 
pitcher, a screwball breaks from left to right from the point of view of 
the pitcher; the pitch therefore moves down and in on a right-handed batter 
and down and away from a left-handed batter. When thrown by a left-handed 
pitcher, a screwball breaks from right to left, moving down and in on a 
left-handed batter and down and away from a right-handed batter. Due to 
this left-to-right movement of the ball (when thrown by a right-handed 
pitcher), right-handed pitchers use a screwball against left-handed batters 
in the same way that they use a slider against right-handed batters.[citation

of a curveball. One of the first great screwball pitchers was Christy Mathewson, 
who pitched for the New York Giants 1900â€“1916, whose pitch was then labeled 
as the "fadeaway"; although historians have been unable to prove it, baseball 
legend holds that Giants manager John McGraw arranged for Black pitcher 
Rube Foster to teach Mathewson the screwball, as McGraw was forbidden from 
hiring Foster directly.[2] Major league pitchers who have thrown the screwball 
during their careers include: Contrary to popular belief, the screwball 
is not particularly stressful on a pitcher's arm.[12] The pronation of 
the forearm allows for the protection of the ulnar collateral ligament,
