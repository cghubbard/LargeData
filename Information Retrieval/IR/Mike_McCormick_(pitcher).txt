Michael Francis "Mike" McCormick (born September 29, 1938) is a retired 
American baseball pitcher who played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He played for the New York and San Francisco Giants, Baltimore Orioles, 
Washington Senators, New York Yankees and Kansas City Royals from 1956 
to 1971. He batted and threw left-handed and served primarily as a starting 
pitcher. Signed by the Giants as a bonus baby, McCormick went directly 
to the major leagues and made his debut on September 3, 1956. After spending 
seven seasons with the organization, he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles 
and played two years there before being dealt again, this time to the Washington 
Senators. He returned to the Giants in 1967 and in his first season back 
with the team, he became the first pitcher in Giants' franchise history 
to win the Cy Young Award. In the middle of the 1970 season, he was traded 
to the New York Yankees, who released him before the start of the next 
season. He then signed with the Kansas City Royals, with whom he played 
his last game on May 22, 1971. McCormick was born on September 29, 1938 
in Pasadena, California. He studied at Mark Keppel High School in Alhambra, 
California.[1] During this time, he played in American Legion Baseball, 
where he won 49 out of the 53 games he pitched, threw four no-hitters and 
struck out 26 batters in a game.[2] After he graduated from high school, 
he married Carolyn Koehler on August 2, 1956.[3] Several weeks later, on 
August 31, the New York Giants signed him as an amateur free agent. Although 
McCormick was committed to attending college at the University of Southern 
California,[4] the Giants offered him a signing bonus of $50,000 to forego 
university and join the organization. Because of the Bonus Rule, he could 
not be placed in the minor leagues for two years.[5] As a result, he went 
directly to the major leagues and immediately began training with the first 
team the day after he signed.[2] McCormick made his major league debut 
for the Giants on September 3, 1956, at the age of 17,[1] relieving Rubén 
Gómez in the ninth inning and retiring all three batters he faced in a 
5–1 loss against the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] He made two starts later 
in the season, and finished with a 0–1 win–loss record and a 9.45 earned 
run average (ERA) in just 6 2⁄3 innings pitched.[1] McCormick threw a five-inning 
rain-shortened no-hitter against the Phillies on June 12, 1959, allowing 
one walk.[7] The Phillies were able to secure 1 hit (and 1 run) in the 
bottom of the 6th inning, but the game was called because of the rain.[8] 
Because the 6th inning was never finished, the game statistics reverted 
to the completion of the last full inning, securing his no-hitter.[9] However, 
due to a statistical rule change in 1991, no-hitters must last at least 
nine innings to count. As a result of the retroactive application of the 
new rule, this game and thirty-five others are no longer considered no-hitters. 
At the end of the 1966 season, McCormick returned to the Giants in a trade 
that brought Cap Peterson and Bob Priddy to the Senators.[10] The 1967 
season saw McCormick churn out one of the best statistical years in his 
career. He led the National League (NL) in wins with 22,[1] and defeated 
every NL team other than the Giants that year.[11] At the end of the season, 
McCormick won the Cy Young Award,[12] garnering 90% of the vote and 18 
out of 20 first place votes.[13] In doing so, he became the first Giants 
pitcher to win the award, and was the only one to do so for 41 years until 
Tim Lincecum won it in 2008.[14] McCormick is recognized as the player 
who hit the 500th home run by an MLB pitcher.[15] He was also responsible 
for giving up Hank Aaron's 500th home run.[16] Because of these two feats, 
he personalized his license plate with the words "Mr. 500".[15] After retiring 
from baseball, McCormick went on to pursue a career in securities business 
that he himself established over several MLB offseasons. After three years 
in that field, he switched to office machines and copiers, working for 
Ricoh and then Danka, before retiring in 2002.[5] He serves annually as 
a guest instructor for the San Francisco Giants during spring training.[4] 
He also conducts the team's fantasy camps and occasionally commentates 
on Giants' games.[5] McCormick's Cy Young Award plaque was damaged in the 
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake after it fell off the wall of his Cupertino 
condominium. Although he was initially going to get the crack at the back 
repaired, he decided against it, noting how "it ha[d] more character now."[17] 
He now houses it in a special room along with other memorabilia from his 
career.[18] McCormick had four children from his first marriage.[5] He 
remarried to Dierdre.[19] After retiring from Danka, they moved from Sunnyvale, 
California[2] and settled in Pinehurst, North Carolina.[5] At the O'Neal 
School in Southern Pines, North Carolina, McCormick assisted the school's 
baseball program and donated his baseball memorabilia to the school to
