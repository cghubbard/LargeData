Asbury Park is a city in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States, located 
on the Jersey Shore and part of the New York City Metropolitan Area. As 
of the 2010 United States Census, the city's population was 16,116,[10][11][12] 
reflecting a decline of 814 (−4.8%) from the 16,930 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 131 (+0.8%) from the 16,799 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[21] It was ranked the sixth-best beach in New Jersey 
in the 2008 Top 10 Beaches Contest sponsored by the New Jersey Marine Sciences 
Consortium.[22] Asbury Park was originally incorporated as a borough by 
an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 26, 1874, from portions of 
Ocean Township. The borough was reincorporated on February 28, 1893. Asbury 
Park was incorporated as a city, its current type of government, as of 
March 25, 1897.[23] A seaside community, Asbury Park is located on New 
Jersey's central coast. Developed in 1871 as a residential resort by New 
York brush manufacturer James A. Bradley, the city was named for Francis 
Asbury, the first American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 
the United States.[24][25][26] Bradley was active in the development of 
much of the city's infrastructure, and despite his preference for gas light, 
he allowed the Atlantic Coast Electric Company (precursor to today's Jersey 
Central Power & Light Co.) to offer electric service.[27] Along the waterfront 
Bradley installed the Asbury Park Boardwalk, an orchestra pavilion, public 
changing rooms and a pier at the south end of that boardwalk. Such success 
attracted other businessmen. In 1888, Ernest Schnitzler built the Palace 
Merry-Go-Round on the southwest corner of Lake Avenue and Kingsley Street, 
the cornerstone of what would become the Palace Amusements complex; other 
attractions followed.[28] During these early decades in Asbury Park, a 
number of grand hotels were built, including the Plaza Hotel.[29] Uriah 
White, an Asbury Park pioneer, installed the first artesian well water 
system.[30] As many as 600,000 people a year vacationed in Asbury Park 
during the summer season in the early years, riding the New York and Long 
Branch Railroad from New York City and Philadelphia to enjoy the mile-and-a-quarter 
stretch of oceanfront Asbury Park.[30] By 1912, The New York Times estimated 
that the summer population could reach 200,000.[31] The country by the 
sea destination experienced several key periods of popularity. The first 
notable era was the 1890s, marked by a housing growth, examples of which 
can still be found today in a full range of Victorian architecture. Coinciding 
with the nationwide trend in retail shopping, Asbury Park's downtown flourished 
during this period and well into the 20th century. The 1920s saw a dramatic 
change in the boardwalk with the construction of the Paramount Theatre 
and Convention Hall complex, the Casino Arena and Carousel House, and two 
handsome red-brick pavilions. Beaux Arts architect Warren Whitney of New 
York was the designer. He had also been hired to design the imposing Berkeley-Carteret 
Hotel positioned diagonally across from the theater and hall. At the same 
time, Asbury Park launched a first-class education and athletic program 
with the construction of a state-of-the-art high school overlooking Deal 
Lake. On September 8, 1934, the wreck of the cruise ship SS Morro Castle, 
which caught on fire and burned, beached itself near the city just yards 
away from the Asbury Park Convention Hall; the city capitalized on the 
event, turning the wreck into a tourist attraction.[32] In 1935, the newly 
founded Securities and Exchange Commission called Asbury Park's Mayor Clarence 
F. Hetrick to testify about $6,000,000 in "beach improvement bonds" that 
had gone into default. At the same time, the SEC also inquired about rental 
rates on the beach front and why the mayor reduced the lease of a bathhouse 
from $85,000 to $40,000, among many other discrepancies that could have 
offset debt.[33] The interests of Asbury Park's bond investors lead Senator 
Frank Durand (Monmouth County) to add a last-minute "Beach Commission" 
amendment to a municipal debt bill in the New Jersey legislature. When 
the bill became law, it ceded control of the Asbury Park beach to Governor 
Harold Hoffman and a governor's commission.[34][35] The city of Asbury 
Park sued to restore control of the beach to the municipal council, but 
the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals (until 1947, the state's highest 
court) upheld the validity of the law in 1937.[36] When Durand pressed 
New Jersey's legislature to extend the state's control of Asbury Park's 
beach in 1938, the lower house staged a walk out and the Senate soon adjourned, 
a disruption that also prevented a vote for funding New Jerey's participation 
in the 1939 New York World's Fair.[37][38] In December 1938, the court 
returned control of the beach to the municipal council under the proviso 
that a bond repayment agreement was created; Asbury Park was the only beach 
in New Jersey affected by the Beach Commission law.[39] In 1943, the New 
York Yankees held their spring training in Asbury Park instead of Florida.[40] 
This was because rail transport had to be conserved during the war, and 
Major League Baseball's Spring Training was limited to an area east of 
the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River.[41] With the opening 
of the Garden State Parkway in 1947, Asbury Park saw the travel market 
change as fewer vacationers took trains to the seashore.[citation needed] 
In the decades that followed the war, surrounding farm communities gave 
way to tracts of suburban houses, encouraging the city's middle-class blacks 
as well as whites to move into newer houses with spacious yards.[citation 
needed] With the above-mentioned change in the travel market, prompted 
by the opening of the Garden State Parkway in 1947 and the opening of Monmouth 
Mall 10 miles (16 km) away in Eatontown in 1960, Asbury Park's downtown 
became less of an attraction to shoppers. Office parks built outside the 
city resulted in the relocation of accountants, dentists, doctors, lawyers, 
and other professionals. Moreover, the opening of Six Flags Great Adventure 
(on July 1, 1974), a combination theme park and drive-through safari located 
on a lake in Jackson Township – and close to a New Jersey Turnpike exit 
— proved to be stiff competition for a mile-long stretch of aging boardwalk 
amusements.[citation needed] Riots that broke out in the city on July 4, 
1970, resulted in the destruction of aging buildings along Springwood Avenue, 
one of three main east-west corridors into Asbury Park and the central 
shopping and entertainment district for those living in the city's southwest 
quadrant.[42] Many of those city blocks have yet to be redeveloped into 
the 21st century.[citation needed] Although it was placed on the National 
Register of Historic Places,[43] Palace Amusements was closed in 1988 and 
was demolished in 2004 despite attempts to save it.[44] The complex had 
featured the famous face of Tillie, a symbol of the Jersey Shore.[44] In 
1990, the famous carousel at the Casino Pier was sold to Family Kingdom 
Amusement Park in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where it continues to operate.[45] 
From 2002 onward, the rest of Asbury Park has been in the midst of a cultural, 
political, and economic revival, led by a burgeoning industry of local 
and national artists.[citation needed] Its dilapidated downtown district 
is undergoing revitalization while most of the nearly empty blocks that 
overlook the beach and boardwalk are slated for massive reconstruction. 
In 2005, the Casino's walkway reopened, as did many of the boardwalk pavilions.[46] 
In 2007, the eastern portion of the Casino building was demolished. There 
are plans to rebuild this portion to look much like the original; however, 
the interior will be dramatically different and may include a public market 
(as opposed to previously being an arena and skating rink). There has also 
been more of a resurgence of the downtown as well as the boardwalk, with 
the grand reopening of the historic Steinbach department store building, 
as well as the rehabilitation of Convention Hall and the Fifth Avenue Pavilion 
(previously home to one of the last remaining Howard Johnson's restaurants). 
The historic Berkeley-Carteret Hotel, which is to be restored to four-star 
resort status, was acquired in 2007; the first residents moving into the 
newly constructed condominiums known as North Beach, the rehabilitation 
of Ocean Avenue, and the opening of national businesses on Asbury Avenue. 
After Hurricane Sandy, Asbury Park was one of the few communities on the 
Jersey Shore to reopen successfully for the 2013 summer season. Most of 
the boardwalk had not been badly damaged by the massive hurricane. On Memorial 
Day Weekend 2013, Governor Chris Christie and President Barack Obama participated 
in an official ceremony before a crowd of 4,000, marking the reopening 
of Asbury Park and other parts of the Jersey Shore. The "Stronger Than 
The Storm" motto was emphasized at this ceremony.[47][48] Since the 1950s 
at least, Asbury Park has had a growing gay community. After the property 
values plummeted, gay people from New York City purchased and restored 
Victorian homes, leading to a rejuvenation of parts of the city.[49] In 
1999, Shep Pettibone opened Paradise Nightclub, a gay discotheque near 
the ocean. He has since also opened the Empress Hotel, the state's only 
gay-oriented hotel. Another notable establishment is Georgie's (formerly 
the Fifth Avenue Tavern). Every summer the Jersey Gay Pride parade during 
Sand Blast Weekend draws thousands of gay people to the city. Sand Blast 
Weekend (formerly called Road Trip Weekend) was started by the local gay 
homeowners who wanted to encourage friends from the tri-state area to come 
check out the up & coming beach town and hopefully make it a regular destination 
year-round. In 2010, Road Trip Weekend became Sand Blast Weekend, renamed 
after the popular gay dance on the beach, which had become the main event 
of the Road Trip Weekend. The Asbury Park music scene gained prominence 
in the 1960s with bands such as the Jaywalkers and many others, who combined 
rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and doo-wop to create what became known 
as the Sound of Asbury Park (S.O.A.P.). On December 9, 2006, founding members 
of S.O.A.P. reunited for the "Creators of S.O.A.P.: Live, Raw, and Unplugged" 
concert at The Stone Pony and to witness the dedication of a S.O.A.P. plaque 
on the boardwalk outside of Convention Hall. The original plaque included 
the names Johnny Shaw, Billy Ryan, Bruce Springsteen, Garry Tallent, Steve 
Van Zandt, Mickey Holiday, "Stormin'" Norman Seldin, Vini "Mad Dog" Lopez, 
Fast Eddie "Doc Holiday" Wohanka, Billy "Cherry Bomb" Lucia, Clarence Clemons, 
Nicky Addeo, Donnie Lowell, Jim "Jack Valentine" Cattanach, Ken "Popeye" 
Pentifallo, Jay Pilling, John "Cos" Consoli, Gary "A" Arntz, Larry "The 
Great" Gadsby, Steve "Mole" Wells, Ray Dahrouge, Johnny "A" Arntz, David 
Sancious, Margaret Potter, Tom Potter, Sonny Kenn, Tom Wuorio, Rick DeSarno, 
Southside Johnny Lyon, Leon Trent, Buzzy Lubinsky, Danny Federici, Bill 
Chinnock, Patsy Siciliano, and Sam Siciliano. An additional plaque was 
added on August 29, 2008 honoring John Luraschi, Carl "Tinker" West, George 
Theiss, Vinnie Roslin, Mike Totaro, Lenny Welch, Steve Lusardi, and Johnny 
Petillo.[50] Musicians and bands with strong ties to Asbury Park, many 
of whom frequently played clubs there on their way to fame, include Fury 
of Five, The Gaslight Anthem, Clarence Clemons, the E Street Band, Jon 
Bon Jovi and Bon Jovi, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, Patti Smith, 
Arthur Pryor, Count Basie, The Clash, U.S. Chaos, Johnny Thunders, The 
Ramones, The Exploited, Charged GBH, Marty Munsch, Gary U.S. Bonds, along 
with many more. Asbury Park is considered a destination for musicians, 
particularly a subgenre of rock and roll known as the Jersey Shore sound, 
which is infused with Rhythm and Blues. It is home to The Stone Pony, founded 
in 1974, a starting point for many performers. Smaller venues are Asbury 
Lanes and The Saint, which bring original, live music to the Jersey Shore. 
Asbury Park Convention Hall holds larger events. In 1973 Bruce Springsteen 
released his debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. On his follow-up 
album, The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, one of the songs 
is entitled "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)". Several books chronicle 
the early years of Springsteen's career in Asbury Park. Daniel Wolff's 
4 July Asbury Park examines the social, political and cultural history 
of the city with a special emphasis on the part that music played in the 
city's development, culminating in Springsteen. Beyond the Palace by Gary 
Wien is a comprehensive look at the local music scene that Springsteen 
emerged from, and includes many photographs of musicians and clubs. Against 
the backdrop of the fading resort, Alex Austin's novel The Red Album of 
Asbury Park tracks a young rock musician pursuing his dream in the late 
60s/early 70s, with Springsteen as a potent but as yet unknown rival.[51] 
A B&W multi-camera recording of Blondie in 1979, just prior to the release 
of their fourth album, Eat to the Beat, was taped at the Asbury Park Convention 
Hall on July 7, a home-state crowd for Jersey girl Debbie Harry, who was 
raised in Hawthorne.[52] The Golden T-Bird Awards were established in 1993 
by Scott Stamper and Pete Mantas to recognize and support significant contributions 
and achievements of local and regional participants in the music industry. 
The name of the awards was changed to the Asbury Music Awards in 1995. 
The award ceremony is held in November of each year, most recently at the 
Stone Pony.[53] The New Jersey Music Hall of Fame was founded in Asbury 
Park in 2005. There are plans to build a museum somewhere in the city as 
part of the redevelopment.[54] The Wave Gathering Music Festival was established 
in 2006. The festival is held during the summer. Businesses across Asbury 
Park offer food, drink, art, music, crafts, and their stages for performances. 
Stages are also set up in parks, on the boardwalk, and in other open spaces. 
The event takes place over several days.[55] In 2003, actor Robert Pastorelli 
founded the Garden State Film Festival, which draws over 30,000 visitors 
to Absury Park each spring for a four-day event including screenings of 
150 features, documentaries, shorts and videos, concerts, lectures and 
workshops for filmmakers. In 2012, a film industry exposition will be held 
for the first time in Convention Hall during the Festival.[56] The Bamboozle 
Music Festival was held in Asbury Park in 2003, 2004, and 2005.[57] The 
festival returned to its original location for the ten-year anniversary 
in 2012, headlined by My Chemical Romance, Foo Fighters, and Bon Jovi, 
drawing over 90,000 people to the city over the three-day span in which 
it was held.[58] On October 5, 2013, the largest gathering of zombies was 
achieved by the 9,592 participants in New Jersey Zombie Walk at the Asbury 
Park Boardwalk.[59] Asbury Park's nightlife includes The Stone Pony. On 
Main Street is The Saint, (formerly the Clover Club), a club that showcases 
local and emerging acts, as well as established performers. Across town, 
on Fourth Avenue, is Asbury Lanes, a no longer functioning vintage bowling 
alley and bar with live performances ranging from musical acts, neo-Burlesque, 
hot rod, and art shows. Though it has been closed for now, it is currently 
being restored to its former glory. Bought by the newly opened Asbury Hotel 
sitting adjacent on Fifth Avenue, it will be connected with the hotel. 
An above ground passageway has already been built to connect the two buildings. 
An educated guess to its reopening would be Spring 2017. The Baronet, a 
vintage movie theater which dates back to Buster Keaton's era, was near 
Asbury Lanes, but its roof recently caved in and the building was demolished. 
The Asbury Hotel pays homage to this once great theater with its 5th floor 
rooftop movie theater called "The Baronet". The Asbury Hotel also has an 
8th floor rooftop bar, paying homage to the former building inhabitants 
and calling it "Salvation". In a town that was once nearly abandoned, there 
are now over 60 restaurants, bars, coffee houses, and live music venues 
situated in Asbury Park's boardwalk and downtown districts. Popular with 
numerous Asbury Park residents and visitors is the monthly First Saturday 
event. On the first Saturday of every month, Asbury Park's downtown art 
galleries, home design studios, restaurants, antique shops, and clothing 
boutiques remain open throughout the evening, serving hors d'oeuvres and 
offering entertainment, to showcase the city's residential and commercial 
resurgence.[60] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city 
had a total area of 1.603 square miles (4.151 km2), including 1.424 square 
miles (3.687 km2) of land and 0.179 square miles (0.464 km2) of water (11.17%).[1][2] 
Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the city include North Asbury and Whitesville (located 
along the city's border with Neptune Township).[61] The city borders the 
Monmouth County communities of Interlaken, Loch Arbour, Neptune Township 
and Ocean Township[62] Deal Lake covers 158 acres (64 ha) and is overseen 
by the Deal Lake Commission, which was established in 1974. Seven municipalities 
border the lake, accounting for 27 miles (43 km) of shoreline, also including 
Allenhurst, Deal, Interlaken, Loch Arbour, Neptune Township and Ocean Township.[63] 
At the 2010 United States Census, there were 16,116 people, 6,725 households, 
and 3,174 families residing in the city. The population density was 11,319.5 
per square mile (4,370.5/km2). There were 8,076 housing units at an average

dollars) median household income was $33,527 (with a margin of error of 
+/− $2,802) and the median family income was $27,907 (+/− $5,012). Males 
had a median income of $34,735 (+/− $3,323) versus $33,988 (+/− $4,355) 
for females. The per capita income for the borough was $20,368 (+/− $1,878). 
About 31.1% of families and 29.4% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 44.9% of those under age 18 and 26.0% of those age 65 or 
over.[71] As of the 2000 United States Census[18] there were 16,930 people, 
6,754 households, and 3,586 families residing in the city. The population 
density was 14,290.0 per square mile (5,629.4/km2) making it Monmouth County's 
most densely populated municipality. There were 7,744 housing units at 
an average density of 5,416.7 per square mile (2,090.9/km2). The racial 
makeup of the city was 15.77% White, 67.11% Black, 0.32% Native American,

population were below the poverty line, including 46.5% of those under 
age 18 and 37.1% of those age 65 or over.[69][70] Portions of Asbury Park 
are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. In addition to other benefits to 
encourage employment within the Zone, some stores are allowed to apply 
a reduced 3½% sales tax rate at eligible merchants (versus the 7% rate 
charged statewide).[72] The award-winning weekly newspaper The Coaster 
has covered local news in Asbury Park since it was founded in 1983. The 
owner of TriCity News, a weekly news and art publication for Monmouth County, 
chose Asbury Park for its headquarters.[73] There were at one time many 
hotels along the beachfront. Many were demolished after years of sitting 
vacant, although the Sixth Avenue House Bed & Breakfast Hotel (formerly 
Berea Manor) was recently restored after being abandoned in the 1970s. 
Hotels like the Berkeley and Oceanic Inn have operated concurrently for 
decades, while the Empress Hotel and Hotel Tides were recently restored 
and reopened. The Asbury Hotel, located on 5th Avenue, is the first hotel 
to be "built" in Asbury Park in 50+ years. It stands where the old Salvation 
Army building once stood, which has sat vacant for over a decade. The building 
itself was not torn down, but the entire inside was gutted and redone. 
Glass paneling was added to the front and all the original outside brickwork 
was kept. While located a block and a half from the beach, a great view 
of the ocean is still offered by the upper floors and rooftop. Currently 
open hotels include the Berkeley Oceanfront Hotel (formerly the Berkeley-Carteret 
Oceanfront Hotel), The Empress Hotel, Hotel Tides, Asbury Park Inn, Oceanic 
Inn, Sixth Avenue House Bed & Breakfast Hotel, Mikell's Big House Bed & 
Breakfast and The Asbury Hotel. Demolished: In 1943, the New York Yankees 
held spring training in Asbury Park to comply with restrictions on rail 
travel during World War II.[76] The City of Asbury Park is governed within 
the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, 
under the Council-Manager form of government. The city was previously governed 
under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law form of New Jersey municipal government 
until voters approved the Council-Manager form in 2013.[77] The government 
consists of a five-member City Council with a directly elected mayor and 
four council positions all elected at-large in non-partisan elections, 
to serve four-year terms of office on a staggered basis in elections held 
in even years as part of the November general election.[4][77] The form 
of government was chosen based on the final report issued in August 2013 
by a Charter Study Commission that had narrowed its options to the weak 
Mayor Council-Manager form or the strong Mayor Faulkner Act form, ultimately 
choosing to recommend the Council-Manager form as it would retain desired 
aspects of the 1923 Municipal Manager Law (non-partisan voting for an at-large 
council with a professional manager) while allowing a directly elected 
mayor, elections in November and grants voters the right to use initiative 
and referendum.[78] The four winning council candidates in the November 
2014 general election drew straws, with two being chosen to serve full 
four-year terms and two serving for two years. Thereafter, two council 
seats will be up for election every two years.[79] As of 2016[update], 
members of the Asbury Park City Council are Mayor John Moor (term ends 
December 31, 2018), Deputy Mayor Amy Quinn (2016), Eileen Chapman (2016; 
appointed to serve an unexpired term), Barbara "Yvonne" Clayton (2016) 
and Jesse Kendle (2018).[3][4][80][81][82] In May 2016, the City Council 
appointed Eileen Chapman to fill the vacant council seat expiring in December 
2016 that had been held by Joe Woerner until he resigned from office.[83] 
Myra Campbell, the last mayor under the old form of government, was the 
first African-American woman to be chosen as mayor when she took office 
in July 2013.[84] The Asbury Park Fire Department is the only fully career 
department in Monmouth County.[85] Asbury Park's fire station includes 
one staffed Engine Company, one staffed Truck Company, two staffed Basic 
Life Support Ambulances and a Duty Battalion Chief, operating four engines, 
two ladder trucks, a Technical Rescue Response Vehicle. The department 
has 50 employees, which includes 49 who are cross-trained as Emergency 
Medical Technicians.[86] Asbury Park is located in the 6th Congressional 
district[87] and is part of New Jersey's 11th state legislative district.[11][88][89] 
New Jersey's Sixth Congressional District is represented by Frank Pallone 
(D, Long Branch).[90] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate 
by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[91] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 
2019).[92][93] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 
11th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented 
in the State Senate by Jennifer Beck (R, Red Bank) and in the General Assembly 
by Joann Downey (D, Freehold Township) and Eric Houghtaling (D, Neptune 
Township).[94] The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham 
Township).[95] The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, 
Monmouth Beach).[96] Monmouth County is governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders 
consisting of five members who are elected at-large to serve three year 
terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats up for 
election each year as part of the November general election. At an annual 
reorganization meeting held in the beginning of January, the board selects 
one of its members to serve as Director and another as Deputy Director.[97] 
As of 2014[update], Monmouth County's Freeholders are Freeholder Director 
Lillian G. Burry (R, Colts Neck Township; term ends December 31, 2014),[98] 
Freeholder Deputy Director Gary J. Rich, Sr. (R, Spring Lake; 2014),[99] 
Thomas A. Arnone (R, Neptune City; 2016),[100] John P. Curley (R, Middletown 
Township; 2015)[101] and Serena DiMaso (R, Holmdel Township; 2016).[102][103] 
Constitutional officers elected on a countywide basis are County Clerk 
M. Claire French (Wall Township),[104] Sheriff Shaun Golden (Farmingdale)[105] 
and Surrogate Rosemarie D. Peters (Middletown Township).[106] As of March 
23, 2011, there were a total of 7,404 registered voters in Asbury Park, 
of which 2,723 (36.8%) were registered as Democrats, 464 (6.3%) were registered 
as Republicans and 4,209 (56.8%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There

Park Public Schools. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts 
statewide,[115] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the 
requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation 
projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools 
Development Authority.[116][117] Students from Allenhurst attend the district's 
schools as part of a sending/receiving relationship.[118] In July 2014, 
the New Jersey Department of Education approved a request by Interlaken 
under which it would end its sending relationship with the Asbury Park 
district and begin sending its students to the West Long Branch Public 
Schools through eighth grade and then onto Shore Regional High School.[119] 
As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's five schools had an enrollment 
of 1,998 students and 234.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a 
student–teacher ratio of 8.52:1.[120] Schools in the district (with 2011-12 
enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics[121]) 
are:[122] Bradley Elementary School[123] (PreK-5; 505), Thurgood Marshall 
Elementary School[124] (PreK-5; 527), Asbury Park Middle School[125] (527) 
and Asbury Park High School[126] (406) In March 2011, the state monitor 
overseeing the district's finances ordered that Barack Obama Elementary 
School be closed after the end of the 2010–11 school year, citing a 35% 
decline in enrollment in the district during the prior 10 years. Students 
currently attending the school would be reallocated to the district's two 
other elementary schools, with those going into fifth grade assigned to 
attend middle school.[127] During the summer of 2012, the school board 
approved funding for development plans to house the Board of Education 
in the vacant Barack Obama Elementary School. The school board awarded 
$894,000 to an architect firm to handle the renovation design and subsequent 
project bids. The estimated cost of the renovation was $1.6 million.[128] 
In 2006, Asbury Park's Board of Education was affected by the city's decision 
to redevelop waterfront property with eminent domain. In the case Asbury 
Park Board of Education v. City of Asbury Park and Asbury Partners, LLC, 
the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division affirmed a ruling in 
favor of eminent domain of the Board of Education building on Lake Avenue.[129] 
The Board of Education moved to the third and fourth floors of 603 Mattison 
Avenue, the former Asbury Park Press building, where it paid $189,327 in 
rent per year.[128] In February 2007, the offices of the Asbury Park Board 
of Education were raided by investigators from the State Attorney General's 
office, prompted by allegations of corruption and misuse of funds.[130] 
Per-student expenditures in Asbury Park have generated statewide controversy 
for several years. In 2006, The New York Times reported that Asbury Park 
"spends more than $18,000 per student each year, the highest amount in 
the state."[131] In both 2010 and 2011, the Asbury Park K-12 school district 
had the highest per-student expenditure in the state.[132] As of the 2010 
school reports, the high school has not met goals mandated by the No Child 
Left Behind Act and has been classified as "In Need of Improvement" for 
six years.[133] The Hope Academy Charter School, founded in 2001, is an 
alternative public school choice that serves students in Kindergarten through 
eighth grade. Admission is based on a lottery of submitted applications, 
with priority given to Asbury Park residents and siblings of existing students.[134] 
Students from Asbury Park in ninth through twelfth grades may also attend 
Academy Charter High School, located in Lake Como, which also serves residents 
of Allenhurst, Avon-by-the-Sea, Belmar, Bradley Beach, Deal, Interlaken 
and Lake Como, and accepts students on a lottery basis.[135] While 8 of 
the 17 murders in Monmouth County in 2006 took place in Asbury Park, and 
7 of the county's 14 murders in 2007, by 2008 there was only one murder 
in Asbury Park and five in the whole county. The city's police had added 
19 officers since 2003 and expanded its street crime unit. After a spike 
in gang violence, violent crime had decreased by almost 20% from 2006 to 
2008.[136] In the calendar year through August 26, 2013, Asbury Park has 
had 6 homicides; there have also been 17 people non-fatally injured in 
shooting incidents.[137] In February 2014, "Operation Dead End" arrested 
gang members of the Crips and Bloods; one Asbury Park patrol officer was 
arrested for aiding gang members.[138] On June 16, 2015, Asbury Park police 
officers arrested a Neptune Township off-duty police officer for the murder 
of his ex-wife on an Asbury Park street in broad daylight.[139] As of 2013, 
the Asbury Park Police Department has 88 police employees: 74 men, 10 women, 
and 4 civilian.[151] Nearby hospitals include Jersey Shore University Medical 
Center and Monmouth Medical Center. In 2014, there were 906 reported cases 
of HIV in Asbury Park. Additionally, there were 407 AIDS-related deaths 
and 70 deaths of people who had HIV (without AIDS diagnosis.)[152] To help 
people living with AIDS and their caregivers, a not-for-profit foundation 
called The Center provides assistance with meals, housing, and transportation.[153] 
In 2012, Asbury Park reported 6 cases of syphilis, 59 cases of gonorrhea, 
and 139 cases of chlamydia.[154] As of May 2010[update], the city had a

were maintained by the municipality, 0.92 miles (1.48 km) by Monmouth County 
and 1.50 miles (2.41 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.[155] 
The main access road is Route 71 which runs north-south. Other roads that

Asbury Park station.[156] on the North Jersey Coast Line, offering service 
to Newark Penn Station, Secaucus Junction, New York Penn Station and Hoboken 
Terminal.[157] Bus routes include the 317 to and from Philadelphia, and 
local service on the 830, 832, 836 and 837 routes.[158] People who were 
born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Asbury Park 
include: Palace Amusements and the Tillie mural have featured in numerous 
works of popular culture. Additional works reference Asbury Park, specifically. 
For example, in the song "At Long Last Love" (1938), originally written 
by Cole Porter for the musical You Never Know (1938), Frank Sinatra sings 
"Is it Granada I see, or only Asbury Park?"[185] Bruce Springsteen named 
his first album "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J." in 1973 and described 
his early life there. The artist has also dedicated many songs to Asbury 
Park such as "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)" and "My City of Ruins" 
on his 2002 album, "The Rising". The group mewithoutYou references Asbury 
Park several times on their album Ten Stories (2012). The song "Bear's 
Vision of St. Agnes" mentions "that tattered rag shop back in Asbury Park", 
and the song "Fox's Dream of the Log Flume" mentions the pier and sand 
dunes.[citation needed] Asbury Park was used for the location filming of 
the crime drama City by the Sea (2002), starring Robert De Niro, James 
Franco and Frances McDormand, which was nominally set in Long Beach, New 
York, where no filming actually took place, according to a disclaimer that 
was included as part of the closing credits. The film features scenes set 
on a shabby, dilapidated boardwalk and in a ruined/abandoned casino/arcade 
building. Residents of both places objected to the way their cities were 
depicted.[186] Asbury Park appears at the start of the 1999 film Dogma. 
The Sopranos' Season 2 finale "Funhouse", originally aired in April 2000, 
includes several discrete dream sequences dreamed by Tony that take place 
on the Asbury Park Boardwalk, including Madame Marie's as well as Tony 
and Pauly playing cards at a table in the empty hall of the Convention 
Center. The episode's title alludes to the Palace, which is also shown.[187] 
In a 1955 episode of The Honeymooners (Better Living Though TV), Alice 
Kramden ridicules husband Ralph Kramden's seemingly never-ending parade 
of failed get-rich-quick schemes, including his investment in "the uranium
