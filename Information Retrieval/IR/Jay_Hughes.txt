James Jay Hughes (January 22, 1874 â€“ June 2, 1924) was an American Major 
League Baseball pitcher, who played four seasons from 1898 to 1902. Hughes 
was born in Sacramento, California. He attracted attention in 1897 when 
he threw a three hit shutout during a west coast exhibition game against 
the famed Baltimore Orioles, a team featuring such notable baseball stars 
as Wilbert Robinson, John McGraw, Hughie Jennings, Willie Keeler, and Joe 
Kelley. Orioles Manager Ned Hanlon hired him and brought him east, where 
he had four excellent seasons, including a league-leading 28-6 mark with 
the 1899 Brooklyn Superbas. He pitched a no-hitter on April 22, 1898 (another 
no-hitter, by Cincinnati's Ted Breitenstein, was thrown the same day, marking 
the first time that two no-hitters were thrown on the same day). Hughes 
was transferred to the Brooklyn Superbas in 1899; the Orioles and Superbas 
were both owned by the same group of individuals. Jennings, Keeler, and 
several other key Orioles were transferred, including manager Ned Hanlon, 
who had an ownership stake. The owners wanted to transfer McGraw and Robinson 
as well, but they refused to leave due to their business interests and 
family in Baltimore. Preferring to play on the west coast, he joined the 
Pacific Coast League in 1903. As a Sacramento native, he hated pitching 
in the East, and on several occasions refused to sign contracts with eastern 
clubs so he could remain on the west coast. In 1903, playing for the Seattle 
Rainiers, he tied Doc Newton for the lead in wins with 34, including 12 
in a row from September 8 through November 4. He pitched there until a 
back injury ended his career. He died when he fell from a train in Sacramento, 
fracturing his skull. He was laid to rest at St. Joseph Cemetery in Sacramento. 
His older brother, Mickey Hughes, won 25 games for the 1888 Brooklyn Bridegrooms.
