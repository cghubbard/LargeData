The New York Mets are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in 
Queens, in New York City, New York. They play in the National League East 
division. In the team's 52-year history, the Mets have employed 20 managers.[1] 
The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on 
and off the field.[2] Of those managers, only Joe Torre was a player-manager 
(a manager who also plays for the team);[1][3] Yogi Berra did, however, 
play four games while he was a coach in 1965.[4] The Mets posted their 
franchise record for losses in their inaugural season in the league, with 
120 losses in 160 games in 1962.[5] This was the first of seven consecutive 
losing seasons,[1] a season in which the winning percentage was below .500, 
and the most losses by a post-1900 MLB team.[6] During this stretch from 
1962 to 1968, the Mets employed four managers.[1] Five managers have taken 
the Mets to the postseason; Davey Johnson and Bobby Valentine have led 
the team to two playoff appearances each. Johnson and Gil Hodges are the 
only Mets managers to win a World Series: Hodges in 1969 against the Baltimore 
Orioles; and Johnson in 1986 against the Boston Red Sox.[7] Johnson is 
the longest-tenured manager in franchise history, with 1,012 games of service 
over 7 seasons (1984–1989 and part of 1990).[1] The manager with the most 
wins and highest winning percentage over a full season or more is Johnson; 
his 595–417 record gives him a .588 winning percentage.[1] Conversely, 
the worst winning percentage over a full season or more in franchise history 
is .302 by inaugural manager Casey Stengel, who posted a 175–404 record
