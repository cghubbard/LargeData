The Lone Star League was the name of three American minor professional 
baseball leagues located in the state of Texas during the 20th century. 
The leagues operated from 1927–1929 (as a Class D circuit), 1947–1948 (Class 
C) and 1977 (Class A). Each of the three leagues was the result of a reorganization 
of a previous circuit. The Lone Star League of the 1920s was created by 
merging two Class D loops, the East Texas League and the Texas Association; 
it disbanded on May 16, 1929. The eight-member postwar Lone Star circuit 
of 1947–1948 was formed from a foundation of four teams that had played 
in the Class C East Texas League of 1946. After the demise of the LSL, 
the East Texas League was revived for the 1949–1950 seasons. The 1977 Lone 
Star League was the successor of the failed Gulf States League of 1976, 
inheriting Texas-based GSL franchises in Beeville, Corpus Christi, Harlingen 
and Victoria. Like the GSL, it was an official Class A minor league, not 
an "independent league," although its six teams were not affiliated with 
Major League Baseball farm systems. The 1977 Lone Star League played an 
80-game regular season schedule from June 10 to the end of August. The 
defending Gulf States League champion Corpus Christi Seagulls, managed 
by future Major League pitching coach Leo Mazzone, dominated the Lone Star 
League, winning 53 of its 80 games and the South Division title. No championship
