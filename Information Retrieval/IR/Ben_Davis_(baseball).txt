Mark Christopher "Ben" Davis (born March 10, 1977 in Chester, Pennsylvania) 
is a former Major League Baseball player. Davis began his career as a promising 
catcher, and spent seven seasons between 1998 and 2004 with San Diego Padres, 
Seattle Mariners and the Chicago White Sox at the Major League level. 2001 
was the only season in which he was a regular, playing in more than half 
his team's games. He was nicknamed Big Ben during his time in Seattle because 
of his tall stature (6'4"). After several seasons in the Minor Leagues, 
Davis converted to a pitcher in 2008,[1] pitching parts of three seasons 
before retiring in 2011. He currently works as a broadcast commentator 
for the Philadelphia Phillies and lives with his wife, two sons, and two 
daughters in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Davis graduated in 1995 from Malvern 
Preparatory School in Malvern, Pennsylvania. He batted .514, going 36 for 
70 with six home runs and 37 RBIs as a senior. He ranked as the second-best 
prospect by Baseball America in the 1995 draft. He was also tabbed by the 
same publication as being the Best Defensive Catcher and the high school 
player closest to the majors. While at Malvern Prep, Davis also played 
on the basketball team where he competed against fellow Main Line prodigy 
Kobe Bryant of Lower Merion High School.[2] He was a first-round pick, 
second overall, in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft by the San Diego 
Padres out of Malvern Preparatory School. USA Today called him the best 
high school catcher since Dale Murphy in 1974.[3] Davis was named to the 
Pioneer League All-Star team in his first professional season with the 
Advanced-Rookie Idaho Falls Braves in 1995. In 1996 he was limited to designated 
hitter duties for the first month of the season with Rancho Cucamonga Quakes 
due to a sore right elbow. He threw out 25 of 98 attempted base-stealers. 
He also spent the 1997 season at Rancho Cucamonga throwing out 59 of 159 
attempted base-stealers. His contract was purchased from the Double-A Mobile 
BayBears on September 19, 1998. He made his Major League debut with the 
Padres as a defensive replacement on September 25 against the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
He reached on an error in his first and only at-bat of the season. Davis 
was named to the Southern League All-Star team in his first season with 
Mobile. He threw out 47 of 83 attempted base-stealers. He spent the majority 
of the 1999 season with the Padres. He started 71 of 93 games for San Diego 
after being recalled on June 23. He collected his first major league hit 
on June 26 against the Colorado Rockies, a single off Mark Brownson. Davis 
posted first career four-hit game on September 15 against the Atlanta Braves, 
including a solo home run off John Smoltz. Davis split the 2000 season 
between the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s and San Diego. He began the season with 
the Padres, appearing in seven games before being optioned to Las Vegas 
on April 20. He was recalled on July 8. He was placed on the disabled list 
in August with a strained left oblique. Davis was the subject of controversy 
in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 26, 2001, as a member 
of the San Diego Padres. Starting pitcher Curt Schilling took a perfect 
game into the eighth inning with one out when Davis reached base safely 
on a drag bunt to second baseman Jay Bell. After Davis reached base, many 
of the Diamondbacks' players shouted obscenities at him for supposedly 
breaking baseball's "unwritten rule". After the game, Diamondbacks manager 
Bob Brenly called Davis's play "chicken." [4] Many analysts continually 
debate Davis's decision to bunt for a base hit as the Diamondbacks were 
only up 2-0, which brought the tying run to the plate. San Diego's Alex 
Arias led off the ninth with a clean double. Schilling completed the three-hitter 
for the Diamondbacks' 3-1 win. This game started a fierce rivalry between 
the teams, which included several bench-clearing brawls, that lasted for 
several years, but which has since dissipated. In 2001 Davis was traded 
with Wascar Serrano and Alex Arias to the Seattle Mariners in exchange 
for Brett Tomko, Tom Lampkin, and Ramón Vázquez. This trade, in large, 
disappointed the Padres organization because of their continuing failures 
to produce "home-grown" talent. Davis was a highly regarded top prospect.[5] 
Davis had a .998 fielding percentage in 77 games behind the plate and threw 
out 44 percent of would be base stealers in 2002. He batted .300 with runners 
in scoring position, and was 6-for-11 with two home runs with the bases 
loaded. He also hit .294 with six home runs on the road as opposed to .216 
with one home run at home. He batted .294 in the second half of the season, 
raising his average from .216 at the break to .259 at the end of the season. 
All seven of Davis' home runs came from the left side of the plate. He 
hit his first American League home run and first homer of the season May 
4 against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. He had nine-game hitting 
streak from May 17 to June 6, going 13-for-29 during that span. He hit 
first triple of season on August 4 against the Cleveland Indians. He spent 
the second season with the Mariners splitting backstop duties with Dan 
Wilson in 2003. Davis appeared in 80 games, hitting .236 with six home 
runs and 42 RBIs. He hit a go-ahead home run off Ricardo Rincón to lead 
off the 11th inning April 3 against the Oakland Athletics. He also tied 
a club record with three doubles on June 21 against his former team, the 
Padres. On June 27, 2004, Davis was once again traded, this time from the 
Mariners to the Chicago White Sox with Freddy García in exchange for catcher 
Miguel Olivo, Mike Morse and Jeremy Reed. Davis appeared in just ten games 
with the Triple-A Charlotte Knights before being placed on the disabled 
list with a fractured finger on his right hand. He also fought through 
a right elbow injury and missed the remainder of the season after undergoing 
Tommy John surgery. He batted .242 with one home run and three RBIs before 
the injury. He was released after the season. For the 2006 season, after 
signing with the New York Yankees, Davis played for the Columbus Clippers, 
the Triple-A affiliate of the Yankees and the Class-A Advanced Tampa Yankees 
He went 3-for-16 with a double, home run and two RBIs for Tampa. He played 
in 48 games with Columbus and hit .222 with six doubles, four home runs 
and 20 RBIs. On January 12, 2007, he re-signed and was invited to spring 
training by the Yankees. Davis was released by the Yankees April 1, 2007. 
In May 2007, he joined the independent Camden Riversharks and played well 
enough that he was signed to a minor league contract by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in June. He was the assigned to Triple-A Las Vegas, the team he 
had played for when they were San Diego's affiliate. Davis hit .331 with 
six doubles, three triples, three home runs and 19 RBIs in 36 games with 
Camden and played in 36 games with Las Vegas and hit .218 with four doubles, 
a home run and 11 RBIs. In January 2008, Davis was signed by the Baltimore 
Orioles to a minor league contract, with an invitation to spring training. 
Davis did not make the team coming out of spring training and was assigned 
to the Double-A Bowie Baysox. Davis received a mid-season promotion to 
the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. In 24 games with Bowie hit .227 with six doubles, 
a triple, two home runs and 13 RBIs, with Norfolk Davis hit .172 with two 
doubles, a home run and two RBIs in 20 games. He was released on June 14. 
After his release, he again signed with the River Sharks and attempted 
to make a comeback to Major League Baseball as a pitcher. In November 2008, 
Davis signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds as a pitcher. 
He made his pitching debut on April 23 against the Charlotte Stone Crabs 
tossing a scoreless inning with no hits and one strikeout. Davis injured 
himself on May 17 and did not return that season. At the end of the 2009 
season he was 0-1 with a 3.09 ERA with four saves in nine games. Davis 
pitched for the Camden Riversharks for 2010. He announced his retirement 
from professional baseball on April 16, 2011.[6] Shortly thereafter, Davis 
began working for CSN Philadelphia, where he is an analyst for the Phillies 
Focus show, as well as Phillies Post Game.[7] For the 2015 season, he joined 
the Phillies' broadcast team as an in-game analyst alongside Tom McCarthy, 
Matt Stairs, Mike Schmidt, and Gregg Murphy.[8] Davis has also made regular 
appearances on 94 WIP Sports Radio as a co-host in various time slots.
