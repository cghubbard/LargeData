Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease 
and motor neurone disease (MND), is a specific disease that causes the 
death of neurons which control voluntary muscles.[1][2][3] Some also use 
the term "motor neuron disease" for a group of conditions of which ALS 
is the most common.[4] ALS is characterized by stiff muscles, muscle twitching, 
and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size.[4] 
This results in difficulty in speaking, swallowing, and eventually breathing.[2][4] 
The cause is not known in 90% to 95% of cases.[1] About 5–10% of cases 
are inherited from a person's parents.[5] About half of these genetic cases 
are due to one of two specific genes. The diagnosis is based on a person's 
signs and symptoms with testing done to rule out other potential causes.[1] 
No cure for ALS is known.[1] A medication called riluzole may extend life 
by about two to three months.[6] Non-invasive ventilation may result in 
both improved quality and length of life.[7] The disease usually starts 
around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50.[5] The 
average survival from onset to death is two to four years.[8] About 10% 
survive longer than 10 years.[1] Most die from respiratory failure. In 
much of the world, rates of ALS are unknown.[5] In Europe and the United 
States the disease affects about two people per 100,000 per year.[5][9] 
Descriptions of the disease date back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[10] 
In 1869, the connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological 
problems was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot, who in 1874 began 
using the term amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[10] It became well known 
in the United States in the 20th century when in 1939 it affected the baseball 
player Lou Gehrig and later worldwide when physicist Stephen Hawking, diagnosed 
in 1963 and expected to die within two years, became famous.[11][12] In 
2014 videos of the ice bucket challenge went viral on the Internet and 
increased public awareness.[13] ALS is a motor neuron disease, also spelled 
"motor neurone disease" which is a group of neurological disorders that 
selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles 
of the body, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral 
sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, pseudobulbar 
palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy.[4] ALS itself can be classified a few 
different ways - by how fast the disease progresses (slow vs fast progressors), 
by whether it is inherited or sporadic, and by where it starts.[1] Most 
commonly (~70% of the time) the limbs are affected first - in this case 
neurons in the brain (upper motor neurons) and in the spinal cord (lower 
motor neurons) are dying and this form is called "limb onset". In about 
25% of cases, muscles in the face, mouth, and throat are affected first 
because motor neurons in the part of the brain stem called the Medulla 
oblongata (formerly called the "bulb") start to die first along with lower 
motor neurons - this form is called "bulbar onset". In about 5% of cases 
muscles in the trunk of the body are affected first. In all cases the disease 
spreads and affects other regions.[5] The disorder causes muscle weakness 
and atrophy throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper and 
lower motor neurons. Individuals affected by the disorder may ultimately 
lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement, although 
bladder and bowel function and the muscles responsible for eye movement 
are usually spared until the final stages of the disorder.[8] Cognitive 
and/or behavioural dysfunction is present in up to half of individuals 
with ALS. Around half of people with ALS will experience mild changes in 
cognition and behaviour, and 10 - 15% will show signs of frontotemporal 
dementia.[8] Repeating phrases or gestures, apathy, and loss of inhibition 
are frequently reported behavioural features of ALS.[14] Language dysfunction, 
executive dysfunction, and troubles with social cognition and verbal memory 
are the most commonly reported cognitive symptoms in ALS; a meta-analysis 
found no relationship between dysfunction and disease severity.[15] However, 
cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions have been found to correlate with 
reduced survival in people with ALS and increased caregiver burden; this 
may be due in part to deficits in social cognition.[15] About half the 
people who have ALS experience emotional lability, in which they cry or 
laugh for no reason.[8] Sensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system 
are generally unaffected, meaning the majority of people with ALS maintain 
hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste.[1] The start of ALS may be so 
subtle that the symptoms are overlooked.[1] The earliest symptoms of ALS 
are muscle weakness and/or muscle atrophy. Other presenting symptoms include 
trouble swallowing or breathing, cramping, or stiffness of affected muscles; 
muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg; and/or slurred and nasal speech. 
The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which 
motor neurons in the body are damaged first.[16] In limb onset ALS people 
first experience awkwardness when walking or running or even tripping over 
or stumbling may be experienced and often this is marked by walking with 
a "dropped foot" which drags gently on the ground. Or if arm-onset, difficulty 
with tasks requiring manual dexterity such as buttoning a shirt, writing, 
or turning a key in a lock may be experienced.[16] In bulbar-onset ALS, 
initial symptoms will mainly be of difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing. 
Speech may become slurred, nasal in character, or quieter. There may be 
difficulty in swallowing and loss of tongue mobility. A smaller proportion 
of people experience "respiratory-onset" ALS, where the intercostal muscles 
that support breathing are affected first.[5] Over time, people experience 
increasing difficulty moving, swallowing (dysphagia), and speaking or forming 
words (dysarthria). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include 
tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) and exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia) 
including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called 
Babinski's sign also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower 
motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, 
and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin (fasciculations) 
although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom and more of a side effect 
so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy.[1] 
Although the order and rate of symptoms varies from person to person, the 
disease eventually spreads to unaffected regions and the affected regions 
become more affected. Most people eventually are not able to walk or use 
their hands and arms, lose the ability to speak and swallow food and their 
own saliva, and begin to lose the ability to cough and to breathe on their 
own.[8] The rate of progression can be measured using an outcome measure 
called the "ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R)", a 12-item 
instrument administered as a clinical interview or self-reported questionnaire 
that produces a score between 48 (normal function) and 0 (severe disability);[17] 
it is the most commonly used outcome measure in clinical trials and is 
used by doctors to track disease progression.[18] Though the degree of 
variability is high and a small percentage of people have a much slower 
disorder, on average, people with ALS lose about 0.9 FRS points per month. 
A survey-based study amongst clinicians showed that they rated a 20% change 
in the slope of the ALSFRS-R as being clinically meaningful.[19] Disorder 
progression tends to be slower in people who are younger than 40 at onset,[20] 
are mildly obese,[21] have disorder restricted primarily to one limb, and 
those with primarily upper motor neuron symptoms.[22] Conversely, progression 
is faster and prognosis poorer in people with bulbar-onset disorder, respiratory-onset 
disorder, and frontotemporal dementia.[22] The CX3CR1 allelic variants 
have also been shown to have an effect on the disorder's progression and 
life expectancy.[23] Difficulty in chewing and swallowing makes eating 
very difficult and increases the risk of choking or of aspirating food 
into the lungs. In later stages of the disorder, aspiration pneumonia can 
develop, and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem 
that may require the insertion of a feeding tube. As the diaphragm and 
intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures 
of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. 
In respiratory-onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness 
is apparent. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or pneumonia.[5] 
Although respiratory support can ease problems with breathing and prolong 
survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. Most people with ALS 
die between 2 and four years after the diagnosis.[8] Around half of people 
with ALS die within 30 months of their symptoms beginning, and about 20% 
of people with ALS live between 5 years and 10 years after symptoms begin.[5] 
Guitarist Jason Becker has lived since 1989 with the disorder, while physicist 
Stephen Hawking has survived for more than 50 years, but they are considered 
unusual cases.[24] Most people with ALS die in their own home, with their 
breath failing while they sleep; people rarely choke to death.[3] About 
5–10% of cases are directly inherited from a person's parents.[5] Overall, 
first-degree relatives of an individual with ALS have a 1% risk of developing 
ALS.[25][26] A defect on chromosome 21, which codes for superoxide dismutase, 
is associated with about 20% of familial cases of ALS, or about 2% of ALS 
cases overall.[27][28][29] This mutation is believed to be transmitted 
in an autosomal dominant manner, and has over a hundred different forms 
of mutation. The most common ALS-causing mutation is a mutant SOD1 gene, 
seen in North America; this is characterized by an exceptionally rapid 
progression from onset to death. The most common mutation found in Scandinavian 
countries, D90A-SOD1, is more slowly progressive than typical ALS, and 
people with this form of the disorder survive for an average of 11 years.[30] 
In 2011, a genetic abnormality known as a hexanucleotide repeat was found 
in a region called C9orf72, which is associated with ALS combined with 
frontotemporal dementia ALS-FTD,[31] and accounts for some 6% of cases 
of ALS among white Europeans.[32] The UBQLN2 gene encodes production of 
the protein ubiquilin 2 in the cell, which is a member of the ubiquilin 
family and controls the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Mutations 
in UBQLN2 interfere with protein degradation, leading to neurodegeneration 
and causing dominantly inherited, chromosome X-linked ALS and ALS/dementia.[33] 
To date, a number of genetic mutations have been associated with various 
types of ALS. The currently known associations are: In 1993, scientists 
discovered that mutations in the gene (SOD1) that produces the Cu-Zn superoxide 
dismutase (SOD1) enzyme were associated with around 20% of familial ALS. 
This enzyme is a powerful antioxidant that protects the body from damage 
caused by superoxide, a toxic free radical generated in the mitochondria. 
Free radicals are highly reactive molecules produced by cells during normal 
metabolism. Free radicals can accumulate and cause damage to DNA and proteins 
within cells. To date, over 110 different mutations in SOD1 have been linked 
with the disorder, some of which (such as H46R) have a very long clinical 
course, while others, such as A4V, are exceptionally aggressive. When the 
defenses against oxidative stress fail, programmed cell death (apoptosis) 
is upregulated. A defect in SOD1 could be a loss or gain of function. A 
loss of SOD1 function could lead to an accumulation of free radicals. A 
gain of SOD1 function could be toxic in other ways.[40][41] Aggregate accumulation 
of mutant SOD1 is suspected to play a role in disrupting cellular functions 
by damaging mitochondria, proteasomes, protein folding chaperones, or other 
proteins.[42] Any such disruption, if proven, would lend significant credibility 
to the theory that aggregates are involved in mutant SOD1 toxicity. Critics 
have noted that in humans, SOD1 mutations cause only 2% or so of overall 
cases and the etiological mechanisms may be distinct from those responsible 
for the sporadic form of the disease. To date, the ALS-SOD1 mice remain 
the best model of the disease for preclinical studies, but it is hoped 
that more useful models will be developed. While moderate to severe traumatic 
brain injury is a risk for ALS, it is unclear if mild traumatic brain injury 
increases rates.[43][44] In 1994 the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH) reported a nonsignificant increase in nervous 
system disorders due to four cases of ALS among NFL football players. It 
was unclear if this was due to chance or not.[45] Another study from 2012 
also found a possible increase in ALS in NFL football players.[46] An older 
study did not find an increased risk among high school football players.[43] 
A 2007 review found an increased risk among soccer players.[44] ALS may 
also occur more often among the US military veterans however the reason 
is unknown.[47] This may be due to head injury.[48] After the 2012 report 
was released, some NFL players involved in the legal settlement with the 
NFL complained that the NFL, which initially agreed to pay $765 million, 
was not doing enough to help players. The judge in the case concurred, 
and the NFL then agreed to pay an unlimited amount of damages for players 
found to have ALS, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.[49] 
Where no family history of the disease is present – i.e., in around 90% 
of cases – no cause is known for ALS. Possible associations for which evidence 
is inconclusive include military service, frequent drug use, and participation 
in contact sports.[medical citation needed] Studies also have focused on 
the role of glutamate in motor neuron degeneration. Glutamate is one of 
the neurotransmitters in the brain. Scientists have found, compared with 
healthy people, people with ALS have higher levels of glutamate in their 
serum and spinal fluid.[28] Riluzole, which targets glutamate transporters, 
is currently the only FDA-approved drug for ALS. It has only a modest effect 
on survival, however, suggesting that excess glutamate is not the sole 
cause of the disease. Certain studies suggested a link between sporadic 
ALS, specifically in athletes, and a diet enriched with branched-chain 
amino acids, a common dietary supplement among athletes, which cause cell 
hyperexcitability resembling that usually observed in people with ALS. 
The proposed underlying mechanism is that cell hyperexcitability results 
in increased calcium absorption by the cell, and thus brings about cell 
death of neuronal cells, which have particularly low calcium buffering 
capabilities.[50] Some evidence supports the hypothesis that superoxide 
dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein misfolding propagates between molecules in a 
similar fashion to prions.[51] Similarly, it has been proposed that incorporation 
of the cyanobacterial toxin β-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) leads to another 
prion-like protein misfolding propagation.[52][53] Another very common 
factor associated with ALS is a lesion to the motor system in areas such 
as the frontotemporal lobes.[54] Lesions in these areas often show signs 
of early deficit, which can be used to predict the loss of motor function, 
and result in the spread of ALS.[54] The mechanisms of ALS are present 
long before any signs or symptoms become apparent.[55] Before any muscular 
atrophy becomes apparent during ALS, roughly one-third of the motor neurons 
must be destroyed.[55] Other potential risk factors including chemical 
exposure, electromagnetic field exposure, occupation, physical trauma, 
and electric shock, have been investigated, but are without consistent 
findings.[56][57] There is a tentative association with exposure to a number 
of pesticides including the organochlorine insecticides aldrin, dieldrin, 
DDT, and toxaphene.[58][59][60] The defining feature of ALS is the death 
of both upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex of the brain, 
the brain stem, and the spinal cord. Prior to their destruction, motor 
neurons develop protein-rich inclusions in their cell bodies and axons. 
This may be partly due to defects in protein degradation.[33] These inclusions 
often contain ubiquitin, and generally incorporate one of the ALS-associated 
proteins: SOD1, TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43, or TARDBP), and/or FUS.[61] 
No test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS, although the presence 
of upper and lower motor neuron signs in a single limb is strongly suggestive.[1] 
Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on the symptoms and signs 
the physician observes in the person and a series of tests to rule out 
other diseases.[1] Physicians obtain the person's full medical history 
and usually conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess 
whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, hyperreflexia, 
and spasticity are worsening.[1] Because symptoms of ALS can be similar 
to those of a wide variety of other, more treatable diseases or disorders, 
appropriate tests must be conducted to exclude the possibility of other 
conditions.[1] One of these tests is electromyography (EMG), a special 
recording technique that detects electrical activity in muscles.[1] Certain 
EMG findings can support the diagnosis of ALS.[1] Another common test measures 
nerve conduction velocity (NCV).[1] Specific abnormalities in the NCV results 
may suggest, for example, that the person has a form of peripheral neuropathy 
(damage to peripheral nerves) or myopathy (muscle disease) rather than 
ALS. While a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often normal in people 
with early stage ALS, they can reveal evidence of other problems that may 
be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord tumor, multiple sclerosis, 
a herniated disk in the neck, syringomyelia, or cervical spondylosis.[1] 
Based on the person's symptoms and findings from the examination and from 
these tests, the physician may order tests on blood and urine samples to 
eliminate the possibility of other diseases, as well as routine laboratory 
tests.[1] In some cases, for example, if a physician suspects the person 
may have a myopathy rather than ALS, a muscle biopsy may be performed.[1] 
Viral infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human 
T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV), Lyme disease,[62] syphilis[63] and tick-borne 
encephalitis[64] can in some cases cause ALS-like symptoms.[1] Neurological 
disorders such as multiple sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, multifocal motor 
neuropathy, CIDP, spinal muscular atrophy, and spinal and bulbar muscular 
atrophy can also mimic certain aspects of the disease and should be considered.[1] 
ALS must be differentiated from the "ALS mimic syndromes" which are unrelated 
disorders that may have a similar presentation and clinical features to 
ALS or its variants.[65] Because of the prognosis carried by this diagnosis 
and the variety of diseases or disorders that can resemble ALS in the early 
stages of the disease, people should always obtain a specialist neurological 
opinion, so alternative diagnoses are clinically ruled out. Benign fasciculation 
syndrome is another condition that mimics many of the symptoms of ALS, 
but is accompanied by normal EMG readings and no major disablement.[citation 
needed] However, most cases of ALS are readily diagnosed and the error 
rate of diagnosis in large ALS clinics is less than 10%.[66][67] In one 
study, 190 people who met the MND/ALS diagnostic criteria, complemented 
with laboratory research in compliance with both research protocols and 
regular monitoring. Thirty of these people (16%) had their diagnosis completely 
changed during the clinical observation development period.[68] In the 
same study, three people had a false negative diagnosis, myasthenia gravis 
(MG), an autoimmune disease. MG can mimic ALS and other neurological disorders 
leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. MG is eminently treatable; 
ALS is not.[69] Myasthenic syndrome, also known as Lambert–Eaton syndrome, 
can mimic ALS and its initial presentation can be similar to that of MG.[70][71] 
Management of ALS attempts to relieve symptoms and extend life expectancy. 
This supportive care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of health 
care professionals working with the person and their caregivers to keep 
them as mobile and comfortable as possible.[citation needed] Riluzole (Rilutek) 
has been found to modestly improve survival.[72] It lengthens survival 
by several months, and may have a greater survival benefit for those with 
a bulbar onset. It also extends the time before a person needs ventilation 
support. People taking it must be monitored for liver damage (occurring 
in about 10% of people taking the drug).[73] It is approved by Food and 
Drug Administration (US) and recommended by the National Institute for 
Clinical Excellence (UK). Riluzole does not reverse damage already done 
to motor neurons.[74] Other medications may be used to help reduce fatigue, 
ease muscle cramps, control spasticity, and reduce excess saliva and phlegm. 
Drugs also are available to help people with pain, depression, sleep disturbances, 
dysphagia, and constipation. Baclofen and diazepam are often prescribed 
to control the spasticity caused by ALS, and trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline 
may be prescribed when people with ALS begin having trouble swallowing 
their saliva.[8] When the muscles that assist in breathing weaken, use 
of ventilatory assistance (intermittent positive pressure ventilation, 
bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or biphasic cuirass ventilation 
(BCV) may be used to aid breathing. Such devices artificially inflate the 
person's lungs from various external sources that are applied directly 
to the face or body. When muscles are no longer able to maintain oxygen 
and carbon dioxide levels, these devices may be used full-time. BCV has 
the added advantage of being able to assist in clearing secretions by using 
high-frequency oscillations followed by several positive expiratory breaths.[75] 
People may eventually consider forms of mechanical ventilation (respirators) 
in which a machine inflates and deflates the lungs. To be effective, this 
may require a tube that passes from the nose or mouth to the windpipe (trachea) 
and for long-term use, an operation such as a tracheotomy, in which a plastic 
breathing tube is inserted directly in the person's windpipe through an 
opening in the neck.[citation needed] Persons and their families should 
consider several factors when deciding whether and when to use one of these 
options. Ventilation devices differ in their effect on the person's quality 
of life and in cost. Although ventilation support can ease problems with 
breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. 
People need to be fully informed about these considerations and the long-term 
effects of life without movement before they make decisions about ventilation 
support and have deep discussions on quality of life. Some persons under 
long-term tracheotomy intermittent positive pressure ventilation with deflated 
cuffs or cuffless tracheotomy tubes (leak ventilation) are able to speak, 
provided their bulbar muscles are strong enough, though in all cases speech 
will be lost as the disease progresses. This technique preserves speech 
in some persons with long-term mechanical ventilation. Other persons may 
be able to use a speaking valve such as a Passey-Muir speaking valve with 
the assistance and guidance of a speech-language pathologist.[citation 
needed] External ventilation machines that use the ventilation mode of 
BiPAP are frequently used to support breathing, initially at night, and 
later during the daytime, as well. The use of BPAP (more often referred 
to as noninvasive ventilation, NIV) is only a temporary remedy, however, 
and long before BPAP stops being effective, persons should decide whether 
to have a tracheotomy and long-term mechanical ventilation. At this point, 
some persons choose palliative hospice care.[citation needed] Physical 
therapy plays a large role in rehabilitation for individuals with ALS. 
Specifically, physical and occupational therapists can set goals and promote 
benefits for individuals with ALS by delaying loss of strength, maintaining 
endurance, limiting pain, preventing complications, and promoting functional 
independence.[76] Occupational therapy and special equipment such as assistive 
technology can also enhance people's independence and safety throughout 
the course of ALS. Gentle, low-impact aerobic exercise such as performing 
activities of daily living, walking, swimming, and stationary bicycling 
can strengthen unaffected muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and help 
people fight fatigue and depression. Range of motion and stretching exercises 
can help prevent painful spasticity and shortening (contracture) of muscles. 
Physical and occupational therapists can recommend exercises that provide 
these benefits without overworking muscles. They can suggest devices such 
as ramps, braces, walkers, bathroom equipment (shower chairs, toilet risers, 
etc.), and wheelchairs that help people remain mobile. Occupational therapists 
can provide or recommend equipment and adaptations to enable people to 
retain as much safety and independence in activities of daily living as 
possible.[citation needed] People with ALS who have difficulty speaking 
may benefit from working with a speech-language pathologist. These health 
professionals can teach people adaptive strategies such as techniques to 
help them speak louder and more clearly. As ALS progresses, speech-language 
pathologists can recommend the use of augmentative and alternative communication 
such as voice amplifiers, speech-generating devices (or voice output communication 
devices) and/or low tech communication techniques such as head mounted 
laser pointers, alphabet boards or yes/no signals.[citation needed] People 
with ALS and caregivers can learn from dieticians how to plan and prepare 
numerous small meals throughout the day that provide enough calories, fiber 
and fluid, and how to avoid foods that are difficult to swallow. People 
may begin using suction devices to remove excess fluids or saliva and prevent 
choking. Occupational therapists can assist with recommendations for adaptive 
equipment to ease the physical task of self-feeding. Speech-language pathologists 
make food choice recommendations that are more conducive to their unique 
deficits and abilities. When people with ALS can no longer get enough nourishment 
from eating, doctors may advise inserting a feeding tube into the stomach. 
The use of a feeding tube also reduces the risk of choking and pneumonia 
that can result from inhaling liquids into the lungs. The tube is not painful 
and does not prevent people from eating food orally if they wish.[citation 
needed] Researchers have stated, "ALS patients have a chronically deficient 
intake of energy and recommended augmentation of energy intake"[77] and 
have a severe loss of appetite.[78] Both animal[79] and human research[77][unreliable 
medical source?] [80][unreliable medical source?] suggest that ALS patients 
should be encouraged to consume as many calories as possible and not to 
restrict their caloric intake. As of 2012, "a lack of robust evidence for 
interventions" remained for the management of weight loss.[81] Social workers 
and home care and hospice nurses help people with ALS, their families, 
and caregivers with the medical, emotional, and financial challenges of 
coping, particularly during the final stages of the disease. Social workers 
provide support such as assistance in obtaining financial aid, arranging 
durable power of attorney, preparing a living will, and finding support 
groups for patients and caregivers. Home nurses are available not only 
to provide medical care, but also to teach caregivers about tasks such 
as maintaining respirators, giving feedings, and moving people to avoid 
painful skin problems and contractures. Home hospice nurses work in consultation 
with physicians to ensure proper medication, pain control, and other care 
affecting the quality of life of people with ALS who wish to remain at 
home. The home hospice team can also counsel people with ALS and caregivers 
about end-of-life issues.[citation needed] In much of the world, rates 
of ALS are unknown.[5] In Europe, the disease affects about 2.2 people 
per 100,000 per year.[5] In the United States, more than 5,600 are diagnosed 
every year (over 1.87 per 100,000 per year), and up to 30,000 Americans 
are currently affected. ALS is responsible for two deaths per 100,000 people 
per year.[82] ALS is classified as a rare disease, designated by the FDA 
as an “orphan” disease (affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United 
States), but is the most common motor neuron disease. People of all races 
and ethnic backgrounds are affected. One or two of 100,000 people develop 
ALS each year.[83] Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis affects around 30,000 
Americans.[84] ALS cases are estimated at 1.2–4.0 per 100,000 individuals 
in Caucasian populations with a lower rate in other ethnic populations.[85] 
Filipinos are second to Caucasians in terms of ALS prevalence with 1.1-2.8 
per 100,000 individuals.[84] Reports have been made of several "clusters" 
including three American football players from the San Francisco 49ers, 
more than 50 association football players in Italy,[86] three association 
football-playing friends in the south of England,[87] and conjugal (husband 
and wife) cases in the south of France.[88][89][90][91][92] Although many 
authors consider ALS to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental 
risk factors, so far the latter have not been firmly identified, other 
than a higher risk with increasing age. Descriptions of the disease date 
back to at least 1824 by Charles Bell.[10] English scientist Augustus Waller 
described the appearance of shriveled nerve fibers in 1850. In 1869, the 
connection between the symptoms and the underlying neurological problems 
were first described by Jean-Martin Charcot, who introduced the term amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis in his 1874 paper.[10] In 1881, the article was translated 
into English and published in a three-volume edition of Lectures on the 
Diseases of the Nervous System. ALS became a cause célèbre in the United 
States in 1939 when baseball legend Lou Gehrig's career, and two years 
later, his life, were ended by the disease.[93] In the 1950s, an epidemic 
occurred among the Chamorro people on Guam which bore similarities to many 
conditions, including ALS.[94] By 1991, researchers had linked chromosome 
21 to familial ALS (FALS). In 1993, the SOD1 gene on chromosome 21 was 
found to play a role in some cases of FALS. In 1996, riluzole became the 
first FDA-approved drug for ALS.[citation needed] In 1998, the El Escorial 
criteria were developed as the standard for classifying people with ALS 
in clinical research. The next year, the revised ALS Functional Rating 
Scale was published and soon becomes a gold standard for clinical research. 
Noncoding repeat expansions in C9ORF72 were found to be a major cause of 
ALS and frontotemporal dementia in 2011.[citation needed] Amyotrophic comes 
from the Greek word amyotrophia: a- means "no", myo refers to "muscle", 
and trophia means "nourishment"; amyotrophia therefore means "no muscle 
nourishment," which describes the characteristic atrophy of the sufferer's 
disused muscle tissue. Lateral identifies the areas in a person's spinal 
cord where affected portions of the nerve cells are located. Degeneration 
in this area leads to scarring or hardening ("sclerosis"). In Commonwealth 
countries the term motor neurone disease (MND) is commonly used.[3] In 
August 2014, a challenge went viral online which was commonly known as 
the "ALS Ice Bucket Challenge".[95] Contestants fill a bucket full of ice 
and water, then state who nominated them to do the challenge, and nominate 
three other individuals of their choice to take part in it. The contestants 
then dump the buckets of ice and water onto themselves. However, it can 
be done in a different order. The contestants then donate at least US $10 
(or a similar amount in their local currency) to ALS research at the ALS 
Association, or Motor Neurone Disease Association in the UK. Any contestants 
who refuse to have the ice and water dumped on them are expected to donate 
at least US$100 to ALS research. As of July 2015, the Ice Bucket Challenge 
had raised $115 million for the ALS Association.[96] Many celebrities have 
taken part in the challenge.[97] The Ice Bucket Challenge was credited 
with helping to raise funds that contributed to the discovery that the 
gene NEK1 may potentially contribute to the development for ALS.[98][99] 
ALS is the central topic of the 2014 movie You're Not You, directed by 
George C. Wolfe, with Hilary Swank, Emmy Rossum and Josh Duhamel playing 
the main characters.[100] A number of clinical trials are underway globally 
for ALS; a comprehensive listing of trials in the US can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov. 
A large genetic study, called project MinE, initiated by two people with 
ALS is going on currently. It is a crowdfunded research project with many 
countries involved to discover more genes.[101] A division of the US Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention maintains a registry of Americans with 
ALS.[102] In 2009 researchers in the North American ALS Research Group 
started reviewing alternative and off-label ALS treatments that circulated 
on the internet and began publishing them under the rubric "ALS Untangled".[103][104] 
As of 2014 the group of scientists and clinicians reviewing such treatments 
and publishing the results had expanded to 95 people in 10 different countries.[104] 
Creatine has been well studied as a treatment for ALS; it has no effect.[105] 
As of 2013 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation had been studied 
in ALS in small and poorly designed clinical trials; as of 2013 there was 
insufficient evidence to know if rTMS is safe or effective for ALS.[106] 
In 2016 the ALS patient group PatientsLikeMe worked with investigators 
at Duke University to organize a clinical trial of the dietary supplement 
lunasin, which had been the subject of internet discussions among patients.[107] 
Masitinib has been approved as an orphan medication in Europe and the United 
States with studies ongoing as of 2016.[108] This article incorporates
