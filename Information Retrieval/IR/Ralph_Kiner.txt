Ralph McPherran Kiner (October 27, 1922 – February 6, 2014) was an American 
Major League Baseball player. An outfielder, Kiner played for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Chicago Cubs, and Cleveland Indians from 1946 through 1955. Following 
his retirement, Kiner served from 1956 through 1960 as general manager 
of the Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres.[1] He also served as an announcer 
for the New York Mets from the team's inception until his death. Though 
injuries forced his retirement from active play after 10 seasons, Kiner's 
tremendous slugging outpaced all of his National League contemporaries 
between the years 1946 and 1952. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1975. At the time of his death, baseball writer Marty Noble named 
Kiner "one of baseball's genuine and most charming gentlemen".[2] Kiner 
was born in Santa Rita, New Mexico, and raised in Alhambra, California 
by his mother, Beatrice Grayson Kiner, after his father Ralph died when 
he was 4 years old.[3] He was of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) and Scots-Irish 
ancestry, although his maternal grandmother was Jewish.[4] Kiner served 
as a U.S. Navy pilot during World War II.[5] Kiner made his major league 
debut on April 12, 1946, with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He finished the season 
with 23 home runs, but 109 strikeouts. After the season, the Pirates convinced 
future Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg not to retire. Greenberg gave Kiner 
hours of instruction,[6] and in 1947, Kiner led the major leagues with 
51 home runs while striking out fewer than 100 times.[4] Many of Kiner's 
homers were hit into a shortened left-field and left-center-field porch 
at Forbes Field (originally built for Greenberg and known in the press 
as "Greenberg Gardens"); the porch was retained for Kiner and redubbed 
"Kiner's Korner".[7] Kiner would later use "Kiner's Korner" as the title 
of his post-game TV show in New York.[2] In 1949 Kiner topped his 1947 
total with 54 home runs, falling just two short of Hack Wilson's then-National 
League record. It was the highest total in the major leagues from 1939 
to 1960, and the highest National League total from 1931 to 1997. It made 
Kiner the first National League player with two 50 plus home run seasons. 
Kiner also matched his peak of 127 RBIs. From 1947 to 1951, Kiner topped 
40 home runs and 100 RBIs each season. Through 2011 he was one of seven 
major leaguers to have had at least four 30-HR, 100-RBI seasons in their 
first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Mark 
Teixeira, Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard and Ryan Braun.[8][9] Kiner's string 
of seasons leading the league in home runs reached seven in 1952, when 
he hit 37. This also was the last of a record six consecutive seasons in 
which he led Major League Baseball in home runs, all under the guidance 
of manager Billy Meyer and Pirate great Honus Wagner. He was selected to 
participate in the All-Star Game in six straight seasons, 1948 to 1953.[10] 
A quote variously attributed to Kiner himself, as well as to teammates 
talking about Kiner, was "Home run hitters drive Cadillacs and singles 
hitters drive Fords."[11] Footage of Kiner hitting a home run in Forbes 
Field can be seen in the 1951 film Angels in the Outfield.[12] On June 
4, 1953, Kiner was sent to the Chicago Cubs as part of a ten-player trade. 
The Pirates traded Kiner, Joe Garagiola, George Metkovich, and Howie Pollet 
to the Cubs in exchange for Bob Addis, Toby Atwell, George Freese, Gene 
Hermanski, Bob Schultz, Preston Ward, and $150,000.[13] This was largely 
due to continued salary disputes with Pirate general manager Branch Rickey, 
who reportedly told Kiner, "We finished last with you, we can finish last 
without you."[14] Kiner played the rest of 1953 and all of 1954 with the 
Cubs, finishing his career with the Cleveland Indians in 1955. A back injury 
forced him to retire at the age of 32, finishing his career with 369 home 
runs, 1019 runs batted in and a .279 lifetime batting average.[2] In 1961, 
Kiner entered the broadcast booth for the Chicago White Sox. The following 
year, Kiner, Lindsey Nelson and Bob Murphy began broadcasting the games 
of the expansion New York Mets on WOR-TV in New York City. The trio rotated 
announcing duties. Kiner also hosted a post-game show known as "Kiner's 
Korner" on WOR-TV. Nationally, he helped call the Mets' appearance in the 
1969 World Series for NBC Radio. He won a local Emmy Award for his broadcasting 
work.[14] Kiner was known for his occasional malapropisms, usually connected 
with getting people's names wrong, such as calling broadcasting partner 
Tim McCarver as "Tim MacArthur" and calling Gary Carter "Gary Cooper".[14] 
He even once called himself "Ralph Korner".[15] Despite a bout with Bell's 
palsy, which left him with slightly slurred speech,[16] Kiner continued 
broadcasting for 53 seasons.[17] Kiner's tenure with the Mets was the third-longest 
for an active broadcaster with a single team as of his final season. He 
is the third longest-tenured broadcaster in baseball history, trailing 
only Los Angeles Dodgers announcers Vin Scully (1950–2016) and Jaime Jarrín 
(1959–present). His traditional home run call—"It is gone, goodbye" was 
a signature phrase in baseball. Kiner appeared occasionally on SportsNet 
New York (SNY) and WPIX, which currently televise Mets games. During these 
visits (usually once a week), regular announcers Gary Cohen, Keith Hernandez, 
and Ron Darling made room for Kiner as he shared stories of old-time baseball, 
as well as the current state of the game. During his final season (2013), 
he was the oldest active announcer in Major League Baseball. Partly owing, 
as Kiner once said, to the fact that Hollywood megastar Bing Crosby was 
part-owner of the Pirates, Kiner was often closely linked with the likes 
of celebrities such as Crosby's colleague Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra, but 
even more to publicized romances, dates or just splashy photos with leading 
ladies, such as Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner and Janet Leigh. Kiner was 
married four times; his first spouse was 1950s tennis star Nancy Chaffee, 
1951 -1968.[18][19] Kiner was also married to Barbara (née George)[20] 
Kiner, from 1969–1980; and to DiAnn (née Shugart)[21] Kiner from 1982 until 
her death in 2004.[22][23] Ralph Kiner died from natural causes in Rancho 
Mirage, California on February 6, 2014 at the age of 91.[24] His family 
was at his side at the time of his death.[25] Upon his death, New York 
Mets owner Fred Wilpon stated "Ralph Kiner was one of the most beloved 
people in Mets history—An original Met and extraordinary gentleman."[26] 
At the time of his death, Kiner was battling Bell's palsy, and the effects 
of a stroke he had suffered a decade ago that forced him to cut his schedule 
to a handful of games a season.[27] On February 21, 2014, an online Twitter 
petition was started to rename Citi Field Sections 132–134 as Kiner's Korner, 
to commemorate the 52-year Mets career of Ralph Kiner.[28] As of March 
29, 2014, the petition had over 5000 followers.[29] Kiner is survived by 
ex-wife, Ann Benisch (after their marriage ended in divorce), and also 
by sons Ralph and Scott; daughters, Kathryn Chaffee Freeman, Tracee Kiner 
Jansen and Kimberlee Kiner; and 12 grandchildren.[20][23] Kiner was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975.[30] Kiner had garnered 273 votes 
by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, one more than the minimum 
required for election. It was in his final year of eligibility (his 13th, 
as no vote was held in 1963 and 1965), and it was the closest call possible 
for any player elected by the BBWAA. (He would have had a chance later 
with the Veteran's Committee had he not been elected by the BBWAA). Kiner 
was also the only player voted in that year.[31][32] He attended every 
Hall of Fame ceremony from the time he was inducted, until his death.[2] 
Kiner was elected to the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1984.[33] The Pittsburgh 
Pirates retired his uniform number 4 on September 19, 1987.[34] The Sporting 
News placed him at number 90 on its 1999 list of "The 100 Greatest Baseball 
Players,[35] and he was one of the 100 finalists for the Major League Baseball 
All-Century Team that year. The Mets honored him with an on-field ceremony 
on "Ralph Kiner Night" at Shea Stadium on Saturday, July 14, 2007. On that 
night, fans were given photos of Kiner. Tom Seaver was present, giving 
a commemorative speech recalling Kiner's legacy. Other guests of note were 
Yogi Berra, Bob Feller, and broadcaster Ernie Harwell. As a present from
