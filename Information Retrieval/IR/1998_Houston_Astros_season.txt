The 1998 Houston Astros season marked their second consecutive trip to 
the postseason. They won a club-record 102 games, the first and only time 
in club history with at least 100 wins in a season. The Astros won their 
second consecutive National League Central title. First baseman Jeff Bagwell 
hit his first career grand slam while tying a career-high six runs batted 
in (RBI) against Cincinnati on September 9 in a 13–7 victory. It was his 
218th career home run, making his streak the then-longest among active 
players without a grand slam.[2] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]

season ended by defeat in four games to the San Diego Padres in the National 
League Division Series,[4] including losing two starts against Kevin Brown 
– one of the league's highest-accomplished pitchers that year[5] – both 
by a 2–1 score. As the Game 1 starter opposing Randy Johnson, Brown allowed 
no runs in eight innings and struck out 16 Astros, a career-high, and second 
to that point in MLB playoff history only to Bob Gibson's 17-strikeout 
performance in the 1968 World Series. [6] Bagwell, Derek Bell, and Craig 
Biggio combined for six hits in 51 at bats in this series.[7] LEAGUE CHAMPIONS:
