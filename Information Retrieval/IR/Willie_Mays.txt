Willie Howard Mays, Jr. (born May 6, 1931), nicknamed "The Say Hey Kid", 
is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) center fielder who spent 
almost all of his 22-season career playing for the New York and San Francisco 
Giants, before finishing with the New York Mets. He was elected to the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979, his first year of eligibility. Mays won 
two National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ended his career 
with 660 home runs - third at the time of his retirement and currently 
fifth all-time - and won a record-tying 12 Gold Glove awards beginning 
in 1957 when the award was introduced.[1] Mays shares the record of most 
appearances in the All-Star Games, 24, with Hank Aaron and Stan Musial.[2][3] 
In appreciation of his All-Star record, Ted Williams said "They invented 
the All-Star Game for Willie Mays."[4][5] Mays' career statistics and his 
longevity in the pre-performance-enhancing drugs era has drawn speculation 
that he may be the finest five-tool player ever, and many surveys and expert 
analyses, which have examined Mays' relative performance, have led to a 
growing opinion that Mays was possibly the greatest all-around baseball 
player of all time.[6] In 1999, Mays placed second on The Sporting News's 
"List of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players", making him the highest-ranking 
living player. Later that year, he was also elected to the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. Mays is one of five National League players 
to have had eight consecutive 100-RBI seasons, along with Mel Ott, Sammy 
Sosa, Chipper Jones, and Albert Pujols. Mays hit over 50 home runs in 1955 
and 1965, representing the longest time span between 50-plus home run seasons 
for any player in Major League Baseball history. His final Major League 
Baseball appearance came on October 16 during Game 3 of the 1973 World 
Series. Mays was born in Westfield, Alabama, just outside Fairfield. His 
father, Cat Mays, was a talented baseball player with the Negro team for 
the local iron plant.[7] His mother, Annie Satterwhite, was a gifted basketball 
and track star in high school.[8] His parents never married each other.[8] 
As a baby, Mays was cared for by his mother's younger sisters Sarah and 
Ernestine. Sarah became the primary female role model in Mays' life.[9] 
His father exposed him to baseball at an early age, and by the age of five 
he was playing catch with his father.[10] At age 10, Mays was allowed to 
sit on the bench of his father's League games.[11] Mays played multiple 
sports at Fairfield Industrial High School, averaging a then-record 17 
points a game in basketball and more than 40 yards a punt in football, 
while also playing quarterback.[12] Mays graduated from Fairfield in 1950.[13] 
Mays' professional baseball career began in 1947, while he was still in 
high school and played briefly with the Chattanooga Choo-Choos in Tennessee 
during the summer. A short time later, Mays left the Choo-Choos and returned 
to his home state to join the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American 
League. Mays helped them win their pennant and advance to the 1948 Negro 
League World Series, where they lost the series 4-1 to the Homestead Grays. 
Mays hit a respectable .262 for the season, but it was also his excellent 
fielding and baserunning that made him a standout. By playing professionally 
with the Black Barons, Mays jeopardized his opportunities to play high 
school sports in Alabama. This created some problems for him with high 
school administrators at Fairfield, who wanted him to help the teams and 
ticket sales.[14] Over the next several years, a number of Major League 
baseball franchises sent scouts to watch him play. The first was the Boston 
Braves. The scout who discovered him, Bud Maughn, had been following him 
for over a year and referred him to the Braves, who then packaged a deal 
which called for $7,500 down and $7,500 in 30 days. They also planned to 
give Mays $6,000. The obstacle in the deal was that Tom Hayes, owner of 
the Birmingham Black Barons, wanted to keep Mays for the balance of the 
season. Had the team been able to act more quickly, the Braves franchise 
might have had both Mays and Hank Aaron in their outfield from 1954 to 
1973. The Brooklyn Dodgers also scouted him and wanted Ray Blades to negotiate 
a deal, but were too late. The New York Giants had already signed Mays 
for $4,000 and assigned him to their Class-B affiliate in Trenton, New 
Jersey.[15] After Mays had a batting average of .353 in Trenton, he began 
the 1951 season with the class AAA Minneapolis Millers of the American 
Association. During his short time span in Minneapolis, Mays played with 
two other future Hall of Famers: Hoyt Wilhelm and Ray Dandridge. Batting 
.477 in 35 games and playing excellent defense, Mays was called up to the 
Giants on May 24, 1951. Mays was at a movie theater in Sioux City, Iowa 
when he found out he was being called up. A message flashed up on the screen 
that said: "WILLIE MAYS CALL YOUR HOTEL."[16] He appeared in his first 
major league game the next day in Philadelphia. Mays moved to Harlem, New 
York, where his mentor was a New York State Boxing Commission official 
and former Harlem Rens basketball legend "Strangler" Frank Forbes. Mays 
began his major league career with no hits in his first 12 at bats. On 
his 13th at-bat, he hit a home run over the left field roof of the Polo 
Grounds off future Hall of Famer Warren Spahn.[17] Spahn later joked, "I'll 
never forgive myself. We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I'd 
only struck him out." Mays' average improved steadily throughout the rest 
of the season. Although his .274 average, 68 RBI and 20 homers (in 121 
games) were among the lowest of his career, he still won the 1951 Rookie 
of the Year Award. During the Giants' comeback in August and September 
1951 to overtake the Dodgers in the 1951 pennant race, Mays' fielding and 
strong arm were instrumental to several important Giants victories.[18] 
Mays was in the on-deck circle when Bobby Thomson hit the Shot Heard 'Round 
the World against the Brooklyn Dodgers to win the three-game playoff 2-1 
after the teams had tied at the end of the regular season. The Giants went 
on to meet the New York Yankees in the 1951 World Series. Mays was part 
of the first all-African-American outfield in major league history, along 
with Hank Thompson and Hall of Famer Monte Irvin in game one of the 1951 
World Series.[19] Mays hit poorly while the Giants lost the series 4-2. 
The six-game set was the only time that Mays and the retiring Joe DiMaggio 
would compete on the same field.[20] Mays was a popular figure in Harlem. 
Magazine photographers were fond of chronicling his participation in local 
stickball games with kids. It was said that in the urban game of hitting 
a rubber ball with an adapted broomstick handle, Mays could hit a shot 
that measured "six sewers" (the distance of six consecutive New York City 
manhole covers, nearly 300 feet).[21][22] The United States Army drafted 
Mays in 1952 during the Korean War (1950–53) and he subsequently missed 
most of that season and all of the 1953 season. Mays spent much of his 
time in the Army playing baseball at Fort Eustis, Virginia.[23] It was 
at Fort Eustis that Mays learned the basket catch from a fellow Fort Eustis 
outfielder, Al Fortunato. Mays missed about 266 games due to military service. 
Mays returned to the Giants in 1954, hitting for a league-leading .345 
batting average and slugging 41 home runs. Mays won the National League 
Most Valuable Player Award and the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete 
of the year. He also was selected as an All-Star for the first of 19 consecutive 
seasons (20 total)[24][25] and replaced Jackie Robinson at the left field 
during the 4th inning of the All-Star Game. The Giants won the National 
League pennant and the 1954 World Series, sweeping the Cleveland Indians 
in four games. The 1954 series is perhaps best remembered for "The Catch", 
an over-the-shoulder running grab by Mays in deep center field of the Polo 
Grounds of a long drive off the bat of Vic Wertz during the eighth inning 
of Game 1. Considered the iconic image of Mays' playing career and one 
of baseball's most memorable fielding plays,[26] the catch prevented two 
Indian runners from scoring, preserving a tie game. The Giants won the 
game in the 10th inning on a three-run home run by Dusty Rhodes, with Mays 
scoring the winning run. The 1954 World Series was the team's last championship 
while based in New York. The next time was 56 years later when the San 
Francisco Giants won the World Series in 2010. Mays went on to perform 
at a high level each of the last three years the Giants were in New York. 
In 1955, he led the league with 51 home runs. In 1956, he hit 36 homers 
and stole 40 bases, being only the second player, and first National League 
player, to join the "30–30 club". In 1957, the first season the Gold Glove 
award was presented, he won the first of 12 consecutive Gold Glove Awards. 
At the same time, Mays continued to finish in the National League's top-five 
in a variety of offensive categories. Mays, Roberto Clemente (also with 
12), Al Kaline, Andruw Jones, Ken Griffey, Jr. and Ichiro Suzuki are the 
only outfielders to have ten or more career Gold Gloves. In 1957, Mays 
become the fourth player in Major League history to join the 20–20–20 club 
(2B, 3B, HR), something no player had accomplished since 1941. Mays also 
stole 38 bases that year, making him the second player in baseball history 
(after Frank Schulte in 1911) to reach 20 in each of those four categories 
(doubles, triples, homers, steals) in the same season. After the 1957 season, 
the Giants franchise and Mays relocated to San Francisco, California. Mays 
bought two homes in San Francisco, then lived in nearby Atherton.[27][28] 
As he did in 1954, Mays vied for the National League batting title in 1958 
until the final game of the season. Mays collected three hits in the game 
to finish with a career-high .347, but Philadelphia Phillies' Richie Ashburn 
won the title with a .350 batting average. He did manage to share the inaugural 
NL Player of the Month award with Stan Musial in May (no such award was 
given out in April until 1969), batting .405 with 12 HR and 29 RBI; he 
won a second such award in September (.434, 4 HR, 18 RBIs). In 1959, the 
Giants led by two games with only eight games to play, but only won two 
of their remaining games and finished fourth, as their pitching staff collapsed 
due to overwork of their top hurlers. The Dodgers won the pennant following 
a playoff with the Milwaukee Braves.[29] As he did in New York, Mays would 
"play around" with kids playing sandlot ball in San Francisco. On three 
occasions in 1959 or 1960, he visited Julius Kahn Playground, five blocks 
from where he lived, including one time Giant players Jim Davenport and 
Tom Haller.[citation needed][clarification needed] Alvin Dark was hired 
to manage the Giants before the start of the 1961 season and named Mays 
team captain. The improving Giants finished 1961 in third place and won 
85 games, more than any of the previous six campaigns. Mays had one of 
his best games on April 30, 1961, hitting four home runs against the Milwaukee 
Braves in County Stadium. Mays went four for five at the plate and was 
on deck for a chance to hit a record fifth home run when the Giants' half 
of the ninth inning ended.[30][31] Mays is the only Major Leaguer to have 
both three triples in a game and four home runs in a game.[32][33] The 
Giants won the National League pennant in 1962, with Mays leading the team 
in eight offensive categories. The team finished the regular season in 
a tie for first place with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and went on to win 
a three-game playoff series against the Dodgers, advancing to play in the 
World Series. The Giants lost to the Yankees in seven games, and Mays batted 
.250 with two extra-base hits. It was his last World Series appearance 
as a member of the Giants. In the 1963 and 1964 seasons Mays batted in 
over 100 runs and hit 85 total home runs. On July 2, 1963, Mays played 
in a game when future Hall of Fame members Warren Spahn and Juan Marichal 
each threw 15 scoreless innings. In the bottom of the 16th inning, Mays 
hit a home run off Spahn for a 1–0 Giants victory.[34] He won his third 
NL Player of the Month Award in August (.387, 8 HR, 27 RBI). Mays won his 
second MVP award in 1965 behind a career-high 52 home runs. On September 
13, 1965, he hit his 500th career home run off Don Nottebart. Warren Spahn, 
off whom Mays hit his first career home run, was his teammate at the time. 
After the home run, Spahn greeted Mays in the dugout, asking "Was it anything 
like the same feeling?" Mays replied "It was exactly the same feeling. 
Same pitch, too."[35] On August 22, 1965, Mays and Sandy Koufax acted as 
peacemakers during a 14-minute brawl between the Giants and Dodgers after 
San Francisco pitcher Juan Marichal had bloodied Dodgers catcher John Roseboro 
with a bat.[36] He also won his fourth and final NL Player of the Month 
award in August (.363, 17 HR, 29 RBI), while setting the NL record for 
most home runs in the month of August (since tied by Sammy Sosa in 2001). 
Mays played in over 150 games for 13 consecutive years (a major-league 
record) from 1954 to 1966. In 1966, his last with 100 RBIs, Mays finished 
third in the National League MVP voting. It was the ninth and final time 
he finished in the top five in the voting for the award.[37] In 1970, the 
Sporting News named Mays as the 1960s "Player of the Decade." Mays hit 
his 600th home run off San Diego's Mike Corkins in September 1969. Plagued 
by injuries that season, he managed only 13 home runs. Mays enjoyed a resurgence 
in 1970, hitting 28 homers, and got off to a fast start in 1971, the year 
he turned 40. He had 15 home runs at the All-Star break but faded down 
the stretch and finished with 18. Mays helped the Giants win the division 
title that year, but they lost the NLCS to the Pittsburgh Pirates. During 
his time on the Giants, Mays was friends with fellow player Bobby Bonds. 
When Bobby's son, Barry Bonds, was born, Bobby asked Mays to be Barry's 
godfather. Mays and the younger Bonds have maintained a close relationship 
ever since.[38] In May 1972, the 41-year-old Mays was traded to the New 
York Mets for pitcher Charlie Williams and $50,000 ($283,333 today).[39] 
At the time, the Giants franchise was losing money. Owner Horace Stoneham 
could not guarantee Mays an income after retirement and the Mets offered 
Mays a coaching position upon his retirement.[40] Mays had remained popular 
in New York long after the Giants had left for San Francisco, and the trade 
was seen as a public relations coup for the Mets. Mets owner Joan Whitney 
Payson, who was a minority shareholder of the Giants when the team was 
in New York, had long desired to bring Mays back to his baseball roots 
and was instrumental in making the trade.[41] On May 14, 1972, in his Mets 
debut, Mays put New York ahead to stay with a fifth-inning home run against 
Don Carrithers and his former team, the Giants, on a rainy Sunday afternoon 
at Shea Stadium. Then on August 16, 1973, in a game against the Cincinnati 
Reds with Don Gullett on the mound, Mays hit a fourth inning solo home 
run over the right-center field fence. It was the 660th, and last, home 
run of his major league career. Mays played a season and a half with the 
Mets before retiring, appearing in 133 games. The New York Mets honored 
him on September 25, 1973, (Willie Mays Night) where he thanked the New 
York fans and said goodbye to America. He finished his career in the 1973 
World Series, which the Mets lost to the Oakland Athletics in seven games. 
Mays got the first hit of the Series, but had only seven at-bats (with 
two hits). His final hit of his career came in Game 2, a key single to 
help the Mets win. He also fell down in the outfield during a play where 
he was hindered by the glare of the sun and by the hard outfield. Mays 
later said, "growing old is just a helpless hurt." His final at bat came 
on October 16, in Game 3 where he came in as a pinch hitter but grounded 
into a force play. Mays made his 20th and last All-Star appearance (20 
seasons)[24] and 24th All-Star Game appearance[2] on July 24, 1973 when 
he was used as a pinch hitter. In 1972 and 1973, Mays was the oldest regular 
position player in baseball. He became the oldest position player to appear 
in a World Series game.[42] Mays retired after the 1973 season with a lifetime 
batting average of .302 and 660 home runs. His lifetime total of 7,095 
outfield fielding putouts remains the major league record.[43] Mays is 
the only Major League player to have hit a home run in every inning from 
the 1st through the 16th innings.[44] He finished his career with a record 
22 extra-inning home runs. After Mays stopped playing baseball, he remained 
an active personality. Just as he had during his playing days, Mays continued 
to appear on various TV shows, in films and in other forms of non-sports-related 
media. He remained in the New York Mets organization as their hitting instructor 
until the end of the 1979 season.[45] It was there where he taught future 
Mets star Lee Mazzilli his famous basket catch.[46] On January 23, 1979, 
Mays was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. 
He garnered 409 of the 432 ballots cast (roughly 95 percent);[47] referring 
to the other 23 voters, acerbic New York Daily News columnist Dick Young 
wrote, "If Jesus Christ were to show up with his old baseball glove, some 
guys wouldn't vote for him. He dropped the cross three times, didn't he?"[26] 
Mays took up golf a few years after his promotion to the major leagues 
and quickly became an accomplished player, playing to a handicap of about 
four. After he retired, he played golf frequently in the San Francisco 
area.[48] Shortly after his Hall of Fame election, Mays took a job at the 
Park Place Casino (now Bally's Atlantic City) in Atlantic City, New Jersey. 
While there, he served as a Special Assistant to the Casino's President 
and as a greeter. After being told by Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn 
that he could not be both a coach and baseball goodwill ambassador while 
at the same time working for Bally's, Mays chose to terminate his baseball 
relationships.[49] In 1985 Peter Ueberroth, Kuhn's successor, decided to 
allow Mays and Mickey Mantle to return to baseball.[50] Like Mays, Mantle 
had gone to work for an Atlantic City casino and had to give up any baseball 
positions he held.[51] At the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985, former Mets 
teammate John Milner testified that Mays kept a bottle of liquid amphetamine 
in his locker at Shea Stadium. Milner admitted, however, that he had never 
seen Mays use amphetamines and Mays himself denied ever having taken any 
drugs during his career.[52] Since 1986, Mays has served as Special Assistant 
to the President of the San Francisco Giants. Mays' number 24 is retired 
by the San Francisco Giants. AT&T Park, the Giants stadium, is located 
at 24 Willie Mays Plaza. In front of the main entrance to the stadium is 
a larger-than-life statue of Mays. He also serves on the advisory board 
of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated 
to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro league players 
through financial and medical difficulties. On February 10, 2010, Mays 
appeared on The Daily Show, discussing his career and a new biography, 
Willie Mays: The Life, the Legend, by James S. Hirsch.[53] A frequent traveler, 
Mays is one of 66 holders of American Airlines' lifetime passes.[54] When 
Mays' godson Barry Bonds tied him for third on the all-time home run list, 
Mays greeted and presented him with a diamond-studded Olympic torch (given 
to Mays when he carried the torch during its tour through the United States). 
In 1992, when Bonds signed a free agent contract with the Giants, Mays 
personally offered Bonds his retired #24 (the number Bonds wore in Pittsburgh) 
but Bonds declined, electing to wear #25 instead, honoring his father, 
Bobby Bonds, who wore that number with the Giants.[55] Willie Mays Day 
was proclaimed by former mayor Willie Brown and reaffirmed by mayor Gavin 
Newsom to be every May 24 in San Francisco, paying tribute not only to 
his birth in the month (May 6), but also to his name (Mays) and jersey 
number (24). The date is also the anniversary of his call-up to the major 
leagues.[56] On May 24, 2004, during the 50-year anniversary of The Catch, 
Mays received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters degree from Yale 
University.[57] On December 6, 2005, he received the Bobby Bragan Youth 
Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award for his accomplishments on and off 
the field. On July 30, 2006, he was the Tee Ball Commissioner at 2006 White 
House Tee Ball Initiative[58] On June 10, 2007, Mays received an honorary 
doctorate from Dartmouth College. At the 2007 All-Star Game in San Francisco, 
Mays received a special tribute for his legendary contributions to the 
game and threw out the ceremonial first pitch. On December 5, 2007, California 
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Mays 
into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for 
History, Women and the Arts.[59] On June 4, 2008, Community Board 10 in 
Harlem voted unanimously to name an eight-block service road that connects 
to the Harlem River Drive from 155th Street to 163rd Street running adjacent 
to his beloved Polo Grounds—Willie Mays Drive.[60] On May 23, 2009, Mays 
gave the commencement address at San Francisco State University and received 
an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. On July 14, 2009, he accompanied 
U.S. President Barack Obama to St. Louis aboard Air Force One for the Major 
League All-Star Game.[61] On March 19, 2010, he was inducted into the African-American 
Ethnic Sports Hall of Fame[62] On May 6, 2010, on the occasion of his 79th 
birthday, Mays appeared on the floor of the California State Senate where 
they proclaimed it Willie Mays Day in the state. On May 15, 2010, Mays 
was awarded the Major League Baseball Beacon of Life Award at the Civil 
Rights game at Great American Ball Park. Mays has been mentioned or referenced 
in many popular songs. The Treniers recorded the song "Say Hey (The Willie 
Mays Song)" in 1955. The band Widespread Panic makes reference to Mays 
in the song "One Arm Steve" from their album 'Til the Medicine Takes. Terry 
Cashman's song "Talkin' Baseball" has the refrain "Willie, Mickey and the 
Duke", which subsequently became the title of an award given by the New 
York Baseball Writers Association.[63] John Fogerty mentioned Mays, Ty 
Cobb and Joe DiMaggio in his song "Centerfield". His name was also used 
on the album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan in the song "I Shall Be Free", 
and in Gil Scott-Heron's song "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised". Chuck 
Prophet wrote the song "Willie Mays is Up at Bat" for his 2012 "Temple 
Beautiful" album, a tribute to San Francisco. Mays is also mentioned in 
"Our Song" by singer/songwriter Joe Henry from the 2007 album Civilians. 
He is also the subject of the 1994 Americana music song "Homerun Willie" 
by John Dunnigan. Mays was mentioned numerous times in Charles M. Schulz's 
comic strip Peanuts. One of the most famous of these strips was originally 
published on February 9, 1966. In it, Charlie Brown is competing in a class 
spelling bee and he is asked to spell the word, "Maze". He erroneously 
spells it M-A-Y-S and screams out his dismay when he is eliminated. When 
Charlie Brown is later sent to the principal's office for raising his voice 
at the teacher regarding the incident, he wonders if one day he will meet 
Willie Mays and will have a good laugh together about the incident.[64] 
Willie Mays Parkway and Willie Mays Park in Orlando, Florida were named 
after the 1951 National League Rookie of the Year. Mays also appears on 
Calle 13's "Adentro" music video, where he gives to lead singer, René Pérez 
a bag containing a pair of sunglasses, a Roberto Clemente's baseball uniform, 
and a baseball bat signed by him, who then will be used by René to destroy 
his own luxury car, a Maserati, in an attempt to widespread a message to 
youth about how irresponsible promoting of ostentatious luxury excesses 
in urban music as a status symbol, have them all killing between themselves.[65][66] 
In the movies Major League and Major League II, the center fielder for 
the Cleveland Indians is named Willie Mays Hayes. He was originally portrayed 
by a then-unknown Wesley Snipes, but Omar Epps replaced Snipes in the sequel. 
In 1956, Mays persuaded many of Major League Baseball's biggest black stars 
to go on a tour around the country after the season had ended to play exhibition 
games. While much of the tour was undocumented, one venue was Andrews Field,[67] 
located in Fort Smith, Arkansas, on October 16. Among the players who played 
in that game were Mays, Frank Robinson, Hank Aaron, Elston Howard, Monte 
Irvin, Gene Baker, Charlie Johnson, Sam Jones, Hank Thompson and Joe Black. 
In November 2015, Mays was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by 
President Barack Obama during a ceremony at the White House.[68][69] At 
the ceremony Obama credited Mays' baseball career with his own success, 
saying, "Willie also served our country: In his quiet example while excelling 
on one of America's biggest stages [he] helped carry forward the banner 
of civil rights", adding, "It's because of giants like Willie that someone 
like me could even think about running for president."[69] In addition 
to appearances in baseball documentaries and on talk shows, Mays has appeared 
in several sitcoms over the years, always as himself. He appeared as the 
mystery guest during different incarnations of the long-running game show 
What's My Line?. He was in three episodes of ABC's The Donna Reed Show: 
"Play Ball" and "My Son the Catcher" (both 1964) and "Calling Willie Mays" 
(1966). Also in 1966, he appeared in the "Twitch or Treat" episode of Bewitched, 
in which Darrin Stephens asks if Mays is a warlock, and Samantha Stephens 
replies, "The way he hits? What else?" In 1989, he appeared in My Two Dads, 
in the episode "You Love Me, Right?", and in the episode "The Field" of 
Mr. Belvedere. Additionally, he had performed "Say Hey: The Willie Mays 
Song" on episode 4.46 of the Colgate Comedy Hour in 1954.[70] Mays married 
Marghuerite Wendell Chapman (1926–2010) in 1956, and they adopted their 
son Michael, who was born in 1959.[71] The couple divorced in 1962 or 1963, 
varying by source. Mays married Mae Louise Allen in November 1971. Allen 
died on April 19, 2013, after a long battle with Alzheimer's.[72] Mays 
has resided in Atherton, California since 1969.[73] It is not clear how 
Mays became known as the "Say Hey Kid." One story is that in 1951, Barney 
Kremenko, a writer for the New York Journal, proceeded to refer to Mays 
as the 'Say Hey Kid' after he overheard Mays say, "'Say who,' 'Say what,' 
'Say where,' 'Say hey'".[74] Another story is that Jimmy Cannon created 
the nickname because Mays did not know everybody's names when he first 
arrived in the minors. "You see a guy, you say, 'Hey, man. Say hey, man,'" 
Mays said. "Ted [Williams] was the 'Splinter'. Joe [DiMaggio] was 'Joltin' 
Joe'. Stan [Musial] was 'The Man'. I guess I hit a few home runs, and they 
said 'There goes the 'Say Hey Kid."[75] Years before he became the "Say 
Hey Kid", when he began his professional career with the Black Barons, 
Mays was called "Buck" by teammates and fans.[76] Some Giants players referred 
to him, their team captain, as "Cap." Italics denotes active player Italics
