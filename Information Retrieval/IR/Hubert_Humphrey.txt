Hubert Horatio Humphrey, Jr. (May 27, 1911 – January 13, 1978) was an American 
politician who served as the 38th Vice President of the United States under 
President Lyndon B. Johnson from 1965 to 1969. Humphrey twice served in 
the United States Senate, representing Minnesota from 1949 to 1964 and 
1971 to 1978. He was the nominee of the Democratic Party in the 1968 presidential 
election, losing to the Republican nominee Richard M. Nixon. Born in Wallace, 
South Dakota in 1911, Humphrey attended the University of Minnesota before 
earning his pharmacist license from the Capitol College of Pharmacy in 
1931. He helped run his father's pharmacy until 1937 when he returned to 
academia, graduating with a master's degree from Louisiana State University 
in 1940, where he was a political science instructor. He returned to Minnesota 
during World War II and became a supervisor for the Works Progress Administration. 
He was then appointed state director of the Minnesota war service program 
before becoming the assistant director of the War Manpower Commission. 
In 1943, Humphrey became a professor of Political Science at Macalester 
College and ran a failed campaign for mayor of Minneapolis. Humphrey helped 
found the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) in 1944, and in 
1945, became the DFL candidate for mayor of Minneapolis for a second time, 
winning with 61% of the vote. Humphrey served as mayor from 1945 to 1948, 
he was reelected and became the co-founder of the liberal anti-communist 
group Americans for Democratic Action in 1947. Humphrey was elected to 
the Senate in 1948, the year his proposal of ending racial segregation 
was included in the party platform at the Democratic National Convention, 
where he gave one of his most notable speeches on the convention floor, 
suggesting the Democratic Party "walk into the sunshine of human rights."[1] 
He served three terms in the Senate from 1949 to 1964 and was the Democratic 
Majority Whip from 1961 to 1964. During his tenure, Humphrey was the lead 
author of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, introduced the first initiative 
to create the Peace Corps, sponsored the clause of the McCarran Act to 
threaten concentration camps for 'subversives', proposed making Communist 
Party membership a felony and chaired the Select Committee on Disarmament. 
Humphrey ran for two failed Presidential campaigns in the 1952 and 1960 
Democratic primaries. After Lyndon B. Johnson inherited the presidency 
after John F. Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, he chose Humphrey 
to be his running mate in 1964 against Republican Barry Goldwater and the 
Democratic ticket was elected in a landslide in 1964. After Johnson made 
the surprise announcement that he would not seek reelection in March 1968, 
Humphrey launched his campaign for the presidency the following month. 
Humphrey's main Democratic challengers were anti-Vietnam War Senators Eugene 
McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy. Humphrey, who was loyal to the Johnson 
administration's policies on the Vietnam War as Vice President, saw opposition 
from many within his own party and avoided the primaries to focus on receiving 
the delegates of non-primary states at the Democratic Convention. Humphrey's 
delegate strategy succeeded in clinching the nomination, choosing Senator 
Edmund Muskie as his running mate. With the assassination of civil rights 
leader Martin Luther King Jr. and the assassination of Robert Kennedy that 
year, and heightened opposition to the Vietnam War, the convention saw 
major protests which later proved costly to Humphrey's campaign. On November 
5, 1968, Humphrey lost to former Vice President Richard Nixon in the general 
election. Humphrey then returned to teaching in Minnesota before returning 
to the Senate in 1971. He became the first Deputy President pro tempore 
of the United States Senate and served until his death in 1978. Humphrey 
died of bladder cancer at his home in Waverly, Minnesota, and is buried 
at the Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis. He was succeeded by his wife of 
forty-one years Muriel Humphrey as interim Senator for Minnesota. Humphrey 
was born in a room over his father's drugstore in Wallace, South Dakota.[2] 
He was the son of Ragnild Kristine Sannes (1883–1973), a Norwegian immigrant,[3] 
and Hubert Humphrey Sr. (1882–1949).[4] Humphrey spent most of his youth 
in Doland, South Dakota, on the Dakota prairie; the town's population was 
about 600 people when he lived there. His father was a licensed pharmacist 
who served as mayor and a town council member; he also served briefly in 
the South Dakota state legislature and was a South Dakota delegate to the 
1944 and 1948 Democratic National Conventions.[5] In the late 1920s, a 
severe economic downturn hit Doland; both of the town's banks closed and 
Humphrey's father struggled to keep his drugstore open.[6] After his son 
graduated from Doland's high school, Hubert Humphrey Sr. left Doland and 
opened a new drugstore in the larger town of Huron, South Dakota, (population 
11,000), where he hoped to improve his fortunes.[7] Because of the family's 
financial struggles, Humphrey had to leave the University of Minnesota 
after just one year.[8] He earned a pharmacist's license from the Capitol 
College of Pharmacy in Denver, Colorado (completing a two-year licensure 
program in just six months),[9] and spent the years from 1931 to 1937 helping 
his father run the family drugstore.[10] Both father and son were innovative 
businessmen in finding ways to attract customers to their drugstore: "to 
supplement their business, the Humphreys had become manufacturers...of 
patent medicines for both hogs and humans. A sign featuring a wooden pig 
was hung over the drugstore to tell the public about this unusual service. 
Farmers got the message, and it was Humphrey's that became known as the 
farmer's drugstore."[11] One biographer noted that "while Hubert Jr. minded 
the store and stirred the concoctions in the basement, Hubert Sr. went 
on the road selling "Humphrey's BTV" (Body Tone Veterinary), a mineral 
supplement and dewormer for hogs, and "Humphrey's Chest Oil" and "Humphrey's 
Sniffles" for two-legged sufferers."[12] Humphrey himself later wrote that 
"we made "Humphrey's Sniffles", a substitute for Vick's Nose Drops. I felt 
ours were better. Vick's used mineral oil, which is not absorbent, and 
we used a vegetable-oil base, which was. I added benzocaine, a local anesthetic, 
so that even if the sniffles didn't get better, you felt it less."[13] 
The various "Humphrey cures...worked well enough and constituted an important 
part of the family income...the farmers that bought the medicines were 
good customers."[14] Over time "Humphrey's Drug Store" became a profitable 
enterprise and the family again prospered.[15] Humphrey did not enjoy working 
as a pharmacist, and his dream remained to earn a doctorate in political 
science and become a college professor.[9] In August 1937, he told his 
father that he wanted to return to the University of Minnesota.[15] Hubert 
Sr. tried to convince his son not to leave by offering him a full partnership 
in the drugstore, but Hubert Jr. refused and told his father "how depressed 
I was, almost physically ill from the work, the dust storms, the conflict 
between my desire to do something and be somebody and my loyalty to him...he 
replied "Hubert, if you aren't happy, then you ought to do something about 
it."[16] In 1937 Humphrey returned to the University of Minnesota and earned 
a Bachelor of Arts in 1939.[17] He was a member of Phi Delta Chi Fraternity.[18] 
He also earned a master's degree from Louisiana State University in 1940, 
serving as an assistant instructor of political science there.[19] One 
of his classmates was Russell B. Long, a future U.S. Senator from Louisiana. 
He then became an instructor and doctoral student at the University of 
Minnesota from 1940 to 1941 (joining the American Federation of Teachers), 
and was a supervisor for the Works Progress Administration (WPA).[20] Humphrey 
was a star debater on the University of Minnesota's debate team; one of 
his debate teammates was future Minnesota Governor and US Secretary of 
Agriculture Orville Freeman.[21] In the 1940 presidential campaign Humphrey 
and future University of Minnesota president Malcolm Moos debated the merits 
of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic candidate, and Wendell Willkie, 
the Republican candidate, on a Minneapolis radio station. Humphrey supported 
Roosevelt.[22] Humphrey soon became active in Minneapolis politics, and 
as a result he never finished his PhD.[23] In 1934 Hubert began dating 
Muriel Buck, a bookkeeper and graduate of local Huron College.[24] They 
were married in 1936 and remained married until Humphrey's death, nearly 
42 years later.[25] They had four children: Hubert Humphrey III, Nancy, 
Robert, and Douglas.[26] Unlike many prominent politicians, Humphrey never 
became a millionaire; one biographer noted, "For much of his life he was 
short of money to live on, and his relentless drive to attain the White 
House seemed at times like one long, losing struggle to raise enough campaign 
funds to get there."[27] To help boost his salary, Humphrey frequently 
took paid outside speaking engagements. Through most of his years as a 
US senator and Vice-President, he lived in a middle-class housing development 
in Chevy Chase, Maryland. In 1958, Hubert and Muriel used their savings 
and his speaking fees to build a lakefront home in Waverly, Minnesota, 
about 40 miles west of Minneapolis.[28] During the Second World War Humphrey 
tried three times to join the armed forces but failed.[29] His first two 
attempts were to join the Navy, first as a commissioned officer and then 
as an enlisted man. He was rejected by the Navy both times for blindness.[30] 
He then tried to enlist in the Army in December 1944 but failed the physical 
exam because of a double hernia, color blindness, and calcification of 
the lungs.[30] Despite his attempts to join the military, one biographer 
would note that "all through his political life, Humphrey was dogged by 
the charge that he was a draft dodger" during the war.[31] Humphrey instead 
led various wartime government agencies and worked as a college instructor. 
In 1942, he was the state director of new production training and reemployment 
and chief of the Minnesota war service program.[32] In 1943 he was the 
assistant director of the War Manpower Commission.[17] From 1943 to 1944, 
Humphrey was a professor of political science at Macalester College in 
Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he headed the university's recently created 
international debate department; a department focusing on the international 
politics of World War II and the creation of the United Nations.[33] After 
leaving Macalester in the spring of 1944, Humphrey worked as a news commentator 
for a Minneapolis radio station until 1945.[17] In 1943, Humphrey made 
his first run for elective office, for Mayor of Minneapolis. Although he 
lost, his poorly funded campaign still captured over 47% of the vote.[20] 
In 1944, Humphrey was one of the key players in the merger of the Democratic 
and Farmer-Labor parties of Minnesota to form the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor 
Party (DFL).[34] The same year, he worked on incumbent President Franklin 
Roosevelt's reelection campaign in the 1944 presidential election.[35] 
When in 1945, Minnesota Communists tried to seize control of the new party, 
Humphrey became an engaged anticommunist and led the successful fight to 
oust the Communists from the DFL.[36] After the war, he again ran for mayor 
of Minneapolis; this time, he won the election with 61% of the vote.[20] 
He served as mayor from 1945 to 1948.[37] He was re-elected in 1947 by 
the largest margin in the city's history to that time. Humphrey gained 
national fame by becoming one of the founders of the liberal anticommunist 
Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), and he served as chairman from 1949 
to 1950,[38] He also reformed the Minneapolis police force.[39] The city 
had been named the "anti-Semitism capital" of the country,[40] and the 
small African-American population of the city also faced discrimination. 
Humphrey's tenure as mayor is noted for his efforts to fight all forms 
of bigotry.[41] The Democratic Party of 1948 was split between those, mainly 
Northerners, who thought the federal government should actively protect 
civil rights for racial minorities, and those, mainly Southerners, who 
believed that states should be able to enforce traditional racial segregation 
within their borders.[42] At the 1948 Democratic National Convention, the 
party platform reflected the division by containing only platitudes in 
favor of civil rights.[43] The incumbent president, Harry S Truman, had 
shelved most of the recommendations of his 1946 Commission on Civil Rights, 
for fear of angering Southern Democrats.[44] Humphrey, however, had written 
in The Progressive magazine, "The Democratic Party must lead the fight 
for every principle in the report. It is all or nothing."[42] A diverse 
coalition opposed the convention's tepid civil rights platform, including 
anticommunist liberals like Humphrey, Paul Douglas and John F. Shelley, 
all of whom would later become known as leading progressives in the Democratic 
Party. They proposed adding a "minority plank" to the party platform that 
would commit the Democratic Party to a more aggressive opposition to racial 
segregation.[45] The minority plank called for federal legislation against 
lynching, an end to legalized school segregation in the South, and ending 
job discrimination based on skin color.[19] Also strongly backing the liberal 
civil rights plank were Democratic urban bosses like Ed Flynn of the Bronx, 
who promised the votes of northeastern delegates to Humphrey's platform, 
Jacob Arvey of Chicago, and David Lawrence of Pittsburgh. Although viewed 
as being conservatives, the urban bosses believed that Northern Democrats 
could gain many black votes by supporting civil rights, with losses from 
Southern Democrats being relatively small.[46] Though many scholars[who?] 
have suggested that labor unions were leading figures in this alition, 
no significant labor leaders attended the convention, with the exception 
of the heads of the Congress of Industrial Organizations Political Action 
Committee (CIOPAC), Jack Kroll and A.F. Whitney.[47] Despite aggressive 
pressure by Truman's aides to avoid forcing the issue on the Convention 
floor, Humphrey chose to speak on behalf of the minority plank.[19] In 
a renowned speech,[48] Humphrey passionately told the Convention, "To those 
who say, my friends, to those who say, that we are rushing this issue of 
civil rights, I say to them we are 172 years (too) late! To those who say, 
this civil rights program is an infringement on states' rights, I say this: 
the time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of 
the shadow of states' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine 
of human rights!"[49] Humphrey and his allies succeeded; the convention 
adopted the pro-civil-rights plank by a vote of 651½ to 582½.[50] As a 
result of the Convention's vote, the Mississippi delegation and half of 
the Alabama delegation walked out of the hall.[1] Many Southern Democrats 
were so enraged at this affront to their "way of life" that they formed 
the Dixiecrat party[51] and nominated their own presidential candidate, 
Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.[52] The goal of the Dixiecrats 
was to take Southern states away from Truman and thus cause his defeat.[53] 
The Southern Democrats reasoned that after such a defeat, the national 
Democratic Party would never again aggressively pursue a pro-civil rights 
agenda. However, the move backfired. Although the strong civil rights plank 
adopted at the Convention cost Truman the support of the Dixiecrats, it 
gained him many votes from blacks, especially in large northern cities. 
As a result, Truman won a stunning upset victory over his Republican opponent, 
Thomas E. Dewey.[54] Truman's victory demonstrated that the Democratic 
Party could win presidential elections without the "Solid South" and it 
weakened Southern Democrats instead of strengthening them. Pulitzer Prize-winning 
historian David McCullough has written that Humphrey probably did more 
to get Truman elected in 1948 than anyone other than Truman himself.[55] 
Minnesota elected Humphrey to the United States Senate in 1948 on the DFL 
ticket, defeating James M. Shields in the primary for the DFL nomination 
with 89% of the vote,[56] and unseating incumbent Republican Joseph H. 
Ball with 60% of the vote in the general election.[57] He took office on 
January 3, 1949, becoming the first Democrat elected senator from the state 
of Minnesota since before the Civil War.[58] Humphrey's father died that 
year, and Humphrey stopped using the "Jr." suffix on his name. He was re-elected 
in 1954 and 1960.[37] His colleagues selected him as majority whip in 1961, 
a position he held until he left the Senate on December 29, 1964, to assume 
the vice presidency.[59] During this period, he served in the 81st, 82nd, 
83rd, 84th, 85th, 86th, 87th, and a portion of the 88th Congress. Initially, 
Humphrey's support of civil rights led to his being ostracized by Southern 
Democrats, who dominated most of the Senate leadership positions and who 
wanted to punish Humphrey for proposing the successful civil rights platform 
at the 1948 Convention. Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia, a leader 
of Southern Democrats, once remarked to other Senators as Humphrey walked 
by, "Can you imagine the people of Minnesota sending that damn fool down 
here to represent them?"[60] However, Humphrey refused to be intimidated 
and stood his ground; his integrity, passion and eloquence eventually earned 
him the respect of even most of the Southerners.[61] His acceptance by 
the Southerners was also helped a great deal when Humphrey became a protégé 
of Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas.[19] Humphrey became 
known for his advocacy of liberal causes (such as civil rights, arms control, 
a nuclear test ban, food stamps, and humanitarian foreign aid), and for 
his long and witty speeches.[62] During the period of McCarthyism (1950–1954), 
Humphrey was accused of being "soft on communism", despite having been 
one of the founders of the anti-communist liberal organization Americans 
for Democratic Action, having been a staunch supporter of the Truman Administration's 
efforts to combat the growth of the Soviet Union, and having fought Communist 
political activities in Minnesota and elsewhere. In addition, Humphrey 
"was a sponsor of the clause in the McCarran Act of 1950 threatening concentration 
camps for 'subversives'",[63] and in 1954 proposed to make mere membership 
in the Communist Party a felony – a proposal that failed.[64] He was chairman 
of the Select Committee on Disarmament (84th and 85th Congresses).[65] 
Although "Humphrey was an enthusiastic supporter of every U.S. war from 
1938 to 1978",[66] in February 1960, he introduced a bill to establish 
a National Peace Agency.[67] With another former pharmacist, Representative 
Carl Durham, Humphrey cosponsored the Durham-Humphrey Amendment , which 
amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, defining two specific 
categories for medications, legend (prescription) and over-the-counter 
(OTC).[68] As Democratic whip in the Senate in 1964, Humphrey was instrumental 
in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of that year. He was a lead author 
of the text of the civil rights act, alongside Republican Senate Republican 
Minority Leader Everett Dirksen of Illinois.[69] Humphrey's consistently 
cheerful and upbeat demeanor, and his forceful advocacy of liberal causes, 
led him to be nicknamed "The Happy Warrior" by many of his Senate colleagues 
and political journalists.[70] While President John F. Kennedy is often 
credited for creating the Peace Corps, the first initiative came from Humphrey 
when he introduced the first bill to create the Peace Corps in 1957—three 
years prior to JFK and his University of Michigan speech.[71] In his autobiography, 
The Education of a Public Man, Humphrey wrote:[72] There were three bills 
of particular emotional importance to me: the Peace Corps, a disarmament 
agency, and the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The President, knowing how I felt, 
asked me to introduce legislation for all three. I introduced the first 
Peace Corps bill in 1957. It did not meet with much enthusiasm. Some traditional 
diplomats quaked at the thought of thousands of young Americans scattered 
across their world. Many senators, including liberal ones, thought the 
idea was silly and unworkable. Now, with a young president urging its passage, 
it became possible and we pushed it rapidly through the Senate. It is fashionable 
now to suggest that Peace Corps Volunteers gained as much or more, from 
their experience as the countries they worked. That may be true, but it 
ought not demean their work. They touched many lives and made them better. 
Humphrey ran for the Democratic presidential nomination twice before his 
election to the Vice Presidency in 1964. The first time was as Minnesota's 
favorite son in 1952, where he received only 26 votes on the first ballot;[73] 
the second time was in 1960. In between these two presidential bids, Senator 
Humphrey was part of the free-for-all for the vice-presidential nomination 
at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, where he received 134 votes 
on the first ballot and 74 on the second.[74] In 1960, Humphrey ran again 
for the Democratic presidential nomination against fellow Senator John 
F. Kennedy in the primaries. Their first meeting was in the Wisconsin Primary, 
where Kennedy's well-organized and well-funded campaign overcame Humphrey's 
energetic but poorly funded effort.[75] Kennedy's attractive brothers, 
sisters, and wife Jacqueline combed the state looking for votes. At one 
point Humphrey memorably complained that he "felt like an independent merchant 
competing against a chain store".[76] Humphrey later wrote in his memoirs 
that "Muriel and I and our 'plain folks' entourage were no match for the 
glamour of Jackie Kennedy and the other Kennedy women, for Peter Lawford...and 
Frank Sinatra singing their commercial 'High Hopes'. Jack Kennedy brought 
family and Hollywood to Wisconsin. The people loved it and the press ate 
it up."[77] Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary, but by a smaller margin 
than anticipated; some commentators argued that Kennedy's victory margin 
had come almost entirely from areas that were heavily Roman Catholic,[78] 
and that Protestants actually supported Humphrey. As a result, Humphrey 
refused to quit the race and decided to run against Kennedy again in the 
West Virginia primary. According to one biographer "Humphrey thought his 
chances were good in West Virginia, one of the few states that had backed 
him in his losing race for vice-president four years earlier...West Virginia 
was more rural than urban, [which] seemed to invite Humphrey's folksy stump 
style. The state, moreover, was a citadel of labor. It was depressed; unemployment 
had hit hard; and coal miners' families were hungry. Humphrey felt he could 
talk to such people, who were 95% Protestant (Humphrey was a Congregationalist)[79] 
and deep-dyed Bible-belters besides."[80] Kennedy chose to meet the religion 
issue head-on. In radio broadcasts, he carefully repositioned the issue 
from one of Catholic versus Protestant to tolerance versus intolerance. 
Kennedy's appeal placed Humphrey, who had championed tolerance his entire 
career, on the defensive, and Kennedy attacked him with a vengeance. Franklin 
D. Roosevelt Jr., the son of the former president, stumped for Kennedy 
in West Virginia and raised the issue of Humphrey's failure to serve in 
the armed forces in World War II. Roosevelt told audiences "I don't know 
where he [Humphrey] was in World War Two," and handed out flyers charging 
that Humphrey was a draft dodger.[81] Historian Robert Dallek has written 
that Robert F. Kennedy, who was serving as his brother's campaign manager, 
came into "possession of information that Humphrey may have sought military 
deferments during World War Two ... he pressed Roosevelt to use this."[82] 
Humphrey believed Roosevelt's draft-dodger claim "had been approved by 
Bobby [Kennedy], if not Jack".[82] However, Dallek has written that the 
claims that Humphrey was a draft dodger were inaccurate, because during 
the war Humphrey had "tried and failed to get into the [military] service 
because of physical disabilities".[82] After the West Virginia primary, 
Roosevelt sent Humphrey a written apology and retraction.[81] According 
to historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Roosevelt "felt that he had been 
used, blaming [the draft-dodger charge] on Robert Kennedy's determination 
to win at any cost...Roosevelt said later that it was the biggest political 
mistake of his career."[83] Humphrey, who was short on funds, could not 
match the well-financed Kennedy operation. Humphrey traveled around the 
state in a rented bus, while Kennedy and his staff flew around West Virginia 
in a large, family-owned airplane.[84] According to Carl Solberg, his biographer, 
Humphrey spent only $23,000 on the West Virginia primary, while Kennedy's 
campaign privately spent some $1.5 million, well over their official estimate 
of $100,000.[85] There were accusations that the Kennedys bought the West 
Virginia primary by paying bribes to county sheriffs and other local officials 
to give Kennedy the vote; however, these accusations were never proven.[86] 
Humphrey later wrote that "as a professional politician I was able to accept 
and indeed respect the efficacy of the Kennedy campaign. But underneath 
the beautiful exterior, there was an element of ruthlessness and toughness 
that I had trouble either accepting or forgetting."[87] Kennedy defeated 
Humphrey soundly in West Virginia, winning 60.8% of the vote.[88] That 
evening, Humphrey announced that he was no longer a presidential candidate.[89] 
By winning the West Virginia primary, Kennedy was able to overcome the 
belief that Protestant voters would not elect a Catholic candidate to the 
Presidency and thus sewed up the Democratic nomination for President.[90] 
Humphrey did win the South Dakota and District of Columbia primaries, which 
JFK did not enter.[91] At the 1960 Democratic National Convention, he received 
41 votes even though he was no longer an active presidential candidate. 
Humphrey's defeat in 1960 had a profound influence on his thinking; after 
the primaries he told friends that, as a relatively poor man in politics, 
he was unlikely to ever become President unless he served as Vice-President 
first.[92] Humphrey believed that only in this way could he raise the funds 
and nationwide organization and visibility he would need to win the Democratic 
nomination. As such, as the 1964 presidential campaign began Humphrey made 
clear his interest in becoming President Lyndon Johnson's running mate. 
At the 1964 Democratic National Convention, Johnson kept the three likely 
vice presidential candidates, Connecticut Senator Thomas Dodd, fellow Minnesota 
Senator Eugene McCarthy, and Humphrey,[93] as well as the rest of the nation 
in suspense before announcing Humphrey as his running-mate with much fanfare, 
praising Humphrey's qualifications for a considerable amount of time before 
announcing his name.[94] The following day Humphrey's acceptance speech 
overshadowed Johnson's own acceptance address: Hubert warmed up with a 
long tribute to the President, then hit his stride as he began a rhythmic 
jabbing and chopping at Barry Goldwater. "Most Democrats and Republicans 
in the Senate voted for an $11.5 billion tax cut for American citizens 
and American business," he cried, "but not Senator Goldwater. Most Democrats 
and Republicans in the Senate – in fact four-fifths of the members of his 
own party – voted for the Civil Rights Act, but not Senator Goldwater." 
In 1964, the Johnson/Humphrey ticket won overwhelmingly, garnering 486 
electoral votes out of 538.[96] Only five Southern states and Goldwater's 
home state of Arizona supported the Republican ticket.[97] Humphrey took 
office on January 20, 1965,[98] ending the 14-month vacancy of the Vice 
President of the United States, which had remained empty when then-Vice 
President Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the Presidency after the assassination 
of John F. Kennedy.[99] He was an early skeptic of the then growing conflict 
in Vietnam. Following a successful Viet Cong hit-and-run attack on a US 
military installation at Pleiku on February 7, 1965 (where 7 Americans 
were killed and 109 wounded), Humphrey returned from Georgia to Washington 
D.C., to attempt to prevent further escalation.[100] He told President 
Johnson that bombing North Vietnam was not a solution to the problems in 
South Vietnam, but that bombing would require the injection of US ground 
forces into South Vietnam to protect the airbases.[100] Presciently, he 
noted that a military solution in Vietnam would take years, well beyond 
the next election cycle. In response to his advice, President Johnson punished 
Humphrey with coldness and a restriction from his inner circle for a number 
of months, until Humphrey decided to "get back on the team" and fully support 
the war effort.[100] As Vice President, Humphrey was controversial for 
his complete and vocal loyalty to Johnson and the policies of the Johnson 
Administration, even as many of his liberal admirers opposed Johnson's 
policies with increasing fervor regarding the Vietnam War.[17] Many of 
Humphrey's liberal friends and allies abandoned him because of his refusal 
to publicly criticize Johnson's Vietnam War policies. Humphrey's critics 
later learned that Johnson had threatened Humphrey – Johnson told Humphrey 
that if he publicly criticized his policy, he would destroy Humphrey's 
chances to become President by opposing his nomination at the next Democratic 
Convention.[101] However, Humphrey's critics were vocal and persistent: 
even his nickname, "the Happy Warrior", was used against him. The nickname 
referred not to his military hawkishness, but rather to his crusading for 
social welfare and civil rights programs.[17] After his narrow defeat in 
the 1968 presidential election, Humphrey wrote that "After four years as 
Vice-President ... I had lost some of my personal identity and personal 
forcefulness. ... I ought not to have let a man [Johnson] who was going 
to be a former President dictate my future."[102] While he was Vice President, 
Hubert Humphrey was the subject of a satirical song by songwriter/musician 
Tom Lehrer entitled "Whatever Became of Hubert?" The song addressed how 
some liberals and progressives felt let down by Humphrey, who had become 
a much more mute figure as Vice President than he had been as a senator. 
The song goes "Whatever became of Hubert? Has anyone heard a thing? Once 
he shone on his own, now he sits home alone and waits for the phone to 
ring. Once a fiery liberal spirit, ah, but now when he speaks he must clear 
it. ..." During these years Humphrey was a repeated and favorite guest 
of Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show.[103][104] He also struck up a friendship 
with Frank Sinatra, who supported his campaign for president in 1968 before 
his conversion to the Republican party in the early 1970s,[105] and was 
perhaps most on notice in the fall of 1977 when Sinatra was the star attraction 
and host of a tribute to a then-ailing Humphrey. He also appeared on The 
Dean Martin Celebrity Roast in 1973. As 1968 began, it looked as if President 
Johnson, despite the rapidly decreasing approval rating of his Vietnam 
War policies, would easily win the Democratic nomination for a second time.[106] 
Humphrey was widely expected to remain Johnson's running mate for reelection 
in 1968.[107] Johnson was challenged by Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, 
who ran on an anti-Vietnam War platform.[108] With the backing of out-of-state 
anti-war college students and activists while campaigning in the New Hampshire 
primary, McCarthy, who was not expected to be a serious contender for the 
Democratic nomination, nearly defeated Johnson, finishing with a surprising 
42% of the vote to Johnson's 49%.[109] A few days after the New Hampshire 
primary, after months of contemplation and originally intending to support 
Johnson's bid for reelection, Senator Robert Kennedy of New York also entered 
the race on an anti-war platform.[110] On March 31, 1968, a week before 
the Wisconsin primary, where polls showed a strong standing for McCarthy, 
President Johnson stunned the nation by withdrawing from his race for a 
second full term.[111] Following the announcement from Johnson, Humphrey 
announced his presidential candidacy on April 27, 1968.[112] Declaring 
his candidacy in a speech in Washington, D.C. alongside Senators Fred Harris 
of Oklahoma and Walter Mondale of Minnesota (who both served as the co-chairs 
to his campaign), Humphrey stated: Here we are, just as we ought to be, 
here we are, the people, here we are the spirit of dedication, here we 
are the way politics ought to be in America, the politics of happiness, 
politics of purpose, politics of joy; and that's the way it's going to 
be, all the way, too, from here on out. We seek an America able to preserve 
and nurture all the basic rights of free expression, yet able to reach 
across the divisions that too often separate race from race, region from 
region, young from old, worker from scholar, rich from poor. We seek an 
America able to do this in the higher knowledge that our goals and ideals 
are worthy of conciliation and personal sacrifice.[113] Also in his speech, 
Humphrey supported President Johnson's Vietnam initiative he proposed during 
his address to the nation four weeks earlier;[113] partially halting the 
bombings in North Vietnam, while sending an additional 13,500 troops and 
increasing the Department of Defense's budget by 4% over the next fiscal 
year.[114] Later in the campaign, Humphrey opposed a proposal by Senators 
McCarthy and George McGovern of South Dakota to the Democratic Convention's 
Policy Committee, calling for an immediate end to the bombings in Vietnam, 
an early withdrawal of troops and setting talks for a coalition government 
with the Viet Cong.[115] Many people saw Humphrey as Johnson's stand-in; 
he won major backing from the nation's labor unions and other Democratic 
groups that were troubled by young antiwar protesters and the social unrest 
around the nation.[116] Humphrey entered the race too late to participate 
in the Democratic primaries[117] and concentrated on winning delegates 
in non-primary states by gaining the support from Democratic officeholders 
who were elected delegates for the Democratic Convention.[116] By June, 
McCarthy won in Oregon and Pennsylvania, while Kennedy had won in Indiana 
and Nebraska, though Humphrey was the front runner as he led the delegate 
count.[116][118] The California primary was crucial for Kennedy's campaign, 
as a McCarthy victory would've prevented Kennedy from reaching the amount 
of delegates required to secure the nomination.[118] On June 4, 1968, Kennedy 
defeated McCarthy by less than 4% in the California primary.[119] But the 
nation was shocked yet again when Senator Kennedy was assassinated after 
his victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.[120] 
After the assassination of Kennedy, Humphrey suspended his campaign for 
two weeks.[121] Humphrey and his running mate, Ed Muskie, went on to easily 
win the Democratic nomination at the party convention in Chicago, Illinois. 
Unfortunately for Humphrey and his campaign, in Grant Park and at other 
sites near downtown Chicago, well away from the convention hall, there 
were gatherings and protests by thousands of antiwar demonstrators, many 
of whom favored McCarthy, George McGovern, or other "anti-war" candidates. 
These protesters – most of them young college students – were attacked 
and beaten on live television by Chicago police, actions which merely amplified 
the growing feelings of unrest in the general public. Humphrey's inaction 
during these activities, as well as public backlash from securing the presidential 
nomination without entering a single primary, highlighted turmoil in the 
Democratic party's base that proved to be too much for Humphrey to overcome 
in time for the general election. The combination of the unpopularity of 
Johnson, the Chicago demonstrations, and the discouragement of liberals 
and African-Americans when both Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King 
Jr. were assassinated during the election year, were all contributing factors 
that caused him to eventually lose the election to former Vice President 
Nixon. Although he lost the election by less than 1% of the popular vote, 
43.4% for Nixon (31,783,783 votes) to 42.7% (31,271,839 votes) for Humphrey, 
with 13.5% (9,901,118 votes) for George Wallace, Humphrey carried just 
13 states with 191 electoral college votes. Richard Nixon carried 32 states 
and 301 electoral votes, and Wallace carried 5 states in the South and 
46 electoral votes (270 were needed to win). In his concession speech, 
Humphrey said: "I have done my best. I have lost, Mr. Nixon has won. The 
democratic process has worked its will."[122] After leaving the Vice Presidency, 
Humphrey taught at Macalester College and the University of Minnesota, 
and served as chairman of board of consultants at the Encyclopædia Britannica 
Educational Corporation. Initially he had not planned to return to political 
life, but an unexpected opportunity changed his mind. McCarthy, who was 
up for re-election in 1970, realized that he had only a slim chance of 
winning even re-nomination (he had angered his party by opposing Johnson 
and Humphrey for the 1968 presidential nomination) and declined to run. 
Humphrey won the nomination, defeated Republican Congressman Clark MacGregor, 
and returned to the U.S. Senate on January 3, 1971. He was re-elected in 
1976, and remained in office until his death. In a rarity in politics, 
Humphrey held both Senate seats from his state (Class I and Class II) at 
different times. During his return to the Senate he served in the 92nd, 
93rd, 94th, and a portion of the 95th Congress. He served as chairman of 
the Joint Economic Committee in the 94th Congress. In 1972, Humphrey once 
again ran for the Democratic nomination for president. He drew upon continuing 
support from organized labor and the African-American and Jewish communities, 
but remained unpopular with college students because of his association 
with the Vietnam War, even though he had altered his position in the years 
since his 1968 defeat. Humphrey initially planned to skip the primaries, 
as he had in 1968. Even after he revised this strategy he still stayed 
out of New Hampshire, a decision that allowed McGovern to emerge as the 
leading challenger to Muskie in that state. Humphrey did win some primaries, 
including those in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, but was defeated by 
McGovern in several others, including the crucial California primary. Humphrey 
also was out-organized by McGovern in caucus states and was trailing in 
delegates at the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. 
His hopes rested on challenges to the credentials of some of the McGovern 
delegates. For example, the Humphrey forces argued that the winner-take-all 
rule for the California primary violated procedural reforms intended to 
produce a better reflection of the popular vote, the reason that the Illinois 
delegation was bounced. The effort failed, as several votes on delegate 
credentials went McGovern's way, guaranteeing his victory. Humphrey also 
briefly considered mounting a campaign for the Democratic nomination from 
the Convention once again in 1976, when the primaries seemed likely to 
result in a deadlock, but ultimately decided against it. At the conclusion 
of the Democratic primary process that year, even with Jimmy Carter having 
the requisite number of delegates needed to secure his nomination, many 
still wanted Humphrey to announce his availability for a draft. However, 
he did not do so, and Carter easily secured the nomination on the first 
round of balloting. Humphrey had learned that he had terminal cancer, prompting 
him to sit the race out. In 1974, along with Rep. Augustus Hawkins of California, 
Humphrey authored the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, the first attempt 
at full employment legislation. The original bill proposed to guarantee 
full employment to all citizens over 16 and set up a permanent system of 
public jobs to meet that goal. A watered-down version called the Full Employment 
and Balanced Growth Act passed the House and Senate in 1978. It set the 
goal of 4 percent unemployment and 3 percent inflation and instructed the 
Federal Reserve Board to try to produce those goals when making policy 
decisions. Humphrey ran for Majority Leader after the 1976 election but 
lost to Robert Byrd of West Virginia. The Senate honored Humphrey by creating 
the post of Deputy President pro tempore of the Senate for him. On August 
16, 1977, Humphrey revealed he was suffering from terminal bladder cancer. 
On October 25 of that year, he addressed the Senate, and on November 3, 
Humphrey became the first person other than a member of the House or the 
President of the United States to address the House of Representatives 
in session.[123] President Carter honored him by giving him command of 
Air Force One for his final trip to Washington on October 23. One of Humphrey's 
speeches contained the lines "It was once said that the moral test of Government 
is how that Government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; 
those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in 
the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped", which is 
sometimes described as the "liberals' mantra". Humphrey spent his last 
weeks calling old political acquaintances. One call was to Richard Nixon 
inviting him to his upcoming funeral, which he accepted. Staying in the 
hospital, Humphrey went from room to room, cheering up other patients by 
telling them jokes and listening to them. He died on January 13, 1978 of 
bladder cancer at his home in Waverly, Minnesota. His body lay in state 
in the rotunda of both the United States Capitol and the Minnesota State 
Capitol, and was interred in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis. Humphery's 
passing overshadowed the death of his colleague from Montana, Senator Lee 
Metcalf with Metcalf's death occurring one day prior to Humphery's. Old 
friends and opponents of Humphrey, from Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon to 
President Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale paid their final respects. 
"He taught us how to live, and finally he taught us how to die", said Mondale.[124] 
His wife, Muriel Humphrey, was appointed by Minnesota's governor Rudy Perpich 
to serve in the US Senate until a special election to fill the term was 
held. She did not seek election to finish her husband's term in office. 
Muriel Humphrey remarried in 1981 (to Max Brown) and took the name Muriel 
Humphrey Brown.[125] She died in 1998 at the age of 86 and is interred 
next to Hubert Humphrey.[26] In 1965, Humphrey was made an Honorary Life 
Member of Alpha Phi Alpha, a historically African American fraternity.[126] 
In 1978, Humphrey received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest 
Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out 
annually by Jefferson Awards.[127] He was awarded posthumously the Congressional 
Gold Medal on June 13, 1979 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1980. 
He was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 52¢ Great Americans 
series (1980–2000) postage stamp.[128] There is a statue of him in front
