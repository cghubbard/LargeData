The 1981 Chicago White Sox season was the White Sox's 81st season in the 
major leagues, and their 82nd season overall. They finished with a record 
54-52, good enough for 3rd place in the American League West, 8.5 games 
behind the 1st place Oakland Athletics. However, due to a player's strike, 
the Athletics would play the 50-53 Kansas City Royals, who had finished 
behind the White Sox. Owner Bill Veeck attempted to sell the club to Ed 
DeBartolo, but the offer was turned down by the other owners.[1] Veeck 
was then forced to sell to a different investment group headed by Jerry 
Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn.[1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
