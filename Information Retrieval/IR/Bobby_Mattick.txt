As player As manager Robert James Mattick (December 5, 1915 – December 
16, 2004) was a shortstop, manager and scout in Major League Baseball, 
most notably in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. Born in Sioux City, 
Iowa, Mattick was the son of outfielder Wally Mattick, who played for the 
Chicago White Sox in 1912 and 1913 and the St. Louis Cardinals in 1918. 
Bobby played only one season as a regular with the Chicago Cubs in 1940, 
although he played for the Cubs from 1938 to 1940 and the Cincinnati Reds 
in 1941 and 1942. Hampered in 1936 by a foul ball which cracked his skull 
above his right eye and caused double vision, he was a career .233 hitter 
with no home runs and 64 RBIs in 206 games. Mattick began his managerial 
career in the Southern League in 1944 and 1945. From 1946 to 1978, Mattick 
worked for nine different baseball organizations including as a scout for 
the Reds, Houston Astros, Milwaukee Brewers and Montreal Expos. He was 
credited by some baseball personnel as an incomparable longtime scout and 
player development specialist, signing such stars as Frank Robinson, Vada 
Pinson, Curt Flood, Rusty Staub, Don Baylor, and Gary Carter. One of the 
Blue Jays' original employees in its inaugural season, Bobby first joined 
the team in 1976 as the scouting supervisor, and helped draft the expansion 
Blue Jays. In 1978 Mattick was appointed the director of player development. 
1980 saw him take over the role of manager from Roy Hartsfield, the Blue 
Jays' original manager, becoming the oldest rookie manager to start a season 
at 64. Mattick turned down the job several times before finally accepting; 
he had initially wanted to manage the team only if he could wear his regular 
business clothing while in the dugout, rather than a uniform. This would 
have made him the first manager to not wear a uniform since Connie Mack 
retired in the early 1950s, but the Blue Jays insisted that Mattick wear 
a uniform. The Blue Jays had their best season of their young existence 
in 1980, missing the 100-loss mark for the first time and finishing at 
67-95. The 1981 season was interrupted by a player strike, and the Blue 
Jays improved their winning percentage in 1981 but still finished in last 
place in the American League East Division in both halves of the season. 
Mattick was offered the opportunity to continue managing the Blue Jays 
for a third season, but elected to step down. Following the 1981 season 
and a 104–164 career record during his two-year tenure as manager, Mattick 
continued to work in the organization as executive co-ordinator of baseball 
operations before his promotion to vice president of baseball in 1984. 
Mattick played a key administrative role in scouting and development, leading 
to the Blue Jays' five AL East Division championships, and World Series 
crowns in 1992 and 1993. Mattick was inducted into the Canadian Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1999, and the club renamed its spring training complex 
The Bobby Mattick Training Center in 2007. He was part of the Blue Jays' 
delegation at the 2004 Major League Baseball winter meetings in Anaheim, 
California. According to the information from the Blue Jays,[1] Mattick 
died 11 days after his 89th birthday after suffering a stroke at his Scottsdale, 
Arizona home. Mattick's wife Jackie died about two years previously. They
