Red, black, white                The Boston Reds were a 19th-century baseball 
team located in Boston, Massachusetts that played in the Players' League 
in 1890 and in the American Association in 1891. They played in the Congress 
Street Grounds in the 1890s.[1] The team took its name from the successful 
Boston club of the National Association and National League formerly known 
as the (Boston) Red Stockings, who had changed their name to the Beaneaters 
in 1883. The club lasted only two seasons, but in those two seasons they 
were league champions. In 1890 the Reds won the Players' League pennant 
when they finished first ahead of the New York Giants, and then won the 
American Association pennant when they finished first ahead of the St. 
Louis Browns (now the Cardinals). The Boston Reds are one of two major 
league teams to win back-to-back pennants spanning two different leagues. 
The Brooklyn Dodgers did it also, winning the AA pennant in 1889 and the 
NL pennant in 1890. At the conclusion of the 1891 season, the National 
League pressed for the consolidation of the American Association with the 
National League. Part of the posturing included the National League directing 
its champion Boston Beaneaters not to play the Reds in a World Series. 
The leagues settled, adding four AA clubs to a combined circuit. As part 
of the settlement, the owners of the four clubs not joining the combined 
circuit, including the Reds, were paid $135,000 and their players dispersed 
to the surviving clubs. Their abandoned ballpark was revived for use by 
the National League club in 1894, during the weeks that South End Grounds 
was being rebuilt following a fire. The Congress Street Grounds, with its 
close left field foul line, quickly gained some more history, as Bobby 
Lowe hit four home runs in one game there, the first player to accomplish
