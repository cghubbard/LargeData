Edward Nelson Sprague, Jr. (born July 25, 1967) is a former Major League 
Baseball third baseman. He played 11 seasons in the major leagues from 
1991 to 2001, with six different teams. He later served as the head baseball 
coach of the NCAA's Pacific Tigers for 12 seasons, from 2004 to 2015.[1] 
Sprague was an NCAA standout where he played third base helping Stanford 
win College World Series championships in 1987 and 1988. He then collected 
an Olympic Gold Medal in the 1988 Olympics on the men's baseball team. 
(However, because baseball was a demonstration sport that year, the medals 
were unofficial and did not count towards respective countries' medal counts.) 
He is a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.[2] Sprague 
was drafted in the first round of the 1988 Major League Baseball draft 
by the Toronto Blue Jays. Sprague made his debut in 1991 for the Toronto 
Blue Jays and was a part of the 1992 and 1993 World Series championships. 
He is particularly remembered for hitting the game-winning home run in 
the ninth inning of Game 2 of the 1992 Series against the Atlanta Braves. 
His best individual year came in 1996 when he hit .247 with 36 home runs 
and 101 runs batted in. Sprague was a regular with Toronto until 1998, 
when he was traded to the Oakland Athletics. He was granted free agency 
at the end of 1998, and then played for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1999, 
for which he made his only All-Star game appearance. That year, he hit 
.267 with 22 homers, 81 RBI and a .352 on-base percentage, the best of 
his career as a regular player. In 2000, Sprague played for the San Diego 
Padres and Boston Red Sox. After becoming a free agent at the end of the 
year, he signed with the Seattle Mariners for the 2001 season, playing 
in 45 regular season games. He signed a minor league contract with the 
Texas Rangers in early 2002, but did not return to the major leagues. Sprague 
twice led the league in getting hit by pitches and finished with a career 
total of 91. Sprague is the only baseball player ever to win championships 
in the College World Series, the Olympics, and the World Series.[3] Sprague's 
final career totals include 1203 games played, 506 runs, 1010 hits, 225 
doubles, 12 triples, 152 home runs, 558 runs batted in, a .247 batting 
average, a .318 on-base average, and a .419 slugging average. According 
to a report in the Stockton Record, Sprague said he used performance-enhancing 
substances later banned by Major League Baseball and admitted hitting a 
home run with a corked bat.[4] Sprague was the head coach of the Pacific 
Tigers college baseball team from the 2004 season until he resigned following 
the 2015 season.[5] Sprague and his wife Kristen Babb-Sprague, who is an 
Olympic Gold Medalist in synchronized swimming, have four children. Their 
daughter Payton attends the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Business 
and their son Jed plays baseball at University of the Pacific (United States) 
as well as the Madison Mallards of the Northwoods League. Jed was selected 
by the Chicago White Sox in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB Draft. Ed is 
an alumnus of St. Mary's High School in Stockton, California. His father, 
Ed Sr., pitched in the majors from 1968 through 1976. Below is a table
