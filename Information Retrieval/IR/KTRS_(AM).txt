KTRS (550 AM) in an American radio station licensed to serve the community 
of Saint Louis, Missouri that carries a News/Talk format. The station is 
owned by the St. Louis Cardinals and CH Radio Holdings. It broadcasts with 
5,000 watts of power, day and night. KTRS' studios are located in Westport 
Plaza in Maryland Heights, while its transmitters are located near Gateway 
Motorsports Park in Madison. Weekday programming includes Coast to Coast

Post-Dispatch, began broadcasting experimentally in 1921 at 833 kc. with 
27 watts of power. The official sign-on didn't take place until June 26, 
1922. KSD moved to 550 kc. in 1923, with an increase in power to 5,000 
watts daytime and 1,000 watts nighttime taking place in 1934. With a new 
transmitter in place, in November 1948 KSD increased its night output, 
reaching a status of 5 kW (full-time).[2] KSD was one of the first eight 
radio stations of the NBC Radio Network in 1926. That association lasted 
until the early 1980s. Sister station KSD-TV (now KSDK) went on the air 
February 8, 1947. KSD radio also played standards and classical music, 
before moving to a Top 40 format in early 1971. After eventually settling 
on an all-news format in early 1980, KSD switched to country music the 
following year, and in 1983, KSD-AM became KUSA. March 17, 1993 saw the 
restoration of the KSD call letters and a switch back to all-news, this 
time utilizing the full-time CNN Headline News network feed.[3] The return 
to adult standards came in January 1995.[4] On April 15, 1996, the station 
became KTRS and flipped to its current News/Talk format. The station was 
purchased by its current owners, CH Radio Holdings, in 1997. KUSA started 
AM stereo broadcasts in 1983 after rebuilding most of their transmitter 
to accommodate stereo transmissions. Stereo broadcasts continued throughout 
most of the 1990s, using the C-QUAM standard. In 1997, KTRS stopped sending 
stereo programming to the transmitter but continued broadcasting the stereo 
pilot signal. In 2001, the stereo pilot was silenced. KTRS is the home 
of The Large Morning Show in the Afternoon, which features host Frank O 
Pinion (John Craddock), the highest rated, as well as the highest paid 
radio personality in St. Louis.[citation needed] Along with Frank are Dan 
Strauss (producer), Ian Geisz, and, at one time, Tina Dalpiaz. Tina Dalpiaz 
left the show in October, 2012. Pinion is one of the few on-air personalities 
to survive a major change in personnel announced in December 2005. KTRS 
Morning Show hosts Bill Wilkerson and Wendy Wiese, sports director Jim 
Holder (at the time the public address announcer at the Edward Jones Dome 
for the NFL Rams' games), Randy Karraker, McGraw Milhaven, Kevin Horrigan, 
Scott St. James and Meme Wolff were all fired. Management, including program 
director Al Brady Law, announced plans to bring in a new lineup beginning 
in January 2006. Milhaven, however, was reinstated during the spring of 
2006. Law was fired on December 11 of that year. KTRS broadcast the St. 
Louis Blues from 2000-2006. In 2006, the Blues moved to competitor KMOX. 
After five years (2006–10), KTRS sold the rights of the St. Louis Cardinals 
to KMOX starting in 2011.[5] (The Cardinals nonetheless retained their 
ownership stake in KTRS and still airs the games of its owned-and-operated 
top farm club, the Memphis Redbirds, on KTRS.) Since then, the focus has 
been on personalities. With the elimination of the Cardinals, KTRS now 
airs the Missouri Tigers athletics as well as their weekly sports show, 
along with occasional high school football contests. KTRS announced on 
October 6, 2010, that it had hired the well-known radio personality J.C. 
Corcoran to fill its midday, weekday slot starting October 25, 2010; Corcoran 
was fired on April 27, 2012 and later joined KXFN. Trish Gazall, who had 
been John Brown's co-host, joined JC in January 2011 as his producer; Trish 
Gazall left the station in October 2012 for KEZK Steve Cochran, currently 
of WGN in Chicago, hosted a weekday evening talk show on KTRS from 2010
