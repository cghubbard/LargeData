John S. Middleton is an American business leader and philanthropist. He 
is part-owner of the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball, holding 
a 48% ownership stake in the team. His philanthropy has focused on ending 
homelessness.[1] The Middleton family descend from John Middleton, who 
in 1857 founded John Middleton Co., a Philadelphia retail tobacco shop 
that evolved into a manufacturer and marketer of pipe tobacco and cigars.[2] 
Middleton graduated from the Haverford School in 1973.[3] He was a wrestler 
at Amherst College where he graduated magna cum laude in 1977 with his 
bachelor's degree in economics.[4] He then attended Harvard Business School, 
graduating in 1979 with his Master of Business Administration.[5] Middleton 
is married to Leigh Middleton, and they have two children. Middleton began 
working at his family’s cigar business at age 16.[6] After graduating from 
Harvard, he returned home to work at John Middleton Inc. where his father 
put him on the company’s board. Under Middleton, the company bought four 
tobacco brands from R.J. Reynolds, transforming the company into a major 
player in the packaged-cigar business.[6] In 2007, Middleton sold John 
Middleton Co. to Altria, the parent of Phillip Morris USA, for $2.9 billion.[7] 
Middleton is the President of Bradford Holdings, the parent company whose 
subsidiaries have included John Middleton Inc., Double Play Inc. and McIntosh 
Inns.[3] Middleton's father, Herbert, bought a 15% stake in the Phillies 
for $18 million in 1994.[8] Serving as head of the limited partnership, 
Middleton has been elected as chairman of the partners’ Advisory Board 
annually since 1998. When Phillies' chairman David Montgomery needed to 
take medical leave of absence in 2014, Middleton assumed a more active 
role in the Phillies, overseeing on-field and business performance. In 
2015, the Phillies’ ownership group designated Middleton as their public 
voice. Middleton committed that the Phillies would have a greater focus 
on analytics, which influenced the hiring of Andy MacPhail, president, 
and Matt Klentak, general manager.[9][10][11] Middleton and his wife, Leigh, 
share philanthropic involvement in several organizations that include, 
Museum of Art, Penn Medicine,[12] the Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church,[13] 
the Academy of Natural Sciences, and Project HOME.[14] In 2012, the Middletons 
announced a gift of more than $16.2 million to the Philadelphia School 
District, Philadelphia Youth Network, Philadelphia Academies and Drexel 
University for career and technical education.[15] In 2013, the Middletons 
pledged $30 million to Project HOME[12] in an effort to end chronic homelessness 
by doubling the number of its apartments for homeless people, opening a 
new medical center and leveraging additional public and private funds.[16] 
In 2014, it was announced that the couple had received the the 2013 Philadelphia 
Award, given for their philanthropic works in the Philadelphia area, directed 
towards education, homelessness, and workforce development projects.[17][18] 
Middleton serves as a member of the board of trustees of Amherst College, 
which awarded him its Medal for Eminent Service in 2004 in recognition
