The 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 75th playing of the 
midseason exhibition baseball game between the all-stars of the American 
League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major 
League Baseball. The game was held on July 13, 2004 at Minute Maid Park 
in Houston, Texas, the home of the Houston Astros of the National League. 
The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 
9â€“4, thus awarding an AL team (which would eventually be the Boston Red 
Sox) home-field advantage in the 2004 World Series. Players in italics 
have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Notes
