East Cleveland is a city in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States, and is 
the first suburb of Cleveland. The population was 17,843 at the 2010 census. 
East Cleveland is bounded by the city of Cleveland to its north, west, 
and a small section of its southwestern edge, and by Cleveland Heights 
to the east and the majority of its southern limits. Historically East 
Cleveland was partially founded by Scottish immigrants, whose names can 
still be found in the city such as Shaw, McIlrath, and Eddy.[7] East Cleveland 
incorporated as a village in 1895 and became a city in 1911. This charter 
included provisions for women's suffrage, which at the time was unheard 
of east of the Mississippi River. Before the charter passed, the city of 
Cleveland unsuccessfully attempted to annex the emerging municipality in 
1910 and again in 1916. East Cleveland is home to General Electric's historic 
Nela Park, the world's first industrial park.[8] Nela Park, which was added 
to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, continues to operate 
today as the functional headquarters for GE Lighting and is the city's 
second largest employer. Huron Hospital, a satellite hospital of the Cleveland 
Clinic, was the city's largest employer. Huron Hospital was a notable health 
care facility, being the only Level-II trauma center between Cleveland's 
MetroHealth Medical Center, located on West 25th Street, and Hillcrest 
Hospital, located in Mayfield Heights. Huron Hospital closed in early spring 
of 2011. East Cleveland includes a portion of Euclid Avenue, which from 
the 1860s through the 1920s was known as "Millionaire's Row." The many 
estates along this stretch of road in East Cleveland included the 248-acre 
(1.00 km2) home of the late John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil founder and 
"the world’s first billionaire." By the Great Depression a great number 
of homes along "Millionaire's Row" were demolished or abandoned. Although 
commercial properties and fast-food chains replaced many Euclid Avenue 
homes during the second half of the 20th century, East Cleveland is still 
home to 18 of the original "Millionaire's Row" homes, while only six are 
left in the city of Cleveland. After World War II, development of other 
suburbs within the region brought a number of changes to East Cleveland. 
By the 1960s, African Americans constituted an increasingly large portion 
of the city's population. By 1984, East Cleveland was one of the largest 
primarily black communities in Ohio, with a population of 36,957. East 
Cleveland is a charter city that is granted its authority under the home 
rule provisions of the Ohio constitution. Prior to 1985 East Cleveland 
had been under the leadership of a Commission and City Manager. In 1985 
voters grew frustrated with that form of government[citation needed] after 
two commissioners were charged with theft in office, and after a revolving 
door of city managers resulted in little stability and a reduction in services. 
Citizens for Sound Government, a group of residents, led a petition drive 
to elect a strong mayor and to create a five-member city council. Attorney 
Darryl E. Pittman became the first mayor to lead the city since 1908. He 
was sworn in on January 1, 1986. After two years on the job, in Pittman's 
second two-year term, Ohio's State Auditor declared on September 9, 1988 
that East Cleveland was in fiscal emergency. The fiscal emergency designation 
came when the water and sewer fund were found to have deficits in excess 
of $2 million. Pittman was defeated in 1989 by Wallace D. Davis, the council 
president and a funeral home owner. Prior to his defeat, Pittman convinced 
former U.S. Rep. Louis Stokes to support a congressional amendment that 
made East Cleveland a "direct entitlement city" under HUD. That designation 
gave the city the authority to receive more than $1 million a year in block 
grant funding directly from HUD. Davis borrowed $2.5 million that had to 
be paid back in eight years to get the city out of fiscal emergency. His 
administration made the last payment in 1997, but the city remained in 
fiscal emergency throughout Mayor Emmanuel Onunwor's eight-year term in 
office, and after he was indicted and convicted on federal charges of racketeering 
and corruption in 2004. Onunwor was sentenced to nine years in federal 
prison in September 2004. He was temporarily replaced by Council President 
Saratha Goggins. Eric J. Brewer became the city's fourth elected mayor 
on January 1, 2006 and served one term. Brewer had been an investigative 
journalist. He negotiated an agreement with Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson 
to take over East Cleveland's water department in 2008, resulting in significant 
savings to help the city as it struggled through fiscal emergency.[9] The 
deal resulted in the transfer of city employees to Cleveland as part of 
the 25-year agreement. During his primary re-election campaign in 2009, 
which he lost to city council president, Gary Norton, Brewer accused the 
police union of releasing photographs depicting of him wearing women's 
lingerie.[10][11] Gary Norton, a Democrat, took office in January 2010. 
He was elected after defeating Brewer by a nearly 2-1 margin in the Democratic 
primary election.[12] He did not face a challenger in the general election. 
Norton was elected to city council in 2006. 95.8% spoke English, 2.1% Spanish, 
and 1.2% Russian.[18] As of the census[4] of 2010, there were 17,843 people, 
8,286 households, and 4,043 families residing in the city. The population

residents is over twice the national rate of 3.8 and above the statewide 
rate of 2.85. In the same way, the number of reported crimes per square 
mile (168) is many times that of Ohio (35) and the nation (32.8).[19] On 
July 19, 2013, East Cleveland police responding to reports of a foul odor, 
investigated a garage leased to Michael Madison, a 35-year-old sex offender, 
and discovered a decomposing body laying inside. Two more bodies were found 
the following day, one in a backyard and the other in the basement of a 
vacant house. The bodies, which all belonged to young African-American 
women, were found 100-to-200 yards apart, each wrapped in a plastic bag. 
After obtaining a search warrant, police entered Madison's apartment and 
found "further evidence of decomposition." After a brief standoff with 
police at his mother's house, Madison was taken into custody without incident.[20] 
Some media organizations say he might have been influenced by convicted 
Cleveland serial killer Anthony Sowell.[21][22] One of the three victims 
was identified as Angela Deskins, a 38-year-old resident of Cleveland who 
was reported missing in June 2013.[23] The other two were identified as 
Shetisha Sheeley[24] and Shirellda Helen Terry.[25] On July 22, 2013, Madison 
was charged with three charges of aggravated murder.[26] On May 5, 2016, 
he was found guilty of all three murders.[27] In June 2016, Madison was 
sentenced to death.[28] On April 28, 2012, Detective Randy Hicks, Officer 
Jonathan O'Leary, and other members of the East Cleveland Police Department 
arrested Arnold Black on suspicion of drug activity. O'Leary punched Black 
as Hicks stood by. Black was then locked in a storage closet for four days 
with only a carton of milk and without access to a lawyer. In the resulting 
lawsuit, the police were unable to produce dashboard camera video of the 
beating or any police reports of the arrest. A jury awarded Black $22 million, 
including $10 million from Police Chief Ralph Spotts. The city has appealed 
the verdict.[29] East Cleveland is located at 41°31′54″N 81°34′55″W﻿ / 
﻿41.53167°N 81.58194°W﻿ / 41.53167; -81.58194 (41.531701, -81.581948).[30] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area 
of 3.10 square miles (8.03 km2), of which 3.09 square miles (8.00 km2) 
is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) is water.[2] Most of the city 
is located in a relatively flat and relatively lower area contiguous with 
the city of Cleveland. A small portion of the city lies atop a steep hill, 
and is contiguous with the neighboring city of Cleveland Heights; it also 
lies in a relatively flat area at a higher elevation. Superior Road, Forest 
Hills Boulevard, Lee Road, Noble and North Taylor roads are the major through-streets 
ascending the hill. The McGregor Home and the Forest Hill Historic District 
are located on "the hill." The 248-acre (1.00 km2) Forest Hill Park boasts 
three baseball diamonds, tennis courts and walking trails that have retained 
the natural green space as intended by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. when he 
deeded the park to East Cleveland and the City of Cleveland Heights. Forest 
Hill Park is the largest single body of green park space between two large 
metroparks on the far east and west sides of Cleveland, Ohio. The city 
also features Pattison Park and Hawley Park.[31] The East Cleveland City 
School District provides public education to more than 3000 students in 
seven new or renovated buildings that were updated as part of a $94 million 
state-sponsored school construction project. Voters in 1997 agreed to add 
another $10 million to the $94 million for operating costs. East Cleveland 
schools consist of Shaw High School, Heritage Middle School (formerly Kirk 
Middle School), Prospect Elementary School, Chambers Elementary School, 
Superior Elementary School, Mayfair Elementary School and Caledonia Elementary 
School. Rozelle Elementary School was closed due to lower student enrollment 
and was later demolished.[32] East Cleveland Public Library operates the 
Main Branch at 14101 Euclid Avenue. In December 2009 the Caledonia Branch 
at 960 Caledonia Avenue, and the North Branch at 1425 Hayden Avenue were 
closed due to budget cuts and the decline in population.[33] East Cleveland 
is a major public transportation hub for northeast Ohio with a total of 
80 (approximately one-third) of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit 
Authority bus routes beginning or ending inside the city. The GCRTA's Red 
Line's eastern terminus is located at the Windermere Rapid Station, located 
on Euclid Avenue in East Cleveland. Destinations along the Red Line include 
University Circle, Cleveland State University, Tower City Center/Public 
Square, the West Side Market, and Hopkins International Airport. Passengers 
boarding GCRTA buses with stops in East Cleveland have access to an even 
wider range of employment, educational, recreational and cultural destinations
