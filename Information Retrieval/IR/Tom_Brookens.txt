Thomas Dale Brookens (born August 10, 1953) is a former third baseman in 
Major League Baseball who played for the Detroit Tigers (1979–1988), New 
York Yankees (1989), and Cleveland Indians (1990). Brookens was on the 
Tigers coaching staff from 2009 to 2013, serving as first base coach and 
later third base coach. He was replaced as third base coach prior to the 
2014 season by Dave Clark.[1] On January 9, 1975, Brookens was drafted 
by the Detroit Tigers in the first round (fourth pick overall) of the 1975 
amateur draft. In 12 major league seasons, Brookens played 1,065 games 
at third base, 162 games at second base, and 119 games at shortstop. Tigers 
radio announcer Ernie Harwell nicknamed Brookens "the Pennsylvania Poker", 
a play on the song "Pennsylvania Polka".[citation needed] Brookens batted 
.246 in his 12-year career, with 71 home runs and 431 runs batted in (RBIs) 
in 1,336 games. His range factor (putouts and assists per game) was well 
above league average. He did lead American League (AL) third basemen in 
errors twice, in 1980 and 1985, but that was largely because he was getting 
to so many more grounders than other fielders; his range factor, which 
measures the number of plays a fielder makes, was consistently above league 
average. Brookens also has the dubious honor of sharing (with 21 others) 
the AL record for the most errors in a game by a third baseman, four, on 
September 6, 1980.[2] Traditionally an infielder, Brookens found himself 
behind the plate in a game against the Texas Rangers on July 20, 1985. 
With regular catcher Lance Parrish hurt and Bob Melvin and Marty Castillo 
removed from the game in favor of pinch-hitters, Brookens (who had never 
caught a pro game before, even in the minors) filled the role and wound 
up catching five innings (11th through the 15th) before Detroit finally 
won the game. On August 20, 1980, Brookens went 5-for-5 with a triple and 
a home run, and also started a triple play in an 8–6 win over the Milwaukee 
Brewers.[3] Besides, Brookens played winter baseball with the Leones del 
Caracas club of the Venezuelan League during the 1977–1979 seasons.[4] 
He won a World Series ring with the Tigers in 1984. Brookens in 2005 and 
2006 was the manager of the Class A New York–Penn League Oneonta Tigers 
in the Detroit Tigers minor league system. In 2007, Brookens was hired 
to lead the West Michigan Whitecaps which won the championship of the Class 
A – Midwest League that year. After winning a championship with the Whitecaps, 
the Tigers promoted Brookens again in 2008, this time to the Erie SeaWolves, 
their Class AA – Eastern League affiliate.[5] On November 9, 2009 the Tigers 
hired Brookens as their new first base coach.[6] The move reunited Brookens 
with Tigers manager Jim Leyland, who had managed Brookens in the minor 
leagues in the 1970s. In 2013, Brookens was moved across the diamond to 
serve as the Tigers third base coach; he was mentioned as a possible future 
manager of the club when Leyland retired, but former catcher Brad Ausmus 
was named Leyland's replacement. Brookens' twin brother Tim was also drafted 
in 1975 by the Texas Rangers; he was later traded to the Tigers organization, 
but never made the majors. In spring training, Tim and Tom would sometimes 
switch identities, even suiting up in each other's uniforms; Tim is believed 
to have played at least one exhibition game disguised as Tom.[citation

Ike's son Casey Brookens also played in the minors in the 1990s before
