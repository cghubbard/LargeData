Quintin Lonell Berry (born November 21, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, 
and Chicago Cubs. Berry played prep baseball at Morse High School in San 
Diego, California, where he also played football and basketball. He was 
a classmate and teammate of current Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones, 
and the two remain good friends.[1] Berry played one season of baseball 
at Grossmont Junior College before moving on to San Diego State University 
(SDSU). Berry's head coach at SDSU was former major leaguer and Baseball 
Hall of Fame member Tony Gwynn.[2] He was named to the All-Mountain West 
Conference first team in 2005 and the second team in 2006.[3] Berry was 
originally drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 25th round of the 2003 
Major League Baseball Draft out of high school, but did not sign. He was 
drafted three years later in the fifth round of the 2006 Major League Baseball 
Draft by the Philadelphia Phillies, with whom he signed within 48 hours.[4] 
Berry played in the Phillies minor league system for 4½ seasons before 
being designated for assignment on July 12, 2010.[5] He was claimed on 
waivers by the San Diego Padres two days later and spent the remainder 
of the 2010 season playing for the Double-A San Antonio Missions. On December 
10, 2010, Berry was claimed by the New York Mets from the Padres in the 
minor league phase of the Rule 5 draft. The Mets released Berry during 
spring training in 2011. On April 21, 2011 Berry signed a minor league 
contract with the Cincinnati Reds. He spent a majority of the season playing 
for the Carolina Mudcats in the Double-A Southern League. He made his Triple-A 
debut that same year, appearing in four games with the Louisville Bats.[6] 
On November 9, 2011 Berry signed a minor league contract with the Detroit 
Tigers. He was assigned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens following spring 
training in 2012.[7] Before Opening Day 2013, Berry was sent down to the 
Triple-A Toledo. On June 2, 2013, Berry was designated for assignment by 
the Tigers.[8] He was then claimed off waivers by the Kansas City Royals, 
who optioned him to Triple-A Omaha.[9] Berry's contract was purchased by 
the Tigers on May 23, 2012, and he was added to the 25-man roster.[10] 
He made his debut the same day, replacing an injured Austin Jackson in 
centerfield and batting leadoff.[11] His first MLB hit came in the form 
of a rare bunt double.[12] Berry became the first Detroit Tigers player 
since 1918 to hit safely in his first six games as a Tiger.[13] On June 
17, 2012, Berry became just the third Tigers rookie to have five hits in 
a game since 1999. Seven days later, on June 24, 2012, he hit his first 
big-league home run in a 3–2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Berry was 
added to the Tigers postseason roster following the conclusion of the 2012 
regular season.[14] Berry was named the 2012 Detroit Tigers Rookie of the 
Year by the Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association. He led the major leagues 
in stolen base percentage with a 100% success rate (21 for 21 in the regular 
season and two for two in the playoffs), and he also finished 10th in the 
American League in triples, with six.[4] The 21 stolen bases set an American 
League record for most stolen bases in a season without a single caught 
stealing, surpassing the previous record of 20 set by Paul Molitor in 1994.[15] 
Berry participated in the 2012 World Series, which pitted the Tigers against 
the San Francisco Giants. He played in all four games and was hitless in 
eight at-bats, drawing a single base on balls[4] as the Giants swept the 
Tigers.[16] Before the 2013 season, Berry entered spring training in competition 
for a spot on the Tigers 25-man roster. On March 27, he was optioned to 
the Toledo Mud Hens, the Tigers Triple-A minor league affiliate. Berry 
hit .323 (10-for-31) with seven RBIs, three walks and six strikeouts in 
Grapefruit League play, but had also missed some time due to patellar tendinitis.[17][18] 
Berry began the 2013 season playing for the Toledo Mud Hens. However, Berry 
was designated for assignment when Detroit traded for Francisco Martínez 
to make room for Martínez on the 40 man roster.[19] On June 4, the Kansas 
City Royals claimed Berry off waivers and assigned him to their Triple-A 
minor league affiliate the Omaha Storm Chasers.[20] On August 27, 2013, 
Berry was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Clayton Mortensen.[21] He appeared 
in only 13 regular season games for the Red Sox, but hit .625 with a home 
run, 4 runs batted in and 3 stolen bases, earning him a postseason roster 
spot for his base-stealing abilities. Berry did not have a plate appearance 
in the 2013 postseason, but made three pinch-running appearances and went 
3 for 3 in stolen base attempts, earning his first career World Series 
ring when the Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals for the title. The 
Red Sox released Berry on December 23, 2013.[22] Berry signed a minor league 
deal with the Baltimore Orioles on January 3, 2014. On June 12, 2014, while 
playing for the Norfolk Tides, he was ejected by an umpire after hitting 
a single. Berry proceeded to run the bases, slide into home, and then yell 
profanities at the umpires. The video of this bizarre incident was played 
on several sports television shows, including Keith Olbermann's.[23] On 
January 18, 2015, Berry once again signed a minor league deal with the 
Red Sox. He was released by the Red Sox on August 21, 2015. Berry signed 
a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs on August 25, 2015.[24] Berry 
signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on 
December 2, 2015.[25] He was released on August 23, 2016.[26] Berry signed 
a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on September 1, 2016, 
and was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons.[27] Berry was released
