The Boston Red Sox' 2005 season included the Boston Red Sox attempting 
to win the American League East in the American League. The Red Sox finished 
95-67, with the same record as the New York Yankees. Because the Yankees 
won the head-to-head season series, they won the tie-breaker for the American 
League East division title, and the Red Sox, with the best record of a 
non-division winner, were designated as winners of the American League 
Wild Card. The Red Sox made a few notable offseason moves coming off their 
2004 World Series championship. The team brought back Jason Varitek by 
re-signing the veteran catcher to a 4-year $40 million deal.[1] Management 
sought to fill the void left by Orlando Cabrera and Pokey Reese at shortstop 
by signing free agent Edgar Rentería to a 4-year $40 million year with 
a 5th year option.[1] The move sat well with fans because Rentería was 
coming off a very successful 2004 campaign with St. Louis Cardinals. Rentería 
hit .287 with 10 homeruns and 72 RBI in 2004.[2] The Red Sox front office 
looked to bolster their starting pitching by signing two veteran pitchers. 
The need for starting pitching was a point of emphasize due to the departure 
of Pedro Martínez to the New York Mets after 7 years in a Red Sox uniform.[3] 
The first pitcher signed was former Padres starter David Wells. Wells was 
coming off a surprising 2004 season with the Padres in which he posted 
a 3.73 ERA over 195 innings pitched at the age of 41.[4] The second pitcher 
signed was former Cubs starter Matt Clement. Clement was coming off a season 
in which he posted a respectable 3.68 ERA over 181 innings pitched.[5] 
An unfavorable offseason transaction also occurred before the 2005 season. 
Management traded away fan favorite outfielder Dave Roberts to the Padres 
in exchange for shortstop Ramon Vazquez and left fielder Jay Payton. Roberts 
played a huge role as a base stealer during the 2004 World Series run for 
the Red Sox.[6] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]

The Chicago White Sox swept the Red Sox in the American League Division 
Series. The White Sox went on to win the World Series that year against 
the Houston Astros. The Red Sox were forced to play in the 2005 Postseason 
as a wild card team even though they had the same regular season record 
as their interdivision rival the New York Yankees. That is due to the fact 
that the Yankees had won the regular season head to head matchups versus 
the Red Sox 10-9. A crucial moment of the series came in game 2 when Red 
Sox second baseman Tony Graffanino made a crucial error that led to the 
White Sox scoring 3 unearned runs in the fifth inning. A slow groundball 
hit to the right side of the infield was able to get past Graffanino and 
a key double play was not turned. Later in the inning, White Sox second 
baseman Tadahito Iguchi hit a 3-run homerun to give the White Sox a 1 run 
lead.[15] Red Sox pitcher David Wells was pitching well in the game until 
the error. The error is viewed by many fans as having le the Red Sox Game 
2 and eventually the American League Division Series. Red Sox ace Curt 
Schilling did not start a game in the American League Division Series after
