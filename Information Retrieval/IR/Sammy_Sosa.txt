Samuel Kelvin "Sammy" Peralta Sosa (born November 12, 1968) is a Dominican 
former professional baseball right fielder. Sosa played with four Major 
League Baseball teams over his career, most notably the Chicago Cubs. Sosa's 
Major League career began with the Texas Rangers in 1989. After three seasons 
with the Chicago White Sox, Sosa became a member of the Cubs in 1992 and 
became one of the league's best hitters. Sosa hit his 400th home run in 
his 1,354th game and his 5,273rd at-bat, the quickest in National League 
history. In 1998, Sosa and Mark McGwire achieved national fame for their 
home run-hitting prowess in pursuit of Roger Maris' home run record. Sosa 
finished his career with brief stints with the Baltimore Orioles and the 
Texas Rangers.[1] With the Rangers, Sosa hit his 600th career home run 
to become the fifth player in MLB history to reach the milestone. He is 
also the all-time home run leader among foreign-born MLB players. Sosa 
is one of only two National League players since 1900 to ever reach 160 
RBIs in a season, a milestone he reached in 2001. Sosa is the only player 
to have hit 60 or more home runs in a single season three times. Sosa is 
known to family and friends as "Mikey." His maternal grandmother, who had 
suggested his birth name of Samuel, also came up with his nickname: "[She] 
heard the name on a soap opera she liked and decided from that moment on 
he would be Mikey."[2] Sosa was born in the Dominican Republic. Though 
born in Consuelo, his officially registered birthplace is San Pedro de 
Macorís, which was "the largest town nearby." Both Consuelo and San Pedro 
de Macorís are in San Pedro de Macorís Province.[3] Sosa made his major 
league debut on June 16, 1989, with the Texas Rangers, wearing #17 and 
leading off as the starting center fielder. He hit his first career home 
run off Roger Clemens. Later in the season, the Rangers traded Sammy to 
the Chicago White Sox where he would don the #25. In 1990, Sosa batted 
.233 with 15 home runs, 70 runs batted in, 10 triples, and 32 stolen bases. 
However, he also struck out 150 times, fourth most in the American League. 
Sosa started the 1991 season by hitting 2 home runs and driving in 5 runs. 
However, he would slump for the rest of the year and ended up batting .203 
with 10 home runs and 33 runs batted in. He was traded to the Chicago Cubs 
for outfielder George Bell before the 1992 season. Sosa batted .260 with 
8 home runs and 25 RBIs in his first season with the Cubs. Although not 
spectacular numbers, it showed that Sosa improved as a hitter. In 1993, 
Sosa batted .261 with 33 home runs with 93 RBIs. He also showed his speed 
by stealing 38 bases. He became the Cubs' first 30-30 player in their history. 
Sosa continued to hit for power and speed in 1994 but he also improved 
his batting average. He ended up batting .300 with 25 home runs, 70 RBIs, 
and 22 stolen bases. Sosa was named to his first All-Star team in 1995. 
In 144 games, he batted .268 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs. Sosa continued 
his success with the Cubs in 1996 as he batted .273 with 40 home runs and 
100 RBIs. However, the next year, Sosa struggled. Despite hitting 36 home 
runs with 119 RBIs, Sosa batted just .251. He struggled to get on base(.300 
on-base percentage) and led the league in strikeouts with 174. After years 
as a respected power/speed threat with a rocket arm in right field, he 
emerged during the 1998 season as one of baseball's greatest. It was in 
this season that both Sosa and Mark McGwire were involved in the "home 
run record chase", when both players' prowess for hitting home runs drew 
national attention as they attempted to pass Roger Maris' single season 
home run mark of 61 home runs that had stood since 1961. For the early 
months of the year, Sosa trailed McGwire significantly, being as many as 
16 homers behind at one point in May. But as the chase progressed, Sosa 
would rally and eventually tie McGwire with 46 home runs each on August 
10, after a couple months of straggling within a few homers for the lead. 
However, the moment was short lived as McGwire would pull away slightly 
and reach 62 home runs to break the record first on September 8, but once 
again Sosa would excitingly heat up the race by tying McGwire once again 
at 62 on September 13. Eleven days later, with two games left to play in 
the season, the two were tied at 66 home runs each. Sosa would end the 
season with 66 after playing both games without a home run(still a team 
record), just behind McGwire's 70 after hitting two home runs in each of 
the last two games. However, Sammy had become the first Major League batter 
ever to hit 66 home runs in a season. It was during that season, that Cubs 
announcer Chip Caray nicknamed him "Slammin' Sammy", a nickname that quickly 
spread. In addition, Sammy produced then career highs in batting average 
and slugging percentage, at .308 and .647 respectively. Sosa also led the 
league in RBIs and runs scored. Also in 1998, Sosa's 416 total bases were 
the most in a single season since Stan Musial's 429 in 1948. Sosa's performance 
in the month of June, during which Sosa belted 20 home runs, knocked in 
47 runs, and posted an .842 slugging percentage, was one of the greatest 
offensive outbursts in major league history. Sosa won the National League 
Most Valuable Player Award for leading the Cubs into the playoffs in 1998, 
earning every first-place vote except for the two cast by St. Louis writers, 
who voted for McGwire. He and McGwire shared Sports Illustrated magazine's 
1998 "Sportsman of the Year" award. Sosa was honored with a ticker-tape 
parade in his honor in New York City, and he was invited to be a guest 
at US President Bill Clinton's 1999 State of the Union Address. 1998 was 
also the first time the Cubs made the post-season since 1989. The Cubs 
qualified as the NL Wild Card team, but were swept by the Atlanta Braves 
in the NLDS. In the 1999 season, Sosa hit 63 home runs, again trailing 
Mark McGwire who hit 65. In the 2000 season, Sammy led the league by hitting 
50 home runs. He received the Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading MLB 
in homers.[5] In 2001, he hit 64 home runs, becoming the first player to 
hit 60 home runs in three seasons in his career. However, he did not lead 
the league in any of those seasons; in 2001, he finished behind Barry Bonds, 
who hit 73 homers, breaking the single-season home run record set by McGwire 
in 1998 (70). In the same season he set personal records in runs scored 
(146), RBI (160), walks (116), on-base percentage (.437), slugging percentage 
(.737), and batting average (.328).[1] He led the majors in runs and RBI, 
was 2nd in home runs, 2nd in slugging percentage, 1st in total bases, 3rd 
in walks, 4th in on-base percentage, 12th in batting average, and 15th 
in hits. He also surpassed his 1998 number in total bases, racking up 425. 
Sosa once again led the league in home runs with 49 in 2002. Known as a 
free-swinger in his early years, and as a good strikeout candidate, Sammy 
became an effective hitter for average. He owns numerous team records for 
the Cubs, and he holds the major-league record for the most home runs hit 
in a month (20, in June 1998). In recognition of his accomplishments as 
a hitter, Sosa won the Silver Slugger Award (an award for offensive output, 
voted on by managers and coaches) in 1995 and in 1998 through 2002.[1] 
In 2003, the Cubs won the National League Central Division title. The year 
was not all good news for Sosa, however. In May, he spent his first period 
on the disabled list since 1996 after having an injured toenail removed. 
On June 3, 2003, Sosa was ejected from a Chicago Cubs-Tampa Bay Devil Rays 
game in the first inning when umpires discovered he had been using a corked 
bat.[6] Major League Baseball confiscated and tested 76 of Sosa's other 
bats after his ejection; all were found to be clean, with no cork. Five 
bats he had sent to the Hall of Fame in past years were also tested, and 
were all clean as well.[7] Sosa stated that he had accidentally used the 
corked bat, which he claimed he only used during batting practice. "I use 
that bat for batting practice. It's something that I take the blame for. 
It's a mistake, I know that. I feel sorry. I just apologize to everybody 
that are embarrassed."[8] When Dusty Baker, the Cub manager was interviewed 
later, he stated any use of corked bats on his team is strictly prohibited. 
On June 6, Sosa was suspended for eight games.[9] However, the suspension 
was reduced to seven games after appeal on June 11.[10] Sosa finished the 
season with 40 home runs, and he hit two more in the 2003 NLCS against 
the Florida Marlins, which the Cubs led 3 games to 1 before ultimately 
falling in seven games. In May 2004, Sosa suffered an odd injury while 
sitting next to his locker chatting with reporters before a game in San 
Diego's Petco Park. He sneezed very violently, causing severe back pain. 
He was diagnosed with back spasms and placed on the disabled list. Later, 
he fell into one of the worst slumps of his career, only snapping out of 
it during the last week of the season. He was greatly depressed when the 
officials told him he couldn't play. He finished with 35 homers, far below 
his numbers of his best years. In his final 10 years with the Cubs he clubbed 
479 home runs; the most in history over a 10-year span. The final straw 
for the Cubs was an incident in late 2004. Sosa requested to sit out the 
last game of the season, which was at home against the Atlanta Braves, 
and he left Wrigley Field early in the game. It was his last time in a 
Cubs uniform. On January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the Baltimore 
Orioles in exchange for infielder/outfielder Jerry Hairston, Jr., infielder 
Mike Fontenot, and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and 
his agent agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and 
the players' union indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under 
the deal, Sosa earned $17,875,000 for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying 
$7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 
500-home-run batter Rafael Palmeiro, Sosa and Palmeiro became the first 
500 home run club members in history to play together on the same team 
after reaching the 500 home run plateau.[11] Sosa finished the 2005 season 
batting .221 with 14 home runs, his worst performance since 1992, and continuing 
his post-2001 trend of declines in batting average, homers, total bases, 
and RBI. On December 7, 2005, the Orioles decided not to offer him an arbitration 
contract, effectively ending his Baltimore Orioles tenure and making him 
a free agent. In 2005, The Sporting News published an update of their 1999 
book Baseball's 100 Greatest Players. Sosa did not make the original edition, 
but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher, he 
was ranked at Number 95. During a stretch of nine consecutive years, Sosa 
hit 35+ home runs and 100+ RBIs, all with the Chicago Cubs.[1] At the end 
of January 2006, the Washington Nationals offered Sosa two different minor-league 
offers, both of which he turned down. On February 15, 2006, Sosa's agent 
Adam Katz stated: "We're not going to put him on the retirement list. We 
decided that [not putting him on that list] was the best thing to do. But 
I can say, with reasonable certainty, that we've seen Sammy in a baseball 
uniform for the last time."[12] During this year, Sosa accompanied President 
Fernández of the Dominican Republic on several diplomatic trips including 
to the United States, Japan, and Taiwan. The Texas Rangers, Sosa's original 
team, signed him to a minor league deal worth $500,000 on January 30, 2007. 
This was the same contract that Sosa turned down the previous year from 
the Nationals. The contract included an invitation to spring training, 
where Sosa competed for a spot in the lineup with Nelson Cruz, Jason Botts, 
and other rookies/prospects.[13] Sosa was successful during spring training 
and was added to the team's 25-man roster. He started the 2007 season as 
the Rangers' designated hitter and occasional right fielder. At the same 
time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's # 21 to new pitcher Jason Marquis, 
despite the fact that it was formerly worn by Sosa, who coincidentally 
later hit his 600th home run against Marquis. Ted Lilly, who had also signed 
with the Cubs that prior winter had requested #31 but was told it was not 
available as it was going to be retired for Greg Maddux and Fergie Jenkins, 
and they were just waiting for Maddux to retire. This caused some concern, 
due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the 
Cubs' all-time home run leader.[14] On April 26, 2007, Sosa made history 
by hitting a home run in his 45th major league ballpark. He has also homered 
in The Ballpark at Disney's Wide World of Sports, near Orlando, Florida, 
a usually minor-league and Spring training park that hosted a regular season 
series between the Rangers and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in May 2007, although 
he did not hit a homer at the two regular season games the Cubs played 
at the Tokyo Dome in 2000 vs. the Mets. On June 20, 2007, Sosa hit a home 
run off of Jason Marquis during an inter-league game against the Chicago 
Cubs. Sosa became only the fifth man in history, following Babe Ruth, Willie 
Mays, Hank Aaron, and Barry Bonds, to hit 600 regular season home runs. 
The home run was the first one that Sosa had recorded against the Cubs, 
and as a result he has hit a home run against every active MLB team. Sosa 
is the Cubs' all-time home run leader, having hit 545 with that team. On 
May 28, 2008, Sosa announced that he instructed his agent not to offer 
his services to any MLB team for the 2008 season, and planned on filing 
for retirement, but never did.[15] On December 25, 2008, Sosa announced 
he intended to unretire and play in the World Baseball Classic and once 
again test the free agent market in hopes of signing with a Major League 
ballclub in 2009. Sosa said that he had been keeping in shape at his home, 
and was hoping that after a strong World Baseball Classic he would prove 
to major-league teams that he was still capable of playing in the MLB. 
However, he was not selected as part of the Dominican Republic's roster. 
He remained a free agent and did not actively look for a team. On June 
3, 2009, Sosa announced his intention to retire from baseball. He made 
the announcement in the Dominican Republic and said that he was calmly 
looking forward to his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame since his 
statistics were up to par.[16] On June 16, 2009, the New York Times reported 
that Sosa supposedly was on a list of players who tested positive for performance-enhancing 
drugs in 2003. The paper did not identify the drug nor the source of the 
information.[17] Sosa's agent, Adam Katz, told The Associated Press he 
had no comment on the report. Rich Levin, commissioner Bud Selig's office 
spokesman, declined to comment on the situation, claiming that MLB did 
not have a copy of the test results. Michael Weiner, the union general 
counsel, also declined comment. The union, while fighting to get the list 
back from the government, has mostly refused to discuss reports. Likewise, 
Sosa never admitted to using performance enhancing drugs nor did he ever 
fail an MLB drug test throughout his professional career. Previously, Sosa 
sat alongside Rafael Palmeiro, Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire at a 2005 
hearing before Congress. His attorney testified on his behalf,[18] stating 
"To be clear, I have never taken illegal performance-enhancing drugs. I 
have never injected myself or had anyone inject me with anything. I have 
not broken the laws of the United States or the laws of the Dominican Republic. 
I have been tested as recently as 2004, and I am clean."[19] In an interview 
with ESPN Deportes, Sosa said he would "calmly wait" for his induction 
into baseball's Hall of Fame, for which he became eligible in 2013. On 
January 9, 2013, Sosa was not elected by the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America (BBWAA) into baseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, receiving 
12.5% on his first year on the ballot (the requirement for election is 
75%). For the elections of 2014 through 2016 he received 7.2%, 6.6%, and 
7.0%. A candidate remains eligible for inclusion on subsequent ballots 
as long as they receive a minimum of 5.0% of the vote from the BBWAA. On 
October 2, 2016 at a press conference at Fenway Park, MLB Commissioner 
Rob Manfred said that the anonymous drug test in 2003 were inconclusive 
because "it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were 
legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program."[20] 
Manfred argued that "it was important to make people understand that even 
if your name was on that list, that it was entirely possible that you were 
not a positive".[21] Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test 
were supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players 
based on "leaks, rumors, innuendo, [and] not confirmed positive test results".[22] 
Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best 
judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many 
"legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly 
positives."[23] Sosa is married to Sonia Rodríguez, a Dominican vedette,[24] 
whom he has dated since 1986 and with whom he has four children: Keysha, 
Kenya, Sammy Jr., and Michael. The couple married by the Catholic Church 
on December 18, 2004, at Altos de Chavón, La Romana; they had already been 
married civilly for 12 years prior to the church wedding.[25] Italics denotes
