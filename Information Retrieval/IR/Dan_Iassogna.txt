Daniel Ralph Iassogna (born May 3, 1969) is an umpire in Major League Baseball. 
He joined the major league staff in 2004 and wears uniform number 58. In 
2012, Iassogna worked his first World Series. His professional umpiring 
career began in 1992, and he advanced to the International League in 1998. 
He umpired his first major league game in 1999, and worked as a fill-in 
for vacationing or injured major league umpires for the next four seasons. 
In 2004, Iassogna was promoted to the major leagues to replace the retired 
Steve Rippley. He umpired in the postseason in only his second year as 
a full-time major league umpire, and has worked one World Series (2012), 
four League Championship Series (2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) and five Division 
Series (2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012). Iassogna also worked the 2011 All-Star 
Game and the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Iassogna was the third base umpire 
when Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander threw a no-hitter at Comerica 
Park against the Milwaukee Brewers on June 12, 2007.[1] Five days prior 
to Verlander's no-hitter, Iassogna was also at third base in a game between 
the Boston Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics in which Boston pitcher Curt 
Schilling had a no-hitter until Shannon Stewart broke up the no-hitter 
with a single with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.[2] Iassogna 
was the second base umpire for Verlander's second no-hitter, thrown on 
May 7, 2011 against the Toronto Blue Jays.[3] In Game 2 of the 2012 World 
Series, Iassogna was the home plate umpire. In the second inning, Delmon 
Young doubled down the left field line. Prince Fielder, who was attempting 
to score on the play, was called out at home by Iassogna. Both Fielder 
and Tigers manager Jim Leyland argued, but video replays showed that the 
correct call was made.[4][5] Prior to pursuing umpiring, Iassogna earned 
a BA in English from the University of Connecticut. Having considered firefighting 
before becoming an umpire, Iassogna volunteers with the Chicago Fire Department's 
"Bucks for the Burn Camp," Team Kevin brain tumor research and the New 
York Fire Department's "Lil Bravest" charities; he also plays the Great 
Highland Bagpipes.[6] He is married with two daughters. Iassogna was mentioned
