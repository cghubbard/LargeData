the area is also home to hundreds of Thais, Taiwanese, Pakistanis, Laotians, 
Cambodians, and Burmese peoples as well. The Cleveland area is also home 
to some of the nation's largest Italian (numbering over 205,000), Slavic, 
and Hungarian populations. The Hungarian population was so great at one

Approximately 94.1% of the metropolitan area's population was native to

percentages of immigrants came from Europe (46.2%), Asia (32.7%), Latin 
America (14.3%); smaller percentages of newcomers came from Africa (3.6%), 
other parts of North America (3.0%), and Oceania (0.3%).[21] According 
to the American Community Survey 2006-2010, the number of Greater Cleveland 
area residents born overseas was 119,136 and the leading countries of origin 
were India (10,067), China (7,756), Mexico (6,051), Ukraine (7,211), Germany

1950s, AT&T assigned Greater Cleveland Area code 216, which included all 
of Northeast Ohio. In 1996, Area code 216 was reduced in size to cover 
the northern half of its prior area, centering on Cleveland and its lake 
shore suburbs. Area code 330 was introduced for the southern half of Greater 
Cleveland, including Medina County. In 1997, area code 216 was further 
split as the need for additional phone numbers grew. Area code 216 was 
reduced in geographical area to cover the city of Cleveland and its inner 
ring suburbs. Area code 440 was introduced to cover the remainder of was 
what previously area code 216, including all of Lorain, Geauga, and Lake 
counties, and parts of Cuyahoga County. Some communities, such as Parma, 
and Parma Heights were divided between the 216 and 440 area codes. In 1999, 
Congressman Dennis Kucinich introduced federal legislation to protect small 
and medium-sized cities from being split into two or more area codes.[26][27] 
In 2000, it was anticipated that the available phone numbers in area code 
330 would be exhausted, and an overlay area code was introduced. Area code 
234 was assigned to overlap existing area code 330. With the creation of 
area code 234, any new phone number in the geographical area formerly covered 
by area code 330 could be assigned a phone number in either the 234 or 
330 area codes, with no change in local or long distance toll status. This 
made necessary the use of ten-digit dialing within the 330/234 area code 
region. After the introduction of area code 234, assignments of new telephone 
numbers in the area did not continue at an accelerated pace, and new phone 
numbers for area code 234 were not assigned until 2003.[28] In 2011 the 
Greater Cleveland area had a GDP of $134.4 billion (up from $130.7 billion
