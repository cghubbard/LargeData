James Lee "Jim" Kaat (born November 7, 1938), nicknamed "Kitty", is a former 
American Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher for the Washington Senators/Minnesota 
Twins (1959–73), Chicago White Sox (1973–75), Philadelphia Phillies (1976–79), 
New York Yankees (1979–80), and St. Louis Cardinals (1980–83). His 25-year 
career spanned four decades. Kaat was an All-Star for three seasons and 
a Gold Glove winner for sixteen seasons. He was the American League (AL) 
leader in shutouts (5) in 1962, and the AL leader in wins (25) and complete 
games (19) in 1966. In addition to his 283 career wins, he has three 20-win 
seasons. After a brief stint as a pitching coach for the Cincinnati Reds 
under former player Pete Rose, he went on to become a sportscaster and 
for the next 22 years called games for the New York Yankees and the Minnesota 
Twins. Following a brief retirement in 2006, Jim Kaat was back in the broadcast 
booth calling Pool D for the 2009 World Baseball Classic in Puerto Rico, 
called games for NESN in 2009 (as a replacement for Jerry Remy), and currently 
calls games for the MLB Network as of the 2015 season.[1] He has written 
a best-selling book, Still Pitching, and has started a sports management 
company, Southpaw Enterprises, Inc., solely representing pitchers. In 2014, 
Kaat appeared for the second time as a candidate on the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot[2] for possible Hall 
of Fame consideration for 2015 which required 12 votes. He missed getting 
inducted in 2015 by 2 votes. None of the candidates on the ballot were 
elected.[3] The Committee meets and votes on ten selected candidates from 
the 1947 to 1972 era every three years.[4] Kaat attended Hope College in 
Holland, Michigan, and pitched for the Flying Dutchmen baseball team, before 
being signed by the Washington Senators as an amateur free agent in 1957. 
Kaat would spend all of 1957 and '58 in the minor leagues before breaking 
into the majors in 1959. After pitching in 16 games spread out over the 
next two seasons, Kaat became a permanent member of the pitching staff 
when the team moved west in 1961 to become the Minnesota Twins. On July 
24, 1963 Jim Kaat threw a complete-game shutout and hit a home run for 
a 5–0 Twins win over the Indians.[5] The combination has only happened 
three times in Minnesota history and Kaat did it twice (with the second 
coming on October 1, 1970).[6] On July 23, 1964, he would give up two home 
runs to Bert Campaneris, who was making his major league debut in the game.[7] 
Kaat was a member of the 1965 Twins team that won the American League pennant. 
He started three games in the 1965 World Series, matching up with Sandy 
Koufax on all three occasions, including a complete game victory in Game 
2. His best season was in 1966, when he won a league-leading 25 games. 
He finished fifth in the MVP voting and was named the American League Pitcher 
of the Year by The Sporting News. The National League's Sandy Koufax won 
the Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote; it was the last year in which only 
one award was given for both leagues. Although his 1967 season was somewhat 
of a let down after his near Cy Young in 1966 (he finished 16–13 with a 
3.04 ERA), he went on a tear in September and nearly pitched the Twins 
to another World Series appearance – cruising to a 7–0 record with a 1.51 
ERA and 65 strikeouts in 65 2⁄3 innings pitched. However another shot at 
a World Series title was not to be as Kaat sustained a season-ending arm 
injury in the third inning of the second to last game of the season and 
the Red Sox swept the final two games to win the American League pennant. 
Kaat was an All-Star three times (1962, 1966, 1975), and won the Gold Glove 
Award for defensive skill a record 16 consecutive times (1962–1977). His 
record for career Gold Gloves by a pitcher is now second to Greg Maddux's 
18. Kaat used the same baseball glove for 15 seasons.[8] Although Kaat 
would pitch a few games a year out of the bullpen, he was primarily a starting 
pitcher until 1979, when he became a relief pitcher in a season in which 
he split time between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees. With 
the Cardinals in 1982, Kaat earned his only World Series ring working in 
four games out of the bullpen in the 1982 World Series. In 1983 he became 
the last major league player to have played in the 1950s and the last "original" 
(pre-Twins) Washington Senator player to retire. Kaat is one of only 29 
players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games 
in four decades. At the time of his retirement, Kaat's 25-year career was 
the longest of any pitcher in major league history. He is now third all-time, 
behind Nolan Ryan's 27 seasons and Tommy John's 26 campaigns. Kaat also 
set a 20th Century record by playing during the administrations of seven 
U.S. Presidents – Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, 
Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jr., Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan. 
This mark was equaled by Nolan Ryan when he retired after the 1993 Season 
– the first year of the administration of Bill Clinton. Ryan first played 
in the major leagues in 1966, during the Johnson administration. Upon retirement, 
he served a short stint with the Cincinnati Reds as the club's pitching 
coach. When Pete Rose took over in 1984 as the Reds' player/manager, he 
made good on a promise to Kaat, his former Philadelphia Phillies teammate, 
and hired the former hurler for his coaching staff. Kaat would coach part 
of the 1984 season and all of 1985, a year in which he guided Cincinnati 
rookie Tom Browning to a 20–9 record. "At least I can say I had a 20-game 
winner every year I coached", Kaat used to joke. After retiring from baseball, 
he turned to broadcasting and is currently under contract with the MLB 
Network for which he does broadcasting and video and web blogs. As was 
stated during the television broadcast of the seventh game of the 1965 
World Series, Kaat was a broadcaster on local radio in Minnesota. He also 
served as an analyst for Home Team Sports during the 1981 baseball strike. 
Following retirement, he went into sports broadcasting full-time starting 
out as the chief baseball correspondent for Good Morning America from 1984–85.[9] 
His first stint with the Yankees was during the 1986 season, where he called 
around 100 games for WPIX.[10] He only lasted one season as the Yankees 
replaced him with Billy Martin, who was between managing stints and who 
was purposely brought in to second-guess Lou Piniella.[11] In between broadcasting 
stints for the Yankees, he spent six years (1988–1993) as an announcer 
for the Twins.[11] In 1986, Kaat was the backup annnouncer for NBC Sports' 
coverage of baseball with Phil Stone (for the April 19 Minnesota–California 
contest) and Jay Randolph (the July 14 Cincinnati–Atlanta contest).[11] 
In 1988, he covered the College World Series and the MLB playoffs and World 
Series for ESPN and also served as an analyst for NBC's coverage of the 
1988 Summer Olympics.[9] From 1990–1993, Kaat served as an analyst for 
CBS television, teaming with Dick Stockton and then, Greg Gumbel (for whom 
Kaat also called the College World Series with for CBS from 1990–1993) 
in 1993. Besides calling four American League Championship Series for CBS 
(1990–1993), Kaat served as a field reporter with Lesley Visser (1990–1992) 
and Andrea Joyce (1991) during the World Series. Kaat also covered three 
World Series Trophy presentations for CBS (1990–1992). Over the course 
of Game 2 of the 1992 ALCS, Kaat was stricken with a bad case of laryngitis.[12] 
As a result, Johnny Bench had to come over from the CBS Radio booth and 
finish the game with Dick Stockton as a "relief analyst."[13] There was 
talk that if Kaat's laryngitis did not get better, Don Drysdale was going 
to replace Kaat on TV for Game 3 while Bench would continue to work on 
CBS Radio. In 1993, he filled in for Lesley Visser until late August as 
CBS' primary field reporter after she suffered injuries in a bizarre jogging 
accident in New York City's Central Park.[14] In 1994, he was the lead 
analyst on Baseball Tonight for ESPN's coverage of Major League Baseball. 
In 1995, he was nominated for a New York Emmy Award for "On Camera Achievement." 
Also in 1995, Kaat called the American League playoffs with Brent Musburger 
for ABC/The Baseball Network including the Yankees–Seattle Mariners Division 
Series.[9] He served his second stint as an announcer for Yankees games 
on the MSG Network/YES Network (1995–2006),[11] where his straight-shooting 
style was much in the mode of former Yankees broadcasters Tony Kubek and 
Bill White. In addition, he was on the team which won the "Outstanding 
Live Sports Coverage – Single Program" New York Emmy for covering Dwight 
Gooden's no-hitter on May 14, 1996 and David Wells's perfect game on May 
17, 1998. Towards the end of his second stint with the Yankees, his workload 
decreased. In 2006, he only broadcast 65 games.[15] Despite his decreased 
work load, Kaat won another Emmy for on-air achievement in 2006. In an 
on-air broadcast on September 10, 2006 with booth partner Ken Singleton, 
Kaat acknowledged his plan to end his broadcasting career. His final appearance 
in the booth was to be a Yankee–Red Sox game on September 15, 2006 (Kaat 
was also set to throw out the first pitch). However, the game was postponed 
due to rain. Kaat later announced that he was going to record a special 
farewell message to the fans, but would not return for any additional broadcasts. 
However, the following day, Kaat did announce one full inning of the first 
game of Saturday September 16's doubleheader on Fox along with Tim McCarver 
and Josh Lewin. During that Fox telecast he was able to say goodbye to 
the Yankee fans, an opportunity that the previous night's rainout had deprived 
him of doing on the YES Network. After his retirement from calling Yankees 
games full-time, Kaat has made several single-game appearances on various 
networks. Kaat made a special one-inning appearance, during the third inning, 
on the YES Network on June 30, 2008 during a Yankees–Rangers game. He also 
appeared live via telephone, during a Yankees–Blue Jays game on July 13, 
2008, to discuss the recent death of Bobby Murcer. He joined the TBS Sunday 
Baseball team, for a single game on May 4, 2008. In 2009, Kaat joined the 
recently launched MLB Network as a color commentator for their Thursday 
Night Baseball series. Kaat also writes a weekly on-line blog for the Yankees 
(YES) Network, Kaat's Korner, and contributes video blogs and interviews 
regularly with national and international media outlets. One of the reasons 
he got back into regular broadcasting was because after his wife died, 
Tim McCarver and Elizabeth Schumacher, his friend and business manager, 
urged him to get back into the game. He also called Pool D in Puerto Rico 
for the 2009 World Baseball Classic games for an international feed.[16] 
From 1997–2005, Kaat won 7 Emmy Awards for excellence in sports broadcasting:[citation 
needed] Jim Kaat's marriages to his first wife, Julie, and his second wife, 
Linda, ended in divorce. Jim Kaat's third wife, MaryAnn Kaat, died in July 
2008 after 22 years of marriage. Jim Kaat created a memorial fund in her 
name to put lights on the baseball fields in his hometown of Zeeland, Michigan 
in her honor.[17] Jim and MaryAnn have 4 children and 6 grandchildren.
