Frank Elmer Smith (October 28, 1879 – November 3, 1952) was a right-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1904 to 1915. He played for the Chicago 
White Sox, Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Baltimore Terrapins, and Brooklyn 
Tip-Tops. Nicknamed "Piano Mover" because that was his offseason job,[1] 
Smith was a mainstay of the White Sox pitching staff during the early 20th 
century. He pitched two no-hitters and won over 20 games in two different 
seasons. He stood at 5' 10" and weighed 194 lbs.[2] Smith was born in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania. After attending Grove City College, he started his professional 
baseball career in 1901 in the Virginia-North Carolina League. In 1903, 
he went 18–13 on the mound.[3] He was drafted by the White Sox in September.[2] 
Smith made his major league debut in April 1904. That season, he was taught 
how to throw a spitball by Elmer Stricklett and was able to harness the 
pitch on his way to 16 wins.[4] In 1905, he improved to 19 wins. Smith 
threw his first no-hitter, against the Detroit Tigers, on September 6, 
and the final score (15–0) was the most lopsided in a no-hitter in American 
League history.[4] Smith did not allow a home run in either 1904 or 1905 
and kept his earned run average under 2.20 in both seasons, as well.[2] 
The "Piano Mover" slumped in 1906, going just 5–5 with a 3.39 ERA. The 
White Sox won the World Series that year, but Smith did not pitch in the 
six games. The next season, he bounced back with 23 wins, although his 
ERA+ was below 100 and he also led the league in walks. He then lowered 
his ERA to 2.03 in 1908.[2] On September 20, he pitched his second no-hitter, 
this time against the Philadelphia Athletics. He won the game 1–0 when 
Chicago scored the only run in the bottom of the ninth inning.[5] Smith 
was the only pitcher in team history to throw two no-hitters before Mark 
Buehrle accomplished the feat over 100 years later.[6] Smith had his best 
statistical season in 1909.[5] Finally the White Sox staff ace, he pitched 
a career-high 365 innings and went 25–17 with a 1.80 ERA. He led all AL 
pitchers in games started, innings pitched, and strikeouts, and he finished 
second in wins.[2] In 1910, Smith started off 4–9 and was traded to the 
Red Sox in August. He was then sold to the Reds in 1911.[2] Smith spent 
1912 and 1913 in the International League and led the league in innings 
pitched in 1913 while winning 21 games.[7] He finished his career with 
two seasons in the Federal League.[2] After his baseball career ended, 
Smith went back to the moving business.[4] He died in 1952, of Bright's
