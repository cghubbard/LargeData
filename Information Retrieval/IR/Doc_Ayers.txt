Yancey Wyatt "Doc" Ayers (May 21, 1891 – May 26, 1968) was an American 
pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was known for throwing the spitball, 
and was one of the 17 pitchers allowed to continue throwing the pitch after 
it was outlawed in 1920. Ayers played nine seasons in the American League 
with the Washington Senators (1913–19) and Detroit Tigers (1919–21). He 
batted and threw right-handed. Ayers was the opposing pitcher for the Senators 
on June 23, 1917, against the Boston Red Sox. Ernie Shore relieved starting 
pitcher Babe Ruth after the first batter walked and Ruth was ejected for 
arguing with the umpire. The runner was caught stealing, and Shore retired 
the next 26 batters for a no-hitter. Manager Clark Griffith removed Ayers 
for a pinch-hitter in the ninth inning. Ayers was a noted spitball pitcher 
who was allowed to throw the pitch after it had been banned in the major 
leagues after the 1919 season, having received special permission to do 
so. In 1920, he struck out 103 batters and led the American League in strikeouts 
per nine innings (4.44). In 299 career games, Ayers posted a 65–79 win–loss
