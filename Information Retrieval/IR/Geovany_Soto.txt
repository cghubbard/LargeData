Geovany Soto (born January 20, 1983) is a Puerto Rican professional baseball 
catcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, Oakland Athletics, Chicago White Sox 
and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He has appeared in the MLB All-Star 
Game and was named the National League Rookie of the Year in 2008. Selected 
by the Chicago Cubs 318th overall in the 11th round of the 2001 Major League 
Baseball draft, he made his major league debut on September 23, 2005, against 
the Houston Astros. He was recalled by the Cubs on July 12, 2007, but only 
had 1 hit in 7 at-bats.[1] In September 2007, when the Cubs expanded their 
roster, he joined the team again. This was mainly because, in the minor 
leagues that year, he batted .353 with 26 home runs and 109 RBI and was 
named the Pacific Coast League's MVP while playing for the Iowa Cubs.[2] 
After his call-up in September, Soto had an average of .389.[1] Soto started 
for the Cubs during the 2007 playoff series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
In game 2 of the series, Soto hit a home run into the left field bleachers 
at Chase Field, giving the Cubs an early 2–0 lead. The Cubs ended up losing 
that game, but it further solidified him as the Cubs' full-time catcher 
going into 2008, with Jason Kendall moving on to Milwaukee as a free agent. 
Arguably the best offensive performance in Soto's career came April 30, 
2008, in a rout against the Brewers. Soto hit two 3-run homers to account 
for 6 of the Cubs' 19 RBIs, only a few days removed from a two-game stretch 
against the Nationals in which he struck out in 8 consecutive at-bats. 
Soto was voted the National League Rookie of the Month for April 2008 after 
hitting .341 with 5 home runs, 8 doubles, and 20 RBIs, with an OPS of 1.059.[3] 
On May 19, 2008, he scored his first career Inside-the-park home run against 
the Houston Astros.[4] Soto led the early stage of the voting process for 
the National League's catcher in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game.[5] He was selected to be the National League's starting catcher in 
the game. Soto became the first rookie catcher ever to start on the National 
League All-Star team.[6] Soto is the first Cubs' All-Star rookie to play 
in the game with at least 14 home runs since Rafael Palmeiro did it in 
1987, surpassing the mark when he hit his 15th home run on July 6, 2008.[7] 
He went 3 for 5 with 7 RBIs in a game on August 26 against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[8] As a rookie catcher, Soto called a no-hitter game from behind 
the plate to pitcher Carlos Zambrano in a game against the Houston Astros 
on September 14, 2008.[9] Played at Miller Park in Milwaukee due to Hurricane 
Ike moving through Houston, this was the first no-hitter in major league 
history pitched at a neutral site. After the 2008 season, Soto was honored 
with the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and the Major League Baseball 
Rookie of the Year Award for the National League.[10][11] Soto posted a 
.285 batting average, along with 23 home runs and 86 RBI's.[12]Soto won 
the award in a landslide, receiving 31 of 32 first place votes.[13] Soto 
is the first Cubs' backstop to play for multiple Cub playoff teams since 
Gabby Hartnett, and is the first to start playoff games in consecutive 
years since Johnny Kling. Soto also won the Pedrín Zorrilla Award, receiving 
unanimous support during the voting process.[14] Orlando Cepeda was contacted 
to present the award, traveling to Puerto Rico for the ceremony.[14] Soto 
was unable to live up to huge expectations in 2009, only posting a .218 
batting average and 47 RBI. In June 2009, Soto was revealed to have tested 
positive for marijuana at the World Baseball Classic.[15] While the MLB 
did not take any disciplinary actions, the International Baseball Federation 
has banned him from playing internationally for two years.[16] In 2010, 
Soto batted .280 with 17 home runs.[17] In 2011, Soto batted .228 with 
17 home runs.[17] He led major league catchers in errors committed, with 
13, and had the lowest fielding percentage, at .987.[18][19] On July 30, 
2012, Soto was traded to the Texas Rangers for right-handed pitcher Jake 
Brigham.[20] In 47 games with Texas in 2012, he hit .196 with 5 HR and 
25 RBI. Soto spent 2013 as the backup catcher to A. J. Pierzynski. On June 
4, 2013, Soto played his first career game at third base. On July 29, Soto 
hit a walk-off home run against the Angels. The Rangers entered the bottom 
of the ninth down by 1 before Pierzynski, the designated hitter, hit a 
solo home run to tie the game. In 54 games in 2013, Soto hit .245/.328/.466 
with 9 HR and 22 RBI. On November 5, Soto signed a one-year, $3.05 million 
deal with incentives with the Rangers to be their primary catcher.[21] 
Due to injuries to his knee and foot, Soto was on the disabled list for 
the first half of the 2014 season.[22] On July 9, 2014, Soto was arrested 
on a charge of cocaine possession.[23] On August 24, 2014, the Rangers 
traded Soto to the Oakland Athletics for cash considerations.[24] He appeared 
in 11 games and batted .262 with 8 RBI. Soto signed a minor league deal 
with the Chicago White Sox on January 22, 2015.[25] On November 24, 2015, 
Soto signed a one-year, $2.8 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels
