Carsten Charles "CC" Sabathia, Jr. (born July 21, 1980) is an American 
professional baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees. Upon signing with 
the Yankees prior to the 2009 season, Sabathia became the highest-paid 
pitcher in MLB history. He is listed at 6'7" and 290 pounds. Sabathia played 
the first seven and a half seasons of his career with the Cleveland Indians, 
where he won the 2007 Cy Young Award. He played the second half of the 
2008 MLB season with the Milwaukee Brewers, leading them to the Wild Card, 
their first playoff appearance in 26 years. In the offseason, Sabathia 
left via free agency and signed with the New York Yankees. Sabathia is 
regarded as one of the most durable pitchers in MLB, having amassed an 
average of over 200 innings pitched per season during his career. Sabathia 
was born in Vallejo, California and attended Vallejo High School, where 
he excelled in baseball, basketball, and football. As a teenager, Sabathia 
played summer baseball in the Major League Baseball youth program, Reviving 
Baseball in Inner cities (RBI).[1] In baseball, he compiled a win–loss 
record of 6–0 with an 0.77 earned run average (ERA) with 14 hits, and 82 
strikeouts in 45 2⁄3 innings pitched during his senior season. Coming out 
of the draft he was the top high school prospect in Northern California 
according to Baseball America. In football, he was an all-conference tight 
end. He received scholarship offers to play college football, including 
one from UCLA, and signed a letter of intent to attend the University of 
Hawaiʻi.[2] Sabathia was drafted in the first round (20th overall) by the 
Indians in the 1998 MLB draft. He signed for a $1.3 million bonus. In 2000, 
he was selected for the 28-man United States Olympic Team roster. He appeared 
in one pre-Olympic tournament game in Sydney, Australia, but was not on 
the official 24-man, Gold Medal-winning roster because he was called up 
by the Cleveland Indians. He was named the Indians' 2000 Minor League Player 
of the Year (receiving the "Lou Boudreau Award").[3][4] In 2001, he was 
the youngest player in the Major Leagues. Sabathia led the league in hits 
per 9 innings pitched (7.44), was third in the league in win–loss percentage 
(17–5, .773), fourth in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (8.53), sixth 
in wins, and seventh in strikeouts (171). He finished second in the AL 
voting for Rookie of the Year, behind only Ichiro Suzuki. Sabathia signed 
a four-year $9.5 million contract with the Indians, with a club option 
for 2006, on February 23, 2002.[5] In the 2002 season, he was tenth in 
the AL in strikeouts, with 149.[6] In 2003, he had the tenth-best ERA in 
the AL (3.60). He was also named to the American League All-Star team for 
the first time. Sabathia made his second All-Star selection in a row as 
he finished the 2004 season by going 11–10 with a 4.12 ERA and 139 strikeouts.[6] 
The Indians picked up their $7 million club option for 2006 on April 27, 
2005 and Sabathia signed a two-year, $17.75 million deal.[7] In 2005, he 
was fourth in the AL in strikeouts/9 IP (7.37), seventh in strikeouts (161) 
and eighth in wins (15). This marked his fifth straight season of double 
digit wins to open a career. He threw the fastest fastball in the AL in 
2005, averaging 94.7 miles per hour.[8] He also hit his first career home 
run as a batter in interleague play off of Ryan Dempster in May. The Indians 
went 20–11 in his starts. In 2006, he led the major leagues with 6 complete 
games. He also led the AL in shutouts (2), was third in ERA (3.22), sixth 
in strikeouts per 9 IP (8.03) and eighth in strikeouts (172). He became 
the first left-handed pitcher to start his career with six consecutive 
seasons of double digit wins.[9] Sabathia collected his 1,000th career 
strikeout on May 21, fanning the player who beat him out for Rookie of 
the Year honors: Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. He was also named 
to the American League All-Star team for the third time. On September 28, 
he became the youngest pitcher (27 years, 69 days) to record 100 career 
wins since Greg Maddux in 1993. On October 23, Sabathia won the Players 
Choice Award for Outstanding AL Pitcher.[10] His pitching performance led 
the Cleveland Indians to their first American League Central Division Championship 
since 2001, his rookie season. For his performance, he was awarded the 
2007 American League Cy Young Award joining Gaylord Perry as the only two 
Cleveland Indians pitchers to ever win the award. (Cliff Lee and Cory Kluber 
have since also won.) [11] Sabathia also won the Warren Spahn Award given 
to the best left-handed pitcher in the Majors.[12] Despite his strong regular 
season, Sabathia did not perform well against the Boston Red Sox in the 
American League Championship Series. In two starts, he went 0–2 with a 
10.45 ERA. Sabathia began the 2008 season 6–8 with a 3.83 ERA in 18 starts. 
He was leading the American League in strikeouts (123) and strikeouts per 
9.0 innings (9.0) while ranking second in innings pitched (122.1) and tied 
for second in complete games (3). However, with the Indians out of playoff 
contention, and with Sabathia an impending free agent, the Indians sought 
to trade Sabathia. At the time Sabathia departed Cleveland, he was fifth 
in club history in strikeouts (1,265) and sixth in strikeouts per 9.0 innings 
(7.448), and his 2007 strikeouts-to-walks ratio was a single-season best 
5.649.[13] On July 7, 2008, Sabathia was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers 
for Matt LaPorta, Michael Brantley, Zach Jackson and Rob Bryson.[14][15] 
During his press conference, Sabathia made it known to the assembled members 
of the media that he would prefer his name to be spelled "CC" rather than 
"C.C."[16] He recorded his first win with the Brewers on July 8, 2008 against 
the Colorado Rockies. Sabathia was 17–10 overall (11–2 with Milwaukee) 
with a 2.70 ERA and was second in the majors (behind Tim Lincecum) with 
251 strikeouts. Sabathia pitched three complete games in his first four 
starts with the Brewers, winning all four. On July 30, 2008, Sabathia took 
out a large $12,870 ad in the sports section of Cleveland's daily newspaper, 
The Plain Dealer. The ad, signed by Sabathia, his wife Amber, and his family 
read: Thank you for 10 great years ... You've touched our lives with your 
kindness, love and generosity. We are forever grateful! It's been a privilege 
and an honor![17] On August 31, 2008, Sabathia threw what was ruled as 
a one-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates in PNC Park. The one hit for 
the Pirates came off of a check swing by Andy LaRoche in the fifth inning 
that rolled fair and was bobbled by Sabathia on an attempted bare-handed 
pickup. The team sent in an appeal to Major League Baseball to try to get 
the hit ruled as an error, but were unsuccessful.[18] Sabathia struck out 
eleven in the Brewers' 7–0 win over the Pirates, making Sabathia's ninth 
complete game in the 2008 season. On September 28, 2008, Sabathia pitched 
a 4-hitter against the Cubs to win 3–1 in the final game of the season, 
clinching the wild card for the Brewers—their first-ever postseason berth 
as a National League club and their first since losing to the St. Louis 
Cardinals in the 1982 World Series. It was Sabathia's 10th complete game 
of the year, the most complete games by any pitcher in a single season 
since Randy Johnson threw 12 in 1999. In 2008 Sabathia had the most effective 
slider among major league starting pitchers.[19] When batters swung at 
his pitches, they failed to make any contact 28% of the time, the highest 
percentage among major league starting pitchers.[20] Sabathia started game 
2 of the NLDS against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Brewers were heavily 
favored to win behind Sabathia, but Sabathia faltered, surrendering 5 runs 
in 3 2⁄3 innings, including a walk to the pitcher Brett Myers and a grand 
slam to Shane Victorino. The Phillies would go on to win the World Series 
against the Tampa Bay Rays. Sabathia was sixth in the voting for the 2008 
NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols of the Cardinals, Ryan Howard of the 
Phillies, Ryan Braun also of the Brewers, Manny Ramirez of the Dodgers, 
and Lance Berkman of the Astros.[21] On December 18, 2008, Sabathia signed 
a seven-year, $161 million contract with the New York Yankees. It was the 
largest contract for a pitcher in MLB history until 2013 when Félix Hernández 
of the Seattle Mariners signed a seven-year $175 million contract.[22][23] 
On March 26, 2009, manager Joe Girardi announced that Sabathia would be 
the Opening Day starter and the starter for the home opener at the new 
Yankee Stadium.[24] Sabathia won his first championship ring with the Yankees, 
finishing 19–8 with a 3.37 ERA. Sabathia also won the American League Championship 
Series (ALCS) Most Valuable Player Award for his performance in the 2009 
ALCS. Sabathia finished fourth in the AL Cy Young Award voting behind Zack 
Greinke, Félix Hernández, and Justin Verlander. On April 10, 2010, Sabathia 
took a no-hitter into the 8th inning. With two outs in the inning, former 
teammate Kelly Shoppach ripped a single to left field, ending the no-hit 
bid.[25] On July 4, he earned his fourth All-Star selection, and his first 
as a Yankee. On August 22, Sabathia recorded his 16th consecutive start 
of at least six innings allowing three earned runs or less, breaking a 
tie with Ron Guidry (from his Cy Young Award winning 1978 season) for the 
longest streak in franchise history.[26] On September 18, he defeated the 
Baltimore Orioles to become baseball's first 20-game winner in 2010. The 
win also marks the first time he had ever won 20 games in a single season 
in his career.[27] Sabathia had won 19 games in a season twice previously: 
in 2007 with the Indians and 2009 in his first season with the Yankees. 
During the offseason, Sabathia was diagnosed with a torn meniscus in his 
right knee, requiring arthroscopic surgery performed by Dr. Christopher 
Ahmad to repair. Sabathia began therapy immediately after the surgery and 
began his regular routine in preparation for spring training after three 
to six weeks.[28][29] He lost from 25 to 30 pounds to prevent future problems 
with his knee.[30] On July 26, 2011, Sabathia took a perfect game through 
6 1⁄3 innings against the Seattle Mariners, retiring the first 19 batters 
he faced in a game interrupted twice due to rain. He ended up striking 
out 14 batters through 7 innings(setting a career high), and pitching another 
one-hitter, this one, a combined one-hitter. Sabathia was pulled before 
recording an out in the 8th after walking three batters to load the bases; 
relief pitchers David Robertson and Mariano Rivera finished the game, with 
Robertson allowing only one run (charged to Sabathia) on a double-play 
ground ball that would have ended the inning, but was bobbled by third 
baseman Eric Chavez.[31] For his performance in July 2011, Sabathia was 
named AL Pitcher of the Month. He posted a 4–1 record with a 0.92 ERA during 
the month, striking out 50 batters and walking 13 in 39 innings. He also 
pitched two complete games and one shutout.[32] Sabathia recorded his 2,000th 
career strikeout on September 10, 2011 against Torii Hunter of the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[33] In 2011, Sabatha had a 19–8 record, 3.00 
ERA, 230 strikeouts, 237 1⁄3 innings pitched and a 1.21 WHIP. Though his 
contract contained an opt-out clause that allowed him to become a free 
agent after the 2011 season, Sabathia said he had no intention of exercising 
it as he loves playing for the New York Yankees and his family loves life 
in New York.[34][35] On October 31, 2011, Sabathia announced via his Twitter 
account that he would not be exercising his opt-out clause and had signed 
an extension with the Yankees. The extension was for an additional year 
on his original seven-year contract, worth $25 million, along with a $25 
million vesting option with a $5 million buyout for the following year.[36][37] 
He finished fourth in Cy Young voting after the season.[38] Sabathia began 
the 2012 season with bad footing as he allowed a grand slam by Carlos Peña 
in his first inning of work on opening day against the Tampa Bay Rays.[39] 
He recovered, however, going 9–3 with a 3.55 ERA in his first 14 starts. 
He threw a complete game against the Atlanta Braves on June 18.[40] In 
the 2012 American League Division Series, Sabathia won the first and fifth 
(deciding) games against the Baltimore Orioles, but lost Game Four of the 
ALCS, allowing the Detroit Tigers to sweep the Yankees. On October 25, 
2012, Sabathia underwent arthroscopic surgery in his left elbow to remove 
a bone spur.[41] In 2013, Sabathia's velocity decrease has been caused 
him to be a pitcher that had to rely more on location rather than velocity.[citation 
needed] On July 3, 2013, Sabathia collected his 200th career win against 
the Minnesota Twins.[42] His season ended early due to a strained hamstring, 
finishing with a 14–13 record and a career-high 4.78 ERA.[43] Sabathia 
lost 40 pounds in 2013 and showed up to spring training in 2014 weighing 
275 pounds. He admitted to crash dieting after a cousin of his died of 
heart disease in December 2012.[44][45] On May 12, 2014, Sabathia was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list due to right knee inflammation. Fluid buildup 
was detected in the knee and the buildup was drained by a shot with no 
surgery required. Seeking a second opinion with Dr. James Andrews, he received 
a stem-cell shot in the knee. Sabathia was transferred to the 60-day disabled 
list on July 1 (retroactive to May 11) being sidelined until early to mid-July 
or later. After making a rehab appearance with the Double-A Trenton Thunder, 
Sabathia began to experience swelling in his right knee, putting his season 
in jeopardy. The Yankees projected that Sabathia might need microfracture 
surgery, which could potentially end his career. On July 16, it was announced 
that Sabathia's 2014 season had ended. In only 8 starts in 2014, Sabathia 
went 3-4 with a 5.28 ERA. He underwent surgery on July 23 to repair his 
degenerated knee. Luckily, he did not need microfracture surgery.[46] Sabathia 
reported to spring training weighing 305 pounds (138 kg), as he believed 
his decreased weight contributed to his poor 2014 season.[47] During a 
game against the Angels on June 7, 2015, Sabathia recorded his 2,500th 
career strikeout but was later ejected along with Joe Girardi for getting 
into a confrontation with MLB umpire Dan Bellino following a double play.[48] 
Sabathia went on the disabled list after leaving the game of August 23 
with right knee soreness. He had a 4-9 record with a 5.27 ERA in 24 games 
started to that point.[49] He returned to the Yankees on September 9 wearing 
a knee brace.[50] He pitched to a 2.17 ERA in five starts after returning, 
including winning the game that clinched the Yankees a playoff berth in 
the 2015 American League Wild Card Game.[51] On May 6, 2016, Sabathia was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a left groin strain. On May 20, 
Sabathia recorded his 100th win as a New York Yankee in a 8-3 victory over 
the Oakland Athletics, going 6 innings allowing 1 run and striking out 
8.[52] Making 30 starts in 2016, Sabathia finished 9-12 with a 3.91 ERA. 
On October 11, Sabathia underwent surgery on his right knee, described 
as a routine cleanup.[53] Despite throwing with his left hand as well as 
batting from the left, Sabathia is right-handed.[54] Sabathia has five 
pitches: a cutter (89–92 MPH), a more used two-seam/sinker fastball (88–92 
MPH), a curve ball (74-76 MPH), a slider (78–82 MPH),[55] and changeup 
(82–84 MPH).[56] Once ahead in the count, he primarily uses his changeup 
to strike out right-handed batters, and his slider to strike out left-handers.[57] 
He also exhibits good command of his pitches, posting a 5.65 K/BB ratio 
in 2007.[58] Sabathia holds a lifetime postseason record of 9 wins and 
5 losses in 19 games. He has pitched a total of 61 1⁄3 postseason innings, 
giving up 61 hits, 25 walks and 30 earned runs resulting in a 4.40 ERA. 
He also struck out 56 batters.[59] As of the end of the 2014 season, Sabathia 
has acquired 25 hits in 115 plate appearances,[60] making him one of the 
more successful pitchers from a hitting standpoint. On one occasion, Sabathia 
hit a 440-foot home run on June 21, 2008, off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher 
Chan Ho Park.[61] He commented later, saying "I told everybody I was trying 
to hit homers today because I had two singles last year and everybody was 
all over me, saying I was a singles hitter. It was awesome."[62] On July 
13, 2008, in his second game with the Brewers, Sabathia hit his second 
home run of the season off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Homer Bailey, becoming 
the third pitcher in history to homer in both leagues in the same season 
and the first since Earl Wilson did it in 1970 with Detroit and San Diego.[63] 
Sabathia's reputation of pitching a high number of effective innings each 
season has led to sports broadcasters often referring to him as a workhorse.[64] 
Sabathia has the most lifetime complete games of any active pitcher, with 
37 as of the end of 2013. Sabathia and his wife, Amber, have four children: 
a son Carsten Charles III (born 2003), a daughter Jaeden Arie (born 2005), 
a daughter, Cyia (born 2008), and a son Carter (born 2010). The family 
lived in Fairfield, California outside his hometown of Vallejo, California 
near San Francisco until he signed with the Yankees. Then the family moved 
to Alpine, New Jersey. The family loves life in New Jersey and being so 
close to New York City.[65] Nevertheless, Sabathia remains connected to 
his hometown. On January 27, 2012, Vallejo High School honored Sabathia 
by declaring it "CC Sabathia Day" and renaming the school's baseball field 
in his honor. Sabathia also appeared on a promotional video for Battlefield 
Bad Company 2 against "Random Grenade Throws" which showed him doing a 
public service announcement about random grenade throws. It spoofs the 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 public service announcement with Philadelphia 
Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels. Sabathia remains very close friends with 
former teammates Cliff Lee and Prince Fielder.[66] Sabathia is a supporter 
of Crutches4Kids. He is an Oakland Raiders fan. Sabathia operates a charity, 
the PitCChIn Foundation, which supports inner city children. In 2014, the 
foundation supported a team of runners in the 2014 New York City Marathon, 
consisting of Amber, the wife of Amar'e Stoudemire, Tiki Barber and Angie 
Martinez.[67] On October 5, 2015, Sabathia announced that he was checking 
himself into an alcohol treatment center.[68] During the previous weekend, 
Sabathia had been binge drinking in the hotel while the Yankees were on 
the road in Baltimore, including drinking in the clubhouse after a game
