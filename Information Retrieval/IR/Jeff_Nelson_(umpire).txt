Jeffrey Brian Nelson (born on June 1, 1965) is an umpire in Major League 
Baseball who was named to the National League staff prior to the 1999 season, 
and has worked throughout both major leagues since 2000. Nelson, a graduate 
of Bethel University in St. Paul, Minnesota, wears uniform number 45. He 
was promoted to crew chief starting for the 2014 season. Nelson was named 
Top Prospect at the Joe Brinkman Umpiring School in 1989. He was promoted 
to the National League prior to the 1999 season along with Paul Nauert 
to fill vacancies left by the retirements of Jim Quick and Harry Wendelstedt. 
While in the minor leagues, Nelson was the chief rules instructor at the 
former Brinkman-Froemming umpire school in Cocoa, Florida from 1997 until 
the school's closing in 1998. He continues to teach at umpire clinics in 
the off-season. Additionally, Nelson is currently the secretary/treasurer 
of the major league umpires' union, the World Umpires Association. During 
his career, Nelson has received several postseason assignments, including 
the 2005 World Series, 2009 World Series and the 2014 World Series. He 
also worked the League Championship Series in 2002, 2004, 2010, 2011, 2012

he was assigned to Crew G with crew chief Jeff Kellogg, Larry Vanover and

Nelson ejected New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi for arguing a missed 
call at second base after Nelson incorrectly ruled that Detroit Tiger Omar 
Infante was safe. Nelson later acknowledged his safe call was wrong.[1] 
In Game 6 of the 2015 American League Championship Series, Nelson called 
two controversial strikes against the Toronto Blue Jays in the ninth inning 
in their game against the Kansas City Royals, one of them against Ben Revere

home plate when Mark McGwire hit his 500th home run, and worked the game 
in which Rickey Henderson made his 3000th hit. He served as the second
