Riverside South is an urban development project in the Lincoln Square neighborhood 
of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City. It was originated by 
six civic associations – Municipal Art Society, Natural Resources Defense 
Council, New Yorkers for Parks, Regional Plan Association, Riverside Park 
Fund, and Westpride – in partnership with Donald Trump. The largely residential 
complex, located on the site of a former New York Central Railroad yard, 
includes Trump Place and Riverside Center. The $3 billion project is on 
57 acres (23 ha) of land along the Hudson River between 59th Street and 
72nd Street. Development of the rail yard site generated considerable community 
opposition. Trump's 1970s-era proposal was opposed and failed to gain traction. 
In 1982, Lincoln West, a much smaller project, was approved with community 
support, but the developers failed to obtain financing. Planning for the 
current project began in the late 1980s. The project was originally designed 
to include 16 apartment buildings with a maximum of 5,700 residential units, 
1,800,000 square feet (170,000 m2) of studio space, 300,000 square feet 
(30,000 m2) of office space, ancillary retail space, and a 25-acre (10 ha) 
waterfront park. Trump sold Riverside South to investors from Hong Kong 
and China, who began construction in 1997. In 2005, the investors sold 
the remaining unfinished portions to the Carlyle Group and the Extell Development 
Company. The land for the development was formerly a rail freight yard 
owned by the New York Central Railroad, located between 59th and 72nd streets. 
By 1849 an embankment near West End Avenue, with a span over a tidal lagoon, 
carried the Hudson River Railroad, later part of New York Central. At the 
time the current site of Riverside South was still underwater.[2] By 1880, 
what had been river was transformed by landfill into the New York Central 
Railroad’s vast 60th Street Yard.[2][3] New York Central's rail track north 
of 72nd Street was covered in the 1930s in a Robert Moses project, part 
of a vast "West Side Improvement" which separated rail lines from surface 
traffic throughout the length of the West Side.[4][5]:696–698 The Moses 
project was bigger than Hoover Dam and created the Henry Hudson Parkway. 
It also created Riverside Park in such a way that the park and road look 
like they are set on a natural slope.[5]:698–700 Until the 1970s, the rail 
yard area was generally industrial.[2] The area was home to a printing 
plant for The New York Times between 1959 and 1975,[6] as well as ABC television 
studios. At the same time, public housing extended to West End Avenue (across 
the street from the printing plant and the TV studios), and the Lincoln 
Towers redevelopment project extended to the rail yard boundary along Freedom 
Place. In 1962, the railroad proposed a partnership with the Amalgamated 
Lithographers Union to build a mixed-use development with 5,300 apartments, 
"Litho City," on a platform over the tracks and on landfill in the Hudson 
River.[7] Litho City was conceived as the centerpiece of a grandiose "master 
plan" for the entire Lincoln Square area.[8] In the late 1960s, there were 
various proposals by the city's Educational Construction Fund for mixed 
residential and school projects, also partly on landfill.[9] New York Central 
merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad to form Penn Central in 1968 as the 
rail lines were suffering severe financial difficulties that would ultimately 
lead to the demise of both. (The rail yard was known as the "Penn Yards" 
even though Penn Central only owned it for a brief period.) The railroad 
finally went bankrupt in 1971, and the use was discontinued.[9] After Penn 
Central's bankruptcy, real estate developer Donald Trump first optioned 
the property for $10 million in 1974.[10] His proposal for 12,450 apartments 
depended on public financing, which never materialized.[11][12] One version 
had a relocated highway and a pseudo-park.[13] The Macri Group, an Argentine 
company, bought the property in partnership with investor Abe Hirschfeld 
in 1979, and in 1982, for the first time, a redevelopment plan was approved 
for the site – a 7,300,000-square-foot (680,000 m2), largely residential 
project named Lincoln West.[14][15] However, the development team was unable 
to obtain financing, and the project died. Subsequently, in January 1985, 
Trump bought the rights of the Macri Group for $95 million.[16] Trump proposed 
building a vast complex he called Television City, featuring headquarters 
for NBC along with television studios. The plan involved 15,500,000 square 
feet (1,440,000 m2) of residential, retail, office, and studio construction, 
including 7,600 residential units, a parking garage, a shopping mall, a 
hotel, and other spaces. The centerpiece of the project, designed by Helmut 
Jahn, was to be a 150- to 152-story tower, dubbed the "World's Tallest 
Building."[17][18] However, since the new plan was more than twice the 
size of the previously approved project, Television City generated fierce 
opposition.[19] One year later, the project was redesigned by Alexander 
Cooper and downsized slightly to 14,500,000 square feet (1,350,000 m2), 
but that failed to satisfy critics.[20] NBC, fearing delays, eventually 
decided to continue broadcasting from Rockefeller Center.[21] Trump then 
removed the studio space in favor of open space, added office buildings, 
and renamed the project Trump City.[22] In 1989, six civic organizations 
proposed an alternative plan devised by Daniel Gutman, an environmental 
planner, and Paul Willen, an architect.[23] Known as Riverside South, this 
civic alternative was a largely residential project of 7,300,000 square 
feet (680,000 m2), the previously approved floor area, based on relocating, 
and partially burying the West Side Highway to make room for a 23-acre 
(9.3 ha) expansion of Riverside Park, mirroring the design of Riverside 
Park further north.[24] To create the park, Trump City's proposed shopping 
mall would be removed and the elevated West Side Highway would be relocated 
eastward to grade and buried. A new Riverside Boulevard would curve above 
the relocated highway, with the park sloping down toward the river.[25] 
Hobbled by his weak financial position, Trump acquiesced and formed a partnership 
with his critics, formally the Riverside South Planning Corporation (RSPC).[26] 
With a master plan by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill,[12][27] the RSPC compromise 
project was approved in 1992 without the television studios and office 
space that Trump had substituted for some of the residential space.[28] 
The final project size was 6,100,000 square feet (570,000 m2) with 1,800,000 
square feet (170,000 m2) of television studios still possible on the two 
southern blocks. A new Riverside Boulevard would curve above the relocated 
highway, forming the western edge of the development, with the park sloping 
down toward he river.[29] Aside from a major new park, the community was 
promised a significant enhancement to Freedom Place, an existing four-block 
street behind a Lincoln Towers parking garage, including a monument to 
replace a plaque commemorating the three civil rights workers who were 
killed in Mississippi in 1963.[30] Early on, the project faced opposition 
for being larger than the previously approved Lincoln West, for increasing 
traffic on West End Avenue and crowding at the 72nd Street subway station, 
for including no affordable housing, and because of its association with 
Trump.[31] Minor objections included potentially blocking all of the westward-facing 
windows of the Chatsworth, a preexisting apartment building on 72nd Street,[29][32] 
as well as views from Lincoln Towers. In addition, residents of 71st Street 
objected to the extension of their street to Riverside Boulevard, thereby 
making their cul-de-sac into a through street.[29] The 71st Street problem 
was easily solved by placing bollards between the existing cul-de-sac and 
a new mirror-image cul-de-sac on Riverside South property. Most of the 
major issues were resolved during the approval process. Trump agreed to 
slightly reduce the overall project size, to partially fund an expansion 
of the subway station, to a guarantee the affordability of a minimum of 
12% of the dwelling units, and that the development would pay for construction 
and maintenance of the new public park.[12][33] However, some people still 
strongly opposed the project, with U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler saying 
that the public park would be a $10,000,000-per-acre ($25,000,000/ha) "private 
backyard for the people who live in these buildings."[34] With Chase Manhattan 
Bank demanding repayment, Trump gave controlling interest of the project 
to the consortium of Hong Kong- and China-based investors, Polylinks, in 
June 1994. The Hong Kong and China consortium Polylinks International Ltd., 
represented by real estate broker Susan Cara, paid $82 million to Chase 
to obtain the property, after renegotiating both Trump's business and personal 
debt down from $300 million. [10] This joint venture finally put in motion 
the largest private development project in New York City history. Trump 
remained as the public face of the group, as he has on many other projects, 
but he lost control.[35] Due to the weak economy, as well as significant 
community opposition, construction was delayed for several years as lawsuits 
were resolved and the new investors sought public financing or mortgage 
insurance.[36][37] The development was delayed repeatedly, with the first 
building originally slated to start construction in 1995, then in October 
1996, and finally in January 1997.[34] With improvement in the development 
climate, the new investors began construction in 1997, placing the name 
"Trump Place" in large letters on three buildings. Although Trump ceased 
his active involvement in the development in 2001, he retained his 30% 
limited partnership.[38] One of the key components of Riverside South is 
relocating the West Side Highway eastward from a viaduct to a rail-yard-grade-level 
tunnel between approximately West 70th Street and West 61st Street to facilitate 
a southward expansion of Riverside Park.[39][40] The current viaduct between 
72nd and 59th Streets is the only remaining section of the West Side Elevated 
Highway that once ran to the southern tip of Manhattan. The highway closed 
in 1973 when part of the 1920s- and 1930s-era elevated highway collapsed 
at 14th Street. Below 34th Street, the proposed replacement, an interstate 
highway in new landfill known as Westway, was defeated, so in 1988, the 
state settled on an at-grade boulevard up to 57th Street flanked by a new 
Hudson River Park.[41] Robert Moses had proposed relocating the highway 
between 59th and 72nd streets to grade to facilitate an extension of Riverside 
Park.[42] But the state rejected that proposal because of the presumed 
negative effect on development opportunities.[43] In 1976, Donald Trump 
seized on Robert Moses' proposal as a way to enhance his development plans, 
negating State DOT's objections. But cost was still an issue. While the 
state owned an easement through the site, neither the state nor the city 
(nor Trump, at that point) owned the land. Although the City could have 
acquired the land in the 1970s from Penn Central, the City was also near 
bankruptcy, and consequently preferred to keep the site in private hands 
to forestall demands for public expenditure.[44] Instead the state proposed 
to reconstruct the viaduct through the rail yard site. Despite city approval 
in 1992 of the Riverside South plan, which would create a public park with 
private funds, opponents said that any complementary public funding to 
bury the road would benefit only the developer and effectively waste the 
public funds used for the viaduct renovation, which had already begun.[34] 
Opponents were further upset by the decision to close the West Side Highway 
northbound entrance and exit ramps at 72nd Street and fought to deny the 
highway project any funding, thinking that they could thereby scuttle the 
entire development.[45] Nevertheless, planning proceeded, albeit in fits 
and starts. Approved by the Federal Highway Administration in 2001,[46] 
the highway plan called for relocating the elevated highway to the grade 
of the rail yard east of the present alignment, constructing supports for 
Riverside Boulevard in the form of a tunnel enclosing the highway's northbound 
lanes, with the park beginning above an adjacent tunnel enclosing the southbound 
lanes and continuing on a slope down to the waterfront. The exit ramp was 
subsequently closed and, in June 2006, the developer began construction 
of the northbound tunnel between 61st and 65th Streets.[47][48] However, 
the tunnel remains unfinished as of 2016[update]. The project was jointly 
developed by the Trump Organization and Hudson Waterfront Associates, representing 
the Hong Kong investors. In 2005, the Hong Kong and China investors sold 
the project, excluding the finished condominiums, to the Carlyle Group 
and the Extell Development Company.[49] Contending that the sale for $1.76 billion 
was little more than half what the property was worth, Trump sued his partners, 
but lost.[10] After the 2016 presidential election, the current owner of 
the three Trump Place buildings announced that it would remove Trump's 
name.[50] Carlyle and Extell then sold the three apartment buildings with 
rental units to another company called Equity Residential.[51] In late 
2008, Extell proposed a 2,900,000-square-foot (270,000 m2), largely residential 
project on the southern two blocks (59th to 61st Streets) to complete the 
development (up from 2,400,000 square feet (220,000 m2) – the 1,800,000 
square feet (170,000 m2) of studio space plus 600,000 square feet (56,000 m2) 
of residential space already approved). The Extell project, known as Riverside 
Center, was approved by the City Council in 2010.[52] The second phase 
of Riverside South was completed when the housing market improved. Extell 
completed three buildings: The Avery (100 Riverside Boulevard), a 32-floor, 
274-unit tower; The Rushmore (80 Riverside Boulevard), a group of 43-story 
towers that share sixteen lower floors and contain a combined 289 units; 
and The Aldyn (60 Riverside Boulevard), a 40-floor condominium buildings. 
The Riverside Center buildings were approved in November 2010.[53] Overall, 
the project consists of 19 apartment buildings, condominiums, and lease 
properties. As of 2012[update], the buildings housed a combined 8,000 people; 
the area was collectively called "Riverside Boulevard" after its main street, 
or "The Strip" after its long, narrow shape. Six more towers with a combined 
3,000 units, as well as a school, a hotel, retail and restaurant space, 
and space for a movie theater, had yet to be completed. A 3.4-acre (1.4 ha) 
park between the buildings was in the planning stages.[51] Most living 
units in Riverside South are high-end housing, costing at least $2,000 
per square foot (22,000/m2).[51] Per-foot real estate prices for Riverside 
South housing rose 66% from 2004 to 2014, compared with a 43% increase 
in real estate on the Upper West Side overall.[49] For instance, baseball 
player Alex Rodriguez bought a 39th-floor Rushmore condominium for $5.5 
million in March 2011, then sold it for $8 million in January 2012.[51] 
At the same time, 12% to 20% of the units will be designated as affordable, 
as required by the City Planning Commission approval of the project.[54] 
However, some buildings in the development, such as One Riverside Park, 
came under controversy in 2013 for having separate entrances for affordable-housing 
residents,[55][56] despite the legality of such "poor doors" in mixed-housing 
buildings.[57] As of November 2014[update], the last two Riverside South 
projects were being completed; these projects were the off-centered, 362-unit 
One West End condominium building, as well as a glass-and-masonry, 616-unit 
rental building at 21 West End Avenue. The former was slated to have 116 
affordable units, while the latter would have 127 affordable units. These 
two buildings were being built in conjunction with a 700-seat public school 
and retail spaces, as well as a possible "European-style food market and 
restaurant". The project's developers, Extell and Carlyle, were planning 
to sell the remaining three building lots to a Boston-based company, General 
Investment and Development Companies.[49] In the same year, Collegiate 
School announced plans to build a new 10-story campus building at 301 Freedom 
Place South.[58] The new 25-acre (10 ha) Riverside Park South extends Riverside 
Park.[24] Phase 1, a 7-acre (2.8 ha) section from 72nd to 68th Streets, 
was opened in April 2001. Pier I at 70th Street, part of the railyard, 
was rebuilt; it maintains its original length of 795 feet (242 m), but 
is narrower than originally, at 55 feet (17 m).[59] Phase 2 comprises a 
waterfront section from 70th Street to 65th Street. Phase 2, opened in 
June 2003, has two plazas at 66th and 68th Streets, as well as a jagged 
waterfront. Phase 3, opened in August 2006, stretches from 65th Street 
to 62nd Street on the waterfront. Phase 4 opened in 2007 along the waterfront 
from 62nd to 57th Streets.[60] The design of Phases 5, 6, and 7, located 
between the current and future highway alignments, is tied to the fate 
of the highway relocation, the timing of which is still uncertain.[61] 
A new mixed-use bikeway and walkway was also built through the park, linking 
Hudson River Park with Riverside Park.[62] The park contains site-specific 
sculptures, railway ruins, gardens, a waterfront promenade, and a walkway.[63] 
The city plans to expand the park with new basketball courts, bikeways, 
lawns, picnic areas, and restrooms as part of Phase Five of construction, 
which would happen between June 2016 and 2018.[64][65] Portions of the 
former rail yard, such as the New York Central Railroad 69th Street Transfer 
Bridge, were incorporated into the new park.[1][60][62] The transfer bridge 
was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.[66] Nearly 
a dozen rail yard ruins, such as a burnt warehouse frame, were ultimately 
integrated into the park.[62] As a reminder of the location's history, 
New York Central Railroad logos are engraved onto park benches.[62] A block 
away, on West End Avenue, a privately-owned park has a remnant of a stone 
wall, as a remaining part of the embankment that dated to 1847. Construction 
workers had unearthed the stones during construction in 1994; some stones 
were salvaged for the new park during the four-day construction hiatus 
for archaeological excavation.[2] Manhattan Community Board 7 members blamed 
Trump for the lack of the proposed enhancement and monument at Freedom 
Place, which was not built. However, the Riverside South Planning Corporation 
said that the Freedom Place plan was merely a concept for an arts program 
that was not included into the final project.[30] As a continuation in 
spirit of the current Freedom Place, Riverside South created a Freedom 
Place South running southward from 64th Street to 59th Street, where the 
historic, full-block IRT Powerhouse and Riverside Center building are located.[67] 
Adjacent to the Powerhouse, and visible from Freedom Place South, is a 
new tetrahedron-shaped building at 625 West 57th Street, also known as 
VIA 57 West.[68] After over 600 signed a petition, the owners of Trump 
Place announced on November 15, 2016 that the buildings would be renamed 
for their addresses of 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard. Lettering 
on the buildings was being removed, and employee uniforms and other items 
were being replaced. Though Trump had not been connected with the buildings 
for over ten years, opponents of the use of his name cited his offensive
