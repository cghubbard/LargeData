Rogers Centre, originally named SkyDome, is a multi-purpose stadium in 
downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada situated just southwest of the CN Tower 
near the northern shore of Lake Ontario. Opened in 1989 on the former Railway 
Lands, it is home to the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Previously, the stadium served as home to the Toronto Argonauts of the 
Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Toronto Raptors of the National 
Basketball Association (NBA). The Buffalo Bills of the National Football 
League (NFL) played an annual game at the stadium as part of the Bills 
Toronto Series from 2008 to 2013. While it is primarily a sports venue, 
it also hosts other large-scale events such as conventions, trade fairs, 
concerts, travelling carnivals, and monster truck shows. The stadium was 
renamed "Rogers Centre" following the purchase of the stadium by Rogers 
Communications, which also owned the Toronto Blue Jays, in 2005.[1][14] 
The venue was noted for being the first stadium to have a fully retractable 
motorized roof, as well as for the 348-room hotel attached to it, with 
70 rooms overlooking the field.[15] It is also the last North American 
major-league stadium built to accommodate both football and baseball. The 
stadium served as the site of both the opening and closing ceremonies of 
the 2015 Pan American Games.[16] During the ceremonies, the site was referred 
to as the "Pan Am Dome" (officially as the "Pan Am Ceremonies Venue") instead 
of its official name. SkyDome, called Rogers Centre since 2005, was designed 
by architect Rod Robbie and structural engineer Michael Allen and was constructed 
by the EllisDon Construction company of London, Ontario and the Dominion 
Bridge Company of Lachine, Quebec. The stadium's construction lasted about 
two and a half years, from October 1986 to May 1989. The approximate cost 
of construction was C$570 million[7] ($966 million in 2016 dollars[9]) 
which was paid for by the federal government, Ontario provincial government, 
the City of Toronto, and a large consortium of corporations.[17] The main 
impetus for building an enclosed sports venue came following the Grey Cup 
game in November 1982, held at the outdoor Exhibition Stadium. The game 
was played in a driving rainstorm that left most of the crowd drenched, 
leading the media to call it "the Rain Bowl". As many of the seats were 
completely exposed to the elements, thousands watched the game from the 
concession section. To make a bad experience even worse, the washrooms 
overflowed. In attendance that day was Bill Davis, the Premier of Ontario, 
and the poor conditions were seen by the largest TV audience ever in Canada 
(over 7,862,000 viewers) to that point.[18] The following day, at a rally 
at Toronto City Hall, tens of thousands of people who attended the game 
began to chant, "We want a dome! We want a dome!"[citation needed] Seven 
months later, in June 1983, Premier Davis formally announced that a three-person 
committee would look into the feasibility of building a domed stadium at 
Exhibition Place. The committee consisted of Paul Godfrey, Larry Grossman 
and former Ontario Hydro chairman Hugh Macaulay.[19] The committee examined 
various projects, including a large indoor stadium at Exhibition Place 
with an air-supported dome, similar to BC Place in Vancouver. In 1985, 
an international design competition was launched to design a new stadium, 
along with selection of a site. Some of the proposed sites included Exhibition 
Place, Downsview Airport, and York University. The final site was located 
at the base of the CN Tower not far from Union Station, a major railway 
and transit hub. The Railway Lands were a major Canadian National Railway 
rail switching yard encompassing the CNR Spadina Roundhouse (the desolate 
downtown lands were part of a master plan for revitalizing the area, which 
includes CityPlace). Ultimately, the Robbie/Allen concept won because it 
provided the largest roof opening of all the finalists, and it was the 
most technically sound. The name "SkyDome" was chosen as part of a province-wide 
"name the stadium" contest in 1987. Sponsored by the Toronto Sun, ballots 
were offered for people to submit their suggested name, with lifetime seats 
behind home plate to all events at the stadium (including concerts) as 
the prize. Over 150,000 entries were received with 12,897 different names. 
The selection committee narrowed it down to four choices: "Towerdome", 
"Harbourdome", "SkyDome", and simply "the Dome". The judges' final selection 
was SkyDome. Premier David Peterson drew the prize-winning entry of Kellie 
Watson from a lottery barrel containing the over-2,000 entries that had 
proposed "SkyDome". At the press conference announcing the name, Chuck 
Magwood, president of the Stadium Corporation of Ontario (Stadco), the 
crown corporation created to run SkyDome,[20] commented: "The sky is a 
huge part of the whole roof process. The name has a sense of the infinite 
and that's what this is all about." The stadium was funded by a public/private 
partnership, with the government paying the largest percentage of the tab. 
The initial cost of $150 million was greatly underestimated,[21] with the 
final tab coming in at C$570 million ($966 million in 2016 dollars[9]).[7] 
Two levels of government (Metro Toronto and Provincial) each initially 
contributed $30 million ($50.9 million in 2016 dollars[9]).[7][21][22] 
This does not include the actual value of the land the stadium sits on 
(as it was part of a deal with the Crown agency – CN Rail). Canada's three 
main breweries (Labatt's, Molson, and Carling O'Keefe) and the Toronto 
Blue Jays each paid $5 million ($8.48 million in 2016 dollars[9]) to help 
fund the stadium.[22] An additional 26 other Canadian corporations (selected 
by invitation only) also contributed $5 million,[22] for which they received 
one of the 161 Skyboxes with four parking spaces (for ten years, with an 
opportunity for renewal) and a 99 year exclusive option on stadium advertising. 
Skyboxes initially leased for $150,000 up to $225,000 ($254 thousand to 
$381 thousand in 2016 dollars[9]) a year in 1989 – plus the cost of tickets 
for all events. The then unusual financing structure created controversy. 
First of all, there was no public tender for supplies and equipment. Secondly, 
companies that paid the $5 million fee, such as Coca-Cola, TSN and CIBC, 
received 100% stadium exclusivity,[7] including advertising rights, for 
the life of their contract that could be extended up to 99 years. Third, 
the contracts were not put up for bid, meaning that there was some doubt 
the contracts were made at a market rate: Pepsi stated at the time that 
had they known the terms of the contract they would have paid far more 
than $5 million for the rights. Local media like NOW Magazine called the 
amount charged to the companies "scandalously low".[23] Construction was 
done by lead contractor EllisDon. Several factors complicated the construction: 
The lands housed a functioning water pumping station that needed to be 
relocated, the soil was contaminated from a century of industrial use, 
railway buildings needed to be torn down or moved, and the site was rich 
with archaeological finds. One of the most complex issues was moving the 
John St. pumping station across the street to its new home south of the 
stadium. Foundations to the stadium were being poured even as the facility 
(located in the infield area) continued to function, as construction on 
its new location had yet to be completed. Because the stadium was the first 
of its kind in the world, the architects and engineers kept the design 
simple (by using a sturdy dome shape) and used proven technologies to move 
the roof. It was important that the design would work and be reliable as 
to avoid the various problems that plagued Montreal's Olympic Stadium. 
The 31-storey high roof consists of four panels; one (on the North end) 
is fixed in place and the other three are moved by electrically driven 
'train' engines, that run on high strength railway rails. The roof, which 
takes 20 minutes to open, was made out of steel trusses covered by corrugated 
steel cladding, which in turn is covered by a single-ply PVC membrane. 
Because of its location south of major railway corridor, new pedestrian 
connections had to be built; the infrastructure was part of the reason 
for the high cost of the stadium. The SkyWalk is a (½ km – est.) enclosed 
walkway that leads from the base of the CN Tower and via a bridge connects 
to Union Station (and is part of the PATH network). The John Street bridge 
was built to provide North/South passage over the rail tracks, linking 
Front Street with the stadium. The stadium was completed two months late, 
having been planned to open for the first regular season Toronto Blue Jays 
game in 1989. The stadium officially opened on June 3, 1989, and hosted 
an official grand opening show: "The Opening of SkyDome: A Celebration", 
that was broadcast on CBC television the following evening hosted by Brian 
Williams. With a crowd of over 50,000 in attendance, the event included 
appearances by Alan Thicke, Oscar Peterson, Andrea Martin of SCTV, impersonator 
André-Philippe Gagnon and rock band Glass Tiger. The roof was ceremonially 
"opened" by Ontario Premier David Peterson with a laser pen. The roof's 
opening exposed the crowd to a downpour of rain. Despite audible chants 
of "close the roof", Magwood insisted that the roof remain fully open. 
The stadium would later become a thorn in the side of David Peterson's 
Ontario Liberal government for repeated cost overruns. After the Liberals 
were defeated by the NDP in the 1990 Ontario election, a review by the 
new Bob Rae government in October 1990 revealed that Stadco's debt meant 
that the Dome would have to be booked 600 days a year to turn a profit. 
The stadium income was only $17 million in its first year of operations, 
while debt service was $40 million. It was determined that the abrupt late 
inclusion by Stadco of a hotel and health club added an additional $112 million 
to the cost of the building. As the province slipped into a recession, 
Rae appointed University of Toronto professor Bruce Kidd and Canadian Auto 
Workers President Bob White to the Stadco board to help deal with the stadium's 
growing debt, but the original $165 million debt had ballooned to $400 million 
by 1993.[7][21] Stadco became a political liability, and in March 1994, 
the Ontario government paid off all outstanding Stadco debts from the government 
treasury and sold the stadium for $151 million to a private consortium 
that included Labatt Breweries, the Blue Jays' owner.[21][24] In November 
1998, the stadium, which Labatt then owned as 49% of total, filed for bankruptcy 
protection,[25] triggered after disastrous Skybox renewal numbers. Most 
of the 161 Skybox tenants had signed on for 10-year leases; a marked decrease 
in interest in the stadium's teams and the construction of the Air Canada 
Centre, which hosted the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors, resulted 
in few renewals for Skybox leases. That same month, the Blue Jays re-signed 
for an additional ten years in the facility.[21] In April 1999, Sportsco 
International LP bought the stadium out of bankruptcy protection for $80 million.[24] 
In November 2004, Rogers Communications, parent company of the Blue Jays, 
acquired SkyDome, excluding the attached SkyDome hotel, which had been 
sold to Renaissance for a reported $31 million in 1999, from Sportsco for 
about $25 million – roughly 4% of the cost of construction.[24] On February 
2, 2005, Ted Rogers, President and CEO of Rogers Communications, announced 
a three-year corporate contract to change the name of SkyDome to Rogers 
Centre. The name change remains controversial and is unpopular with many 
fans, most of whom continue to refer to it as SkyDome in opposition to 
increased commercialism from the purchase of naming rights. One example 
is a 25,000 name petition started by TTC bus driver Randy Rajmoolie.[26] 
After the purchase Rogers refurbished the stadium by, among other things, 
replacing the Jumbotron with a Daktronics video display, and erecting other 
new monitors, including several built into the outfield wall. They also 
installed a new FieldTurf artificial playing surface.[27] In May 2005, 
the Toronto Argonauts agreed to three five-year leases at Rogers Centre, 
which could have seen the Argonauts play out of Rogers Centre up to and 
including 2019. The team had the option to leave at the end of each of 
the three lease agreements.[28] However, plans to replace Rogers Centre's 
surface with natural grass and permanently lock the rotatable stands in 
baseball position by 2018 forced the Argonauts to relocate to BMO Field 
before the 2016 season.[29][30][31] In November 2005, Rogers Centre received 
a complete makeover to "open" the 100 Level concourse to the playing field 
and convert 43 luxury boxes to "party suites". This required some seats 
to be removed, which lowered overall capacity.[32] In April 2006, Rogers 
Centre became one of the first buildings of its size to adopt a completely 
smoke-free policy in Canada, anticipating an act of provincial legislature 
that required all Ontario public places to go smoke-free by June 1, 2006. 
Alcohol was not available to patrons of Rogers Centre on April 7, 2009, 
as the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario imposed the first of a 
three-day alcohol suspension at the stadium for "infractions (that) took 
place at certain past events", according to the press release.[33] Since 
its opening in 1989, numerous changes and improvements have been made to 
the facility, some of the more significant of which are: In February 2013, 
Paul Beeston, president of the Blue Jays, said that the stadium would need 
$250 million in renovations over the next decade to bring it up to date, 
including installing a natural grass playing field by 2018.[35] The venue 
was the first major team sports stadium in North America with a functional, 
fully retractable roof (Montreal's Olympic Stadium also had a retractable 
roof, but due to operational issues, it was replaced with a permanent roof). 
The roof is composed of four panels and covers an area of 345,000 square 
feet (32,100 m2). The two middle panels slide laterally to stack over the 
north semi-circular panel, and then the south semi-circular panel rotates 
around the stadium and nests inside the stack. It takes 20 minutes for 
the roof to open or close.[36] It is not possible to move the roof in cold 
weather citing that the mechanism that closes the roof could fail in cooler 
weather.[37] The original AstroTurf installation was replaced with FieldTurf 
from 2005 to 2010. The FieldTurf took about 40 hours to remove for events 
such as concerts or trade shows, as it used 1,400 trays that needed to 
be stacked and transported off the field. Prior to the 2010 baseball season, 
to reduce the amount of time required to convert the playing field, a new, 
roll-based version of AstroTurf was installed. Similar to FieldTurf, the 
current installation uses a sand and rubber-based infill within the synthetic 
fibres.[38] The Rogers Centre is one of two remaining venues in Major League 
Baseball using artificial turf (the other one is Tropicana Field in St. 
Petersburg, Florida, home of the Tampa Bay Rays), and was the last venue 
to use "sliding pits" before switching to a full dirt infield for the 2016 
baseball season. The use of natural grass was long thought unfeasible since 
the stadium was designed as a closed structure with a roof that opens, 
and as such the interior was not intended or built to deal with weather, 
including low temperatures and drainage. As of the 2016 season, they are 
one of two teams to have never played a home game on grass at their main 
stadium (the Tampa Bay Rays played some home games in 2007 and 2008 at 
Champion Stadium in Walt Disney World).[39][40][41] However, the Blue Jays 
have long explored the possibility of converting the Rogers Centre to a 
natural grass surface, and plans are currently in place to install a grass 
field by 2018 to allow enough time for research and growing of the sod.[42] 
Installing grass would require digging up the floor, adding a drainage 
system, and installing 30 cm (1 ft) of dirt. The stadium would need to 
be permanently locked into its baseball configuration; the lower stands, 
which roll into position for football, would be permanently fixed in position 
for baseball.[43][44][45] The plan became more definite when Rogers renewed 
the Argonauts' lease through 2017, but ruled out any further extensions; 
in May 2015, it was announced that the Argos would move to BMO Field for 
the 2016 season.[29][30][31] The Blue Jays subsequently confirmed that 
the Argonauts' early departure would not accelerate their own plans to 
install grass in 2018,[46] though it did allow for a dirt infield to be 
installed for the 2016 season.[47] There are a total of 5,700 club seats 
and 161 luxury suites at the Rogers Centre. The complex had a Hard Rock 
Café restaurant until December 2009 when the restaurant closed after its 
lease expired.[48] The Renaissance Toronto Hotel is also located within 
Rogers Centre, with 70 rooms overlooking the field.[49] Over $5 million 
of artwork was commissioned in 1989 ($8.5 million in 2016 dollars): The 
Rogers Centre video board is 33 feet (10 m) high and 110 feet (34 m) across. 
The panel is made up of modular LED units that can be replaced unit by 
unit, and can be repaired immediately should it be damaged during an event. 
Originally, this screen was a Sony JumboTron, but since has been replaced. 
There are also two ribbon boards made up of LED that run along the East 
and West sides of the stadium interior. They are each 434 feet (132 m) 
long by 3.5 feet (1.1 m) high. In addition, there are two video boards 
that make up parts of the left and right outfield walls while in baseball 
configuration. These are 65 feet (20 m) wide by nearly 10 feet (3.0 m) 
high. The video board and the stadium played host to several serial television 
events, including the series finales for Cheers and Star Trek: The Next 
Generation, along with live coverage of the funeral of Princess Diana. 
The 1992 World Series and 1993 World Series were played at the SkyDome. 
Games in the first round of the 2009 World Baseball Classic were played 
at the Rogers Centre.[57] Besides baseball, Rogers Centre was the original 
home of the National Basketball Association's Toronto Raptors, who played 
at the venue from November 1995 to February 1999, while the Air Canada 
Centre was being planned and built. It proved to be somewhat problematic 
as a basketball venue, even considering that it was only a temporary facility. 
For instance, many seats that were theoretically in line with the court 
were so far away that fans needed binoculars to see the action. Other seats 
were so badly obstructed that fans sitting there could only watch the game 
on the replay boards. For most games, Rogers Centre seated 22,900 people. 
However, the Raptors sometimes opened the upper level when popular opponents 
came to town, expanding capacity to 29,000. Rogers Centre hosted Canadian 
football from opening in 1989 to 2015, as the Argonauts moved to BMO Field 
in 2016. In November 2007, it hosted the 95th Grey Cup, its first since 
1992 and third all-time. It was the 56th Grey Cup hosted by the city of 
Toronto since the championship's inception in 1909. From 1989 to 2003, 
the SkyDome hosted the Vanier Cup championship of Canadian Interuniversity 
Sport football. In 1994, then-part owner of the SkyDome Labatt considered 
purchasing a National Football League and a Major League Soccer team to 
play at the stadium.[58] In January 2007, Rogers Centre played host to 
the first ever International Bowl, an NCAA college football game between 
Western Michigan University and the University of Cincinnati. In 2008, 
Rutgers played Ball State in the second International Bowl. The University 
at Buffalo Bulls and the University of Connecticut Huskies played in the 
third International Bowl on January 3, 2009. Rogers Centre was also the 
venue for the 43rd Vanier Cup on Friday November 23, just two days before 
Grey Cup Sunday. It was the 16th Vanier Cup hosted at the venue, returning 
after a three-year absence in which it was hosted by Hamilton, Ontario 
(2004 and 2005) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (2006). It was the 40th Vanier 
Cup hosted by Toronto since that championship's inception in 1965. The 
National Football League's Buffalo Bills announced its intentions to play 
five "home" games (and three pre-season games) in Rogers Centre in October 
2007, so beginning the Bills Toronto Series; the first of these regular-season 
games took place on December 7 of the 2008 NFL season versus the Miami 
Dolphins.[59] It marked the first time an NFL team has established a "home" 
stadium outside the United States. The Bills played a preseason game against 
the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Rogers Centre on August 14, 2008. Soccer 
matches have been regularly held in recent years; they had been rarely 
played at the venue when its AstroTurf surface had been in place.[60] On 
June 8, 2005 an international soccer friendly between Serbia and Italy 
took place, ending in a 1–1 draw.[60] On July 16, 2010, the stadium hosted 
a friendly soccer match between England's Manchester United F.C. and Scotland's 
Celtic F.C. Manchester United F.C. defeated Celtic F.C. with a score of 
3–1. On July 21, 2012, the stadium hosted the friendly between Toronto 
FC and Liverpool F.C., a match that finished in a 1–1 draw. Rogers Centre 
has also hosted exhibition cricket, gaelic football, hurling, australian 
rules football and tennis. It hosted the 1993 IAAF World Indoor Championships. 
On May 31, 1997, the venue hosted a post-Olympic track and field event 
that pitted Olympic track champions Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson, 
in a 150m race that was billed as a competition for the title of the "World's 
Fastest Man". Bailey won the race, completing it in a time of 15 seconds 
and winning the $1.5 million prize. Johnson pulled up lame at the 110m 
mark claiming a quadriceps injury. Rogers Centre is the site of several 
major high school and collegiate sporting competitions, such as the Prentice 
Cup for baseball. Since 2008, the Rogers Centre is the host of the Greater 
Toronto High Schools' Metro Bowl.[61] It hosted a round of the AMA Supercross 
Championship from 2008 to 2014 [62] and returned in 2016. Monster Jam has 
also hsoted motorsport competitions at the venue. On April 30, 2011, Ultimate 
Fighting Championship hosted their first event in Ontario's history, UFC 
129. Originally set up for 42,000 seats, the event sold out on the first 
day of ticket sales. Changes were made to accommodate another 13,000 seats. 
Fans responded bringing the total seat sales to 55,000 — breaking previous 
UFC records. For the 2015 Pan American Games, the Rogers Centre was used 
for the opening and closing ceremonies. The World Wrestling Federation 
(since renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)) hosted WrestleMania 
VI and WrestleMania X8 at Rogers Centre in 1990 and 2002. As well, the 
WWF/WWE held its largest crowd for Monday Night Raw in February 1999.[63] 
The stadium has several concert configurations, including smaller Theatre 
(capacity 5,000 to 7,000) and Concert Hall (formerly SkyTent; capacity 
10,000 to 25,000).[64] Due to the design of the stadium and building materials 
used, the acoustics have been known to be rather poor, and the loudness/quality 
can vary greatly around the stadium. Its popularity with artists and fans 
has diminished over the years, with most stadium concerts taking place 
at the Air Canada Centre, since it opened. The SkyTent, a group of acoustical 
curtain sails that is hoisted on rigging above the floor, is used to help 
reduce sound distortion and improve sound quality by dampening reverberations 
around the stadium.[65] Soon after its opening, the stadium became a popular 
venue for large-scale rock concerts and is the largest indoor concert venue 
in Toronto.[66] Artists have included Bruce Springsteen, U2 with two concerts 
in 2009, as well as their concert in 2011, all part of their 360° Tour.[67][68][69] 
Bon Jovi performed two sellout shows on July 20 and 21, 2010 at the Rogers 
Centre as part of The Circle Tour.[70] The Rolling Stones played two sold 
out concerts at the stadium: on December 4, 1989 during the Steel Wheels 
Tour and on September 26, 2005 during their highest grossing tour A Bigger 
Bang Tour. The Rogers Centre has been a venue for large electronic dance 
music events. During 2013, notable events included two back to back sold 
out shows on Swedish House Mafia's farewell tour, One Last Tour and Sensation's 
first Canadian event. One of the more notable concerts, as shown in the 
documentary Truth or Dare, was Madonna's 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour 
show.[71] The touring show had become extremely controversial, due to the 
risqué visuals and performances. When the concert arrived in Toronto, police 
were alerted that the show might violate local obscenity laws. The police 
were on site for the concert and threatened charges without changes. The 
show went on as planned, however, without any legal action taken. Later, 
she performed 2 concerts at the stadium again during The Girlie Show World 
Tour in 1993. Bruce Springsteen performed on August 24, 2012 during his 
Wrecking Ball World Tour in front of 39,000 people. Rogers Centre contains 
143,000 sq ft (13,300 m2) of exhibition space, allowing it to host a variety 
of events year-round. Disney on Ice and circuses have used the venue. It 
is home to several annual auto shows, with the Canadian International AutoShow 
in February and Importfest in October. The Opening Ceremonies of the XVI 
International AIDS Conference were held at Rogers Centre on August 13, 
2006.[72] It has also hosted many public speakers, including appearances 
by the Dalai Lama, Christian Evangelist Billy Graham, Nelson Mandela, and 
J. K. Rowling, for a book reading.[73] In addition to being a venue that 
hosts sports, concerts and other events, the Rogers Centre also houses 
the head offices of a number of businesses. The Toronto Blue Jays have 
its office headquarters located in the building and until 2008, the Toronto 
Argonauts did as well. It is also the home of the head offices of Ticketmaster 
Canada and Zuffa Canada, the former also having the main Ticketmaster outlet 
(ticket centre) for eastern Canada, located at the south end of the building 
beside Gate 9.[74][75][76] In addition, the building contains the Toronto 
Renaissance Hotel, a Premier Fitness/Health Club, a Rogers Plus store, 
(formerly) a Hard Rock Cafe, and Windows Restaurant. Starting in 2006, 
the Hard Rock Cafe only opened when there was a performance in the building, 
and closed altogether in 2009.[48] On non-event days, there are daily tours 
of the Rogers Centre. Date: June 5, 1989[87] Final score: Milwaukee Brewers
