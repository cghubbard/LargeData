Ronald Samuel Herbel (January 14, 1938 – January 20, 2000) was a right-handed 
Major League Baseball pitcher. His .029 career batting average is the lowest 
batting average in Major League history for a player with a minimum of 
100 at-bats.[1] Born in Denver, Colorado, Herbel attended the University 
of Northern Colorado. After two seasons at Northern Colorado, Herbel signed 
as an amateur free agent with the San Francisco Giants. He spent five seasons 
in San Francisco's farm system when he received a September call up to 
the Giants in 1963. He made two relief appearances with the Giants, both 
against the New York Mets, with his major league debut on September 10 
at the Polo Grounds.[2] Herbel was used both in relief and as a starter 
in 1963, as he made 22 starts and eighteen appearances out of the bullpen. 
In his first Major League at-bat on May 6, he struck out against Larry 
Jackson of the Chicago Cubs.[3] For the season, Herbel made 54 plate appearances 
without getting a hit, and struck out thirty times. On the mound, however, 
he was much better. Herbel went 9–9 with a 3.07 earned run average and 
98 strikeouts. His first major league win was a 1–0 complete game shut 
out of the New York Mets on May 17.[4] In 1965 Herbel earned a spot in 
the starting rotation on his way to a 12–9 record for a Giants team that 
won 14 straight games in September, with Herbel pitching the best ball 
of his career, only to lose the pennant by 2 games to a Dodger team that 
won its last 15 games. He registered his first major league hit and RBI 
on May 21 in his first major league game on astroturf, while holding the 
Houston Astros to just five hits themselves in the complete game victory.[5] 
It was his only hit of the season, though he was credited with a second 
run batted in on July 28 when he walked with the bases loaded.[6] 1965 
was Herbel's best season with the Giants. If it could be said that he had 
a best season with the bat, it would be 1967 when Herbel had three hits, 
two of which were doubles, two walks, three successful bunts and struck 
out only fourteen times for a .107 batting average. It was also Herbel's 
first real season as a reliever. Though he made eleven starts, he made 
31 appearances out of the bullpen, earning one save. Over the next two 
seasons, Herbel made only six starts. Following the 1969 season, Herbel 
was traded with Bob Barton and Bobby Etheridge to the San Diego Padres 
for Frank Reberger. The Padres were 50–82, 34.5 games back of the Cincinnati 
Reds when they dealt Herbel to the reigning World Series champion New York 
Mets, who were in the midst of a play-off drive again in 1970 (two games 
back of the first place Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League East 
at the time of the trade), and needed to add an arm to their bullpen. Herbel 
went 2–2 with a 1.38 ERA and one save in twelve relief appearances for 
the Mets, who finished in third place, six games back of the Pirates. Combined 
with his 64 appearances with the Padres, Herbel's 76 appearances on the 
mound led the National League, and was only one less than major league 
leader Wilbur Wood. Following the season, he was traded to the Atlanta 
Braves for Bob Aspromonte. Herbel spent one season in Atlanta, where he 
went 0–1 with a 5.23 ERA and one save in 25 appearances for the third place 
Braves. He signed with the Minnesota Twins in 1972, and spent the entire 
season with their triple A Pacific Coast League affiliate before retiring.
