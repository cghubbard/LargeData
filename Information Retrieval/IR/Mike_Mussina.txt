Michael Cole Mussina (born December 8, 1968), nicknamed Moose, is a former 
Major League Baseball right-handed starting pitcher. Mussina played for 
the Baltimore Orioles (1991–2000) and the New York Yankees (2001–2008). 
Mussina spent his entire career in the competitive and high-scoring American 
League East, won at least 11 games in 17 consecutive seasons – an American 
League record – and recorded a career .638 winning percentage. Among pitchers, 
he ranks 33rd in all-time wins (270),[1] 33rd in games started (535), 66th 
in innings pitched (3,562.2), and 19th in strikeouts (2,813). A five-time 
All-Star and seven-time Gold Glove winner, Mussina's consistency resulted 
in six top-five finishes in the voting for his league's Cy Young Award. 
Mussina was very close to winning a World Series several times in his career. 
With Baltimore he lost the 1996 and 1997 ALCS. Then came close several 
times in his career with New York, he joined in 2001 after which the Yankees 
had won the 2000 World Series. They made it to the 2001 World Series but 
lost in seven games. They reached the 2003 World Series but lost in six 
games. The Yankees then surrendered a three-nothing series lead in the 
2004 ALCS. The Yankees then experienced heartbreak in the playoffs leading 
up to 2008, when they missed the playoffs for the first time since 1993. 
After retiring at the end of the season the Yankees would win the 2009 
World Series at the new Yankee Stadium. Mussina ended his career as one 
of the best to never get a World Series ring and one of the closest to 
and never succeed. Mussina was born in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. At Montoursville 
Area High School in Montoursville, Pennsylvania he had a 24–4 win–loss 
record with a 0.87 earned run average (ERA) for the school's baseball team. 
He also excelled in football and basketball.[citation needed] As a high 
school senior, Mussina just missed being the valedictorian of his graduating 
class. According to some reports, he intentionally came up short to avoid 
delivering a commencement speech.[2][3] Mussina was drafted by the Baltimore 
Orioles in 1987 but chose to attend college rather than sign.[4] Mussina 
enrolled at Stanford University, where he played college baseball for the 
Stanford Cardinal baseball team. In three years with the Cardinal, Mussina 
compiled a 31–16 record with a 3.89 ERA. He made two College World Series 
appearances and was selected as an All-American. His junior year in 1990 
was his best, finishing 14–5 with a 0.99 ERA before being drafted again 
by the Baltimore Orioles, this time as a first round pick (20th overall).[citation 
needed] Mussina graduated from Stanford in 1990 with a degree in economics. 
He is a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.[citation needed] Mussina 
made his professional debut with the Class AA Hagerstown Suns of the Eastern 
League in 1990. In the minor leagues, Mussina posted a 2.38 ERA in 189 
innings.[5] In 1992, Mussina's first full season with the Orioles, he finished 
with an 18–5 record and a 2.54 ERA in 241 innings. His .783 win-loss percentage 
led the league, and his 1.79 BB/9 was second best behind Chris Bosio. His 
4 shutouts were tied for 2nd in the league behind only Boston's Roger Clemens. 
He finished 4th in the American League Cy Young Award voting, and pitched 
one perfect inning in the 1992 All-Star Game. Mussina struggled in 1993 
due to shoulder soreness, which placed him on the disabled list (DL) from 
July 22 to August 19. Nonetheless, he managed to win 14 games while posting 
the 7th best winning percentage in the American League. Mussina also allowed 
83 earned runs in only 167.2 innings of work for a 4.46 ERA while striking 
out 117 batters. He was voted onto the All-Star team, however he did not 
pitch in the game. There was a controversial incident toward the end of 
the game when Mussina chose to warm up in the bullpen, despite the fact 
AL manager Cito Gaston had told him that he would not enter the game.[6] 
Orioles fans believed Mussina was warming up in preparation to come in 
and pitch the ninth inning, and when Gaston put Duane Ward in to pitch 
the ninth inning, the fans at Camden Yards spent the rest of the game chanting 
"We Want Mike" and booing Gaston very loudly, as the popular slogan "Cito 
Sucks" was born in Baltimore. The slogan could be seen on T-shirts or heard 
even years later in Baltimore any time the visiting Blue Jays came to town. 
Gaston was never treated well by Baltimore fans for the rest of his managerial 
career and he was subject to death threats for not pitching Mussina in 
the game.[7] Many believe Mussina threw on his own as a way of publicly 
showing up Gaston because he was angry at not pitching in the game. However, 
Mussina said he was just getting his work in, as he was scheduled to throw 
that day, and it was apparent Gaston did require his services.[6] Mussina 
returned from the DL in August against the Texas Rangers, only to have 
the Orioles shut him down three weeks later in mid-September due to lower 
back pain. Mussina returned to form in 1994, but a player's strike cut 
his season short, causing him to finish with only 16 wins and 99 strikeouts 
in 176.1 innings of work. Mussina finished tied for 2nd in the league in 
wins, and his 3.06 ERA placed him 4th. He was selected to his 3rd consecutive 
All-Star Game and pitched one inning, giving up one hit while striking 
out one batter. Mussina finished 4th in voting for that year's American 
League Cy Young Award. In 1995, Mussina started and won Cal Ripken's record-breaking 
2,131st consecutive game on September 6, 1995.[8] Mussina led the league 
with 19 wins and had one of his finest statistical seasons. He struck out 
158 batters in 221.2 innings, allowing only 81 earned runs for an ERA of 
3.29. Mussina led the league with four shutouts, and he also allowed a 
league-low 2.03 BB/9, while his 1.069 WHIP was 2nd only to Seattle's Randy 
Johnson. Despite his excellent season, Mussina was not elected to that 
year's All-Star Game, and finished 5th in the American League Cy Young 
Award voting. In 1996, Mussina won 19 games and set a new career high of 
243.1 innings. His league-leading 36 games started were also a career high. 
18 of his starts that year were quality starts. In his last start of the 
season, the Orioles bullpen blew a late-inning lead, costing Mussina a 
20-win season. Mussina also won his 1st Gold Glove that year. Mussina did 
not start the Opening Day game in 1997 due to elbow tendonitis. He had 
been the Opening Day starter for the Orioles every year since 1993. Mussina 
finished the season with a 15–8 record, and his 3.20 ERA was 4th best in 
the league. In addition, his 218 strikeouts were a career high and established 
a franchise record. Mussina was again selected for the All-Star team but 
did not appear in the game. He finished 6th in the American League Cy Young 
Award voting and won his 2nd consecutive Gold Glove. In the 1997 American 
League Championship Series he pitched fifteen innings over two starts, 
allowing one run and four hits, and striking out twenty five—an ALCS record 
at the time. However, the Orioles failed to score in both of his starts, 
and Mussina ended up receiving no-decisions for each. Mussina's 1998 season 
was punctuated by two separate trips to the DL, including for injury resultant 
from when a ball hit by Sandy Alomar, Jr. struck him on the face and fractured 
his nose. Mussina still managed to win 13 games and post a 3.49 ERA, with 
175 strikeouts in 206.1 innings. His strikeout-to-walk ratio was good for 
2nd in the league. Mussina won his 3rd consecutive Gold Glove with a perfect 
1.000 fielding percentage out of 50 total chances. On August 4, Mussina 
struck out Detroit's Bip Roberts for his 1000th career strikeout. In 1999, 
he finished 2nd in the league with 18 wins, and his 3.50 ERA and .720 win-loss 
percentage were good for 3rd. Mussina struck out 172 batters in 203.2 innings 
while walking just 52, for a 3.31 K/BB ratio. He was selected as an All-Star 
and pitched one inning, Mussina finished second in the American League 
Cy Young Award voting that year behind Pedro Martínez. He committed just 
one error out of 61 total chances and won his 4th consecutive Gold Glove, 
further cementing his reputation as one of the top defensive pitchers in 
baseball. In 2000, Mussina recorded his first and only losing season going 
11–15. However, he did not pitch as badly as his record suggests, as he 
allowed 100 earned runs in a league-leading 237.2 innings for a 3.79 ERA. 
He struck out 210 batters while allowing 44 walks. Opponents batted just 
.255 off him. He finished 6th in voting for the Cy Young Award that year. 
Following the 2000 season, Mussina decided to leave the Orioles via free 
agency.[9] He signed a 6-year, $88.5 million contract with the New York 
Yankees on November 30, 2000.[10] Mussina finished the 2001 season with 
a 17–11 record. He was 2nd in the league in ERA (3.15), strikeouts (214), 
shutouts (3), and strikeout/walk ratio (5.10), and 5th in strikeouts/9 
IP (8.42) and complete games (4). Mussina pitched seven shutout innings 
in Game 3 of the 2001 American League Division Series and the Yankees went 
on to win the game 1-0, and eventually the series, becoming the only team 
to win a division series after losing the first two games at home. Mussina 
started Games 1 and 5 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
posting an 0–1 record with a 4.09 ERA in 11 innings pitched. In 2002, Mussina 
was second in the AL in walks/9 IP (1.65), third in strikeouts (182) and 
strikeouts/9 IP (7.60), eighth in wins (18), and ninth in walks/9 IP (2.00). 
He held batters to a .198 batting average when the game was tied. In 2003, 
Mussina was third in the league in strikeouts/9 IP (8.18) and strikeout/walk 
ratio (4.88), fourth in strikeouts (195) and walks/9 IP (1.68), fifth in 
wins (17), and eighth in ERA (3.40). He held batters to a .190 batting 
average when there were two outs and runners in scoring position. During 
Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS, Mussina authored one of the greatest clutch pitching 
performances of all time. With the Yankees trailing Boston 4–0 Mussina 
made the first relief appearance of his career. With runners on the corners 
and nobody out, Mussina struck out Jason Varitek before inducing Johnny 
Damon to hit into a double play. Mussina went on to pitch 2 more scoreless 
innings and kept the Yankees within striking distance in a game they later 
came back to win. In 2004, plagued by a series of injuries, Mussina ended 
the year with a 12-9 record and a 4.59 ERA. He was fourth in the league 
in strikeouts (195), and eighth in walks/9 IP (2.19). In 2005, Mussina 
finished with a 13–8 record and a 4.41 ERA. He was seventh in the AL in 
strikeouts/9 IP (7.11). In 2006, he ended the season with a 15–7 record. 
He was second in the league in OBP against (.279), third in the American 
League in walks/9 IP (1.60; a career-best), batting average against (.241), 
and strikeout/walk ratio (4.91), fourth in ERA (3.51), sixth in win-loss 
percentage (.682). He fanned Cody Ross to reach the 2,500 strikeout mark 
on June 25.[11] Mussina also became the first pitcher in American League 
history to win 10 or more games for 15 consecutive seasons. On November 
20, 2006, Mussina and the Yankees reached a preliminary agreement, pending 
a physical, on a two-year, $23 million contract.[12] Earlier in the off-season 
the Yankees declined the 1-year, $17 million option on Mussina's previous 
contract. Under that back-loaded six-year, $88.5 million contract, Mussina 
earned $19 million in each of the last two seasons.[13] In 2007, Mussina 
became just the ninth player to win 100 games with two different teams—he 
had won 147 with Baltimore.[14] However, with the Yankees locked in a tight 
pennant race, Mussina struggled and temporarily lost his spot in the rotation 
to prospect Ian Kennedy. After just one relief appearance, (the first of 
his regular season career), Mussina returned as a starter, going 3–0 in 
his final four starts to end with 11-10 record and a career-high 5.15 ERA. 
The '07 season for Mussina and Mets' pitcher Tom Glavine was the subject 
of a 2008 book by John Feinstein, Living on the Black: Two Pitchers, Two 
Teams, One Season to Remember, showcasing a pivotal season for two New 
York City pitchers as Mussina nailed down milestone career win #250 with 
the Yankees and Glavine earned win #300 with the cross-town Mets. In 2008, 
Mussina started his 8th season with the Yankees as a much-needed veteran 
of an inexperienced rotation. The year began with difficulty reminiscent 
of 2007, and many noted a sharp decline in his pitch velocity. Owner Hank 
Steinbrenner suggested that Mussina should "learn how to pitch like Jamie 
Moyer", and no longer rely so much on his fastball.[15] Although that remark 
was widely interpreted as a slight, Mussina joked in response that he could 
not pitch like Moyer because he did not throw left-handed, and afterwards 
he excelled, going 9–1 in his subsequent eleven starts. On June 15, he 
recorded his 10th win of the season, extending his American League record 
to 17 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins. On September 18, Mussina 
notched his 18th victory of the season and led the Yankees to a 9–2 victory 
over the first place White Sox in his final start at Yankee Stadium. On 
September 28, he won 20 games for the first time at the age of 39, with 
a 6–2 win over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, becoming the oldest first-time 
20 game winner in MLB history. He finished 20–9 with a 3.37 ERA. His 67.6% 
first-strike-percentage was the highest among major league starters. [16] 
Mussina would later finish second to Cleveland Indians pitcher Cliff Lee 
in the voting for American League comeback player of the year honors. On 
November 6, he was awarded his seventh career Gold Glove Award, and the 
third in his career with the Yankees. He would later finish behind Lee 
again in the balloting for the 2008 AL Cy Young Award. Mussina's sixth-place 
finish was his best since 2001.[17] Mussina officially announced his retirement 
on November 20, 2008.[18][19] Mussina is the first pitcher to call it quits 
following a 20-victory season since Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax in 1966.[20] 
Mussina pitched several near-perfect games throughout his career: Mussina 
collected an overall 7–8 record and 3.40 ERA, with 142 strikeouts in 22 
career postseason games. His finest posteason occurred in 1997 for the 
Baltimore Orioles when in 4 games he went 2–0 with a 1.24 ERA in 29 IP 
with 11 H, 4 ER, 7 BB and 41 K.[26] Notably, he twice outdueled Seattle 
Mariners ace Randy Johnson in head-to-head matchups during the ALDS.[27] 
A feature on The Washington Post's website ranked his performance the 6th-most 
memorable moment at Camden Yards.[28] Early in his career, Mussina's arsenal 
included a four-seam fastball that topped out at 95 mph, a two-seam fastball, 
a slider, a changeup, and a plus knuckle-curve. He was always a finesse 
pitcher, and coming up through the Orioles' organization, he was often 
compared to Jim Palmer. He received praise for the ability to make in-game 
adjustments to compensate for days when he was not at his best. Mussina's 
prolonged success was also the result of his ability to make adjustments. 
He added a splitter to his repertoire and replaced his knuckle-curve with 
a more conventional curveball.[29] He became more skilled at changing speeds 
with his breaking pitches and using different arm angles to confuse batters 
as well as to compensate for the diminishing speed of his fastball. During 
spring training in 2006, Yankees catcher Jorge Posada noticed the unique 
grip Mussina used for his changeup and promptly hit a home run off it during 
an intra-squad game. Posada alerted Mussina to the tip-off, and he adjusted 
the grip. This new changeup was difficult for batters to recognize and 
was considered a main reason for his success that season.[30] Mussina's 
remarkable results in 2008 were attributed to changes in pitching style. 
While in the past he was known for painting the outside corner of the plate 
with a mid-90s four-seam fastball, he began to work on both sides of the 
plate with his diminished upper-80s fastball. Additionally, when throwing 
the fastball, he often used the two-seam grip, which gives the ball late 
breaking motion. Despite his lower fastball velocity, Mussina maintained 
a significant differential in pitch speed by also lowering the velocity 
of his changeup. In addition to those more obvious changes, Craig Brown 
of The Hardball Times also attributed Mussina's renaissance to excellent 
control, noting that he was walking fewer batters than ever before and 
was becoming a ground-ball pitcher for the first time in his career.[31] 
Throughout his career, Mussina also complemented his pure pitching ability 
by doing the little things well. He issued very few walks, held baserunners 
well, and fielded his position superbly. Mussina's candidacy for the Hall 
of Fame has come under recent debate.[32] "Do I compare to some guys who 
are in? I think I do", Mussina told USA Today in 2006. The only other pitchers 
to match Mussina's 17 seasons of 10 or more victories are Ted Lyons, Tom 
Glavine, Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Walter Johnson, Greg Maddux, Warren 
Spahn, Cy Young, Don Sutton, Tom Seaver, Tommy John and Steve Carlton; 
all are Hall of Famers, except Tommy John. Of the 23 eligible pitchers 
who have at least 265 wins and an ERA of 3.69 or less, 20 are in the Hall 
of Fame, although if Mussina was elected, his ERA would be third highest 
ahead of Bobby Wallace, who was a full-time pitcher for just two seasons, 
and Red Ruffing. Mussina's consistency is often overshadowed by the dominant 
peaks of contemporaries like Pedro Martínez and Randy Johnson. His numbers 
are often compared to those of Jim Palmer. Mussina has two more wins and 
one more loss than Palmer, (both finished with a .638 winning percentage,) 
while Palmer's ERA is .82 lower. Mussina finished his career with 601 more 
strikeouts than Palmer. Baseball writer Tim Kurkjian stated on the August 
3, 2008, edition of Baseball Tonight: "He's a Hall of Famer. I've looked 
at the numbers and he's in."[citation needed] Mussina's ERA may have suffered 
from playing at a time when hitters dominated. Mussina's career adjusted 
ERA+, which takes into account the league's average ERA and the parks in 
which the pitcher plays, is 123—better than Hall-of-Famers Nolan Ryan,[33] 
Ted Lyons,[34] Jim Bunning,[35] and Bob Lemon,[36] among others. He is 
the oldest pitcher to ever win 20 games in a season for the first time 
at the age of 39 in 2008. He never won the Cy Young Award, but finished 
in the top six of Cy Young voting nine times. Mussina also came tantalizingly 
close to pitching a perfect game and winning a World Series, having lost 
chances at achieving both in the 9th inning in 2001. Only five pitchers 
in the history of major league baseball have as many victories as Mussina 
and a better winning percentage: Lefty Grove, Christy Mathewson, Grover 
Cleveland Alexander, Roger Clemens, and Randy Johnson.[37][38] Mussina 
has the fourth highest career JAWS of any pitcher not in the Hall of Fame.[39] 
Mussina won seven Gold Glove Awards during his career. All pitchers with 
100 more wins than losses who have been eligible, with the exception of 
Roger Clemens, have been inducted to the Hall of Fame. With a record of 
270–153, Mussina fits that criterion. In 2014, Mussina received 20.3% of 
the vote on his first ballot (75% required for induction).[40] In 2015, 
he received 24.6% on his second ballot. He rose to 43.0% in 2016 on his 
third ballot. Mussina was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame 
on August 25, 2012.[41] Mussina married Jana McKissick in 1997. The couple 
has two sons, Brycen and Peyton. He also adopted his step-daughter Kyra, 
who is Jana's from a previous marriage. He still resides in his hometown 
of Montoursville, where he is well known. He often helps out with the athletic 
programs at his high school and he operates a training camp for student 
athletes in the area.[42] He serves on the Little League International 
Board of Directors, based in nearby South Williamsport, Pennsylvania.[43] 
Mussina is the head basketball coach for the boys' team at Montoursville 
Area High School. He accepted the position in June 2013.[44] Mussina is 
of Slavic descent.[45] Due to his last name, which was Americanized by 
his ancestors, he is often misidentified as an Italian American; before 
the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006, Gene Orza, the chief operating 
officer of the players union, even asked him to play for Italy on that 
assumption.[46] In December 2014, Mussina was announced as one of the six 
recipients of the 2015 Silver Anniversary Awards, presented annually by 
the NCAA to outstanding former student-athletes on the 25th anniversary 
of the end of their college sports careers. The award is based on both 
athletic and professional success.[47] Mussina is also a crossword puzzle 
enthusiast and was featured in the 2006 documentary film Wordplay.[48][49]
