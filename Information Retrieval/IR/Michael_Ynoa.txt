Michael Jose Ynoa Ventura (born September 24, 1991) also known as Michel 
Inoa, is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher for the Chicago White 
Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). Ynoa signed with the Oakland Athletics 
of Major League Baseball (MLB) for the amount of $4.25 million, setting 
a new record for the A's organization after lefty pitcher Mark Mulder was 
signed for 3.2 million in 1998. Ynoa was named the "Number One" and the 
"crown jewel" in the "Best Latino Prospects of 2008."[1] Ynoa is said to 
be the most impressive Latin American player prospect since Félix Hernández 
in 2002.[2] Two MLB teams (Cincinnati Reds, Texas Rangers) "reportedly 
offered Ynoa about $5 million."[3] It was reported that Ynoa signed with 
Oakland after a deal fell through with the New York Yankees. The Yankees 
reportedly broke off talks with Ynoa after agent Adam Katz sought to renegotiate

Athletics traded Ynoa and Jeff Samardzija to the Chicago White Sox in exchange

June 14, 2016, the White Sox promoted Ynoa to the major leagues.[6] "Michel 
Ynoa" is the original spelling of Michael's name. His first name was anglicized 
to "Michael" after he signed with the Oakland Athletics in July 2008.[7] 
Although Michael's last name is more commonly spelled with an "I", as of 
February 2009, he will be using the original spelling "Ynoa." "According 
to A's director of player development Keith Lieppman, [Y]noa will start
