George Florian "Pinch" McBride (November 20, 1880 – July 2, 1973) was an 
American professional baseball shortstop for the Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, and Washington Senators from 1901 to 1920. 
He started off with the short-lived Milwaukee Brewers (they moved to St. 
Louis, Missouri after the 1901 season and became the Browns), but he only 
had 12 at-bats in three games. After stints in semi-pro ball, he joined 
the Pirates in 1905 but was traded mid-season to the Cardinals. He did 
not become a regular starter until the 1908 season, when he joined the 
Senators and became their everyday shortstop. He never hit for a high average 
(his best season was in 1911 when he hit .235 with 11 doubles and 4 triples), 
but was very talented with the glove, leading the American League in fielding 
for four straight seasons (1912 – 1915). He was given the nickname "Pinch" 
for his ability to hit in the clutch. In 1921, he was named manager of 
the Senators, succeeding Clark Griffith, and led the team to an 80–73 record 
(.523 winning percentage). At the end of the 1921 season, he was hit in 
the face with a ball during batting practice, paralyzing one side of his 
face. He was forced to retire from the Senators, but later joined the Detroit 
Tigers. McBride has the lowest batting average in major league history 
of any player with over 5,000 at-bats, with .218.[1] McBride died in Milwaukee,
