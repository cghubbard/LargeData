Charles H. Byrne (September 1843â€“January 4, 1898) was a New York realtor 
who was one of the original founders of the team that became the Brooklyn 
Dodgers. Byrne was a graduate of St. Francis Xavier College, and after 
graduation he worked as a writer for a newspaper.[1] Byrne, his brother-in-law 
Joseph Doyle, New York Herald editor George J. Taylor, and Rhode Island 
casino owner Ferdinand Abell formed a group that raised the money to found 
the Brooklyn ball club in 1883, known originally as simply the "Brooklyns". 
They leased land on Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn to build Washington Park, 
the team's original home, which cost $30,000. In its first year, the team 
played in the minor-league Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball 
Clubs, winning the league championship. Having attracted a following, the 
owners moved the franchise in 1884 to the American Association (AA), a 
competitor to the more established National League (NL), that catered to 
a more working-class crowd.[2] After managing the team from 1885-1887,[3] 
Byrne saw the franchise join the National League in 1890, and remained 
in the ownership group until his death in 1898. Under his tenure, the team, 
known variously as the Grays, Grooms, Bridegrooms and Dodgers, posted a 
record of 567-506 and won two league championships (the AA in 1889 and 
the NL in 1890).[4] Byrne was in ill health at the time of the National 
League meeting in November 1897,[1] but he insisted on making the journey 
from Virginia, where he had been recovering, to the event in Philadelphia.[1] 
After the meeting concluded, his health took a turn for the worse, from 
which he never recovered.[1] Byrne was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Woodside,
