Larry Eugene Hisle (born May 5, 1947) is a former outfielder in Major League 
Baseball who played with the Philadelphia Phillies (1968–71), Minnesota 
Twins (1973–77) and Milwaukee Brewers (1978–82). He batted and threw right-handed. 
A torn rotator cuff suffered in April 1979 severely limited his playing 
time for the remainder of his career. Larry Hisle is currently employed 
with the Milwaukee Brewers and holds the title of Manager of Youth Outreach, 
and is the President of Major League Mentoring, a youth mentoring program 
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was formerly the hitting coach for the Toronto 
Blue Jays helping them to World Series titles in 1992 and 1993. Under his 
coaching in 1993 Blue Jays John Olerud, (former Brewer teammate) Paul Molitor 
and Roberto Alomar finished 1-2-3 in the American League respectively in 
batting average. In a 14-season career, Hisle posted a .273 batting average 
with 166 home runs and 674 RBI in 1197 games played. He led the American 
League in RBIs in 1977 with 119 which was 4 more than runner up Bobby Bonds. 
His best seasons were 1977 (.302 BA, 28 HR, 119 RBI) and 1978 (.290 BA, 
34 HR, 115 RBI). He was the first MLB player to serve as a designated hitter, 
during a spring training game for the Minnesota Twins in 1973. In his first 
two at-bats as a DH, he hit a three-run home run, then a grand slam.[1] 
Ron Blomberg of the New York Yankees would become the first DH in a regular-season
