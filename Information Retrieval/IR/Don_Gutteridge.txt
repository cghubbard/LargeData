As player As manager Donald Joseph Gutteridge (June 19, 1912 – September 
7, 2008) was an American infielder, coach and manager in Major League Baseball 
who played for the St. Louis Cardinals, St. Louis Browns, Boston Red Sox 
and Pittsburgh Pirates, and later managed the Chicago White Sox in 1969–1970. 
He was born in Pittsburg, Kansas, and was the first cousin of former MLB 
catcher Ray Mueller. Gutteridge played his first game for the Cardinals 
at age 24, and in only his second career major league game had six hits 
in a doubleheader, including an inside-the-park home run and two steals 
of home plate. He was an average hitter with excellent speed and fielding 
ability (he turned five double plays in a game in 1944 during the Browns' 
only pennant-winning season). Gutteridge was sold to the Red Sox in 1946, 
where he played in his only other World Series. He retired from playing 
after only two games with the Pirates in 1948. Gutteridge coached for the 
White Sox for over a decade (1955–66 and 1968–69), including the 1959 pennant-winning 
team, and in 1969 he succeeded Al Lopez as manager on May 3. He led Chicago 
to a fifth-place finish in the AL West that season and was fired with 26 
games left in the 1970 season on September 1. He was replaced by interim 
manager Bill Adair. His record over those two partial seasons was 109–172 
(.388). Gutteridge died on September 7, 2008, in his hometown of Pittsburg 
after contracting pneumonia.[1] At the time of his death, Gutteridge was 
the oldest living former manager or coach in Major League Baseball. He
