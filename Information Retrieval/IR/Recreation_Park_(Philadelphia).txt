Left – 300 ft. Center – 331 ft. Recreation Park was a baseball park in 
Philadelphia. The ballpark was the first home of the Philadelphia Phillies 
of the National League during the years 1883–1886, prior to the opening 
of the arena that became known as Baker Bowl. The park was bounded by 24th 
Street, Ridge Avenue, 25th Street and Columbia Avenue (which in 1987 was 
renamed Cecil B. Moore Avenue after the civil-rights leader). The park 
was not the only one in the area; 14 years later, Columbia Park, the first 
home of the Philadelphia Athletics, opened eight blocks to the west on 
Columbia Avenue, though this ballpark was on the opposite side of the avenue. 
The field was used at least as early as June 16, 1860, when Equity defeated 
Pennsylvania 65-52 in what author Charles Peverelly, writing about "the 
national game", called the "first baseball game played in Pennsylvania."[1] 
During the Civil War, a cavalry of the Union Army occupied the park. In 
1866, with new houses bordering the field, a nine-foot fence was erected 
and the field was put back in shape for baseball. But it was poorly maintained 
by 1871 and used less and less. The Philadelphia Centennials of the National 
Association leveled and resodded the field, built a 10-foot fence, clubhouse 
and grandstands in 1875. They called it Centennial Park. The league folded 
that year, and the park declined. Alfred J. Reach bought the field in 1882, 
renaming it "Recreation Park". He cleared the grounds, resodded the field, 
built a three-section wooden grandstand and fielded the independent team 
called "Fillies." There is no historical marker or any indication that 
a ballpark once stood on this site. As of October 2015, a mini market stands 
on the corner where home plate was located, and urban housing occupies
