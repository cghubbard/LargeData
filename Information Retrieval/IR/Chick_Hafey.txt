Charles James "Chick" Hafey (February 12, 1903, in Berkeley, California 
– July 2, 1973, in Calistoga, California) was an American player in Major 
League Baseball (MLB). Playing for the St. Louis Cardinals (1924–1931) 
and Cincinnati Reds (1932–1935, 1937), Hafey was a strong line-drive hitter 
who batted for a high average on a consistent basis. Hafey was part of 
two World Series championship teams (in 1926 and 1931) as a Cardinal and 
also made history with the first hit in an All-Star game, starting in left 
field and batting cleanup for the National League in the 1933 game. He 
was selected by the Veterans Committee for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1971. In 2014, the Cardinals inducted him into their team hall of fame. 
Hafey was born on February 12, 1903 in Berkeley, California. He attended 
Berkeley High School. The St. Louis Cardinals signed Hafey out of high 
school as a pitcher. However, Cardinals general manager noticed Hafey's 
hitting abilities and decided that Hafey should become an outfielder.[1] 
Hafey played in the minor leagues for the Fort Smith Twins of the Western 
Association in 1923. He moved to the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League 
the next year, hitting .360 before being called up to the Cardinals near 
the end of the season. He split time between the Cardinals and Syracuse 
Stars in 1925.[2] He spent the 1926 season with the Cardinals, but he played 
only 78 games.[3] Hafey was the first major success of Rickey's expansive 
farm system, breaking through in 1927 when he led the National League in 
slugging. Hafey, however, had suffered multiple beanings in 1926. He developed 
sinus trouble and his vision deteriorated, and Hafey began to wear eyeglasses 
while playing. Although Specs Toporcer was the first baseball player to 
wear glasses, Hafey was the most prominent; he is one of two Hall of Famers 
with eyeglasses, Reggie Jackson being the other. Because his vision became 
so variable, Hafey was obliged to rotate among three different pairs of 
glasses. In the field, Hafey was known for having a "rifle arm." He had 
a power peak, averaging 27 home runs and 114 RBI from 1928 to 1930.[4] 
In July 1929, Hafey tied a National League record with ten hits in ten 
consecutive at-bats. In August 1930, he hit for the cycle. In 1931, Hafey 
won one of the closest races for a batting title in history, hitting .349 
to beat New York's Bill Terry by just .0002, and teammate Jim Bottomley 
by .0007. The title was only secured by a hit in Hafey's final at-bat of 
the season. Hafey was fifth in the voting for the 1931 MVP award.[5] When 
Hafey's Cardinals faced Al Simmons' Athletics in the 1931 World Series, 
it marked just the second time that two reigning batting champions had 
opposed one another in the Fall Classic. Although the soft-spoken Hafey 
was overshadowed by some of his raucous Cardinals teammates, he was frequently 
at odds with management. Hafey's 1931 and 1932 seasons both began late 
due to salary disputes. Cardinals general manager Rickey fined Hafey for 
being late and out of shape in 1931. In 1932, coming off his batting title, 
Hafey demanded that the previous year's fine be added to his 1932 salary. 
When Rickey refused, Hafey bolted from St. Louis' spring training camp. 
Rickey responded by trading Hafey to the last-place Cincinnati Reds. Hafey 
was happy to join the Reds, who gave him the raise he had sought, but his 
career faltered. His vision was still erratic, and his persistent sinus 
condition cost him half of the 1932 season, though he hit .344. In 1933, 
he was chosen for the inaugural All Star Game, recording the first-ever 
All-Star hit. Although he maintained a solid batting average as a Red, 
his offensive production decreased. In June 1935, suffering from sinus 
problems and influenza, he returned to his ranch near Berkeley and his 
relatives there said that he would not return to baseball that season. 
The team wanted team surgeons to perform sinus surgery, but Hafey planned 
to have a procedure performed by his own doctor.[6] He tried a minor league 
comeback in 1936, but he gave that up in April because he was experiencing 
vision problems and dizzy spells still attributed to sinusitis.[7] Hafey 
announced that he would attempt another comeback with the Reds in February 
1937.[8] Not long after that, Hafey abandoned that comeback due to a salary 
dispute. In May, he announced that he would work out with a Pacific Coast 
League team to work his way back to the Cardinals.[9] He hit .261 in 89 
major league games that year. He was released before the 1938 season by 
general manager Warren Giles when they could not agree to contract terms.[10] 
He finished his career batting .317, with 164 home runs and 833 RBI. Hafey 
played in four World Series, hitting .205 in 92 plate appearances. In 1981, 
Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Hafey in their book The 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players of All Time. They cited what they called "the Smoky Joe 
Wood Syndrome," where a player of truly exceptional talent might rank with 
the all-time greats on merit, despite a career sharply curtailed by injury. 
Hafey was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. In January 2014, 
the Cardinals announced Hafey among 22 former players and personnel to 
be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural
