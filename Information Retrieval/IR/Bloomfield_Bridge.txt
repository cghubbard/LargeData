The Bloomfield Bridge carries four lanes of traffic across a steep ravine 
between the densely populated Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Bloomfield and 
Polish Hill. The first Bloomfield Bridge was built in 1914 by the Fort 
Pitt Bridge Works and was 2,100 feet (640Â m) long. It was closed in 1978 
and demolished in 1980. The replacement crossing was erected in 1986, after 
the previous bridge was deemed deficient after years of heavy traffic, 
including that of popular Pittsburgh Railways streetcar lines until their 
1960s conversion to buses. Although the first Bloomfield Bridge was closed 
in 1978, state funding issues halted work on the construction of a successor 
until 1984. On the Bloomfield side of the bridge, connections are made 
to Liberty Avenue, the commercial heart of the traditionally Italian (and 
increasingly Asian) neighborhood. On the Polish Hill side, PA 380 can be 
accessed, which runs toward Downtown Pittsburgh and Oakland, the home of 
several major universities. The Bloomfield Bridge spans a large number 
of railroad tracks, which are portions of lines managed by CSX and Norfolk 
Southern. The Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, a bus rapid transit system, 
also traverses the ravine. Also under the edifice is a community football 
and baseball field. Originally known as Dean's Field, it is historically 
significant as the place where Johnny Unitas played semi-pro football before 
jumpstarting his NFL career. After a shootout that killed three police 
officers, the area was renamed after a fallen officer who resided nearby.[1]
