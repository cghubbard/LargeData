Joshua Michael Johnson (born January 31, 1984), nicknamed "JJ", is a Canadian-American[1][2] 
starting pitcher with the San Francisco Giants organization. He has pitched 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida/Miami Marlins and Toronto 
Blue Jays. Johnson graduated from Jenks High School in Jenks, Oklahoma 
in 2002, when he was Tulsa World All-Metro Player of the Year.[3] He helped 
lead the Trojans to two State Championships during his high school career.[citation

amateur draft. The righty made his professional baseball debut soon after 
with the Gulf Coast Marlins, earning a 0.60 earned run average (ERA) over 
15 innings. As a starter with Single-A Greensboro during the 2003 season, 
Johnson continued to limit his opponents' offensive numbers, collecting 
a paltry .223 opponent batting average. In 2004, he saw more success with 
Single-A Jupiter. Despite a 5–12 record, Johnson's ERA remained a solid 
3.38.[citation needed] His performance at the Single-A level earned Johnson 
a promotion to Double-A Carolina in 2005. He was named the Marlins' Minor 
League Pitcher of the Year [4] after a 12–4 record, a 3.87 ERA and a Southern 
League All-Star nod for Carolina. Johnson made his major league debut September 
10, 2005, for the Marlins with a scoreless inning of relief against the 
Philadelphia Phillies. During the 2006 season, Johnson broke onto the Major 
League scene by going (11–5) as a starter, while tallying a 3.03 ERA in 
that role. After spending all of April in the Florida bullpen, Johnson 
emerged as a major contributor in the Marlins' young, but surprisingly 
successful, starting staff. In 2006 Johnson and fellow Marlin pitchers 
Scott Olsen, Aníbal Sánchez and Ricky Nolasco became the first quartet 
of rookie pitchers in major league history to each record 10 wins.[5] He 
sat out the final three weeks of the season with forearm stiffness.[6] 
His 3.10 overall ERA would have tied him for third in the National League, 
but he fell five innings short of qualifying for the title.[6] Johnson 
also placed fourth in voting for the National League Rookie of the Year,[7] 
an award that went to his fellow Florida teammate, shortstop Hanley Ramírez. 
Johnson began the 2007 season on the disabled list with an irritated ulnar 
nerve.[6] After returning in June, he was again sidelined by elbow stiffness 
in July and had Tommy John ligament-replacement surgery on August 3, 2007.[8] 
He recovered surprisingly quickly and made his return to the Major Leagues 
on July 10, 2008, only eleven months after having undergone surgery.[9] 
He made 14 starts in 2008, posting a 3.61 ERA. Johnson hit his first career 
home run off of Milwaukee's Dave Bush on June 4, 2009. On July 5, 2009, 
Johnson was selected to the National League All-Star squad for the first 
time but did not play in the game. On August 14, Johnson took a no-hitter 
into the 7th inning against the Colorado Rockies, but it was broken up 
by a Garrett Atkins home run.[10] He finished 2009 with a 15-5 record and 
a 3.23 ERA with 191 strike-outs in 209 innings.[citation needed] On January 
15, 2010 Johnson agreed to a four-year contract with the Marlins worth 
$39 million.[11] On May 29, 2010, Johnson lost to the Phillies 1–0, as 
Roy Halladay threw a perfect game. In July 2010, he was selected to his 
second consecutive All-Star Game, which took place in Anaheim. Johnson 
pitched two perfect innings in the game, notably striking out Derek Jeter 
and Ichiro Suzuki. 2010 was also a record-setting year for Johnson, who 
gave up three runs or less in twelve consecutive starts. On the 28th of 
July, Johnson had started 21 games, and in those starts, only allowed more 
than three earned runs once, giving up only one earned run eight times 
and no earned runs six times. Johnson finished the 2010 season second in 
the Majors in ERA (2.30), leading the National League, trailing only Félix 
Hernández of Seattle. He finished 11–6 with 186 strikeouts in 28 starts, 
his year shortened by back pain. He made his final start of the season 
on September 4 against Atlanta. At the beginning of the 2011 year Johnson 
kept a no-hitter at least to the fifth inning four out of the first five 
times he took the mound. The high point being the game against the Atlanta 
Braves in which Johnson went into the eighth until there was a broken bat 
single by Braves hitter Freddie Freeman. His 2011-year ended short as he 
missed the rest of the season due to a right shoulder inflammation. In 
2012, Johnson was named the Opening Day starter for the Marlins for the 
third straight year, although he was coming off from a shoulder inflammation 
injury. On April 4, 2012, Johnson pitched 6 innings against Kyle Lohse 
and the St. Louis Cardinals in the Marlin's first game in Marlins Park. 
Johnson finished his last season with Miami with an 8–14 record and an 
ERA of 3.81. On November 19, 2012, Johnson was traded to the Toronto Blue 
Jays along with Mark Buehrle, José Reyes, John Buck, and Emilio Bonifacio, 
in exchange for Jeff Mathis, Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson Álvarez, Yunel 
Escobar, Jake Marisnick, Anthony DeSclafani, and Justin Nicolino.[12] On 
February 5, 2013, manager John Gibbons named Johnson the number 4 starter 
for the upcoming season.[13] Johnson made 4 starts for the Blue Jays before 
missing a start on April 26, due to a sore right triceps muscle. He was 
expected to make his next scheduled start but was instead placed on the 
disabled list due to inflammation. Ricky Romero was called up to take his 
place in the starting lineup.[14][15] He had one rehab start for the Class-A 
Dunedin Blue Jays before being moved to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons for 
his second rehab start on May 25. This was his debut at the Triple-A level, 
as he had skipped that level while in the Marlins' organization.[citation 
needed] On May 31, the Blue Jays announced that Johnson would be activated 
from the disabled list and start against the San Francisco Giants on June 
4.[16] Johnson pitched 7 innings in his return from the disabled list and 
took the loss, allowing 2 runs (only 1 earned run), with no walks and 6 
strikeouts.[17] Johnson earned his first win as a Blue Jay on June 23 against 
the Baltimore Orioles, which extended the Jays' winning streak to 11 games, 
tying the franchise record.[18] After earning his first win, Johnson lost 
6 consecutive starts, the longest such streak of his career. During his 
losing streak, his ERA rose from 4.60 to a career-high 6.60. Johnson earned 
his second win of the season on August 6, against the Seattle Mariners. 
He was scratched from his scheduled next start on August 12 due to forearm 
tightness, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 13.[19] 
Johnson finished the 2013 season on the disabled list, and posted a dismal 
2–8 record, a 6.20 earned run average, and 83 strikeouts over 81 1⁄3 innings. 
On October 1, 2013, Johnson underwent surgery to remove bone spurs from 
his right elbow. The surgery was performed by Dr. James Andrews and required 
5 weeks of recovery.[20] On November 19, 2013, Johnson agreed to a one-year, 
$8 million contract with the San Diego Padres. If he made fewer than 7 
starts with the team, they could have exercised a $4 million option for 
the 2015 season.[7][21] The Padres organization reported on March 22, 2014, 
that Johnson would open the season on the disabled list due to a strained 
right forearm/elbow muscle, and was initially expected to miss at least 
4–5 weeks. On April 15, it was announced that he would see Dr. James Andrews 
for a consultation on his injured elbow, and could opt for his second Tommy 
John surgery.[22] The Padres reported on April 23 that Johnson would undergo 
Tommy John surgery, and miss the 2014 season.[23] On October 30, the Padres 
declined Johnson's option, making him a free agent.[24] On January 7, 2015, 
he re-signed with the Padres on a one-year contract with $1 million guaranteed.[25] 
Johnson threw a simulated game on April 28, but experienced triceps tightness 
as well as a nerve issue in his neck. He would rest with these injuries 
until August 27, when he threw 16 pitches in another simulated game.[26] 
On September 16, it was announced that Johnson would undergo a third Tommy 
John surgery, and miss the entire 2016 season.[27] Attempting another comeback 
from Tommy John surgery, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the 
San Francisco Giants on November 1, 2016.[28] Both of Johnson's parents 
are Canadian and his father spent his years growing up in Calgary, Alberta 
before the family relocated to the U.S.[29] Johnson himself was born in
