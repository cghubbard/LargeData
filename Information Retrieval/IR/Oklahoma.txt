English Oklahoma i/ˌoʊkləˈhoʊmə/[7] (Cherokee: Asgaya gigageyi / ᎠᏍᎦᏯ ᎩᎦᎨᏱ;[8] 
or transliterated from English as ᎣᎦᎳᎰᎹ (òɡàlàhoma), Pawnee: Uukuhuúwa,[9] 
Cayuga: Gahnawiyoˀgeh[10]) is a state located in the South Central United 
States.[11] Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous 
of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words 
okla and humma, meaning "red people".[12] It is also known informally by 
its nickname, The Sooner State, in reference to the non-Native settlers 
who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official 
opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the 
door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled 
upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and 
Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became 
the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as Oklahomans, 
or informally "Okies", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. 
A major producer of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma 
relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and 
biotechnology.[13] In 2007, it had one of the fastest-growing economies 
in the United States, ranking among the top states in per capita income 
growth and gross domestic product growth.[14][15] Oklahoma City and Tulsa 
serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of 
Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas.[16] With 
small mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma 
lies in the Great Plains, Cross Timbers and the U.S. Interior Highlands—a 
region especially prone to severe weather.[17] In addition to having a 
prevalence of English, German, Scottish, Scotch-Irish, and Native American 
ancestry, more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma,[18] 
second only to California. Oklahoma is located on a confluence of three 
major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for 
cattle drives, a destination for southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned 
territory for Native Americans. The name Oklahoma comes from the Choctaw 
phrase okla humma, literally meaning red people. Choctaw Chief Allen Wright 
suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal 
government regarding the use of Indian Territory, in which he envisioned 
an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian 
Affairs. Equivalent to the English word Indian, okla humma was a phrase 
in the Choctaw language used to describe Native American people as a whole. 
Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory, and it 
was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to 
white settlers.[12][19][20] Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United 
States, covering an area of 69,898 square miles (181,035 km2), with 68,667 
square miles (177847 km2) of land and 1,281 square miles (3,188 km2) of 
water.[21] It is one of six states on the Frontier Strip and lies partly 
in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. 
It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, 
on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the 
south and near-west by Texas. Much of its border with Texas lies along 
the Red River. The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge is out of alignment 
with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is actually 2.1 to 
2.2 miles east of the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico 
was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set 
along the 103rd Meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed 
using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered 
the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian. Surveying techniques 
were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 
2.2 miles to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for 
Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement 
of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd Meridian. Cimarron 
County in Oklahoma's panhandle is the only county in the United States 
that touches four other states: New Mexico, Texas, Colorado and Kansas. 
Oklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf 
of Mexico watershed,[22] generally sloping from the high plains of its 
western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary.[23][24] 
Its highest and lowest points follow this trend, with its highest peak, 
Black Mesa, at 4,973 feet (1,516 m) above sea level, situated near its 
far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The state's lowest point 
is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town 
of Idabel, Oklahoma, which dips to 289 feet (88 m) above sea level.[25] 
Among the most geographically diverse states, Oklahoma is one of four to 
harbor more than 10 distinct ecological regions, with 11 in its borders 
– more per square mile than in any other state.[17] Its western and eastern 
halves, however, are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity: 
Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half 
contains three. Although having fewer ecological regions Western Oklahoma 
contains many rare, relic species.[17] Oklahoma has four primary mountain 
ranges: the Ouachita Mountains, the Arbuckle Mountains, the Wichita Mountains, 
and the Ozark Mountains.[23] Contained within the U.S. Interior Highlands 
region, the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains mark the only major mountainous 
region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians.[26] A portion 
of the Flint Hills stretches into north-central Oklahoma, and near the 
state's eastern border, Cavanal Hill is regarded by the Oklahoma Tourism 
& Recreation Department as the world's tallest hill; at 1,999 feet (609 m), 
it fails their definition of a mountain by one foot.[27] The semi-arid 
high plains in the state's northwestern corner harbor few natural forests; 
the region has a rolling to flat landscape with intermittent canyons and 
mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains. Partial plains interrupted by small, 
sky island mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and the Wichita Mountains 
dot southwestern Oklahoma; transitional prairie and oak savannahs cover 
the central portion of the state. The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains rise 
from west to east over the state's eastern third, gradually increasing 
in elevation in an eastward direction.[24][28] More than 500 named creeks 
and rivers make up Oklahoma's waterways, and with 200 lakes created by 
dams, it holds the nation's highest number of artificial reservoirs.[27] 
Most of the state lies in two primary drainage basins belonging to the 
Red and Arkansas rivers, though the Lee and Little rivers also contain 
significant drainage basins.[28] Due to Oklahoma's location at the confluence 
of many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have a high rate 
of biodiversity for their size. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma[27] 
and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass 
prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western 
portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses.[29] Where 
rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and 
shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red 
cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in 
the panhandle's far western reaches.[29] Southwestern Oklahoma contains 
many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina 
and southern live oak. Marshlands, cypress forests and mixtures of shortleaf 
pine, loblolly pine, blue palmetto, and deciduous forests dominate the 
state's southeastern quarter, while mixtures of largely post oak, elm, 
red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and pine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma.[28][29][30] 
The state holds populations of white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope, 
coyotes, mountain lions, bobcats, elk, and birds such as quail, doves, 
cardinals, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, and pheasants. In prairie ecosystems, 
American bison, greater prairie chickens, badgers, and armadillo are common, 
and some of the nation's largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie 
in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from 
prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. 
The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear, red fox, grey fox, and river 
otter populations, which coexist with a total of 328 vertebrate species 
in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American 
alligator.[29] Oklahoma has 50 state parks,[31] six national parks or protected 
regions,[32] two national protected forests or grasslands,[33] and a network 
of wildlife preserves and conservation areas. Six percent of the state's 
10 million acres (40,000 km2) of forest is public land,[30] including the 
western portions of the Ouachita National Forest, the largest and oldest 
national forest in the Southern United States.[34] With 39,000 acres (158 km2), 
the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in north-central Oklahoma is the largest 
protected area of tallgrass prairie in the world and is part of an ecosystem 
that encompasses only 10 percent of its former land area, once covering 
14 states.[35] In addition, the Black Kettle National Grassland covers 
31,300 acres (127 km2) of prairie in southwestern Oklahoma.[36] The Wichita 
Mountains Wildlife Refuge is the oldest and largest of nine national wildlife 
refuges in the state[37] and was founded in 1901, encompassing 59,020 acres 
(238.8 km2).[38] Of Oklahoma's federally protected park or recreational 
sites; the Chickasaw National Recreation Area is the largest, with 9,898.63 
acres (18 km2).[39] Other sites include the Santa Fe and Trail of Tears 
national historic trails, the Fort Smith and Washita Battlefield national 
historic sites, and the Oklahoma City National Memorial.[32] Oklahoma is 
located in a humid subtropical region.[40] Oklahoma lies in a transition 
zone between humid continental climate to the north, semi-arid climate 
to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern 
portions of the state. Most of the state lies in an area known as Tornado 
Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from 
Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and 
warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these 
three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, 
damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency 
virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth.[25] An average 62 tornadoes 
strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.[41] Because 
of Oklahoma's position between zones of differing prevailing temperature 
and winds, weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively 
short distances and can change drastically in a short time.[25] As an example, 
on November 11, 1911, the temperature at Oklahoma City reached 83 °F (28 °C) 
in the afternoon (the record high for that date), then an Arctic cold front 
of unprecedented intensity slammed across the state, causing the temperature 
to crash 66 degrees, down to 17 °F (−8 °C) at midnight (the record low 
for that date); thus, both the record high and record low for November 
11 were set on the same date.[42] This type of phenomenon is also responsible 
for many of the tornadoes in the area, such as the 1912 Oklahoma tornado 
outbreak, when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front, resulting 
in an average of about one tornado per hour over the course of a day.[43] 
The humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa) of central, southern and eastern 
Oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from 
the Gulf of Mexico. Traveling westward, the climate transitions progressively 
toward a semi-arid zone (Koppen BSk) in the high plains of the Panhandle 
and other western areas from about Lawton westward, less frequently touched 
by southern moisture.[40] Precipitation and temperatures decline from east 
to west accordingly, with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature 
of 62 °F (17 °C) and an annual rainfall of generally over 40 inches (1,020 mm) 
and up to 56 inches (1,420 mm), while areas of the (higher-elevation) panhandle 
average 58 °F (14 °C), with an annual rainfall under 17 inches (430 mm).[44] 
Over almost all of Oklahoma, winter is the driest season. Average monthly 
precipitation increases dramatically in the spring to a peak in May, the 
wettest month over most of the state, with its frequent and not uncommonly 
severe thunderstorm activity. Early June can still be wet, but most years 
see a marked decrease in rainfall during June and early July. Mid-summer 
(July and August) represents a secondary dry season over much of Oklahoma, 
with long stretches of hot weather with only sporadic thunderstorm activity 
not uncommon many years. Severe drought is common in the hottest summers, 
such as those of 1934, 1954, 1980 and 2011, all of which featured weeks 
on end of virtual rainlessness and high temperatures well over 100 °F (38 °C). 
Average precipitation rises again from September to mid-October, representing 
a secondary wetter season, then declines from late October through December.[25] 
All of the state frequently experiences temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C) 
or below 0 °F (−18 °C),[40] though below-zero temperatures are rare in 
south-central and southeastern Oklahoma. Snowfall ranges from an average 
of less than 4 inches (10 cm) in the south to just over 20 inches (51 cm) 
on the border of Colorado in the panhandle.[25] The state is home to the 
Storm Prediction Center, the National Severe Storms Laboratory, and the 
Warning Decision Training Branch, all part of the National Weather Service 
and located in Norman.[45] Oklahoma's highest recorded temperature of 120 °F 
(49 °C) was recorded at Tipton on June 27, 1994 and the lowest recorded 
temperature of −31 °F (−35 °C) was recorded at Nowata on February 10, 2011. 
Evidence exists that native peoples traveled through Oklahoma as early 
as the last ice age.[48] Ancestors of the Wichita and Caddo lived in what 
is now Oklahoma. The Panhandle culture peoples were precontact residents 
of the panhandle region. The westernmost center of the Mississippian culture 
was Spiro Mounds, in what is now Spiro, Oklahoma, which flourished between 
AD 850 and 1450.[49][50] Spaniard Francisco Vásquez de Coronado traveled 
through the state in 1541,[51] but French explorers claimed the area in 
the 1700s[52] and it remained under French rule until 1803, when all the 
French territory west of the Mississippi River was purchased by the United 
States in the Louisiana Purchase.[51] The territory now known as Oklahoma 
was first a part of the Arkansas Territory from 1819 until 1828. During 
the 19th century, thousands of Native Americans were expelled from their 
ancestral homelands from across North America and transported to the area 
including and surrounding present-day Oklahoma. The Choctaw was the first 
of the Five Civilized Tribes to be removed from the southeastern United 
States. The phrase "Trail of Tears" originated from a description of the 
removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831, although the term is usually used 
for the Cherokee removal.[53] A total of 17,000 Cherokees and 2,000 of 
their black slaves were deported.[54] The area, already occupied by Osage 
and Quapaw tribes, was called for the Choctaw Nation until revised Native 
American and then later American policy redefined the boundaries to include 
other Native Americans. By 1890, more than 30 Native American nations and 
tribes had been concentrated on land within Indian Territory or "Indian 
Country".[55] All Five Civilized Tribes supported and signed treaties with 
the Confederate military during the American Civil War. The Cherokee Nation 
had an internal civil war.[56] Slavery in Indian Territory was not abolished 
until 1866.[57] In the period between 1866 and 1899,[51] cattle ranches 
in Texas strove to meet the demands for food in eastern cities and railroads 
in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner. Cattle trails and cattle 
ranches developed as cowboys either drove their product north or settled 
illegally in Indian Territory.[51] In 1881, four of five major cattle trails 
on the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory.[58] Increased 
presence of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States 
Government to establish the Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands 
of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging 
farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating 
land to the federal government. In the process, railroad companies took 
nearly half of Indian-held land within the territory for outside settlers 
and for purchase.[59] Major land runs, including the Land Run of 1889, 
were held for settlers where certain territories were opened to settlement 
starting at a precise time. Usually land was open to settlers on a first 
come first served basis.[60] Those who broke the rules by crossing the 
border into the territory before the official opening time were said to 
have been crossing the border sooner, leading to the term sooners, which 
eventually became the state's official nickname.[61] Deliberations to make 
the territory into a state began near the end of the 19th century, when 
the Curtis Act continued the allotment of Indian tribal land. Attempts 
to create an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt to create 
an all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention 
of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, 
which took place two years later.[62] On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was 
established as the 46th state in the Union. The new state became a focal 
point for the emerging oil industry, as discoveries of oil pools prompted 
towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth. Tulsa eventually became 
known as the "Oil Capital of the World" for most of the 20th century and 
oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy.[63] In 1927, 
Oklahoman businessman Cyrus Avery, known as the "Father of Route 66", began 
the campaign to create U.S. Route 66. Using a stretch of highway from Amarillo, 
Texas to Tulsa, Oklahoma to form the original portion of Highway 66, Avery 
spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Highway 66 Association to oversee 
the planning of Route 66, based in his hometown of Tulsa.[64] Oklahoma 
also has a rich African American history. There were many black towns that 
thrived in the early 20th century because of black settlers moving from 
neighboring states, especially Kansas. The politician Edward P. McCabe 
encouraged black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory. He 
discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma 
a majority-black state. By the early 20th century, the Greenwood neighborhood 
of Tulsa was one of the most prosperous African-American communities in 
the United States.[65] Jim Crow laws had established racial segregation 
since before the start of the 20th century, but the blacks had created 
a thriving area. Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the 
Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites 
attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in 
American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 
$1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high 
as 300 people.[66] By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to 
negligible influence within the state.[67] During the 1930s, parts of the 
state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practices, extended 
drought and high winds. Known as the Dust Bowl, areas of Kansas, Texas, 
New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little 
rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers 
into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the 
western United States.[68] Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the 
state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent 
as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. 
Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the 
state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and 
dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water 
for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma 
had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.[17][69] In 1995, 
Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic 
terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, 
in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside 
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 
children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government 
on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison 
without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.[70] 
On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.[71][72] 
The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Oklahoma 
was 3,911,338 on July 1, 2015, a 4.26% increase since the 2010 United States 
Census.[74] At the 2010 Census, 68.7% of the population was non-Hispanic 
White, down from 88% in 1970,[75] 7.3% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 
8.2% non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.7% non-Hispanic 
Asian, 0.1% non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 0.1% 
from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 5.1% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). 
8.9% of Oklahoma's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin 
(they may be of any race). As of 2011[update], 47.3% of Oklahoma's population 
younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning that they had at least one 
parent who was not non-Hispanic white.[78] As of 2008[update] Oklahoma 
had a population of 3,642,361[79] with an estimated 2005 ancestral makeup 
of 14.5% German, 13.1% American, 11.8% Irish, 9.6% English, 8.1% African 
American, and 11.4% Native American (including 7.9% Cherokee[80]) though 
the percentage of people claiming American Indian as their only race was 
8.1%.[81] Most people from Oklahoma who self-identify as having American 
ancestry are of overwhelmingly English ancestry with significant amounts 
of Scottish and Welsh inflection as well.[82][83] The state had the second-highest 
number of Native Americans in 2002, estimated at 395,219, as well as the 
second highest percentage among all states.[80] As of 2006[update], 4.7% 
of Oklahoma's residents were foreign born,[84] compared to 12.4% for the 
nation.[85] The center of population of Oklahoma is located in Lincoln 
County near the town of Sparks.[86] The state's 2006 per capita personal 
income ranked 37th at $32,210, though it has the third fastest-growing 
per capita income in the nation[14] and ranks consistently among the lowest 
states in cost of living index.[87] The Oklahoma City suburb Nichols Hills 
is first on Oklahoma locations by per capita income at $73,661, though 
Tulsa County holds the highest average.[88][89] In 2011, 7.0% of Oklahomans 
were under the age of 5, 24.7% under 18, and 13.7% were 65 or older. Females 
made up 50.5% of the population.[90] The English language has been official 
in the state of Oklahoma since 2010.[91] The variety of North American 
English spoken is called Oklahoma English, and this dialect is quite diverse 
with its uneven blending of features of North Midland, South Midland, and 
Southern dialects.[92] In 2000, 2,977,187 Oklahomans—92.6% of the resident 
population five years or older—spoke only English at home, a decrease from 
95% in 1990.[92] 238,732 Oklahoma residents reported speaking a language 
other than English in the 2,000 census, about 7.4% of the total population 
of the state.[92] Spanish is the second-most commonly spoken language in 
the state, with 141,060 speakers counted in 2000.[92] The most commonly 
spoken native North American language is Cherokee, with 10,000 speakers 
living within the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area of eastern Oklahoma.[93] 
Cherokee is an official language in the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction 
area and in the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.[1][2][3] German 
has 13,444 speakers representing about 0.4% of the total state population,[92] 
and Vietnamese is spoken by 11,330 people,[92] or about 0.4% of the population,[92] 
many of whom live in the Asia District of Oklahoma City. Other languages 
include French with 8,258 speakers (0.3%), Chinese with 6,413 (0.2%), Korean 
with 3,948 (0.1%), Arabic with 3,265 (0.1%), other Asian languages with 
3,134 (0.1%), Tagalog with 2,888 (0.1%), Japanese with 2,546 (0.1%), and 
African languages with 2,546 (0.1%).[92] In addition to Cherokee, more 
than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma,[18] second only 
to California (though, it should be noted that only Cherokee exhibits language 
vitality at present). Oklahoma is part of a geographical region characterized 
by conservative and Evangelical Christianity known as the "Bible Belt". 
Spanning the southern and eastern parts of the United States, the area 
is known for politically and socially conservative views, with the Republican 
Party having the greater number of voters registered between the two parties.[95] 
Tulsa, the state's second-largest city, home to Oral Roberts University, 
is sometimes called the "buckle of the Bible Belt".[96][97] According to 
the Pew Research Center, the majority of Oklahoma's religious adherents 
are Christian, accounting for about 80 percent of the population. The percentage 
of Oklahomans affiliated with Catholicism is half of the national average, 
while the percentage affiliated with Evangelical Protestantism is more 
than twice the national average – tied with Arkansas for the largest percentage 
of any state.[98] In 2010, the state's largest church memberships were 
in the Southern Baptist Convention (886,394 members), the United Methodist 
Church (282,347), the Roman Catholic Church (178,430), and the Assemblies 
of God (85,926). Other religions represented in the state include Buddhism, 
Hinduism, and Islam.[99] In 2000, there were about 5,000 Jews and 6,000 
Muslims, with 10 congregations to each group.[100] Oklahoma religious makeup:[100][A] 
Oklahoma is host to a diverse range of sectors including aviation, energy, 
transportation equipment, food processing, electronics, and telecommunications. 
Oklahoma is an important producer of natural gas, aircraft, and food.[13] 
The state ranks third in the nation for production of natural gas, is the 
27th-most agriculturally productive state, and also ranks 5th in production 
of wheat.[101] Four Fortune 500 companies and six Fortune 1000 companies 
are headquartered in Oklahoma,[102] and it has been rated one of the most 
business-friendly states in the nation,[103] with the 7th-lowest tax burden 
in 2007.[104] In 2010, Oklahoma City-based Love's Travel Stops & Country 
Stores ranked 18th on the Forbes list of largest private companies, Tulsa-based 
QuikTrip ranked 37th, and Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby ranked 198th 
in 2010 report.[105] Oklahoma's gross domestic product grew from $131.9 
billion in 2006 to $147.5 billion in 2010, a jump of 10.6 percent.[106] 
Oklahoma's gross domestic product per capita was $35,480 in 2010, which 
was ranked 40th among the states.[107] Though oil has historically dominated 
the state's economy, a collapse in the energy industry during the 1980s 
led to the loss of nearly 90,000 energy-related jobs between 1980 and 2000, 
severely damaging the local economy.[108] Oil accounted for 35 billion 
dollars in Oklahoma's economy in 2007,[109] and employment in the state's 
oil industry was outpaced by five other industries in 2007.[110] As of 
September 2015[update], the state's unemployment rate is 4.4%.[111] In 
mid-2011, Oklahoma had a civilian labor force of 1.7 million and total 
non-farm employment fluctuated around 1.5 million.[110] The government 
sector provides the most jobs, with 339,300 in 2011, followed by the transportation 
and utilities sector, providing 279,500 jobs, and the sectors of education, 
business, and manufacturing, providing 207,800, 177,400, and 132,700 jobs, 
respectively.[110] Among the state's largest industries, the aerospace 
sector generates $11 billion annually.[103] Tulsa is home to the largest 
airline maintenance base in the world, which serves as the global maintenance 
and engineering headquarters for American Airlines.[112] In total, aerospace 
accounts for more than 10 percent of Oklahoma's industrial output, and 
it is one of the top 10 states in aerospace engine manufacturing.[13] Because 
of its position in the center of the United States, Oklahoma is also among 
the top states for logistic centers, and a major contributor to weather-related 
research.[103] The state is the top manufacturer of tires in North America 
and contains one of the fastest-growing biotechnology industries in the 
nation.[103] In 2005, international exports from Oklahoma's manufacturing 
industry totaled $4.3 billion, accounting for 3.6 percent of its economic 
impact.[113] Tire manufacturing, meat processing, oil and gas equipment 
manufacturing, and air conditioner manufacturing are the state's largest 
manufacturing industries.[114] Oklahoma is the nation's third-largest producer 
of natural gas, fifth-largest producer of crude oil, and has the second-greatest 
number of active drilling rigs,[109][115] and ranks fifth in crude oil 
reserves.[116] While the state ranked eighth for installed wind energy 
capacity in 2011,[117] it is at the bottom of states in usage of renewable 
energy, with 94 percent of its electricity being generated by non-renewable 
sources in 2009, including 25 percent from coal and 46 percent from natural 
gas.[118] Oklahoma has no nuclear power. Ranking 13th for total energy 
consumption per capita in 2009,[119] Oklahoma's energy costs were 8th lowest 
in the nation.[120] As a whole, the oil energy industry contributes $35 
billion to Oklahoma's gross domestic product, and employees of Oklahoma 
oil-related companies earn an average of twice the state's typical yearly 
income.[109] In 2009, the state had 83,700 commercial oil wells churning 
65.374 million barrels (10,393,600 m3) of crude oil.[121] Eight and a half 
percent of the nation's natural gas supply is held in Oklahoma, with 1.673 trillion 
cubic feet (47.4 km3) being produced in 2009.[121] According to Forbes 
magazine, Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corporation, Chesapeake Energy 
Corporation, and SandRidge Energy Corporation are the largest private oil-related 
companies in the nation,[122] and all of Oklahoma's Fortune 500 companies 
are energy-related.[102] Tulsa's ONEOK and Williams Companies are the state's 
largest and second-largest companies respectively, also ranking as the 
nation's second- and third-largest companies in the field of energy, according 
to Fortune magazine.[123] The magazine also placed Devon Energy as the 
second-largest company in the mining and crude oil-producing industry in 
the nation, while Chesapeake Energy ranks seventh respectively in that 
sector and Oklahoma Gas & Electric ranks as the 25th-largest gas and electric 
utility company.[123] Oklahoma Gas & Electric, commonly referred to as 
OG&E (NYSE: OGE) operates four base electric power plants in Oklahoma. 
Two of them are coal-fired power plants: one in Muskogee, and the other 
in Redrock. Two are gas-fired power plants: one in Harrah and the other 
in Konawa. OG&E was the first electric company in Oklahoma to generate 
electricity from wind farms in 2003.[124] Source:[125][126] The 27th-most 
agriculturally productive state, Oklahoma is fifth in cattle production 
and fifth in production of wheat.[101][127] Approximately 5.5 percent of 
American beef comes from Oklahoma, while the state produces 6.1 percent 
of American wheat, 4.2 percent of American pig products, and 2.2 percent 
of dairy products.[101] The state had 85,500 farms in 2012, collectively 
producing $4.3 billion in animal products and fewer than one billion dollars 
in crop output with more than $6.1 billion added to the state's gross domestic 
product.[101] Poultry and swine are its second and third-largest agricultural 
industries.[127] Oklahoma is placed in the South by the United States Census 
Bureau,[11] but lies fully or partially in the Midwest, Southwest, and 
southern cultural regions by varying definitions, and partially in the 
Upland South and Great Plains by definitions of abstract geographical-cultural 
regions.[128] Oklahomans have a high rate of English, Scotch-Irish, German, 
and Native American ancestry,[129] with 25 different native languages spoken.[18] 
Because many Native Americans were forced to move to Oklahoma when White 
settlement in North America increased, Oklahoma has much linguistic diversity. 
Mary Linn, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of 
Oklahoma and the associate curator of Native American languages at the 
Sam Noble Museum, notes that Oklahoma also has high levels of language 
endangerment.[130] Six governments have claimed the area now known as Oklahoma 
at different times,[131] and 67 Native American tribes are represented 
in Oklahoma,[51] including 39 federally recognized tribes, who are headquartered 
and have tribal jurisdictional areas in the state.[132] Western ranchers, 
Native American tribes, southern settlers, and eastern oil barons have 
shaped the state's cultural predisposition, and its largest cities have 
been named among the most underrated cultural destinations in the United 
States.[133][134] Residents of Oklahoma are associated with traits of southern 
hospitality – the 2006 Catalogue for Philanthropy (with data from 2004) 
ranks Oklahomans 7th in the nation for overall generosity.[135] The state 
has also been associated with a negative cultural stereotype first popularized 
by John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath, which described the plight 
of uneducated, poverty-stricken Dust Bowl-era farmers deemed "Okies".[136][137] 
However, the term is often used in a positive manner by Oklahomans.[136] 
In the state's largest urban areas, pockets of jazz culture flourish,[139] 
and Native American, Mexican American, and Asian American communities produce 
music and art of their respective cultures.[140] The Oklahoma Mozart Festival 
in Bartlesville is one of the largest classical music festivals on the 
southern plains,[141] and Oklahoma City's Festival of the Arts has been 
named one of the top fine arts festivals in the nation.[139] The state 
has a rich history in ballet with five Native American ballerinas attaining 
worldwide fame. These were Yvonne Chouteau, sisters Marjorie and Maria 
Tallchief, Rosella Hightower and Moscelyne Larkin, known collectively as 
the Five Moons. The New York Times rates the Tulsa Ballet as one of the 
top ballet companies in the United States.[139] The Oklahoma City Ballet 
and University of Oklahoma's dance program were formed by ballerina Yvonne 
Chouteau and husband Miguel Terekhov. The University program was founded 
in 1962 and was the first fully accredited program of its kind in the United 
States.[142][143] In Sand Springs, an outdoor amphitheater called "Discoveryland!" 
is the official performance headquarters for the musical Oklahoma![144] 
Ridge Bond, native of McAlester, Oklahoma,[145] starred in the Broadway 
and International touring productions of Oklahoma!,[146][147][148][149] 
playing the role of "Curly McClain" in more than 2,600 performances.[146][150] 
In 1953 he was featured along with the Oklahoma! cast on a CBS Omnibus 
television broadcast.[150] Bond was instrumental in the title song becoming 
the Oklahoma state song[145][151] and is also featured on the U.S. postage 
stamp commemorating the musical's 50th anniversary.[146][152] Historically, 
the state has produced musical styles such as The Tulsa Sound and western 
swing, which was popularized at Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa. The building, 
known as the "Carnegie Hall of Western Swing",[153] served as the performance 
headquarters of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys during the 1930s.[154] 
Stillwater is known as the epicenter of Red Dirt music, the best-known 
proponent of which is the late Bob Childers. Prominent theatre companies 
in Oklahoma include, in the capital city, Oklahoma City Theatre Company, 
Carpenter Square Theatre, Oklahoma Shakespeare in the Park, and CityRep. 
CityRep is a professional company affording equity points to those performers 
and technical theatre professionals. In Tulsa, Oklahoma's oldest resident 
professional company is American Theatre Company, and Theatre Tulsa is 
the oldest community theatre company west of the Mississippi. Other companies 
in Tulsa include Heller Theatre and Tulsa Spotlight Theater. The cities 
of Norman, Lawton, and Stillwater, among others, also host well-reviewed 
community theatre companies. Oklahoma is in the nation's middle percentile 
in per capita spending on the arts, ranking 17th, and contains more than 
300 museums.[139] The Philbrook Museum of Tulsa is considered one of the 
top 50 fine art museums in the United States,[138] and the Sam Noble Oklahoma 
Museum of Natural History in Norman, one of the largest university-based 
art and history museums in the country, documents the natural history of 
the region.[139] The collections of Thomas Gilcrease are housed in the 
Gilcrease Museum of Tulsa, which also holds the world's largest, most comprehensive 
collection of art and artifacts of the American West.[155] The Egyptian 
art collection at the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art in Shawnee is considered 
to be the finest Egyptian collection between Chicago and Los Angeles.[156] 
The Oklahoma City Museum of Art contains the most comprehensive collection 
of glass sculptures by artist Dale Chihuly in the world,[157] and Oklahoma 
City's National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum documents the heritage 
of the American Western frontier.[139] With remnants of the Holocaust and 
artifacts relevant to Judaism, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art 
of Tulsa preserves the largest collection of Jewish art in the Southwest 
United States.[158] Oklahoma's centennial celebration was named the top 
event in the United States for 2007 by the American Bus Association,[159] 
and consisted of multiple celebrations saving with the 100th anniversary 
of statehood on November 16, 2007. Annual ethnic festivals and events take 
place throughout the state such as Native American powwows and ceremonial 
events, and include festivals (as examples) in Scottish, Irish, German, 
Italian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Czech, Jewish, Arab, Mexican and African-American 
communities depicting cultural heritage or traditions. During a 10-day 
run in Oklahoma City, the State Fair of Oklahoma attracts roughly one million 
people[160] along with the annual Festival of the Arts. Large national 
pow-wows, various Latin and Asian heritage festivals, and cultural festivals 
such as the Juneteenth celebrations are held in Oklahoma City each year. 
The Tulsa State Fair attracts over one million people during its 10-day 
run,[161] and the city's Mayfest festival entertained more than 375,000 
people in four days during 2007.[162] In 2006, Tulsa's Oktoberfest was 
named one of the top 10 in the world by USA Today and one of the top German 
food festivals in the nation by Bon Appetit magazine.[163] Norman plays 
host to the Norman Music Festival, a festival that highlights native Oklahoma 
bands and musicians. Norman is also host to the Medieval Fair of Norman, 
which has been held annually since 1976 and was Oklahoma's first medieval 
fair. The Fair was held first on the south oval of the University of Oklahoma 
campus and in the third year moved to the Duck Pond in Norman until the 
Fair became too big and moved to Reaves Park in 2003. The Medieval Fair 
of Norman is Oklahoma's "largest weekend event and the third-largest event 
in Oklahoma, and was selected by Events Media Network as one of the top 
100 events in the nation".[164] With an educational system made up of public 
school districts and independent private institutions, Oklahoma had 638,817 
students enrolled in 1,845 public primary, secondary, and vocational schools 
in 533 school districts as of 2008[update].[165] Oklahoma has the highest 
enrollment of Native American students in the nation with 126,078 students 
in the 2009–10 school year.[166] Ranked near the bottom of states in expenditures 
per student, Oklahoma spent $7,755 for each student in 2008, 47th in the 
nation,[165] though its growth of total education expenditures between 
1992 and 2002 ranked 22nd.[167] The state is among the best in pre-kindergarten 
education, and the National Institute for Early Education Research rated 
it first in the United States with regard to standards, quality, and access 
to pre-kindergarten education in 2004, calling it a model for early childhood 
schooling.[168] High school dropout rate decreased from 3.1 to 2.5 percent 
between 2007 and 2008 with Oklahoma ranked among 18 other states with 3 
percent or less dropout rate.[169] In 2004, the state ranked 36th in the 
nation for the relative number of adults with high school diplomas, though 
at 85.2 percent, it had the highest rate among southern states.[170][171] 
Oklahoma State University, the University of Oklahoma, the University of 
Central Oklahoma, and Northeastern State University are the largest public 
institutions of higher education in Oklahoma, operating through one primary 
campus and satellite campuses throughout the state. The two state universities, 
along with Oklahoma City University and the University of Tulsa, rank among 
the country's best in undergraduate business programs.[172] Oklahoma City 
University School of Law, University of Oklahoma College of Law, and University 
of Tulsa College of Law are the state's only ABA accredited institutions. 
Both University of Oklahoma and University of Tulsa are Tier 1 institutions, 
with the University of Oklahoma ranked 68th and the University of Tulsa 
ranked 86th in the nation.[173] Oklahoma holds eleven public regional universities,[174] 
including Northeastern State University, the second-oldest institution 
of higher education west of the Mississippi River,[175] also containing 
the only College of Optometry in Oklahoma[176] and the largest enrollment 
of Native American students in the nation by percentage and amount.[175][177] 
Langston University is Oklahoma's only historically black college. Six 
of the state's universities were placed in the Princeton Review's list 
of best 122 regional colleges in 2007,[178] and three made the list of 
top colleges for best value. The state has 55 post-secondary technical 
institutions operated by Oklahoma's CareerTech program for training in 
specific fields of industry or trade.[165] In the 2007–2008 school year, 
there were 181,973 undergraduate students, 20,014 graduate students, and 
4,395 first-professional degree students enrolled in Oklahoma colleges. 
Of these students, 18,892 received a bachelor's degree, 5,386 received 
a master's degree, and 462 received a first professional degree. This means 
the state of Oklahoma produces an average of 38,278 degree-holders per 
completions component (i.e. July 1, 2007 – June 30, 2008). National average 
is 68,322 total degrees awarded per completions component.[179] The Cherokee 
Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing 
new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through 
school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to 
continue to use the language at home.[180] This plan was part of an ambitious 
goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent 
in the language.[181] The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested 
$3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula 
for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where 
the language can be actively used.[181] There is a Cherokee language immersion 
school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through 
eighth grade.[182] Graduates are fluent speakers of the language. Several 
universities offer Cherokee as a second language, including the University 
of Oklahoma and Northeastern State University. Oklahoma has teams in basketball, 
football, arena football, baseball, soccer, hockey, and wrestling located 
in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Enid, Norman, and Lawton. The Oklahoma City Thunder 
of the National Basketball Association (NBA) is the state's only major 
league sports franchise. The state had a team in the Women's National Basketball 
Association, the Tulsa Shock, from 2010 through 2015, but the team relocated 
to Dallas–Fort Worth after that season[183] and became the Dallas Wings.[184] 
Oklahoma supports teams in several minor leagues, including Minor League 
Baseball at the AAA and AA levels (Oklahoma City Dodgers and Tulsa Drillers, 
respectively), hockey's ECHL with the Tulsa Oilers, and a number of indoor 
football leagues. In the last-named sport, the state's most notable team 
was the Tulsa Talons, which played in the Arena Football League until 2012, 
when the team was moved to San Antonio. The Oklahoma Defenders replaced 
the Talons as Tulsa's only professional arena football team, playing the 
CPIFL. The Oklahoma City Blue, of the NBA Development League, relocated 
to Oklahoma City from Tulsa in 2014, where they were formerly known as 
the Tulsa 66ers. Tulsa is the base for the Tulsa Revolution, which plays 
in the American Indoor Soccer League.[185] Enid and Lawton host professional 
basketball teams in the USBL and the CBA. The NBA's New Orleans Hornets 
became the first major league sports franchise based in Oklahoma when the 
team was forced to relocate to Oklahoma City's Ford Center, now known as 
Chesapeake Energy Arena, for two seasons following Hurricane Katrina in 
2005.[186] In July 2008, the Seattle SuperSonics, a franchise owned by 
the Professional Basketball Club LLC, a group of Oklahoma City businessmen 
led by Clay Bennett, relocated to Oklahoma City and announced that play 
would begin at the Ford Center as the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 season, 
becoming the state's first permanent major league franchise.[187] Collegiate 
athletics are a popular draw in the state. The state has four schools that 
compete at the highest level of college sports, NCAA Division I. The most 
prominent are the state's two members of the Big 12 Conference,[188] one 
of the so-called Power Five conferences of the top tier of college football, 
Division I FBS. The University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University 
average well over 50,000 fans attending their football games, and Oklahoma's 
football program ranked 12th in attendance among American colleges in 2010, 
with an average of 84,738 people attending its home games.[189] The two 
universities meet several times each year in rivalry matches known as the 
Bedlam Series, which are some of the greatest sporting draws to the state. 
Sports Illustrated magazine rates Oklahoma and Oklahoma State among the 
top colleges for athletics in the nation.[190][191] Two private institutions 
in Tulsa, the University of Tulsa and Oral Roberts University; are also 
Division I members. Tulsa competes in FBS football and other sports in 
the American Athletic Conference,[192] while Oral Roberts, which does not 
sponsor football,[193] is a member of The Summit League.[194] In addition, 
12 of the state's smaller colleges and universities compete in NCAA Division 
II as members of four different conferences,[195][196][197][198] and eight 
other Oklahoma institutions participate in the NAIA, mostly within the 
Sooner Athletic Conference.[199] Regular LPGA tournaments are held at Cedar 
Ridge Country Club in Tulsa, and major championships for the PGA or LPGA 
have been played at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oak Tree Country 
Club in Oklahoma City, and Cedar Ridge Country Club in Tulsa.[200] Rated 
one of the top golf courses in the nation, Southern Hills has hosted four 
PGA Championships, including one in 2007, and three U.S. Opens, the most 
recent in 2001.[201] Rodeos are popular throughout the state, and Guymon, 
in the state's panhandle, hosts one of the largest in the nation.[202] 
Oklahoma was the 21st-largest recipient of medical funding from the federal 
government in 2005, with health-related federal expenditures in the state 
totaling $75,801,364; immunizations, bioterrorism preparedness, and health 
education were the top three most funded medical items.[203] Instances 
of major diseases are near the national average in Oklahoma, and the state 
ranks at or slightly above the rest of the country in percentage of people 
with asthma, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension.[203] In 2000, Oklahoma 
ranked 45th in physicians per capita and slightly below the national average 
in nurses per capita, but was slightly over the national average in hospital 
beds per 100,000 people and above the national average in net growth of 
health services over a 12-year period.[204] One of the worst states for 
percentage of insured people, nearly 25 percent of Oklahomans between the 
age of 18 and 64 did not have health insurance in 2005, the fifth-highest 
rate in the nation.[205] Oklahomans are in the upper half of Americans 
in terms of obesity prevalence, and the state is the 5th most obese in 
the nation, with 30.3 percent of its population at or near obesity.[206] 
Oklahoma ranked last among the 50 states in a 2007 study by the Commonwealth 
Fund on health care performance.[207] The OU Medical Center, Oklahoma's 
largest collection of hospitals, is the only hospital in the state designated 
a Level I trauma center by the American College of Surgeons. OU Medical 
Center is located on the grounds of the Oklahoma Health Center in Oklahoma 
City, the state's largest concentration of medical research facilities.[208][209] 
The Cancer Treatment Centers of America at Southwestern Regional Medical 
Center in Tulsa is one of four such regional facilities nationwide, offering 
cancer treatment to the entire southwestern United States, and is one of 
the largest cancer treatment hospitals in the country.[210] The largest 
osteopathic teaching facility in the nation, Oklahoma State University 
Medical Center at Tulsa, also rates as one of the largest facilities in 
the field of neuroscience.[211][212] Oklahoma City and Tulsa are the 45th 
and 61st-largest media markets in the United States as ranked by Nielsen 
Media Research. The state's third-largest media market, Lawton-Wichita 
Falls, Texas, is ranked 149th nationally by the agency.[214] Broadcast 
television in Oklahoma began in 1949 when KFOR-TV (then WKY-TV) in Oklahoma 
City and KOTV-TV in Tulsa began broadcasting a few months apart.[215] Currently, 
all major American broadcast networks have affiliated television stations 
in the state.[216] The state has two primary newspapers. The Oklahoman, 
based in Oklahoma City, is the largest newspaper in the state and 54th-largest 
in the nation by circulation, with a weekday readership of 138,493 and 
a Sunday readership of 202,690. The Tulsa World, the second-most widely 
circulated newspaper in Oklahoma and 79th in the nation, holds a Sunday 
circulation of 132,969 and a weekday readership of 93,558.[213] Oklahoma's 
first newspaper was established in 1844, called the Cherokee Advocate, 
and was written in both Cherokee and English.[217] In 2006, there were 
more than 220 newspapers located in the state, including 177 with weekly 
publications and 48 with daily publications.[217] The state's first radio 
station, WKY in Oklahoma City, signed on in 1920, followed by KRFU in Bristow, 
which later on moved to Tulsa and became KVOO in 1927.[218] In 2006, there 
were more than 500 radio stations in Oklahoma broadcasting with various 
local or nationally owned networks. Five universities in Oklahoma operate 
non-commercial, public radio stations/networks.[219] Oklahoma has a few 
ethnic-oriented TV stations broadcasting in Spanish, Asian languages and 
sometimes have Native American programming. TBN, a Christian religious 
television network has a studio in Tulsa, and built their first entirely 
TBN-owned affiliate in Oklahoma City in 1980.[220] Transportation in Oklahoma 
is generated by an anchor system of Interstate Highways, intercity rail 
lines, airports, inland ports, and mass transit networks. Situated along 
an integral point in the United States Interstate network, Oklahoma contains 
three interstate highways and four auxiliary Interstate Highways. In Oklahoma 
City, Interstate 35 intersects with Interstate 44 and Interstate 40, forming 
one of the most important intersections along the United States highway 
system.[221] More than 12,000 miles (19,000 km) of roads make up the state's 
major highway skeleton, including state-operated highways, ten turnpikes 
or major toll roads,[221] and the longest drivable stretch of Route 66 
in the nation.[222] In 2008, Interstate 44 in Oklahoma City was Oklahoma's 
busiest highway, with a daily traffic volume of 123,300 cars.[223] In 2010, 
the state had the nation's third highest number of bridges classified as 
structurally deficient, with nearly 5,212 bridges in disrepair, including 
235 National Highway System Bridges.[224] Oklahoma's largest commercial 
airport is Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, averaging a yearly 
passenger count of more than 3.5 million (1.7 million boardings) in 2010.[225] 
Tulsa International Airport, the state's second-largest commercial airport, 
served more than 1.3 million boardings in 2010.[226] Between the two, six 
airlines operate in Oklahoma.[227][228] In terms of traffic, R. L. Jones 
Jr. (Riverside) Airport in Tulsa is the state's busiest airport, with 335,826 
takeoffs and landings in 2008.[229] In total, Oklahoma has over 150 public-use 
airports.[230] Oklahoma is connected to the nation's rail network via Amtrak's 
Heartland Flyer, its only regional passenger rail line. It currently stretches 
from Oklahoma City to Fort Worth, Texas, though lawmakers began seeking 
funding in early 2007 to connect the Heartland Flyer to Tulsa.[231] Two 
inland ports on rivers serve Oklahoma: the Port of Muskogee and the Tulsa 
Port of Catoosa. The only port handling international cargo in the state, 
the Tulsa Port of Catoosa is the most inland ocean-going port in the nation 
and ships over two million tons of cargo each year.[232][233] Both ports 
are located on the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, which 
connects barge traffic from Tulsa and Muskogee to the Mississippi River 
via the Verdigris and Arkansas rivers, contributing to one of the busiest 
waterways in the world.[233] Oklahoma is a constitutional republic with 
a government modeled after the Federal Government of the United States, 
with executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[234] The state has 
77 counties with jurisdiction over most local government functions within 
each respective domain,[24] five congressional districts, and a voting 
base with a plurality in the Democratic Party.[235] State officials are 
elected by plurality voting in the state of Oklahoma. Oklahoma is one of 
32 states with capital punishment as a legal sentence, and the state has 
had (between 1976 through mid-2011) the highest per capita execution rate 
in the US.[236] The Legislature of Oklahoma consists of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives. As the lawmaking branch of the state government, 
it is responsible for raising and distributing the money necessary to run 
the government. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while 
the House has 101 members with two-year terms. The state has a term limit 
for its legislature that restricts any one person to a total of twelve 
cumulative years service between both legislative branches.[237][238] Oklahoma's 
judicial branch consists of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the Oklahoma Court 
of Criminal Appeals, and 77 District Courts that each serves one county. 
The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of 
Impeachment and the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary. Oklahoma has two courts 
of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state 
Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases (this split system exists 
only in Oklahoma and neighboring Texas). Judges of those two courts, as 
well as the Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon the 
recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject 
to a non-partisan retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.[237] 
The executive branch consists of the Governor, their staff, and other elected 
officials. The principal head of government, the Governor is the chief 
executive of the Oklahoma executive branch, serving as the ex officio Commander-in-Chief 
of the Oklahoma National Guard when not called into Federal use and reserving 
the power to veto bills passed through the Legislature. The responsibilities 
of the Executive branch include submitting the budget, ensuring that state 
laws are enforced, and ensuring peace within the state is preserved.[239] 
The state is divided into 77 counties that govern locally, each headed 
by a three-member council of elected commissioners, a tax assessor, clerk, 
court clerk, treasurer, and sheriff.[240] While each municipality operates 
as a separate and independent local government with executive, legislative 
and judicial power, county governments maintain jurisdiction over both 
incorporated cities and non-incorporated areas within their boundaries, 
but have executive power but no legislative or judicial power. Both county 
and municipal governments collect taxes, employ a separate police force, 
hold elections, and operate emergency response services within their jurisdiction.[241][242] 
Other local government units include school districts, technology center 
districts, community college districts, rural fire departments, rural water 
districts, and other special use districts. Thirty-nine Native American 
tribal governments are based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within 
designated areas. While Indian reservations typical in most of the United 
States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted 
during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control 
over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal 
governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities 
with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and 
functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress 
to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required 
to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States 
Congress for approval.[243][244] Oklahoma has 11 substate districts including 
the two large Councils of Governments, INCOG in Tulsa (Indian Nations Council 
of Governments) and ACOG (Association of Central Oklahoma Governments).

Oklahoma has been politically conservative for much of its history, especially 
recently. During the first half century of statehood, it was considered 
a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in only 
two presidential elections (1920 and 1928). During this time, it was also 
carried by every winning Democratic candidate up to Harry Truman. However, 
Oklahoma Democrats were generally considered to be more conservative than 
Democrats in other states. After the 1948 election, the state turned firmly 
Republican. Although registered Republicans were a minority in the state 
until 2015,[246] starting in 1952, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican 
presidential candidates in all but one election (1964). This is not to 
say that every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter 
lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while Michael Dukakis and Bill 
Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 
respectively. Al Gore in 2000, though, was the last Democrat to even win 
any counties in the state. Oklahoma was the only state where Barack Obama 
failed to carry any of its counties in both 2008 and 2012. Generally, Republicans 
are strongest in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and their suburbs, as well as 
the Panhandle. Democrats are strongest in the eastern part of the state 
and Little Dixie, as well as the most heavily African American parts of 
Oklahoma City and Tulsa. With a population of 8.6% Native American in the 
state, it is also worth noting that most Native American precincts vote 
Democratic in margins exceeded only by African Americans.[247] Following 
the 2000 census, the Oklahoma delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives 
was reduced from six to five representatives, each serving one congressional 
district. For the 112th Congress (2011–2013), there were no changes in 
party strength, and the delegation included four Republicans and one Democrat. 
In the 112th Congress, Oklahoma's U.S. senators were Republicans Jim Inhofe 
and Tom Coburn, and its U.S. Representatives were John Sullivan (R-OK-1), 
Dan Boren (D-OK-2), Frank D. Lucas (R-OK-3), Tom Cole (R-OK-4), and James 
Lankford (R-OK-5). In 2012, Dan Boren (D-OK-2) retired from Congress, therefore 
making the seat vacant. This district, which covers most of Little Dixie, 
is the Democrats' best region of the state, and has been represented by 
a Democrat for a dozen years. Republican Markwayne Mullin won the election, 
making the state's congressional delegation entirely Republican. Oklahoma 
had 598 incorporated places in 2010, including four cities over 100,000 
in population and 43 over 10,000.[248] Two of the fifty-largest cities 
in the United States are located in Oklahoma, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, 
and 65 percent of Oklahomans live within their metropolitan areas, or spheres 
of economic and social influence defined by the United States Census Bureau 
as a metropolitan statistical area. Oklahoma City, the state's capital 
and largest city, had the largest metropolitan area in the state in 2010, 
with 1,252,987 people, and the metropolitan area of Tulsa had 937,478 residents.[249] 
Between 2000 and 2010, the cities that led the state in population growth 
were Blanchard (172.4%), Elgin (78.2%), Jenks (77.0%), Piedmont (56.7%), 
Bixby (56.6%), and Owasso (56.3%).[248] In descending order of population, 
Oklahoma's largest cities in 2010 were: Oklahoma City (579,999, +14.6%), 
Tulsa (391,906, −0.3%), Norman (110,925, +15.9%), Broken Arrow (98,850, 
+32.0%), Lawton (96,867, +4.4%), Edmond (81,405, +19.2%), Moore (55,081, 
+33.9%), Midwest City (54,371, +0.5%), Enid (49,379, +5.0%), and Stillwater 
(45,688, +17.0%). Of the state's ten largest cities, three are outside 
the metropolitan areas of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and only Lawton has 
a metropolitan statistical area of its own as designated by the United 
States Census Bureau, though the metropolitan statistical area of Fort 
Smith, Arkansas extends into the state.[88] Under Oklahoma law, municipalities 
are divided into two categories: cities, defined as having more than 1,000 
residents, and towns, with under 1,000 residents. Both have legislative, 
judicial, and public power within their boundaries, but cities can choose 
between a mayor-council, council-manager, or strong mayor form of government, 
while towns operate through an elected officer system.[241] State law codifies 
Oklahoma's state emblems and honorary positions;[251] the Oklahoma Senate 
or House of Representatives may adopt resolutions designating others for 
special events and to benefit organizations. Currently the State Senate 
is waiting to vote on a change to the state's motto. The House passed HCR 
1024, which will change the state motto from "Labor Omnia Vincit" to "Oklahoma-In 
God We Trust!" The author of the resolution stated that a constituent researched 
the Oklahoma Constitution and found no "official" vote regarding "Labor 
Omnia Vincit", therefore opening the door for an entirely new motto. State
