Christopher Edwin Duncan (born May 5, 1981) is a former Major League Baseball 
left fielder and first baseman. He is the youngest son of Dave Duncan, 
a former catcher and retired pitching coach for the St. Louis Cardinals. 
His older brother, Shelley, is also a first baseman and outfielder for 
the Cincinnati Reds. He is currently a co-host with Anthony Stalter on 
a mid-day radio program on the St. Louis ESPN Radio Affiliate, WXOS called 
The Turn. Duncan is a graduate of Canyon del Oro High School in the Tucson 
suburb of Oro Valley, Arizona. While there he was a teammate of Texas Rangers 
All-star second baseman Ian Kinsler.[1] He was drafted by the St. Louis 
Cardinals in the first round (46th overall) in the 1999 Major League Baseball 
draft as a supplemental Pick for loss of Free Agent Delino DeShields to 
the Baltimore Orioles. Duncan made his professional debut with the Johnson 
City Cardinals of the Appalachian League shortly after his signing. For 
the season, he batted only .214 with six home runs. After seven seasons 
in the Cardinals' farm system, including the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds, 
Duncan made his debut with the big club on September 10, 2005. On October 
2, 2005, he became the last player to hit a home run at Busch Memorial 
Stadium during the regular season. After spending most of the first half 
of the 2006 season working his way into the regular roster, Duncan hit 
very well and ended the season with impressive power numbers. In 2006, 
he was third in all of baseball behind David Ortiz and Ryan Howard in homers 
per at bat for players with at least 75 at bats. For the season, Duncan 
hit 22 home runs in only 280 at bats. In the 2006 World Series, Duncan 
appeared in three of the five games, going 1 for 8 with one run batted 
in. He committed an error in the fourth inning of Game 5 which was promptly 
followed by a two-run homer by Sean Casey, and misplayed a fly ball by 
Casey, which was ruled a double, in the sixth inning. However, Duncan and 
the Cardinals won the game and the Series, defeating the Detroit Tigers 
four games to one. Following the 2006 season, Duncan was named the team's 
Rookie of the Year.[2] Duncan became a regular starter in 2007, playing 
127 of the team's 162 games that season. He batted .259/.354/.480, hitting 
21 home runs (2nd on team) and 70 RBI (2nd on team), and third in doubles 
(20). He started 90 games in the outfield, committing two errors, which 
was an improvement from 2006, when he committed 6 errors while playing 
in both right and left field. He also finished second in total bases (180). 
He led the team in strikeouts with 123. On September 20, 2007, Duncan underwent 
surgery for a sports hernia. It was successful and he returned to the clubhouse 
on September 22. His brother, Shelley, also suffered a sports hernia; the 
brothers are very competitive and had been trying to outdo one another 
in their workouts.[citation needed] Mark McGwire has served as his hitting 
coach since 2007.[3] In 2008, after hitting .252 in 127 at bats, Duncan 
was sent down to his former team, the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. Joe Mather 
took his spot on the Major League roster. Duncan was recalled in June to 
fill the hole at first base, which was left open after Albert Pujols went 
on the disabled list for a period of 15 days. He would spend most of his 
time in the outfield after Pujols returned to the lineup. On July 22, Chris 
was placed on the disabled list after experiencing severe discomfort in 
his arm, hand, and neck. The club called the injury a "pinched nerve". 
On August 2, it was reported that Duncan would miss the rest of the 2008 
season after having surgery to address a herniated cervical disk in his 
neck. He ended the season with a .248 batting average, 6 home runs, and 
27 RBI over 222 at bats. Duncan successfully recovered from the surgery 
that ended his 2008 season, however, hit only .227, with five homers and 
32 RBIs in 260 at bats with the Cardinals, and began drawing the ire of 
Cardinals fans. On July 22, Duncan was optioned to the Cardinals' triple-A 
affiliate, the Memphis Redbirds. A day later, he was traded to the Boston 
Red Sox along with a player-to-be-named-later or cash for shortstop Julio 
Lugo (who had also fallen out of favor with his organization and its fans) 
and cash considerations.[4] The BoSox assigned Duncan to their triple-A 
affiliate, the Pawtucket Red Sox.[5] After batting only .188 with two home 
runs and ten RBIs at Pawtucket, Boston released Duncan on August 21, 2009. 
On January 19, 2010, Duncan signed a minor league contract with the Washington 
Nationals with an invite to spring training. Since October 2, 2011, Duncan 
has been a host for WXOS, the ESPN Radio affiliate in St. Louis. He originally 
began on the nightly program "Stully and Duncan." On January 4, 2012, Chris 
was replaced by former Fast Lane commentator Bob Ramsey, making the show 
"Stully and Rammer", while he moved to co-host "The Fast Lane" with Randy 
Karraker and former Rams defensive tackle and Super Bowl XXXIV champion 
D'Marco Farr. He is currently a co-host of "The Turn" with Anthony Stalter. 
He has developed an avid following with his humor and player insight. In 
October 2012, Duncan was diagnosed with a brain tumor. As of March 2013, 
he was undergoing chemotherapy.[6] Chris was married in 2011 to Amy Duncan.
