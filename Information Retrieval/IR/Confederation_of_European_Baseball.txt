The Confederation of European Baseball (French: Confédération Européenne 
de Baseball, CEB), is the governing body of baseball within Europe. The 
CEB was founded in 1953 with 5 members, which were Belgium, France, West 
Germany, Italy and Spain. As of today, there are 38 members, excluding 
Armenia. In 2010, there were 112,303 players in the CEB countries.[1] The 
confederation is responsible for operating the European Baseball Championship, 
a championship that has been running since 1954 in Europe. In April 1953 
in Paris (France), 5 countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) 
gave birth to the European Baseball Federation, originally named in French 
Féderation Européenne de Baseball (FEB). The first Executive Committee 
was formed by President Steno Borghese (Italy), Secretary General Roger 
Panaye (Belgium) and Vice President and head of the Technical Commission 
Luis Barrio (Spain). In 1954 the first European Championship was played 
in Belgium and Italy claimed the victory. The sixth member country, The 
Netherlands, was accepted at the 1956 Congress in Milan (Italy). In 1957 
in Amsterdam (The Netherlands), Sweden became the seventh member, and FEB 
became a 8 country federation in London (England) in 1960 when Great Britain 
was accepted. In 1963 FEB launched their first club competition. The first 
European champion of the club competition was Picadero Barcelona. In 1967 
the Federations of Italy and The Netherlands announced their withdrawal 
from FEB and founded a new Federation: Fédération Amateur Baseball. On 
April 1969 the 2 Federations re-entered FEB.. In 1971 another Italian, 
Bruno Beneck, succeeded Steno Borghese during the Congress held in Milan. 
The Republic of San Marino was accepted as the ninth member. In 1972 the 
organization changed its name to European Amateur Baseball Confederation 
or CEBA, according to the French Confederation Europeenne de Baseball Amateur. 
In 1974 the first Under-18 European Championship for players of age 18 
and under was played. The first title went to The Netherlands. The Dutch 
claimed also the first 16 and Under title in 1975. In 1979, during the 
Congress in Trieste (Italy), Denmark was accepted as the 10th member. There 
were already 15 member countries when, in 1985, during the Congress in 
Zandvoort (The Netherlands) Guus Van der Heiden (The Netherlands) succeeded 
Bruno Beneck as the President. When Van der Heiden died, Italian Federation 
President Aldo Notari was elected as the 4th president of the organization 
during the 1987 Congress in Barcelona (Spain). During the 1990s the number 
of member countries increased dramatically and they were 33 in 1994, when 
the Executive decided to drop the word "Amateur" from the name of the Confederation, 
known since then as CEB Confederation Europeenne du Baseball in French 
and Confederation of European Baseball in English. CEB also created (1990) 
the Cup Winners Cup and the CEB Cup (1993) and made the experiment of the 
Super Cup. Martin Miller of Germany, who had been in the Executive since 
1995, succeeded Aldo Notari (who was nominated Honorary President) in 2005, 
during the Congress in Prague (Czech Republic). Mr Miller was confirmed 
as President during the 2009 Congress in San Marino. During Miller's presidency 
the number of European Cups for Clubs was reduced to 2. Starting the 2009 
season only a European Cup for Clubs is played. Miller quit as President 
during the 2012 Congress in Rotterdam (The Netherlands). Petr Ditrich of 
the Czech Republic was the interim President until the 2013 Congress, that 
elected in Bled (Slovenia) Jan Esselman (The Netherlands) as the new President. 
CEB has currently 38 member countries. When the International Baseball 
Federation (IBAF) first released their world rankings, the Netherlands 
were the highest ranked team listed.[2] The only continental tournaments 
recognised at the time were the 2005 and 2007 European Baseball Championship, 
which were both won by the Netherlands. The IBAF released their updated 
rankings list in August 2009, in addition to the most recently contested 
tournaments being added and their expired counterparts being removed, the 
results of the 2005 European Baseball Championship were removed. This resulted 
in the removal of Greece from the rankings list. The Netherlands maintained
