Dennis Ward Galehouse (December 7, 1911 – October 14, 1998) born in Marshallville, 
Ohio was a pitcher for the Cleveland Indians (1934–38), Boston Red Sox 
(1939–40 and 1947–49) and St. Louis Browns (1941–44 and 1946–47). He helped 
the Browns win the 1944 American League Pennant. Galehouse led the American 
League in fewest bases on balls allowed per 9 innings pitched (2.482) in 
1947, and also came in 5th for shutouts in the American League (with 3), 
also in 1947.[1] In 15 years he had a 109–118 Win–Loss record, 375 Games, 
258 Games Started, 100 Complete Games, 17 Shutouts, 67 Games Finished, 
13 Saves, 2,004 Innings Pitched, 2,148 Hits Allowed, 999 Runs Allowed,

Strikeouts, 18 Hit Batsmen, 29 Wild Pitches, 8,688 Batters Faced, 3 Balks 
and a 3.97 ERA. Galehouse started a one-game, winner take all playoff for 
the Boston Red Sox against Cleveland in October 1948 to determine who would 
win the AL pennant. The Sox lost that game and Cleveland went on to win 
the World Series that year. Galehouse remained in baseball after his playing 
career as a scout for both the Red Sox and Indians, as well as the Detroit 
Tigers, St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Padres. He died in Doylestown,
