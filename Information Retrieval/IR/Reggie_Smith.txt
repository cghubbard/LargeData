Carl Reginald Smith (born April 2, 1945) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder and 
afterwards served as a coach and front office executive. He also played 
in the Nippon Professional Baseball league for two seasons at the end of 
his playing career. During a seventeen-year major league career (1966–1982), 
Smith appeared in 1,987 games, hit 314 home runs and batted .287. He was 
a switch-hitter who threw right-handed. In his prime, he had one of the 
strongest throwing arms of any outfielder in the big leagues. Smith played 
at least 70 games in 13 different seasons, and in every one of those 13 
seasons, his team had a winning record. Smith grew up in Los Angeles. He 
won the International League batting title in 1966 with a .320 average 
while playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was called up to the major 
leagues late in that season and played for the Boston Red Sox (1966–73), 
St. Louis Cardinals (1974–76), Los Angeles Dodgers (1976–81) and San Francisco 
Giants (1982). Smith appeared in four World Series, including during his 
rookie 1967 season for the Red Sox, and three (1977, 1978 and 1981) for 
the Dodgers. He hit three home runs in the 1977 series. In the 1978 season, 
Dodger pitcher Don Sutton went public with comments that Smith was a more 
valuable player to the Dodgers than the more-celebrated Steve Garvey. This 
led to an infamous clubhouse wrestling match between Sutton and Garvey. 
In the 1981 season as a member of the Dodgers, Smith was taunted by Giants 
fan Michael Dooley, who then threw a batting helmet at him. Smith then 
jumped into the stands at Candlestick Park and started punching him. He 
was ejected from the game, and Dooley was arrested.[1] Five months later, 
Smith joined the Giants as a free agent. He spent one season in San Francisco, 
then moved on to Japan with the Yomiuri Giants for two seasons before retiring 
in 1984. After his playing career ended, Smith rejoined the Dodgers, where 
he served as a coach under Tommy Lasorda, a minor league instructor and 
a player development official. Smith became involved with USA Baseball 
in 1999 as hitting coach on the 1999 Professional Team at the Pan American 
Games in Winnipeg, Canada (Silver, Olympic qualifiers). He also served 
as hitting coach for the 2007IBAF Baseball World Cup in Taiwan (Gold). 
Smith also served as hitting coach for Team USA during the 2006 World Baseball 
Classic, and served as hitting coach for the Bronze medal winning USA Baseball 
Olympic team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[2] Smith runs a baseball 
academy in Encino, California, where he trains youth players, including
