The Philadelphia Phillies 2013 season was the 131st season in the history 
of the franchise. The Phillies played their first game of the season against 
the Atlanta Braves on April 1. On April 5, the Kansas City Royals beat 
the Philadelphia Phillies 13–4, spoiling their home opener with a sellout 
crowd of 45,307 at Citizens Bank Park. The interleague matchup was a rare 
one between teams who first met in the 1980 World Series, as the Royals 
previously only visited Philadelphia in 2004. Hall of Famers Mike Schmidt 
and George Brett, rivals when the Phillies beat the Royals to win their 
first championship 33 years earlier, threw out the first pitches (along 
with SNL's Joe Piscopo).[1] On August 16, 2013, the Phillies fired manager 
Charlie Manuel replacing him with third base coach Ryne Sandberg on an 
interim basis.[2] At the time, the Phillies were 53–67, and Manuel had 
exactly 1,000 wins with the Phillies, a milestone he achieved on August 
12.[3] The league and fan base mostly expressed sadness and gratitude to 
Manuel for his tenure.[4] Several Phillies veterans, including Chase Utley 
and Cole Hamels, expressed regret and guilt feeling their lack of production 
led to Manuel's firing; they viewed Manuel as a fatherly figure.[5] Sandberg 
commented the next day, "It was a roller coaster of a day emotionally. 
It affected me and I think it affects the players."[6] Manuel received 
significant accolades within the media for his class in handling the situation,[2] 
while the Phillies organization, namely general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr., 
were criticized within the media for firing Manuel at that point in the 
season,[7][8] as well as for not having better players.[9][10][11] [12]
