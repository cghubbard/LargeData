The Los Angeles Dodgers Radio Network is a network of 26 radio stations 
that air Major League Baseball games of the Los Angeles Dodgers. As of 
June 2012[update], 20 stations broadcast games in English, while another 
six broadcast them in Spanish.[1] In 2013, Korean broadcasts were added, 
making it the only tri-lingual network in Major League Baseball.[2] English-language 
radio broadcasts are handled by Charley Steiner on play-by-play and Rick 
Monday on color commentary. Until his 2016 retirement, Vin Scully's television 
play-by-play for SportsNet LA (previously Prime Ticket) was simulcast during 
the first three innings of games that he called (primarily home games, 
and away games in California and Arizona). Steiner and Monday called the 
entire game on radio during games that were nationally-televised. For locally-televised 
road games that Scully did not call, Steiner handled the TV commentary 
with Orel Hershiser and Nomar Garciaparra on color commentary, while Monday 
called play-by-play on radio with Kevin Kennedy doing color. During the 
post-season, Scully called the first and last three innings solo, with 
Steiner and Monday calling the middle innings. Scully retired on October 
2, 2016; his commentary was simulcast on radio for the entire game.[3] 
California: Other: A separate network airs games in Spanish. Jaime Jarr√≠n

Pepe Yniguez and Fernando Valenzuela who are now on SportsNet LA's Spanish-language 
channel. California: Other: In 2013, the Dodgers announced that 60 games

games are broadcast on AM 1540, while all games are broadcast in Korean
