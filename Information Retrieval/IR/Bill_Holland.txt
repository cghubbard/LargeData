Bill Holland (December 18, 1907 â€“ May 19, 1984[1]) was an American race 
car driver from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who won the Indianapolis 500 
in 1949 and finished second in 1947, 1948 and 1950. He also was runner 
up in the 1947 AAA National Championship. He nearly won the 1947 Indianapolis

On November 14, 1951, Holland was suspended from AAA Indy Car racing for 
one year after competing in a three-lap Lion's Charity race at Opa-locka,
