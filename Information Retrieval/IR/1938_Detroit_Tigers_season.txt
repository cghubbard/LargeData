The 1938 Detroit Tigers season was a season in American baseball. The Detroit 
Tigers compiled a record of 84 wins and 70 losses, good enough for fourth 
place in the American League. Hank Greenberg hit 58 home runs, and became 
the first unanimous selection as the American League MVP. The highlight 
of the 1938 season was first baseman Hank Greenberg challenging the single-season 
home run record held by Babe Ruth (60). Hank went into the season's final 
weekend against the Cleveland Indians with 58 home runs, but failed to 
homer on Saturday or Sunday. He did tie Jimmie Foxx's record for a right-handed 
hitter, set in 1932.[2] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other
