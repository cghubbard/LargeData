Gordon Clark Richardson (born July 19, 1938) is an American former professional 
baseball player, a left-handed pitcher who played in the Major Leagues 
from 1964–66 for the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Mets. He stood 6 
feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg) as an active player. As 
a rookie in 1964, Richardson made a substantial contribution to the eventual 
National League and 1964 World Series champion Cardinals. After a stellar 
9–3 record and 1.55 earned run average for the Triple-A Jacksonville Suns, 
he was recalled by the Cardinals and made his MLB debut as a starting pitcher 
against the first-place Philadelphia Phillies on July 26 at Connie Mack 
Stadium. Richardson responded with a complete game, 6–1 victory in which 
he gave up only five hits and three bases on balls.[1] It was Richardson's 
only complete game in the Majors. He also recorded his first Major League 
save against the Phils on September 30 at St. Louis, preserving an 8–5 
win for Redbird lefthander Curt Simmons.[2] Richardson's efforts were crucial, 
as they enabled the Cardinals to overtake the Phillies to finish in first 
place in the NL by a single game. Richardson appeared in 19 games for the 
1964 Cardinals, 13 in relief, fashioning a 4–2 record and a 2.30 earned 
run average in 47 innings pitched. However, he was not effective in the 
1964 World Series, giving up three earned runs in two-thirds of an inning 
over two appearances. Traded to the Mets during the offseason,[3] Richardson 
appeared in parts of the 1965 and 1966 seasons for New York, largely as 
a relief pitcher. All told, Richardson gave up 105 hits and 37 bases on 
balls, with 86 strikeouts, in 118 MLB innings. He retired from baseball
