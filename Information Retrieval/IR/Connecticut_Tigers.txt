The Connecticut Tigers are a minor league baseball team located in Norwich, 
Connecticut. They are members of the New York–Penn League (NYPL). The Connecticut 
Tigers are a Short-Season A classification affiliate of the Detroit Tigers 
and play their home games at Senator Thomas J. Dodd Memorial Stadium. They 
were previously known as the Oneonta Tigers. The Tigers ensure affiliated 
baseball will stay in Norwich despite the relocation of the former Double-A 
Eastern League's Connecticut Defenders to Richmond, Virginia, where they 
are now called the Richmond Flying Squirrels. This franchise originated 
in Wellsville, New York as the Wellsville Yankees. From its inception in 
1942 until 1965, that team stayed in Wellsville under various names, such 
as the Wellsville Nitros, Rockets, Senators, Braves, and Red Sox. During 
its time as a farm club of the New York Yankees, Milwaukee Braves and Boston 
Red Sox, Wellsville hosted future Major Leaguers such as eventual Hall 
of Famer Phil Niekro, Jerry Coleman, Tony Conigliaro, Joe Foy, Jim Greengrass, 
Elrod Hendricks, Charlie Maxwell, Don Nottebart, Bill Robinson and George 
Scott. A separate Wellsville Nitros team has played in the New York Collegiate 
Baseball League since 1998 and at one point claimed the previous Nitros 
team as part of its history.[1] In 1966, the Red Sox moved from Wellsville 
to Oneonta, New York, under the ownership of Sam Nader becoming the Oneonta 
Red Sox. They became Oneonta Yankees, or O-Yanks, in 1967 when The NY Penn 
League became short season. an affiliation they would have for three decades. 
Stocked with future New York Yankees stars, the O-Yanks won NYPL titles 
in 1968, 1969, 1971, 1974, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1985, 1988 1990 and 
1998. Since 1991, the franchise has participated in the annual New York–Penn 
League Game in Cooperstown, New York. This is an official New York–Penn 
League game played at Doubleday Field in conjunction with the Hall of Fame's 
Induction Weekend festivities.[2] In 1999, the Yankees moved their affiliation 
to the Staten Island Yankees, so the Detroit Tigers organization moved 
in and changed the team's name to the Oneonta Tigers. On July 20, 2006, 
the Tigers won the longest game in NYPL history: a 6-hour and 40-minute, 
26-inning marathon against the Brooklyn Cyclones.[citation needed] Brooklyn 
scored the first run in the bottom of the first inning; the Tigers tied 
the game in the top of the fourth. Neither side scored again until the 
26th inning, when the Tigers plated five runs (three earned) off of Cyclones 
outfielder Mark Wright, who had entered the game to pitch (the Cyclones 
had already used six of their regular pitchers). The Tigers had three players 
who went 1-for-12, including center fielder Deik Scram, whose lone hit 
knocked in the go-ahead run for the Tigers in the 26th inning. The 2007 
season ushered a new era for Oneonta Tiger baseball, as their stadium received 
a face-lift, while premiering the team's official website, www.oneontatigers.com. 
Guillermo Moscoso pitched the second perfect game in NYPL history in a 
6–0 victory over the Batavia Muckdogs on July 15, 2007.[3] In early July 
2008, it was announced that long-time owner Sam Nader had sold the franchise 
he purchased in 1966. No discussion has been made for the prospect of the 
team moving out of Oneonta. The agreement allowed for the Tigers to stay 
in Oneonta up until the 2010 season.[citation needed] On July 4, 2009, 
the first two curtain calls in the history of Damaschke Field happened 
against the Aberdeen IronBirds, both for Rawley Bishop, a rookie first 
baseman from Middle Tennessee State and who was drafted in the 19th round 
by the Detroit Tigers in 2009.[citation needed] The first curtain call 
was in the 4th inning after a solo home run to make the score 1–0. The 
second curtain call happened in the 5th inning after a grand slam home 
run to make the score 5–0. On January 27, 2010, Oneonta Mayor Dick Miller 
announced in a press release saying that the Tigers would be leaving Oneonta 
for Norwich, Connecticut for the 2010 season. The Connecticut Tigers would 
play their games in the newly renovated Dodd Stadium which had been vacated 
by the Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League who had left for Richmond, 
Virginia. "Connecticut Tigers" was only expected to be used for the 2010 
season with a name-the-team contest expected to be held after the season 
to decide a permanent name. However, at the fan forum on April 17, 2010, 
general manager Andrew Weber stated the team is rethinking the contest 
due to the positive reactions of fans to the connection to the major league 
Detroit Tigers. On November 22, 2010, the team's Facebook page confirmed 
the name is to remain "Connecticut Tigers" permanently. In 2011, the Connecticut 
Tigers saw a 23% increase in total attendance and 20% increase in average 
attendance over 2010 numbers. The 20% increase in average attendance was 
the fourth largest increase in all of Minor League Baseball. Pitchers Catchers
