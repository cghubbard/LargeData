Shawon Donnell Dunston (born March 21, 1963 in Brooklyn, New York) is an 
American retired professional baseball player. A shortstop, Dunston played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1985 through 2002. Dunston was the 
first overall pick in the 1982 MLB draft by the Chicago Cubs, and played 
for the Cubs (1985–95, 1997), San Francisco Giants (1996, 1998, 2001–02), 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1997), Cleveland Indians (1998), St. Louis Cardinals 
(1999, 2000) and New York Mets (1999). Dunston was named an All-Star in 
1988 and 1990. Dunston was born in the East New York section of Brooklyn, 
New York, on March 21, 1963. As a youth, he lived in the Linden Apartments, 
a public housing facility, with his father, Jack, mother, Brenda, and younger 
sister, Kindra. Jack worked as a cab driver and delivered furniture, while 
Brenda worked in a women's clothing store.[1] Dunston attended the nearby 
Thomas Jefferson High School. He played for the school's baseball team 
as an infielder.[1] In his senior season at Thomas Jefferson, Dunston had 
a .790 batting average, 10 home runs, and stole 37 bases without a caught 
stealing in 26 games.[2][3] As a shortstop, Dunston was considered one 
of the best prospects available in the 1982 Major League Baseball draft.[4] 
The Chicago Cubs selected Dunston with the first overall selection of the 
draft out of Thomas Jefferson High School.[1] He was the first player from 
the New York area to be chosen with the first overall pick in the draft.[3] 
Opting to represent himself, Dunston signed a one-year contract with the 
Cubs for $100,000, and was assigned to the Cubs' Rookie-level minor league 
baseball affiliate in the Gulf Coast League.[2] Dunston competed with Larry 
Bowa for the role as the starting shortstop for the Cubs in spring training 
in 1985. Dunston initially won the job over Bowa.[5] He made his debut 
in the major leagues on April 9. However, Dunston struggled offensively 
and defensively, batting .194 and committing nine errors in 23 games. As 
a result, he was sent back to the minor leagues,[6] with Bowa regaining 
the starting role. After playing well for the Iowa Cubs, the Cubs recalled 
Dunston in August, and released Bowa.[5] In 1988 and 1990 he joined double-play 
partner Ryne Sandberg as an All-Star and was a key contributor to the Cubs' 
NL East division title in 1989, hitting .278 with 20 doubles, 6 triples, 
9 home runs, 60 runs batted in and 19 stolen bases. Due to become a free 
agent after the 1991 season, Dunston instead signed a four-year, $12 million 
contract to remain with the Cubs without testing the open market.[7] However, 
he injured his back that offseason, and required surgery to repair a herniated 
disk in May 1992.[8][9] The Cubs opted not to protect Dunston from being 
eligible to be selected in the 1992 Major League Baseball expansion draft,[10] 
but neither the Colorado Rockies nor the Florida Marlins selected him. 
After the 1995 season, he was granted free agency. The Cubs wanted to move 
Dunston to third base, but he preferred to remain at shortstop. As a result, 
he signed with the San Francisco Giants for the 1996 season, receiving 
a one-year contract worth $1.5 million.[11] He signed with the Cubs for 
the 1997 season, receiving $2 million.[12] On August 31, 1997, the Cubs 
traded Dunston to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who lost two shortstops, Kevin 
Elster and Kevin Polcovich, to injuries.[13] He hit two home runs in his 
first game with the Pirates,[14] and three in his first three games.[13] 
He became a free agent after the season, and signed a one-year contract 
with the Cleveland Indians for $400,000.[15] On July 23, 1998, the Indians 
traded Dunston, José Mesa, and Alvin Morman to the Giants for Jacob Cruz 
and Steve Reed. Dunston was batting .237 at the time of the trade.[16] 
With the Giants, Dunston batted .176 in 51 at-bats. Dunston became a free 
agent after the season and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on a one-year 
contract worth $500,000.[17] On July 31, 1999, the Cardinals traded Dunston 
to the New York Mets for Craig Paquette. He replaced rookie Melvin Mora 
on the Mets roster.[18] Dunston became a free agent after the season and 
signed with the Cardinals for the 2000 season. He signed with the Giants 
that next offseason, playing with them in 2001 and 2002. He reached the 
2002 World Series, his first, as a member of the Giants.[19] He hit a home 
run off Kevin Appier of the Anaheim Angels in game six, but the Angels 
won the game[20] and the series. Dunston was a career .269 hitter with 
150 home runs and 668 RBI in 1814 games. He seldom walked, so in spite 
of his batting average, his on-base percentage was the second-worst among 
players with at least 4500 plate appearances during their careers.[21] 
At the end of his career, he was used mainly as a fourth outfielder and 
a role player off the bench. He wore jersey #12 while with the Chicago 
Cubs. Bill James noted that Dunston was an "eternal rookie, a player who 
continued until the end of his career to make rookie mistakes."[22] Dunston 
was known, especially early in his career, for his unusually strong throwing 
arm at the shortstop position. He won the 1996 Willie Mac Award for his 
spirit and leadership. Dunston became eligible for the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 2008; 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 
5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received 0.2% of the vote, thus 
being dropped off the Baseball Writers' Association of America's ballot.[23] 
During his career, Dunston resided in Fremont, California.[8] Dunston currently 
works as a special assistant for the Giants.[24] Dunston has a son, Shawon, 
Jr. who played in 2014 for the Kane County Cougars, and the following year 
for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans (minor league affiliates of the Arizona Diamondbacks 
and Chicago Cubs, respectively).[20] As of June 2016, Shawon, Jr. is playing 
for the Augusta GreenJackets, Class A minor league affiliate of the San
