Terry Lee Landrum (born October 25, 1954) is a former professional baseball 
player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) primarily as an outfielder 
from 1980 to 1988. Landrum was born in Joplin, Missouri. He graduated from 
Highland High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Landrum hit the game-winning 
home run for the Baltimore Orioles in the final game of the 1983 American 
League Championship Series.[1] He was a very late addition to the Orioles 
post-season roster, and such an unlikely hero that teammate John Lowenstein 
joked that he was not sure of Landrum's first name.[1] Landrum also played 
well in the 1985 National League Championship Series and 1985 World Series 
for the St. Louis Cardinals, subbing for an injured Vince Coleman. He hit 
well over .300 in the postseason and had a home run in game four of the 
World Series.[2] In between, Landrum played winter ball with the Cardenales 
de Lara club of the Venezuelan League during three seasons spanning 1981â€“1983.[3] 
In addition, Landrum played for the West Palm Beach Tropics and the St. 
Petersburg Pelicans of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 
the 1989 and 1990 seasons, respectively.[4] After that, he played in the 
Mexican League with the Charros de Jalisco in 1991.[5] After baseball, 
Landrum attended New York University and earned a physical therapy degree. 
As of 1998, he became a physical therapist with a practice in New York
