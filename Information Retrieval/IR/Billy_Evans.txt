Died: January 23, 1956(1956-01-23) (aged 71) Miami, Florida William George 
Evans (February 10, 1884 – January 23, 1956), nicknamed "The Boy Umpire", 
was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the American 
League from 1906 to 1927. He became, at age 22, the youngest umpire in 
major league history, and later became the youngest to officiate in the 
World Series at age 25.[1] Upon his retirement at age 43, his 3,319 career 
games ranked fifth in major league history; his 1,757 games as a home plate 
umpire ranked third in AL history, and remain the eighth most by a major 
league umpire. He later became a key front office executive for three teams 
and president of the minor league Southern Association.[1] In addition 
to his inside role in the sport, Evans authored countless articles,[2] 
as well as two books, Umpiring from the Inside (1947) and Knotty Problems 
in Baseball (1950).[1] He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973, 
the third umpire ever selected.[3] Evans was born in Chicago.[2] When he 
was still a child, he relocated with his family to Youngstown, Ohio, where 
his Welsh-born father became superintendent at a Carnegie steel plant.[4] 
In Youngstown, the Evans family joined Westminster Presbyterian Church, 
where Billy Evans attended Sunday school.[5] As a youth, Evans was active 
in YMCA programs and participated in a neighborhood baseball club called 
the Youngstown Spiders, a team named in honor of the regionally popular 
Cleveland Spiders.[5] He gained notability as an athlete at Youngstown's 
Rayen School, excelling at baseball, football, and track.[1] In 1902, Evans 
enrolled at Cornell University, where he played on a freshman team managed 
by veteran major league shortstop Hughie Jennings.[5] After two years, 
his law studies and collegiate sports career came to an end, with the sudden 
death of his father.[6] Evans returned to Ohio and accepted a job as a 
sports reporter at the Youngstown Daily Vindicator.[3] The paper's city 
editor, Sam Wright, hired Evans on the basis of writing experience he secured 
as a staff member of his high school yearbook and college newspaper.[1] 
At the same time, Wright understood that Evans' varied experiences as an 
athlete provided him with an in-depth knowledge of sports.[1] In the early 
1900s, while covering a baseball game between the Youngstown Ohio Works 
club and a team from Homestead, Pennsylvania, Evans was approached by the 
manager of the local club, ex-major leaguer Marty Hogan, and asked to fill 
an umpire vacancy.[6] According to Evans's obituary, the aspiring reporter, 
who was on a date with a young woman, "wasn't interested until Hogan mentioned 
he would be paid $15 a week for officiating the game", a figure equivalent 
to a week's salary at his sportswriting job.[1] Evans' ability caught the 
attention of Charlie Morton, president of the Ohio–Pennsylvania League, 
and he was offered a full-time position as a league umpire.[1] Evans accepted 
the job, on the condition that he could retain his position as a sportswriter.[1] 
In 1906, he received a spectacular career boost from fellow Youngstowner 
Jimmy McAleer, an ex-major leaguer who was so impressed with the young 
man's ability that he recommended Evans to American League president Ban 
Johnson.[6] This gesture enabled Evans to move from a Class C Division 
minor league club to the major leagues.[1] At 22 years of age, Evans was 
the youngest umpire in major league history; furthermore, he was among 
those very rare umpires who broke into the major leagues with little previous 
professional experience.[3] He was regarded as the only umpire of his era 
who never had played professional baseball himself.[2] After making his 
debut at Highlanders' Park in New York City,[1] he went on to umpire for 
six World Series: 1909, 1912, 1915, 1917, 1919 and 1923. Working in an 
era during which most major league games used no more than two umpires 
(and sometimes only one), Evans single-handedly umpired seven double-headers 
in eight days during the 1907 season. He was the base umpire for Charlie 
Robertson's perfect game on April 30, 1922.[7] Unlike many umpires, Evans 
never made claims to infallibility. "I missed a lot of decisions", he once 
said. "At the time of making such a decision there was no doubt in my mind 
as to its correctness. However, a second or two later I felt that I erred 
and wished I could change my original ruling".[1] Evans' humility and impartiality 
did not always protect him from abusive fans. As sports writers Daniel 
Okrent and Steve Wulf observed, "roughness on the field seemed to elicit 
the same in the stands".[8] On September 15, 1907, in the midst of a doubleheader 
between the St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers, Evans suffered a skull 
fracture when a bottle hurled by an angry spectator knocked him unconscious.[9] 
The New York Times described the incident as "one of the most disgraceful 
scenes ever witnessed on a ball field".[9] Evans became known as an innovator 
during more than two decades with the American League. One obituary observed 
that he "introduced something new to officiating by running down to a base 
where a play was made so that he would be on top of it".[1] This approach 
became a standard practice among major league officials.[1] He was also 
aware of the increasing demands placed on umpires and strongly advocated 
formal training for baseball officials.[4] Furthermore, in a game that 
retained much of the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of earlier decades, Evans 
"substituted diplomacy for belligerency and proved an arbiter could control 
a game without threats of physical violence".[1] At the same time, he was 
unwilling to "back down" when physically threatened. In September 1921, 
Evans was involved in a bloody fistfight with Ty Cobb, who contested one 
of Evans' calls.[4] Baseball historian David Anderson noted that the trouble 
began when Cobb threatened to "whip" Evans "right at home plate", a move 
that would have led to Cobb's immediate suspension.[4] Evans supposedly 
invited Cobb to the umpire's dressing room for "post-game festivities", 
and before long, the two men were brawling beneath the stands as players 
from both teams looked on.[4] According to some accounts, many of Cobb's 
Detroit Tigers teammates "rooted" for Evans.[4] After the fight, Cobb was 
suspended for one game, while Evans attended the next several games wearing 
bandages.[4] Both men had agreed before the fight that they would not report 
it to league officials, but word of the incident eventually reached the 
league president, Ban Johnson.[10] According to sports writers Okrent and 
Wulf, Johnson responded to news of the incident "with uncharacteristic 
humor", saying "only that he was sorry that he missed it".[10] For the 
duration of his career as an umpire, Evans also remained active as a sportswriter. 
From 1918 to 1928, he served as sports editor of Newspaper Enterprise Association 
and produced a syndicated sports column titled, "Billy Evans Says".[1][11] 
His staff featured well-known sportswriters Jimmy Powers and Joe Williams.[1] 
Evans retired from umpiring following the 1927 season to become the general 
manager of the Cleveland Indians, earning a substantial annual salary of 
$30,000.[1] Baseball historian Bill James observed that Evans was the first 
front-office executive of a major league team to be officially called a 
"general manager".[12] In this capacity, Evans was credited with taking 
the Indians from a second division to a first division team.[1] He served 
as general manager for the next eight years, until budget cuts forced him 
out in 1935.[1] Rumors circulated that Evans's decision to leave the Indians 
was also motivated by a disagreement with the Indians' manager, Walter 
Johnson, over the suspension of third baseman Willie Kamm and the release 
of catcher Glenn Myatt.[1] Johnson allegedly accused Evans of "disloyalty", 
while Evans reportedly replied that he refused to be a "yes man".[1] Evans 
soon found work as chief scout and head of the Boston Red Sox farm system, 
but left on October 8, 1940 after the team sold Pee Wee Reese to the Brooklyn 
Dodgers over his objections.[3] Shifting sports, Evans returned to Cleveland 
to become general manager of the Cleveland Rams for the 1941 season. Although 
the team struggled on the field, it was a financial success, but after 
failing to come to terms on a new contract, Evans left and spent the next 
year writing before accepting the position of league president of the Southern 
Association on December 3, 1942.[3] During his four years leading the league, 
the Association thrived despite many other leagues shutting down due to 
World War II. In his first year, attendance increased by nearly 300,000,[citation 
needed] and while it dipped slightly in 1944, the threshold of one million 
people attending league games was again reached the following year.[13] 
On December 16, 1946, Evans accepted a contract offer from the Detroit 
Tigers to become their general manager.[3] One of his first moves was dramatic 
– selling aging superstar Hank Greenberg to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Over 
the next four years, the team had two runnerup finishes to the New York 
Yankees, but after dropping in the standings during the 1951 season, Evans 
announced his resignation on July 28 in favor of Tiger legend Charlie Gehringer.[3] 
Despite long absences from his residence in Cleveland, Evans was known 
as a devoted husband and father.[4] He married the former Hazel Baldwin 
in 1908; the couple had one child, Robert, who became the sports director 
of a radio station in Miami, Florida.[1] Evans maintained close ties with 
family members and died while visiting his son in Miami.[1] Despite his 
success, Evans remained accessible to friends from his early days in Youngstown. 
Shortly after Evans' death, a former high school classmate, E. Allan Lightner, 
recalled that his late friend "was still the fine clean character that 
he was in his high school days in Youngstown".[5] Lightner recalled that, 
shortly after his final conversation with the retired umpire, Evans sent 
Lightner an autographed photo of himself with former Detroit Tigers manager 
Red Rolfe.[5] By 1952, Evans had unofficially retired, then was injured 
in an automobile accident in Monroe, Michigan. After recovering, he remained 
in good health until January 21, 1956, when he suffered a massive stroke 
while visiting his son.[1] Evans died two days later at the age of 71.[2] 
Funeral services were held in Cleveland.[1] Evans' remains were interred 
at Knollwood Cemetery, in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.[4] Evans' contributions 
to baseball have been widely recognized. In 1973, he became the third umpire 
elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.[3] Evans is honored for the high 
standard of professionalism he set during his career as an official, and 
he is credited as a tireless advocate of formal training for umpires.[4] 
Ironically, as David Anderson observed, Evans might have been denied the 
opportunity to serve as an official in the major leagues "if the present 
day umpire school system existed during the Dead Ball Era".[4] Anderson 
noted that Evans' description of the basic qualities required of an effective 
umpire holds up even today: "Good eyes, plenty of courage – mental and 
physical – a thorough knowledge of the playing rules, more than average 
portions of fair play, common sense and diplomacy, an entire lack of vindictiveness,
