The Canadian Football League (CFL; French: Ligue canadienne de football, 
LCF) is a professional sports league in Canada. The CFL is the highest 
level of competition in Canadian football, a form of gridiron football 
closely related to American football. Its nine current teams, which are 
located in nine separate cities, are divided into two divisions: the East 
Division, with four teams, and the West Division with five teams. As of 
2015, the league features a 20-week regular season, which traditionally 
runs from late June to early November; each team plays 18 games with at 
least two bye weeks. Following the regular season, six teams compete in 
the league's three-week divisional playoffs, which culminate in the late-November 
Grey Cup championship, the country's largest annual sports and television 
event.[2] The CFL was officially founded on January 19, 1958,[3] making 
it the second oldest professional gridiron football league in North America 
still in operation. However, most of its teams long predate the modern 
formation of the league, and many of them have been playing each other 
since the 1920s. Rugby football began to be played in Canada in the 1860s, 
and many of the first Canadian football teams played under the auspices 
of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU), founded in 1884.[4] The CRFU 
was reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) in 1891, and served as 
an umbrella organization for several provincial and regional unions. The 
Grey Cup was donated by Governor General Earl Grey in 1909 to the team 
winning the Senior Amateur Football Championship of Canada. By that time, 
the sport as played in Canada had diverged markedly from its rugby origins, 
and started to become more similar to the American game. From the 1930s 
to the 1950s, the two senior leagues of the CRU, the eastern Interprovincial 
Rugby Football Union (IRFU or Big Four) and Western Interprovincial Football 
Union (WIFU) gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and 
amateur teams such as those in the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) 
were no longer competitive in their Cup challenges. The ORFU withdrew from 
Grey Cup competition after the 1954 season, heralding the start of the 
modern era of professional Canadian football, in which the Grey Cup has 
been exclusively contested by professional teams (Since 1965, Canada's 
top amateur teams, competing in Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS), have 
competed for the Vanier Cup). In 1956, the IRFU and WIFU formed a new umbrella 
organization, the Canadian Football Council (CFC). In 1958, the CFC left 
the CRU and became the Canadian Football League. As part of an agreement 
between the CRU and CFL, the CFL took possession of the Grey Cup, even 
though amateurs hadn't competed for it since 1954. The CRU remained the 
governing body for amateur play in Canada, eventually adopting the name 
Football Canada. Initially, the two unions remained autonomous, and there 
was no intersectional play between eastern (IRFU) and western (WIFU) teams 
except at the Grey Cup final. This situation was roughly analogous to how 
the American baseball leagues operated for years. The IRFU was renamed 
the Eastern Football Conference in 1960, while the WIFU was renamed the 
Western Football Conference in 1961. Also in 1961, limited intersectional 
play was introduced. It was not until 1981 that the two conferences agreed 
to a full merger, becoming the East and West Divisions of the CFL. With 
the merger came a full interlocking schedule of 16 games per season. The 
separate histories of the IRFU and the WIFU accounted for the fact that 
two teams had basically the same name: the IRFU's Ottawa Rough Riders were 
often called the "Eastern Riders", while the WIFU's Saskatchewan Roughriders 
were called the "Western Riders" or "Green Riders". Other team names had 
traditional origins. With rowing a national craze in the late 19th century, 
the Argonaut Rowing Club of Toronto formed a rugby team for its members' 
off-season participation. The football team name Toronto Argonauts still 
remains even though it and the rowing club have long since gone their separate 
ways. After World War II, the two teams in Hamilton—the Tigers and the 
Flying Wildcats—merged both their organizations into the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. 
The league remained stable with nine franchises—the BC Lions, Calgary Stampeders, 
Edmonton Eskimos, Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Hamilton 
Tiger-Cats, Toronto Argonauts, Ottawa Rough Riders and Montreal Alouettes—from 
its 1958 inception until 1981. After the 1981 season, the Alouettes folded 
and were replaced the same year by a new franchise named the Concordes. 
In 1986 the Concordes were renamed the Alouettes to attract more fan support, 
but the team folded the next year. The demise of the Alouettes forced the 
League to move its easternmost Western team, Winnipeg, into the East Division. 
In 1993, the league admitted its first United States-based franchise, the 
Sacramento Gold Miners. After modest success, the league then expanded 
further in the U.S. in 1994 with the Las Vegas Posse, Baltimore Stallions, 
and Shreveport Pirates. For the 1995 campaign, the American teams were 
split off into their own South Division, and two more teams, the Birmingham 
Barracudas and Memphis Mad Dogs, were added; at the same time, the Posse 
folded and the Gold Miners relocated to become the San Antonio Texans. 
In 1995 the Stallions became the only non-Canadian team to win the Grey 
Cup. Despite all American teams having the advantage of not being bound 
to the CFL's minimum Canadian player quotas, only the Stallions proved 
to be an on-field and off-field success. The establishment of the NFL's 
Baltimore Ravens, worsening financial problems among the league's core 
Canadian teams, and the inconsistent performance of the American teams 
prompted the CFL to abandon its American experiment and retrench its Canadian 
operations. The Stallions organization was used as the basis for a revival 
of the Montreal Alouettes. The CFL returned to an all-Canadian format in 
1996 with nine teams;[5] however, the Ottawa Rough Riders, in existence 
since 1876, folded after the 1996 season. Toronto and recently revived 
Montreal also were struggling; Montreal's woes were solved by moving to 
Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, a much smaller venue than the cavernous 
Olympic Stadium. In 1997, the NFL provided a $3-million USD interest-free 
loan to the financially struggling CFL. In return, the NFL was granted 
access to CFL players entering a defined two-month window in the option 
year of their contract. This was later written into the CFL's collective 
bargaining agreement with its players. The CFL's finances have since stabilized 
and they eventually repaid the loan. The CFL–NFL agreement expired in 2006. 
Both leagues have been attempting to reach a new agreement, but the CFL 
broke off negotiations in November 2007 after Canadian telecommunications 
firm Rogers Communications paid $78 million to host seven Bills games in 
Toronto over five seasons.[6][7] In 2002, the league expanded back to nine 
teams with the creation of the Ottawa Renegades. After four seasons of 
financial losses, the Renegades were suspended indefinitely before the 
2006 season; their players were absorbed by the remaining teams in a dispersal 
draft. In 2005, the league set an all-time attendance record with a total 
attendance of more than 2.3 million.[8] With the absence of Ottawa from 
2006 onwards, league attendance hovered around the 2 million mark. It stood 
at 2,029,875 in 2012 for a single game average of 28,193.[9] The 2007 season 
was a recent high point with average game attendance of 29,167, the best 
since 1983.[10] With Mark Cohon as commissioner of the league the CFL entered 
a period of stability and growth. New television deals, two new collective 
bargaining agreements, the 100th Grey Cup celebration, and widespread stadium 
renovation and rebuilding highlighted this era. The 100th anniversary of 
the Grey Cup had the highest ever television ratings for a championship 
game in English Canada.[11] The Montreal Alouettes accomplished this first, 
adding 5,000 seats to Percival Molson Memorial Stadium in time for the 
2010 CFL season.[12] The Edmonton Eskimos and Calgary Stampeders also renovated 
their respective stadia and facilities for the 2010 season.[13] In 2011, 
the BC Lions played under a new, retractable roof in BC Place after spending 
one and a half seasons at Empire Field.[14] In 2013, the Winnipeg Blue 
Bombers moved to an entirely new stadium at the University of Manitoba. 
In 2014 the Ottawa Redblacks kicked off their inaugural season (having 
been awarded a franchise in 2008[15]), becoming the third Ottawa franchise 
in CFL history. The new Ottawa franchise returned the league to 9 team 
structure, with 5 teams in West Division and 4 in the East. The Winnipeg 
Blue Bombers moved back to the West Division.[16] The 2014 expansion Ottawa 
Redblacks played a newly renovated Frank Clair Stadium, now branded as 
TD Place Stadium,[17] The Hamilton Tiger-Cats began using their new stadium, 
Tim Hortons Field, after spending 2013 at Guelph University and the first 
half of the 2014 season at McMaster University's football field following 
the demolition of the iconic Ivor Wynne Stadium .[18] During the 2000s 
the CFL had the third highest per-game attendance of any North American 
sports league and the seventh highest per-game attendance of any sports 
league worldwide. A 2006 survey conducted at the University of Lethbridge 
confirmed that the CFL was the second most popular sports league in Canada, 
with the following of 19% of the total adult Canadian population compared 
to 30% for the NHL. The NFL had 11% following, with a total of 26% following 
at least one of the pro football leagues. In other words, approximately 
80% of Canadian football fans follow the CFL, and about 55% follow the 
NFL.[19] In Mark Cohon's last year as commissioner he negotiated a new 
five-year collective bargaining agreement (from 2014 through the 2018 season) 
between the CFL and the CFLPA.[20] The Toronto Argonauts were sold by politician/businessman 
David Braley to Bell Media and MLSE chairman Larry Tanenbaum.[21] On May 
22, 2015, Michael Sam signed a two-year contract with Montreal Alouettes 
of the CFL.[22][23] The signing made him the first openly gay player in 
the league's history.[23] Sam left the team the day before the first preseason 
game, citing personal reasons.[24] As reported by Fox Sports, Sam returned 
to Montreal to continue his professional football career.[25] but again 
left on August 14, permanently, again citing personal reasons. Immediately 
following the 2015 season Jeffrey Orridge announced a re-branding for the 
CFL, including a new logo, motto, jerseys and website.[26] At the start 
of the 2016 season the Toronto Argonauts moved to BMO Field after more 
than twenty seasons at the Rogers Centre (formerly called the SkyDome from 
1989–2005).[27] After not having a drug enforcement policy in effect for 
the 2015 season the league and the CFLPA agreed to a new drug policy.[28] 
Construction on a new stadium for the Saskatchewan Roughriders has been 
in development for the past couple years[29] and is expected to be completed 
in time for the 2017 CFL season.[30] Note: team franchise history is listed 
as it is recognised by the CFL in its publication Facts, Figures and Records 
(2015).[38] Potential CFL expansion markets are the Maritimes, Quebec City, 
Saskatoon, London, and Windsor, all of which have been lobbying (unsuccessfully 
to date) for Canadian Football League franchises in recent years.[39][40][41] 
Since the 1980s, the CFL has occasionally played exhibition and, later, 
regular-season games at various cities in the Maritimes, including Canada 
Games Stadium in Saint John, New Brunswick; Huskies Stadium in Halifax, 
Nova Scotia; and Moncton Stadium in Moncton, New Brunswick. The league 
conditionally approved an expansion franchise, the Atlantic Schooners, 
for play in the 1984 season, but the team never made it to play. Atlantic 
Canada lacks a permanently suitable CFL stadium, which was the main problem 
that kept the Schooners off the field. As of 2010, the largest stadium 
in the Maritimes is Moncton Stadium, which has 10,000 permanent seats and 
can reach 20,000 capacity with temporary seats.[42] A pre-season game, 
dubbed Touchdown Atlantic, was held in Halifax in the 2005 CFL season and 
regular season games were played in Moncton under the same branding in 
2010, 2011, and 2013.[43] All 20,000 seats for the 2010 Moncton game sold 
out in 32 hours;[44] the 2013 game did not sell out. Former Commissioner 
Mark Cohon has stated that Moncton Stadium would require massive renovations, 
the cost of which would be comparable to that of constructing a whole new 
stadium, to host a CFL team permanently.[45] In November 2015 the Halifax 
city council voted 9-7 against purchasing land that would then be used 
to build a 20,000-seat stadium. It was agreed that the price tag for the 
land was too much, but the close 9-7 vote indicates municipal interest 
in building a near CFL sized stadium in Halifax.[46] Although Atlantic 
Canada's expansion bids have typically branded themselves as covering all 
of Atlantic Canada, the presence of football at any level in Newfoundland 
and Labrador is practically nonexistent and none of the efforts have attempted 
to include that province. There has also been interest in adding a team 
in Quebec City. In 2003, an exhibition game was held at PEPS Le Stade Extérieur 
between the Montreal Alouettes and Ottawa Renegades where Montreal won 
54–23.[47] In May 2009, Christina Saint Marche, a British businesswoman, 
announced her interest in operating a team in Quebec City—stating that 
there would be a natural rivalry with the Montreal Alouettes.[48] During 
the 2010 Grey Cup state of the league news conference, Cohon noted that 
the Alouettes hold the rights for the entire province of Quebec and that 
any expansion would have to be negotiated with them first.[49] Another 
exhibition game was held in the city on June 13, 2015, when the Montreal 
Alouettes beat the Ottawa Redblacks 26 to 9. Since Ottawa was unable to 
use their home stadium TD Place Stadium at Lansdowne Park due to the 2015 
FIFA Women's World Cup this game was listed as Ottawa's home pre-season 
game.[50] Saskatoon last hosted top-level Canadian football in 1935 when 
the Regina Roughriders left the Saskatchewan Rugby Football Union to form 
the WIFU. The Saskatoon Hilltops (along with another Saskatchewan-based 
team, the Moose Jaw Millers) eventually suspended operations due to World 
War II; the Hilltops would remain an amateur team when they returned in 
1947 (they have since played in the Canadian Junior Football League). Saskatoon 
last won a provincial title in 1921 and by the point of the Hilltops' closure, 
the Regina Roughriders had been the dominant team in the province for two 
decades. In early 2012, management at Credit Union Centre publicly expressed 
its desire to bring a CFL team to Saskatoon. However, the Regina-based 
Saskatchewan Roughriders have long branded themselves as a province-wide 
team, and claimed that Saskatchewan is too small to support two teams.[39] 
In any event, Saskatoon also lacks a suitable outdoor stadium. Its largest, 
Griffiths Stadium which plays host to the University of Saskatchewan's 
Saskatchewan Huskies, seats only 6,171 spectators. The Gordie Howe Bowl, 
which has hosted CFL exhibitions in the past, has even fewer seats. Since 
Ottawa's return to the league in 2014, the CFL season has included: Team 
training camps open 28 days prior to the first regular season game of the 
season, a camp solely devoted to first year players is allowed the 3 days 
before the main camp opens. The pre-season exhibition schedule is two weeks 
long with each team playing two games against teams from its own division. 
The regular season is 20 weeks long, with games beginning the weekend before 
Canada Day weekend and finishing by early November. The CFL's nine current 
teams are divided into two divisions: the East Division with four teams 
and the West Division, with five teams. Each team plays three games against 
two teams in its own division, and two games against the other six teams 
on a rotating basis. With 81 regular season games being played, each team 
gets two bye weeks except for one team that plays two games in one week 
and receives three bye weeks. The most popular featured week in the CFL 
season is the Labour Day Classic, played over the course of the Labour 
Day weekend, where the matchups feature the first half of home-and-home 
series between the traditional geographic rivalries of Toronto–Hamilton 
(a rivalry which began in 1873[4]), Edmonton–Calgary (see Battle of Alberta), 
and Winnipeg–Saskatchewan. With the return of Ottawa, it is expected that 
they will resume playing Montreal to round out the week's games. In years 
that Ottawa or Montreal were not in the league, BC would play against one 
of these teams.[51] The following week's rematch of these games is a popular 
event as well, especially in recent years, where the rematch of the Saskatchewan–Winnipeg 
game has been dubbed the Banjo Bowl. Other features of the regular season 
schedule are the Hall of Fame Game and the Thanksgiving Day Classic, the 
doubleheader held on Thanksgiving where the match ups usually do not feature 
traditional rivalries. Starting in 2010, a neutral site regular season 
game was played in Moncton under the name Touchdown Atlantic, which has 
been played in three of the last four seasons. The league awards points 
based on regular season results (two for a win, one for a tie and none 
for a loss). As of the 2011 season, in the event two or more teams in a 
division finish the season with the same number of points, the tie is broken 
based on the following criteria (in descending order):[52] The playoffs 
begin in November. After the regular season, the top team from each division 
has an automatic home berth in the division final, and a bye week during 
the division semifinal. The second-place team from each division hosts 
the third-place team in the division semifinal, unless a fourth-place team 
from one division finishes with a better record than a third place team 
in the other (this provision is known as the crossover rule, and while 
it implies that it is possible for two teams in the same division to play 
for the Grey Cup, only two crossover teams have won a semifinal since the 
rule's 1996 inception, and neither advanced to the Grey Cup). The winners 
of each division's semifinal game then travel to play the first place teams 
in the division finals. Since 2005, the division semifinals and division 
finals have been sponsored by Scotiabank.[53] The two division champions 
then face each other in the Grey Cup game, which, since 2007, has been 
held on the fourth or fifth Sunday of November. The Grey Cup is both the 
name of the championship of the CFL and the name of the trophy awarded 
to the victorious team. The Grey Cup is the second-oldest trophy in North 
American professional sports, after the Stanley Cup. The Grey Cup game 
is hosted in one of the league's member cities. In recent years, it has 
been hosted in a different city every year, selected two or more years 
in advance. The Toronto Argonauts have won the most Grey Cups with sixteen 
wins total, most recently in 2012. In 2012, the game was held in Toronto 
at the Rogers Centre, and for the second year in row the cup was won on 
a team's home field, Toronto beating Calgary 35–22.[54] In 2013, the Grey 
Cup was won at home for the third consecutive time (by the Saskatchewan 
Roughriders), which had not been done since Toronto won at home from 1945–1947. 
In 2014, the Grey Cup was won at BC Place by the Calgary Stampeders beating 
the Hamilton Tiger-cats 20-16. As the country's single largest annual sporting 
event,[2] the Grey Cup has long served as an unofficial Canadian autumn 
festival generating national media coverage and a large amount of revenue 
for the host city. Many fans travel from across the country to attend the 
game and the week of festivities that lead up to it. A 2014 survey found 
that 48% of Canadians would prefer to watch the Grey Cup over the Super 
Bowl if they could only watch one or the other, with 52% preferring the 
Super Bowl.[55] Beginning 2015, the Grey Cup game will be presented by 
Shaw Communications.[56] Following the Grey Cup game, the Grey Cup Most 
Valuable Player and Grey Cup Most Valuable Canadian are selected. A number 
of league individual player awards, such as the Most Outstanding Player 
and Most Outstanding Defensive Player, are awarded annually at a special 
ceremony in the host city during the week before the Grey Cup game; this 
ceremony is broadcast nationally on TSN. The Annis Stukus Trophy, also 
known as the Coach of the Year Award, is awarded separately at a banquet 
held during the off-season each February. While the CFL has not held an 
all-star game since 1988, an All-Star Team is selected and honoured at 
the league awards ceremony during Grey Cup week. The CFL Championship game, 
the Grey Cup, held the record for the largest television audience in Canadian 
history. Television coverage on CBC, CTV and Radio-Canada of the 1983 Grey 
Cup attracted a viewing audience of 8,118,000 people as Toronto edged B.C. 
18–17, ending a 31-year championship drought for the Argonauts. At the 
time, this represented 33% of the Canadian population. This has since been 
surpassed by the 2002 and 2010 Men's Olympic Gold Medal Hockey Game. Currently, 
the official television broadcasters of CFL games are cable network TSN 
(which began televising CFL games in 1985), while TSN's French-language 
network RDS broadcasts Montreal Alouettes games for the Quebec television 
market.[57] Games are typically scheduled for Thursday to Saturday evenings 
during June, July and August, but switch to more Saturday and Sunday afternoon 
games during September and October.[58] TSN has created a tradition of 
at least one Friday night game each week, branded as Friday Night Football. 
CBC and TSN drew record television audiences for CFL broadcasts in 2005.[59] 
The 2006 season was the first season in which every regular-season game 
was televised, as the league implemented an instant replay challenge system.[60] 
In 2006, the CFL also began offering pay-per-view webcasts of every game 
on CFL Broadband.[61] Until the end of the 2007 season, CBC and RDS were 
the exclusive television broadcasters for all playoff games, including 
the Grey Cup, which regularly draws a Canadian viewing audience in excess 
of 4 million.[62] Since 2008, TSN and RDS are the exclusive television 
and Internet broadcasters of all CFL games, including the playoffs and 
Grey Cup. The five-year agreement, which includes an option for a sixth 
year, is worth about $16 million annually and marks the first time since 
1952 that CBC will not be broadcasting any CFL games. The CFL will no longer 
be broadcast on Canadian terrestrial television, unless TSN chooses to 
air the game on its terrestrial partners, CTV or CTV Two (formerly A-Channel); 
as of 2011, TSN has not transferred any CFL games to broadcast TV. The 
move to TSN all but assures that all CFL games will be broadcast in high 
definition.[2] As of 2006[update], TSN was available in about 8.8 million 
of Canada's 13 million households.[2] The two play-by-play announcers are 
Chris Cuthbert and Rod Black while the colour commentators are Glen Suitor 
(with Cuthbert) and Duane Forde (with Black). Instead of merely exercising 
the option on the contract, TSN opted to renew the contract with the CFL 
(and thus extend the terrestrial blackout) through 2018 in an agreement 
announced in March 2013. On June 26, 2013, it was announced that the CFL's 
U.S. broadcast rights would return to the ESPN Networks for the 2013 season, 
with 5 games airing on ESPN2, and 55 airing on ESPN3.[63] This agreement 
was renewed in 2014 for five years, the same length as the TSN deal (ESPN 
holds a stake in TSN), with a stipulation that at least 17 games would 
be carried on ESPN2 (or another ESPN network, such as ESPN or ESPNEWS) 
each season, including the Grey Cup; this gives ESPN exclusive CFL rights 
during this time frame. As in previous years, ESPN3 will carry all games 
not carried on one of the linear channels online.[64][65][66] On June 19, 
2015, it was announced that ESPN Brasil will broadcast CFL games live, 
beginning on June 25, as a result of the growth of the NFL and College 
Football fan base in Brazil.[67] CBC Television, which held a monopoly 
on Canadian television until 1961, held Canadian professional football 
broadcast rights beginning the year of its debut, 1952. CTV was born in 
1961 part because Toronto businessman John Bassett had won the television 
rights to the Eastern Conference, and needed a network to air the games. 
From 1962 through 1986, CBC and CTV shared CFL broadcasting rights. They 
split playoff games and simulcast the Grey Cup. In 1962, 1965, 1967, 1968 
and 1970, CTV commentators were used for the dual network telecast, while 
in 1963, 1964, 1966 and 1969, CBC announcers were provided. From 1971 through 
1986, one network's crew called the first half while the other called the 
rest of the game. After the 1986 season, CTV dropped coverage of the CFL 
and the Grey Cup. From 1987 through 1990, the CFL operated its own syndicated 
network, CFN. Like CTV, CFN split playoff games with CBC. However, CFN 
had completely separate coverage of the Grey Cup, utilizing its own production 
and commentators. From 1991 to 2007, all post-season games had been exclusively 
on CBC; beginning in 2008, the Grey Cup was carried on TSN, although the 
cable provider reserves the right to move the game to sister network CTV 
(as of 2015, it has never done so, opting to broadcast that Sunday's NFL 
games on CTV instead.) The predecessor to the CFL's East Division, the 
IRFU, had a television contract with NBC in 1954 that provided far more 
coverage than the NFL's existing contract with DuMont. NBC aired games 
on Saturday afternoons, competing against college football broadcasts on 
CBS and ABC. The revenue from the contract allowed the IRFU to directly 
compete against the NFL for players in the late 1950s, setting up a series 
of CFL games in the United States beginning in 1958 and a series of interleague 
exhibitions beginning in 1959. Interest in the CFL in the United States 
faded dramatically after the debut of the American Football League in 1960.[68] 
In 1982, during a players' strike in the NFL, NBC broadcast CFL games in 
the United States in lieu of the NFL games which were cancelled; the first 
week of broadcasts featured the NFL on NBC broadcast teams, before a series 
of blowout games on the network and the resulting low ratings resulted 
in NBC cutting back and eventually cancelling its CFL coverage. ESPN host 
Chris Berman became a fan of the game in the early days of ESPN, when the 
network used to air CFL games, and continues to cover the Canadian league 
on-air.[69] FNN-SCORE (unrelated to the Canadian The Score) carried games 
in the late 1980s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, SportsChannel America 
carried games, using CBC Television, CFN and TSN feeds. In 1993, several 
SportsChannel Pacific-produced games that were part of the Sacramento Gold 
Miners' local package were also shown nationally. Beginning in 1994, with 
now four US-based teams in the league, ESPN reached a four-year deal with 
the league to produce and air two games per week and all post-season games 
on its fledgling ESPN2. They also put some games on the main network to 
fill broadcast time vacated by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. 
The 1994 and 1995 Grey Cups were shown live on ESPN2 and then re-aired 
on ESPN the following day, leading into the network's Monday Night Countdown 
show. ESPN's on-air talent included a mix of the network's American football 
broadcasters and established CFL broadcasters from Canada. Most of the 
US-based teams also had deals with local carriers to show games that were 
not covered in the national package. Though there were no US teams in the 
league after 1995, ESPN2 continued showing games until 1997, albeit on 
a much lighter schedule. America One held CFL broadcast rights in the United 
States from 2001 to 2009 and aired a majority of the league's games.[70] 
Until the 2007 season, America One syndicated CFL games to regional sports 
networks like Altitude, NESN, and MASN; these were discontinued in 2008, 
mainly because America One and the CFL were able to reach a deal only days 
before the season began, not allowing the network time to establish agreements 
with individual RSNs. The Grey Cup aired on Versus on November 22, 2008, 
with a replay the next day on America One. From 2006 through the 2008 season, 
Friday Night Football was carried exclusively on World Sport HD in the 
United States; however, due to the January 2009 shutdown of that channel's 
parent company, Voom HD Networks, America One reclaimed those rights. NFL 
Network took over the league broadcast contract in 2010. For the 2010 season, 
the network carried 14 games, no more than one each week.[71] For 2011, 
the network increased its output to two games each week.[72] NFL Network 
declined to continue its coverage after the 2011 season.[73] In late July 
2012, NBC Sports Network acquired rights to the CFL for the remainder of 
the 2012 season. The NBCSN deal included nine regular season games starting 
August 27 (including Labour Day Classic games) and all the playoffs.[74] 
NBC Sports renewed their agreement with the CFL for the 2013 season.[75] 
ESPN America carried a collection of CFL games as part of its lineup until 
the network shut down in 2013. On the Internet, all radio broadcasts of 
CFL games are available for free through each affiliate's Web site. As 
of 2010, ESPN3 is the only place where CFL games are broadcast on Internet 
television. ESPN3 (and its predecessor, ESPN360) have broadcast games since 
2008; the service is only available in the United States (or its military 
bases) through specially negotiated cable providers and not in Canada. 
Video broadcasts were free in Canada at one time, but are no longer available; 
viewers are able to purchase previous games on the TSN website. A service 
known as "CFL Broadband" offered pay-per-view of CFL games in the United 
States and elsewhere prior to 2009, but the service ceased operations prior 
to the 2010 season. During America One's time broadcasting CFL games, some 
CFL video feeds could be found for free due to the fact that a small number 
of America One affiliates streamed their video on the Internet, even though 
the CFL discouraged this. In Canada, Bell Mobility provides streaming of 
CFL games to its mobile devices, and TSN's streaming service, TSN GO, provides 
Internet streaming of CFL games to Bell TV and Rogers Cable subscribers. 
CFL teams have local broadcast contracts with terrestrial radio stations 
for regular season and playoff games, while TSN Radio owns the rights to 
the Grey Cup.[76] In 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio gained exclusive rights 
for North American CFL satellite radio broadcasts and broadcast 25 CFL 
games per season, including the Grey Cup, through 2008.[77] The CFL began 
enforcing a salary cap for the 2007 season of $4.05 million per team. The 
cap was raised to $4.2 million in the 2008 season and remained at that 
level for 2009.[78] On June 29, 2010, a new collective bargaining agreement 
was ratified that raised the salary cap to $4.25 million for the 2010 CFL 
season and would continue to increase by $50,000 each season until 2013.[79] 
In 2014, a new CBA was ratified and the salary cap was raised to $5 million 
per team, with that amount increasing again by $50,000 each year until 
2018.[80] Financial penalties for teams that breach the cap are set at 
$1 to $1 for the first $100,000 over, $2 to $1 for $100,000 to $300,000 
over, and $3 to $1 for $300,000 and above. Penalties could also include 
forfeited draft picks.[81] For 2010, the minimum team salary was set at 
$3.9 million while the minimum player salary was set at $42,000.[79] With 
the new CBA in 2014, the salary floor was raised to $4.4 million per team 
with increases of $50,000 per year, and the minimum salary was raised to 
$50,000 per year.[80] The average salary per player in 2014 was $96,000 
CAD.[82] In 2006, the active roster limit was increased from 40 to 42 and 
in 2014 it was again increased to 44.[80] Each team must abide by the national/international 
ratio rule, which requires teams to keep at least 21 national players, 
("a Canadian citizen at the time of signing his first contract, was classified 
as a non-import prior to May 31, 2014, or was physically resident in Canada 
for an aggregate period of five years prior to reaching the age of 18.")[83] 
with the other 23 players allowed to originate from any country; quarterbacks, 
of which a team can carry three on a roster, cannot be counted toward the 
national player requirement, which puts Canadian quarterbacks at a disadvantage 
compared to other positions in being hired by a CFL franchise.[84] Teams 
may have up to two players on their reserve roster, and up to 10 on their 
practice roster.[81] CFL players are represented by the Canadian Football 
League Players' Association (CFLPA). Each team elects two players to the 
CFLPA Board of Player Representatives, which meets once per year. Every 
two years, it elects an executive Board of Directors.[85] Eligible non-imports 
(usually from CIS football or American college football) are drafted by 
teams in the annual Canadian College Draft. The CFL Draft usually takes 
place in May and consists of seven rounds. The first two rounds of the 
draft are usually shown live on TSN. The CFL Combine (formerly known as 
the Evaluation Camp), similar to the NFL Combine,[86] precedes the draft. 
A junior player in the locale of a team may be claimed as a territorial 
exemption and sign with that team before beginning collegiate play (one 
recent example is when the BC Lions claimed Andrew Harris[87]). Teams maintain
