This is a list of museums in the United States whose primary focus is on 
African American culture and history. Such museums are commonly known as 
African American museums. According to scholar Raymond Doswell, an African-American 
museum is "an institution established for the preservation of African-derived 
culture."[1] Such museums have a mission of "collecting and preserving 
material on history and cultural heritage of African Americans." African-American 
museums share these goals with archives, genealogy groups, historical societies, 
and research libraries.[2] But museums differ as they have as a basic educational 
or aesthetic purpose in the collection and display of objects, and regular 
exhibitions for the public.[3] Being open to the public (not just researchers 
or by appointment) and having regular hours sets museums apart from historical 
sites or other facilities that may call themselves museums.[4] The first 
African-American museum was the College Museum in Hampton, Virginia, established 
in 1868.[2] Prior to 1950, there were about 30 museums devoted primarily 
to African-American culture and history in the United States. These were 
located primarily at historically black colleges and universities or at 
libraries that had significant African-American culture and history collections.[5] 
Important collections were developed at Bennett College in Greensboro, 
North Carolina; Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee; Howard University 
in Washington, D.C.; Lincoln University in Chester County, Pennsylvania; 
Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland; Talladega College in Talladega, 
Alabama; and Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama.[6] Additionally, 
local historical societies, history clubs, and reading groups in African-American 
communities also collected and displayed African-American cultural artifacts.[7] 
The first independent, nonprofit museums in the United States were the 
African American Museum in Cleveland, Ohio (founded in 1956), the DuSable 
Museum of African American History in Chicago, Illinois (founded in 1960), 
and the International Afro American Museum in Detroit, Michigan (founded 
in 1965; now known as the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American 
History). Throughout the 1960s, the energy of the American Civil Rights 
Movement led to numerous local African-American museums being founded.[8] 
Between 1868 and 1991, there were about 150 African-American museums established 
in 37 states.[2] As of 2010, the largest African-American museum in the 
United States was the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History 
in Detroit, Michigan. It will be exceeded in size by the Smithsonian Institution's 
National Museum of African American History and Culture when completed
