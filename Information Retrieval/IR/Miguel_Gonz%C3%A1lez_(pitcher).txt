Miguel Ángel González Martín (born May 27, 1984) is a Mexican professional 
baseball pitcher for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played in MLB for the Baltimore Orioles from 2012 to 2015. 
González was originally signed by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim as 
an amateur free agent in 2005. The following two years, he earned a number 
of honors[which?] with the Arkansas Travelers (Texas League/Double-A).[citation 
needed] He was selected by Boston in the 2008 Rule 5 draft. Out during 
the regular season while recovering from a knee injury, he made a comeback 
with the Venados de Mazatlán of the Mexican Pacific League. In 2009, González 
underwent Tommy John surgery and missed the entire season. He was outrighted 
to Pawtucket in November 2009. After two seasons in the Red Sox minor league 
system, González signed a minor league deal with the Orioles in March 2012. 
He would start at Triple-A. He said that he signed to play with fellow 
Mexican players Dennys Reyes, Luis Ayala and Óscar Villarreal, as well 
as the fact that the Orioles gave him the opportunity to improve his skills.[1] 
Gonzalez made his first major league start on July 6, 2012 against the 
Los Angeles Angels and earned the win, limiting the Angels to one run and 
three hits over seven innings. The Orioles won the game 3–2. In the game, 
Gonzalez honored his former teammate, Nick Adenhart who died in 2009, by 
wearing a glove given to him by Adenhart when they were teammates in 2007 
with the Arkansas Travelers.[2] For the 2012 regular season he went 9–4 
with a 3.25 ERA in 14 starts.[3] Gonzalez also started Game 3 of the 2012 
American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, departing 
the game with a 2-1 lead but no-decisioned when the Yankees tied the game 
in the ninth inning and won it in the twelfth. On May 9, 2013 Gonzalez 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list with an unhealed blister on his 
throwing thumb; at the time he had a record of 2-2 in six starts with an 
ERA of 4.58.[4] On September 3, 2014, Gonzalez pitched the first complete 
game and shutout of his career against the Cincinnati Reds.[5] González 
struck out a career-high 10 batters on April 14, 2015.[6] Gonzalez struggled 
with injuries throughout 2015, and finished with the worst year of his 
career. He went 9-12 in 26 starts and finished with a 4.91 ERA. On March 
30, 2016, González received his unconditional release by the Orioles, who 
opted to cut him rather than send him to the minor leagues at the beginning 
of the 2016 season.[7] In April 2016, González signed a minor league deal 
with the Chicago White Sox.[8] Gonzalez throws five pitches: a four seam 
fastball at 92-93 MPH, a sinker at 91-93, a curveball at 77-80, a slider
