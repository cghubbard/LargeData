As player As manager William Frederick Jurges (May 9, 1908 – March 3, 1997) 
was an American shortstop, third baseman, manager, coach and scout in Major 
League Baseball. He was born in Bronx, New York. During the 1930s, he was 
central to three (1932, 1935 and 1938) National League champion Chicago 
Cubs teams. In July 1932, Jurges recovered from gunshot wounds—suffered 
when a distraught former girlfriend tried to kill him—to help lead the 
Cubs to the NL flag. A right-handed batter and thrower, he was a light 
hitter—he batted .258 in 1,816 games over 17 seasons—but a good defensive 
shortstop. During his first eight seasons (1931–38) in Chicago, he anchored 
an infield of Stan Hack (third base), Billy Herman (second base), and Charlie 
Grimm or Phil Cavarretta (first base). He then played seven more seasons 
(1939–45) with the New York Giants, missing over 90 games in 1940 after 
he was hit in the head by a pitched ball. However, he recovered to play 
regularly for the Giants from 1941 to 1943. He then returned to the Cubs 
as a player-coach in 1946–47. For a while, during the off-seasons in the 
1930s, Jurges stayed in shape by working out at the Waple Studio of Physical 
Culture in Alexandria, Virginia. On July 6, 1932, Violet Valli, a showgirl 
with whom Jurges was romantically linked, tried to kill Jurges at the Hotel 
Carlos, where both lived. Jurges had previously tried to end their relationship. 
Valli (born Violet Popovich) also left a suicide note in which she blamed 
Cubs outfielder Kiki Cuyler for convincing Jurges to break up with her. 
Although initial reports stated that Jurges was shot while trying to wrestle 
the gun from Valli, later reports, based on Valli's suicide note, stated 
that she was trying to kill Jurges as well as commit suicide.[1] A week 
after the shooting, charges were dismissed against Valli when Jurges appeared 
in court and announced that he would not testify and wished to drop the 
charges.[2] Valli was later involved in a lawsuit when she sued a real 
estate developer who was blackmailing her by threatening to release letters 
in which Valli threatened Jurges.[3] Jurges was a full-time coach in 1948 
under manager Grimm. Then, after leaving the Cubs, Jurges managed briefly 
in the farm systems of the Cleveland Indians and Milwaukee Braves, before 
returning to the coaching ranks with the original Washington Senators franchise 
in 1956. On July 3, 1959, still a Washington coach, he was named the surprise 
manager of the Boston Red Sox, who had fired Pinky Higgins. Jurges was 
able to rally Boston in '59: the Bosox won 44 of 80 games under him, improving 
from eighth to fifth place, and finally broke the color line with the promotion 
of Pumpsie Green from the minor leagues. But the Red Sox, facing the end 
of Ted Williams' great career in 1960, were a team in disarray. Composed 
of aging veterans and mostly unpromising youngsters—and stunned by the 
sudden retirement, in his prime, of right fielder and 1958 Most Valuable 
Player Jackie Jensen—the 1960 Red Sox fell into the American League basement 
after losing 27 of their first 42 games. Jurges, an intense competitor, 
suffered in an alien organization composed largely of cronies of owner 
Tom Yawkey. The Red Sox front office was about to undergo a massive shakeup, 
with Jurges' patron, general manager Bucky Harris, on his way out the door. 
On June 8, Jurges left the team, citing illness. (Some Boston baseball 
writers believed that he suffered from nervous exhaustion.[4]) He was fired 
two days later, and, after bench coach Del Baker handled the team for five 
days, Higgins returned to the manager's post he had lost 11 months before. 
Jurges never managed again in baseball (his final record was 59 wins, 63 
losses — .484) but he scouted for the Houston Colt .45s/Astros, the expansion 
Washington Senators and its successor, the Texas Rangers, the Seattle Mariners,
