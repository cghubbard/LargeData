The UCLA–USC rivalry refers to the American collegiate athletics rivalry 
between the UCLA Bruins sports teams of the University of California, Los 
Angeles (UCLA) and USC Trojans sports teams of the University of Southern 
California (USC). UCLA has the most NCAA Division I-sanctioned team championships 
at 113, while USC has the third most NCAA Division I-sanctioned team championships 
at 102. Both universities are located in Los Angeles. The rivalry between 
the two is among the more unusual in National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) Division I sports, because the campuses are only 12 miles (19 km) 
apart, and both are located within the same city. Furthermore, the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the home stadium of the Trojans football team, 
is located closer to the UCLA campus than UCLA is to the Rose Bowl, the 
home stadium of the Bruins football team. In addition, the USC campus is 
located closer to the Rose Bowl than the UCLA campus is. The close proximity 
of alumni and students and the likelihood of members of those groups encountering 
one another and interacting on a daily basis make this one of the most 
intense college rivalries in the United States. USC is recognized as consistently 
being one of the top football programs in the nation, while UCLA is recognized 
as consistently being one of the top basketball programs in the nation. 
However, a somewhat rare confluence of events occurred in 1954, which began 
with USC in their last of only two Final Four appearance in the 1954 NCAA 
Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and ended with UCLA winning their 
only Football National Championship. Both schools also are successful in 
many "non-revenue" or "olympic" sports. Both have had success in track 
and field, water polo, tennis, volleyball, and golf. USC has won 26 NCAA 
Championships in Men's Outdoor Track and Field, 21 in Men's Tennis, and 
12 in Baseball, the most of any school in each respective sport. Likewise, 
UCLA has won 19 NCAA Championships in Men's Volleyball, 11 in Softball, 
and 7 in Women's Water Polo, also the most of any school in those sports. 
UCLA ranks first overall in NCAA championships with 113. They also rank 
second in men's NCAA team championships with 72, and second (behind Stanford) 
in women's NCAA team championships with 39. USC ranks higher than UCLA 
and first in the nation in men's NCAA team championships with 84; it is 
3rd overall with 102 NCAA titles (behind UCLA and Stanford) .[1] Both school 
also have several non-NCAA Championships, including AIAW and pre-NCAA championships. 
The Lexus Gauntlet is the name given to a competition between UCLA and 
USC in the 18 varsity sports that both compete in head-to-head; in 2003, 
2005, and 2007 UCLA won the Lexus Gauntlet Trophy, while USC won the trophy 
in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2009 (the first back-to-back win). After 
the 2009 season, Lexus stopped sponsoring the award, and the winner has 
been tracked less formally. Since the end of the Lexus sponsorship, USC 
has won in 2010 and 2011. UCLA won in 2012, 2013, and 2014.[2][3][4][5][6] 
Quite often, the winner of the football game has won or shared the Pac-12 
Conference (Pac-12) title in football. A berth in the Rose Bowl game has 
been on the line many times as well for both schools. Since the 1916 formation 
of the Pacific Coast Conference, which the Pac-12 claims as part of its 
history, USC has won or shared 37 conference titles and UCLA has won or 
shared 17 titles.[7] Washington is third in overall conference titles with 
15.[7] Since the 1959 season, when the Pac-12 was formed as the Athletic 
Association of Western Universities, through the 2007 season, the schools 
have won or shared 33 of the 48 conference titles.[7] USC has won 17 championships 
outright, shared eight and gone to the Rose Bowl or BCS bowl 21 times.[7] 
UCLA has won six championships outright, shared five and gone to the Rose 
Bowl eight times.[7] The schools have shared the championship between them 
three times.[7] In 2011, UCLA became the first Pac-12 South Division champion 
while USC held the better of the two records; the Trojans were ineligible 
for postseason play that year due to NCAA sanctions. Both teams have spoiled 
conference and national championship runs for the other. USC was a somewhat 
established national football power under Howard Jones and had begun a 
major rivalry with Notre Dame when UCLA joined the Pacific Coast Conference 
in 1928.[8] Los Angeles Times sportswriter Braven Dyer predicted on the 
day of the first football meeting on September 28, 1929, "In years to come, 
this game will probably be one of the football spectacles of the West" 
[9] USC dominated the early games (so much so, that after the first two 
games, the series was suspended for five years and they did not play each 
other from 1931 to 1935) until UCLA established itself. By the late 1930s, 
star players such as Kenny Washington, Jackie Robinson, and Bob Waterfield 
enabled UCLA to be competitive. With the hiring of Hall of Fame Coach Henry 
"Red" Sanders, UCLA became the more dominant program in the 1950s with 
their one and only National Championship in 1954. A famous quote was attributed 
to Sanders regarding the rivalry, "Beating 'SC is not a matter of life 
or death, it's more important than that." [10][11] But Sanders died suddenly 
of a heart attack, and shortly thereafter, one of the greatest colleges 
football coaches in NCAA history took over the struggling USC program. 
Upon the arrival of their new head coach John McKay (1960–1975), USC entered 
a new golden age in their storied history. During McKay's tenure, the Trojans 
won 8 conference titles, 5 Rose Bowls, produced two Heisman Trophy winners 
(Mike Garrett and O. J. Simpson) and won three National Championships (1962, 
1967, and 1972) and shared one (1974). Against UCLA, McKay was tough to 
beat, posting a 10–5–1 record against the Bruins between 1960 and 1975. 
For most seasons from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s, the two schools 
were the top powers on the West Coast with USC usually holding the top 
spot. In the 15 Rose Bowls played from 1966 to 1980, USC or UCLA played 
in 12 of them. Even with the rise of Don James' Washington Huskies in the 
1980s and early 90s, UCLA or USC still went to the Rose Bowl seven times 
between 1981 and 1995. In the 1990s, UCLA enjoyed an eight-game winning 
streak against USC. The Bruins' unbeaten string ended in 1999 when the 
Trojans began their longest win streak, 7, against the Bruins, though two 
of those wins (2004 and 2005) are now vacated, cutting the USC streak to 
five. This unprecedented dominance was the direct result of the hiring 
of Pete Carroll by USC in 2000.[citation needed] During Carroll's tenure 
(2001–2009 seasons), USC was virtually unbeatable against its two most 
heated rivals, UCLA and Notre Dame. The only game that UCLA beat a Pete 
Carroll-coached team was the 13–9 win in 2006 at the Rose Bowl that kept 
USC out of the BCS Championship game and allowed the Bruins to keep the 
record for consecutive wins (8) in the rivalry. A number of titles have 
been applied to the football game such as: "The Los Angeles City Championship", 
"The Crosstown Showdown", "The Battle of L.A.", or simply the "crosstown 
rivalry".[citation needed] But none really have gained traction. Most often 
the game is referred to as the USC-UCLA (or UCLA-USC) football game by 
the media.[12] Fans of a particular team refer to it as the USC game or 
UCLA game, using the name of the opposing school. At UCLA, the week before 
the game is known as "Beat 'SC Week" (officially dubbed "Blue and Gold 
Week"). At USC, the week before the game is known as "Troy Week" or, more 
popularly, "Conquest".[citation needed] Both schools host a number of activities 
on their respective campuses during the week to promote school spirit. 
Activities include parades, bonfires, rallies, and live entertainment. 
Also, both schools take steps to prevent vandalism of two major landmarks 
on campus: USC wraps its Trojan Shrine (better known as "Tommy Trojan") 
in bubble wrap and duct tape, while UCLA covers its Bruin Bear statue with 
tarp stating "THE BRUIN BEAR IS HIBERNATING. BEAT 'SC.", and more recently 
a $5000 wooden puzzle box. Groups of UCLA students known as "Bruin Bear 
Security Force" also camp out in Bruin Plaza, ostensibly to protect the 
Bruin Bear in the event of a prank, while the USC Trojan Knights hold a 
week-long vigil guarding Tommy Trojan with the sign "Don't Bruin your life". 
This has come as a response to students painting the statues in the rival 
schools' colors before the game. On November 12, 2012, an entrance sign 
at UCLA was defaced with a "S" painted between the letters U and C beside 
obscene graffiti in red spray paint.[citation needed] There are a number 
of inter-campus competitions between various groups before the game. Starting 
with the 2008 season, the winners of a blood drive competition were announced 
during halftime, with the winners donating more blood to the American Red 
Cross. UCLA won in 2008,[18] 2009, 2010 and 2011. On November 13, 2012, 
UCLA served notice to the USC Marching Band that its drum major would not 
be allowed to stab a sword into the Bruins logo before the game in the 
Rose Bowl on November 17, 2012.[19] For a number of years, the schools 
shared the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as their home stadium until UCLA 
moved to the Rose Bowl for the 1982 season. Each school alternated as the 
"home" team for the game, with home fans on the north side of the Coliseum 
and visiting fans on the south (press box) side. Until 1983, players on 
both teams wore their home football jerseys for the game. Since the 1984 
season, when the game was played at the Rose Bowl for the second time, 
the visiting fans sit in the visitor section of each respective stadium, 
and the visiting team wears their white jerseys. Because UCLA called the 
Coliseum home and USC won a number of Rose Bowl games, each school has 
a lifetime winning record in the others' current home stadium. Starting 
in 2006, the coaches at the time, USC coach Pete Carroll and UCLA coach 
Karl Dorrell, expressed an interest in restarting the tradition of both 
teams wearing primary colored home jerseys. At the time, the NCAA football 
rules Article 3. a. stated, "Players of opposing teams shall wear jerseys 
of contrasting colors, and the visiting team shall wear white jerseys."[20] 
USC coach Pete Carroll said he would be willing to lose two timeouts during 
the game so that the USC team could wear their cardinal jerseys for the 
UCLA-USC football game on December 6, 2008.[21] It was determined before 
the 2008 game that the visiting school would only lose one timeout for 
incorrect equipment. Carroll agreed to forfeit a timeout to satisfy the 
ruling and Coach Rick Neuheisel agreed to forfeit one, in return (even 
though, as the coach of the home team, he was not required to do so by 
the ruling) to get back this tradition, and it was renewed in the 2008 
game.[22] In the wake of the coaches' decisions, the NCAA decided to amend 
their rules regarding away teams' uniforms (which were originally put into 
place to provide more contrast for black-and-white photography and television 
broadcasts), changing the rule to state that the teams must agree on the 
decision for both teams to wear their colored jerseys before the game and 
that the uniforms must be of easily contrasted colors.[23] Since the home 
team is already required to wear its colored home jerseys and would not 
be in violation of any equipment rules, this essentially leaves the decision 
up to them as to whether or not to allow the visiting team is to wear their 
home uniforms. When the football teams from these schools compete against 
each other, the victor is awarded the Victory Bell. The Victory Bell was 
originally from an old Southern Pacific railroad locomotive. It was given 
to the UCLA student body by the UCLA Alumni Association in 1939. It was 
UCLA's symbol of victory until it was stolen by a USC organization called 
the Trojan Knights in 1941. After being hidden in various locations for 
over a year before resurfacing in a USC student magazine (known as the 
Wampus), a prank war between the two universities ensued until 1942, when 
the student body presidents of the two schools agreed that the bell would 
be the trophy awarded the winner of the annual UCLA-USC football game. 
The bell itself is brass, and the metal mounting around it is painted blue 
or cardinal by the school that won the football game and earned its possession. 
When UCLA possesses it, the UCLA Rally Committee is responsible for its 
protection and care. While it is in USC's possession, the Trojan Knights 
are responsible for hiding, protecting, and showcasing the bell (including 
ringing the bell during home football games). USC currently has the victory 
bell. Until the Rose Bowl Game became part of the Bowl Championship Series 
(BCS) and later the College Football Playoff (CFP), a berth in the Rose 
Bowl to face the Big Ten Conference champion was the ultimate goal that 
was awarded to the then-Pacific-10 conference champion. Through the 2014 
season, USC has appeared in the Rose Bowl 33 times and UCLA has appeared 
12 times. During the BCS era (1998–2013), the Rose Bowl was the destination 
for the first-place Big Ten and Pac-12 teams, should either fail to qualify 
for the BCS championship game. Since the establishment of the CFP in 2014, 
the Rose Bowl is one of six bowls that rotates as host of a CFP semifinal 
game; in years in which the Rose Bowl does not host a CFP semifinal, the 
Rose Bowl Game is assured of hosting the first-place teams from the two 
conferences should they fail to be selected for the CFP semifinals. UCLA 
was the first Pac-10 team to appear in a BCS bowl, the 1999 Rose Bowl, 
their last conference championship year. USC has appeared in six BCS bowl 
games, winning the BCS championship in 2005. With the Rose Bowl stadium 
being the home field for UCLA, the UCLA–USC rivalry football game has been 
played there to a sellout crowd during even numbered years since 1982. 
Before the Pac-10 expanded in 2011 and became the Pac-12, the Rose Bowl 
and conference championship were on the line for both teams 20 times and 
at least one team 37 times. Following expansion and the division of the 
conference into two football divisions, with UCLA and USC both in the South 
Division, the division title and a berth in the Pac-12 Championship Game 
have been on the line for at least one team twice. Both teams have either 
won the championship or spoiled it for the other at one time or another. 
As of the 2015 season[update], USC leads 45–31–7 (record does not include 
2 USC wins vacated due to NCAA penalty for violation of NCAA rules).[24][25] 
There has been one overtime game in the series in 1996. Many of the games 
of this storied rivalry have ultimately determined the Pac-10 Rose Bowl 
representative and often a chance to play for the national championship. 
USC was forced to vacate both its wins from the 2004 and 2005 seasons due 
to NCAA violations.[24][26] Notes: *USC home game, **UCLA home game, highlighted 
scores indicate school with Rose Bowl on the line, or, after the 2010–13 
NCAA conference realignment, the Pac-12 Championship game on the line. 
UCLA holds the longest winning streak in the series, as UCLA won eight 
straight games from 1991 to 1998. USC's longest streak was for five wins 
from 1999 to 2003. The 1967 USC vs. UCLA football game was one of the defining 
college football games of the 20th century. It matched No. 4 USC with O.J. 
Simpson against No. 1 UCLA with Gary Beban for the Conference Championship, 
National Championship, and Heisman Trophy on the line for Beban or Simpson. 
USC won 21–20 and went on to defeat Indiana in the Rose Bowl and win the 
national championship. Despite Simpson's sensational performance in this 
game and accumulating 1,543 rushing yards for the season, Beban won the 
Heisman Trophy. Simpson won the trophy the following year. Between 1965 
and 1978, the conference championship and Rose Bowl berth were on the line 
for both teams nine times. In two other years (1975 and 1977) between 1965 
and 1978, the Rose Bowl berth was on the line for UCLA only. The USC coaches 
during this time were John McKay and John Robinson, while UCLA was coached 
by Tommy Prothro, Pepper Rodgers, Dick Vermeil, and Terry Donahue. UCLA 
has 31 conference championships and USC has seven. When John Wooden became 
the coach, UCLA turned into a national basketball powerhouse. UCLA has 
won 11 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournaments and has dominated the 
conference, winning two games for every one that USC won. As of the 2013–2014 
season, UCLA has won or shared the conference title 31 times, and USC has 
won or shared the title 9 times.[40] There have been some notable games 
in the rivalry. In Women's basketball, UCLA has one AIAW championship and 
USC has two NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championships. Ironically, 
USC won its second title, in 1984, at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion. The Bruins 
and the Women of Troy have faced each other twice in the second round of 
the AIAW championships with UCLA winning in 1979 and USC winning in 1981. 
Because of the geographical proximity and conference affiliation, UCLA 
and USC compete in other NCAA sanctioned sports, such as Basketball, Track 
and Field, Volleyball, and Water Polo. UCLA and USC are #1 and #3 respectively 
in terms of the most NCAA championships won in Division I as of 2007.[44] 
They have faced each other for the national title in several sports including 
Men's Volleyball and Women's water polo. Although basketball and football 
tend to get the most attention, the rivalry between the two schools is 
intense in every sport. The athletic rivalry began in 1920 when the University 
of California, Southern Branch Cubs defeated USC in spring baseball 7–6.[45] 
USC has gone on to be the premier team in college baseball with 21 appearances 
in the College World Series and 12 titles, the most of any school and double 
the next closest school, Texas, who has six titles in 34 appearances. UCLA 
has appeared in the College World Series five times. UCLA won its first 
NCAA Baseball title in 2013. As of the end of the 2014 season, USC leads 
UCLA in the series 256–130.[46] Since 2010, UCLA and USC have met in the 
second game of a college baseball doubleheader at Dodger Stadium called 
the Dodgertown classic as well as a three-game conference series.[47] Both 
the USC Fencing Club and UCLA fencing club are in the Intercollegeiate 
Fencing Conference of Southern California (IFCSC). They compete against 
NCAA fencing teams as well, such as UCSD, Caltech, and ASU.[48][49][50] 
UCLA women's soccer team has dominated the Women of Troy, 22–5–1. But at 
the 2007 NCAA College Cup, USC won in the semi-finals, ended UCLA's 8 straight 
victories over the Trojans. USC went on to be the first Pac-10 (as it was 
called at the time) school to win the NCAA Women's Soccer Championship. 
In the 2008 regular season game, a pair of goals by Kristina Larsen gave 
UCLA a 2–1 win over USC in the Los Angeles Coliseum before a record crowd 
of 7,804 fans. To advance to the NCAA Championship quarterfinals, the Bruins 
defeated the Women of Troy (1–0) in the round of 16 on Saturday, November 
22, 2008 at Drake Stadium. It was also a battle between UCLA's Lauren Cheney 
and Kara Lang and USC's Amy Rodriguez, all of whom participated in the 
Beijing Olympic Games—Cheney and Rodriguez for the USA and Lang for Canada. 
Cheney and Rodriguez would win gold medals with Team USA, defeating Lang's 
Canada team in the quarterfinals. UCLA won the NCAA Division I Women's 
Soccer Championship in 2013, defeating Florida State 1–0 in overtime. As 
of the 2014 season, USC has won 21 NCAA Men's Tennis Championships and 
UCLA has won 16. USC has won 5 of the last 6 (2009–2012, 2014), while UCLA's 
most recent Championship was in 2005. There was a run from 1960 to 1971 
where either UCLA or USC was the champion. In twelve of the tournaments, 
one team has been runner-up to the other who won the championship, with 
an even split of six championships for both UCLA and USC. UCLA has won 
two NCAA Division I Women's Tennis Championships, most recently in 2014. 
USC won in 1983 and 1985. UCLA has dominated men's volleyball under the 
coaching of Al Scates. As of 2013, UCLA has won 19 NCAA Men's Volleyball 
Championships. The next closest school is Pepperdine with five NCAA titles. 
USC has won four NCAA titles. UCLA and USC have faced each other in the 
championship game of the NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship four times. 
In women's volleyball, UCLA won the 2011 national Championship. UCLA now 
has won four and USC has won three NCAA Women's Volleyball Championships 
in Division I. In addition, USC and UCLA have won three AIAW Women's volleyball 
championships. In 1981 USC defeated UCLA three games to two in the first 
NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship game. In 1976 USC defeated UCLA to 
win the AIAW volleyball championship. The two schools compete in water 
polo. In men's, UCLA carries a slight lead over USC in the all-time series 
of 80–76–1. In the NCAA Men's Water Polo Championship, the two school are 
tied with 9 championships apiece. UCLA won the most recent championship 
in 2014, with USC winning the prior 6 titles dating back to 2008. Due to 
the low number of schools participating in the sport and the State of California's 
dominance (no team from outside of California has ever played in the championship 
match), title game matches between the two teams are relatively common, 
occurring in 1996, 2009, 2012, and 2012. In title game matches, USC holds 
a 3–2 advantage. UCLA won 8–7 in 1996, and 9-8 in 2014, while USC won 7–6 
in 2009, 7-4 in 2011, and 11-10 in 2012. In women's water polo, UCLA has 
a commanding 46-22 lead over USC in the all-time series. In the NCAA Women's 
Water Polo Championship, UCLA dominated early on, winning 7 of the first 
9 NCAA Championships, including the first tournament in 2001. USC has won 
4, most recently in 2016. The two teams have faced each other in the women's 
title game 3 times, in 2006, 2008, and 2009. UCLA won all 3 matches by 
scores of 9–8, 6–3,[51] and 5–4, respectively. All three wins were part 
of UCLA's streak of 5 consecutive championships. As of December 18, 2014[update], 
USC leads the all-time all-sport record 967–922–10.[52] Men's Women's Italic 
sports are inactive due to one of both schools discontinuing the sport 
Note: This record includes all games played in active sports, but does 
not include every inactive sport. Both UCLA and USC send many athletes 
to the Olympic Games. As of the last games, USC athletes account for 258 
medals and UCLA athletes account for 241. A USC Trojan has been a Gold 
medal winner in every summer Olympics since 1912. As of the 2008 Summer 
Olympics, UCLA and USC athletes combined account for nearly one fifth of 
all medals won by the United States of America and their 499 combined medals 
would rank 9th on the country list.[53] [54] [55] [56] $35,570 (non-resident)[60] 
The UCLA–USC rivalry is like few other college or university rivalries. 
Both universities are in the same city. Both universities are at the top 
in the nation not only for their sports achievements, but also for academic 
standing. While UCLA historically has been viewed as the more selective 
institution, USC has made great strides in improving its position in university 
rankings. Graduate schools at both universities are among the top in their 
fields. Furthermore, graduates from both universities work together all 
across Southern California. It is not uncommon for married couples or family 
members to consist of graduates from each school. Undergraduates of one 
school can be found attending graduate school and/or professional school 
across town. High schools in Southern California send some of their top 
graduates to both schools every year, as do community colleges around Los 
Angeles. Students from each school, including athletes, even can be found 
rooming together in the same house or apartment in Los Angeles. The rivalry 
is also a microcosm of a geopolitical rivalry based upon the locations 
of the schools, the cost of attending each school, and the founding and 
growth patterns of the schools. UCLA is located on the Westside of Los 
Angeles and is nestled between many several of the most affluent and desirable 
communities in southern California: Brentwood, Bel-Air, Beverly Hills and 
Westwood. Although this area was relatively remote and unsettled at the 
time of UCLA's founding, decades of growth in the area around campus means 
that UCLA is hardly the suburban location it once was. In 2012, Bruins 
football coach Jim Mora said he sold recruits on the safety of UCLA's campus 
location. "I mean, we don't have murders one block off our campus," said 
Mora. He denied he was making a reference to USC, which months earlier 
had two of their students killed near campus.[61] USC, by contrast, is 
located on the Southern fringe of downtown Los Angeles by Exposition Park. 
In the early years of the city, it was a fashionable area, but it began 
to be rundown as wealthier residents migrated towards other suburban neighborhoods, 
following the national trend. USC was an isolated enclave for a number 
of years and the surrounding neighborhood had a bad reputation. Lately, 
with newer downtown construction, the area is becoming connected with downtown 
again, although the neighborhood remains marginal. Most of the major LA 
area public sports facilities are located near campus, including the Los 
Angeles Coliseum and Staples Center. The University of California is a 
public university, while the University of Southern California is a private 
university. As a public university, UCLA offers discounted attendance rates 
for California residents. For 2009–10 the estimated cost of attendance 
(tuition, fees, room, board, books, etc.) at UCLA is approximately $30,476 
for in-state students living on campus, compared to $53,354 for out-of-state 
students, also living on campus.[62] At USC, no differentiation in fees 
is made between California residents and those coming from out-of-state. 
USC estimates the cost of attendance for all students living on campus 
for the 2009–10 school year at about $60,801 [63] The University of California 
System has raised fees on all its campuses, including at UCLA, over the 
years to account for declines in state support and to keep pace with inflation.[64] 
Costs of attendance at both UCLA and USC may be off-set by financial aid, 
in the form of loans or grants based on merit or need or both. This includes 
athletic scholarships. USC was established in 1880 and UCLA was founded 
in 1919 when California Gov. William D. Stephens signed California Assembly 
Bill 626, establishing the Southern Branch of the University of California. 
UCLA moved to its current location in 1927 when it was renamed the University 
of California at Los Angeles. USC had been playing football since 1888 
and joined the Pacific Coast Conference in 1922. UCLA started playing football
