Forepaugh Park was a baseball ground located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
at Broad and Dauphin Streets in North Philadelphia. The ground was home 
to the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association, and the Philadelphia 
Quakers of the Players' League in 1890.[1] The location was named for Adam 
Forepaugh, the owner of the Forepaugh Circus.( Rich Westcott, Philadelphia's 
Old Ballparks, Temple University Press, 1996, p. 6.) The circus' previous 
site had been the site occupied by the Union Association club, Keystone 
Park. Coordinates: 39°59′17″N 75°09′22″W﻿ / ﻿39.988°N 75.156°W﻿ / 39.988;
