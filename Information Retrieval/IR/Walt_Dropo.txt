Walter Dropo (Serbian: Валтер Дропо, Valter Dropo; January 30, 1923 – December 
17, 2010), nicknamed "Moose", was an American college basketball standout 
and a professional baseball first baseman. During a 13-year career in Major 
League Baseball, he played for the Boston Red Sox (1949–1952), Detroit 
Tigers (1952–1954), Chicago White Sox (1955–1958), Cincinnati Redlegs (1958–1959) 
and Baltimore Orioles (1959–1961). Dropo's Serbian parents emigrated from 
Mostar, then Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now Bosnia and Herzegovina), to start 
a new life. His father, Savo, worked at the local textile mill while also 
running their Connecticut family farm. Walter was raised in Moosup, Connecticut, 
where he played sandlot baseball with his brothers Milton and George, and 
attended Plainfield High School in the Central Village district of Plainfield, 
Connecticut, before attending the University of Connecticut. While at the 
University of Connecticut Dropo played for the football team, basketball 
team and baseball team. Dropo left UConn as the school's all-time leading 
scorer in basketball. Dropo was drafted in the first round of the 1947 
BAA Draft by the Providence Steamrollers with the fourth overall pick. 
Dropo was also drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 9th round of the 1946 
NFL Draft.[1] Listed at 6'5", 220 lb (100 kg), Walter turned down offers 
from the Bears[1] and the Providence Steamrollers, in order to sign with 
the Red Sox as an amateur free agent in 1947.[2] He debuted on April 19, 
1949, and in 11 games batted .146 (6-for-41). In 1950, Dropo led the league 
in RBIs (144) and total bases (326), while batting .322 and hitting 34 
home runs, (second only to Al Rosen 37). In addition, his .583 slugging 
percentage and 70 extra base hits were second only to the .585 – 75 of 
Joe DiMaggio, and his .961 OPS finished third in the league, after Larry 
Doby (.986) and DiMaggio (.979). Dropo finished sixth in American League 
Most Valuable Player award, and earned AL Rookie of the Year honors, ahead 
of Whitey Ford. His efforts that season led to his only All-Star appearance. 
In 1951, Dropo fractured his right wrist and never had another season the 
equal of his 1950 campaign. After another one-plus season, he was traded 
to Detroit on June 3, 1952. After being traded, he collected 12 consecutive 
hits to tie the MLB record. Included in the streak was a 5-for-5 game against 
the Yankees (July 14) and a 4-for-4 performance in the first game of a 
doubleheader against Washington (July 15). In the second game, he went 
4-for-5, hitting on his first three at bats and popping out on his fourth 
at bat on the 7th inning, matching an American League record of 16 hits 
in three games. In that season, he hit a combined 29 home runs and 97 RBIs, 
but would never again hit over 19 homers (1955) or bat over .281 (1954). 
In a 13-season career, Dropo batted .270 (1,113-for-4,124) with 152 home 
runs, 704 RBIs, 478 runs, 168 doubles, 22 triples and five stolen bases 
in 1,288 games. Dropo died of natural causes on December 17, 2010, at the 
age of 87.[3] His funeral service was held at the Serbian Orthodox Church 
he helped found at 41 Alewife Brook Parkway, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
and he was laid to rest at Evergreen Cemetery in Plainfield, Connecticut[4]
