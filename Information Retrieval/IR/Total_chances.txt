In baseball statistics, total chances (TC), also called chances offered, 
represents the number of plays in which a defensive player has participated. 
It is calculated as follows: Total Chances = assists + putouts + errors. 
Chances accepted refers to the total of putouts and assists only. Fielding 
percentage is calculated as chances accepted divided by total chances.
