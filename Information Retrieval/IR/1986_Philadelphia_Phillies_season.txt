The 1986 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 104th season for the Phillies. 
Under second-year manager John Felske, the Phillies stayed just below the 
.500 mark for roughly two-thirds of the season, until a charge after the 
All-Star break pushed the club past the St. Louis Cardinals and Montreal 
Expos into second place in the NL East.[1] The eventual World Series champions 
rival New York Mets finished with a Major League best 108-54 record, and 
finished 21 1‚ÅÑ2 games ahead of the Phillies. The Mets and the Phillies 
were the only teams in the National League East to post winning records.[1] 
Mike Schmidt became the first third baseman in the history of the National 
League to win the MVP Award three times.[2] On August 20, 1986, pitcher 
Don Carman took a perfect game into the ninth inning against the San Francisco 
Giants at Candlestick Park. Giants catcher Bob Brenly hit a long drive 
into the gap in left-center field. Phillies center fielder Milt Thompson 
was positioned to make a running catch but the ball hit the base of his 
glove and was ruled a hit.[7] Carman pitched nine innings, gave up one 
hit, and was the winner when the Phillies scored in the top of the tenth 
on a Juan Samuel solo homer to win the game 1 to 0.[8] The Phillies were 
the only team in the National League to post a winning record against the 
World Series champs, going 10-8 with a 7-2 mark at Veterans Stadium. The 
high point of the season for the Phillies was the three-game sweep of the 
Mets in mid-September.[1] On September 12, up by 22 games, the Mets needed 
to win one game to clinch the division and came to Philadelphia for a weekend 
series. The Phillies won all three games, finishing the weekend by beating 
the Mets 6-0 behind a six-hit shutout by Kevin Gross who also tripled home 
two runs. The sweep still left the Phillies down 19 games but was both 
especially satisfying given the significant number of Mets fans who had 
traveled to Veterans Stadium for the weekend hoping to see the Mets clinch,[1][9][10] 
and necessary because they were swept in a three-game series in Chicago 
preceding this series and did not want to see a visiting team's division-title 
celebration at Veterans Stadium.[11][12] Had the Mets won one of the three 
games, it would have been the first time that a division title was won 
at Veterans Stadium.[11] During the series, Mets fans at Veterans Stadium 
became unruly and damaged seats in the upper deck.[9] One Mets fan was 
arrested after striking at two Philadelphia police officers.[9] The club 
scored a season-high 19 runs in a 19-1 throttling of the Chicago Cubs at 
the Vet on June 23. Hall-of-Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt won the NL 
MVP for the third and final time in his career with a league-high 37 home 
runs with 119 RBI and a .290 average.[2] The Phillies distant second-place 
finish made Schmidt the first major-league MVP to have played on a team 
that finished at least 20 games first place.[13] Infielders Coaches Note:
