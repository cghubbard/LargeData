Sport in Australia is an important part of Australian culture dating back 
to the early colonial period. Australian rules football, is the most popular 
sport in terms of attendance, media presence and overall interest.[1] Cricket, 
Australian rules football, rugby union and horse racing are among the earliest 
organised sports in Australia. Sport has shaped the Australian national 
identity through events such as the Ashes, the Melbourne Cup and the America's 
Cup. There are a number of professional sport leagues in Australia, including 
the Australian Football League (AFL) (Australian rules football), the Big 
Bash League (BBL) and Sheffield Shield (cricket), the National Basketball 
League and the Women's National Basketball League, the A-League and the 
W-League (soccer), the Australian Baseball League, the National Rugby League 
(rugby league), Super Rugby (rugby union), the ANZ Championship (netball) 
and the International V8 Supercars Championship (touring car racing). Attendance 
for the A-League, AFL and NRL over the course of a single season tops six 
million. Major professional sports leagues in Australia are similar to 
major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in that 
they do not practice promotion and relegation, unlike sports leagues in 
Europe. The media plays an important part in Australia's sporting landscape, 
with many sporting events televised or broadcast on radio. The government 
has anti-siphoning laws to protect free-to-air stations. Beyond televising 
live events, there are many sport-related television and radio programs, 
as well as several magazine publications dedicated to sport. Australian 
sport has also been the subject of Australian-made films such as The Club, 
Australian Rules, The Final Winter and Footy Legends. As a nation, Australia 
has competed in many international events, including the Olympics and Paralympics. 
The country has also twice hosted the Summer Olympics in Melbourne (1956) 
and Sydney (2000), as well as the Commonwealth Games on four occasions. 
The city of Melbourne is famous for its major sport events and is often 
considered the 'sporting capital'. "Australia's sporting history is marked 
by great successes, great stories and truly great moments. Sport speaks 
a universal language in this country – we are a nation of players and enthusiasts." 
Sport came to Australia in 1810 when the first athletics tournament was 
held; soon after cricket, horse racing and sailing clubs and competitions 
started. Australia's lower classes would play sports on public holidays, 
with the upper classes playing more regularly on Saturdays.[3] Sydney was 
the early hub of sport in the colony.[4] Early forms of football were played 
there by 1829.[5] Early sport in Australia was played along class lines. 
In 1835, the British Parliament banned blood sports except fox hunting 
in a law that was implemented in Australia; this was not taken well in 
the country as it was seen as an attack on the working classes.[6] By the 
late 1830s, horse racing was established in New South Wales and other parts 
of the country, and enjoyed support across class lines. Gambling was part 
of sport from the time horse racing became an established sport in the 
colony.[6] Horse racing was also happening in Melbourne at Batman's Hill 
in 1838, with the first race meeting in Victoria taking place in 1840.[7] 
Cricket was also underway with the Melbourne Cricket Club founded in 1838.[7][8] 
Sport was being used during the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s as a form of social 
integration across classes.[9] Victorian rules football (later known as 
Australian rules) was codified in 1859.[10][11] Australian football clubs 
still around in the current Australian Football League were founded by 
1858.[8][10][11] The Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia's largest sporting 
arena, opened in 1853.[12] The Melbourne Cup was first run in 1861.[13] 
A rugby union team was established at the University of Sydney in 1864.[13] 
Regular sport did not begin to be played in South Australia, Tasmania and 
Western Australia until the late 1860s and early 1870s.[4] The first Australian 
cricket team to go on tour internationally did so in 1868. The Australian 
side was an all Aboriginal one and toured England where they played 47 
games, where they won 14 games, drew 19 and lost 14.[14]Australia's adoption 
of sport as a national was pastime was so comprehensive that Anthony Trollope 
remarked in his book, Australia, published in 1870, "The English passion 
for the amusements which are technically called 'sports', is not a national 
necessity with the Americans, whereas with the Australians it is almost 
as much so as home."[15] The first team formally organised soccer team 
was formed in Sydney in 1880 and was named the Wanderers.[16][17] Sport 
was receiving coverage in Australian newspapers by 1876 when a sculling 
race in England was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald.[4] In 1877, 
Australia played in the first Test Cricket match against England. In 1882, 
The Ashes were started following the victory of the Australia national 
cricket team over England.[13][18] Field hockey teams for men and women 
were established by 1890.[19] The Sheffield Shield cricket competition 
was first held in 1891 with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia 
participating in the inaugural competition. The remaining states would 
not participate until much later, with Queensland first participating in 
1926–27, Western Australia in 1947–48 and Tasmania in 1982–83.[20][21] 
In 1897 the Victorian Football League, which later became the AFL the Australian 
Football League, was founded[13][22] after breaking away from the Victorian 
Football Association.[22] The first badminton competition in Australia 
was played in 1900.[23] The first ice hockey game was played in Melbourne 
on 12 July 1906 between a local Melbourne team and a team from the crew 
of the visiting US warship USS Baltimore.[24] Rugby league has been the 
overwhelmingly dominant rugby code in Australia since 1908 (this position 
remains unchallenged to this day). When Messenger and the All Golds returned 
from Great Britain in 1908, they helped the new clubs adapt to the rules 
of rugby league prior to the inaugural 1908 NSWRFL season. The Queensland 
Rugby Football League also formed early in 1908 by seven rugby players 
who were dissatisfied with the administration of the Queensland Rugby Union.[25] 
The Australia national rugby union team had their first international test 
against New Zealand in 1903, and first international tour in 1908, earning 
their nickname of the Wallabies after two British journalists used it to 
refer to the team.[26] The team won gold at the 1908 Summer Olympics; however 
the majority of the squad joined rugby league clubs upon returning to Australia.[27] 
Women represented Australia for the first time at the Olympics in 1912.[13] 
Surfing came to Australia by 1915[13] with the first surf life saving competition 
being held that year.[28] Les Darcy began his boxing career in 1915, with 
some of his later fights taking place at Sydney Stadium. The following 
year, an American promoter encouraged Darcy to go to the United States 
at a time when Australia was actively recruiting young men for the armed 
services. Controversy resulted and Darcy died at the age of 21 in the United 
States. When his body was returned to Australia, 100,000 people attended 
his Sydney funeral.[29][30][31][32][33] Darcy would remain significant 
to Australians into the 2000s, when Kevin Rudd mentioned his story.[33] 
In 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical 
education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding 
what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the 
level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls 
that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate 
in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Football was completely 
medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate 
for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done 
in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback 
riding.[34] Dick Eve won Australia's first Olympic diving gold medal in 
1924.[35] In 1924 the Australian Rugby League Board of Control, later to 
be known as the Australian Rugby League, was formed to administer the national 
team (the Kangaroos), and later as the national governing body for the 
sport of Rugby League. In 1928 the team also adopted the national colours 
of green and gold for the first time, having previously used blue and maroon, 
making the Kangaroos the third national sporting body to do so after cricket 
(from 1899) and the Australian Olympic team (from 1908).[36] Netball Australia 
was founded in 1927 as the All Australia Women's Basket Ball Association.[13] 
During the 1930s, the playing of sport on Sunday was banned in most country 
outside South Australia.[37] The Bodyline cricket series between Australia 
and England took place in 1932–33. The English side were very determined 
to win, using physical intimidation against Australia to insure it.[38][39] 
The bowling style used by the team known body-line bowling was devised 
by Douglas Jardine with advice from Frank Foster in England ahead of the 
series in order to defeat Australian batsman Donald Bradman. Going into 
the start of the series, Bill Voce told the media "If we don't beat you, 
we'll knock your bloody heads off." The style of play was such that the 
Australians contemplated cancelling the series after the Adelaide test.[39][40] 
Following a successful Australian racing career, the race horse Phar Lap 
went to the United States where he died. There were many conspiracy theories 
at the time and later that suggested people in the United States poisoned 
the horse to prevent him from winning.[38] Australian women's sports had 
an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world 
in the period after World War II. Women's sports organisations had largely 
remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This 
structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt 
because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and 
other issues facing post-war Europe.[41] In September 1949, Australian 
Canoeing is founded as the Australian Canoe Federation.[42] By the 1960s, 
Australia had an international identity as a sport-obsessed country, an 
identity which was embraced inside the country. This was so well known 
that in a 1962 edition of Sports Illustrated, Australia was named the most 
sports obsessed country in the world.[43] In 1967, Australia hosted the 
second World Netball Championships in Perth.[44] That same year, South 
Australia became the last state to lift its ban on the playing of sports 
on Sunday.[37] Starting in the early 1970s, Australian sport underwent 
a paradigm shift with sponsorship becoming one of the fundamental drivers 
of earnings for Australian sport on amateur and professional levels. By 
the mid-1980s, the need for the ability to acquire sponsorship dollars 
in sport was so great that job applicants for sport administrator positions 
were expected to be able to demonstrate an ability to get it.[45] During 
the 1970s, Australia was being routinely defeated in major international 
competitions as Eastern Bloc countries enjoyed strong government support 
for sport. The Liberal governments at the time were opposed to similar 
intervention in Australia's sporting system as they felt it would be government 
intrusion into an important component of Australian life.[46] In the 1974 
elections, several Australian sporting competitors endorsed the Liberal 
party in advertisements that ran on television. Competitors involved included 
Ron Barassi, NSWRL player Johnny Raper and horse trainer Tommie Smith.[47] 
That year, the Australian team qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the 
first successful qualification to the FIFA World Cup in the country's history 
after failing to qualify to the 1966 and 1970 tournaments. It would prove 
to be the only appearance for the Australian team for more than three decades.[16] 
The regional football code divide in Australia was still present in the 
1980s, with rugby league football being the dominant code in Queensland, 
ACT and New South Wales while Australian rules football dominated in the 
rest of the country. When codes went outside of their traditional geographic 
home, they had little success in gaining new fans and participants.[20] 
The Australian Institute of Sport was founded in 1981.[48] In the lead 
up to and during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, the police were called upon 
to stop protests by Aboriginal land rights activists who staged protests 
timed with the event in order to politicise the event.[49] Australia had 
competitors in the America's Cup yacht race for a number of years. Going 
into the 1983 race, the Australian media was not that interested in the 
race as they expected a similar result and in the media lead-up to the 
event, made it out to be a race for rich people. This lack of interest 
continued throughout the early races. Near the end, when Australia finally 
appeared poised to win it, millions of Australians turned on their television 
to watch the Australia II win the competition.[50] That year, the Liberals 
used Australian tennis star John Newcombe and race car drivers Peter Brock 
and Alan Jones in their political advertising.[51] Athletes would again 
be used, this time by the Labor Party, in the 1989 elections.[51] During 
the 1980s, Australian soccer players began to start playing regularly in 
overseas professional leagues, with the most successful player of the decade 
being Craig Johnston who scored a goal in the 1986 F.A. Cup Final for Liverpool.[16] 
During the 1980s, the federal government created a number of sport programs 
including Aussie Sports and Active Australia.[52] The Australia women's 
national field hockey team began their run as one of the top teams in the 
world in 1985, a place they would hold until 2000.[19] In 1990, the Victorian 
Football League changed its name to the Australian Football League. During 
the 1990s, soccer in Australia faced a challenge in attracting youth players 
because of the ethnic nature of the sport at the highest levels of national 
competition. The sport's governing body made an effort to make the game 
less ethnically oriented. At the same time, rival football codes were intentionally 
trying to bring in ethnic participants in order to expand their youth playing 
base.[53] Doping became a concern during the 1980s and more active steps 
were taken to combat it in Australia in the early 1990s. In 1990, the Australian 
Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 was passed and took control of doping test 
away from the Australian Sport Commission and put it into the hands of 
an independent doping control agency as of 17 February 1991.[54] In 2006, 
Melbourne hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Games.[55] Later that year, the 
Australian team competed in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their second FIFA 
World Cup appearance after 32 years of failing to qualify for the tournament.[56] 
In 2012, the Australian Rugby League Commission was formed, bringing to 
an end the involvement of News Limited in the administration of Rugby League 
and the media companies' conflict of interests in the sport, finally concluding 
the fall-out from the Super League war in the 1990s.[57] From 2008 until 
2013, the Australian thoroughbred mare Black Caviar was undefeated in 25 
races, a record not equaled in over 100 years.[58] Notable wins include 
the 2012 Diamond Jubilee Stakes, as well as being named the top sprinter 
from 2010 to 2012 in the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings and entering 
the Australian Racing Hall of Fame. The organisation of sport in Australia 
has been largely determined by its Federal system of government – Australian 
Government and six states and two territories governments and local governments.[59] 
State and Territory governments have a department with responsibility for 
sport and recreation. These departments provide assistance to state sports 
organisations, develop and manage sporting facilities, provide financial 
assistance for major sporting events and develop policies to assist sports 
across their state or territory. Each Australian State and Territory has 
established its own institute/academy of sport – ACT Academy of Sport (established 
1989), New South Wales Institute of Sport (1996), Northern Territory Institute 
of Sport (1996), Queensland Academy of Sport (1991), South Australian Sports 
Institute (1982), Tasmanian Institute of Sport (1985), Victorian Institute 
of Sport (1990) and Western Australian Institute of Sport (1984).[60] There 
are 560 local councils across Australia. Local governments generally focus 
on the provision of facilities such as swimming pools, sporting fields, 
stadiums and tennis courts.[61] Government involvement in sport up until 
the 1970s was fairly limited with local governments playing a major role 
through the provision of sporting facilities.[59] However, this changed 
over the next two decades with an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey 
in 2001–2002 finding that approximately $2 billion was spent on sport by 
three levels of government – 10 per cent from the Australian Government, 
40 per cent from state and territory governments, and the remaining 50 
per cent from local government.[62] State, territory and local government 
spending was predominantly directed to facilities and their upkeep.[62] 
In 1973, the Recreation Minister's Council was established to provide a 
forum for Australian Government and State and Territory Minister's responsible 
for sport and recreation to discuss matters of interest.[59] With government's 
taking an increased involvement in sport, it became the Sport and Recreation 
Minister's Council.[59] More recently is referred to as Meeting of Sport 
and Recreation Ministers.[63] The Meeting is assisted by the Committee 
of Australian Sport and Recreation Officials (CASRO) previously called 
the Standing Committee on Sport and Recreation (SCORS).[63] The Meeting 
works cooperatively on issues such as match fixing, sport participation 
and water safety.[64] In 2011, Minister's signed the National Sport and 
Active Recreation Policy Framework.[65] The framework "provides a mechanism 
for the achievement of national goals for sport and active recreation, 
sets out agreed roles and responsibilities of governments and their expectations 
of sport and active recreation partners." [65] In 1993, National Elite 
Sports Council was established to provide a forum for communication, issues 
management and national program coordination across the high performance 
in Australia.[60] It includes representatives from AIS, State Institute 
/Academies, Australian Olympic Committee, Australian Paralympic Committee, 
and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association.[66][67] In 2011, National 
Institute System Intergovernmental Agreement provides "guidance on how 
the sector will operate, with a principal focus on the delivery of the 
high performance plans of national sporting organisations." [68] The Australian 
government provided small amounts of funding in the 1950s and 1960s through 
the support of the National Fitness Council and international sporting 
teams such as the Australian Olympic team.[59] The Australian Government's 
serious involvement and investment into sport came with it establishing 
the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in 1981.[59] AIS was set up to 
improve Australia's performances in international sport which had started 
to decline in the 1960s and 1970s culminating in Australia winning no gold 
medals at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.[60] In 1985, the Australian Sports 
Commission (ASC) was established to improve the Australian Government's 
administration of sport in terms of funding, participation and elite sport.[60] 
The 1989 Senate Inquiry into drugs in sport resulted in the establishment 
of the Australian Sport Drug Agency (now called Australian Sports Anti-Doping 
Authority (ASADA)) in 1990 to manage Australia's anti-doping program.[60] 
The highest rates of participation for Australian sport and recreation 
are informal, non-organised sports with bike riding, skateboarding, rollerblading 
or riding a scooter topping the list of activities for children, with 66% 
of all boys bike riding and 55.9% of all boys skateboarding, rollerblading 
or riding a scooter in 2009 and 2010. Girls also participated in these 
activities at high rates with 54.4% of them doing bike riding and 42.4% 
skateboarding, rollerblading or riding a scooter. Other sports popular 
for Australian girls include dancing, which had 26.3% participation, swimming 
with 19.8% participation and netball at 17%. For boys, the other popular 
sports for participation included soccer with a rate of participation of 
19.9%, swimming with a participation rate of 17.2%, Australian rules at 
16%.[69] Participation rates for adults in Australia were much lower than 
that of Australian children. For adult women in Australia, the number one 
sport activity they participate in is walking with 30% having done this 
in 2009 and 2010. The second most popular form of exercise and sport was 
Aerobics/fitness/gym with a rate of 16.7%. The third most popular for adult 
women was swimming and diving with 8.4%. For men, the most popular sport 
activity was also walking with a participation rate of 15.6%. This was 
followed by Aerobics/fitness/gym with 11.2%. The third most popular sport 
for adult males was cycling/BMXing with a participation rate of 8.2%.[69] 
There are 34,000 athletes, officials and coaches currently registered with 
the Athletics Australia.[70] A 2007 estimate claimed that Australian football 
had 615,549 participants,[71] Basketball has become one of the most popular 
participation sports in Australia. In Victoria, and Melbourne, particularly, 
it has more participants than any other sport.[72][73][74] Australia's 
warm climate and long coastline of sandy beaches and rolling waves provide 
ideal conditions for water sports such as swimming. The majority of Australians 
live in cities or towns on or near the coast, and so beaches are a place 
that millions of Australians visit regularly.[75] According to the National 
Cricket Census, a record 1,311,184 people played Cricket across Australia 
in 2015-16, an 8.5 percent increase on 2014-15 – placing cricket at No.1 
as the current top participation sport in Australia. Women participation 
also reached record figures in 2015-16, growing nine percent to 314,936 
players. Club and community participation jumped 9.5 percent to 454,657 
during the same period, with juniors aged 5‐12 years making up 59.4 percent 
of all 2015‐16 participants.[76] Amateur sport in Australia follows a corporate 
management system, with the national tier composed of national sport organisations 
that support and fund elite sport development. These organisations include 
the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission. 
Below them is the state level, which includes state sporting organisations, 
state institute of sport and state departments of sport. The last level 
is district/regional associations and local clubs and community sports 
along with local government.[77] At the national level, the national sport 
organisations govern most sports in Australia, with over 120 different 
national sports organisation overseeing sport in Australia.[78][79] The 
role of government in this structure is important[77][80] as government 
funding for most sport in Australia comes from the national government, 
state and territory governments, and local governments. In the late 1990s, 
government support for sport was double that of public non-financial corporations.[80] 
Amateur sport was transformed in Australia in the 1980s with the creation 
of the Australian Institute of Sport. The Institute, formally opened by 
Malcolm Fraser in 1981, was designed to make Australian amateur sport at 
major world competitions, like the Olympics, competitive with the rest 
of the world and increase the number of medals won by the country.[81] 
A few years later, in 1984, the Australian Sports Commission was created 
to better address the distribution of funds to support sport.[82] It had 
a budget of A$109 million in 200.[52] By 2009, the Australian Sports Commission 
had a budget of A$150 million, up from A$5 million when it first was created.[82] 
Amateur sport has been able to draw large audiences. In the 1950s, 120,000 
fans would go to the MCG to watch major athletics events.[83] Australian 
amateur sport has dealt with financial problems. In the 2000s, Athletics 
Australia was facing duel problems of financial problems and failure for 
the sport to consistently medal at major international sporting events 
compared to other sports and their representative organisations like Swimming 
Australia and Rowing Australia.[84] Australian sport fans have historically 
attended events in large numbers, dating back to the country's early history. 
An early football game played in Melbourne in 1858 had 2,000 spectators.[85] 
By 1897, tens of thousands of spectators attended an early Australian rules 
football match at a time when top level soccer matches in England would 
draw six thousand fans. A finals match between the Carlton Football Club 
and Collingwood in 1938 drew 96,834 fans.[86] In 1909, at a time when rugby 
union had not yet become professionalised, 52,000 people in Sydney attended 
a game between New South Wales and New Zealand. The spectators accounted 
for 10% of the total population of Sydney at the time.[87] A world record 
was set for cricket attendance on 30 December 1932 when 63,993 fans watched 
England take on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[88] Total average 
game attendance for the Australian Football League and the National Rugby 
League increased between 1970 and 2000, with the AFL going from an average 
attendance of 24,344 people per match in 1970 to 27,325 by 1980 to 25,238 
in 1990 and 34,094 by 2000. The National Rugby League had an average per 
game attendance of 11,990 in 1970, saw a decrease in 1980 to 10,860 but 
increased to 12,073 by 1990 and improved on that to 14,043 by 2000. Founded 
later, the National Basketball League had an average per game attendance 
of 1,158 in 1985, increased this to 4,551 by 1990, and kept attendance 
steady with 4,636 average fans per game in 2000.[89] In March 1999, 104,000 
fans attended a double header match in the National Rugby League at Stadium 
Australia four days after the venue formally opened.[90] In 2000, during 
the soccer gold medal match between Cameroon and Spain, 114,000 fans watched 
the game live inside Stadium Australia.[91] In the 2006–07 season, the 
A-League Melbourne Victory averaged 27,728 people to their home matches 
throughout the season. The 2009–10 regular season was considerably lower.[92] 
In 2011, the Australian Football League had a cumulative attendance of 
7,139,272, a record for the competition and an average attendance of 36,425.[93] 
Spectator numbers dropped since then and in 2013 average attendance fell 
below that of the leading domestic motor racing series International V8 
Supercars Championship. In 2010, the National Rugby League's premiership 
set a record for regular season attendance to NRL matches.[94] The Big 
Bash League was established in 2011. The first season attracted an average 
of 18,021 spectators per match. In the 2014-15 season, the average attendance 
for each match was 23,590 with the Adelaide Strikers attracting a record 
average home crowd of 36,023 spectators each game.[95][96] The 2015 Cricket 
World Cup final was played in front of 93,013 spectators, a record crowd 
for a day of cricket in Australia. Australia (Matches Played) Media coverage 
of Australian sport and athletes predates 1876. The first all Australian 
sport publication, The Referee, was first published in 1886 in Sydney.[102] 
The major newspapers for sport coverage in the country include the Herald 
Sun and The West Australian.[102] There is a long history of television 
coverage of sports in Australia. From 1957 to 2001, the Seven Network was 
the network for the Australian Football League. The only year that Seven 
was not the network for the league was in 1987 when the AFL was on the 
Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). An exclusive deal was agreed 
upon by Seven in 1976 for a five-year deal worth A$3 million.[103] World 
Series Cricket was a break away professional cricket competition staged 
between 1977 and 1979 and organised by Kerry Packer for his TV network, 
Nine. The matches ran in opposition to international cricket. It drastically 
changed the nature of cricket and its influence continues to be felt today.[104] 
Not all sports have had favourable deals with networks. The first television 
offer for the National Basketball League was worth A$1 in an offered made 
by Seven that the league accepted. The deal made by Ten Network to the 
New South Wales Rugby League was worth considerably more, worth A$48 million 
for a five-year deal that also included broadcasting rights for the State 
of Origin and the Australia national rugby league team. This deal was terminated 
early because the network could not afford to pay out.[105] The 1967 NSWRFL 
season's grand final became the first football grand final of any code 
to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network had paid $5,000 for 
the broadcasting rights.[106] SBS and FoxSports are two of the most important 
television networks in Australia in terms of covering all Australian sports, 
not just the popular professional leagues.[102] Administrators for less 
popular spectator sports, such as basketball and netball, believe that 
getting additional television and newspaper coverage is fundamental for 
the growth and success of their sports going forward.[102] Anti-siphoning 
laws in Australia regulate the media companies' access to significant sporting 
events. In 1992, when the country experienced growth in paid-subscription 
media, the Parliament of Australia enacted the Broadcasting Services Act 
that gave free-to-air broadcasters preferential access to acquire broadcasting 
rights to sporting events. The anti-siphoning list is a list of major sporting 
events that the Parliament of Australia has decided must be available for 
all Australians to see free of charge and cannot be "siphoned off" to pay 
TV where people are forced to pay to see them. The current anti-siphoning 
list came into effect in 2006 and expires 31 December 2010. The Minister 
for Communications can add or remove events from the list at his discretion. 
There are currently ten sports on the anti-siphoning list plus the Olympic 
and Commonwealth Games. Events on the anti-siphoning list are delisted 
12 weeks before they start to ensure pay TV broadcasters have reasonable 
access to listed events, if free-to-air broadcasters decide not to purchase 
the broadcast rights for a particular event. Any rights to listed sporting 
events that are not acquired by free-to-air broadcasters are available 
to pay TV. For multi-round events where it is simply not possible for free-to-air 
networks to broadcast all matches within the event (e.g. the Australian 
Open) complementary coverage is available on pay television. The Federal 
Government is obliged by legislation to conduct a review of the list before 
the end of 2009. The current anti-siphoning list requires showing listed 
sports on the broadcaster's main channel.[107] Rugby league, which includes 
NRL, State of Origin and national team matches, had the highest aggregate 
television ratings of any sport in 2009[108] and 2010.[109] Also, in a 
world first, the Nine Network broadcast free-to-air the first match of 
the 2010 State of Origin series live in 3D in New South Wales, Queensland 
and Victoria.[110][111] Cricket Australia announced an unprecedented $590 
million deal with free-to-air television networks Nine and Ten in 2013 
to broadcast the sport - a 118 per cent increase on the previous five-year 
contract.[112] BBL games are currently broadcast in Australia by the free-to-air 
Network Ten. In 2013 Ten paid $100 million for BBL rights over five years, 
marking the channel's first foray in elite cricket coverage.[113] Fox Sports 
had previously covered the Big Bash League. Network Ten’s BBL coverage 
has become a regular feature of Australian summers and last season attracted 
an average audience of more than 943,000 people nationally in 2014–15 season, 
including a peak audience of 1.9 million viewers for the final between 
the Perth Scorchers and Sydney Sixers.[114] There are a number of Australian 
sport films. They include The Club. The film was based on a play produced 
in 1977, in Melbourne. It has been in the senior English syllabi for four 
Australian states for many years.[115] The film was written by David Williamson, 
directed by Bruce Beresford and starring John Howard, Jack Thompson, Graham 
Kennedy and Frank Wilson.[116] Another Australian sport film is The Final 
Winter, released in 2007. It was directed by Brian Andrews and Jane Forrest 
and produced by Anthony Coffee, and Michelle Russell, while independently 
produced it is being distributed by Paramount Pictures. It was written 
by Matthew Nable who also starred as the lead role 'Grub' Henderson. The 
film, which earned praise from critics,[117] focuses around Grub who is 
the captain of the Newtown Jets football team in the early 1980s and his 
determination to stand for what rugby league traditionally stood for while 
dealing with his own identity crisis.[118] Other Australian sport films 
include Australian Rules and Footy Legends.[119][120] Sport is popular 
on the radio. This Sporting Life was a culturally iconic Triple J radio 
comedy program created by actor-writer comedians John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver, 
who performed as their characters Roy and HG. Broadcast from 1986 to 2008, 
it was one of the longest-running, most popular and most successful radio 
comedy programs of the post-television era in Australia. It was the longest-running 
show in Triple J's programming history and commanded a large and dedicated 
nationwide audience throughout its 22-year run.[121] 2KY is a commercial 
radio station based in Sydney, broadcasting throughout New South Wales 
and Canberra on a network of over 140 narrowcast transmitters as well as 
the main 1017 AM frequency in Sydney. 2KY broadcasts live commentary of 
thoroughbred, harness and greyhound racing. Over 1500 races are covered 
each week, including the pre and post race form and TAB betting information.[122] 
There are a number of Australian sport magazines. One is the AFL Record. 
The magazine is published in a sports magazine style format. Eight different 
versions, one for each game, are published for each weekly round, 60,000 
copies in total, and Roy Morgan Research estimates that the Record has 
a weekly readership of over 200,000.[123] As of 2009, the week's records 
are published and are able to be viewed in an online magazine format.[124] 
Another Australian sporting magazine is Australia's Surfing Life, a monthly 
magazine about surfing published in Australia. It features articles about 
surf trips in Australia and overseas, surfing technique, board design and 
wetsuits. The magazine was founded in 1985.[125] Australia participate 
in many international competitions, such as the Olympics, Commonwealth 
Games, Cricket World Cup, Rugby World Cup, Rugby League World Cup, FIFA 
World Cup, the Basketball World Cup for both men and women, Netball World 
Cup and the Hockey World Cup. The Australian national cricket team have 
participated in every edition of the Cricket World Cup. Australia have 
been very successful in the event, winning the tournament five times, the 
record number.[126] The Australian national Rugby league team have also 
participated in every edition of the Rugby League World Cup. Australia 
have been very successful in the event, winning the tournament 10 times, 
the record number.[127] The Australian national Rugby union team have participated 
in every Rugby World Cup. Australia have been very successful in the tournament, 
winning it two times[128] despite it not being a major sport in Australia. 
Australia's women have repeatedly won at the highest level. The Australian 
national netball team have won the Netball World Cup a record 11 times.[129] 
The Australian women's national cricket team have won the Women's Cricket 
World Cup a record five times.[130] The Australian women's national field 
hockey team have won the Gold Medal at the Olympics and the Women's Hockey 
World Cup three and two times respectively.[131][132] The Australia women's 
national basketball team, known as the Opals, regularly compete well against 
the world elite at the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, having won the 
event in 2006 and finishing third three times, and at the Summer Olympics 
Basketball Tournament, where they have won silver medals three times and 
bronze medals twice.[133] The Socceroos have appeared at the FIFA World 
Cup in 1974, 2006, 2010 and 2014. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Socceroos 
surprised many by reaching the Round of 16, losing 1–0 in injury time to 
the eventual champions, Italy.[134] They also hold the unusual distinction 
of having won continental soccer championships of two confederations - 
Oceania's OFC Nations Cup four times between 1980 and 2004 and, after moving 
to the Asian Football Confederation in 2005, the AFC Asian Cup in 2015. 
The Australia women's national soccer team, the Matildas, have appeared 
in all FIFA Women's World Cups except the first in 1991. They have advanced 
past the group stage in each of the last three of the competition (2007, 
2011 and 2015), losing in the quarter-finals each time. In 2015, they became 
the first senior Australian national team of either sex to win a World 
Cup knockout stage match, specifically in the round of 16, newly instituted 
for the Women's World Cup in that year. The Matildas have also enjoyed 
success at the AFC Women's Asian Cup, advancing at least to the semi-finals 
in all four competitions since joining the AFC in 2006 and winning in 2010. 
Australia has also hosted a number of major international sporting events, 
including the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2000 Summer Olympics. The country 
also regularly hosts a major tennis Grand Slam event, the Australian Open, 
an FIA Formula One World Championship round (Australian Grand Prix), motorcycle 
Moto GP round (Australian motorcycle Grand Prix), as well as rounds of 
the Superbike World Championship, World Rally Championship alongside major 
domestically created, internationally recognised events including the Melbourne 
Cup and the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.[38] Australia has hosted the 1992 
Cricket World Cup and the 2015 Cricket World Cup along with New Zealand.[126] 
The 2015 Cricket World Cup generated more than A$1.1 billion in direct 
spending, created the equivalent of 8,320 full-time jobs, and had a total 
of 2 million bed nights across the two host countries.[135] Australia has 
also hosted the 2003 Rugby World Cup, with the event generating around 
A$1 billion in economic activity while bringing in 2 million visitors to 
the country.[136] The 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England was the first 
tour by any sports team from Australia.[137] [138] The Olympic movement 
in Australia started out during the 1900s and 1910s in Australia. The first 
organisations for the Olympics in Australia came out of the athletics governance 
system and resulted in the creation of state based Olympic committees. 
The first national governing body for Australian Olympics was created in 
1914 and was a joint effort with New Zealand though New Zealand was a less 
than able partner. The movement in Australia then stagnated as a result 
of the Great War. The New Zealand and Australian organisation was disbanded 
and an Australian only national organisation was founded in 1920 called 
the Australian Olympic Federation. The early goals of the organisation 
were to ratify team selection and to fundraise to assist Olympians in paying 
for their travel to compete at the Games. By the 1980s, the organisation 
had issues on the international level as the IOC wanted them to re-structure; 
until this time, the organisation followed governance models similar to 
that of other Australian sporting organisations with a federated model 
of governance. Changes were made the organisation ended up with an executive 
board with a president, two vice presidents, a secretary general and a 
14-member executive board which had 10 elected members, 4 IOC members and 
2 members of the Athlete's Commission.[139] Australia has hosted the Olympics 
twice, in 1956 in Melbourne and in 2000 in Sydney. These were the first 
Games hosted in the southern hemisphere.[140][141][142] Australia has been 
active influential in the Olympic movement, with four Australian representatives 
who are members of the International Olympic Committee.[139] The government 
has provided monetary support for the Olympics. In the lead up to the 1924 
Games, they provided 3,000 pounds and in 1936 provided 2,000 pounds. This 
support was seen as a way of supporting national identity, but no formal 
system existed for the funding wider sport at the time.[143] The 1956 Games 
were the first time Australia had an Equestrian competitor when Victorian 
Ernie Barker competed.[142] Australia has generally been a world power 
in Olympic swimming since the 1956 Melbourne Olympics: swimmers like Shane 
Gould, Dawn Fraser, Ian Thorpe and Kieren Perkins have taken multiple gold 
medals.[144] Australia performed relatively poorly at the 1976 Summer Olympics. 
This upset the nation as it challenged a fundamental part of Australian 
identity. The following Olympics, the 1980 Summer Olympics, some Australian 
sports sat out as part of a boycott[48][145] and the country earned only 
nine medals, two of them gold, in Moscow.[146] To prevent a recurrence 
of this, the Australian Institute of Sport was created to help improve 
Australia's medal tally at the Games.[146][145] Channel Seven had exclusive 
Australian free-to-air, pay television, online and mobile telephone broadcast 
rights to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The live telecast of the 
2008 Summer Olympics was shared by the Seven Network and SBS Television. 
Seven broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies and mainstream sports, 
including swimming, athletics, rowing, cycling and gymnastics. In contrast, 
SBS TV provided complementary coverage focused on long-form events such 
as soccer, road cycling, volleyball and table tennis.[147] Australia has 
attended every Summer Paralympics and hosted the 2000 Sydney Games. Australia 
sent a delegation of 170 athletes to compete at the 2008 Summer Paralympics 
in Beijing,[148] and a team of 11 competitors to compete in two disciplines 
at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver, Canada.[149] A team of 161 
members was sent to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.[150] Australians 
take the Commonwealth Games seriously because, on one level of national 
thinking, the event offers the country an opportunity to prove they are 
superior to the "original country", the United Kingdom.[19][151][152][153] 
By the 1938 British Empire Games, Australia's combined medal total was 
already greater than that of the Home Nations tallies combined. Australia 
would go on to beat England in total medals at the Commonwealth Games in 
1950, 1962, 1970, 1974 and 1982.[19] This rivalry with England continues
