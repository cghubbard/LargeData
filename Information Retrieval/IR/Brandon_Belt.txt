Brandon Kyle Belt (born April 20, 1988) is an American professional baseball 
first baseman for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He made his MLB debut during the 2011 season. He was a member of the 2012 
World Series and 2014 World Series championship teams with the Giants. 
Belt has also filled in at left field for the Giants. Belt attended Hudson 
High School in Hudson, Texas. The Boston Red Sox selected Belt in the 11th 
round (343rd overall) of the 2006 MLB Draft as a pitcher, but chose not 
to give him the signing bonus that would make him forgo his college commitment.[1] 
Belt enrolled at San Jacinto College in order to preserve his ability to 
negotiate with Boston, but eventually chose not to sign. He pitched for 
San Jacinto's baseball team in 2007 and was drafted in the 11th round (348th 
overall) of the 2007 MLB Draft by the Atlanta Braves, but again chose not 
to sign.[2] Belt transferred to the University of Texas, where he played 
college baseball for the Texas Longhorns for two years. In his 2008 sophomore 
season, Belt batted .319 with six home runs and a team-high 65 RBI while 
also pitching in 16 games as a reliever.[3] As a junior, Belt transitioned 
to first base due to shoulder problems.[1] In 2009, during his junior season, 
Belt batted .323 in 63 games (76-for-235) with eight home runs, 43 RBI, 
and 15 stolen bases, while recording a .989 fielding percentage as part 
of the Texas team that finished as runners-up in the College World Series.[3] 
The San Francisco Giants selected Belt in the fifth round (147th overall) 
of the 2009 MLB Draft after his junior year. He started his professional 
career with the High-A Giants affiliate in San Jose. He worked with the 
Giants coaching staff and made an adjustment to his swing mechanics that 
helped him move quickly through the Giants farm system. He hit well at 
all three levels in 2010 finishing the year with a .352 batting average 
and gaining attention as one of the Giants top prospects.[4] In 2010, he 
played for the San Francisco Giants Class-AAA-affiliate Fresno Grizzlies. 
He also played for the East Division Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona 
Fall League. Belt played in the Arizona Fall League Rising Stars Game for 
the East team. He was ranked as the third-best first baseman prospect on 
MLB.com prior to the 2011 season.[5] He was ranked as the 26th-best prospect 
overall by MLB.com.[6] After his strong showing in the minor leagues, Belt 
was invited to spring training in 2011,[7] where he played in 28 exhibition 
games, the most on the team, and batted .282 with 3 home runs.[8] On March 
30, 2011, the Giants announced that Belt had been named to the opening 
day Major League roster,[9][10] a moment captured in the series premier 
of The Franchise.[11] He started in his first major league game the next 
day and singled off of Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw in his 
first major league at bat,[8] finishing 1-for-3 with a walk.[12] Belt hit 
his first major league home run on April 1, 2011, off Chad Billingsley.[13] 
On April 20, Belt was optioned to Triple-A Fresno to make room on the roster 
for Cody Ross. He was hitting .192 in 17 games.[14] Belt was recalled to 
the Giants on May 26 after injuries to Buster Posey and Darren Ford.[15] 
On June 4, Belt was diagnosed with a hairline fracture, and was sent to 
the 15-day DL after being hit by a pitch in a game against the St. Louis 
Cardinals.[16] On July 7, Belt was removed from the DL and optioned back 
to Fresno to continue his rehab assignment.[17] On July 19, Belt was recalled 
to the Giants to give slumping first baseman Aubrey Huff a break. In his 
first game back in the majors, Belt hit a solo home run and a tiebreaking 
two-run double in the seventh inning to help the Giants defeat the Dodgers.[18] 
On August 4, Belt was optioned back to Fresno to make room on the roster 
for Mark DeRosa.[19] On August 14, one day after being called up to the 
majors for a fourth time, Belt hit two home runs in a 5–2 victory over 
the Florida Marlins in Miami. It was the first multi home run game of his 
career.[20] In August 2011, Belt was given the nickname "The Baby Giraffe" 
by Giants KNBR announcer Duane Kuiper, who commented that Belt looked like 
the animal while tracking down a fly ball in left field during a game against 
the Milwaukee Brewers.[21] The nickname stuck and Belt became a fan favorite 
in San Francisco, with "Baby Giraffe" hats rivaling the number of "Panda" 
hats in the stands at AT&T Park in September 2011 (the panda hats are a 
reference to former Giants star Pablo Sandoval, sometimes called "the Kung-Fu 
Panda"). Six Flags Discovery Kingdom named a real baby giraffe born in 
August after Belt.[22] Belt made the Giants' opening day roster for 2012.[23] 
Belt split time at first base with Aubrey Huff and Brett Pill at the beginning 
of the season.[24] After Huff was injured and Pill struggled at the plate, 
Belt became the everyday first baseman and finished the season strong, 
hitting .328 from July 24 to the end of the season.[25] In the 2012 NLCS, 
Belt hit .304 (7-for-23) in six games with a .565 slugging percentage. 
On October 28, 2012, Belt won his first World Series ring when the Giants 
swept the Detroit Tigers. Belt played a key part of the Giants' clinching 
game in the World Series, starting the scoring by hitting a triple to right 
field in the second inning, scoring Hunter Pence from second.[26] Belt 
set new career highs in 2013, batting .289 with 17 home runs and 67 RBIs 
in 150 games, and he led the Giants with an .841 OPS. Belt got off to a 
slow start after losing 11 pounds to an opening-week stomach virus, but 
finished strong, batting .346 over the season's final 51 games.[2] Belt 
credited his improvement to changing his grip and moving back in the batter's 
box.[2] Belt was named National League Player of the Week for August 5–11 
after collecting hits in all seven games played, while batting .440 (11-for-25) 
with five RBIs, 20 total bases, two home runs, and eight runs scored.[27] 
On February 1, 2014, Belt signed a one-year $2.9 million contract to avoid 
arbitration.[28] On May 9, while batting at Dodger Stadium, Belt was hit 
on his left thumb by Dodgers pitcher Paul Maholm, suffering a broken thumb.[29] 
Belt was activated from the disabled list on July 4,[30] only to return 
to the disabled list on July 21 after suffering a concussion while fielding 
during batting practice.[31] Belt was activated August 2, but was placed 
on the DL again August 8 when his concussion symptoms continued.[32] Belt 
was reactivated from the disabled list on September 15.[33] In the 2014 
postseason, Belt batted .295 (18-for-61) with 8 RBI and 11 walks in 17 
games. In Game 2 of the 2014 NLDS versus the Washington Nationals, Belt 
hit a solo home run in the top of the 18th inning to break a 1–1 tie, helping 
the Giants to an eventual 3–1 series win.[34] On October 29, 2014, Belt 
won his second World Series ring when the Giants defeated the Kansas City 
Royals in seven games. Belt, along with teammate Hunter Pence, hit safely 
in all seven games of the series, the only players on either team to do 
so.[35] On February 3, 2015, Belt and the Giants avoided arbitration by 
agreeing to a one-year, $3.6 million contract.[36] On May 17th, Belt accomplished 
a rare feat when he collected 3 hits, including a home run, for 3 games 
in a row against the Cincinnati Reds. He was only the second Giants player 
to do so since 1900. Barry Bonds had a similar three-game streak in 2000. 
Belt recorded another unusual statistic since he hit the home runs on 3 
consecutive days after not hitting any in his first 30 games. The last 
player to have done so was also Belt in the 2012 season when he hit home 
runs in 3 consecutive games after not hitting any in his first 48 games 
that season.[37] For the season, Belt appeared in 137 games, batting .280/.356/.478, 
and set new career-highs with 18 home runs and 68 RBIs.[38] On February 
10, 2016, Belt and the Giants agreed to a one-year, $6.2 million contract 
to avoid arbitration.[39] On April 9, 2016, Belt and the Giants agreed 
to a 5-year, $72.8 million contact extension through 2021. After winning 
the 2016 National League All-Star Final Vote, Belt was selected to his 
first All Star Game.[40] In 2016, Belt led all Giants batters with 104 
walks, 17 home runs, a .394 on-base percentage, and .868 OPS.[41] Belt 
became the first Giant to record 100 walks in a season since Barry Bonds 
in 2007.[42] Belt married high school sweetheart Haylee Stephenson on December 
3, 2010, in their hometown of Lufkin, Texas.[43] They have one son.[44]
