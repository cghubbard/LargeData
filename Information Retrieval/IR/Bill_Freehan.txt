William Ashley Freehan (born November 29, 1941)[1] is a former catcher 
in Major League Baseball who played his entire 15-year career with the 
Detroit Tigers. The premier catcher in the American League for several 
years from the 1960s into the early 1970s, he was named an All-Star in 
each of the eleven seasons in which he caught at least 75 games, and was 
the MVP runnerup with the 1968 champions for his handling of a pitching 
staff that included Mickey Lolich and Denny McLain, who became the first 
30-game winner in the majors since 1934. A five-time Gold Glove Award winner,[2] 
Freehan held the major league record for highest career fielding percentage 
(.9933) until 2002, and also the records for career putouts (9,941) and 
total chances (10,734) from 1975 until the late 1980s;[3] he ranked ninth 
in major league history in games caught (1,581) at the end of his career. 
His career totals of 200 home runs and 2,502 total bases placed him behind 
only Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey among AL catchers when he retired. Freehan 
attended the University of Michigan, where he set an all-time Big Ten Conference 
batting mark of .585 in 1961 and also played football.[4] He signed with 
his hometown Tigers in 1961 for a $100,000 bonus, which his father withheld 
until he graduated in 1966, and broke in briefly with 4 games at the end 
of the season before returning to the minors in 1962.[5] In 1963 he arrived 
in the majors to stay, working with former catcher Rick Ferrell on his 
defense and splitting catching duties with Gus Triandos, who was traded 
following the season. The 1964 campaign gave indications of what was to 
come; he batted .300 to finish sixth in the American League (AL), along 
with 18 home runs and 80 runs batted in.[6] He also earned the first of 
ten consecutive All-Star selections, and placed seventh in the Most Valuable 
Player Award balloting.[7] In 1965 he led the AL in putouts for the first 
of six times, and received his first of his five consecutive Gold Gloves. 
In 1966 he again led the league in putouts, and also led in fielding percentage 
for the first of four times. 1967 was his best season yet, as he batted 
.282 – ninth in the AL as averages hit an all-time low – with 20 home runs, 
and broke Elston Howard's 1964 AL single-season records with 950 putouts 
and 1,021 total chances. Freehan led the league in both intentional walks 
and times hit by pitch, and finished third in the MVP voting after Detroit 
came within one game of the Boston Red Sox for the AL pennant.[8][9] He 
had an even better year in 1968 as he was considered the quiet leader of 
the 1968 World Series championship squad, posting career highs with 25 
home runs and 84 RBI, fifth and sixth in the AL respectively.[10] Freehan 
broke his own records with 971 putouts and 1,050 total chances, marks which 
remained league records until Dan Wilson topped them with the 1997 Seattle 
Mariners. He was also hit by 24 pitches, the most in the AL since Kid Elberfeld 
in 1911. Despite playing in hitter-friendly Tiger Stadium, Freehan guided 
the Tigers' pitching staff to an earned run average of 2.71, third best 
in the league.[11] McLain won 31 games and Lolich won 17 as the Tigers 
ran away with the pennant. Because of his offensive and defensive contributions, 
he finished second to McLain in the MVP voting.[12] Freehan and Carl Yastrzemski 
were the only players to finish in the top ten of the voting in both 1967 
and 1968, and only Yastrzemski reached base more often in 1968. He capped 
his season by recording the final out of the World Series against the St. 
Louis Cardinals, retiring Tim McCarver on a popup. He also made a pivotal 
play in Game 5, with the Cardinals leading the Series 3-1 and the game 
3-2.[13] In the fifth inning, Lou Brock – whom Freehan had thrown out on 
an attempted steal in the third inning – doubled with one out and attempted 
to score on Julián Javier's single, but Freehan successfully blocked the 
plate with his foot, and held on to the ball even though Brock came in 
standing up in an attempt to knock the ball loose. Detroit won by scoring 
three runs in the seventh inning, and went on to take the last two games.[14] 
Although his later seasons rarely approached the brilliance of those two 
campaigns, he continued to turn out All-Star years for the Tigers. In 1971 
he batted .277 with 21 home runs, and he hit .262 for the 1972 Eastern 
Division champions. He missed the first two games (both losses) of the 
1972 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics 
while recovering from a hairline fracture of his thumb, then doubled and 
homered in a 3-0 Game 3 win, in which Joe Coleman set a League Championship 
Series record with 14 strikeouts.[15] Freehan drove in the first of three 
runs in the tenth inning of Game 4 in a memorable 4-3 come-from-behind 
victory which tied the series;[16] he also drove in Detroit's only run 
in the 2-1 Game 5 loss.[17] In 1974, playing primarily at first base, he 
finished fifth in the American League in slugging average with a .479 mark.[18] 
He moved back behind the plate the following year to earn his eleventh 
All-Star berth. Freehan ended his career in 1976, batting .270. In his 
15-year career, Freehan played in 1,774 games with 1,591 hits in 6,073 
at bats for a .262 batting average along with 241 doubles, 200 home runs, 
758 RBI, and a .340 on-base percentage.[1] In addition to his home runs 
and total bases, his .412 slugging average and totals of 1,591 hits, 706 
runs and 476 extra base hits all put him among the top five AL catchers 
to that time. His batting totals are particularly remarkable in light of 
the fact that offense was at a low throughout the sport during his career, 
with a decided advantage toward pitchers. Freehan led all AL catchers in 
fielding percentage four times (1965, 1966, 1970, 1973).[19] He also ranked 
sixth in American League history with 114 times being hit by a pitch. Freehan 
caught more games than any other player in Tigers' team history.[20] In 
his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian 
Bill James ranked Freehan 12th all-time among major league catchers.[21] 
Freehan held the major league record for highest career fielding percentage 
(.9933) until 2002, when Dan Wilson broke his record. In 1973 and 1974 
he surpassed Yogi Berra to become the AL's all-time leader in putouts and 
total chances; he broke Johnny Roseboro's major league marks in 1975. Bob 
Boone broke his major league mark of 10,734 career total chances in 1987, 
and Gary Carter surpassed his putouts total of 9,941 in 1988;[22][23] Carlton 
Fisk broke his AL records in 1989 (total chances) and 1990 (putouts).[24] 
Freehan caught 114 shutouts during his career, ranking him 18th all-time 
among major league catchers.[25] In 1969, Freehan penned "Behind the Mask", 
a diary-type recording of his thoughts and experiences as seen from the 
catcher's perspective.[26] After retiring, he coached Tigers catcher Lance 
Parrish on the fine points of playing his position. In 1978, Freehan was 
one of seven members of the inaugural class of inductees to the University 
of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. He served as a color commentator for 
Seattle Mariners broadcasts in 1979–80, and for Tigers broadcasts on PASS 
Sports television in 1984–85, and returned to the University of Michigan
