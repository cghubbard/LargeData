The Oakland Athletics' 1988 season involved the A's winning their first 
American League West title since 1981, with a record of 104 wins and 58 
losses. In 1988, the elephant was restored as the symbol of the Athletics 
and currently adorns the left sleeve of home and road uniforms. The elephant 
was retired as team mascot in 1963 by then-owner Charles O. Finley in favor 
of a Missouri mule. The A's defeated the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS, but 
lost the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games, including 
a dramatic, classic walk-off home run by the Dodgers' Kirk Gibson in game 
one. 1988 was the first of 3 straight years the A's would represent the 
AL in the World Series Jos√© Canseco led the American League with 42 Home 
Runs, 124 RBIs and a .569 slugging percentage. Canseco became the first 
member of the Athletics to have three straight 100 RBI seasons. [1] [2]
