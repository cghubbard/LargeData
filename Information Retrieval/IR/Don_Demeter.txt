Donald Lee "Don" Demeter (born June 25, 1935) is a former outfielder, third 
baseman, and first baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the 
Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, Detroit Tigers, 
Boston Red Sox, and Cleveland Indians. He batted and threw right-handed.[1] 
From September 1962 to July 1965, Demeter had 266 consecutive errorless 
games in the outfield, a Major League record that would stand for almost 
30 years until Darren Lewis broke the mark in 1994 with 369.[2] Don Demeter 
is a member of The Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame.[3] In 1945, Demeter started 
his life in baseball when he joined the Oklahoma City YMCA Junior League.[4] 
In Demeter's senior year at Capital Hill High School, his team won 59 games 
of 60.[3] They went on to win the 1953 Oklahoma state title.[4] After graduation, 
the New York Yankees signed two members of the team, while the Brooklyn 
Dodgers signed Don and eight of his teammates.[3] He was signed by Dodgers 
scout Bert Wells.[5] While his classmates each received a $3,000 signing 
bonus, Demeter was given only $800.[3][6] Demeter was the only member of 
the Capitol Hill High School starting varsity team that was not chosen 
to be on the Oklahoma City all-star prep team, yet he would be the only 
player to go on to be a success in the Major Leagues.[4] By 1959, Don was 
the only remaining Capital Hill High alumni of 11 that was still in professional 
organized baseball in any capacity.[7] As a stepping stone to professional 
baseball, in the early 1950s Demeter played ball for the American Legion's 
Mosier's Tiremen of Oklahoma City.[8] After signing with the Dodgers, Don 
was assigned to the Minor League Class D Sooner State League Shawnee Hawks.[9] 
For his first season of professional baseball, he was paid a salary of 
$150 a month.[4] In 104 games for the Hawks, Don had a .223 batting average 
to go with 9 home runs, 6 triples, and 42 RBI.[1][10] After the disappointing 
season, Demeter said, "I don't enjoy baseball. I'm not sure I should continue 
it", feeling that he was living a more useful life. His passion for the 
game was reinvigorated though after the 1954 World Series. "But when I 
saw Alvin Dark tithed the church from his 1954 World Series share, I realized 
that baseball could have a very real meaning.".[11] For the 1954 season, 
Don was promoted to the Class C California League Bakersfield Indians, 
where he hit .267 with 26 home runs and 89 RBI.[1][10] In December 1954, 
Demeter decided to put in some extra playing time and experience by going 
to Venezuela and playing for team Cabimas.[12] In the 33 game loop, Don 
hit .306 with 15 RBI, half of which came from two grand slams over the 
course of the season.[13][14] He began the 1955 season with the Class A 
Pueblo Dodgers of 1955 Pueblo Western League. He impressed early, hitting 
.262 with 5 home runs and 23 RBI in 39 games before being promoted to the 
Class AA Southern Association Mobile Bears. In 92 games at Mobile, Don 
hit .251 with 11 home runs and 36 RBI.[1][10] Don rejoined Cabimas for 
winter league play in the 1955–56 Venezuelan Occidental League.[15] Demeter 
set the pace early in the league, hitting for a .433 average with 7 home 
runs and 12 RBI in his first 60 at bats.[16] On January 21, 1956, Demeter 
tied a Venezuela national record by hitting 16 home runs in a season, hitting 
two in one game.[17] Demeter finished the winter-ball season second in 
the league in batting average with a .369 mark and tied for first in home 
runs with 17, compiling 73 hits and 38 runs scored in 52 games.[18] Demeter 
continued his Venezuelan power surge back in the States for the AA Texas 
League Fort Worth Cats. Don went on a tear in the 1956 season. He hit home 
runs on four consecutive days from April 24 to 27, and six in his last 
seven games, a new league record.[19] On May 20, he had a 5 hit day that 
included his 10th home run of the season in a 17–4 victory over San Antonio.[20] 
Don finished the year with 41 home runs and 128 RBI, both second only to 
minor league journeyman Ken Guettler, who had 143 runs batted in and shattered 
the Texas League record for home runs with 62.[21] He also was very busy 
in center field for the Cats, leading the league in putouts with 442.[1][10] 
Demeter was selected to the Texas League All-Star Team, receiving a scroll 
and a $100 check.[22] Fort Worth General Manager Spencer Harris compared 
him to an all-time great, saying, "He's ahead of Duke Snider at a similar 
stage in Duke's development."[23] Don played his first major league game 
on September 18, 1956, pinch hitting in the bottom of the 3rd inning for 
pitcher Roger Craig. He struck out against St. Louis Cardinals hurler Vinegar 
Bend Mizell, taking all three strikes looking.[1][24] Mizell and Demeter 
later became very close Christian friends.[25] Don got over his rookie 
jitters the next day against the Cards, hitting a 2-1 pitch off Don Liddle 
into the left field stands to contribute to a 17-2 victory.[24] Demeter 
finished the season 1 for 3.[1] He didn't compete for the Dodgers in the 
1956 World Series, but did join the team for a playing tour through Japan.[26] 
In the 18 game series, the Dodgers went 14-4 with Demeter hitting above 
.300 and five home runs, just one behind the team leaders Gil Hodges and 
Duke Snider.[27] During the tour, Dodgers Vice President Buzzie Bavasi 
named Demeter as one of the stars ready for the Majors. The Dodgers were 
offered $750,000 for Demeter and five other prospects, but the offer was 
turned down.[28] On November 2, Bavasi announced that Demeter would be 
one of the prospects invited to an early tryout training camp at Vero Beach, 
Florida the next February.[29] National League president Warren Giles gave 
Don very high praise, saying that he, "should make the grade as a regular 
with the Dodgers next season. He played outstanding ball in Japan."[30] 
Brooklyn President Walter O'Malley announced during the Japan tour his 
plans to move Duke Snider over to left field to make room for Demeter in 
center.[31] Before the 1957 season, Demeter was rated as one of the top 
8 rookie prospects in February in a poll conducted by 12 major league organizations.[32] 
On January 12, he signed his contract to play with the Dodgers for the 
year.[33] In an exhibition rematch of last year's World Series, the Dodgers 
beat the New York Yankees 1-0 in 11 innings after Demeter hit a double 
and later in the inning scored on a wild throw by Gil McDougald as he ran 
to third.[34] Overall, Don failed to impress during spring training and 
was cut by the Dodgers on March 31 and subsequently optioned to the AAA 
St. Paul Saints of the American Association.[35][36] Don started the season 
very strong, hitting .350 with 35 RBI and a league-leading 12 home runs 
through June 5.[37] On July 4, Demeter helped his team improbably overcome 
an 8-1 deficit by hitting three home runs to help the Saints beat the Minneapolis 
Millers 9-8.[38] Two days later, he was selected to the American Association 
all-star team on July 6, 1957.[39] He was one of only four unanimous picks 
by the league's broadcasters and writers.[40] On July 14, Demeter had to 
leave a game after severely pulling a tendon in his left hand.[41] Still 
hurt, Don returned on August 2 to pinch hit a game-winning double in the 
10th inning to beat Louisville 3-2.[42] However, the injury still severely 
limited Demeter's play all the way to September.[43] By season's end, Demeter's 
numbers were down from last year, but still highly productive. His 28 home 
runs were good enough for 3rd in the league, he was 5th in OPS with a mark 
of .940, 3rd in steals with 13, and 3rd in slugging percentage at .562.[44] 
Don finished the season with 86 RBI and a .309 batting average in 134 games.[1] 
He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show on September 29 after being voted to 
the all AAA team. Dodger VP Bavasi recalled Demeter from St. Paul after 
his minor league team was eliminated from the Association playoffs, but 
once he learned that Don was one of the players selected to the team, he 
told Demeter to go to Hollywood instead.[45] At the start of the 1958 season, 
The Sporting News listed Demeter as the "kid with greatest potential", 
and "best bet for batting title", titles for the newly relocated Los Angeles 
Dodgers.[46] After serving a six-month term with the Army in San Antonio, 
Texas, Demeter was discharged on April 17, 1958 and left to immediately 
join the Dodgers in Los Angeles.[47] Playing time was initially scarce 
for him, only playing in 6 games before being optioned back to the AAA 
St. Paul Saints on May 9.[48] In 80 games with St. Paul, Demeter hit .283 
with 14 home runs and 48 RBI.[1] Demeter was recalled to the majors by 
the Dodgers on July 30.[49] To make room for him on the roster, Randy Jackson 
was sold to the Cleveland Indians for $20,000.[50] Don struggled in his 
first full month as a regular Major Leaguer. In the month of August, he 
hit just .148 with 1 home run and 2 RBI in 54 at bats. Demeter started 
to get more comfortable in mid-September, hitting .263 with 4 homers in 
his final 12 games. Don finished his rollercoaster short season for the 
Dodgers with a .189 batting average, 5 home runs, and 8 RBI in 43 games.[1] 
Don signed a new contract with the Dodgers on February 16, 1959 for $8,500.[51][52] 
At the Dodgers camp in Vero Beach, Florida, Demeter took the time to try 
to reinvent himself as a hitter. He was always going for the home run swing, 
which resulted in 32 strikeouts in just 106 at bats last season. Manager 
Walter Alston and new coach Pee Wee Reese would be his teachers. Reese 
stated that Don was upper-cutting at the ball with each swing, and Pee 
Wee had him cut down on his swing, which led to immediate results. Alston 
had Demeter stand outside the batting cage and hit ground balls to the 
infielders while waiting for his turn in the cage. Don and Alston agreed 
that the simple exercise helped level off Demeter's swing.[6] While adapting 
his new batting style, Demeter injured himself on February 27 by pulling 
a muscle in his right leg.[53] It was not serious, and Demeter returned 
to spring training play in less than a week. On March 12, he had a game-winning 
single with the bases loaded against the Cincinnati Reds in the 9th inning 
to give the Dodgers the 7-6 win.[54] The Dodgers finally carried out their 
original plan for Demeter for the most part, set all the way back in September 
1956.[31] He became the new starter in center field, while Duke Snider 
was moved over to right field. Don had a very successful spring training 
and was expected to be the opening day starting centerfielder against the 
Chicago Cubs, but instead he rode the bench for the duration of the game. 
The next day, Duke Snider's lingering knee problems came back, and Demeter 
was given his first start of the season with the temperature around 40 
degrees Fahrenheit. The new and improved Don Demeter made the best first 
impression he could, hitting a home run and a single while driving in two 
runs en route to a 5-3 win. Snider started the next game, the series opener 
against the St. Louis Cardinals.[6] In his second start the next day, Don 
hit another homer. The next day, another home run. In just three starts, 
Don already had three home runs and six runs batted in.[1] Demeter was 
only just getting started with his April tear.[6] On April 21 against the 
San Francisco Giants, he hit three home runs and had six RBI in a single 
game. In the 3rd inning off Giants pitcher Dom Zanni, Demeter hit the first 
ever inside-the-park home run at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The next 
inning saw another home run, this time off Mike McCormick and to deep left. 
Demeter capped off the performance by hitting a game winning walk-off two-run 
home run in the bottom of the 11th inning off Al Worthington to win the 
game 9-7.[6] It was the only game of his career where Don had an inside-the-park 
or walk-off home run.[1] Don was the first Dodger to hit three home runs 
in a single game since Snider did it four years prior on June 1, 1955 at 
Ebbets Field.[7] As of July 2009, only 22 players in the history of the 
majors since 1900 had three home runs in a single game during their rookie 
season. Demeter was the 1st Dodger and 9th overall to accomplish the feat, 
sharing the accomplishment with hall-of-famers Eddie Mathews and Mickey 
Cochrane.[55] The next morning, a photographer got Demeter out of bed at 
5 in the morning to take photos for an afternoon Los Angeles newspaper.[6][7] 
In Don's first 15 games, he hit .345 with 6 home runs and 21 RBI,[1] challenging 
early for the NL's rare triple crown title.[56] On Demeter's early success, 
Philadelphia Phillies manager Eddie Sawyer remarked, "Seldom have I seen 
a player come so far so fast. When I saw him for the first time late last 
season, he was just another journeyman. Now he's a real good-looking ball 
player."[6] Demeter had another multiple home run game in an 11-0 win over 
the Phillies.[57] Don's bat eventually slowed down, but he still had well 
above average numbers for the months of May and June, hitting a combined 
.278 with 10 home runs and 34 RBI. Once summer hit its full stride, however, 
Don countered his three-month offensive production with two months of offensive 
despair, hitting below .160 in both months and having only 2 home runs.[1] 
The bad luck reached its height on August 18 when he dropped an "easy" 
pop fly against the Milwaukee Braves in the bottom of the 9th inning. The 
Braves tied the game, but the Dodgers later won it 7-6 in 13 innings.[58] 
Demeter attempted to stop the tying run from coming home, but the catcher 
had thought the game was over. He said later, "When I threw it to home 
plate, it was a perfect strike. But there was nobody there to catch it, 
because (Johnny) Roseboro was out at the mound congratulating (Don) Drysdale 
on the victory."[59] On the bus ride to the hotel, Demeter shook every 
one of his teammate's hands, showing his appreciation for "the team's win". 
At season's end they were tied with the Braves for the National League 
pennant. They won the playoff and a berth in the World Series. Demeter 
later said, "My error could have lost us the World Championship."[60] Don 
finished the regular season with 18 home runs and 70 RBI in 139 games. 
He was hit by 6 pitches, good enough for 4th in the National League. He 
also had the 5th highest fielding percentage at center field with a mark 
of .983. His strikeout numbers were high, coming in 7th in the NL with 
87.[1] Don played in all six games of the 1959 World Series for the Dodgers. 
He replaced Duke Snider late in the first two games, started the next three, 
and came off the bench once more in the decisive game six. In 12 at bats, 
Don hit .250 with 2 runs scored.[1] Demeter tithed his World Series earnings 
to his church.[25] Early in the offseason, there were talks of trading 
Demeter. Near the end of November, there was a six player offer between 
Los Angeles and the Washington Senators, where Washington wanted Don in 
place of Sandy Amorós.[61] The Dodgers were reluctant to lose their 24-year-old 
hitter, offering outfielder Ron Fairly to the Senators in Demeter's stead. 
Washington continued to hold out on the trade for Demeter until Los Angeles 
officially killed the deal on December 2.[62] The Dodgers had confidence 
in Don, believing that he was beginning to overcome the many weakness in 
his hitting game that plagued him in previous seasons.[63] Demeter signed 
a $14,000 one-year contract with Los Angeles on February 11, 1960.[52][64] 
Coming into training camp, team management was pleased that he gained 12 
pounds in the offseason, raising his total weight to 185 pounds.[65] In 
an intrasquad game on March 11 at Vero Beach, Don hit a home run off eventual 
Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax.[66] On April 12, Demeter had his first opening 
day start in the Major Leagues.[67] He started the majority of the team's 
games until July 3, where he fractured his wrist on the road against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates after colliding with Los Angeles shortstop Maury Wills, 
prematurely ending Don's season.[68] In the shortened year, he hit .274 
with 9 home runs and 29 RBI in 64 games.[1] Of all the players on the Dodgers 
roster, general manager Bavasi believed that the key Dodger of the upcoming 
1961 season was Demeter, expecting Don to make a large comeback after his 
disappointing outing last season. "If Don can show us the Demeter of early 
1959, we won't have to look for added power. We'll have all we need."[69] 
It was announced on February 14, 1961, that Demeter had signed his new 
yearly contract with the Dodgers for around $16,000.[70][71] However, Don 
would have stiff competition to regain his starting role in center field. 
Newcomer Willie Davis, coming off a huge season in the Pacific Coast League 
and last season's number one player of the year as named by The Sporting 
News, was considered a serious threat to take Demeter's job.[72] By the 
start of the season, Demeter had his role reduced to coming off the bench.[73] 
Before opening day for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1961, talks had already 
started between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies for a potential 
trade involving Demeter and Phillies reliever Turk Farrell.[74] A deal 
was reached on May 4, sending Don and Charley Smith to Philadelphia for 
Farrell and Joe Koppe.[75] Phillies manager Gene Mauch was glad about the 
deal, announcing immediately after the trade that Demeter would be a starter 
immediately. Mauch remarked, "There aren't many better center fielders 
around than he is, and you can put it in the book right now that he'll 
hit more than 20 home runs any year he plays a full season in our park."[76] 
Don would prove the prophetic manager to be correct, hitting 21, 29, and 
22 home runs in 3 seasons with Philadelphia.[1] Don started slow with his 
new team in May, but quickly picked up steam in the month of June where 
he hit .337 with 4 home runs and 21 RBI.[1] In August, he had a 10-day 
period from August 15 through 25 where he racked up 6 home runs and 13 
RBI, including hitting a home run in three consecutive games.[1] However, 
as the season dragged on, Don's nagging injuries caught up with him. Over 
the course of the year, Demeter had to sit out for a week in May with a 
pulled groin muscle, several more days in June after a jammed middle finger 
on his right hand, and four times with a left knee injury, with the fourth 
occurrence shutting him down for the short remainder of the season.[77] 
On September 12, Demeter had a titanic outing on the road against the very 
team that had traded him to Philadelphia just four months prior, the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. With the Phillies at 50 games under .500 and the Dodgers 
trying to just barely stay alive for the National League Pennant, Don hit 
three home runs and drove in seven runs en route to a 19-10 win, all but 
killing any chance of Los Angeles winning the pennant.[78] Don finished 
the season with a .257 average to go along with a team-high 70 RBI and 
a career-high 21 home runs.[1] In August 1961, the Phillies began experimenting 
with moving him into the infield at first base. Two months later, Phillies 
management expected Don to be their regular first baseman on opening day.[77] 
Plans changed when recent acquisition, third baseman Andy Carey, announced 
his retirement, sparking interest in making Demeter the Phillies new third 
baseman.[79] Mauch had high expectations of Demeter, predicting that he 
and Roy Sievers would be the two catalysts to make the Phillies successful 
and improve upon their 47-107 record from last season.[80] This marked 
the first season where Don knew he would have regular playing time for 
the Phillies no matter what, whether it be at third base or in the outfield. 
"We have to have Don's bat in the lineup somewhere", said his manager.[81] 
Demeter agreed to terms on his contract for the 1962 season in early February.[82] 
He impressed early in spring training games, having a two home run, five 
RBI effort against the Minnesota Twins on March 10, 1962.[83] On opening 
day at the Cincinnati Reds, Demeter started at third base, hitting a home 
run and driving in three runners to contribute to a 12-4 win.[84] He had 
three multiple home run games throughout the season, and on one occasion 
drove in 6 runners.[1][85] Don's hottest month was August, where he hit 
.398 with a .669 slugging percentage, 8 home runs, and 31 RBI in 32 games.[1] 
His stellar play down the stretch helped the Phillies win 30 of their final 
44 games, giving them a final record of 81-80, which was an improvement 
of over 30 games from last year. The United Press International named Gene 
Mauch the National League manager of the year.[86] On August 15 against 
the New York Mets, Demeter attained a unique feat. He hit two home runs 
that day off two separate players named Bob Miller. In the 3rd inning he 
hit a homer against Bob Lane Miller, and in the 9th another off Bob Gerald 
Miller.[87] 1962 was a breakout season for Demeter. He led his team in 
all triple crown categories and more. His homers, runs batted in, and batting 
average were all top marks, as were his slugging percentage, OPS, and sacrifice 
flies.[1] Demeter became the first Phillies player in seven years to drive 
in over 100 runs since Del Ennis in 1955.[88] Don broke the top 10 in many 
offensive categories in the National League. Don placed 8th in home runs 
with 29, 7th in runs batted in with 107, 9th in batting average with a 
.307 mark, 6th in slugging with .520, 9th in OPS with an .879, 10th in 
at bats per home run with 19, 2nd in times hit by pitch with 10, and he 
had 11 sacrifice flies, a major league best. Demeter carried an offensive 
WAR mark of 5.4, 7th best in the league. He finished 12th in the voting 
for National League Most Valuable Player Award.[1] Defensively, his errors 
were way up from last season. In 1961, Demeter had only four errors.[1] 
At third base for the 1962 season, Don's 18 errors was 5th worst in the 
National League and his .937 fielding percentage in 105 games at third 
base was the worst in the NL for all players that played 60 or more games 
at the position.[89] Regular centerfielder Tony González was injured in 
mid-August with a back injury that left him hospitalized for three weeks, 
forcing Demeter back into his old position in the outfield for the remainder 
of the season.[90][91] After season's end, Don played in an exhibition 
game on October 21 for a National League squad managed by Cardinals manager 
Johnny Keane to face off against the American League in an all-star game 
sponsored by the Houston Professional Baseball Players Association.[92] 
In a move to potentially get Demeter back into left field on a regular 
basis, the Phillies acquired all-star Don Hoak from the Pittsburgh Pirates.[93] 
Demeter officially agreed to terms with his new contract on February 12, 
1963.[94] Demeter started the season with yet another hot start, hitting 
.455 with 4 home runs and 12 RBI during his 11-game hit streak.[1] The 
Cardinals finally brought his streak to a close on the second game of a 
doubleheader on April 21, but Demeter quickly got things rolling again 
with another two-hit performance the next night.[95] On May 5, Don was 
involved in a dramatic play to end the game against the Houston Colt .45's. 
Phillies pinch hitter Wayne Graham hit a ground ball back toward Houston 
pitcher Hal Woodeshick, who threw the ball back to catcher John Bateman. 
Demeter attempted to run towards home plate from third base and collided 
with Bateman, knocking the ball loose and scoring the final run in a 6-5 
win.[96] May 17 saw Don gain the distinction of being one of the select 
few in MLB history to score a run in a game against a pitcher that ended 
up throwing a no-hitter. Don Nottebart of Houston held the Phillies hitless, 
but in the fifth inning Demeter hit a ground ball past J. C. Hartman, resulting 
in what was recorded as a two-base error. Clay Dalrymple dropped a bunt 
to successfully move Demeter to 3rd, and he later scored on a sacrifice 
fly from Hoak to tie the game at 1-1. Houston went on to win the game 4-1.[97] 
Don missed several games in May against the Colts after taking a pitch 
that hit his right hand on the middle and index fingers,[98] and two more 
in June when he jammed his right ankle while sliding back into first base 
against the Cardinals on June 12.[99] Beginning on the day of Nottebart's 
no-hitter, Demeter was platooned to third base. Hoak was not living up 
to expectations at third, hitting just .197 before being benched.[100] 
Demeter got hot again in the last half of June, hitting six home runs over 
a period of nine games.[101] He had his second multi-homer outing on June 
19 at Cincinnati in a 6-5 loss in 10 innings,[102] but had 10th inning 
heroics of his own on June 25 at Pittsburgh when he launched a home run 
in the top frame against Pirates reliever Harvey Haddix.[101] Demeter suffered 
another minor injury on July 28 when Don Drysdale of the Dodgers hit him 
on his right forearm, resulting in several more missed games on the season.[103] 
Demeter finished the season as the team-leader in RBIs with 83, one ahead 
of first baseman Roy Sievers. He was also second in home runs with 22 to 
right fielder Johnny Callison's 26. He ranked sixth in the National League 
in at bats per home run with 23.4. His 10 intentional walks were 8th highest 
in the league. Despite gathering 7 errors at third base, Demeter was the 
only player in the entire MLB to finish with a perfect 1.000% fielding 
percentage at center field, and also the only outfielder in the National 
League to accomplish the feat. Don finished 21st in the MVP balloting, 
getting just 3 vote points. Demeter tallied 63 runs scored, 20 doubles, 
and a .258 batting average.[1] In the offseason, Pittsburgh expressed interest 
in acquiring Demeter. Gene Mauch said he'd only consider the offer if Bill 
Mazeroski or Roberto Clemente were involved in the deal.[104] In a 1965 
interview, Demeter alleged that when the Phillies put him at third base, 
they would sometimes alter the dynamics of the infield. He said, "They 
used to let the grass grow for me whenever I played third base over in 
Philly. And whenever Cal McLish pitched, they'd be out there in the afternoon 
wetting down the grass in front of the plate." This was designed to make 
ground balls to Demeter roll slower.[105] Demeter holds the bizarre distinction 
of being the only major leaguer on record to field an apple. There was 
a game during his tenure with the Phillies where Demeter had missed several 
defensive plays at 3rd base. The fans were upset and booing loudly, even 
prompting one overzealous fan to throw an apple onto the field. Demeter 
recalled, "I'd made two errors and here came an apple sailing out of the 
stands." He continued, "So I just picked it up, took a bite out of it and 
the booing stopped."[106] On December 5, 1963, the Phillies traded Don 
Demeter and reliever Jack Hamilton to the Detroit Tigers for catcher Gus 
Triandos and eventual hall-of-famer Jim Bunning. Manager Charlie Dressen 
assigned Demeter to center field, moving previous starter Bill Bruton to 
left. Commenting on the trade, Dressen remarked, "Demeter is a better all-around 
player than Rocky Colavito." Dressen's plan early on was to have Demeter 
bat 3rd in the lineup against right-handed pitchers, and 5th against lefties. 
Demeter was excited to play alongside right fielder Al Kaline, saying, 
"I've always thought he was the greatest thing to put on a uniform."[107] 
In spring training, Demeter hit .364 in his first eight games as a Tiger,[108] 
including a bases-loaded 3 RBI triple against the Cardinals on March 18.[109] 
He finished the 27-game exhibition circuit with 12 RBI, second only to 
Norm Cash.[110] Demeter injured his ankle in the first game of a doubleheader 
against the Minnesota Twins on April 19, hitting two foul balls off it. 
After the X-rays came back negative, he rejoined the team on April 22 against 
the Los Angeles Angels with a special guard for the ankle.[111][112] The 
setback resulted in a .138 batting average in his first seven games in 
the American League. However, he started to turn it around on April 26, 
hitting his first home run as a Tiger off Jim Kaat.[113] On April 29, he 
hit a decisive home run in the top of the 10th inning against the Kansas 
City Athletics off reliever John Wyatt, leading the Tigers to a 5-4 win.[114] 
On May 23 at the Cleveland Indians, Demeter went back to catch a long fly 
ball from Leon Wagner, but as he tried to catch the ball, he hit his head 
on a padded metal bar on top of the outfield fence. The ball bounced off 
his glove and over the fence, resulting in a three-run home run for the 
Indians. Dressen remarked that he had seen the same incident occur with 
Billy Bruton on a three-run home run by Tommie Reynolds at Kansas City 
on April 30.[115] Demeter was slumping for the first two months of the 
season, accruing a statline of just 2 home runs and 14 RBI in 37 games 
to go with a batting average of .238.[1] On June 8 and 9, he turned it 
around by slugging for a combined 2 home runs and 9 RBI against the Twins. 
On June 13 he homered again against the Angels, and he followed it up by 
delivering a game-winning double on June 14 to complete a sweep of the 
three-game series.[116] On July 14, Demeter hit a home run and drove in 
two runs, and also made what was described as a "spectacular" diving catch 
that denied the Angels an opportunity to score the tying run in the 9th 
inning. He commented that the day was his best game since joining the Tigers.[117] 
On July 31, Demeter set a Major League record with 206 consecutive errorless 
games in the outfield, passing former Phillies teammate Tony González's 
mark of 205.[118] The streak began two seasons ago on September 3, 1962.[119] 
Demeter downplayed the record, citing it as "deceptive." He remarked, "With 
the Phillies, I started quite a few games at third base and went to the 
outfield in the late innings." He claimed that he thought he made two errors 
throughout the 1964 season. "I lost one ball in the sun. Another one I 
didn't play very well in the wind. They were scored as hits. In my mind, 
they are errors."[118] At season's end, he had extended his streak to 228 
games.[25] From August 25 to 27 at the Boston Red Sox, Demeter had game-winning 
hits in all three, leading to a Tigers sweep.[120] In the September 7, 
1964 issue of Sports Illustrated, Demeter was awarded with player of the 
week honors for his clutch play.[121] Demeter finished the 1964 season 
with similar numbers to the prior season with the Phillies. He had 22 home 
runs and 80 runs batted in to complement a .256 batting average. He finished 
first in the Major Leagues in fielding percentage in the outfield with 
a perfect 1.000, the only qualifying player to accomplish the feat. Demeter 
finished 2nd on the team in RBI to Cash's 83, but he tied 8 games with 
RBIs and gave the Tigers the go ahead run in 28 more, posting a team-best 
36 games overall.[1][122] In January 1965, Demeter signed a new contract 
with the Tigers for the amount of $30,000.[122] In late January, he joined 
manager Dressen on an annual press-radio-television tour that went to Toledo 
and outstate Michigan.[123] Demeter was cited as the Tigers most clutch 
hitter,[121][124] but Demeter still wasn't satisfied with his power output. 
He trained in Oklahoma during the winter, chopping wood and gaining 12 
pounds to 202.[122] On February 5 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Demeter was given 
the Art Griggs Award given to Oklahomans with the most outstanding performance 
at the major league level. He remarked, "I would have to thank Mickey Mantle 
for moving out of the state, Allie Reynolds for retiring and Warren Spahn 
for just getting old."[125] In spring training, Demeter had a two homer 
outing against the Washington Senators on April 2,[126] followed by another 
solo home run against the Cincinnati Reds on April 4.[127] He later admitted 
after his two-homer outing, one over the right field wall and another over 
the right, that he wanted to try for a third home run over the wall in 
center field. However, he didn't get the chance as he was walked and subsequently 
pulled for a pinch runner. "It tears me up to walk when I'm swinging that 
good", Demeter said.[128] Demeter was the opening day starter in center 
field on April 12, 1965 at the Kansas City Athletics. Demeter was hit by 
a pitch from Athletics pitcher Moe Drabowsky in the first inning, but he 
finished the game on 3-for-3 with a triple and two runs scored.[1][129] 
Although it was intended for Demeter to remain in the outfield, Demeter 
was asked to again take his duties to the infield at first base.[130] In 
May, he sat out several games after suffering a minor case of whiplash 
in the neck and shoulder after he slid head-first into third base.[131] 
Demeter played at first for almost every game for two months before returning 
to the outfield full-time in July to resume his record errorless streak,[1] 
only for it to abruptly come to an end at 266 games on July 15 in an exponentially 
improbable fashion. A dog ran onto the field as Demeter fielded a ball 
hit to him. Demeter looked at the dog, then promptly made a wild throw, 
ending his record-setting error-less game streak.[132] The record would 
stand for almost 28 years to the day. On July 16, 1993, Darren Lewis played 
in his 267th consecutive error-less game.[2] On August 12 against the Athletics, 
Demeter hit a grand slam and had 7 RBI, tying a career high.[1][133][134] 
However, the great moment couldn't be celebrated long as the next night 
against the Angels ended with Demeter being carried off the field in a 
stretcher and hospitalized overnight after a pitch in the fifth inning 
from California pitcher Dean Chance struck him in the head, resulting in 
two missed games.[134][135] Demeter suffered another injury on August 27 
at Los Angeles, damaging his left wrist while trying to make a diving catch 
on a line drive hit by Jimmy Piersall. After 12 X-rays, it was finally 
determined to be a sprain and not a broken wrist as originally diagnosed. 
It was the same wrist he broke in 1961 during his tenure with the Dodgers. 
Several key players were injured at the time, leading Demeter to remark, 
"I really feel sick for Charlie (Dressen). The poor guy gets his team where 
it can make a move and then injuries hit him."[136] Due to the injury-laden 
season, Demeter had his lowest output since 1961. In 122 games, Demeter 
had 16 home runs and 58 RBI. His batting average improved over last season, 
jumping from .256 to .278, second highest on the team to Kaline's .281. 
He was hit by 6 pitches on the year, 6th highest in the American League.[1] 
He had a .400 batting average as a pinch hitter, furthering his reputation 
as the most clutch hitter for the Phillies.[137] Seven outfielders, including 
Demeter, were brought to the Tigers spring training facility in Lakeland, 
Florida.[138] Demeter was one of the last players to sign his contract 
for the 1966 season, receiving a raise to $33,000.[139] Unlike years past, 
Demeter's spot as everyday starter in center field was not guaranteed. 
By March, it was already being predicted that Demeter was going to lose 
his position to a young Mickey Stanley, who was described by Baseball Digest 
magazine as a defensive ace.[140] Demeter had trouble with a sore right 
shoulder during spring training, requiring a cortisone shot. Eventually, 
it was officially announced that he had lost his slot in center field to 
Stanley.[141] In the early days of the season, Demeter had an 0-for-23 
slump, the worst of his career. It got to the point where manager Dressen 
told him to, "not pick up a bat", benching him for several games.[142] 
Demeter had few offensive highlights in the opening months. On May 17 against 
the Yankees he broke a 2-2 tie with a two-run homer off New York pitcher 
Fritz Peterson.[143] Demeter remarked that the day was his wedding anniversary. 
"I've hit home runs six of the last seven years for her."[144] Later, on 
May 21 at the Orioles, Demeter started a six-run rally in the 4th inning 
with a three-run home run off pitcher John Miller to tie the game 4-4.[145] 
On June 4, 1966, Don Demeter and Julio Navarro were traded by the Detroit 
Tigers to the Boston Red Sox for outfielder Joe Christopher and pitcher 
Earl Wilson. The Red Sox had been attempting anywhere from several weeks 
to several months to obtain Demeter, offering a combination of catcher 
Bob Tillman and an infielder, but the Tigers continually rejected the offers. 
General manager Billy Herman had known Demeter ever since he was a coach 
for the Dodgers several years prior. Demeter was a player Herman wanted 
to acquire ever since he took the manager post in September 1964. "He (Demeter) 
is a good hitter with power. I know he will take good advantage of our 
left field wall." He went on to say, "One of the things I like best about 
Demeter is that I can use him at five positions. He can play anywhere in 
the outfield, and he can play both first and third base. Don will shake 
up a few people on this club." Herman cited that his then current plan 
was to put Demeter in center field, but was also considering playing him 
at third base, where Joe Foy had been struggling offensively. Herman also 
said he would start Demeter at first base for a few days should rookie 
first baseman George Scott need any sort of rest.[146] Demeter went from 
a benchwarmer in Detroit to being an everyday starter once again in Boston. 
In his first game for the Sox on June 17, Demeter hit a home run off Orioles 
pitcher Steve Barber to tie the game 2-2, but Boston would go on to lose 
the game 5-3.[147] From his opening performance through the end of the 
month, he raised his batting average over 40 points by batting .348 with 
3 home runs and 8 runs batted in.[1] Even with the hot start in his new 
home, Demeter still sat out several games due to various ailments. A foul 
tip hit Demeter on the knee cost a few games.[148] Later in July he had 
back problems that forced him to sit out intermittently.[149] On August 
3 at Minnesota, the Twins scoreboard flashed a message to the crowd as 
Demeter walked to the plate saying, "Demeter a Dad." His first daughter 
had been born that night in Newton-Wellesley Hospital just outside Boston 
earlier in the day. After the message flashed, Demeter launched the first 
pitch from Twins pitcher Dave Boswell into the left field bleachers for 
a home run. While Demeter ran around the bases, the organist played the 
theme, "Rock-a-bye Baby."[150] Demeter returned to Detroit for a four-game 
series in early August. On August 6, he hit a home run off former teammate 
Denny McLain.[151] In 7 games against his old team, Demeter ripped the 
team for 2 home runs, 7 runs batted in, a .381 batting average and a .762 
slugging percentage.[1] Although Demeter had low offensive marks all around 
in his last days with the Detroit Tigers with a triple crown line of .212-5-12 
in 32 games, he hit much better in his last 73 games with the Red Sox. 
He hit for a batting average of .292, the highest batting average for regular 
starters on the team. His .478 slugging percentage was second best to Tony 
Conigliaro, and his .783 OPS ranked just behind Conigliaro (.817) and Carl 
Yastrzemski (.799). Demeter thrived in his 37 games batting from the 5-hole. 
In 23 games, he posted a .372 batting average with 4 home runs, 14 runs 
batted in, and a .991 OPS. For the overall season, Demeter hit .268 with 
14 home runs and 41 runs batted in, playing in 105 games.[1] After the 
season's end, Demeter's starting role in center field once again lost its 
guarantee despite the near .300 batting average. Rookie Reggie Smith looked 
to be the new starting center fielder, with Jose Tartabull to be his backup, 
leaving Demeter as the odd man out. Talks of trading Demeter surfaced in 
December, with some even suggesting that they try and trade him back to 
Detroit to retrieve pitcher Earl Wilson.[152] Near the end of spring training, 
George Thomas had also passed him by on the depth chart.[153] In the regular 
season, Demeter rode the bench, not getting a start until May 7, Boston's 
20th game of the season.[1] He went 2-for-5 in the game with a double and 
a run scored, as well as two notedly hard line drive outs.[154] After his 
successful first start, manager Dick Williams told the Boston press that 
Demeter would likely start in right field for Conigliaro, but come the 
night of May 8, Conigliaro was starting in right and Demeter was once again 
riding the bench, much to his reported chagrin.[155] The Boston Red Sox 
traded Don Demeter and Tony Horton to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher 
Gary Bell on June 4, 1967.[156] On June 19, with two men out in the bottom 
of the 9th and one man on base, Demeter pinch-hit for Indians pitcher Sonny 
Siebert, hitting a game-tying home run, which later led to a 2-1 victory 
for Cleveland.[157] Demeter missed several games towards the end of the 
month with a pulled leg muscle.[158] On August 31, 1967, the Detroit Tigers 
announced that they had bought Demeter from Cleveland.[159] Demeter was 
going to be their first baseman, but the deal was called off as it was 
found out that Demeter had circulatory problems around the heart area and 
he never reported to the team.[160] Demeter complained about chest pains 
and had several doctor examinations. It was originally diagnosed as a minor 
muscle strain, but an EKG on September 5 showed "changes which indicate 
a disturbance in his coronary artery circulation."[161] Demeter played 
in 51 games for Cleveland, batting .207 with 5 home runs and 12 runs batted 
in. For the 1967 season overall, he appeared in 71 games, hitting 6 home 
runs, driving in 16 runners, and batting .226. His best month was his final 
month, hitting .313 with 6 RBI and 2 home runs over 19 games in August 
before playing the final game of his major league career on August 28.[1] 
In early January 1968, Demeter was still listed on the Indians roster, 
but he was heavily considering retirement.[162] On February 29, 1968, Don 
Demeter officially announced his retirement from Major League Baseball. 
He reported for spring training in Tucson, Arizona and successfully passed 
a complete physical examination, but still decided to end his career due 
to potential health concerns about his heart from September. The doctor 
said Demeter didn't have a heart attack or suffer damages to his heart, 
but Demeter ended by saying, "However, the doctor added that there was 
the possibility that I'd be running down the line some day and have an 
attack." [163] Demeter participated in the first ever old-timer's game 
hosted by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He started in center field for the 1960s 
Dodgers. The 1950s Dodgers won the game 1-0 in front of a crowd of 48,227.[164] 
In an eleven-season career, Demeter posted a .265 batting average with 
163 home runs and 563 RBI in 1109 games played. He had a career average 
of 21.1 at bats per home run, which stands as one of the top 150 rates 
of all-time as of 2010.[1] Don is the son of Lewis and Aileen Demeter, 
the third of four children.[6] His foster father, George Stevens, was a 
Superintendent for Sunday school in Oklahoma City at the Exchange Avenue 
Baptist Church.[4] As a junior in high school in 1950, he met his future 
wife Betty Jo Madole at the Exchange Avenue Baptist Church during a social 
event. They married on May 17, 1957 and had a son, Russell Don Demeter, 
on January 26, 1959.[6][165] Todd Demeter, Don's son, was a second round 
draft pick of the New York Yankees in 1979.[166] Todd played four seasons 
in the Yankees farm system and two with the St. Louis Cardinals, but never 
advanced past Class AA.[167] Two of his grandchildren, Cole and Caden Cleveland, 
were stars at Christian Heritage Academy with All-State honors, and are 
currently set to play Division 1 college baseball at Morehead State in 
Kentucky.[3] After winning the World Series with the Dodgers in 1959, Demeter 
returned home to Oklahoma City to spend the winter as a youth director 
at a Baptist church.[65] In Oklahoma City, he lived near neighbor Washington 
Senators catcher Mike Brumley, who often accompanied Demeter to church 
appearances several nights a week throughout Oklahoma and Texas throughout 
the years, as well as a special series of church meetings in Alaska in 
1966.[122][168] In the aftermath of his career-best 1962 season, Don toured 
on a team put together by Willie Mays, was a speaker at church functions 
across five states, and finally in February 1963 went on a church-sponsored 
tour of Japan along with Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson.[169][170] 
The tour was sponsored by the Texas Baptist Convention in order to participate 
in what was referred to as the "New Life Campaign". They gave Christian 
testimonies to locals and spoke to Japanese professional baseball players. 
Before leaving, they held a news conferenece, emphasizing their goals in 
their trip to Japan. They said, "We are two Christians from the United 
States. We are here to present our witness for Christ."[169] Demeter did 
not drink, smoke, or curse during his baseball career. He also rejected 
endorsement deals for advertising alcohol and tobacco products.[171] Once 
his baseball career was over, Don returned home to Oklahoma to start a 
pool-building business and later became a preacher.[3] In 1973, Don became 
president of the minor league Oklahoma City 89ers.[172] Demeter entered 
a political race in 1976 as a Republican, losing a bid for a seat in the
