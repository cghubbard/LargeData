The Detroit Tigers are a charter member of the American League, beginning 
play in 1901. Their all-time regular season record in MLB play is 8,828–8,578 
(.507) (as of the end of the 2012 regular season). In the playoffs, the 
Tigers have won 10 series and lost 9, and are 52–49 (.515) overall. The 
Tigers have won 4 World Series championships, 11 American League pennants, 
3 American League East division titles, 3 American League Central division 
titles, and 1 American League wild card berth. The Tigers have had several 
periods of success in their history, though most have been short. Between 
1907 and 1911 they played in three World Series without a win. From 1934 
to 1950 they had only two losing seasons and won two of their four World 
Series. From 1961 to 1973 the Tigers also had only two losing seasons, 
but only twice reached the postseason; the period from 1978 to 1988 was 
similar. The Tigers have had some striking failures in their history, including 
the period from 1988 to 2005 where they did not play in the postseason 
and had only two winning seasons between 1989 and the end of this period.
