The Arizona Diamondbacks are a Major League Baseball team based in Phoenix, 
Arizona. The Diamondbacks are part of the National League and play in the 
West Division. Since beginning play in the 1998 season, the Diamondbacks 
called Chase Field (formerly named "Bank One Ballpark") their home.[1] 
The name "Diamondbacks" was inspired by the Western diamondback snake and 
was chosen among thousands of entries in a contest to name the team.[2] 
Arizona made their Major League debut in the 1998 baseball season when 
they became the 14th expansion team.[3] After going 65-97 in their first 
their first season, the Diamondbacks were the National League West Division 
Champions in the 1999 baseball season when they went 100-62. They made 
it to the National League Division Series but they lost to the New York 
Mets.[4] The early success of the franchise was exemplified in 2001 when 
the Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees in a dramatic seven game 
World Series in 2001.[5] In the 2002 baseball season, Arizona returned 
to the playoffs but were defeated by the St. Louis Cardinals in the National 
League Division Series.[6] Post season baseball did not return to the desert 
until the 2007 season when Arizona lost to the Colorado Rockies in the 
National League Championship Series.[7] The following season, Arizona narrowly 
missed the playoffs, when they finished 2 games behind the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. In 2011, the Diamondbacks won their division but were ousted by 
the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Division Series. These statistics
