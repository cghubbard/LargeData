Christopher David "Chris" Stewart (born February 19, 1982) is an American 
professional baseball catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). Stewart has also played in the majors for the Chicago White 
Sox, Texas Rangers, New York Yankees, San Diego Padres and San Francisco 
Giants. He stands 6'4" and weighs 210 lbs. Born in Fontana, California, 
Stewart attended Canyon Springs High School in Moreno Valley, California. 
After graduating high school in 2000, Stewart attended Riverside Community 
College for one season before turning professional. During his freshman 
season at Riverside, Stewart hit .361 with a .509 slugging percentage.[1] 
The Chicago White Sox selected Stewart in the 12th round of the 2001 Major 
League Baseball Draft.[2] He signed with the White Sox that year on August 
18.[3] Stewart began his professional career in 2002 with the Chicago White 
Sox rookie-level affiliate, the Bristol White Sox of the Appalachian League. 
With Bristol, Stewart batted .278 with 25 runs, 44 hits, nine doubles, 
one home run and 12 runs batted in (RBIs). On defense that season, Stewart 
committed eight errors in 377 total chances. During the 2003 season, Stewart 
was assigned to the Winston-Salem Warthogs of the Class-A Advanced Carolina 
League. In 2004, Stewart split his time, first playing Triple-A ball with 
the Charlotte Knights of the International League and then Double-A baseball 
with the Birmingham Barons of the Southern League. Stewart stayed with 
the Barons for the 2005 minor league baseball season. In 2006, Stewart 
was promoted back up to Triple-A with the Charlotte Knights and put on 
the White Sox's 40-man roster and made his Major League debut on September 
6, 2006.[citation needed] Stewart appeared in 4 games for the White Sox 
before making his first start on September 27, 2006. In his 8 major league 
at bats, Stewart had no hits and two strikeouts. Stewart was traded to 
the Texas Rangers on January 12, 2007, for minor league pitcher John Lujan.[4] 
After showing solid defensive skills in spring training, Stewart beat out 
veteran Miguel Ojeda for the Rangers backup catcher job, and started the 
season on the major league roster. On June 9, 2007, the Rangers optioned 
Stewart to Triple-A after acquiring Adam Melhuse in a trade. Stewart went 
to 2008 spring training with the Rangers before being released on March 
27, 2008.[5] On April 3, 2008, Stewart signed a minor league contract with 
the New York Yankees and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate, the 
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees.[6] He was called up following the injury 
to Yankee catcher Jorge Posada on April 28, 2008. He was sent down after 
only appearing in one game on April 30, after Chad Moeller cleared waivers 
and re-joined the team. Stewart was designated for assignment on June 30 
to make room on the roster for Brett Gardner and later outrighted to the 
minors.[citation needed] Stewart became a free agent after the season and 
re-signed with the Chicago White Sox.[7] On March 22, 2009, Stewart returned 
to the Yankees by being traded for a player to be named later (PTBNL).[8] 
Stewart signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres on December 
22, 2009. Stewart was called up to join the Padres on September 1, 2010. 
He was designated for assignment by the Padres on October 6,[9] he was 
outrighted to the minors but he refused the assignment and became a free 
agent.[citation needed] Stewart signed with the San Francisco Giants for 
the 2011 season. They called him up to the majors on May 26 after Buster 
Posey was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a fractured bone in his 
lower left leg. On August 9, 2011, he hit his first big-league home run 
against the Pittsburgh Pirates' James McDonald. The New York Yankees traded 
for Stewart on April 4, 2012, in exchange for reliever George Kontos.[10] 
He served as the backup to Russell Martin for the 2012 season, with Francisco 
Cervelli playing in Triple-A.[citation needed] Before the start of the 
2013 season, Yankees' manager Joe Girardi estimated Stewart would play 
in 60 games; he played in over 100.[11] On July 20, 2013, against the rival 
Red Sox, Stewart turned one of the more memorable double plays of the year. 
With Daniel Nava on first, Dustin Pedroia popped up behind home plate. 
Stewart threw his mask off and dived into the stands to make a spectacular 
catch, nearly toppling over. Noticing that Nava started to run for second, 
Stewart quickly regained balance and threw a laser to the second baseman 
to throw out Nava. Stewart's efforts helped secure a 5â€“2 victory for the 
Yankees.[12] On December 2, 2013, the Yankees traded Stewart to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates for cash or a player to be named later.[13] Stewart has a reputation 
as an excellent defensive catcher. He contributes to the team with his 
ability to frame pitches, which saves his team runs.[14] Stewart also excels 
at throwing out potential base stealers; in 2011 with the Giants Stewart 
caught 39% of base stealers and in 2013 with the Yankees, Stewart caught 
31% of base stealers.[15] Stewart and his wife, Lindsey, have two children; 
a son, Sebastian Carter, and a daughter, Brooklyn Jean.[citation needed]
