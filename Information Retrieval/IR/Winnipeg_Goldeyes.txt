The Winnipeg Goldeyes are a professional baseball team based in Winnipeg, 
Manitoba, Canada. The Goldeyes play in the American Association of Independent 
Professional Baseball (2011-Present), which is not affiliated with Major 
League Baseball. Previously, the Goldeyes and the Winnipeg Maroons were 
longtime members of the Northern League (1993-2010), (1902-1971). The Goldeyes 
have played their home games at Shaw Park since 1999. The team is named 
after the goldeye, a fish usually served as a smoked delicacy and commonly 
called Winnipeg goldeye.[1] There have been two separate and distinct baseball 
teams based out of Winnipeg to use the Goldeyes name, each playing in different 
incarnations of the Northern League. They first played in the original 
Northern League from 1954 until 1964. During that time, the Goldeyes were 
a minor league affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals and they won the league 
championship three times (1957, 1959, and 1960). The Goldeyes returned 
to the Short Season-A Northern League for one season, 1969, as an affiliate 
of the expansion Kansas City Royals, but they did not return in 1970, and 
the entire league shut down after the 1971 season.[citation needed] The 
Goldeyes name was resurrected in 1994 when the independent league Rochester 
Aces of the new Northern League folded and relocated to Winnipeg. It was 
decided the team would take on the name of the former Winnipeg team in 
honor of the past. In their inaugural season in Winnipeg, the new Goldeyes 
captured the Northern League championship.[2] The Goldeyes became the longest 
tenured franchise in the Northern League following the departure of the 
St. Paul Saints, Sioux City Explorers and Sioux Falls Canaries to the breakaway 
American Association in 2005; however the team would jump to the American 
Association after the 2010 season.[3][4] The Goldeyes captured their first 
American Association championship in 2012, sweeping the Wichita Wingnuts 
in the finals.[2] From 1994 to 1998, the Goldeyes played their homes games 
at Winnipeg Stadium, a Canadian football stadium retrofitted for baseball. 
The team moved into CanWest Global Park (now Shaw Park), their own baseball-only 
facility, prior to the 1999 season. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders
