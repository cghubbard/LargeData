The 1974 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 92nd season in franchise 
history. The Phillies finished in third place in the National League East 
with a record of 80 wins and 82 losses. They would not finish below .500 
again until going 75-87 in 1985. Third baseman Mike Schmidt had a breakout 
season in 1974, leading the National League in home runs and demonstrating 
his prowess in the field. On June 10, Schmidt hit what many felt should 
have been a home run when the ball hit the public address speaker that 
hung 117 feet above and 329 feet away from home plate at the Astrodome 
in Houston. The ball hit the speaker, fell to the field, and, by the Astrodome's 
ground rules, remained in play. Since Schmidt had already started his slow 
home run trot, he was held to a single. (There were runners on first and 
second when the ball was hit, and they each advanced only one base.) Many 
experts agree the ball would have traveled in excess of 500 feet.[citation
