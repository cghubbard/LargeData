Michael T. "Nuf Ced" McGreevy (June 16, 1865 â€“ February 2, 1943) was the 
leader of the most vocal fans of the Boston Americans (now the Boston Red 
Sox), today known as the "Royal Rooters". McGreevy owned the Third Base 
Saloon, which got its name because, like third base, it was the last stop 
before home. His saloon was Boston's original sports bar - it was decorated 
in a baseball theme, with pictures of the players, and a scoreboard on 
the outside wall. His nickname "Nuf Ced" was given to him because that 
was what he usually shouted to end barroom disputes, usually about the 
Boston Americans and the Boston Braves. McGreevy amassed a rich collection 
of photographs, clippings, and other baseball memorabilia. When Prohibition 
forced McGreevy to close Third Base, he donated his collection to the Boston 
Public Library. Author Glenn Stout (A Red Sox Century) helped popularize 
the collection when he worked at the library. The theme song of the "Royal 
Rooters" was "Tessie" from the Broadway musical "The Silver Slipper". McGreevy 
was immortalized in a 2004 remake of the song by the Irish American punk 
band Dropkick Murphys. It subsequently was part of the soundtrack of the 
movie Fever Pitch concerning fans of the 2004 season of the Red Sox. In 
2008, Dropkick Murphys bassist Ken Casey re-opened Third Base, although 
it is no longer known as such. Now the tavern is known as McGreevy's Boston 
and can be converted to open-air. There is also a sign on the front of 
the bar that says "1200 Steps to Fenway Park." It is on Boylston Street 
and is right across the street from the Hynes Convention Center located
