As player As coach Melvin Leon "Mel" Stottlemyre, Sr. (born November 13, 
1941) is an American former professional baseball pitcher and pitching 
coach. He played for 11 seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York 
Yankees, and coached for 23 seasons. He is a five-time MLB All-Star and 
five-time World Series champion, as a coach. Stottlemyre pitched in American 
Legion Baseball and attended Mabton High School in Mabton, Washington, 
and Yakima Valley Community College. A scout for the New York Yankees discovered 
Stottlemyre pitching for Yakima's baseball team, and signed him to a contract 
with no signing bonus on June 10, 1961. The Yankees assigned him to the 
Harlan Smokies of the Rookie-level Appalachian League. After appearing 
in eight games, the Yankees promoted him to the Auburn Yankees of the Class 
D New York–Penn League, and he appeared in seven games for Auburn. Stottlemyre 
pitched to a 17–9 win–loss record and a 2.50 earned run average (ERA) with 
the Greensboro Yankees of the Class B Carolina League in 1962, and was 
promoted to the Richmond Virginians of the Class AAA International League 
in 1963. He alternated between starting and relieving for Richmond, before 
Ralph Houk, the Yankees' general manager, insisted that Stottlemyre be 
used exclusively as a starting pitcher. He recorded a 1.42 ERA in thee 
1964 season, the best in the International League.[1] Called up midseason 
in 1964, Stottlemyre went 9–3 to help the Yankees to their fifth consecutive 
pennant while being on the cover of The Sporting News. In the 1964 World 
Series, Stottlemyre faced Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals three times 
in the seven-game Series. Stottlemyre bested Gibson in Game 2 to even the 
series, and got a no-decision in Game 5, but lost the decisive Game 7 as 
the Cardinals won the Series.[2] Stottlemyre was named to the American 
League's (AL) roster for the 1965 Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star 
Game, though he did not appear in the game.[3] He won 20 games in the 1965 
season,[4] and led the AL with 18 complete games, 291 innings pitched, 
and 1,188 batters faced.[5] He appeared in the 1966 MLB All-Star Game.[6] 
He led the league with 20 losses.[7] Stottlemyre won 20 games in the 1968 
and 1969 seasons.[4] The Yankees released Stottlemyre before the 1975 season.[8] 
Stottlemyre retired with 164 career wins and a 2.97 ERA.[4] Known as a 
solidly hitting pitcher, Stottlemyre once hit a rare inside-the-park grand 
slam. On July 20, 1965, he recorded five base hits in five at bats.[9] 
In 1977, Stottlemyre re-emerged in baseball as a roving instructor for 
the Seattle Mariners. He spent five seasons in that position,[10] and was 
hired by the New York Mets as their pitching coach in November 1983.[4] 
He served in the role for ten years (including the 1986 World Series championship 
team) and then followed by a two-year stint as the Houston Astros pitching 
coach. In 1996, Stottlemyre joined the Yankees coaching staff along with 
the incoming manager Joe Torre. Under Torre, Stottlemyre lowered the team 
ERA from 4.65 in 1996 to 3.84 in 1997 and then to 3.82 in 1998. Under Stottlemyre, 
the Yankee team averaged an ERA of 4.23 from 1996 to 2005. The pitching 
staff was regarded as a major factor in the team's dynasty years, when 
they won four World Series Championships in five years. After 10 seasons, 
Stottlemyre resigned his coaching position on October 12, 2005, following 
the Yankees' ALDS defeat by the Angels. He cited personal disagreements 
with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner among his reasons for leaving and 
cited Steinbrenner's comment that after the division series was over, he 
had congratulated Angels manager Mike Scioscia. Stottlemyre's response 
was: "My first thought was, 'What about Joe?' Joe did a hell of a job, 
too. To congratulate the other manager and not congratulate your own, after 
what he's done this year, I laughed."[11] The Yankees replaced Stottlemyre 
with former Yankees pitcher Ron Guidry.[12] Stottlemyre was named pitching 
coach of the Seattle Mariners under manager John McLaren at the beginning 
of the 2008 season,[13] and was retained by interim manager Jim Riggleman 
after McLaren's firing. He was dismissed after the season ended.[14] Following 
the season, he retired from baseball. The mayor of Mabton, Washington, 
declared October 12, 1964 to be "Mel Stottlemyre Day".[15] He was inducted 
into the Washington State American Legion Baseball Hall of Fame in 2012.[16] 
At Old-Timers' Day on June 20, 2015, the Yankees dedicated a plaque in 
Monument Park in Stottlemyre's honor.[17][18] Stottlemyre was raised in 
the town of Mabton, Washington, located in the south central part of the 
state.[19] He resides in Issaquah, Washington. Two of his sons, Todd and 
Mel Jr., followed their father by becoming major league pitchers. His other 
son, Jason, died of leukemia at the age of 11.[20] Stottlemyre was diagnosed 
with multiple myeloma in 2000. In remission for several years, he is an 
avid supporter of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.[21] The cancer 
reappeared in 2011 and he is still battling it as of 2015.[22] Stottlemyre 
wrote an autobiography entitled Pride and Pinstripes, published in 2007.
