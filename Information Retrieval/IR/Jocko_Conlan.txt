John Bertrand "Jocko" Conlan (December 6, 1899 â€“ April 16, 1989) was an 
American baseball umpire who worked in the National League (NL) from 1941 
to 1965. He had a brief career as an outfielder with the Chicago White 
Sox before entering umpiring. He umpired in five World Series and six All-Star 
Games. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 by the Veterans 
Committee. Conlan was born in Chicago. He was one of nine children. Conlan's 
father, a Chicago police officer, died when Conlan was three years old.[1] 
He attended De La Salle Institute in Chicago.[2] Beginning his professional 
baseball career in 1920, Conlan spent 13 years as a minor league player.[3] 
Statistics are incomplete, but Conlan was known to have played with Western 
League teams in Wichita until 1923. He was in the International League 
for the next several seasons, playing for the Rochester Tribe from 1924 
to 1926 and for the Newark Bears from 1927 to 1929. He spent a season with 
the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association and then returned to the 
International League with the Montreal Royals in 1931 and 1932.[4] Conlan 
began his major league career in 1934 as a center fielder for the Chicago 
White Sox. In 1935, however, Conlan was presented with an unusual opportunity. 
During a game against the St. Louis Browns, umpire Red Ormsby fell ill 
due to the heat. In those days, only two umpires covered typical regular-season 
games, and a player with a reputation for honesty might be pressed into 
service if one umpire became incapacitated. Conlan was asked to fill in, 
and took to it well. The following year Conlan made the transition from 
player to umpire complete, beginning in the minor leagues. Conlan umpired 
in the National League from 1941 to 1965,[5] officiating in five World 
Series (1945, 1950, 1954, 1957 and 1961) and six All-Star Games (1943, 
1947, 1950, 1953, 1958 and the first 1962 contest). He also umpired in 
the playoff series to decide the NL's regular-season champions in 1951, 
1959 and 1962 (some sources erroneously credit him with umpiring in the 
1946 NL playoff as well). He was the home plate umpire when Gil Hodges 
hit four home runs on August 31, 1950; he also umpired in the April 30, 
1961 game in which Willie Mays hit four home runs. He retired after the 
1964 season, but returned to work as a substitute umpire for 17 games in 
1965.[5] Conlan was known for several trademarks: Instead of a regular 
dress tie like most umpires of the day wore, Conlan wore a natty bow tie 
for his career. Conlan further distinguished himself by making "out" calls 
with his left hand instead of his right. He was also the last NL umpire 
allowed to wear the outside chest protector, instead of the inside protector 
that all other NL umpires were using by then. Manager Casey Stengel said 
that he admired Conlan's performance both as a player and as an umpire. 
He managed Conlan with the Toledo Mud Hens and described a time when Conlan 
broke his leg sliding into third base. He scored a run before telling anyone 
that he had been hurt. Though he was hitting .292 when he got hurt, Stengel 
gave him half of a $1,000 bonus he was supposed to get for batting .300. 
Stengel later said, "And as a reward for the $500 bonus I once gave him, 
he used to chase me oftener than anyone than any other manager in the league. 
But I admired him for his courage as a player and an official."[6] Jocko 
Conlan and manager Leo Durocher were both considered colorful characters, 
and sometimes they would clash. Durocher liked to tell of a time that he 
was arguing with Conlan. He attempted to kick dirt on Conlan's shoes, but 
slipped and actually kicked Conlan in the shins. Striking an umpire calls 
for automatic ejection, but first Conlan "kicked him right back", a sequence 
that an alert photographer also captured and which was circulated for some 
time.[1] As Conlan was wearing shin guards, he was not injured by Durocher's 
kicks.[7] Conlan's name was mentioned several times in a fictitious baseball 
game celebrated in the 1962 song "The Los Angeles Dodgers", recorded by 
Danny Kaye. The song referred to Conlan only by his last name, with the 
presumption that the listener would know he was referring to the famous 
umpire. That song is contained on the CD Baseball's Greatest Hits. The 
book Carl Erskine's Tales from the Dodgers Dugout: Extra Innings (2004) 
includes short stories from former Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. Conlan 
is prominent in many of these stories. Conlan retired to Arizona, where 
he enjoyed playing golf.[3] Upon Conlan's retirement, NL president Warren 
Giles said, "I know of no one who has been more dedicated to his profession, 
more loyal to the game in which he has been such a big party, and I hate 
to see him hang up his spikes."[8] Conlan was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame by the Committee on Baseball Veterans in 1974.[8] He was the fourth 
umpire chosen, and the first NL umpire since Bill Klem in 1953.[8] Conlan 
underwent heart surgery after becoming ill while watching the first game 
of the 1974 World Series. He died in 1989 at a hospital in Scottsdale, 
Arizona.[3] His son John Bertrand Conlan served as a U.S. Representative
