Paul William Splittorff, Jr. (/ˈsplɪtɔːrf/; October 8, 1946 – May 25, 2011)[1] 
was a Major League Baseball starting pitcher who spent his entire career 
with the Kansas City Royals. Listed at 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), Splittorff batted 
and threw left-handed. Splittorff was born in Evansville, Indiana and grew 
up mostly in Arlington Heights, Illinois.[2] Arlington High School produced 
several major league baseball players, including Fritz Peterson, Dick Bokelmann, 
and George Vukovich.[3] Peterson and Splittorff pitched against each other 
twice during their careers, with Peterson winning both matchups. On August 
17, 1971, the Yankees beat the Kansas City Royals 2-0 at Yankee Stadium 
(in the days before the Designated Hitter, both pitchers went 0-2 at the 
plate), [4] and on August 22, 1975 at the old Royals Stadium, the Indians 
beat the Royals, 9-5. [5] He was drafted by the Royals in the 25th round 
of the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft out of Morningside College in Sioux 
City, Iowa, where he was a member of Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity. He pitched 
for the Corning Royals in 1968 (a year before the major league club existed), 
and has the distinction of throwing the first pitch in Royals organization 
history. He went 28–27 with a 4.01 earned run average in three seasons 
in the Royals' farm system before receiving his first call to the majors 
in September 1970. He took the loss in his major league debut, pitching 
seven innings and giving up three earned runs against the Chicago White 
Sox.[6] Splittorff began the 1971 season with the Omaha Royals, but after 
going 5–2 with a 1.48 ERA in eight starts for Omaha, he earned a second 
promotion to the majors. He stayed with Kansas City for the rest of the 
season, going 8–9 with a 2.68 ERA. From there, he became a fixture in the 
Kansas City rotation. He enjoyed his only 20-win season in 1973, when he 
went 20–11 with a 3.98 ERA. Splittorff was the starting pitcher in the 
inaugural game at Kauffman Stadium (known at the time as Royals Stadium) 
on April 10, 1973; Splittorff earned the victory that evening in a 12–1 
rout of the Texas Rangers. After finishing second to the Oakland Athletics 
three of his first five seasons in the majors, Splittorff and the Royals 
emerged as American League West champions in 1976. Kansas City faced the 
New York Yankees in every American League Championship Series from 1976 
to 1978, with the Yankees emerging victorious in all three. For his part, 
Splittorff was 2–0 with a 2.84 ERA against the Yankees in the five appearances 
he made against them in the ALCS. After both teams missed the playoffs 
in 1979, the Royals and Yankees resumed their postseason rivalry in the 
1980 American League Championship Series. Kansas City swept the series, 
with Splittorff starting the third and deciding game, and receiving a no-decision.[7] 
The Royals lost the World Series in six games to the Philadelphia Phillies 
with Splittorff making his only appearance in game six.[8] Never an All-Star 
and usually overshadowed by teammates Steve Busby, Dennis Leonard and Larry 
Gura, Splittorff's consistency and longevity resulted in his winning more 
games than any of them. Splittorff accumulated 166 career victories over 
a 15-year career with the Royals. Splittorff retired when his effectiveness 
faded. At the same time, the Royals had numerous young pitchers coming 
through the ranks. His final game was on June 26, 1984. After his retirement, 
Splittorff became a television color commentator for the Royals. He was 
inducted into the Royals Hall of Fame in 1987.[9] He also worked as an 
analyst for Big Eight and Big 12 college basketball telecasts. On May 16, 
2011, Splittorff's battle with oral cancer and melanoma became public.[10] 
Nine days later, on the morning of May 25, he died in his Blue Springs,
