The Yarkon Sports Complex, is located in the Baptist Village[1] in Petah 
Tikva, just outside Tel Aviv. The field was used in the 2007 season of 
the Israel Baseball League. During this season, both Petach Tikva Pioneers 
and the Ra'anana Express called this field home.[2] Yarkon Sports Complex 
is surrounded by a Baptist Chapel and cottages. The large parking lot of 
the stadium made it extremely popular as tailgating was extremely easy. 
The stadium was also very popular due to the close distance to bus and 
train stations. The seat was a mix of stadium seats and picnic tables.[3]
