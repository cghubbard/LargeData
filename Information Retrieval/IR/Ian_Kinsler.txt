Ian Michael Kinsler (born June 22, 1982) is an American professional baseball 
second baseman for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
formerly played for the Texas Rangers. He is listed at 6 ft 0 in (183 cm) 
and 200 lb (91 kg). Despite having been drafted in only the 17th round 
out of college, Kinsler has risen to become a four-time All Star, and a 
member of the Sporting News' 2009 list of the 50 greatest current players 
in baseball. He is known as a five-tool player, hitting for average and 
power, and excelling in baserunning, throwing, and fielding.[1][2] Kinsler 
has twice hit 30 home runs and stolen 30 bases in the same season (2009 
and 2011), and is one of 12 ballplayers in major league history who have 
had multiple 30–30 club seasons. In 2011, he also joined the 20–20 club 
for the third time, one season shy of the major league record for a second 
baseman. He hit for the cycle in a game in 2009, while getting hits in 
all six of his at-bats. Through 2013, Kinsler led the Texas Rangers, all-time, 
career-wise, in stolen bases and power-speed number. In November 2013, 
Kinsler was traded to the Detroit Tigers for Prince Fielder.[3] Through 
2014, on defense Kinsler had the best career range factor of any active 
second baseman in Major League Baseball. Kinsler's father, Howard, was 
a warden at a state prison on Tucson's southeast side. He has been a major 
influence on Kinsler. When Kinsler was four his father would toss him fly 
balls, and his dad says Kinsler would "get under them like he'd been doing 
it his whole life."[4] His father coached him until high school, and was 
especially tough.[4][5][6] When Kinsler was 13 years old, and the best 
player on a PONY league team coached by his father that was playing for 
a championship, his dad caught Kinsler rolling his eyes as he gave the 
team orders. "I benched him, without hesitation", said his father.[4] With 
Kinsler on the bench, the team lost the game.[4] Kinsler had a physical 
challenge to overcome. "I've had asthma my whole life", Kinsler said. "That 
was tough when I was younger. I woke up a lot and couldn't breathe, and 
had to go to the hospital in the middle of the night. It kind of held me 
back from athletics. I still have it, but I control it. Now I use an atomizer 
or an inhaler. When I was younger, I used this breathing machine… I hated 
that thing. I always wanted to run around and be active."[7] He graduated 
in 2000 from Canyon del Oro High School in the Tucson suburb of Oro Valley, 
Arizona.[4] Kinsler helped lead the baseball team to state titles in 1997 
and 2000. He hit .380 as a junior, to earn second-team All-League honors, 
and .504 with 5 home runs and 26 stolen bases during his senior year, in 
which he was named first-team All-State and first-team All-League.[8] Four 
of his high school teammates have also made it to the major leagues: Brian 
Anderson (his best friend in high school), Scott Hairston, Chris Duncan, 
and Shelly Duncan.[4][9] Kinsler was drafted by his home-state Arizona 
Diamondbacks after high school in 2000 (29th round), but did not feel ready 
for the pros. He opted instead to take a college tour. First (because he 
had not been recruited by any Division I programs) he attended Central 
Arizona College, where he hit .405 with 17 doubles, 37 RBIs, and 24 stolen 
bases, was named second-team All-ACCAC, and played shortstop alongside 
future major leaguers Scott Hairston and Rich Harden.[4] The Diamondbacks 
drafted him again in 2001 (26th round), but he declined to sign because 
he felt that playing college baseball a little longer would help him develop 
his game.[10] Arizona State coach Pat Murphy then convinced him to transfer 
to ASU in his sophomore year, promising that he would play shortstop for 
the Sun Devils. But while he started briefly alongside fellow middle infielder 
Dustin Pedroia, he ended up spending much of the season on the bench.[4][11] 
He was also teammates with Andre Ethier. University of Missouri Tigers 
coach Tim Jamison spotted him in a summer league, and convinced him to 
head east for his junior year. Jamison said: "I saw him take ground balls 
and thought, defensively, he was as good a middle infielder as I had ever 
seen. As for his bat, I didn't really care."[12] While there, Kinsler had 
a .335 batting average, .416 on-base percentage, and .536 slugging percentage, 
with 16 steals in 17 attempts.[13][14] He was named to the All-Big 12 Conference 
second team.[15] Jamison noted, "From the day Ian stepped through the doors 
here, you could see it on his face: He was on a mission."[4] Playing for 
the Tigers during the 2002 Fall World Series, he led all hitters with a 
.619 average (13-for-21).[16] Kinsler was then drafted a third time, by 
the Texas Rangers in the 17th round (496th overall) in 2003 as a shortstop, 
at the urging of area scout Mike Grouse.[17] Grouse liked Kinsler's tools, 
makeup, desire, and gritty approach.[13] In Grouse's scouting report, he 
wrote that Kinsler had a great feel for the game, athleticism, solid defensive 
skills, intensity, and leadership qualities. Grouse knew that Kinsler was 
probably being underrated by rival scouts, who did not know that Kinsler 
had played with a foot stress fracture while at Missouri, "so [Kinsler] 
really couldn't run like I knew he could. I'd seen him in Wichita the year 
before, so I knew he was a plus runner. Most people ... didn't know that, 
so they probably downgraded him. But I knew it, and I wasn't telling anybody."[17] 
Kinsler, for his part, says: "I thought I was a lot better than a 17th 
round pick. I thought I belonged in the top 10 rounds."[17] Kinsler nonetheless 
agreed to sign with the Rangers on his 21st birthday, for $30,000.[18] 
Five years later, John Sickels wrote: "Only a handful of players from the 
2003 draft are as good as Kinsler, and he's certainly outperformed many 
more heralded talents. Scouting and drafting will always be an inexact 
science/art."[19] The pick was later lauded as "one of the greatest 17th 
round picks of all time."[17] Kinsler signed quickly, and broke in as a 
shortstop in 2003. He batted .277 in 188 at-bats in his pro debut for the 
Spokane Indians in the Short-season Northwest League, while leading the 
team in steals (11) and triples (6).[13][20] He then spent the 2003–04 
winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' strength and conditioning 
coaches.[13] He said: "I was probably 170 pounds, and I decided I needed 
to lift, put on some weight, and eat as much as I could. And I learned 
how to hit."[10] By early 2004, Kinsler had vaulted to the # 1 spot on 
Baseball America's Prospect Hot Sheet. John Sickels of ESPN described him 
as having "great plate discipline, power, and ... [being] a reasonably 
good defensive shortstop."[13][21] He had a breakout year in 2004. He split 
the season between two teams, beginning with the Low-A Clinton Lumberkings, 
for which he hit .402/.465/.692 in 224 at bats.[22][23] Kinsler was voted 
to start at shortstop for the Midwest League Western Division All Star 
team, while he was leading the league in batting, on-base percentage, slugging 
percentage, hits, doubles, extra-base hits, and runs scored, but did not 
play as he was promoted.[24] Baseball America rated him the most exciting 
ballplayer and the # 8 prospect in the league. When a friend asked him 
what the secret was to his success, he responded: "Dude, I have no idea."[4] 
Kinsler was promoted two levels on June 12 to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. 
"When I first got called up, there were a million things running through 
my head", he said. "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really 
exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a little nervous that 
... all of a sudden I wouldn't be able to hit."[14] In June he was named 
the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month.[25] Frisco manager Tim Ireland 
observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. 
It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing 
work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. 
He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems 
pretty legit to me.[13] In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and 
prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, 
but Walker vetoed the trade.[26] He ended up hitting .300/.400/.480 for 
Frisco, in 277 at-bats.[22][23] Those numbers would have placed him fourth 
in OBP, seventh in slugging percentage, and eighth in the league's batting 
race had he received enough plate appearances to qualify for the title 
(he was short by about 60).[22] Baseball America rated Kinsler the # 9 
prospect in the Texas League.[27] Overall, in 501 at-bats, Kinsler tied 
for first in the minor leagues in doubles (51), and was seventh in batting 
average (.345) and ninth in hits (173). He also had 20 home runs, 103 runs, 
98 RBIs, 18 HBP, and 23 steals.[23] Rangers manager Buck Showalter marveled 
at Kinsler's 51 doubles, saying: "Fifty... A lot of guys don't have 50 
singles."[28] Baseball America rated him the No. 4 Rangers prospect, the 
No. 11 prospect in the minors, and a second-team Minor League All Star.[27][29][30][31] 
Kinsler was also named a Sports Weekly All Star, and the Rangers' Tom Grieve 
Minor League Player of the Year.[14][32] In addition, he was awarded the 
first annual Diamond in the Rough Award, which recognizes a minor leaguer 
who "defies the odds" and rises from obscurity to play himself into prospect 
status during a breakout season.[33] For his part, Kinsler noted simply: 
"It is fun to come to the ballpark every day when you are playing good 
baseball."[34] Towards the end of the season, Sickels augmented his scouting 
report on Kinsler by reporting that he was: a good athlete, not super-toolsy, 
but strong for his size with speed a notch above average. His swing looked 
short, quick, and sharp. Although I'm told that some people worry that 
his swing is too long, it looked fine to me. "Long swings" usually show 
up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a 
whiff king. He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without 
trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has 
some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base 
shots. He already has above-average power for a player his size, and I 
think he has enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels. 
Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and good hands. His 
arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally 
sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at 
Frisco). He might end up at second base eventually. Kinsler's running speed 
is a bit better than average, but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and 
will steal if the opportunity is there. Overall, he is a solid all-around 
player who makes the most of his natural ability.[35] Kinsler spent the 
winter of 2004–05 playing for the Peoria Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League, 
improving his versatility by getting work in at second base.[36] There, 
he hit .306/.369/.500.[22] One scout in Arizona noted that his swing was 
so effortless, yet generated so much line drive power, that: "It's like 
he's swinging a Wiffleball bat out there."[14] Invited to the parent club's 
2005 spring training, he hit .327 while slugging .612.[22] Kinsler spent 
2005 at Triple-A with the Oklahoma RedHawks, transitioning from shortstop 
to second base because that is where the organization anticipated he would 
play in the future, in the event that Alfonso Soriano no longer played 
second base for the major league team.[37][38] That was tough on Kinsler's 
ego initially, but the most difficult part of the switch for him was the 
double play.[39] He was selected to the mid-season Pacific Coast League 
All Star team in June, and came in a close second to Mitch Jones in the 
2005 Triple-A Home Run Derby.[40][41] For the season, in 530 at bats he 
hit .274 with 23 home runs, 102 runs (tied for tenth in the minor leagues), 
94 RBIs, and 12 steals in 14 attempts.[23] Kinsler cracked the Baseball 
America Top 100 Prospects list, ranking 98th.[42] On the side, during the 
season he kept an on-line journal for MinorLeagueBaseball.com.[43] With 
Alfonso Soriano having been traded in the off-season, Kinsler won the Rangers' 
starting second base job in spring training in 2006 over Mark DeRosa. "Ian 
Kinsler came as advertised", said Showalter.[44] He made his major league 
debut against the Boston Red Sox on Opening Day on April 3, 2006, and got 
his first major league hit in his first major league at bat, off Curt Schilling. 
Kinsler said: The crowd was full; I had the butterflies going, so to get 
that hit was huge. The family was in town.... To go out there and face 
one of the best pitchers of all time, you've got to be locked in. It's 
your first game, your first big league experience—it was unbelievable to 
face that guy.[45] He was hitting .476 when he dislocated his left thumb 
sliding head-first into second base on April 11, 2006, and was placed on 
the disabled list. "I knew it wasn't good when I looked down and I saw 
the top part of the thumb pointing in at me", Kinsler said.[46] He came 
back 41 games later on May 25, and went 3–4 with a single and two home 
runs, to lead the Rangers to an 8–7 victory over the Oakland Athletics. 
"I hope the fans don't expect that much every night", he joked.[47] While 
Kinsler started off the season batting ninth in the lineup, in June Showalter 
moved him up to seventh. "I think as Ian's career progresses, he'll move 
up in the batting order", predicted Showalter.[48] For the season, he started 
31 games batting seventh, 30 batting eighth, 20 batting sixth, 19 batting 
ninth, 12 batting second, 3 batting leadoff, 2 batting third, and 1 batting 
fifth.[49] Kinsler finished 2006 with a .286 batting average, 14 home runs, 
55 RBIs, and a team-leading 11 stolen bases in 423 at-bats.[50] He batted 
.300 with runners in scoring position, and .300 when the game was tied.[51] 
He led all AL rookies with 27 doubles, and his .454 slugging percentage 
was the seventh-best in a season since 2000 by an AL rookie with at least 
400 at bats.[52][53] Defensively, in August he tied a team record by recording 
five double plays in one game. He also led all American League (AL) second 
basemen in both range factor (5.58) and errors (18).[54] He was named Texas 
Rangers 2006 Rookie of the Year.[55] During the 2006–07 off-season, Kinsler 
focused on building up his legs to improve his speed, durability, and agility.[52] 
In spring training in 2007, he hit .429, led the AL in RBIs (19), and was 
sixth in the major leagues in hits (27).[56][57] His torrid hitting continued 
into the season, and Kinsler was named the AL Player of the Week for the 
period ending April 15. He batted .476 (10-for-21) that week with four 
home runs, eight RBIs, seven runs scored, and a 1.095 slugging percentage. 
His nine home runs in April tied the team record for that month (shared 
by Iván Rodríguez (2000), Alex Rodriguez (2002), and Carl Everett (2003)), 
and were the most ever in the season's first month by a Major League second 
baseman.[58][59] Kinsler said: "I'm trying to put good swings on the ball, 
and if it goes out, it goes out."[60] He batted .298 with 22 RBIs for the 
month, and was also voted the Rangers' Player of the Month for April.[58] 
On July 2, Kinsler went on the disabled list with a stress fracture in 
his left foot; he did not come back until July 31, and missed 26 games.[61] 
He tied a major league record on August 25, when he had eight plate appearances 
in a nine-inning game (a 30–3 win over Baltimore).[62] In 2007, Kinsler 
hit 20 home runs (leading all AL second basemen) and was 23-for-25 in stolen 
base attempts (a 92% success rate). He was one of only six batters in the 
AL to have at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, along with Alex Rodriguez, 
Gary Sheffield, Grady Sizemore, B.J. Upton, and Curtis Granderson. He also 
became the sixth player in franchise history to reach the 20–20 plateau, 
joining Alfonso Soriano (2005), Iván Rodríguez (1999), Rafael Palmeiro 
(1993), Bobby Bonds (1978), and Toby Harrah (1975 and 1977).[63][64] He 
did it despite his stress fracture, which kept him under 500 at bats.[65] 
His 23 stolen bases and 96 runs led the Rangers.[66] Kinsler finished the 
season seventh in the AL in power/speed number (21.4), ninth in sacrifice 
hits (8) and steals of third base (4), and tied for tenth in bunt hits 
(5). He was also tied for fourth in the league in steals of third (4), 
eighth in line drive percentage (23%), and tied for ninth in sacrifice 
hits (8).[67] He began to hit higher in the batting order, as he batted 
second in 48 games, leadoff in 26, seventh in 24, sixth in 19, ninth in 
10, and eighth in 2.[68] On defense, Kinsler led all major league second 
basemen in range factor (5.69), leading the league for the second straight 
year. In February 2008, Kinsler signed a five-year deal worth $22 million 
guaranteed. It will jump to $32 million if the Rangers exercise their $10 
million option for 2013. He received a raise to $500,000 in 2008, and a 
$1 million signing bonus. The contract went to $3 million in 2009 and $4 
million in 2010, and will go to $6 million in 2011 and $7 million in 2012.[needs 
update] If the Rangers choose not to exercise their $10 million option, 
Kinsler will receive a $500,000 buyout. If he is traded, both the buyout 
and the option year will increase by $500,000. If the option is exercised, 
the commitment will have been the largest the Rangers have ever made to 
a player whom they drafted and developed. "Ian represents the past, present, 
and future of this organization", said assistant general manager Thad Levine.[69] 
"It's a lot of money", Kinsler said. "I've never imagined being in this 
position in my life."[70] "This is a big day for me and my family", he 
reflected. "I've been working my whole life to get to this point, since 
my dad first started taking me out in the backyard and started throwing 
the baseball with me."[71] Asked what impact the money would have on him, 
Kinsler said: I'm going to play the same regardless of whether I'm making 
five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. 
I'm going to go out there and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. 
The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, 
it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how 
I played the game, and what I did on the field.[72] Kinsler was delighted 
when Rangers manager Ron Washington ultimately committed to Kinsler being 
the team's leadoff hitter in 2008. "I didn't think he was the prototype 
leadoff hitter, but the guy proved me wrong", Washington said. "He'll take 
a walk, or get one run for us with one swing of the bat. He can bunt, he 
can run, and he can hit the ball to the other side."[73] Through mid-May 
2008, Kinsler had the best career stolen-base percentage (88.5%) of anyone 
in Rangers/Senators history with at least 40 attempts. "It's part of my 
game", said Kinsler. "It's not one of the first things I'm known for."[74] 
According to scouts, his ability on the basepaths is due to innate instincts 
and his "twitch speed" rather than his pure running speed.[4] Grouse, who 
signed him, says that Kinsler also "goes from first to third faster than 
anyone, because he has that God-given ability to read the ball so well 
off the bat."[4] During a mid-June rain delay at Shea Stadium, Kinsler 
hopped to his feet, raced from the dugout and dove head-first across the 
wet tarp covering the infield as though it was a giant Slip 'n Slide. Four 
teammates followed, receiving a large ovation from the New York Mets fans. 
Shea Stadium security ushered them off the field, drawing a chorus of boos. 
"We had some good routines going", said Kinsler. "It was awesome."[75] 
Kinsler was a 2008 AL All Star at the 79th All Star Game at Yankee Stadium. 
It was his most exciting moment in baseball to that point.[76] He was a 
reserve voted in by his peers. In the fan balloting, Dustin Pedroia, who 
finished with nearly 1.3 million votes, beat him by 34,243 votes.[77] In 
the game, Kinsler hit 1-for-5 and stole a base. He was called out attempting 
to steal another base, though replays demonstrated that the umpire had 
missed the call.[78] The Washington Post and ESPN baseball writer Jayson 
Stark picked Kinsler as the AL MVP for the first half of the season.[79][80] 
Kinsler had an MLB-best 25-game hitting streak in June and July. The team-best 
hitting streak of 28 belongs to Gabe Kapler.[80] Through July 28, Kinsler 
was leading the AL in batting average (.331), runs (90), hits (145), total 
bases (232), extra base hits (55), at bats (438), and plate appearances 
(499). He was also second in doubles (37) and power/speed number (17.9), 
third in sacrifices (7), fourth in singles (90), sixth in sacrifice flies 
(6), seventh in stolen bases (26), triples (4), and on-base percentage 
(.392), and eighth in OPS (.922). "Kinsler", said Seattle Mariners left 
fielder Raúl Ibáñez, "is the engine that makes that offense go."[4] However, 
on August 17 he injured the left side of his groin on a defensive play, 
suffering a sports hernia that ultimately required season-ending surgery.[81] 
He missed the last 37 games of the season. "I really didn't have a decision", 
Kinsler said. "If I want to fix this injury, then I have to have surgery."[82] 
In 2008, despite missing the last six weeks of the season, Kinsler was 
third in the AL in times advanced from first to third on a single (17), 
fourth in batting average (.319) and power/speed number (21.3), fifth in 
steals of third base (8) and "bases taken" (23; advanced on fly balls, 
passed balls, wild pitches, balks, etc.), sixth in line drive percentage 
(24%) and in extra base hit percentage (10.8% of all plate appearances), 
eighth in runs (102) and OPS (.892), ninth in sacrifice hits (8) and home 
runs on the road (14), and tenth in stolen bases (26; while only being 
caught twice—a 93% success rate) and lowest strikeout percentage (11.5% 
of at bats).[83] He hit .413 with runners in scoring position.[84] He was 
one of only three batters in the AL to have at least 18 home runs and 18 
stolen bases in both 2007 and 2008, along with Alex Rodriguez and Grady 
Sizemore. His 41 doubles ranked second in franchise history to Alfonso 
Soriano's 43 in 2005. He had a .377 on-base percentage as a leadoff hitter, 
the third-best mark in the AL, and his .521 slugging percentage was the 
highest for a leadoff batter in the American League.[85] Kinsler's .381 
on-base percentage as a leadoff hitter over the 2005–08 seasons was the 
fourth-highest in the major leagues.[85] "Most hitters have [a location] 
that you can exploit", said All Star pitcher Justin Duchscherer. "This 
guy has trouble with fastballs in. This guy has trouble with breaking balls 
down. [Kinsler] doesn't have a hole like that."[4] In the field, he led 
all major league second basemen with a 5.77 range factor and 123 double 
plays, but also in errors with 18.[86] Kinsler was mentioned as an MVP 
candidate before his injury by writers at ESPN, the Dallas News, the Los 
Angeles Times, and the Washington Post.[79][87][88][89] He could have conceivably 
rivaled Pedroia for MVP, if not for the sports hernia that cut his 2008 
campaign short a month and a half.[90] "I think he just missed having an 
MVP year", manager Ron Washington said. "If luck [had been] on our side 
and he [had stayed] healthy, he would have run away with it."[85] In the 
end, he received a single 10th-place vote from Jeff Wilson of the Fort 
Worth Star-Telegram.[91][92] In 2009, Kinsler was named # 24 on the Sporting 
News' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 
baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and 
winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list.[93] 
"It was awesome. It was seriously one of the coolest things I've seen. 
I felt like a little kid. I was jumping up and down, screaming at the top 
of my lungs. It had no effect on him running the bases, but I felt like 
I was a part of it. It's one of those things you don't see very often. 
To hit the cycle and go 6-for-6. Six hits is a good week for some guys. 
At the same time, I'm not surprised because Kins is one of the best hitters 
I've seen. That's unbelievable." On April 15, 2009, in a game against the 
Baltimore Orioles, Kinsler hit for the cycle,[95] becoming only the fourth 
Ranger to do so (and, at the time, the only right-handed Ranger). In the 
same game, Kinsler became only the second player in Ranger history to get 
6 hits in a single game (the first having been Alfonso Soriano, on May 
8, 2004), and the first to do so in a 9-inning game. His five runs and 
four extra base hits in the game matched two other team records. "It was 
a thing of beauty", teammate Marlon Byrd said. "I loved it."[94] Kinsler's 
dual feat was the first in the modern baseball era. The last major league 
player to have six hits in a game while hitting for the cycle was William 
Farmer Weaver, for the Louisville Colonels on August 12, 1890.[96][97] 
Kinsler's 13 total bases were also one base shy of Jose Canseco's June 
13, 1994, team record. Only three other players in the prior 55 years had 
had six hits, five runs, and four extra-base hits in a game, the most recent 
having been Shawn Green of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2002.[98] Kinsler 
was named AL co-Player of the Week on April 20, 2009. For the week, in 
30 plate appearances he led the major leagues in batting average (.556), 
hits (15), extra base hits (7), and runs (9), and tied for the lead in 
doubles (4).[99][100] He also had a .600 on-base percentage and 1.000 slugging 
percentage, with a triple, two home runs, and six stolen bases. "He's incredible", 
said teammate Hank Blalock.[101] On June 16 against Houston, Kinsler opened 
the first inning with his ninth career leadoff homer, surpassing the club 
record of eight, shared by Mike Hargrove, Oddibe McDowell, and Michael 
Young.[102] On May 21, Kinsler stole third base in the fifth inning, setting 
a club record for career steals of third at 18. Furthermore, at the time 
Kinsler had never been caught trying to steal third.[103] Rick Paulas of 
ESPN called Kinsler his "first quarter MVP."[104] Through July 1, Kinsler 
led the AL in power-speed number (17.5), was third in home runs (19), fourth 
in runs (55) and total bases (160), sixth in extra base hits (38) and at 
bats (307), seventh in sacrifice flies (4), and ninth in stolen bases (16) 
and sacrifices (8), while batting .359 against left-handers and .333 with 
runners on base.[105][106] Kinsler narrowly missed making the AL All-Star 
team. First, though he had led all AL second basemen as of June 30, with 
2,170,100 fan votes (fifth-most votes of all AL players, just ahead of 
Dustin Pedroia's 2,163,270), Pedroia passed him on the last day in last-minute 
voting.[107][108] Then, he just missed making the team as a reserve in 
player voting, coming in second again, this time to Toronto's Aaron Hill.[109] 
He missed in his third chance, as AL All Star team and Tampa Bay manager 
Joe Maddon did not pick him as a reserve.[110] He missed a fourth opportunity 
to make the team, in the Sprint Final Vote competition for the final spot 
on the team, coming in second to Brandon Inge of the Tigers.[108] A fifth 
opportunity presented itself when Pedroia pulled out of the All Star Game 
to spend time with his pregnant wife—and as Kinsler had finished second 
in fan voting, in player voting, and in the Final Vote competition, he 
appeared a likely candidate to replace his fellow second baseman.[108] 
But Maddon went with one of his own to replace Pedroia, Tampa Bay's first 
baseman Carlos Peña, who was leading the league in homers but batting .228 
(and who had come in fourth in the Final Vote competition, behind Kinsler 
and Chone Figgins).[108][111] A sixth and final opportunity presented itself 
when Evan Longoria withdrew because of a finger infection; but again Maddon 
(a former Angels coach) chose someone else as a replacement, this time 
Figgins of the Angels, who had come in third in the Final Vote competition 
(behind Kinsler).[112] Bleacher Reports' Andrew Nuschler observed: "Maddon 
spent his tenure as the AL All Star manager finding new and inventive ways 
to give Ian Kinsler the middle finger."[113] And Sports Illustrated's Jacob 
Osterhout took note, writing: It is an absolute travesty that Ian Kinsler 
is not the starting second baseman for the American League. Dustin Pedroia, 
who IS the starting second baseman, has hit only three home runs and has 
36 RBIs. Kinsler, on the other hand, has hit 20 home runs and has 63 RBIs. 
The fact that Kinsler isn't even a reserve makes it hard to take the All 
Star Game seriously.[114] At the All Star Game, as a tribute to Kinsler, 
his teammate and close friend Michael Young wore wristbands with Kinsler's 
number 5.[115] On July 11, Kinsler stole third base for the 21st time in 
his career, building on his team record, without ever having been thrown 
out.[116] On July 19, he led off the bottom of the first inning with a 
home run, and 12 innings later he broke a 3–3 tie with a two-run, walk-off 
home run. Only four times before in major league history had the same batter 
led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run, and ended the game 
with another homer.[117] Kinsler suffered a strained left hamstring on 
July 28, and missed 11 games while on the disabled list.[118] Kinsler, 
who already had 30 stolen bases, hit his 30th home run on September 25, 
becoming the only major leaguer to join the 30–30 club in 2009, and the 
34th major leaguer ever.[119][120][121] He became only the second player 
in Rangers' history to have a 30–30 season (joining Alfonso Soriano, who 
did it in 2005), and joined Soriano (who also had 30–30 seasons in 2002 
and 2003 for the Yankees) and Brandon Phillips (2007) as the only 30–30 
second basemen in Major League history.[122] "It's an incredible accomplishment", 
said Michael Young. "I've played with guys who have had some incredible 
seasons here, but 30–30 is something special. He deserves a lot of credit. 
He battled all season long. That's what separates the great players from 
the good ones."[123] He led the AL in power-speed#, with a 31.0.[124] Through 
2009, he had the second-highest steal success rate among active players 
with at least 100 attempts, at 87.5% (91-of-104).[125] Carlos Beltrán was 
the best, at 88.3%.[125] Sharing his philosophy on stealing bases, he said: 
"It takes the art of stealing away if you do it when you're four runs up 
or four runs down, and the opposing team is just worried about getting 
outs, not stolen bases. The idea is to steal them when you need them."[126] 
He also showed a good eye at the plate. Of 15 Rangers who had at least 
100 at bats, his rate of only one strikeout per 8.31 at-bats was the best 
on the team.[127] Similarly, he made contact on 87% of his swings, the 
best contact rate on the team.[125] Playing 144 games, he also had 13 home 
runs against lefties (2nd in the league), stole third base 11 times (3rd), 
hit 47% of his hits for extra bases (7th-best in the AL), was 7th in the 
AL in stolen bases, scored 101 runs (10th), and had 5 bunt hits (10th).[128][129][130] 
On defense he led AL second baseman in "zone runs"s (17), was 2nd in assists 
(451) and range factor/game (4.86), and was 5th in putouts (249).[131] 
In December 2009, Washington said Kinsler would bat second in 2010. "I 
think Kinsler performs better when he's in the mix hitting at the top of 
the lineup in the first inning", Washington said. "When he has to wait 
to hit, I think it takes a lot away from him."[132] But by early March, 
it was reported that he would bat fifth.[121] Washington said, however, 
that that would not keep Kinsler from running: "I will not slow him down. 
He is a threat. I will not take away that threat. I'm not stopping Kins."[121] 
On days when Julio Borbon was not batting leadoff, Kinsler was to move 
up to the top of the lineup.[133] In the end, Kinsler started 60 games 
batting 3rd, 20 games batting 5th, 16 games batting 6th, and 6 games leading 
off.[134] In spring training, while he was batting .400, Kinsler slipped 
on a patch of wet grass during pre-game warm-ups.[135] He rolled his right 
ankle, and suffered a sprain of the ligaments above it (referred to as 
a "high ankle sprain"), as well as a small bone bruise at the tip of his 
tibia at the back of his ankle.[136][137][138][139][140] He missed three 
weeks of spring training, and began the season on the disabled list.[141] 
Washington said: "We miss his presence. We miss his threat. We miss what 
he brings on the defensive end. We miss his leadership."[142] He made his 
initial 2010 appearance on April 30, after having missed the first 20 games 
of the season.[141][143] Batting .304 at the time with a .412 on-base percentage 
(4th in the AL), he was selected as a reserve to the 2010 American League 
All Star team, his second All Star Game.[144][145][146] An appreciative 
Kinsler said: "It's a huge honor."[147] He had finished third among AL 
second basemen in fan voting behind Robinson Canó and Pedroia, but Pedroia 
was injured, and Kinsler was picked to replace him.[148][149] He had also 
finished second among AL second basemen in voting by AL players.[150] On 
July 29 he went on the disabled list again, this time for a strained left 
groin, and was not reactivated until September 1.[151] Kinsler finished 
the season batting .286, with a career-high on-base percentage of .382.[152] 
His .985 fielding percentage was 5th-best in the league, and he had the 
highest career range factor/game of all active major league second basemen 
(5.201).[152][153] With his two stints on the disabled list, he played 
in only 103 games.[154] In the first round of the playoffs, against the 
Tampa Bay Rays, Kinsler batted .444/.500/.944 in five games, leading the 
majors with 3 home runs (tied) and 6 RBIs in the division series.[155][156][157] 
He hit safely and scored a run in all five games, joining Boston's Nomar 
Garciaparra as the only two players to start their post-season careers 
with at least one hit—and with at least one hit and one run—in each of 
five consecutive games.[156][158][159] As teammate Nelson Cruz also hit 
three home runs, it marked the second time in Major League history that 
two teammates each hit three homers in a postseason series of five games 
or fewer (the other two to do it were Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, in the 
1928 World Series).[160] For the first two rounds of the playoffs, Kinsler 
hit safely in 9 of 11 games, and batted .342 with 3 HRs, a playoff-high 
9 RBIs, 6 runs, 2 stolen bases, an OBP of .409, and an OPS of 1.067.[161][162] 
On April 2, 2011, Kinsler became the first player in major league history 
to hit a lead-off home run in the first two games of a season (giving him 
a total of 15 lead-off homers in his career).[163] In his next game against 
the Red Sox, he hit another home run in the third inning. Kinsler and Nelson 
Cruz also became the first two teammates to homer in each of the first 
three games in a season.[164] The two also joined Dean Palmer (1992) as 
the only Texas ballplayers to ever homer in the first three games of the 
season.[164] In September Kinsler tied his own Rangers record, which he 
set in 2009, with his seventh leadoff home run of the season.[165] He also 
hit his 20th career leadoff homer, becoming the 34th player in major league 
baseball history to have hit at least 20.[166] Since his first season in 
2006, his 20 lead-off homers were the 6th-most behind Alfonso Soriano (31), 
Hanley Ramírez (25), Jimmy Rollins (24), Curtis Granderson (24), and Rickie 
Weeks (24).[166] He stole 28 consecutive bases without being caught, breaking 
his own club record, which he had set in 2007–08.[167][168] Kinsler joined 
the 30–30 club, for the second time.[169] He became the 12th player in 
major league history to have multiple 30–30 seasons.[169] The only other 
infielders in major league history who had had multiple 30–30 seasons as 
of 2011 were Alfonso Soriano, Howard Johnson, and Jeff Bagwell.[170] He 
also joined the 20 (home runs)/20 (steals) club for the third time in his 
career.[171] Joe Morgan, who did it four seasons, is the only second baseman 
to have joined the 20–20 club more times.[172] In 2011 Kinsler was 2nd 
in the American League in runs scored (121; the fifth-highest season total 
in Rangers' history), 5th in home runs (32; a career high) and walks (89), 
and 9th in stolen bases (30) and extra base hits (70).[173][174] He was 
also third in power-speed # (31.0; behind Jacoby Ellsbury and Curtis Granderson), 
and had the best walks-to-strikeouts ratio in the major leagues, with 1.25 
walks per each strikeout.[174][175][176] On defense, his career range factor 
of 5.092 was the highest among active major league second basemen, and 
in 2011 he led AL second basemen in double plays, with 103.[177][178] His 
136 career stolen bases through season-end were third-most in Rangers history, 
behind Bump Wills (161) and Toby Harrah (143), and his career stolen-base 
percentage was the third-best rate among active players with at least 120 
attempts.[179] His 124 career home runs were the 5th-most in the first 
six years of any second baseman's career, behind Dan Uggla (183), Joe Gordon 
(142), Chase Utley (130), and Alfonso Soriano (126).[180] On October 4, 
in Game 4 of the playoff series against the Rays, Kinsler led off the game 
with a home run, sparking the Rangers 4–3 victory over Tampa Bay to send 
them to the ALCS. Kinsler was an All Star again in 2012, for the third 
time.[181] For the season, he was second in the AL in plate appearances 
(731), third in at bats (655) and runs (105), fifth in power-speed number 
(20.0), sixth in doubles (42), and eighth in hit by pitch (10).[181] In 
2013, Kinsler struck out once every 10.4 plate appearances, making him 
the third-toughest batter to strike out in the American League, and was 
the sixth-toughest batter to double up in the league (109.0 at bats/double 
play).[182] He finished the season tied for fifth among active players 
in leadoff home runs.[182] He led the Texas Rangers, all-time, career-wise, 
in stolen bases (172), hit by pitch (57), and power-speed number (163.6), 
and was fifth in runs (748), seventh in doubles (249) and walks (462), 
eighth in home runs (156), and ninth in hits (1,145) and RBIs (539).[183][184] 
Fangraphs ranked him as the 56th-best baserunner in baseball history.[185] 
In November 2013, Kinsler was traded to the Detroit Tigers for Prince Fielder 
in a one-for-one trade of All-Stars, with the Tigers sending Texas $30 
million to cover part of the difference in the players' salaries.[186][187] 
There was an ESPN Sunday Night Baseball commercial in 2010 where Kinsler 
and Fielder were talking about trading each other for Tim Lincecum. In 
2014, Kinsler was named to his fourth All-Star team, as a replacement for 
an injured Victor Martinez.[188] For the season he led the American League 
in at bats (684), was 4th in hits (188) and doubles (40), 5th in runs scored 
(100; scoring 100 runs for the fifth time in his career), and 7th in power-speed 
number (15.9).[189][190] He was the 10th-toughest batter in the American 
League to strike out (once per every 9.19 plate appearances), and was one 
of seven AL players to hit at least 15 home runs and steal at least 15 
bases.[190] On defense, he led the AL in putouts (290) and was third in 
assists (467) and fielding percentage (.988), among all second basemen.[189][190] 
Through 2014, Kinsler had the best career range factor of any active second 
baseman in Major League Baseball, at 4.881.[191] On November 5, 2014, Kinsler 
was awarded the Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award for second base.[192] 
On September 10, Kinsler recorded his 1,500th career hit, a single off 
of Bryan Shaw of the Cleveland Indians.[193] For the 2015 season, he hit 
.296, his best batting average since posting a career-high .319 mark in 
2008, while collecting 11 home runs and 73 RBIs. Following the 2015 season, 
Kinsler was awarded the Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding second 
baseman in MLB. His 19 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) were six better than 
any other Major League second baseman this season, according to Fangraphs. 
His 6.3 Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR) was the best in the American League 
and second only to Miami's Dee Gordon. His 2.6 defensive Wins Above Replacement, 
according to the Baseball Reference formula, ranked him eighth among all 
Major League players regardless of position. Kinsler has put up 50 Defensive 
Runs Saved over the last three seasons, according to The Fielding Bible. 
The next-best total among Major League second basemen is 29 from Colorado's 
DJ LeMahieu.[194] On July 3, 2016, Kinsler hit his 200th career home run 
off Danny Farquhar of the Tampa Bay Rays. Kinsler became the third active 
Major League player, and the 40th overall, with 200 home runs, 1,000 runs 
scored, 1,600 hits and 200 stolen bases.[195][196] On September 12, Kinsler 
recorded his seventh lead-off home run of the season, tying the Tigers' 
franchise record set by Curtis Granderson.[197] On September 30 against 
the Atlanta Braves, Kinsler recorded his eighth leadoff home run of the 
season, to set a new Tigers' franchise record. The homer was also Kinsler's 
28th of the year, tying Lou Whitaker's 1989 record for most by a Tiger 
second baseman.[198] Along with the 28 home runs, Kinsler finished the 
2016 season with a .288 batting average, 117 runs and 83 RBI. Following 
the season, Kinsler was named the Gold Glove Award winner for second base, 
the first of his career. Kinsler and Dustin Pedroia finished tied for the 
lead among AL second basemen this season with 12 DRS. Kinsler's 8.5 UZR 
trailed only Pedroia (12.5).[199][200] Kinsler, who is Jewish,[201][202][203] 
and whose father is Jewish while his mother is Catholic,[204] has become 
a prominent figure in the Jewish community, and enjoys the attention that 
he attracts from it. He was featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary 
edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, licensed by Major League 
Baseball, commemorating the Jewish major leaguers from 1871 through 2008.[205] 
He joined, among others, teammate Scott Feldman, Brad Ausmus, Kevin Youkilis, 
Ryan Braun, Gabe Kapler, Jason Marquis, Jason Hirsh, John Grabow, Craig 
Breslow, and Scott Schoeneweis.[206][207] Kinsler was one of three Jewish 
players in the 2008 All Star Game, joining Youkilis and Braun.[208] He 
says that "Youkilis will always say something to me on the bases [referring 
to the fact that they are both Jewish]. 'Happy Passover,' he'll throw something 
at me."[209] In July 2013 he passed Shawn Green with his 163rd steal, to 
become the all-time career steals leader among Jewish major leaguers.[210][211] 
Kinsler, who would have been eligible to play for Israel in the 2013 World 
Baseball Classic because of his Jewish heritage, said: "Wow, I would be 
happy to play for Team Israel.... The truth is that if a proposal comes 
from Team USA to play for them, I will have a very difficult decision to 
make. Youk [Kevin Youkilis], Braun [Milwaukee's Ryan Braun], and I could 
make a fantastic team. I am sure that I'll talk it over with Youk – we 
always laugh about things like this."[212] Kinsler married Tess Brady, 
his high school sweetheart, on November 18, 2006.[213][214] Their daughter, 
Rian Brooklynn Kinsler, was born December 5, 2008.[1] On June 8, 2011, 
his wife gave birth to a son, Jack Jamisson Kinsler. He was put on paternity 
leave due to the birth.[215][216] In 2008 Kinsler won the Rangers' Jim 
Sundberg Community Achievement Award, in recognition of his having devoted 
a great deal of his personal time to the community.[217] Ruttman, Larry

This chapter in Ruttman's oral history, based on a September 2, 2011 interview 
conducted with Kinsler for the book, discusses Kinsler's American, Jewish,
