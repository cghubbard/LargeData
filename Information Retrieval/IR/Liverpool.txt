Liverpool (/ˈlɪvərpuːl/), in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan 
borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015.[4] Liverpool and 
its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, 
with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011.[5] The local 
authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government 
district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within 
the Liverpool City Region. Liverpool historically lay within the ancient 
hundred of West Derby in the south west of the county of Lancashire.[6][7] 
It became a borough from 1207 and a city from 1880. In 1889 it became a 
county borough independent of Lancashire. Liverpool sits on the eastern 
side of the Mersey Estuary and its growth as a major port is paralleled 
by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution. Along 
with general cargo, freight, raw materials such as coal and cotton, the 
city was also directly involved in Atlantic slave trade. Liverpool was 
home to both the Cunard and White Star Line, and was the port of registry 
of the ocean liner RMS Titanic and others such as the RMS Lusitania, Queen 
Mary, and Olympic. The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007, and 
it held the European Capital of Culture title together with Stavanger, 
Norway, in 2008.[8] Several areas of Liverpool city centre were granted 
World Heritage Site status by UNESCO in 2004. The Liverpool Maritime Mercantile 
City includes the Pier Head, Albert Dock, and William Brown Street.[9] 
Tourism forms a significant part of the city's economy. Labelled the "World 
Capital City of Pop" by Guinness World Records, the popularity of The Beatles 
and other groups from the Merseybeat era and later contributes to Liverpool's 
status as a tourist destination. Liverpool is also the home of two Premier 
League football clubs, Liverpool and Everton, matches between the two being 
known as the Merseyside derby. The world-famous Grand National horse race 
takes place annually at Aintree Racecourse on the outskirts of the city. 
Liverpool's status as a port city has contributed to its diverse population, 
which, historically, was drawn from a wide range of peoples, cultures, 
and religions, particularly those from Ireland and Wales. The city is also 
home to the oldest Black African community in the country and the oldest 
Chinese community in Europe. Natives of Liverpool are referred to as Liverpudlians 
(or less commonly Liverpolitans) and colloquially as "Scousers", a reference 
to "scouse", a form of stew.[10] The word "Scouse" has also become synonymous 
with the Liverpool accent and dialect.[nb 1] Pool is a common place name 
element in England from the Brythonic word for a pond, inlet, or pit, (cognate 
with the modern Welsh pwll). The derivation of the first element remains 
uncertain, with the Welsh word Llif (an old name for the Atlantic Ocean 
also meaning flood, flow or current) as the most plausible relative. This 
etymology is supported by its similarity to that of the archaic Welsh name 
for Liverpool Llynlleifiad (the lake/pool that floods/overflows).[11] Other 
origins of the name have been suggested, including "elverpool", a reference 
to the large number of eels in the Mersey.[12] The name appeared in 1190 
as "Liuerpul",[13] and it may be that the place appearing as Leyrpole, 
in a legal record of 1418, refers to Liverpool.[14] King John's letters 
patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool,[15] 
but by the middle of the 16th century the population was still only around 
500. The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed 
by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making 
it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in an H shape: Bank 
Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler 
Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre 
Street (now Old Hall Street). In the 17th century there was slow progress 
in trade and population growth. Battles for the town were waged during 
the English Civil War, including an eighteen-day siege in 1644. In 1699 
Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament, that same year its first 
slave ship, Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa. Since Roman times, 
the nearby city of Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal 
port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade 
from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool 
on the neighbouring River Mersey. As trade from the West Indies surpassed 
that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, 
Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial 
wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715.[16][17] Substantial profits from 
the slave trade helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several 
prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward 
Rushton, were at the forefront of the abolitionist movement. By the start 
of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, 
and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, 
Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail 
link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued 
to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began 
arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine. 
Given the crucial place of both cotton and slavery in the city's economy, 
during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian 
Sven Beckert, "the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the 
Confederacy itself."[18] For periods during the 19th century, the wealth 
of Liverpool exceeded that of London,[19] and Liverpool's Custom House 
was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer.[20] Liverpool's 
status can be judged from the fact that it was the only British city ever 
to have its own Whitehall office.[21] In the early 19th century, Liverpool 
played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of 
which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the 
city.[22] As early as 1851 the city was described as "the New York of Europe".[23] 
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was drawing immigrants 
from across Europe. This resulted in construction of a diverse array of 
religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, 
many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek 
Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue 
were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, 
Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's 
oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, served the 
Polish community in its final years as a place of worship. The postwar 
period was marked by social unrest as society grappled with the massive 
war losses of young men, as well as trying to integrate veterans into the 
economy. Union organizing and strikes took place in numerous locations, 
including police strikes in London among the Metropolitan Police. Numerous 
colonial soldiers and sailors who had served with the UK settled in Liverpool 
and other port cities. In June 1919 they were subject to attack by whites 
in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and 
both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and 
housing. In this period, race riots also took place in Cardiff, Newport 
and Barry, and there had been incidents in Glasgow, South Shields, London, 
Hull and Salford.[24] There were so many racial riots that summer in major 
cities of the United States[24] that a black leader termed it Red Summer. 
There were also riots in Caribbean and South African cities in that first 
postwar year.[24] The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing 
being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of families 
were relocated from the inner-city to new suburban housing estates, based 
on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though 
this is largely subjective. Numerous private homes were also built during 
this era. The Great Depression of the early 1930s saw unemployment in the 
city peak at around 30%. Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial 
airport, operating from 1930. This was the first British airport to be 
renamed after an individual: the late singer and composer John Lennon of 
the Beatles, an internationally known band beginning in the early 1960s, 
who was murdered in New York City.[25] During the Second World War, the 
critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler 
and Churchill, with the city suffering a blitz second only to London's.[26] 
The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.[27] 
Germans made 80 air-raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing 
damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding 
followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, 
the largest dock project in Britain. Much of the immediate reconstruction 
of the city centre has been deeply unpopular. It was as flawed as much 
subsequent town planning renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. The historic portions 
of the city that survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction 
during urban renewal. Since 1952 Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, 
Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. 
Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home 
to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World 
War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. A 
significant West Indian black community existed in the city since the first 
two decades of the 20th century. More immigrants arrived after World War 
II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth, where housing 
was less expensive. The construction of suburban public housing expanded 
after the Second World War. Some of the older inner city areas were redeveloped 
for new homes. In the 1960s Liverpool was the centre of the "Merseybeat" 
sound, which became synonymous with The Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian 
rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they 
also strongly affected American music for years and were internationally 
popular. Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, 
Liverpool in 1974 became a metropolitan borough within the newly created 
metropolitan county of Merseyside. From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's 
docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into sharp decline 
due to restructuring of shipping and industry, causing massive losses of 
jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became 
largely obsolete, and dock workers were thrown out of jobs. By the early 
1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK,[28] 
standing at 17% by January 1982. This was about half the level of unemployment 
that had affected the city during the Great Depression 50 years previously.[29] 
In the later 19th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. Since 
the mid-1990s the city has enjoyed growth rates higher than the national 
average. At the end of the 20th century Liverpool was concentrating on 
regeneration, a process which continues today. To celebrate the Golden 
Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised 
a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final 
choice. Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as The 
Beatles, as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, 
tourism has also become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy. In 
2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a £920 m 
development based on Paradise Street> This produced the most significant 
changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed 
'Liverpool ONE,' the centre opened in May 2008. In 2007, the city celebrated 
the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool, for 
which a number of events were planned. Liverpool was designated as a joint 
European Capital of Culture for 2008. The main celebrations, in September 
2008, included erection of La Princesse, a large mechanical spider 20 metres 
high and weighing 37 tonnes, and represents the "eight legs" of Liverpool: 
honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and 
culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, 
and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel. Spearheaded by the multi-billion-pound 
Liverpool ONE development, regeneration has continued through to the start 
of the early 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects 
include new buildings in the Commercial District, the King's Dock, Mann 
Island, the Lime Street Gateway, the Baltic Triangle, the RopeWalks, and 
the Edge Lane Gateway. All projects could be eclipsed by the Liverpool 
Waters scheme, which if built will cost in the region of £5.5billion and 
be one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Liverpool Waters 
is a mixed-use development planned to contain one of Europe's largest skyscraper 
clusters. The project received outline planning permission in 2012, despite 
fierce opposition from such groups as UNESCO, which claimed that it would 
adversely affect Liverpool's World Heritage status. On 9 June 2014, Prime 
Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business 
in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014,[30] and the largest 
in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951.[31] Liverpool has been 
a center of industrial and later innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships, 
municipal trams,[32] electric trains[33] were all pioneered in Liverpool 
as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836 the first railway tunnels in 
the world were constructed under Liverpool. From 1950 to 1951, the world's 
first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and 
Cardiff.[34] The first School for the Blind,[35] Mechanics' Institute,[36] 
High School for Girls,[37][38] council house[39] and Juvenile Court[40] 
were all founded in Liverpool. The RSPCA,[41] NSPCC,[42] Age Concern,[43] 
Relate, Citizen's Advice Bureau[44] and Legal Aid all evolved from work 
in the city. In the field of public health, the first lifeboat station, 
public baths and wash-houses,[45] sanitary act,[46] medical officer for 
health, district nurse, slum clearance,[47] purpose-built ambulance,[48] 
X-ray medical diagnosis,[49] school of tropical medicine, motorised municipal 
fire-engine,[50] free school milk and school meals,[51] cancer research 
centre,[52] and zoonosis research centre[53] all originated in Liverpool. 
The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross, professor 
at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the 
world.[54] Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen 
Thomas,[55] and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray. The world's 
first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands, 
appointedin 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer.[56][57] In finance, 
Liverpool founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association[58] and the 
first Institute of Accountants. The Western world's first financial derivatives 
(cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 
1700s.[59] In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library, 
athenaeum society, arts centre[60] and public art conservation centre.[61] 
Liverpool is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra, 
the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra,[62] as well as the oldest surviving 
repertory theatre, the Liverpool Playhouse.[63] In 1864, Peter Ellis built 
the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers, 
the prototype of the skyscraper. The UK's first purpose-built department 
store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey;[64] 
it was the largest store in the world at the time.[65] Between 1862 and 
1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John 
Hulley and Charles Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur 
in nature and international in outlook.[66][67] The programme of the first 
modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool 
Olympics.[68] In 1865 Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association 
in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles 
of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter. 
Shipowner Sir Alfred Lewis Jones introduced the banana to Great Britain 
in 1884.[69] The Mersey Railway, opened in 1886, incorporated the world's 
first tunnel under a tidal estuary[70] and the world's first deep-level 
underground stations. In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented 
the football goal-net. He also was a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated 
housing. Brodie oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road, the 
UK's first intercity highway, as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool 
and Birkenhead. Described as "the eighth wonder of the world" at the time 
of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world, 
a title it held for 24 years. In 1897, the Lumière brothers filmed Liverpool,[71] 
including what is believed to be the world's first tracking shot,[72] taken 
from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the world's first elevated electrified 
railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use 
electric multiple units, the first to employ automatic signalling, and 
the first to install an escalator. Liverpool inventor Frank Hornby was 
a visionary in toy development and manufacture; he produced three of the 
most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways 
and Dinky Toys. The British Interplanetary Society, founded in Liverpool 
in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation 
devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal is the longest-running 
astronautical publication in the world.[73] In 1999, Liverpool was the 
first city outside the capital to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage 
in recognition of the "significant contribution made by its sons and daughters 
in all walks of life."[74] Liverpool has several tiers of government; the 
Mayor and Local Council, who are also stakeholders in the Liverpool City 
Region Combined Authority, the National Government and the European Parliament. 
Liverpool is officially governed by a Unitary Authority, as when Merseyside 
County Council was disbanded civic functions were returned to a district 
borough level. However several services such as the Police and Fire and 
Rescue Service, continue to be run at a county-wide level. The City of 
Liverpool is governed by the Directly elected mayor of Liverpool and Liverpool 
City Council, and is one of six metropolitan boroughs that combine to make 
up the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor is elected by the citizens of Liverpool 
every four years and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the council. 
The council's 90 elected councillors who represent local communities throughout 
the city, are responsible for scrutinising the Mayor's decisions, setting 
the Budget, and policy framework of the city. The Mayor's responsibility 
is to be a powerful voice for the city both nationally and internationally, 
to lead, build investor confidence, and to direct resources to economic 
priorities.[75] The Mayor also exchanges direct dialogue with government 
ministers and the Prime minister through his seat at the 'Cabinet of Mayors'. 
Discussions include pressing decision makers in the government on local 
issues as well as building relationships with the other Directly elected 
mayors in England and Wales.[76] The mayor is Joe Anderson. The city of 
Liverpool effectively has two Mayors. As well as the directly elected Mayor, 
there is the ceremonial 'Lord Mayor' (or civic Mayor) who is elected by 
the full city council at its annual general meeting in May, and stands 
for one year in office. The Lord Mayor acts as the 'first citizen' of Liverpool 
and is responsible for promoting the city, supporting local charities and 
community groups as well as representing the city at civic events.[77] 
The Lord Mayor is Councillor Frank Prendergast.[78] For local elections 
the city is split into 30 local council wards,[79] which in alphabetical 
order are: During the most recent local elections, held in May 2011, the 
Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following 
on from regaining power for the first time in 12 years, during the previous 
elections in May 2010.[80] The Labour Party gained 11 seats during the 
election, taking their total to 62 seats, compared with the 22 held by 
the Liberal Democrats. Of the remaining seats the Liberal Party won three 
and the Green Party claimed two. The Conservative Party, one of the three 
major political parties in the UK had no representation on Liverpool City 
Council.[80][81] In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was revealed 
to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one 
star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating 
was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including 
the accumulation of a £20m shortfall on Capital of Culture funding.[82] 
While Liverpool through most of the 19th and early 20th Century was a municipal 
stronghold of Toryism, support for the Conservative Party recently has 
been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist 
economic policies of prime minister Margaret Thatcher after her 1979 general 
election victory contributed to high unemployment in the city which did 
not begin to fall for many years.[83] Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's 
key strongholds; however the city has seen hard times under Labour governments 
as well, particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 
1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest 
of the United Kingdom but also suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune 
of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied.[84] 
The City of Liverpool is one of the six constituent local government districts 
of the Liverpool City Region. Since 1 April 2014, some of the city's responsibilities 
have been pooled with neighbouring authorities within the metropolitan 
area and subsumed into the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The 
combined authority has effectively become the top-tier administrative body 
for the local governance of the city region and The Mayor of Liverpool, 
along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, 
take strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment 
and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. As of 
July 2015, negotiations are currently taking place between the UK national 
government and the combined authority over a possible devolution deal to 
confer greater powers on the region. Discussions include whether to introduce 
an elected ‘Metro Mayor’ to oversee the entire metropolitan area.[85] Liverpool 
has four parliamentary constituencies entirely within the city, through 
which members of parliament (MPs) are elected to represent the city in 
Westminster: Liverpool Riverside, Liverpool Walton, Liverpool Wavertree 
and Liverpool West Derby.[86] At the last general election, all were won 
by Labour with representation being from Louise Ellman, Steve Rotheram, 
Luciana Berger and Stephen Twigg respectively. Due to boundary changes 
prior to the 2010 election, the Liverpool Garston constituency was merged 
with most of Knowsley South to form the Garston and Halewood cross-boundary 
seat. At the most recent election this seat was won by Maria Eagle of the 
Labour Party.[87] Liverpool has been described as having "the most splendid 
setting of any English city."[88] At 53°24′0″N 2°59′0″W﻿ / ﻿53.40000°N 
2.98333°W﻿ / 53.40000; -2.98333 (53.4, −2.98), 176 miles (283 km) northwest 
of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea the city of Liverpool 
is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around 
230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern 
boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain. The Mersey Estuary separates 
Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent 
to Bootle, Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby, 
Huyton, Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east. Liverpool experiences 
a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively 
cool summers and mild winters. Historically, Bidston Observatory (actually 
located on the Wirral Peninsula) has provided the longest and most unbroken 
weather data for the Merseyside area. More recently, the Met Office has 
operated a weather station at Crosby. The absolute minimum temperature 
recorded at Bidston was −12.8 °C (9.0 °F) during January 1881, typically 
the coldest night of the year should fall to −4.0 °C (24.8 °F) (1971–2000 
average) However, the variability of the local climate was exposed as the 
weather station at Crosby fell to −17.6 °C (0.3 °F)[89] during December 
2010. The absolute maximum temperature recorded at Bidston was 34.5 °C 
(94.1 °F) in August 1990 – typically the warmest day of the year should 
reach 27.5 °C (81.5 °F) (1971–2000 average). The absolute maximum at Crosby 
is 33.5 °C (92.3 °F), recorded in July 2006.[90] Liverpool's moderated 
oceanic climate is in stark contrast to temperatures expected in continental 
Europe both at the same latitude as well as latitudes much further north, 
with very small swings between seasons in comparison. For example, areas 
in continental Scandinavia much further north experience hotter summers 
with longer heatwaves, whilst Liverpool just like the rest of the British 
Isles lacks a regular snowy winter, in spite of its geographically northerly 
location. In 2010 Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust Commissioned 
The Mersey Forest to complete A Green Infrastructure Strategy for the City.[96] 
At the 2011 UK Census the recorded population of Liverpool was 466,415, 
a 6.1% increase on the figure of 439,473 recorded in the 2001 census.[98] 
The population of the Liverpool area peaked in the 1930s with 846,101 recorded 
in the 1931 census.[97] As with many British cities including London and 
Manchester, the city centre covered by the Liverpool council area had experienced 
negative population growth since the 1931 census. Much of the population 
loss was as a result of large-scale resettlement programmes to nearby areas 
introduced in the aftermath of the Second World War, with towns such as 
Kirkby, Skelmersdale and Runcorn seeing a corresponding rise in their populations 
(Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).[99] 
Liverpool's population is younger than that of England as a whole, with 
42.3 per cent of its population under the age of 30, compared to an English 
average of 37.4 per cent.[100][not in citation given] As of July 2014[update], 
66 per cent of the population was of working age.[100] Liverpool is the 
largest local authority by populace, GDP and area in Merseyside. Liverpool 
and is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside area for the purpose 
of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. 
Liverpool is defined as a standalone NUTS3 area by the ONS for statistical 
purpose, and makes up part of the NUTS2 area "Merseyside" along with East 
Merseyside (Knowsley, St Helens and Halton), Sefton and the Wirral. The 
population of this area was 1,513,306 based on 2014 estimates. The "Liverpool 
Urban Area" is a term used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) 
to denote the urban area around the city to the east of the River Mersey. 
The contiguous built-up area extends beyond the area administered by Liverpool 
City Council into adjoining local authority areas, particularly parts of 
Sefton and Knowsley. As defined by ONS, the area extends as far east as 
Haydock and St. Helens. Unlike the Metropolitan area, the Urban Area does 
not include The Wirral or its contiguous areas.[101] The population of 
this area as of 2011 was 864,211. The "Liverpool City Region" is an economic 
partnership between local authorities in Merseyside under the umbrella 
of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority as defined by the Mersey 
Partnership. The area covers Merseyside and the Borough of Halton and has 
an estimated population between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 and.[102] In 2006 
ESPON (now (European Observation Network for Territorial Development and 
Cohesion) released a study defining a "Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan 
area" as a functional urban area consisting of contiguous urban areas, 
labour pool, and commuter "Travel To Work Areas". The analysis grouped 
the Merseyside metropolitan county with the borough of Halton, Wigan in 
Greater Manchester, the city of Chester as well as number of towns in Lancashire 
and Cheshire including Ormskirk and Warrington, estimating the polynuclear 
metropolitan area to have a population of 2,241,000 people.[103] Liverpool 
and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan 
area,[104][105][106] or megalopolis.[107] According to data from the 2011 
census, 84.8 per cent of Liverpool's population was White British, 1.4 
per cent White Irish, 2.6 per cent White Other, 4.1 per cent Asian or Asian 
British (including 1.1 per cent British Indian and 1.7 per cent British 
Chinese), 2.6 per cent Black or Black British (including 1.8 per cent Black 
African) and 2.5 per cent mixed-race. 1.8 per cent of respondents were 
from other ethnic groups.[2] Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest Black 
community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Black Liverpudlians can trace 
their ancestors in the city back ten generations.[108] Early Black settlers 
in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, 
and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed 
free men.[109] Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its 
large African-Caribbean,[110] Ghanaian,[111] and Somali[112] communities, 
formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent 
generations. The city is home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; 
the first residents of the city's Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th 
century.[113] The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown 
is the largest gateway outside of China. The city is also known for its 
large Irish population and its historically large Welsh population.[114] 
In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the 
city becoming known as "the capital of North Wales."[114] Following the 
start of the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million 
Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently 
departing for the United States.[115] By 1851, more than 20 per cent of 
the population of Liverpool was Irish.[116] At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per 
cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the 
Republic of Ireland, while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland,[117] 
but many more Liverpudlians are of Welsh or Irish ancestry. Other contemporary 
ethnicities include Indian,[110] Latin American,[118] Malaysian,[119] and 
Yemeni.[120] communities, which number several thousand each. The thousands 
of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious 
diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally 
diverse collection of religious buildings,[121] including two Christian 
cathedrals. Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with 
a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.[122] 
The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas, 
colloquially known as "the sailors church", which has existed near the 
waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other 
notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built 
in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolf Church (the 
Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles). Liverpool's wealth 
as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 
20th century. The Anglican Cathedral, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert 
Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, has 
one of the longest naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals 
of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, on Mount 
Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park, was initially planned to be even 
larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens' original design, only the crypt was completed. 
The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick 
Gibberd. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design 
it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. 
The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street, a coincidence 
which pleases believers. The cathedral is colloquially referred to as "Paddy's 
Wigwam" due to its shape.[123][nb 2] Liverpool contains several synagogues, 
of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally 
the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent 
of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings 
in Liverpool.[124] Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further 
two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a 
second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish 
community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area 
of L17 has recently closed, and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also 
a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish 
community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool 
is around 5,000.[125] The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 
until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue. Liverpool 
also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane, Edge Hill. The 
Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool 
is located there.[126] Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara 
in Wavertree[127] and a Bahá'í Centre in the same area.[128] The city had 
the earliest mosque in England, and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by 
William Abdullah Quilliam, a lawyer who had converted to Islam, and set 
up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road.[129] 
The building was used as a house of worship until 1908, when it was sold 
to the City Council and converted into offices.[130] Plans have been accepted 
to re-convert the building where the mosque once stood into a museum.[131] 
There are three mosques in Liverpool: the largest and main one, Al-Rahma 
mosque, in the Toxteth area of the city and a mosque recently opened in 
the Mossley Hill district of the city. The third mosque was also recently 
opened in Toxteth and is on Granby Street. Liverpool has a large lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, or transgender/transsexual community. The Economy of Liverpool 
is one of the largest within the United Kingdom, sitting at the centre 
of one of the two core economies within the North West of England.[132] 
In 2006, the city's GVA was £7,626 million, providing a per capita figure 
of £17,489, which was above the North West average.[133] Liverpool's economy 
has seen strong growth since the mid-1990s, with its GVA increasing 71.8% 
between 1995 and 2006 and employment increasing 12% between 1998 and 2006.[133] 
GDP per capita was estimated to stand at $32,121 in 2014, and total GDP 
at $65.8 billion.[134] In common with much of the rest of the UK today, 
Liverpool's economy is dominated by service sector industries, both public 
and private. In 2007, over 60% of all employment in the city was in the 
public administration, education, health, banking, finance and insurance 
sectors.[133] Over recent years there has also been significant growth 
in the knowledge economy of Liverpool with the establishment of the Liverpool 
Knowledge Quarter in sectors such as media and life sciences.[135] Liverpool's 
rich architectural base has also helped the city become the second most 
filmed city in the UK outside London,[136] including doubling for Chicago, 
London, Moscow, New York, Paris and Rome.[137][138] Another important component 
of Liverpool's economy are the tourism and leisure sectors. Liverpool is 
the 6th most visited city in the United Kingdom[139] and one of the 100 
most visited cities in the world by international tourists.[140] In 2008, 
during the city's European Capital of Culture celebrations, overnight visitors 
brought £188m into the local economy,[139] while tourism as a whole is 
worth approximately £1.3bn a year to Liverpool.[138] The city's new cruise 
liner terminal, which is situated close to the Pier Head, also makes Liverpool 
one of the few places in the world where cruise ships are able to berth 
right in the centre of the city.[141] Other recent developments in Liverpool 
such as the Echo Arena and Liverpool One have made Liverpool an important 
leisure centre with the latter helping to lift Liverpool into the top five 
retail destinations in the UK.[142] Historically, the economy of Liverpool 
was centred on the city's port and manufacturing base, although a smaller 
proportion of total employment is today derived from the port.[133] Nonetheless 
the city remains one of the most important ports in the United Kingdom, 
handling over 32.2m tonnes of cargo in 2008.[143] A new multimillion-pound 
expansion to the Port of Liverpool, Liverpool2, is scheduled to be operational 
from the end of 2015, and is projected to greatly increase the volume of 
cargo which Liverpool is able to handle.[144] Liverpool is also home to 
the UK headquarters of many shipping lines including Japanese firm NYK 
and Danish firm Maersk Line, whilst shipping firm Atlantic Container Line 
has recently invested significant amounts in expanding its Liverpool operations, 
with a new headquarters currently under construction.[145][146][147] Future 
plans to redevelop the city's northern dock system, in a project known 
as Liverpool Waters, could see £5.5bn invested in the city over the next 
50 years, creating 17,000 new jobs.[148] Car manufacturing also takes place 
in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant where the Range Rover 
Evoque model is assembled. Liverpool's history means that there are a considerable 
variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th 
century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture.[149] The 
majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, 
the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in 
the British Empire.[150] There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, 
of which 27 are Grade I listed[151] and 85 are Grade II* listed.[152] The 
city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location 
in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster[153] and more Georgian houses 
than the city of Bath.[154] This richness of architecture has subsequently 
seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian 
city.[155] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised 
in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO 
World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the 
sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of 
international trade and docking technology.[156] As a major British port, 
the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. 
Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction 
of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first 
ever hydraulic lifting cranes.[157] The best-known dock in Liverpool is 
the Albert Dock, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the 
largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain.[158] 
Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered to be one 
of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is 
often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important 
ports in the world. The Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two 
hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery 
Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre 
is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was 
at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in 
terms of area[159] and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.[160] 
One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned 
for the trio of buildings – the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building 
and the Port of Liverpool Building – which sit upon it. Collectively referred 
to as the Three Graces, these buildings stand as a testament to the great 
wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in 
a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol 
of Maritime Liverpool, and are regarded by many as contributing to one 
of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.[161][162][163][164] In 
recent years, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone 
significant redevelopment. Amongst the notable recent developments are 
the Museum of Liverpool, the construction of the Echo Arena Liverpool and 
BT Convention Centre on Kings Dock, Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock 
on Prince's Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks. 
The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010.[165][166] Liverpool's historic 
position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant 
that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as 
headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large 
firms. The great wealth this brought, then allowed for the development 
of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators 
to 'run the city with pride'.[167] The commercial district is centred on 
the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with 
many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having 
developed over a period of three centuries the area is regarded as one 
of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised 
by its inclusion in Liverpool's World Heritage site.[168] The oldest building 
in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall, which is located 
at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the 
city's finest piece of Georgian architecture, the building is noted as 
one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.[169][170] 
Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building, constructed 
between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the 
national bank.[169] Amongst the other noted buildings in the area are the 
Tower Buildings, Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), 
the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers,[171] which is considered to 
be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.[172] The area 
around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', 
owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William 
Brown Library, Walker Art Gallery, Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum 
Liverpool. The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which 
the most prominent, St George's Hall,[173] is widely regarded as the best 
example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.[174] A Grade I 
listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety 
of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with "S.P.Q.L." 
(Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis), meaning "the senate and people 
of Liverpool". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments 
and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain. 
Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens, 
which was specifically developed for this purpose.[175] The William Brown 
Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.[176] 
While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th 
century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One 
of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located 
in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.[177] The building 
is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north 
of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interior, which 
was added in the mid-19th century.[178] In addition to Speke Hall, many 
of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses 
including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 
and 1704 respectively.[179] The oldest building within the city centre 
is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers,[180] which was built between 1717 
and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style,[181][182] the building 
was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren[183] and was originally 
the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to larger site in the 
south of the city). Since 1908 it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.[181] 
Liverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over 
the landscape around it.[184] The Anglican Cathedral, which was constructed 
between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain[185] and the 
fifth largest in the world. Designed and built in Gothic style, it is regarded 
as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th 
century[186] and was described by former British Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, 
as 'one of the great buildings of the world'.[187] The Roman Catholic Metropolitan 
Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is noted as one of 
the first Cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.[188] 
In recent years, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant 
redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. The largest of these 
developments has been Liverpool One, which has seen almost £1 billion invested 
in the redevelopment of 42 acres (170,000 m2) of land, providing new retail, 
commercial, residential and leisure space.[189] Around the north of the 
city centre several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including 
the RIBA award winning Unity Buildings and West Tower, which at 140m is 
Liverpool's tallest building. Many future redevelopment schemes are also 
planned including Central Village (planning permission granted),[190] the 
Lime Street gateway (work started)[191] and the highly ambitious Liverpool 
Waters (early planning stage).[192] There are many other notable buildings 
in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke 
Airport, the University of Liverpool's Victoria Building, (which provided 
the inspiration for the term Red Brick University), and the Adelphi Hotel, 
which was in that past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere 
in the world.[193] The English Heritage National Register of Historic Parks 
describes Merseyside's Victorian Parks as collectively the "most important 
in the country".[194] The city of Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, 
including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city 
apart from London.[195] Transport in Liverpool is primarily centred on 
the city's road and rail networks, both of which are extensive and provide 
links across the United Kingdom. Liverpool has an extensive local public 
transport network, which is managed by the Merseyside Passenger Transport 
Executive, and includes buses, trains and ferries. Additionally, the city 
also has an international airport and a major port, both of which provides 
links to locations outside the country. As a major city, Liverpool has 
direct road links with many other areas within England. To the east, the 
M62 motorway connects Liverpool with Hull and along the route provides 
links to several large cities, including Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. 
The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 motorway and M1 Motorway, 
providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham, Sheffield, 
Preston, London and Nottingham.[196] To the west of the city, the Kingsway 
and Queensway Tunnels connect Liverpool with the Wirral Peninsula, providing 
links to both Birkenhead, and Wallasey. The A41 road, which begins in Birkenhead, 
also provides links to Cheshire and Shropshire and via the A55 road, North 
Wales.[197] To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington 
via the A562 road and subsequently across the River Mersey to Runcorn, 
via the Silver Jubilee Bridge. Plans have been developed in recent years 
to construct a second bridge, known as the Mersey Gateway, across the river 
to alleviate congestion on the route today. Liverpool is served by two 
separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by Merseyrail 
and provides links throughout Merseyside and beyond (see Local Travel below), 
while the national network, which is managed by Network Rail, provides 
Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across the England. 
The city's primary mainline station is Lime Street station, which acts 
as a terminus for several lines into the city. Train services from Lime 
Street provide connections to numerous destinations, including London (in 
2 hours 8 minutes with Pendolino trains), Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne, 
Manchester, Preston, Leeds, Scarborough, Sheffield, Nottingham and Norwich. 
In the south of the city, Liverpool South Parkway provides a connection 
to the city's airport. The Port of Liverpool is one of Britain's largest 
ports, providing passenger ferry services across the Irish Sea to Belfast, 
Dublin and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, 
including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P&O Ferries and Stena Line. 
In 2007, a new cruise terminal was opened in Liverpool, located alongside 
the Pier Head in the city centre. November 2016 saw the official opening 
of Liverpool2, an extension to the port that allows post-Panamax vessels 
to dock in Liverpool.[198] Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is located 
in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections 
across the United Kingdom and Europe. In 2008, the airport handled over 
5.3 million passengers[199] and today offers services to 68 destinations,[200] 
including Berlin, Rome, Milan, Paris, Barcelona and Zürich. The airport 
is primarily served by low-cost airlines, notably Ryanair and Easyjet, 
although it does provide additional charter services in the summer. Liverpool's 
local rail network is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. 
The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line, which runs to Southport, 
Ormskirk, Kirkby and Hunts Cross; the Wirral Line, which runs through the 
Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester 
and Ellesmere Port; and the City Line, which begins at Lime Street, providing 
links to St Helens, Wigan, Preston, Warrington and Manchester. The network 
is predominantly electric. Electrification of the City Line was completed 
in 2015. The two lines operated by Merseyrail are the busiest British urban 
commuter networks outside London, covering 75 miles (121 km) of track, 
with an average of 100,000 passenger journeys per weekday.[201][202] Services 
are operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by the Merseyside 
Passenger Transport Executive. It should be noted that local services on 
the City Line are operated by Northern rather than Merseyrail, although 
the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within the city 
centre the majority of the network is underground, with four city centre 
stations and over 6.5 miles (10.5 km) of tunnels.[201] Local bus services 
within and around Liverpool are managed by the Merseyside Passenger Transport 
Executive (more commonly known as Merseytravel)[203] and are run by several 
different companies, including Arriva and Stagecoach. The two principal 
termini for local buses are Queen Square Bus Station (located near Lime 
Street railway station) for services north and east of the city, and Liverpool 
One Bus Station formerly known as Paradise Street Bus Interchange (located 
near the Albert Dock) for services to the south and east. Cross-river services 
to the Wirral use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas 
Street. A night bus service also operates on Saturdays providing services 
from the city centre across Liverpool and Merseyside.[204] The cross river 
ferry service in Liverpool, known as the Mersey Ferry, is managed and operated 
by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool 
and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate 
at intervals ranging from 20 minutes at peak times, to every hour during 
the middle of the day and during weekends.[205] Despite remaining an important 
transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry 
has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, 
with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical 
overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.[206] In May 2014, the 
CityBike hire scheme was launched in the city and was expanded in 2015. 
The cycle hire scheme has been successful and has been well received by 
the residents of Liverpool. As with other large cities, Liverpool is an 
important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, 
performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife amongst 
others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with 
the city holding the title of European Capital of Culture, during which 
time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including 
Go Superlambananas! and La Princesse. Liverpool is internationally known 
for music and is recognised by Guinness World Records as the World Capital 
City of Pop.[207] Musicians from the city have produced 56 number one singles, 
more than any other city in the world.[208][209] Both the most successful 
male band and girl group in global music history have contained Liverpudlian 
members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of The Beatles and 
during the 1960s was at the forefront of the Beat Music movement, which 
would eventually lead to the British Invasion. Many notable musicians of 
the time originated in the city including Billy J Kramer, Cilla Black, 
Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers. The influence of musicians 
from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such 
as the Liverpool poets, prompted American poet Allen Ginsberg to proclaim 
that the city was "the centre of consciousness of the human universe".[210] 
Other musicians from Liverpool include Billy Fury, A Flock of Seagulls, 
Echo and the Bunnymen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Frankie Vaughan and more 
recently Anathema, Ladytron, The Zutons, Atomic Kitten, Heidi Range and 
Rebecca Ferguson. The city is also home to the oldest surviving professional 
symphony orchestra in the UK, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, 
which is based in the Philharmonic Hall.[211] The chief conductor of the 
orchestra is Vasily Petrenko.[212] Sir Edward Elgar dedicated his famous 
Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, 
and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901.[213] Among 
Liverpool's curiosities, the Austrian émigré Fritz Spiegl is notable. He 
not only became a world expert on the etymology of Scouse, but composed 
the music to Z-cars and the Radio 4 UK Theme. The Mathew Street Festival 
is an annual street festival that is one of the most important musical 
events in Liverpool's calendar. It is Europe's largest free music event 
and takes place every August.[214] Other well established festivals in 
the city include Africa Oyé and Brazilica which are the UK's largest free 
African and Brazilian music festivals respectively.[215][216] The dance 
music festival Creamfields was established by the famous Liverpool-based 
Cream clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. 
There are numerous music venues located across the city, however the Echo 
Arena is by far the largest. Opened in 2008 the 11,000-seat arena hosted 
the MTV Europe Music Awards the same year and since then has held host 
to world-renowned acts such as Andrea Bocelli, Beyoncé, Elton John, Kanye 
West, Kasabian, The Killers, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Pink, Rihanna, UB40. Liverpool 
has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United 
Kingdom apart from London.[217] National Museums Liverpool is the only 
English national collection based wholly outside London.[218] The Tate 
Liverpool gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North 
of England and was, until the opening of Tate Modern, the largest exhibition 
space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The FACT centre hosts 
touring multimedia exhibitions, while the Walker Art Gallery houses one 
of the most impressive permanent collections of Pre-Raphaelite art in the 
world.[219] Sudley House contains another major collection of pre-20th-century 
art.[220] Liverpool University's Victoria Building was re-opened as a public 
art gallery and museum to display the University's artwork and historical 
collections which include the largest display of art by Audubon outside 
the US.[221] A number of artists have also come from the city, including 
painter George Stubbs who was born in Liverpool in 1724. The Liverpool 
Biennial festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and 
comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and 
New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide.[222] It 
was during the 2004 festival that Yoko Ono's work "My mother is beautiful" 
caused widespread public protest when photographs of a naked woman's pubic 
area were exhibited on the main shopping street. Felicia Hemans (née Browne) 
was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to 
Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of 
the Venetian consul in that city. Her father's business soon brought the 
family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They 
made their home near Abergele and St. Asaph (Flintshire), and it is clear 
that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to 
Wales as "Land of my childhood, my home and my dead". Her first poems, 
dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, 
when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of Percy Bysshe Shelley, 
who briefly corresponded with her. [223] A number of notable authors have 
visited Liverpool, including Daniel Defoe, Washington Irving, Thomas De 
Quincey, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charles Dickens, Gerard 
Manley Hopkins and Hugh Walpole. Daniel Defoe, after visiting the city, 
described it, as "one of the wonders of Britain in his "'Tour through England 
and Wales.[224] Herman Melville's novel Redburn deals with the first seagoing 
voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool 
in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are 
set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his 
reflections.[223] Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States 
consul between 1853 and 1856.[225] Charles Dickens visited the city on 
numerous occasions to give public readings.[226] Hopkins served as priest 
at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 
81.[227] Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, Jung 
famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his 
works.[228] Of all the poets who are connected with Liverpool, perhaps 
the greatest is Constantine P. Cavafy, a twentieth-century Greek cultural 
icon, although he was born in Alexandria. From a wealthy family, his father 
had business interests in Egypt, London and Liverpool. After his father's 
death, Cavafy's mother brought him in 1872 at the age of nine to Liverpool 
where he spent part of his childhood being educated. He lived first in 
Balmoral Road, then when the family firm crashed, he lived in poorer circumstances 
in Huskisson Street. After his father died in 1870, Cavafy and his family 
settled for a while in Liverpool. In 1876, his family faced financial problems 
due to the Long Depression of 1873, so, by 1877, they had to move back 
to Alexandria.[223] Her Benny, a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool 
street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher Silas K. Hocking, 
was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's 
lifetime.[229] The prolific writer of adventure novels, Harold Edward Bindloss 
(1866–1945), was born in Liverpool. The writer, docker and political activist 
George Garrett was born in Secombe, on the Wirral Peninsula in 1896 and 
was brought up in Liverpool's South end, around Park Road, the son of a 
fierce Liverpool–Irish Catholic mother and a staunch 'Orange' stevedore 
father. In the 1920s and 1930s his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance 
Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool 
became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings 
in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the Unity Theatre in the 1930s 
as part of the Popular Front against the rise of fascism, particularly 
its echoes in the Spanish Civil War. Garrett died in 1966.[230] The novelist 
and playwright James Hanley (1897–1985) was born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, 
in 1897 (not Dublin, nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class 
family.[231] Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing 
is about seamen. The Furys (1935) is first in a sequence of five loosely 
autobiographical novels about working-class life in Liverpool. James Hanley's 
brother, novelist Gerald Hanley (1916–92) was also born in Liverpool (not 
County Cork, Ireland, as he claimed).[232] While he published a number 
of novels he also wrote radio plays for the BBC as well as some film scripts, 
most notably The Blue Max (1966).[233] He was also one of several script 
writers for a life of Gandhi (1964).[234] Novelist Beryl Bainbridge (1932–2010) 
was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby Formby. She was primarily known 
for her works of psychological fiction, often set among the English working 
classes. Bainbridge won the Whitbread Awards prize for best novel in 1977 
and 1996 and was nominated five times for the Booker Prize. The Times newspaper 
named Bainbridge among their list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 
1945".[235] J. G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 but left at the 
outbreak of war in 1939.[236] A novelist of Irish descent, Farrell gained 
prominence for his historical fiction, most notably his Empire Trilogy 
(Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), dealing with 
the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. However, 
his career ended when he drowned in Ireland in 1979 at the age of 44. Helen 
Forrester was the pen name of June Bhatia (née Huband) (1919–2011),[237][238] 
who was known for her books about her early childhood in Liverpool during 
the Great Depression, including Twopence to Cross the Mersey (1974), as 
well as several works of fiction. During the late 1960s the city became 
well known for the Liverpool poets, who include Roger McGough and the late 
Adrian Henri. An anthology of poems, The Mersey Sound, written by Henri, 
McGough and Brian Patten, has sold well since it was first being published 
in 1967. Liverpool has produced several noted writers of horror fiction, 
often set on Merseyside – Ramsey Campbell, Clive Barker and Peter Atkins 
among them. A collection of Liverpudlian horror fiction, Spook City was 
edited by a Liverpool expatriate, Angus Mackenzie, and introduced by Doug 
Bradley, also from Liverpool.[239] Bradley is famed for portraying Barker's 
creation Pinhead in the Hellraiser series of films. Liverpool also has 
a history of performing arts, reflected in several annual theatre festivals 
such as the Liverpool Shakespeare Festival which takes place inside Liverpool 
Cathedral and in the adjacent historic St James' Gardens every summer, 
The Everyword Festival of new theatre writing, the only one of its kind 
in the country,[240] Physical Fest, an international festival of physical 
theatre, organised by Tmesis,[241] the annual festivals run by John Moores 
University Drama department and LIPA, and by the number of theatres in 
the city. These include the Empire, Everyman, Liverpool Playhouse, Neptune, 
Royal Court and Unity theatres. The Everyman and Playhouse are now both 
part of one company, and both houses produce their own work as well as 
receiving touring productions.[242][243] The Everyman was rebuilt between 
2011 and 2014, with the previous building being demolished and a new venue 
constructed on the same site.[244][245] Some notable actors from Liverpool 
include; Rex Harrison (Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady), Malcolm McDowell 
(Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange), Tom Baker (fourth incarnation of 
the Doctor in Doctor Who) and Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy in the Harry 
Potter films). Liverpool has a thriving and varied nightlife, with the 
majority of the city's late night bars, pubs, nightclubs, live music venues 
and comedy clubs being located in a number of distinct districts. A 2011 
TripAdvisor poll voted Liverpool as having the best nightlife of any UK 
city, ahead of Manchester, Leeds and even London.[246] Concert Square, 
St. Peter's Square and the adjoining Seel, Duke and Hardman Streets are 
home to some of Liverpool's largest and most famed nightclubs including 
Alma de Cuba, Blue Angel, Bumper, Chibuku, Heebie Jeebies, Korova, The 
Krazyhouse, The Magnet, Nation (home of the Cream brand, and Medication, 
the UK's largest and longest running weekly student event), Popworld as 
well as countless other smaller establishments and chain bars. Another 
popular nightlife destination in the city centre is Mathew Street and the 
Gay Quarter, located close to the city's commercial district, this area 
is famed for The Cavern Club alongside numerous gay bars including Garlands 
and G-Bar. The Albert Dock and Lark Lane in Aigburth also contain an abundance 
of bars and late night venues. In Liverpool primary and secondary education 
is available in various forms supported by the state including secular, 
Church of England, Jewish, and Roman Catholic. Islamic education is available 
at primary level, but there is no secondary provision. One of Liverpool's 
important early schools was The Liverpool Blue Coat School; founded in 
1708 as a charitable school. The Liverpool Blue Coat School is the top-performing 
school in the city with 100% 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE resulting in 
the 30th best GCSE results in the country and an average point score per 
student of 1087.4 in A/AS levels.[247] Other notable schools include Liverpool 
College founded in 1840 Merchant Taylors' School founded in 1620.[248] 
Another of Liverpool's notable senior schools is St. Edward's College situated 
in the West Derby area of the city. Historic grammar schools, such as the 
Liverpool Institute High School and Liverpool Collegiate School, closed 
in the 1980s are still remembered as centres of academic excellence. Bellerive 
Catholic College is the city's top performing non-selective school, based 
upon GCSE results in 2007. Liverpool has three universities: the University 
of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University. 
Edge Hill University, originally founded as a teacher-training college 
in the Edge Hill district of Liverpool, is now located in Ormskirk in South-West 
Lancashire. Liverpool is also home to the Liverpool Institute for Performing 
Arts (LIPA). The University of Liverpool, was established in 1881 as University 
College Liverpool. In 1884, became part of the federal Victoria University. 
Following a Royal Charter and Act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent 
university, the University of Liverpool, with the right to confer its own 
degrees. It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, 
architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social 
science. Liverpool Hope University, which was formed through the merger 
of three colleges, the earliest of which was founded in 1844, gained university 
status in 2005. It is the only ecumenical university in Europe.[249] It 
is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and has a second 
campus in the city centre (the Cornerstone). The Liverpool School of Tropical 
Medicine, founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues 
today as a post-graduate school affiliated with the University of Liverpool 
and hothaw an anti-venom repository. Liverpool John Moores University was 
previously a polytechnic, and gained status in 1992. It is named in honour 
of Sir John Moores, one of the founders of the Littlewoods football pools 
and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously 
owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool 
Mechanics Institute, opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's 
third-oldest university. The city has one further education colleges, Liverpool 
Community College in the city centre. Liverpool City Council operates Burton 
Manor, a residential adult education college in nearby Burton, on the Wirral 
Peninsula. There are two Jewish schools in Liverpool, both belonging to 
the King David Foundation. King David School, Liverpool is the High School

them, the clubs have won 27 English First Division titles, 12 FA Cup titles, 
10 League Cup titles, 5 European Cup titles, 1 European Cup Winners' Cup 
title, 3 UEFA Cup titles, and 24 FA Charity Shields. The clubs both compete 
in the Premier League, of which they are founding members, and contest 
the Merseyside Derby, dubbed the 'friendly derby' despite there having 
been more sending-offs in this fixture than any other.[250] However, unlike 
many other derbies, it is not rare for families in the city to contain 
supporters of both clubs.[251] Everton F.C. were founded in 1878 and play 
at Goodison Park and Liverpool F.C. were founded in 1892 and play at Anfield. 
Many high-profile players have played for the clubs, including Dixie Dean,

Hibbert. The City of Liverpool is the only one in England to have staged 
top division football every single season since the formation of the Football 
League in 1888, and both of the city's clubs play in high-capacity stadiums. 
Boxing is massively popular in Liverpool. The city has a proud heritage 
and history in the sport and is home to around 22 amateur boxing clubs, 
which are responsible for producing many successful boxers, such as Ike 
Bradley, Alan Rudkin, John Conteh, Andy Holligan, Paul Smith, Shea Neary,

city on the GB Boxing team, as well as at the 2012 London Olympics, the 
most notable Liverpool amateur fighters include; George Turpin, Tony Willis, 
Robin Reid and David Price who have all medalled at the Olympic Games.

within the city, although the former home of Liverpool boxing was the renowned 
Liverpool Stadium. Aintree is home to the world's most famous steeple-chase, 
the John Smith's Grand National which takes place annually in early April. 
The race meeting attracts horse owners/ jockeys from around the world to 
compete in the demanding 4 miles (6.4 km) and 30 fence course. There have 
been many memorable moments of the Grand National, for instance the 100/1 
outsider Foinavon in 1967, the dominant Red Rum and Ginger McCain of the 
1970s and Mon Mome (100/1) who won the 2009 meeting. In 2010, the National 
became the first horse race to be televised in high-definition in the UK.

in Allerton in the south of the city. Liverpool Tennis Development Programme 
at Wavertree Tennis Centre is one of the largest in the UK. Professional 
basketball came to the city in 2007 with the entry of Everton Tigers, now 
known as Mersey Tigers, into the elite British Basketball League. The club 
was originally associated with Everton F.C., and was part of the Toxteth 
Tigers youth development programme, which reached over 1,500 young people 
every year.[259] The Tigers began play in Britain's top league for the 
2007–08 season, playing at the Greenbank Sports Academy before moving into 
the newly completed Echo Arena during that season. After the 2009–10 season, 
Everton F.C. withdrew funding from the Tigers, who then changed their name 
to Mersey Tigers. Their closest professional rivals are the Cheshire Jets, 
based 18 miles (29 km) away in Chester. Liverpool is one of three cities 
which still host the traditional sport of British baseball and it hosts 
the annual England-Wales international match every two years, alternating

of racing.[260] The Tour of Britain took nine stages and finished in London 
on 14 September. A 2016 study of UK fitness centres found that, of the 
top 20 UK urban areas, Liverpool had the highest number of leisure and 
sports centres per capita, with 4.3 centres per 100,000 of the city population.[261] 
Liverpool is home to the Premier League football clubs Everton and Liverpool 
F.C. Liverpool have played at Anfield since 1892, when the club was formed 
to occupy the stadium following Everton's departure due to a dispute with 
their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 116 years later, although 
the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s and only the Main 
Stand survives from before 1992. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater 
stand in 1994–95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult 
status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans 
who packed onto its terraces. Anfield is classified as a 4 Star UEFA Elite 
Stadium with capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort, and is a distinctive 
landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool 
club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy. 
After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite 
side of Stanley Park. Goodison Park was the first major football stadium 
built in England. Molineux (Wolves' ground) had been opened three years 
earlier but was still relatively undeveloped. St. James's Park, Newcastle, 
opened in 1892, was little more than a field. Only Scotland had more advanced 
grounds. Rangers opened Ibrox in 1887, while Celtic Park was officially 
inaugurated at the same time as Goodison Park. Everton performed a miraculous 
transformation at Mere Green, spending up to £3000 on laying out the ground 
and erecting stands on three sides. For £552 Mr. Barton prepared the land 
at 4½d a square yard. Kelly Brothers of Walton built two uncovered stands 
each for 4,000 people, and a covered stand seating 3,000, at a total cost 
of £1,460. Outside, hoardings cost a further £150, gates and sheds cost 
£132 10s and 12 turnstiles added another £7 15s to the bill. The ground 
was immediately renamed Goodison Park and proudly opened on 24 August 1892, 
by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA. But instead of a match the 
12,000 crowd saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music 
and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 
1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It now has the capacity for more than 40,000 
spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a 
new goal-end stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Main Stand 
dates back to the 1970s, while the other two stands are refurbished pre-Second 
World War structures. Everton have been considering relocation since 1996, 
and in 2003 were forced to scrap plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's 
Dock due to financial reasons. The latest plan has been to move beyond 
Liverpool's council boundary to Kirkby, but this has proved controversial 
with some fans, as well as members of the local community. At one point 
there was much talk for Everton to ground-share with Liverpool, at the 
proposed new Stanley Park Stadium, but this was not progressed by either 
club. The ITV region which covers Liverpool is ITV Granada. In 2006, the 
Television company opened a new newsroom in the Royal Liver Building. Granada's 
regional news broadcasts were produced at the Albert Dock News Centre during 
the 1980s and 1990s.[262] The BBC also opened a new newsroom on Hanover 
Street in 2006. ITV's daily magazine programme This Morning was famously 
broadcast from studios at Albert Dock until 1996, when production was moved 
to London. Granada's short-lived shopping channel "Shop!" was also produced 
in Liverpool until it was axed in 2002. Liverpool is the home of the TV 
production company Lime Pictures, formerly Mersey Television, which produced 
the now-defunct soap operas Brookside and Grange Hill. It also produces 
the soap opera Hollyoaks, which was formerly filmed in Chester and began 
on Channel 4 in 1995. All three series were/are largely filmed in the Childwall 
area of Liverpool. The city has one daily newspaper: the Echo, published 
by the Trinity Mirror group. The Liverpool Daily Post was also published 
until 2013. The UK's first online only weekly newspaper called Southport 
Reporter (Southport and Mersey Reporter), is also one of the many other 
news outlets that covers the city. Radio stations include BBC Radio Merseyside, 
Capital Liverpool, Radio City, Radio City 2 and Radio City Talk. The last 
three are located in Radio City Tower which, along with the two cathedrals, 
dominates the city's skyline. The independent media organisation Indymedia 
also covers Liverpool, while 'Nerve' magazine publishes articles and reviews 
of cultural events. Liverpool has also featured in films;[263] see List 
of films set in Liverpool for some of them. In films the city has "doubled" 
for London, Paris, New York, Chicago,[264] Moscow, Dublin, Venice and Berlin.[19][265] 
Liverpool is twinned[268] with: Liverpool has friendship links (without 
formal constitution)[269] with the following cities: The first overseas 
consulate of the United States was opened in Liverpool in 1790, and it 
remained operational for almost two centuries.[citation needed] Today, 
a large number of consulates are located in the city serving Chile, Denmark, 
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, 
Norway, Romania, Sweden and Thailand. Tunisian & Ivory Coast Consulates 
are located in the neighbouring Metropolitan Borough of Sefton Coordinates:
