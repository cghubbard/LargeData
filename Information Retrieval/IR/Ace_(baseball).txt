In baseball, an ace is the best starting pitcher on a team and nearly always 
the first pitcher in the team's starting rotation. Barring injury or exceptional 
circumstances, an ace typically starts on Opening Day. In addition, aces 
are usually preferred to start crucial playoff games, sometimes on three 
days rest.[citation needed] The term may be a derivation of the nickname 
of Asa Brainard, (real first name: "Asahel"), a 19th-century star pitcher, 
who was sometimes referred to as "Ace".[1][2] In the early days of baseball, 
the term "ace" was used to refer to a run.[3] A lot of modern baseball 
analysts and fans have started using the term "ace" to refer to the elite 
pitchers in the game, not necessarily to the best starting pitcher on each 
team.[4] For example, the April 27, 1981 Sports Illustrated cover was captioned 
"The Amazing A's and Their Five Aces" to describe the starting rotation
