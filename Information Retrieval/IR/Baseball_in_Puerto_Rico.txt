Baseball is the most popular sport in Puerto Rico. In terms of spectators 
and active participants, it is the premier sport on the island. It is also 
the only sport with its own professional league: the Puerto Rico Baseball 
League. The game was introduced to the island in the late 19th century 
and the first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897, before the American 
invasion of 1898 known as the Spanish–American War. The sport was initially 
ridiculed as an effete, unmanly exhibition. However, when local Puerto 
Rican teams regularly defeated and embarrassed the more "experienced" American 
teams, the sport began to catch on. As of 2016, over 100 Major League Baseball 
players were active in the Puerto Rico Baseball League, in addition to 
the many hundreds who participated in the past. Some of the most famous 
baseball players from Puerto Rico include Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente, 
Orlando Cepeda and Roberto Alomar; as well as Jose "Cheo" Cruz; Iván Rodríguez; 
Edgar Martínez; Juan González; Victor Pellot; Yadier Molina; and Bernie 
Williams. The game of baseball was introduced to the island in the late 
19th century, by Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the 
United States. At first the sport was poorly received by the hard-working 
farmers, tobacco workers and sugarcane cutters of the island, who considered 
it an effete, unmanly game. The first two baseball clubs were founded in 
1897: the Almendares Baseball Club owned by Francisco Alamo Armas, and 
the Borinquen Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.[1] According to El 
País newspaper, the first organized baseball game was played on January 
11, 1898 at the old velodrome in Santurce, San Juan. The Borinquen beat 
the Almendares by a score of 3 to 0. The first game to go a complete nine 
innings was played on January 30, 1898, when the Borinquen beat the Almendares 
again, by a score of 9 to 3.[1] Later that same year, Puerto Rico became 
an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American 
War. By way of recreation, the American soldiers stationed in Puerto Rico 
were permitted to organize a baseball club to play against the local Puerto 
Rican clubs. On November 4, 1900 the Almendares Baseball Club trounced 
the American Baseball Club of the Second Regiment of Infantry, by a score 
of 32 to 18.[1] In the early 1920s teams from Puerto Rico, such as the 
San Juan Baseball Club and the Porto Rican Stars, would travel to New York 
City to play against some of the professional American teams. Puerto Rico 
has a winter baseball league named the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto 
Clemente, formerly known as Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico 
(LBPPR) and Puerto Rico Baseball League, that has operated since the early 
20th century. The champion of the Puerto Rico league represents Puerto 
Rico in the annual Caribbean World Series. The LBPRC currently has six 
teams: In 2007, the LBPPR recessed for the first time since its creation. 
In 2008, the organization resumed operations, but with several structural 
changes. These included reducing the league to only four teams, renaming 
the league as the "Puerto Rico Baseball League", and establishing a website.[3] 
Currently, the league's champion also participates in the Caribbean Series. 
In 2008, the LBPPR participated in the first inter-league series with the 
LBPDR, otherwise known as the Liga de Beisbol Profesional de la Republica 
Dominicana (Professional Baseball League of the Dominican Republic). Enrique 
Huyke, a professor from Mayagüez, originally suggested the establishment 
of an organized baseball league in Puerto Rico. The idea was adopted by 
Teofilo Maldonado, president of the Commission on Recreation and Sports. 
Gabriel Castro helped Huyke with the scouting of organizations, which had 
to pay $1,000 prior to being admitted. The Guayama Rotary Club collaborated 
in raising funds for the teams.[4] The Liga de Béisbol Semiprofesional 
de Puerto Rico (LBSPR) was founded in 1938, as a semi-professional league.[5] 
The new league consisted of six teams: the Senadores de San Juan (San Juan 
Senators), Leones de Ponce (Ponce Lions), Indios de Mayagüez (Mayagüez 
Indians), Criollos de Caguas (Caguas Creoles), Brujos de Guayama (Guayama 
Witch Doctors), and Grises Orientales de Humacao (Humacao Oriental Grays).[6] 
Maldonado was named the league's commissioner. The league set deadlines 
for changes in the rosters, which were allowed only during the first half 
of the season, and the number of games played has historically varied from 
40 to 80 games per season.[7] The All-Star game was scheduled to coincide 
with the traditional Three Kings Day, January 6, an idea suggested by Angel 
Colón so that the proceeds could be used to buy toys. This date was used 
for decades, until the emergence of television forced the league to comply 
with dates requested by the networks.[7][8] .The first Puerto Rican players 
to play in U.S. Major League Baseball, Hiram Bithorn and Luis Olmo, were 
active in the rosters of San Juan and Caguas. Bithorn became the youngest 
manager in the league's history, named to the position in 1938 at the age 
of 22.[9] Enrique Huyke served as manager for Mayagüez for less than a 
month, because the team‘s owner threatened to remove its entry if he did 
not take the office.[4] One of the main figures of the league in its early 
stage was Negro leagues’ veteran, Emilio Navarro.[10] In the 1939-40 season, 
the Cangrejeros de Santurce (Santurce Crabbers) and Tiburones de Aguadilla 
(Aguadilla Sharks) joined the original teams.[6] On January 8, 1939, Humacao 
and San Juan played an 18-inning game that lasted four hours, establishing 
a record.[11] Between 1938 and 1941, the LBSPR was part of the National 
Semi-Professional Baseball Congress, with titleholder Guayama facing the 
champions of the Congress’ United States branch in best-of-seven series 
in 1939, where they defeated the Duncan Cementers, and again in 1940.[4] 
In 1939-40, Perucho Cepeda won the league's batting championship over Josh 
Gibson, who managed to win it the following season.[12] The Criollos de 
Caguas won their first championship in 1940/41, defeating the Cangrejeros 
in the final series. Santurce's Luis Cabrera was the last player to win 
the LBSPR’ Most Valuable Player award.[13] In October, 1940, Hall of Fame 
pitcher Satchel Paige arrived in Puerto Rico, four weeks after the start 
of the 1939/40 winter season. He joined the Brujos de Guayama (Guayama 
Witch Doctors), who also featured shortstop Perucho Cepeda and outfielder 
Tetelo Vargas. On November 5, Paige pitched a shut out against rival Santurce, 
which featured player-manager Josh Gibson, by a lopsided score of 23 to 
0.[14] In a December game against Mayagüez, Paige set a league record by 
striking out 17 batters. He ended the season with a 19–3 record, a 1.93 
ERA, and 208 strikeouts in 205 innings. The 19 wins and 208 strikeouts 
set single-season league records, that have never been broken. Paige helped 
his team win the league championship playoff series, winning two games 
against the San Juan Senadores.[15][16] Paige went on to win the league‘s 
Most Valuable Player award in 1940.[4] The town of Guayama is widely known 
for its Santería, Palo (religion), and other spiritualist religious practices. 
In a legendary game in Guayama, Paige walked off the mound, because he 
saw a ghost standing next to him. On September 14, 1941, Rafael Delgado 
Márquez proposed that the league recognize a move from semi-professional 
to professional status by renaming itself to Liga de Béisbol Profesional 
de Puerto Rico (LBPPR).[4] The league used a format of vueltas (halves), 
where the winners of each half facing each other for the championship. 
However, Ponce managed to win four consecutive championships (1941–45), 
and in three of those seasons (1941/42, 1943/44, 1944/45) they won both 
halves and were declared champions without participating in a final.[4] 
Consequently, once the other teams were eliminated from winning the second-half 
title, their fans tended to lose interest. Some players also dropped out 
after their teams were eliminated. To deal with this issue, in 1948/49 
the league established a new playoff format that included the top four 
teams.[4] Drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 1941, Hiram Bithorn was the first 
Puerto Rican to ever play major league baseball. The world took notice 
in 1943, when Bithorn went 18–12 with an earned run average of 2.60, and 
completed 19 of his 30 starts. He also led the league in shutouts (seven), 
setting a record for Puerto Rican pitchers that stands to this day.[17] 
Francisco Coímbre was a key member of Ponce's success, winning two batting 
championships and a Most Valuable Player award. He went three consecutive 
seasons (1939–42) without striking out.[10] Other players that participated 
for Ponce included Juan Guilbe and Griffin Tirado.[18] In 1943/44 and 1944/45, 
Ponce pitcher Tomás "Planchardón" Quiñones won back-to-back Most Valuable 
Player awards.[19] World War II affected the league directly, reducing 
the 1942/43 season's length to 36 games and the number of active teams 
to four.The league continued with four teams through 1945/46, but they 
played 48 games from 1943–46. From 1942 to 1944, teams were not allowed 
to bring in imported players.[4] In the 1944/45 season, Luis "Canena" Márquez 
debuted in the league and hit .361, setting the record for highest batting 
average by a rookie.[20] The Senadores de San Juan won their first championship 
in 1945/46, defeating the Indios in the finals.[21] During this season, 
Joe Buzas became the first foreign MLB player to manage in the LBPPR.[22] 
Victor Pellot, also known as Vic Power, made his debut for the Criollos 
on the 1947-48 season, when the team won the league title. The team roster 
included Rafaelito Ortiz, the only pitcher to win ten or more games for 
three different LBPPR teams.[23] In 1947, the New York Yankees participated 
in a five-game series against teams from the Caribbean leagues. In Puerto 
Rico, Ponce and an All-Star LBPPR team defeated the Yankees on consecutive 
nights.[24][25] José "Pantalones" Santiago debuted in this season, earning 
the Rookie of the Year recognition while Canena Marquez broke Josh Gibson's 
home run record of 13.[19] In 1948-49, the LBPPR joined the Caribbean Series, 
beginning a rivalry with Cuba that lasted throughout the next decade, until 
Cuba ceased to participate in the event.[26] Leon Day, a member of the 
U.S. Negro Leagues, also played for Los Triburones de Aguadilla (the Aguadilla 
Sharks) in Puerto Rico. When Day was inducted into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame, he became the only Hall of Famer to be enshrined with a cap of a 
team outside the mainland U.S. – his plaque depicts him as a Tiburon de 
Aguadilla. A decade after its foundation the league was employing an 80-game 
schedule, with an average season attendance of 750,000. Estadio Sixto Escobar 
was the oldest stadium, built in San Juan in 1935. It was also the largest, 
with 13,135 seats and a maximum capacity of over 15,000.[27] By the 1949-50 
season, several new ballparks were built, each containing 6,000 or more 
seats. The largest new stadium was Ponce's Estadio Francisco Montaner with 
9,718 seats. Montaner has the distinction of being the first stadium in 
Puerto Rico that installed an artificial surface field.[28] The installation 
of lights, which allowed for night games, further boosted stadium attendances.[7] 
The Stadium was named to honor Francisco "Paquito" Montaner, one of the 
greatest Puerto Rican pitchers of all times.[29] Perucho Cepeda was one 
of the league's dominant figures during the 1940s, winning two batting 
championships. Natalio Irizarry won the league's Rookie of the Year recognition 
in 1949-50.[30] From 1949–1955, the league featured the participation of 
new MLB players, including Johnny Logan, Harvey Haddix and Hank Aaron among 
several others.[31] The MLB players kept returning, and encouraged more 
MLB to join them, began of the calibre of league play and because of the 
warm climate during winter months. Players from the Negro leagues preferred 
it due to a lack of racism towards the players, as opposed to the United 
States.[32] In 1952, Roberto Clemente made his debut with the Cangrejeros 
hitting .234. He was signed by Pedrin Zorilla, debuting in the league as 
a teenager.[33] The team won that year's title and Cot Deal was named MVP.[34] 
Clemente improved this average to .288 the following season, but Santurce 
finished last in the league.[35] The league's champions were the Criollos, 
who also won the Caribbean Series.[36] With a roster that also included 
Luis Olmo, Willie Mays and Rubén Gómez, the Cangrejeros won the 1954-55 
championship defeating Caguas in the finals, 4-1.[36] During this season, 
Clemente became the first Puerto Rican player to hit two home runs in the 
league's All-Star game.[36] The team also went on to win the Caribbean 
Series, which were held in Venezuela.[37] Jim Rivera hand an average of 
.450 and was named MVP.[38] Puerto Rican fans received the team with a 
parade upon landing and Luis Muñoz Marín welcomed them in La Fortaleza.[37] 
In 1955-56, the Criollos won the league's championship, in a season that 
marked Orlando Cepeda's debut in the league.[36] Clemente won the season's 
batting championship with an average of .396.[33] In 1956-57, the league's 
championship was won by the Indios. During this season, Clemente went on 
to break the league's record for most games with hits, previously established 
by Francisco Coimbre in 1943-44.[39] The following season, the Criollos 
defeated the Cangrejeros to win the championship. Clemente who now played 
for Caguas, hit .529 during the final series.[40] Juan "Terin" Pizarro 
won the Most Valuable Player Award, leading the league in wins, ERA, best 
win-to-loss margin and pitched the LBPPR's seventh no-hitter.[41] In the 
Caribbean Series, he defeated Carta Vieja of Panama (8:0), recording 17 
strikeouts.[41] Both teams traded the final two championships of the decade. 
In 1958-59, Orlando Cepeda, coming from his first season in the Majors 
where he was selected Rookie of the Year in the National League, kept things 
on fire with Santurce winning the batting title and MVP award, helping 
the Crabbers win their fourth championship. The 1959-60 season marked the 
first instance that LBPPR games were transmitted in two languages through 
radio.[42] The Criollos won the championship, while Mayagüez's Ramón Luis 
Conde won the Most Valuable Player Award.[43] In 1961-62, coming from his 
best season in the big leagues, Cepeda was also LBPPR leader in home runs 
and RBIs, and won his second MVP Award guiding Santurce to its fifth championship.[44] 
During the 1950s, Puerto Rico's economy grew significantly, and this encouraged 
baseball-related gambling.[45] This tendency experienced a notable increase 
in the early 1960s. Other changes arried in the game's style, with the 
introduction of more player-managers such as Luis Olmo, who became the 
first to consistently employ pitching coaches and closers in the league.[46] 
After the Cuban Revolution, hotels and casinos in San Juan benefited from 
Havana’ economic decay.[47] During this timeframe, Puerto Rico expanded 
its presence in the Caribbean, and a native team frequently played again 
a representation of St. Thomas and Saint Croix in February.[48] Julio Navarro 
was drafted from one of these exhibitions, eventually becoming one of the 
league's dominant pitchers.[48] In 1961-62, due to political tension between 
the U.S. and Cuba, the Caribbean Series planned for in Havana's Estadio 
Latinoamericano (Latin American Stadium) was cancelled. The event was replaced 
by the Interamerican Series, which San Juan attended with a roster that 
included pitcher Florentino Rivera.[44] During the 1960s the Dominican 
Winter League was still not a member of the Caribbean Confederation, which 
allowed uncommon interleague trades between it and the LBPPR, which would 
have more trouble negotiating such deals with member leagues.[49] During 
this decade, some of the league's teams would provide import players with 
houses and taxis for transportation. The Senadores de San Juan, led by 
Clemente, who had just won the MLB World Series with Pittsburgh, won the 
league's 1960–61 season, as well as José Santiago, who posted a record 
of 10-2 with an ERA of 2.44 for the team.[44] Luis Arroyo won the season's 
Most Valuable Player award, registering a record of 10-2 with an ERA of 
1.64.[50] The Interamerican Series were held three more times, with each 
team winning on their home field. Mayagüez did so in 1963, in a series 
where Terin Pizarro recorded the only no-hitter in the history of the event, 
in a win over Valencia at the opening night.[51] In 1961-62, the Lobos 
de Arecibo joined the league as an expansion team.[52] On January 14, 1962, 
Julio Navarro pitched the first regular season no-hitter.[11] For the 1962-63 
season, Estadio Sixto Escobar was replaced by the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, 
with a larger capacity of 20,000 seats. The field dimensions were set to 
match the Olympic Stadium of the Montreal Expos: 325 feet (99 m) down the 
left field line, 325 feet (99 m) down the right field line and 404 feet 
(123 m) to center field. The outfield fences were set 8 feet (2.5 m) high.[27] 
In 1963-64, Clemente finished second with a batting average of .345, leading 
the Senadores to the title.[53] San Juan once again played in the Interamerican 
Series, held in Nicaragua.[53] In 1964-65, Orlando Cepeda joined the Cangrejeros, 
replacing Jim Beauchamp and helping the team win the league championship. 
During this season, Clemente was named San Juan's player-manager, leading 
them to the playoffs.[54] The following season featured the debut of Jerry 
Morales, who won the league's Rookie of the Year award.[55] Carlos Bernier 
retired in 1966, having won five stolen base titles for a total of 285 
stolen bases.[30] On November 20, 1966, San Juan's Luis de Leon pitched 
the first perfect game in the league's history.[56] Caguas won the league 
championship in 1967-68.[47] Nino Escalera, who finished his career third 
on the league's hit list, replaced Vic Power as the team's manager during 
this season.[57] On December 20, 1969, Santurce and Arecibo participated 
in the only LBPPR game played outside of Puerto Rico, held in the United 
States Virgin Islands to honor Elrod Hendricks.[58] Ponce won the second 
of back-to-back championships in 1969-70 as well as the Caribbean Series’ 
title being led in both by Conde's offensive.[59] The Cangrejeros won the 
1970-71 championship, defeating the Criollos in the finals.[60] The 1972 
All-Star game was dedicated in honor of Roberto Clemente, who had died 
a week before, while transporting supplies to victims of the 1972 Nicaragua 
earthquake.[61] Both native and foreign-born players wore a black band 
on their arms, as a symbol of mourning. The Criollos won the 1973-74 championship, 
possessing the league's strongest native lineup.[62] The Indios won the 
1973–74 title and the Caribbean Series held in Mexico that year.[63] Caguas 
won its ninth championship in the 1978-79 season and Bayamón won the last 
championship of the decade, with a roster that included batting champion 
Dave Bergman.[64] Coming back from a fourth-place regular season finish, 
the Criollos won their tenth championship in the 1980–81 season, but the 
Caribbean Series were not held that year.[65] On January 2, 1981, Rickey 
Henderson established a new stolen bases record with 42. Orlando Gómez 
made his debut as a manager for Mayagüez and won the Manager of the Year 
award.[66] Dickie Thon won the first of two back-to-back batting titles 
this season.[67] This also marked Alomar, Sr.'s last active season, retiring 
forth on the fourth place of league's all-time hit leaders.[68] In 1981-82, 
the Lobos de Arecibo recessed and their native star players, Edwin Núñez, 
Candy Maldonado and Ramón Avilés were drafted by the remaining teams.[52] 
The team returned the following season, winning the franchise's first championship.[52] 
The team won the 1983 Caribbean Series, receiving a large welcoming ceremony 
at Luis Muñoz Marín Airport that included a parade from San Juan to Arecibo. 
From 1974 to 1983, the team hosted their games in Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel, 
which has 12,500 seats. Located at Route 2 and Route 5, in Bayamón, Puerto 
Rico, the stadium has easy access with a metro station (known as Deportivo 
Station) on the stadium premises. In 1982-83, Bayamón's Carmelo Martínez 
was selected MVP.[69] Mayagüez won the 1983-84 season, with Santurce's 
Jerry Willard being selected MVP.[70] Besides this, the players were rewarded 
with a cruise trip and met the Governor of Puerto Rico.[37] Eduardo Figueroa 
led the league in ERA, winning the recognition of Comeback Player of the 
Year.[67] For the 1984–85 season, the Vaqueros were moved back to San Juan 
and re-adopted their original name, the Senadores de San Juan.[71] However, 
one year later they were rechristened as the Metros de San Juan, a name 
that they conserved until 1994.[71] The team won the LBPPR title that season. 
The Metros de San Juan also won the Caribbean Series being led by Francisco 
Javier Oliveras, who won a game in the series and had previously recorded 
eight regular season wins and one in the semifinals.[72] Henry Cotto of 
Caguas was selected the league's MVP. Rubén Sierra debuted for Santurce 
and won the league's Rookie of the Year award.[72] One of Puerto Rico's 
most successful managers, Mako Oliveras, made his managing debut in December 
1984, subsequently becoming responsible for giving playing time to unknown 
prospects such as Benito Santiago, Edgar Martínez and Carlos Baerga, all 
of which would go on to become stars.[66] Mayagüez won the 1985-86 championship. 
This marked Roberto Alomar's debut in the LBPPR, debuting for the Criollos 
after being drafted by Arecibo while in high school. Caguas won the 1986-87 
championship, the team went on to win the Caribbean Series, featuring a 
native lineup that included Alomar, Carmelo Martínez, Edgar Díaz, Germán 
Rivera, Henry Cotto, Orlando Mercado and Heidi Vargas.[73] This was José 
Cruz's final year in the league, having amassed 119 home runs, 40 for the 
Leones and 70 with Caguas, finishing second in the all-time list.[74] The 
Indios de Mayagüez won the 1985-86 season, led by Luis Quiñones’ three 
home runs in the finals over San Juan.[69] Caguas won the 1986-87 championship 
and their third Caribbean Series‘ title, being led by a lineup that included 
Cotto and Oliveras.[72] Mayagüez won the first of back to back titles in 
1987-88. The 1988 All-Star Game commemorated the league's 50th anniversary, 
and the game was dedicated to Angel Colon.[75] That year, the Metro region 
defeated the Island region, 1-0. Mayagüez went on to win the 1988-89 title, 
once again led by Quiñones' clutch hitting.[69] Javier López debuted in 
1988, winning the league's Rookie of the Year recognition.[76] San Juan 
won the championship in the 1989–90 season.[73] The season featured the 
debut of Juan González, who under the initiative of that season's Manager 
of the Year, Ramón Avilés, played every game with Caguas, finishing second 
in home runs with 9 and RBIs with 34.[77] He was traded for Roberto Alomar 
during the off-season.[78] González also reinforced San Juan, recording 
two home runs in the Caribbean Series.[78] Carlos Baerga and Edgar Martínez 
were the co-MVP players of the 1989-90 season. Martínez became the first 
player in 41 seasons to win the batting crown with an average above.400, 
registering .424.[79] Santurce won the title the following year, which 
featured the debut of Wil Cordero, who was named Rookie of the Year.[79] 
In the 1991–1992 season, the Criollos de Caguas franchise was moved to 
Bayamón, but experienced low attendance in that municipality.[80] Due to 
this their star players, Juan González and Iván Rodríguez, were drafted 
by Santurce and Mayagüez respectively. The Indios won that season's championship 
and the Caribbean Series held in Mexico, with Chad Kreuter winning the 
series’ MVP award.[81] Roberto Hernandez won a tie-breaker with Venezuela 
to secure the series, and Cordero was recognized as the league MVP.[82] 
The 1992-93 season featured the return of Dickie Thon to the league, who 
led Santurce to a championship over San Juan in the finals as well as the 
debut of José "Cheo" Cruz as a manager.[67] The finals series featured 
both Thon and Juan González, which attracted 90,369 fans throughout six 
games, including a record of 23,701 in the last game.[67] González had 
won consecutive batting titles in Major League Baseball and was selected 
the MVP after recording an average of .333 with seven home runs and 14 
RBIs.[78] Other MLB players, including Iván Rodríguez, Sandy Alomar, Jr. 
and Omar Olivares returned to the league during that season.[67] The Cangrejeros 
went on to win their fourth Caribbean Series’ title. Cordero won the league's 
batting championship.[79] Until 1993, all of the ballparks featured natural 
grass, with Ponce being the first to install artificial turn during that 
year. The Senadores de San Juan defeated the Cuban national baseball team 
on December 1, 1993, with a walk-off home run by Javier López.[76] The 
1993–94 championship was won by San Juan, led by Carmelo Martínez in his 
second MVP season.[69] The Criollos rejoined the league for the 1994-95 
season and González returned to the team. The Cangrejeros won that year's 
championship, repeating Puerto Rico's title in the Caribbean Series.[81] 
The 1994-95 season however, is most famous for the once-in-a-lifetime Dream 
Team, that has been compared to the Murderer's Row of the New York Yankees 
during the Babe Ruth era. That year, the Senadores de San Juan managed 
by Luis "Torito" Meléndez won the title, subsequently assembling one of 
the strongest teams in the history of the Caribbean Series.[83] The group 
was dubbed the "Dream Team" and featured Major League Baseball players 
in most positions, including Roberto Alomar, Carlos Baerga, Bernie Williams, 
Juan González, Edgar Martínez, Carlos Delgado, Rubén Sierra, Rey Sánchez 
and Carmelo Martínez.[83] Puerto Rico's offensive dominated the tournament, 
eventually winning the Caribbean Series championship with an undefeated 
record of 6–0.[83] The team won against Pedro Martínez and José Rijo in 
the third and sixth games respectively.[83] Roberto Alomar, who had been 
traded to the team from Ponce for Javier López during the off-season, was 
named the series’ Most Valuable Player after batting 560 with two home 
runs. Later in 2011, Alomar was inducted into Major League Baseball's Hall 
of Fame.[73] In August 2007, it was announced that the 2007–2008 season 
was cancelled due to shrinking attendance and profits over the last 10 
years, and the league would instead work on a marketing plan and reorganization. 
In May 2008, it was announced that the league would come back for the 2008-09 
season, and that the Manatí Athenians would be moved once again to Santurce, 
and become the Santurce Crabbers. As part of the restructuring, Major League 
Baseball offered to work to increase publicity. On July 15, 2008, personnel 
from the league and Major League Baseball participated in a meeting where 
details about the league's merchandising were discussed.[84] Iván Rodríguez 
(also known as "Pudge") is recognized as one of the greatest catchers to 
ever play the game.[85] In preparation for the 2009 World Baseball Classic, 
Pudge returned to the Puerto Rico Baseball League during the offseason, 
following ten years of absence.[86] On January 8, 2008, the Leones de Ponce 
had reclaimed Rodríguez in the last turn of a special post-season draft, 
where players from eliminated teams were selected to reinforce those that 
qualified.[87] However, in the first week of December 2009, Rodríguez re-joined 
the Criollos de Caguas in the PRBL.[88] Playing for the Criollos de Caguas, 
he posted a batting average of .370, three RBIs and one home run in six 
games during the regular season. Upon leaving the team on vacation, Rodríguez 
announced his intention to return if the Criollos advanced to the playoffs.[89] 
He returned to action in a "sudden death" game for the final postseason 
space, but the team lost and was eliminated. On October 19, 2009, the league 
announced a contract with WIPR-TV to broadcast its games.[90] The 2009–10 
season was inaugurated on November 20, 2009, with games between Ponce and

year that the league had only five active participants since 1993–94 due 
to the Cangrejeros' recess. During this season, the inter-league games 
with the Dominican Winter Baseball League continued being included in the 
official record books of both organizations. Indios de Mayagüez won the

they beat the Criollos de Caguas, four games to one. Three games in this 
series went to extra innings.[92] In this same season, the board of directors 
elected Sadi Antonmattei to succeed Garcia as the president of the league.[93] 
The Criollos de Caguas are currently the dominant team in the Puerto Rico 
Baseball League. They were the league champs in 2010–2011 and 2012–2013, 
and the Indios de Mayagüez won in 2011–2012. On November 27, 2012, in a

the prisoners won convincingly by a score of 10-3.[94] The Puerto Rico
