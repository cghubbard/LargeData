Robert Bernard "Bob" Dillinger (September 17, 1918 – November 7, 2009) 
was a professional baseball player who played third base in the major leagues 
from 1946–51. He played for the St. Louis Browns, Philadelphia Athletics, 
Pittsburgh Pirates, and Chicago White Sox. Dillinger led the American League 
in hits in 1948 with 207, was an A.L. All-Star in 1949, and was the A.L. 
stolen base champion for three consecutive seasons. An excellent contact 
hitter, his career batting average in the majors was .306, amassing 888 
hits in 3,201 plate appearances. [1] Dillinger played his last four seasons 
(1952–55) in the Pacific Coast League, where he moved to the outfield and 
led the league in hitting with a .366 mark in 1953. Born in Glendale, California, 
Dillinger attended the University of Idaho in Moscow and played football 
for the Vandals, but broke his collarbone as a freshman in 1936 and was 
injured again as a sophomore; he left the school in the spring of 1938.[1]
