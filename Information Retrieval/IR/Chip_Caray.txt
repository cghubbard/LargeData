Harry Christopher "Chip" Caray III (born 1965) is a television broadcaster 
for Fox Sports South and Fox Sports Southeast's coverage of the Atlanta 
Braves baseball and Southeastern Conference basketball, and is an occasional 
radio broadcaster and co-host of the pre-game and post-game shows on the 
Atlanta Braves Radio Network.[1] Chip is also known from his time as a 
broadcaster for the Fox Saturday Game of the Week and as the television 
play-by-play broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs from 1998 to 2004. He is 
the son of broadcaster Skip Caray, the grandson of broadcaster Harry Caray 
and the older half-brother of broadcaster Josh Caray. Caray graduated from 
the University of Georgia in 1987 with a degree in journalism. Well before 
his first big job with Fox, he worked with local television stations in 
Panama City, Florida, and Greensboro, North Carolina. He was the play-by-play 
broadcaster for the Orlando Magic of the NBA from 1989 to 1996. He worked 
on baseball games for the Seattle Mariners of the American League from 
1993 to 1995. While broadcasting with the Mariners, Caray received a two-game 
tryout with the St. Louis Cardinals. After the 1994 season, he was expected 
to sign with St. Louis, but chose instead to remain with Seattle. Caray 
was also a broadcaster for the first edition of Major League Baseball on 
Fox in 1996. In 1998, Chip Caray was hired to work alongside his grandfather 
as broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs. Harry Caray died in February 1998, 
and Chip stayed with the team and took his grandfather's place as "the 
voice of the Cubs". He would go on to serve as their announcer for seven 
seasons, with Steve Stone providing the color commentary for most of those 
years. In 2004, both Caray and Stone left the Cubs booth after the season. 
On the final day of the 2004 season, Caray announced that he had signed 
a long-term contract with both TBS and Clear Channel to work alongside 
his father, Skip, broadcasting games for the Atlanta Braves, staying closer 
to his family, who lived in Orlando, Florida. Chip Caray also became a 
broadcaster for TBS's college football coverage of the Big 12 and Pac-10. 
In 2007, there was a major shake-up of the Braves broadcasters: Don Sutton 
departed to be the full-time broadcaster with the Washington Nationals, 
Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren went to the Braves Radio Network full-time, 
and Joe Simpson signed with Fox Broadcasting Company to be a color analyst 
on FSN South and Sports South, and also signed to call a limited schedule 
of games on TBS with Chip Caray. It was announced that Caray would be a 
broadcaster for TBS and also would be the main play-by-play broadcaster 
for TBS during its coverage of the Major League Baseball playoffs. TBS 
would cover all Division Series games and the National League Championship 
Series. Hall of Fame player Tony Gwynn called the playoff games with Caray. 
Caray has been criticized for making factual mistakes[2][3] during postseason 
broadcasts.[4][5] In response to such criticisms, Caray said, "It wasn't 
the job that I had when I came here in the first place. It would be like 
being a pinch-hitter or being a relief pitcher that works once every 10 
days. I'm better when I work more."[6] On November 30, 2009, TBS announced 
that Caray and the network decided to part ways. On December 21, 2009, 
Fox Sports South and SportSouth announced that Caray would be the play-by-play 
announcer for all 105 Braves games on the networks. The deal also includes 
selected college basketball games on the regional sports networks.[6] Chip 
Caray's grandfather, Harry, was a broadcaster famous for calling games 
of the St. Louis Cardinals, Oakland Athletics, Chicago White Sox and Chicago 
Cubs. His father, Skip, was the longtime broadcaster for the Atlanta Braves 
until he died in 2008. Chip Caray occasionally imitates his father with 
sarcastic comments made in a high, nasal voice. Caray also has a brother 
Josh, who is the radio broadcaster for the Rome Braves (the Class-A minor 
league affiliate of the Atlanta Braves). Chip is married to Susan. They 
have three sons, Christopher, Stefan, and Tristan, and a daughter, Summerlyn.
