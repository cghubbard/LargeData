Texas Longhorns athletics programs include the extramural and intramural 
sports teams of The University of Texas at Austin. These teams are referred 
to as the Texas Longhorns (or variously as Longhorns or 'Horns), taking 
their name from the Longhorn cattle that were an important part of the 
development of Texas, and are now the official "large animal" of the U.S. 
state of Texas.[2] The University of Texas at Austin is the flagship institution 
of the University of Texas System. The women's teams are sometimes called 
the Lady Longhorns, but generally both the men's and women's teams are 
referred to as the Longhorns, and the mascot is a Texas Longhorn steer 
named Bevo. The Longhorn nickname appeared in Texas newspapers by 1900.[3] 
The University of Texas at Austin offers a wide variety of varsity and 
intramural sports programs. Due to the breadth of sports offered and the 
quality of the programs, Texas was selected as "America's Best Sports College" 
in a 2002 analysis performed by Sports Illustrated. Texas was also listed 
as the number one Collegiate Licensing Company client from 2005–2013 in 
regards to the amount of annual trademark royalties received from the sales 
of its fan merchandise.[4] Texas is the only remaining NCAA Division I 
school to operate separate men's and women's athletic departments, after 
the other remaining holdout, the University of Tennessee,[5] merged its 
men's and women's athletic departments at the end of the 2011–12 academic 
year.[6] A charter member of the Southwest Conference until its dissolution 
in 1996, the Texas Longhorns now compete in the Big 12 Conference, as a 
member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The school's colors 
are officially Orange (Pantone 159) and White, with Burnt Orange — also 
known as Texas Orange – being the specific shade of orange used.[7][8] 
The University of Texas Longhorn Band performs the alma mater ("The Eyes 
of Texas")[9] as well as the university fight song ("Texas Fight") at various 
sporting events. Over the years, Longhorn sports teams have won 50 total 
national championships,[10] 43 of which are NCAA National Championships.[11] 
The University of Texas currently fields a varsity team in nine men's sports 
and eleven women's sports.[12] They are: Two Texas Longhorn running backs 
have won college football's most prestigious individual award, the Heisman 
Trophy: Earl Campbell (1978) and Ricky Williams (1998). Seventeen Longhorn 
players and two Longhorn coaches have been inducted into the College Football 
Hall of Fame,[13] while four are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame.[14] Other Longhorn players have also received recognition for their 
performance. Texas is the third ranked NCAA Division I FBS program in college 
football history, in terms of total wins, having passed Notre Dame with 
win 831 on November 27, 2008.[15] As of the end of the 2015 season, the 
Longhorns' all-time record is 886–354–33 (.709). Only the University of 
Michigan has won more games and a greater percentage of games played than 
Texas,[16] which recorded its 800th victory with the Longhorns' 41–38 win 
over the USC Trojans in the 2006 BCS National Championship Game at the 
Rose Bowl. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the program was somewhat 
less successful, but the Longhorns have since returned to prominence in 
college football, finishing in the top six of the AP and coaches' polls 
in 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009. The University of Texas team 
plays home games in Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium which has a 
seating capacity of 100,119.[17] Renovations began on the stadium November 
14, 2005, two days following the last home football game of the 2005 season. 
The improvements were completed before the 2008 football season, and included 
additional seating[18] and the nation's first high definition video display 
in a collegiate facility nicknamed "Godzillatron."[19] The University completed 
a $27 million expansion and renovation to the south end zone facilities 
in August 2009 which added 4,525 permanent bleacher seats and changed the 
playing surface to FieldTurf. With the new permanent bleacher seating section 
added behind the south end zone and the total remodeling of the north end 
zone completed in 2008, the stadium's official capacity now stands at 100,119. 
This was surpassed when 101,357[20] saw #3-ranked Texas beat Kansas 51–20[21] 
on November 21, 2009. The Longhorns are currently coached by Charlie Strong, 
who came to Texas in January 2014 after being head coach at Louisville. 
Mack Brown became the head football coach for Texas in 1998. From 1998 
through the 2008–2009 season, the Longhorns had a 124–27 win-loss record. 
In his first six years at Texas, Brown had a winning record but he had 
not managed to win the Big 12 conference or to lead the Longhorns into 
a Bowl Championship Series game. He was often lauded for his recruiting 
while being criticized for failing to win championships. That changed with 
the 2004 Texas Longhorns football team who played in the 2005 Rose Bowl 
against the Wolverines of the University of Michigan. The game was the 
first meeting between the two storied teams and the Longhorns' first trip 
to the Rose Bowl. In a classic game that featured five lead changes and 
three tie scores during the course of play, the Longhorns defeated the 
Wolverines 38–37 on a successful 38-yard field goal by place kicker Dusty 
Mangum as time expired. It was the first time the Rose Bowl had ever been 
decided on the closing play, and it earned the Longhorns a top 5 finish 
in the polls. Three ex-Longhorns from the 2005 Rose Bowl team — Cedric 
Benson, Derrick Johnson, and Bo Scaife — were selected in the 2005 NFL 
Draft. Brown followed up the strong 2004 season on the field with an extremely 
successful 2005 recruiting season by securing the top-ranked recruiting 
class (the 2005 recruiting season is for players entering the University 
in Fall 2006). With the exception of Cedric Benson, Derrick Johnson, and 
Bo Scaife, Texas returned most of their key players from 2004–2005, including 
red-shirt Junior Quarterback Vince Young. The 2005 Texas Longhorns football 
team was given a pre-season No. 2 ranking (behind defending National Champions 
University of Southern California) by Sports Illustrated magazine, and 
was also ranked second in the AP and USA Today coaches' pre-season polls. 
They maintained those rankings throughout the entire 2005–2006 season. 
Texas and USC ended up winning out their seasons and faced each other in 
the National Championship, which Texas won, 41–38. At the conclusion of 
the 2005–2006 season, Sports Illustrated issued a special commemorative 
edition that featured Vince Young shouting in triumph amidst a storm of 
multi-colored confetti. Features in the special edition included a story 
on Vince Young's Glory Days by author Tim Layden, as well as a story dissecting 
How the Rose Bowl was won by Austin Murphy. The issue was on sale nationwide 
alongside the regular edition of the magazine, which also featured the 
Rose Bowl on the cover. The 2006 Texas Longhorns football team hoped to 
repeat as national champions. The Texas Longhorns returned several offensive 
(7) and defensive (7) starters from their National Title team, but quarterback 
Vince Young elected to go the NFL which left freshman Colt McCoy as the 
starting quarterback. The Longhorns opened the season with a win at home 
against North Texas. Their second game, against Ohio State, was one of 
the most anticipated college football games of the regular season.[22][23][24] 
The Longhorns lost that game, but then defeated Rice, Iowa State and Sam 
Houston State by a combined score of 145–24. Then they defeated 14th-ranked 
Oklahoma 28–10 in the Red River Rivalry. The Longhorns lost their last 
two regular season games to Kansas State (45–42) and Texas A&M (12–7). 
A victory against A&M would have clinched the Big 12 South Division title 
for the Longhorns. As a result of the loss, Oklahoma won the division and 
played in the Big 12 Championship game. The Alamo Bowl, with the 5th pick 
of Big 12 conference teams selected the Longhorns to play against unranked 
Iowa who had placed 8th in the Big Ten conference. With Colt McCoy at quarterback, 
the Longhorns narrowly defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes 26–24. The 2007 Texas 
Longhorn football team began play on September 1, 2007. Texas entered the 
2007 season ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning 
percentage. They were ranked in the Top 10 by numerous pre-season polls. 
For instance, a pre-season ranking by ESPN writer Mark Schlabach had the 
Longhorns ranked eighth;[25] Rivals.com has them at ninth.[26] College 
Football News[27] and Real Football 365[28] both had the Longhorns ranked 
third. The Longhorns come into the season ranked fourth in both the Coaches' 
Poll[29] and AP Poll.[30] The Longhorns failed to make good on that ranking, 
however, dropping to number 20 in the BCS standings after losing to conference 
foes Kansas State, Oklahoma, and Texas A&M. The 2008 Texas Longhorn football 
team entered the season with freshmen athletes at many positions, no definite 
starting running back and appeared to lack talent at key positions. The 
Longhorns were projected to post a 9–3 during the 2008 season, and were 
ranked Nos. 11 and 10 in the AP Poll and the USA Today Coaches Poll, respectively.[31] 
Despite doubt surrounding the season, the Longhorns rallied to an 8–0 start, 
including a four game in-conference stretch against opponents ranked in 
the top 12 football teams in the country. During that stretch, the Texas 
Longhorns defeated BCS ranked No. 1 Oklahoma, No. 11 Missouri, and No. 
7 Oklahoma State before losing to No. 7 Texas Tech on November 1, 2008. 
On January 5, 2009, Texas defeated No. 10 (according to final BCS rankings) 
Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl 24–21. The loss to No. 7 Texas Tech was the 
only loss for the 2008 Texas Longhorns, finishing 12–1 overall, 5–1 in 
the Big 12 Conference South Division and No. 3 in the BCS rankings, No. 
4 in the final AP Poll, and No. 3 in the final USA Today Coaches Poll. 
The 2009 Texas Longhorn football team entered the season with a veteran 
quarterback in Colt McCoy and high hopes of winning a National Championship. 
The Longhorns were ranked No. 2 in both the AP Poll and the USA Today Coaches 
Poll.[32] The Longhorns finished the season 13–1, and 8–0 in Big 12 play. 
They represented the Big 12 South Division in the Big 12 Championship Game 
where, on a last second field goal, they defeated Nebraska 13–12 to become 
Big 12 Champions. The Longhorns finished the regular season ranked No. 
2 in the Bowl Championship Series to earn a birth in the BCS Championship 
Game where they were defeated by Alabama 37–21 after an early injury to 
Colt McCoy. Texas finished the season ranked No. 2 in the AP and coaches 
poll.[33] In 2010, after losing six players to the NFL Draft, the Texas 
Longhorns finished with their worst record under Mack Brown, going 5–7 
and finishing last in the Big 12 South, ending a string of nine 10 or more 
win seasons. The only signature win of the season was a 20–13 upset in 
Lincoln over Nebraska in their final in-conference match-up. 2011 looked 
to be a rebuilding year for the Longhorns. They finished the season 9–4, 
5–4 in Big 12 play to finish in a tie for third place. They were invited 
to the Holiday Bowl where they defeated The University of California, Berkeley. 
The 2011 campaign was viewed as a slight improvement from the disastrous 
previous season, although many amongst the fan base continued to find problems. 
Quarterback issues proved to be the biggest thorn in the side of the recovering 
Longhorns throughout the season. Quarterback Garrett Gilbert was named 
the starter for the Longhorns August 29 in their season opening against 
Rice University. However, on September 12, it was announced that Gilbert 
was being moved to the second string quarterback behind Case McCoy and 
David Ash who would be sharing the starting position for the duration of 
the season. On September 20, it was announced that Gilbert underwent successful 
surgery on his shoulder and will be out the remainder of the season. Knowing 
that his future in Austin looked bleak, Gilbert sought an unconditional 
release, which was granted to him on October 5.[34] Gilbert finished his 
degree at Texas before moving to Southern Methodist University in Dallas 
to continue his football career. The Texas Longhorn football program has 
produced 120 All-American selections (93 players), with 48 of these being 
Consensus All-American selections (41 players) and 21 of these being Unanimous 
All-American selections (18 players).[35][36] (As chosen by the Austin 
American-Statesman on September 9, 2005.) Offense Defense Coach – Darrell 
Royal (1957–1976) Honorary captain – Louis Jordan (1911–1914) – Note: First 
Texas player to make the Walter Camp All-American team. He was later killed 
in battle while fighting in France during World War II. The Texas men's 
basketball team has achieved national prominence under head coach Rick 
Barnes in recent years. Barnes has guided Texas to a school-record twelve 
consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and a school-best eleven consecutive 
20-win seasons as of March 11, 2010. Hired as the twenty-third men's basketball 
coach in University of Texas history on April 12, 1998, Rick Barnes left 
Clemson University to take over a Longhorn program coming off of a losing 
season and "in disarray."[52] Former head coach Tom Penders had resigned 
after a scandal involving his unlawful release of player Luke Axtell's 
grades to the media. Longhorn players Axtell, Chris Mihm, Gabe Muoneke, 
and Bernard Smith had met with Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds "to 
say that they had lost faith in Penders and his program."[52][53] Despite 
playing with just seven scholarship players for the majority of the 1998–1999 
season – and opening the season with a 3–8 record – Barnes engineered one 
of the greatest mid-season turnarounds in school history. The Longhorns 
won 16 of their final 21 games, posting a 13–3 record in conference play 
and winning the school's first regular season Big 12 Conference championship 
by a two-game margin, and finishing the year at 19–13, with a No. 7 seed 
in the NCAA Tournament. In 2002, the Longhorns advanced to the NCAA Sweet 
Sixteen for the first time since the 1996–97 season, and for only the third 
time since the expansion of the tournament to 64 participants in 1985. 
The 2003 Longhorn basketball team matched the school record for most basketball 
victories in a season with their 26–7 mark and advanced to the NCAA Tournament 
Final Four round for the first time in 56 years, and for the third time 
in school history. Along the way, Texas earned its highest ranking in both 
the Associated Press and the ESPN/USA Today polls in school history (No. 
2 in both polls on Dec 2, 2002) and received its first No. 1 seed in the 
NCAA Tournament. Sophomore point guard T. J. Ford became the first male 
player for Texas to earn the Naismith and Wooden Awards as college basketball's 
Player of the Year in 2003. Despite the early departure of Ford to the 
NBA as the eighth overall pick (Milwaukee Bucks), Texas compiled a 25–8 
overall record in 2004 and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen round for a school-record 
third consecutive year. The four senior starters on the 2004 team graduated 
as the winningest class in school history (98 wins) to that point. In 2006, 
the Longhorns recorded the program's first 30-win season (30–7), claimed 
a share of the Big 12 Conference regular season championship, received 
a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and advanced to the Elite Eight (Texas 
fell to LSU in overtime), marking the fourth time in five years that Texas 
had advanced to at least the NCAA Sweet Sixteen. The 2006 class, which 
finished with 101 wins in four years, bested the 2004 class' mark of 98 
wins to become the winningest class in the history of Longhorn basketball. 
The 2005–06 season also marked the 100th anniversary of basketball at the 
University of Texas. Special logos were placed on the uniforms to commemorate 
this anniversary. In 2007, the men's basketball team was ranked sixth by 
the Harris Poll for favorite men's college basketball teams, moving up 
one spot from the previous year.[54] The women's basketball team has long 
been a national power, especially during the late 1980s (winning a National 
Title in 1986) and through the 1990s. Both teams play home games in the 
Frank Erwin Special Events Center. The adjacent Denton A. Cooley Pavilion 
serves as the training and practice facility for both the men's and women's 
teams. The Texas Longhorns are the winningest team in college baseball 
history, both in terms of total wins and in terms of win percentage.[citation 
needed] Texas holds the records for most appearances in the College World 
Series (35) and most individual CWS games won. The Longhorns have won six 
NCAA baseball national championships (1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002, and 
2005) — second only to Southern California's total of 12 – and have appeared 
in the CWS Championship Game or Championship Series on six other occasions 
(1953, 1984, 1985, 1989, 2004, and 2009). Former Longhorns who have gone 
on to success in Major League Baseball include Roger Clemens, Bibb Falk, 
Ron Gardenhire, Calvin Schiraldi, Burt Hooton, Keith Moreland, Spike Owen, 
Greg Swindell, Huston Street, Omar Quintanilla, Taylor Teagarden, Sam LeCure 
and Drew Stubbs. From 1997 to 2016, the Longhorns were led by head coach 
Augie Garrido, the winningest coach in NCAA baseball history.[56] The team 
plays its home games at Disch-Falk Field. The University of Texas Longhorn's 
Softball team is Head Coached by Connie Clark and assisted by Jennifer 
McFalls and Corrie Hill. The team has made seven consecutive trips to the 
NCAA tournament and have failed twice in the last two years ('10 and '11) 
at home in Regionals. The University of Texas has a strong golf tradition, 
winning national titles back-to-back in 1971 and 1972 and again in 2012, 
and finishing runner-up four other times. Individual national champions 
were Edward White (1935), Ben Crenshaw (1971, 1972, and 1973), Tom Kite 
(1972), and Justin Leonard (1994). Longhorns who have won the U.S. Amateur 
include Justin Leonard and David Gossett. Two-time U.S. Junior Amateur 
champion Jordan Spieth played for the Longhorns golf team in 2011 and 2012. 
Several former Longhorn players have gone on to success on the PGA Tour 
including: Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw, Phil Blackmar, Mark Brooks, Bob Estes, 
Justin Leonard, and Jordan Spieth. Legendary golf instructor Harvey Penick 
was a long-time coach at Texas. The team is currently coached by John Fields 
and Ryan Murphy.[57] The men's program is coached by Bubba Thornton who 
was also the men's US Olympic coach in 2008; as a team, the Longhorn men 
placed fourth in the 2008 NCAA outdoor championships. Other notable coaches 
of the Texas men's program have included Stan Huntsman (Texas coach, 1986–95), 
who was also the coach of the 1988 US Olympic team, and Clyde Littlefield 
(Texas coach, 1920–60), the 1925 co-founder of the annual Texas Relays. 
The men have won four consecutive Big 12 Indoor Championships. The Longhorn 
track and field programs have produced numerous Olympians for various nations. 
Male medalists include Winthrop Graham (Jamaica, silver, 400m hurdles, 
1992 and 4 × 400 m relay, 1988), Patrick Sang (Kenya, silver, 3000m steeplechase, 
1992), Du'aine Ladejo (Great Britain, bronze, 4 × 400 m relay, 1992), Johnny 
Lam Jones (USA, gold, 4 × 100 m relay, 1976), Eddie Southern (USA, silver, 
400m hurdles, 1956), and Dean Smith (athlete) (USA, gold, 4 × 100 m relay, 
1952). In the 2008 Beijing Olympics, former Longhorns Leonel Manzano, Trey 
Hardee, Andra Manson, Michelle Carter, Marshevet Hooker, and Sanya Richards 
represented the United States. Richards won a bronze medal in the 400 meters 
and a gold in the 4 × 400 meter relay. Jamaican Melaine Walker won gold 
in the 400 meter hurdles. The Texas Longhorn women placed seventh in the 
2008 Big 12 outdoor championships. The women's program is coached by Beverly 
Kearney, who has guided the Lady Longhorns to six NCAA Championships: Indoor 
Championships in 1998, 1999, and 2006, and Outdoor Championships in 1998, 
1999, and 2005. Other notable coaches have included Terry Crawford whose 
teams won Indoor Championships in 1986, 1988, and 1990, and Outdoor Championships 
in 1982 and 1986. Crawford's athletes also won the 1986 Women's Cross Country 
Championship. The program's first title was the 1982 AIAW outdoor track 
and field championship. The Longhorn track and field programs have produced 
numerous Olympians for various nations. Female Olympic medalists have included 
Sanya Richards and Moushami Robinson (USA, gold, 4 × 400 meter relay, 2004), 
Sandie Richards (Jamaica, silver, 4 × 400 m relay, 2000 and 2004), Merlene 
Frazer (Jamaica, silver, 4 × 100 m relay, 2000), Nanceen Perry (USA, bronze, 
4 × 100 m relay, 2000), Carlette Guidry (USA, gold, 4 × 100 m relay, 1992 
and 1996), Juliet Cuthbert (Jamaica, silver, 100m and 200m, 1992 and bronze, 
4 × 100 m relay, 1996), and Nikole Mitchell (Jamaica, bronze, 4 × 100 m 
relay, 1996). Texas has finished among the top 25 in the nation 19 out 
of the last 23 years, with 1988 and 2012 NCAA National Championships, as 
well as runner-up finishes in 1995 and 2009. They also won an AIAW national 
championship in 1981. The team is currently coached by Jerritt Elliott 
and plays home games in Gregory Gymnasium. Texas has finished the Big 12 
conference in third place or higher every year for 8 out of 12 years, finishing 
1st in 1997, 2007, 2008 and 2009, 2nd in 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005 and 3rd 
in 1999 & 2006. Texas volleyball has produced many All-Americans, and in 
2007, they won the program's first Big 12 title since 1997, sharing the 
title with Nebraska, breaking Nebraska's 3-year streak of winning the title 
outright. They also earned the programs first AVCA National Freshman of 
the Year since 1995 in 2007, for Big 12 Freshman of the Year Juliann Faucette. 
Texas has won eleven National Titles in men's swimming and diving (1981, 
1988–1991, 1996, 2000–2002, 2010, 2015) and nine in Women's Swimming and 
Diving (1981–82, 1984–88, 1990–91) making swimming and diving the most 
successful Texas athletics program by far, based on number of national 
titles. The men's swimming team is currently coached by Eddie Reese and 
Kris Kubik and the diving team by Matt Scoggin. Reese has coached numerous 
former and current world record holders while at Texas, including many 
competing in the summer olympic games for the United States and other home 
nations. The swim team was first developed under Coach Tex Robertson.[58] 
The women's rowing team was established in the fall of 1998.[59] At the 
team's first appearance at the NCAA championships in 2003, its varsity 
8 placed 12th nationally. The team won the inaugural Big 12 Championship 
in 2009 and kept the championship title for the following three years. 
Additionally, the Texas women's rowing team won the 2011 Conference USA 
Championship. In June 2014, Dave O’Neill was appointed head coach of the 
program.[60] Founded in 1985, the Texas Longhorns rugby team plays in the 
Allied Rugby Conference, and plays its postseason in the Varsity Cup Championship. 
The Longhorns rugby program has been improving in recent years.[61] Texas 
rugby has instituted a combine to identify the most elite athletes on campus 
with an eye towards recruiting them to play rugby.[62] The increasing popularity 
of rugby in the United States and the announcement that rugby would return 
to the Summer Olympics led Texas to upgrade the designation of its rugby 
program from club to Olympic.[63] The Texas Rugby Alumni association and 
the Texas Exes have begun an endowment to award scholarships to Texas rugby 
players, which is viewed as a vital recruitment tool.[64] The Longhorns' 
improvement led to Texas winning the Southwest Conference in the 2011–12 
season to qualify for the sweet sixteen of the 2012 national championship 
playoffs.[65] Texas won the 2012 Southwest 7s tournament to qualify for 
the 2012 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships.[66] The Longhorns 
rugby program has been boosted by its participation in the Collegiate Rugby 
Championship, the highest profile college rugby competition in the US, 
which is broadcast live on NBC. In the 2011 CRC, Texas defeated Big 12 
rival Oklahoma to reach the quarterfinals. Following Texas' participation 
in the 2011 CRC, Texas "raised an additional $10,000 from alumni, landed 
a new apparel sponsor, and have been contacted by 90 students (including 
two DBs from the football team) who want to play rugby."[67] In the 2012 
CRC, Texas defeated its rival Oklahoma to again reach the quarterfinals 
of the tournament. The Longhorns rugby program reached a new all-time high 
during the 2013–2014 season. Texas won the 2013 Southwest Conference 7s 
Championship advancing them to the 2013 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National 
Championships, where they finished ranked #12 in the nation.[68] Months 
later Texas won the 2014 Southwest Conference 15s Championship, making 
them the first team in the conference to win both the 7s and 15s championships 
in the same season. The Longhorns finished the season with their first 
participation in The Varsity Cup Championship, where they finished in the 
top 8.[69] Several Longhorn athletes have had success at the Summer Olympics 
over the years. Since 1948, Texas Longhorns have won 117 medals at the 
Summer Olympics, including 68 gold medals, 31 silver medals, and 18 bronze 
medals. The table at right shows a breakdown of the Longhorn Summer Olympics 
by year. Texas has won 44 NCAA team national championships.[72] Below are 
9 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: Below are 9 
national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: [73] * Denotes 
shared conference title † Denotes an AIAW Championship. The University 
of Texas began NCAA and Southwest Conference competition in women's sports 
for the 1982–83 season. The university's biggest rival at one time was 
Texas A&M University.[74][75] However, in football, Texas considers the 
Oklahoma Sooners to be a more significant rival. According to Bill Little, 
the Longhorn's Assistant Athletic Director, the rivalry against A&M is 
"based on respect", while the rivalry against Oklahoma is "based on anger".[76] 
Other teams have also been considered to be rivals of the Longhorns in 
various sports.[77][78][79][80] This list includes several other colleges 
in Texas, such as Texas Christian, Baylor, Rice,[81] Texas Tech,[82] and 
Houston.[83] Texas is also one of the biggest rivals of the University 
of Arkansas[84] which may be attributed to their long tenure as the two 
eponymous state schools of the former Southwest Conference, or to the 1969 
game between the two, which decided the national championship in favor 
of the Longhorns.[85][86] Texas has a long-standing, bitter rivalry with 
the University of Oklahoma. The football game between the University of 
Texas and Oklahoma is commonly known as the "Red River Shootout" and is 
held annually in Dallas, Texas at the Cotton Bowl. This name has come to 
refer to the two schools' contests in other major team sports as well. 
Since 2005, the football game has received sponsorship dollars in return 
for being referred to as the "SBC Red River Rivalry"[87] (changed to AT&T 
Red River Rivalry in 2006 when SBC changed its corporate name to AT&T), 
a move which has been criticized both for its commercialism[88] and its 
political correctness.[89] In recent years, this rivalry has taken on added 
significance, since both football programs have been highly ranked and 
compete in the same division of the Big 12 conference. In 2005, The Dallas 
Morning News did an opinion poll of the 119 Division 1A football coaches 
as to the nations top rivalry game in college football. The Texas–Oklahoma 
game was ranked third.[90] The annual football game with Texas A&M usually 
took place on the weekend of Thanksgiving each year, though it was moved 
to the first weekend in December in 1994 due to A&M's TV restriction during 
probation. In either case, the Texas-Texas A&M game was the last regular 
season contest for each team. The Longhorns lead the series 76–37–5. In 
an attempt to generate more attention for the rivalry in sports other than 
football, in 2004 the two schools started the Lone Star Showdown,[91] which 
began as a two-year trial program and has continued ever since. Essentially, 
each time the two schools meet in a sport, the winner of the matchup gets 
a point. In sports wherein the teams meet twice one half point is awarded 
for a victory. If more contests than two occur, such as in baseball, the 
series winner gets one point. At the end of the year, the school with the 
most points wins the series and receives a trophy. In the event of a tie 
the current holder retains the trophy as did A&M after the '08–'09 season. 
Texas leads the series 6–2. Aspects of the rivalry include: With Texas 
A&M's move to the Southeastern Conference, the Lone Star Showdown's final 
game was played on November 24, 2011 at Kyle Field. The Longhorns won a 
thriller, 27–25, on a last second field goal. Another game between Texas 
and Texas A&M will not happen until at least 2018, according to Texas athletic 
director DeLoss Dodds. The 2011 game marked the end of the 118-year Thanksgiving 
Day tradition. The Longhorns and Red Raiders football teams compete annually 
for a traveling trophy called the Chancellor's Spurs. The exchange began 
in 1996, and the Longhorns lead the football series 48–15. A long-standing 
more historic rivalry with the Rice Owls that has been largely dominated 
by Texas since their days in the Southwest Conference is still played almost 
annually, with Texas winning the latest matchup (2015 contest) 42–28. The 
Rice Owls last victory in the rivalry came in 1994 when they beat Texas 
19–17 at Rice Stadium on ESPN and the Owls went on to win the Southwest 
Conference that year. Major sporting facilities and their main use include: 
In addition, the University of Texas has numerous practice, training, and 
intramural facilities. The University of Texas is a tradition-rich school, 
and many of those traditions are associated with athletics events, especially 
football. Some Longhorn traditions include: For nine straight years (2005–2013), 
Texas was listed as the number one Collegiate Licensing Company client 
in regards to the amount of annual trademark royalties received from the 
sales of its fan merchandise.[4] Schools that are not members of Collegiate 
Licensing Company however are not ranked in the listing.[105] Money from 
merchandising sales goes to the university, as opposed to being earmarked 
specifically for athletics programs.[4] On January 20, 2011, the UT athletic 
department announced plans to launch a 24-hour channel devoted entirely 
to UT sports and academic activities at the University of Texas.[106] This 
channel, a joint venture with ESPN, takes advantage of a clause in new 
Big 12 Conference television contracts allowing Texas a bigger share of 
revenues than the conference's other members; in turn, it was part of the 
agreement to keep the conference together amidst a full-scale plan by the 
Pac-10 Conference to raid Big 12 members. (The Pac-10 only gained one Big 
12 school, Colorado). Both sides hoped to launch the channel for the 2011–2012 
academic year, but needed carriage commitments first. Banners with the 
name "ESPN Texas" was visible during segments of SportsCenter and other 
programs originating from Sundance Square in Fort Worth, Texas in the week 
prior to Super Bowl XLV. The channel was launched in August 2011 as the 
Longhorn Network. Before its launch, the network had controversial plans 
to air high school football games, an institution throughout the state 
of Texas. Currently, the state's governing body for public high school 
sports, the University Interscholastic League, prohibits live game telecasts 
on Friday nights. It had also been speculated that any telecast on the 
new channel, regardless of when it aired, could violate NCAA rules against 
unfair recruiting inducements.[107] This was especially an issue for Texas 
A&M; in fact, the plans for the network to air high school games directly 
led to A&M's decision in July, 2011, to leave the Big 12 for the SEC.[108] 
The Big 12 then approved a temporary rule in August 2011 banning the planned 
high school telecasts,[109] and within two weeks, the NCAA ruled that no 
school or conference network could broadcast high school games, ending 
that particular controversy.[110][111] The University of Texas is known 
to have a big group of powerful boosters that help support a third of the 
budget of the athletics department.[112] The main people known to be involved
