Josh Gibson Field is a baseball venue located in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania. Until 2008, the field was known as Ammon Field or sometimes 
Ammons Field, which had served as the home of the Pittsburgh Keystones 
of the Negro National League in 1922, their only season in the NNL. It 
is now named after Baseball Hall of Fame player Josh Gibson. Gibson began 
his career at Ammon Field in 1929 while playing with the Pittsburgh Crawfords, 
who were visiting the Keystones, and continued playing there, as the Crawfords 
and Homestead Grays regularly played at Ammon. Known as the "black Babe 
Ruth,"[2] Gibson was a leading home run hitter until his death from a stroke 
in 1947 at age 35. In 1972, he became the second Negro Leagues player inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Originally a youth semi-pro team, the Crawfords 
eventually played at Ammon Field, earned a strong reputation and attracted 
games with many white teams. W.O.W., the defending champions of the white 
Greater Pittsburgh Semipro Tournament, played the Crawfords at Ammon on 
June 15, 1930. Although usually covering on the fully professional Homestead 
Grays, the Pittsburgh Courier reported the 9â€“8 Crawfords victory. Grays 
owner and manager Cum Posey recognized the Crawfords competition with his 
own team and sought to undermine their appeal. In 1929, he persuaded Crawfords 
manager Hooks Tinker to take on his older brother Seward "See" Posey as 
a part-time assistant and booker. While admission to the Crawfords amateur 
games were free by law, at one tournament in 1930, See Posey closed all 
but one gate to the park and required fans to make contribution, with two 
police officers stationed at the gate. After the game, he brought Tinker 
a burlap bag with $2000 in small bills.[3] The Posey brothers were also 
able to lure Gibson to play with the Grays. Probably Ammon Field was split 
into two smaller fields in the 1940s, when youth leagues began playing 
at the location. In 1996, a historical marker commemorating Josh Gibson's 
career was erected at the site, 2217 Bedford Avenue. It reads: "Hailed 
as Negro Leagues' greatest slugger, he hit some 800 home runs in a baseball 
career that began here at Ammons [sic] Field in 1929. Played for Homestead 
Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords, 1930-46. Elected to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame, '72." The original name of the park honored Edith Darlington Ammon, 
a pioneer in establishing playgrounds in the city.[4] The Josh Gibson Foundation 
is a non-profit organization based in Pittsburgh aimed at preserving the 
history of the Negro Leagues. The Foundation's president is Gibson's grandson 
Sean.[5] The Foundation runs a little league associated with PONY Baseball 
that has over 300 inner-city players, which has used the field since 1999. 
In 2008, the Foundation began a $292,000 renovation ($321,471 today) of 
the field. The project consisted of resurfacing the grass fields, renovating 
the four dugouts and bleachers, and constructing scoreboards, sprinklers, 
and a concession stand.[6] The project received funding of $78,000 from 
Pittsburgh Pirates Charities, $64,000 from the Baseball Tomorrow Fund, 
$20,000 from Del Monte Foods and $15,000 from The Grable Foundation. The 
City of Pittsburgh contributed the additional $95,000 required. The Pittsburgh-based 
Massaro Corporation served as the contractor for construction work, and 
Sports Turf Specialties, Inc performed the field work. Both companies offered 
significant discounts on the work.[7] A groundbreaking ceremony took place
