Charles Dewayne Hayes (born May 29, 1965) is an American retired professional 
baseball third baseman. Hayes played in Major League Baseball for the San 
Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, Colorado Rockies, 
Pittsburgh Pirates, Milwaukee Brewers, and Houston Astros from 1988 through 
2001. He was a member of the Yankees' 1996 World Series championship team 
over the Atlanta Braves. He batted and threw right-handed. Played for the 
South Region champions (Hub City from Hattiesburg, Mississippi) in the 
first round of the 1977 Little League World Series. The San Francisco Giants 
drafted Hayes in the fourth round of the 1983 Major League Baseball (MLB) 
Draft. He made his MLB debut with the Giants on September 11, 1988, where 
he hit .091 over seven games. On June 18, 1989, the Giants traded Hayes 
with Dennis Cook and Terry Mulholland to the Philadelphia Phillies for 
Steve Bedrosian and a player to be named later, who turned out to be Rick 
Parker. On August 15, 1990, he was a decisive part of a unique baseball 
game. While Mulholland pitched a no hitter, not giving up a single hit, 
walking, or hitting a batsman, and retired every opposing player he faced, 
Parker, reached base on a throwing error by Hayes, spoiling an otherwise 
perfect game.[1] Hayes later redeemed himself, however, by snaring Gary 
Carter's line drive for the final out of the 9th inning and thus preserved 
Mulholland's no-hitter. Before the 1992 season, Hayes was traded to the 
New York Yankees to complete a trade made on January 8, 1992, where the 
Phillies acquired Darrin Chapin from the Yankees for a player to be named 
later. He hit .257 with a career-high 100 strikeouts. After the 1992 season, 
the Colorado Rockies drafted Hayes from the Yankees as the third pick in 
the 1992 MLB expansion draft. The Yankees attempted to revoke Hayes' assignment 
with the Rockies, charging that the Florida Marlins were not properly compensating 
the Yankees for lost territory in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the Yankees 
had a minor league team. The Commissioner of Baseball rejected the claim, 
and Hayes joined the Rockies.[2] Hayes was part of the inaugural Rockies 
team in 1993 and played third base during their first ever game. During 
the season, he compiled a career-high 25 home runs, 45 doubles, and 98 
runs batted in. In 1994, he compiled 23 doubles and 50 runs batted in before 
the 1994â€“95 Major League Baseball strike unexpectedly ended the season. 
He was granted free agency on December 23. Hayes signed with the Phillies 
for the 1995 season, where he hit 11 home runs and 85 RBIs. He became a 
free agent after the 1995 season, and signed a four-year contract with 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. With the Pirates, he hit .248 over 128 games to 
begin the season. On August 30, 1996, the Pirates traded Hayes to the New 
York Yankees for a player to be named later, later choosing Chris Corn.[3] 
Hayes hit .284 over 20 games in for the Yankees during the season, and 
was added to the postseason roster. He appeared in three games during the 
1996 American League Division Series against the Texas Rangers and was 
one for seven with a run batted in. During the 1996 American League Championship 
Series against the Baltimore Orioles, Hayes played in four games and went 
one for seven with two walks. Hayes played in five of the six games in 
the 1996 World Series, collecting three hits and one run batted in, along 
with five strikeouts.[3] In Game 6 of the 1996 World Series, he caught 
Mark Lemke's pop up in foul territory behind third base to end the game 
and give the Yankees their first World Series championship since 1978.[4] 
Hayes hit .258 over 100 games for the Yankees in 1997, including 53 runs 
batted in and 40 walks. In the 1997 American League Division Series against 
the Cleveland Indians, he went 5 for 15 with one run batted in. After the 
series, the Yankees traded Hayes to the Giants for Alberto Castillo and 
Chris Singleton. Hayes played in 111 games in 1998 and his batting average 
increased to .286 while hitting 12 home runs and driving in 62 runs. The 
next year, he saw his playing time decrease as he saw action in just 95 
games, his lowest total since 1989.[3] He finished the season with a dismal 
.205 average while collecting just 54 hits, then a career low. Hayes became 
a free agent again after the 1999 season, and he signed with the New York 
Mets on January 20, 2000. They released him during spring training, however, 
and he instead caught on with the Milwaukee Brewers for the 2000 season. 
During the season, he hit a very respectable .251 while driving in 46 runs.[3] 
He signed with the Houston Astros for the 2001 season, but collected just 
10 hits over 31 games (a .200 average) and was released on July 9.[3] In 
a 14-season career, Hayes posted a .262 batting average with 144 home runs 
and 740 RBI in 1,547 games played. Hayes currently gives baseball lessons 
and operates a team along with a facility for the instruction of baseball, 
called "Big League Baseball Academy" in Tomball, Texas. His son Tyree pitched 
professionally from 2006 through 2012. On July 19, 2009, Hayes made his 
first appearance at the Yankees annual Old-Timers' Day.[5] He returned 
to Old-Timers' Day again in 2010,[6] 2011,[7] 2012, 2013, and 2014. His 
son, Ke'Bryan Hayes, was selected 32nd overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates
