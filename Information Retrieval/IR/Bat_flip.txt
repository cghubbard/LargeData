In baseball, a bat flip is the exaggerated throwing of a baseball bat after 
making contact with the baseball during an at bat, typically after a home 
run. This is in contrast to the usual practice of gently dropping the bat 
as the batter begins running to first base.[citation needed] Bat flipping 
is popular in Asian and Latin American baseball leagues.[1] In South Korea, 
the bat flipping tradition dates back to the 1990s,[2] and has become increasingly 
frequent in the Korea Baseball Organization.[3][2] In the Korean language, 
bat flips are referred as ppa-dun (Korean: 빠던), a portmanteau of the "first 
syllables of the words for 'bat' and 'throw'".[3][2] The practice is also 
common in Japan and Taiwan,[3] and the respective professional leagues 
Nippon Professional Baseball and Chinese Professional Baseball League.[citation

rude and inconsistent with baseball etiquette.[3] Traditional etiquette 
and the unwritten rules of baseball espouse humility and discourage actions 
which may be interpreted as arrogant or showing up the opponents.[4] Torii 
Hunter, a retired Major League Baseball player and fan of bat flips in 
Korean baseball, has stated that a player throwing a bat in such a manner 
during a game in the United States would likely face retaliation in a subsequent 
at bat, such as being hit by a pitch.[3] In April 2015, Los Angeles Dodgers 
right fielder Yasiel Puig stated that he would flip his bat less frequently 
because he wanted "to show American baseball that I'm not disrespecting 
the game".[5] During the rubber match of the 2015 American League Division 
Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers at the Blue Jays' 
home stadium of the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Blue Jays right 
fielder José Bautista executed what Andrew Keh of The New York Times described 
as possibly "the most ostentatious bat flip in M.L.B. history" after hitting 
a go-ahead, three-run home run off Rangers relief pitcher Sam Dyson.[1] 
Bautista wrote an article about the bat flip published in November 2015 
in The Players' Tribune.[6] He said he "didn’t plan it. It just happened", 
and that he was "caught up in the emotion of the moment" when he flipped 
the bat.[6] Bautista was criticized for the bat flip, which he attributed 
to a failure to understand differences in cultural backgrounds of players.[7] 
Members of the Rangers objected to the bat flip, with Rangers starting 
pitcher Derek Holland stating he did not object to a home run celebration, 
"but the way he did it".[8] After the home run, Dyson approached Blue Jays 
designated hitter Edwin Encarnación, the next batter in the batting order, 
and "told him that Jose needs to calm that down, respect the game more".[9] 
During the post-game press conference, manager Jeff Banister stated that 
"we respect everybody", which the media interpreted as a strong suggestion 
of disapproval of Bautista's actions.[9] The Bautista bat flip became an 
internet meme.[7] Fans posted numerous responses to the event on Twitter, 
and shared videos on Vine and other social media websites and mobile apps.[1] 
It was etched onto Jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween,[10] printed on T-shirts 
and Christmas sweaters,[11][12] and was also the subject of a thigh tattoo 
for an Oshawa, Ontario man.[13][14] It was also commemorated on a Topps 
2016 Series 1 baseball card.[15] A corn field in the Canadian province 
of New Brunswick was designed with the likeness of the Bautista bat flip.[16] 
Bautista's bat flip is added to NHL 17, which is an official National Hockey 
League simulation video game, as a personal goal celebration, albeit with 
an ice hockey stick.[17] However, Bautista's bat flip may be the impetus 
of the Jays–Rangers brawl on May 15, 2016 in the Rangers' home stadium 
of Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas, in which Rangers relief pitcher 
Matt Bush intentionally threw a pitch at Bautista, Bautista made an illegal 
slide to second base, and Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor punched Bautista 
in the face, thereby igniting the brawl.[18] Bautista was suspended for
