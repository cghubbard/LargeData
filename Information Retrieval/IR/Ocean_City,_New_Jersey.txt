Ocean City is a city in Cape May County, New Jersey, United States. It 
is the county's largest city by area and is the principal city of the Ocean 
City Metropolitan Statistical Area which encompasses all of Cape May County. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the city's population was 11,701,[11] 
reflecting a decline of 3,677 (-23.9%) from the 15,378 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn declined by 134 (-0.9%) from the 15,512 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[21] In summer months, with an influx of tourists and 
second homeowners, there are estimated to be 115,000 to 130,000 within 
the city's borders.[22][23] Ocean City originated as a borough by an act 
of the New Jersey Legislature on May 3, 1884, from portions of Upper Township, 
based on results from a referendum on April 30, 1884, and was reincorporated 
as a borough on March 31, 1890. Ocean City was incorporated as a city, 
its current government form, on March 25, 1897.[24][25] The city is named 
for its location on the Atlantic Ocean.[26][27] Known as a family-oriented 
seaside resort, Ocean City has prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages 
within its limits since its founding in 1879,[28][29] offering miles of 
guarded beaches, a boardwalk that stretches for 2.5 miles (4.0 km), and 
a downtown shopping and dining district.[30] The Travel Channel rated Ocean 
City as the Best Family Beach of 2005.[31] It was ranked the third-best 
beach in New Jersey in the 2008 Top 10 Beaches Contest sponsored by the 
New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium.[32] In the 2009 Top 10 Beaches Contest, 
Ocean City ranked first.[33] From early June through Labor Day, Ocean City 
requires individuals age 12 and up to purchase a beach tag to access its 
beaches.[34] For the 2015 season, a one-day pass cost $5, a weekly pass 
was $10, and a seasonal pass for the full summer season was $25 (though, 
if purchased before June 1, seasonal tags were $20.)[35] The island, a 
stretch of dunes and swamps running for seven miles, had been used by local 
Native Americans who were brought there by its abundance of fish during 
the summer months. Originally purchased by the Somers family, the island 
had once been named Peck's Beach, believed to have been given the name 
for a whaler named John Peck who had a camp on the island.[36] In 1700, 
whaler John Peck began using the barrier island as a storage place for 
freshly caught whales. Eventually known as Peck's Beach, the island had 
several purposes: it was an Indian summer fishing camp, cattle-grazing 
area, and sometimes mainlanders would boat over for a picnic or to hunt.[37] 
On September 10, 1879, four Methodist ministers, Ezra B. Lake, James Lake, 
S. Wesley Lake, and William Burrell, chose the island as a suitable spot 
to establish a Christian retreat and camp meeting on the order of Ocean 
Grove.[38] They met under a tall cedar tree, which stands today in the 
lobby of the Ocean City Tabernacle. Having chosen the name "Ocean City", 
the founders incorporated the Ocean City Association, laid out street and 
lots for cottages, hotel and businesses. The Ocean City Tabernacle was 
built between Wesley and Asbury Avenues and between 5th and 6th Streets. 
Camp meetings were held by the following summer. As a result of its religious 
origins, the sale or public drinking of alcoholic beverages in Ocean City 
was prohibited.[39] The first bridge to the island was built in 1883, and 
the first railroad soon followed. The first school began in 1881. The boardwalk 
grew and was relocated several times. The ship Sindia joined other shipwrecks 
on the beach on December 15, 1901, on its way to New York City from Kobe, 
Japan, but has since sunk below the sand. A salvage attempt to retrieve 
treasures believed to have been on the ship was most recently launched 
in the 1970s, all of which have been unsuccessful.[40] A large fire in 
1927 changed the city significantly, causing $1.5 million in damage and 
leading the city to move the boardwalk closer to the ocean, which resulted 
in the greater potential for damage from saltwater.[41] The Ocean City 
boardwalk is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the resort. It is 
also one of the most well-known boardwalks in the world.[citation needed] 
It is 2.5-mile (4.0 km) long and runs north from 23rd Street to St. James 
Place, with mile markers for people who are exercising.[42] The boardwalk 
was first built in 1880 from the Second Street wharf to Fourth Street and 
West Avenue. In 1885, plans to extend the boardwalk along the entire beach 
were made as the city's first amusement house, a pavilion on the beach 
at 11th street called "The Excursion" opened. A second amusement park, 
the "I.G. Adams pavilion", at Ninth Street and the boardwalk, opened soon 
after but was destroyed by fire in 1893. Following a second catastrophic 
fire in 1927, the boardwalk and its businesses were rebuilt 300 feet (91 m) 
closer to the ocean on concrete pilings, with parking created for cars 
in the space where the buildings and boardwalk once stood.[43] The Ocean 
City Music Pier partially opened one year later, with work completed in 
time for the 1929 season.[44] In 1965, the Wonderland Amusement Park opened 
on the boardwalk at 6th Street, which is now known as "Gillian's Wonderland 
Pier". Runaway Train, a steel twister, is the only major coaster that operates 
there.[45] Playland's Castaway Cove, is located on the boardwalk at 10th 
Street. Two major roller coasters operated there, which were the Python, 
a looping coaster, and the Flitzer, a wild mouse coaster. A new major shuttle 
coaster at Castaway Cove, Storm, was planned to be finished in summer 2013.[46] 
The two older coasters (Python and Flitzer) were removed and for the 2016 
summer season, a new ride called "GaleForce" is under construction, which 
will be a high thrill roller coaster with three linear synchronous motor 
launches reaching speeds of 64 miles per hour (103 km/h) and a 125-foot 
(38 m) beyond vertical drop. The new "Wild Waves" ride will be a family-oriented 
coaster, with a height of 50 feet (15 m), that will wrap around the GaleForce 
coaster. The new "Whirlwind" ride is a figure eight kiddie coaster with 
spinning cars.[47] There is also a water park located on the boardwalk 
called "OC Waterpark", open during the summer months.[48] In 2007 controversy 
emerged about the city's proposed use of ipê, a type of wood, to re-deck 
parts of the boardwalk. Environmental activists protested against the city's 
use of the wood, but the plan went ahead.[49] Today, there are bike and 
surrey rentals available along many boardwalk cross streets, but bikes 
and surreys can only be ridden on the boardwalk before noon during the 
summer. Attractions along the boardwalk include two family amusement parks 
with rides and games, an arcade, the Music Pier, a water park and various 
themed miniature golf courses. The Ocean City boardwalk has a wide variety 
of dining options, from sit-down restaurants to funnel cake. According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 10.797 
square miles (27.964 km2), including 6.333 square miles (16.402 km2) of 
land and 4.464 square miles (11.562 km2) of water (41.35%).[2][3] Unincorporated 
communities, localities and place names located partially or completely 
within the city include Peck Beach.[50] Ocean City is a barrier island 
with bridge connections to the Marmora section of Upper Township by the 
34th Street (Roosevelt Boulevard) Bridge, Egg Harbor Township by the Ocean 
City-Longport Bridge, Somers Point by the 9th Street Bridge (Route 52), 
and the Strathmere section of Upper Township by the Corson's Inlet Bridge.

The City of Ocean City was incorporated on March 25, 1897. Since July 1, 
1978, the city has operated within the Faulkner Act, formally known as 
the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council system of municipal 
government. The mayor, the chief executive of the community, is chosen 
at-large for a four-year term at the municipal election in May and serves 
part-time for a yearly salary. The mayor neither presides over, nor has 
a vote on the council. The mayor has veto power over ordinances, but any 
veto can be overridden by a vote of two-thirds of the Council. The City 
council is the legislative body and has seven members. Four members represent 
individual wards and three are elected at-large. Each council person serves 
a staggered four-year term. The three at-large seat and the mayoral seat 
are up for election together, followed by the four ward seats which are 
voted upon two years later.[9] As of 2016[update], the mayor of Ocean City

In September 2015, Councilman Michael Allegretto resigned from his seat 
expiring in December 2018 to take a position as the city's Director of 
Community Services. As the council could not reach agreement on a successor 
in the month following the resignation, the position will remain vacant 
until a successor is chosen in the May 2016 municipal election to serve 
the balance of the term of office.[67] Ocean City is located in the 2nd
