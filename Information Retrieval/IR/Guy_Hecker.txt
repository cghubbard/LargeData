Guy Jackson Hecker (April 3, 1856 in Youngsville, Pennsylvania – December 
3, 1938) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball. He was born 
in Youngsville, Pennsylvania. His debut game took place on May 2, 1882. 
His final game took place on September 30, 1890. During his career he played 
for the Louisville Eclipse and Pittsburgh Pirates. Hecker is considered 
by some baseball historians to be the best combination pitcher and hitter 
to play in the 19th century. He remains as one of the only two pitchers 
in Major League history to hit three home runs in one game, alongside Jim 
Tobin and the only pitcher to win a batting title. In addition, he is the 
only pitcher in baseball history to get six hits in a nine-inning game. 
Hecker was the second pitcher ever in the American Association to pitch 
a no hitter. He did this as a rookie on September 19, 1882. He narrowly 
missed becoming the first pitcher in AA by a week when his teammate Tony 
Mullane threw one. He also set a WHIP record of 0.77, which remained the 
MLB record until 2000, when it was broken by Pedro Martínez' mark of 0.74, 
yet Hecker's mark remains the baseball rookie record. In 1884, Hecker won 
the pitching version of the triple crown by compiling 52 wins, 385 strikeouts 
and a 1.85 ERA. In 1886, Hecker won the batting title by hitting .341 for 
the season. Hecker finished his career in 1890 by managing and playing 
for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. Hecker died in Wooster, Ohio, and was laid
