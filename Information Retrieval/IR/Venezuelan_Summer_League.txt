The Venezuelan Summer League (VSL) was a Minor League Baseball rookie-level 
circuit which operated in the Major League Baseball's academies in the 
Venezuelan state of Carabobo. The VSL was created in 1997 as an alternative 
to the Dominican Summer League to improve the development of young prospects 
from Venezuela in their early years in organized baseball. Besides Carabobo, 
the states of Aragua, Lara and Yaracuy were represented in the league. 
Political instability in the region led to all the MLB teams pulling their 
affiliates out of the country and the league shutting down before the 2016 
season.[1][2] The regular season champion and the league runner-up played 
a best-of-three-games playoff series for the league championship. The league 
was closed to all MLB Draft eligible players, e.g., players from the United 
States, Canada and Puerto Rico, with the exception of two players from 
Puerto Rico. Over the years there have been players from Argentina, Colombia, 
Cura√ßao, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Sint 
Maarten and Venezuela. Each team had a roster limit of 35 active players, 
at least 10 of which had to be pitchers. No player on the active list could 
have more than four years of minor league service. There were no age limits.
