Ronald "Ronnie" Belliard (born April 7, 1975 in The Bronx, New York) is 
a former American Major League Baseball second baseman. Belliard is born 
to Dominican parents. Belliard attended Central High School in Miami, Florida. 
He is a distant cousin of former major league shortstop Rafael Belliard. 
Belliard was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 8th round of the 1994 
Major League Baseball draft. Belliard played in the Brewers farm system 
from 1994–1999, winning Texas League All-Star honors in 1996 and in 1998 
he was honored as a Triple-A All-Star, International League All-Star, Baseball 
America 1st Team Minor League All-Star and Brewers Minor League Player 
of the Year. He made his Major League debut on September 12, 1998 as a 
pinch runner against the Chicago Cubs and he got his first Major League 
hit in his first at-bat, as a pinch hitter, on September 16 against the 
Cincinnati Reds. In 1999, Belliard was named Milwaukee Brewers rookie player 
of the year. After he began the season at Triple A Louisville, he was recalled 
on May 11. He finished the season tops among National League rookies in 
almost every offensive category, including batting average (1st), runs 
batted in (6th), multi-hit games (4th), runs (6th), hits (4th), total bases 
(5th), doubles (2nd), triples (T-3rd), hitting streaks (T-5th), walks (1st), 
on-base percentage (1st), slugging percentage (3rd) and extra base hits 
(4th). Ronnie hit his first Major league home run and drove in his first 
run with a solo shot May 15. In 2000, Belliard established career highs 
in several categories, including games (152), runs scored (83), hits (150) 
and doubles (30) while setting the Brewers' National League franchise record 
with career-high 9 triples. 2001 saw Belliard set a career mark with 11 
home runs and equaled a career-high with 30 doubles previously set in 2000. 
Ronnie was Milwaukee's Opening Day second baseman. In 2002, Belliard played 
second base (49 games) and third base (42 games) for Milwaukee. On January 
17, 2003, Belliard was signed as a minor league free agent by the Colorado 
Rockies after being non-tendered by Milwaukee on December 20 and became 
the first non-roster invitee in franchise history to start on Opening Day. 
Belliard signed a one-year deal with the Cleveland Indians for the 2004 
campaign. In 2004 Belliard enjoyed a fine season from an offensive standpoint, 
stabilizing the second base position after the club experienced inconsistency 
at the position in 2003. Ronnie amassed career-highs in hits (169), doubles 
(48) and RBI (70) and also set a new career-high with 12 HR. He finished 
2nd in the American League with 48 doubles, which represented the highest 
total by an Indian since Albert Belle's 52 in 1995. His .282 batting average 
at second base led all AL second basemen. His 169 hits ranked 2nd and his 
69 RBI placed 4th among league 2B. Belliard earned his first trip to the 
All-Star Game after hitting .304 (103-339) in the first half with 5 home-runs 
and 37 RBI in 84 games (was voted in by players). He avoided arbitration 
and signed a 1-year contract on December 20 with a club option for 2006. 
In 2005, Belliard collected new career-highs in homers (17) and RBI (78) 
as he finished 3rd among AL second basemen in RBI and doubles (36) and 
4th in home runs. On Sunday, July 30 2006, Belliard was traded to the St. 
Louis Cardinals for utility infielder Héctor Luna in a move designed to 
acquire for St. Louis an every-day second baseman for the stretch run, 
and to provide bench bat strength for Cleveland. Belliard was a key part 
of the Cardinals' success in the 2006 National League Division Series when 
he hit .462 with two RBI and two runs scored. The Cardinals defeated the 
San Diego Padres three games to one to advance to the National League Championship 
Series. Belliard eventually won his first World Series ring when the Cardinals 
won the 2006 World Series, defeating the Detroit Tigers, four games to 
one. At the end of the season, however, Belliard was not re-signed, and 
became a free agent. Belliard signed a minor league contract with the Washington 
Nationals on February 18, 2007. He was added to the Nationals' 40-man roster 
on March 22, 2007. Following an Opening Day injury to shortstop Cristian 
Guzmán, second baseman Felipe López was moved to shortstop, while Belliard 
filled in at second base. Guzmán came back in early May, but at the end 
of June suffered a season-ending injury putting Belliard back into the 
starting line-up. By July 23 Belliard had appeared in 85 of the Nationals 
98 games, batting .305, and signed a two-year $3.5 million extension with 
the Nationals. He was viewed as a valuable veteran, capable of starting 
or as a utility infielder. Belliard hit a game-ending 2-run home run shot 
off of closer George Sherrill with 2 outs and 2 strikes in 12th inning, 
erasing a 2-1 deficit on June 29, 2008 against the Baltimore Orioles. On 
August 22, 2008, Belliard was a triple away from the cycle as he singled, 
doubled twice, and homered in a Nationals 13 to 5 victory over the Chicago 
Cubs at Wrigley Field. At the end of the 2008 Belliard set career highs 
with .473 slugging and .372 on-base percentages despite missing nearly 
2 months with injuries. He hit 11 home runs in 96 games (296 at bats) making 
his ratio of 26.9 at bats-per-home run. This ranked second among Nationals 
behind Elijah Dukes. On August 30, 2009, Belliard was traded to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers for minor leaguer Luis Garcia.[1] Belliard said this about 
the trade: In his first at-bat as a Dodger, Belliard hit a home run against 
Doug Davis of the Arizona Diamondbacks.[3] In 24 games with the Dodgers, 
he hit .351 with 5 home runs and took over the starting second baseman 
job from Orlando Hudson for the post-season. On January 26, 2010, the Dodgers 
re-signed Belliard to a 1-year $850,000 contract. He played in 82 games 
as a part-time player for the Dodgers in 2010, hitting .216. He was designated 
for assignment on September 7, 2010 and then released on September 9. On 
February 4, 2011, Belliard agreed to a minor league contract with an invitation 
to spring training with the New York Yankees worth $825,000.[4] He was 
released on March 28.[5] On March 30, 2011 Belliard agreed to a minor league 
contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] He played in 53 games for the 
AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs, hitting .251. On June 14, 2011 Belliard announced 
his retirement [7] During the offseason, he used to play with the Tigres 
del Licey in the Dominican Winter League, where he was the captain of the 
team. Federal authorities in St. Louis said a man, George Edwards, tried 
to get an athlete (not releasing his name, though Belliard's agent later 
confirmed it was the second baseman) to pay $150,000 to keep quiet about 
a sexual encounter with Edwards' daughter, Laura L. Edwards, which allegedly 
resulted in a pregnancy.[8] Federal prosecutors only described the athlete 
in court as "the victim." Court papers referred only to a "John Doe" in 
accusing George Edwards, 48, of extortion for allegedly seeking money for 
silence about the player supposedly impregnating Edwards' daughter.[9] 
Belliard's agent, Dominic Torres, confirmed that Belliard was the player 
at the center of the extortion case and provided this statement: An affidavit 
by FBI Special Agent Dustin Sorrells said this about the case: The friend 
offered several thousand dollars. Later in November, a sports agent worked 
out a deal to pay $25,000 for a paternity test, and $125,000 more if the 
child was the athlete's. George Edwards and a different sports agent met 
Jan. 5 at a hotel near Lambert Field, where the agent gave George Edwards 
$25,000 cash. George Edwards admitted to hatching the scheme in court documents[11] 
and was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry to one year and 
one day in prison. It was less than the recommended range of 21 to 27 months, 
based on Edwards' past criminal convictions. Perry said she considered
