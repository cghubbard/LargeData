As player As manager Shigeru Sugishita (杉下 茂, born September 17, 1925, 
Tokyo Prefecture) is a former Japanese professional baseball pitcher and 
coach.[1] Renowned for his forkball, Sugishita dominated the Central League 
from 1950–1955,[2] winning more than 30 games twice (winning at least 23 
games each season), and garnering three Eiji Sawamura Awards. Sugishita 
usually split his time between starting games and pitching in relief. He 
played 11 seasons, ten of them for the Chunichi/Nagoya Dragons.[1] Born 
in Tokyo Prefecture, Sugishita attended Teikyo Shogyo High School and Meiji 
University.[2] In 1950, Sugishita led the Central League in strikeouts 
and innings pitched. In 1951, he went 28-13 with a 2.36 ERA, leading the 
Central League in victories and winning his first Eiji Sawamura Award. 
1952 was another stellar campaign for Sugishita, as he went 32-14 with 
a 2.33 ERA, pitching in 61 games and throwing 355-2/3 innings. That year 
he again won the Sawamura Award. In 1954, Sugishita won his third Sawamura 
Award, going 32-12 with a 1.39 ERA. He pitched 395-1/3 innings, had 27 
complete games, 7 shutouts, and 273 strikeouts, and was named Most Valuable 
Player of the Central League. Capping off the season, he was the MVP of 
1954 Japan Series, pitching in four of the seven games and winning three 
of them, including the game-seven clincher. He is one of only three players 
in NPB history to win the Sawamura Award, the MVP award, and the Japan 
Series MVP in the same season. Despite only being 32 years old, Sugishita 
retired from playing after the 1958 season and became the Dragons' manager. 
After guiding the team for two seasons, Sugishita was let go after the 
1960 season, when the Dragons finished in fifth place. In 1961, Sugishita 
returned to playing, pitching mostly in relief for the Daimai Orions. He 
went 4-6 with a respectable 2.44 ERA. Sugishita went back to managing, 
leading the Hanshin Tigers in 1966, and returning to Chunichi in 1968. 
His teams did not perform well, and Sugishita moved on to announcing baseball 
on television. Shigeru Sugishita was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall
