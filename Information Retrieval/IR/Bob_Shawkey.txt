As player As manager James Robert Shawkey (December 4, 1890 – December 
31, 1980) was an American baseball pitcher who played fifteen seasons in 
Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Philadelphia Athletics and 
New York Yankees from 1915 to 1927. He batted and threw right-handed and 
served primarily as a starting pitcher. Shawkey born to John William Shawkey 
and Sarah Catherine Anthony, in Sigel, Pennsylvania. He moved from Slippery 
Rock State College to an independent league in 1911, then to the American 
League in 1912 as a pitcher for Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics. In 
1915, Mack sold him to the New York Yankees where he remained (except for 
a brief service with the U.S. Navy during World War I when he served on 
the battleship Arkansas for eight months) until 1931. While facing his 
former team in 1919, he struck out 15 As batters in a game, setting the 
Yankees team record for most strikeouts in a game; this record lasted for 
fifty-nine years.[1] At the start of the 1923 season, Shawkey was chosen 
to be the Yankees' Opening Day starting pitcher.[2] Because the team's 
first game was at home, this also meant that he was the first player to 
pitch at the newly built Yankee Stadium.[1] The Yankees won 4–1 behind 
Babe Ruth's three-run home run, with Shawkey pitching a complete game to 
become the first winning pitcher at the stadium.[3] Shawkey also served 
as the Yankees' manager in the 1930 season—following the sudden death of 
Miller Huggins—and guided the Yankees to a third-place finish.[1] Shawkey 
won 207 games in his career, and won 20 or more games in five different 
seasons (his high was 26). Shawkey is noted as the starting pitcher in 
the first game played in Yankee Stadium on April 18, 1923, and set the 
franchise record for 15 strikeouts in a single game, which stood until 
Whitey Ford broke it in the early 1960s. Bob credited his success to a 
super fastball and an outstanding curve ball. He later served as the baseball 
coach for Dartmouth College. In 1970, Shawkey was inducted into the Pennsylvania 
Sports Hall of Fame in Brookville, Pennsylvania. During the 1976 opening 
day festivities for the renovated Yankee Stadium, Shawkey threw out the 
ceremonial first pitch. He died at age 90 in Syracuse, New York on New
