The question of the origins of baseball has been the subject of debate 
and controversy for more than a century. Baseball and the other modern 
bat, ball and running games, cricket and rounders, were developed from 
folk games in England. Early forms of baseball had a number of names, including 
"base ball", "goal ball", "round ball", "fletch-catch", "stool ball", and, 
simply, "base". In at least one version of the game, teams pitched to themselves, 
runners went around the bases in the opposite direction of today's game, 
and players could be put out by being hit with the ball. Just as now, in 
some versions a batter was called out after three strikes. A number of 
early folk games in England had characteristics that can be seen in modern 
baseball (as well as in cricket and rounders). Many of these early games 
involved a ball that was thrown at a target while an opposing player defended 
the target by attempting to hit the ball away. If the batter successfully 
hit the ball, he could attempt to score points by running between bases 
while fielders would attempt to catch or retrieve the ball and put the 
runner out in some way. Since they were folk games, the early games had 
no official, documented rules, and they tended to change over time. To 
the extent that there were rules, they were generally simple and were not 
written down. There were many local variations, and varied names. Many 
of the early games were not well documented, first, because they were generally 
peasant games (and perhaps children's games, as well); and second, because 
they were often discouraged, and sometimes even prohibited, either by the 
church or by the state, or both. Aside from obvious differences in terminology, 
the games differed in the equipment used (ball, bat, club, target, etc., 
which were usually just whatever was available), the way in which the ball 
is thrown, the method of scoring, the method of making outs, the layout 
of the field and the number of players involved. In an 1801 book entitled 
The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, Joseph Strutt claimed 
to have shown that baseball-like games can be traced back to the 14th century, 
in particular an English game called stoolball. The earliest known reference 
to stoolball is in a 1330 poem by William Pagula, who recommended to priests 
that the game be forbidden within churchyards. In stoolball, one player 
throws the ball at a target while another player defends the target. Originally, 
the target was defended with a bare hand. Later, a bat of some kind was 
used (in modern stoolball, a bat like a very heavy table tennis paddle 
is used). "Stob-ball" and "stow-ball" were regional games similar to stoolball. 
What the target originally was in stoolball is not certain; it was possibly 
a tree stump, since "stob" and "stow" all mean stump in some local dialects. 
("Stow" could also refer to a type of frame used in mining). It is notable 
that in cricket to this day, the uprights of the wicket are called "stumps". 
Of course, the target could well have been whatever was convenient, perhaps 
even a gravestone (hence Pagula's objection to churchyard play). A 17th-century 
book on games specifies a stool. According to one legend, milkmaids played 
stoolball while waiting for their husbands to return from the fields. Another 
theory is that stoolball developed as a game played after attending church 
services, in which case the target was probably a church stool. An 18th-century 
poem depicts men and women playing together (the women using their aprons 
to catch batted balls), and it and other references associate the game 
especially with the Easter season. There were several versions of stoolball. 
In the earliest versions, the object was primarily to defend the stool. 
Successfully defending the stool counted for one point, and the batter 
was out if the ball hit the stool. There was no running involved. Another 
version of stoolball involved running between two stools, and scoring was 
similar to the scoring in cricket. In perhaps yet another version there 
were several stools, and points were scored by running around them as in 
baseball. When Englishmen came to America, they brought stoolball with 
them. William Bradford in his diary for Christmas Day, 1621, noted (with 
disapproval) how the men of Plymouth were "frolicking in þe street, at 
play openly; some pitching þe barre, some at stoole-ball and shuch-like 
sport".[1] Because of the different versions of stoolball, and because 
it was played not only in England, but also in colonial America, stoolball 
is considered by many to have been the basis of not only cricket, but both 
baseball and rounders as well. Another early folk game was "dog and cat" 
(or "cat and dog"), which probably originated in Scotland. In cat and dog 
a piece of wood called a cat is thrown at a hole in the ground while another 
player defends the hole with a stick (a dog). In some cases there were 
two holes and, after hitting the cat, the batter would run between them 
while fielders would try to put the runner out by putting the cat in the 
hole before the runner got to it. Dog and cat thus resembled cricket. This 
game, otherwise unknown, was described in an unpublished 17th-century monograph 
on games by Francis Willoughby, which included rules for over 130 pastimes 
including stool-ball and stow-ball.[2] It is significant in that it involved 
both a bat and base-running, although it was played with a wooden cat rather 
than a ball and the multiple "bases" were holes in the ground: the batter 
reached safety by putting the end of his bat in a hole before the fielders 
could put the cat in it. This has echoes both in cricket's manner of scoring 
runs by touching the bat to the ground, and in rounders and town-ball's 
use of wooden posts in holes in the ground as bases.[3] In Trap ball, played 
in England since the 14th century, a ball was thrown in the air, to be 
hit by a batsman and fielded. In some variants a member of the fielding 
team threw the ball in the air; in some, the batter tossed it himself as 
in fungo; in others, the batsman caused the ball to be tossed in the air 
by a simple lever mechanism: versions of this, called Bat and trap and 
Knurr and spell, are still played in some English pubs. In trap-ball there 
was no running, instead the fielders attempted to throw the ball back to 
within a certain distance of the batter's station. Trap-ball may be the 
origin of the concept of foul lines; in most variants the ball had to be 
hit between two posts to count. A related game was Tip-cat; in this, the 
"cat" was an oblong piece of wood (as in dog-and-cat); it tapered toward 
each end, rather like a football, so that striking one end would flip it 
into the air much like the trap in trap-ball so that it could be struck 
with a stick or bat. An old English game called "base" or "prisoners' base", 
described by George Ewing at Valley Forge, was apparently not much like 
baseball. There was no bat and no ball involved. The game was more like 
a fancy game of team "tag", although it did share the concept of places 
of safety, bases, with baseball. The history of cricket prior to 1650 is 
something of a mystery. Games believed to have been similar to cricket 
had developed by the 13th century. There was a game called "creag", and 
another game, "Handyn and Handoute" (Hands In and Hands Out), which was 
made illegal in 1477 by King Edward IV, who considered the game childish, 
and a distraction from compulsory archery practice. References to a game 
actually called "cricket" appeared around 1550. It is believed that the 
word cricket is based either on the word cric, meaning a crooked stick 
possibly a shepherd's crook (early forms of cricket used a curved bat somewhat 
like a hockey stick), or on a Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik 
ket)sen ("with the stick chase").[4] , or on the Flemish word "krickstoel", 
which refers to a stool upon which one kneels in church and which the early 
long, low wicket resembled. While cricket obviously is a relative of baseball 
in that it involves throwing, batting and running bases, it had developed 
its own separate identity well before baseball and its closer relatives 
appeared, and cannot have been a direct ancestor. The earliest known mention 
of baseball, as a children's game, dates from the same year (1744) in which 
the Artillery Ground Laws formalised the rules of what was already a first-class, 
professional sport sponsored by nobility and upon which vast wagers were 
laid. English colonists played cricket along with their other games from 
home, and it is mentioned many times in 18th-century American sources. 
As an organized sport, the Toronto Cricket Club was established in that 
city by 1827 and the St George's Cricket Club was formed in 1838 in New 
York City. Teams from the two clubs faced off in the first international 
cricket game in 1844 which Toronto won by 23 runs.[5] Many of the early 
New York club baseball players were also cricketers, and the earliest recorded 
inter-club baseball game was played on the Union Star Cricket Grounds in 
Brooklyn. The British game most similar to baseball, and most mentioned 
as its ancestor or nearest relation, is rounders. Like baseball, the object 
is to strike a pitched ball with a baton or paddle and then run a circuit 
of four bases. While the game in many respects is quite different from 
modern baseball, it preserves a number of features which were characteristic 
of "town ball", the earlier form of American baseball. However, the assertion 
that rounders is the direct ancestor of baseball is more problematical, 
for chronological reasons: the earliest mention of the game, by that name 
at least, dates only to 1828, almost a century after the earliest mentions 
of "base ball" and well after "base ball" was being played in America. 
Although many sources claim that rounders is an "ancient" game or dates 
"from Tudor times", there is no evidence for the assertion.[6] It is possible 
that "base ball" and "rounders" were simply local names for essentially 
the same game, along with "poison ball", "goal ball", "squares", "feeder" 
etc. A unique British sport, known as British Baseball, is still played 
in parts of Wales and England. Although confined mainly to the cities of 
Cardiff, Newport and Liverpool, the sport boasts an annual international 
game between representative teams from the two countries. British "baseball", 
however, is much more akin to rounders, as it was in fact called until 
1892, and represents a rounders variant somewhat hybridized under the influence 
of 19th-century American touring teams. According to many sources, the 
earliest appearance of the word "baseball" dates from 1700, when Anglican 
bishop Thomas Wilson expressed his disapproval of "Morris-dancing, cudgel-playing, 
baseball and cricket" occurring on Sundays. However, David Block, in Baseball 
Before We Knew It (2005), reports that the original source has "stoolball" 
for "baseball". Block also reports the reference appears to date to 1672, 
rather than 1700.[7] A 1744 book in England by children's publisher John 
Newbery called A Little Pretty Pocket-Book includes a woodcut of a game 
similar to 3-base stoolball or rounders and a rhyme entitled "Base-Ball". 
This is the first known instance of the word baseball in print.[8] In 1755, 
a book entitled "The Card" by John Kidgell, in Volume 1 on page 9, mentions 
baseball: "the younger Part of the Family, perceiving Papa not inclined 
to enlarge upon the matter, retired to an interrupted Party at Base-Ball 
(an infant Game, which as it advances in its teens, improved into Fives[9])." 
Although A Little Pretty Pocket-Book first appeared eleven years earlier, 
no copies of the first or other early editions have surfaced to date, only 
the 10th and later editions from 1760 forward. Therefore, "The Card" was 
the oldest surviving reference to baseball until the Bray diary was discovered 
in 2008. The earliest recorded game of base-ball involved none other than 
the family of the Prince of Wales, played indoors in London in November 
1748. The Prince is reported as playing "Bass-Ball" again in September 
1749 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, against Lord Middlesex.[10] The English 
lawyer William Bray wrote in his diary that he had played a game of baseball 
on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, also in Surrey.[11][12] The word "baseball" 
first appeared in a dictionary in 1768, in A General Dictionary of the 
English Language compiled by the editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica 
(first published the same year), with the unhelpful definition "A rural 
game in which the person striking the ball must run to his base or goal."[13] 
By 1796, the rules of this English game were well enough established to 
earn a mention in the German Johann Gutsmuths' book on popular pastimes. 
In it he described "Ball mit Freystäten (oder das englische Base-ball)" 
(Ball with free stations, or the English baseball) as a contest between 
two teams in which "the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while 
at the home plate"; only one out was required to retire a side. Gutsmuth 
included a diagram of the field which was very similar to that of town 
ball.[14][15] The French book Les Jeux des Jeunes Garçons is the second 
known book to contain printed rules of a bat/base/running game. It was 
printed in Paris in 1810 and lays out the rules for La balle empoisonnée 
("poisoned ball"), in which there were two teams of eight to ten players, 
four bases (one called home), a pitcher, a batter, and flyball outs; however, 
the ball apparently was struck by the hand. Another early print reference 
is Jane Austen's novel Northanger Abbey, originally written 1798-1799. 
In the first chapter the young English heroine Catherine Morland is described 
as preferring "cricket, base ball, riding on horseback and running about 
the country to books".[16] About the same time, Austen's cousin Cassandra 
Cooke mentioned baseball in her novel Battleridge. In her 1820s "Village 
Sketch" Jack Hatch, author Mary Russell Mitford wrote: "Then comes a sun-burnt 
gipsy of six, beginning to grow tall and thin and to find the cares of 
the world gathering about her; with a pitcher in one hand, a mop in the 
other, an old straw bonnet of ambiguous shape, half hiding her tangled 
hair; a tattered stuff petticoat once green, hanging below an equally tattered 
cotton frock, once purple; her longing eyes fixed on a game of baseball 
at the corner of the green till she reaches the cottage door, flings down 
the mop and pitcher and darts off to her companions quite regardless of 
the storm of scolding with which the mother follows her runaway steps."[17] 
In 1828, William Clarke of London published the second edition of The Boy’s 
Own Book, which included rules for rounders (the oldest known use of that 
name), and contains the first printed description in English of a bat and 
ball base-running game played on a diamond.[18] The following year, the 
book was published in Boston, Massachusetts.[19] Similar rules were published 
in Boston in The Book of Sports, written by Robin Carver in 1834,[16] except 
Carver called the game "'Base' or 'Goal ball'". Charting the evolution 
of the game that became modern baseball is difficult before 1845. The Knickerbocker 
Rules describe a game that they had been playing for some time. But how 
long is uncertain and so is how that game had developed. Shane Foster was 
the first to come up with suspicions of how the origin came into effect. 
There were once two camps. One, mostly English, asserted that baseball 
evolved from a game of English origin (probably rounders); the other, almost 
entirely American, said that baseball was an American invention (perhaps 
derived from the game of one-ol'-cat). Apparently they saw their positions 
as mutually exclusive. Some of their points seem more national loyalty 
than evidence: Americans tended to reject any suggestion that baseball 
evolved from an English game, while some English observers concluded that 
baseball was little more than their rounders without the round. One English 
author went so far as to declare that the Knickerbocker Club comprised 
English expatriates who introduced "their" game to America for the first 
time in 1845. The Mills Commission, at the other extreme, created an "official" 
and entirely fictional All-American version attributing the game's invention 
to Abner Doubleday in 1839 at Cooperstown, New York. Both were entirely 
wrong, since this much is clear: baseball, or a game called "base ball", 
had been played in America for many years by then. The earliest explicit 
reference to the game in America is from March 1786 in the diary of a student 
at Princeton, John Rhea Smith: "A fine day, play baste ball in the campus 
but am beaten for I miss both catching and striking the ball."[1] There 
is a possible reference a generation older, from Harvard; describing the 
campus buttery in the 1760s, Sidney Willard wrote "Besides eatables, everything 
necessary for a student was there sold, and articles used in the playgrounds, 
such as bats, balls etc. ... Here it was that we wrestled and ran, played 
at quoits and cricket, and various games of bat and ball."[1] A 1791 bylaw 
in Pittsfield, Massachusetts banned the playing of "any game of wicket, 
cricket, baseball, batball, football, cats, fives, or any other game played 
with ball" within 80 yards of the town meeting house to prevent damage 
to its windows.[20][21] Worcester, Massachusetts outlawed playing baseball 
"in the streets" in 1816. The first recorded game of modern North American 
baseball was played in Beachville, Ontario in 1838.[22] A firsthand account 
and the rules of the game were recalled by Dr. Adam E. Ford, who had witnessed 
the game as a six-year-old boy, in an 1886 issue of 'The Sporting Life' 
magazine in Denver, Colorado; he described the game in remarkable detail, 
including the precise distances between the irregular bases and how the 
ball was constructed. In that letter, Ford refers to 'old grayhairs' at 
the time, who had played this game as children, suggesting that the origins 
of baseball in Canada go back into the 18th century. Very similar instances 
were recorded by John Montgomery Ward in his 1888 book Base-Ball: How to 
Become a Player, with the Origins, History and Explanation of the Game, 
in which he recounts several elderly men recalling having played as boys, 
covering a span from the 1790s to the 1830s; among others, Oliver Wendell 
Holmes recalled playing at Harvard, from which he graduated in 1829. That 
baseball is based on English and Irish games such as cat, cricket, and 
rounders is difficult to dispute. On the other hand, baseball has many 
elements that are uniquely American. The earliest published author to muse 
on the origin of baseball, John Montgomery Ward, was suspicious of the 
often-parroted claim that rounders is the direct ancestor of baseball, 
as both were formalized in the same time period. He concluded, with some 
amount of patriotism, that baseball evolved separately from town-ball (i.e. 
rounders), out of children's "safe haven" ball games.[23] Certainly baseball 
is related to cricket and rounders, but exactly how, or how closely, has 
not been established. The only certain thing is that modern cricket is 
much older than modern baseball, and that cricket was very popular in colonial 
America and the early United States, fading only with the explosive popularity 
of New York baseball after the Civil War. There was also "wicket", a countrified 
form of cricket which retained the old-fashioned wide, low two-stump wicket, 
and in which the ball was rolled along the ground. Baseball also owes to 
cricket some adopted terminology, such as "outs", "innings", "runs" and 
"umpires". Games played with bat-and-ball together may all be distant cousins; 
the same goes for base-and-ball games. Bat, base, and ball games for two 
teams that alternate in and out, such as baseball, cricket, and rounders, 
are likely to be close cousins. They all involve throwing a ball to a batsman 
who attempts to "bat" it away and run safely to a base, while the opponent 
tries to put the batter-runner out when liable ("liable [to be put out]" 
is the baseball term for unsafe). The game of "cat" (or "cat-ball") had 
many variations but usually there was a pitcher, a catcher, a batter and 
fielders, but there were no sides (and often no bases to run). Often, as 
in English tip-cat, there was no pitcher and the "cat" was not a ball but 
an oblong wooden object, roughly football-shaped, which could be flipped 
into the air by striking one end, or simply a short stick which could be 
placed over a hole or stone and similarly flipped up. In other variants 
the batter himself tossed the ball into the air with his free hand, as 
in fungo. A feature of some versions of cat that would later become a feature 
of baseball was that a batter would be out if he swung and missed three 
times. Another game that was popular in early America was "one ol' cat", 
the name of which was possibly originally a contraction of one hole catapult.[24] 
In one ol' cat, when a batter is put out, the catcher goes to bat, the 
pitcher catches, a fielder becomes the pitcher, and other fielders move 
up in rotation. One ol' cat was often played when there weren't enough 
players to choose up sides and play townball. Sometimes running to a base 
and back was involved. "Two ol' cat" was the same game as one ol' cat, 
except that there were two batters; a diagram preserved in the New York 
Public Library is labeled "Four Old Cat" and depicts a square field like 
a baseball diamond and four batters, one at each corner. There are numerous 
18th and early 19th-century references in England and especially America 
to "bat and ball". Unfortunately we know nothing about the game besides 
the name, nor whether it was an alternate term for baseball or something 
else such as trap-ball, cat or even cricket. It might merely be a generic 
phrase for any game played with bat and ball. Baseball, as it was before 
the rise to dominance of its altered New York variant in the 1850s and 
60s, was known variously as Base Ball, Town Ball, Round Ball,[25] Round 
Town, Goal Ball, Field-base, Three-corner Cat, the New England game, or 
Massachusetts baseball. Generally speaking, "Round-ball" was the most usual 
name in New England, "Base-ball" in New York, and "Town-ball" in Pennsylvania 
and the South. A diagram posted in the baseball collection on the New York 
Public Library's Digital Gallery website identifies a game played, "Eight 
Boys with a ball & four bats playing [F]our Old Cat" (Image ID: 56105) 
[26] This game was apparently played on a square of 40 feet on each side, 
but the diagram does not make clear the rules or how to play the game.[27] 
The same sheet of paper shows a diagram of a square - 60 feet per side 
with the base side having in its middle the "Home Goal", "Catcher", and 
"Striker", and with the corners marked as "1st Goal", "2nd Goal", "3rd 
Goal", and "4th Goal" as you travel counter-clockwise around the square. 
The note accompanying this diagram says, "Thirty or more players (15 or 
more on each side) with a bat and ball playing Town Ball, some times called 
Round Ball, and subsequently the so-called Massachusetts game of Base Ball". 
Early baseball or town-ball had many, many variants, as would be expected 
of an informal boys' game, and most differed in several particulars from 
the game which developed in New York in the 1840s. Besides usually (but 
not always) being played on a 'rectangle' rather than a 'diamond,' with 
the batter positioned between fourth and first base (there were also variants 
with three and five bases), it was played by various numbers of players 
from six to over thirty a side, in most but not all versions there was 
no foul territory and every batted ball was in play,[28] innings were determined 
on the basis of either "all out/all out" as in cricket or "one out/all 
out", in many all out/all out versions there was an opportunity for the 
last batter to earn another inning by some prodigious feat of hitting, 
pitching was overhand (underhand pitching was mandatory in "New York" baseball 
until the 1880s),[29] and, perhaps most significantly, a baserunner was 
put out by "soaking" or hitting him with a thrown ball, just as in French 
poison-ball and Gutsmuth's englische Base-ball. There are other mentions 
of baseball during the early 19th century. The April 25, 1823 edition of 
the (New York) National Advocate included this: "I was last Saturday much 
pleased in witnessing a company of active young men playing the manly and 
athletic game of `base ball' at the Retreat in Broadway (Jones'). I am 
informed they are an organized association, and that a very interesting 
game will be played on Saturday next at the above place, to commence at 
half past 3 o'clock, P.M. Any person fond of witnessing this game may avail 
himself of seeing it played with consummate skill and wonderful dexterity."[30] 
Two years later the following notice appeared in the July 13, 1825 edition 
of the Delhi (New York) Gazette: "The undersigned, all residents of the 
new town of Hamden, with the exception of Asa Howland, who has recently 
removed into Delhi, challenge an equal number of persons of any town in 
the County of Delaware, to meet them at any time at the house of Edward 
B. Chace, in said town, to play the game of Bass-Ball, for the sum of one 
dollar each per game." Thurlow Weed in his memoir recalled organized club 
baseball in Rochester, New York in 1825: "Though an industrious and busy 
place, its citizens found leisure for rational and healthy recreation. 
A base-ball club, numbering nearly fifty members, met every afternoon during 
the ball-playing season. Though the members of the club embraced persons 
between eighteen and forty, it attracted the young and the old."[31] As 
mentioned above, in 1829 The Boy's Own Book was reprinted in Boston, including 
the rules of rounders, and Robin Carver's 1834 The Book of Sports copied 
the same rules almost verbatim but changed "Rounders" to "Base or Goal 
ball" because, as the preface states, those "are the names generally adopted 
in this country" - which also implies that the game was "generally" known 
and played. In 1833 the Olympic Ball Club of Philadelphia was organized,[32][33] 
and by 1837 the Gotham Base Ball Club would be formed in Manhattan, which 
would in later split to form the Knickerbocker Club. 1835 saw the publication 
of Boy's Book of Sports which, confusingly, has chapters for both "Base 
ball" and "Base, or Goal-ball", which seem to be little if at all different; 
both were "all out, all out" townball with soaking and a three-strike rule. 
Of more interest is the fact that here appears the earliest use of the 
terms "innings" and "diamond". The early 1840s saw the formation of at 
least three more clubs in Manhattan, the New York,[34] the Eagle and the 
Magnolia; another in Philadelphia, the Athletic; and even a club in Cincinnati. 
By 1851 the game of baseball was well-established enough that a newspaper 
report of a game played by a group of teamsters on Christmas Day referred 
to the game as "a good old-fashioned game of base ball".,[35] and the 1858 
report of the National Association of Base Ball Players declared that "The 
game of base-ball has long been a favorite and popular recreation in this 
country, but it is only within the last fifteen years that any attempt 
has been made to systematize and regulate the game."[33] The older game 
was recognized as being very different in character from the new "Knickerbocker" 
style. The New York Clipper of October 10, 1857, reported on a match between 
the Liberty Club of New Jersey and "a party of Old Fogies who were in the 
habit of playing the old fashioned base ball, which as nearly everyone 
knows, is entirely different from the base ball as now played." When, in 
1860, the Philadelphia Olympic Club voted to change over to the "New York 
game", several traditionalist members resigned in protest.[33] That same 
year the rival Athletic Club traveled to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania for 
a challenge match in which they competed against the local club in both 
town ball (the home team prevailed 45-43), and "New York" baseball (Athletic 
won easily, 34–2). Round-ball persisted in New England longer than in other 
regions and during the period of overlap was sometimes distinguished as 
the "New England game" or "Massachusetts baseball"; in 1858 a set of rules 
was drawn up by the Massachusetts Association of Base Ball Players at Dedham. 
This game was played by teams of ten to fourteen players with four bases 
60 feet apart and no foul territory. The ball was considerably smaller 
and lighter than a modern baseball, and runners were still put out by "soaking". 
The myth that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839 was once widely 
promoted and widely believed. There is no evidence for this claim except 
for the testimony of one unreliable man decades later, and there is persuasive 
counter-evidence. Doubleday himself never made such a claim; he left many 
letters and papers, but they contain no description of baseball or any 
suggestion that he considered himself prominent in the game's history. 
His New York Times obituary makes no mention of baseball, nor does a 1911 
Encyclopædia article about Doubleday. The story was attacked by baseball 
writers almost as soon as it came out, but it had the weight of Major League 
Baseball and the Spalding publishing empire behind it. Contrary to popular 
belief, Doubleday was never inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, although 
a large oil portrait of him was on display at the Hall of Fame building 
for many years. Doubleday's invention of baseball was the finding of a 
panel appointed by Albert Spalding, a former star pitcher and club executive, 
who had become the leading American sporting goods entrepreneur and sports 
publisher. Debate on baseball's origins had raged for decades, heating 
up in the first years of the 20th century, due in part to a 1903 essay 
baseball historian Henry Chadwick wrote in Spalding's Official Baseball 
Guide stating that baseball gradually evolved from English game of "rounders".[36] 
To end argument, speculation, and innuendo, Spalding organized the Mills 
Commission in 1905. The members were baseball figures, not historians: 
Spalding's friend Abraham G. Mills, a former National League president; 
two United States Senators, former NL president Morgan Bulkeley and former 
Washington club president Arthur Gorman; former NL president and lifelong 
secretary-treasurer Nick Young; two other star players turned sporting 
goods entrepreneurs (George Wright and Alfred Reach); and AAU president 
James E. Sullivan.[37] The final report, published on December 30, 1907, 
included three sections: a summary of the panel’s findings written by Mills, 
a letter by John Montgomery Ward supporting the panel, and a dissenting 
opinion by Henry Chadwick. The research methods were, at best, dubious. 
Mills was a close friend of Doubleday, and upon his death in 1893, Mills 
orchestrated Doubleday's memorial service and burial.[38] Doubleday had 
been a prominent member of the spiritualist Theosophical Society, in which 
Spalding's wife was deeply involved and in whose compound in San Diego 
Spalding was residing at the time. Wright and Reach were effectively Spalding's 
employees, as he had secretly bought out their sporting-goods businesses 
some years before. AAU president and Commission secretary Sullivan was 
Spalding's personal factotum. Several other members had personal reasons 
to declare baseball as an "American" game, such as Spalding's strong American 
imperialism views.[39] The Commission found an appealing story: baseball 
was invented in a quaint rural town without foreigners or industry, by 
a young man who later graduated from West Point and served heroically in 
the Mexican–American War, Civil War, and U.S. wars against Indians. The 
Mills Commission concluded that Doubleday had invented baseball in Cooperstown, 
New York in 1839; that Doubleday had invented the word "baseball", designed 
the diamond, indicated fielders' positions, and written the rules. No written 
records in the decade between 1839 and 1849 have ever been found to corroborate 
these claims, nor could Doubleday be interviewed (he died in 1893). The 
principal source for the story was one letter from elderly Abner Graves, 
who was a five-year-old resident of Cooperstown in 1839. Graves never mentioned 
a diamond, positions or the writing of rules. Graves' reliability as a 
witness was challenged because he spent his final days in an asylum for 
the criminally insane. Doubleday was not in Cooperstown in 1839 and may 
never have visited the town.[16] He was enrolled at West Point at the time, 
and there is no record of any leave time. Mills, a lifelong friend of Doubleday, 
never heard him mention baseball, nor is there any mention of the game 
in Doubleday's autobiography. In character Doubleday was bookish and sedentary, 
with no observable interest in athletics of any sort. As of 2014[update], 
Doubleday has not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Versions 
of baseball rules and descriptions of similar games have been found in 
publications that significantly predate his alleged invention in 1839. 
Despite this, the ballpark built in 1939 only a few blocks down from the 
Hall of Fame still bears the name "Doubleday Field". However, aside from 
the artificial intrusion of the person of Doubleday and the village of 
Cooperstown, the Mills report was not entirely incorrect in its broad outline: 
a game related to English rounders was played in America from early times; 
it was supplanted by a variant form which originated in New York circa 
1840. But this development happened in urban New York City, not pastoral 
Cooperstown, and the men involved were neither farm boys nor West Point 
cadets. The earliest known published[40] rules of baseball in the United 
States were written in 1845 for a New York City "base ball" club called 
the Knickerbockers.[41] The purported organizer of the club, Alexander 
Cartwright, is one person commonly known as "the father of baseball". The 
rules themselves were written by the two-man Committee on By-Laws, Vice-President 
William R. Wheaton and Secretary William H. Tucker. One important rule, 
the 13th, outlawed "soaking" or "plugging", putting a runner out by hitting 
him with a thrown ball, introducing instead the concept of the tag; this 
reflected the use of a farther-traveling and potentially injurious hard 
ball.[42] Another significant rule, the 15th, specified three outs to an 
inning for the first time instead of "one out, all out" or "all out, all 
out." The 10th rule prescribed foul lines and foul balls and the 18th forbade 
runners advancing on a foul, unlike the "Massachusetts game" in which all 
batted balls were in play. The Knickerbockers also enlarged the diamond 
well beyond that that of town ball, possibly to modern size depending on 
how "paces" is interpreted.[43] Evolution from the so-called "Knickerbocker 
Rules" to the current rules is fairly well documented. The most significant 
differences were that overhand pitching was illegal, strikes were only 
counted if the batter swung and missed, "wides" or balls were not counted 
at all, a batted ball caught on the first bounce was an out, and a game 
was played to 21 "aces" or runs rather than for a set number of innings. 
It is noteworthy, however, that the Knickerbocker Rules did not cover a 
number of basic elements of the game. For example, there was no mention 
of positions or the number of players on a side, the pitching distance 
was unspecified, the direction of base-running was left open, and it was 
never stated, though implied, that an "ace" was scored by crossing home 
plate. In all likelihood, all of these matters except the first were considered 
so intrinsic to baseball by this time that they were assumed; the number 
of players on a side, however, remained a matter of debate among clubs[44] 
until fixed at nine in 1857, the Knickerbockers arguing unsuccessfully 
for 7-man teams. On June 3, 1953, Congress officially credited Cartwright 
with inventing the modern game of baseball. He was already a member of 
the Baseball Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1938 for various other 
contributions to baseball. However, the role of Cartwright himself in the 
game's invention has been disputed. According to Major League Baseball's 
official historian John Thorn, "Cartwright’s plaque in the Baseball Hall 
of Fame declares he set the bases 90 feet apart and established nine innings 
as a game and nine players as a team. He did none of these things, and 
every other word of substance on his plaque is false."[45] His authorship 
may have been exaggerated in a modern attempt to identify a single inventor 
of the game, and heavily advanced by a relentless public-relations campaign 
by his son and grandson. The 1845 Rules themselves are signed by the "Committee 
on By-Laws", William R. Wheaton and William H. Tucker.There is evidence 
that these rules had been experimented with and used by New York ball clubs 
for some time; Cartwright, in his 1848 capacity as club secretary (and 
a bookseller), was merely the first to have them printed up. Further evidence 
of a more collective model of New York baseball's development, and doubts 
as to Cartwright's role as "inventor", came with the 2004 discovery of 
a newspaper interview with William R. Wheaton, a founding member of the 
Gotham Baseball Club in 1837 and first Vice President of the Knickerbocker 
Club, and co-author of its Rules, eight years later. "Three-cornered cat 
[ie. town ball, roundball] was a boy’s game, and did well enough for slight 
youngsters, but it was a dangerous game for powerful men, because the ball 
was thrown to put out a man between bases, and it had to hit the runner 
to put him out. The ball was made of a hard rubber center, tightly wrapped 
with yarn, and in the hands of a strong-armed man it was a terrible missile, 
and sometimes had fatal results when it came in contact with a delicate 
part of the player’s anatomy... "We had to have a good outdoor game, and 
as the games then in vogue didn't suit us we decided to remodel three-cornered 
cat and make a new game. We first organized what we called the Gotham Baseball 
Club. This was the first ball organization in the United States,[46] and 
it was completed in 1837. The first step we took in making baseball was 
to abolish the rule of throwing the ball at the runner and ordered instead 
that it should be thrown to the baseman instead, who had to touch the runner 
before he reached the base. During the regime of three-cornered cat there 
were no regular bases, but only such permanent objects as a bedded boulder 
or and old stump, and often the diamond looked strangely like an irregular 
polygon. We laid out the ground at Madison Square in the form of an accurate 
diamond, with home-plate and sand bags for bases.... If Wheaton's account, 
given in 1887, was correct, then most of the innovations credited to Cartwright 
were in fact the work of the Gothams before the Knickerbockers were formed, 
including a set a written rules. John Thorn, MLB's Official Historian, 
argued in his book Baseball in the Garden of Eden that four members of 
the Knickerbockers, namely Wheaton, Louis F. Wadsworth, Daniel "Doc" Adams 
and William H. Tucker, have stronger claims than Cartwright as "inventors" 
of modern baseball.[48][49] Legend holds that Cartwright also introduced 
the game in most of the towns where he stopped on his trek west to California 
to find gold, a sort of Johnny Appleseed of baseball. This story, however, 
arose from forged entries in Cartwright's diary which were inserted after 
his death. It is however certain that Cartwright, a New York bookseller 
who later caught gold fever, umpired the what was long believed to be the 
first-ever recorded U.S. baseball game between organized clubs in Hoboken, 
New Jersey on June 19, 1846. The game ended, and the Knickerbockers' opponents 
(the New York nine[50]) won, 23–1. However, at least three earlier reported 
games have since been discovered: on October 10, 1845 a game was played 
between the New York Ball Club and an unnamed[51] club from Brooklyn, at 
the Union Star Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn; the New Yorks lost 22 to 1. 
The game was reported in the New York Morning News and True Sun, making 
it the first ever published baseball result. The New Yorks and Brooklyns 
played two more games on October 21 and 24, with the first on the New Yorks' 
home diamond at Elysian Fields and the rematch at the Star Cricket Grounds 
again.[52][53] One point undisputed by historians is that the modern professional 
major leagues that began in the 1870s developed directly from the amateur 
urban clubs of the 1840s and 1850s, not from the pastures of small towns 
such as Cooperstown. In 1845, the Knickerbocker Club began using Elysian 
Fields in Hoboken to play baseball, following the New York and Magnolia 
Ball Clubs which had begun playing there in 1843. At a preliminary meeting 
[of the Knickerbockers], it was suggested that as it was apparent they 
would soon be driven from Murray Hill, some suitable place should be obtained 
in New Jersey, where their stay could be permanent; accordingly, a day 
or two afterwards, enough to make a game assembled at Barclay street ferry, 
crossed over, marched up the road, prospecting for ground on each side, 
until they reached the Elysian Fields, where they "settled."[54] On October 
21, 1845 the New York Ball Club played the second of their three games 
against a Brooklyn team there, the series being the first known inter-club 
baseball games. In June 1846 the Knickerbockers played the "New York nine" 
(probably the same New York Ball Club) in the first baseball game played 
between clubs according to codified rules. A plaque and baseball diamond 
street pavings at 11th and Washington Streets commemorate the event. By 
the 1850s, several Manhattan-based members of the National Association 
of Base Ball Players were using the grounds as their home field. In 1865 
the grounds hosted a championship match between the Mutual Club of New 
York and the Atlantic Club of Brooklyn that was attended by an estimated 
20,000 fans and captured in the Currier & Ives lithograph The American 
National Game of Base Ball. With the construction of two significant baseball 
parks enclosed by fences in Brooklyn, enabling promoters there to charge 
admission to games; the prominence of Elysian Fields began to diminish. 
In 1868 the leading Manhattan club, Mutual, shifted its home games to the 
Union Grounds in Brooklyn. In 1880, the founders of the professional National 
League's New York club and the Metropolitan Club of the American Association 
finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan at the former Polo 
Grounds on 110th Street. The Knickerbockers published their rulebook in 
1848, including one significant change: the introduction of the force-out, 
but only at first base. In 1852 the Eagle Club published their rules, and 
two years later the Knickerbockers, Eagles and Gothams met and agreed to 
a uniform set of rules to govern all three clubs, at least in match play, 
which for the first time set the pitching distance (45 feet). A preliminary 
meeting in 1855 between seven other clubs, five from New York and one each 
from Brooklyn and New Jersey,[55] represented the first effort to form 
an organized league, although it came to nothing. However, in 1857 sixteen 
clubs from New York and environs sent delegates to a convention that standardized 
the rules, essentially by agreeing to the unified Knickerbocker-Gotham-Eagle 
rules with certain revisions: rather than playing to a set number of runs, 
games would consist of nine innings, and force-outs could now occur at 
any base. The convention also defined the distance between the bases unambiguously 
as 90 feet, and specified nine-man teams.[56] The following year, twenty-five 
clubs including one from New Jersey established an ongoing governing body 
with officers, constitution and by-laws, but the National Association of 
Base Ball Players is conventionally dated from the first meeting in 1857. 
It governed through 1870 but it scheduled and sanctioned no games. In 1858, 
clubs from the association played a cross-town, all-star series pitting 
Brooklyn clubs against clubs from New York and Hoboken.[57] On July 20, 
1858, an estimated crowd of about 4,000 spectators watched New York and 
Hoboken defeat Brooklyn by a score of 22–18. The New York team included 
players from the Union, Empire, Eagle, Knickerbocker and Gotham clubs. 
The Brooklyn team included players from the clubs Excelsior, Eckford, Atlantic 
and Putnam.[58] This was the first baseball game played before a paying 
crowd, with tickets priced at ten cents;[59] the surplus receipts after 
costs were donated to charity. In a return match held August 17, 1858, 
and played at the Fashion Course in the Corona neighborhood of Queens, 
a slightly smaller crowd cheered Brooklyn to a win over New York and Hoboken 
by a score of 29–8.[60] New York won a third game in the series, also played 
at the Fashion Course, on September 10, 1858.[61] By 1862 some NABBP member 
clubs offered games to the general public in enclosed ballparks with admission 
fees. During and after the American Civil War, the movements of soldiers 
and exchanges of prisoners helped spread the game. As of the December 1865 
meeting, the year the war ended, there were isolated Association clubs 
in Fort Leavenworth, St. Louis, Louisville, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, 
along with about 90 member clubs north and east of Washington, D.C.. The 
game that was spread, however, was overwhelmingly the Knickerbocker version 
to the detriment of the older forms; as one periodical stated in 1865, 
The National Association or "New-York game" is now almost universally adopted 
by the Clubs all over the country ; and the Massachusetts, and still more 
ancient style of playing familiar to any school-boy, called "town ball", 
will soon become obsolete. No lover of the pastime can regret this, as 
the New-York mode is superior and more attractive in every way ; and better 
calculated to perpetuate and render "our national game" an "institution" 
with both "young and old America." – Wilkes’ Spirit of the Times, March 
18, 1865 [3] In 1869 the first openly professional baseball team formed. 
Earlier players were nominally amateurs. The Cincinnati Red Stockings recruited 
nationally and effectively toured nationally, and no one beat them until 
June 1870. Their success led to the founding of the National Association 
of Professional Base Ball Players in 1871 and its successor the National 
League of Professional Base Ball Clubs in 1876, the elder of baseball's 
two Major Leagues and the oldest professional sports league in the world.[62] 
Already in the 19th century, the "old game" was invoked for special exhibitions 
such as reunions and anniversaries—and for making moral points. Today hundreds 
of clubs in the U.S. play "vintage base ball" according to the 1845, 1858, 
or later rules (up to about 1887), usually in vintage uniforms. Some of 
them have supporting casts that recreate period dress and manner, especially 
those associated with living history museums. The origins of baseball were 
summarized in a documentary produced by Major League Baseball in 2009 titled 
Base Ball Discovered.[63] The Base Ball match between eight Brooklyn players, 
and eight players of New York, came off on Friday on the grounds of the 
Union Star Cricket Club. The Yorkers were singularly unfortunate in scoring 
but one run in their three innings. Brooklyn scored 22 and of course came
