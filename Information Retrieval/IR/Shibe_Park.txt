Right Field – 329 ft Shibe Park, known later as Connie Mack Stadium, was 
a baseball park located in Philadelphia. It was the home of the Philadelphia 
Athletics of the American League (AL) and the Philadelphia Phillies of 
the National League (NL). When it opened April 12, 1909, it became baseball's 
first steel-and-concrete stadium.[3] In different eras it was home to "The 
$100,000 Infield", "The Whiz Kids", and "The 1964 Phold". The venue's two 
home teams won both the first and last games at the stadium: the Athletics 
beat the Boston Red Sox 8–1 on opening day 1909, while the Phillies beat 
the Montreal Expos 2–1 on October 1, 1970, in the park's final contest. 
Shibe Park stood on the block bounded by Lehigh Avenue, 20th Street, Somerset 
Street and 21st Street. It was five blocks west, corner-to-corner, from 
the Baker Bowl, the Phillies' home from 1887 to 1938. The stadium hosted 
eight World Series and two MLB All-Star Games, in 1943 and 1952, with the 
latter game holding the distinction of being the only All-Star contest 
shortened by rain (to five innings). In May 1939, it was the site of the 
first night game played in the American League. Phillies Hall-of-Fame centerfielder 
and longtime broadcaster Richie Ashburn remembered Shibe Park: "It looked 
like a ballpark. It smelled like a ballpark. It had a feeling and a heartbeat, 
a personality that was all baseball."[4] In the early years of the 20th 
century, baseball was popular enough in Philadelphia that Philadelphia 
Athletics president Ben Shibe found his team regularly turning away customers 
from their cramped Columbia Park ballpark even though it was just a few 
years old. When as many as 28,000 showed up to fill the 9,500 wooden bleacher 
seats, Shibe and partner Connie Mack decided the A's needed a new place 
to play.[5] He searched for a site for his new park and found one on Lehigh 
Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets, five blocks west of Baker Bowl, straddling 
the neighborhoods known as Swampoodle and Goosetown. It was still primitive 
at the time, an area of "high clay bluffs, rain-washed gullies, quagmires, 
open fields, even ponds"[6] where chickens pecked and pigs rooted. Although 
a grid of streets was planned for the area, few actually existed. The area 
was already served by public transportation: trolleys ran up and down Broad 
Street and back and forth along Lehigh, and both the Pennsylvania and the 
Reading railroads had major stations nearby. The area had "underachieved" 
thus far due to the presence of the city's Hospital for Contagious Diseases 
(the "smallpox hospital") a block west on Lehigh, but Shibe's privileged 
connections in town brought him word that the city would be closing the 
facility.[7] Without the hospital, the area's stigma would eventually dissipate, 
but at the time, the land was still a bargain. Shibe quietly assembled 
title to his square block of land early in 1907, picking up parcels "through 
a complicated series of acquisitions, preventing price inflation by masking 
his intentions,"[7] even using straw buyers to keep his name out of the 
dealings.[8] He spent a total of $67,500 ($1.78 million in 2016 dollars) 
on seven land packages totaling 5.75 acres,[8] and in February 1908, he 
arranged to have two projected streets running through his block dropped 
from the city plan.[7] For the design and its execution, Shibe hired William 
Steele and Sons.[9] Their engineering staff had worked with the new technology 
of steel-reinforced concrete, and designed and built the city's first skyscraper, 
the Witherspoon Building at Walnut and Juniper Streets. The Steele design 
for the Shibe façade was in the ornate French Renaissance style, including 
arches, vaultings, and Ionic pilasters. The grandstand walls were to be 
of red brick and terra cotta and featured elaborate decorative friezes 
with baseball motifs, while cartouches framed the Athletics' "A" logo at 
regular intervals above the entrances. The souvenir program on Opening 
Day called it "a fetching combination of color."[10] Gabled dormer windows 
on the upper deck's copper-trimmed green-slate mansard roof looked out 
over the streets below.[11] Presiding over all were terra cotta busts of 
Shibe and Mack above the main entrances on Lehigh and 21st.[10] The signature 
feature of the exterior design was the octangular tower on the southwest 
corner. The upper floors would accommodate the A's offices, those of Shibe's 
sons Jack and Tom, who ran the day-to-day business aspects of the team,[12] 
and the domed cupola on the very top were to house the office of Connie 
Mack, manager of the team's baseball operations. On the ground floor was 
a main entrance lobby. Bobby Shantz, pitcher for the A's in their last 
years at Shibe, wrote that the corner tower entrance "looked almost like 
a church."[7] Shibe was proud of the egalitarianism of the design; he said 
it was "for the masses as well as the classes."[13] In April 1908, design 
in hand, the Shibes and the Steeles broke ground. With the resources of 
the Steele firm, construction was speedy, efficient and completed in time 
to open the 1909 season.[14] The city was excited about its new ballpark 
– the Philadelphia Public Ledger called it "a palace for fans, the most 
beautiful and capacious baseball structure in the world."[15] American 
League president Ban Johnson pronounced that "Shibe Park is the greatest 
place of its character in the world."[16] In more recent times, baseball 
author David M. Jordan wrote that it was "a splendid forerunner of others 
like it ... Ben Shibe and the Steeles initiated 'the golden age of ballparks'."[17] 
The original 1909 configuration was a double-deck grandstand in the southwest 
corner of the block, with open pavilion seating extending to the foul poles. 
The outfield was a large rectangle, surrounded by a 12-foot brick wall 
that bordered the streets. The deepest part of center field was a square 
corner 515 feet from home plate. It was 378 to the left field foul marker, 
and 340 to right field. The slight upslope of the land from south to north 
was reflected in a small "terrace" that ran across left and center field.[18] 
The upper deck was built of wood mounted on steel girders, while the lower 
deck was built of concrete and steel.[19] The only link with the Columbia 
Park was the transplanted sod, rolled out at the new venue. The 1909 seating 
capacity certainly was an upgrade from Columbia Park: 11,000 in the double 
deck and 12,000 in the two pavilions, for a total of 23,000. Overflow crowds 
were accommodated by roping off the left field area in front of the wall. 
Some 500 tons of steel went into the construction.[20] On Monday, April 
12, 1909, the Opening Day proceedings walked a fine line between festival 
and chaos. More than 30,000 fans showed up and got in; another 15,000 showed 
up and were turned away. Nervous officials closed the gates hours before 
game time, turning the outsiders into a "howling mob of thousands"[21] 
whose pressure forced open one of the gates. Hundreds poured in without 
paying admission, and an estimated 7,000 standing-room only spectators 
saw that first game ringing the outfield up to seven-deep, held back by 
a rope stretched between the left field seats and the right field bleacher.[22] 
Another 6,000 more looked in from various rooftops around the block. "It 
seemed as if all of Philadelphia was there", wrote the Public Ledger.[21] 
Mayor John E. Reyburn called the new facility a "pride to the city"[17] 
and threw out the first ball. The A's beat the Boston Red Sox that day, 
8–1. The Athletics and their new stadium were a hit: the A's won pennants 
– and brought World Series to town – in 1910 and 1911, and by 1913, when 
they would win another, Shibe initiated the first of the expansions of 
seating capacity that would continue right on through the 1950s. He called 
again upon the Steele company and added a new unroofed bleacher section 
across left field, taking advantage of the site's rectangular, rather than 
square, shape,[13] and also added roof structures to cover the open pavilions 
down the first base and third base lines. After Ben Shibe's death in 1922, 
sons Tom and Jack represented the Shibe interest in the team[23] and in 
1925 they replaced the 1913 open left field bleachers with a double-deck 
that extended from the foul pole to the center field corner. This construction 
covered the "terrace" except in the deepest part of center field which 
still had a slight upslope. They also extended the upper deck out over 
the pavilions. These expansions resulted in another 10,000 seats.[24] In 
1928, the brothers installed a mezzanine that added 750 pricey box seats 
and the following year they raised the original grandstand roof and installed 
a press box underneath it, along with 3,500 more seats.[24] For the 1923 
season, Connie Mack had moved the infield back an estimated 21 feet. This 
was a choice of speed over power, as moving the plate back increased left 
field and right field dimensions by 15 feet each. Home runs dropped about 
50% for the next three seasons.[19] The Shibe brothers moved it back to 
its original position, resulting in field dimensions of 331 feet to right 
field, 334 to left, and 468 to the square corner in center. In 1936, A's 
President Tom Shibe died, and Connie Mack succeeded in gaining control 
of the team by buying out Tom Shibe's share from his widow. The move made 
the Mack family the controlling partner in 1937, though various Shibe family 
members still had "considerable holdings" in the team.[24] More renovation 
– and a round of controversy – came after the 1938 season when Mack sought 
to install light towers for night play, which local residents were against. 
They objected in general to the light, noise and traffic that night games 
would bring to the neighborhood, and objected specifically to the danger 
of home run balls hitting them as they sat on their porches and to the 
ability of fans in the upper decks to peer into their bedrooms at night.[25] 
The matter went to court, and Mack hired a young Philadelphia lawyer to 
plead his case. The presentation of young Richardson Dilworth, future mayor 
of the city, carried the day: the A's won the case and the light towers 
went up in time for the 1939 season.[26] The first night game in the AL 
was at Shibe Park on May 16, 1939: the Indians beat the A's, 8–3.[27] In 
1941, Mack installed a new, larger scoreboard in deep right-center field, 
replacing the small board that had been in the same general area,[28] and 
about the same time an imposing sign went up on the left field fence with 
the fan-friendly message: "Warning: Persons throwing bottles or other missiles 
will be arrested and prosecuted." A few years later, he would further add 
a tunnel between the visitors' clubhouse and their dugout to avoid confrontations 
with belligerent hometown fans, who were often not afraid to pick a fight.[29] 
After the war, the Macks wanted to expand the seating capacity again, in 
a park that was running out of room to expand into. In 1949, they proposed 
erecting the ultimate spite fence: a new double-deck seating section in 
right field that would boost the park's capacity to 50,000.[25] The problem 
was that the home plate-to-right field axis was the shorter dimension of 
the Shibe block rectangle, and since the new stand could not intrude into 
the play area, its fascia would have to be in the plane of the existing 
right field fence while its hindquarters would have to protrude out back, 
dangling some 15 feet above the west sidewalk of North 20th Street and 
forming a covered arcade walkway. The $2.5-million proposal galvanized 
the 20th Street neighbors against the A's again, and this time the legal 
team could not overcome the zoning issues.[25] The Macks did spend $300,000 
on renovations in 1949 and managed to shoehorn 2,500 more box seats in;[25] 
the old lower deck pavilion seating was reconstructed to turn the more 
distant seats toward the diamond instead of facing the outfield.[30] This 
resulted in the high corners that were a noticeable feature of the ballpark 
during its final two decades, the corners being just far enough away from 
the foul lines to accommodate the bullpens. They also added an "annunciator" 
on the upper deck beyond third base that flashed the at-bat number; ball-strike-out 
count; hit or error; and score.[29] At the park's beginning, homeowners 
on both Somerset Street and 20th Street had a great view of the proceedings 
within, thanks to the low outfield fences. While this changed for the people 
on Somerset in 1913 when Shibe added the left field bleacher section and 
blocked the view from that direction,[31] it was still a clear shot in 
from 20th Street over the low, 12-foot wall in right. The view from the 
roofs, the bedroom bay windows, and even the porch roofs on 20th was as 
good as from some of the seats inside the park: Pathé News, Universal Newsreel 
and Fox Movietone News even set up cameras at 2739 North 20th as part of 
their World Series coverage.[32] The numbers involved in this cottage industry 
were considerable: a rooftop bleacher could hold up to 80 people, with 
18 more in the bay window of the front bedroom and more even on the porch 
roof.[33][34] Viewers on the block could number up to several thousand 
for important games.[33] Housewives served up refreshments for sale and 
children scurried to the hot dog vendors on the street, bought dogs for 
a nickel, and brought them back to sell for a dime.[32] With so much money 
on the line, the business got organized and formalized very quickly; homeowners 
were quickly squeezed for bribes by city amusement tax collectors, and 
city police collected commissions for collaring and herding fans from the 
sidewalk into particular homes.[31] By 1929, the extra income from the 
rooftop bleachers actually caused real estate values to climb on the 2700 
block of N. 20th Street.[32] As long as the A's were winning games and 
filling the park, the 20th Street entrepreneurs were annoying, but little 
more, to Mack and the Shibes, but that changed in the early 1930s.[32] 
Starting in 1932, Mack's sell-off of his Second Dynasty stars, combined 
with general Great Depression hard times, sent attendance plummeting. 20th 
Streeters, accustomed to the income but now suffering from the tough economy 
like everyone else, sent reps to the lines – such as they were – at the 
Shibe box office to offer discount seats and poach customers from the ball 
club.[35] This was the last straw for Jack Shibe. In the winter of 1934–35, 
he ordered the fence raised to nearly 50 feet. While the fence-raising 
was Jack Shibe's idea, it became generally known as "Connie Mack's Spite 
Fence."[35] It not only limited the view from the street, but the unattractive 
corrugated metal structure curtailed much of the goodwill the team had 
had with its neighbors, goodwill that would never return.[36] It also frustrated 
many Philadelphia players, both offensively and defensively. Among them, 
A's and Phillies outfielder Elmer Valo and Phillies right fielder Johnny 
Callison, both lefthanded batters, complained that the high right-field 
fence cost them many home runs.[37] It dogged them when they played the 
field, too: its rippling corrugations made caroms unpredictable, with some 
balls dropping straight down, others bounding all the way back to second 
base and some bouncing radically to one side or another, sometimes into 
the bullpen. It was "one of the hardest" walls to play in the majors.[38] 
For several years, the National League Phillies had been trying to escape 
their dilapidated home, Baker Bowl, and move to Shibe Park as tenants of 
the A's. However, it took them until mid-season 1938 before they were able 
to get out of their lease and move the five blocks west on Lehigh to Shibe 
Park.[39] The Phillies' arrangement with Connie Mack was simple: they would 
pay 10 cents a head "rent" for the fans they drew and would hire and pay 
their own stadium staff on game days.[40] While moving to Shibe likely 
saved the Phillies from extinction, having two teams play in the park complicated 
the scheduling enormously. Any impact of the extra income from the Phillies 
was blunted by the fact that the crowded baseball schedule virtually precluded 
any other events throughout the summer – so the new tenant's income actually 
affected the A's bottom line very little.[40] The Phillies' tenure at Shibe 
Park began with a split doubleheader against Boston on July 4 that year, 
and they finished the season last in the league, 24½ games behind the seventh 
place Brooklyn Dodgers and 43 games back overall.[40] 21st and Lehigh was 
one of the gloomiest addresses in baseball in the late 1930s and early 
1940s. At the time, both Philadelphia teams were in the midst of long stretches 
of futility. The Phillies had notched only one winning season since 1918, 
while the A's had not had a winning season since 1933. Both teams finished 
last in their respective leagues in 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1945.[41] 
Making things worse was that Phillies owner Gerald Nugent was mired in 
debt to both Mack and the National League, and other NL owners were grumbling 
about the dismal "gates" that their Philly trips earned them.[42] In 1943 
Nugent agreed in principle to sell the Phillies to Bill Veeck, only to 
have that sale derailed by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis's objections 
to Veeck's plans to stock the Phillies with Negro League stars.[43] The 
league took over the franchise and sold it to lumber baron William Cox, 
who paid off Mack and put money down on future rent.[42] While the flamboyant 
Cox did pour money into the team in an effort to turn it around, he also 
abraded fans, his own players, fellow owners and Landis. The uproar did 
not last long, though: when Cox was found to be betting on Phillies games, 
Landis banned him for life in short order. Cox then sold the Phillies to 
DuPont vice president R. R. M. Carpenter, who gave the club presidency 
to his son, Bob, Jr. – a wealthy 28-year-old Delawarean whose mother was 
a DuPont and who himself was part-owner with Connie Mack of the Wilmington 
Blue Rocks minor league team.[42] The genial young millionaire admitted 
at his first press conference that he was short on experience, but added, 
"But I'm not worried. I think we can all have a good time."[44] Carpenter 
slowly pulled the team out of its "dime store" way of doing business[45] 
and invested major funds in the farm system, hired marketing consultants 
and investigated strategies for selling more tickets. He upgraded his staff 
with professional administrators who modernized operations[45] at the same 
time he was spending time in Mr. Mack's plush tower office getting guidance 
from The Grand Old Man of Baseball.[46] The result was an upsurge in attendance, 
including the city's first million-fan season in 1946, and the 1950 "Whiz 
Kids" team, who brought the NL pennant to Philadelphia for the first time 
in 35 years. But as the Phillies improved the quality of baseball life 
in Philadelphia, there was a simultaneous decline in the fortunes of the 
A's – in the team, in the owner, and in the ballpark. Mack had alienated 
many fans in 1915 and again in 1932 when he sold off his pennant-winning 
teams for cash, and his clashes with his neighbors over the spite fence, 
the night games and the 20th Street overhang sparked ill-will between the 
team and its most important asset: its fan base.[46] The Phillies began 
to outdraw the A's, whose bottom-feeder status in the American League contributed 
to the vicious circle of bad teams and empty seats. There was also a precipitous 
decline in the boss himself. 1950 marked Mack's 50th year in Philadelphia 
and his 87th birthday, and for the better part of a decade it had been 
obvious he was going senile.[47] He would spend most games asleep in the 
dugout, leaving game strategy in the hands of his coaches. Whenever he 
was awake, he often made strange calls that the players and coaches usually 
disregarded.[48] He would also call for players from decades earlier to 
pinch-hit; in the 1940s it was not uncommon for him to yell "Baker!" or 
"Foxx!" – sluggers he had sold off decades before.[49] Most ominous of 
all, the crowds at Shibe Park were so small that the other AL teams could 
not even begin to cover their travel expenses, leading the other owners 
to complain that the gates at Shibe Park were too small to justify the 
trip.[50] Despite this, the A's managed to awaken from their slumber and 
tally three straight winning seasons from 1947 to 1949. This led to hopes 
that the A's would give "The Grand Old Man of Baseball" the perfect 50th 
anniversary present – a pennant. However, the 1950 season was an unmitigated 
disaster. By May 26, they were 11-21, their season all but finished. On 
that date, Mack's sons Roy and Earle gently pushed their father into announcing 
his retirement at the end of the season.[48] The power vacuum in the wake 
of "Mr. Baseball's" exit only worsened the problems, however. Roy and Earle 
Mack, "undistinguished men living in the shadow of their father,"[51] were 
products of Mack's first marriage; their half-brother Connie, Jr. – 20 
years their junior – came from his second. As the family factions squared 
off to battle for control of the A's, Junior and his mother joined forces 
with remnants of the Shibe family, who still owned 40% of the stock, while 
Roy and Earle shelved their years of squabbles to present a united front 
against what they derisively called "the Shibe faction."[51] To raise cash 
for the coming internecine struggle, Roy and Earle made all the wrong decisions: 
they remortgaged the ballpark at a time when their cashflow was uncertain, 
and they jeopardized that flow even more by leasing the park concessions 
to an outside food service corporation.[52] In short order, the brothers 
had acquired huge excess debt and lost their best income sources to repay 
it. They managed to buy out Junior, the second Mrs. Mack and the remaining 
Shibes late in 1950. However, they made what was one of the worst of several 
bad business decisions by mortgaging the team and pledging Shibe Park as 
collateral – thus saddling the A's with hefty mortgage payments that could 
have been spent on improving the team and the park.[48] The business the 
brothers had gained control of was a doomed enterprise. And the moment 
they got control of it, they resumed battling each other.[53] Despite undeniable 
signs of deterioration, it would be a few more years before the operation 
collapsed entirely. In the meantime, the Macks tried to capitalize on the 
remaining vestiges of affection in the city for their father, who turned 
90 years old in December 1952. They opened the nostalgic Elephant Room, 
filled with memorabilia from the old glory days, under the first base grandstand.[54] 
They renamed the park Connie Mack Stadium in February 1953[55] for the 
opening of the 1953 season, hanging a new metal plate over the old SHIBE 
PARK inscription, which was "still written in stone" beneath.[56] Many 
old-timers refused to acknowledge the change.[56] The Macks' bad business 
decisions finally caught up with them in 1954. While Roy had hoped to keep 
the team, Earle wanted out, and the meager attendance figures were hard 
to argue with. The A's business plan required attendance of 550,000 to 
break even.[57] However, in 1954 they drew just 305,000.[50] An embarrassing 
"Save the A's" committee formed to help, and it published the daily figure 
of turnout needed to stay out of the red, but the turnstile count remained 
flat while the published number grew each day[58] and the committee collapsed 
in the stretch run. Even Mayor Joe Clark hurt the effort: he admitted he 
was a Phillies fan.[57] The A's finished 1954 dead last in the majors, 
60 games out of first;[59] their final game at Shibe drew only 1,715 fans.[60] 
In early August, Chicago businessman Arnold Johnson stepped forward with 
a complicated $3.375 million plan to buy the Athletics and move them to 
Kansas City. He owned Blues Stadium, home to the New York Yankees' top 
minor-league affiliate, but intended to sell it to the city for upgrading 
to major league standards. Roy, Earle and Connie Mack, Sr. would get about 
$1.5 million, plus Johnson would pay off the remaining mortgage and assume 
the $400,000–$800,000 debt to the concessionaires.[61] Very little of Johnson's 
own cash would be involved: the deal depended on real estate and the eagerness 
of the Kansas City town fathers to take on debt to snag a major league 
franchise.[62] The fly in the ointment was Connie Mack Stadium. The plan 
assumed a $1.5 million cash infusion from Bob Carpenter to buy the old 
ballpark, and he was anything but enthusiastic about it. "We need that 
ballpark as much as we need a hole in the head", he said.[30] Carpenter 
estimated that modernizing the place would cost a million dollars, and 
even at that it would be impossible to enlarge the seating capacity.[62] 
He also recognized the growing parking problem, as well as the declining 
affluence of the neighborhood.[63] He tried to pass on the purchase, reminding 
Johnson that he had a lease until 1957. Johnson responded by threatening 
to raise the "rent" to 20 cents a head, and to bill the Phillies for stadium 
upkeep the A's had always paid for.[62] When Carpenter did not show signs 
of giving in, Johnson said he would call the entire deal off. Carpenter 
knew he did not have much choice, since no other facility in the Delaware 
Valley was suitable even for temporary use. Reluctantly, he formed the 
21st and Lehigh Realty Company to buy the park for $1.7 million, and collected 
rent from the Phillies just as the A's had previously—though this effectively 
resulted in Carpenter transferring money from one pocket to another.[64] 
The deal was done and the A's were gone. In early 1955, two trucks backed 
up to the stadium and packed the artifacts from the Elephant Room for removal 
to Kansas City. Carpenter graciously encouraged Mr. Mack to continue using 
his opulent tower office in the stadium that now bore his name, which he 
did almost daily until his death some 13 months later.[65] When the stadium 
opened for the 1955 season, Carpenter's first, advertising billboards first 
appeared on the walls and roofs of the outfield: Formost dairy, Goldenberg's 
Peanut Chews, Philco, Cadillac, Alpo, Coca-Cola and Mertz Tours signs became 
familiar sights to stadiumgoers and to fans watching on television.[66] 
A new straight-across fence covered the square corner in center field and 
most of the remaining "terrace", reducing the distance to a still-formidable 
447 feet.[67] Distance markers also appeared on the walls for the first 
time. In addition to the foul poles (334 and 331) and the center field 
area (447), a 400 marker was posted just to the center field side of the 
scoreboard, and a 405 marker in the corresponding area of deep left center 
field. A few years later, wooden fencing covered the rough bricks along 
the right field wall, and eventually the 331 sign was changed to read 329, 
although that change had no impact on the actual home run distance.[68] 
In 1956, Bob Carpenter replaced the old 1941 scoreboard in right-center 
field with a new, much larger board, constructed for Connie Mack Stadium. 
A prominent feature of the new board was the Ballantine Beer advertisement 
across the top and the Longines clock perched above it. The board's superficial 
resemblance to the similarly-adorned board in Yankee Stadium gave rise 
to the urban legend that the board was acquired second-hand from the Yankees.[69] 
However, the boards differed in many details, and the Yankee Stadium board 
remained until 1959 when it was replaced, a few years after Connie Mack 
Stadium's new board had made its appearance.[70] The big scoreboard extended 
well above the top of the right field fence, topping out at 75 feet including 
the clock. The entire board was in play except for the clock that topped 
the board: Balls that hit the clock were home runs. Dick Allen was the 
only player to ever hit a home run over the Ballantine Beer sign and scoreboard.[19] 
The scoreboard was used through the final year at the ballpark.[71] Also 
in 1956, a new Plexiglas barrier replaced the old backstop screen, an experiment 
also conducted at Cincinnati's Crosley Field around that same time.[72] 
After the death of Mr. Mack in February 1956, a Mack Memorial Committee 
raised funds and commissioned sculptor Harry Rosin to create a statue of 
"Mr. Baseball". On April 16, 1957, it was unveiled across Lehigh Avenue 
in Reyburn Park – named after the mayor who threw out the first ball at 
Shibe back in 1909 – as part of the Opening Day ceremonies for the 1957 
season. Commissioner Ford Frick, AL president Will Harridge and Leo Durocher 
all attended, as did many former A's players; the ceremony was emceed by 
sportscaster Bill Campbell. Shortly after, Philadelphia City Council removed 
Reyburn's name from the park and replaced it with Mack's.[73] The statue 
was later moved to Veterans Stadium in 1971, and ultimately to Citizens 
Bank Park in 2004. For the 1960 season, additional box seats in front of 
the original grandstand reduced the plate-to-screen distance by about 10 feet.[68] 
With a couple of years of life left in the park, a curving inner fence 
across center field reduced the distance from 447 to 410.[74] The final 
seating capacity of the ballpark, as recorded in the 1970 Sporting News 
Baseball Guide, was 33,608. Carpenter's reluctance about Connie Mack Stadium 
soon proved justified. He found it impossible to find a way to make the 
park profitable. His first thought was to extend the length of his income 
season by adding a football team. In 1959 he sought to buy an American 
Football League franchise, but the negotiations failed.[64] Additionally, 
the neighborhood rapidly went to seed;[63] the phrase "Watch your car, 
mister?" became a catch phrase to game attendees.[75] Indeed, the parking 
problem became the very crux of the issue in the 1950s and 1960s: whereas 
most people had formerly come to the park on public transportation, after 
the war, the automobile became the standard mode of transport.[63] There 
was a 500-car lot, later expanded to 850 cars, across 21st Street, but 
it was not nearly enough. Carpenter tried to buy the whole block in 1959 
for a multi-level garage, but the deal fell through.[76] The team maintained 
special "Phillies Express" buses to shuttle fans from transportation hubs 
in Camden and the 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby, but the service 
never really caught on.[75] Carpenter also investigated land tracts first 
in West Philadelphia, then in the Torresdale section of the city, as well 
as nearby suburban Cheltenham and farther-flung Camden, across the river 
in New Jersey. But there were prohibitive problems with every one of those 
proposed sites.[77] Carpenter finally gave up and in 1961 sold the stadium 
for $600,000 to a group of New York real estate investors, losing over 
a million dollars after his 7-year ownership; he secured a 3-year lease 
and an option to stay through 1967 while he pursued his Torresdale stadium 
plan.[64] The New York buyers quickly flipped the property to another New 
York consortium who, assuming the Phillies would be gone by 1967, began 
planning the demolition of the stadium and construction of a bowling alley 
and discount store on the site.[78] Then in May 1964, Jerry Wolman, who 
had just bought the Philadelphia Eagles in February, brought the stadium 
ownership back to town, paying $757,000 for it as part of a larger real 
estate deal.[79] Wolman's motivations for the purchase are in dispute[79] 
– all the mortgage shuffling did not slow the decay out at the park – but 
he claimed he wanted to help the Phillies; the move also put him at the 
very center of the emerging fight over a new stadium in Philadelphia, which 
would likely affect his Eagles.[79] Wolman, the city, and even Carpenter 
were all exploring plans to solve the town's stadium problem. The plan 
that came closest to fruition was a complicated 1964 package that called 
for a new stadium with parking for 7,000 cars to be built "on stilts" over 
the vast railroad yards near 30th Street Station. This plan had considerable 
backing from city politicians and businessmen,[79] but it too eventually 
unraveled when federal urban renewal funds did not come through and extended 
wrangling between Wolman and everyone else involved brought it down.[80] 
Wolman then tried to sell the park to the city for the nominal price of 
50 cents, but Mayor James Tate balked at using city money to pay for major 
renovations.[81] Eventually the city would build Veterans Stadium in South 
Philadelphia and the Phillies would leave Connie Mack Stadium. The final 
game at Connie Mack Stadium was played on October 1, 1970, with the Phillies 
defeating the Montreal Expos 2–1 in 10 innings. The occasion was marred 
by souvenir hunters literally dismantling the stadium even while the game 
was still in progress. A special post-game ceremony – including a helicopter 
removal of home plate and delivery of it at The Vet – was cancelled in 
the mayhem.[82] Over its 62 seasons of operation, Shibe Park was home to 
some of the best teams of their eras – and to some of the worst: the A's 
and the Phillies won eight of their leagues' pennants, bringing eight World 
Series to 21st and Lehigh. The two clubs also finished dead last in their 
leagues a combined 30 times – 18 by the A's, 12 by the Phillies.[83] In 
1996, Sports Illustrated proclaimed on its cover: "The 1929 Philadelphia 
A's, not the '27 Yankees, may have been the greatest baseball club ever 
assembled."[84] Over their first six seasons in the park, the A's dominated 
the American League. They won four pennants those six years and were famed 
for their $100,000 Infield, said by statistician Bill James to be the greatest 
infield of all time.[85] Baseball historians since have dubbed the 1910–1914 
A's clubs "The First Dynasty"; it was "the sport's first championship dynasty 
ever."[86] After the 1914 team lost the World Series in four games,[87] 
Connie Mack sold off his top stars. If there was any doubt the dynasty 
had ended, A's teams finished last in the AL the next seven years in a 
row.[88] The fire sale and subsequent cellar seasons earned Mack and the 
A's tremendous acrimony among Philadelphia fans.[89] Mack launched a rebuilding 
program in the mid-1920s, and his effort became "The Second Dynasty",[90] 
which culminated in back-to-back-to-back AL pennants in 1929, 1930 and 
1931.[88] It was an ill-timed hegemony, though: the Wall Street Crash of 
1929 triggered the Great Depression, and hard times caused baseball attendance 
to plummet, winners or no.[91] By October 1932, the second great sell-off, 
of The Second Dynasty, was underway; by 1935, the stars were gone and the 
franchise had picked up $545,000 cash for itself.[91] The A's had won the 
last of their pennants (and would not go to the postseason again until 
1971, when they were in Oakland), and goodwill with the fan base was in 
short supply indeed. The highs and lows of the A's were matched by those 
of the Phillies – except for most of the highs.[92] As mentioned above, 
their first decade at Shibe saw the end of one of the longest streaks of 
futility in major league history – only one winning season from 1918 to 
1948. Their 1950 Whiz Kids team did win a pennant – the first for a Philadelphia 
team in 20 years. The 1964 Phillies came close to doing it again – until 
the infamous "Phold". On the other side of the spectrum, the 1961 team 
managed to set an enduring record, though: their 23-losses-in-a-row mark 
(from July 29–August 20) has yet to be bested.[93] In the very first game 
at Shibe Park, catcher Doc Powers of the Philadelphia Athletics is said 
by some to have suffered internal injuries after crashing into a wall to 
catch a foul pop-up. Powers did die two weeks later.[94] The Athletics 
participated in seven World Series during their tenure at the stadium: 
1910, 1911, 1913, 1914, 1929, 1930 and 1931. The hometown fans got to witness 
the A's clinch world titles at Shibe Park in 1911, 1929 and 1930.[95] The 
Phillies participated in one World Series during their tenure at the stadium, 
in 1950. They were swept by the New York Yankees.[96] The 1943 All-Star 
Game was the first of two that would be held at Shibe Park. The 1943 game 
was hosted by the Athletics, and the 1952 game by the Phillies. The 1943 
game was the second of three wartime All-Star Games that would be played 
at night. The American Leaguers won the game, 5–3.[97] The 1951 All-Star 
Game had originally been awarded to the Phillies. However, the city of 
Detroit was celebrating the 250th anniversary of its founding in 1701 and 
requested to host the year's All-Star Game. The 1951 game was moved to 
Briggs Stadium,[98] and the Phillies then hosted the 1952 Game. The home 
city was well represented on the All-Star teams. Phillies pitcher Curt 
Simmons started the game for the Nationals in front of the home crowd; 
Phillies shortstop Granny Hamner started and batted eighth; and A's pitcher 
Bobby Shantz pitched the fifth inning for the Americans and struck out 
Whitey Lockman, Jackie Robinson and Stan Musial in succession. It had rained 
all day, starting early in the morning and keeping both teams from pre-game 
warm ups. Rain delayed the first pitch by 20 minutes and eventually caused 
the game to be called after the fifth inning. The National Leaguers emerged 
with a then-rare All-Star victory for the Senior Circuit, 3-2.[99] In September 
1923, the A's had the misfortune of being no-hit twice in just four days, 
at home in Shibe Park. On the 4th, Yankees hurler Sam Jones was just one 
walk away from a perfect game when he no-hit the A's; four days later on 
the 7th, it was Boston's Howard Ehmke who was likewise a lone BB away from 
perfection.[100] In Game 4 of the 1929 World Series, the A's, down 8–0 
to the Chicago Cubs, scored ten runs in 7th inning to win. It was the highest 
score in a single inning and the biggest comeback in World Series history.[101][102] 
The game on May 16, 1939 was the first night game played in the American 
League. The Cleveland Indians beat the A's 8–3 in front of 15,000+ nocturnal 
fans.[101] On September 28, 1941, the last day of the season, Boston Red 
Sox left fielder Ted Williams went 6-for-8 in the doubleheader at Shibe 
Park to boost his batting average from .3995 to .406. The day before, Bosox 
manager Joe Cronin gave Williams the option of sitting out the final two 
games, because his .3995 average would round up to .400.[103] Williams 
walked the streets of Philadelphia that night, pondering; he decided the 
stat would be cheapened if he did sit out, so he played and went 6-for-8. 
His .406 average for 1941 was the last .400-plus average in the major leagues.[104] 
Over the years, four A's pitchers tossed no-hitters in Shibe Park: Chief 
Bender in 1910, Bullet Joe Bush in 1916, Dick Fowler in 1945 and Bill McCahan 
in 1947.[105] The ballpark was the site of some notable home run feats. 
On May 29, 1909, Frank "Home Run" Baker used his 52-ounce bat to hit the 
first home run in Shibe Park: 340 feet over the right field fence, off 
Boston's RHP Frank Arellanes, who had previously served him up a grand 
slam pitch in Boston on April 24.[106] Montreal Expos catcher John Bateman 
hit the last home run there on September 29, 1970, in the antepenultimate 
game played at the stadium.[107] Babe Ruth, who got his first hit as a 
Yankee at Shibe Park on April 14, 1920,[104] hit a blast to deep left-center 
on September 9, 1921, that cleared the then-single bleacher stand, went 
across the street, and hit a tree over 500 feet away. On May 21, 1930, 
Ruth hit one to right field over the 12-foot wall that landed in Opal Street, 
the alley behind the second row of houses, again over 500 feet distant 
and said to be the longest ever home run hit at Shibe Park.[108] The longest 
strike ever hit there is said to be Ted Williams's prodigious foul ball 
blast that cleared the high roof at the right field line, passed over 20th, 
over Opal, over Garnet, and came down on 19th Street.[109] On June 3, 1932, 
Lou Gehrig hit four homers in one game.[110] He hit two to the left field 
bleachers, two over the right field wall, and had a shot at a fifth homer 
with a deep fly to center, but center fielder Al Simmons snared it on a 
running catch.[111] A's slugger Jimmie Foxx was also known for tape-measure 
blasts, especially during 1932 when he hit 58 home runs and challenged 
Ruth's season record of 60.[112] Foxx was the all-time home run hitter 
at Shibe Park, with 195 round-trippers between 1927 and 1945.[113] On May 
24, 1936, New York Yankees second baseman Tony Lazzeri hit two grand slams 
– one in the second off George Turbeville, one in the fifth off Herman 
Fink – and a solo shot in the seventh off Woody Upchurch, setting a single 
game RBI record of 11 (he also hit a 2-RBI triple). The Yanks prevailed, 
25–2.[114] Yankee sluggers set the record for home runs hit in a doubleheader 
when they visited Shibe Park on June 28, 1939. Tommy Henrich, Bill Dickey, 
George Selkirk and Frankie Crosetti hit one each and Joe Gordon, Babe Dahlgren 
and Joe DiMaggio all hit three. Total: 13 round-trippers. The Yanks won 
both ends, 23–2 and 10–0.[115] On June 2, 1949, the Phillies hit five home 
runs in the 8th inning: Del Ennis, Willie Jones and Schoolboy Rowe each 
smacked one and Andy Seminick hit two off Cincinnati Reds pitchers Ken 
Raffensberger, Jess Dobernic and Kent Peterson in a 12–3 win.[116] In later 
years, Dick Allen hit some booming drives over the roof of the double-decked 
bleachers, in the general direction of the 1921 Ruthian shot. He also cleared 
the big scoreboard in right-center field. Despite his hitting prowess, 
Allen was unpopular with the fans, and fellow long-ball hitter Willie Stargell 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates joked that the reason Allen was booed at home 
was that he hit his long drives clear out of the stadium: "When he hits 
a homer, there's no souvenir."[117] The single most famous home run hit 
at Shibe Park may be the one that stayed inside the park, in Game 4 of 
the 1929 World Series vs. the Chicago Cubs. Mule Haas of the A's hit a 
deep fly to center field which Hack Wilson of the Cubs lost in the sun. 
It landed behind him and rolled toward the center field corner, nearly 
470 feet from home plate. As Wilson tried to chase down the ball, Haas 
circled the bases. The A's scored a total of 10 runs in that inning, and 
went on to defeat the Cubs in the Series.[118] Shibe Park hosted its first 
Negro League games in 1919 when the Hilldale Club and Bacharach Giants 
played home games at the ballpark.[119] Games between white major league 
teams and Negro League teams were not uncommon. The Bacharach Giants hosted 
an exhibition game at Shibe Park against John McGraw's New York Giants 
on October 6, 1919.[120] Shibe Park was a neutral site venue for Negro 
League World Series games. The Cleveland Buckeyes defeated the Homestead 
Grays, 5-0, on September 20, 1945, to win game four and sweep the Series, 
four games to zero. Cleveland's Frank Carswell defeated Homestead's Ray 
Brown.[121] The Negro League Philadelphia Stars played home games at Shibe 
Park in the 1940s. The team's usual home field, at 44th and Parkside seated 
approximately 6,000 fans; the Stars were able to draw between 10,000 and 
12,000 to Shibe Park. They often played double-headers on Monday nights 
which was a travel day for the major league clubs. Former Stars player 
Gene Benson would later recall the team playing about twenty games per 
season at Shibe Park. The Stars would dress in the A's locker room.[122] 
The Stars drew their largest crowd on June 21, 1943 when they beat the 
Kansas City Monarchs in front of 24,165.[123] Shibe Park hosted the Frankford 
Yellow Jackets against the Chicago Bears on December 5, 1925 and the Yellow 
Jackets against the Bears on December 4, 1926. It also served as the site 
of two AFL games in 1926, the Philadelphia Quakers against the Los Angeles 
Wildcats on November 20, 1926 and the Quakers against the New York Yankees 
on November 27, 1926. The stadium hosted the December 12, 1925, Pottsville 
Maroons–Notre Dame All-Stars game. The Maroons' NFL franchise was suspended 
as a result of the team's participation in that contest, costing Pottsville 
the 1925 NFL championship.[124] The National Football League's Philadelphia 
Eagles moved to Shibe Park in 1940 and played their home games at the stadium 
through 1957. To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, 
management set up stands in right field, parallel to Twentieth Street. 
Some twenty feet high, these "east stands" had twenty-two rows of seats. 
The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered 
east stands enlarged capacity of Shibe Park to over thirty-nine thousand, 
but the Eagles rarely drew more than twenty-five to thirty thousand.[125] 
The Eagles played the 1948 NFL Championship Game in a blizzard; the home 
team defeated the Chicago Cardinals 7–0, the only score being a Steve Van 
Buren touchdown. The Eagles left Connie Mack Stadium after the 1957 season 
for Franklin Field. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles 
whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.[126] Shibe scion Jack briefly 
tried his hand as a boxing promoter in the early 1910s, shortly after his 
father built Shibe Park,[127] and although he did not pursue the career, 
he did make the acquaintance of other promoters in the Philadelphia boxing 
world, including Bob Gunnis and Herman "Muggsy" Taylor. Gunnis and Taylor 
became among the first promoters to book a bout into a major league baseball 
stadium when they brought Johnny Dundee vs. George Chaney to Shibe Park 
in July 1917, and although the fight itself was unremarkable, the concept 
propelled Gunnis and Taylor to the forefront of their trade.[127] Over 
the next forty years, perhaps a hundred boxing cards took place at Shibe,[128] 
some of them big-time pairings and even championship bouts.[129] Benny 
Leonard retained his championship against challenger Johnny Kilbane in 
1917, and 1928's Benny Bass vs. Harry Blitman was said by sportswriters 
to be the best featherweight bout in the city's history.[130] In the 1950s, 
Gil Turner, Ike Williams, Charley Fusari and many other top fighters fought 
important bouts at Shibe Park.[130] At first, groundskeepers set the ring 
up over the pitcher's mound, but soon this changed to the area over home 
plate with the baseball backstops dismantled; spectators sat in the main 
grandstand for the fight. Even before the installation of the light towers 
in 1939, staging night boxing was easy because of the vastly smaller area 
that needed to be lit –portable searchlights did the trick.[130] In October 
1948, the US national soccer team played three international friendlies 
against the Israel national team. The first game was played at the Polo 
Grounds and the last at Ebbets Field. In the middle match on October 17, 
the US beat Israel at Shibe Park, shutting them out 4–0 before 30,000 fans.[131] 
The events were not always sports-related: the 30-some-thousand seats were 
a good venue for political rallies. In 1940, Republican presidential candidate 
Wendell Willkie came to Shibe for a speech and rally. Four years later, 
the man who beat Willkie, Franklin D. Roosevelt, made one of his few 1944 
public appearances at 21st and Lehigh; he won again. In 1948, third-party 
Progressive candidate Henry A. Wallace made his nomination acceptance speech 
there.[132] Promoters tried jazz concerts in 1959, but the place was deemed 
"not intimate enough" for jazz.[133] The rodeo came in 1962, but hooves 
proved too destructive of the turf.[133] The Ringling Brothers circus set 
up shop at Shibe in 1955 when they were denied occupancy at all their regular 
Philadelphia venues, and evangelist Billy Graham had many successful crusades 
there. The stadium management's favorite visitors were the Jehovah's Witnesses, 
"because the Witnesses left the park immaculate."[132] The Shibe Park turnstiles 
registered some 47 million[134] clicks over 62 seasons of baseball. The 
Phillies were first to break the million mark for a season in 1946 with 
a team that was a "harbinger of the Whiz Kids."[46] The star-crossed 1964 
Phillies drew the highest single-season attendance with 1,425,891 in that 
infamous year; the Athletics' best-attended season was 1948, when they 
drew 945,076 fans.[135] The largest single-day baseball crowd came on May 
11, 1947, when Jackie Robinson made his Philadelphia debut; the Phillies 
beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in both ends of their doubleheader that day as 
41,660 looked on. The Athletics' best single-day turnout was also for a 
doubleheader, with the Washington Senators, on August 3, 1931, as the Second 
Dynasty team was closing in on its third AL pennant in a row; they swept 
both games before a crowd of 38,800-plus.[136] Low-ebb seasons were the 
Phillies' 1940 turnout of 207,177 and the Athletics' turnout of 146,223 
in 1915,[135] the year after Connie Mack sold off the stars from his 1914 
pennant-winning team.[137] In March 1971, bankrupt Jerry Wolman – who had 
had to sell the Eagles in 1969 – agreed in principle to sell the Connie 
Mack Stadium property to Louis Graboyes and S. Solis Tollin.[138] Without 
any permanent tenants for the stadium, Wolman had found himself unable 
to meet mortgage payments on it.[139] The sale to Graboyes and Tollin, 
however, was never closed. On August 20, 1971, the Connie Mack statue was 
re-dedicated at Veterans Stadium. That same day, while an evangelical revival 
group was setting up its tent, two stepbrothers, aged 9 and 12, sneaked 
into the park and started a small fire[140] that grew into a 5-alarmer, 
burning through much of the original upper deck, collapsing the roof and 
leaving twisted steel supports visible from the streets.[141] Ironically, 
the collapse of the overbloated roof restored much of the balanced grandeur 
of the original design. The park remained that way for four years, slowly 
deteriorating and becoming increasingly hazardous. Squatters took up revolving 
residence, and trash and debris accumulated; small trees took root and 
flourished, while the once-manicured emerald turf became unruly knee-high 
stalks.[142] In October 1975, Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Ned 
Hirsh ordered what remained of the stadium razed.[143] The corner tower 
and its domed cupola, Connie Mack's original office, was the last segment 
of the ballpark demolished, on July 13, 1976.[144] The demolition on July 
13, 1976 was the same day as the 47th MLB All-Star Game played at Veterans 
Stadium in South Philly. Although Wolman was in default on the mortgage 
and there were many liens against the property – the most recent being 
the $100,000+ demolition tab from Geppert Brothers – he continued to own 
it until 1981, when he sold it to Deliverance Evangelistic Church, a nondenominational 
evangelical Christian congregation.[145][146] In 1991, the church began 
constructing a 5,100-seat sanctuary on the site,[147] which was completed 
a year later, and formally dedicated on August 30, 1992.[148] Shibe Park's 
rooftop bleachers became one of the inspirations for a special seating 
area in Citizens Bank Park when it opened in 2004. Of their "Rooftop Bleacher 
Seats", the Phillies announced, "The Phillies are bringing back rooftop 
bleacher seats, a Shibe Park phenomenon of the 1920s when residents of 
20th Street built bleacher seats on top of their roofs. The seats are located 
on top of the buildings along Ashburn Alley."[149] Shibe Park was one of 
10 historic ballparks celebrated on the USPS 34-cent Commemorative issue 
stamps, "Baseball's Legendary Playing Fields", released June 27, 2001. 
The reverse of the Shibe Park stamp reads, "The first Major League Baseball 
concrete-and-steel stadium, Philadelphia's Shibe Park featured a 34-foot-high 
right field wall, as well as a façade with stately columns and a French 
Renaissance cupola."[150] In 2009, the Philadelphia Brewing Co. released 
an ale named "Fleur de Lehigh", which features Shibe Park on the label.[151]
