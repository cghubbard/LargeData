Harold Arthur Peck (April 20, 1917 – April 13, 1995) was an American professional 
baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a right fielder 
from 1943 to 1949, as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Philadelphia Athletics, 
and Cleveland Indians. He appeared in the 1948 World Series while a member 
of the Indians. Peck reached MLB despite losing two toes in a shooting 
accident. In 1937, Peck's father-in-law arranged for a tryout with the 
Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association.[1] The Brewers signed Peck, 
and sent him to play for the Hopkinsville Hoppers of the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee 
League in 1938 and the Bloomington Bloomers of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa 
League in 1939.[2] He then joined Milwaukee for the 1940 season, and became 
recognized as a top prospect by Major League Baseball teams. Bill Veeck, 
the owner of the Brewers, identified Peck as his favorite player.[3] The 
Brewers attempted to sell Peck to the Chicago White Sox in 1942. Peck lost 
two toes from his left foot that year due to a shooting accident, when 
attempting to shoot rats on his farm,[3] which ended the White Sox attempt 
to purchase Peck. The Brooklyn Dodgers gave Peck a brief trial in 1943, 
but he missed the majority of the season recovering from his foot injury.[3] 
The Chicago Cubs claimed Peck on waivers, and sold him to Milwaukee. Peck 
returned to the Brewers in the 1944 season,[4] and demonstrated that he 
could still play by recording a .345 batting average with 18 stolen bases. 
The Philadelphia Athletics purchased Peck from the Brewers in August 1944.[2] 
They sold Peck to the New York Yankees in 1946,[5] but he did not appear 
in a game for them. The Indians, now owned by Veeck, acquired Peck, Gene 
Bearden, and Al Gettel from the Yankees in exchange for Sherm Lollar and 
Ray Mack after the 1946 season.[6] Peck platooned in right field for the 
Indians, and led the American League in pinch hits in 1948, as the Indians 
won the 1948 World Series. Peck received less playing time in 1949, and 
he retired at the end of the season.[3] Peck was born in Big Bend, Wisconsin.
