Christopher B. Coghlan (pronounced KAHG-lihn; born June 18, 1985) is an 
American professional baseball utility player who is a free agent. He has 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Miami Marlins, Oakland Athletics 
and Chicago Cubs. Coghlan was the National League Rookie of the Year in 
2009. While primarily a left fielder throughout his career, he has experience 
at every position except shortstop, as well as pitcher and catcher. Coghlan 
attended East Lake High School in Tarpon Springs, Florida. He was selected 
by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 18th round (546th overall) of the 2003 
Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign, choosing instead to attend 
the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) to play college baseball for the 
Ole Miss Rebels. In 2004, Coghlan started 54 games at third base and made 
the Southeastern Conference (SEC) All-Freshman team. He was named to the 
All-SEC second team in 2005. In 2006, he was a first-team All-SEC and third-team 
All-American selection.[1] Coghlan was selected by the Florida Marlins 
in the first round (36th overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft, 
and signed. After joining the Marlins organization, Coghlan played for 
the Gulf Coast Marlins (Rookie level), the Jamestown Jammers (Low-A), the 
Greensboro Grasshoppers (A), the Jupiter Hammerheads (High-A), the Carolina 
Mudcats (Double-A) and the New Orleans Zephyrs (Triple-A). Much of his 
time in the minors was spent switching positions from his college position 
of third base to second base and eventually left field when called up to 
the Florida Marlins.[2] Coghlan made his major league debut on May 8, 2009. 
On August 9, 2009, he set the Marlins team record for consecutive multi-hit 
games at eight. Coghlan had 41 hits in August 2009, the most for a rookie 
since Todd Helton hit 45 in August 1998, earning him Rookie of the Month 
honors. He then followed with 50 hits in September/October 2009, the first 
rookie with back to back 40+ hit months, and the first player to do so 
since Ichiro Suzuki in 2004. His .321 batting average was 6th in NL among 
all players and 1st among all rookies. After the MLB All-Star break, Coghlan 
led all major league players in batting average (.372) and hits (113). 
His overall performance earned him the National League Rookie of the Year 
Award on November 16, 2009.[3] In April 2012, Coghlan was sent down to 
New Orleans, with Bryan Petersen being recalled to take his place. Coghlan 
was hitting .121 with a .299 OPS and 2 RBI in Miami. In May 2012, Coghlan 
and Donovan Solano were called up by the Marlins after Emillio Bonifacio 
was placed on the disabled list with a thumb injury. He started the same 
day against the Cleveland Indians going 0-4 with an RBI. In June 2012, 
Coghlan was sent down for a second time to the New Orleans Zephyrs to make 
room for Scott Cousins. After the 2013 season, Coghlan was non-tendered 
by Miami, becoming a free agent.[4] In January 2014, Coghlan signed a minor 
league deal including a spring training invitation with the Chicago Cubs. 
On May 3, the Cubs selected his contract from the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. He 
played in 125 games with the Cubs, switching between left and center field, 
with 385 at bats, hitting .283 with 9 home runs and 41 RBI's. He was most 
often used as a leadoff hitter and had an on-base percentage (OBP) of .352. 
On February 25, 2016, the Cubs traded Coghlan to the Oakland Athletics 
for right-handed pitcher Aaron Brooks.[5] While with the A's Coghlan batted 
.146.[6] On June 9, 2016, the Athletics traded Coghlan to the Cubs for 
Arismendy Alc√°ntara.[7] Coghlan played 48 games with the Cubs to finish 
2016, batting .252 with a home run and 16 RBI. Overall in 2016, combined 
with both teams, Coghlan played 99 total games with a .188 average, six 
home runs, and 30 RBI. The Cubs finished the season with a 103-58 record, 
clinching the NL Central division. The Cubs would eventually win the World 
Series over the Cleveland Indians, effectively ending their 108-year long 
drought.[8] Coghlan married former The Bachelor season 14 contestant Corrie 
Adamson in 2011.[9] His father Tim was killed in a traffic accident on 
June 5, 2001.[10] His entrance music is the same as Stone Cold Steve Austin
