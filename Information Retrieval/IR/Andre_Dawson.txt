Andre Nolan Dawson (born July 10, 1954), nicknamed "The Hawk" and "Awesome 
Dawson",[1][2][3] is a former American professional baseball player. During 
a 21-year baseball career, he played for four different teams as a center 
and right fielder, spending most of his career with the Montreal Expos 
(1976–1986) and Chicago Cubs (1987–1992). An 8-time National League (NL) 
All-Star, he was named the league's Rookie of the Year in 1977 after batting 
.282 with 19 home runs and 65 runs batted in (RBI), and won the Most Valuable 
Player Award in 1987 after leading the league with 49 homers and 137 RBI; 
he had been runner-up for the award in both 1981 and 1983. He batted .300 
five times, drove in 100 runs four times and had 13 seasons of 20 home 
runs. A strong baserunner early in his career, he also stole 30 bases three 
times. He is one of eight MLB players with at least 300 home runs and 300 
stolen bases during his career. Dawson was a center fielder until knee 
problems – worsened by the artificial surface at Olympic Stadium – forced 
his shift to right field, followed by his move to a team which played on 
grass. He led the NL in outfield putouts three consecutive years (1981–1983), 
and won eight Gold Glove Awards for fielding excellence. Upon his retirement, 
his NL totals of 409 home runs and 962 extra base hits both ranked tenth 
in league history; he also ranked seventh in NL history in games as an 
outfielder (2,303), and sixth in both outfield putouts (5,116) and total 
chances (5,366). He set Expos franchise records for career games, at bats, 
runs scored, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, runs batted in, extra base 
hits, total bases and steals, all of which have since been broken variously 
by Tim Raines, Tim Wallach and Vladimir Guerrero. Dawson was inducted into 
the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 2010.[4][5] Dawson was selected by 
the Expos in the 11th round (pick #250) of the 1975 Major League Baseball 
draft. He played in 24 major league games in 1976 after making his debut 
on September 11. His stardom rose in 1977 when he became an everyday outfielder 
for the Expos, and batted .282 with 19 home runs and 21 stolen bases. He 
was awarded the 1977 Rookie of the Year in the National League, narrowly 
beating out Steve Henderson of the New York Mets.[5] Dawson had a blend 
of power and speed, hitting at least 20 home runs in his seven seasons 
with the Expos, and stealing at least 20 bases in seven seasons. Dawson, 
playing primarily center field for the Expos, also became an excellent 
defensive player, gaining his first of eight Gold Glove Awards in 1980. 
Based on his all-around excellence, Dawson was second in the National League 
MVP voting in 1981 (won by Mike Schmidt) and second again in 1983 (won 
by Dale Murphy). He was voted the Montreal Expos Player of the Year in 
1981 and 1983. Dawson played 1,443 games with the Expos, fourth highest 
in franchise history. As an Expo, Dawson set single-season club records 
for home runs (32, now seventh), RBI (113, now fourth), extra base hits 
(78, now seventh), and sacrifice flies (18, still first). He still holds 
the Expos career record for sacrifice flies (71), and is the only player 
to hit 200 home runs and steal 200 bases with Montreal. During his Expo 
days, Dawson hit two home runs in the same inning twice: at Atlanta–Fulton 
County Stadium against the Atlanta Braves on July 30, 1978 [6] and at Wrigley 
Field against his future team, the Chicago Cubs, on September 24, 1985.[7] 
As of 2014, Dawson, Willie McCovey and Jeff King are the only three players 
who had hit two home runs in one inning twice. In 1984 Dawson appeared 
in The Cap, a short film about a young boy living in Montreal that was 
given a baseball cap by Dawson. Dawson played for the Expos until after 
the 1986 season when he became a free agent and sought a team whose home 
field had natural grass, as his knee injuries were aggravated by Olympic 
Stadium's artificial turf.[8] However, due to collusion on the part of 
the Major League Baseball owners, he was unable to attract offers.[9] Dawson 
campaigned for the Cubs to sign him during the offseason, but general manager 
Dallas Green resisted, insisting that the Cubs would start Brian Dayett 
in right field (Dawson had moved from center field to right field in his 
final two seasons as an Expo, due to the condition of his knees), and that 
one player could not make a 71-91 team a 91-71 team. When the Cubs opened 
camp in Mesa, Arizona that spring, Dawson and his agent Dick Moss arrived 
with a signed blank contract in an attempt to secure a contract with the 
Cubs. Dawson and Moss' stunt was derided as a "dog and pony show" by Green. 
After reviewing the contract, Green reached an agreement with Moss on a 
salary of $500,000, second-lowest on the team among regulars, and added 
bonuses of $150,000 if he did not go on the disabled list by the All-Star 
Game break and $50,000 if he made the All-Star team. He earned both. Interestingly, 
the team also wrote in $100,000 bonuses if Dawson was MVP of either the 
league championship series or the World Series, but did not add a clause 
for National League MVP. While he won the NL MVP, the Cubs did not make 
the playoffs, so he had no chance to earn the NLCS or World Series MVP.[5][10] 
[11] He became the Cubs' starting right fielder, and hit a major league 
leading 49 home runs (equal with Oakland Athletics rookie Mark McGwire) 
and was named the league's MVP, finally winning after the two years as 
runner-up in Montreal. Nonetheless, Dawson wasn't able to turn around the 
Cubs' fortunes: although the team held first place for nearly half of May 
and remained in contention through July, the Cubs finished the 1987 season 
at 76-85, last in the National League East.[12] Dawson was the first player 
to ever win a league MVP trophy from a last place team.[13] Dawson played 
five more seasons with the Cubs, and was one of the franchise's most popular 
players during that time. His worst individual season came in 1989, when 
the Cubs won the National League East title. Then, during the NL Championship 
Series, Dawson slumped terribly, hitting .105 as the San Francisco Giants 
beat the Cubs 4 games to 1. Dawson's .507 career slugging percentage with 
the Cubs is fourth highest in team history. In October 1992 the Red Sox 
signed Dawson as a free agent.[14] Dawson hit his 400th career home run 
with the Red Sox on April 15 at Fenway Park. Dawson sustained a knee injury 
early in the 1993 season in a game against the Texas Rangers which limited 
him to only 121 games in his first year with the Red Sox: "I got caught 
between sliding and standing up on a passed ball. I was on second base, 
and I took a chop step between strides and hit the corner of the third-base 
bag. I had knee surgery and [Boston] decided to use me in the DH role."[14] 
Dawson would have knee surgery the following year as well, and only managed 
to play 75 games in his second and final season with Boston. Dawson played 
his last two years with the Florida Marlins, where he played sparingly, 
retiring after the 1996 season. In his final game, Dawson was removed from 
the field as a final farewell to the fans and the game. The fans gave him 
a standing ovation as Dawson walked off the field. He returned to the Marlins 
shortly thereafter when he accepted a position in the team's front office, 
where Dawson got his first World Series ring in 2003. He currently works 
in the Marlins organization. Dawson also owns The Mahogany Grille, a soul 
food restaurant in Miami Gardens, Florida. Dawson regularly attends Chicago 
Cubs functions since his retirement, and is a fan favorite. Dawson is currently 
appearing in a "Discount Double-Check" commercial for State Farm Insurance 
that features former Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood. Dawson released his autobiography 
"If You Love This Game: An MVP's Life in Baseball" in May 2012. Dawson 
finished his career with 2,774 hits, 438 home runs, 314 stolen bases, and 
1,591 RBI. He is one of only eight players in major league history to record 
over 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases in his career (300-300 club); the 
other players to accomplish this are Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds, 
Reggie Sanders, Steve Finley, Alex Rodriguez and Carlos Beltrán. Dawson 
is also one of only five members of the 400 HR-300 SB club, along with 
Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Alex Rodriguez, and Carlos Beltrán. In 1997, 
Dawson's #10 was retired by the Montreal Expos in his honor (the number 
had been previously retired for Rusty Staub). After the franchise moved 
to Washington, the Montreal Canadiens raised a banner in the Bell Centre 
to commemorate all of the retired Expos numbers, including Dawson's. In 
2010 the Washington Nationals franchise placed Dawson in its "Ring of Honor" 
at Nationals Park. Dawson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010, 
his ninth year of eligibility, rising from an initial vote total of 45.3% 
in 2002 to 77.9% in 2010.[4][5][15] Dawson's Hall of Fame plaque depicts 
him with a Montreal Expos cap.[16][17] The major impediments to Dawson's 
election to the Hall of Fame had been his ordinary career .323 on-base 
percentage, his statistics being diminished in stature by sluggers who 
played after him in the steroid era,[citation needed] and never playing 
in a World Series. Cubs teammate Ryne Sandberg campaigned for Dawson's 
induction during his speech at his own Hall of Fame induction ceremony 
in 2005: "No player in baseball history worked harder, suffered more or 
did it better than Andre Dawson. He's the best I've ever seen. I watched 
him win an MVP for a last-place team in 1987 [with the Cubs], and it was 
the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in baseball. He did it the right 
way, the natural way, and he did it in the field and on the bases and in 
every way, and I hope he will stand up here someday."[18] Andre Dawson 
was the second player in the Hall of Fame whose plaque depicts him with 
an Expos logo, after Gary Carter. Although Dawson had played the majority 
of his 21-year career with Montreal, he publicly expressed his disappointment 
with the decision, saying it was "a little gut-wrenching" to find out he 
would not go in as a Chicago Cub.[19] Dawson's reluctance to be enshrined 
as an Expo stemmed, in part, from the breakdown of his relationship with 
the team during MLB's collusion scandal of 1986–87, when he claims the 
team not only "threw him out" of Montreal, but tried to prevent other teams 
from signing him as a free agent.[20] While Dawson played only six years 
with the Cubs, five of his eight All-Star appearances were as a Cub, and 
his only MVP award came in his first year with the team in 1987.[16][17] 
The Hall noted that "Dawson had 1,575 of his 2,774 hits as an Expo, won 
six of his eight Gold Glove awards in Montreal and led the Expos to their 
only postseason series win".[17] Andre Dawson's nickname, "The Hawk", was 
given to him by an uncle at a very early age. Andre used to work out with 
a men's team that would hit him ground balls at practice. Andre's uncle 
told him that most kids his age would shy away from the ball, but Andre
