Albert Walter "Sparky" Lyle (born July 22, 1944) is an American former 
left-handed relief pitcher who spent sixteen seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) from 1967 through 1982. He was a relief pitcher for the Boston Red 
Sox, New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Chicago 
White Sox. A three-time All-Star, he won the American League (AL) Cy Young 
Award in 1977. He led the American League (AL) in saves in 1972 and 1976. 
With the Yankees, Lyle was a member of the World Series champions in 1977 
and 1978, both over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Lyle co-authored, with Peter 
Golenbock, The Bronx Zoo, a 1979 tell-all book which chronicled the dissension 
within the Yankees in its World Series Championship seasons of 1977 and 
1978. From 1998–2012, Lyle served as manager of the Somerset Patriots, 
a minor league baseball team of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. 
Lyle was born in DuBois, Pennsylvania on July 22, 1944, but grew up in 
nearby Reynoldsville. His father was a carpenter and general contractor, 
and his mother a seamstress at a coffin factory. He attended Reynoldsville 
High School where he played varsity football and basketball. During the 
spring of his junior year, he began playing American Legion baseball for 
the DuBois team because neither his high school nor Reynoldsville fielded 
an organized baseball squad.[1][2] He once struck out 31 batters while 
pitching 14 of 17 innings in a state tournament game for DuBois. At the 
time, his pitching repertoire consisted of a fastball, curveball and changeup. 
He was brought in for a tryout with the Pittsburgh Pirates alongside Bruce 
Dal Canton. The Pirates only signed the latter after seeing that the speed 
of Lyle's pitches was no match for Dal Canton's.[2] Lyle did succeed in 
catching the attention of George Staller who was a scout for the Baltimore 
Orioles at the time. Lyle signed with the ballclub as an amateur free agent 
on June 17, 1964.[1] He spent the opening half of his first professional 
campaign in 1964 with the Bluefield Orioles. He appeared in seven games, 
three out of the bullpen. It was the first time he was used as a reliever, 
an idea which he suggested to manager Jim Frey. Later that season, he would 
earn a promotion to the Fox Cities Foxes, where he was used exclusively 
as a starting pitcher in six matches for the eventual Midwest League champions.[2][3][4] 
Lyle was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the first-year draft on November 
30, 1964.[1] He progressed up the Red Sox farm system as a relief pitcher, 
with stops in Winston-Salem in 1965, Pittsfield in 1966 and Toronto in 
the first half of 1967.[3] It was during his time at Pittsfield that he 
picked up the slider, a pitch that was introduced to him by Ted Williams 
at spring training prior to that season. Lyle recalled, "He told me it 
was the best pitch in baseball because it was the only pitch he couldn't 
hit even when he knew it was coming." The slider became the most successful 
pitch in his repertoire.[1][2] He was called up to Boston after Dennis 
Bennett was sold to the New York Mets on June 24, 1967.[1] Lyle pitched 
two scoreless innings to close out a 4–3 Red Sox loss to the California 
Angels in his major-league debut at Anaheim Stadium on July 4.[5] He recorded 
his first career save twelve days later on July 16 in Boston's 9–5 victory 
over the Detroit Tigers at Fenway Park.[6] His first win in the majors 
came on July 27 in the Red Sox's ten-inning 6–5 triumph at home over the 
Angels.[7] He ended his rookie campaign with 27 mound appearances, a 1–2 
record, five saves and a 2.28 earned run average (ERA).[8] He was left 
off Boston's World Series roster due to a sore arm.[1] He registered 64 
saves during the next four years, serving as the team's closer from 1969 
to 1971.[8] During spring training prior to the 1972 season on March 22, 
Lyle was traded to the New York Yankees for Danny Cater and a player to 
be named later (Mario Guerrero). The transaction eventually proved to be 
one-sided as Lyle became the Yankees' bullpen ace, establishing himself 
as one of the best relief pitchers of the 1970s. He played a major role 
in the Yankees capturing three straight pennants from 1976 to 1978 and 
winning the World Series in the last two of those years.[9] In 1972, he 
saved 35 games, an American League record at the time, and a major league 
record for left-handers; Ron Perranoski had set both marks in 1970, but 
John Hiller would surpass Lyle's total with 38 in 1973. In 1972, Lyle also 
became the first southpaw to collect 100 saves in the American League. 
He also finished 3rd in the 1972 MVP voting. He again led the league in 
saves in 1976, and in 1977 became the first AL reliever ever to win the 
Cy Young Award. He was named an American League All-Star in 1973, 1976 
and 1977. In 1976, he broke Hoyt Wilhelm's American League record of 154 
career saves, and the following year eclipsed Perranoski's major league 
mark for left-handers of 179 career saves. Through 1977, Lyle had compiled 
201 career saves, and was within range of Wilhelm's career big-league record 
of 227. Lyle was associated with a trademark song to herald his entry into 
games, Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 in D.[10] But despite the fact 
Lyle had won the 1977 Cy Young Award, the Yankees signed Goose Gossage 
as a free agent during the 1977 off-season, and Gossage followed with an 
outstanding 1978 season which made Lyle expendable. During the 1978 season, 
Yankees teammate Graig Nettles quipped that Lyle went "from Cy Young to 
sayonara."[11] On November 10, 1978, Lyle was part of a major trade that 
sent him, along with Mike Heath, Larry McCall, Dave Rajsich, Domingo Ramos 
and $400,000, to the Texas Rangers in exchange for Juan Beníquez, Mike 
Griffin, Paul Mirabella, Dave Righetti, and Greg Jemison. In his late 30s, 
Lyle was unable to duplicate the great success he had previously enjoyed 
(perhaps due to the strain of pitching over 100 innings six times from 
1969–78), and saved only 21 games for the Rangers in 1979–80. Rollie Fingers 
moved ahead of Lyle in career saves in early 1980, breaking Wilhelm's record 
just weeks before Lyle reached the mark, and Fingers eventually pushed 
the record beyond reach. On September 13, 1980, Lyle was traded to the 
Philadelphia Phillies for a player to be named later (Kevin Saucier).[12] 
Although the Phillies won their first World Series title in 1980, Lyle 
did not appear in the postseason, having been acquired by the Phillies 
too late to qualify for the postseason. On August 21, 1982, he was purchased 
by the Chicago White Sox from the Phillies. His last game was played on 
September 27 of that season for the White Sox, who released him on October 
12. Lyle finished his 16-year career with 238 saves, a 2.88 ERA, and a 
record of 99–76 in 899 games pitched — all in relief. In 1985, Fingers 
broke his American League record for career saves; and in 1991 Righetti 
surpassed Lyle's major-league record for career saves by a left-hander, 
though Lyle still holds the AL mark of 232. In 1998, he became the first 
manager of the Somerset Patriots, a minor league team based in Bridgewater, 
New Jersey. He managed the team to Atlantic League pennants in 2001, 2003, 
2005, 2008 and 2009, and was the Patriots' manager until Nov 27, 2012 when 
he became Manager Emeritus.[13] His number 28 that he wore with the Patriots 
was retired on June 14, 2014 [14] A noted clubhouse prankster in his playing 
days, Lyle was known for sneaking into the locker room during games to 
sit naked on birthday cakes prepared for teammates, leaving the imprint 
of his posterior on the frosting.[15] In his autobiography, Lyle noted 
that teammate Ron Swoboda turned the tables on him by defecating on a cake 
which was then delivered to Lyle; Lyle said the reason why he eventually 
stopped his cake sitting was because of the notoriety he gained from doing 
it, thinking that someone might try to "put a needle in the cake" to hurt
