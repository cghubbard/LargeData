-73.985722 Washington Park was the name given to three major league Baseball 
parks on two different sites in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, 
New York, located at Third Street and Fourth Avenue. The first two sites 
were diagonally opposite each other at that intersection. The third site 
was the same as the second site. The first Washington Park was bounded 
by Third and Fifth Streets, and Fourth and Fifth Avenues. The property 
contained an old building then called the Gowanus House, which stands today, 
albeit largely reconstructed. Known today as the Old Stone House, it was 
used as an impromptu headquarters by General George Washington during the 
Battle of Long Island, during a delaying action by 400 Maryland troops 
against approximately 2000 British and Hessian troops that allowed a good 
portion of the Continental Army to retreat to fortified positions on Brooklyn 
Heights. Those events inspired the ballpark's name. The ballpark was the 
home of the Brooklyn baseball club during 1883–1891, with a slight interruption 
by a destructive fire during the 1889 season. The team, then called the 
"Atlantics", had started in a minor league in 1883, joined the then-major 
American Association in 1884, and then switched to the National League 
in 1890. Streetcar (trolley) tracks ran near the ballpark, inspiring the 
one of the team's many nicknames that ultimately stuck: Trolley Dodgers.[1] 
In 1891, the team split its time between Washington Park and a newer facility 
called Eastern Park in Brownsville, moving there full-time in 1892. That 
might have seemed like a good idea at the time, but the park was a little 
too "eastern" for the fans' convenience, and was abandoned after six poorly 
attended seasons. The second Washington Park[2] was bounded by First and 
Third Streets, and Third and Fourth Avenues. It was located at 40°40′30″N 
73°59′10″W﻿ / ﻿40.67500°N 73.98611°W﻿ / 40.67500; -73.98611. The park sat 
18,800. It consisted of a covered grandstand behind the infield and uncovered 
stand down the right field line. The Brooklyn National Leaguers, by then 
often called the "Superbas" as well as the "Dodgers", moved into this new 
ballpark in 1898, where they would play for the next 15 seasons. On April 
30, 1898, the Dodgers played their first game at new Washington Park and 
15,000 fans attended. One of the more unusual features of the Park was 
the aroma from nearby factories and Gowanus Canal, which was a block away 
and curled around two sides of the ballpark.[3] Meanwhile, owner Charlie 
Ebbets slowly invested in the individual lots on a larger piece of property 
in Flatbush, which would become the site of Ebbets Field once he had the 
entire block. So in 1913, the Dodgers, at that time most often called the 
"Robins" for their manager Wilbert Robinson, abandoned Washington Park. 
The Brooklyn Tip-Tops or "BrookFeds" of the Federal League, the only major 
league team ever named for a loaf of bread, acquired the ballpark property 
in 1914, then rebuilt the second Washington Park in steel and concrete. 
The old park took on a modern appearance; in fact, it was nearly a duplicate 
of the initial version of another Federal League park in Chicago that would 
become Wrigley Field. However, with the Dodgers in a new and somewhat more 
spacious steel-and-concrete home already, Ebbets Field, there was no long-term 
need for Washington Park, so it was abandoned for the final time after 
the Federal League ended its two-year run. Part of the left center field 
wall of this final Washington Park still stands on the east side of 3rd 
Avenue, south of 1st Street, as part of a Con Edison yard.[5][6] (The Second
