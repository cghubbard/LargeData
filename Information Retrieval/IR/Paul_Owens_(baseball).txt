As player As general manager As manager Paul Francis Owens (February 7, 
1924 – December 26, 2003) was an American front office executive and manager 
in Major League Baseball. Owens' entire Major League career was spent with 
the Philadelphia Phillies. He was the general manager and principal architect 
of the 1980 Phillies, the third Philadelphia club to win a National League 
pennant and the first Phillies team to win a World Series—breaking a 97-year 
streak of futility dating to the team's founding in 1883. He was general 
manager of the Phillies from June 3, 1972, through the end of 1984, and 
twice (1972; 1983–84) added the title of field manager to his job description. 
In 1983 he took the managerial reins of the Phillies in midyear and led 
them to their fourth pennant, but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the 
1983 World Series. Nicknamed "The Pope" because of his resemblance to Pope 
Paul VI, [1] Owens was born in Salamanca, New York, and attended St. Bonaventure 
University. Owens' professional playing career began in 1951 at the relatively 
advanced age of 27. Prior to 1951, Owens had spent the first several years 
of his baseball career with the Salamanca Merchants (a still extant team) 
in what was then the Suburban League, the local Town Team Baseball circuit.[2] 
Owens played exclusively at the lower ends of the minor leagues, with his 
active career largely centered in his native upstate New York. A first 
baseman who batted and threw right-handed, he twice (1951, 1957) batted 
.407 with the Olean Oilers of the Class D PONY League (now the New York–Penn 
League) and set a league record by hitting safely in 38 consecutive games 
in 1951. During his relatively brief playing career, Owens compiled a lifetime 
average of .374. In 1955, Owens was named Olean's playing manager; the 
following year, the Oilers became a Phillies' affiliate and Owens moved 
into their organization. In 1958–59, he managed Class C Bakersfield of 
the California League. He then became a scout, and, in 1966, director of 
the entire Philadelphia farm system. On June 3, 1972, he replaced John 
Quinn as the Phillies' general manager. Then, five weeks later, on July 
10, Owens fired manager Frank Lucchesi and assumed that job as well, to 
get a closer (if temporary) look at the last-place Phillies' on-field struggles. 
He then returned to the front office and proceeded to turn the Phils into 
pennant contenders within three seasons. His farm system, one of the most 
productive in the game at the time, bore fruit—yielding players such as 
Mike Schmidt, Greg Luzinski, Bob Boone, Larry Bowa and Dick Ruthven. In 
addition, Owens aggressively swung trades to add missing pieces such as 
relief pitcher Tug McGraw and outfielders Garry Maddox and Bake McBride. 
The Phils won the NL East in 1976–1977–1978—each time falling short in 
the National League Championship Series. Owens thought he added the final 
piece in 1979 when he signed free agent Pete Rose, but the Phils stumbled 
and finished fourth. Finally, in 1980, under manager Dallas Green, the 
Phillies beat Houston in an intense NLCS and then defeated the Kansas City 
Royals for the team's first world championship. On July 18, 1983, Owens 
again decided to don a uniform and run the Phillies from the dugout as 
well as from the front office. He fired manager Pat Corrales—even though 
Philadelphia was in first place at the time, albeit just one game over 
.500—and led the club to 47 wins in 77 games. They then defeated the Los 
Angeles Dodgers in four games in the NLCS to win the Phillies' fourth pennant. 
During the World Series, the Phils lost to Baltimore in five games. Owens 
returned to managing in 1984, but the results were disappointing. The Phillies 
played only .500 ball and finished fourth, 15½ games behind the division 
champ Chicago Cubs. Owens was relieved of both his GM and managing jobs 
during the off-season, but remained with the Phillies as a senior advisor 
and special scout until his death, in 2003, at age 79 in Woodbury, New 
Jersey. For the 2004 season, the Phillies wore a patch on their right shoulder 
featuring a banner reading "Pope" in honor of Owens, and a shamrock in 
honor of former relief pitcher Tug McGraw, who had also died that winter.
