As coach Leo David Mazzone (born October 16, 1948) is a former pitcher 
in minor league baseball and pitching coach in Major League Baseball. He 
worked with the Atlanta Braves' organization from 1979 to 2005 and was 
the pitching coach for the Baltimore Orioles from 2006 to 2007. He is currently 
the Special Pitching Advisor for the Furman University Baseball program. 
Although Mazzone was born in West Virginia, his family lived on the other 
side of the Potomac River's north branch in Luke, Maryland. Growing up 
there, one of his friends was Sam Perlozzo of nearby Cumberland, Maryland, 
under whom Mazzone would eventually coach for the Baltimore Orioles. Mazzone 
was even the best man at Perlozzo's wedding.[citation needed] Mazzone made 
his professional debut in 1967 with the Medford Giants, a class-A farm 
team of the San Francisco Giants. In all, he played seven seasons in the 
Giants organization, reaching as high as the Double-A Amarillo Giants, 
for whom he played four seasons from 1970 to 1973. He played the next three 
seasons in the Oakland Athletics chain, reaching Triple-A with the Tucson 
Toros in 1975. In 1976, he was a player-manager for the class-A Corpus 
Christi Seagulls. He became their full-time manager the following season. 
Mazzone was the hot tempered manager for the Carolina League Kinston Eagles 
in 1978. It was the recommendation and contacts of Eagles owner Ray Kuhlman 
that proved instrumental in Atlanta deciding to take a chance on Mazzone 
in 1979.[citation needed] Mazzone has earned a reputation as one of the 
best pitching coaches of the modern era,[1] having molded Tom Glavine and 
John Smoltz into perennial All-stars. Greg Maddux also enjoyed his best 
seasons under Mazzone. During his time in Atlanta, Mazzone developed and 
coached some of the best pitching rotations in baseball history. [2] In 
2005, ESPN ranked the 1998 (#1) and the 1993 (#4) Atlanta Braves pitching 
staffs as two of the Top 10 rotations of all time. [3] This dominant pitching 
anchored the Braves' run of 14 consecutive division titles (1991-2005), 
5 National League pennants (1991-1992, 1995-1996, 1999) and the 1995 World 
Series championship. Between 1991 and 1998, three of his pitchers won a 
total of 6 Cy Young Awards: Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz have all been inducted 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Over the years, a number of other 
pitchers joined the Braves and enjoyed some of their finest seasons under 
Mazzone only to regress after leaving.[1] Mazzone's "accidental trademark" 
is his rocking back and forth while sitting in the dugout. On television 
broadcasts of Braves games, the camera would often show him rocking back 
and forth during the game.[1] Mazzone's pitching philosophies state that 
pitchers should throw more between starts (two sessions instead of one) 
and be able to throw strikes on the low and outside corner of the strike 
zone.[1] After the 2005 season Leo Mazzone took the Baltimore Orioles pitching 
coach job. On October 12, 2007 the Orioles fired Mazzone with one year 
left on his contract.[4] On August 30, 2016, Leo Mazzone was hired by Head 
Coach Brett Harker of the Furman University Baseball program as a Special 
Pitching advisor. He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1993. In his book The Baseball Economist, J.C. Bradbury 
titles a chapter, "How Good is Leo Mazzone?" Using statistical analysis, 
he analyzes whether Mazzone had a significant impact upon the pitchers 
that he coached. The sample is all pitchers who have pitched at least one 
year under Mazzone and one year under a different pitching coach. Bradbury 
found that Mazzone lowered the ERA of pitchers by an average of 0.64 points, 
and that after leaving Mazzone, pitchers' ERA increased by an average of 
0.78 points. Bradbury believes that such an impact is deserving of Hall 
of Fame consideration.[5] ESPN.com lists him number one on the list of 
"Top 10 Assistant Coaches of All-Time".[1] Currently, Mazzone works as 
a color commentator for Fox and as a co-host on "The Rude Awakening" Morning 
Show on Atlanta's WCNN-AM. On August 30, 2016, Mazzone was named Special 
Advisor to the Furman University (Greenville, SC) Baseball Program. He
