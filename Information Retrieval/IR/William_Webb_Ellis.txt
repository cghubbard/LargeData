Reverend William Webb Ellis (24 November 1806 – 24 January 1872) was a 
British Anglican clergyman and the alleged inventor of rugby football whilst 
a pupil at Rugby School. According to legend, Webb Ellis picked up the 
ball and ran with it during a school football match in 1823, thus creating 
the rugby-style of play. Although the story has become firmly entrenched 
in the sport's folklore, it is not supported by substantive evidence, and 
is discounted by most rugby historians as an origin myth. The William Webb 
Ellis Cup is presented to the winners of the Rugby World Cup.[1][2] Webb 
Ellis was born in Salford, Lancashire, the younger of two surviving sons 
(the eldest, James, died aged three; the second son, Thomas, of Dunchurch, 
Warwickshire, was a surgeon) of James Ellis, a cornet in the 7th Dragoon 
Guards, in 1809 made a Lieutenant of the 3rd Dragoon Guards, joining them 
in Portugal,[3] and Ann, daughter of William Webb, a surgeon, of Alton, 
Hampshire, whom James married in Exeter in 1804. His paternal grandfather 
was from Pontyclun in South Wales, a descendant of the Ellis family of 
Kiddal Hall, just off the A64 near Potterton, West Riding of Yorkshire.[3] 
After his father was killed during the Peninsular War in a cavalry action 
near Albuera on 1 July 1812,[4] Mrs Ellis, in receipt of an allowance of 
£30 from His Majesty's Royal Bounty in recognition of her husband's service,[5] 
decided to move to Rugby, Warwickshire, so that William and his older brother 
Thomas could receive an education at Rugby School with no cost as a local 
foundationer (i.e. a pupil living within a radius of 10 miles of the Rugby 
Clock Tower). He attended the school from 1816 to 1825 and was recorded 
as being a good scholar and cricketer, although it was noted that he was 
"rather inclined to take unfair advantage at cricket". The incident in 
which Webb Ellis supposedly caught the ball in his arms during a football 
match (which was allowed) and ran with it (which was not) is supposed to 
have happened in the latter half of 1823. After leaving Rugby in 1826, 
he went to Brasenose College, Oxford, aged 20. He played cricket for his 
college, and for Oxford University against Cambridge University in a first-class 
match in 1827.[6] He graduated with a BA in 1829 and received his MA in 
1831. He entered the Church and became chaplain of St George's Chapel, 
Albemarle Street, London (closed c.1909),[7] and then rector of St. Clement 
Danes in the Strand. He became well known as a low church evangelical clergyman. 
In 1855, he became rector of Magdalen Laver in Essex. A picture of him 
(the only known portrait) appeared in the Illustrated London News in 1854, 
after he gave a particularly stirring sermon on the subject of the Crimean 
War. He never married and died in the south of France in 1872, leaving 
an estate of £9,000, mostly to various charities. His grave in "le cimetière 
du vieux château" at Menton in Alpes Maritimes was rediscovered by Ross 
McWhirter in 1958 and has since been renovated by the French Rugby Federation. 
The sole source of the story of Webb Ellis picking up the ball originates 
with one Matthew Bloxam, a local antiquarian and former pupil of Rugby.[2] 
On 10 October 1876,[8] he wrote to The Meteor, the Rugby School magazine, 
that he had learnt from an unnamed source that the change from a kicking 
game to a handling game had "...originated with a town boy or foundationer 
of the name of Ellis, Webb Ellis". On 22 December 1880,[8] in another letter 
to the Meteor, Bloxam elaborates on the story: Bloxam's first account differed 
from his second one four years later. In his first letter, in 1876, Bloxham 
claimed that Webb Ellis committed the act in 1824, a time by which Webb 
Ellis had left Rugby.[8] In his second letter, in 1880, Bloxham put the 
year as 1823.[8] The claim that Webb Ellis invented the game did not surface 
until four years after his death, and doubts have been raised about the 
story since 1895, when the Old Rugbeian Society first investigated it. 
The sub-committee conducting the investigation was "unable to procure any 
first hand evidence of the occurrence".[9] Among those giving evidence, 
Thomas Harris and his brother John, who had left Rugby in 1828 and 1832 
respectively (i.e. after the alleged Webb Ellis incident) recalled that 
handling of the ball was strictly forbidden. Thomas Harris, who requested 
that he "not [be] quote[d] as an authority", testified that Webb Ellis 
had been known as someone to take an "unfair advantage at football".[9] 
John Harris, who would have been aged 10 years at the time of the alleged 
incident, did not claim to have been a witness to it. Additionally, he 
stated that he had not heard the story of Webb Ellis's creation of the 
game.[9] Thomas Hughes (author of Tom Brown's Schooldays) was asked to 
comment on the game as played when he attended the school (1834–1842). 
He is quoted as saying "In my first year, 1834, running with the ball to 
get a try by touching down within goal was not absolutely forbidden, but 
a jury of Rugby boys of that day would almost certainly have found a verdict 
of 'justifiable homicide' if a boy had been killed in running in." It has 
been suggested by Dunning and Sheard (2005) that it was no coincidence 
that this investigation was conducted in 1895, at a time when divisions 
within the sport led to the schism: the split into the sports of rugby 
league and rugby union.[2] Dunning and Sheard suggest that the endorsement 
of a "reductionist" origin myth by the Rugbeians was an attempt to assert 
their school's position and authority over a sport that they were losing 
control of.[2] An article by Gordon Rayner in the Sunday Telegraph[10][11] 
about the origin of Rugby football, says that Thomas Hughes told the 1895 
investigation that in 1838-1839 a Rugby School boy called Jem Mackie "was 
the first great runner-in", and that later (in or before 1842) Jem Mackie 
was expelled from Rugby School for an unspecified incident; in 1845 boys 
at the school first wrote down an agreed set of rules for the version of 
football played at Rugby School, which is now rugby football. Gordon Rayner 
says that the reason for Jem Mackie's expulsion may have damaged Mackie's 
reputation so much that Bloxam transferred Mackie's part in inventing Rugby 
football to Webb Ellis, and that a big donation by Bloxam to Rugby School's 
library may have influenced school official acceptance of this Webb Ellis 
version. A plaque, erected in 1895, at Rugby School bears the inscription:[2]
