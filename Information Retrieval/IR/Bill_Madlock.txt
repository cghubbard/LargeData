Bill "Mad Dog" Madlock, Jr. (born January 2, 1951) is a former Major League 
Baseball player. From 1973 to 1987, Madlock was a right-handed hitter who 
won four National League batting titles. His record of four batting titles 
as a third baseman would be eclipsed in 1988 by Wade Boggs. Since 1970, 
only Tony Gwynn has won more National League batting titles (eight). Madlock 
is also one of only three right-handed hitters to have won multiple National 
League batting titles since 1960, Roberto Clemente having also won four 
and Tommy Davis having won back-to-back titles in 1962 and 1963. Bill Madlock 
was born in Memphis, Tennessee, but grew up in Decatur, Illinois, where 
he graduated from Eisenhower High School.[1] His future wife Cynthia attended 
the same city's Stephen Decatur High School.[2] At Eisenhower High he played 
basketball, football and baseball. He received 150 scholarship offers for 
his skills as a basketball player,[3] around 100 for his skills as a football 
player [2] and two for his skills as a baseball player.[3] He accepted 
one of the two baseball scholarships, at Southwestern Iowa Community College 
in Keokuk, Iowa, because of his preference for playing a less hazardous 
game. His reasoning was clear from what he later told a Sports Illustrated 
reporter: "I didn't want to have 6'5", 250-pound guys bearing down on me, 
so I decided to play baseball."[2] He was considered for the baseball draft 
by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1969, but would not sign with the Cardinals 
for two reasons. The first was because he figured he would have a difficult 
time breaking into the majors as a shortstop given the abilities of the 
Cardinal shortstop at the time, Dal Maxvill. The second was the delay required 
by the birth of his daughter Sara in December 1969. By the time Madlock 
was ready to sign with a major league baseball team, he had decided to 
go with an offer from the Washington Senators organization.[2] While an 
active player with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1983, Madlock's three children, 
his daughter Sara and his older sons Stephen and Douglas, had earned the 
nickname "The Mad Puppies" around the Pirates clubhouse. Madlock's fourth 
child, his son Jeremy, was born in what was described as a "tense delivery" 
by Madlock, who witnessed it in the delivery room, in that same year.[2] 
In a 15-season career, Madlock, nicknamed "Mad Dog", compiled a .305 batting 
average with 2008 hits, 163 home runs and 860 runs batted in. Madlock was 
drafted by the Washington Senators in the 5th round of the secondary phase 
of the 1970 amateur draft. He made his debut with the Texas Rangers (who 
had moved from Washington after the 1971 season) on September 7, 1973, 
and played 21 games with them, batting .351. After the season, Madlock 
and Vic Harris were traded to the Cubs for Ferguson Jenkins. Madlock replaced 
Ron Santo as the Cubs' third baseman and hit .313, the highest average 
for a Cubs third baseman since Stan Hack batted .323 in 1945. In 1975 Madlock 
won his first batting title with a .354 average. On July 26 of that year 
he went 6-for-6 during a Cubs' loss to the New York Mets. He also made 
the first of his three All-Star appearances and shared Game MVP honors 
with Jon Matlack. In 1976 Madlock repeated as batting champion with a .339 
average, edging out Ken Griffey, Sr. of the Cincinnati Reds on the final 
day of the regular season (October 3, 1976). In an 8–2 win over the Montreal 
Expos, Madlock collected four singles to raise his average from .333 to 
.339, one point ahead of Griffey. Griffey belatedly entered his team's 
game (which the Reds won 11-1 over the Atlanta Braves), and went 0-for-2, 
dropping his average to .336. After the 1976 season, Madlock was traded 
to San Francisco in a deal that sent Bobby Murcer and Steve Ontiveros to 
the Cubs. Madlock, an average fielder at best, was moved to second base 
(the Giants already had Darrell Evans at third), and batted "only" .302 
and .309 in 1977 and 1978 respectively. In June 1979, the unhappy Madlock 
was traded to Pittsburgh and won a championship with a Pirates team with 
stars Dave Parker and Willie Stargell. Madlock returned to third base and 
batted .328 with the Pirates during the regular season and .375 in the 
World Series. In 1980 Madlock's average dropped to .277 as the Pirates 
finished third in the National League East, eight games behind the eventual 
World Champion Philadelphia Phillies. For Madlock, the season became infamous 
for an incident during a May 1 game against the Montreal Expos at Three 
Rivers Stadium. Madlock poked umpire Jerry Crawford in the face with his 
glove after being called out on strikes with the bases loaded. National 
League President Chub Feeney fined Madlock $5,000 and suspended him 15 
games. Madlock appealed the suspension and remained in uniform before finally 
serving the suspension on June 6, after National League umpires threatened 
to eject him from every game he tried to play in.[4] Madlock won two more 
batting titles, in 1981 and 1983, making him the first player to win multiple 
batting titles with two different teams. He also finished second in the 
National League in batting in 1982, his .319 average bettered only by Al 
Oliver's .331. Afterwards, however, his play mirrored the decline of the 
team. In August 1985 the Pirates traded him to Los Angeles which, like 
Pittsburgh in 1979, was contending for a division title. The Dodgers lost 
to the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS but Madlock hit three home runs 
in the loss. In 1987 the Dodgers traded Madlock to Detroit, where he again 
earned a trip to the postseason. Madlock became a free agent at the end 
of the 1987 season and played for the Lotte Orions in Japan in 1988. Madlock 
is the only major league baseball player to have won four batting titles 
who is not enshrined in the Hall of Fame. Madlock also had a fiery temper, 
and was involved in several incidents (including the 1980 episode) that 
exemplified it: As a player, Madlock was ejected from 18 games. He was 
also ejected from three games during his two years as a Tiger coach.[5] 
Over time, Madlock's approach to umpires changed. Umpire Jerry Crawford 
remarked after his 1980 dispute with Madlock that "[t]here's no question 
[Madlock has] calmed down. He's changed, which is great, because a guy 
of his ability doesn't have to do the things to umpires that he was doing." 
Madlock's agent, Steve Greenberg, son of baseball great Hank Greenberg, 
added that "[t]he Crawford incident was a benchmark. Now if he disagrees 
with an umpire, he uses his charm, which can be considerable."[2] In 2000 
and 2001 Madlock was a coach with the Detroit Tigers, reuniting with Tigers 
manager and former Pirates teammate Phil Garner. In 2001, Madlock was invited 
by Omar Moreno, another former Pirate teammate, to coach in a professional 
league in Panama City, Panama. In 2003, Madlock was hired to manage the 
Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League; the team went 117–134 
during his two seasons. In 2013, he was announced as the manager of the 
Independent League Tiffin Saints. On Saturday, August 27th, 2016, Madlock 
was inducted into the Decatur Public Schools (Decatur, IL) Athletic Hall 
of Fame during its inaugural ceremony at Frank M. Lindsay Field at Millikin 
University during the annual MacArthur-Eisenhower Tate & Lyle Braggin’
