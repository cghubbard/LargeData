John Aloysius McKeon (/məˈkiːən/; born November 23, 1930),[1][2] nicknamed 
"Trader Jack," is an American former Major League Baseball manager[3] and 
front-office executive. In 2003, at age 72, he won a World Series as manager 
of the Florida Marlins. Two full seasons removed from his previous managing 
job, McKeon had begun the 2003 season in retirement, but on May 11, he 
was induced to return to uniform to replace Jeff Torborg as the Marlins' 
pilot. The team was 16–22 and in next-to-last place in the National League 
East Division. McKeon, described upon his hiring by Marlins' general manager 
Larry Beinfest as a "resurrection specialist,"[4] led the Marlins to a 
75–49 win-loss record, a wild card berth, victories over the San Francisco 
Giants and Chicago Cubs in the National League divisional and championship 
series playoffs, and then a six-game World Series triumph over the New 
York Yankees. He remained at the helm of the Marlins through 2005, then 
seemingly retired at 74. In 2011, he took over the Marlins on June 20 for 
a second time as interim manager following the resignation of Edwin Rodríguez 
and served out the season. In so doing he became, at 80, the second oldest 
manager in big league history, behind only Connie Mack. He retired again 
at the end of the season with a career managerial record of 1,051–990 (.515). 
McKeon previously managed the Kansas City Royals (1973 to 1975), Oakland 
Athletics (parts of both 1977 and 1978), San Diego Padres (1988 to 1990), 
and the Cincinnati Reds (1997 to 2000). From July 7, 1980, through September 
22, 1990, he served as the general manager of the Padres, putting together 
the team which won the 1984 National League pennant, the first in San Diego 
history. Born in South Amboy, New Jersey, McKeon was a 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m), 
195 lb (88 kg) catcher who threw and batted right-handed. He played baseball 
for the College of the Holy Cross, and also attended Seton Hall University 
and Elon College, earning a bachelor of science degree in physical education.[5] 
He spent his entire early professional career (1949–64) in the minor leagues. 
He became a playing manager in 1955 and then worked in the farm system 
of the original Washington Senators franchise, and its successor, the Minnesota 
Twins, handling Triple-A assignments for the Vancouver Mounties (1962), 
Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers (1963) and Atlanta Crackers (through June 21, 
1964). He scouted for the Twins starting in mid-1964 before joining the 
Royals in 1968, one year before their Major League debut, as skipper of 
their Class A High Point-Thomasville farm team[6] and won the Carolina 
League playoff championship.[7] He led their Triple-A affiliate, the Omaha 
Royals of the American Association, from its founding in 1969 through 1972, 
and won two league titles. McKeon, then 42, was promoted to manager of 
the Kansas City Royals for 1973, succeeding Bob Lemon. The 1972 Royals 
had gone a disappointing 76–78 during the strike-shortened season, and 
moved into brand-new Royals Stadium in 1973. Paced by the slugging of first 
baseman John Mayberry, an All-Star performance from centerfielder Amos 
Otis and the 20-win season of left-hander Paul Splittorff, McKeon's 1973 
club won 88 of 162 games (.543, the best for the five-year-old franchise), 
six games behind eventual world champion Oakland in the AL West and the 
third-best mark in the entire American League. The 1973 Royals also saw 
the mid-August call up of 20-year-old George Brett, the future Hall of 
Famer. But the 1974 Royals could not sustain the momentum and were 77–85 
(.475), next-to-last in the West division. The following year, the 1975 
Royals improved to 50–46 by July 23, but it was not enough to save McKeon's 
job.[8][9] He was replaced by Whitey Herzog, then a coach for the California 
Angels.[8][9] Herzog led Kansas City to three successive AL West titles 
(1976–78), and, in the 1980s, he would become one of McKeon's trading partners 
when both were general managers in the National League. McKeon spent 1976 
back in the minor leagues as skipper of the Richmond Braves of the International 
League. He then was named manager of the 1977 Oakland Athletics during 
a time when team owner Charlie Finley was trading away veteran talent in 
anticipation of free agency. Nevertheless, McKeon had led the stripped-down 
A's to a respectable 26–27 mark by June 8, only six games out of first 
place in the AL West, when Finley shocked baseball by replacing him with 
Bobby Winkles.[10] McKeon remained in the Oakland organization as an assistant 
to Finley, while the A's struggled under Winkles for the rest of 1977 at 
37–71. In 1978, however, history repeated itself. The undermanned A's roared 
off to a 19–5 start and were still in first place at 24–15 on May 21 when 
Winkles resigned because of Finley's micromanaging.[11] McKeon returned 
to the dugout and finished the season, with Oakland winning only 45 of 
123 games and falling into sixth place in the seven-team division. McKeon 
then departed the Oakland organization, managing the Denver Bears, Triple-A 
affiliate of the Montreal Expos, in 1979. He began the 1979–80 offseason 
as top assistant to Bob Fontaine, the general manager of the San Diego 
Padres. During the 1980 All-Star break, with the Padres in last place in 
the National League West Division, owner Ray Kroc and club president Ballard 
F. Smith fired Fontaine and replaced him with McKeon, making him a first-time 
general manager at the age of 49. During his first off-season, he set about 
rebuilding the Padres through a flurry of trades—earning his "Trader Jack" 
nickname. He began by acquiring young catcher Terry Kennedy from Herzog's 
St. Louis Cardinals in an eleven-player deal. Over the next four off seasons, 
he would also trade for Dave Dravecky, Garry Templeton and Carmelo Martínez, 
draft young stars Tony Gwynn and Kevin McReynolds, and sign free agents 
Steve Garvey and Graig Nettles, the core of San Diego's 1984 National League 
champions. In June 1989, he traded his own son-in-law, pitcher Greg Booker. 
He told the New York Times in 1988: "Why do I trade? I'm aggressive. I'm 
confident. I'm a gambler. I'm willing to make a trade and not be afraid 
I'll get nailed."[12] McKeon stayed in the front office through the terms 
of four different managers. When the fourth skipper, Larry Bowa, started 
1988 at 16–30, McKeon took over the managerial reins himself on May 28. 
He led the Padres to a 67–48 mark for the rest of 1988, and an 89–73 record 
in 1989. But when his 1990 Padres stalled at 37–43 at the All-Star break, 
McKeon turned the team over to coach Greg Riddoch. Slightly more than two 
months later, he was ousted from the general manager's job when the Padres' 
new owner, Tom Werner, hired Joe McIlvaine away from the New York Mets. 
McKeon was out of baseball in 1991–92 before joining the Cincinnati Reds 
in 1993 as a Major League scout and then senior adviser for player personnel, 
working under GM Jim Bowden. He was in his fourth season in the latter 
job on July 25, 1997, when at age 66 he was asked to return to the field 
as the replacement for Ray Knight as the club's manager. The Reds were 
43–56 and nine games out in the National League Central Division, but McKeon 
coaxed them to a 33–30 mark for the rest of the season. He then survived 
a poor 1998 campaign, with Cincinnati falling to a sub-.500 (77–85) record 
and finishing 25 games out of first place in its division. But McKeon turned 
the Reds around in 1999, leading them to 96 victories and a tie for the 
National League wild card through the full 162-game season. However, the 
Reds were defeated 5–0 by the Mets in a one-game playoff held in their 
home ballpark, Cinergy Field, and were eliminated from the postseason. 
Nevertheless, McKeon was named 1999 NL Manager of the Year for his achievement. 
On the eve of 2000 spring training, the Reds electrified their fans by 
acquiring superstar center fielder Ken Griffey, Jr. — a Cincinnati native 
and son of the Reds' coach and former star — in a trade with the Seattle 
Mariners. Young Griffey hit 40 home runs, but the Reds posted a disappointing 
85–77 record and finished ten games behind the Cardinals. After the season 
ended, McKeon was relieved of his managerial duties. McKeon was again named 
National League Manager of the Year in 2003 — the result of leading the 
Marlins, who had a record below .500 when he took the job as their manager 
on May 11 to a World Series victory. With that victory, he became, at 72, 
the oldest manager to win the World Series, winning against the New York 
Yankees, against whom he wanted to play his first World Series, having 
lived in South Amboy, New Jersey and attending Yankee games while a child.[1] 
On October 2, 2005, just after the Marlins won the last game of the 2005 
season, McKeon announced that he would not be returning the following season. 
McKeon led the Marlins to three of the six winning seasons in franchise 
history, but there was a consensus within the organization that a managerial 
change was in order. On June 20, 2011, after manager Edwin Rodríguez resigned, 
the Florida Marlins held a press conference to announce that McKeon had 
been named interim manager. "I don't need this job but I love it", McKeon 
said, in taking over a team that had lost 10 straight and 18 of its last 
19. He retired after the conclusion of the 2011 season.[13] McKeon currently 
lives in Elon, North Carolina. Prior to his latest managerial stint, he 
was serving as a special assistant to Florida Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria.[14] 
McKeon is a devout Catholic and attends daily Mass, even doing so while 
his team was traveling during his managerial career.[15] He attributes 
much of his success, especially the Marlins' win in the 2003 National League 
Championship Series, to the intercession of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux.[15][16] 
McKeon is the author of two books, Jack of All Trades and I'm Just Getting 
Started. On May 5, 2012, McKeon was inducted into the Fulton County Baseball 
& Sports Hall of Fame for his achievements with the Gloversville-Johnstown 
Glovers, in which he played for in 1950 and 1951 in Gloversville, New York.[17] 
McKeon's Grandson, Kellan, is a two-time state champion wrestler for Chapel 
Hill High School and was the captain of the wrestling team at Duke University. 
On Tuesday, May 26, 2015, McKeon was inducted into the Irish American Baseball 
Hall of Fame, along with former Royals slugger Mike Sweeney, broadcaster 
Dave O'Brien, New York Mets public relations executive Shannon Forde, and 
Bill Murray, the comedic actor and owner of several minor league baseball
