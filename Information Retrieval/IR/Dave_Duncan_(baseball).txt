As player As coach David Edwin Duncan (born September 26, 1945) is an American 
pitching consultant for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He is also a former professional baseball catcher and pitching coach. 
He began his MLB playing career in 1964 and played again consecutively 
from 1967 to 1976 for the Kansas City/Oakland Athletics, Cleveland Indians, 
and Baltimore Orioles.[1] After retiring as a player, Duncan served as 
the pitching coach for the Indians, Seattle Mariners, Chicago White Sox, 
Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals. Four pitchers he coached won the Cy 
Young Award in 1983, 1990, 1992, and 2005. He was also a member of four 
World Series champion teams in 1972, 1989, 2006, and 2011. Each year from 
1983 to 2011, Duncan worked with former manager Tony La Russa on the White 
Sox, Athletics, and Cardinals. Following the 2013 season, he became a pitching 
consultant for the Diamondbacks. Duncan was signed as an amateur free agent 
by the Kansas City Athletics in 1963, as a 17-year-old out of Crawford 
High School in San Diego.[2] In his first at-bat as a professional baseball 
player, he hit a home run for the Daytona Beach Islanders of the Florida 
State League.[3] Duncan made his major league debut on May 6, 1964 at the 
age of 18, becoming the youngest player in the American League at the time.[4] 
He was kept in the majors to protect him from being drafted by another 
team under baseball rules.[5] Duncan returned to the minor leagues for 
the next two seasons, first with the Lewiston Broncs in the Single-A Northwest 
League in Lewiston, Idaho. Midway through the 1965 season, Rick Monday 
joined the team. A 19-year-old sophomore center fielder with Arizona State, 
Monday had led the Sun Devils to the 1965 College World Series title on 
June 12 and was the first pick in the first major league draft four days 
earlier. After the season, Duncan and Monday entered boot camp with the 
U.S. Marine Corps in San Diego in September.[6][7] The following year in 
1966, Duncan led the California League with 46 home runs in 121 games for 
the Modesto Reds, the A's affiliate.[8][9] The second pick in the 1966 
MLB draft was another Arizona State center fielder, 20-year-old Reggie 
Jackson. He played two weeks in Lewiston then joined Duncan in Modesto 
in early July, and kept pace with 21 homers in 56 games. Duncan began the 
1967 season with the Birmingham A's but, was brought back up to the major 
leagues in early June.[10] When his batting average dropped to a .194 in 
early July, he was returned to Birmingham to work on his hitting.[11][12] 
When his hitting showed signs of improvement, Duncan returned to the major 
leagues in September, along with Jackson and Joe Rudi.[13] Athletics' team 
owner Charlie Finley moved the franchise west to Oakland for the 1968 season, 
but Duncan started the season with the Vancouver Mounties of the Triple-A 
Pacific Coast League.[8] He was called up to the majors in June when catcher 
Jim Pagliaroni suffered a broken arm and went on the disabled list.[14] 
Duncan went on to catch the majority of the team's games in 1968.[15] While 
he possessed good defensive skills, he only managed to hit for a .191 batting 
average.[1] His batting average fell further to .126 in 1969 and Phil Roof 
took over as the Athletic's main catcher.[16] Duncan's hitting improved 
in 1970 to a career-high .259 batting average along with 10 home runs and 
29 runs batted in as, he shared catching duties with Frank Fernández and 
Gene Tenace, who was called up to the major leagues late in the season.[17] 
He also missed time due to his commitment to the military reserves.[18] 
When Duncan made adverse comments about Finley during the season, the owner 
fired Athletics manager John McNamara in October for failing to control 
his players, despite the team's second-place finish in the American League 
Western Division.[19] The 1971 season saw Duncan become the Athletics main 
catcher, as he guided their pitching staff to finish second in the league 
in earned run average as well as in strikeouts.[20][21] Duncan was the 
catcher for two twenty-game winners in 1971, as Vida Blue won 24 games 
and Catfish Hunter won 21 games.[20] His offense continued to improve, 
hitting 10 home runs by mid-season and, was selected as a reserve on the 
1971 American League All-Star team, replacing Ray Fosse who missed the 
game due to an injury.[1][22][23] Duncan finished the season with a .253 
average with 15 home runs, 40 runs batted in while leading American League 
catchers in range factor.[1][24] The Athletics would win the American League 
Western Division but, were defeated by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1971 
American League Championship Series.[25] 1972 would be Duncan's best season 
offensively as he hit 19 home runs with 59 runs batted in, although his 
batting average slipped to .218.[1] He committed only 5 errors in 113 games 
played for a career-high .993 fielding percentage, second only to Johnny 
Oates among American League catchers.[26] With Duncan calling the pitches, 
the Athletics' pitching staff led the league in winning percentage and 
in shutouts and, once again finished second in earned run average as, the 
team captured their second consecutive Western Division title.[27] Despite 
Duncan's production, Athletics manager Dick Williams, a proponent of the 
platoon system, began using Gene Tenace as the starting catcher during 
the last month of the season.[28] The Athletics defeated the Detroit Tigers 
in the 1972 American League Championship Series and then the Cincinnati 
Reds in the World Series.[29][30] Although Duncan joined the Athletics 
in spring training, he became embroiled in a contract dispute with Finley 
and, in March 1973 he was traded along with George Hendrick to the Cleveland 
Indians for Ray Fosse and Jack Heidemann.[2][31] Duncan became the Indians' 
starting catcher in 1973 however, he broke his wrist on June 28 and missed 
two months of the season.[32] He finished the season hitting for a .233 
average with 17 home runs and 43 runs batted in while leading American 
League catchers in range factor.[1] He played in a career-high 136 games 
in the 1974 season but, the heavy workload caused his batting average to 
fall to .200.[1] In February 1975, Duncan was traded with Al McGraw to 
the Baltimore Orioles for Don Hood and Boog Powell.[2] With the Orioles, 
Duncan shared catching duties with Elrod Hendricks during the 1975 season 
before Rick Dempsey took over as the Orioles starting catcher in 1976.[33][34] 
Duncan would be traded to the Chicago White Sox in November of that year.[2] 
When the White Sox released him in March 1977, he retired as a player at 
the age of 32.[1] In an eleven-year major league career, Duncan played 
in 929 games, accumulating 617 hits in 2,885 at bats for a .214 career 
batting average along with 109 home runs, 341 runs batted in and an on-base 
percentage of .279.[1] While he was a light-hitting player, he excelled 
as a defensive catcher, ending his career with a .984 fielding percentage.[1][35] 
He was respected during his playing career for his defensive skills and 
for his knowledge of the game of baseball.[36] In spite of his low average 
he hit 109 home runs, one for every 26.5 at bats. During his time with 
the Athletics, he first met future manager Tony La Russa, then a utility 
infielder with the club. Duncan began his coaching career in 1978 with 
the Cleveland Indians. After a stint as a pitching coach for the Seattle 
Mariners in 1982, he joined former teammate La Russa, then the manager 
of the Chicago White Sox.[37] From that time they worked in tandem as manager 
and pitching coach, joining Oakland in 1986 and then the Cardinals in 1996. 
Beginning in 1986, first base coach Dave McKay also began a long tenure 
of working with Duncan and La Russa. The three men continued to work together 
until the Cardinals won the 2011 World Series. La Russa retired immediately 
after that World Series and Duncan retired from coaching less than three 
months later.[38] McKay also moved on, accepting the first base coaching 
role with the Chicago Cubs. Pitchers on Duncan's staffs won four Cy Young 
Awards: LaMarr Hoyt in 1983; Bob Welch in 1990; Dennis Eckersley in 1992; 
and Chris Carpenter in 2005.[39] Dave Stewart, who had not found consistent 
success before signing with Oakland as a free agent in 1986, won 20 or 
more games and pitched 250 or more innings four straight seasons from 1987 
to 1990.[40] From 1988 through 1990, Oakland pitchers had the lowest earned 
run average (ERA) in the American League, and the 2005 St. Louis staff 
had the lowest ERA in the majors. La Russa regularly credits Duncan as 
being a key factor in the success of the teams he managed for over 25 years.[39][41] 
In October 2010, Duncan signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him 
with the Cardinals through 2012 with an option for 2013.[42] He took an 
indeterminate leave of absence from the Cardinals on January 5, 2012, to 
spend time with his wife, Jeanine, who was dealing with cancer.[43] Duncan's 
semi-retirement effectively ended his tenure with the Cardinals. During 
his sixteen seasons as the Cardinals' pitching coach, the pitching staff 
had the third-lowest overall ERA in MLB as well as the third-lowest starters' 
ERA.[44] On November 13, 2013, the Arizona Diamondbacks announced they 
had hired Duncan to be a special assistant to general manager Kevin Towers 
as a pitching consultant. "With Dave, he's going to set his own schedule 
and it will depend on what he wants to do and what he's capable of doing", 
Towers commented of his role. "During spring training, be available to 
work with pitchers, catchers and pitching coaches as they're preparing 
for a game. Breaking down video of pitchers we might be considering for 
the draft. Plus, targeting guys in our system and getting his input – who 
he likes, who is close."[44] Duncan lives in Kimberling City, Missouri. 
He resided with his wife, Jeanine, until her death on June 6, 2013, after 
a battle against glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer.[45] His younger 
son, Chris, was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals and made his major league 
debut in 2005.[46] His older son, Shelley, was selected in the second round 
of the 2001 draft by the New York Yankees and debuted in the Major Leagues 
on July 20, 2007.[47] Duncan has two daughters from his first marriage. 
Tiffany Duncan and Devannie Duncan who both reside in Orange County, California.
