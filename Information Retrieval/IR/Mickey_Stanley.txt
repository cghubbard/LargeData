Mitchell Jack "Mickey" Stanley (born July 20, 1942 in Grand Rapids, Michigan) 
was an American professional baseball player. He played his entire career 
in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers from 1964-1978. Stanley 
was known as a superb defensive outfielder over his 15-year career, though 
he is best remembered for the last few weeks of the 1968 season. Stanley 
prepped at Ottawa Hills High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Stanley 
made his Major League Baseball debut in center field with Detroit on September 
13, 1964. He was an excellent defensive player, winning Gold Glove Awards 
in 1968, 1969, 1970, and 1973. For nine consecutive seasons, from 1966–1974, 
Stanley played the majority of the Tigers' games in center field. He had 
speed, a strong arm, good hands, and an ability to take the perfect first 
step to get a jump on loose seams headed to the gaps. In both 1968 and 
1970, Stanley led all American League outfielders with a perfect 1.000 
fielding percentage. His 1973 Range factor of 2.74 was well above the league 
average of 2.02. Stanley was an adequate but not overwhelming hitter. In 
1970, the speedy Stanley was second in the American League with 11 triples. 
Until 1968, he was used mainly as a defensive replacement, pinch-hitter 
and even part-time first baseman. He earned a regular spot in the lineup 
in 1968 with his slick fielding, .259 average and hustle, and led the Tigers 
with 583 at-bats that season. The fact that outfielder Al Kaline spent 
part of the year injured also boosted Stanley's playing time. With the 
American League pennant clinched and two weeks left in the '68 season, 
manager Mayo Smith asked Stanley to play the last nine games of the regular 
season at shortstop, the first time he had ever played the position. This 
was in preparation for the World Series, in which Smith planned to replace 
weak-hitting regular shortstop Ray Oyler (who was hitting a paltry .135 
at the time) in favor of Stanley's superior bat. This would also allow 
the other 3 power hitting Tiger outfielders (Willie Horton, Jim Northrup, 
and Al Kaline) to all be in the lineup for the World Series. Stanley did 
a decent job, committing two errors in 34 chances, and became the starting 
shortstop for the entire 1968 World Series. Oyler did not have an official 
at-bat in the Series and appeared in only four games as a defensive replacement—the 
four games the Tigers needed to win the series. Stanley made two errors 
in the seven-game series, neither of which led to a run. He did not have 
a stellar series at the plate, hitting .214, but he did triple and score 
two runs in a pivotal Game 5 comeback win for the Tigers. And his move 
allowed Horton, Northrup, and Kaline to all play full-time; Horton batted 
.304 with 1 HR and 3 RBI, Northrup batted .250 with 2 HR and 8 RBI, and 
Kaline batted .379 with 2 HR and 8 RBI. In its "The End of the Century" 
series, ESPN rated Smith's decision to move Stanley to shortstop for the 
1968 World Series as #4 of the 10 greatest coaching decisions of the 20th 
century.[1] Stanley returned to play 59 games at shortstop the next year, 
after Oyler was allowed to be drafted by the expansion Seattle Pilots. 
However, the Stanley-at-short experiment did not work long-term. While 
he played reasonably well defensively (7 errors in 252 chances), Mickey's 
batting average dropped to .235. It recovered when he was returned primarily 
to the outfield for the remainder of his career. Detroit finished the 1969 
season 19 games out of first. With the veteran Al Kaline injured and the 
arrival of the newly created Designated Hitter rule in 1973 (a spot primarily 
filled by aging slugger Frank Howard and pinch hitter Gates Brown that 
year), Stanley reached career highs in games (157, all in the outfield), 
at-bats (602) and home runs (17). He also played full-time in the outfield 
for the 1974 season, before getting injured and then giving way to budding 
star Ron LeFlore. He completed his career in 1975-1978 as it had started—as 
a utility outfielder and late-inning defensive replacement, but this time 
he made occasional infield appearances, too. During these last four seasons, 
he played at least a few games at every position on the field except pitcher 
and catcher. Stanley made the last play ever at the original Yankee Stadium, 
catching a fly ball hit by Mike Hegan on September 30, 1973. Stanley is 
remembered for his quote on being struck out by fireballer Nolan Ryan, 
who had once no-hit the Tigers in 1973: "Those were the best pitches I 
ever heard."[2] After retiring from baseball, Stanley signed with the Detroit 
Caesars professional softball club in 1979, playing part-time as the team 
advanced to the APSPL World Series losing to the Milwaukee Schlitz. The 
Caesars folded after the season and Stanley continued his career with the 
Detroit Auto Kings in their only season (1980). The Auto Kings won the 
Eastern Division of the North American Softball League and advanced to 
the league finals, where they also lost to the Milwaukee Schlitz. Stanley
