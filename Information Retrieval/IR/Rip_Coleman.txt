Walter Gary "Rip" Coleman (July 31, 1931 – May 14, 2004) was an American 
professional baseball player, a left-handed pitcher who played from 1955 
to 1957 and 1959 to 1960 for the New York Yankees, Kansas City Athletics 
and Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball. A native of Troy, New York 
he attended Syracuse University and Wake Forest University. Before the 
1952 season, Coleman was signed by the Yankees. He made his big league 
debut with them about three years later, on August 15, 1955. He went 2–1 
in 10 games in his rookie season. In 29 innings of work, he allowed 40 
hits and 17 earned runs for a 5.28 ERA. He also walked 16 batters and struck 
out only 15. He appeared in one game in the 1955 World Series, giving up 
five hits in one inning of work. He showed great improvement in 1956, lowering 
his ERA to 3.67. In 29 games (nine starts), he posted a 3–5 record with 
42 walks and 42 strikeouts in 88 1⁄3 innings of work. On February 19, 1957, 
Coleman was involved in a multi-player trade between the Yankees and Athletics. 
The Yankees sent Coleman, Milt Graff, Billy Hunter, Mickey McDermott, Tom 
Morgan and Irv Noren to the Athletics for Art Ditmar, Bobby Shantz, Jack 
McMahan and Wayne Belardi. As players to be named later, the Yankees sent 
Jack Urban to the Athletics and the Athletics sent Curt Roberts and Clete 
Boyer to the Yankees to complete the trade. 1957 was not a good season 
for Rip Coleman. Overall, he went 0–7 with a 5.93 ERA in 41 innings of 
work. He walked 25 batters, struck out 15 and allowed 53 hits. He did not 
appear in the majors in 1958. In 1959, he found his way back into the majors 
but again did not perform well. Overall, in 32 games (11 starts), he went 
2–10 with a 4.34 ERA in 85 innings of work. On September 6 of that year 
he was selected off waivers by the Orioles. With them, he allowed no runs 
in four innings of work. 1960 would end up being Coleman's final season 
in the majors. He went 0–2 with an 11.25 ERA in five games, which included 
one start. Although he started a game, he pitched in only four innings 
total that year, walking five batters and striking out none. In fact, in 
the game he started, he lasted only 1/3 of an innings. In that time, he 
allowed two earned runs. Overall, Rip Coleman went 7–25 in his career. 
Of the 95 games he pitched, 33 of them were starts, three of those starts 
were complete games and one of those complete games was a shutout. In 247 
1⁄3 innings, he saved five games, allowed 287 hits, 144 runs, 126 earned 
runs, 21 home runs and 124 walks. He struck out 130 batters and his ERA
