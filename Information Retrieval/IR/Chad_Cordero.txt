Chad Patrick Cordero (born March 18, 1982) is an American former professional 
baseball player. A pitcher, he played in Major League Baseball for the 
Montreal Expos / Washington Nationals and Seattle Mariners. Cordero's best 
season was in 2005, when he was an All-Star and won the Rolaids Relief 
Man Award. During the period of 2005–2007, he recorded 113 saves, second 
most in the National League behind Trevor Hoffman's 131.[1] At age 18, 
Cordero was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 26th round of the 2000 
draft, but he chose to enroll at Cal State Fullerton, where he was a standout 
reliever. With an ERA of under 1.83 he made the 1st team All-America Freshman 
team and was selected to the Big West All-Conference team, the latter of 
which he repeated in each of his next two years. In 2003, he was the Fullerton 
Regional MVP (College World Series), and then was drafted by the Expos 
in the 1st round (20th overall). Cordero pitched briefly in 2003, and then 
appeared in 69 games for the Expos in 2004, compiling an ERA of 2.94, usually 
appearing as a closer. He was the winning pitcher in the franchise's last 
Montreal Expo victory, October 2 against the New York Mets at Shea Stadium.[2] 
The Expos became the Washington Nationals in 2005, and Cordero had a career 
best season. In June 2005, Cordero tied the major league record for saves 
in one month with 15. He shares the record with Lee Smith and John Wetteland. 
In addition, he also converted his 24th consecutive save, breaking the 
club record held by Mel Rojas. On September 9, 2005, Cordero's 44th save 
broke the franchise record. He completed the 2005 season with 47 saves, 
leading the major leagues, and was selected to the National League pitching 
staff for the 2005 MLB All-Star game, facing one batter, Iván Rodríguez, 
and striking him out. He was the 2005 Washington Nationals Player of the 
Year, and won the National League Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award. 
In February 2006, Cordero and his teammate Brian Schneider were chosen 
to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic. During the season, 
however, his production tailed off. While he still got 29 saves (8th best 
in the league), his ERA went from 1.82 to 3.19. In the beginning of the 
2007 season, Cordero faced a tough time against batters. By May 6, his 
ERA was 4.70. Cordero admitted he was distracted by the illness of his 
ailing grandmother,[3] and missed six games for personal bereavement leave. 
He came back a changed man, and starting May 16 made 12 consecutive appearances 
without allowing a run. On June 13, Cordero (at age 25 years and 86 days) 
became the second youngest player in baseball history to reach 100 saves 
in a career. (The Tigers' Francisco Rodríguez is the youngest at 24 years 
and 246 days old.)[4] Cordero missed almost all of the 2008 season after 
undergoing surgery to repair a labrum tear, an injury he suffered in April.[1] 
On October 30, 2008 the Nationals sent him outright to AAA Syracuse, and 
he rejected the assignment, becoming a free agent. Among other reasons 
for Cordero's rejection was that he was displeased with how he found out 
that he would be "non-tendered" by the Nationals at the end of the season—via 
an impromptu comment made by Nationals' GM Jim Bowden on a radio show in 
July.[5] On March 12, 2009, he signed a minor league contract with the 
Seattle Mariners with an invitation to spring training. He was to compete 
for the closer role once he fully recovered from surgery, but was unable 
to make a minor league appearance until July.[1] He was called up to the 
Mariners on June 3, 2010, taking the spot of the retired Ken Griffey, Jr.[1] 
On July 15, 2010 he refused a minor league assignment from the Seattle 
Mariners and became a free agent. On July 21, 2010 Cordero agreed on a 
minor league deal with the New York Mets and was assigned to Triple A Buffalo. 
On January 3, 2011 he signed a minor league contract with an invite to 
Spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays. He was released on May 17.[6] 
Cordero later signed[7] with the St. Paul Saints of the American Association 
of Independent Professional Baseball, but retired on June 20, 2011.[8] 
On February 13, 2013, he signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim due to his desire to play again.[9] He was assigned to 
the Inland Empire 66ers of the California League, the (high) Class-A affiliate 
of the Angels, to begin the season.[10] Chad has two children: Riley and 
Tehya. Cordero's daughter Tehya died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.[11]
