Ulysses John "Tony" Lupien ,Jr. (April 23, 1917 – July 9, 2004) was an 
American first baseman in Major League Baseball. He was a left-handed batter 
who played for the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White 
Sox. Lupien was an all-around athlete and successful coach. Lupien was 
born in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, the son of Eugenie (née Gosselin) and 
Ulysses J. Lupien.[1] His parents were of French Canadian descent, and 
he was named "Ulysses" because of his great-grandfather's admiration for 
president Ulysses S. Grant.[2] He graduated from Harvard University in 
1939. At Harvard, he was captain of the baseball team as a junior and of 
the basketball team as a senior. He was the Eastern Intercollegiate League 
batting champion in 1938 and 1939, and he also was a quarterback for his 
freshman football team.[citation needed] Upon graduation from Harvard, 
Lupien signed a professional baseball contract with the Red Sox and played 
the 1939 season for the Double-A Scranton Red Sox Eastern League championship 
team. He made his major league debut for the Red Sox on September 12, 1940. 
One of his most productive seasons came in 1942 when he batted .281 with 
three home runs and 70 runs batted in for the Red Sox. He was traded to 
the Phillies where he played in 1944 and early in 1945, before serving 
in the U.S. Navy during World War II. In the 1944 season he hit .283 with 
five homers, 52 RBI, 82 runs, 23 doubles, 9 triples and 18 stolen bases. 
After his discharge from the Navy, Lupien played two years for the Hollywood 
Stars of the Pacific Coast League, where his 1947 record of batting .341, 
with 21 homers and 110 RBI, led to his return to the major leagues for 
one final season in 1948, with the White Sox. Lupien finished his MLB career 
hitting .268 with 18 home runs, 230 RBI, 285 runs, 92 doubles, 30 triples, 
and 57 stolen bases in 614 games. In 1949, he played with Triple-A Toledo 
(American Association). He concluded his professional career from 1951–53 
and in 1955 when he was a player as well as field and general manager with 
the Jamestown Falcons and Corning Independents, in the PONY League. From 
1951 to 1956, he was head basketball coach at Middlebury College, compiling 
a record of 60–49 in five seasons. In 1956, Lupien was hired as the Dartmouth 
Big Green baseball coach. He spent 21 seasons at Dartmouth College and 
guided his teams to 313 wins, 305 losses and three ties, winning the Eastern 
Baseball Intercollegiate League championship four times (1963, 1967, 1969–70). 
His 1970 team advanced to the College World Series at Omaha, Nebraska where 
it finished fifth. That team had a 24–10 record that included a 21-game 
win streak. He was also the Dartmouth freshman basketball coach from 1956 
to 1968. Lupien retired from coaching in 1977, but continued to work for 
many years as a stockbroker with various firms in New England. He died 
in Norwich, Vermont, at 87 years of age. He was married to Natalie Nichols, 
and later to Mildred Robinson. His grandson is wrestler and actor John 
Cena, with whom he shared the same birthday.[3] Lupien was recognized for 
decades as a great teacher and mentor. He was also an outspoken observer 
of labor relations in professional baseball. In 1980 he collaborated with 
writer Lee Lowenfish to author The Imperfect Diamond, a book that remains 
a definitive text on baseball labor from the introduction of the reserve 
clause in 1879 to the litigation in the 1970s that led to free agency.[4]
