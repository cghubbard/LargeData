Jaime Jarrín (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈxaime xaˈrin]; born December 10, 
1935 in Quito, Ecuador) is the Spanish language voice of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. He began broadcasting for the Dodgers in 1959 and was the 1998 
recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame. One 
of the most recognizable voices in Hispanic broadcasting, Jarrin, "the 
Spanish Voice of the Dodgers" is also heard on Spectrum SportsNet LA's 
SAP channel. Born in Cayambe, Ecuador, Jarrin began work as a broadcaster 
in his home country when he was just 16 years old. He went on to become 
the announcer for the National Congress of Ecuador. He came to the United 
States on June 24, 1955. At the time, he had never seen a baseball game. 
When the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, KWKW, where Jarrin was the 
news and sports director, picked up the Spanish language rights for the 
games. The original broadcast team included Rene Cardenas, Miguel Alonso 
and Rodolfo Hoyos Jr. and they were joined by Jarrin in 1959.[1] For the 
first six years, they did not travel with the team but would recreate the 
games on radio while listening to the English-language broadcast in a studio. 
In 1973, after 14 years with the Dodgers, Jarrín became the club's number-one 
Spanish-language broadcaster. From 1962 to 1984, Jarrín never missed a 
game, calling close to 4,000 games over 22 seasons. The streak was broken 
only when he took charge of all the Spanish-language radio coverage and 
production for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. During 1980-81, 
J Rene Cardenas, Miguel Alonso and Rodolfo Hoyos Jr. served as interpreter 
for Mexican pitcher Fernando Valenzuela. Valenzuela would later work as 
color commentator alongside Jarrín and Pepe Yñiguez on Dodgers games. He 
has called more than 30 world championship boxing title bouts throughout 
the world for radio and television stations in Latin America, including 
the Thrilla in Manila between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. He has called 
19 All-Star Games and 25 World Series, including the 2005 Fall Classic 
in which he served as the emcee for MLB's Latin Legends ceremony. His broadcasts 
of the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and World Series on CBS, 
the Latina Broadcasting Network, Cadena Latina and Caracol and 1989 to 
1999 were carried on more than 300 stations. In March 2006, Jarrín served 
as a play-by-play announcer for the inaugural World Baseball Classic. In 
addition to his work calling Dodger games, Jarrín found himself at the 
center of many international news broadcasts, including the funeral of 
President John F. Kennedy, Pope John Paul II's visit to America, and several 
important meetings between foreign leaders and Presidents Richard Nixon 
and Lyndon B. Johnson. For the 2015 season, Jarrín was paired for the first 
time in the booth with his son Jorge Jarrín.[2] With the retirement of 
fellow Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully in 2016, Jarrin will become the longest 
tenured active broadcaster in baseball on April 7, 2017. In 1998, Jarrín 
received the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame, becoming 
the second Spanish-language broadcaster to that award, joining Mets and 
Yankees announcer, Buck Canel. In February 1998, Jarrín was the first recipient 
of the Southern California Broadcaster Association's President's Award. 
Also in 1998, he was honored by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists 
with their highest award, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame. In 2002, Jarrín was inducted into the California Broadcasters Association 
Hall of Fame and in 2003, into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum. He 
received the 2003 Foreign Language Sports Broadcaster Award from the Southern 
California Sports Broadcasters and was inducted into the Southern California 
Sports Broadcaster's Hall of Fame. Jarrín was honored again by the SCSB 
with the foreign-language broadcaster of the year award in 2003, 2004, 
2005, 2007 and 2008. In 2009, he was honored by the Society of St. Vincent 
DePaul for his commitment to changing the lives of at-risk youth in the 
community. He has also received La Gran Cruz al Merito en El Grado de Comendador 
(the highest civilian medal) from his native Ecuador in January 1992. In 
1990 he was named as one of the top 100 Influential Hispanics in the United 
States by Hispanic Business Magazine. In 1970, he was the first Latin American 
to win the Golden Mike Award, which he received again in 1971. In 2000, 
he spoke at the MLB Rookie Development seminar, which is designed to prepare 
top minor league prospects for the Major Leagues. In 2011, Jarrin was honored 
in Los Angeles with the AFTRA Foundation's AFTRA Media and Entertainment 
Excellence Award in Broadcasting. His colleague, Vin Scully, received the 
same award in 2009. On June 11, 2012, the Dodgers prior to their game against 
the Angels honored Jarrín for 54 years of service. He was given a trophy 
and threw out the first pitch of the game. A video tribute was also made 
and shown. The fans also received a blue colored T-shirt where the front 
of the shirt said "Se Va, Se Va, Se Va" Jarrin studied philosophy, letters, 
journalism and broadcasting at Central University of Ecuador in Quito. 
His son, Jorge, started as a traffic reporter for English and Spanish radio 
stations in Los Angeles before joining the Dodgers broadcast team. Jarrin
