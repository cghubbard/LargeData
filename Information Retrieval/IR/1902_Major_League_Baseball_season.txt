The 1902 Major League Baseball season, involved the Milwaukee Brewers moving 
to St. Louis and become the St. Louis Browns, and the Chicago Orphans were 
renamed as the Cubs. Note: The Baltimore Orioles of 1902 became the New 
York Highlanders in 1903 (which were renamed the New York Yankees in 1913).
