St. George Cricket Grounds or St. George Grounds is a former baseball venue 
located on Staten Island, New York. St. George was the home park for the 
New York Metropolitans of the American Association for the 1886 and 1887 
seasons. The grounds were also a part-time home to the New York Giants 
of the National League in 1889. The stadium, which was built along the 
lines of a typical horse race track grandstand, was constructed as part 
of the development of the then-new community of St. George, Staten Island 
in 1886, by Erastus Wiman. Although the community and the ferry were successful, 
baseball was not. The Giants were a strong team through the latter part 
of the 1880s, and the Metropolitans folded after the 1887 season. The Giants 
played some games there from April 29 – June 14, 1889, while awaiting construction 
of the Polo Grounds; their move to Manhattan ended professional baseball 
at St. George. Coordinates: 40°38′48″N 74°04′42″W﻿ / ﻿40.6468°N 74.0783°W﻿
