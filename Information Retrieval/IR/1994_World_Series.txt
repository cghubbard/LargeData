The 1994 World Series was canceled on September 14 of that year due to 
an ongoing strike by the Major League Baseball Players Association, which 
had begun on August 12. It was only the second time in the event's history 
(the first was in 1904) that the Fall Classic was not played. This was 
to have been the first year of a regularly scheduled three-tier playoff 
system, with the NL and AL divided into three divisions (East, Central, 
and West) at the start of the 1994 season. (An unscheduled three-tier system 
was used in 1981 due to the shortening of the season by a mid-season labor 
dispute.) The new playoff system (involving a wild card team in each league) 
did not go into effect until the 1995 postseason. Had the postseason taken 
place based on team records as of August 11, the participants in each division 
series would have been determined as follows: Because division champions 
from 1994 are unofficial, the Atlanta Braves are officially credited with 
winning 14 consecutive division titles from 1991 to 2005, winning the NL 
West in the final three years of the two–division system and then winning 
11 consecutive NL East titles from 1995 to 2005. At the time of the season's 
cancellation, however, the Braves were in second place in the NL East at 
68–46, six games behind the Montreal Expos. The 11 titles from 1995 to 
2005 are an MLB record nonetheless. The Braves had a 2½ game lead over 
the Houston Astros for the NL wild card at the time the rest of the season 
was canceled. The Associated Press writers, at the end of the aborted season, 
chose to name "unofficial" champions when naming their Managers of the 
Year as Felipe Alou of the Expos and Buck Showalter of the Yankees, who 
were leading when the season abruptly ended. The next season's All-Star 
Game managers are, by tradition, the managers of the previous year's league 
champions; and so the leagues chose to name those unofficial league champion 
managers of 1994 to the traditional honor of managing the 1995 All-Star 
Game. The 1994 World Series was scheduled to air on ABC, in the first year 
of a six-year-long joint venture with Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC 
called "The Baseball Network." Because this Series was cancelled, ABC and 
NBC shared broadcast rights to the 1995 World Series, after which the joint 
venture was ended, and Fox started televising MLB games the following season. 
Fox and NBC would alternate World Series telecasts from 1996 up to 2000, 
after which Fox held exclusive rights to all subsequent editions. The 1994 
World Series was supposed to have the AL champion open at home for the 
second year in a row because the playoffs were expanded to include the 
new wild-card round.[1][2] Up to 1993, the NL champion opened the World 
Series at home in even-numbered years and the AL champion in odd-numbered 
years; 1994 reversed this pattern. Even though the AL missed having home-field 
advantage in the 1994 World Series, the NL champion was granted home advantage 
in 1995, as would have been the case had the 1994 Series occurred. From 
1995 to 2002, the NL champion had home field advantage in odd-numbered 
years and AL in even-numbered years. Beginning in 2003, the league that
