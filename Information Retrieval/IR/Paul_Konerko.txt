Paul Henry Konerko (/kəˈnɛərkoʊ/; born March 5, 1976) is an American former 
professional baseball first baseman who played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cincinnati Reds and, for most of his 
career, the Chicago White Sox. Konerko helped the White Sox win the 2005 
World Series over the Houston Astros, the franchise's first since 1917. 
From 2006 to 2014 he served as the White Sox captain. Born in Providence, 
Rhode Island, Konerko is of Polish (paternal) and Italian (maternal) descent.[citation 
needed] At Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Arizona, Konerko was named 
the Arizona Republic/Phoenix Gazette Player of the Year as a senior, after 
leading his team to a Class 4-A state championship. Konerko hit .558 in 
1994, the school season record until Ike Davis, who later became the first 
baseman for the New York Mets, hit .559 in 2003. Konerko also held the 
school season record in doubles, with 18, until Davis hit 23 doubles in 
2003. He also held the school career record in doubles (44), until Davis 
passed him with 48 doubles.[1] Konerko was ranked the #1 catcher in the 
nation during his senior year in high school.[2] Konerko was drafted in 
the first round (13th overall) of the 1994 MLB draft by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. On May 13, 1995, with the San Bernardino Spirit, he drove in the 
only run of a 21-inning game. It was the longest shutout in California 
League history.[3] Konerko played for the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes. He 
is one of three Dodgers position players to have been twice selected for 
the Dodgers organization's "Minor League Player of the Year" award, along 
with Billy Ashley and Joc Pederson.[4] He played parts of the 1997 and 
1998 seasons with the Dodgers. In a little more than 150 at bats, he hit 
just 4 home runs.[5] Konerko was traded, along with lefty pitcher Dennys 
Reyes, by the Dodgers to the Cincinnati Reds for All Star closer Jeff Shaw.[6] 
Konerko played 26 games with the Reds.[7] On November 11, 1998, Konerko 
was traded by the Reds to the White Sox for Mike Cameron.[8] In 2000, with 
a 95–67 record, the White Sox made the playoffs for the first time since 
1993. Konerko made his first postseason appearance that year, when the 
White Sox lost to the Seattle Mariners in the 2000 American League Division 
Series (ALDS). The Mariners swept the series in 3 games, and in 9 at-bats, 
Konerko had no hits. He got on base once on a walk. In 2005, the White 
Sox defeated the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the American League Championship 
Series (ALCS). After going 0 for 4 in the first game[9] and 1 for 4 in 
the second game,[10] Konerko hit 3 for 4 with three RBI's in the third 
game of the ALCS against the Angels.[11] Two of the RBI's came from a home 
run in the first inning. In Game 4, Konerko was 1 for 4 with three RBI's 
on another first inning home run,[12] the second in as many nights. In 
Game 5, Konerko went 1 for 5 with another RBI [13] He was named the ALCS 
MVP on the strength of a .268 batting average, two home runs and seven 
RBI's [14] He said, "I think you could split this four ways", referring 
to his feeling that the MVP should be awarded to the White Sox starting 
pitchers who pitched four consecutive complete games in the ALCS. In Game 
2 of the 2005 World Series, Konerko hit the first grand slam in White Sox 
World Series history[15] to put the White Sox ahead 6–4.[16] It was also 
the first grand slam in postseason history to give a team the lead when 
trailing in the seventh inning or later. Those were Konerko's only RBI's 
of the World Series, but they were critical in giving the White Sox the 
momentum to complete a four-game sweep of the Houston Astros and they were 
the most for a White Sox hitter in the series. Konerko caught the final 
out for every one of the series-clinching games throughout the playoffs.[17] 
Following the 2005 World Series victory, Konerko signed a five-year $60 million 
deal with the White Sox on November 30, 2005 after reportedly turning down 
more lucrative offers from the Los Angeles Angels and the Baltimore Orioles.[18] 
Konerko became the face of the White Sox franchise after the departure 
of Frank Thomas who was the face of the franchise during the 1990s. Konerko 
concluded the 2006 season with 35 home runs, helping him rank in the top 
10 for total home runs over the past three seasons, after hitting over 
40 home runs in 2004 and 2005. In 2010, he was second in the American League 
for home runs with 39.[19] On September 18, 2008, Konerko became the last 
opposing player to hit a home run at Yankee Stadium[20] in the 9th inning 
of a 9–2 White Sox loss. On Monday, April 13, 2009, Konerko connected back 
to back with Jermaine Dye for the 300th home run of both players' respective 
careers off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Zach Miner. This was the first time 
that this had ever happened in Major League history; where two players 
had hit a century milestone home run in one game, let alone back to back.[21] 
On July 7, 2009, Konerko was 3 for 4 with three home runs including seven 
RBIs in a 10–6 win against the Cleveland Indians. It was the first time 
in his big league career that he hit three home runs in a game.[22] He 
is also the only White Sox player to accomplish that at U.S. Cellular Field. 
On July 10, 2010, Konerko was announced to replace Twins first baseman 
Justin Morneau at the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. This was 
the fourth All-Star selection of his career.[23] Near the end of the 2010 
season, Konerko was hit in the face by Minnesota Twins pitcher Carl Pavano. 
This resulted in major controversy. White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle returned 
the favor in the next inning hitting Twins first baseman Michael Cuddyer. 
Both teams then received a warning from the head umpire and no further 
incidents occurred. Refusing to leave the game, Konerko hit a solo home 
run on the first pitch he saw in his next at bat against Pavano. [24] Konerko 
finished the 2010 season with 39 home runs, his most since 2005 and the 
third-highest total of his career.[7] Additionally, he was in fifth place 
in the year's MVP voting, the highest finish of his career to date. On 
December 8, 2010, Konerko re-signed with the Chicago White Sox for 3 years 
worth $37.5 million.[25] On June 1, 2011, Konerko hit his 377th career 
home run in a game against the Boston Red Sox, passing former White Sox 
player Carlton Fisk on the White Sox all-time home run list. Konerko is 
now second on the club's home run list currently with 400 as a member of 
the White Sox, trailing only Frank Thomas' 448.[26] On June 10, 2011, Konerko 
hit a home run in a game against the Oakland Athletics, setting the franchise 
record for consecutive games with an extra base hit at 9 games. [27] On 
June 20, 2011, Konerko hit his 385th career home run in a game against 
the Chicago Cubs, passing former White Sox player Harold Baines on the 
all-time home run list. On June 21, 2011, Konerko continued his hot June 
when he homered in a game against the Chicago Cubs and his 5th straight 
game, becoming the 5th player in White Sox history to hit a home run in 
5 consecutive games. The other 5 are Greg Luzinski, Ron Kittle, Frank Thomas 
(twice), Carlos Lee, and most recently A. J. Pierzynski in 2012. [28] Konerko 
made it onto his fifth All-Star team after winning the Final Vote contest 
for the American League. On August 23, 2011, Konerko recorded his 2,000th 
hit in the top of the 8th inning to tie the game at 4 to 4 against the 
Angels. Konerko finished the season with 30 home runs, 105 RBIs, and a 
.300 batting average, the 5th time in his career that he finished with 
30 home runs and 100+ RBIs. In October 2011, White Sox general manager 
Kenny Williams admitted that he briefly considered naming Konerko player-manager 
for Chicago after the departure of manager Ozzie Guillén. However, Williams 
never discussed the possibility with Konerko. Former White Sox player Robin 
Ventura was named manager for the upcoming 2012 season.[29] There has not 
been a player-manager in Major League Baseball since Pete Rose served in 
the capacity for the Cincinnati Reds in 1986. In November 2011, Konerko 
was inducted into the Arizona Fall League Hall of Fame along with Phillies 
first baseman Ryan Howard.[30] On April 25, 2012, Konerko hit his 400th 
career home run, passing Al Kaline and Andrés Galarraga and becoming the 
48th player in Major League history to hit 400 home runs. Konerko was named 
the American League Player of the Week for the week of April 23–29. He 
hit .435 with 3 HR and 4 RBI. He led the AL in slugging and total bases 
that week.[31] Konerko continued his hot hitting into the month of May 
as he racked up his second American League Player of the Week award of 
the season for the week of May 23–29. He hit .583 with 3 HR, 10 RBI, and 
a 14-game hitting streak, including his 400th career home run as a member 
of the White Sox, becoming only the second player in franchise history 
to hit 400 home runs, Frank Thomas being the first.[32] On July 1, 2012, 
Konerko was elected by his peers, along with teammates Adam Dunn, Jake 
Peavy and Chris Sale to the 83rd All-Star Game in Kansas City. It was his 
sixth All-star appearance and his third in three years. Konerko's production 
declined in 2013, hitting .244 with 12 home runs and 54 RBI, his lowest 
number of both home runs and RBI since joining the White Sox. On December 
4, 2013, Konerko re-signed with the White Sox to a one-year, $2.5 million 
contract.[33] On April 23, 2014, Konerko doubled off of Detroit Tigers 
pitcher Justin Miller to break Frank Thomas' franchise total bases record 
with his 3,950th total base.[34] Paul Konerko retired on September 28, 
2014 after spending 18 years in the majors, the last 16 of which were with 
the White Sox.[35] All but 81 of Konerko's 2,348 career MLB games were 
played with the White Sox. Konerko was the last member of the 2005 Champion 
White Sox left on the team at the time of his retirement. It was announced 
on Paul Konerko Day that his number (#14) will be retired and a statue 
of Konerko was revealed by the statue of fellow 2005 teammate Frank Thomas. 
On October 24, 2014, Konerko was named Co-Winner of the Roberto Clemente 
Award, sharing the honor with Jimmy Rollins of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
By winning the award, Konerko became the first member of the White Sox 
to do so. On May 23, 2015 prior to a game against the Minnesota Twins at 
U.S. Cellular Field, Konerko became the 10th White Sox player to have his 
number retired. In May 2016, the White Sox celebrated U.S. Cellular Field's 
25th anniversary by introducing the 25 most memorable moments in the park's 
history. In a bracket style competition, Konerko's grand slam in Game 2 
of the 2005 World Series was voted the best moment in the park's 25-year 
history, as it was deemed as an iconic moment in the breaking of the franchise's 
88 year championship drought.[36] Paul married Jennifer Wells in 2004.
