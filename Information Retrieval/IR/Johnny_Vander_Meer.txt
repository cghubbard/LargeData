John Samuel Vander Meer (November 2, 1914 – October 6, 1997) was an American 
professional baseball player.[1] He played in Major League Baseball as 
a pitcher, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds.[1] Vander Meer was best 
known for being the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw 
two consecutive no-hitters.[2] After the impressive start to his major 
league career, he experienced problems controlling the accuracy of his 
pitching, and his later career was marked by inconsistent performances.[3] 
Born in Prospect Park, New Jersey, he moved with his family to Midland 
Park, New Jersey in 1918.[4] Vander Meer threw left-handed and batted as 
a switch hitter.[1] He had an inauspicious start to his professional baseball 
career. He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent 
in 1933 and assigned to the Dayton Ducks.[5] Dayton then sold his contract 
to a Boston Bees minor league affiliate, the Scranton Miners of the New 
York–Pennsylvania League.[5] The Miners found his playing ability to be 
lacking and sent him to the Cincinnati Reds affiliate, the Nashville Volunteers, 
in a trade for Tiny Chaplin.[5] From Nashville, he was sent to the Durham 
Bulls, where the Bulls manager and catcher, Johnny Gooch, was credited 
with helping control the wildness of Vander Meer's pitching.[5] In 1936, 
he posted a record of 19 wins against six losses for Durham.[6] Vander 
Meer made his major league debut with the Cincinnati Reds on April 22, 
1937 at the age of 22.[1] He won 3 games and lost 4 before being sent back 
the minor leagues with the Syracuse Chiefs for most of the season when 
the Reds recalled him in September.[6] The following year on June 11, 1938, 
Vander Meer pitched a no hitter against the Boston Braves.[7] Four days 
later against the Brooklyn Dodgers in what was the first night game ever 
held at Ebbets Field, he threw another no hitter, becoming the only man 
to ever throw two consecutive no hitters in the major leagues.[8][9] Vander 
Meer's performance earned him the role as the starting pitcher for the 
National League team in the 1938 All-Star game held at Cincinnati's Crosley 
Field.[10] The American League team – having won four of the previous five 
All-Star games – was favored to win the game, but Vander Meer pitched three 
scoreless innings and allowed only one hit, as the National League went 
on to win by a score of 4-1.[10][11] He ended the season with a record 
of 15 wins against 10 losses and a 3.12 earned run average for the fourth 
place Reds. He might have won more games, but spent nearly a month in the 
hospital being treated for boils late in the season.[12] After his impressive 
rookie season, Vander Meer had a disappointing 1939 season, when he fell 
ill during spring training, and then suffered an injury when he slipped 
on a wet pitching mound in Pittsburgh.[12][13] He posted a record of only 
five wins with nine losses and an earned run average of 4.67. Early in 
the 1940 season, he began to experience problems controlling the accuracy 
of his pitches. In June, the Reds released him back to the minor leagues 
where he played for the Indianapolis Indians and produced 6 wins against 
4 losses.[6][14] He returned to the major leagues in September and posted 
a 3-1 record, including a 12 inning victory against Philadelphia on September 
18, that clinched the National League pennant for the Reds.[12][15] In 
the 13th inning, Vander Meer hit a double, advanced to third base on a 
sacrifice fly, then scored the winning run on a squeeze bunt.[16] In the 
1940 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, Vander Meer made only one 
appearance when he entered Game 5 in the fifth inning with the Reds trailing 
by a score of 7-0. He pitched three scoreless innings as the Reds lost 
the game by a score of 8-0.[17] The Reds went on to win the series in seven 
games.[18] It would be the only post-season appearance of Vander Meer's 
career.[19] In 1941, Vander Meer's performance improved somewhat with a 
16-12 record and six shutouts while leading the league with 202 strikeouts. 
On June 6, 1941 in a game against Philadelphia, he allowed only one hit.[20] 
Vander Meer later recalled that the only hit in the game could have been 
ruled an error, as shortstop Eddie Joost fielded the ground ball, then 
dropped it before throwing to first base.[21] He earned his third All-Star 
selection in the 1942 All-Star game, and once again threw three scoreless 
innings in a 3-1 loss to the American League.[22] He finished the 1942 
season with a career-high 18 wins against 12 losses and once again led 
the league in strikeouts. He posted a 15-16 record in 1943 for the second 
place Reds and led the league in strikeouts for a third consecutive year. 
On March 3, 1944, Vander Meer joined the United States Navy and was stationed 
at Sampson Naval Training Station in New York where he would play for the 
Navy baseball team.[23] He was discharged from the Navy in December 1945, 
having lost two years of his major league career to his military service,[24] 
but Vander Meer claimed that his extensive military play made him less 
wild as a pitcher, which his record partially supports.[25] The thirty-one-year-old 
pitcher returned to play for the Reds in 1946 although he was not able 
to recapture his previous form. He produced one more notable season in 
1948 when he won 17 games with 14 losses, before his contract was sold 
to the Chicago Cubs in February 1950.[26] After an ineffective year with 
the Cubs, he was released in March 1951 and was signed as a free agent 
by the Cleveland Indians.[1] He appeared in only one game for the Indians 
on May 7, 1951 before being released on June 30, 1951 at the age of 36.[1] 
Vander Meer was an incidental witness when his Cincinnati team-mate Ewell 
Blackwell almost duplicated his consecutive no-hit feat in 1947, by pitching 
a no-hitter against the Braves, then in his next appearance held the Dodgers 
without a hit until the ninth inning when he gave up two hits.[21] Vander 
Meer returned to the minor leagues where he played for five more seasons 
until the age of 40.[6] In 1952, fourteen years after his consecutive no-hitters, 
Vander Meer pitched a no-hitter for the Tulsa Oilers against the Beaumont 
Roughnecks in the Texas League.[27] A four-time All-Star, Vander Meer compiled 
a 119–121 record with 1,294 strikeouts and a 3.44 ERA in 2,104⅔ innings 
over a thirteen-year Major League career.[1] He had 29 career shutouts.[1] 
Along with Tim Lincecum (2008–10), Randy Johnson (1999–2002), and Warren 
Spahn (1949–52), Vander Meer is one of only four NL pitchers since 1940 
to lead the league in strikeouts in three straight seasons (1941–43).[28] 
Just those four and Dizzy Dean (1932–35) have done it since 1931.[28] After 
retiring as a player at the age of 40, Vander Meer became a minor league 
manager in the Cincinnati Reds organization for ten seasons before retiring 
in 1962.[29] After his retirement from baseball, he worked for a brewing 
company.[12] He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1958.[3] 
He died of an abdominal aneurysm at his home in Tampa, Florida, on October
