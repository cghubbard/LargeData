The 1940 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 58th season in the history 
of the franchise. The team, managed by Doc Prothro, began their third season 
at Shibe Park and were picked by 73 of 76 writers in the pre-season Associated 
Press poll of baseball writers to finish last.[1] The Phillies lost 103 
games and finished last, 50 games behind the pennant-winning Cincinnati 
Reds. In March 1940, the Phillies, along with the St. Louis Browns and 
Boston Bees were made outstanding offers of $5,000,000 by attorney Richard 
Cantillon for one of the teams to move its franchise to Los Angeles. Phillies 
owner Gerald Nugent quickly dismissed the possibility of the Phillies considering 
the move.[2] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters Coaches
