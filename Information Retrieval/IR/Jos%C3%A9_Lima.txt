José Desiderio Rodriguez Lima (September 30, 1972 – May 23, 2010) was a 
Dominican right-handed pitcher who spent thirteen seasons in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) with the Detroit Tigers (1994-1996, 2001-2002), Houston 
Astros (1997-2001), Kansas City Royals (2003, 2005), Los Angeles Dodgers 
(2004) and New York Mets (2006). His best year in the majors was 1999, 
when he won 21 games for the Astros and pitched in his only All-Star Game. 
A flamboyant free spirit, he was best known for coining all his pitching 
appearances as Lima Time. His remarkably animated displays of emotion on 
the mound made him a fan favorite, but also drew the ire of opposing teams. 
He was known for his flamboyant celebrations after his victories in the 
face of opponents.[1] Due to his indulging in musical pursuits beyond baseball, 
he was once described by The New York Times sportswriter Ben Shpigel as 
"the national anthem-crooning, towel-waving merengue singer who moonlights 
as a right-handed pitcher".[2][3] Lima made his Major League debut with 
the Detroit Tigers on April 20, 1994, at age 21 making a start against 
the Kansas City Royals. After three years in Detroit, he was traded to 
the Houston Astros on December 10, 1996, in an eight-player trade. In 1999 
he complied a record of 21–10 and was named to the National League All 
Star Team that season. However, after the 1999 season, Lima struggled to 
recapture his success and surrendered a league-leading 48 home runs, which 
was only two short of the single season record held by Bert Blyleven, and 
lost 16 games. On June 23, 2001, Lima was traded back to Detroit in exchange 
for Dave Mlicki. He was released by Detroit during the 2002 season, proclaiming 
at the time, "If I can't pitch on this team—the worst or second-worst team 
in baseball—where am I going to pitch? If I can't start on this ballclub, 
I must be the worst pitcher on Earth." He pitched for the Newark Bears 
in the Independent Atlantic League early in 2003, but returned to MLB in 
June 2003, when he was acquired by the Kansas City Royals. Lima started 
off fast in Kansas City, he was 7–0 with a 2.17 ERA after eight starts. 
But a groin injury during his ninth start caused his performance to decline 
significantly and he went 1–3 with a 10.65 ERA in his last six starts. 
He joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2004. With the Dodgers, Lima was 13–5 
with a 4.07 ERA, his best performance since the 1999 season. Possibly the 
best moment of his career came on October 9, 2004, in Game Three of the 
2004 National League Division Series, when he pitched a 5-hit shutout against 
the St. Louis Cardinals. It was the Dodgers' first post-season victory 
since Game Five of the 1988 World Series. In 2005, he returned to Kansas 
City as a free agent but managed only to compile a record of 5–16, while 
posting a 6.99 ERA and was not re-signed by the club. On February 14, 2006, 
Lima was inked to a minor league deal by the Mets and pitched for the Mets' 
AAA affiliate, the Norfolk Tides. He was called up to the Mets on May 7, 
2006, and went 0–3 with an 8.79 ERA in three starts before being designated 
for assignment for Tyler Schueck on May 20, 2006. On July 4, 2006, he was 
again called up again to the Mets, when Heath Bell was optioned back to 
the Norfolk Tides.[4] Lima had another poor outing on July 7, 2006, against 
the Florida Marlins which included surrendering up a grand slam to opposing 
pitcher Dontrelle Willis and was removed from the game. After the game 
Lima was designated for assignment back to the Norfolk Tides for the second 
time during the 2006 season. Lima finished the 2006 season with a 0–4 record 
with a 9.87 ERA in four total starts for the Mets. In the Dominican Winter 
Baseball League, he played for the Águilas Cibaeñas. In 2007, Lima also 
played for Saraperos de Saltillo in the Mexican League. For the 2008 season, 
Lima signed with the Kia Tigers, a nine-time champion in the Korea Professional 
Baseball. Despite high expectations as a former Major League Baseball pitcher, 
Lima struggled in several starts. After that, he was sent down to the Korea 
Baseball Futures League, and media reported that Lima would be released 
from the Tigers. However, after returning to the Tigers, Lima got two consecutive 
wins against the Woori Heroes by pitching seven innings while not allowing 
a single run, and the Hanwha Eagles, pitching five innings and allowing 
just three runs, but was still released by the Tigers. Lima signed with 
the Long Beach Armada of the independent Golden Baseball League (GBL) on 
March 27, 2009. He was to play under veteran minor league manager and former 
major league all-star Garry Templeton. Lima was traded by the Armada to 
the Edmonton Capitals for former Chicago White Sox first-round draft pick 
Kris Honel on July 31, 2009.[5] During a May visit to Edmonton with the 
Long Beach Armada, Lima was heartily embraced by the Capitals' fans and 
even had a local fan club develop at the ballpark—a first ever for a visiting 
player there. He pitched a total of four games for the Capitals, going 
1–2 in the regular season and losing his only GBL playoff appearance.[6] 
Lima made statements in his native Dominican Republic that he would possibly 
pursue a career as a singer after his baseball career was over; specifically 
in the genre of bachata.[7] He also had two sons. Lima died on the morning 
of May 23, 2010, at age 37. He was rushed to Huntington Memorial Hospital, 
where he was pronounced dead.[1][2] An autopsy did not determine the cause 
of death, but stated that due to the condition of his heart, he likely 
died of a cardiac arrhythmia.[8] He had suffered from cardiac problems. 
His wife said he complained of excess gas the night before but she thought 
he was just having a nightmare.[9][10] On July 12, 2010, David Ortiz paid 
tribute to his late friend by dedicating his All-Star Home Run Derby win
