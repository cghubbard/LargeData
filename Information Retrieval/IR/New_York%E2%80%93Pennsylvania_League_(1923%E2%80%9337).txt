The New York–Pennsylvania League of 1923 through 1937 was an American minor 
league baseball circuit. The forerunner to the modern Class AA Eastern 
League, it was a Class B circuit through 1932 and upgraded to Class A for 
the final five seasons of its existence. It is actually the second of three 
leagues to bear the name. The original NY-P League played for one season, 
in 1891. In 1957, the PONY League changed its name to the New York–Penn 
League and has operated under that identity since, beginning as a Class 
D loop and now as a Short Season A league. The NY-PL's longest-tenured 
franchises during the 1923–37 period included Binghamton, a New York Yankees 
affiliate, Elmira, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and Williamsport, all of which 
were members for the league's 15-year existence. When Hartford, Connecticut, 
entered the loop in 1938, the NY–PL adopted the Eastern League name, and 
has operated under that identity since. (Previous editions of the Eastern 
League had existed from 1883–86, 1892–1911 and 1916–32. The second incarnation 
of the EL changed its name in 1912 to the current International League.)
