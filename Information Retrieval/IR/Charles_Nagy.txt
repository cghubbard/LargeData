As player As coach Charles Harrison Nagy (born May 5, 1967) is an American 
former Major League Baseball All-Star right-handed pitcher who played for 
14 seasons in the major leagues from 1990 to 2003. He played for the Cleveland 
Indians and San Diego Padres. He served as the pitching coach for the Arizona 
Diamondbacks from 2011 to 2013. He currently serves as the pitching coach 
for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Nagy was born on May 5, 1967, in 
Bridgeport, Connecticut. He is of Hungarian ancestry.[1] As a young boy, 
he lived for a few years in St. Petersburg, Florida, where he played Little 
League and was coached by his uncle, Sanford Harrison. Nagy attended Roger 
Ludlowe High School in Fairfield, Connecticut,[2] where he starred in baseball 
and football. Nagy attended the University of Connecticut. Playing for 
the Huskies, he ranked second and eighth all-time for strikeouts in a single 
season (113, 81)[3] and fifth for his career (194). His single-season marks 
for the Huskies (entering the 2011 season) include tied for third in complete 
games (8), tied for sixth in saves (4), and 17th in innings pitched (86.1).[4] 
He was the first Huskies player drafted in the first round[5] and the first 
to be named the BIG EAST Pitcher of the Year, which he won twice (for the 
1987 and 1988 seasons).[6] Nagy was a member of the Team USA Baseball that 
competed in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea as a demonstration 
sport. Nagy made 19 appearances for Team USA, going 3-1 with a 1.05 ERA 
and a team-leading six saves. He appeared in two games in the Olympics, 
pitching 2.0 innings and earning a save.[4] Team USA defeated defending 
champion Japan to win the tournament and win individual gold medals, however, 
since baseball was a demonstration sport, the medals did not count in the 
respective nations' medal totals. Nagy was taken in the first round as 
17th overall pick by the Cleveland Indians during the 1988 Major League 
Baseball draft amateur draft. He was second of three first round picks 
selected, sandwiched between SS Mark Lewis and pitcher Jeff Mutis. Being 
a successful college pitcher, Nagy skipped several levels and was assigned 
to the Kinston Indians, the Cleveland "High A" affiliate in the Carolina 
League. He posted an 8-4 record and 1.51 earned run average (ERA) with 
99 strikeouts in 95.1 innings over 13 starts. He was quickly promoted to 
Canton–Akron Indians, the Double-A affiliate in the Eastern League. Nagy 
finish with a 4-5 record and a 3.35 ERA in 15 starts. After the season, 
Baseball America rated him as the #27 prospect. Nagy returned to the so-called 
"little Indians" for the start of the 1990 season, where he went 13-8 with 
a 2.52 ERA in 23 starts. He was soon called up to Cleveland, a hapless 
club that would finish 4th in AL East (77-85) and was in desperate need 
of starting pitching. He made his big league debut on June 29, 1990, a 
7-2 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He would end with a 2-4 
record and a 5.91 ERA in 9 starts. In 1991, he finished 10-15 with a 4.13 
ERA, and tied for eighth in the American League Rookie of the Year Award 
for 1991. On August 8, 1992, he threw a complete game one-hitter against 
the Baltimore Orioles, with just two walks and giving up a single in the 
seventh. 1992 was possibly Nagy's best year statatistically as he finished 
the season with an impressive 2.96 ERA with a career high 252.0 innings 
pitched, he also amassed a .630 win percent with a 17-10 record despite 
the 1992 Indians low win percent of .469. He also pitched 10 complete games 
and pitched three of out of his six career shutouts that year while making 
his first all star appearance. On May 15, 1993, Nagy left a game against 
the Milwaukee Brewers with a shoulder injury after pitching to just two 
batters. He was a miserable 2-6 at that point and undergo surgery for a 
torn labrum on June 29, shutting him down for the 1993 season. He rebounded 
in 1994 with a respectable 10-8 record with a 3.45 ERA during the strike-shortened 
season. During the 1995 season, Nagy led the staff with a 16-6 and a 4.55 
ERA, as the Indians returned to the World Series for the first time since 
1954. He pitched well in the division and league championship series, giving 
up two earned runs in 15 innings, but surrendered five earned runs in seven 
innings in game 3 of the 1995 World Series. The next year, 1996, was arguably 
his best season, ended 17-5 and a 3.41 ERA, and he finished fourth in the 
Cy Young Award voting. In the 1997 World Series, Nagy was the game 3 starter. 
He gave up 5 earned runs in six innings. In game 7, after a blown save 
by closer José Mesa, manager Mike Hargrove was forced to bring in Nagy, 
the starter with the team's most wins during the regular season (15), in 
the 10th inning to try to mop up. In the bottom of the 11th inning, Nagy 
gave up a bases-loaded single to Edgar Rentería that appeared to graze 
off his outstretched glove to end the game and the series, pinning Nagy 
with the loss. During this period from 1995 through 1999, Nagy was the 
workhorse of the Tribe pitching staff, amassing 15 or more wins each season, 
a feat only matched by Greg Maddux. However, Nagy was placed on the disabled 
list (DL) on May 16, 2000, snapping a streak of 192 consecutive starts 
dating back to October 3, 1993. On May 19, 2000, he underwent arthroscopic 
surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow. He returned to make three 
starts in September, but was shut down after three losses and persistent 
pain.[7] He would get just 6 more wins from 2001 through 2003. Despite 
a solid spring training and not missing a turn in the spring rotation, 
Nagy started the 2001 season on the disabled list, as the Indians felt 
he needed to build strength in his surgically repaired elbow.[8] He did 
not come off of the DL on June 1.[9] Nagy's last season, 2003, was with 
the San Diego Padres. He finished 6th on the Tribe's all-time strikeout 
leader list (1,235),[10] 10th in wins (129), and 11th in innings pitched 
(1,942.1).[11] He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 2004, and the Cleveland Indians Team Hall of Fame on August 
11, 2007. In 2009, Nagy was named the pitching coach of the Cleveland Indians' 
AAA team, the Columbus Clippers.[12] On October 26, 2010, Nagy was named 
pitching coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks.[13][14] He was fired on October 
7, 2013. In February 2015, Nagy was hired again by the Cleveland Indians 
as Special Assistant to Player Development along with Travis Hafner and 
John McDonald.[15][16] On November 2, 2015, Nagy was named the pitching 
coach of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[17] Nagy and his wife, Jacquelyn 
"Jackie", have two daughters, Makaela and Lily. They live outside of San 
Diego in Rancho Santa Fe, California.[14] Nagy established an endowed baseball
