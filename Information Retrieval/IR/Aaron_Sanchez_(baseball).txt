Aaron Jacob Sanchez (born July 1, 1992) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was 
drafted by the Blue Jays in the first round of the 2010 Major League Baseball 
draft, and made his MLB debut on July 23, 2014. In 2015, Sanchez was ranked 
by MLB as the number 3 prospect in the Blue Jays' organization,[1] and 
the 44th best prospect in baseball.[2] Sanchez was born in Barstow, California, 
to Lynn Shipley (née Gesky). She left Aaron's biological father, Frank 
Sanchez, while pregnant with him.[3] Lynn later married Mike Shipley, who 
was drafted in the fourth round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft 
by the California Angels.[4] Shipley's pitching career ended when he suffered 
a left shoulder injury, and he took a coaching position at Barstow Community 
College.[5] Sanchez attended Barstow High School, where he posted a 7–0 
win-loss record, 0.73 earned run average (ERA), and 104 strikeouts in 57 
2⁄3 innings pitched. He also batted .403 with five home runs.[6] Sanchez 
was drafted by Toronto in the first round (34th selection overall) of the 
2010 Major League Baseball draft.[7] He spent the 2010 season with the 
Gulf Coast League Blue Jays and the New York–Penn League Auburn Doubledays, 
posting a combined record of 0–3 with a 2.16 ERA and 37 strikeouts through 
10 starts.[8] In 2011, Sanchez split time with the Bluefield Blue Jays 
of the Appalachian League and the Vancouver Canadians of the Northwest 
League, compiling a record of 3–3 with an ERA of 5.30 and 56 strikeouts 
through 14 appearances, 9 of which were starts.[8] Sanchez spent the 2012 
season with the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts, pitching to an 8–5 record, 2.49 
ERA, and 97 strikeouts in 90 1⁄3 innings.[8] On January 29, 2013, Sanchez 
was named number 35 on MLB's Top 100 Prospects list.[9] On July 26, 2013, 
Sanchez was ranked number 24 on MLB's revised Top 100 Prospects list, and 
the number 1 prospect in the Blue Jays organization.[10][11] He spent the 
2013 minor league season with the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays, posting 
a 4–5 win–loss record, 3.34 ERA, and 75 strikeouts in 86 1⁄3 innings. He 
played for the Salt River Rafters of the Arizona Fall League after the 
minor league season ended, and posted a 1.16 ERA in 6 starts for the team.[8] 
In February 2014, Sanchez was ranked as the 32nd best prospect in baseball 
by Baseball America.[12] He attended 2014 spring training and was sent 
to the minor league camp on March 22.[13] Sanchez went to Montreal with 
the Blue Jays for a two-game exhibition series on March 28 and 29 against 
the New York Mets and was the pitcher of record in the second game.[14] 
In 2014 spring training, Sanchez pitched to a 2–0 record with a 0.00 ERA. 
He started the 2014 season with the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats, 
and was promoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on June 12.[15] He struggled 
with control, issuing 17 walks in 32 1⁄3 Triple-A innings, and on July 
17, it was announced that he would be moved to the bullpen.[16] On July 
22, he was called up to the Major League club.[17] On July 22, 2014, it 
was announced that Sanchez had been promoted to the Toronto Blue Jays to 
pitch out of the bullpen.[18] He made his debut on July 23, pitching 2 
innings and recording 2 strikeouts against the Boston Red Sox.[19] On July 
27, Sanchez earned his first Major League win, pitching 2 innings against 
the New York Yankees. On August 30, he recorded his first major league 
save, pitching 2 innings and preserving a 2–0 lead over the Yankees.[20] 
Sanchez made 24 appearances for the Blue Jays in 2014, and posted a 2–2 
record with a 1.09 ERA, 27 strikeouts, 3 saves, and a 0.70 WHIP in 33 innings 
pitched.[21] Heading into the 2015 season, Sanchez was expected to pitch 
out of the bullpen, and to compete for the closer role. After Marcus Stroman 
suffered a torn left ACL on March 10, Sanchez pitched in the rotation for 
the rest of spring training and earned the fifth starter spot to open the 
season.[22] He recorded his first win as a starter on April 22, defeating 
the Baltimore Orioles 4–2. Sanchez pitched 5 1⁄3 innings and yielded two 
runs on two hits and seven walks with four strikeouts. In winning, he became 
the first Toronto pitcher to win despite issuing seven walks since Jeff 
Ware in 1995.[23] On May 8, Sanchez shutout the Boston Red Sox over seven 
innings, recording his first quality start. The Blue Jays would win the 
game 7–0.[24] On June 5, he pitched into the ninth inning against the Houston 
Astros and took the win, 6–2. In addition to setting a career-high in innings 
pitched, Sanchez did not walk a batter for the first time as a starter.[25] 
After missing his next scheduled start with upper body soreness, Sanchez 
was placed on the disabled list on June 14, retroactive to June 6, with 
a strained lat muscle.[26] On July 19, manager John Gibbons announced that, 
upon his return from the disabled list, Sanchez would pitch out of the 
bullpen.[27] He was activated on July 25 in Seattle. Sanchez was ejected 
from a game against the Kansas City Royals on August 2, for hitting Alcides 
Escobar with a pitch after home plate umpire Jim Wolf had issued a warning 
in the first inning. MLB deemed it intentional, and he was suspended for 
3 games on August 4.[28] Sanchez made 11 starts in the 2015 regular season 
and 30 relief appearances, earning a 7–6 record, 3.22 ERA, and 61 strikeouts 
in 92 1⁄3 innings.[21] He appeared in all five games of the Division Series 
against the Texas Rangers, and did not allow a run in 5 1⁄3 innings pitched. 
In the Championship Series played against the Kansas City Royals, Sanchez 
made four scoreless relief appearances as the Blue Jays were eliminated 
from the postseason in six games.[21] Sanchez stated before the start of 
the 2016 season that he wanted to be in the starting rotation, and had 
taken part in an intensive off-season workout program with teammate Marcus 
Stroman.[29] He entered spring training in competition for the fifth starter 
role with Gavin Floyd, Drew Hutchison, and Jesse Chavez. On March 28, John 
Gibbons announced that Sanchez would begin the 2016 season in the starting 
rotation, but insinuated that he would be held to an innings-limit that 
may move him to the bullpen later in the season. To that point in the spring, 
Sanchez had thrown 20 innings, yielding only three runs and three walks 
while striking out 19.[30] Sanchez carried a 9–1 record into the All-Star 
break, and on July 9, he was named to the 2016 All-Star Game as a replacement 
for Craig Kimbrel.[31] On July 25, Sanchez won his 10th consecutive decision, 
defeating the San Diego Padres. In doing so, he became the first Blue Jay 
since Roy Halladay in 2003 to win at least 10 consecutive decisions.[32] 
In his start on July 31, Sanchez threw seven innings and surpassed his 
career-high of 133 1⁄3 innings pitched, raising his 2016 total to 139 1⁄3.[33] 
Prior to the trade deadline, the Blue Jays acquired Francisco Liriano from 
the Pittsburgh Pirates, and it was widely believed that Liriano would take 
Sanchez's place in the starting rotation and allow Sanchez to be moved 
to the bullpen, to better limit his workload in the 2016 season. Several 
members of the team and media, including Russell Martin and Hall-of-Famer 
John Smoltz, expressed their desire to see Sanchez remain in the rotation.[34] 
Entering August, Sanchez had an American League leading 2.71 ERA.[35] After 
meeting with Sanchez, John Gibbons, and pitching coach Pete Walker, general 
manager Ross Atkins announced on August 4 that Sanchez would remain a starter, 
and that the team would use a six-man rotation.[36] Sanchez started against 
the Cleveland Indians on August 20, and was optioned to the Advanced-A 
Dunedin Blue Jays the following day in order to skip his next start.[37] 
Sanchez was recalled on August 31.[38] He lasted just 3 2⁄3 innings in 
his start on September 11, leaving due to a blister on his pitching hand.[39] 
Sanchez's next start was skipped to allow his blister to heal, and he returned 
to the rotation on September 21. Sanchez earned his 15th win of the season 
on October 2, lowering his earned run average to 3.00 and earning him the 
American League ERA title. The win also clinched the first AL Wild Card 
position.[40] Sanchez closed the 2016 regular season with a 15–2 record, 
3.00 ERA, and 161 strikeouts in 192 innings pitched.[21] He started the 
third game of the Division Series against the Texas Rangers, and allowed 
six earned runs in 5 2⁄3 innings. Toronto would win the game in extra innings, 
7–6, and eliminate the Rangers from the postseason for the second consecutive 
season. In the Championship Series, Sanchez started Game 4 and gave the 
Blue Jays their only win of the series, pitching six innings and allowing 
only two hits and one earned run to the Cleveland Indians.[21] On October 
25, general manager Ross Atkins stated that the organization would not 
limit Sanchez's innings in the 2017 season.[41] Sanchez finished seventh 
in voting for the 2016 American League Cy Young Award, receiving a third 
place vote and three fifth place votes.[42] Sanchez is believed to be the 
first MLB player born in Barstow. After his debut and successful first 
season, Barstow City Council declared October 20, 2014, to be "Aaron Sanchez
