The 1922 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 41st season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 31st season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
85â€“69 during the season and finished 3rd in the National League. The club, 
just as it was preparing to leave for spring training, lost Bill "Pickles" 
Dillhoefer, a backup catcher, who died of pneumonia on February 23. The 
1922 season was one of the productive seasons in the career of Rogers Hornsby. 
He became the only player in history to hit over 40 home runs and bat over 
.400 in the same season. Hornsby won the triple crown, leading the league 
in almost every batting category including batting average (.401), home 
runs (42, a National League record at the time), RBI (152), slugging average 
(.722, another record at the time), on-base percentage (.459), doubles 
(46), hits (250, again the highest in National League history to that point), 
and runs scored (141). His 450 total bases was the highest mark for any 
National League player during the 20th century. Hornsby also produced in 
the field, leading the league in putouts, double plays, and fielding percentage.
