Power hitter is a term used in baseball for a skilled player that has a 
higher than average ability in terms of his batting, featuring a combination 
of dexterity and personal strength that likely leads to a high number of 
home-runs as well as doubles and triples. In terms of detailed analysis, 
looking at a player's ability as a power hitter often involves using statistics 
such as someone's 'slugging percentage' (a function that's calculated by 
evaluating someone's number of moments at bat in relation to the nature 
of their hits and strikes). 'Isolated Power' (ISO), a measure showing the 
number of extra bases earned per time at bat that's calculated by subtracting 
someone's batting average from his slugging percentage, is another statistic 
used.[2] The concept generally is analogous to that of a power pitcher, 
a player who relies on the velocity of his pitches (perhaps at the expense 
of accuracy) and a high record of strikeout associated with them (statistics 
such as strikeouts per nine innings pitched are common measures). Barry 
Bonds, who set the record* for the most home runs in a season than any 
other player in Major League Baseball history, is often cited as a power 
hitter. His career, while featuring many high points, ended up being bogged 
down in issues regarding performance enhancing drugs. Still, he managed 
a total of 762* home runs while also earning a comparatively high ISO compared 
to his rivals, with the publication Business Insider labeling him #3 in 
a list of the greatest power hitters of all time.[2] Other baseball figures 
so cited include the famous hitters Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Ted Williams.[2] 
Popular newspaper writer Victor O. Jones wrote about Williams in particular, 
"Ted is lucky to come along in a baseball age that worships on the shrine
