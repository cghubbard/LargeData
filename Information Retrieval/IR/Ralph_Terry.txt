Ralph Willard Terry (born January 9, 1936) is an American former right-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball. Terry is perhaps best known as the MVP 
of the 1962 World Series, and for giving up the walk-off home run to Bill 
Mazeroski that enabled the Pittsburgh Pirates to win the 1960 World Series. 
Terry was born in Big Cabin, Oklahoma and attended Chelsea High School 
and Missouri State University.[1] Terry played for the Independence Indians 
in the Ban Johnson League in 1953. The home field for the Independence 
Indians was Shulthis Stadium in Independence, Kansas. The stadium is the 
same one that Mickey Mantle started his career at with the Independence 
Yankees in 1949.[2] Terry made his major league debut in 1956, going 1-2 
in three games played in his rookie season. The following year, he appeared 
in seven games, making two starts, before being traded to the Kansas City 
Athletics on June 15.[3] Terry finished the 1957 season 4-11 in 19 starts 
for the Athletics. He rebounded somewhat the next season, going 11-13 in 
40 games, including 33 starts. In 1959, he started 2-4 with a 5.24 ERA 
in 9 games. On May 26 of that year, he was traded to the New York Yankees 
along with Hector Lopez.[4] Upon his return, Terry went 3-7 with a 3.39 
ERA in 24 games, including 16 starts. His career began to take off in 1960, 
when he posted a 10-8 record and 3.40 ERA. That year, he made his first 
postseason appearance, in two games of the 1960 World Series. He was 0-2 
with a 5.40 ERA in the two games, one start and one relief appearance, 
and gave up Bill Mazeroski's walk-off homerun in Game Seven.[5] In 1961, 
Terry posted a 16-3 record with a 3.15 ERA in 31 games (27 starts). In 
the 1961 World Series, he was 0-1 with a 4.82 ERA in two starts, but won 
his first championship when the Yankees defeated the Cincinnati Reds in 
five games. Terry's finest season was 1962, where he went 23-12 with a 
3.19 ERA. That year, he posted career bests with 23 wins, 39 starts, 298.2 
innings pitched, and 176 strikeouts against 57 walks. His 23 victories 
led the American League. Returning to the World Series, he went 2-1 with 
a 1.80 ERA and 16 strikeouts in 25 innings over three games against the 
San Francisco Giants. His performance earned him the World Series MVP award 
that season.[6][7] The next year, Terry was 17-15 with a 3.22 ERA in 37 
games, including a career-high 18 complete games. He pitched three innings 
in the 1963 World Series against the Dodgers, finishing with a 3.00 ERA, 
as the Yankees were swept in four games.[8] In 1964, Terry went 7-11 with 
a 4.54 ERA. In that year's World Series against the Cardinals, he gave 
up two hits and struck out three batters as the Yankees lost. On October 
21, Terry was traded to the Cleveland Indians as a player to be named later 
for Pedro Ramos.[9] In his only season in Cleveland, Terry posted an 11–6 
with a 3.69 ERA in 30 games, (26 starts). On April 6, 1966 he was traded 
to the Kansas City Athletics for John O'Donoghue and cash.[10] The book 
"Portrait of a Franchise: An Intimate Look at Cleveland Indians Baseball 
During the Rockin' Sixties" by Doug Kurkul notes that Terry held out in 
a contract dispute in the spring of 1966, prompting Gabe Paul to trade 
him to the A's. A profile of Terry is included in the book. Terry started 
15 games for the Athletics in 1966, where he went 1–5 with a 3.80 ERA. 
On August 6, his contract with purchased by the New York Mets. With the 
Mets in 1966, Terry went 0-1 with a 4.74 ERA in 11 games, six as a reliever. 
In 1967, Terry pitched in just two games, and finished one, before being 
released on May 16. He subsequently retired. In his career, Terry had 257 
games started, 75 games finished, 20 shutouts, 11 saves, and 446 bases 
on balls in 1,849 innings pitched. In five World Series (1960–64), Terry 
posted a record of 2–3, 31 strikeouts and a 2.93 ERA. Both wins came in 
the 1962 World Series against the San Francisco Giants, including a 1–0 
shutout in Game 7 over Giant ace Jack Sanford. That game—and thus the Series—ended 
with Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson catching Willie McCovey's line 
drive. After baseball, Terry became a professional golfer. He won the 1980 
Midwest PGA Championship and based on his status as a PGA of America sectional 
champion, he qualified for and played in four PGA Tour events in 1981 and 
1982. In 1986, he started playing on the Senior PGA Tour. His best finish 
was a tie for 10th at the 1989 Showdown Classic. He often appears at Yankees' 
Old-Timers' Day. Terry has for several years, lived in Larned, Kansas, 
where he was in the insurance business for a number of years and is now
