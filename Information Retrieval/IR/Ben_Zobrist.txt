Benjamin Thomas Zobrist (/ˈzoʊbrɪst/; born May 26, 1981), nicknamed Zorilla, 
is an American professional baseball second baseman for the Chicago Cubs 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays / Rays, his first MLB club and where he spend the majority of 
his career, and briefly for the Oakland Athletics and Kansas City Royals. 
A two-time World Series champion in consecutive seasons of 2015 with the 
Royals and 2016 with Cubs, Zobrist was the 2016 World Series Most Valuable 
Player. A versatile defender and a switch-hitter with a high walk rate,[1] 
Zobrist has played roughly half his innings at second base, and has also 
spent significant time at shortstop and in right field.[2] Thus, he has 
been often been referred to as a "super utility player".[3][4] Zobrist 
was born and raised in Eureka, Illinois, by his parents Cynthia "Cindi" 
(née Cali) and Tom Zobrist, senior pastor of Liberty Bible Church in Eureka.[5][6] 
Zobrist played baseball starting when he was eight years old; he and his 
friends built their own wiffle ball field behind his house. Zobrist attended 
Eureka High School, graduating in 2001. After no professional scouts or 
college recruiters considered him by the time he graduated, Zobrist thought 
baseball was over for him. "Baseball was not even a thought in my mind", 
Zobrist said, "When I was done with my last high school game, I was driving 
around town just thinking I'm done with baseball the rest of my life." 
Zobrist planned to attend Calvary Bible College in Kansas City, Missouri, 
but Zobrist's high school coach encouraged him to spend $50 to participate 
in an annual summer event that showcased seniors in Peoria, Illinois.[7] 
He played in the showcase, and was given an offer to play college baseball 
at Olivet Nazarene University, which he accepted. In his time at Olivet, 
he pitched and also played at shortstop and second base. He transferred 
to Dallas Baptist University for his senior year, where he played shortstop.[8] 
Zobrist played in Wausau, Wisconsin, for the Wisconsin Woodchucks of the 
Summer Collegiate Northwoods League in 2003. He was voted team MVP and 
led his team to the League Championship.[9] Zobrist was drafted by the 
Houston Astros as a shortstop in the sixth round of the 2004 Major League 
Baseball draft. With right-handed pitcher Mitch Talbot, Zobrist was traded 
to the Tampa Bay Rays for first baseman/designated hitter Aubrey Huff and 
cash on July 12, 2006.[10] He made his major league debut with Tampa Bay 
on August 1, 2006.[11] Zobrist exclusively played shortstop in his first 
two seasons with Tampa Bay. He struggled through parts of the 2006 and 
2007 seasons with the Rays. One day he met a "swing mechanic" (batting 
coach) looking for students. The swing coach was able to help Zobrist, 
and it was evident to the Rays during the 2008 season. "He added the power 
component", Rays executive vice president Andrew Friedman said, "He became 
a lot more physical."[8] For the most part, Zobrist was used as a right 
fielder and a back-up shortstop during the 2008 season. In certain situations 
where a fifth infielder was needed, he or Melvin Upton, Jr. (a former infielder 
himself) would be moved in from the outfield during the season. Zobrist 
went to his first World Series as a player with the Rays in 2008. His versatility 
was showcased during Game 3 of the 2008 World Series against the National 
League champion Philadelphia Phillies when he came in as part of a double 
switch to play right field. However, Zobrist initially played unusually 
shallow, in essence becoming a fifth infielder. Zobrist was placed in right 
field for the beginning of the 2009 season, and was made the starting second 
baseman after teammate Akinori Iwamura was injured. Zobrist hit three grand 
slams in 2009, leading the Rays, and was among the league leaders in slugging 
percentage. He earned a trip to his first All Star Game in St. Louis in 
2009.[12] The Tampa Bay Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of 
America named him MVP of the Rays for 2009.[13] Zobrist led all hitters 
in the majors in 2009 for wins above replacement with 8.6, ahead of Albert 
Pujols' 8.4 WAR.[14] On April 23, 2010, Zobrist and the Rays agreed to 
a three-year contract extension through the 2013 season, with a team option 
for 2014 and 2015, a deal potentially worth $30 million.[15] In 2010, Zobrist 
batted .238, with a .353 slugging percentage.[16] On April 28, 2011, Zobrist 
collected a Tampa Bay Rays record eight RBIs in a 15–3 rout of the Minnesota 
Twins.[17] Another game was held during the day to make up for a previously 
rained out game and Zobrist drove in another two runs, making a total 10 
RBIs for the day.[citation needed] Zobrist led the American League in WAR 
with 8.8, ahead of MVP Justin Verlander and MVP runner up Jacoby Ellsbury[18] 
During the 2012 season, Zobrist's skills were used at multiple positions. 
He played 47 games at shortstop, the most since his rookie season. He was 
also used as an outfielder and second baseman.[19] He finished the year 
with 20 home runs, accomplishing the feat for the second time in a row.[citation 
needed] On April 8, 2013, Zobrist became the strikeout victim on the disputed 
call that led to Joe Nathan's 300th career save. On July 5, 2013, Zobrist 
was named an All Star for the second time of his career.[20] He finished 
the year with a .275 batting average, his highest since 2009.[citation 
needed] On September 10, Zobrist got his 1,000th career hit, vs the New 
York Yankees in Yankee Stadium.[citation needed] On January 10, 2015, Zobrist 
was traded to the Oakland Athletics with teammate Yunel Escobar in exchange 
for John Jaso, Daniel Robertson, and Boog Powell.[21] On opening day with 
the Athletics, Zobrist hit a two-run homer in his first at-bat. On April 
25, 2015, it was revealed that Zobrist had a torn medial meniscus in his 
left knee, putting him on the 15-day disabled list.[22] The knee required 
surgery, keeping Zobrist out of action for 4–6 weeks.[23] On July 28, 2015, 
Zobrist was traded to the Kansas City Royals for Sean Manaea and Aaron 
Brooks.[24] He played 59 games in the regular season for Kansas City and 
finished with a batting average of .284, with 7 home runs, 37 runs scored, 
and 23 RBIs.[25] The Royals won the AL Central Division and played the 
Houston Astros for the ALDS with Zobrist starting in all five games. The 
Royals advanced to the World Series after defeating the Toronto Blue Jays 
in six games to become the American League Champions. The Royals won the 
2015 World Series after defeating the New York Mets in four of the five 
games. Zobrist played second base and batted second in every game of the 
2015 Royals postseason. He hit .303 in the 2015 postseason with 66 at bats, 
15 runs scored, 20 hits, 2 home runs, and 6 RBIs.[26] On December 8, 2015, 
Zobrist agreed to a four-year, $56 million contract with the Chicago Cubs. 
The signing reunited him with Joe Maddon, his manager back in Tampa Bay.[27] 
In Game 4 of the 2016 National League Division Series against the San Francisco 
Giants with the Cubs having a 2-1 series lead, Zobrist drove in Kris Bryant 
to score the first run in the top of the ninth and later scored the tying 
run on a two-run single by Willson Contreras. The Cubs scored another run 
later that inning, sending them to the National League Championship Series.[28] 
Following the Cubs' Game 7 victory in the 2016 World Series, after driving 
in the first of two go-ahead runs in the top of the 10th inning, he was 
named the World Series Most Valuable Player.[29] Zobrist is an above-average 
hitter with a career slash line of .264/.354/.429, wRC+ of 118, and walk 
rate of 12.5%.[1] He is also an above-average baserunner, who has 102 stolen 
bases at a success rate of 74%.[1][30] Zobrist is also noted for his defensive 
versatility.[3][4] He has played over 4,200 defensive innings at second 
base, over 2,200 in right field, over 1,700 at shortstop, and over 500 
innings at other outfield positions. Zobrist has been rated by UZR as a 
significantly above-average defender at second and in right, and a marginally 
below-average defender at shortstop.[2] His nickname, "Zorilla," was given 
to him by his manager Joe Maddon while playing for the Rays in 2009.[10][31] 
Zobrist lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with his wife, Christian singer 
Julianna Zobrist, and their children, a son, Zion Benjamin, born on February 
1, 2009,[32] and two daughters, Kruse Allegra, born on September 19, 2011,[33] 
and Blaise Royal, who was born on November 6, 2015, five days after Zobrist's 
Royals won the 2015 World Series.[34] During the World Series, Royals fans 
were concerned that Ben Zobrist would leave the World Series if his wife 
began going into labor. Julianna delighted Royals fans by telling her husband 
to keep playing even if she went into labor.[35] Blaise Royal Zobrist's 
middle name pays homage to her father's World Series-winning Royals.[36] 
Zobrist is a former counselor for Camp of Champions USA, a Christian summer 
day camp in central Illinois.[37] Zobrist often talks about his Christian 
faith, claiming that God helped him realize that he was supposed to play 
baseball. "I just felt like everything fell into place so much, that this 
is what I was supposed to do. This is what I was made to do."[38] He and 
former teammate Gabe Gross have talked about how they organize Bible studies 
with their teammates.[39] St. Pete Times writer Mark Topkin wrote how Zobrist 
does this with his teammates, saying Zobrist "doesn't judge or proselytize, 
refraining from forcing his beliefs on anyone, though willing to get involved 
if asked."[40] In the 2013 film Ring The Bell, released by Provident Films, 
Ben plays himself in a cameo role alongside Rick Sutcliffe, John Kruk, 
Mark Hall (also playing themselves), Ryan Scharoun, Ashley Anderson McCarthy,
