In baseball, an out occurs when the umpire rules a batter or baserunner 
out. When three outs are recorded in an inning, a team's half of the inning, 
or their turn at batting, ends. To signal an out, an umpire generally makes 
a fist with one hand, and then flexes that arm either upward, particularly 
on pop flies, or forward, particularly on routine plays at first base. 
Home plate umpires often use a "punch-out" motion to signal a called third 
strike. The most common ways batters or runners are put out are by strikeouts, 
fly outs, tag outs, and force outs; however, there are many, somewhat rarer, 
ways an out can occur. In baseball statistics, each out must be credited 
to exactly one defensive player, namely the player who was the direct cause 
of the out. When referring to outs credited to a defensive player, the 
term putout is used. Example: a batter hits a fair ball which is fielded 
by the shortstop. The shortstop then throws the ball to the first baseman. 
The first baseman then steps on first base before the batter reaches it. 
For this play, only the first baseman is credited with a putout, while 
the shortstop is credited with an assist. For a strikeout, the catcher 
is credited with a putout, because the batter is not out until the pitched 
ball is caught by the catcher. (If the catcher drops the third strike and 
has to throw the batter-runner out at first base, the first baseman receives 
the putout while the catcher receives an assist.) When an out is recorded 
without a fielder's direct involvement, such as where a runner is hit by 
a batted ball, the fielder nearest to the action is usually credited with 
the putout. Although pitchers seldom get credited with putouts, they are 
credited with their role in getting outs through various pitching statistics 
such as innings pitched (a measure of the number of outs made by the pitcher,
