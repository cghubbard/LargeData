Scott Dean Boras (born November 2, 1952) is an American sports agent, specializing 
in baseball. He is the founder, owner and president of the Boras Corporation, 
a sports agency based in Newport Beach, California that represents roughly 
175 professional baseball clients, including many of the game's highest-profile 
players. Boras has brokered many record-setting contracts since 1982, and 
many of his clients, including Shin-Soo Choo, Jacoby Ellsbury, Prince Fielder, 
Matt Holliday, Alex Rodriguez (until 2010), Max Scherzer, and Jayson Werth 
are among the highest paid in the game. Since 2013, Forbes magazine has 
named Boras the "Most Powerful Sports Agent in the World."[1] Boras was 
born in Sacramento and grew up in Elk Grove, California, the son of a dairy 
farmer.[2] He attended the University of the Pacific and made the baseball 
team as a walk on. He led the team with a .312 batting average in 1972.[3] 
As of 2009, Boras remains in the top 10 in school history in multiple offensive 
categories.[3] Boras was inducted into the Pacific Athletics Hall of Fame 
in 1995,[4] and the baseball team's annual "Most Improved Player" award 
is named in his honor.[5] Following his college career, Boras played four 
years of minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago 
Cubs organizations.[6] Boras made the Florida State League All-Star team 
in 1976,[7] but knee problems shortened his career and he retired with 
a career batting average of .288.[6] Boras received his Doctor of Pharmacy 
degree from the University of the Pacific in 1977.[8] Following his playing 
career, Boras returned to the University of the Pacific, earning his law 
degree from the university's McGeorge School of Law in 1982.[9] After law 
school, Boras worked as an associate in the pharmaceutical defense department 
of the Chicago firm Rooks, Pitts & Poust (now Dykema Gossett), defending 
drug companies against class-action lawsuits.[10] Boras's start as an agent 
came representing Mike Fischlin, a former major league shortstop for the 
Cleveland Indians, and Bill Caudill, a former minor league teammate and 
closer for the Seattle Mariners, both of whom now work for Boras.[8][11] 
By 1980, he had decided his calling was as a baseball agent.[12] In 1983, 
Boras negotiated one of the largest contracts in baseball history for Caudill 
($7.5 million), and not long afterward Boras left his law firm job to represent 
players full-time.[13] Today, Boras is the president and owner of the Boras 
Corporation, a baseball-only sports agency.[14] In 2014, the Boras Corporation 
was named by Forbes magazine as the most valuable single-sport agency in 
the world.[15] Boras and the Boras Corporation have become known for record-setting 
contracts for their free agent and amateur draft clients.[16] Boras was 
the first baseball agent to negotiate contracts in excess of $50 million 
(Greg Maddux, five years, $57.5 million in 1997),[17] $100 million (Kevin 
Brown, seven years, $105 million in 1998)[18] and $200 million (Alex Rodriguez, 
10 years, $252 million in 2000).[19] Alex Rodriguez's current contract 
with the New York Yankees, valued at 10 years for $275 million, could potentially 
become the first contract to be valued at over $300 million based on incentives 
listed in the contract that are linked to Rodriguez's home run totals.[20] 
Boras also represents many of the elite players in each year's amateur 
draft and has been a strong advocate for increasing the amount of money 
they receive.[16] Boras's first record-setting contract for a drafted player 
was $150,000 for Tim Belcher in 1983.[21] Since then, Boras's clients have 
regularly pushed draft compensation higher, starting with Andy Benes in 
1988 ($247,500), Ben McDonald in 1989 ($1.01 million guarantee, including 
a $350,000 bonus), Todd Van Poppel in 1990 ($1.2 million guarantee, including 
a $500,000 bonus) and Brien Taylor in 1991 ($1.55 million)[8][22] and continuing 
through J. D. Drew ($8.5 million in 1998) and Mark Teixeira ($9.5 million 
in 2001).[23] In 2009, Boras's clients broke several draft records, led 
by Stephen Strasburg, who surpassed the $15 million barrier with the largest 
contract in draft history ($15.1 million), Donavan Tate, who received the 
largest signing bonus ever given to a high school player ($6.25 million), 
and Jacob Turner, who received the largest signing bonus ever given to 
a high school pitcher ($4.7 million).[24][25] The Boras Corporation operates 
out of a $20 million, 23,000-square-foot (2,100 m2), two-story, glass-and-steel 
building in Newport Beach, California[26] The corporate headquarters includes 
a kitchen, laundry room, gym, shower, lounge, 70 flat-screen televisions 
and a large patio with a 15-foot (4.6 m) tall waterfall, fire pit and barbecue.[27] 
Boras' subsidiary companies include Boras Marketing (memorabilia, marketing, 
and endorsements)[28] and the Boras Sports Training Institute (strength/conditioning 
and sports psychology).[29] Many of Boras's 75-person staff are former 
major leaguers, including Bob Brower, Don Carman, Bill Caudill, Scott Chiamparino, 
Mike Fischlin, Calvin Murray, Jeff Musselman, Domingo Ramos and Kurt Stillwell, 
and the company has scouts spread across the United States, Asia and Latin 
America.[13][26][30][31] Boras's staff also includes an MIT-trained economist, 
a former NASA computer engineer, three lawyers, five personal trainers, 
an investment team (although Boras' firm does not provide investment services 
for clients),[32] a sports psychologist, a 14-person research staff and 
an employee charged with watching each day's games and sending information 
to Boras.[27][33] Over the course of his 31 years as a sports agent, Boras 
has represented hundreds of players on all 30 major league teams and has 
participated in dozens of high-profile negotiations. Boras's specialty 
is the record-breaking contract, which he says is the most difficult to 
achieve because it then provides an "umbrella" from which other players 
can benefit.[16] Boras is well known for identifying sources of leverage 
for his clients and using them for the clients' advantage. This has included 
advising draft picks to return to school instead of signing, taking advantage 
of the right to go to salary arbitration hearings, and advising superstars 
to wait for free agency instead of taking "hometown discount" contracts.[34][35] 
This does not endear him to fans, who regularly side with their favorite 
teams and not individual players.[36] Boras, however, has said his job 
is to represent his clients' interests, even if it means weathering public 
criticism.[37][38][39] Boras is also known for his innovative strategies 
in the draft, salary arbitration and free agency, which have benefited 
his clients enough that Major League Baseball has changed its rules in 
response to Boras on multiple occasions.[40] This has led to descriptions 
of Boras ranging from "baseball's most hated man" (from management's perspective) 
to the man "players can't afford to live without."[41][42][43] + denotes
