Gary David Bennett Jr. (born April 17, 1972) is a former catcher in Major 
League Baseball. Bennett was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 
11th round of the 1990 Major League Baseball Draft. He played in the Phillies 
minor league system from 1990–1996, playing for the Martinsville Phillies 
(1990–1991), Batavia Clippers (1992), Spartanburg Phillies (1993), Clearwater 
Phillies (1993–1994), Reading Phillies (1994–1995), Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Red Barons (1995–1996). Bennett made his major league debut in 1995 for 
the Phillies on September 24 against the Cincinnati Reds as a pinch hitter. 
He was signed as a free agent by the Boston Red Sox in 1997 season and 
spent the season with the Pawtucket Red Sox. He returned to the Phillies 
organization the following year as a minor league free agent. Played most 
of the season with Scranton before his contract was purchased by the Phillies 
in September. 1998 was his first full season in the majors and he stayed 
with the Phillies as a backup catcher to Mike Lieberthal until he was traded 
to the New York Mets for fellow catcher Todd Pratt on July 23, 2001. Bennett 
played in one big league game for the Mets (going 1-for-1) before they 
traded him to the Colorado Rockies a month later. He stayed with the Rockies 
in 2002, having over 200 at bats in a season for the first time in his 
major league career. He then signed free agent deals with the San Diego 
Padres for 2003 (where he eclipsed the 300 at-bat mark for the first time 
and set a still-standing career high in RBI, with 42), Milwaukee Brewers 
for 2004, Washington Nationals for 2005, and St. Louis Cardinals for 2006.[1] 
Bennett came alive in late August 2006. He hit four home runs in the span 
of a week, including a walk-off grand slam against the Chicago Cubs on 
August 27, 2006.[2] In an exhibition game on March 30, 2007 against the 
Memphis Redbirds, the Cardinals AAA Minor League affiliate, Bennett, with 
the game tied 2-2, hit grand slam in the top of the 8th inning, giving 
the Cardinals the victory. This led many fans to call him, "Gary Grand 
Slam Bennett". The four home runs equaled his career high of four home 
runs in a single season, which he did with the 2002 Colorado Rockies. He 
hit no other home runs that season. On November 28, 2006, Bennett was re-signed 
by the Cardinals.[3] On November 2, 2007, the Cardinals exercised their 
2008 buy-out option on his contract.[4] On December 13, 2007, Bennett was 
named in the Mitchell Report,[5] which detailed his illegal use of performance-enhancing 
substances such as human growth hormone. On December 17, 2007, the Dodgers 
signed Bennett to a one-year deal[6] to back up Russell Martin, the Dodgers' 
young All-Star catcher. After signing, Bennett publicly admitted that the 
Mitchell Report was accurate as far as he was concerned, stating, "As far 
as the report is concerned to me, it's accurate. Obviously, it was a stupid 
decision. It was a mistake."[7] Bennett's 2008 season was cut short, however, 
when he went on the disabled list in mid-May for plantar fasciitis. The 
ailment would keep Bennett on the disabled list the remainder of the season. 
Veteran backup Danny Ardoin took Bennett's spot in his absence as Martin's 
backup. Bennett finished the 2008 campaign with a disappointing .190 batting 
average with one home run and four RBI in only 10 games played. After the 
season the Dodgers bought out Bennett's option year, making him a free
