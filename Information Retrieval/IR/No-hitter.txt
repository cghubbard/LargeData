In baseball, a no-hitter (also known as a no-hit game and colloquially 
as a no-no) is a game in which a team was not able to record a single hit. 
Major League Baseball (MLB) officially defines a no-hitter as a completed 
game in which a team that batted in at least nine innings recorded no hits. 
A pitcher who prevents the opposing team from achieving a hit is said to 
have "thrown a no-hitter". This is a rare accomplishment for a pitcher 
or pitching staff: only 295 have been thrown in Major League Baseball history 
since 1876, an average of about two per year. In most cases in MLB, no-hitters 
are recorded by a single pitcher who throws a complete game; one thrown 
by two or more pitchers is a combined no-hitter. The most recent no-hitter 
by a single pitcher was thrown on April 21, 2016 by Jake Arrieta of the 
Chicago Cubs against the Cincinnati Reds at Cincinnati's Great American 
Ball Park. The most recent combined no-hitter was thrown by Cole Hamels, 
Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon of the Philadelphia Phillies 
against the Atlanta Braves on September 1, 2014. It is possible to reach 
base without a hit, most commonly by a walk, error, or being hit by a pitch. 
(Other possibilities include the batter reaching first after a dropped 
third strike.) A no-hitter in which no batters reach base at all is a perfect 
game, a much rarer feat. Because batters can reach base by means other 
than a hit, a pitcher can throw a no-hitter (though not a perfect game) 
and still give up runs, and even lose the game, although this is extremely 
uncommon and most no-hitters are also shutouts. One or more runs were given 
up in 25 recorded no-hitters in MLB history, most recently by Ervin Santana 
of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in a 3–1 win against the Cleveland 
Indians on July 27, 2011. On two occasions, a team has thrown a nine-inning 
no-hitter and still lost the game. On a further four occasions, a team 
has thrown a no-hitter for eight innings in a losing effort, but those 
four games are not officially recognized as no-hitters by Major League 
Baseball because the outing lasted fewer than nine innings. It is theoretically 
possible for opposing pitchers to throw no-hitters in the same game, although 
this has never happened in the majors. Two pitchers, Fred Toney and Hippo 
Vaughn, completed nine innings of a game on May 2, 1917 without either 
giving up a hit or a run; Vaughn gave up two hits and a run in the 10th 
inning, losing the game to Toney, who completed the extra-inning no-hitter. 
A no-hitter is defined by Major League Baseball as follows: "An official 
no-hit game occurs when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits during the 
entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings."[1] This 
definition was specified by MLB's Committee for Statistical Accuracy in 
1991, causing previously recognized no-hitters of fewer than nine innings 
or where the first hit had been allowed in extra innings to be stricken 
from the official record books. Games lost by the visiting team in 8½ innings 
but without allowing any hits do not qualify as no-hitters, as the visiting 
team has only pitched eight innings.[2][3] Major League Baseball has officially 
recognized 295 no-hitters thrown since 1876; only 23 of those were perfect 
games. Two no-hitters have been thrown on the same day twice: Ted Breitenstein 
and Jim Hughes on April 22, 1898; and Dave Stewart and Fernando Valenzuela 
on June 29, 1990. Eight no-hitters were thrown by major league pitchers 
in the 1884 season. In the modern era (since 1901), seven no-hitters were 
thrown in 1990, 1991, 2012, and 2015. The longest period between any two 
no-hitters in the modern era is 7007984744000000000♠3 years, 44 days between 
Bobby Burke on August 8, 1931, and Paul "Daffy" Dean on September 21, 1934. 
There was a drought of 3 years, 11 months, without a no-hitter after the 
first National League no-hitter on July 15, 1876, pitched by George Bradley. 
The most recent year without any no-hitters is 2005. The greatest span 
of games without a no-hitter anywhere in the Major Leagues is 6,364, between 
Randy Johnson's perfect game on May 18, 2004, for the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
and Aníbal Sánchez's no-hitter on September 6, 2006, for the Florida Marlins. 
The previous record was a 4,015-game streak without a no-hitter from September 
30, 1984, to September 19, 1986. The pitcher who holds the record for the 
most no-hitters is Nolan Ryan, who threw seven in his long career. His 
first two came exactly two months apart, while he was with the California 
Angels: the first on May 15, 1973, and the second on July 15. He had two 
more with the Angels on September 28, 1974, and June 1, 1975. Ryan's fifth 
no-hitter with the Houston Astros on September 26, 1981, broke Sandy Koufax's 
previous record. His sixth and seventh no-hitters came with the Texas Rangers 
on June 1, 1990, and May 1, 1991. When he tossed number seven at age 44, 
he became the oldest pitcher to throw a no-hitter. Only Ryan, Sandy Koufax 
(four), Cy Young (three), Bob Feller (three), and Larry Corcoran (three) 
have pitched more than two no-hitters.[4] Corcoran was the first pitcher 
to throw a second no-hitter in a career (in 1882), as well as the first 
to throw a third (in 1884). Thirty-six pitchers have thrown more than one 
no-hitter, combined no-hitters not counting. Randy Johnson has the longest 
gap between no-hitters: he threw a no-hitter as a member of the Seattle 
Mariners on June 2, 1990, and a perfect game as an Arizona Diamondback 
on May 18, 2004. The pitcher who holds the record for the shortest time 
between no-hitters is Johnny Vander Meer, the only pitcher in history to 
throw no-hitters in consecutive starts, while playing for the Cincinnati 
Reds in 1938.[5] Besides Vander Meer, Allie Reynolds (in 1951), Virgil 
Trucks (in 1952), Ryan (in 1973), and Max Scherzer (in 2015) are the only 
other major leaguers to throw two no-hitters in the same regular season. 
Jim Maloney also had two no-hitters under the previous rules in the 1965 
season, both of them taken into extra innings. On the first one on June 
14, he gave up a home run to Johnny Lewis to open the top of the 11th inning, 
turning 10 innings of no-hit ball into a 1–0 loss to the New York Mets. 
According to the rules interpretation of the time, this was considered 
a no-hitter.[6] On August 19, a home run by Leo Cárdenas in the tenth inning 
allowed Maloney to earn a 1–0 10-inning no-hit win over the Chicago Cubs.[7] 
Roy Halladay threw two no-hitters in 2010 – a perfect game during the regular 
season and a no-hitter in the 2010 National League Division Series. He 
is the only major leaguer to have thrown no-hitters in regular season and 
postseason play. Two pitchers missing their non-pitching hand have thrown 
no-hitters; Hugh Daily, of the Cleveland Blues, defeated the Philadelphia 
Quakers 1–0 on September 13, 1883, and Jim Abbott, of the New York Yankees, 
defeated the Cleveland Indians 4–0 on September 4, 1993. Daily lost his 
left hand in a gun accident as a child, and Abbott was born without a right 
hand. Jake Arrieta of the Chicago Cubs is the most recent pitcher to throw 
his second no-hitter, the thirty-fourth player to do so, on April 21, 2016. 
The record for most no-hitters caught by a catcher is four, a record shared 
by Boston Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek and Philadelphia Phillies catcher 
Carlos Ruiz. Varitek caught no-hitters for Hideo Nomo, Derek Lowe, Clay 
Buchholz, and Jon Lester.[8] Varitek also caught a rain-shortened, five-inning 
unofficial no-hitter for Devern Hansack on October 1, 2006.[9] Ruiz caught 
two no-hitters for Roy Halladay, including a perfect game, as well as one 
for Cole Hamels, and a combined no-hitter for Cole Hamels, Jake Diekman, 
Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon.[10] Before MLB redefined "no-hitter", 
Ray Schalk had long held the record of catching four no-hitters, but his 
first nine-inning no-hitter had ended with a hit in the tenth inning.[9][11] 
Five pitchers have thrown a no-hitter in both the American League and the 
National League: Cy Young, Ryan, Jim Bunning, Nomo, and Randy Johnson. 
Only five catchers have caught a no-hitter in each league: Gus Triandos, 
Jeff Torborg, Darrell Porter, Ron Hassey, and most recently, Drew Butera.[12] 
Triandos caught Hoyt Wilhelm's 1958 no-hitter and Jim Bunning's perfect 
game, Torborg caught Koufax's perfect game and Ryan's first no-hitter, 
Porter caught Jim Colborn's 1977 no-hitter and Bob Forsch's second no-hitter 
in 1983, and Hassey caught Len Barker's and Dennis Martínez's perfect games. 
Butera caught a 2011 no-hitter by Francisco Liriano and a 2014 no-hitter 
by Josh Beckett.[12] No team has thrown no-hitters in consecutive games, 
although it has happened once on consecutive days: On May 5, 1917, Ernie 
Koob of the St. Louis Browns no-hit the Chicago White Sox, and teammate 
Bob Groom repeated the feat in the second game of a doubleheader the following 
day. On two occasions, there have been back-to-back no-hitters thrown by 
each team in a series. On September 17, 1968, Gaylord Perry of the San 
Francisco Giants no-hit the St. Louis Cardinals, and the Cardinals' Ray 
Washburn no-hit the Giants the following day. On April 30, 1969, Jim Maloney 
of the Cincinnati Reds no-hit the Houston Astros, and the Astros' Don Wilson 
no-hit the Reds the following day. Surprisingly, it was both Maloney's 
and Wilson's 2nd no-hitter in their careers. Teams have thrown two straight 
no-hitters, with no other teams pitching one in the interim, 19 times; 
most recently by the Los Angeles Dodgers (Josh Beckett and Clayton Kershaw 
in 2014). The only team to throw three straight no-hitters was the Milwaukee 
Braves, with Lew Burdette, followed by consecutive no-no's by Warren Spahn, 
in 1960 and 1961. Individual pitchers have thrown two straight no-hitters 
seven times: Addie Joss 1908 and 1910; Vander Meer in 1938; Allie Reynolds 
in 1951; Warren Spahn in 1960 and 1961; Ryan twice, first in 1973, then 
in 1974 and 1975; and Bailey. All seven instances were with the same team. 
The Tampa Bay Rays are the only MLB team to fail to get a hit in three 
games in a span of 12 months or fewer. No-hit by Arizona's Edwin Jackson 
on June 25, 2010, the Rays were also the victims of two perfect games: 
the first by White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle on July 23, 2009, the second 
by Oakland's Dallas Braden on May 9, 2010. On August 15, 2012, the Rays 
were once again on the losing end of a perfect game, this time at the helm 
of Félix Hernández and the Seattle Mariners.[13] The vast majority of no-hit 
games are finished by the starting pitcher, but eleven MLB no-hitters have 
been thrown by a combination of the starting and relief pitchers. The first 
such combined no-hitter occurred on June 23, 1917, when Ernie Shore of 
the Boston Red Sox relieved starter Babe Ruth, who had been ejected for 
arguing with the umpire after walking the first batter of the game. The 
runner was subsequently caught stealing and Shore retired the next 26 batters 
without allowing any baserunners. This game was long considered a perfect 
game for Shore, since he recorded 27 outs in succession; current rules 
classify it only as a combined no-hitter. Another major league combined 
no-hitter did not occur until April 30, 1967, when Stu Miller of the Baltimore 
Orioles recorded the final out in relief of Steve Barber in a 2–1 loss 
to the Detroit Tigers. The most recent combined no-hitter occurred on September 
1, 2014, when the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Atlanta Braves 7-0, as 
Cole Hamels threw 108 pitches through the first six innings; then Jake 
Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon successively pitched perfect 
innings to preserve the no-hitter. The only combined extra inning no-hitter 
to date occurred on July 12, 1997. Pittsburgh Pirates pitchers Francisco 
Córdova (9 innings) and Ricardo Rincón (1 inning) combined to no-hit the 
Houston Astros, 3–0. Victory was secured with a three-run walk-off home 
run by pinch hitter Mark Smith in the bottom of the tenth inning. On June 
11, 2003, the Houston Astros set a record with six pitchers involved in 
a combined no-hitter. On that day, Roy Oswalt, Pete Munro, Kirk Saarloos, 
Brad Lidge, Octavio Dotel, and Billy Wagner combined to hold the New York 
Yankees hitless. Oswalt was removed after one inning due to injury. Munro 
pitched the most innings, 2⅔. He also allowed five of the six baserunners, 
giving up three walks, hitting a batter and seeing another reach on an 
error by third baseman Geoff Blum. The only other baserunner was allowed 
by Dotel, who threw a third-strike wild pitch to Alfonso Soriano with one 
out in the eighth; Dotel went on to record the forty-fifth four-strikeout 
inning in regular-season play.[14] Lidge, who retired all six hitters he 
faced over the sixth and seventh innings, earned the victory. On June 8, 
2012, the Seattle Mariners tied this record when Kevin Millwood, Charlie 
Furbush, Stephen Pryor, Lucas Luetge, Brandon League, and Tom Wilhelmsen 
combined to no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers. Millwood pitched 6 innings 
before he was taken out due to a groin injury. Only one pitcher has thrown 
a no-hitter as a starter and contributed to a combined no-hitter as a reliever. 
On September 30, 1984, Mike Witt threw a 1–0 perfect game for the California 
Angels against the Texas Rangers. On April 11, 1990, pitching the eighth 
and ninth innings in relief of Mark Langston, Witt earned a save in another 
1–0 no-hit victory for the Angels over the Seattle Mariners. Vida Blue, 
Kent Mercker, Kevin Millwood, and Cole Hamels are the only pitchers to 
start both a complete game no-hitter and a combined no-hitter. Vida Blue 
no-hit the Minnesota Twins on September 21, 1970, while pitching for the 
Oakland Athletics. He combined with Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad, and Rollie 
Fingers to no-hit the California Angels on September 28, 1975. While with 
the Atlanta Braves in 1991, Mercker, Mark Wohlers and Alejandro Peña no-hit 
the San Diego Padres in the National League's first combined no-hitter. 
Mercker threw a complete game no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers 
on April 8, 1994. In addition to the game above in which Millwood and the 
Seattle Mariners tied the record by using six pitchers in a no-hitter, 
Millwood previously threw a complete game no-hitter against the San Francisco 
Giants on April 27, 2003, while with the Philadelphia Phillies. Both Mercker 
and Blue were All-Stars in the seasons of their combined no-hitters, and 
Blue also won the Cy Young Award and the Most Valuable Player Award during 
his career. Combined no-hitters are considered unofficial by Nippon Professional 
Baseball. Hideo Nomo threw the earliest no-hitter based on calendar date: 
April 4, 2001, the second game of the season for the Boston Red Sox, against 
the Baltimore Orioles. The Cleveland Indians' Bob Feller left the Chicago 
White Sox hitless in the 1940 season opener on April 16, the only official 
Opening Day no-hitter. There have been five no-hitters thrown on the final 
day of the regular season. Bumpus Jones of the Cincinnati Reds ended the 
season by no-hitting the Pittsburgh Pirates on October 15, 1892; this is 
also the latest calendar date for a no-hit game thus far. On September 
28, 1975, four Oakland A's pitchers (Vida Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad, 
Rollie Fingers) combined for a season-ending no-hitter against the California 
Angels. Mike Witt of the California Angels threw a perfect game against 
the Texas Rangers on September 30, 1984. Henderson Álvarez of the Miami 
Marlins no-hit the Detroit Tigers on September 29, 2013, to close the regular 
season. Jordan Zimmermann of the Washington Nationals no-hit the Miami 
Marlins on the last day of the 2014 season, September 28. The latest regular-season 
no-hitter by calendar date in the modern era is October 3, achieved by 
Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals in 2015. The Houston Astros' Mike 
Scott no-hit the San Francisco Giants on September 25, 1986, a victory 
that also clinched the National League West title for the Astros; this 
is the only such occurrence in Major League history to date. In the first 
game of a doubleheader on September 28, 1951, Allie Reynolds of the New 
York Yankees pitched a no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox which clinched 
a tie for the American League pennant (the pennant was clinched outright 
in the doubleheader's second game). There have been two postseason no-hitters 
in MLB history, one by a pitcher from each league. For the AL, on October 
8, 1956, Don Larsen of the New York Yankees threw a perfect game in Game 
5 of that year's World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. The feat had 
nearly been accomplished nine years earlier by the Yankees' Bill Bevens, 
who came within one out of a no-hitter (though not a perfect game) against 
the Brooklyn Dodgers in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series, only to lose the 
game on a pinch-hit double by Cookie Lavagetto. There have been other one-hitters 
in the World Series, with the lone hit coming earlier in the game than 
in Bevens' effort. On October 6, 2010, Roy Halladay of the Philadelphia 
Phillies, in the first postseason appearance of his career, threw the second 
no-hitter in postseason history, and first in the NL, in Game 1 of the 
Phillies' NLDS against the Cincinnati Reds. Twenty-two MLB rookies have 
pitched a no-hitter since 1901. Three pitchers have thrown a no-hitter 
in their first major league starts; two others have done it in their second 
major league starts.[15] Bumpus Jones of the Cincinnati Reds threw a no-hitter 
on October 15, 1892 in his first major league game. Jones pitched only 
eight games in the big leagues, finishing with a career win/loss record 
of 2–4 and a career earned run average of 7.99. Ted Breitenstein pitched 
a no-hitter in his first Major League start on October 4, 1891, however, 
it was not his first Major League game.[16] He later threw a second no-hitter 
on April 22, 1898. On May 6, 1953, Bobo Holloman pitched a no-hitter for 
the St. Louis Browns in his first major league start (also not his first 
major league game). This game would prove to be one of only three major 
league wins that Holloman achieved, against seven losses, all in 1953. 
Bill Veeck, then-owner of the Browns, in his autobiography described the 
27 outs of Holloman's no-hitter as consisting of hard-hit ground balls, 
screaming line drives, and deep fly balls. At the other end of the spectrum, 
there are nine 300-game winners—Grover Cleveland Alexander, Kid Nichols, 
Lefty Grove, Early Wynn, Steve Carlton, Don Sutton, Greg Maddux, Roger 
Clemens and Tom Glavine—who failed to pitch a no-hitter. On August 11, 
1991, Wilson Álvarez of the Chicago White Sox pitched a no-hitter in his 
second career major league start. During Alvarez's first career start, 
he had allowed three runs on a pair of home runs and did not retire a single 
batter. Unlike Jones and Holloman, Alvarez went on to win 102 games over 
a 16-year career. Clay Buchholz pitched a no-hitter for the Boston Red 
Sox in his second major league start on September 1, 2007 at Fenway Park. 
The game ended in a 10–0 victory for the Red Sox over the Baltimore Orioles. 
Chris Heston, pitcher for the San Francisco Giants, threw a no-hitter in 
a 5-0 victory over the New York Mets on June 9, 2015. Unlike a perfect 
game, in which no batters reach base, in regular no-hitters batters can 
reach base in other ways, such as a walk, an error, or a hit batsman, thus 
it is possible for the team pitching the no-hitter to lose. On April 23, 
1964, Ken Johnson of the Houston Colt .45s became the only pitcher to lose 
a complete game no-hitter in nine innings when he was beaten, 1–0, by Cincinnati. 
The winning run was scored by Pete Rose in the top of the ninth inning 
via an error, groundout, and another error.[17] On April 30, 1967, Steve 
Barber and Stu Miller of the Baltimore Orioles pitched a combined no-hitter, 
but lost 2-1 to the Detroit Tigers.[18] On July 1, 1990, Andy Hawkins of 
the Yankees pitched an eight-inning no-hitter (the Yankees were the away 
team) against the Chicago White Sox and lost the game 4–0 after an eighth 
inning which saw three errors.[19] The four runs that the White Sox scored 
are the most by any team in a game in which they had no hits.[20] Because 
Hawkins only threw eight innings, this game is not recognized as an official 
no-hitter by Major League Baseball; however, it was considered a no-hitter 
at the time it was pitched. Years after the game, the rules regarding no-hitters, 
(and rules regarding other statistics), were changed and applied retroactively 
in order to "clean up the record book". The Hawkins "no-hitter" failed 
on at least two provisions of the new standards. To be classified a valid 
no-hitter, the pitcher must face opposing batters in at least nine innings. 
Jered Weaver and José Arredondo of the Angels also combined for eight innings 
of no-hit baseball in a 1–0 road loss to the Dodgers June 28, 2008, where 
Matt Kemp reached on an error, stole second, advanced to third on another 
error, and scored on a sacrifice fly. However, since the Angels only pitched 
eight innings, this game is not recognized as an official no-hitter. A 
game that cannot continue due to weather or darkness may be considered 
a completed official game, as long as at least five innings have been completed. 
Until 1991, any such game in which a pitcher held the opposing team without 
hits was considered an official no-hitter; however under the current rule, 
a no-hitter must last for at least nine innings to count. As the rule was 
applied retroactively, thirty-six games in which a no-hitter was interrupted 
by weather or darkness, with lengths ranging from 5 to 8 innings, are no 
longer considered no-hitters. If the home team leads after the top of the 
ninth, they do not bat in the bottom of the ninth, thus the visiting team 
only pitches 8 innings. Since it is possible to score runs without getting 
hits, a visiting team can complete a full game without allowing a hit but 
not be credited with an official no-hitter. This has happened four times 
in MLB history: Silver King (1890), Andy Hawkins (1990), and Matt Young 
(1992) pitched complete games without allowing a hit, but pitched only 
8 innings as the losing pitcher from the visiting team, and thus are not 
credited with a no-hitter.[21][22] On June 28, 2008, Jered Weaver and José 
Arredondo of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim threw 8 no-hit innings against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, but lost the game, 1–0, and 
are not credited with a no-hitter. This is the first near no-hitter of 
this kind in which more than one pitcher was involved. A game that is a 
no-hitter through nine innings may be lost in extra innings. Under current 
rules, such a game is not considered an official no-hitter because the 
pitcher did not keep the opponent hitless for the entire course of the 
game. On May 2, 1917, a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati 
Reds reached the end of nine innings in a hitless scoreless tie,[23] the 
only time in baseball history that neither team has had a hit in regulation. 
Both Hippo Vaughn of the Cubs and Fred Toney of the Reds continued pitching 
into the tenth inning. Vaughn lost his no-hitter in the top of the tenth, 
as the Reds got two hits and scored the winning run. Toney retired the 
side in the bottom of the tenth and recorded a ten-inning no-hitter. This 
game was long considered a "double no-hitter", but Vaughn is no longer 
credited with a no-hitter under the current rules. Of the thirteen potential 
no-hitters that have been lost in extra innings, two were perfect games 
until the inning when the first hit was surrendered. On May 26, 1959, Harvey 
Haddix of the Pittsburgh Pirates pitched a remarkable twelve perfect innings 
against the Milwaukee Braves before losing the perfect game on an error 
and then the no-hitter and the game in the thirteenth inning. On June 3, 
1995, Pedro Martínez of the Montreal Expos pitched nine perfect innings 
against the San Diego Padres before giving up a hit in the tenth and exiting 
the game, which the Expos then won, 1–0.[24] Only one existing franchise 
in Major League Baseball has not had a pitcher toss a no-hitter: the San 
Diego Padres, who have gone 46 years without a no-hitter since they entered 
Major League Baseball in 1969. Their closest bid came against the Philadelphia 
Phillies on July 18, 1972; Steve Arlin came within one out of a no-hitter 
before Denny Doyle broke up the bid with a single. On July 9, 2011, five 
Padres pitchers combined for 8 2⁄3 innings of no-hit pitching against the 
Los Angeles Dodgers before Juan Uribe hit a double, which was followed 
by a Dioner Navarro single that won the game, which had been scoreless 
up to that point. The New York Mets, who began play in 1962, went without 
a no-hitter until Johan Santana pitched one on the night of June 1, 2012, 
against the St. Louis Cardinals at home at Citi Field. The 8–0 victory 
closed out their era as the oldest franchise without a no-hitter and ended 
a drought that lasted 8,019 regular-season and 74 post-season games. Mets 
pitchers have thrown 39 one-hitters. The longest no-hitter drought in Major 
League history was suffered by the Philadelphia Phillies between May 1, 
1906, and June 21, 1964, a span that encompassed 8,945 games. The Washington 
Nationals achieved their first no-hitter on September 28, 2014.[25] The 
franchise has four previous no-hitters in its history as the Montreal Expos, 
including a perfect game by Dennis Martínez. Six current NL teams—the Braves, 
Dodgers, Giants, Phillies, Cubs and Reds—all pitched their first no-hitters 
before the advent of the American League in 1901. Among the early National 
League teams still playing, the last to get their first no-hitter was the 
St. Louis Cardinals, when Jesse Haines pitched one on July 17, 1924. Of 
the original American League teams, the last team to get their first no-hitter 
was the New York Yankees, when George Mogridge pitched one on April 24, 
1917. There are a number of short-lived Major League franchises from the 
nineteenth century that folded without ever recording a no-hitter. All 
modern-era MLB teams have experienced at least two no-hitters pitched against 
them. The record for the longest period of time without being no-hit is 
held by the Chicago Cubs, who succeeded in getting at least one hit in 
every game since Sandy Koufax's perfect game against them on September 
9, 1965, until they were no-hit by Cole Hamels of the Philadelphia Phillies 
on July 25, 2015, a period of 7009157379760000000♠49 years, 318 days (7951 
games – including 31 Post Season games). The second-longest streak without 
having an official no-hitter pitched against them is held by the New York 
Yankees, who had a gap of 7009141125760000000♠44 years, 263 days between 
nine-inning no-hitters from September 21, 1958 to June 10, 2003. However, 
during this time, the Yankees team hitting streak ended in a rain-shortened 
official game on July 12, 1990,[26] after 7009100368720000000♠31 years, 
294 days. The St. Louis Cardinals have the second-longest team hitting 
streak in MLB history: May 12, 1919 to May 14, 1960, a period of 7009129412080000000♠41 years,

7008765590400000000♠24 years, 95 days (3941 games: Including 44 Post Season 
games) as of October 16, 2015. They were last held hitless on July 13, 
1991, when four Baltimore Orioles pitchers combined to shut down the A's 
offense. Forbes Field, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates from the middle of 
the 1909 season until the middle of the 1970 season, is the only long-term 
major league ballpark where a no-hitter was never thrown during its existence. 
There are several recently built fields where no-hitters have not yet been 
thrown. Five parks presently in existence for a decade or more have only 
seen one no-hitter each: the Orioles' current home, Oriole Park at Camden 
Yards, known for being hitter friendly (Hideo Nomo on April 4, 2001); Coors 
Field, the hitter-friendly home of the Colorado Rockies (Nomo on September 
17, 1996); Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres, which initially was 
known as a pitcher's park but was modified with shorter fences in 2013 
(Tim Lincecum on July 13, 2013); PNC Park, the current home of the Pirates, 
which like Forbes Field is known for being hitter-friendly (Homer Bailey 
on September 28, 2012); and Minute Maid Park, the home of the Houston Astros 
which is known for the short Crawford Boxes in left and for its deep outfield 
in centre (Mike Fiers on August 21, 2015). In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, 
Shairon Martis pitched a no-hitter for the Netherlands against Panama, 
however it was only seven innings due to the mercy rule. One of the most 
common baseball superstitions is that it is bad luck to mention a no-hitter 
in progress, especially to the pitcher and in particular by their teammates 
(who sometimes even go so far as to not even be near the pitcher).[27] 
Some sportscasters observe this taboo while others have no reservations 
about mentioning no-hitters before completion. When Sandy Koufax pitched 
his no-hitter against the Mets in 1962, one of their 120 losses that season, 
Mets' coach Solly Hemus, apparently trying to jinx Koufax, kept heckling 
him through the game about pitching a no-hitter, according to a post-game 
interview Koufax gave after pitching his third no-hitter in 1964. An early 
biography of Koufax quoted him as telling his catcher, during that 1964 
no-hitter, "Let's just go to the fastball and get this no-hit thing over 
with." Mickey Mantle, in an interview for Ken Burns' 1994 Baseball documentary 
series, related that Don Larsen, famed for his 1956 World Series perfect 
game, tried to talk about his no-hitter throughout the contest but much 
to his chagrin his Yankee teammates avoided his conversation and maintained 
the superstition. When Los Angeles Angels rookie Bo Belinsky entered the 
final inning of his no-hitter in 1962, Baltimore Orioles outfielder Jackie 
Brandt passed him on the field as the teams changed sides. According to 
Belinsky biographer Maury Allen, Brandt told Belinsky, "Nice game, Bo, 
but it's over. I'm leading off with a bunt single." Belinsky got Brandt 
out to start the final inning of his no-hitter. In 2009, when Mark Buehrle 
was pitching his perfect game, as he exited the field after the eighth 
inning, White Sox broadcaster Ken Harrelson exclaimed, "Call your sons! 
Call your daughters! Call your friends! Call your neighbors! Mark Buehrle 
has a perfect game going into the ninth!" Buehrle retired the side in the 
ninth to complete the perfect game. When Jim Bunning was pitching his perfect 
game in 1964, he deliberately violated this superstition, talking to his 
teammates about the perfect game's progress in order to dispel the tension
