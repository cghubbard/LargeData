Donald Wayne "Easy" Money (born June 7, 1947 in Washington, D.C., United 
States) is a retired major league baseball player. He currently serves 
as the special instructor of player development for the Milwaukee Brewers. 
Money spent most of his career as a third baseman and was a four-time All-Star. 
Known as one of the best defensive third basemen of the era, he batted 
and threw right-handed. He played for the Philadelphia Phillies (1968–1972) 
and the Milwaukee Brewers (1973–1983). He briefly played for the Kintetsu 
Buffaloes in Japan for one month at the end of his career. Money was originally 
signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent in 1965. While 
still in the minors, the Pirates traded him in 1967 to the Philadelphia 
Phillies (with Harold Clem, Woodie Fryman and Bill Laxton) for Jim Bunning. 
Called up by the Phillies in 1968, he began his major league career as 
a shortstop, but was moved to third base when Larry Bowa was called up 
by the Phillies. On October 31, 1972, with the Phillies looking to make 
room for Mike Schmidt, Money was part of a seven-player deal that sent 
John Vukovich and Bill Champion with Money to Milwaukee in exchange for 
four pitchers: Jim Lonborg, Ken Sanders, Ken Brett and Earl Stephenson.[1] 
Money's most productive seasons were those in 1974, 1977, and 1978 while 
playing for the Milwaukee Brewers. In 1974, he set career-highs in hits 
(178), doubles (32), and at bats (629). He also had 19 stolen bases and 
made his first All-Star team. In 1977, he had career-highs in home runs 
(25), Runs batted in (83), slugging percentage (.470), and total bases 
(268). He also had 86 runs scored and made his third All-Star Game. In 
1978, he had career-highs in batting average (.293), on-base percentage 
(.361), and sacrifice hits (14). He also had 7 hit by pitches, and made 
his fourth and final All-Star team. Late in his career, Money finally made 
the post-season with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1981. Because of a prolonged 
strike, Major League Baseball chose to have a split-season format. In the 
American League Eastern Division, the first-half champion New York Yankees 
played Milwaukee, the second half champion. Money, having his worst major 
league season to date, only had three plate appearances as the Brewers 
lost the series to New York, 3 games to 2. He saw more action the following 
postseason as the Brewers defeated the California Angels in the American 
League Championship Series. In his only World Series of his career, Money 
and the Brewers lost in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1982. 
He had a .185 batting average in the 1982 post-season, and a .231 average 
in the World Series, picking up 2 playoff RBI all-time.[2] In a 16-season 
career, Money hit .261 with 176 home runs and 729 RBIs in 1,720 games. 
He had a lifetime on-base percentage of .328 and a .406 slugging percentage. 
He also had 80 career stolen bases with 798 runs. He had 1,623 hits in 
6,215 at bats. On April 10, 1971 he hit the first ever home run at Veterans 
Stadium.[3] On July 7, 1974, he set the major league record for errorless 
games at third base, with 78. He would go on to complete an 86-game streak 
with no errors in 257 chances.[4] On April 10, 1976, Money hit a grand 
slam off Dave Pagan of the New York Yankees, only to see it taken back 
because the first base umpire had called time before the pitch was delivered. 
According to most accounts, the time out was only granted after the home 
run, when Yankees manager Billy Martin appealed to the umpire that he had 
discreetly asked for time out.[5] After retiring from MLB, he contracted 
with the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the Japanese Professional League. Money 
had watched many games of the Yomiuri Giants and noted the large crowds 
and their beautiful stadium. Kintetsu had a dilapidated stadium, however, 
and rarely drew much of a crowd. The team put Money up in a cockroach-ridden 
apartment rather than a house in a tree-lined setting as he felt he had 
been promised.[6] After one month Money packed up his family and moved 
back to his farm in Vineland, New Jersey.[7] Money began his minor league 
coaching career as manager of the Class A Oneonta Tigers from 1987 to 1988. 
He became manager of the Class A Beloit Snappers in 1998. After seven years 
at Beloit, he moved up to the Brewers' Double-A affiliate, the Huntsville 
Stars in 2005.[8] In 2007, Money was named the Southern League's Manager 
of the Year as voted upon by the league's field managers, radio broadcasters, 
and print media. On May 14, 2008, he became the winningest manager in Stars' 
history;[9] he finished the season with 275 victories.[10] Money managed 
the Nashville Sounds, Milwaukee's Triple-A club, from 2009 to 2011. Following 
the 2011 season, he became Milwaukee's special instructor of player development.[11] 
In 2005, Money was inducted into the Milwaukee Brewers Walk of Fame at 
Miller Park. He was inducted along with one of his former Brewers managers, 
Harvey Kuenn. Money said that his induction was "the greatest honor of
