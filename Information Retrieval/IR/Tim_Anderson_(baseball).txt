Timothy Devon "Tim" Anderson (born June 23, 1993) is an American professional 
baseball shortstop for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Anderson played college baseball at East Central Community College, and 
was selected in the first round of the 2013 MLB draft by the White Sox. 
He made his MLB debut on June 10, 2016. Anderson attended Hillcrest High 
School in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where he played basketball, leading the 
school's basketball team to the state championship.[1] He didn't begin 
playing baseball until his junior year.[2] As a junior, Anderson batted 
.333 as a left fielder. In his senior year, Anderson played as an infielder 
and batted .420.[3] Anderson then enrolled at East Central Community College 
in Decatur, Mississippi, to play college baseball. East Central was the 
only school to make him a scholarship offer.[4] In his freshman season, 
Anderson batted .360 with four home runs, 37 runs batted in, and 30 stolen 
bases in 30 attempts.[3] However, he received no interest from Major League 
Baseball (MLB), and thus was not selected in the 2012 MLB Draft.[5] Returning 
to East Central for his sophomore year, Anderson had a breakout season, 
leading all junior college baseball players with a .495 batting average.[5] 
He was named a first-team National Junior College Athletic Association 
Division II All-American.[6] He committed to transfer to the University 
of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).[1] The Chicago White Sox selected Anderson 
in the first round, with the 17th overall selection, in the 2013 MLB Draft.[5] 
Anderson opted to sign with the White Sox, rather than enroll at UAB, for 
a signing bonus of $2,164,000.[7] Though expected make his professional 
debut with the Bristol White Sox of the Rookie-level Appalachian League,[6] 
the White Sox chose to assign Anderson to the Kannapolis Intimidators of 
the Class A South Atlantic League instead.[8] In 2014, Anderson began the 
season with the Winston-Salem Dash of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League.[9][10] 
He broke his wrist in late June, requiring surgery.[11] In 68 games, Anderson 
had a .297 batting average, six home runs, and 10 stolen bases. When he 
returned in August, the White Sox promoted him to the Birmingham Barons 
of the Class AA Southern League,[12] where he batted .364 in 10 games.[13] 
The White Sox assigned Anderson to the Glendale Desert Dogs of the Arizona 
Fall League after the regular season.[14] The White Sox invited Anderson 
to spring training in 2015.[13] He spent the season with Birmingham,[15] 
and he batted .312 with five home runs and 49 stolen bases.[16] Invited 
to spring training again in 2016,[17] the White Sox assigned him to the 
Charlotte Knights of the Class AAA International League at the beginning 
of the season.[18] In 55 games for Charlotte, Anderson batted .304 with 
four home runs, 20 RBIs, and 11 stolen bases.[19] On June 10, 2016, the 
White Sox designated Jimmy Rollins for assignment and promoted Anderson
