Bridgeport is the most populous city in the American state of Connecticut 
and the 5th-most populous in New England.[4] Located in Fairfield County 
at the mouth of the Pequonnock River onto Long Island Sound, the city had 
a population of 144,229 during the 2010 Census.[5] It is bordered by the 
towns of Trumbull to the north, Fairfield to the west, and Stratford to 
the east. The Greater Bridgeport area is the 48th-largest urban area in 
the United States, just behind Hartford (47th), and forms part of the Greater 
New York City Area. Bridgeport was inhabited by the Paugussett Indian tribe 
at the time of its English colonization. The English farming community 
became a center of trade, shipbuilding, and whaling. The town incorporated 
itself to subsidize the Housatonic Railroad and rapidly industrialized 
following its connection to the New York and New Haven railroad. Manufacturing 
was the mainstay of the local economy until the 1970s. Industrial restructuring 
and suburbanization caused the loss of many jobs and affluent residents, 
leaving Bridgeport struggling with problems of poverty and crime. In the 
21st century, conversion of office and factory buildings to residential 
use and other redevelopment is attracting new residents. The showman P.T. 
Barnum was a resident of the city and served as the town's mayor in the 
late 19th century. Barnum built four houses in Bridgeport, and housed his 
circus in town during winter. The first Subway restaurant opened in the 
North End section of the city in 1965.[6] The Frisbie Pie Company was located 
here, and Bridgeport is credited as the birthplace of the Frisbee.[7] The 
first documented English settlement within the present city limits of Bridgeport 
took place in 1644, centered at Black Rock Harbor along North Avenue and 
between Park and Briarwood Avenues. The place was called Pequonnock[8] 
(Quiripi for "Cleared Land"), after a band of the Paugussett, a Native 
American people who then occupied this area. One of their sacred sites 
was Golden Hill, which overlooked the harbor and was the location of natural 
springs and their planting fields. (It has since been blasted through for 
an expressway.)[9][10] The Golden Hill Indians were granted a reservation 
here by the Colony of Connecticut in 1639 that survived until 1802. (It 
exists today in adjoining Trumbull.) Bridgeport's early years were marked 
by residents' reliance on fishing and farming, not altogether different 
from the economy of the Native Americans, who had cultivated corn, beans, 
and squash and fished and gathered shellfish from both the river and sound. 
A village called Newfield began to coalesce around the corner of State 
and Water Streets in the 1760s.[11] The area officially became known as 
Stratfield in 1695[8] or 1701 due to its location between the already existing 
towns of Stratford and Fairfield.[12] During the American Revolution, Newfield 
Harbor was a center of privateering.[8][13] By the time of the State of 
Connecticut's ratification of the American constitution in 1781, many of 
the local farmers held shares in vessels trading at Newfield Harbor or 
had begun trading in their own name. Newfield initially expanded around 
the coasting trade with Boston, New York, and Baltimore and the international 
trade with the West Indies.[11][15] The commercial activity of the village 
was clustered around the wharves on the west bank of the Pequonnock, while 
the churches were erected inland on Broad Street.[14] In 1800, the village 
became the Borough of Bridgeport, [18] the first so incorporated in the 
state.[19] It was named for the Newfield or Lottery Bridge across the Pequonnock, 
connecting the wharves on its east and west banks.[17] Bridgeport Bank 
was established in 1806.[20] In 1821, the township of Bridgeport became 
independent of Stratford.[21] The West India trade died down around 1840,[11] 
but by that time the Bridgeport Steamship Company (1824)[22] and Bridgeport 
Whaling Company (1833) had been incorporated[11] and the Housatonic Railroad 
chartered (1836).[23][24] The HRRC ran upstate along the Housatonic Valley, 
connecting with Massachusetts's Berkshire Railroad at the state line. Bridgeport 
was chartered as Connecticut's fifth city in 1836[21][25][28] in order 
to enable the town council to secure funding (ultimately $150,000) to provide 
to the HRRC and ensure that it would terminate in Bridgeport.[29] The Naugatuck 
Railroad—connecting Bridgeport to Waterbury and Winsted along the Naugatuck—was 
chartered in 1845 and began operation four years later.[30][31] The same 
year, the New York and New Haven Railroad began operation,[32] connecting 
Bridgeport to New York and the other towns along the north shore of the 
Long Island Sound. Now a major junction for western Connecticut, the city 
rapidly industrialized. Following the Civil War, it held several iron foundries 
and factories manufacturing firearms, metallic cartridges, horse harnesses, 
locks, and blinds.[21] Wheeler & Wilson's sewing machines were exported 
throughout the world. Bridgeport annexed the West End and the village of 
Black Rock and its busy harbor in 1870.[33] In 1875, P.T. Barnum was elected 
mayor of the town, which afterwards served as the winter headquarters of 
Barnum and Bailey's Circus and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.[8] From 1870 
to 1910, Bridgeport became the major industrial center of Connecticut and 
its population rose from around 25,000 to over 100,000, including thousands 
of Irish, Slovaks, Hungarians, Germans, English, and Italian immigrants.[8] 
A Singer factory joined Wheeler & Wilson in producing sewing machines[8] 
and the Locomobile Company of America was a prominent early automobile 
manufacturer, producing a prototype of the Stanley Steamer and various 
luxury cars.[34] The town was the center of America's corset production, 
responsible for almost 20% of the national total,[8] and became the headquarters 
of Remington Arms following its 1912 merger with the Union Metallic Cartridge 
Co. Around the time of the First World War, Bridgeport was also producing 
steam-fitting and heating apparatuses, brass goods, phonographs, typewriters,[8] 
milling machines, brassieres, and saddles.[35] A series of strikes in the 
summer of 1915 imposed the eight-hour day on the town's factories; rather 
than moving business elsewhere, the success spread the eight-hour day throughout 
the Northeast.[36] The First World War continued the city's expansion so 
that, on the eve of the Great Depression, there were more than 500 factories 
in Bridgeport, including Columbia Records' primary pressing plant. The 
build-up to World War II helped its recovery in the late 1930s.[37] Restructuring 
of heavy industry starting after the mid-20th century caused the loss of 
thousands of jobs and residents. Like other urban centers in Connecticut, 
Bridgeport suffered during the deindustrialization of the United States 
in the 1970s and 1980s.[38] Continued development of new suburban housing 
attracted middle and upper-class residents, leaving the city with a higher 
proportion of poor. The city suffered from overall mismanagement, for which 
several city officials were convicted, contributing to the economic and 
social decline.[39] In September 1978, Bridgeport teachers went on a 19-day 
strike due to deadlocked contract negotiations. A court order, as well 
as a state law that made strikes by public workers illegal in Connecticut, 
resulted in 274 teachers being arrested and jailed.[40] Bridgeport made 
numerous efforts at revitalization. In one proposal, Las Vegas developer 
Steve Wynn was to build a large casino, but that project failed. In 1991, 
the city filed for bankruptcy protection but was declared solvent by a 
federal court.[41] In the early 21st century, Bridgeport has taken steps 
toward redevelopment of its downtown and other neighborhoods. In 2004, 
artists' lofts were developed in the former Read's Department Store on 
Broad Street. Several other rental conversions have been completed, including 
the 117-unit Citytrust bank building on Main Street. The recession halted, 
at least temporarily, two major mixed-use projects including a $1-billion 
waterfront development at Steel Point, but other redevelopment projects 
have proceeded, such as the condominium conversion project in Bijou Square.[42] 
In 2009, the City Council approved a new master plan for development, designed 
both to promote redevelopment in selected areas and to protect existing 
residential neighborhoods.[43] In 2010, the Bridgeport Housing Authority 
and a local health center announced plans to build a $20 million medical 
and housing complex at Albion Street, making use of federal stimulus funds 
and designed to replace some of the housing lost with the demolition of 
Father Panik Village.[44] On March 10, 1860, Abraham Lincoln spoke in the 
city's Washington Hall, an auditorium at the old Bridgeport City Hall (now 
McLevy Hall), at the corner of State and Broad Streets. The largest room 
in the city was packed, and a crowd formed outside, as well. Lincoln received 
a standing ovation before taking the 9:07 pm train that night back to Manhattan.[45][46] 
A plaque marks the site where Lincoln spoke; later that year, he was elected 
president. The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke three times at the Klein 
Auditorium during the 1960s. Additionally, President George W. Bush spoke 
before a small group of Connecticut business people and officials at the 
Playhouse on the Green in 2006.[47] President Barack Obama also spoke at 
the Harbor Yard arena in 2010 to gain support for the campaign of Democratic 
Governor Dan Malloy.[48] Bridgeport is located along Long Island Sound 
at the mouth of the Pequonnock River, named for the Native American tribe 
who historically lived along it. Bridgeport is renowned for its public 
park system, which has led to its official nickname as "The Park City". 
The city's first public park was the westerly portion of McLevy Green, 
first set aside as a public square 1806,[49] although the Clinton Park 
Militia Grounds (1666) and Old Mill Green (1717) were set aside earlier 
as public commons by the towns of Fairfield and Stratford, respectively. 
As the city rapidly grew in population, residents recognized the need for 
more public parks and by 1864, Barnum and other residents had donated approximately 
44 acres (180,000 m2) to create Seaside Park, now increased by acquisition 
and landfill to 375 acres (1.52 km2).[50] In 1878, over 100 acres (400,000 m2) 
of land bordering the Pequonnock River was added as Beardsley Park.[51] 
Frederick Law Olmsted, famous for creating New York City's Central Park, 
designed both Seaside and Beardsley Parks.[52] Over time, more parks were 
added including 35-acre (140,000 m2) Beechwood Park and Pleasure Beach, 
home to a popular amusement park for many years. The city of Bridgeport 
is divided into many distinct neighborhoods,[53] divided into five geographic 
areas: Downtown, the East Side, the North End, the South End, and the West 
Side.[54] Under the Köppen climate classification, Bridgeport straddles 
between a humid subtropical (Cfa) and humid continental (Dfa) climate, 
with some maritime influence; it is part of USDA hardiness zone 7a.[55] 
The normal average monthly temperature ranges from 30.1 °F (−1.1 °C) in 
January to 74.3 °F (23.5 °C) in July; on average, there are 20 days where 
the temperature remains at or below freezing and 7.6 days with a high at 
or above 90 °F (32 °C) annually; the last year to not reach the latter 
mark was 2004.[56] Temperatures reaching 0 °F (−18 °C) or 100 °F (38 °C) 
are rare, and were last seen respectively on February 14, 2016 and July 
22, 2011.[56] The record low is −7 °F (−22 °C), set on January 22, 1984, 
while the record high is 103 °F (39 °C), set on July 22 in 1957 and 2011.[56] 
Precipitation averages 42.7 inches (1,080 mm) annually, and is somewhat 
evenly distributed throughout the year, though March and April are the 
wettest months in terms of total precipitation. Snowfall averages 27.6 
inches (70 cm) per winter, falling almost entirely from December to March. 
As is typical of coastal Connecticut, snow cover does not usually remain 
for long, with an average of 29 days per winter with snow cover of at least 
1 inch (2.5 cm). As of the census of 2000, there were 139,529 people, 50,307 
households, and 32,749 families residing in the city. The population density 
was 8,720.9 people per square mile (3,367.0/km²). There were 54,367 housing 
units at an average density of 3,398.1 per square mile (1,312.0/km²). The 
racial makeup of the city was 45.0% White, 30.8% African American, 0.5% 
Native American, 3.3% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander. Hispanic or Latino 
of any race were 20.3% of the population. Other ancestry groups include: 
Italian (8.6%), Irish (5.1%), Portuguese (2.9%), Polish (2.8%), and German 
(2.4%).[62] As of the 2010 census, there were 144,229 people residing in 
the city. The racial makeup of the city residents was 39.6% White; 34.6% 
Black or African American; 3.4% Asian; and 4.3% from two or more races. 
A total of 18.1% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 
There were 50,307 households out of which 34.3% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 35.0% were married couples living together, 
24.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.9% were 
non-families. 29.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.3% 
had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 2.70 and the average family size was 3.34. In the city 
the population was spread out with 28.4% under the age of 18, 11.2% from 
18 to 24, 30.5% from 25 to 44, 18.4% from 45 to 64, and 11.5% who were 
65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females 
there were 91.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
86.3 males. The median income for a household in the city was $34,658, 
and the median income for a family was $39,571. Males had a median income 
of $32,430 versus $26,966 for females. The per capita income for the city 
was $16,306. About 16.2% of families and 18.4% of the population were below 
the poverty line, including 24.8% of those under age 18 and 13.2% of those 
age 65 or over. Since 1849, FSWINC, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization 
has provided care for individuals living in difficult socioeconomic situations 
in both Bridgeport and Fairfield.[63][64] According to 2010 census data, 
the Bridgeport MSA, containing all of Fairfield County, is the most economically 
unequal region in America, with 57% of the wealth going to the top percentile.[65][66] 
Since the decline of its industrial sector beginning in the middle of the 
20th century, Bridgeport has gradually adjusted to a service-based economy. 
Though a level of industrial activity continues, healthcare, finance, and 
education have evolved into the centerpieces of Bridgeport's economy. The 
two largest employers within the city are Bridgeport's primary hospitals, 
Bridgeport Hospital and St. Vincent's Medical Center. The former Park City 
Hospital closed in 1993 and was reopened in 2010 as elderly and homeless 
housing units.[67] Emergency medical services are provided by American 
Medical Response at the paramedic level. According to the City's 2009 Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report,[68] the top employers in the city are: Bridgeport 
is home to the University of Bridgeport, Housatonic Community College, 
St. Vincent's College, and the Yeshiva Gedola of Bridgeport. The Yeshiva 
Gedola is currently the home of the Bridgeport Community Kollel, a rabbinic 
fellowship program[69] The University of Bridgeport's Ernest C. Trefz School 
of Business offers programs for both undergraduate and graduate. The city's 
public school system has 30 elementary schools, three comprehensive high 
schools, two alternative programs and an interdistrict vocational aquaculture 
school. The system has about 20,800 students, making the Bridgeport Public 
Schools the second largest school system in Connecticut after Hartford. 
It is ranked #158 out of the 164 Connecticut school districts.[70] The 
school system employs a professional staff of more than 1,700. The city 
has started a large school renovation and construction program, with plans 
for new schools and modernization of existing buildings. Public high schools 
Public magnet schools Bridgeport is also home to private schools, including 
Bridgeport Hope School (K-8), Bridgeport International Academy (grades 
9-12), Catholic Academies of Bridgeport (PK-8), Kolbe Cathedral High School 
(9-12), St. Andrew Academy (PK-8), St. Ann Academy (PK-8), and Zion Lutheran 
School (PK-8). The city is governed by the mayor council system. Twenty 
members of the city council are elected from districts. Each district elects 
two members. The mayor is elected by the entire city. Bridgeport is notable 
for having had a Socialist mayor for 24 years; Jasper McLevy served as 
mayor from 1933 to 1957. A more recent mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, was involved 
in a corruption scandal, as has been the case with some other mayors in 
Connecticut.[71] In June 2006, Mayor John M. Fabrizi admitted that he had 
used cocaine while in office.[72] Taxes are high in Bridgeport, and the 
second highest in the county. In 2005, the mill rate for Bridgeport was 
42.28[74] and is reportedly 41.855 for fiscal year 2013-2014.[75] Bridgeport 
has a number of venues for live theater and music events, ranging from 
intimate performing spaces to a stadium hosting rock concerts.[76] Bridgeport 
has been the annual home to Gathering of the Vibes, a weekend long arts, 
music and camping festival featuring some of the best names in festival 
talent. In 1999, 2000, and 2007 through 2010, thousands of people have 
come from all over the world to camp in Seaside Park and enjoy such talent 
as Buddy Guy, Bob Weir and Ratdog, Deep Banana Blackout, Les Claypool, 
Assembly of Dust, Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Los Lobos and Bridgeport's own 
The Alternate Routes. Since 1945, the Greater Bridgeport Symphony has been 
a cultural and musical gem for the City of Bridgeport and its surrounding 
towns, performing at the 1,400 seat Klein Memorial Auditorium. The orchestra 
has a rich and vibrant history. Under the direction of Gustav Meier for 
the past 41 years, the prestigious orchestra has welcomed international 
soloists Beverly Sills, Midori, Benny Goodman, Itzhak Perlman with other 
links to legends like Leonard Bernstein, Jose Iturbi. Through its annual 
Carlson-Horn Competition for Young Instrumentalist created many new bright 
professional soloists including Andrew Armstrong, Alexander Markov, and 
Anita Chen. Museums, zoos and parks Bridgeport has a number of museums, 
ranging from the science-oriented to fine arts and historical, as well 
as the state's largest zoo.[76] A list of films shot or partially filmed 
in the city:[77] Novels Other allusions Webster Bank Arena serves as the 
city's sports and hospitality center. Seating 10,000, the Arena serves 
as the home rink of the Bridgeport Sound Tigers AHL hockey team and as 
the home court of Fairfield University's basketball team. The Ballpark 
at Harbor Yard serves as a minor-league baseball stadium, and was built 
in 1998 to serve as the homefield of the Bridgeport Bluefish. It is located 
downtown on a former brownfield site. It is visually prominent to commuters 
on I-95 or on passing trains. Kennedy Stadium serves as a community sports 
facility. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was the home of an Atlantic 
Coast Football League minor league football team, the Bridgeport Jets, 
a New York Jets farm team also known locally as the Hi-Ho Jets due to their 
sponsorship by the (Hi-Ho) D'Addario construction company. Fairfield University 
is located in the neighboring town of Fairfield, and many of the athletic 
teams play on campus. Only the men's and women's basketball teams play 
in Bridgeport. Nutmeg Curling Club, one of two curling clubs in Connecticut, 
is located in Bridgeport. It is the home club of the 2013 USA Mixed National 
Champions,[78] led by club members Derek Surka and Charissa Lin. The club 
is a member of the Grand National Curling Club Region. Due to Bridgeport's 
close proximity to Long Island Sound, many radio stations from New York 
are received clearly day and night in the market. These include WMCA, WFAN, 
WOR, WABC, WNYC, WCBS, WEPN, and WQEW.[81] plus some New York City, Long 
Island, other Connecticut and Hudson Valley radio stations Bridgeport was 
NBC's pioneer UHF TV test site from December 29, 1949 to August 23, 1952;[82] 
the equipment from the "Operation Bridgeport" tests was later deployed 
commercially at KPTV in Portland, Oregon (1952-1957). While Bridgeport 
is primarily served by New York City stations, some local UHF broadcasters 
operate today: Sikorsky Memorial Airport in neighboring Stratford is owned 
by the city of Bridgeport. It once provided regional flights to major cities, 
but commercial operations at the airport were terminated in November 1999. 
The main portion of the city is divided by major north/south roads that 
approximately parallel each other: The major East/West roads in the city 
include Barnum Avenue, Boston Avenue, Fairfield Avenue/Stratford Avenue, 
North Avenue, Capitol Avenue, State Street, and Railroad Avenue: Bridgeport 
has several major roadways. Interstate 95 and the Route 8/Route 25 Connector 
meet in downtown Bridgeport. I-95 runs east-west near the coast heading 
towards New York City to the southwest and Providence to the northeast. 
Routes 8 and 25 run north-south across the city, with the two routes splitting 
just north of the city. Route 8 continues towards Waterbury and Torrington 
and Route 25 continues towards the Danbury area. Both Routes 8 and 25 connect 
to the Merritt Parkway in the adjacent town of Trumbull. Other major surface 
arteries are U.S. 1 (the Boston Post Road), which runs east-west north 
of downtown, and Main Street, which runs north-south towards Trumbull center. 
The city also has several secondary state highways, namely, Route 127 (East 
Main Street), Route 130 (Connecticut Ave, Stratford Ave, Fairfield Ave 
and Water Street), and the Huntington Turnpike. The Bridgeport Traction 
Company provided streetcar service in the region until 1937. The Housatonic 
Railroad carried passengers North through the Pequonnock and Housatonic 
Valleys prior to 1933. The city is connected to nearby New York City by 
both Amtrak and Metro-North commuter trains, which serve Bridgeport's Metro-North 
station. Many residents commute to New York jobs on these trains, and the 
city to some extent is developing as an outpost of New York–based workers 
seeking cheaper rents and larger living spaces. Connecting service is also 
available to Waterbury via Metro-North, and New Haven via Amtrak and Metro-North. 
Shoreline East service links Old Saybrook and New London with New Haven, 
which extends to Bridgeport and Stamford during weekday rush hours only. 
The Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry service runs from Bridgeport across 
Long Island Sound to Port Jefferson, New York; the three vessels "Grand 
Republic", "P.T. Barnum" and "Park City" transport both automobiles and 
passengers. The Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority (GBTA) provides bus 
service to Bridgeport and its immediate suburbs. Route 2 the Coastal Link 
goes west to Norwalk and east to Westfield's Connecticut Post Mall in Milford, 
from where Connecticut Transit can bring passengers to the New Haven Green. 
Greyhound and Peter Pan Bus Lines both offer intercity bus service to points 
throughout the Northeast and points beyond. Bridgeport has five local historic 
districts, where exterior changes to structures are under the control of
