As player As manager Katsuya Nomura (野村 克也, Nomura Katsuya?, born June 
29, 1935 in Amino, Takeno District (Present: Kyotango), Kyoto prefecture, 
Japan) was one of Nippon Professional Baseball's (NPB) greatest catchers, 
and was also a long-time manager for the Yakult Swallows and the Hanshin 
Tigers of the Central League, and for the Rakuten Golden Eagles of the 
Pacific League. With 657 home runs and 1988 RBI, Nomura ranks number two 
on the career NPB lists in both categories, behind Sadaharu Oh. Nomura 
was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989. He lost his 
father at the age of three years, and his mother and brother raised him 
in poverty. He never made it to the national baseball tournaments in high 
school, but he was given a chance to play for the Nankai Hawks as a trainee 
without salary. During a career that spanned four decades from 1954 to 
1980, Nomura hit 657 home runs and led the Pacific League in homers eight 
straight seasons. (However, it should be taken into consideration that 
his home park, Osaka Stadium, measured only 276 feet down the lines until 
1972, and 300 feet from 1972 onward, and 380 feet to straightaway center—tiny 
dimensions by Major League Baseball standards.)[1] He finished his career 
with 2901 hits.[2] In 1965, Nomura won the league's first Triple Crown.[3] 
He was a player-manager between 1970 and 1977.[4] He played for 26 years, 
the longest NPB playing career until Kimiyasu Kudoh pitched in his 27th 
season in 2008.[5] Besides managing the Hawks from 1970 to 1977, Nomura 
steered the Yakult Swallows to four league titles in the 1990s, and won 
the Japan Series in 1993, 1995 and 1997. One of his important contribution 
was raising Atsuya Furuta to be a great catcher. Furuta is sometimes regarded 
as the successor of his boss, because he won the 1993 League MVP, and became 
the player-manager of Swallows in 2006–07. This is the only such case in 
the NPB after Nomura did so with the Hawks. After stepping down as the 
Yakult skipper, Nomura managed the Hanshin Tigers from 1999 to 2001 but 
resigned after Hanshin finished at the bottom of the Central League for 
three straight seasons. Additionally, Nomura's wife, Sachiyo, was in legal 
trouble in 2001 due to charges of tax evasion, which also contributed to 
his decision to relinquish his position.[6] Nomura was hired to manage 
an industrial league team, Shidax Baseball Club, in 2003. He led the team 
through the 2005 season. Nomura returned to the NPB as a manager for the 
2006 season with the Rakuten Golden Eagles. In so doing, he became the 
oldest manager in the history of NPB. On April 29, 2009, he reached the 
1,500 win mark in his managerial career, but he also holds the all-time 
record for number of losses.[7] He led the Eagles to their then-best-ever 
record of second place the regular season.[8] He retired at the end of 
the 2009 season and was replaced by American and former Hiroshima manager, 
Marty Brown. Prior to taking on the job of managing the Hanshin Tigers, 
Nomura also appeared on the Japanese cooking show Iron Chef as a guest 
judge in a handful of episodes, including one of Masaharu Morimoto's first 
episodes in the King Crab battle. In 2013, he played a funny character 
named "Boyaite-Bakkari-Man" in commercial message of Japanese soccer lottery.
