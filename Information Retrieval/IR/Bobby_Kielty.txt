Robert "Bobby" Michael Kielty (last name pronounced KELT-ee) (born August 
5, 1976) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. Bobby 
retired from professional baseball on 5 May 2014 as a member of the Lancaster 
Barnstormers.[1] Kielty graduated from Canyon Springs High School (Moreno 
Valley, California)[2] in 1994. After high school, he attended the University 
of Southern California from 1994 to 1995, Riverside City College from 1996 
to 1997, and the University of Mississippi from 1997 to 1998. Kielty was 
named MVP of the Cape Cod League after leading the league in batting average 
(.384) and RBI (45). Kielty was also named 1998 Summer Player of the Year 
by Baseball America. In 1999, he was signed by the Minnesota Twins as an 
amateur free agent. In 1999, Kielty began his minor league career with 
the Quad City River Bandits of the Midwest League. An eye problem forced 
him to miss more than a month of action (May 21-June 24), and he was disabled 
with a strained right hamstring (August 25-September 3). In only 69 games, 
Kielty batted .294 with 13 HR and 43 RBI and 12 SB. He homered in 3 consecutive 
games from August 14–16. Kielty was promoted to the New Britain Rock Cats 
of the Eastern League in 2000. He hit a grand slam against Portland on 
April 8, and another against Erie on May 26. He played in the Eastern League 
all-star game held in Bowie, Maryland. Kielty led the team in home runs 
(14), was second in RBI (65) and third in hits (118). His 98 walks led 
the league. He also had a .262 batting average for the season. On August 
26, Kielty was promoted to the Salt Lake Stingers of the Pacific Coast 
League, where he played in only nine games, and hit .242 with 2 RBI. He 
was rated the Twins eighth best prospect, and the ninth best prospect in 
the Eastern League.[citation needed] Kielty then began the 2001 season 
with the Twins' newly relocated Pacific Coast League team in Edmonton with 
the Edmonton Trappers. Then in early April, the Minnesota Twins purchased 
his contract and Kielty made his Major League debut on April 10 against 
the Detroit Tigers. The Twins optioned Kielty back down to Edmonton on 
April 21, but was recalled by the team on July 31. Kielty was demoted to 
Edmonton again on August 17, but then returned to the Twins on September 
3 and played in 28 of the Twins' last 37 games. Overall with Edmonton, 
he finished with a .287 average, 12 HR and 50 RBI, while with Minnesota 
he hit .250 with 2 HR and 14 RBI. Kielty once again started the 2002 season 
in Edmonton, but only appeared in two games before the Twins called him 
up. Kielty made his post-season debut against the Oakland Athletics in 
the ALDS, going 0 for 4 in the series. He then went 0 for 3 with a walk 
and RBI in the ALCS against the Anaheim Angels. After the season, he won 
the Bill Boni Award as the Twins' most outstanding rookie, and he finished 
fourth in the American League for AL Rookie of the Year. Kielty finished 
the year with a .291 average, 12 HR and 46 RBI in 112 games. After the 
Twins traded right fielder Matt Lawton to the New York Mets midway through 
the 2001 season, the team frequently used a platoon of Kielty and Dustan 
Mohr in right field. Twins fans were so accustomed to seeing one or the 
other player in right field that they dubbed the duo "Dusty Kielmohr".[citation 
needed] This situation persisted until midway through the 2003 season. 
Kielty began the 2003 season with a 12-game hitting streak with the Twins, 
and had his first career two-homer game on April 17 against Detroit. He 
was traded mid-season to the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 16, Minnesota traded 
Kielty to the Toronto Blue Jays for left fielder Shannon Stewart. He made 
his Blue Jays debut the next day against the Boston Red Sox, going 3 for 
4 with a home run and 3 RBI. Kielty's stats were .244, 13 HR and 57 RBI. 
In the off-season, the Blue Jays traded Kielty to the Oakland Athletics 
for starting pitcher Ted Lilly in a move that had been pre-planned by the 
two management groups as Athletics GM Billy Beane was a fan of Kielty's.[3] 
Kielty was the Athletics' Opening Day left fielder in 2004, and through 
May 19, he was hitting .250 with 4 HR and 14 RBI. After that, he hit .190 
with 3 HR and 17 RBI for the rest of the season, ending up with a .214 
average, 7 HR and 31 RBI. Kielty rebounded in 2005 by hitting .263 with 
10 HR and tied his career high with 57 RBI. Kielty missed 3 weeks in September 
due to an oblique muscle injury. In the 2005 season, Kielty, along with 
other members of the team, grew out his hair and refused to cut it. He 
earned the nickname "Ronny Mac" due to his similarity to McDonald's mascot, 
Ronald McDonald. Kielty cut his hair in the 2005 off-season, and began 
the 2006 season with the Athletics Triple A affiliate, the Sacramento River 
Cats. He spent 10 games there, batting .222 with 1 HR and 4 RBI before 
being recalled by the A's. With Oakland, he managed to play in 81 games, 
hitting .270 with 8 HR and 36 RBI, helping the club make the playoffs. 
Kielty did not appear in the Athletics series against the Minnesota Twins, 
in which the A's swept Minnesota, and he saw very limited action in the 
ALCS against the Detroit Tigers, as he went hitless in 2 at bats, as Oakland 
was swept. Kielty returned to Oakland for the 2007 season, however, he 
ran into injury problems, and played in just 13 games, hitting .200 with 
0 HR and 3 RBI. On July 23, 2007, Kielty was designated for assignment 
by the Athletics to make room for closer Huston Street. He was released 
a week later. On August 6, the Boston Red Sox signed Kielty to a minor-league 
deal, setting up his potential promotion as a fourth outfielder. On August 
18, the Red Sox called Kielty up from Triple-A Pawtucket, following the 
trade of Wily Mo Peña to the Washington Nationals. He hit .237 with 2 HR 
and 5 RBI in 10 games with Pawtucket. With Boston, Kielty saw limited action 
as the 4th outfielder, appearing in 20 games, hitting .231 with 1 HR and 
9 RBI. He saw no action in the Red Sox playoff series against the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim, which the Red Sox swept. In the ALCS against the Cleveland 
Indians, Kielty played in games 1 and 5 due to his past success against 
Cleveland starter C.C. Sabathia, hitting .400 with 2 RBI, and helping the 
team advance to the World Series. On October 28, in his only World Series 
at bat and on the first pitch, Kielty hit a pinch-hit solo home run in 
Game 4 of the 2007 World Series, which turned out to be the series-clinching 
game winner in the 4–3 final over the Colorado Rockies. He is the 21st 
player to hit a pinch-hit home run in the World Series. The at-bat would 
turn out to be Kielty's final appearance in a major league game. On February 
6, 2008, the Boston Globe reported that the Red Sox had re-signed Kielty 
to a one-year non-guaranteed deal.[4] On March 31, 2008, Kielty accepted 
an assignment to the Pawtucket Red Sox rather than opt for free agency.[5] 
On April 25, the Boston Globe reported that Kielty had surgery on his left 
hand and would be out 4 to 6 weeks.[6] Kielty asked for and was granted 
his release from the Red Sox organization on July 13, 2008. Kielty re-entered 
the Twins system when he signed a minor league contract on August 11, 2008. 
He was assigned to the Rochester Red Wings, the Twins' Triple-A affiliate, 
and played three weeks with the ballclub. When the major league rosters 
expanded on September 1, Kielty was not among those called up to Minnesota. 
Since Kielty's contract had a clause that allowed him to leave the organization 
if he was not called up to the Twins, Kielty was granted his release from 
the Twins system prior to the Red Wings' final game of the season on September 
1.[7] In January 2009, Kielty signed a minor league contract with the New 
York Mets.[8] He was released on June 22. On February 3, 2011, Kielty signed
