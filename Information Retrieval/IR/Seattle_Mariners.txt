The Seattle Mariners are an American professional baseball team based in 
Seattle, Washington. The Mariners compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
as a member club of the American League (AL) West division. The team joined 
the AL as an expansion team in 1977. Since July 1999, the Mariners' home 
ballpark has been Safeco Field, located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. 
The "Mariners" name originates from the prominence of marine culture in 
the city of Seattle. They are nicknamed the M's, a title featured in their 
primary logo from 1987–1992. The current team colors of Navy blue, Northwest 
green, and silver were adopted prior to the 1993 season after having been 
royal blue and gold since the team's inception.[1] Their mascot is the 
Mariner Moose. The organization did not field a winning team until 1991, 
and any real success eluded them until 1995 when they won their first division 
championship and defeated the New York Yankees in the ALDS. The game-winning 
hit in Game 5, in which Edgar Martínez drove home Ken Griffey Jr. to win 
the game in the 11th inning, clinched a series win for the Mariners, and 
has since become an iconic moment in team history. The Mariners won 116 
games in 2001, which set the American League record for most wins in a 
single season and tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the Major League record 
for most wins in a single season. Through the 2016 season, the franchise 
has finished with a losing record in 27 of 40 seasons. The Mariners are 
one of eight Major League Baseball teams who have never won a World Series 
championship, and one of two (along with the Washington Nationals) never 
to have played in a World Series.[4] The Mariners were created as a result 
of a lawsuit. In 1970, in the aftermath of the Seattle Pilots' purchase 
and relocation to Milwaukee (as the Milwaukee Brewers) by future Commissioner 
of Baseball Bud Selig, the city of Seattle, King County, and the state 
of Washington (represented by then-state attorney general and later U.S. 
Senator Slade Gorton) sued the American League for breach of contract.[5] 
Confident that Major League Baseball would return to Seattle within a few 
years, King County built the multi-purpose Kingdome, which would become 
home to the NFL's expansion Seattle Seahawks in 1976. The name "Mariners" 
was chosen by club officials in August 1976 from over 600 names submitted 
by 15,000 entrants in a name-the-team contest.[6] The Mariners played their 
first game on April 6, 1977, to a sold-out crowd of 57,762 at the Kingdome, 
losing 7–0 to the California Angels.[7] The first home run in team history 
was hit on April 10, 1977, by designated hitter Juan Bernhardt.[8] That 
year, star pitcher Diego Seguí, in his last major league season, became 
the only player to play for both the Pilots and the Mariners. The Mariners 
finished with a 64–98 record, echoing the record the 1969 Pilots once held. 
In 1979, Seattle hosted the 50th Major League Baseball All-Star Game. After 
the 1981 season, the Mariners were sold to California businessman and future 
U.S. Ambassador to Spain George Argyros. During the 1992–93 offseason, 
the Mariners hired manager Lou Piniella, who had led the Cincinnati Reds 
to victory in the 1990 World Series. Mariner fans embraced Piniella,[9] 
and he would helm the team from 1993 through 2002, winning two American 
League Manager of the Year Awards along the way. The 2001 Mariners club 
finished with a record of 116-46, leading all of Major League Baseball 
in winning percentage for the duration of the season and easily winning 
the American League West division championship. In doing so, the team broke 
the 1998 Yankees American League single-season record of 114 wins and matched 
the all-time MLB single-season record for wins set by the 1906 Chicago 
Cubs. At the end of the season, Ichiro Suzuki won the AL MVP, AL Rookie 
of the Year, and one of three outfield Gold Glove Awards, becoming the 
first player since the 1975 Boston Red Sox's Fred Lynn to win all three 
in the same season. On October 22, 2008 the Mariners announced the hiring 
of Jack Zduriencik, formerly scouting director of the Milwaukee Brewers, 
as their general manager.[10] Weeks later, on November 18, the team named 
Oakland Athletics bench coach Don Wakamatsu as its new field manager. Wakamatsu 
and Zduriencik hired an entirely new coaching staff for 2009, which included 
former World Series MVP John Wetteland as bullpen coach. The off-season 
also saw a litany of roster moves, headlined by a 12-player, 3-team trade 
that included sending All-Star closer J. J. Putz to the New York Mets and 
brought 5 players—including prospect Mike Carp and outfielder Endy Chávez 
from New York and outfielder Franklin Gutierrez from the Cleveland Indians—to 
Seattle. Many of the moves, like the free agent signing of Mike Sweeney, 
were made in part with the hope of squelching the clubhouse infighting 
that plagued the Mariners in 2008. It also saw the return of Seattle favorite 
Griffey Jr. The 2009–10 offseason was highlighted by the trade for 2008 
American League Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee from the Philadelphia Phillies, 
the signing of third baseman Chone Figgins and the contract extension of 
star pitcher "King" Félix Hernández. On June 2, 2010, Griffey Jr. announced 
his retirement after 22 MLB seasons.[11] On August 9, 2010 the Mariners 
fired field manager Don Wakamatsu along with bench coach Ty Van Burkleo, 
pitching coach Rick Adair and performance coach Steve Hecht. Daren Brown, 
the manager of the AAA affiliate Tacoma Rainiers, took over as interim 
field manager. Roger Hansen, the former Minor League catching coordinator, 
was promoted to bench coach. Carl Willis, the former Minor League pitching 
coordinator, was promoted to pitching coach.[12] The Mariners hired former 
Cleveland Indians manager Eric Wedge as their new manager on October 19, 
2010.[13] On November 10, 2010, Dave Niehaus, the Mariners' play-by-play 
announcer since the team's inception, died of a heart attack at the age 
of 75.[14] In memory of Niehaus, Seattle rapper Macklemore wrote a tribute 
song called "My Oh My" in December 2010. He performed the song at the Mariners' 
Opening Day game on April 8, 2011. On April 21, 2012, Philip Humber of 
the Chicago White Sox threw the third perfect game in Chicago White Sox 
history against the Mariners at Safeco Field in Seattle. It was the 21st 
perfect game in MLB history.[15] On June 8, 2012, the Mariners starting 
pitcher Kevin Millwood and five other pitchers combined to throw the tenth 
combined no-hitter in MLB history and the first in team history. The last 
combined one occurred in 2003, when six Houston Astros no-hit the New York 
Yankees in New York. The six pitchers used in a no-hitter is a major league 
record. On August 15, 2012, Félix Hernández pitched the first perfect game 
in team history, shutting down the Tampa Bay Rays 1-0 at Safeco Field. 
It was the 23rd perfect game in Major League Baseball history.[16] The 
Mariners became the first team in Major League Baseball to be involved 
in a perfect game two times in one season.[17] On August 28, 2015, General 
Manager Jack Zduriencik was relieved of his position by the team. On September 
28, 2015, former GM of the L.A. Angels of Anaheim, Jerry Dipoto, was hired 
as the new General Manager.[18] On October 9, 2015, manager Lloyd McClendon 
was fired, and the search for a new manager was begun.[19] On April 27, 
2016, Nintendo of America issued a press release stating it would sell 
most shares it held of Seattle Mariners ownership to First Avenue Entertainment 
limited partnership. Nintendo retained a 10% ownership of the team after 
the sale was completed in August 2016.[20] The Mariners donned their current 
uniforms in 1993. White jerseys and pants are worn for most home games, 
while gray jerseys and pants are worn on the road. In 2011, the team brought 
back an alternate "Northwest Green" jersey that was previously part of 
the uniform set from 1994 to 1996 to be worn during Friday home games.[21][22] 
A navy blue alternate jersey is worn for occasional road games; other variations 
of a navy jersey had been used as home alternates prior to the reintroduction 
of the Northwest Green jersey. A navy blue cap that features a ball and 
compass "S" logo is paired with the home white, road gray, and navy blue 
jerseys. A variation of this cap with a Northwest Green brim is worn with 
the home alternate jersey. In January 2015 the team announced a new alternate 
uniform to be worn for Sunday home games. This cream-colored "fauxback" 
uniform features the current logo and lettering style in a royal blue and 
gold color scheme, a throwback to the original team colors. Unlike the 
rest of the uniform set, the back of the jersey does not display the player 
name.[21][23] The cap features the current cap logo in the throwback colors.[23][24] 
The Peoria Sports Complex in Peoria, Arizona, has been the Mariners' home 
spring training facility since 1994. The complex is shared with the San 
Diego Padres.[25] On March 25, 2013, in a 16-0 victory over the Cincinnati 
Reds, the Mariners broke the team record for total home runs during a spring 
training season with 52.[26] This is a partial list listing the past 15 
completed regular seasons. For the full season records, see here. First 
team of 2008 to officially be eliminated from the 2008 postseason. Worst 
record since 1983, which was the last time they had lost over 100 games 
in a season. First team in MLB history to lose 100 games with a $100 million 
payroll. Dave Niehaus won the Ford C. Frick Award, presented by the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Ichiro and Franklin Gutiérrez won the 
2010 Rawlings Gold Glove awards for AL Right Field and Center Field, respectively. 
Former Executive Pat Gillick was elected to the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame by the Veterans Committee. Ichiro had his tenth consecutive season 
batting over .300 with 200 hits, winning a Rawlings Gold Glove Award, and 
appearing in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The following elected 
members of the Baseball Hall of Fame spent part of their careers with the 
Mariners.[30] Pat Gillick† Goose Gossage Ken Griffey Jr. Rickey Henderson 
Randy Johnson‡ Gaylord Perry Dick Williams Dave Niehaus Seattle Mariners 
former chairman and CEO John Ellis announced on June 14, 1997 the creation 
of a Mariners Hall of Fame. It is operated by the Seattle Mariners organization. 
It honors the players, staff and other individuals that greatly contributed 
to the history and success of the Mariners franchise. It is located at 
the Baseball Museum of the Pacific Northwest in Safeco Field. Official 
team policy states, "To be eligible to have one's number retired, the former 
Mariners should have either a.) been elected to the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame and been in a Mariners uniform for at least five years, or b.) 
come close to such election and have spent substantially his entire career 
with the Mariners. Eligibility shall not commence until after the former 
player has been voted on once for the National Baseball Hall of Fame, which 
for all practical purposes, means six years after retirement." [34] Ken 
Griffey Jr.'s number was retired at the beginning of the 2016 season, with 
the retirement ceremony taking place on August 6, 2016.[35] Griffey had 
been elected to the Hall of Fame in January of that year. Currently, only 
one other player has definitively met the requirements to have his number 
retired: Randy Johnson, who played 10 seasons with the Mariners (1989-1998) 
and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2015. Edgar Martínez, who played 
his entire major-league career in Seattle and first appeared on the Hall 
of Fame ballot in 2010, may be eligible to have his number retired. His 
best Hall of Fame voting count was in 2016, when he received 43.4% of the 
vote (75% is required for induction). Whether this constitutes coming "close" 
to Hall of Fame election is unclear. Martinez retired from MLB Baseball 
after the 2004 season, but returned as the Mariners' Hitting Coach in mid-2015, 
and continues to wear #11. Despite not officially retiring their numbers, 
the team has not reissued the numbers 19 (Jay Buhner) or 51 (Ichiro Suzuki) 
to any uniformed staff since they left the team. Number 51, worn by Randy 
Johnson, was withheld from players from 1998 until 2001, when it was issued 
to Ichiro Suzuki upon his request after wearing it for his entire career 
in Japan. It has presumably been taken out of circulation again, following 
Ichiro's 2012 trade to the Yankees coupled with Johnson's 2015 election 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The number 11 of Edgar Martínez was not 
issued from his retirement as a player in 2004 until his return to the 
Mariners as hitting coach in 2015. Number 14 (Lou Piniella) was not given 
to any uniformed personnel between Piniella's 2002 departure and 2015, 
but it was issued to third-base coach Manny Acta for the 2016 season. Jackie 
Robinson's number 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball on April 
15, 1997. Uniform number 00 is presumed off-limits, as it has been worn 
by the Mariner Moose since 1997 (outfielder Jeffrey Leonard was the last 
player to wear 00 for the M's, in 1990). From 1990 to 1996, the Moose wore 
the last 2 digits of the year of the current season. Rally Fries are a 
baseball tradition started by Mariners broadcaster Mike Blowers in 2007. 
During a game against the Cincinnati Reds, a fan tried to catch a foul 
ball along the right-field line but in turn spilled his tray of french 
fries along the track. While chatting on the air and seeing the mishap, 
Blowers' partner, Dave Sims, suggested that he should send a new tray of 
fries to the fan. Blowers agreed, and sent his intern to deliver a plate 
of fries to the man.[36] At the Mariners' next game, fans made signs and 
boards asking Blowers for fries as well. Coincidentally, every time the 
fries were delivered, the Mariners seem to score or rally from a deficit, 
and thus the "Rally Fries" were created. This became so popular with the 
fans that signs were even seen when the Mariners were the visiting team, 
although on August 1, 2009, Blowers established that he only gives out 
fries at home games.[37] Generally, Blowers will select a person or a group 
of people that appeals to him, whether it is through fans wearing elaborate 
costumes or waving funny signs and boards. The fries are usually delivered 
from Ivar's, a Seattle-based seafood restaurant with a location at Safeco 
Field. The amount of fries given out varies with the size of the winning 
group of fans. The winners are generally selected around the 5th or 6th 
inning, although potential candidates are shown in almost every inning 
beforehand. As the 2011 season progressed, the Mariners marketing staff 
came up with an idea to encourage the growing fanbase of star pitcher "King" 
Félix Hernández. Every Hernandez start at Safeco Field is now accompanied 
by the King's Court, a designated cheering section for fans to sing, chant, 
and cheer while donning yellow T-shirts and K cards that are supplied by 
the team. The King's Court is both a personal rooting section for Hernandez 
and trend-setter for Safeco Field. The team encouraged fans to dress like 
Larry Bernandez, Hernandez's alter ego from a Mariners TV Commercial, or 
show up in wacky costumes, rewarding the best with a ceremonial turkey 
leg.[38] The Supreme Court is a special occurrence when the King's Court 
is extended to the entirety of Safeco Field. The first Supreme Court was 
Félix's first home game following his perfect game in 2012. Since then 
it has occurred each year at Félix's first home game. Pitchers Catchers

KIRO (AM 710 ESPN Radio), which previously broadcast Mariners contests 
from 1985–2002. Former flagship stations include KOMO 1000 AM (2003–2008), 
and KVI 570 AM (1977–1984). Television rights are held by Root Sports Northwest. 
In years past, Mariners games have also appeared in Seattle on over-the-air 
stations KING-TV, KIRO-TV, KTZZ-TV (now KZJO), and KSTW. Selected Mariners 
games are also available on Canadian television, due to an agreement between 
Root Sports Northwest and Sportsnet. Since 2013, Rick Rizzs and Aaron Goldsmith 
have called games on the radio. The television broadcasts are anchored 
by play-by-play announcer Dave Sims and color commentator (and former Mariners 
player) Mike Blowers.[39] Seattle radio personality Matt Pitman hosts the 
post-game show on the Mariners' radio network, along with clubhouse reporter 
Shannon Drayer. Spanish-language radio broadcast duties are handled by 
Alex Rivera on play-by-play and former second baseman Julio Cruz providing 
color commentary. The Mariners' broadcast team for 2010 featured Dave Niehaus 
and Rizzs—back for their 32nd and 23rd seasons with the club, respectively—as 
well as Sims and Blowers. For the first three innings of each game, Niehaus 
worked the television broadcast with Blowers while Rizzs and Sims handled 
radio duties; after the third inning, Niehaus and Sims traded places. Niehaus, 
who had broadcast for the Mariners since their inaugural season of 1977, 
died on November 10, 2010. For the 2011 season, Dave Niehaus' duties in 
the broadcast booth were filled by a collection of former Mariners broadcasters 
such as Ron Fairly, Ken Levine, and Ken Wilson; and former Mariners' players 
such as Dave Valle, Dan Wilson, Jay Buhner, and Dave Henderson. Tom Hutyler 
has been the Mariners' public address announcer since 1987, first at the 
Kingdome, and presently at Safeco Field.[40] While KOMO 1000 AM was the 
Mariners' flagship radio station, Hutyler occasionally hosted the post-game
