The history of Ohio includes many thousands of years of human activity. 
What is now Ohio was probably first settled by Paleo-Indian people, who 
lived in the area as early as 13,000 B.C. A fossil dated between 11,727 
and 11,424 B.C. indicates they hunted large animals, including Jefferson's 
ground sloth, using stone tools.[1] Later ancestors of Native Americans 
were known as the Archaic peoples. Sophisticated successive cultures of 
precolonial peoples indigenous peoples, such as the Adena, Hopewell and 
Mississippian, built monumental earthworks as part of their religious and 
political expression: mounds and walled enclosures, some of which have 
survived to the present.[citation needed] By the mid-18th century, a few 
American and French fur traders engaged historic Native American tribes 
in present-day Ohio in the fur trade. American settlement in the Ohio territory 
came after the American Revolutionary War. The Congress prohibited slavery 
in the Ohio Territory. Ohio's population increased rapidly, chiefly by 
migrants from New England, New York and Pennsylvania. Southerners settled 
along the southern part of the territory, as they traveled mostly by the 
Ohio River. Yankees, especially in the "Western reserve" (near Cleveland) 
supported modernization, public education and anti-slavery policies. The 
state supported the Union in the American Civil War, although antiwar Copperhead 
sentiment was strong in Southern settlements. After the Civil War, Ohio 
became a major industrial state. The Great Lakes brought in iron ore and 
provided a route for exports, as did railroads. In the late 19th and early 
20th centuries, the fast-growing industries created jobs that attracted 
hundreds of thousands immigrants from Europe. In World War I Europe was 
closed off and white newcomers came from Appalachia, while blacks came 
from the states to the South. The cultures of its major cities became much 
more diverse with the traditions, cultures, foods and music of the new 
arrivals. Ohio's industries were integral to American industrial power 
in the 20th century. Economic restructuring in steel and other manufacturing 
cost the state many jobs in the later 20th century as heavy industry declined. 
The economy in the 21st century has seen the loss of many manufacturing 
jobs, and a switch to service industries such as medicine and education. 
The Late Archaic period featured the development of focal subsistence economies 
and regionalization of cultures. Regional cultures in Ohio include the 
Maple Creek Culture(Excavations) of southwestern Ohio, the Glacial Kame 
Culture culture of western Ohio (especially northwestern Ohio), and the 
Red Ochre and Old Copper cultures across much of northern Ohio. Flint Ridge, 
located in present-day Licking County, provided flint, an extremely important 
raw material and trade good. Objects made from Flint Ridge flint have been 
found as far east as the Atlantic coast, as far west as Kansas City, and 
as far south as Louisiana, demonstrating the wide network of prehistoric 
trading cultures.[citation needed] About 800 BC, Late Archaic cultures 
were supplanted by the Adena culture. The Adenas were mound builders. Many 
of their thousands of burial mounds in Ohio have survived. Following the 
Adena culture was the Hopewell culture (c. 100 to c. 400 C.E.), which also 
built sophisticated mounds and earthworks, some of which survive at Hopewell 
and Newark Earthworks. They used their constructions as astronomical observatories 
and places of ritual celebration. The Fort Ancient culture also built mounds, 
including some effigy mounds. Researchers first considered the Serpent 
Mound in Adams County, Ohio to be an Adena mound. It is the largest effigy 
mound in the United States and one of Ohio's best-known landmarks. Scholars 
believe it may have been a more recent work of Fort Ancient people.[citation 
needed] In Southern Ohio alone, archaeologists have pinpointed 10000 mounds 
used as burial sites and have excavated another 1000 earth-walled enclosures, 
including one enormous fortification with a circumference of about 3.5 
miles, enclosing about 100 acres. We now know from a great variety of items 
found in the mound tombs - large ceremonial blades chipped from obsidian 
rock formations in Yellowstone National Park; embossed breast-plates, ornaments 
and weapons fashioned from copper nuggets from the Great Lakes region; 
decorative objects cut from sheets of mica from the southern Appalachians; 
conch shells from the Atlantic seaboard; and ornaments made from shark 
and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf of Mexico - that the Mound 
Builders participated in a vast trading network that linked together hundreds 
of Native Americans across the continent.[2] When modern Europeans began 
to arrive in North America, they traded with numerous Native American (also 
known as American Indian) tribes for furs in exchange for goods. When the 
Iroquois Confederacy depleted the beaver and other game in its territory 
in the New York region, they launched a war known as the Beaver Wars, destroying 
or scattering the contemporary inhabitants of the Tennessee region. During 
the Beaver Wars in the 1650s, the Iroquois nearly destroyed the Erie along 
the shore of Lake Erie. Thereafter, the Iroquois claimed Ohio and West 
Virginia lands as hunting grounds. For several decades, the land was nearly 
uninhabited.[citation needed] Modern studies show 80% of cranial samples 
from Hopewell remains indicate a cephalic index in the range of being dolicocephalic. 
Analysis of Hopewell remains indicate shared mtDNA mutations unique with 
lineages from China, Korea, Japan, and Mongolia,[3] while bone collagen 
from Eastern North American native remains indicate maize was not a large 
part of their diet until after B.P. 1000. As of 2003, maize had only been 
discovered at one archaeological dig site in Ohio.[3] In the 17th century, 
the French were the first modern Europeans to explore what became known 
as Ohio Country.[4] In 1663, it became part of New France, a royal province 
of French Empire, and northeastern Ohio was further explored by Robert 
La Salle in 1669.[5] Fort Miami near present-day Toledo was constructed 
in 1680 by New France Governor-General Louis de Buade de Frontenac.[6] 
During the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to 
control the fur trade in the region, linked to their settlements in present-day 
Canada and what they called the Illinois Country along the Mississippi 
River. They built Fort Sandoské by 1750 (and perhaps "Fort" Junundat in 
1754).[6] By the 1730s, population pressure from expanding European colonies 
on the Atlantic coast compelled several groups of Native Americans to relocate 
to the Ohio Country. From the east, the Delaware and Shawnee arrived, and 
Wyandot and Ottawa from the north. The Miami lived in what is now western 
Ohio. The Mingo formed out of Iroquois who migrated west into the Ohio 
lands, as well as some refugee remnants of other tribes. Christopher Gist 
was one of the first English-speaking explorers to travel through and write 
about the Ohio Country in 1749. When British traders such as George Croghan 
started to do business in the Ohio Country, the French and their northern 
Indian allies drove them out. In 1752 the French raided the Miami Indian 
town of Pickawillany (modern Piqua, Ohio). The French began military occupation 
of the Ohio Valley in 1753. By the mid-18th century, British traders were 
rivaling French traders in the area.[7] They had occupied a trading post 
called Loramie's Fort, which the French attacked from Canada in 1752, renaming 
it for a Frenchman named Loramie and establishing a trading post there. 
In the early 1750s George Washington was sent to the Ohio Country by the 
Ohio Company to survey, and the fight for control of the territory would 
spark Europe's Seven Years' War with the French and Indian War. It was 
in the Ohio Country where George Washington lost the Battle of Fort Necessity 
to Louis Coulon de Villiers in 1754, and the subsequent Battle of the Monongahela 
to Charles Michel de Langlade and Jean-Daniel Dumas to retake the country 
1755. The Treaty of Paris ceded the country to the Great Britain in 1763. 
During this period the country was routinely engaged in turmoil, with massacres 
and battles occurring among the tribes. British military occupation in 
the region contributed to the outbreak of Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763. 
Ohio Indians participated in that war until an armed expedition in Ohio 
led by Colonel Henry Bouquet brought about a truce. Another colonial military 
expedition into the Ohio Country in 1774 brought Lord Dunmore's War to 
a conclusion. Lord Dunmore constructed Fort Gower on the Hocking River 
in 1774.[6] During the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans in 
the Ohio Country were divided over which side to support. For example, 
the Shawnee leader Blue Jacket and the Delaware leader Buckongahelas sided 
with the British. Cornstalk (Shawnee) and White Eyes (Delaware) sought 
to remain friendly with the rebellious colonists. There was major fighting 
in 1782.[8] American colonial frontiersmen often did not differentiate 
between friendly and hostile Indians, however. Cornstalk was killed by 
American militiamen, and White Eyes may have been. One of the most tragic 
incidents of the war — the Gnadenhutten massacre of 1782 — took place in 
Ohio.[9] With the American victory in the Revolutionary War, the British 
ceded claims to Ohio and its territory in the West as far as the Mississippi 
River to the new nation. Between 1784 and 1789, the states of Virginia, 
Massachusetts and Connecticut ceded their earlier land claims to the Ohio 
territories to Congress, but Virginia and Connecticut maintained reserves.[10] 
These areas were known as the Virginia Military District and Connecticut 
Western Reserve.[11][12] In 1787, the United States of America created 
the Northwest Territory under the Northwest Ordinance of that year. Ebenezer 
Sproat became a shareholder of the Ohio Company of Associates, and was 
engaged as a surveyor with the company.[13][14] On April 7, 1788, Ebenezer 
Sproat and a group of American pioneers to the Northwest Territory, led 
by Rufus Putnam, arrived at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers 
to establish Marietta, Ohio as the first permanent American settlement 
in the Northwest Territory.[15][16][17] Marietta was founded by New Englanders.[18] 
It was the first of what would become a prolific number of New England 
settlements in what was then the Northwest Territory.[19] These New Englanders 
or "Yankees" as they were called, were descended from the Puritan English 
colonists who had settled New England in the 1600s and were members of 
the Congregationalist church. Correspondingly, the first church constructed 
in Marietta was a Congregationalist church which was constructed 1786.[19] 
Colonel Sproat, with his tall and commanding presence, was a notable member 
of the pioneer settlement of Marietta. He greatly impressed the local Indians, 
who in admiration dubbed him "Hetuck", meaning "eye of the buck deer" "Big 
Buckeye".[20][21][22] Historians believe this is how Ohio came to be known 
as the Buckeye State and its residents as Buckeyes.[23] The Miami Company 
(also referred to as the "Symmes Purchase") managed settlement of land 
in the southwestern section. The Connecticut Land Company administered 
settlement in the Connecticut Western Reserve in present-day Northeast 
Ohio. A heavy flood of migrants came from New York and especially New England, 
where there had been a growing hunger for land as population increased 
before the Revolutionary War. Most traveled to Ohio by wagon and stagecoach, 
following former Indian paths such as the Northern Trace. Many also traveled 
part of the way by barges on the Mohawk River across New York state. Farmers 
who settled in western New York after the war sometimes moved on to one 
or more locations in Ohio in their lifetimes, as new lands kept opening 
to the west. American settlement of the Northwest Territory was resisted 
by Native Americans in the Northwest Indian War. The natives were eventually 
conquered by General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. 
They ceded much of present-day Ohio to the United States by the Treaty 
of Greenville, concluded in 1795. Furthermore, in regards to the Leni Lenape 
Native Americans living in the region, Congress decided that 10,000 acres 
on the Muskingum River in the present state of Ohio would "be set apart 
and the property thereof be vested in the Moravian Brethren ... or a society 
of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity."[24] 
The US Congress prohibited slavery in the territory. (Once the population 
grew and the territory achieved statehood, the citizens could have legalized 
slavery, but chose not to do so.) The states of the Midwest would be known 
as Free States, in contrast to those states south of the Ohio River. Migrants 
to the latter came chiefly from Virginia and other slaveholding states, 
and brought their culture and slaves with them. As Northeastern states 
abolished slavery in the coming two generations, the free states would 
be known as Northern States. The Northwest Territory originally included 
areas previously called Ohio Country and Illinois Country. As Ohio prepared 
for statehood, Indiana Territory was carved out, reducing the Northwest 
Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern 
half of Michigan's lower peninsula. With Ohio's population reaching 45,000 
in December 1801, Congress determined that the population was growing rapidly 
and Ohio could begin the path to statehood. The assumption was the territory 
would have in excess of the required 60,000 residents by the time it became 
a state. Congress passed the Enabling Act of 1802 that outlined the process 
for Ohio to seek statehood. The residents convened a constitutional convention. 
They used numerous provisions from other states and rejected slavery. On 
February 19, 1803, President Jefferson signed the act of Congress that 
approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution. Congress did not pass a specific 
resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. The current custom 
of Congress' declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 
1812, when Louisiana was admitted as the 18th state. Ohio played a key 
role in the War of 1812, as it was on the front line in the Western theater 
and the scene of several notable battles both on land and in Lake Erie. 
Throughout much of the 19th century, industry was rapidly introduced to 
complement an existing agricultural economy. One of the first iron manufacturing 
plants opened near Youngstown in 1804 called Hopewell Furnace. By the mid-19th 
century, 48 blast furnaces were operating in the state, most in the southern 
portions of the state.[25] Discovery of coal deposits aided the further 
development of the steel industry in the state, and by 1853 Cleveland was 
the third largest iron and steel producer in the country. The first Bessemer 
converter was purchased by the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company, which eventually 
became part of the U.S. Steel Corporation following the merger of Federal 
Steel Company and Carnegie Steel, the first billion-dollar American corporation.[25] 
The first open-hearth furnace used for steel production was constructed 
by the Otis Steel Company in Cleveland, and by 1892, Ohio ranked as the 
2nd-largest steel producing state behind Pennsylvania.[25] Republic Steel 
was founded in Youngstown in 1899, and was at one point the nation's third 
largest producer. Armco, now AK Steel, was founded in Middletown also in 
1899. Tobacco processing plants were found in Dayton by the 1810s and Cincinnati 
became known as "Porkopolis" in being the nation's capital of pork processing, 
and by 1850 it was the third largest manufacturing city in the country.[25] 
Mills were established throughout the state, including one in Steubenville 
in 1815 which employed 100 workers. Manufacturers produced farming machinery, 
including Cincinnati residents Cyrus McCormick, who invented the reaper, 
and Obed Hussey, who developed an early version of the mower.[26] Columbus 
became known as the "Buggy Capital of the World" for its nearly two dozen 
carriage manufacturers.[citation needed] Dayton became a technological 
center in the 1880s with the National Cash Register Company.[27] For roughly 
ten years during the Ohio Oil Rush in the late 19th century, the state 
enjoyed the position of leading producer of crude oil in the country. By 
1884, 86 oil refineries were operating in Cleveland and was home to Standard 
Oil, making it the "oil capital of the world,"[28] while producing the 
world's first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller. Herbert H. Dow founded 
the Dow Chemical Company in Cleveland in 1895, today the world's second 
largest chemical manufacturer. In 1898 Frank Seiberling named his rubber 
company after the first person to vulcanize rubber, Charles Goodyear, which 
today is known as Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Seeing the need to 
replace steel-rimmed carriage tires with rubber, Harvey Firestone started 
Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and began selling to Henry Ford. The 
Ohio Automobile Company eventually became known as Packard, while Benjamin 
Goodrich entered the rubber industry in 1870 in Akron, founding Goodrich, 
Tew & Company, better known as the Goodrich Corporation in the present 
era. By the late 19th century, Ohio had become a global industrial center.[29] 
Natural resources contributed to the industrial growth, including salt, 
iron ore, timber, limestone, coal, natural gas, and the discovery of oil 
in northwestern Ohio led to the growth of the port of Toledo.[29] By 1908, 
the state had 9,581 miles of railroad linking coal mines, oil fields, and 
industries with the world.[29] Commercial enterprise began to prosper around 
towns with banks.[29] William Procter and James Gamble started a company 
which produced a high quality, inexpensive soap called Ivory, which is 
still the best known product today of Procter and Gamble. Michael Joseph 
Owens invented the first semi-automatic glass-blowing machine while working 
for the Toledo Glass Company.[30] The company was owned by Edward Libbey, 
and together the pair would form companies which ultimately became known 
as Owens-Illinois and Owens Corning. Wilbur and Orville Wright invented 
the first airplane in Dayton. Charles Kettering invented the first automatic 
starter for automobiles, and was the co-founder of Delco Electronics, today 
part of Delphi Corporation. The Battelle Memorial Institute perfected xerography, 
resulting in the company Xerox. At Cincinnati's Children's Hospital, Albert 
Sabin developed the first oral polio vaccine, which was administered throughout 
the world. In 1955 Joseph McVicker tested a wallpaper cleaner in Cincinnati 
schools, eventually becoming known as the product Play-Doh. The same year 
the Tappan Stove Company created the first microwave oven made for commercial, 
home use. James Spangler invented the first commercially successful portable 
vacuum cleaner, which he sold to The Hoover Company. African American inventors 
based in Ohio achieved prominence. After witnessing a car and carriage 
crash, Garrett Morgan invented one of the earliest traffic lights; he was 
a leader in the Cleveland Association of Colored Men. Frederick McKinley 
Jones invented refrigeration devices for transportation which ultimately 
led to the Thermo King Corporation. In Cincinnati Granville Woods invented 
the telegraphony, which he sold to a telephone company. John P. Parker 
of Ripley invented the Parker Pulverizer and screw for tobacco processes. 
Ohio's economic growth was aided by their pursuit of infrastructure. By 
the late 1810s, the National Road crossed the Appalachian Mountains, connecting 
Ohio with the east coast. The Ohio River aided the agricultural economy 
by allowing farmers to move their goods by water to the southern states 
and the port of New Orleans. The construction of the Erie Canal in the 
1820s allowed Ohio businesses to ship their goods through Lake Erie and 
to the east coast, which was followed by the completion of the Ohio and 
Erie Canal and the connection of Lake Erie with the Ohio River. This gave 
the state complete water access to the world within the borders of the 
United States. Other canals included Miami and Erie Canal.[26] The Welland 
Canal would eventually give the state alternative global routes through 
Canada. The first railroad in Ohio was a 33-mile line completed in 1836 
called the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad, connecting Toledo with Adrian, 
Michigan. The Ohio Loan Law of 1837 allowed the state to loan one-third 
of construction costs to businesses, passed initially to aid the construction 
of canals, but instead used heavily for the construction of railroads. 
The Little Miami Railroad was granted a state charter in 1836 and was completed 
in 1848, connecting Cincinnati with Springfield. Construction of a commuter 
rail began in 1851 called the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad. 
This allowed the affluent of Cincinnati to move to newly developed communities 
outside the city along the rail. The Ohio and Mississippi Railroad was 
given financial support from the city of Cincinnati and eventually connected 
them with St. Louis, while the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crossed the 
Appalachians in the mid-1850s and connected the state with the east coast.[31] 
The investment in infrastructure complemented Ohio's central location and 
put it at the heart of the nation's transportation system traveling north 
and south and east and west, and also gave the state a headstart during 
the national industrialization process which occurred between 1870-1920.[27] 
Water ports would pop up along Lake Erie, including the Port of Ashtabula, 
Port of Cleveland, Port of Conneaut, Fairport Harbor, Port of Huron, Port 
of Lorain, Port of Marblehead, Port of Sandusky, and Port of Toledo. The 
Port of Cincinnati was built on the Ohio River. Following the commercialisation 
of air travel, Ohio became a key route for east to west transportation. 
The first commercial cargo flight occurred between Dayton and Columbus 
in 1910. Cleveland Hopkins International Airport was built in 1925 and 
became home to the first air traffic control tower, ground to air radio 
control, airfield lighting system, and commuter rail link. The Interstate 
Highway System brought new travel routes to the state in the mid-20th century, 
further making Ohio a transportation hub. With the rapid increase of industrialization 
in the country in the late 19th century, Ohio's population swelled from 
2.3 million in 1860 to 4.2 million by 1900. By 1920, nine Ohio cities had 
populations of 50,000 or more.[27] The rapid urbanization brought about 
a growth of commercial industries in the state, including many financial 
and insurance institutions. The National City Corporation was founded in 
1845, today part of PNC Financial Services. Cleveland's Society for Savings 
was founded in 1849, eventually becoming part of KeyBank. The Bank of the 
Ohio Valley opened in 1858, becoming known as Fifth Third Bank today. City 
National Bank and Trust Company was founded in 1866 in Columbus, eventually 
becoming Bank One. The American Financial Group was founded in 1872 and 
the Western & Southern Financial Group in 1888 in Cincinnati. The Farm 
Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company was founded in Columbus in 1925, 
today known as the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. Major retail operations 
emerged in the state, including Kroger in 1883 in Cincinnati, today second 
only to WalMart. Federated Department Stores was founded in Columbus in 
1929, known today as Macy's. The Sherwin-Williams Company was founded in 
1866 in Cleveland. Frisch's Big Boy was opened in 1905 in Cincinnati. American 
Electric Power was founded in Columbus in 1906. The American Professional 
Football Association was founded in Canton in 1922, eventually becoming 
the National Football League. The Cleveland Clinic was founded in 1921 
and presently is one of the world's leading medical institutions. Edu. 
has been an integral piece of the Ohio fabric since its early days of statehood. 
In the beginning, mothers usually educated their children at home or paid 
for their children to attend smaller schools in villages and towns.[32] 
In 1821 the state passed a tax to finance local schools.[33] In 1822, Caleb 
Atwater lobbied the legislature and Governor Allen Trimble to establish 
a commission to study the possibility of initiating public, common schools. 
Atwater modeled his plan after the New York City public school system. 
After public opinion in 1824 forced the state to find a resolution to the 
education problem, the legislature established the common school system 
in 1825 and financed it with a half-mil property levy.[32] School districts 
formed, and by 1838 the first direct tax was levied allowing access to 
the school for all.[33] The first appropriation for the common schools 
came in 1838, a sum of $200,000. The average salary for male teachers in 
some districts during this early period was $25/month and $12.50/month 
for females.[34] By 1915, the appropriations for the common schools totaled 
over $28 million.[33] The first middle school in the nation, Indianola 
Junior High School (now the Graham Expeditionary Middle School), opened 
in Columbus in 1909. McGuffey Readers was a leading textbook originating 
from the state and found throughout the nation. Original universities and 
colleges in the state included the Ohio University, founded in Athens in 
1804 and the first university in the old Northwest Territory and ninth-oldest 
in the United States. Miami University in Oxford, Ohio was founded in 1809, 
the University of Cincinnati in 1819, Kenyon College in Gambier in 1824, 
Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1826, Xavier University in Cincinnati 
and Denison University in Granville in 1831, Oberlin College in 1833, Marietta 
College in 1835, the Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware in 1842, and 
Dayton University in 1850. Wilberforce University was founded in 1856 and 
the University of Akron and Ohio State University followed in 1870, with 
the University of Toledo in 1872. The first dental school in the United 
States was founded in the early 19th century in Bainbridge. The Ohio School 
for the Blind became the first of its kind in the country, located in Columbus. 
In 2007, Governor Ted Strickland signed legislation organizing the University 
System of Ohio, the nation's largest comprehensive public system of higher 
education. Rural Ohio in the 19th century was noted for its religious diversity, 
tolerance and pluralism, according to Smith (1991). With so many active 
denominations, no one dominated, and increasingly tolerance became the 
norm. Germans from Pennsylvania and from Germany brought Lutheran and Reformed 
churches and numerous smaller sects such as the Amish. Yankees brought 
Presbyterians and Congregationalists. Revivals during the Second Great 
Awakening spurred the growth of Methodist, Baptist and Christian (Church 
of Christ) churches. The building of many denominational liberal arts colleges 
was a distinctive feature of the 19th century. By the 1840s German and 
Irish Catholics were moving into the cities, and after the 1880s Catholics 
from eastern and southern Europe arrived in the larger cities, mining camps, 
and small industrial centers. Jews and Eastern Orthodox settlements added 
to the pluralism, as did the building of black Baptists and Methodist churches 
in the cities.[35] During the Progressive Era, Washington Gladden was a 
leader of the Social Gospel movement in Ohio. He was the editor of the 
influential national magazine the Independent after 1871, and as pastor 
of the First Congregational Church of Columbus, Ohio from 1882 to his death 
in 1918. Gladden crusaded for Prohibition, resolving conflicts between 
labor and capital; he often denounced racial violence and lynching.[36] 
Early Ohio state culture was a product of Native American cultures, which 
practically disappeared after 1790. The northeastern part of Ohio was settled 
by Yankees from Connecticut, and pioneers from New York and Pennsylvania. 
The Connecticut Western Reserve became center for modernization and reform.[37] 
They were sophisticated, educated, and open minded, as well as religious.[37] 
Some of the original settlers from Connecticut were Amos Loveland, a revolutionary 
soldier, and Jacob Russell.[37] They faced a rough wildnerness life, where 
the common living arrangement was the log cabin.[37] As the pioneer culture 
faded in the mid-19th century, Ohio had over 140,000 citizens of native 
New England origin, including New York.[38] One of the New Yorkers who 
came to the state during this period was Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter 
Day Saint movement, whose church in Kirtland was the home of the movement 
for a period of time. Other early pioneers came from the Mid-Atlantic states, 
especially Pennsylvania and Virginia, some settling on military grant lands 
in the Virginia Military District. From Virginia came members of the Harrison 
family of Virginia, who rose to prominence in the state, producing Ohio's 
first of eight U.S. Presidents. William Henry Harrison's campaign of 1840 
came to represent the pioneer culture of Ohio, symbolized by his Log cabin 
campaign. The theme song of his campaign, the "Log Cabin Song,"[39] was 
authored by Otway Curry, was a nationally known poet and author.[40] Ohio 
was largely agricultural before 1850, although gristmills and local forges 
were present. Clear-cut gender norms prevailed among the farm families 
who settled in the Midwestern region between 1800 and 1840. Men were the 
breadwinners who considered the profitability of farming in a particular 
location - or "market-minded agrarianism" - and worked hard to provide 
for their families. They had an almost exclusive voice regarding public 
matters, such as voting and handling the money. During the migration westward, 
women's diaries show little interest in and financial problems, but great 
concern with the threat of separation from family and friends. Furthermore, 
women experienced a physical toll because they were expected to have babies, 
supervise the domestic chores, care for the sick, and take control of the 
garden crops and poultry. Outside the German American community, women 
rarely did fieldwork on the farm. The women set up neighborhood social 
organizations, often revolving around church membership, or quilting parties. 
They exchanged information and tips on child-rearing, and helped each other 
in childbirth.[41] Large numbers of German Americans arrived from Pennsylvania, 
augmented by new immigrants from Germany. They all clung to their German 
language and Protestant religions, as well as their specialized tastes 
in food and beer. Brewing was a main feature of the German culture. Their 
villages from this period included the German Village in Columbus. They 
also founded the villages of Gnadenhutten in the late 18th century; Bergholz, 
New Bremen, New Berlin, Dresden, and other villages and towns. The German 
Americans immigrating from the Mid-Atlantic states, especially eastern 
Pennsylvania, brought with them the Midland dialect, which is still found 
throughout much of Ohio.[42][43] For instance, in Philadelphia water is 
pronounced with a long o versus the normal short o, the same as in many 
areas of Ohio. African Americans of the Underground Railroad began coming 
to the state, some settling, others passing through on the way to Canada. 
Universities and colleges opened up all over the state, creating a more 
educated culture. By the last half of the 19th century, the state became 
more diverse culturally with new immigrants from Europe, including Ireland 
and Germany. The Forty-Eighters from Central Europe settled the Over-the-Rhine 
neighborhood in Cincinnati, while the Irish immigrants settled throughout 
the state, including Flytown in Columbus. Other immigrants from Russia, 
Turkey, China, Japan, Finland, Greece, Italy, Romania, Poland, and other 
places came in the latter years.[44] Around the start of the 20th century, 
rural southern European Americans and African Americans came north in search 
of better economic opportunity, infusing Hillbilly culture into the state. 
Newer ethnic villages emerged, including the Slavic Village in Cleveland 
and the Italian Village and Hungarian Village in Columbus. Howard Chandler 
Christy, born in Morgan County, became a leading American artist during 
this century, as well as composer Dan Emmett, founder of the Blackface 
tradition. Ohio's mines factories and cities attracted Europeans. Irish 
Catholics poured in to construct the canals, railroads, streets and sewers 
in the 1840s and 1850s,.[45] After 1880, the coal mines and steel plants 
attracted families from southern and eastern Europe. By 1901, the Midwest 
(Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio) had absorbed 5.8 million 
foreign immigrants and another million by 1912.[46] Immigration was cut 
off by the World War in 1914, allowing the ethnic communities to Americanize, 
grow much more prosperous, served in the military, and abandon possible 
plans to return to the old country.[47] Flows were very low between 1925 
and 1965, then began to increase again, this time with many arrivals from 
Asia and Mexico. Industrialization brought a shift culturally as urbanization 
and an emerging middle class changed society. Athletics became increasingly 
popular as the first professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Reds, started 
playing at that level in 1869, and football leagues emerged. Bathhouses 
and rollercoasters became a popular past time with the opening of Cedar 
Point in 1870. Theaters and saloons sprang up,[48] and more restaurants 
opened. Entertainment venues opening in Cleveland included the Playhouse 
Square Center, Palace Theatre, Ohio Theatre, State Theatre, and the Karamu 
House. Langston Hughes grew up in Cleveland and developed many of his plays 
at the Karamu House. In Columbus they opened the Southern Theatre in 1894, 
as well as their own Palace Theatre and Ohio Theatre, which hosted performers 
such as Jack Benny, Judy Garland, and Jean Harlow. The Lincoln Theatre 
hosted performers like Count Basie. The Taft Theatre opened in 1928 in 
Cincinnati. The Roaring Twenties brought prohibition, bootlegging and speakeasies 
to the state, as well as the swing dance culture.[49] Cincinnati became 
the headquarters of the "king of bootlegging" George Remus, who made $40 
million by the end of 1922.[50] The Anti-Saloon League had been powerful 
and Ohio, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union was still headquartered 
there; the Ku Klux Klan was active in the 1920s. However these organizations 
steadily lost influence after 1925. During the 1930s, the Great Depression 
struck the state hard. The Superman character was developed by Cleveland 
residents Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in the spirit of the Jewish Golem 
during the rise of the Third Reich. Many of the comics portrayed Superman 
fighting and defeating the Nazis.[51][52] Artists and writers emerged from 
the state, usually on the way to Hollywood, including "king of the cowboys" 
Roy Rogers, Roy Lichtenstein, Zane Grey, Milton Caniff, Art Tatum, and 
George Bellows. Alan Freed, who emerged from the swing dance culture in 
Cleveland, hosted the first live rock 'n roll concert in Cleveland in 1952, 
and the state produced some of the original popular musicians, including 
Dean Martin, Doris Day, The O.Jay's and The Isley Brothers. Ohioans loved 
the movies, and five Academy Award winning films were partly produced in 
the state, including Terms of Endearment, Traffic, The Deer Hunter, Rain 
Man, and Silence of the Lambs. During the Civil War (1861-65) Ohio played 
a key role in providing troops, military officers, and supplies to the 
Union army. Due to its central location and itd burgeoning population, 
Ohio was both politically and logistically important to the war effort. 
Despite the state's boasting a number of very powerful Republican politicians, 
it was divided politically. Portions of Southern Ohio followed the Peace 
Democrats under Clement Vallandigham and openly opposed President Lincoln's 
policies. Ohio played an important part in the Underground Railroad prior 
to the war, and remained a haven for escaped and runaway slaves during 
the war years.[53] The third most populous state in the Union at the time, 
Ohio raised nearly 320,000 soldiers for the Union army, third behind only 
New York and Pennsylvania. Nearly 7,000 Buckeye soldiers were killed in 
action.[54] Several leading generals were from the state, including Ulysses 
S. Grant, William T. Sherman, and Philip H. Sheridan. Only two minor battles 
were fought within its borders. Morgan's Raid in the summer of 1863 alarmed 
the populace.[55] Ohio troops fought in nearly every major campaign during 
the war. Its most significant Civil War site is Johnson's Island, located 
in Sandusky Bay of Lake Erie. Barracks and outbuildings were constructed 
for a prisoner of war depot, intended chiefly for officers. Over three 
years more than 15,000 Confederate men were held there. The island includes 
a Confederate cemetery where about 300 men were buried.[56] Camp Chase 
Prison was a Union Army prison in Columbus. There was a plot among prisoners 
to revolt and escape in 1863. The prisoners expected support from Copperheads 
and Vallandigham, but never did revolt.[57] Ohio has been involved in regional, 
national, and global wars since statehood, and veterans have been a powerful 
social and political force at the local and state levels. The organization 
of Civil War veterans, the Grand Army of the Republic, was a major player 
in local society and Republican politics in the last third of the 19th 
century. The American Veterans of Foreign Service was established in 1899 
in Columbus, ultimately becoming known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars 
in 1913. The state has produced 319 Medal of Honor recipients,[58] including 
the country's first recipient, Jacob Parrott. In 1886, the state authorized 
the creation of the Ohio Veterans Home in Sandusky and a second one created 
in 2003 in Georgetown to provide for soldiers facing economic hardship. 
Over 50,000 veterans have lived at the Sandusky location as of 2005.[59] 
Since World War I, the state has paid stipends to veterans of wars, including 
recently[when?] authorizing funds for soldiers of the Gulf and Afghanistan 
wars.[60] The state also provides free in-state tuition to any veteran 
regardless of state origin at their colleges.[61] In 1820, the legislature 
then passed legislation which nullified the federal court order as well 
as the operations of the Bank of the United States within their borders.[62] 
The state ignored further federal court orders, writs, and denied immunities 
to the federal government.[63] Their actions were considered the complete 
destruction of federal standing in the state and an attempted overthrow 
of the federal government.[64] Ohio forcefully applied their iron law against 
the federal government until 1824, when the United States Supreme Court 
ruled they had no authority to tax the federal bank in the landmark case 
originating from the state--Osborn v. Bank of the United States. They then 
followed by passing an act in 1831 to withdraw state protections for the 
Bank of the United States.[65] Although the nullification of 1820 in Ohio 
was inspired by resolutions passed in Virginia and Kentucky in 1798 and 
1800, the language of their resolution from 1820 would find its place in 
South Carolina's nullification of 1832 and secession articles of southern 
states in 1861.[65][66] The rebellion of 1820 firmly rooted the tradition 
of sovereignty in the state. In 1859, Governor Salmon P. Chase reaffirmed 
that tradition, stating: "We have rights which the Federal Government must 
not invade — rights superior to its power, on which our sovereignty depends; 
and we mean to assert those rights against all tyrannical assumptions of 
authority."[67] Following the War of the Rebellion, the debate over ratification 
of the Reconstruction Amendments reignited the sovereignty movement in 
Ohio. General Durbin Ward stated: "Fellow citizens of Ohio, I boldly assert 
that the States of this Union have always had, both before and since the 
adoption of the Constitution of the United States, entire sovereignty over 
the whole subject of suffrage in all its relations and bearings. Ohio has 
that sovereignty now, and it cannot be taken from her..."[68] As recent 
as 2009, the tradition re-emerged, with an Ohio sovereignty resolution[69] 
passing in the state senate,[70] and signatures being collected to place 
a State Sovereignty amendment on the ballot in 2011.[71] Ohio's roots as 
an anti-slavery and abolitionist state go back to its territorial days 
in the Northwest Territory, which forbade the practice. When it became 
a state, the constitution expressly outlawed slavery.[72] Many Ohioans 
were members of anti-slavery organizations, including the American Anti-Slavery 
Society and American Colonization Society.[73] Ohioan Charles Osborn published 
the first abolitionist newspaper in the country, "The Philanthropist," 
and in 1821, the father of abolition Benjamin Lundy began publishing his 
newspaper the Genius of Universal Emancipation.[73] Ohio was a key stop 
on the Underground Railroad where prominent abolitionists played a role, 
including John Rankin. Ohio resident Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the famous 
book "Uncle Tom's Cabin," which was largely influential in shaping the 
opinion of the north against slavery. As a closely contested state, Ohio 
was the top choice of Republicans, and often also as Democrats, for place 
on the national ticket as candidate for president or vice president. Between 
Lincoln and Hoover, every Republican president who did not gain the office 
by the death of his predecessor was born in Ohio; Ulysses Grant, although 
born in Ohio, was legally a residence of Illinois when he was elected.[74] 
By electing so many of her sons to the presidency, Ohio gained a role in 
politics disproportionate to its size. Several reasons came together. Ohio 
was a microcosm of the United States, balanced closely between the parties, 
and at the crossroads of America: between the South, the Northeast, and 
the developing West, and influenced by each. Its ethnic, religious, and 
cultural elements were a microcosm of the North. Its cutthroat politics 
trained candidates in how to win. A leading Ohio politician was "Available"—that 
is, well-suited and electable. Thus, in most presidential years, the governor 
of Ohio was deemed more available than the governor of the larger states 
of New York or Pennsylvania.[75] This legend built on itself As the state 
set seven men to the White House and four more became Vice President. Many 
others won major patronage plums. Between 1868 and 1924, not only did Ohio 
supply the most presidents, it supplied the most Cabinet members, and the 
most federal officeholders. Ohio-born Rutherford B. Hayes (1876), James 
A. Garfield (1880) and Benjamin Harrison (1888) were each nominated from 
a convention that had deadlocked, and where the delegates chose to turn 
to a candidate who could carry Ohio. In each case they did, and won the 
presidency. According to historian Andrew Sinclair, "the potency of the 
Ohio myth gave its favorite sons a huge advantage in a deadlocked convention".[76] 
The Progressive Era brought about change in the state, although the state 
had been at the forefront of the movement decades before. In 1852, Ohio 
passed its first child labor laws, and in 1885 adopted prosecution powers 
for violations.[77] In 1886, the American Federation of Labor was formed 
in Columbus, culminating in the passage of workers' compensation laws by 
the early 20th century.[78] Victoria Woodhull, the first female candidate 
for U.S. President in 1872, and U.S. Second Lady Cornelia Cole Fairbanks, 
credited with paving the way for the modern American female politician, 
were leaders in the women's suffrage movement. Ohio was the second state 
to hold a women's rights convention, the Ohio Women's Convention at Salem 
in 1850.[79] The public voted on women's suffrage in 1912, which failed, 
but the state ultimately adopted the 19th amendment in 1920. Ohio-native 
and U.S. President William Howard Taft signed the White-Slave Traffic Act 
in 1910, which sought to end human trafficking and the sex slave trade. 
The Anti-Saloon League was founded in 1893 in Oberlin, which saw political 
success with the passage of the Volstead Act in 1918. In 1912 a Constitutional 
Convention was held with Charles Burleigh Galbreath as Secretary. The result 
reflected the concerns of the Progressive Era. The constitution introduced 
the initiative and the referendum, and provided for the General Assembly 
to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional 
amendments originating in the Legislature. Under the Jeffersonian principle 
that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided 
for a recurring question to appear every 20 years on Ohio's general election 
ballots. The question asks whether a new constitutional convention is required. 
Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, the people 
have not found the need for a convention. Instead, constitutional amendments 
have been proposed by petition and the legislature hundreds of times and 
adopted in a majority of cases. In the early 1920s the Ku Klux Klan attracted 
thousands of Protestant men into membership, warning of the need to purify 
America, especially against the influence of Catholics, bootleggers, and 
corrupt politicians. The Klan collapsed and virtually disappeared in Ohio 
after 1925.[80] Ohio was hit especially hard by the Great Depression in 
the 1930s. In 1932, unemployment for the state reached 37.3%. By 1933, 
40% of factory workers and 67% of construction labor were unemployed.[81] 
The state had previously supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, 1936, 
1940, but his policies had grown out of favor with the state and they voted 
against him in 1944. Ohio played a major role in World War II, especially 
in providing manpower, food, and munitions to the Allied cause. Ohio manufactured 
8.4 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World 
War II, ranking fourth among the 48 states.[82] Ohio became heavily anti-Communist 
during the Cold War following World War II. Time Magazine reported in 1950 
that police officers in Columbus were warning youth clubs to be suspicious 
of communist agitators.[83] Campbell Hill in Bellefontaine became the site 
of a main U.S. Cold War base and a precursor to NORAD. Anti-communist personalities 
emerged from the state, including Janet Greene of Columbus, the political 
right's answer to Joan Baez. Her songs included "Commie Lies," "Poor Left 
Winger," and "Comrade's Lament."[84] Ohio was the scene of the Kent State 
Massacre, which saw anti-Vietnam war protesters shot dead by the Ohio National 
Guard. As the cold war wrapped up, Ohio heavily supported the elections 
of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his peace-work contributions toward 
ending the conflict, who is the name-bearer of a highway in the Cincinnati-area. 
The Ohio Un-American Activities Committee was a government agency which 
existed to collect information on citizens with communist sympathies,[85] 
resulting in 15 convictions, 40 indictments, and 1,300 suspects. Governor 
Frank Lausche generally opposed the committee, but his vetoes were overridden 
by the legislature.[86] The state forced their employees to sign a loyalty 
oath to defend the state against foreign and domestic enemies to receive 
a paycheck, including left-wing professors and Holocaust survivors Bernhard 
Blume and Oskar Seidlin.[87] Ohio also barred communists from receiving 
unemployment benefits.[88] Today the Ohio remains a global center reflective 
of its past. Modern state, national, and global businesses and industries 
are found throughout, and immigrants continue to flock to Ohio from all 
over the world. In 2008 an estimated 436,640 foreign born residents resided 
within their borders,[89] contributing to the world's 23rd largest economy 
that year.[90] It is the nation's 7th largest state by population,[91] 
and had become nicknamed the "fuel cell corridor"[92] in being a contributing 
anchor for the region now called the "Green Belt," in reference to the 
growing renewable energy sector.[93] Although the state experienced heavy 
manufacturing losses around the start of the 20th century and suffered 
from the Great Recession, it was rebounding by the second decade in being 
the country's 6th-fastest-growing economy through the first half of 2010.[94] 
Politically the state has demonstrated its importance in modern presidential 
elections, signed international cooperation treaties with foreign provinces 
and northern American states, has become involved in heated national disputes 
with southern American states, while producing national leadership. Its 
athletic teams are among some of the nation's best, and culturally the 
state continues to produce notable artists while building institutions 
enshrining its past. Educationally the schools are among the nation's top 
performers, and militarily Ohio's legacy continues into the present era. 
Ohio's transition into the 21st century is symbolized by the Third Frontier 
program, spearheaded by Governor Bob Taft around the start of the 20th 
century, which built on the agricultural and industrial pillars of the 
economy, the first and second frontiers, by aiding the growth of advanced 
technology industries, the third frontier.[95] It has been widely hailed 
as one of the nation's most successful government bureaucracies,[96] attracting 
637 new high-tech companies to the state and 55,000 new jobs with an average 
of salary of $65,000,[97] while having a $6.6 billion economic impact with 
an investment return ratio of 9:1.[97] In 2010 it won the International 
Economic Development Council's Excellence in Economic Development Award, 
celebrated as a national model of success.[98] The state's cities have 
become hubs of modern industry, including Toledo being recognized as a 
national solar center,[99][100] Cleveland a regenerative medicine research 
hub,[101] Dayton an aerospace and defense hub, Akron the rubber capital 
of the world, Columbus a technological research and development hub,[101] 
and Cincinnati a mercantile hub.[101] Ohio was hit hard by the Great Recession 
and manufacturing employment losses during the most recent period. The 
recession cost the state 376,500 jobs[102] and it had 89,053 foreclosures 
in 2009, a record for the state.[103] The median household income dropped 
7% and the poverty rate ballooned to 13.5% by 2009.[104] By the second 
half of 2010, the state showed signs of rebound in being the nation's 6th-fastest-growing 
economy.[94] During the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, the state 
was at the center of the international political world in being a key battleground 
which played a crucial role in the elections of U.S. President George W. 
Bush. U.S. House Minority Leader John Boehner of southwestern Ohio has 
emerged as a national political leader. Beginning in the 1980s, the state 
entered into international economic and resource cooperation treaties and 
organisations with other Midwestern states, New York, Pennsylvania, Ontario, 
and Quebec, including the Great Lakes Charter, Great Lakes Compact, and 
the Council of Great Lakes Governors. It became involved in heated national 
disputes with southern American states in 2009 and 2010, including Georgia 
over National Cash Register Company and Alabama over Wright Patterson Air 
Force Base, where southern lawmakers were accused of misusing federal funds 
and influence to "steal" Ohio jobs during the Great Recession.[105][106] 
Athletically, the state's teams are among some of the nation's best. The 
Ohio State University football team won the national championship in 2002 
and 2014, and consistently competes for the prize annually. The Cincinnati 
Reds won the World Series championship in 1990 following their run as the 
Big Red Machine in the 1970s, as well as the National League Central Division 
champions in 2010 and 2012, while the Cincinnati Bengals appeared in the 
Super Bowl in 1981 and 1988 and have won the AFC North Division in 2005, 
2009, 2013, and 2015. In 2016 the Cleveland Cavaliers won the NBA Finals, 
in 2007 won the Eastern Conference Championship, and in 2009 and 2010 won 
the NBA Central Division championships. The Columbus Quest won the only 
two league championships in history in the 1990s, while the Ohio State 
University men's basketball team advanced to the NCAA Final Four and national 
championship game in 2007. In 1995 the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame museum 
opened in Cleveland, commemorating Ohio's contributory past to the art, 
including being the location of the first live rock 'n roll concert in 
1952. The state is tied with Oklahoma and California for producing the 
most Miss America pageant winners through 2010 with six. Ohio has 5 of 
the top 115 colleges in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report's 
2010 rankings,[107] and was ranked #8 by the same magazine in 2008 for 
best high schools.[108] Overall, in 2010 the state's schools were ranked 
#5 in the country by Education Week.[109] Militarily Ohio's legacy continues 
into the modern era, contributing over 200,000 soldiers to the Gulf, Afghanistan,
