Alan Bannister (born September 3, 1951)[1] is a retired professional baseball 
player who played for the Philadelphia Phillies (1974–75), Chicago White 
Sox (1976–80), Cleveland Indians (1980–83), Houston Astros (1984) and Texas 
Rangers (1984–85). He was a utility player during his major league career. 
Bannister represented the United States at the 1971 Pan American Games, 
where he won a silver medal.[2] Highly touted in college, Bannister was 
the Phillies' first-round pick in the 1973 draft. Although versatile (he

recorded 3,007 at bats, 430 runs, 811 hits, 143 doubles, 28 triples, 19

.334 on-base percentage and a .355 slugging percentage. After his playing 
career he managed two years in the Montreal Expos minor league system and 
three years for the AZL Giants of the Arizona League. He was inducted to 
the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010.[4] In July 1972, as an amateur,
