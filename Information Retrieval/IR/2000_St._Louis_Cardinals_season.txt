The St. Louis Cardinals 2000 season was the team's 119th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 109th season in the National League. The Cardinals 
went 95-67 during the season, their best finish since 1987, and won the 
National League Central division by ten games over the Cincinnati Reds. 
In the playoffs the Cardinals defeated the Atlanta Braves 3 games to 0 
in the NLDS but lost to the New York Mets 4 games to 1 in the NLCS. The 
Cardinals sweep of the Braves in the NLDS was notable because it made the 
Mets run to their first World Series appearance since their championship 
season of 1986 much easier.[1][2] The Braves had eliminated the Mets from 
the playoffs on the final day of the 1998 season and in the 1999 NLCS.[2] 
Catcher Mike Matheny and outfielder Jim Edmonds won Gold Gloves this year. 
Matheny was acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays during the off-season, 
while Edmonds was acquired from the Anaheim Angels less than a week before 
the start of the season. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
