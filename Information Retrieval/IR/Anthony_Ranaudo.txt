He attended Louisiana State University (LSU) and played college baseball 
for the LSU Tigers. He made his MLB debut with the Boston Red Sox in 2014. 
He is a Guinea ball player Ranaudo was one of four children born to Angelo 
and Sharon Ranaudo and Brother Rocky.[1] He attended St. Aloysius School 
in Jackson Township, New Jersey and St. Rose High School in Belmar, New 
Jersey. During his time at St. Rose, he also played basketball and was 
president of the student council. Amassing numerous awards as a standout 
pitcher, Anthony was selected by the Texas Rangers in the 2007 MLB draft 
upon graduation, but did not sign a contract. He was a New York Yankees 
fan growing up.[2] Ranaudo attended Louisiana State University (LSU). He 
pitched for the LSU Tigers baseball team from 2008 through 2010. Entering 
his junior season in 2010, Anthony was seen by many as one of the top pitchers 
coming into the draft.[3] However, Anthony missed five weeks of the season 
due to an elbow injury.[4] He had a standout year in 2009, third in NCAA 
strikeouts and was a critical player in the Tigers' College World Series 
victory.[5] However, upon returning from the elbow injury in 2010, neither 
his numbers nor performance were the same as the previous year.[5] Ranaudo 
also pitched twice in the Cape Cod Baseball League. After his freshman 
year he pitched for the Y-D Red Sox and then for the Brewster Whitecaps 
following his junior year. Anthony dominated during his tenure with the 
Whitecaps, pitching to a 3-0 record, without giving up a run in 29.2 innings 
of 31/8 K/BB pitching.[6] Ranaudo was selected 39th overall in the supplemental 
First Round of the 2010 MLB Draft. He signed with the Red Sox for a $2.55 
million signing bonus just shortly before the signing deadline on August 
16, 2010.[7] Ranaudo was assigned first to the Red Sox minor league affiliate 
Lowell Spinners where he did not pitch in 2010.[2] In 2011, Ranaudo made 
his professional debut with the Greenville Drive of the South Atlantic 
League. In 10 starts for the Drive, he posted a 4-1 record with a 3.33 
earned run average and a 1.10 WHIP over 46 innings pitched. He was then 
promoted to the A+ Salem Red Sox of the Carolina League, where he went 
5-5 with a 4.33 ERA in 16 starts, including 67 strikeouts and a 1.35 WHIP 
in 81 innings. He finished the season with a combined 9-6 record and a 
3.97 ERA in 26 starts, 117 strikeouts, a 1.27 WHIP and 127 innings pitched.[8] 
Ranaudo was promoted to the AA Portland Sea Dogs of the Eastern League 
for the 2012 season. Previously, he was ranked as the top pitching prospect 
in the Red Sox organization and the 5th overall minor league prospect in 
Major League Baseball by MiLB.com.[9] Ranaudo was injured for much of April 
and May and did not earn his first win with the Sea Dogs until June. His 
season ended early due to injuries, going 1-3 with a 6.69 ERA over nine 
starts in just 37⅔ innings of work.[8] Ranaudo returned to the Portland 
Sea Dogs in 2013, earning bids in the All-Star Futures Game and the Eastern 
League All-Star Game along the way. At the end of July, he was leading 
the league in both WHIP (1.09) and batting average against (.204), while 
posting an 8-4 record and a 2.95 ERA in 19 starts, which included an 8.7 
K/9 rate. He then gained a promotion to Triple A Pawtucket Red Sox on August 
2.[10] Late in August, Ranaudo was selected to the Eastern League Year–End 
All-Star team and was named the circuit's Pitcher of the Year, as voted 
on by league managers and media members.[11] Ranaudo was added to the Red 
Sox 40-man roster on November 20, 2013.[12] Ranaudo began the 2014 season 
in the Pawtucket Red Sox rotation. He was selected to the 2014 International 
League All-Star Team but did not play due to an injury.[13] Ranaudo was 
called up to the major leagues for the first time on August 1, 2014 and 
made his Major League Baseball debut that day in a start against the New 
York Yankees. In that start he collected his first career strikeout, striking 
out, Derek Jeter, who coincidentally, was his boyhood sports hero.[14] 
He also won the game.[15] The next day, Ranaudo was optioned back to Pawtucket, 
but recalled August 12. On January 27, 2015, the Red Sox traded Ranaudo 
to the Texas Rangers in exchange for pitcher Robbie Ross Jr.[16] He was 
sent down to begin the season with Triple–A Round Rock Express on March 
28, 2015.[17] Ranaudo began the season with Triple–A Round Rock Express, 
and was recalled on May 6 by Texas Rangers, for whom he made his season 
debut on May 7 at Detroit, against the Tigers, entering the game in the 
third inning with the Rangers down 3-2. Ranaudo pitched 2 1/3 innings, 
giving up two runs on an Ian Kinsler home run in the fourth inning as Anthony 
Gose was on base via a walk. He would give up one other hit in that inning 
(a single to Miguel Cabrera). Ranaudo would appear in one more game (May 
10 against the Chicago White Sox) before being optioned back to Triple-A 
Round Rock on May 11. He was traded on May 12 to the Chicago White Sox 
for minor league right-handed pitcher Matt Ball. He was then optioned on 
May 13 to Triple-A Charlotte Knights. Ranaudo started in the majors again 
for the White Sox on July 27 against the Chicago Cubs in Wrigley Field 
and got his first MLB hit with a fifth inning home run. On July 28, he
