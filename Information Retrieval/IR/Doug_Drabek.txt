Douglas Dean Drabek (born July 25, 1962) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed pitcher. He is currently the pitching coach for the Double 
A Mobile Baybears. Known for his fluid pitching motion and sound mechanics, 
he won the National League Cy Young Award in 1990.[1] Drabek was born in 
Victoria, Texas.[2] He attended St. Joseph High School in Victoria, where 
he played football[3] and baseball. Drabek was drafted by the Cleveland 
Indians in the 4th round of the June 1980 MLB Draft, but did not sign. 
He then attended the University of Houston and played three seasons for 
the Cougars baseball team.[1] Following his Junior year, Drabek was drafted 
by the Chicago White Sox in the 11th round of the June 1983 MLB Draft and 
signed on June 11.[4] After signing with the White Sox, Drabek was assigned 
to the Niagara Falls Sox in the short-season New York-Penn League where 
he finished 6–7 with a 3.67 ERA in 16 games with 103 strikeouts in 103 
2/3 innings. After pitching one game for the Class A Appleton, Drabek was 
promoted to the AA Glens Falls White Sox and was 12–5 with a 2.24 ERA. 
On 13 August, he was traded to the New York Yankees along with Kevin Hickey 
to complete an earlier deal made on July 18 for Roy Smalley.[5] Drabek 
then spent the rest of the 1984 season at AA Nashville. In 1985, Drabek 
returned to AA and spent the entire season at Albany-Colonie in the Eastern 
League and finished with a 13–7 record with a 2.99 ERA with 153 strikeouts 
in 192 2/3 innings. After starting the 1986 season at AAA Columbus, Drabek 
made his Major League debut on May 30, coming in relief for starter Joe 
Niekro in a 6–3 loss to the Oakland Athletics.[6] He would spend the rest 
of the season with the Yankees, appearing in 27 games (21 starts) and go 
7–8 with a 4.10 ERA. Following the season, he was traded with Logan Easley 
and Brian Fisher to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Rick Rhoden, Cecilio Guante 
and Pat Clements. Drabek enjoyed his best years with Pittsburgh, from 1987 
to 1992, during which time he regularly pitched over 230 innings and consistently 
finished in the top 10 in the National League ERA race[citation needed]. 
He went 22–6 with a 2.76 ERA in 1990 en route to winning the National League 
Cy Young Award[7] and leading the Pirates to the postseason (where they 
lost in the NLCS to the Cincinnati Reds). His 22 wins that year were a 
league high; it was also 7 more wins than his previous single-season mark. 
Drabek signed as a free agent after the 1992 season with the Houston Astros. 
Despite a solid 3.79 ERA and playing for a rising team, he posted a 9–18 
record. He improved in the strike-shortened 1994 season to 12–6 with a 
2.84 ERA, and was named an All-Star for the first and only time in his 
career. When play resumed after the players' strike in 1995, however, he 
was unable to maintain his success and retired after the 1998 season, having 
compiled a 35–40 record over his final four seasons. On August 3, 1990, 
while with the Pirates, Drabek had a no-hitter broken up by a Sil Campusano 
single with two out in the ninth. The hit was the only one Drabek would 
allow in defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 11-0.[8] After retiring, Drabek 
coached his son's Little League and select league teams, often teaching 
them how to bat at a faster pitch, with their personal pitching machine 
so as to gain an advantage over the other little league teams.[9] Drabek 
returned to professional baseball in 2010, accepting a position in the 
Arizona Diamondbacks system as the pitching coach for the Yakima Bears 
in the short-season Class A Northwest League. On 13 December 2010 the D-backs 
announced that Drabek was promoted to the pitching coach for the Visalia 
Rawhide in the Class A California League.[10] Drabek is married to wife 
Kristy and has three children; sons Justin (born 1986) and Kyle (born 1987) 
and daughter Kelsey (born 1992). Justin spent time playing in independent 
ball.[9] Kyle is a starting pitcher and is currently in the Arizona Diamondbacks 
organization, after previously playing for the Chicago White Sox and Toronto
