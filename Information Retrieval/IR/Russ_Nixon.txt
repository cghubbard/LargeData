As player As manager Russell Eugene Nixon (February 19, 1935 – November 
9, 2016) was an American catcher, coach and manager in Major League Baseball. 
A veteran of 55 years in professional baseball, Nixon managed at virtually 
every level of the sport, from the lowest minor league to MLB assignments 
with the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves. He was born in Cleves, Ohio, 
near Cincinnati. Nixon graduated from Western Hills High School in Cincinnati, 
and also attended the University of Cincinnati. He batted left-handed and 
threw right-handed, and stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 190 
pounds (86 kg) in his playing days (1953–68). Nixon and his twin brother, 
Roy, an infielder, each signed with the Cleveland Indians in 1953. Although 
Roy never played Major League Baseball, retiring after five minor league 
seasons, Russ Nixon fashioned a 12-year MLB career with the Indians (1957–60), 
Boston Red Sox (1960–65; 1968) and Minnesota Twins (1966–67). In his best 
season, 1958, Nixon caught 101 games for Cleveland and batted .301. Overall, 
he appeared in 906 games over all or parts of 12 seasons, and batted .268. 
He holds the record for most games played without ever stealing a base. 
In addition, Nixon was actually traded twice to the Red Sox in 1960. Cleveland 
initially dealt him to Boston on March 16 for catcher Sammy White and first 
baseman Jim Marshall.[1] White chose to retire and the trade was cancelled 
but not before Nixon played five exhibition games for the Red Sox.[2] Nixon 
returned to the Indians and started the regular season with them, appearing 
in 25 games, 21 as the starting catcher; then, almost three months after 
the original swap, on June 13, he was traded to the Red Sox a second time, 
with outfielder Carroll Hardy for pitcher Ted Bowsfield and outfielder 
Marty Keough.[3] His managing career began in the Cincinnati Reds' farm 
system in 1970 and in 1976 he was promoted to a coaching position with 
the defending World Series champion Reds, under Baseball Hall of Fame manager 
Sparky Anderson. In Nixon's first season, Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine" 
dynasty reached its pinnacle with a second consecutive world championship, 
dispatching the New York Yankees in a four-game sweep in the 1976 World 
Series. However, the Reds' period in the sun began to dim with the advent 
of baseball free agency. Anderson was fired after the 1978 season, and 
Nixon remained on the Reds' staff under the new manager, John McNamara, 
in 1979. After compiling the best overall record in the National League 
West Division during the strike-affected split season of 1981, the Reds 
unexpectedly unraveled in 1982, plummeting into the basement. McNamara 
was fired July 21 and Nixon took his place. Nixon was unable to right the 
ship, as the Reds went 27-43 the rest of way en route to what is still 
the only 100-loss season in franchise history. When the Reds finished last 
again in 1983, Nixon was fired. He then coached for the Montreal Expos 
(1984–85) before signing as a coach with the Braves. Nixon worked for an 
old Cleveland teammate, Chuck Tanner, in 1986–87 before his appointment 
as pilot of the Greenville Braves, the club's AA Southern League affiliate, 
for 1988. While new general manager Bobby Cox had done much to rebuild 
the Braves' farm system, at the National League level Atlanta was in free 
fall. When the Braves dropped 27 of their first 39 games in 1988, Nixon 
was recalled from Greenville to succeed Tanner on May 23—a rare promotion 
of a manager from AA all the way to the majors. However, the losses continued 
to pile up. The 1988 Braves finished 54–106, the worst season in the Atlanta 
portion of Braves history and the franchise's worst since its struggles 
in Boston during the Great Depression. Nixon was unable to right the ship 
in 1989 and 1990, seasons in which the Braves lost 97 games each despite 
breaking in talented young pitchers such as Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and 
Steve Avery. On June 22, 1990, Cox fired Nixon. Although Nixon's final 
Major League managing record was a poor 231–347 (.400), he remained in 
the game as a minor-league manager and instructor, except for 1992, when 
he returned to the American League to spend one year as a coach for the 
Seattle Mariners. At age 70, he spent the 2005 season as manager of the 
Greeneville Astros, rookie-level Appalachian League affiliate of the Houston 
Astros, and spent 2006–07 as a roving instructor in the Houston farm system. 
In 2008, Nixon, then 73, was still active in baseball as a roving instructor 
in the Texas Rangers' farm system, appointed by the club president at the 
time, Nolan Ryan.[4] Russ Nixon died on November 9, 2016 in Las Vegas,
