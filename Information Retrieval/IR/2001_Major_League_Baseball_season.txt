The 2001 Major League Baseball season, the first of the 21st century, finished 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks defeating the New York Yankees in a Game 
7 of the 2001 World Series. The September 11 terrorist attacks on New York 
and Washington, D.C. pushed the end of the regular-season from September 
30 to October 7. Because of the tragedy, the World Series was not completed 
until November 4; therefore, it was called The November Series[citation 
needed]. The 2001 World Series was the only World Series to end in November, 
until the 2009 Series, which was scheduled to end on November 1 at the 
earliest and ended on November 4. This season was memorable for the Seattle 
Mariners equaling the Major League regular season record of 116 wins, Barry 
Bonds breaking Mark McGwire's single-season home run record, and baseball's 
patriotic return after a week's worth of games being postponed due to 9/11.
