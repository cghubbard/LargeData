All Nations was a barnstorming professional baseball team that toured the 
Midwest from 1912 to 1918, and again in 1920 [1] and 1921,[2] and from 
1923 to 1925. It derived its name from the fact that its team included 
players of several nationalities, including blacks and whites, Indians, 
Hawaiians, Japanese and Latin Americans. The team was founded by the Hopkins 
Brothers sporting goods stores. One day, however, the team's manager absconde 
with the daily gate proceeds. J. L. Wilkinson, who played for the team, 
replaced him as manager, later becoming owner as well. The team was based 
out of Kansas City[3] and Des Moines.[4] Under the management of Wilkinson, 
the All Nations' approach to the game was more serious than that of many 
teams who followed Abe Saperstein's farcical approach. They did however 
provide additional entertainment for their audiences, including having 
a dance band to play before the games and wrestlers like Ben Reeves to 
perform after their games.[4] Wilkinson transported the team from location 
to location in a $25,000 Pullman car, which also held portable bleachers 
which would be set up for the game. He did not pay for rooms for his players, 
however, instead having them sleep the night before the game in tents they 
brought with them on the field on which they would play. Under Wilkinson, 
the team became "strong enough to give any major league club a nip and 
tuck battle", according to Sporting Life. It went 3-1 against the Indianapolis 
ABC's in 1916 and splitting a series with the Chicago American Giants. 
The team encountered difficulties during World War I, when it found most 
of its better players were drafted, and was finally disbanded in 1918. 
Pitcher John Donaldson managed the All Nations from 1923 to 1924. The All 
Nations were still owned by J.L. Wilkinson and was used as a traveling 
team that trained inexperienced players and found talent in the Midwest.
