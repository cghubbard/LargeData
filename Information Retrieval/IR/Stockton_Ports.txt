league baseball team in Stockton, California. The Ports play in the North 
Division of the Class A – Advanced California League and are a minor league 
affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. Their home field is Banner Island Ballpark, 
which seats over 5,000 people and opened in 2005. The Ports' games are 
broadcast on KWSX (1280 AM). Baseball first came to Stockton in the 1860s. 
At the time Stockton fielded a team in an earlier incarnation of the California 
League. In 1888 the Stockton team won the California League pennant with 
a record of 41–12. That same team also gained a bit of notoriety as a possible 
inspiration of "Casey at the Bat", a famous baseball poem by Ernest Thayer. 
Thayer was a journalist for the San Francisco Examiner at the time and 
the games were hosted in a ballpark on Banner Island, a place once known 
as Mudville. The Stockton Flyers were established as a charter member of 
the California League in 1941. The league suspended operations in June 
1942 due to World War II. The Flyers were rechristened as the Stockton 
Ports to recognize Stockton's status as an inland port city when the league 
resumed operations in 1946. That season, the Ports went on to win their 
first California League pennant. In 1947, the Ports won the California 
League pennant again without a major league affiliation (they had a limited 
working agreement with the Pacific Coast League's Oakland Oaks). After 
going 24–18 playing through June 4, they went on a 26-game winning streak 
and took first place, never to relinquish again in that season. The win 
streak is one of the longest in professional baseball and is still a California 
League record. The Ports finished that season with a record of 95–45 and 
16 games ahead of the two teams tied for second place. Years later, baseball 
historians Bill Weiss and Marshall Wright rated the 1947 Ports as one of 
the 100 best minor league teams of all time, ranked at number 98.[1] Owned 
by Stockton local Carl W. Thompson, Sr. (1971–73), the Ports would disband 
after the 1972 season, coming back as an affiliate of the Seattle Mariners 
in 1978. The Ports won more games in the 1980s than any other team in minor-league 
baseball.[2] In an homage to the team in the Ernest Thayer poem, the Ports 
were renamed as the Mudville Nine in 2000 and 2001,[3][4] then returned 
to the Ports name in 2002. The Ports won their eleventh California League 
Championship in 2008 with a 9–3 victory over the Lancaster JetHawks on 
September 14, 2008. With 11 league titles, the Ports have the most among 
the league's active franchises, with the defunct Reno franchise also having 
won 11. In 2005 the Ports became an affiliate of the Oakland Athletics 
and began play at Banner Island Ballpark. Pitchers Catchers Infielders
