Brian Anthony Bruney (born February 17, 1982) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, New York Yankees, Washington Nationals and Chicago White 
Sox. He won the 2009 World Series with the Yankees, beating the Philadelphia 
Phillies. Bruney was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks after graduating 
from Warrenton High School in 2000. Bruney pitched in the minors from 2000 
to 2003, making his major league debut on May 8, 2004 against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. Bruney had a good rookie year with the Diamondbacks, posting 
a 4.31 ERA and striking out 34 batters in 31.1 innings. In 2005, the Diamondbacks 
tried Bruney as their closer, and he saved 12 games in 16 opportunities. 
Overall, the 2005 season turned out to be a poor showing for Bruney. He 
posted a 7.43 ERA in 46 innings. In May 2006, Bruney was designated for 
assignment by the Diamondbacks. He was later signed as a minor league free 
agent by the New York Yankees. Bruney pitched for the Triple-A Columbus 
Clippers. Bruney received a call-up to the big club. Armed with an upper-90's 
fastball, mid-80's curveball and an aggressive approach, Bruney took advantage 
of this second wind and quickly established himself as one of the better 
relief pitchers in the Yankees bullpen. Bruney finished 2006 with a 1-1 
record and a 0.87 ERA in 19 games (20.2 innings). In 2007, he spent time 
on both the Yankees' major league roster, and their Triple-A team. He ended 
the season with a 4.68 ERA in 58 major league games. Bruney reported to 
Spring Training 2008 having lost 20 pounds in the offseason, in addition 
to gaining speed on his fastball. On April 25, 2008, it was learned that 
Bruney would likely miss the remainder of the season due to a fracture 
in his foot (Lisfranc) but he chose to forgo foot surgery in order to rehab 
the injury. After spending time rehabbing in the minors, he returned to 
the Yankees on August 1 following the trade of Kyle Farnsworth. He was 
slated to be Mariano Rivera's primary setup man going into the 2009 season.[1] 
In 2009, Bruney spent part of the season on the disabled list, but managed 
to collect a 3.92 ERA and 1.51 WHIP in 39 innings pitched. On June 13, 
2009, Bruney criticized New York Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez, calling 
his antics on the mound "unbelievable" and saying that Rodriguez has "got 
a tired act." Rodríguez responded after the Mets won that day's game by 
saying "somebody like that, it doesn't bother me," and suggesting that 
Bruney "better keep his mouth shut and do his job, not worry about somebody 
else. I don't even know who the guy is. I'm not going to waste my time 
with that guy. Instead of sending messages through the paper, next time 
when you see me at Citi Field, come up to me and say it to my face."[2] 
During batting practice the following day at Yankee Stadium, Rodríguez 
confronted Bruney on the field, pointing and shouting at him before teammates 
from both sides could separate the two.[3] Bruney did not appear in the 
ALDS against the Twins or the ALCS against the Angels, but was added to 
the World Series roster.[4] On October 28, it was announced that Bruney 
would be replacing backup catcher Francisco Cervelli on the 25-man roster 
for the World Series.[5] On December 7, 2009, Bruney was traded to the 
Washington Nationals for Jamie Hoffman, Washington's pick in the 2009 Rule 
5 draft.[6] On May 25, 2010, the Nationals released him after being designated 
for assignment on May 17.[7] Bruney signed a minor league contract with 
the Milwaukee Brewers on June 1, 2010, but was released on June 21 after 
pitching in 3 1⁄3 innings with the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Bruney signed 
a minor league contract with the New York Mets on July 2, 2010. Bruney 
became a free agent after the 2010 season ended.[citation needed] In December 
2010, Bruney signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox.[8] 
He had his contract purchased on May 30, 2011.[9] He made his debut with 
the White Sox on May 31 against the Boston Red Sox, allowing 2 runs in 
2/3 of an inning. On August 5, the White Sox designated Bruney for assignment.[10] 
He was released on August 15.[11] On January 23, 2012, Bruney re-signed 
a minor league contract with the White Sox. He was called up from AAA Charlotte 
on June 22, 2012 after Philip Humber was placed on the DL. As a child, 
Bruney was an extra in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Kindergarten Cop.[12] 
Bruney married his wife Stacey on February 2, 2002.[13] The couple and
