Sports entertainment is a type of spectacle which presents an ostensibly 
competitive event using a high level of theatrical flourish and extravagant 
presentation, with the purpose of entertaining an audience. Unlike typical 
athletics and games, which are conducted for competition, sportsmanship, 
exercise or personal recreation, the primary product of sports entertainment 
is performance for an audience's benefit, thus they are never practiced 
privately. Commonly, but not in all cases, the outcomes are predetermined; 
as this is an open secret, it is not considered to be match fixing. World 
Wrestling Entertainment coined the term "sports entertainment" during the 
1980s as a description for their style of professional wrestling, although 
precursors date back to February 1935, when Toronto Star sports editor 
Lou Marsh described professional wrestling as "sportive entertainment". 
In 1989 WWF used the phrase in a case it made to the New Jersey Senate 
for classifying professional wrestling as "sports entertainment" and thus 
not subject to regulation like a directly competitive sport. Some sports 
entertainment events represent variants of actual sports, such as exhibition 
basketball with the Harlem Globetrotters association, or American football 
with the Legends Football League. Others modify sport for entertainment 
purposes: many types of professional wrestling (which derived from traditional 
wrestling), and more recently many of the various mascot races held at 
numerous Major League Baseball games in-between innings.[1] Some forms 
of sports entertainment involve taking competitive games usually considered 
minor, such as dodgeball, poker, or rock-paper-scissors, and televising 
them with trumped-up theatrics, involving (for example) celebrity competitors 
or elaborate audiovisual packages. Sports entertainment has a stigma of 
being mindless pop culture, in some cases glorifying violence for the sake 
of entertainment,[2] and has been criticized as such in popular media, 
often through lampooning. The film Idiocracy portrays a future where sports 
entertainment permeates the global culture: the president is an active 
champion professional wrestler and capital punishment consists of a combination 
demolition derby, monster truck event and gladiator duel, and is a highly 
popular television broadcast. Fiction with a dystopian future setting often 
portrays deadly futuristic games as popular sports entertainment, including 
the novel The Hunger Games, the movie The Running Man, video games such 
as Smash TV and the Twisted Metal series, and the role-playing game Shadowrun, 
which features Urban Brawl and Combat Biking. Many notable names in the 
United States openly admit enjoying certain forms of sports entertainment 
while many others have taken part in it or made paid contributions. Professional 
basketball player Shaquille O'Neal has a reputation as a long time pro 
wrestling fan and attends WWE events several times per year, and Floyd 
Mayweather, Jr. expressed interest in fulfilling a WWE career after he 
retires from professional boxing. Both worked feuds with Big Show, Mayweather's 
culminating in a featured match at WrestleMania XXIV. Former American football 
player Brian Urlacher, who admits to being a pro wrestling fan, made an 
attempt to leave football to wrestle for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling 
full-time until his team at the time, the Chicago Bears, forced him to 
stop. Mixed martial artists Brock Lesnar, Bobby Lashley and Dan Severn 
have been booked as pro wrestling world heavyweight champions; David Arquette 
was briefly WCW World Heavyweight Champion, as part of a cross-promotional 
movie deal. Chael Sonnen tried out at the WCW Power Plant before starting 
his fighting career. His over-the-top, rehearsed promos helped him to three 
UFC title shots, and he has expressed interest in both working for and 
buying WWE. The widespread popularity in the United States for the main 
form of sports entertainment, professional wrestling, has caused politicians 
to use it to reach voters, particularly young males. President Barack Obama, 
Hillary Clinton and John McCain recorded video messages for broadcast for 
the WWE to encourage the audience of WWE Raw to vote, and George W. Bush 
did a prerecorded video for the WWE's annual Tribute to the Troops show.
