Edwin "Ned" Martin III (August 9, 1923 – July 23, 2002) was an American 
sportscaster, known primarily as a play-by-play announcer for Major League 
Baseball's Boston Red Sox from 1961 to 1992. Martin called Red Sox games 
on both WHDH radio and WHDH-TV from 1961 to 1971, on WHDH radio only from 
1972 to 1975, on WMEX/WITS from 1976 to 1978, on WSBK-TV from 1979 to 1987, 
and on New England Sports Network cable from 1985 to 1992.[1] During that 
time, he called the entire career of Hall-of-Famer Carl Yastrzemski, and 
was behind the microphone for some of baseball's most memorable moments, 
including the final win of the Red Sox "Impossible Dream" season of 1967, 
Carlton Fisk's game-winning home run off the foul pole in Game 6 of the 
1975 World Series, Yastrzemski's 400th home run and 3000th base hit in 
1979, and Roger Clemens' first 20-strikeout game on April 29, 1986. He 
may hold the distinction of having seen more Red Sox games in person than 
any other person, having spent 31 entire seasons with the club's broadcast 
team, which meant he saw more than 5,000 Red Sox games. Ned Martin was 
inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2000. Martin was known 
for his erudition and literary references during broadcasts (quotations 
from Shakespeare were not uncommon) and for his signature exclamation, 
"Mercy!", for plays both good and bad. His broadcast partners over the 
years included Curt Gowdy, Art Gleeson, Mel Parnell, Ken Coleman, Johnny 
Pesky, John MacLean, Dave Martin (no relation), Jim Woods, Ken Harrelson, 
Bob Montgomery, and Jerry Remy.[1] Martin also was a football announcer, 
covering the American Football League's Boston Patriots in 1965, as well 
as collegiate games for Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth. Nationally, Martin 
helped broadcast the 1975 World Series on NBC television and radio, three 
American League Championship Series (1976–1978) on CBS Radio, and the 1976 
Sun Bowl on CBS Radio. Ned Martin attended a memorial service for Hall 
of Fame slugger Ted Williams at Boston's Fenway Park on July 22, 2002, 
and was returning to his home in Clarksville, Virginia the following day 
when he was stricken with a massive coronary on a shuttle bus at Raleigh-Durham
