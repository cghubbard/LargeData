Pennsylvania i/ˌpɛnsᵻlˈveɪnjə/ (Pennsylvania German: Pennsilfaani), officially 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northern and 
Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run 
through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, 
Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, 
Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York 
to the north, and New Jersey to the east. Pennsylvania is the 33rd largest, 
the 6th most populous, and the 9th most densely populated of the 50 United 
States. The state's five most populous cities are Philadelphia (1,560,297), 
Pittsburgh (305,801), Allentown (118,577), Erie (100,671), and Reading 
(89,893). The state capital is Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has 51 miles (82 km) 
of coastline along Lake Erie and 57 miles (92 km)[7] of shoreline along 
the Delaware Estuary. The state is one of the 13 original founding states 
of the United States; it came into being in 1681 as a result of a royal 
land grant to William Penn, the son of the state's namesake. Part of Pennsylvania 
(along the Delaware River), together with the present State of Delaware, 
had earlier been organized as the Colony of New Sweden. It was the second 
state to ratify the United States Constitution, on December 12, 1787. Independence 
Hall, where the United States Declaration of Independence and United States 
Constitution were drafted, is located in the state's largest city of Philadelphia. 
During the American Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg, was fought in 
the south central region of the state. Valley Forge near Philadelphia was 
General Washington's headquarters during the bitter winter of 1777–78. 
Pennsylvania is 170 miles (274 km) north to south and 283 miles (455 km) 
east to west.[8] Of a total 46,055 square miles (119,282 km2), 44,817 square 
miles (116,075 km2) are land, 490 square miles (1,269 km2) are inland waters, 
and 749 square miles (1,940 km2) are waters in Lake Erie.[9] It is the 
33rd largest state in the United States.[10] Pennsylvania has 51 miles 
(82 km)[11] of coastline along Lake Erie and 57 miles (92 km)[7] of shoreline 
along the Delaware Estuary. The boundaries of the state are the Mason–Dixon 
line (39° 43' N) to the south, the Twelve-Mile Circle on the Pennsylvania-Delaware 
border, the Delaware River to the east, 80° 31' W to the west and the 42° 
N to the north, with the exception of a short segment on the western end, 
where a triangle extends north to Lake Erie. Pennsylvania borders six other 
states: New York to the north; New Jersey to the east; Delaware to the 
southeast; Maryland to the south; West Virginia to the southwest, and Ohio 
to the west. Pennsylvania also shares a water border with the Canadian 
province of Ontario to the northwest across Lake Erie. Of the original 
Thirteen Colonies, Pennsylvania is the only state that does not border 
the Atlantic Ocean. Cities include Philadelphia, Reading, Lebanon and Lancaster 
in the southeast, Pittsburgh in the southwest, the tri-cities of Allentown, 
Bethlehem, and Easton in the central east (known as the Lehigh Valley), 
the tri-cities of Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton in the northeast, 
and Erie in the northwest. Williamsport serves as the commonwealth's north-central 
region, with York and the state capital Harrisburg on the Susquehanna River 
in the east-central region of the Commonwealth and Altoona and Johnstown 
in the west-central region. The state has 5 regions, namely the Allegheny 
Plateau, Ridge and Valley, Atlantic Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and the Erie 
Plain. Pennsylvania's diverse topography also produces a variety of climates, 
though the entire state experiences cold winters and humid summers. Straddling 
two major zones, the majority of the state, with the exception of the southeastern 
corner, has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification 
Dfa). The largest city, Philadelphia, has some characteristics of the humid 
subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) that covers much of Delaware and Maryland 
to the south. Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state, the 
winter climate becomes colder, the number of cloudy days increase, and 
snowfall amounts are greater. Western areas of the state, particularly 
locations near Lake Erie, can receive over 100 inches (250 cm) of snowfall 
annually, and the entire state receives plentiful precipitation throughout 
the year. The state may be subject to severe weather from spring through 
summer into fall. Tornadoes occur annually in the state, sometimes in large 
numbers, such as 30 recorded tornadoes in 2011.[12] Long before the Commonwealth 
was visited and later settled by Europeans, the area was home to subgroups 
of the Delaware (also known as Lenni Lenape), Susquehannock, Iroquois, 
Eriez, Shawnee, and still other American Indian Nations of uncertain designation. 
The Tuscarora Nation took up temporary residence in the central portion 
of Pennsylvania ca. 1715–55. [18] Both the Dutch and the English claimed 
both sides of the Delaware River as part of their colonial lands in America.[19][20][21] 
The Dutch were the first to take possession.[21] By June 3, 1631, the Dutch 
had begun settling the Delmarva Peninsula by establishing the Zwaanendael 
Colony on the site of present-day Lewes, Delaware.[22] In 1638, Sweden 
established the New Sweden Colony, in the region of Fort Christina, on 
the site of present-day Wilmington, Delaware. New Sweden claimed and, for 
the most part, controlled the lower Delaware River region (parts of present-day 
Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) but settled few colonists there.[23][24] 
On March 12, 1664, King Charles II of England gave James, Duke of York 
a grant that incorporated all lands included in the original Virginia Company 
of Plymouth Grant plus other lands. This grant was in conflict with the 
Dutch claim for New Netherland, which included parts of today's Pennsylvania.[25] 
On June 24, 1664, The Duke of York sold the portion of his large grant 
that included present-day New Jersey to John Berkeley and George Carteret 
for a proprietary colony. The land was not yet in British possession, but 
the sale boxed in the portion of New Netherland on the West side of the 
Delaware River. The British conquest of New Netherland began on August 
29, 1664, when New Amsterdam was coerced to surrender while facing cannons 
on British ships in New York Harbor.[26][27] This conquest continued, and 
was completed in October 1664, when the British captured Fort Casimir in 
what today is New Castle, Delaware. The Peace of Breda between England, 
France and the Netherlands confirmed the English conquest on July 21, 1667,[28][29] 
although there were temporary reversions. On September 12, 1672, as part 
of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch re-conquered New York Colony/New 
Amsterdam, the Dutch established three County Courts which went on to become 
original Counties in present-day Delaware and Pennsylvania. The one that 
later transferred to Pennsylvania was Upland.[30] This was partially reversed 
on February 9, 1674, when the Treaty of Westminster ended the Third Anglo-Dutch 
War, and reverted all political situations to the status quo ante bellum. 
The British retained the Dutch Counties with their Dutch names.[31] By 
June 11, 1674, New York reasserted control over the outlying colonies, 
including Upland, but the names started to be changed to British names 
by November 11, 1674.[32] Upland was partitioned on November 12, 1674, 
producing the general outline of the current border between Pennsylvania 
and Delaware.[33] On February 28, 1681, Charles II granted a land charter[34] 
to William Penn to repay a debt of £16,000[35] (around £2,100,000 in 2008, 
adjusting for retail inflation)[36] owed to William's father, Admiral William 
Penn. This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history.[37] 
The King named it Pennsylvania (literally "Penn's Woods") in honor of the 
Admiral. Penn, the son, who wanted it to be called New Wales, and then 
Sylvania (from the Latin silva: "forest, woods"), was embarrassed at the 
change, fearing that people would think he had named it after himself, 
but King Charles would not rename the grant.[38] Penn established a government 
with two innovations that were much copied in the New World: the county 
commission and freedom of religious conviction.[37] What had been Upland 
on what became the Pennsylvania side of the Pennsylvania-Delaware Border 
was renamed as Chester County when Pennsylvania instituted their colonial 
governments on March 4, 1681.[39][40] The Quaker leader William Penn had 
signed a peace treaty with Tammany, leader of the Delaware tribe, beginning 
a long period of friendly relations between the Quakers and the Indians.[41] 
Additional treaties between Quakers and other tribes followed. The treaty 
of William Penn was never violated.[42] Between 1730 and when it was shut 
down by Parliament with the Currency Act of 1764, the Pennsylvania Colony 
made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and 
silver. The paper money was called Colonial Scrip. The Colony issued "bills 
of credit", which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their 
legal tender status. Since they were issued by the government and not a 
banking institution, it was an interest-free proposition, largely defraying 
the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people. It 
also promoted general employment and prosperity, since the Government used 
discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency. Benjamin 
Franklin had a hand in creating this currency, of which he said its utility 
was never to be disputed, and it also met with the "cautious approval" 
of Adam Smith.[43] James Smith wrote that in 1763, "the Indians again commenced 
hostilities, and were busily engaged in killing and scalping the frontier 
inhabitants in various parts of Pennsylvania." Further, "This state was 
then a Quaker government, and at the first of this war the frontiers received 
no assistance from the state."[44] The ensuing hostilities became known 
as Pontiac's War. After the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, Delegate John Dickinson 
of Philadelphia wrote the Declaration of Rights and Grievances. The Congress 
was the first meeting of the Thirteen Colonies, called at the request of 
the Massachusetts Assembly, but only nine colonies sent delegates.[45] 
Dickinson then wrote Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, To the Inhabitants 
of the British Colonies, which were published in the Pennsylvania Chronicle 
between December 2, 1767, and February 15, 1768.[46] When the Founding 
Fathers of the United States convened in Philadelphia in 1774, 12 colonies 
sent representatives to the First Continental Congress.[47] The Second 
Continental Congress, which also met in Philadelphia (in May 1775), drew 
up and signed the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia,[48] but 
when that city was captured by the British, the Continental Congress escaped 
westward, meeting at the Lancaster courthouse on Saturday, September 27, 
1777, and then to York. There they and its primary author, John Dickinson, 
drew up the Articles of Confederation that formed 13 independent colonies 
into a new nation. Later, the Constitution was written, and Philadelphia 
was once again chosen to be cradle to the new American Nation.[49] The 
Constitution was drafted and signed at the Pennsylvania State House, now 
known as Independence Hall, and the same building where the Declaration 
of Independence was signed.[50] Pennsylvania became the second state to 
ratify the U.S. Constitution on December 12, 1787,[51] five days after 
Delaware became the first. Dickinson College of Carlisle was the first 
college founded in the United States. Established in 1773, the college 
was ratified five days after the Treaty of Paris on September 9, 1783. 
The school was founded by Benjamin Rush and named after John Dickinson. 
For half a century, the Commonwealth's General Assembly (legislature) met 
at various places in the general Philadelphia area before starting to meet 
regularly in Independence Hall in Philadelphia for 63 years.[52] But it 
needed a more central location, as for example the Paxton Boys massacres 
of 1763 had made the legislature aware. So, in 1799 the General Assembly 
moved to the Lancaster Courthouse,[52] and finally in 1812 to Harrisburg.[52] 
The General Assembly met in the old Dauphin County Court House until December 
1821,[52] when the Federal-style "Hills Capitol" (named for its builder, 
Stephen Hills, a Lancaster architect) was constructed on a hilltop land 
grant of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient, 
entrepreneurial son and namesake of John Harris, Sr., a Yorkshire native 
who had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry (1733) on the east shore 
of the Susquehanna River.[53] The Hills Capitol burned down on February 
2, 1897, during a heavy snowstorm, presumably because of a faulty flue.[52] 
The General Assembly met at Grace Methodist Church on State Street (still 
standing) until a new capitol could be built. Following an architectural 
selection contest that many alleged had been "rigged", Chicago architect 
Henry Ives Cobb was charged with designing and building a replacement building; 
however, the legislature had little money to allocate to the project, and 
a roughly finished, somewhat industrial building (the Cobb Capitol) was 
completed. The General Assembly refused to occupy the building. Political 
and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted 
to Pennsylvania architects, and Joseph Miller Huston of Philadelphia was 
chosen to design the present Pennsylvania State Capitol that incorporated 
Cobb's building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 
1907.[52] The new state Capitol drew rave reviews.[52] Its dome was inspired 
by the domes of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the United States Capitol.[52] 
President Theodore Roosevelt called it "the most beautiful state Capital 
in the nation" and said, "It's the handsomest building I ever saw" at the 
dedication. In 1989, The New York Times praised it as "grand, even awesome 
at moments, but it is also a working building, accessible to citizens ... 
a building that connects with the reality of daily life".[52] James Buchanan, 
of Franklin County, the only bachelor President of the United States,[54] 
was the only one to be born in Pennsylvania. The Battle of Gettysburg—the 
major turning point of the Civil War—took place near Gettysburg.[55] An 
estimated 350,000 Pennsylvanians served in the Union Army forces including 
8,600 African American military volunteers. Pennsylvania was also the home 
of the first commercially drilled oil well. In 1859, near Titusville, Pennsylvania, 
Edwin Drake successfully drilled the well, which led to the first major 
oil boom in United States history. At the beginning of the 20th century 
Pennsylvania's economy was centered around steel production, logging, coal 
mining, textile production and other forms of industrial manufacturing. 
A surge in immigration to the U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries provided a steady flow of cheap labor for these industries which 
often employed children and persons who could not speak English. In 1923 
President Calvin Coolidge established the Allegheny National Forest under 
the authority of the Weeks Act of 1911 in the northwest part of the state 
in Elk, Forest, McKean, and Warren Counties for the purposes of timber 
production and watershed protection in the Allegheny River basin. The Allegheny 
is the state's only national forest. The United States Census Bureau estimates 
that the population of Pennsylvania was 12,802,503 on July 1, 2015, a 0.79% 
increase since the 2010 United States Census. In an earlier estimate, the 
state was 78.8% Non-Hispanic White, 11.4% Black or African American, 0.3% 
Native American, 3.0% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 
1.7% Two or More Races, and 6.1% Hispanic or Latino.[3] Of the people residing 
in Pennsylvania, 74.5% were born in Pennsylvania, 18.4% were born in a 
different US state, 1.5% were born Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born 
abroad to American parent(s), and 5.6% were foreign born.[56] According 
to the 2010 Census, 81.9% of the population was White (79.2% non-Hispanic 
white), 11.3% was Black or African American, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska 
Native, 2.9% Asian, 1.9% from two or more races. 5.9% of the total population 
was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race).[57] As of 2011, 
32.1% of Pennsylvania's population younger than age one were minorities.[61] 
Pennsylvania's Hispanic population grew by 82.6% between 2000 and 2010, 
making it one of the largest increases in a state's Hispanic population. 
The significant growth of the Hispanic population is due to immigration 
to the state mainly from Puerto Rico, which is a US territory, but to a 
lesser extent from countries such as the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and 
various Central and South American nations, as well as from the wave of 
Hispanics leaving New York and New Jersey for safer and more affordable 
living. The Asian population swelled by almost 60%, which was fueled by 
Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese immigration, as well the many Asian transplants 
moving to Philadelphia from New York. The rapid growth of this community 
has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian populations in the nation 
by numerical values. The Black and African American population grew by 
13%, which was the largest increase in that population amongst the state's 
peers (New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan).The White population 
declined by 0.7%, a trend that is beginning to reverse itself. Twelve other 
states saw decreases in their White populations.[62] The state of Pennsylvania 
has a high in-migration of blacks and Hispanics from other nearby states, 
with eastern and south-central portions of the state seeing the bulk of 
the increases.[63][64] The center of population of Pennsylvania is located 
in Perry County, in the borough of Duncannon.[65] As of 2013, Pennsylvania 
has an estimated population of 12,773,801, which is an increase of 10,265 
from the previous year and an increase of 71,422 since the year 2010. Net 
migration to other states resulted in a decrease of 27,718, and immigration 
from other countries resulted in an increase of 127,007. Net migration 
to the Commonwealth was 98,289. Migration of native Pennsylvanians resulted 
in a decrease of 100,000 people. From 2008 to 2012, 5.8% of the population 
was foreign born.[66] The state has an estimated 2005 poverty rate of 12%.[67] 
The state also has the 3rd highest proportion of elderly (65+) citizens 
in 2005.[67] Foreign born Pennsylvanians are largely from Asia (36.0%), 
Europe (35.9%), and Latin America (30.6%), with the remainder from Africa 
(5%), North America (3.1%), and Oceania (0.4%). The majority of Hispanics 
in Pennsylvania are of Puerto Rican descent, having one of the largest 
and fastest-growing Puerto Rican populations in the country.[68][69] Most 
of the remaining Hispanic population is made up of Mexicans and Dominicans. 
Most Hispanics are concentrated in Philadelphia, Lehigh Valley and South 
Central Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's reported population of Hispanics, 
especially among the Black race, has markedly increased in recent years.[70] 
The Hispanic population is greatest in Hazleton, Allentown, Reading, Lancaster, 
York, and around Philadelphia. It is not clear how much of this change 
reflects a changing population and how much reflects increased willingness 
to self-identify minority status. As of 2010, it is estimated that about 
85% of all Hispanics in Pennsylvania live within a 150 miles (240 km) radius 
of Philadelphia, with about 20% living within the city itself. Of the black 
population, the vast majority in the state are African American, being 
descendants of African slaves brought to the US south during the colonial 
era. There are also a growing number of blacks of West Indian, recent African, 
and Hispanic origins.[71] Most blacks live in the Philadelphia area, Pittsburgh, 
and South Central Pennsylvania, among other areas. Whites make-up the majority 
of Pennsylvania, they are mostly descended from German, Irish, Italian, 
and English immigrants, among others. Rural portions of South Central Pennsylvania 
are famous nationwide for its notable Amish communities. Pennsylvania's 
population was reported as 5.9% under 5 and 23.8% under 18, with 15.6% 
aged 65 or older. Women made up 52% of the population.[72] The largest 
ancestry groups are listed below, expressed as a percentage of total people 
who responded with a particular ancestry for the 2010 census:[73][74] As 
of 2010, 90.15% (10,710,239) of Pennsylvania residents age 5 and older 
spoke English at home as a primary language, while 4.09% (486,058) spoke 
Spanish, 0.87% (103,502) German (which includes Pennsylvania Dutch) and 
by 0.47% (56,052) Chinese (which includes Mandarin) of the population over 
the age of five. In total, 9.85% (1,170,628) of Pennsylvania's population 
age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[76] Pennsylvania 
German is often—even though misleadingly—called "Pennsylvania Dutch". The 
term "Dutch", when referring to the language spoken by the Pennsylvania 
Dutch people (Pennsylvania German) means "German" or "Teutonic" rather 
than "Netherlander". Germans, in their own language, call themselves "Deutsch", 
(Pennsylvania German: "Deitsch") which in English became, misleadingly, 
"Dutch".[77] The Pennsylvania German language is a descendant of German, 
in the West Central German dialect family. It is closest to Palatine German. 
Pennsylvania German is still very vigorous as a first language among Old 
Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites (principally in the Lancaster County 
area), whereas it is almost extinct as an everyday language outside the 
plain communities, though a few words have passed into English usage. Of 
all the colonies, only Rhode Island had religious freedom as secure as 
in Pennsylvania.[78] Voltaire, writing of William Penn in 1733, observed: 
"The new sovereign also enacted several wise and wholesome laws for his 
colony, which have remained invariably the same to this day. The chief 
is, to ill–treat no person on account of religion, and to consider as brethren 
all those who believe in one God."[79] One result of this uncommon freedom 
was a wide religious diversity, which continues to the present. Pennsylvania's 
population in 2010 was 12,702,379. Of these, 6,838,440 (53.8%) were estimated 
to belong to some sort of organized religion. According to the Association 
of religion data archives (ARDA) at Pennsylvania State University, the 
largest religions in Pennsylvania by adherents are the Roman Catholic Church 
with 3,503,028 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 591,734 members, 
and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 501,974 members. The 
third largest single denomination is the Presbyterian Church (USA) with 
250,000 members and 1,011 congregations. Pennsylvania, especially western 
part and Pittsburgh area has one of the highest percentage of Presbyterians 
in the nation. The Presbyterian Church in America has also significant, 
112 congregations and 23,000 adherents, the EPC has around 50 congregations, 
as well as ECO. The next largest Protestant denomination, the United Church 
of Christ, has 180,000 members and 627 congregations. American Baptist 
Churches USA (Northern Baptist Convention) is based in King of Prussia, 
Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was the center state of the German Reformed 
denomination since the 1700s.[80] Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is one of the 
headquarters of the Moravian Church in America. Pennsylvania also has a 
very large Amish population, second only to Ohio among the states.[81] 
In the year 2000 there was a total Amish population of 47,860 in Pennsylvania 
and a further 146,416 Mennonites and 91,200 Brethren. The total Anabapist 
population including Bruderhof was 232,631, about 2 percent of the population.[82] 
While Pennsylvania owes its existence to Quakers, and much of the historic 
character of the Commonwealth is ideologically rooted in the teachings 
of the Religious Society of Friends (as they are officially known), practicing 
Quakers are a small minority of about 10,00 adherents in 2010.[83] The 
religious affiliations of the people of Pennsylvania:[84] According to 
a 2012 Gallup poll, 40% of Pennsylvanians are very religious, 28% are moderately 
religious, and 32% are non-religious.[85] Pennsylvania's 2013 total gross 
state product (GSP) of $644 billion ranks the state 6th in the nation.[86] 
If Pennsylvania were an independent country, its economy would rank as 
the 18th largest in the world. On a per-capita basis, Pennsylvania's per-capita 
GSP of $47,274 (in chained 2009 dollars) ranks 26th among the 50 states.[86] 
Philadelphia in the southeast corner, Pittsburgh in the southwest corner, 
Erie in the northwest corner, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre in the northeast corner, 
and Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton in the east central region are urban manufacturing 
centers. Much of the Commonwealth is rural; this dichotomy affects state 
politics as well as the state economy.[87] Philadelphia is home to six 
Fortune 500 companies,[88] with more located in suburbs like King of Prussia; 
it is a leader in the financial[89] and insurance industry. Pittsburgh 
is home to eight Fortune 500 companies, including U.S. Steel, PPG Industries, 
and H.J. Heinz.[88] In all, Pennsylvania is home to fifty Fortune 500 companies.[88] 
Erie is also home to GE Transportation Systems, which is the largest producer 
of train locomotives in the United States. As in the US as a whole and 
in most states, the largest private employer in the Commonwealth is Wal-Mart, 
followed by the University of Pennsylvania.[90][91] Pennsylvania is also 
home to the oldest investor-owned utility company in the U.S.A, The York 
Water Company. As of June 2014, the state's unemployment rate is 5.6%.[92] 
The first nationally chartered bank in the United States, the Bank of North 
America, was founded in 1781 in Philadelphia. After a series of mergers, 
the Bank of North America is part of Wells Fargo, which uses national charter 
1. Pennsylvania is also the home to the first nationally chartered bank 
under the 1863 National Banking Act. That year, the Pittsburgh Savings 
& Trust Company received a national charter and renamed itself the First 
National Bank of Pittsburgh as part of the National Banking Act. That bank 
is still in existence today as PNC Financial Services and remains based 
in Pittsburgh. PNC is the state's largest bank, and the sixth-largest in 
the United States. Pennsylvania ranks 19th overall in agricultural production.[93] 
It also ranks 8th in the nation in Winemaking.[94] The Pennsylvania Department 
of Agriculture worked with private companies to establish "PA Preferred" 
as a way to brand agricultural products grown or made in the state to support 
and promote Pennsylvania products and locally-grown food.[95] The financial 
impact of agriculture in Pennsylvania[96] includes employment of more than 
66,800 people are employed by the food manufacturing industry; and over 
$1.7 billion in food product export (in 2011). Casino gambling was legalized 
in Pennsylvania in 2004. Currently, there are nine casinos across the state 
with three under construction or in planning. Only horse racing, slot machines 
and electronic table games were legal in Pennsylvania, although a bill 
to legalize table games was being negotiated in the fall of 2009.[97] Tables 
games such as poker, roulette, black jack and dice were finally approved 
by the state legislature in January 2010, being signed into law by the 
Governor on January 7. Sports betting is illegal. Former Governor Ed Rendell 
had considered legalizing video poker machines in bars and private clubs 
in 2009, since an estimated 17,000 operate illegally across the state.[98] 
Under this plan, any establishment with a liquor license would be allowed 
up to 5 machines. All machines would be connected to the state's computer 
system, like commercial casinos. The state would impose a 50% tax on net 
gambling revenues, after winning players have been paid, with the remaining 
50% going to the establishment owners. The Pennsylvania Film Production 
Tax Credit began in 2004 and stimulated the development of a film industry 
in the state.[99] Pennsylvania has had five constitutions during its statehood:[102] 
1776, 1790, 1838, 1874, and 1968. Before that the province of Pennsylvania 
was governed for a century by a Frame of Government, of which there were 
four versions: 1682, 1683, 1696, and 1701.[102] The capital of Pennsylvania 
is Harrisburg. The legislature meets in the State Capitol there. For most 
of the second half of the 20th century, Pennsylvania was a powerful swing 
state. It only supported the losing candidate in a presidential election 
twice from 1932 to 1988. Since 1992, Pennsylvania has been trending Democratic 
in Presidential elections, voting for Bill Clinton twice by large margins, 
and slightly closer in 2000 for Al Gore. In the 2004 Presidential Election, 
Senator John F. Kerry beat President George W. Bush in Pennsylvania 2,938,095 
(50.92%) to 2,793,847 (48.42%). In the 2008 Presidential Election, Democrat 
Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Pennsylvania, 3,184,778 
(54%) to 2,584,088 (44%). Most recently, in the 2016 Presidential Election, 
Donald Trump became the first Republican candidate to win the state since 
1988, winning the state 48.8% to 47.6%.[103] The state holds 20 electoral 
votes.[67] In recent national elections, Pennsylvania has leaned Democratic. 
The state has voted for the Democratic ticket for president in every election 
since 1992 and during the 2008 election campaign a recruitment drive saw 
registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 1.2 million. However, 
Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican senators. From 2009 to 
2011, the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first 
time since 1947. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat as 
well as a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both 
chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion. Democrats 
won back the governor's mansion 4 years later in the 2014 election. It 
was the first time since a governor became eligible to succeed himself 
that an incumbent governor had been defeated for reelection. Historically, 
Democratic strength was concentrated in Philadelphia in the southeast, 
the Pittsburgh and Johnstown areas in the southwest, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
in the northeast. Republican strength was concentrated in the Philadelphia 
suburbs, as well as the more rural areas in the central, northeastern, 
and western portions. The latter counties have long been among the most 
conservative areas in the nation. Since 1992, however, the Philadelphia 
suburbs have swung Democratic; the brand of Republicanism there was traditionally 
a moderate one. The Pittsburgh suburbs, historically a Democratic stronghold, 
have swung more Republican since the turn of the millennium. Under normal 
conditions, a Democratic presidential candidate can run up enough of a 
margin in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to carry the state. Democratic political 
consultant James Carville once pejoratively described Pennsylvania as "Philadelphia 
in the east, Pittsburgh in the west and Alabama in the middle". Political 
analysts and editorials refer to central Pennsylvania as the "T" in statewide 
elections. Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre generally 
vote for Democratic candidates, while the majority of the counties in the 
central part of the state vote Republican. As a result, maps showing the 
results of statewide elections invariably form a "T" shape. The current 
Governor is Tom Wolf. The other elected officials composing the executive 
branch are the Lieutenant Governor Michael Stack, Attorney General Bruce 
Beemer, Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, and Pennsylvania Treasurer Tim 
Reese. Governor and Lieutenant Governor run as a ticket in the general 
election and are up for reelection in 2018. Pennsylvania will hold elections 
for Attorney General, Auditor General and Treasurer in 2016.[104] Pennsylvania 
has a bicameral legislature set up by Commonwealth's constitution in 1790. 
The original Frame of Government of William Penn had a unicameral legislature.[105] 
The General Assembly includes 50 Senators[106] and 203 Representatives.[107] 
Joe Scarnati is currently President Pro Tempore of the State Senate,[108] 
Dominic Pileggi the Majority Leader,[109] and Jay Costa the Minority Leader.[110] 
Sam Smith is Speaker of the House of Representatives,[111] with Mike Turzai 
as Majority Leader[112] and Frank Dermody as Minority Leader.[113] As of 
the 2012 elections, the Republicans hold the majority in the State House 
and Senate. Pennsylvania is divided into 60 judicial districts,[114] most 
of which (except Philadelphia) have magisterial district judges (formerly 
called district justices and justices of the peace), who preside mainly 
over preliminary hearings in felony and misdemeanor offenses, all minor 
(summary) criminal offenses, and small civil claims.[114] Most criminal 
and civil cases originate in the Courts of Common Pleas, which also serve 
as appellate courts to the district judges and for local agency decisions.[114] 
The Superior Court hears all appeals from the Courts of Common Pleas not 
expressly designated to the Commonwealth Court or Supreme Court. It also 
has original jurisdiction to review warrants for wiretap surveillance.[114] 
The Commonwealth Court is limited to appeals from final orders of certain 
state agencies and certain designated cases from the Courts of Common Pleas.[114] 
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is the final appellate court. All judges 
in Pennsylvania are elected; the chief justice is determined by seniority.[114] 
Pennsylvania has the 10th highest tax burden in the United States.[115] 
Residents pay a total of $83.7 billion in state and local taxes with a 
per capita average of $6,640 annually. Residents share 76% of the total 
tax burden. Many state politicians have tried to increase the share of 
taxes paid by out of state sources. Suggested revenue sources include taxing 
natural gas drilling as Pennsylvania is the only state without such a tax 
on gas drilling.[116] Additional revenue prospects include trying to place 
tolls on interstate highways; specifically Interstate 80 which is used 
heavily by out of state commuters with high maintenance costs.[117] Sales 
tax provides 39% of Commonwealth's revenue; personal income tax 34%; motor 
vehicle taxes about 12%, and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol beverage 5%.[118] 
Personal income tax is a flat 3.07%. An individual's taxable income is 
based on the following eight types of income: compensation (salary); interest; 
dividends; net profits from the operation of a business, profession or 
farm; net gains or income from the dispositions of property; net gains 
or income from rents, royalties, patents and copyrights; income derived 
through estates or trusts; and gambling and lottery winnings (other than 
Pennsylvania Lottery winnings).[119] Counties, municipalities, and school 
districts levy taxes on real estate. In addition, some local bodies assess 
a wage tax on personal income. Generally, the total wage tax rate is capped 
at 1% of income but some municipalities with home rule charters may charge 
more than 1%. Thirty-two of the Commonwealth's sixty-seven counties levy 
a personal property tax on stocks, bonds, and similar holdings. Pennsylvania's 
two U.S. Senators are Bob Casey, Jr. and Pat Toomey. Pennsylvania's current 
U.S. Representatives are Bob Brady (1st), Dwight Evans (2nd), Mike Kelly 
(3rd), Scott Perry (4th), Glenn "G.T." Thompson (5th), Ryan Costello (6th), 
Pat Meehan (7th), Mike Fitzpatrick (8th), Bill Shuster (9th), Tom Marino 
(10th), Lou Barletta (11th), Keith Rothfus (12th), Brendan Boyle (13th), 
Mike Doyle (14th), Charlie Dent (15th), Joe Pitts (16th), Matt Cartwright 
(17th), Tim Murphy (18th).[120] See map of congressional districts Pennsylvania 
is divided into 67 counties.[121] Counties are further subdivided into 
municipalities that are either incorporated as cities, boroughs, or townships.[122] 
One county, Philadelphia County, is coterminous with the city of Philadelphia 
after it was consolidated in 1854. The most populous county in Pennsylvania 
is Philadelphia, while the least populous is Cameron (5,085).[63] There 
are a total of 56 cities in Pennsylvania, which are classified, by population, 
as either first, second, or third class cities.[121][123] Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania's largest city, has a population of 1,526,006 and is the state's 
only first class city.[122] Pittsburgh (305,704) and Scranton (76,089) 
are second class and second class 'A' cities, respectively.[122] The rest 
of the cities, like the third and fourth largest—Allentown (118,032) and 
Erie (101,786)—to the smallest—Parker with a population of only 840—are 
third class cities.[124] First and second class cities are governed by 
a "strong mayor" form of mayor–council government, whereas third class 
cities are governed by either a "weak mayor" form of government or a council–manager 
government.[122] Boroughs are generally smaller than cities, with most 
Pennsylvania cities having been incorporated as a borough before being 
incorporated as a city.[122] There are 958 boroughs in Pennsylvania, all 
of which governed by the "weak mayor" form of mayor–council government.[121][122] 
The largest borough in Pennsylvania is State College (42,034) and the smallest 
is Centralia (10). Townships are the third type of municipality in Pennsylvania 
and are classified as either first class or second class townships. There 
are 1,454 second class townships and 93 first class townships.[125] Second 
class township can become first class townships if it has a population 
density greater than 300 inhabitants per square mile (120/km2) and a referendum 
is passed supporting the change.[125] Pennsylvania's largest township is 
Upper Darby Township (82,795), and the smallest is East Keating Township 
(11). There is one exception to the types of municipalities in Pennsylvania: 
Bloomsburg was incorporated as a town in 1870 and is, officially, the only 
town in the state.[126] In 1975, McCandless Township adopted a home-rule 
charter under the name of "Town of McCandless", but is, legally, still 
a first class township.[127] The total of 56 cities, 958 boroughs, 93 first 
class townships, 1454 second class townships, and 1 town (Bloomsburg) is 
2562 municipalities. Pennsylvania has a mixed health record, and is ranked 
as the 29th overall healthiest state according to the 2013 United Health 
Foundation's Health Rankings.[129] Pennsylvania has 500 public school districts, 
thousands of private schools, publicly funded colleges and universities, 
and over 100 private institutions of higher education. In general, under 
state law, school attendance in Pennsylvania is mandatory for a child from 
the age of 8 until the age of 17, or until graduation from an accredited 
high school, whichever is earlier.[130] As of 2005, 83.8% of Pennsylvania 
residents age 18 to 24 have completed high school. Among residents age 
25 and over, 86.7% have graduated from high school. The following are the 
four-year graduation rates for students completing high school in 2015:[131] 
Additionally, 25.7% have gone on to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher.[132] 
State students consistently do well in standardized testing. In 2007, Pennsylvania 
ranked 14th in mathematics, 12th in reading, and 10th in writing for 8th 
grade students.[133] In 1988, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed 
Act 169, which allows parents or guardians to homeschool their children 
as an option for compulsory school attendance. This law specifies the requirements 
and responsibilities of the parents and the school district where the family 
lives.[134] The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) 
is the public university system of the Commonwealth, with 14 state-owned 
schools. The Commonwealth System of Higher Education is an organizing body 
of the 4 state-related schools in Pennsylvania, these schools are independent 
institutions that receive some state funding. There are also 15 publicly 
funded two-year community colleges and technical schools that are separate 
from the PASSHE system. Additionally there are many private two- and four-year 
technical schools, colleges and universities. Carnegie Mellon University, 
The Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pennsylvania, and 
the University of Pittsburgh, are members of the Association of American 
Universities, an invitation only organization of leading research universities. 
Lehigh University is also another renowned private research university 
located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.The Pennsylvania State University is 
the Commonwealth's Land-grant university, Sea Grant College and, Space 
Grant College. The University of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, 
is considered the first university in the United States and established 
the country's first medical school. The University of Pennsylvania is also 
the Commonwealth's only, and geographically the most southern, Ivy League 
school. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is the first and oldest 
art school in the United States.[135] Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, 
now a part of University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, was the first 
pharmacy school in the United States.[136] Pennsylvania is home to the 
nation's first zoo, the Philadelphia Zoo.[137] Other long-accredited AZA 
zoos include the Erie Zoo and the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium. The Lehigh 
Valley Zoo and ZOOAMERICA are other notable zoos. The Commonwealth boasts 
some of the finest museums in the country, including the Carnegie Museums 
in Pittsburgh, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and several others. One 
unique museum is the Houdini Museum in Scranton, the only building in the 
world devoted to the legendary magician.[138] Pennsylvania is also home 
to the National Aviary, located in Pittsburgh. All 121 state parks in Pennsylvania 
feature free admission. Pennsylvania offers a number of notable amusement 
parks, including Camel Beach, Conneaut Lake Park, Dorney Park & Wildwater 
Kingdom, Dutch Wonderland, DelGrosso Amusement Park, Hersheypark, Idlewild 
Park, Kennywood, Knoebels, Lakemont Park, Sandcastle Waterpark, Sesame 
Place, Great Wolf Lodge and Waldameer Park. Pennsylvania also is home to 
the largest indoor waterpark resort on the East Coast, Splash Lagoon in 
Erie. There are also notable music festivals that take place in Pennsylvania. 
These include Musikfest and NEARfest in Bethlehem, the Philadelphia Folk 
Festival, Creation Festival, the Great Allentown Fair, and Purple Door. 
There are nearly one million licensed hunters in Pennsylvania. Whitetail 
deer, black bear, cottontail rabbits, squirrel, turkey, and grouse are 
common game species. Pennsylvania is considered one of the finest wild 
turkey hunting states in the Union, alongside Texas and Alabama. Sport 
hunting in Pennsylvania provides a massive boost for the Commonwealth's 
economy. A report from The Center for Rural Pennsylvania (a Legislative 
Agency of the Pennsylvania General Assembly) reported that hunting, fishing, 
and furtaking generated a total of $9.6 billion statewide. The Boone and 
Crockett Club shows that five of the ten largest (skull size) black bear 
entries came from the state.[139] The state also has a tied record for 
the largest hunter shot black bear in the Boone & Crockett books at 733 lb 
(332 kg) and a skull of 23 3/16 tied with a bear shot in California in 
1993.[139] The largest bear ever found dead was in Utah in 1975, and the 
second largest was shot by a poacher in the state in 1987.[139] Pennsylvania 
holds the second highest number of Boone & Crockett-recorded record black 
bears at 183, second only to Wisconsin's 299.[139] The Pennsylvania Department 
of Transportation, abbreviated as PennDOT, owns 39,861 miles (64,150 km) 
of the 121,770 miles (195,970 km) of roadway in the state, making it the 
fifth largest state highway system in the United States.[140] The Pennsylvania 
Turnpike system is 535 miles (861 km) long, with the mainline portion stretching 
from Ohio to Philadelphia and New Jersey.[140] It is overseen by the Pennsylvania 
Turnpike Commission. Another major east–west route is Interstate 80, which 
runs primarily in the northern tier of the state from Ohio to New Jersey 
at the Delaware Water Gap. Interstate 90 travels the relatively short distance 
between Ohio and New York through Erie County, in the extreme northwestern 
part of the state. Primary north–south highways are Interstate 79 from 
its terminus in Erie through Pittsburgh to West Virginia, Interstate 81 
from New York through Scranton, Lackawanna County and Harrisburg to Maryland 
and Interstate 476, which begins 7 miles (11 km) north of the Delaware 
border, in Chester, Delaware County and travels 132 miles (212 km) to Clarks 
Summit, Lackawanna County, where it joins I-81. All but 20 miles (32 km) 
of I-476 is the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, while 
the highway south of the main line of the Pennsylvania Turnpike is officially 
called the "Veterans Memorial Highway", but is commonly referred to by 
locals as the "Blue Route". The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation 
Authority (SEPTA) is the sixth largest transit agency in the United States 
and operates the commuter, heavy and light rail transit, and transit bus 
service in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The Port Authority of Allegheny 
County is the 25th largest transit agency and provides transit bus and 
light rail service in and around Pittsburgh.[141] Intercity passenger rail 
transit is provided by Amtrak, with the majority of traffic occurring on 
the Keystone Service in the high-speed Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg 
and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station before heading north to New York 
City; the Pennsylvanian follows the same route from New York City to Harrisburg, 
but extends out to Pittsburgh. The Capitol Limited also passes through 
Pittsburgh, as well as Connellsville, on its way from Chicago to Washington, 
D.C.[142] Traveling between Chicago and New York City, the Lake Shore Limited 
passes through Erie once in each direction.[142] There are 67 short-line, 
freight railroads operating in Pennsylvania, the highest number in any 
U.S. state.[142] Pennsylvania has seven major airports: Philadelphia International, 
Pittsburgh International, Lehigh Valley International, Harrisburg International, 
Erie International, University Park Airport and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International. 
A total of 134 public-use airports are located in the state.[142] The port 
of Pittsburgh is the second largest inland port in the United States and 
the 18th largest port overall; the Port of Philadelphia is the 24th largest 
port in the United States.[143] Pennsylvania's only port on the Great Lakes 
is located in Erie. The Allegheny River Lock and Dam Two is the most-used 
lock operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers of its 255 nationwide.[144] 
The dam impounds the Allegheny River near Downtown Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania 
is home to many major league professional sports teams; the Pittsburgh 
Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League, the Philadelphia 
Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball, the Philadelphia 
76ers of the National Basketball Association, the Philadelphia Flyers and 
Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League, the Philadelphia Union 
of Major League Soccer. Among them, these teams have accumulated 7 World 
Series Championships (Pirates 5, Phillies 2), 16 National League Pennants 
(Pirates 9, Phillies 7), 3 pre-Super Bowl era NFL Championships (Eagles), 
6 Super Bowl Championships (Steelers), 2 NBA Championships (76ers), and 
6 Stanley Cups (Penguins 4, Flyers 2). Pennsylvania also has minor league 
and semi-pro sports teams: the Triple-A baseball Lehigh Valley IronPigs 
and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the International League; the 
Double-A baseball Altoona Curve, Erie SeaWolves, Harrisburg Senators, and 
Reading Fightin Phils of the Eastern League; the Class A-Short Season baseball

the Arena Football League. Among them, these teams have accumulated 12 
triple and double A baseball league titles (RailRiders 1, Senators 6, Fightin 
Phils 4 Curve 1), 1 Arena Bowl Championship (Soul), and 11 Calder Cups 
(Bears). Since 1959, the Little League World Series is held each summer 
in South Williamsport, near where Little League Baseball was founded in 
Williamsport.[145] Also, the first World Series between the Boston Pilgrims 
(which became the Boston Red Sox) and Pittsburgh Pirates was played in 
Pittsburgh in 1903. Soccer is gaining popularity within the state of Pennsylvania 
as well. With the addition of the Philadelphia Union in the MLS, the state 
now boasts three teams that are eligible to compete for the Lamar Hunt 
U.S. Open Cup annually. The other two teams are the Pittsburgh Riverhounds 
and the Harrisburg City Islanders, both of the United Soccer Leagues Second 
Division (USL-2). Within the American Soccer Pyramid, the MLS takes the 
first tier, while the USL-2 claims the third tier. In motorsports, the 
Mario Andretti dynasty of race drivers hails from Nazareth in the Lehigh 
Valley. Notable racetracks in Pennsylvania include the Jennerstown Speedway 
in Jennerstown, the Lake Erie Speedway in North East, the Mahoning Valley 
Speedway in Lehighton, the Motordome Speedway in Smithton, the Mountain 
Speedway in St. Johns, the Nazareth Speedway in Nazareth (closed); and 
the Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, which is home to two NASCAR Cup Series 
races and an IndyCar Series race. The state is also home to Maple Grove 
Raceway, near Reading, which hosts major National Hot Rod Association sanctioned 
drag racing events each year. There are also two motocross race tracks 
that host a round of the AMA Toyota Motocross Championships in Pennsylvania. 
High Point Raceway in located in Mt. Morris, Pennsylvania, and Steel City 
is located in Delmont, Pennsylvania. Horse racing courses in Pennsylvania 
consist of The Meadows near Pittsburgh, Pocono Downs in Wilkes-Barre, and 
Harrah's Philadelphia in Chester, which offer harness racing, and Penn 
National Race Course in Grantville, Parx Racing (formerly Philadelphia 
Park) in Bensalem, and Presque Isle Downs near Erie, which offer thoroughbred 
racing. Smarty Jones, the 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, 
had Philadelphia Park as his home course. Arnold Palmer, one of the 20th 
century's most notable pro golfers, comes from Latrobe, while Jim Furyk, 
a current PGA member, grew up near in Lancaster. PGA tournaments in Pennsylvania 
include the 84 Lumber Classic, played at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort, in 
Farmington and the Northeast Pennsylvania Classic, played at Glenmaura 
National Golf Club, in Moosic. Philadelphia is home to LOVE Park, once 
a popular spot for skateboarding, and across from City Hall, host to ESPN's 
X Games in 2001 and 2002.[146] College football is popular in Pennsylvania[citation 
needed]. There are three colleges in Pennsylvania that play at the highest 
level of collegiate football competition, the NCAA Division I Football 
Bowl Subdivision. Two play in Power Five conferences, the Penn State University 
Nittany Lions of the Big Ten Conference and the University of Pittsburgh 
Panthers of the Atlantic Coast Conference, while the Temple University 
Owls play in the American Athletic Conference. Penn State, claims two national 
championships (1982 & 1986) as well as seven undefeated seasons (1887, 
1912, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1986 and 1994). Penn State plays its home games 
in the second largest stadium in the United States, Beaver Stadium, which 
seats 107,282, and is currently led by head coach James Franklin. The University 
of Pittsburgh Panthers claims nine national championships (1915, 1916, 
1918, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, 1937 and 1976) and has played eight undefeated 
seasons (1904, 1910, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1920, 1937 and 1976).[147] Pitt 
plays its home games at Heinz Field, a facility it shares with the Pittsburgh 
Steelers, and is led by current head football coach Pat Narduzzi. Other 
Pennsylvania schools that have won national titles in football include 
Lafayette College (1896), Villanova University (FCS 2009), the University 
of Pennsylvania (1895, 1897, 1904 and 1908)[148] and Washington and Jefferson 
College (1921). College basketball is also popular in the state, especially 
in the Philadelphia area where five universities, collectively termed the 
Big Five, have a rich tradition in NCAA Division I basketball. National 
titles in college basketball have been won by the following Pennsylvania 
universities: La Salle University (1954), Temple University (1938), University 
of Pennsylvania (1920 and 1921), University of Pittsburgh (1928 and 1930), 
and Villanova University (1985 and 2016).[149][150] In his book Yo Mama 
Cooks Like a Yankee, author Sharon Hernes Silverman calls Pennsylvania 
the snack food capital of the world.[151] It leads all other states in 
the manufacture of pretzels and potato chips. The Sturgis Pretzel House 
introduced the pretzel to America, and companies like Anderson Bakery Company, 
Intercourse Pretzel Factory, and Snyder's of Hanover are leading manufacturers 
in the Commonwealth. Two of the three companies that define the U.S. potato 
chip industry are based in Pennsylvania: Utz Quality Foods, which started 
making chips in Hanover, Pennsylvania in 1921, and Wise Foods which started 
making chips in Berwick in 1921 (the third, Lay's Potato Chips, is a Texas 
company). Other companies such as Herr's Snacks, Martin's Potato Chips, 
Snyder's of Berlin (not associated with Snyder's of Hanover) and Troyer 
Farms Potato Products are popular chip manufacturers. The U.S. chocolate 
industry is centered in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with Mars, Godiva, and Wilbur 
Chocolate Company nearby, and smaller manufacturers such as Asher's[152] 
in Souderton,[153] and Gertrude Hawk Chocolates of Dunmore. Other notable 
companies include Just Born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, makers of Hot Tamales, 
Mike and Ikes, the Easter favorite marshmallow Peeps, and Boyer Brothers 
of Altoona, Pennsylvania, which is well known for its Mallo Cups. Auntie 
Anne's Pretzels began as a market-stand in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, and 
now has corporate headquarters in Lancaster City.[154] Traditional Pennsylvania 
Dutch foods include chicken potpie, ham potpie, schnitz un knepp (dried 
apples, ham, and dumplings), fasnachts (raised doughnuts), scrapple, pretzels, 
bologna, chow-chow, and Shoofly pie. Martin's Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc., 
headquartered in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, specializes in potato bread, 
another traditional Pennsylvania Dutch food. D.G. Yuengling & Son, America's 
oldest brewery, has been brewing beer in Pottsville since 1829. Among the 
regional foods associated with Philadelphia are cheesesteaks, hoagie, soft 
pretzels, Italian water ice, Irish potato candy, scrapple, Tastykake, Wawa, 
and strombolis. In Pittsburgh, tomato ketchup was improved by Henry John 
Heinz from 1876 to the early 20th century. Famous to a lesser extent than 
Heinz ketchup are the Pittsburgh's Primanti Brothers Restaurant sandwiches, 
pierogies, and city chicken. Outside of Scranton, in Old Forge there are 
dozens of Italian restaurants specializing in pizza made unique by thick, 
light crust and American cheese. Erie also has its share of unique foods, 
including Greek sauce and sponge candy. Sauerkraut along with pork and 
mashed potatoes is a common meal on New Year's Day in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania 
has been known as the Keystone State since 1802,[158] based in part upon 
its central location among the original Thirteen Colonies forming the United 
States, and also in part because of the number of important American documents 
signed in the state (such as the Declaration of Independence). It was also 
a keystone state economically, having both the industry common to the North 
(making such wares as Conestoga wagons and rifles)[159][160] and the agriculture 
common to the South (producing feed, fiber, food, and tobacco).[161] Another 
one of Pennsylvania's nicknames is the Quaker State; in colonial times, 
it was known officially as the Quaker Province,[162] in recognition of 
Quaker[163] William Penn's First Frame of Government[164] constitution 
for Pennsylvania that guaranteed liberty of conscience. He knew of the 
hostility[165] Quakers faced when they opposed religious ritual, taking 
oaths, violence, war and military service, and what they viewed as ostentatious 
frippery.[166] "The Coal State", "The Oil State", "The Chocolate State", 
and "The Steel State" were adopted when those were the state's greatest 
industries.[167] "The State of Independence" currently appears on many 
road signs entering the state. Coordinates: 41°00′N 77°30′W﻿ / ﻿41°N 77.5°W﻿
