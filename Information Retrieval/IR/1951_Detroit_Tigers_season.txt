The 1951 Detroit Tigers season was a season in American baseball. The team 
finished fifth in the American League with a record of 73–81, 25 games 
behind the New York Yankees. On August 19, the Tigers played a doubleheader 
in St. Louis against the Browns. In the second game, after the Tigers had 
batted in the top of the first inning, the Browns sent midget Eddie Gaedel 
up to pinch-hit for leadoff batter Frank Saucier. Gaedel, at a height of 
3'7", is to date the shortest player to appear in a Major League Baseball 
game. Umpire Ed Hurley challenged the decision to allow Gaedel to participate 
in an at-bat. Browns manager Zack Taylor produced a contract.[2] Tigers 
pitcher Bob Cain walked him.[3] Jim Delsing pinch ran for Gaedel,[3] but 
failed to score. The Tigers won the game, 6–2. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 
[7] [8] The 1951 All-Star Game was originally awarded to the Philadelphia 
Phillies. The City of Detroit was celebrating the 250th anniversary of 
its founding in 1701 and requested to host the year's All-Star Game. Although 
the National League was scheduled to host the game in '51, the game was 
moved to Detroit's Briggs Stadium to coincide with the city's celebration. 
The Phillies instead hosted the 1952 All-Star Game at Shibe Park.[4] Infielders
