Delbert Eugene "Del" Webb (May 17, 1899 – July 4, 1974, aged 75) was an 
American real estate developer and a co-owner of the New York Yankees baseball 
club. He is known for founding and developing the retirement community 
of Sun City, Arizona, and for many works of his firm, Del E. Webb Construction 
Company. Webb was born in Fresno, California, to Ernest G Webb, a fruit 
farmer, and Henrietta S. Webb. He dropped out of high school to become 
a carpenter's apprentice, and in 1919, he married Hazel Lenora Church, 
a graduate nurse. In 1920, Webb was a ship fitter, and they were living 
with his parents and two younger brothers in Placer County, California. 
At the age of 28, he suffered typhoid fever, and as a result moved to Phoenix, 
Arizona, to recover. In 1928, Webb began his namesake company which was 
a construction contractor. He received many military contracts during World 
War II, including the construction of the Poston War Relocation Center 
near Parker, Arizona. Poston interned over 17,000 Japanese-Americans and 
at the time was the third largest “city” in Arizona. Webb was associated 
with Howard Hughes and played golf with Hughes, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, 
and Robert and Barry Goldwater. A lifelong baseball fan, in 1945, Webb 
and partners Dan Topping and Larry MacPhail purchased the New York Yankees 
for $2.8 million from the estate of Col. Jake Ruppert, Jr.. After buying 
out MacPhail in October 1947, Webb and Topping remained owners of the Yankees 
until selling the club to CBS in 1964. In 1946 and 1947, Jewish American 
New York mob boss Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel hired Webb as a construction 
foreman for the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. After boasting 
about his claim that he'd personally killed some men, Siegel once said 
to Webb, "Del, don't worry, we only kill each other."[1][2] In 1948, Webb 
was contracted to build 600 houses and a shopping center called Pueblo 
Gardens in Tucson, Arizona. This was a prelude to Sun City, Arizona, which 
was launched January 1, 1960, with five home models, a shopping center, 
recreation center and golf course. The opening weekend drew 100,000 people, 
ten times more than expected, and resulted in a Time magazine cover story.[3] 
In between these two projects, in 1951, he was given the huge contract 
to build the Hughes Missile Plant (now Raytheon) in Tucson, Arizona.[4] 
Webb also developed a chain of motor hotels under the “Hiway House” name, 
more "formal" hotels called "Del Webb's Towne House", and in addition to 
building the Flamingo for Siegel later owned his own casinos, the Sahara 
and The Mint in Las Vegas, and the Sahara Tahoe at Stateline, Nevada. Webb 
died at age 75 in Rochester, Minnesota at the Mayo Clinic, following surgery 
for lung cancer, less than two months after Topping’s death. Webb was elected 
to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 2000.[5] The Del Webb Middle School, named 
in his honor, opened in Henderson, Nevada in 2005. A charitable foundation 
named for him funds medical research in Nevada, Arizona and California. 
In 1919, Webb married his childhood sweetheart, Hazel Lenora Church. They 
divorced in 1952. In 1961, Webb married Toni Ince (aged 41), a buyer for 
Bullock's-Wilshire department store in Los Angeles.[6] Toni Ince Webb (January 
24, 1921 – July 10, 2008) lived in Beverly Hills, California until her
