As Player As Manager John Joseph "Jack" Doyle (October 25, 1869 – December 
31, 1958) was an Irish-American first baseman in Major League Baseball 
whose career spanned 17 seasons, mainly in the National League.[1] He was 
born in Killorglin, Ireland, and emigrated to the U.S. when he was a child, 
his family settling in Holyoke, Massachusetts.[2] After attending Fordham 
University, he embarked on a baseball career that would last 70 years. 
He made his first appearance at the major league level by signing and playing 
two years for the Columbus Solons of the American Association. Doyle would 
play for ten clubs from 1889 to 1905, batting .299 in 1,564 games with 
516 stolen bases. He began as a catcher–outfielder and became a first baseman 
in 1894. His best years were in 1894, when he batted .367 for the New York 
Giants, and in 1897, when he hit .354 with 62 stolen bases for the Baltimore 
Orioles.[1] He is credited with being the first pinch-hitter in pro ball, 
with Cleveland at Brooklyn on June 7, 1892. Patsy Tebeau was the manager 
and Doyle came through with a game-winning single.[2] For the 1894 season, 
he took over the everyday duties at first base and became team captain[3] 
. Manager John Montgomery Ward not only make the decision to replace his 
former teammate and friend Roger Connor, but released him as well. Connor 
was a very popular player, and this decision drew the ire and scrutiny 
from the fans and media alike. Ward defended his decision, and claimed 
the move came down to the fact that he liked Doyle's playing style, describing 
him as a hustler.[4] Replacing Connor at first base proved worth the risk 
as Jack batted .367 that season, and he totaled 100 runs batted in, and 
stole 42 bases.[1] Because of his aggressive playing style, Doyle was known 
as "Dirty Jack", often feuding with umpires, fans, opposing players, and 
even, at times, his own teammates.[5] On one occasion, in Cincinnati on 
July 4, 1900, while in the 3rd inning of the second game of a doubleheader, 
Doyle slugged umpire Bob Emslie after being called out on a steal attempt. 
Fans jumped from the stands as the two got into it, and players finally 
separated the two fighters. Two policemen chased the fans back into the 
stands and then arrested and fined Doyle.[2] On July 1, 1901, when he was 
being harassed by a Polo Grounds fan, he jumped into the stands and hit 
him once with his left hand, reinjuring it after having broken it several 
weeks earlier.[6] He carried on a lengthy feud with John McGraw that started 
when they were teammates at Baltimore. McGraw, of course, had to have the 
last word. In 1902, McGraw was appointed manager of the Giants, and his 
first act was to release Doyle, even though he was batting .301 and fielding 
.991 at the time. Even with these seemingly out-of-control traits, Doyle 
was deemed a natural leader and was selected as team captain in New York, 
Brooklyn and Chicago, and served as an interim manager for the Giants in 
1895 and Washington Senators in 1898.[2] In 1905, after playing one game 
with the New York Highlanders, Doyle became manager of Toledo of the Western 
Association. One year later, in 1906, he was named the manager of the Des 
Moines Champions, so named because they won the league championship the 
previous year, and they won it again under Doyle's helm. Following his 
championship season at Des Moines, he managed Milwaukee in 1907[5] In 1908–09, 
the only years of his adult life spent outside of baseball, he served as 
police commissioner of his hometown of Holyoke.[2] Doyle returned to the 
game as an umpire and worked in the National League for 42 games in 1911.[7] 
Later on he would join the Chicago Cubs as a scout in 1920. In his many 
years with the Cubs, Doyle was credited with signing or recommending the 
acquisition of such stars as Gabby Hartnett, Hack Wilson, Billy Herman, 
Stan Hack, Bill Jurges, Charlie Root, Bill Lee, Augie Galan, Riggs Stephenson 
and Phil Cavarretta.[5] He remained in that capacity until his death at 
age 89 on New Year's Eve 1958. He was buried at St. Jerome Cemetery in 
Holyoke.[7] In the Irish Baseball League, the annual award for best slugger
