The 2016 Washington Nationals season was the Nationals' 12th season as 
the baseball franchise of Major League Baseball in the District of Columbia, 
the ninth season at Nationals Park, and the 48th since the original team 
was started in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They won the National League East 
division title for the third time in five years, posting a 95–67 record, 
and were defeated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the Division 
Series. Less than 24 hours after the end of the 2015 season, manager Matt 
Williams and his entire coaching staff were dismissed.[1] Some coaches 
were offered other positions in the organization, with bench coach Randy 
Knorr notably accepting a position as senior assistant to general manager 
Mike Rizzo for player development.[2] The Nationals embarked on a wide-ranging 
search to replace Williams, who was still owed salary for 2016 after being 
fired midway through a multi-year contract.[3] Among the candidates they 
interviewed were former Cincinnati Reds manager Dusty Baker, former San 
Diego Padres manager Bud Black, former Minnesota Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, 
Los Angeles Dodgers bench coach Tim Wallach, Arizona Diamondbacks third 
base coach Andy Green, San Francisco Giants bench coach Ron Wotus, former 
Nationals player Alex Cora, and Triple-A Reno Aces manager Phil Nevin. 
From the group, Baker and Black emerged as finalists and received second 
interviews.[4] On October 28, The Washington Post reported Black would 
likely be hired as manager.[5] But according to reports that surfaced late 
on November 2 from, among others, the Post, CBS Sports, and USA Today, 
while Black was offered the job and accepted, a disagreement over contract 
terms led to negotiations between the Nationals and Black breaking down. 
The Nationals' initial offer to Black was reportedly one year guaranteed 
at $1.6 million, an offer Black considered a "lowball".[6] Unable to come 
to terms with Black, the Nationals' front office turned to its other leading 
choice, the more experienced Baker.[7] Early on November 3, the Nationals 
announced Baker had been hired to a two-year contract as manager.[8][9] 
Baker and management set to work immediately on hiring new coaches. Mike 
Maddux was announced as the Nationals' new pitching coach on November 4.[10] 
Davey Lopes was hired back to his former position as first base coach – 
a position he held in 2006 – the following day.[11] Rick Schu and Bob Henley 
were also rehired as hitting coach and third base coach respectively, positions 
they held under Williams as well.[12][13] The Nationals also hired former 
major league outfielder Jacque Jones to be Schu's assistant hitting coach 
and named former Montreal Expos shortstop Chris Speier as bench coach.[14][15] 
Mexican League manager and coach Dan Firova was brought on as bullpen coach.[16] 
The Nationals also faced several decisions about what to do with players 
set to reach free agency, as well as players who had 2016 options. On November 
2, the team announced it would decline options for right-handed reliever 
Casey Janssen and outfielder Nate McLouth, after Janssen struggled with 
injury and poor performance during the 2015 season and McLouth spent the 
entire year on the 60-day disabled list.[17] Janssen and McLouth joined 
utility infielder Emmanuel Burriss, shortstop Ian Desmond, starter-turned-reliever 
Doug Fister, outfielder Reed Johnson, center fielder Denard Span, left-handed 
reliever Matt Thornton, second baseman Dan Uggla, and starting pitcher 
Jordan Zimmermann in a sizable free agent class.[18][19][20] Qualifying 
offers worth $15.8 million apiece were extended to Desmond and Zimmermann,[21] 
although both rejected them, as expected.[22] Right-handed reliever David 
Carpenter also elected free agency after being outrighted from the Nationals' 
40-man roster on November 18, 2015.[23] On December 2, 2015, the Nationals 
announced they had not tendered a contract to right-handed reliever Craig 
Stammen, who was eligible for arbitration.[24] The Nationals bid for contracts 
with multiple top free agents during the off-season, including Yoenis Céspedes, 
Jason Heyward, Darren O'Day, Justin Upton, and Ben Zobrist, but lost out 
on them to other teams.[25][26][27] On November 9, 2015, the Nationals 
and the Houston Astros held a groundbreaking ceremony for The Ballpark 
of the Palm Beaches, a new spring training facility they will share in 
West Palm Beach, Florida. The new facility, which will provide each team 
with two major-league-size practice fields, four-minor-league-size practice 
fields, an agility field, a half field, batting cages, and pitching mounds, 
will center around a new baseball stadium with 6,400 ticketed seats and 
1,250 berm seats, and will place the Nationals far closer to other teams 
during spring training, facilitating travel for spring training games. 
The new facility is scheduled to open on January 15, 2017.[52] The Nationals 
held their 2016 spring training in Viera, Florida, with home games played 
at Space Coast Stadium. It was their last spring training in Viera before 
moving to the new facility.[53] The team's last game at Space Coast Stadium 
in Viera was a 7–2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on March 27, 2016. Its 
last scheduled game at Space Coast Stadium on March 28, 2016, was rained 
out, resulting in the cancellation of activities planned to commemorate 
the franchise's history there. The Nationals finished spring training in 
Viera with the best record in baseball, winning 18 games, losing four, 
and tying in three. They outscored their opponents by 81 runs in total.[54] 
After leaving Florida, the Nationals completed their spring training schedule 
with two exhibition games at Nationals Park at the beginning of April, 
a win and a tie against the Minnesota Twins. Including these two games, 
the Nationals completed their spring training schedule with a major-league-best 
record of 19–4–4. The Washington Nationals opened the regular season on 
April 4 with an away game at Turner Field, facing the division rival Atlanta 
Braves. Max Scherzer was their Opening Day starter for the second year 
in a row.[55] The Nationals took an early lead when right fielder Bryce 
Harper hit a solo home run off Atlanta starting pitcher Julio Teheran in 
the top of the first inning, but the Braves quickly answered with a solo 
home run of their own off the bat of first baseman Freddie Freeman in the 
bottom of the first. In the fourth inning, Nationals second baseman Daniel 
Murphy led off with another home run off Teheran, but once again, the Braves 
came back in the bottom of the same inning as third baseman Adonis Garcia 
homered off Scherzer with no one on base, tying the game at 2–2.[55] The 
deadlock held until the bottom of the eighth inning, when Washington relief 
pitcher Felipe Rivero loaded the bases with two out. He was relieved by 
Shawn Kelley, who walked in Jeff Francoeur from third base on four straight 
balls to Garcia, putting the Braves on top. But once again, the game was 
tied in the next frame as left fielder Jayson Werth scored on a one-out 
sacrifice fly by Michael A. Taylor, who took over in center field after 
Ben Revere left the game early, off Braves closer Jason Grilli. Nationals 
reliever Blake Treinen pitched around a leadoff walk in the bottom of the 
ninth inning to force extra innings.[55] First baseman Ryan Zimmerman reached 
and took second base on a throwing error by Braves second baseman Gordon 
Beckham in the top of the tenth inning, and then Murphy brought him around 
to score with a double that reached the left field corner, putting the 
Nationals on top 4–3.[55] Jonathan Papelbon came on to close out the game, 
retiring all three batters in order to pick up the save and secure an Opening 
Day win for Washington.[56] The Nationals got off to a fast start, sweeping 
the division rival Atlanta Braves in two series of six games total while 
riding out to a 9–1 win-loss mark, surpassing the start to the 1974 Montreal 
Expos season for the franchise best over the first 10 games of the season.[57] 
Right fielder and reigning National League MVP Bryce Harper hit his 100th 
career home run, also his first career grand slam, off Atlanta pitcher 
Julio Teherán on April 14.[58] He hit another grand slam off Miami Marlins 
pitcher Chris Narveson on April 19, amid a stretch in which the Nationals 
homered four times in one inning, another all-time high for the Montreal–Washington 
franchise;[59] the four home runs included left fielder Jayson Werth′s 
200th career home run and the 201st home run of first baseman Ryan Zimmerman′s 
career.[60][61] In total, Harper cracked nine home runs in April, tied 
for second-most in the National League behind Colorado Rockies shortstop 
Trevor Story and third baseman Nolan Arenado, who hit 10 apiece.[62][63] 
He also chalked up his first career pinch-hit home run, a game-tying solo 
blast in the ninth inning, off Minnesota Twins closer Kevin Jepsen on April 
24.[64] Harper was named the NL Player of the Month, the second time he 
received the honor.[65] Washington's pitching staff performed well over 
the course of the month, behind only the Chicago Cubs in team ERA.[66] 
Closer Jonathan Papelbon, acquired in July 2015, more than doubled his 
save total with the Nationals (seven in 2015),[67][68] notching eight saves 
during the month[69] to one blown save against his former team, the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[70] Starters Joe Ross and Stephen Strasburg were undefeated in 
games they started, with Ross credited with three wins—he left one other 
start on April 20 with a lead that was held by the bullpen, but the scorers 
awarded the win to long reliever Yusmeiro Petit since Ross exited the game 
early due to a finger blister[71]—and Strasburg earning four.[72] Reliever 
Óliver Pérez picked up the win in the Nationals' longest-ever regular season 
game, a 16-inning matchup with the Minnesota Twins at Nationals Park on 
April 24, after tying the game in the 15th with a bunt that was mishandled 
for a two-base throwing error by Twins catcher John Ryan Murphy and then 
pitching a shutout frame before right fielder Chris Heisey hit a solo home 
run for a walk-off win.[64][73] The Nationals struggled at times on offense, 
posting the third-worst batting average in the National League ahead of 
only the Braves and Milwaukee Brewers amid poor performances at the plate 
from center fielder Michael A. Taylor, left fielder Jayson Werth, and first 
baseman Ryan Zimmerman, despite strong hitting from Harper and second baseman 
Daniel Murphy, an off-season acquisition who hit in 12 straight games during 
the month[74] and had 11 multi-hit games.[75] The team also suffered injuries 
to regular players, with Ben Revere, acquired in the off-season to play 
center field, straining his oblique during his first at-bat of the season 
on April 4 and ending up on the disabled list, and reliever Matt Belisle, 
another off-season pickup, being placed on the disabled list after straining 
his calf while pitching on April 26. Outfielder Matt den Dekker and reliever 
Sammy Solis were called up from the Syracuse Chiefs, the Nationals' Class 
AAA International League affiliate, to replace them on the roster.[76][77] 
Amid an offensive lull and the injury to Belisle, Washington was swept 
at home late in the month by the division rival Phillies for their first 
series loss of the year.[78] In total, the Nationals finished April with 
a 16–7 record, the second-best win percentage in baseball behind the Cubs, 
and a half-game lead over the New York Mets, their closest rivals in the 
National League East.[79] On May 1, the Nationals completed their first-ever 
road sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, with Max Scherzer earning the win.[80] 
However, the Nationals were swept by the Chicago Cubs later on their Midwestern 
roadtrip in a four-game set. In the final game at Wrigley Field on May 
8, Nationals right fielder Bryce Harper walked six times and was hit by 
a pitch, setting a major league record with seven plate appearances and 
zero official at-bats in a single game.[81] On May 9, as Stephen Strasburg 
pitched at Nationals Park in a game against the Detroit Tigers, news broke 
that he had agreed to a long-term extension of his contract;[82] prior 
to the seven-year extension, Strasburg had been under team control for 
the final season in 2016 before he was due to become a free agent for the 
first time. Under the extension, signed and officially announced at a press 
conference at Nationals Park the following day and scheduled to begin in 
2017, the Nationals agreed to pay Strasburg $175 million, structured so 
that Strasburg would receive $15 million a year through the end of the 
contract in 2023, and another $10 million a year in deferred salary between 
2024 and 2030.[83] The contract also included incentive bonuses for Strasburg 
and opt-outs for him after three years and after four years.[83] The conventional 
wisdom among baseball analysts and journalists, and even among Strasburg′s 
close associates, had long been that Strasburg would pursue free agency 
after the conclusion of the 2016 season and end up playing on a team in 
his native Southern California, and the contract extension therefore came 
as a major surprise, but Strasburg cited his comfort with living in the 
Washington, D.C., area, his appreciation for the Nationals having demonstrated 
concern for his health and professional future with their controversial 
decision to shut him down during the 2012 season in order to protect his 
elbow from overuse during his recovery from Tommy John surgery, and his 
belief that the Nationals had years of success coming in the future as 
important factors in his decision.[82][83] The Nationals, Strasburg, and 
his agent Scott Boras soon revealed that the deal had been firmed up during 
the final week of April, but had been kept so quiet that even a day trip 
Strasburg made from St. Louis to Washington on April 30 to undergo a physical 
required before signing the contract while the Nationals were playing a 
road series against the St. Louis Cardinals went unnoticed by the baseball 
world and the press.[82] In the ninth inning of the May 9 game, which the 
Nationals won 5–4, Harper was ejected by home plate umpire Brian Knight 
after Knight took umbrage with the Nationals dugout's reaction to a called 
strike three on shortstop Danny Espinosa. Harper, clearly incensed by the 
ejection, ran onto the field with his teammates after pinch-hitter Clint 
Robinson hit a walkoff home run during the next at-bat, pointing at Knight 
and yelling, "Hey, fuck you," before joining the celebration at home plate. 
Asked if he thought he would be fined for the outburst after the game, 
Harper replied, "If I do, I do. I'll pay it. ... Maybe he'll get fined, 
too."[84][85] Harper was given a fine and a one-game suspension by Major 
League Baseball,[86] which Harper served on May 14 after dropping an appeal 
of the decision.[87] In a 3–2 victory over the Tigers at Nationals Park 
on May 11, Max Scherzer struck out 20 in the course of pitching a six-hit 
complete game, tying the Major League Baseball record for strikeouts in 
a nine-inning game and becoming only the third player in Major League Baseball 
history to do so.[88][89][90] Through six innings, he threw 77 pitches, 
62 of which were strikes. He set a new Nationals Park record for strikeouts 
in single game when he struck out Detroit shortstop José Iglesias for his 
16th strikeout, set a new personal record in the next at-bat when he struck 
out pinch-hitter Jarrod Saltalamacchia for his 17th,[91][92] and in the 
at-bat after that he ended the inning by striking out second baseman Ian 
Kinsler for his 18th, tying the Montreal-Washington franchise′s single-game 
record.[93] Scherzer entered the ninth inning having thrown 106 pitches. 
He gave up a solo home run to right fielder J. D. Martinez on the first 
pitch of the inning, but in the next at-bat he struck out third baseman 
Miguel Cabrera to set a new Montreal-Washington franchise record with 19 
strikeouts. After giving up a single to first baseman Víctor Martinez – 
the only Tiger who made a plate appearance that he did not strike out during 
the game – he struck out left fielder Justin Upton on three pitches for 
his 20th and final strikeout.[88][89] It was only the fourth time in Major 
League Baseball history that a pitcher had struck out 20 batters in a nine-inning 
game, and only the sixth time a pitcher had struck out at least 20 batters 
in any game.[94] Although Scherzer gave up more hits and more runs than 
any previous pitcher who had struck out 20 batters in nine innings, he 
did not issue any walks, and of the 119 pitches he threw, 96 were strikes, 
the first time a pitcher had thrown 96 strikes in a major-league game since 
2013; taking into account both the number of strikes thrown and the ratio 
of strikes to balls, it was the greatest number of strikes thrown in the 
fewest number of pitches in Major League Baseball history.[91][95] On May 
13, in a 5–3 victory over the Miami Marlins at Nationals Park, Stephen 
Drew and Chris Heisey both hit pinch-hit home runs. It was the first time 
in team history that the Nationals had two pinch-hit home runs in the same 
game.[96] The two home runs made the Nationals second in Major League Baseball 
in pinch-hit home runs on the season with six in 35 games, three of them 
by Heisey.[96] The Nats had had only five pinch-hit home runs during the 
entire previous season.[97] Between games of a doubleheader against the 
Marlins on May 14, the Nationals announced that they had exercised their 
two-year option on the contract of general manager Mike Rizzo, ensuring 
that Rizzo would remain with the club through the 2018 season. The option 
reportedly paid Rizzo $2.5 million annually.[98] The Nationals split series 
with the division rival New York Mets during the month, taking two out 
of three at Citi Field in Queens[99] but dropping two out of three at Nationals 
Park.[100] In both series, Mets starting pitcher Matt Harvey suffered a 
loss, leading to consternation in New York over the staff ace's decline 
in performance.[99][101] On May 26, Nationals manager Dusty Baker won his 
1,700th game as a manager as the Nationals defeated the Cardinals at Nationals 
Park.[102] Three days later, Strasburg improved to 9–0 for the season with 
a win over the Cardinals on May 29, setting a record for the Montreal–Washington 
franchise of 12 consecutive decisions won dating back to the 2015 season.[103] 
Daniel Murphy, the Nationals' starting second baseman, tied a franchise 
record for hits in a month with 47, including seven home runs.[104] Murphy 
was named the National League Player of the Month, the first time since 
2009 that two teammates had received the honor in back-to-back months following 
Harper's award for April.[105] The Nationals finished with a 16–14 record 
on the month and a season win-loss mark of 32–21, with a two-game lead 
over the Mets in the National League East.[106] The Nationals started the 
month strong, despite losing two out of three in a series with the Cincinnati 
Reds at Great American Ball Park early in the month.[107] They won series 
against the division rival Philadelphia Phillies,[108] the Chicago White 
Sox in interleague play,[109] and the National League-leading Chicago Cubs[110] 
before embarking on a three-series roadtrip. Both the Phillies and Cubs 
series were capped by walk-off hits authored by left fielder Jayson Werth, 
who singled home Bryce Harper and Danny Espinosa to defeat the Phillies 
on June 12[108] and drove in Michael A. Taylor in an extra-innings victory 
over the Cubs on June 15.[110] Earlier in the Phillies series, in a 9–6 
victory on June 10, Stephen Strasburg was credited with a win to go 10–0 
on the season. He became the first National League pitcher to open a season 
at 10–0 since Juan Agosto did it for the Houston Astros in 1988 and the 
first National League starting pitcher to do it since Andy Hawkins started 
11–0 for the San Diego Padres in 1985.[111] After their 9–4 start to the 
month, the Nationals visited the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers 
in Southern California and then finished their roadtrip against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. Although the Nationals took the first two games of a four-game 
set from the Padres, they suffered a string of seven consecutive losses 
thereafter, splitting the series with the Padres, being swept by the Dodgers, 
and losing two of three to the Brewers.[112] The losing streak was the 
Nationals' longest since their 2009 season, in which they finished with 
the worst record in Major League Baseball, 59–103.[113] Compounding the 
Nationals' late-June problems, Strasburg was placed on the disabled list 
with a back strain after missing two starts late in the month. Right-handed 
starting pitcher Lucas Giolito, the Nationals' top prospect and the #1-rated 
pitching prospect in all of baseball, was called up to replace him on the 
roster. Giolito made his first start June 28 against the New York Mets 
at Nationals Park, pitching four scoreless innings and allowing just one 
hit before a rainstorm delayed the game and prompted manager Dusty Baker 
to go to the bullpen when play resumed. The Nationals shut out the Mets 
5–0, with the win awarded to Óliver Pérez in relief.[114] The June 28 win 
over the Mets was part of a string of five wins to end the Nationals' month. 
On June 30, Washington starter Gio González snapped a streak of six losing 
decisions with a 13–4 win over the Reds at Nationals Park. Espinosa, a 
switch-hitter, also became the first National to hit a home run while batting 
both left- and right-handed during the June 30 game.[115] The Nationals 
finished the month leading the National League East by six games over the 
Mets and six and a half games over the Miami Marlins. They posted a 16–11 
win-loss record for June.[116] Stephen Strasburg was reactivated from the 
disabled list minutes before gametime[117] on July 3 and proceeded to pitch 
6⅔ innings without allowing a hit to the Cincinnati Reds before manager 
Dusty Baker took him out of the game with a runner on third base and a 
pitch count in the triple digits.[118] Strasburg earned the win in the 
12–1 Nationals victory, raising his record to 11–0[119] and becoming only 
the fourth pitcher in the past 75 years with as good a win-loss mark through 
his first 15 starts.[120] The Nationals hit six home runs in the game, 
their highest mark of the season.[121] The Nationals placed starting pitcher 
Joe Ross on the disabled list with shoulder inflammation on July 3[122] 
and first baseman Ryan Zimmerman on the disabled list on July 8 with a 
ribcage strain. Infielder/outfielder Trea Turner was called up on July 
8 to take Zimmerman's place on the roster.[123] Pitching in his second 
start since returning from the disabled list on July 8, Strasburg picked 
up the win over the New York Mets in a 3–1 game to improve to 12–0 heading 
into the All-Star Break, becoming the first National League pitcher since 
Rube Marquard in 1912 to go 12–0 to start the season.[124][125] The Nationals 
took three games out of four from the Mets in the series at Citi Field 
to head into the All-Star Break with a 54–36 record and a six-game lead 
over both the Mets and the Miami Marlins in the NL East.[126] Right-handed 
pitching prospect Reynaldo López was called up from the Class-AA Harrisburg 
Senators to make his major league debut with a start on July 19 against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers at Nationals Park. During the game, López gave 
up a lead-off home run to Chase Utley, allowed three runs in the first 
inning, and gave up hits to seven of the first 11 batters he faced.[127] 
After that, he improved considerably, retiring eight batters in a row at 
one point, striking out six of them.[127] After he allowed three batters 
to reach base and gave up two more runs in the fifth inning, he was relieved.[127] 
He left the game having pitched 4⅔ innings, throwing 105 pitches (65 for 
strikes), giving up six runs (all earned) on 10 hits (including one home 
run), and walking one but striking out nine.[128][129] The Nationals lost 
the game 8–4, and he was the game's losing pitcher.[128][129] His nine 
strikeouts was the second-highest strikeout total for a Nationals pitcher 
during a major league debut,[127] exceeded only by Stephen Strasburg's 
14 strikeouts on June 8, 2010.[130] Although he ended up taking the loss 
in the game, López left the field to a standing ovation by fans.[131] Also 
debuting against the Dodgers was Koda Glover, a relief pitcher drafted 
in 2015 who had been promoted all the way up to the Class-AAA Syracuse 
Chiefs. The right-hander threw a perfect inning in relief on July 20, needing 
just four pitches to get three outs and seal an 8–1 Nationals win.[132] 
The Dodgers handed Strasburg a loss, his first of the season, on July 21. 
The loss snapped a string of 16 winning decisions for the Nationals pitcher,[133] 
who finished the month at 14–1 after recording a win over the Cleveland 
Indians, pitching seven scoreless innings in interleague play at Progressive 
Field, on July 27.[134] Also during the series in Cleveland, Zimmerman 
was activated from the disabled list on July 26, with outfielder Michael 
A. Taylor being optioned to Syracuse to make room for him on the roster,[135] 
while infielder Stephen Drew landed on the disabled list with vertigo-like 
symptoms and was replaced on the roster by Wilmer Difo, a Senators infielder, 
the following day.[136] The Nationals also lost catcher José Lobatón to 
injury, as he was placed on the disabled list on July 29 with tendinitis 
in his left elbow. Pedro Severino was recalled from Syracuse to take Lobatón's 
place as the Nationals' backup catcher.[137] Zimmerman was injured again 
just days after coming off the disabled list when he was hit on the wrist 
by a fastball thrown by San Francisco Giants closer Santiago Casilla on 
July 31.[138] The Nationals announced a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
on July 30, swapping left-handed reliever Felipe Rivero and minor league 
pitcher Taylor Hearn to the Pirates in exchange for right-handed reliever 
Mark Melancon and cash considerations.[139][140] The Washington Post reported 
that erstwhile closer Jonathan Papelbon had agreed to cede ninth-inning 
duties to Melancon and take up a different role out of the Nationals' bullpen.[141] 
July ended with consecutive split series for the Nationals on the road 
while visiting the Indians and the Giants, coming on the back of two straight 
series losses at the hands of the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres at home. 
The team went 7–8 after the All-Star Break to finish July with a 61–44 
record and a four-game lead in the National League East over the Miami 
Marlins.[142] Strasburg was honored as NL Pitcher of the Month, while infielder 
Daniel Murphy received his second NL Player of the Month award of the season 
for hitting .372 with 26 RBIs over 24 games in the month.[143] The Nationals 
set a year-to-date team record for hits and runs scored in a rout of the 
Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field in Phoenix on August 1. All nine Nationals 
starters had at least one hit, and all but starting pitcher Stephen Strasburg 
scored at least one run, in a 19-hit effort for the visitors, who defeated 
the Diamondbacks 14–1. Newly acquired closer Mark Melancon made his debut 
with the team, although it was not a save situation, and retired all three 
batters he faced.[144][145] The Nationals ultimately swept the Diamondbacks 
on the road for the first time since the franchise moved to Washington, 
D.C., in 2005.[146][147] First baseman Ryan Zimmerman returned to the disabled 
list on August 6, having missed several games after being hit by a pitch 
on the wrist. Outfielder Brian Goodwin was called up to the major leagues 
for the first time to replace him on the Nationals' 25-man roster.[148] 
He made his debut that evening, going 0-for-1 with a deep flyout to right 
field in a loss versus the San Francisco Giants at Nationals Park.[149] 
Melancon secured his first save as a National on August 7 over the Giants, 
improving his season record to 31-for-33 in save opportunities.[150] Less 
than a week later, on August 13, the Nationals released reliever Jonathan 
Papelbon (whom Melancon had replaced as the team's closer) from his contract.[151] 
Rookie starting pitcher Reynaldo López, who temporarily replaced Papelbon 
on the roster, earned his first major league win that day over the Atlanta 
Braves in a tight 7–6 game, giving up one run over seven innings pitched.[152] 
The Nationals placed left-handed reliever Sammy Solis and right-handed 
starting pitcher Stephen Strasburg on the disabled list during the month. 
Solis was placed on the disabled list with shoulder inflammation on August 
17, and Koda Glover was called up to replace him.[153] The rookie reliever 
notched his first career win on August 19, also against the Braves; Glover 
gave up the lead in the eighth inning on a two-run double by Freddie Freeman 
but was credited with the win after the Nationals scored in the top of 
the ninth and Melancon closed out the game.[154] On August 22, Strasburg 
was placed on the disabled list with elbow soreness after a string of poor 
starts, and A. J. Cole was called up from the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs 
to replace him in the rotation.[155] Left fielder Jayson Werth tied the 
Montreal–Washington franchise record for consecutive games reaching base 
safely at 46,[156] before the streak was snapped by the Braves on August 
19. The streak had begun nearly two months prior, on June 20 against the 
Los Angeles Dodgers. During the streak, he tallied 43 hits and 32 walks.[157] 
In another milestone for a Nationals player, second baseman Daniel Murphy 
hit his first career grand slam off Parker Bridwell in a 10–8 loss to the 
Baltimore Orioles on August 24.[158] The Nationals made another trade for 
a reliever after Oakland Athletics left-hander Marc Rzepczynski was waived 
by his ballclub. Oakland agreed to swap Rzepczynski and cash considerations 
to the Nationals in exchange for minor league second baseman Max Schrock. 
The two teams announced the deal on August 25.[159] Rzepczynski made his 
Nationals debut on August 26, striking out Gerardo Parra of the Colorado 
Rockies before hitting Charlie Blackmon with a pitch, after which he was 
lifted from the game.[160] The Nationals won the August 26 game 8–5, giving 
starting pitcher Gio Gonzalez his 100th career win.[161] The Nationals 
closed out August by playing 20 games in 20 days without an off-day, a 
stretch over which they went 11–9,[162] winning two series against the 
division rival Braves,[163][164] dropping two series to the Rockies,[165] 
losing a home-and-home series to the Orioles in interleague play,[166] 
and finishing with a sweep of the division rival Philadelphia Phillies 
at Citizens Bank Park.[167] They finished the month nine games ahead of 
the second-place New York Mets and 11 games ahead of the third-place Miami 
Marlins in the National League East, boasting a 78–55 win-loss record: 
the second-best in the NL, behind only the Chicago Cubs, and the third-best 
in the major leagues, behind the Cubs and Texas Rangers.[168] After center 
fielder Trea Turner posted a .357 batting average and .571 slugging percentage 
for the month of August, he was named the NL Rookie of the Month.[169] 
After rosters expanded at the start of the month, the Nationals made their 
initial round of callups on September 2. The team recalled Syracuse Chiefs 
pitchers Trevor Gott, Matt Grace, and Rafael Martin, catcher Pedro Severino, 
and outfielder Brian Goodwin. They also purchased the contracts of Chiefs 
pitchers Sean Burnett and Mat Latos. Outfielder Matt den Dekker was designated 
for assignment[170] and outrighted to Syracuse after clearing waivers.[171] 
The Nationals also called up Chiefs pitcher Reynaldo López on September 
4,[172] followed by Chiefs pitcher Lucas Giolito and Harrisburg Senators 
infielder Wilmer Difo on September 6.[173] Rookie starting pitcher A. J. 
Cole got his first career win on September 2, outdueling Noah Syndergaard 
of the division rival New York Mets at Citi Field in a 4–1 contest.[174] 
The Nationals went on to lose the series in Queens, dropping the next two 
games, but in the first game of their next homestand on September 5, they 
eliminated the rival Atlanta Braves, in last place in the National League 
East, from division contention by defeating them 6–4.[175] Right-hander 
Stephen Strasburg was activated from the disabled list to make a start 
on September 7 versus the Braves, but his return was short-lived, as he 
was lifted from the game in the third inning after experiencing discomfort 
while pitching.[176] The team announced the next day that he had been diagnosed 
with a flexor mass strain and would miss an unspecified amount of time.[177] 
Joe Ross also returned from the disabled list to make a start on September 
18, with prospect Chris Bostick being designated for assignment to make 
room for him on the roster.[178] On September 6, third baseman Anthony 
Rendon hit his first career grand slam off Braves pitcher Williams Pérez, 
putting the Nationals on top in a game they went on to win 9–7.[179] On 
September 9, rookie center fielder Trea Turner posted his first multi-homer 
game, hitting a two-run shot followed by a solo home run to walk off the 
division rival Philadelphia Phillies 5–4.[180] Latos, making his first 
start for the Nationals in a September 12 game against the Mets, became 
the first Nationals pitcher since 2014 to hit a home run,[181] contributing 
in an 8–1 victory over New York with his solo home run off Mets starter 
Rafael Montero.[182] In the Nationals' final game of the season against 
their New York rivals on September 14, a 1–0 win, second baseman Daniel 
Murphy went 1-for-2 with a walk, thereby recording at least one hit in 
every game he played against the team he was with during the previous season.[183] 
He became the first National League player in 12 years to hit in every 
game of a season series of at least 19 games[184] and set a record for 
the longest single-season hitting streak against a previous-year team dating 
back to the creation of divisions in the major leagues in 1969.[185] As 
the Nationals closed in on the division championship, they were beset by 
a buttocks strain that took Murphy out of the lineup beginning September 
18,[186][187] as well as a forearm injury that sidelined right-handed reliever 
Matt Belisle beginning September 8,[188] and lost back-to-back series against 
the division rival Braves and Miami Marlins on the road. In the latter 
series, on September 20, the team faced Marlins ace José Fernández in what 
would ultimately be his last pitching performance before his death in an 
accident five days later. The Nationals were shut out for the first time 
since the All-Star Break, with Fernández pitching eight innings while giving 
up just three hits, walking none, and striking out twelve in a winning 
performance.[189] The Nationals finally clinched the division title on 
September 24, as they defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–1 behind a short 
start by Ross and a long relief appearance by López, and the second-place 
Mets went down to defeat at the hands of the Phillies.[190] Injuries put 
holes in the Nationals' starting lineup in the games after they clinched 
the division. Right fielder Bryce Harper was injured in a September 25 
game against the Pirates, jamming his thumb when Pirates third baseman 
Jung Ho Kang faked a tag that prompted him to make a late slide into third. 
Nationals manager Dusty Baker took exception to the play, and when Kang 
next came up to bat, Cole threw a ball behind his back and was ejected 
from the game, leading to a benches-clearing altercation on the field. 
Cole denied the pitch was intentional, saying, "The ball was getting away 
from me a little bit, and that one got away from me." He was suspended 
five games over the incident and fined, a verdict which he appealed.[191] 
In the following game, a rain-soaked September 26 matchup with the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, catcher Wilson Ramos tore the anterior cruciate ligament 
in his right knee for the second time after making a leaping catch on a 
relay from first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, forcing him to undergo season-ending 
surgery. Spencer Kieboom was called up from Harrisburg to replace him on 
the roster.[192] However, the team also received some bullpen reinforcements 
as Belisle returned from his injury layoff to pitch against the Pirates 
in the September 25 game[188] while left-handed reliever Sammy Solis was 
activated off the disabled list on September 26[193] and pitched a perfect 
inning in a 4–2 win over the Diamondbacks the following day.[194] Starting 
at second base for the Nationals, Difo recorded his first home run in a 
5–3 win over the Diamondbacks on September 29, launching a pitch from left-hander 
Robbie Ray into the seats in left field at Nationals Park.[195] With the 
win, the Nationals split the four-game series with Arizona, the last complete 
series of September and the penultimate series in their 2016 regular season.[196] 
The team finished September with a 93–67 regular season record and a seven-game 
lead over the Mets, who clinched a wild card berth after being eliminated 
from division contention.[197] The Nationals won both games they played 
to end the regular season in October, earning a win in a three-game series 
and sealing the season series against the division rival Miami Marlins. 
Second baseman Daniel Murphy was in a narrow race with the Colorado Rockies' 
DJ LeMahieu for the batting title until the last day of the season, but 
with Murphy injured and LeMahieu not playing in order to preserve his small 
edge,[198] the race came down to a pinch-hit opportunity for Murphy against 
Miami on October 2, in which the National flied out to right to finish 
a little more than a point below LeMahieu.[199] Nationals pitchers grabbed 
much of the attention as the season came to an end. On October 1, rookie 
starting pitcher A. J. Cole dropped his appeal of a five-game suspension 
handed down by the league for intentionally throwing at a batter the previous 
month, with the suspension expected to carry over into the 2017 season.[200] 
The same day, starter Tanner Roark posted his career-best 16th win of the 
regular season, defeating Wei-Yin Chen and the Marlins 2–1.[201] On October 
2, the last day of the regular season, staff ace Max Scherzer earned his 
20th win, although he gave up five runs in a seesaw 10–7 victory over the 
Marlins;[199] he also notched four runs batted in during the game, going 
2-for-2, for the first time in his career.[202] Closer Mark Melancon finished 
his year with 47 saves, the second-highest season total of his career.[199] 
Catching prospect Spencer Kieboom, meanwhile, made his major league debut 
on October 2, drawing a walk from Marlins reliever Brian Ellington as a 
pinch-hitter and then coming around to score later in the inning.[203] 
Trea Turner, the Nationals' center fielder and occasional second baseman 
and shortstop, was named Rookie of the Month in the National League for 
the second consecutive month. He hit .339 with eight home runs and 15 stolen 
bases over September and the first two days of October.[204] The Nationals 
drew 2,481,938 fans at Nationals Park during 2016, their fifth-highest 
attendance since arriving in Washington in 2005. It placed them seventh 
in attendance for the season among the 15 National League teams.[215] 5:38 p.m. 
(EDT) at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Plans called for retired pitcher 
and former National Liván Hernández to throw out the ceremonial first pitch, 
but after Hurricane Matthew′s effects on Florida made it impossible for 
Hernández to fly to Washington, the Nationals surprised the fans at Nationals 
Park by having Nationals starting catcher Wilson Ramos – whose season had 
ended with a knee injury on September 26 – throw it instead, to a huge 
roar from the crowd.[216] The game provided an historic first: When Dusty 
Baker and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts exchanged line-up cards 
before the game, it became the first postseason game in the Major League 
Baseball history in which two African-American managers faced one another.[217] 
The game was billed as a marquee match-up between two of the best starting 
pitchers in Major League Baseball, Clayton Kershaw for the Dodgers and 
Max Scherzer for the Nationals, but neither starter was particularly sharp. 
Pitching to rookie Nationals catcher Pedro Severino, Scherzer gave up a 
solo home run – the 32nd homer he had given up in 2016 – to the second 
batter he faced, Dodgers rookie shortstop Corey Seager, on his sixth pitch 
of the game. In the third inning, after Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley 
drove in left fielder Andrew Toles with an RBI single, Scherzer gave up 
his 33rd home run of the year, a two-run shot to Dodgers third baseman 
Justin Turner, giving Los Angeles a 4–0 lead. The Dodgers did not score 
again; Scherzer did not allow another run before left the game after six 
innings, and the Nationals bullpen also held them scoreless.[218] Kershaw 
pitched five innings and held on to the lead, but the Nationals repeatedly 
pushed him to the brink, and his frequent discussions on the mound with 
Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal incited a chorus of boos from the crowd.[219] 
In the second inning, with two Nationals on base after Daniel Murphy and 
Ryan Zimmerman singled and Anthony Rendon reached first on a fielder's 
choice, Danny Espinosa – batting seventh instead of a probable eighth due 
to Ramos′s unavailability – struck out for the second out. A Dodgers error 
then allowed Severino to reach first base and load the bases, but Scherzer 
popped out to end the inning without the Nationals scoring a run. In the 
third inning, Rendon singled to drive in two runs as part of what promised 
to be a big inning, cutting the Dodgers′ lead to 4-2, but Espinosa struck 
out to end the inning with two men on base. Severino doubled in the fourth 
and scored on a sacrifice fly by Trea Turner to reduce the Dodgers′ lead 
to 4–3, but in the fifth, with Jayson Werth and Rendon on base, Espinosa 
again struck out to end the inning. Although he provided his typically 
reliable defense in the field during the game, Espinosa′s strikeouts had 
left six men on base and brought three rallies to an end.[218] Kershaw 
left the game after five innings and 101 pitches,[219] having given up 
three runs, all earned, on eight hits and a walk with seven strikeouts. 
The Los Angeles bullpen followed with four innings of shut-out ball, but 
the Nationals had ample opportunities to tie the game. Trea Turner, a prolific 
base-stealer, walked in the sixth inning but was stranded at first. In 
the seventh inning, Murphy walked with one out, but then got a poor jump 
in an attempt to steal second and was thrown out. In the eighth, Clint 
Robinson doubled in the first postseason plate appearance of his career 
and speedy Michael A. Taylor entered the game to pinch-run for him, but 
Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen struck out pinch-hitter Chris Heisey on a 
called third strike to end the inning. It was the Nationals' last scoring 
threat; they had the tying run on base in four of the game′s last five 
innings without being able to score a single run, and left a total of nine 
men on base during the game. The Dodgers won 4–3 to take a 1–0 lead in 
the series.[218] 1:08 p.m. (EDT) at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. 
Originally scheduled to begin at 4:08 p.m. EDT on October 8, Game 2 was 
postponed due to rain and rescheduled for 1:08 p.m. EDT on October 9.[220] 
Retired first baseman and former National Adam LaRoche threw out the ceremonial 
first pitch, tossing it to his son Drake, who spent a great deal of time 
with the Nationals during his father′s years on the team.[221][222] Game 
2 began much as Game 1 had: Washington′s starting pitcher – Tanner Roark, 
starting Game 2 because Stephen Strasburg remained sidelined with an injury 
– struggled; for the second game in a row, Los Angeles shortstop Corey 
Seager hit a first-inning solo home run in the Dodgers′ second at-bat of 
the game; and the Dodgers′ starter, Rich Hill, struck out the side in the 
bottom of the first, as Clayton Kershaw had in Game 1.[223] The Nationals, 
meanwhile, again missed a chance at a big inning when reserve catcher José 
Lobatón, starting in the postseason due to the unavailability of the injured 
Wilson Ramos, hit into a double play with the bases loaded to end the second 
inning.[224] The Dodgers added another run in the third inning on an RBI 
single by right fielder Josh Reddick; Bryce Harper made a good throw to 
the plate from right field, but Lobatón was unable to tag Dodgers third 
baseman Justin Turner out at home.[223] Dodgers starter Rich Hill used 
his curveball very effectively for 3⅔ innings, and Los Angeles held a 2-0 
lead in the bottom of the third when Lobatón came to bat again with two 
outs and Daniel Murphy and Danny Espinosa on base. Lobatón hit only the 
second postseason home run of his career,[224][note 1] and only the second 
postseason homer by a catcher in the history of the Montreal-Washington 
franchise,[222][note 2] driving in Murphy and Espinosa to give the Nationals 
a 3-2 lead, the first time they had taken the lead in the series.[224] 
Although Roark had an uncharacteristically unsteady outing, the Dodgers 
were 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position during the first five innings 
even though they had the bases loaded with one out three times,[222] at 
least in part thanks to good Nationals defensive plays, notably by left 
fielder Jayson Werth.[224] A tiring Roark left the game in the fifth inning 
– after 4⅓ innings pitched and 85 pitches – with two Dodgers on base and 
Washington still holding a 3-2 lead. After that, Washington′s bullpen – 
a postseason weakness for the 2012 and 2014 teams – held the Dodgers scoreless; 
Marc Rzepczynski, Sammy Solis, Blake Treinen, Óliver Pérez, and Mark Melancon 
combined to give up only three walks (all by Rzepczynski) and one hit (a 
single yielded by Melancon) in the game′s remaining 4⅔ innings, striking 
out five Dodgers.[224][222] The Dodgers were 1-for-9 with runners in scoring 
position during the game,[222] and by the end of the game, the Nationals′ 
bullpen had pitched 7⅔ innings in the series without giving up a run.[225] 
Meanwhile, Murphy – who went 3-for-3 and scored a run, pushing his offensive 
output for the series′ first two games to 4-for-6 with two walks[226] – 
drove in runs with singles in the fifth and seventh innings as Nationals 
fans in the crowd chanted ""MVP! MVP!"[226] The Nationals went 4-for-8 
with runners in scoring position, a turnaround from their previous postseason 
performance: From Game 5 of the 2012 National League Division Series until 
Lobatón′s homer in the third inning, they had gone only 3-for-35 in the 
postseason with runners in scoring position.[224] Washington won 5-2 to 
even the series at 1-1.[224] It was the first come-from-behind postseason 
win for a Washington, D.C., Major League Baseball team since the Washington 
Senators came from behind to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-3 in Game 3 
of the 1925 World Series 91 years earlier on October 10, 1925.[222] It 
also was the Nationals′ first postseason victory at home since a 2-1 win 
over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 4 of the 2012 National League Division 
Series on October 11, 2012. 4:08 p.m. (EDT) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, 
California The Nationals put pressure on Dodgers starter Kenta Maeda from 
the outset, loading the bases in the first inning on a single and two walks; 
although they did not score, they forced him to throw 28 pitches. In the 
Dodgers′ half of the first, Nationals starter Gio Gonzalez – who had a 
set a goal for himself of pitching late into the game - walked Los Angeles 
third baseman Justin Turner; Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager then staked 
the Dodgers to a 1-0 lead in the first inning, as he had in both previous 
games of the series, this time with an RBI double that drove in Turner.[227] 
The Nationals' offense erupted in the third inning. Center fielder Trea 
Turner singled, then scored to tie the game at 1-1 when left fielder Jayson 
Werth doubled. Right fielder Bryce Harper then singled, scoring Werth to 
give the Nats a 2-1 lead, and third baseman Anthony Rendon followed that 
with a 432-foot (132-meter), two-run home run into the left field seats, 
putting Washington ahead 4-1. Maeda left the game after the inning, having 
thrown 68 pitches.[227] After the Dodgers scored their first-inning run, 
Gio Gonzalez retired 11 of the next 12 batters he faced. However, throwing 
his 83rd pitch of the game with one out in the fifth inning, he gave up 
a two-run homer to Dodgers pinch-hitter Carlos Ruiz that narrowed the Nationals′ 
lead to 4-3. Nationals manager Dusty Baker immediately took Gonzalez out 
of the game, and, for the second consecutive game, Nationals relievers 
had to pitch the final 4⅔ innings. Sammy Solis relieved Gonzalez and pitched 
1⅔ innings, followed by Óliver Pérez for a third of an inning and Shawn 
Kelley for 1⅔ innings, all scoreless; Kelley retired all five Dodgers he 
faced, striking out three of them. The Dodgers′ bullpen also shut the Nationals 
out through the eighth inning, and Washington still clung to a 4-3 lead 
going into the ninth.[227] Los Angeles closer Kenley Jansen came in to 
pitch the ninth inning, hoping to hold the score at 4-3 and give the Dodgers 
a chance to tie or win the game in the bottom of the inning. But Jayson 
Werth led off with a 450-foot (137-meter) home run into the left-field 
stands that quieted the crowd and gave the Nationals an important insurance 
run. Jansen then walked second baseman Daniel Murphy and hit Harper with 
a pitch and, after Rendon popped out, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman doubled 
off the right field wall, scoring both Murphy and Harper and knocking Jansen 
out of the game. By the time Washington pinch hitter Chris Heisey came 
to bat with a 7-3 lead, many Dodger fans were leaving the stadium; Heisey 
capped the inning by scoring Zimmerman with a sacrifice fly to make the 
score 8-3. Nationals closer Mark Melancon then pitched a perfect ninth 
to seal the victory, completing 4⅔ scoreless innings by the Nationals′ 
bullpen; in the series thus far, Nationals relievers had pitched 12⅓ innings 
without yielding a single run, striking out 14 Dodgers.[227][228] By the 
end of the game, Zimmerman was hitting .455 in the series, while Werth 
was hitting .417 and Murphy .400.[228] The win gave the Nationals a 2-1 
lead in the series, their first lead in a post-season series since the 
first game of the 2012 National League Division Series.[227] 5:08 p.m. 
(EDT) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California Facing elimination, 
the Dodgers opted to have their ace starter Clayton Kershaw pitch again 
on only three days′ rest. In the top of the first inning, the Nationals 
pressed him, with center fielder Trea Turner leading off with a walk and 
right fielder Bryce Harper following with a single, after which second 
baseman Daniel Murphy drove in Turner with an RBI single to give the Nationals 
a run in the first inning for the first time in the series. Nationals starter 
Joe Ross, however, had a rough first inning himself, hitting Los Angeles 
third baseman Justin Turner with a pitch and giving up a two-run homer 
to first baseman Adrian Gonzalez.[229] With a 2-1 lead, Kershaw then settled 
down, allowing Washington to tie the game at 2-2 in the top of the third 
with singles by Trea Turner and left fielder Jayson Werth and a sacrifice 
fly by Murphy that drove in Turner, but otherwise keeping the Nationals 
scoreless until the seventh inning. Ross, meanwhile, struggled. In the 
bottom of the third inning, he gave up a lead-off double to Kershaw; after 
keeping Kershaw at second and recording two outs, he allowed a single by 
Justin Turner that scored Kershaw, walked Adrian Gonzalez and right fielder 
Josh Reddick to load the bases, and then hit center fielder Joc Pederson 
with a pitch, forcing Justin Turner home from third. Ross left the game 
with the Dodgers leading 4-2, having thrown 55 pitches in 2⅔ innings, giving 
up four runs, all earned, on three hits and two walks, and striking out 
three.[229] The Nationals bullpen faced another long outing. They stretched 
their streak of scoreless innings in the series to 14⅓, but with two outs 
in the bottom of the fifth inning, Reynaldo López became the first Washington 
reliever to give up a run in the series when Reddick singled and Pederson 
drove him in with an RBI double, giving Los Angeles a 5-2 lead.[229] The 
Nationals′ offense, meanwhile, finally got to Kershaw, staging a comeback 
in the top of the seventh inning. Shortstop Danny Espinosa, who had gone 
0-for-10 with nine strikeouts in the series, singled for his first hit 
of the 2016 postseason. He was still on first with two outs when Trea Turner 
singled and Harper walked to load the bases, driving Kershaw out of the 
game after throwing 110 pitches. Dodgers reliever Pedro Baez then hit Werth 
with a pitch to force Espinosa home, and Los Angeles reliever Luis Avilán 
gave up a single to Murphy that scored Turner and Harper, tying the game 
at 5-5, with all five Nationals runs charged to Kershaw.[229] Kershaw′s 
day ended with a 6.17 ERA in his two outings against the Nats.[230] Pitching 
the bottom of the eighth for Washington, Blake Treinen got the first two 
outs, but then hit Dodgers left fielder Andrew Toles with a pitch and gave 
up a single to pinch-hitter Andre Ethier, followed by a single by second 
baseman Chase Utley that drove in Toles to give the Dodgers a 6-5 lead. 
Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen secured the Dodgers′ victory with a perfect 
ninth in which he struck out two Nats, and Los Angeles tied the series 
at 2-2 to force a decisive Game 5 two nights later.[229] Daniel Murphy′s 
2-for-3 performance in the game pushed his postseason average for 2016 
to .462, and his four RBIs set a new Montreal-Washington franchise record 
for RBIs by a single player in a postseason game.[229][231] At the end 
of the game, the Nationals′ bullpen ERA for the series stood at 1.02, with 
only two runs given up in 17⅔ innings of work.[229] Washington′s starters, 
in contrast, had pitched only 16⅓ innings and given up 13 runs, with a 
7.16 ERA for the series.[229] When Blake Treinen hit Andrew Toles with 
a pitch in the bottom of the eighth inning, it set two new Major League 
Baseball records: It was the first time in history that one team′s pitchers 
hit four batters with pitches in a single postseason game,[232] and it 
was also the first time that two teams had combined to hit 11 batters with 
pitches in the course of a single postseason series.[232] 8:08 p.m. (EDT) 
at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Retired pitcher and former National 
Liván Hernández had missed the chance to throw out the ceremonial first 
pitch in Game 1 when Hurricane Matthew made it imppossible for him to fly 
from Florida to fly to Washington for that game, but he threw out the first 
pitch for Game 5 instead.[233] For some the game carried an historic weight 
that would either confirm or change the narrative of the Nationals, their 
achievements, and their prospects for the future after their collapse in 
the 2012 NLDS and the impotence of their offense in the 2014 NLDS.[234] 
A Washington, D.C., MLB team had not won a postseason series since the 
Washington Senators won the 1924 World Series, the Montreal-Washington 
franchise had won only one playoff series in its history (in 1981, as the 
Montreal Expos), and the Nationals had never advanced beyond the NLDS in 
two previous tries. Two personal negative streaks also were on the line: 
Teams Dusty Baker managed had lost eight straight postseason elimination 
games in a row in which they had a chance to advance to the next round 
of the playoffs, and starting pitcher Max Scherzer had started three postseason 
elimination games in a row for his previous teams, all of them losses. 
Scherzer held the Dodgers hitless until the fifth inning, when Los Angeles 
right fielder Josh Reddick finally singled. The Dodgers loaded the bases 
with two more singles, but Scherzer struck out pinch hitter Andre Ethier 
and got second baseman Chase Utley to ground out to end the inning without 
the Dodgers scoring. The Nats, meanwhile, staked Scherzer to a 1-0 lead 
off Dodgers starter Rich Hill in the bottom of the second inning when second 
baseman Daniel Murphy singled, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman walked, and 
shortstop Danny Espinosa singled to drive in Murphy. But they missed scoring 
opportunities that followed. In the third inning, center fielder Trea Turner 
singled, stole second, and advanced to third on a fly out and Murphy was 
intentionally walked and stole second, but Dodgers reliever Joe Blanton 
entered the game and got third baseman Anthony Rendon to line out to end 
the inning without driving either of them in. In the fifth inning, Dodgers 
pitcher Julio Urías walked right fielder Bryce Harper but then picked him 
off first. And in the sixth inning, after left fielder Jayson Werth walked, 
Zimmerman doubled with two outs and third base coach Bob Hendley ill-advisedly 
sent Werth home as he rounded third; the Dodgers cut Werth down at the 
plate easily to end the inning.[235] The Nationals still clung to a 1-0 
lead when disaster struck them in the top of the seventh inning, in which 
the Nationals used a single-inning record six pitchers. Los Angeles center 
fielder Joc Pederson hit Scherzer′s first pitch into the left field stands 
to tie the game at 1-1, prompting Baker to take Scherzer out of the game 
after 99 pitches. Reliever Marc Rzepczynski then walked Dodgers catcher 
Yasmani Grandal; Blake Treinen gave up a single to pinch-hitter Howie Kendrick; 
Sammy Solis gave up a one-out single to pinch-hitter Carlos Ruiz which 
scored pinch-runner Austin Barnes to give the Dodgers a 2-1 lead; Shawn 
Kelley gave up a two-out triple to third baseman Justin Turner that scored 
Kendrck and Ruiz to give Los Angeles a 4-1 lead; and finally Óliver Pérez 
induced a groundout by first baseman Adrian Gonzalez to end the inning.[235] 
Washington mounted a comeback in the bottom of the seventh, when Espinosa 
led off with a walk and pinch-hitter Chris Heisey followed with a two-run 
homer off reliever Grant Dayton to cut the Dodgers′ lead to 4-3. When first 
baseman Clint Robinson followed immediately with a single, Dodgers manager 
Dave Roberts made the unconventional move of bringing in closer Kenley 
Jansen to pitch in the seventh inning, something Jansen had not done since 
2013. Although the Nats put pressure on Jansen, with Harper singling and 
Murphy intentionally walked to load the bases, Jansen struck out Rendon 
for the third out to preserve the Dodgers' lead. Jansen pitched into the 
ninth inning without giving up another hit, throwing 51 pitches – nine 
more than he ever had before. When Jansen tired in the bottom of the ninth, 
walking Harper and Werth with one out, Roberts made another unconventional 
move, bringing Clayton Kershaw - who had started Game 1 and, on short rest, 
Game 4 – in for the first save of his career. Kershaw got Murphy to pop 
out for the second out, and, with no one else left on the bench to face 
Kershaw, Baker sent rookie Wilmer Difo to the plate. Kershaw struck out 
the overmatched Difo to preserve a 4-3 win and give Los Angeles a 3-2 series 
victory. The Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs in the NLDS for

sent five players to the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game; in the 
National League, only the Chicago Cubs had more players selected for the 
game, with seven. The Nationals set a new team record for the number of 
players selected for the Major League Baseball All-Star Game since the 
franchise relocated to Washington in 2005; previously, the record for Nationals 
in an all-star game was four, in 2012.[236][237] The selection of four 
Nationals players was announced on July 5: At the same time it announced 
Strasburg′s unavailability, Major League Baseball announced that Max Scherzer 
had replaced him on the National League roster. It was Scherzer′s fourth 
overall and fourth consecutive all-star selection; he previously had been 
selected for the American League roster representing the Detroit Tigers 
in 2013 and 2014 and for the National League team representing the Nationals 
in 2015.[237] On November 9, 2016, Daniel Murphy received the Players' 
Choice Award for Outstanding Player in the National League. In 2016, Murphy 
led the National League with a .595 slugging percentage, .985 on-base-plus-slugging 
percentage, and 47 doubles, and his .347 batting average was second only 
to that of DJ LeMahieu, who hit .348 for the Colorado Rockies. Murphy hit 
25 home runs and had 104 runs batted in and a .390 on-base percentage. 
During the seven-game 2016 National League Division Series against the 
Los Angeles Dodgers, he had a .438 batting average and drove in six runs.[239] 
On November 10, 2016, it was announced that Daniel Murphy and Wilson Ramos 
had won the National League Silver Slugger awards for their respective 
positions. It was the first time either of them had won a Silver Slugger.[240] 
During the 2016 season, Murphy finished in the top two among National League 
second basemen in every major offensive category: He was first in home 
runs (25), runs batted in (104), slugging percentage (.595), and wins above 
replacement (5.5) and second in batting average (.347) and on-base percentage 
(.390). His lowest monthly on-base-plus slugging percentage (OPS) in 2016 
was .830, and his OPS exceeded 1.000 in three different months. He was 
the National League Player of the Month for both May and July 2016.[240] 
Ramos played in a career-high 131 games in 2016. Among National League 
catchers, he finished first in slugging percentage (.496), tied for first 
in runs batted in (80), second in home runs (22), and third in on-base
