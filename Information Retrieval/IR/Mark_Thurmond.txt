Mark Anthony Thurmond (born September 12, 1956 in Houston, Texas) is a 
former professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 
1983 to 1990. He was never on the disabled list in his career. Thurmond 
was originally drafted by the San Diego Padres out of Texas A&M University 
in the 24th round of the 1978 MLB Draft, but he chose not to sign. He was 
then drafted by the Padres in the fifth round of the 1979 MLB Draft, and 
he signed that time. As a rookie in 1983, Thurmond went 7–3 with a 2.65 
ERA, and he was tied for ninth in the 1983 NL Rookie of the Year Award 
voting.[1] In 1984, he had the best season of his career, going 14–8 with 
a 2.97 ERA as the Padres won the National League West. He lost Game 2 of 
the National League Championship Series, giving up 4 runs in 3 2⁄3 innings,[2] 
but it didn't matter in the end as the Padres overcame an 0–2 deficit in 
the series to beat the Chicago Cubs 3 games to 2. He was also the losing 
pitcher in Game 1 of the 1984 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, 
giving up only three runs, but only lasting 5 innings.[3] Thurmond also 
started Game 5, and although he only lasted 1/3 of an inning, he gave up 
three runs again but earned a no-decision this time.[4] The 1985 season 
was sort of a let-down for Thurmond, as he went 7–11 with a 3.97 ERA (an 
entire run higher than 1984) and only started 23 of his 36 games. In 1986, 
Thurmond got off to a very rocky start, going 3–7 with a 6.50 ERA in his 
first 17 games (15 starts). On July 9, 1986, he was traded to the Detroit 
Tigers for pitcher Dave LaPoint. Thurmond really turned things around upon 
his arrival in Detroit, although it was mostly in the bullpen. He finished 
the year with the Tigers 4–1, with a 1.92 ERA in 25 games (4 starts). His 
next season with the Tigers was the first in which he didn't start a single 
game, as he went 0–1 with a 4.23 ERA in 48 games out of the bullpen. He 
made his final playoff appearance in Game 4 of the 1987 ALCS, pitching 
1/3 of an inning without giving up a run.[5] On February 26, 1988, the 
Tigers traded Thurmond to the Baltimore Orioles for Ray Knight. Thurmond's 
first season with the Orioles, like their season in 1988, wasn't that great. 
He went 1–8 with a 4.58 ERA in 43 games (6 starts) while the Orioles finished 
last in the American League. The following season was better for Thurmond, 
as he went 2–4 with a 3.90 ERA in 49 games while pitching almost entirely 
out of the bullpen. On February 1, 1990, Thurmond signed with the Houston 
Astros. However, he didn't pitch with them at all. Instead, he pitched 
in nine games for the Tucson Toros, the Astros' AAA affiliate, posting 
a 3.27 ERA with no decisions. On May 1, he was sent to the San Francisco 
Giants as part of a conditional deal. Thurmond pitched pretty well out 
of the bullpen for the Giants, going 2–3 with a 3.34 ERA in 43 games. However, 
1990 was his final year in the major leagues. In 1991, he finished his 
career with the Phoenix Firebirds, the Giants AAA affiliate, going 0–3 
with a 3.42 ERA in 26 games. Thurmond currently resides in Katy, Texas,
