Antonio Alfonseca (/ælfɒnˈseɪkə/; Spanish pronunciation: [anˈtonjo alfonˈseka]; 
born April 16, 1972) is a retired relief pitcher. He last pitched in Major 
League Baseball for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2007. Alfonseca also played 
for the Florida Marlins (1997–2001, 2005), the Chicago Cubs (2002–2003), 
the Atlanta Braves (2004), and the Texas Rangers (2006). He is known for 
having an extra digit on each hand and foot. Alfonseca was originally signed 
by the Montreal Expos as a non-drafted free agent in July 1989. On December 
13, 1993, he was taken by the Florida Marlins from the Montreal Expos in 
the 1993 expansion draft. His best year was in 2000 with the Marlins, when 
he led the National League in saves with 45, and won the National League 
Rolaids Relief Man of the Year. At the end of the 2001 season, Alfonseca 
had surgery to repair a herniated disc. Subsequently, the Marlins asked 
Alfonseca to lose 15 pounds to help to relieve stress on his back. At a 
weigh-in during 2002 spring training, Alfonseca had a confrontation with 
Dale Torborg, the son of then manager Jeff Torborg, and a former professional 
wrestler.[1] While the Marlins denied any connection, shortly afterwards, 
on March 27, 2002, he was traded, along with Matt Clement, to the Chicago 
Cubs for Julián Tavárez, Ryan Jorgensen, Dontrelle Willis, and Jose Cueto. 
On September 2, 2003, while with the Cubs, Alfonseca was thrown out of 
a game for bumping an umpire with his stomach.[2] He was subsequently suspended 
for five games.[3] After the 2004 season, he filed for free agency, and 
signed back with the Marlins, but in July 2005, he suffered a right elbow 
injury and missed the rest of the season. He was released by the Marlins, 
signed with the Rangers, but after another mid-season elbow injury was 
released by them. He pitched for the Phillies in 2007 and for the Lancaster 
Barnstormers and Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League from 2009 to 
2011. His nicknames are El Pulpo ("The Octopus"), The Dragonslayer, and 
Six-Fingers. He has six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, 
a condition known as polydactyly. His grandfather also had this trait. 
Alfonseca regards it with pride, as a kind of family emblem.[4] Alfonseca 
and his wife Rocio have two sons: Antonio, Jr. and Mark Anthony, and two
