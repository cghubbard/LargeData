Florida i/ˈflɒrɪdə/ (Spanish for "land of flowers") is a state located 
in the southeastern region of the United States. The state is bordered 
to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, 
to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida 
and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous,[8] 
and the 8th most densely populated of the United States. Jacksonville is 
the most populous city in Florida, and the largest city by area in the 
contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is the eighth-largest 
metropolitan area in the United States. Tallahassee is the state capital. 
A peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Straits 
of Florida, it has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, 
approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km), and is the only state that borders 
both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at 
or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. The climate 
varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south.[9] The American 
alligator, American crocodile, Florida panther, and manatee can be found 
in the Everglades National Park. Since the first European contact was made 
in 1513 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León – who named it La Florida 
([la floˈɾiða] "land of flowers") upon landing there in the Easter season, 
Pascua Florida[10] – Florida was a challenge for the European colonial 
powers before it gained statehood in the United States in 1845. It was 
a principal location of the Seminole Wars against the Native Americans, 
and racial segregation after the American Civil War. Today, Florida is 
distinctive for its large Cuban expatriate community and high population 
growth, as well as for its increasing environmental issues. The state's 
economy relies mainly on tourism, agriculture, and transportation, which 
developed in the late 19th century. Florida is also renown for amusement 
parks, orange crops, the Kennedy Space Center, and as a popular destination 
for retirees. Florida culture is a reflection of influences and multiple 
inheritance; Native American, European American, Hispanic and Latino, and 
African American heritages can be found in the architecture and cuisine. 
Florida has attracted many writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest 
Hemingway and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities 
and athletes. It is internationally known for golf, tennis, auto racing 
and water sports. By the 16th century, the earliest time for which there 
is a historical record, major Native American groups included the Apalachee 
(of the Florida Panhandle), the Timucua (of northern and central Florida), 
the Ais (of the central Atlantic coast), the Tocobaga (of the Tampa Bay 
area), the Calusa (of southwest Florida) and the Tequesta (of the southeastern 
coast). Florida was the first part of the continental United States to 
be visited and settled by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers 
came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León. Ponce de León spotted 
and landed on the peninsula on April 2, 1513. He named the region La Florida 
("land of flowers").[11] The story that he was searching for the Fountain 
of Youth is a myth.[12] "In May 1539, Conquistador Hernando de Soto skirted 
the coast of Florida, searching for a deep harbor to land. He described 
seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile, some reaching 
as high as 70 feet (21 m), with intertwined and elevated roots making landing 
difficult. Very soon, 'many smokes' appeared 'along the whole coast', billowing 
against the sky, when the Native ancestors of the Seminole spotted the 
newcomers and spread the alarm by signal fires".[13] The Spanish introduced 
Christianity, cattle, horses, sheep, the Spanish language, and more to 
Florida.[14][full citation needed] Both the Spanish and French established 
settlements in Florida, with varying degrees of success. In 1559, Don Tristán 
de Luna y Arellano established a settlement at present-day Pensacola, making 
it the first attempted settlement in Florida, but it was abandoned by 1561. 
In 1565, the Spanish settlement of St. Augustine (San Agustín) was established 
under the leadership of admiral and governor Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, 
creating what would become the oldest European settlement in the continental 
U.S. and establishing the first generation of Floridanos and the government 
of Florida.[15] Spain maintained tenuous control over the region by converting 
the local tribes to Christianity. The area of Spanish Florida diminished 
with the establishment of English settlements to the north and French claims 
to the west. The English attacked St. Augustine, burning the city and its 
cathedral to the ground several times. Spain built the Castillo de San 
Marcos in 1672 and Fort Matanzas in 1742 to defend Florida's capital city 
from attacks, and to maintain its strategic position in the defense of 
the Captaincy General of Cuba and the Spanish West Indies. Florida attracted 
numerous Africans and African-Americans from adjacent British colonies 
who sought freedom from slavery. In 1738, Governor Manuel de Montiano established 
Fort Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose near St. Augustine, a fortified 
town for escaped slaves to whom Montiano granted citizenship and freedom 
in return for their service in the Florida militia, and which became the 
first free black settlement legally sanctioned in North America.[16][17] 
In 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain for control 
of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the Seven 
Years' War. It was part of a large expansion of British territory following 
their victory in the Seven Years' War. A large portion of the Spanish Floridano 
population left, taking along most of the remaining indigenous population 
to Cuba.[18] The British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. 
Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow 
point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British named "Cow 
Ford", both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought 
across the river there.[19][20][21] The British divided and consolidated 
the Florida provinces (Las Floridas) into East Florida and West Florida, 
a division the Spanish government kept after the brief British period.[22] 
The British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had 
fought in the French and Indian War in order to encourage settlement. In 
order to induce settlers to move to Florida, reports of its natural wealth 
were published in England. A large number of British settlers who were 
"energetic and of good character" moved to Florida, mostly coming from 
South Carolina, Georgia and England. There was also a group of settlers 
who came from the colony of Bermuda. This would be the first permanent 
English-speaking population in what is now Duval County, Baker County, 
St. Johns County and Nassau County. The British built good public roads 
and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well 
the export of lumber.[23][24] As a result of these initiatives northeastern 
Florida prospered economically in a way it never did under Spanish rule. 
Furthermore, the British governors were directed to call general assemblies 
as soon as possible in order to make laws for the Floridas and in the meantime 
they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This would 
be the first introduction of much of the English-derived legal system which 
Florida still has today including trial by jury, habeas corpus and county-based 
government.[23][24] Neither East Florida nor West Florida would send any 
representatives to Philadelphia to draft the Declaration of Independence. 
Florida would remain a Loyalist stronghold for the duration of the American 
Revolution.[25] Spain regained both East and West Florida after Britain's 
defeat in the American Revolution and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles 
in 1783, and continued the provincial divisions until 1821. Defense of 
Florida's northern border with the United States was minor during the second 
Spanish period. The region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base 
for Indian attacks against U.S. territories, and the U.S. pressed Spain 
for reform. Americans of English descent and Americans of Scots-Irish descent 
began moving into northern Florida from the backwoods of Georgia and South 
Carolina. Though technically not allowed by the Spanish authorities, the 
Spanish were never able to effectively police the border region and the 
backwoods settlers from the United States would continue to migrate into 
Florida unchecked. These migrants, mixing with the already present British 
settlers who had remained in Florida since the British period, would be 
the progenitors of the population known as Florida Crackers.[26] These 
American settlers established a permanent foothold in the area and ignored 
Spanish officials. The British settlers who had remained also resented 
Spanish rule, leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for 
ninety days of the so-called Free and Independent Republic of West Florida 
on September 23. After meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the 
Spanish garrison at Baton Rouge (now in Louisiana), and unfurled the flag 
of the new republic: a single white star on a blue field. This flag would 
later become known as the "Bonnie Blue Flag". In 1810, parts of West Florida 
were annexed by proclamation of President James Madison, who claimed the 
region as part of the Louisiana Purchase. These parts were incorporated 
into the newly formed Territory of Orleans. The U.S. annexed the Mobile 
District of West Florida to the Mississippi Territory in 1812. Spain continued 
to dispute the area, though the United States gradually increased the area 
it occupied. Seminole Indians based in East Florida began raiding Georgia 
settlements, and offering havens for runaway slaves. The United States 
Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including 
the 1817–1818 campaign against the Seminole Indians by Andrew Jackson that 
became known as the First Seminole War. The United States now effectively 
controlled East Florida. Control was necessary according to Secretary of 
State John Quincy Adams because Florida had become "a derelict open to 
the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, 
and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.".[27] 
Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers 
or garrisons. Madrid therefore decided to cede the territory to the United 
States through the Adams-Onís Treaty, which took effect in 1821.[28] President 
James Monroe was authorized on March 3, 1821 to take possession of East 
Florida and West Florida for the United States and provide for initial 
governance.[29] Andrew Jackson, on behalf of the U.S. federal government, 
served as a military commissioner with the powers of governor of the newly 
acquired territory for a brief period.[30] On March 30, 1822, the U.S. 
Congress merged East Florida and part of West Florida into the Florida 
Territory.[31] By the early 1800s, Indian removal was a significant issue 
throughout the southeastern U.S. and also in Florida. In 1830, the U.S. 
Congress passed the Indian Removal Act and as settlement increased, pressure 
grew on the United States government to remove the Indians from Florida. 
Seminoles harbored runaway blacks, known as the Black Seminoles, and clashes 
between whites and Indians grew with the influx of new settlers. In 1832, 
the Treaty of Payne's Landing promised to the Seminoles lands west of the 
Mississippi River if they agreed to leave Florida. Many Seminole left at 
this time. Some Seminoles remained, and the U.S. Army arrived in Florida, 
leading to the Second Seminole War (1835–42). Following the war, approximately 
3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole were removed to Indian Territory. 
A few hundred Seminole remained in Florida in the Everglades. On March 
3, 1845, Florida became the 27th state to join the United States of America.[32] 
The state was admitted as a slave state and ceased to be a sanctuary for 
runaway slaves. Initially its population grew slowly. As European-American 
settlers continued to encroach on Seminole lands, and the United States 
intervened to move the remaining Seminoles to the West. The Third Seminole 
War (1855–58) resulted in the forced removal of most of the remaining Seminoles, 
although hundreds of Seminole Indians remained in the Everglades.[33] American 
settlers began to establish cotton plantations in northern Florida, which 
required numerous laborers, which they supplied by buying slaves in the 
domestic market. By 1860 Florida had only 140,424 people, of whom 44% were 
enslaved. There were fewer than 1,000 free African Americans before the 
American Civil War.[34] In January 1861, nearly all delegates in the Florida 
Legislature approved an ordinance of secession, declaring Florida to be 
"a sovereign and independent nation" — an apparent reassertion to the preamble 
in Florida's Constitution of 1838, in which Florida agreed with Congress 
to be a "Free and Independent State." Although not directly related to 
the issue of slavery, the ordinance declared Florida's secession from the 
Union, allowing it to become one of the founding members of the Confederate 
States, a looser union of states. The confederal union received little 
help from Florida; the 15,000 men it offered were generally sent elsewhere. 
The largest engagements in the state were the Battle of Olustee, on February 
20, 1864, and the Battle of Natural Bridge, on March 6, 1865. Both were 
Confederate victories.[35] The war ended in 1865. Following the American 
Civil War, Florida's congressional representation was restored on June 
25, 1868, albeit forcefully after Radical Reconstruction and the installation 
of unelected government officials under the final authority of federal 
military commanders. After the Reconstruction period ended in 1876, white 
Democrats regained power in the state legislature. In 1885 they created 
a new constitution, followed by statutes through 1889 that disfranchised 
most blacks and many poor whites.[citation needed] Until the mid-20th century, 
Florida was the least populous Southern state. In 1900 its population was 
only 528,542, of whom nearly 44% were African American, the same proportion 
as before the Civil War.[36] The boll weevil devastated cotton crops. Forty 
thousand blacks, roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population, left the state 
in the Great Migration. They left due to lynchings and racial violence, 
and for better opportunities.[37] Disfranchisement for most African Americans 
in the state persisted until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s gained 
federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional 
suffrage. Historically, Florida's economy was based upon agricultural products 
such as cattle farming, sugarcane, citrus, tomatoes, and strawberries. 
Economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to Florida and related 
development of hotels and resort communities. Combined with its sudden 
elevation in profile was the Florida land boom of the 1920s, which brought 
a brief period of intense land development. Devastating hurricanes in 1926 
and 1928, followed by the Great Depression, brought that period to a halt. 
Florida's economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for 
World War II. The climate, tempered by the growing availability of air 
conditioning, and low cost of living made the state a haven. Migration 
from the Rust Belt and the Northeast sharply increased Florida's population 
after the war. In recent decades, more migrants have come for the jobs 
in a developing economy. With a population of more than 18 million according 
to the 2010 census, Florida is the most populous state in the Southeastern 
United States, and the fourth most populous in the United States. Key West

District has some of the oldest buildings in Miami Much of the state of 
Florida is situated on a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic 
Ocean and the Straits of Florida. Spanning two time zones, it extends to 
the northwest into a panhandle, extending along the northern Gulf of Mexico. 
It is bordered on the north by the states of Georgia and Alabama, and on 
the west, at the end of the panhandle, by Alabama. It is the only state 
that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Florida is west 
of The Bahamas and 90 miles (140 km) north of Cuba. Florida is one of the 
largest states east of the Mississippi River, and only Alaska and Michigan 
are larger in water area. The water boundary is 3 nautical miles (3.5 mi; 
5.6 km) offshore in the Atlantic Ocean[38] and 9 nautical miles (10 mi; 
17 km) offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.[38] At 345 feet (105 m) above mean 
sea level, Britton Hill is the highest point in Florida and the lowest 
highpoint of any U.S. state.[39] Much of the state south of Orlando lies 
at a lower elevation than northern Florida, and is fairly level. Much of 
the state is at or near sea level. However, some places such as Clearwater 
have promontories that rise 50 to 100 ft (15 to 30 m) above the water. 
Much of Central and North Florida, typically 25 mi (40 km) or more away 
from the coastline, have rolling hills with elevations ranging from 100 
to 250 ft (30 to 76 m). The highest point in peninsular Florida (east and 
south of the Suwannee River), Sugarloaf Mountain, is a 312-foot (95 m) 
peak in Lake County.[40] On average, Florida is the flattest state in the 
United States.[41] The climate of Florida is tempered somewhat by the fact 
that no part of the state is distant from the ocean. North of Lake Okeechobee, 
the prevalent climate is humid subtropical (Köppen: Cfa), while areas south 
of the lake (including the Florida Keys) have a true tropical climate (Köppen: 
Aw).[42] Mean high temperatures for late July are primarily in the low 
90s Fahrenheit (32–34 °C). Mean low temperatures for early to mid January 
range from the low 40s Fahrenheit (4–7 °C) in northern Florida to above 
60 °F (16 °C) from Miami on southward. With an average daily temperature 
of 70.7 °F (21.5 °C), it is the warmest state in the U.S.[43] In the summer, 
high temperatures in the state seldom exceed 100 °F (38 °C). Several record 
cold maxima have been in the 30s °F (−1 to 4 °C) and record lows have been 
in the 10s (−12 to −7 °C). These temperatures normally extend at most a 
few days at a time in the northern and central parts of Florida. Southern 
Florida, however, rarely encounters freezing temperatures.[citation needed] 
The hottest temperature ever recorded in Florida was 109 °F (43 °C), which 
was set on June 29, 1931 in Monticello. The coldest temperature was −2 °F 
(−19 °C), on February 13, 1899, just 25 miles (40 km) away, in Tallahassee.[44][45] 
Due to its subtropical and tropical climate, Florida rarely receives snow. 
However, on rare occasions, a combination of cold moisture and freezing 
temperatures can result in snowfall in the farthest northern regions. Frost 
is more common than snow, occurring sometimes in the panhandle.[citation 
needed] The USDA Plant hardiness zones for the state range from zone 8a 
(no colder than 10 °F or −12 °C) in the inland western panhandle to zone 
11b (no colder than 45 °F or 7 °C) in the lower Florida Keys.[46] Florida's 
nickname is the "Sunshine State", but severe weather is a common occurrence 
in the state. Central Florida is known as the lightning capital of the 
United States, as it experiences more lightning strikes than anywhere else 
in the U.S.[53] Florida has one of the highest average precipitation levels 
of any state,[54] in large part because afternoon thunderstorms are common 
in much of the state from late spring until early autumn. A narrow eastern 
part of the state including Orlando and Jacksonville receives between 2,400 
and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually. The rest of the state, including 
Miami, receives between 2,800 and 3,200 hours annually.[55] Florida leads 
the United States in tornadoes per area (when including waterspouts)[56] 
but they do not typically reach the intensity of those in the Midwest and 
Great Plains. Hail often accompanies the most severe thunderstorms.[citation 
needed] Hurricanes pose a severe threat each year during the June 1 to 
November 30 hurricane season, particularly from August to October. Florida 
is the most hurricane-prone state, with subtropical or tropical water on 
a lengthy coastline. Of the category 4 or higher storms that have struck 
the United States, 83% have either hit Florida or Texas.[57] From 1851 
to 2006, Florida was struck by 114 hurricanes, 37 of them major—category 
3 and above.[57] It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any 
impact in the state by at least a tropical storm.[citation needed] Florida 
was the site of what was then the costliest weather disaster in U.S. history, 
Hurricane Andrew, which caused more than $25 billion in damage when it 
struck in August 1992; it held that distinction until 2005, when Hurricane 
Katrina surpassed it. Hurricane Wilma — the second most expensive hurricane 
in Florida history — landed just south of Marco Island in October 2004.[58][59]

of wildlife including: The only known calving area for the northern right 
whale is off the coasts of Florida and Georgia.[64] The native bear population 
has risen from a historic low of 300 in the 1970s, to 3,000 in 2011.[65] 
Since their accidental importation from South America into North America 
in the 1930s, the red imported fire ant population has increased its territorial 
range to include most of the Southern United States, including Florida. 
They are more aggressive than most native ant species and have a painful 
sting.[66] A number of non-native snakes and lizards have been released 
in the wild. In 2010 the state created a hunting season for Burmese and 
Indian pythons, African rock pythons, green anacondas, and Nile monitor 
lizards.[67] Green iguanas have also established a firm population in the 
southern part of the state. There are about 500,000 feral pigs in Florida.[68]

union, behind California and Texas, both larger states.[69] On the east 
coast of the state, mangroves have normally dominated the coast from Cocoa 
Beach southward; salt marshes from St. Augustine northward. From St. Augustine 
south to Cocoa Beach, the coast fluctuates between the two, depending on 
the annual weather conditions.[63] Everglades National Park in Southern

Florida Florida is a low per capita energy user.[70] It is estimated that 
approximately 4% of energy in the state is generated through renewable 
resources.[71] Florida's energy production is 6% of the nation's total 
energy output, while total production of pollutants is lower, with figures 
of 5.6% for nitrogen oxide, 5.1% for carbon dioxide, and 3.5% for sulfur 
dioxide.[71] All potable water resources have been controlled by the state 
government through five regional water authorities since 1972.[72] Red 
tide has been an issue on the southwest coast of Florida, as well as other 
areas. While there has been a great deal of conjecture over the cause of 
the toxic algae bloom, there is no evidence that it is being caused by 
pollution or that there has been an increase in the duration or frequency 
of red tides.[73] The Florida panther is close to extinction. A record 
23 were killed in 2009 predominately by automobile collisions, leaving 
about 100 individuals in the wild. The Center for Biological Diversity 
and others have therefore called for a special protected area for the panther 
to be established.[74] Manatees are also dying at a rate higher than their 
reproduction. Much of Florida has an elevation of less than 12 feet (3.7 m), 
including many populated areas. Therefore, it is susceptible to rising 
sea levels associated with global warming.[75] The Atlantic beaches that 
are vital to the state's economy are being washed out to sea due to rising 
sea levels caused by climate change. The Miami beach area, close to the 
continental shelf, is running out of accessible offshore sand reserves.[76] 
The Florida peninsula is a porous plateau of karst limestone sitting atop 
bedrock known as the Florida Platform. The largest deposits of potash in 
the United States are found in Florida.[77] Extended systems of underwater 
caves, sinkholes and springs are found throughout the state and supply 
most of the water used by residents. The limestone is topped with sandy 
soils deposited as ancient beaches over millions of years as global sea 
levels rose and fell. During the last glacial period, lower sea levels 
and a drier climate revealed a much wider peninsula, largely savanna.[78] 
The Everglades, an enormously wide, slow-flowing river encompasses the 
southern tip of the peninsula. Sinkhole damage claims on property in the 
state exceeded a total of $2 billion from 2006 through 2010.[79] Florida 
is tied for last place as having the fewest earthquakes of any U.S. state.[80][81] 
Earthquakes are rare because Florida is not located near any tectonic plate 
boundaries. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population 
of Florida was 20,271,272 on July 1, 2015, a 7.82% increase since the 2010 
United States Census.[4] The population of Florida in the 2010 census was 
18,801,310.[83] Florida was the seventh fastest-growing state in the U.S. 
in the 12-month period ending July 1, 2012.[84] In 2010, the center of 
population of Florida was located between Fort Meade and Frostproof. The 
center of population has moved less than 5 miles (8 km) to the east and 
approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) to the north between 1980 and 2010 and has 
been located in Polk County since the 1960 census.[85] The population exceeded 
19.7 million by December 2014, surpassing the population of the state of 
New York for the first time.[86] Florida contains the highest percentage 
of people over 65 (17%).[87] There were 186,102 military retirees living 
in the state in 2008.[88] About two-thirds of the population was born in 
another state, the second highest in the U.S.[89] In 2010, illegal immigrants 
constituted an estimated 5.7% of the population. This was the sixth highest 
percentage of any state in the U.S.[90][91] There were an estimated 675,000 
illegal immigrants in the state in 2010.[92] A 2013 Gallup poll indicated 
that 47% of the residents agreed that Florida was the best state to live 
in. Results in other states ranged from a low of 18% to a high of 77%.[93] 
The legal name in Florida for a city, town or village is "municipality". 
In Florida there is no legal difference between towns, villages and cities.[94] 
In 2012, 75% of the population lived within 10 miles (16 km) of the coastline.[95] 
The largest metropolitan area in the state as well as the entire southeastern 
United States is the Miami metropolitan area, with about 5.8 million people. 
The Tampa Bay Area, with over 2.8 million people, is the second largest; 
the Orlando metropolitan area, with over 2.2 million people, is the third; 
and the Jacksonville metropolitan area, with over 1.3 million people, is 
fourth. Florida has 22 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) defined by 
the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 43 of Florida's 
67 counties are in a MSA. Hispanic and Latinos of any race made up 22.5% 
of the population in 2010.[100]As of 2011, 57% of Florida's population 
younger than age 1 were minorities (meaning that they had at least one 
parent who was not non-Hispanic white).[101] Florida is among the three 
states with the most severe felony disenfranchisement laws. Florida requires 
felons to have completed sentencing, parole and/or probation, and then 
seven years later, to apply individually for restoration of voting privileges. 
As in other aspects of the criminal justice system, this law has disproportionate 
effects for minorities. As a result, according to Brent Staples, based 
on data from The Sentencing Project, the effect of Florida's law is such 
that in 2014 "[m]ore than one in ten Floridians – and nearly one in four 
African-American Floridians – are shut out of the polls because of felony 
convictions."[102] In 2010, 6.9% of the population (1,269,765) considered 
themselves to be of only American ancestry (regardless of race or ethnicity).[103][104] 
Many of these were of English or Scotch-Irish descent; however, their families 
have lived in the state for so long, that they choose to identify as having 
"American" ancestry or do not know their ancestry.[105][106][107][108][109][110] 
In the 1980 United States census the largest ancestry group reported in 
Florida was English with 2,232,514 Floridians claiming that they were of 
English or mostly English American ancestry.[111] Some of their ancestry 
went back to the original thirteen colonies. As of 2010, those of (non-Hispanic 
white) European ancestry accounted for 57.9% of Florida's population. Out 
of the 57.9%, the largest groups were 12.0% German (2,212,391), 10.7% Irish 
(1,979,058), 8.8% English (1,629,832), 6.6% Italian (1,215,242), 2.8% Polish 
(511,229), and 2.7% French (504,641).[103][104] White Americans of all 
European backgrounds are present in all areas of the state. In 1970, non-Hispanic 
whites were nearly 80% of Florida's population.[112] Those of English and 
Irish ancestry are present in large numbers in all the urban/suburban areas 
across the state. Some native white Floridians, especially those who have 
descended from long-time Florida families, may refer to themselves as "Florida 
crackers"; others see the term as a derogatory one. Like whites in most 
of the other Southern states, they descend mainly from English and Scots-Irish 
settlers, as well as some other British American settlers.[113] As of 2010, 
those of Hispanic or Latino ancestry ancestry accounted for 22.5% (4,223,806) 
of Florida's population. Out of the 22.5%, the largest groups were 6.5% 
(1,213,438) Cuban, 4.5% (847,550) Puerto Rican, 3.3% (629,718) Mexican, 
and 1.6% (300,414) Colombian.[115] Florida's Hispanic population includes 
large communities of Cuban Americans in Miami and Tampa, Puerto Ricans 
in Orlando and Tampa, and Mexican/Central American migrant workers. The 
Hispanic community continues to grow more affluent and mobile. As of 2011, 
57.0% of Florida's children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups.[116] 
Florida has a large and diverse Hispanic population, with Cubans and Puerto 
Ricans being the largest groups in the state. Nearly 80% of Cuban Americans 
live in Florida, especially South Florida where there is a long-standing 
and affluent Cuban community.[117] Florida has the second largest Puerto 
Rican population after New York, as well as the fastest-growing in the 
nation.[118] Puerto Ricans are more widespread throughout the state, though 
the heaviest concentrations are in the Orlando area of Central Florida.[119] 
As of 2010, those of African ancestry accounted for 16.0% of Florida's 
population, which includes African Americans. Out of the 16.0%, 4.0% (741,879) 
were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American.[103][104][115] During the 
early 1900s, black people made up nearly half of the state's population.[120] 
In response to segregation, disfranchisement and agricultural depression, 
many African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the 
Great Migration, in waves from 1910 to 1940, and again starting in the 
later 1940s. They moved for jobs, better education for their children and 
the chance to vote and participate in society. By 1960 the proportion of 
African Americans in the state had declined to 18%.[121] Conversely large 
numbers of northern whites moved to the state.[citation needed] Today, 
large concentrations of black residents can be found in northern and central 
Florida. Aside from blacks descended from African slaves brought to the 
US south, there are also large numbers of blacks of West Indian, recent 
African, and Afro-Latino immigrant origins, especially in the Miami/South 
Florida area. In 2010, Florida had the highest percentage of West Indians 
in the United States, with 2.0% (378,926) from Haitian ancestry, and 1.3% 
(236,950) Jamaican.[122] All other (non-Hispanic) Caribbean nations were 
well below 0.1% of Florida residents.[122][123] As of 2010, those of Asian 
ancestry accounted for 2.4% of Florida's population.[103][104] In 1988 
English was affirmed as the state's official language in the Florida Constitution. 
Spanish is also widely spoken, especially as immigration has continued 
from Latin America. Twenty percent of the population speak Spanish as their 
first language. Twenty-seven percent of Florida's population reports speaking 
a mother language other than English, and more than 200 first languages 
other than English are spoken at home in the state.[124][125] The most 
common languages spoken in Florida as a first language in 2010 are:[124] 
The most common accent throughout Florida is general American English, 
but there are a variety of English-language accents and dialects in Florida. 
Southern accents are common in northern Florida. Because of many migrants 
from the Northeast who have settled on the east coast of Florida, many 
have a northeastern accent. Similarly reflecting generations of migrants 
from the Midwest, the population of the west coast of Florida has a midwestern 
accent. The 2014 Pew Religious Landscape Survey showed the religious makeup 
of the state was as follows:[126] In 2010, the three largest denominational 
groups in Florida were the Roman Catholic Church, the Southern Baptist 
Convention, and the United Methodist Church.[127] Florida is mostly Protestant, 
but Roman Catholicism is the single largest denomination in the state, 
due in significant part to the state's large Hispanic population. There 
is also a sizable Jewish community, located mainly in South Florida; this 
is the largest Jewish population in the South and the third-largest in 
the U.S. behind those of New York and California.[128] The basic structure, 
duties, function, and operations of the government of the state of Florida 
are defined and established by the Florida Constitution, which establishes 
the basic law of the state and guarantees various rights and freedoms of 
the people. The state government consists of three separate branches: judicial, 
executive, and legislative. The legislature enacts bills, which, if signed 
by the governor, become law. The Florida Legislature comprises the Florida 
Senate, which has 40 members, and the Florida House of Representatives, 
which has 120 members. The current Governor of Florida is Rick Scott. The 
Florida Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and six Justices. Florida 
has 67 counties. Some reference materials may show only 66 because Duval 
County is consolidated with the City of Jacksonville. There are 379 cities 
in Florida (out of 411) that report regularly to the Florida Department 
of Revenue, but there are other incorporated municipalities that do not. 
The state government's primary source of revenue is sales tax. Florida 
does not impose a personal income tax. The primary revenue source for cities 
and counties is property tax; unpaid taxes are subject to tax sales which 
are held (at the county level) in May and (due to the extensive use of 
online bidding sites) are highly popular. There were 800 federal corruption 
convictions from 1988 to 2007, more than any other state.[129] From 1952 
to 1964, most voters were registered Democrats, but the state voted for 
the Republican presidential candidate in every election except for 1964. 
The following year, Congress passed and President Lyndon B. Johnson signed 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, providing for oversight of state practices 
and enforcement of constitutional voting rights for African Americans and 
other minorities in order to prevent the discrimination and disenfranchisement 
that had excluded most of them for decades from the political process. 
From the 1930s through much of the 1960s, Florida was essentially a one-party 
state dominated by white conservative Democrats, who together with other 
Democrats of the Solid South, exercised considerable control in Congress. 
They gained federal money from national programs; like other southern states, 
Florida residents have received more federal monies than they pay in taxes: 
the state is a net beneficiary. Since the 1970s, the conservative white 
majority of voters in the state has largely shifted from the Democratic 
to the Republican Party. It has continued to support Republican presidential 
candidates through the 20th century, except in 1976 and 1996, when the 
Democratic nominee was from the South. They have had "the luxury of voting 
for presidential candidates who pledge to cut taxes and halt the expansion 
of government while knowing that their congressional delegations will continue 
to protect federal spending."[131] In the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, 
Barack Obama carried the state as a northern Democrat, attracting high 
voter turnout especially among the young, Independents, and minority voters, 
of whom Hispanics comprise an increasingly large proportion. 2008 marked 
the first time since 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt carried the state, 
that Florida was carried by a Northern Democrat for president. The first 
post-Reconstruction era Republican elected to Congress from Florida was 
William C. Cramer in 1954 from Pinellas County on the Gulf Coast,[132] 
where demographic changes were underway. In this period, African Americans 
were still disenfranchised by the state's constitution and discriminatory 
practices; in the 19th century they had made up most of the Republican 
Party. Cramer built a different Republican Party in Florida, attracting 
local white conservatives and transplants from northern and midwestern 
states. In 1966 Claude R. Kirk, Jr. was elected as the first post-Reconstruction 
Republican governor, in an upset election.[133] In 1968 Edward J. Gurney, 
also a white conservative, was elected as the state's first post-reconstruction 
Republican US Senator.[134] In 1970 Democrats took the governorship and 
the open US Senate seat, and maintained dominance for years. Since the 
mid-20th century, Florida has been considered a bellwether, voting for 
13 successful presidential candidates since 1952. It voted for the loser 
only three times.[135] In 1998, Democratic voters dominated areas of the 
state with a high percentage of racial minorities and transplanted white 
liberals from the northeastern United States, known colloquially as "snowbirds".[136] 
South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area are dominated by both racial 
minorities and white liberals. Because of this, the area has consistently 
voted as one of the most Democratic areas of the state. The Daytona Beach 
area is similar demographically and the city of Orlando has a large Hispanic 
population, which has often favored Democrats. Republicans, made up mostly 
of white conservatives, have dominated throughout much of the rest of Florida, 
particularly in the more rural and suburban areas. This is characteristic 
of its voter base throughout the Deep South.[136] The fast-growing I-4 
corridor area, which runs through Central Florida and connects the cities 
of Daytona Beach, Orlando, and Tampa/St. Petersburg, has had a fairly even 
breakdown of Republican and Democratic voters. The area is often seen as 
a merging point of the conservative northern portion of the state and the 
liberal southern portion, making it the biggest swing area in the state. 
Since the late 20th century, the voting results in this area, containing 
40% of Florida voters, has often determined who will win the state of Florida 
in presidential elections.[137] The Democratic Party has maintained an 
edge in voter registration, both statewide and in 40 of the 67 counties, 
including Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties, the state's three 
most populous.[138] In 2000, George W. Bush won the U.S. Presidential election 
by a margin of 271–266 in the Electoral College.[139] Of the 271 electoral 
votes for Bush, 25 were cast by electors from Florida.[140] The Florida 
results were contested and a recount was ordered by the court, with the 
results settled in a court decision. Reapportionment following the 2010 
United States Census gave the state two more seats in the House of Representatives.[141] 
The legislature's redistricting, announced in 2012, was quickly challenged 
in court, on the grounds that it had unfairly benefited Republican interests. 
In 2015, the Florida Supreme Court ruled on appeal that the congressional 
districts had to be redrawn because of the legislature's violation of the 
Fair District Amendments to the state constitution passed in 2010; it accepted 
a new map in early December 2015. The political make-up of congressional 
and legislative districts has enabled Republicans to control the governorship 
and most statewide elective offices, and 17 of the state's 27 seats in 
the 2012 House of Representatives.[142] Florida has been listed as a swing 
state in Presidential elections since 1950, voting for the losing candidate 
once in that period of time.[143] In the closely contested 2000 election, 
the state played a pivotal role.[139][140][144][145][146][147] Out of more 
than 5.8 million votes for the two main contenders Bush and Al Gore, around 
500 votes separated the two candidates for the all-decisive Florida electoral 
votes that landed Bush the election win. Florida's felony disenfranchisement 
law is more severe than most European nations or other American states. 
A 2002 study in the American Sociological Review concluded that "if the 
state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted at the same rate as other 
Floridians, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida—and the 
presidency—by more than 80,000 votes."[148] In 2008, delegates of both 
the Republican Florida primary election and Democratic Florida primary 
election were stripped of half of their votes when the conventions met 
in August due to violation of both parties' national rules. In the 2010 
elections, Republicans solidified their dominance statewide, by winning 
the governor's mansion, and maintaining firm majorities in both houses 
of the state legislature. They won four previously Democratic-held seats 
to create a 19–6 Republican-majority delegation representing Florida in 
the federal House of Representatives. In 2010, more than 63% of state voters 
approved the initiated Amendments 5 and 6 to the state constitution, to 
ensure more fairness in districting. These have become known as the Fair 
District Amendments. As a result of the 2010 United States Census, Florida 
gained two House of Representative seats in 2012.[141] The legislature 
issued revised congressional districts in 2012, which were immediately 
challenged in court by supporters of the above amendments. The court ruled 
in 2014, after lengthy testimony, that at least two districts had to be 
redrawn because of gerrymandering. After this was appealed, in July 2015 
the Florida Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers had followed an illegal 
and unconstitutional process overly influenced by party operatives, and 
ruled that at least eight districts had to be redrawn. On December 2, 2015, 
a 5-2 majority of the Court accepted a new map of congressional districts, 
some of which was drawn by challengers. Their ruling affirmed the map previously 
approved by Leon County Judge Terry Lewis, who had overseen the original 
trial. It particularly makes changes in South Florida. There are likely 
to be additional challenges to the map and districts.[149] According to 
The Sentencing Project, the effect of Florida's felony disenfranchisement 
law is such that in 2014, "[m]ore than one in ten Floridians – and nearly 
one in four African-American Floridians – are [were] shut out of the polls 
because of felony convictions," although they had completed sentences and 
parole/probation requirements.[150] The state repealed mandatory auto inspection 
in 1981.[151] In 1972, the state made personal injury protection auto insurance 
mandatory for drivers, becoming the second in the nation to enact a no-fault 
insurance law. The ease of receiving payments under this law is seen as 
precipitating a major increase in insurance fraud.[152] Auto insurance 
fraud was the highest in the nation in 2011, estimated at close to $1 billion.[153] 
Fraud is particularly centered in the Miami-Dade metropolitan and Tampa 
areas.[154][155][156] Florida was ranked the fifth most dangerous state 
in 2009. Ranking was based on the record of serious felonies committed 
in 2008.[157] The state was the sixth highest scammed state in 2010. It 
ranked first in mortgage fraud in 2009.[158] In 2009, 44% of highway fatalities 
involved alcohol.[159] Florida is one of seven states that prohibit the 
open carry of handguns. This law was passed in 1987.[160] According to 
the Federal Trade Commission, Florida has the highest per capita rate of 
both reported fraud and other types of complaints and reported including 
identity theft complaints.[161] In the twentieth century, tourism, industry, 
construction, international banking, biomedical and life sciences, healthcare 
research, simulation training, aerospace and defense, and commercial space 
travel have contributed to the state's economic development.[citation needed] 
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Florida in 2010 was $748 billion.[164] 
Its GDP is the fourth largest economy in the United States.[165] In 2010, 
it became the fourth largest exporter of trade goods.[166] The major contributors 
to the state's gross output in 2007 were general services, financial services, 
trade, transportation and public utilities, manufacturing and construction 
respectively. In 2010–11, the state budget was $70.5 billion, having reached 
a high of $73.8 billion in 2006–07.[167] Chief Executive Magazine name 
Florida the third "Best State for Business" in 2011.[168] The economy is 
driven almost entirely by its nineteen metropolitan areas. In 2004, they 
had a combined total of 95.7% of the state's domestic product.[169] In 
2011, Florida's per capita personal income was $39,563, ranking 27th in 
the nation.[170] In February 2011, the state's unemployment rate was 11.5%.[171] 
Florida is one of seven states that do not impose a personal income tax. 
Florida's constitution establishes a state minimum wage that (unique among 
minimum wage laws) is adjusted for inflation annually. As of January 1, 
2015, Florida's minimum wage was $5.03 for tipped positions, and $8.05 
for non-tipped positions, which was higher than the federal rate of $7.25.[172] 
Florida has 4 cities in the top 25 cities in the U.S. with the most credit 
card debt.[173] The state also had the second-highest credit card delinquency 
rate, with 1.45% of cardholders in the state more than 90 days delinquent 
on one or more credit cards.[174] There were 2.4 million Floridians living 
in poverty in 2008. 18.4% of children 18 and younger were living in poverty.[175] 
Miami is the sixth poorest big city in the United States.[176] In 2010, 
over 2.5 million Floridians were on food stamps, up from 1.2 million in 
2007. To qualify, Floridians must make less than 133% of the federal poverty 
level, which would be under $29,000 for a family of four.[177] In the early 
20th century, land speculators discovered Florida, and businessmen such 
as Henry Plant and Henry Flagler developed railroad systems, which led 
people to move in, drawn by the weather and local economies. From then 
on, tourism boomed, fueling a cycle of development that overwhelmed a great 
deal of farmland. Because of the collective effect on the insurance industry 
of the hurricane claims of 2004, homeowners insurance has risen 40% to 
60% and deductibles have risen.[58] At the end of the third quarter in 
2008, Florida had the highest mortgage delinquency rate in the U.S., with 
7.8% of mortgages delinquent at least 60 days.[174] A 2009 list of national 
housing markets that were hard hit in the real estate crash included a 
disproportionate number in Florida.[178] The early 21st-century building 
boom left Florida with 300,000 vacant homes in 2009, according to state 
figures.[179] In 2009, the US Census Bureau estimated that Floridians spent 
an average 49.1% of personal income on housing-related costs, the third 
highest percentage in the U.S.[180] In the third quarter of 2009, there 
were 278,189 delinquent loans, 80,327 foreclosures.[181] Sales of existing 
homes for February 2010 was 11,890, up 21% from the same month in 2009. 
Only two metropolitan areas showed a decrease in homes sold: Panama City 
and Brevard County. The average sales price for an existing house was $131,000, 
7% decrease from the prior year.[182][dubious – discuss] Tourism makes 
up one of the largest sectors of the state economy, with nearly 1.2 million 
persons employed in the tourism industry in 2015 (a record for the state).[183] 
In 2015, Florida broke the 100-million visitor mark for the first time 
in state history by hosting a record 105 million visitors, the fifth consecutive 
year that a record was set.[183][184] Many beach towns are popular tourist 
destinations, particularly during winter and spring break. Twenty-three 
million tourists visited Florida beaches in 2000, spending $22 billion.[185] 
The public has a right to beach access under the public trust doctrine, 
but some areas have access effectively blocked by private owners for a 
long distance.[186] Amusement parks, especially in the Greater Orlando 
area, make up a significant portion of tourism. The Walt Disney World Resort 
is the most visited vacation resort in the world with over 50 million annual 
visitors, consisting of four theme parks, 27 themed resort hotels, 9 non–Disney 
hotels, two water parks, four golf courses and other recreational venues.[187] 
Other major theme parks in the area include Universal Orlando Resort, SeaWorld 
Orlando and Busch Gardens Tampa. Agriculture is the second largest industry 
in the state. Citrus fruit, especially oranges, are a major part of the 
economy, and Florida produces the majority of citrus fruit grown in the 
United States. In 2006, 67% of all citrus, 74% of oranges, 58% of tangerines, 
and 54% of grapefruit were grown in Florida. About 95% of commercial orange 
production in the state is destined for processing (mostly as orange juice, 
the official state beverage).[188] Citrus canker continues to be an issue 
of concern. From 1997 to 2013, the growing of citrus trees has declined 
25%, from 600,000 acres (240,000 ha) to 450,000 acres (180,000 ha). Citrus 
greening disease is incurable. A study states that it has caused the loss 
of $4.5 billion between 2006 and 2012. As of 2014, it was the major agricultural 
concern.[189] Other products include sugarcane, strawberries, tomatoes 
and celery.[190] The state is the largest producer of sweet corn and green 
beans for the U.S.[191] The Everglades Agricultural Area is a major center 
for agriculture. The environmental impact of agriculture, especially water 
pollution, is a major issue in Florida today. In 2009, fishing was a $6 
billion industry, employing 60,000 jobs for sports and commercial purposes.[192] 
Florida is the leading state for sales of power boats. There were $1.96 
billion worth of boats sold in 2013.[194] Phosphate mining, concentrated 
in the Bone Valley, is the state's third-largest industry. The state produces 
about 75% of the phosphate required by farmers in the United States and 
25% of the world supply, with about 95% used for agriculture (90% for fertilizer 
and 5% for livestock feed supplements) and 5% used for other products.[195] 
After the watershed events of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the state of Florida 
began investing in economic development through the Office of Trade, Tourism, 
and Economic Development. Governor Jeb Bush realized that watershed events 
such as Andrew negatively impacted Florida's backbone industry of tourism 
severely. The office was directed to target Medical/Bio-Sciences among 
others. Three years later, The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) announced 
it had chosen Florida for its newest expansion. In 2003, TSRI announced 
plans to establish a major science center in Palm Beach, a 364,000 square 
feet (33,800 m2) facility on 100 acres (40 ha), which TSRI planned to occupy 
in 2006.[196] Since the development of the federal NASA Merritt Island 
launch sites on Cape Canaveral (most notably Kennedy Space Center) in 1962, 
Florida has developed a sizable aerospace industry. Another major economic 
engine in Florida is the United States military. There are 24 military 
bases in the state, housing three Unified Combatant Commands; United States 
Central Command in Tampa, United States Southern Command in Doral, and 
United States Special Operations Command in Tampa. Some 109,390 U.S. military 
personnel stationed in Florida,[197] contributing, directly and indirectly, 
$52 billion a year to the state's economy.[198] In 2009, there were 89,706 
federal workers employed within the state.[199] Tens of thousands more 
employees work for contractors who have federal contracts, including those 
with the military. In 2012, government of all levels was a top employer 
in all counties in the state, because this classification includes public 
school teachers and other school staff. School boards employ nearly 1 of 
every 30 workers in the state. The federal military was the top employer 
in three counties.[200] There were 2.7 million Medicaid patients in Florida 
in 2009. The governor has proposed adding $2.6 billion to care for the 
expected 300,000 additional patients in 2011.[201] The cost of caring for 
2.3 million clients in 2010 was $18.8 billion.[202] This is nearly 30% 
of Florida's budget.[203] Medicaid paid for 60% of all births in Florida 
in 2009.[59] The state has a program for those not covered by Medicaid. 
In 2013, Florida refused to participate in providing coverage for the uninsured 
under the Affordable Care Act, popularly called Obamacare. The Florida 
legislature also refused to accept additional Federal funding for Medicaid, 
although this would have helped its constituents at no cost to the state. 
As a result, Florida is second only to Texas in the percentage of its citizens 
without health insurance.[204] Florida has the largest collection of Art 
Deco and Streamline Moderne buildings in both the United States and the 
entire world, most of which are located in the Miami metropolitan area, 
especially Miami Beach's Art Deco District, constructed as the city was 
becoming a resort destination.[205] A unique architectural design found 
only in Florida is the post-World War II Miami Modern, which can be seen 
in areas such as Miami's MiMo Historic District. Being of early importance 
as a regional center of banking and finance, the architecture of Jacksonville 
displays a wide variety of styles and design principles. Many of state's 
earliest skyscrapers were constructed in Jacksonville, dating as far back 
as 1902.,[206] and last holding a state height record from 1974 to 1981.[207] 
The city is endowed with one of the largest collections of Prairie School 
buildings outside of the Midwest.[208] Jacksonville is also noteworthy 
for its collection of Mid-Century modern architecture.[209] Some sections 
of the state feature architectural styles including Spanish revival, Florida 
vernacular, and Mediterranean Revival.[210][211] A notable collection of 
these styles can be found in St. Augustine, the oldest continuously occupied 
European-established settlement within the borders of the United States.[212] 
Florida's public primary and secondary schools are administered by the 
Florida Department of Education. School districts are organized within 
county boundaries. Each school district has an elected Board of Education 
which sets policy, budget, goals, and approves expenditures. Management 
is the responsibility of a Superintendent of schools. The Florida Department 
of Education is required by law to train educators in teaching English 
for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL).[213] The State University System 
of Florida was founded in 1905, and is governed by the Florida Board of 
Governors. During the 2010 academic year, 312,216 students attended one 
of these twelve universities. The Florida College System comprises 28 public 
community and state colleges. In 2011-12, enrollment consisted of more 
than 875,000 students.[214] Florida's first private university, Stetson 
University, was founded in 1883. The Independent Colleges and Universities 
of Florida is an association of 28 private, educational institutions in 
the state.[215] This Association reported that their member institutions 
served over 121,000 students in the fall of 2006.[216] Florida State University

Florida's highway system contains 1,473 mi (2,371 km) of interstate highway, 
and 9,934 mi (15,987 km) of non-interstate highway, such as state highways 
and U.S. Highways. Florida's interstates, state highways, and U.S. Highways 
are maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation. In 2011, there 
were about 9,000 retail gas stations in the state. Floridians consume 21 
million gallons of gasoline daily, ranking it third in national use.[217][218] 
Motorists have the 45th lowest rate of car insurance in the U.S. 24% are 
uninsured.[219] Drivers between 15 and 19 years of age averaged 364 car 
crashes a year per ten thousand licensed Florida drivers in 2010. Drivers 
70 and older averaged 95 per 10,000 during the same time frame. A spokesperson 
for the non-profit Insurance Institute said that "Older drivers are more 
of a threat to themselves."[220] Before the construction of routes under 
the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, Florida began construction of a long 
cross-state toll road, Florida's Turnpike. The first section, from Fort

build a high-speed rail between Tampa, Lakeland and Orlando.[223] This 
was to be the first phase of the Florida High Speed Rail system.[224] Soil 
work began in July 2010[225][226] and construction of the line was slated 
to begin in 2011, with the initial Tampa-Orlando phase completed by 2014.[227] 
The second phase, would have extended the line to Miami. Governor Scott, 
however, refused federal funds and the project has been canceled. All Aboard 
Florida is a proposed higher-speed rail service that would run between 
Orlando and Miami at speeds up to 125 mph. Its Miami to Cocoa portion is 
scheduled to open in 2016, with the final segment to Orlando opening in 
2017. Florida has three NFL teams, two MLB teams, two NBA teams, two NHL
