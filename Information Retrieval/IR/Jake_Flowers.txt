D'Arcy Raymond "Jake" Flowers (March 16, 1902 – December 27, 1962) was 
an American professional baseball player, coach and manager. Primarily 
a second baseman and shortstop, he appeared in 583 Major League games over 
ten seasons between 1923 and 1934 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn 
Robins/Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds. The native of Cambridge, Maryland, 
attended Washington College, where he played football and basketball in 
addition to baseball.[1] He batted and threw right-handed and was listed 
at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and 170 pounds (77 kg). Essentially a 
reserve infielder, Flowers played in over 100 games only once: in 1927, 
for the Robins. He also had his finest offensive season for Brooklyn during 
the lively-ball 1930 season, when Flowers batted .320 and reached career 
highs in doubles (18) and runs batted in (50) in only 86 games played. 
During his two terms with the Cardinals he was a member of two world championship 
teams, in 1926 and 1931, collecting one hit and one base on balls in 15 
World Series plate appearances. During his regular-season big-league career, 
Flowers batted .256; his 433 hits included 75 doubles, 18 triples and 16 
home runs. After his professional playing career ended in 1936, Flowers 
returned to the Eastern Shore of Maryland and turned to managing. In his 
first season, 1937, he won The Sporting News' inaugural Minor League Manager 
of the Year Award. His Salisbury Indians won the Class D Eastern Shore 
League regular-season pennant with a 59–37 win-loss record, then prevailed 
over the Centreville Colts in the league playoffs for the undisputed league 
championship. Salisbury roared off to a 21–5 record during the season's 
early weeks, but when an ineligible player was discovered on the Indians' 
roster, the team was forced to forfeit all 21 wins.[2] Undeterred, Flowers' 
club then won 59 of its last 70 games without the banned player to finish 
3 1⁄2 games ahead of the second-place Easton Browns. Had the 21 early-season 
wins not been forfeited, Salisbury would have compiled a winning percentage 
of .833, good for 135 wins during a 162-game season. After three seasons 
in the Eastern Shore League, Flowers returned to the Majors to coach under 
two former Cardinal teammates: Frankie Frisch with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1940–45) and Billy Southworth with the Boston Braves (1946). Flowers then 
was general manager of the Braves' top farm system affiliate, the Milwaukee 
Brewers of the American Association, from 1947–50 and a Cleveland Indians 
coach in 1951–52. He later scouted for the Baltimore Orioles. He suffered 
a fatal heart attack at age 60 in Clearwater, Florida. Jake Flowers is 
a member of the Washington College[1] and Eastern Shore Baseball Foundation[2]
