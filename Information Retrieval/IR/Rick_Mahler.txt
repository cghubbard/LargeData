Richard Keith Mahler (August 5, 1953 – March 2, 2005) was a starting pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played for the Atlanta Braves (1979–1988, 
1991), Cincinnati Reds (1989–1990) and Montreal Expos (1991). His brother 
Mickey was also a major league pitcher, with the two being teammates in 
1979. The two had previously been teammates playing for the Triple-A Richmond 
Braves. In his 13-year career, Mahler posted a 96–111 record with 952 strikeouts 
and a 3.99 ERA in 1951.1 innings. Born in Austin, Texas, Mahler graduated 
from John Jay High School and then attended Trinity University, both in 
San Antonio, Texas. After being signed by the Braves as an amateur free 
agent in 1975, he made his debut in the 1979 season. Mahler started on 
opening day for the Braves in 1982, when Atlanta won the National League 
West title. He made four straight opening day starts beginning in 1985. 
In 1987, he tied an NL record with his third opening day shutout. His best 
season came in 1985, when he went 17-15 with a 3.48 ERA. He pitched twice 
in the postseason, with the Braves in 1982, and with the 1990 World Series 
champion Cincinnati Reds. Mahler was a key member of that Reds' pitching 
staff as a spot starter and reliever, going 7–6 and contributing four saves. 
He also appeared in ten games with the Montreal Expos in 1991 before returning 
to Atlanta in mid-season. After retiring, Mahler served as a minor league 
pitching coach for the Kansas City Royals and the Florida Marlins, and 
he was a roving instructor for the St. Louis Cardinals. He also managed 
St. Louis' Double-A affiliate in the Texas League from 1996 to 1997. Mahler 
died at age 51 of a heart attack at home in Jupiter, Florida, where he 
was preparing for his second season as a minor league pitching coach for 
the New York Mets. He was survived by his wife, Sheryl, and five children
