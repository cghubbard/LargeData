Alois "Al" Terry Leiter (/ˈlaɪtər/; born October 23, 1965 in Toms River, 
New Jersey) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) left-handed starting 
pitcher. Leiter pitched 19 seasons in the Major Leagues for New York Yankees, 
Toronto Blue Jays, Florida Marlins, and New York Mets. He is now a studio 
analyst for MLB Network and a color commentator for the YES Network and 
Fox Sports Florida. Leiter was raised in a baseball-oriented family; all 
five of his brothers played the game.[1] A native of Berkeley Township, 
New Jersey,[2] Leiter attended Central Regional High School, in the township's 
Bayville section.[3] During one stretch in high school, he pitched consecutive 
no-hitters followed by a 32-strikeout game in 13 innings on April 19, 1984 
(a game which he did not win).[1][4] Leiter was selected for the Wilson 
First Team All-American team. Leiter was drafted by New York Yankees in 
1984 as a second round pick. Both he and his brother Mark became Yankees 
prospects. Leiter made his major league debut as the starting pitcher for 
the Yankees on September 15, 1987, earning the win in a Yankees 4–3 victory 
over the Milwaukee Brewers at Yankee Stadium. Leiter has mentioned on a 
YES Network broadcast that early in his career with the Yankees, manager 
Billy Martin walked up to him and asked him why he was lifting weights. 
Leiter responded, "To strengthen my arm." Billy was quoted as saying, "If 
you want to strengthen your arm, do some long toss." In one of his final 
starts as a young player for the Yankees, manager Dallas Green left Leiter 
in to throw 162 pitches in a cold damp day in 1989. The Yankees traded 
him to the Toronto Blue Jays for outfielder Jesse Barfield on April 30, 
1989.[5] After being dealt to Toronto, the left-hander had arthroscopic 
surgery. He pitched in fewer than 20 innings for the Blue Jays from 1989–1992, 
because of the surgery, a pinched nerve in his elbow, tendinitis, and another 
arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder. His statistics during this period 
were a 5.17 ERA, 15 2⁄3 IP, 14 H, 10 K, 11 BB, 1 HR, 1 GS, 0–0. He was, 
however, able to overcome the blisters problem with an exotic liniment 
(that he used throughout his career), and was still seen as a very promising 
prospect.[citation needed] Leiter finally got over his injury troubles 
in 1993, making 32 appearances (12 starts) for the Blue Jays. That year 
he appeared in 5 postseason games and even picked up a win in relief in 
Game One, and hit a double in Game Three of the 1993 World Series, as the 
Blue Jays went on to win their second consecutive World Championship. Leiter 
pitched effectively for the Blue Jays for the next two seasons before departing 
via free agency in 1996. Following the 1995 season, Leiter left Toronto 
and signed with the Florida Marlins as a free agent. In his first season 
as a Marlin, Leiter made his first All-Star team, going 16–12 with a 2.93 
ERA and 200 strikeouts. On May 11 of that year, Leiter pitched a no-hitter 
against the Colorado Rockies, the first in Marlins history. In 1996 was 
selected to his first All Star game. The game was played at Veterans Stadium 
in Philadelphia where Leiter recorded the last out of a National League 
6-0 win over the American League. The win was the last NL win for 13 years 
until 2010 when the National League won the All Star Classic in Anaheim. 
In 1997, Leiter won another World Series as the Marlins beat the Cleveland 
Indians. Leiter started Game 7 for the Marlins, pitching 6 innings and 
giving up two earned runs while being credited with a no decision. The 
Marlins would go on to win the game 3–2 in 11 innings to capture the championship. 
In the following off-season, Leiter was traded to the New York Mets in 
part of the Marlins "fire-sale" where owner Wayne Huizenga traded away 
almost all of the team's higher priced players. In Leiter's first season 
as a Met, he reached a career high in wins going 17–6 and a career low 
in ERA finishing with a 2.47 ERA. In 1999, when the Mets were tied with 
the Cincinnati Reds for the National League Wild Card spot after 162 games, 
Leiter was the Mets starting pitcher in the "winner take all" one game 
playoff in Cinergy Field in Cincinnati. Leiter pitched a 2-hit complete 
game shutout to earn the win in the Mets 5–0 victory. The win put the Mets 
in the playoffs for the first time in 11 seasons. The Mets would go on 
to lose the 1999 National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves 
4 games to 2. In 2000, Leiter made the All-Star team once again going 16–8 
with a 3.20 ERA and 200 strikeouts. The Mets made the playoffs again in 
2000 and this time reached the World Series. Leiter started Game 1 of the 
2000 World Series at Yankee Stadium and Game 5 at Shea Stadium. Although 
he managed to achieve a 2.87 ERA and 16 strikeouts in 15 2⁄3 innings, the 
Mets lost both games he started and eventually lost the World Series 4 
games to 1. He was booed by Yankees fans when presented that year's Roberto 
Clemente Award prior to Game 2 of the World Series. Leiter was the second 
New York Met to be honored with the award. During the 2000 season, he pitched 
in the All Star game, and gave up a single to Derek Jeter.[6] On April 
30, 2002, Leiter became the first Major League pitcher to defeat all 30 
teams, after beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 10–1.[7][8] Leiter would 
pitch for the Mets until the end of the 2004 season. In his seven seasons 
in a Met uniform, all wearing number 22, he went 95–67 with a 3.42 ERA. 
At the time he left the Mets, he ranked highly on several Mets all-time 
lists including wins (6th), strikeouts (7th with 1106), innings pitched 
(7th with 1360.0), and games started (6th with 213). He was the Mets Opening 
Day starting pitcher in 1999, 2001, and 2002. In ten straight seasons, 
from 1995 to 2004, Leiter had at least 10 wins and at least a .500 record. 
Following the 2004 season, the Mets declined Leiter's US$10 million option 
for 2005, making him a free agent. His former team, the Marlins, signed 
Leiter to a one-year, $8 million contract on December 8, 2004. Leiter struggled 
during his return to the Marlins. He walked more batters than usual (60 
in 80 innings, in addition to 88 hits). In 17 appearances (16 starts), 
he had a 3–7 record and a 6.64 ERA, and he took much criticism for the 
Marlins' first-half struggles in 2005 (they were 7 games behind the surprising 
Washington Nationals at the All-Star break). He was demoted to the bullpen 
in late June, but he returned to the rotation after an injury to Josh Beckett. 
On July 10, when the Marlins played their last game before the three-day 
All-Star break, he gave up six runs in three-plus innings. On July 14, 
2005, the Florida Marlins designated Leiter for assignment. The next day, 
he was acquired by the New York Yankees, who had four starting pitchers 
on the disabled list, for a player to be named later. His first start as 
a Yankee since April 26, 1989, came on July 17, 2005, against the division-leading 
Boston Red Sox. Leiter won the game, pitching 6 1⁄3 innings, allowing one 
run and three hits, and striking out eight. After several starts with mixed 
success, he informed Joe Torre that he would be willing to pitch out of 
the bullpen, where he would stay for the latter part of the season, yielding 
his starting slot to Aaron Small. Leiter worked out of the bullpen in the 
2005 American League Division Series pitching in four of the five games 
between the Yankees and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The Angels won the 
series 3 games to 2. In his final official appearance in a Major League 
uniform, Leiter earned a win pitching 2/3 scoreless innings in Game 4 at 
Yankee Stadium. The Yankees won the game 3–2. Leiter signed a minor league 
contract with the Yankees in 2006; however, he stated he would likely retire. 
The primary reason he spent part of spring training with the Yankees was 
to keep in shape for the World Baseball Classic. After the United States 
team was eliminated from the World Baseball Classic, he officially retired 
in an interview on YES, after a Yankees spring training victory versus 
the Indians where Leiter pitched 1/3 an inning.[9] Al Leiter has worked

the Branch Rickey Award in 1999. Leiter has also expressed interest in 
possibly running for political office as a Republican in his home state 
of New Jersey.[11] He served as a member of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's 
transition team. Leiter was appointed as a member to the New Jersey Sports, 
Gaming, and Entertainment Committee. Governor Christie nominated/appointed

with a 15 strikeout, no-hitter. His brother, Mark Leiter, pitched 11 seasons
