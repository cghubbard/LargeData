Professional sports leagues are organized in numerous ways. The two most 
significant types are one that developed in Europe, characterised by a 
tiered structure using promotion and relegation to determine participation 
in a hierarchy of leagues or divisions and a North American originated 
model characterized by its use of "franchises," closed memberships, and 
minor leagues. Both these systems remain most common in their area of origin, 
although both systems are used worldwide. The term league has many different 
meanings in different areas around the world, and its use for different 
concepts can make comparisons confusing. Usually a league is a group of 
teams that play each other during the season. It is also often used for 
the name of the governing body that oversees the league, as in America's 
Major League Baseball or England's Football League. Because most European 
soccer clubs participate in different competitions during a season, regular-season 
home-and-away games are often referred to as league games and the others 
as non-league games, even though the separate competitions may be organised 
by the same governing body. Also, there is a rugby football code called 
rugby league, which is distinct from rugby union. Professional sports leagues 
in North America comprise a stipulated number of clubs, known as franchises, 
which field one team each.[1] The franchises have territorial rights, usually 
exclusive territories large enough to cover major metropolitan areas, so 
that they have no local rivals. New teams may enter the competition only 
by a vote of current members; typically, a new place is put up for bid 
by would-be owners. This system is often called a "franchise system."[2][3][4] 
It was introduced in baseball with the formation of the National League 
in 1876[NB 1] and later adopted by the other North American leagues. Although 
member clubs are corporate entities separate from their leagues, they operate 
only under league auspices. Partly because that relationship is so close, 
and partly because the four major team sports leagues represent the top 
level of play in the world, North American teams almost never play competitive 
games against outside opponents. National Hockey League (NHL) and National 
Basketball Association (NBA) teams have played against European hockey 
and basketball teams in preseason exhibitions. The North American league, 
rather than any sport governing body, determines the playing rules and 
scoring rules of its game, and the rules under which players join and change 
teams. The teams are organized with a view to each major city having a 
team to support. Only the largest cities such as New York, Chicago or Los 
Angeles have more than one team. As such the teams are often referred to 
as franchises. Even though they are not technically franchises in a business 
sense, the league is organised in a way that assures teams continued existence 
in the league from year to year, which fosters an ongoing connection with 
the team's supporters. On occasion a league may decide to grow the sport 
by admitting a new expansion team into the league. Most of the teams in 
the four major North American pro sports leagues were created as part of 
a planned league expansion or through the merger of a rival league. Only 
a handful of teams in the National Hockey League, for example, existed 
before becoming part of the NHL. The rest of the teams were created ex 
novo as expansion teams or as charter members of the World Hockey Association, 
which merged with the NHL in 1979. The best teams in a given season reach 
a playoff tournament, and the winner of the playoffs is crowned champion 
of the league, and, in some cases as world champions. American and Canadian 
sports leagues typically have such "playoff" systems. These have their 
roots in long travel distances common in US and Canadian sports; to cut 
down on travel, leagues are typically aligned in geographic divisions and 
feature unbalanced schedules with teams playing more matches against opponents 
in the same division. Due to the unbalanced schedule typical in US and 
Canadian leagues, not all teams face the same opponents, and some teams 
may not meet during a regular season at all. This results in teams with 
identical records that have faced different opponents differing numbers 
of times, making team records alone an imperfect measure of league supremacy. 
The playoffs allow for head-to-head elimination-style competition between 
teams to counterbalance this. Major League Soccer is a North American league 
that exhibits some aspects of the European structure because soccer has 
a European rather than American origin. Major League Soccer is technically 
not an association of franchises but a single business entity, though each 
team has an owner-operator; the team owners are actually shareholders in 
the league. The league, not the individual teams, contracts with the players. 
Unlike teams in the four major sports, several Major League Soccer teams 
qualify to play competitive matches in the CONCACAF Champions League against 
teams from outside the U.S. and Canada, and MLS uses playing rules set 
by the international governing body of its sport. MLS followed its own 
playing rules until 2004, when it adopted FIFA rules. In another parallel 
with the European model, both the U.S. and Canada have separate knockout 
cup competitions during the MLS season that include teams from lower leagues. 
In the U.S., the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup has had MLS participation from 
the league's inception; starting with the 2012 cup, each competition features 
all American-based MLS sides. Similarly, all of Canada's MLS teams compete 
in the Canadian Championship. However, the league structure of MLS follows 
the North American model, with a single premier league and no promotion 
or relegation. Some other North American systems also have a hierarchical 
structure but without the promotion and relegation of clubs exhibited in 
the European model. Instead, the sports leagues generally use a minor league 
system. For example, Major League Baseball has an affiliation with Minor 
League Baseball to develop young talent. Most minor league clubs are independently 
owned, but each one contracts with a major league club that hires and pays 
players and assigns them to its various affiliated clubs. The minor clubs 
do not move up or down in the hierarchy by on-field success or failure. 
Professional ice hockey has a system somewhat similar to baseball's, while 
the National Basketball Association operates a developmental league. The 
National Football League does not have a minor league system as of 2011 
but it has operated or affiliated with minor leagues in the 1930s, 1940s, 
1960s, 1990s, and the early 2000s. Football in England developed a very 
different system from the North American one, and it has been adopted for 
football in most other European countries, as well as to many other sports 
founded in Europe and played across the world. The features of the system 
are: European football clubs are members both of a league and of a governing 
body. In the case of England, all competitive football clubs are members 
of The Football Association, while the top 20 teams also are members of 
the Premier League, a separate organization. The 72 teams in the three 
levels below the Premier League are members of still another body, the 
English Football League. The FA operates the national football team and 
tournaments that involve teams from different leagues (except the EFL Cup, 
operated by the English Football League and open to its own teams and those 
in the Premier League). In conjunction with FIFA and other countries' governing 
bodies, it also sets the playing rules and the rules under which teams 
can sell players' contracts to other clubs. The rules or Laws of the Game 
are determined by the International Football Association Board.[5] The 
Premier League negotiates television contracts for its games. However, 
although the national league would be the dominating competition in which 
a club might participate, there are many non-league fixtures a club might 
play in a given year. In European football there are national cup competitions, 
which are single elimination knock-out tournaments, are played every year 
and all the clubs in the league participate. Also, the best performing 
clubs from the previous year may participate in pan-European tournaments 
such as the UEFA Champions League, operated by the Union of European Football 
Associations. A Premier League team might play a league game one week, 
and an FA Cup game against a team from a lower-level league the next, followed 
by an EFL Cup game against a team in the EFL, and then a fourth game might 
be against a team from across Europe in the Champions League. The promotion 
and relegation system is generally used to determine membership of leagues. 
Most commonly, a pre-determined number of teams that finish the bottom 
of a league or division are automatically dropped down, or relegated, to 
a lower level for the next season. They are replaced by teams who are promoted 
from that lower tier either by finishing with the best records or by winning 
a playoff. In England, in the 2010–2011 season, the teams Birmingham City, 
Blackpool and West Ham United were relegated from the Premier League to 
the Football League Championship, the second level of English football. 
They were replaced by the top two teams from the second level, Queens Park 
Rangers and Norwich City, both of which won automatic promotion, as well 
as Swansea City (a Welsh club that plays in the English system), which 
won a playoff tournament of the teams that finished third through sixth. 
In the 2011–12 season, the teams Wolverhampton Wanderers, Blackburn, and 
Bolton were relegated to the Championship. They were replaced by Reading, 
Southampton, and West Ham. The two former teams had won automatic promotion, 
while the latter occupied the last promotion spot when they defeated Cardiff 
5-0 on aggregate in the semifinals, and defeated Blackpool 2-1 at the final 
in Wembley Stadium. The system originated in England in 1888 when twelve 
clubs decided to create a professional Football League. It then expanded 
by merging with the Football Alliance in 1892, with the majority of the 
Alliance teams occupying the lower Second Division, due to the divergent 
strengths of the teams. As this differential was overcome over the next 
five years, the winners of the Second Division went into a playoff with 
the worst placed team in the First Division, and if they won, were promoted 
into the top tier. The first club to achieve promotion was Sheffield United, 
which replaced the relegated Accrington F.C. Relegation often has devastating 
financial consequences for club owners who not only lose TV, sponsorship 
and gate income but may also see the asset value of their shares in the 
club collapse. Some leagues offer a "parachute payment" to its relegated 
teams for the following years in order to protect them from bankruptcy. 
If a team is promoted back to the higher tier the following year then the 
parachute payment for the second season is distributed among the teams 
of the lower division.[6] There is of course a corresponding bonanza for 
promoted clubs. The league does not choose which cities are to have teams 
in the top division. For example, Leeds, the fourth-biggest city in England, 
saw their team, Leeds United, relegated from the Premier League to the 
Championship in 2004, and relegated again to the third-tier League One 
in 2007. Leeds will remain without a Premiership team as long as it takes 
for United, or in theory any other local club, to play well enough to be 
promoted into the Premiership. Famously, the French Ligue 1 lacked a team 
from Paris, France's capital and largest city, for some years. Likewise, 
Berlin clubs in the Bundesliga have been rare, due to the richer clubs 
being all located in the former West Germany. As well as having no right 
to being in a certain tier, a club also has no territorial rights to its 
own area. A successful new team in a geographical location can come to 
dominate the incumbents. In Munich, for example, TSV 1860 München were 
initially more successful than the city's current biggest team Bayern München.[7] 
London has 14 professional teams, including five Premier League teams. 
Clubs may be sold privately to new owners at any time, but this does not 
happen often where clubs are based on community membership and agreement. 
Such clubs require agreement from members who, unlike shareholders of corporations, 
have priorities other than money when it comes to their football club. 
For similar reasons, relocation of clubs to other cities is very rare. 
This is mostly because virtually all cities and towns in Europe have a 
football club of some sort, the size and strength of the club usually relative 
to the town's size and importance. Anyone wanting ownership of a high ranked 
club in his native city must buy the local club as it stands and work it 
up through the divisions, usually by hiring better talent. Buying an existing 
top-flight club and moving it to the city is problematic, as the supporters 
of the town's original club are unlikely to switch allegiance to an interloper. 
There have been some cases where existing owners have chosen to relocate 
out of a difficult market, to better facilities, or simply to realize the 
market value of the land that the current stadium is built upon. As in 
the U.S., team relocations have been controversial as supporters of the 
club will protest at its loss. Leagues around the world generally follow 
one or the other of these systems with some variation. Most sport leagues 
in Australia are similar to the North American model, using post-season 
playoffs and no relegation, but without geographical divisions, with the 
most notable examples being the Australian Football League (Aussie rules) 
and National Rugby League (rugby league). Nippon Professional Baseball 
in Japan uses the North American system due to American influence on the 
game. In cricket, the Indian Premier League, launched in 2008, also operates 
on this system. The Super League, which is the top level of rugby league 
in the United Kingdom and France, was run on a franchise basis from 2009 
to 2014,[8] but returned to a promotion/relegation model with the 2015 
season. Another example of a franchised league in European sport is ice 
hockey's Kontinental Hockey League, centered mainly in Russia with teams 
also located in Belarus, China, Croatia, Finland, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and 
Slovakia. The promotion-relegation system is widely used in football around 
the world, notably in Africa and Latin America as well as Europe. The most 
notable variation has developed in Latin America where many countries have 
two league seasons per year, which scheduling allows because many Latin 
American nations lack a national cup competition. Promotion and relegation 
has historically been used in other team sports founded in the United Kingdom, 
such as rugby union, rugby league and cricket. The European model is also 
used in Europe even when the sports were founded in America, showing that 
the league system adopted is not determined by the sport itself, but more 
on the tradition of sports organisation in that region. Sports such as 
basketball in Spain and Lithuania use promotion and relegation. In the 
same vein, the Australian A-League does not use the pyramid structure normally 
found in football, but instead follows the tradition of Australian sports 
having a franchise model and a post-season playoff system that better suits 
a country with a few important central locations where a sport needs to 
ensure there is a team playing with no risk of relegation.[9] Likewise, 
another notable example of "European" sports using the American model is 
rugby union's Super Rugby, featuring 18 franchises. Sixteen of these are 
from the competition's founding countries of South Africa, Australia and 
New Zealand, and the other two are teams from Argentina and Japan that 
joined the competition in 2016. East Asian countries such as Japan, China, 
South Korea and Taiwan have a particular differentiation among leagues: 
"European" sports such as football and rugby use promotion and relegation, 
while "American" sports such as baseball and basketball use franchising 
and minor leagues, with a few differences varying from country to country. 
A similar situation exists in countries in Central America and the Caribbean, 
where football and baseball share several close markets. A major factor 
in the development of the North American closed membership system during 
the 19th Century was the distances between cities, with some teams separated 
by at least halfway across the North American continent, resulting in high 
traveling costs. When the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs 
was established in 1876, its founders judged that in order to prosper, 
they must make baseball's highest level of competition a "closed shop", 
with a strict limit on the number of teams, and with each member having 
exclusive local rights. This guarantee of a place in the league year after 
year would permit each club owner to monopolize fan bases in their respective 
exclusive territories and give them the confidence to invest in infrastructure, 
such as improved ballparks. This in turn would guarantee the revenues needed 
to support traveling across the continent.[10] In contrast, the shorter 
distances between urban areas in England allowed more clubs to develop 
large fan bases without incurring the same travel costs as in North America. 
When The Football League was founded in 1888, it was not intended to be 
a rival of The Football Association but rather the top competition within 
it. The new league was not universally accepted as England's top-calibre 
competition right away. To help win fans of clubs outside The Football 
League, a system was established in which the worst teams at the end of 
each season would need to win re-election against any clubs wishing to 
join. A rival league, the Football Alliance, was then formed in 1889. When 
the two merged in 1892, it was not on equal terms; rather, most of the 
Alliance clubs were put in the new Football League Second Division, whose 
best teams would move up to the First Division in place of its worst teams. 
Another merger, with the top division of the Southern League in 1920, helped 
form the Third Division in similar fashion, firmly establishing the principle
