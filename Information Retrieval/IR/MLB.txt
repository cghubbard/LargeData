Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization, the 
oldest of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States 
and Canada. A total of 30 teams now play in the American League (AL) and 
National League (NL), with 15 teams in each league. The AL and NL operated 
as separate legal entities from 1901 and 1876 respectively. After cooperating 
but remaining legally separate entities since 1903, the leagues merged 
into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball in 2000.[6] 
The organization also oversees Minor League Baseball, which comprises about 
240 teams affiliated with the Major League clubs. With the World Baseball 
Softball Confederation, MLB manages the international World Baseball Classic 
tournament. Baseball's first professional team was founded in Cincinnati 
in 1869, 30 years after Abner Doubleday supposedly invented the game of 
baseball. The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized 
by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team 
or league to another. The period before 1920 in baseball was known as the 
dead-ball era; players rarely hit home runs during this time. Baseball 
survived a conspiracy to fix the 1919 World Series, which came to be known 
as the Black Sox Scandal. The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s, and 
survived potential downturns during the Great Depression and World War 
II. Shortly after the war, baseball's color barrier was broken by Jackie 
Robinson. The 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the AL and NL, 
then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game 
in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s, 
and media reports began to discuss the use of anabolic steroids among Major 
League players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the 
Mitchell Report, which implicated many players in the use of performance-enhancing 
substances, including at least one player from each team. Today, MLB is 
composed of thirty teams: twenty-nine in the United States and one in Canada. 
Teams play 162 games each season and five teams in each league advance 
to a four-round postseason tournament that culminates in the World Series, 
a best-of-seven championship series between the two league champions that 
dates to 1903. Baseball broadcasts are aired on television, radio, and 
the Internet throughout North America and in several other countries throughout 
the world. MLB has the highest season attendance of any sports league in 
the world with more than 73 million spectators in 2015.[7] MLB is governed 
by the Major League Baseball Constitution. This document has undergone 
several incarnations since 1875, with the most recent revisions being made 
in 2012.[8] Under the direction of the Commissioner of Baseball, MLB hires 
and maintains the sport's umpiring crews, and negotiates marketing, labor, 
and television contracts. MLB maintains a unique, controlling relationship 
over the sport, including most aspects of Minor League Baseball. This is 
due in large part to the 1922 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Federal Baseball 
Club v. National League, which held that baseball is not interstate commerce 
and therefore not subject to federal antitrust law. This ruling has been 
weakened only slightly in subsequent years.[9] The weakened ruling granted 
more stability to the owners of teams and has resulted in values increasing 
at double-digit rates.[9][10] There were several challenges to MLB's primacy 
in the sport between the 1870s and the Federal League in 1916; the last 
attempt at a new major league was the aborted Continental League in 1960.[9] 
The chief executive of MLB is the commissioner, Rob Manfred. The chief 
operating officer is Tony Petitti. There are six executive vice-presidents 
in charge of the following areas: baseball development, business, labor 
relations and human resources, finance, administration (whose vice-president 
is MLB's Chief Information Officer), and baseball operations.[11][12] As 
of November 19, 2013, the MLB website lists only five executive VPs; the 
office of executive VP for labor relations and human resources is not listed.[11] 
The multimedia branch of MLB, which is based in Manhattan, is MLB Advanced 
Media. This branch oversees MLB.com and each of the 30 teams' websites. 
Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds editorial independence 
from the league, but it is under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing 
plan. MLB Productions is a similarly structured wing of the league, focusing 
on video and traditional broadcast media. MLB also owns 67 percent of MLB 
Network, with the other 33 percent split between several cable operators 
and satellite provider DirecTV.[13] It operates out of studios in Secaucus, 
New Jersey, and also has editorial independence from the league.[14] In 
1920, the weak National Commission, which had been created to manage relationships 
between the two leagues, was replaced with the much more powerful Commissioner 
of Baseball, who had the power to make decisions for all of professional 
baseball unilaterally.[15] For 60 years, the American and National Leagues 
fielded eight teams apiece. In the 1960s, MLB expansion added eight teams, 
including the first non-U.S. team (the Montreal Expos). Two teams (the 
Seattle Mariners and the Toronto Blue Jays) were also added in the 1970s. 
From 1969 through 1993, each league consisted of an East and West Division. 
A third division, the Central Division, was added in each league in 1994. 
Through 1996, the two leagues met on the field only during the World Series 
and the All-Star Game. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 
1997.[16] In March 1995, two new franchises—the Arizona Diamondbacks and 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now known simply as the Tampa Bay Rays)—were awarded 
by MLB, to begin play in 1998. This addition brought the total number of 
franchises to 30. In early 1997, MLB decided to assign one new team to 
each league: Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL. The original 
plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, 
with 5 in each division). In order for every team to be able to play daily, 
this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the 
entire season. However, it was unclear at the time if interleague play 
would continue after the 1998 season, as it had to be approved by the players' 
union. For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should 
continue to have an even number of teams; one existing club would have 
to switch leagues. The Milwaukee Brewers agreed in November 1997 to move 
from the AL to the NL, thereby making the NL a 16-team league.[17] Later, 
when the Houston Astros changed ownership prior to the 2013 season, the 
team moved from the NL Central to the AL West,[18][19] resulting in both 
leagues having three divisions of five teams each and allowing all teams 
to have a more balanced schedule.[18] Interleague play is now held throughout 
the season.[18] In 2000, the AL and NL were dissolved as legal entities, 
and MLB became a single, overall league de jure, similar to the National 
Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and National 
Hockey League (NHL)—albeit with two components called "leagues" instead 
of "conferences." The same rules and regulations are used in both leagues, 
with one exception: the AL operates under the designated hitter rule, while 
the NL does not.[20] This difference in rules between leagues is unique 
to MLB; the other sports leagues of the U.S. and Canada have one set of 
rules for all teams. An asterisk (*) denotes a relocation of a franchise. 
See respective team articles for more information. In the 1860s, aided[how?] 
by the Civil War, "New York"-style baseball expanded into a national game 
and spawned baseball's first governing body, The National Association of 
Base Ball Players. The NABBP existed as an amateur league for 12 years. 
By 1867, more than 400 clubs were members. Most of the strongest clubs 
remained those based in the northeastern U.S. For professional baseball's 
founding year, MLB uses the year 1869—when the first professional team, 
the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was established.[51] A schism developed between 
professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the Cincinnati 
club. The NABBP split into an amateur organization and a professional organization. 
The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, often known 
as the National Association (NA), was formed in 1871.[52] Its amateur counterpart 
disappeared after only a few years.[53] The modern Chicago Cubs and Atlanta 
Braves franchises trace their histories back to the National Association 
of Professional Base Ball Players in the 1870s.[54] In 1876, the National 
League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (later known as the National League 
or NL) was established after the NA proved ineffective. The league placed 
its emphasis on clubs rather than on players. Clubs could now enforce player 
contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs 
were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting 
scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league 
championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort 
was made to curb gambling on games, which was leaving the validity of results 
in doubt. The first game in the NL—on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at the 
Jefferson Street Grounds, Philadelphia)—is often pointed to as the beginning 
of MLB.[2][55] The early years of the NL were tumultuous, with threats 
from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated "reserve 
clause", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitor 
leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly. The most successful 
was the American Association (1882–1891), sometimes called the "beer and 
whiskey league" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to 
spectators. For several years, the NL and American Association champions 
met in a postseason championship series—the first attempt at a World Series. 
The two leagues merged in 1892 as a single 12-team NL, but the NL dropped 
four teams after the 1899 season. This led to the formation of the American 
League in 1901 under AL president Ban Johnson, and the resulting bidding 
war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes. 
The war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball 
world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball 
leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. A new National 
Association was formed to oversee these minor leagues.[56] While the NA 
continues to this day (known as Minor League Baseball), at the time Ban 
Johnson saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might expand 
in other territories and threaten his league's dominance. After 1902, the 
NL, AL, and NA signed a new National Agreement which tied independent contracts 
to the reserve-clause contracts. The agreement also set up a formal classification 
system for minor leagues, the forerunner of today's system that was refined 
by Branch Rickey.[57] Several other early defunct baseball leagues are 
officially considered major leagues, and their statistics and records are 
included with those of the two current major leagues. These include the 
AA, the Union Association (1884),[58] the Players' League (1890),[59] and 
the Federal League (1914–1915).[60][61] Both the UA and AA are considered 
major leagues by many baseball researchers[who?] because of the perceived 
high caliber of play and the number of star players featured. Some researchers[who?] 
dispute the major-league status of the UA by pointing out that franchises 
came and went and that the St. Louis club was deliberately "stacked"; the 
St. Louis club was owned by the league's president and it was the only 
club that was close to major-league caliber.[62] The period between 1900 
and 1919 is commonly called the "dead-ball era." Games of this era tended 
to be low scoring and were often dominated by pitchers, such as Walter 
Johnson, Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Mordecai Brown, and Grover Cleveland 
Alexander. The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball 
itself. The baseball used American rather than the modern Australian wool 
yarn and was not wound as tightly as it would become later, affecting the 
distance that it would travel.[63] More significantly, balls were kept 
in play until they were mangled, soft and sometimes lopsided: a baseball 
cost three dollars, equal to $41.02 today (in inflation-adjusted U.S. dollars), 
and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls. Fans were expected to 
throw back fouls and (rare) home runs. Baseballs also became stained with 
tobacco juice, grass, and mud, and sometimes the juice of licorice, which 
some players would chew for the purpose of discoloring the ball.[64] Also, 
pitchers could manipulate the ball through the use of the spitball. (In 
1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a grandfather 
clause). Additionally, many ballparks had large dimensions, such as the 
West Side Grounds of the Chicago Cubs, which was 560 feet (170 m) to the 
center field fence, and the Huntington Avenue Grounds of the Boston Red 
Sox, which was 635 feet (194 m) to the center field fence, thus home runs 
were rare, and "small ball" tactics such as singles, bunts, stolen bases, 
and the hit-and-run play dominated the strategies of the time.[65] Hitting 
methods like the Baltimore Chop were used to increase the number of infield 
singles.[66] On a successful Baltimore chop, the batter hits the ball forcefully 
into the ground, causing it to bounce so high that the batter reaches first 
base before the ball can be fielded and thrown to the first baseman.[67] 
The adoption of the foul strike rule in the early twentieth century quickly 
sent baseball from a high-scoring game to one where scoring runs became 
a struggle. Prior to the institution of this rule, foul balls were not 
counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with 
no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the 
batter. In 1901, the NL adopted the foul strike rule, and the AL followed 
suit in 1903.[68] After the 1919 World Series between the Chicago White 
Sox and Cincinnati Reds, baseball was rocked by allegations of a game fixing 
scheme known as the Black Sox Scandal. Eight players—Joe Jackson, Eddie 
Cicotte, Claude "Lefty" Williams, George "Buck" Weaver, Arnold "Chick" 
Gandil, Fred McMullin, Charles "Swede" Risberg, and Oscar "Happy" Felsch—intentionally 
lost the World Series in exchange for a ring worth $100,000.[69] Despite 
being acquitted, all were permanently banned from Major League Baseball.[70] 
Baseball's popularity increased in the 1920s and 1930s. The 1920 season 
was notable for the death of Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians. Chapman, 
who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later, became 
the only MLB player to die of an on-field injury, a tragedy which led directly 
to both leagues requiring the placing into play new, white baseballs whenever 
a ball became scuffed or dirty, helping bring the "dead-ball" era to an 
end. The following year, the New York Yankees made their first World Series 
appearance.[71] By the end of the 1930s, the team had appeared in 11 World 
Series, winning eight of them.[72] Yankees slugger Babe Ruth had set the 
single season home run record in 1927, hitting 60 home runs; a few years 
earlier, Ruth had set the same record with 29 home runs.[73] Affected by 
the difficulties of the Great Depression, baseball's popularity had begun 
a downward turn in the early 1930s. By 1932, only two MLB teams turned 
a profit. Attendance had fallen, due at least in part to a 10% federal 
amusement tax added to baseball ticket prices. Baseball owners cut their 
rosters from 25 men to 23 men, and even the best players took pay cuts. 
Team executives were innovative in their attempts to survive, creating 
night games, broadcasting games live by radio and rolling out promotions 
such as free admission for women. Throughout the period of the Great Depression, 
no MLB teams moved or folded.[74] The onset of World War II created a significant 
shortage of professional baseball players, as more than 500 men left MLB 
teams to serve in the military. Many of them played on service baseball 
teams that entertained military personnel in the US or in the Pacific. 
MLB teams of this time largely consisted of young men, older players, and 
those with a military classification of 4F, indicating mental, physical, 
or moral unsuitability for service. Men like Pete Gray, a one-armed outfielder, 
got the chance to advance to the major leagues. However, MLB rosters did 
not include any black players through the end of the war.[75] Black players, 
many of whom served in the war, were still restricted to playing Negro 
league baseball.[76] Wartime blackout restrictions, designed to keep outdoor 
lighting at low levels, caused another problem for baseball. These rules 
limited traveling and night games to the point that the 1942 season nearly 
had to be cancelled.[76] On January 14, 1942, MLB Commissioner Kenesaw 
Mountain Landis wrote a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
and pleaded for the continuation of baseball during the war in hopes for 
a start of a new major league season. President Roosevelt responded, "I 
honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going. 
There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours 
and harder than ever before. And that means that they ought to have a chance 
for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than 
before."[77] With the approval of President Roosevelt, spring training 
began in 1942 with few repercussions. The war interrupted the careers of 
stars including Stan Musial, Ted Williams, and Joe DiMaggio, but baseball 
clubs continued to field their teams.[78] Branch Rickey, president and 
general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began making efforts to introduce 
a black baseball player to the previously all-white professional baseball 
leagues in the mid-1940s. He selected Jackie Robinson from a list of promising 
Negro league players. After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to "turn 
the other cheek" to any racial antagonism directed at him, Rickey agreed 
to sign him to a contract for $600 a month. In what was later referred 
to as "The Noble Experiment", Robinson was the first black baseball player 
in the International League since the 1880s, joining the Dodgers' farm 
club, the Montreal Royals, for the 1946 season.[79] The following year, 
the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. On April 15, 1947, 
Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 
26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Black baseball 
fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning 
the Negro league teams that they had followed exclusively. Robinson's promotion 
met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspaper writers 
and white major league players. Manager Leo Durocher informed his team, 
"I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like 
a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's 
more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, 
I will see that you are all traded."[80] After a strike threat by some 
players, NL President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler 
let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. Robinson 
received significant encouragement from several major league players, including 
Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese who said, "You can hate a man for many reasons. 
Color is not one of them."[81] That year, Robinson won the inaugural Major 
League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (separate NL and AL Rookie of 
the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).[82] Less than three months 
later, Larry Doby became the first African-American to break the color 
barrier in the American League with the Cleveland Indians.[83] The next 
year, a number of other black players entered the major leagues. Satchel 
Paige was signed by the Indians and the Dodgers added star catcher Roy 
Campanella and Don Newcombe, who was later the first winner of the Cy Young 
Award for his outstanding pitching.[84] Major League Baseball banned the 
signing of women to contracts in 1952, and that ban lasted until 1992.[85] 
From 1903 to 1953, the two major leagues consisted of two eight-team leagues. 
The 16 teams were located in ten cities, all in the northeastern and midwestern 
United States: New York City had three teams and Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, 
and St. Louis each had two teams. St. Louis was the southernmost and westernmost 
city with a major league team. The longest possible road trip, from Boston 
to St. Louis, took about 24 hours by railroad. In 1953, the NL's Boston 
Braves became the Milwaukee Braves. In 1954, the St. Louis Browns became 
the Baltimore Orioles. In 1955, the Philadelphia Athletics became the Kansas 
City Athletics. Baseball experts consider the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers' 
boss Walter O'Malley to be "perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's 
early expansion era."[86] Before the 1958 Major League Baseball season, 
he moved the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles.[87] When O'Malley moved the 
Dodgers from Brooklyn, he appeared on the cover of Time.[88] O'Malley was 
also influential in persuading the rival New York Giants to move west to 
become the San Francisco Giants. The Giants were already suffering from 
slumping attendance records at their aging ballpark, the Polo Grounds. 
Had the Dodgers moved out west alone, the St. Louis Cardinals—1,600 mi 
(2,575 km) away[89][90]—would have been the closest NL team. The joint 
move made West Coast road trips economical for visiting teams.[91] O'Malley 
invited San Francisco Mayor George Christopher to New York to meet with 
Giants owner Horace Stoneham.[91] Stoneham was considering moving the Giants 
to Minnesota,[92] but he was convinced to join O'Malley on the West Coast 
at the end of 1957. The meetings between Stoneham, Christopher and O'Malley 
occurred against the wishes of Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick.[93] 
The dual moves were successful for both franchises—and for MLB.[87] The 
Dodgers set a single-game MLB attendance record in their first home appearance 
with 78,672 fans.[91] In 1961, the first Washington Senators franchise 
moved to Minneapolis–St. Paul to become the Minnesota Twins. Two new teams 
were added to the American League at the same time: the Los Angeles Angels 
(who soon moved from downtown L.A. to nearby Anaheim) and a new Washington 
Senators franchise. The NL added the Houston Astros and the New York Mets 
in 1962. The Astros (known as the "Colt .45s" during their first three 
seasons) became the first southern major league franchise since the Louisville 
Colonels folded in 1899 and the first franchise to be located along the 
Gulf Coast. The Mets established a reputation for futility by going 40–120 
during their first season of play in the nation's media capital—and by 
playing only a little better in subsequent campaigns—but in their eighth 
season (1969) the Mets became the first of the 1960s expansion teams to 
play in the post-season, culminating in a World Series title over the heavily-favored 
Baltimore Orioles. In 1966, the major leagues moved to the "Deep South" 
when the Braves moved to Atlanta. In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved 
west to become the Oakland Athletics. In 1969, the American and National 
Leagues both added two expansion franchises. The American League added 
the Seattle Pilots (who became the Milwaukee Brewers after one disastrous 
season in Seattle) and the Kansas City Royals. The NL added the first Canadian 
franchise, the Montreal Expos, as well as the San Diego Padres. In 1972, 
the second Washington Senators moved to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex 
to become the Texas Rangers. In 1977, baseball expanded again, adding a 
second Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, as well as the Seattle Mariners. 
Subsequently, no new teams were added and no teams moved until the 1990s. 
In 1993, the NL added the Florida Marlins in the Miami area and the Colorado 
Rockies in Denver. In 1998, the Brewers switched leagues by joining the 
National League and two new teams were added: the NL's Arizona Diamondbacks 
in Phoenix and the American League's Tampa Bay Devil Rays in St. Petersburg, 
Florida. After the 2001 season, the team owners voted in favor of contraction. 
Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about 
contraction, but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two 
teams that came closest to folding under the plan. Plans for MLB contraction 
were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that 
required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium. MLB owners 
agreed to hold off on reducing the league's size until at least 2006.[94] 
The Montreal Expos became the first franchise in over three decades to 
move when they became the Washington Nationals in 2005. This move left 
Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to the United 
States capital city after a 33-year absence. This franchise shift, like 
many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city which had been 
previously abandoned. Not counting the short-lived Federal League, Montreal 
is the only city granted an MLB franchise since 1901 that does not currently 
host a team. By the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting 
had swung in favor of the pitchers. In 1968—later nicknamed "the year of 
the pitcher"[95]—Boston Red Sox player Carl Yastrzemski won the American 
League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in the history 
of Major League Baseball.[96] Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain won 31 
games, making him the only pitcher to win 30 games in a season since Dizzy 
Dean in 1934.[97] St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Bob Gibson achieved 
an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just 1.12.[98] Following 
these pitching performances, in December 1968 the MLB Playing Rules Committee 
voted to reduce the strike zone from knees to shoulders to top of knees 
to armpits and lower the pitcher's mound from 15 to 10 inches, beginning 
in the 1969 season.[99] In 1973 the American League, which had been suffering 
from much lower attendance than the National League, sought to increase 
scoring even further by initiating the designated hitter (DH) rule.[100] 
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, as baseball expanded, NFL football had 
been surging in popularity, making it economical for many of these cities 
to build multi-purpose stadiums instead of single-purpose baseball fields. 
Because of climate and economic issues many of these facilities had playing 
surfaces made from artificial turf, as well as the oval designs characteristic 
of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football.[101] This often 
resulted in baseball fields with relatively more foul territory than older 
stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, 
putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power, 
since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home 
runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs. 
Teams began to be built around pitching—particularly their bullpens—and 
speed on the basepaths. Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker 
and bounced higher, so it became easier to hit ground balls "in the hole" 
between the corner and middle infielders. Starting pitchers were no longer 
expected to throw complete games; it was enough for a starter to go 6–7 
innings and turn the game over to the team's closer, a position which grew 
in importance over these decades. As stolen bases increased, home run totals 
dropped. After Willie Mays hit 52 home runs in 1965, only one player (George 
Foster) reached that mark until the 1990s. Routinely in the late 1990s 
and early 2000s, baseball players hit 40 or 50 home runs in a season, a 
feat that was considered rare even in the 1980s. It has since become apparent 
that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using steroids 
and other performance-enhancing drugs. Many modern baseball theorists believe 
that the need of pitchers to combat the rise in power could lead to a pitching 
revolution at some point. New pitches, such as the mysterious[102] gyroball, 
could shift the balance of power back to the defensive side. Several pitches 
have changed the game of baseball, including the slider in the 1950s and 
60s and the split-fingered fastball in the 1970s to 90s. Since the 1990s, 
the changeup has made a resurgence, being thrown masterfully by pitchers 
such as Trevor Hoffman, Greg Maddux, Jamie Moyer, Tom Glavine, Johan Santana, 
Pedro Martínez and Tim Lincecum. Recently, pitchers such as Lincecum, Jonathan 
Sánchez, and Ubaldo Jiménez have been throwing changeups with a split-finger 
grip, creating a dropping movement, dubbed the "split change."[103][104][105][106] 
A baseball uniform is a type of uniform worn by baseball players, and by 
some non-playing personnel, such as field managers and coaches. It is worn 
to indicate the person's role in the game and—through the use of logos, 
colors, and numbers—to identify the teams and their players, managers, 
and coaches.[107] Traditionally, home uniforms display the team name on 
the front, while away uniforms display the team's home location. In modern 
times, however, exceptions to this pattern have become common, with teams 
using their team name on both uniforms.[108] Most teams also have one or 
more alternate uniforms, usually consisting of the primary or secondary 
team color on the vest instead of the usual white or gray.[108] In the 
past few decades throwback uniforms have become popular.[109] The New York 
Knickerbockers were the first baseball team to use uniforms, taking the 
field on April 4, 1849, in pants made of blue wool, white flannel shirts 
(jerseys) and straw hats.[110][111][112] Caps and other types of headgear 
have been a part of baseball uniforms from the beginning.[113][114] Baseball 
teams often wore full-brimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was 
no official rule regarding headgear.[115] Under the 1882 uniform rules, 
players on the same team wore uniforms of different colors and patterns 
that indicated which position they played.[116] In the late 1880s, the 
Detroit Wolverines and Washington Nationals of the National League and 
the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the American Association were the first to 
wear striped uniforms.[117] By the end of the 19th century, teams began 
the practice of having two different uniforms, one for when they played 
at home in their own baseball stadium and a different one for when they 
played away (on the road) at the other team's ballpark.[108] It became 
common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants 
with a gray or solid (dark) colored vest when away.[108] By 1900, both 
home and away uniforms were standard across the major leagues.[118] Spring 
training is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start 
of the regular season. Spring training allows new players to audition for 
roster and position spots, and gives existing team players practice time 
prior to competitive play. The teams are divided into the Cactus League[119] 
and the Grapefruit League.[120] Spring training has always attracted fan 
attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the 
weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually 
coincides with spring break for many college students. Autograph seekers 
also find greater access to players during spring training. Spring training 
typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid February and running 
until just before the season opening day, traditionally the first week 
of April. As pitchers benefit from a longer training period, pitchers and 
catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team.[121] 
The current MLB regular season, consisting of 162 games per team, typically 
begins on the first Sunday in April and ends on the first Sunday in October. 
Each team's schedule is typically organized into three-game series, with 
occasional two- or four-game series.[122] Postponed games or continuations 
of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. 
A team's series are organized into homestands and road trips that group 
multiple series together. Teams generally play games five to seven days 
per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day. Frequently, 
games are scheduled at night. Sunday games are generally played during 
the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior 
to a Monday night game. In addition, teams will play day games frequently 
on Opening Day, holidays, and getaway days. Each team plays 19 games against 
each of its four divisional opponents. It plays one home series and one 
away series, amounting to six or seven games, against the 10 other teams 
in its league. A team also plays one of the divisions in the other league, 
rotating each year, with two opponents in a three-game home series, two 
in a three-game away series, and one with four games split between home 
and away. Furthermore, each team has an interleague "natural rival" (in 
many cases its counterpart in the same metro area) with which it plays 
two home games and two away games each year. With an odd number of teams 
in each league (15), it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague 
play for most days in the season, except when two or more teams have a 
day off. Each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season, usually 
with just one interleague game per day, but for one weekend in late May 
all teams will participate in an interleague series. Use of the DH rule 
is determined by the home team's league rules. Before 2013 interleague 
play was structured differently: there would be one weekend in mid-May 
and another period consisting typically of the last two-thirds of June 
in which all teams played interleague games (save for two NL teams each 
day), and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates. Over 
the course of a season, teams compete for one of the five playoff berths 
in their league. They can win one of these berths by either winning their 
division, or by capturing a wild card spot.[123] After the conclusion of 
the 162-game season, an additional tie-breaking game (or games) may be 
needed to determine postseason participation.[124] In early-to-mid July, 
just after the midway point of the season, the Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game is held during a four-day break from the regular-season schedule. 
The All-Star game features a team of players from the American League (AL)—led 
by the manager of the previous AL World Series team—and a team of players 
from the National League (NL), similarly managed, in an exhibition game. 
From 1959 to 1961, two games were held each season, one was held in July 
and one was held in August. The designated-hitter rule was used in the 
All-Star game for the first time in 1989. Following games used a DH when 
the game was played in an AL ballpark. Since 2010, the DH rule has been 
in effect regardless of venue.[125] The first official All-Star Game was 
held as part of the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois, and was the 
idea of Arch Ward, then sports editor for The Chicago Tribune.[126] Initially 
intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the 
game an annual one. Ward's contribution was recognized by Major League 
Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the "Arch Ward Trophy", given to 
the All-Star Game's Most Valuable Player each year.[127] (In 2002, this 
was renamed the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award.) Beginning in 
1947, the eight position players in each team's starting lineup have been 
voted into the game by fans.[128] The fan voting was discontinued after 
a 1957 ballot-box-stuffing scandal in Cincinnati: seven of the eight slots 
originally went to Reds players, two of whom were subsequently removed 
from the lineup to make room for Willie Mays and Hank Aaron. Fan voting 
was reinstated in 1970 and has continued ever since, including Internet 
voting in recent years. The 2002 contest in Milwaukee controversially ended 
in an 11-inning tie. Since 2003, the league which wins the All-Star game 
gets home-field advantage in the World Series: the league champion hosts 
the first two games at its own ballpark as well as the last two (if necessary). 
The National League did not win an All-Star game and thus gain home-field 
advantage until 2010; it was able to overcome this disadvantage and win 
in three of the seven World Series from 2003 to 2009.[129][130] MLB All-Star 
game players from both leagues have worn their team uniforms at the game 
with one exception. In the 1933 All-Star Game, the National League All-Star 
Team members wore special gray uniforms with "National League" written 
in navy blue letters across the front of the jersey.[131][132] When the 
regular season ends after the first Sunday in October (or the last Sunday 
in September), ten teams enter the postseason playoffs. These ten teams 
consist of six teams that are division champions by earning the best regular 
season overall win-loss record for their respective divisions, and four 
who are "wild-card" teams that are each one of two teams in their respective 
leagues who have earned the best regular season win-loss record, but are 
not division champions. Four rounds of series of games are played to determine 
the champion: Within each league, the division winners are the #1, #2 and 
#3 seeds, based on win–loss records. The team with the best record among 
non division winners will be the first wildcard and the #4 seed. The team 
with the second best record among non division winners will be the second 
wildcard and the #5 seed. In the wildcard round, the #5 seed will play 
at the #4 seed in a one-game playoff. For the division series, the matchup 
will be the #1 seed against the Wild Card Game winner and the #2 seed against 
the #3 seed.[133] The team belonging to the league that won the mid-season 
All-Star Game receives home-field advantage in the World Series. Because 
each postseason series is split between the home fields of the two teams, 
home-field advantage does not usually play a large role in the postseason 
unless the series goes to its maximum number of games, giving one team 
an additional game at home. However, the first two games of a postseason 
series are hosted by the same team. That team may have an increased chance 
of starting the series with two wins,[134] thereby gaining some momentum 
for the rest of the series.[135] Use of the DH rule in the World Series 
is determined by the home team's league rules.[136] Since 1986 an All-Star 
team from MLB is sent to a biennial end-of-the-season tour of Japan, dubbed 
as MLB Japan All-Star Series, playing exhibition games in a best-of format 
against the All-Stars from Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) or recently 
as of 2014 their national team Samurai Japan. In 2008, MLB played the MLB 
China Series in the People's Republic of China. It was a series of two 
spring-training games between the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
The games were an effort to popularize baseball in China.[137] MLB played 
the MLB Taiwan Series in Taiwan in November 2011. It was a series of five 
exhibition games played by a team made up of MLB players called the MLB 
All-Stars and the Chinese Taipei National Team. The MLB All-Stars swept 
the series, five games to zero.[138] At the end of the 2011 season, it 
was announced that the Seattle Mariners and the Oakland Athletics would 
play their season openers in Japan.[139] In October 2013, Phil Rogers of 
the Chicago Tribune wrote that MLB was considering postseason all-star 
tours in Taiwan and Korea; baseball is increasing in popularity in both 
countries.[140] The Arizona Diamondbacks opened the 2014 season against 
Los Angeles Dodgers on March 22–23 in Australia.[141] The teams played 
each other at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground, which has a seating capacity 
of 46,000. The two games represented the first MLB regular-season play 
held in that country. The games counted as home games for the Diamondbacks, 
so they played 79 home games at Chase Field.[142] Together with the World 
Baseball Softball Confederation, MLB sponsors the World Baseball Classic, 
an international baseball tournament contested by national teams. In 1998, 
both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa hit more than the long-standing single-season 
MLB record of 61 home runs. Barry Bonds topped the record in 2001 with 
73 home runs. McGwire, Bonds and Sosa became the subjects of speculation 
regarding the use of performance-enhancing substances. McGwire later admitted 
that he used a steroid hormone that was still legal in baseball during 
the 1998 season.[144] Baseball's original steroid testing policy, in effect 
from 2002 to 2005, provided for penalties ranging from a ten-game suspension 
for a first positive test to a one-year suspension for a fourth positive 
test. Players were tested at least once per year, with the chance that 
several players could be tested many times per year.[145] A 2006 book, 
Game of Shadows by San Francisco Chronicle investigative reporters Lance 
Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, chronicled alleged extensive use of performance 
enhancers, including several types of steroids and growth hormone by baseball 
superstars Barry Bonds, Gary Sheffield, and Jason Giambi. Former Senate 
Majority Leader George Mitchell was appointed by Selig on March 30, 2006[146] 
to investigate the use of performance-enhancing drugs in MLB. The appointment 
was made after several influential members of the U.S. Congress made negative 
comments about both the effectiveness and honesty of MLB's drug policies 
and Commissioner Selig.[147] The day before the Mitchell Report was to 
be released in 2007, Selig said, "I haven't seen the report yet, but I'm 
proud I did it."[148][149] The report said that after mandatory random 
testing began in 2004, HGH treatment for athletic enhancement became popular 
among players, as HGH is not detectable in tests. It pointed out that HGH 
is likely a placebo with no performance-enhancing effects.[150] The report 
included substance use allegations against at least one player from each 
MLB team.[151] According to ESPN, some people questioned whether Mitchell's 
director role with the Boston Red Sox created a conflict of interest, especially 
because no "prime [Sox] players were in the report."[152] The report named 
several prominent Yankees who were parts of World Series clubs; there is 
a long-running and fierce Yankees–Red Sox rivalry. Former U.S. prosecutor 
John M. Dowd brought up Mitchell's conflict of interest,[153] but he later 
said that the former senator had done a good job.[154] Mitchell acknowledged 
that his "tight relationship with Major League Baseball left him open to 
criticism",[155] but he said that readers who examine the report closely 
"will not find any evidence of bias, of special treatment of the Red Sox".[155] 
On January 10, 2013, MLB and the players union reached an agreement to 
add random, in-season HGH testing. They also agreed to implement a new 
test to reveal the use of testosterone for the 2013 season.[156] The current 
MLB drug policy provides for an 80-game suspension for a first positive 
test, a 162-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime 
suspension for a third positive test.[157] In 2009, allegations surfaced 
against Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz, and Manny Ramirez received a 50-game 
suspension after testing positive for banned substances. In early April 
2011, Ramirez retired from baseball rather than face a 100-game suspension 
for his second positive steroid test.[158] He would later unretire, having 
the suspension dropped to 50 games, and would serve those in 2012. Several 
networks televise baseball games, including Fox, ESPN, and MLB Network. 
Since 2008, Fox Sports has broadcast MLB games on Fox Saturday Baseball 
throughout the entire season; Fox previously only broadcast games from 
May to September.[159] Fox also holds rights to the All-Star Game each 
season. Fox also alternates League Championship Series broadcasts, broadcasting 
the American League Championship Series (ALCS) in odd-numbered years and 
the National League Championship Series (NLCS) in even-numbered years. 
Fox broadcasts all games of the World Series. ESPN continues to broadcast 
MLB games through 2013 as well, beginning with national Opening Day coverage.[160] 
ESPN broadcasts Sunday Night Baseball, Monday Night Baseball, Wednesday 
Night Baseball, and Baseball Tonight. ESPN also has rights to the Home 
Run Derby at the All-Star Game each July.[149] TBS airs Sunday afternoon 
regular season games (non-exclusive) nationally. In 2007, TBS began its 
exclusive rights to any tiebreaker games that determine division or wild 
card champions; it also airs exclusive coverage of the Division Series 
round of the playoffs.[161] TBS carries the League Championship Series 
that are not included under Fox's television agreement; TBS shows the NLCS 
in odd-numbered years and the ALCS in even-numbered years.[162] In January 
2009, MLB launched the MLB Network, featuring news and coverage from around 
the league, and airing 26 live games in the 2009 season.[163] Each team 
also has local broadcasts for all games not carried by Fox on Saturdays 
or ESPN on Sunday nights. These games are typically split between a local 
broadcast television station and a local or regional sports network (RSN), 
though some teams only air local games through RSNs or through their own 
team networks. As Canada only contains one team, Sportsnet broadcasts Toronto 
Blue Jays games nationally.[164] The channel is owned by Rogers Communications, 
who is also the parent company of the Blue Jays.[164] Sportsnet also televises 
Fox's Saturday afternoon games, the All-Star Game, playoff games, and the 
World Series.[164][165] In April 2011, TSN2 began carrying ESPN Sunday 
Night Baseball in Canada.[166] MLB has several blackout rules.[167] A local 
broadcaster has priority to televise games of the team in their market 
over national broadcasters. For example, at one time TBS showed many Atlanta 
Braves games nationally and internationally in Canada. Fox Sports Networks 
also show many games in other areas. If the Braves played a team that FSN 
or another local broadcaster showed, the local station will have the broadcast 
rights for its own local market, while TBS would have been blacked out 
in the same market during the game. A market that has a local team playing 
in a weekday ESPN or ESPN2 game and is shown on a local station will see 
ESPNews, or, in the past, another game scheduled on ESPN or ESPN2 at the 
same time (if ESPN or ESPN2 operates a regional coverage broadcasting and 
operates a game choice), or will be subject to an alternative programming 
feed.[168] MLB's streaming Internet video service is also subject to the 
same blackout rules. ESPN Radio holds national broadcast rights and broadcasts 
Sunday Night Baseball weekly throughout the season in addition to all playoff 
games.[169] The rights to the World Series are exclusive to ESPN. In addition, 
each team employs its own announcers, who broadcast during the regular 
season. Most teams operate regional networks to cover their fan bases; 
some of these supposedly regional networks (such as the New York Yankees 
Radio Network) have a national reach with affiliates located across the 
United States.[170] Major League Baseball has an exclusive rights deal 
with XM Satellite Radio, which includes the channel MLB Network Radio and 
live play-by-play of all games.[171] Many teams also maintain a network 
of stations that broadcast their games in Spanish; the former Montreal 
Expos broadcast their games in both English and French. MLB games are also 
broadcast live on the internet. All television and radio broadcasts of 
games are available via subscription to MLB.tv at Major League Baseball's 
website, MLB.com, and radio-only broadcasts are also available via subscription 
to MLB.com Gameday Audio.[172] Blackout rules are still applied for live 
television broadcasts, but not radio broadcasts. ESPN Deportes televises 
a large number of MLB games in Spanish throughout Latin America.[173] Wapa 
2 airs games in Puerto Rico, including spring training games and most of 
the World Baseball Classic games involving the team from Puerto Rico.[174] 
In Brazil, ESPN Brasil has exclusive rights on TV (ESPN and ESPN+) and 
Internet (WatchESPN),[175] with Fox Sports also broadcasting some games. 
Five in the United Kingdom previously screened MLB games, including the 
All-Star Game and the postseason games, on Sunday and Wednesday usually 
starting at 1 am BST. Most recently, Johnny Gould and Josh Chetwynd presented 
MLB on Five on that station.[176] The channel covered baseball beginning 
on its opening night in 1997, but for financial reasons, the decision was 
made not to pick up MLB for the 2009 season.[177] ESPN UK show live and 
recorded games several times a week—it is available with BT Sport and (on 
a subscriber-basis) Virgin Media in the UK.[178] ESPN America televised 
a large number of games in the UK and dozens of other countries; in May 
2013, ESPN announced that it would shut down the channel on July 31, 2013.[179][180] 
In Australia, MLB games are regularly shown on ESPN Australia (subscription).[181] 
In the Middle East & North Africa, MLB games are broadcast on beIN Sports
