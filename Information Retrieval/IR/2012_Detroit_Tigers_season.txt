The 2012 Detroit Tigers season was the team's 112th season. On October 
1, the Tigers clinched the AL Central title, the club's first repeat title 
since 1934–1935.[1] They finished the regular season 88–74. They defeated 
the Oakland Athletics in the American League Divisional Series, 3 games 
to 2.[2] It was the Tigers' second consecutive ALDS win. The Tigers went 
on to sweep the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series 
[3] before being swept themselves by the San Francisco Giants in the World 
Series.[4] On April 27, 2012, an intoxicated Delmon Young was arrested 
for third-degree assault and an "aggravated harassment hate crime" in New 
York City after a confrontation with a group of Jewish tourists in which 
he made antisemitic remarks outside of their hotel before a series against 
the Yankees. Later in the day, Young issued a statement apologizing for 
his actions. On April 30, Young was suspended without pay for seven games, 
and ordered to undergo therapy.[27] The Tigers sent three players to the 
All-Star Game: pitcher Justin Verlander (fifth appearance), third baseman 
Miguel Cabrera (seventh appearance, third with the Tigers), and first baseman 
Prince Fielder (fourth appearance, first with the Tigers). Fielder was 
voted in as a starter,[38] and won the Home Run Derby with 28 home runs, 
the second time in his career and his first with the Tigers.[39] Fielder 
also won a Silver Slugger Award.[32] Infielders Outfielders Other batters
