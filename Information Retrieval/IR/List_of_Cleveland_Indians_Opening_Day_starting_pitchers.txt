The Cleveland Indians are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Cleveland, Ohio. They play in the American League Central division. 
The first game of the new baseball season is played on Opening Day, and 
being named the starter that day is an honor, which is often given to the 
player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[1] though 
there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not 
start on Opening Day.[2] Since joining the league in 1901, the Indians 
have used 58 different Opening Day starting pitchers which includes the 
Opening Day starting pitchers from the Bluebirds and the Naps. They have 
a record of 58 wins and 54 losses in their Opening Day games.[3][4] The 
Indians have played in three different home ball parks, League Park from 
1901 through 1946, Cleveland Stadium from 1932 to 1993, and Progressive 
Field since 1994. From 1934 through 1946 some games were played at League 
Park and some at Cleveland Stadium. They had a record of 11 wins and 4 
losses in Opening Day games at League Park, 9 wins and 13 losses at Cleveland 
Stadium and 2 wins and 4 losses at Progressive Field, for a total home 
record in Opening Day games of 22 wins and 21 losses.[3] Their record in 
Opening Day away games is 35 wins and 35 losses.[3][5][6] Bob Feller has 
the most Opening Day starts for the Indians, with seven. Stan Coveleski 
had six Opening Day starts for the Indians, Bob Lemon and C.C. Sabathia 
each had five Opening Day starts, and Addie Joss, Willie Mitchell, Gaylord 
Perry and Charles Nagy each had four.[3] Several Baseball Hall of Famers 
have made Opening Day starts for the Indians, including Feller, Coveleski, 
Lemon, Joss, Gaylord Perry, Dennis Eckersley and Early Wynn.[7] Brothers 
Jim Perry and Gaylord Perry each made Opening Day starts for the Indians.[3][8][9] 
Jim Perry started on Opening Day in 1961 and Gaylord Perry made Opening 
Day starts in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975.[3] The Indians have played in 
the World Series five times. They won in 1920 and 1948, and lost in 1954, 
1995 and 1997.[10] Coveleski was the Opening Day starting pitcher in 1920, 
Feller in 1948, Wynn in 1954, Dennis Mart√≠nez in 1995 and Nagy in 1997. 
The Indians won all five Opening Day games in those seasons.[3] The Indians 
and the Toronto Blue Jays currently hold the record for the longest Opening 
Day game in Major League history. They set that record on Opening Day 2012, 
when the game lasted 16 innings. This broke the previous record of 15 innings 
between the Indians and the Detroit Tigers in 1960.[11] General Specific
