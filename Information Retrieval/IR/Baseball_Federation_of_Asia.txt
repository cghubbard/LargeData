The Baseball Federation of Asia is the governing body of the sport of baseball 
in Asia. The federation is governed by the International Baseball Federation. 
The birth of Baseball Federation of Asia goes back to 1954 when the 2nd 
Asian Games was held in Manila, the Philippines. Four countries/regions 
such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines organized a committee 
aiming at establishing Baseball Federation of Asia, and May 7th of the 
same year witnessed the commencement of BFA. American expatriate Charles 
Chick Parsons of the Philippines was elected as the first president of 
Baseball Federation of Asia. The BFA became inactive for eight years following 
the 1975 Asian Baseball Championship. At the sidelines of the FEMBA World 
Baseball Championship in Tokyo in 1980, the executives of BFA discussed 
about resuming the activity of the federation. The Asian Baseball Championship 
was later resumed in 1983 which was held in Seoul. The membership of the 
federation grew as more Asian nations were admitted to the BFA.[2] The 
total number of BFA members at the present time is 24, and 1 non-member 
observer State (Vietnam). ◆East Asia ◆South-East Asia ◆South Asia ◆Central
