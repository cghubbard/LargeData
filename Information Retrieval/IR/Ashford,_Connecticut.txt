Ashford is a town in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. It is

camp and conference center.[4] President George Washington, returning from 
his tour of the country in the fall of 1789, was chagrined to be involuntarily 
abandoned in the village on a Sunday. It was contrary to law to hire a 
conveyance on that day, which was observed by villagers, to Washington's 
great annoyance.[5] New Ashford in Massachusetts is named after Ashford,
