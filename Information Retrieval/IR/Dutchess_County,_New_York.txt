Dutchess County is a county located in the southeastern portion of the 
U.S. state of New York. As of the 2010 census, the population was 297,488.[1] 
The county seat is Poughkeepsie.[2] The county was created in 1683 and 
later organized in 1713.[3] Dutchess County is part of the New York-Newark-Jersey 
City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is located in the Mid-Hudson 
Region of the Hudson Valley. Prior to Anglo-Dutch settlement, what is today 
Dutchess County was a leading center for the native Wappinger peoples. 
They had their council-fire at what is now present-day Fishkill Hook, and 
also held gatherings along the Danskammer.[4][clarification needed] On 
November 1, 1683, the Province of New York established its first twelve 
counties, with Dutchess County being one of them. Its boundaries at that 
time included the present Putnam County, and a small portion of the present 
Columbia County (the towns of Clermont and Germantown). The county was 
named for Mary of Modena, Duchess of York, second wife of James, Duke of 
York (later James II, King of England). Dutchess is an archaic form of 
the word duchess.[5] The Province of New York and the Connecticut Colony 
negotiated an agreement on November 28, 1683, establishing their border 
as 20 miles (32 km) east of the Hudson River, north to Massachusetts. The 
61,660 acres (249.5 km2) east of the Byram River making up the Connecticut 
Panhandle were granted to Connecticut, in recognition of the wishes of 
the residents. In exchange, Rye was granted to New York, along with a 1.81-mile 
(2.91 km) wide strip of land running north from Ridgefield to Massachusetts 
alongside the New York counties of Westchester, Putnam then Dutchess, known 
as "The Oblong". The eastern half of the stub of land in northeast Dutchess 
County containing Rudd Pond and Taconic State Park is the northernmost 
extension of The Oblong.[6] Until 1713, Dutchess was administered by Ulster 
County. On October 23, 1713 Queen Anne gave permission for Dutchess County 
to elect its own officers from among their own population including a Supervisor, 
Tax Collector, Tax Assessor and Treasurer. In 2013, Dutchess County celebrated 
its 300th anniversary of democracy based upon a legislative resolution 
sponsored by County Legislator Michael Kelsey from Salt Point. In 1812, 
Putnam County was detached from Dutchess.[7] In the twelve years 1685–1697 
lawful patents had been granted securing for their purchasers every foot 
of Hudson River shoreline in the original county. Three additional patents, 
to 1706, laid claim to the remaining interior lands.[citation needed] From 
1683 to 1715 most of the settlers in Dutchess County were Dutch. Many of 
these moved in from Albany and Ulster Counties. They settled along the 
Fishkill River and in the areas that are now Poughkeepsie and Rhinebeck.[8] 
From 1715 to 1730 most of the new settlers in Dutchess county were Germans. 
From 1730 until 1775 New Englanders were the main new settlers in Dutchess 
County.[9] Franklin D. Roosevelt lived in his family home in Hyde Park, 
overlooking the Hudson River. His family's home is now the Home of Franklin 
D. Roosevelt National Historic Site, managed by the National Park Service. 
Prior to the 1960s, Dutchess County was primarily agricultural. Since then 
the southwestern part (from Poughkeepsie south and From the Taconic State 
Parkway westward) of the county has developed into a largely residential 
area, suburban in character, with many of its residents commuting to jobs 
in New York City. The northern and eastern regions of the county remain 
rural with large farmlands but at the same time developed residences used 
during the summer and or on weekends by people living in the New York City 
urban area.[10] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total 
area of 825 square miles (2,140 km2), of which 796 square miles (2,060 km2) 
is land and 30 square miles (78 km2) (3.6%) is water.[11] Dutchess County 
is located in southeastern New York State, between the Hudson River on 
its west and the New York–Connecticut border on its east, about halfway 
between the cities of Albany and New York City. It contains two cities: 
Beacon and Poughkeepsie. The terrain of the county is mostly hilly, especially 
in the Hudson Highlands in the southwestern corner and the Taconic Mountains 
to the northeast. Some areas nearer the river are flatter. The highest 
point in the county is the summit of Brace Mountain, in the Taconics, at 
2,311 feet (704 m) above sea level. The lowest point is sea level, along 
the Hudson River. Almost a half mile long border exists with Berkshire 
County, Massachusetts in the extreme northern end of the county. As of 
the census[17] of 2000, there were 280,150 people, 99,536 households, and 
69,177 families residing in the county. The population density was 350 
people per square mile (135/km²). There were 106,103 housing units at an 
average density of 132 per square mile (51/km²). The racial makeup of the 
county was 83.66% White (80.3% non-Hispanic whites),[18] 9.32% Black or 
African American, 0.22% Native American, 2.52% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 
2.37% from other races, and 1.89% from two or more races. 6.45% were Hispanic 
or Latino of any race. 22.0% were of Italian, 16.9% Irish, 11.3% German 
and 6.7% English ancestry according to Census 2000. 88.3% spoke English 
and 4.8% Spanish Based on the Census Ancestry tallies, including people 
who listed more than one ancestry, Italians were the largest group in Dutchess 
County with 60,645. Irish came in a very close second at 59,991. In third 
place were the 44,915 Germans who barely exceeded the 44,078 people not 
in the 105 specifically delineated ancestry groups.[19] There were 99,536 
households out of which 34.50% had children under the age of 18 living 
with them, 55.50% were married couples living together, 10.30% had a female 
householder with no husband present, and 30.50% were non-families. 24.60% 
of all households were made up of individuals and 9.00% had someone living 
alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 
2.63 and the average family size was 3.16. In the county the age distribution 
of the population shows 25.10% under the age of 18, 9.40% from 18 to 24, 
30.20% from 25 to 44, 23.20% from 45 to 64, and 12.00% who were 65 years 
of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there 
were 100.10 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.20 
males. The median income for a household in the county was $53,086, and 
the median income for a family was $63,254. Males had a median income of 
$45,576 versus $30,706 for females. The per capita income for the county 
was $23,940. About 5.00% of families and 7.50% of the population were below 
the poverty line, including 8.50% of those under age 18 and 6.50% of those 
age 65 or over. The per capita income and average home values have increased 
noticeably in recent years mainly due to affluent residents relocating 
from nearby and expensive Westchester County, New York. In recent years, 
there has been a large influx of people that have relocated from New York 
City, mainly from the Borough of The Bronx. The decrease in population 
between 1810 and 1820 was due the separation of Putnam County from Dutchess 
in 1812. The county is governed via a county executive and a county legislature. 
The county legislature consists of 25 members each elected from single 
member districts. The Cities of Beacon and Poughkeepsie; Towns of Fishkill, 
Hyde Park, Pine Plains, Poughkeepsie, Rhinebeck, Red Hook, and East Fishkill 
and Villages of Millerton, Wappingers Falls, Millbrook, and Fishkill have 
their own Police departments. The remainder of the county is patrolled 
by the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office and New York State Police. The 
New York State Police Troop K headquarters is located in Millbrook. The 
current composition of the County Legislature is 16 Republicans, 7 Democrats, 
and 2 Independents. The current county executive is Republican Marcus Molinaro. 
The county executive is elected in a countywide vote. The majority of the 
county is located in New York's 19th congressional district, which is currently 
being represented by Republican Chris Gibson. Dutchess County has historically 
leaned Republican due to its affluence and large suburban swaths; it has 
voted for Democratic presidential candidates only four times – 1964, 1996, 
2008 and 2012. The largely suburban southern towns of Dutchess tend to 
be more conservative, while the small villages and rural areas of the northern 
tier have become somewhat more liberal. Almost all elected officials are 
Republican, but in the 2012 Presidential Election, Barack Obama carried 
Dutchess with 53% of the vote. The county has voted for the winning candidate 
for the presidency since 1996. Amtrak has stations in Rhinecliff, a small 
hamlet in the Town of Rhinebeck, and Poughkeepsie, with both stations being 
served by Empire Service trains as well as other trains that run along 
the line. The latter station is the terminus of the Hudson Line of the 
Metro-North Railroad. The Hudson Line also has station stops in New Hamburg 
(a hamlet of the town of Poughkeepsie) and Beacon. The Harlem Line, on 
the eastern side of the county, has station stops in Pawling, Wingdale, 
Dover Plains, and two stops in Wassaic (one along the Tenmile River and 
the other the namesake terminus of that line). Public transportation in 
Dutchess County is handled by the Dutchess County Department of Mass Transit, 
branded publicly as the LOOP system. Outside of the urbanized area of the 
county, most service is limited. The City of Poughkeepsie operates its 
own limited system as well. Privately run lines connect Poughkeepsie to 
New Paltz and Beacon to Newburgh. For intercity bus service, Adirondack 
Trailways and Short Line Bus also operate some service through Poughkeepsie, 
Rhinebeck, and the southern part of the county. The last time service ran 
outside that area was in the late-1990s when Peter Pan/Bonanza ran service 
to New York City in the eastern part of the county. The Dutchess County 
Airport, located in the town of Wappinger, is a general aviation facility 
which once had commercial service. The closest commercial airport, Stewart 
International Airport, is located across the Hudson River in Newburgh. 
Also located in the county is Sky Park Airport, a public use general aviation 
facility in Red Hook, New York.[20] Dutchess County Chamber of Commerce 
holds an annual hot air balloon launch typically in the first week of July. 
The main launch sites are along the Hudson River. As many as 20 balloons 
participate in the event. The Hudson Valley Renegades are a minor league 
baseball team affiliated with the Tampa Bay Rays. The team is a member 
of the New York–Penn League, and play at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill. 
The Hudson Valley Bears are one of four founding members of the Eastern 
Professional Hockey League (EPHL). They play their home games at the Mid-Hudson 
Civic Center in Poughkeepsie. The Hudson Valley Hawks was a team in the 
former National Professional Basketball League. The team's home court was 
at Beacon High School, in Beacon. N.B.: Cities, Towns and Villages are
