In organized sports, match fixing occurs as a match is played to a completely 
or partially pre-determined result, violating the rules of the game and 
often the law. The most common reason is to obtain a payoff from gamblers, 
but players may also intentionally perform poorly to gain a future advantage, 
such as a better draft pick or an easier opponent in a play-off. A player 
might also play poorly to rig a handicap system. Match fixing, when motivated 
by gambling, requires contacts (and normally money transfers) between gamblers, 
players, team officials, and/or referees. These contacts and transfers 
can sometimes be found, and lead to prosecution by the law or the sports 
league(s). In contrast, losing for future advantage is internal to the 
team and very hard to prove. Often, substitutions made by the coach designed 
to deliberately increase the team's chances of losing (such as having key 
players sit out, using minimal or phantom injuries as a excuse), rather 
than ordering the players actually on the field to intentionally underperform, 
are cited as the main factor in cases where this has been alleged. Match 
fixing generally refers to fixing the final result of the game. Another 
form of match fixing, known as spot fixing, involves fixing small events 
within a match which can be gambled upon, but which are unlikely to prove 
decisive in determining the final result of the game. Other names for match 
fixing include game fixing, race fixing, sports fixing or hippodroming. 
Where the sporting competition in question is a race then the incident 
is referred to as race fixing. Games that are deliberately lost are sometimes 
called thrown games. When a team intentionally loses a game, or does not 
score as high as it can, to obtain a perceived future competitive advantage, 
the team is often said to have tanked the game instead of having thrown 
it. In pool hustling, tanking is known as dumping. In sports where a handicap 
system exists and is capable of being abused, tanking is known as sandbagging. 
The major motivations behind match fixing are gambling and future team 
advantage. There may be financial gain through agreements with gamblers. 
The most infamous example of this in North America was the Black Sox Scandal 
of 1919, in which several members of the Chicago White Sox conspired with 
gamblers to fix the World Series. One of the best-known examples of gambling-related 
race fixing (in motorsports) is the 1933 Tripoli Grand Prix, in which the 
winning number of the lottery was determined by the number of the race-winning 
car. One ticket holder held the number belonging to Achille Varzi, contacted 
him and agreed to share the winning should he win. Varzi contacted other 
drivers who agreed to share the money if they deliberately lost. Despite 
a poor start, Varzi won the race after his opponents deliberately underperformed 
throughout the race.[1] According to Sportradar, a company that monitors 
the integrity of sports events on behalf of sports federations, as many 
as 1% of the matches they monitor are likely to be fixed.[2] By monitoring 
the pre-match betting markets it is possible to detect planned match fixing. 
It is also possible to detect on-going match manipulation by looking at 
the in-game betting markets. Several federations have employed services 
that provide such systems for detecting match manipulation.[2] Prior to 
the 2016 MLB season, Major League Baseball (MLB) hired Genius Sports, a 
sports technology company specialising in integrity, to monitor the betting 
patterns on all of their games.[3] In addition, several federations run 
integrity tours where players and officials participate in educational 
workshops on how match fixing work and how they are prevented.[4] Many 
sports have tournaments where the result of one round determines their 
opponent in the next round. As a result, by tanking a match, a team can 
face an easier opponent in the next round, making them more likely to win. 
In the National Basketball Association, there have also been allegations[by 
whom?] of teams tanking games to finish in sixth rather than fifth place 
in the conference standings, thus enabling the team in question to evade 
a possible playoff match with the conference's top seed until the final 
round of playoffs in that conference (for more details see single-elimination 
tournament). Additionally, the NBA is the only one of the four major professional 
sports leagues of the United States in which home advantage in the playoffs 
is based strictly on regular-season record without regard to seeding. This 
led to (unproven) allegations of late-season tanking by the 2005–06 Los 
Angeles Clippers in order to finish sixth instead of fifth in their conference; 
because of the league's playoff hosting rules, the Clippers would have 
home advantage in the 3–6 matchup but not the 4–5 matchup. Following that 
season, the NBA changed its playoff format so that the best second-place 
team in each conference would be able to obtain up to the #2 seed should 
it have the second-best conference record.[5] On occasion, a National Football 
League team has also been accused of throwing its final regular-season 
game in an attempt to "choose" its possible opponent in the subsequent 
playoffs. Perhaps the most notable example of this was when the San Francisco 
49ers, who had clinched a playoff berth, lost their regular-season finale 
in 1988 to the Los Angeles Rams, thereby knocking the New York Giants (who 
had defeated the 49ers in the playoffs in both 1985 and 1986, also injuring 
49er quarterback Joe Montana in the latter year's game) out of the postseason 
on tiebreakers; after the game, Giants quarterback Phil Simms angrily accused 
the 49ers of "laying down like dogs."[6] In the Canadian Football League, 
since the introduction of the cross-over rule Western teams have been occasionally 
accused of tanking near the end of the season in situations where a loss 
would cause them to finish fourth place in their division and where such 
a finish was still good enough to secure a berth in the league's East Division 
playoffs. In recent years, the East has often been viewed to be a weaker 
division than the West; however, if any Western team has actually attempted 
such a strategy up to and included the 2014 season, it has not paid significant 
dividends for them since Western cross-over teams have only won one Eastern 
playoff game and have never advanced to the Grey Cup championship game 
from the Eastern bracket. A more recent example of possible tanking occurred 
in the ice hockey competition at the 2006 Winter Olympics. In Pool B, Sweden 
was to face Slovakia in the last pool match for both teams. Sweden coach 
Bengt-Åke Gustafsson publicly contemplated tanking against Slovakia, knowing 
that if his team won, their quarterfinal opponent would either be Canada, 
the 2002 gold medalists, or the Czech Republic, 1998 gold medalists. Gustafsson 
would tell Swedish television "One is cholera, the other the plague." Sweden 
lost the match 3–0; the most obvious sign of tanking was when Sweden had 
a five-on-three powerplay with five NHL stars—Peter Forsberg, Mats Sundin, 
Daniel Alfredsson, Nicklas Lidström, and Fredrik Modin—on the ice, and 
failed to put a shot on goal. (Sports Illustrated writer Michael Farber 
would say about this particular powerplay, "If the Swedes had passed the 
puck any more, their next opponent would have been the Washington Generals.") 
If he was seeking to tank, Gustafsson got his wish; Sweden would face a 
much less formidable quarterfinal opponent in Switzerland. Canada would 
lose to Russia in a quarterfinal in the opposite bracket, while Sweden 
went on to win the gold medal, defeating the Czechs in the semifinals.[7] 
The 1998 Tiger Cup – an international football tournament contested by 
countries in Southeast Asia – saw an example of two teams trying to lose 
a match. The tournament was hosted by Vietnam and the eight countries competing 
were split into two groups of four. The top two in each group advanced 
to the semi-finals with the winners playing the runners-up of the other 
group. In the first group Singapore won the group with Vietnam finishing 
second. This meant that the winners of the second group would have to travel 
to Hanoi to play the host nation in the national stadium on their national 
day whilst the runners-up would face Singapore in Ho Chi Minh City where 
the final group match was taking place. As the two teams involved - Thailand 
and Indonesia - had both already qualified for the semi-finals it was in 
their interest to lose the match and finish in second place. As the game 
progressed neither side seemed particularly concerned with scoring whilst 
the defending was lackadaisical. As the match entered stoppage time the 
Indonesian defender Mursyid Effendi scored an own goal (overcoming the 
efforts of the opposition players to stop him). Both teams were fined $40,000 
and Effendi was banned from international football for life. The 2012 Summer 
Olympics saw at least two examples of actual or potential tanking of this 
type: In February 2015, two girls' basketball teams representing Nashville-area 
Riverdale and Smyrna High Schools were found to be tanking a consolation 
match of their district tournament.[12] The winner of the game would enter 
the same side of the regional tournament bracket as defending state champion[12] 
Blackman High School (ranked as one of the country's top 10 teams by some 
national publications), setting up a potential match in the regional semifinals.[13] 
The loser would avoid Blackman until the regional final, a game whose participants 
would both advance to the sectional tournament (one step short of the state 
tournament).[13] During this game: The Tennessee Secondary School Athletic 
Association, which governs high school sports in the state, took a very 
dim view of this escapade, banning both teams from further postseason play, 
fining the two schools a total of $1,500, and placing both teams on probation 
through the 2015–16 school year.[12] Most top-level sports leagues in North 
America and Australia hold drafts to allocate young players to the league's 
teams. The order in which teams select players is often the inverse of 
their standings in the previous season. As a result, a team may have a 
significant incentive to tank games to secure a higher pick in the league's 
next draft, and a number of leagues have changed their draft rules to remove 
(or at least limit) potential incentives to tank. From 1966 to 1984, the 
NBA used a coin flip between the teams with the worst records in each of 
the league's two conferences to determine the recipient of the top pick. 
In the 1983–84 season, several teams were accused of deliberately losing 
games in an attempt to gain a top position in the 1984 draft, which would 
eventually produce four Hall of Fame players. As a result of this, the 
NBA established a draft lottery in advance of the 1985 draft, involving 
all teams that did not make the playoffs in the previous season.[14][15] 
Even though the current lottery gives the team with the worst record only 
a 25% chance at the top pick (with that team guaranteed no worse than the 
fourth pick), there can still be some incentive for a team to tank. In 
an interview for ESPN The Magazine just before the start of the 2013–14 season, 
an NBA general manager who chose to remain anonymous (though speculated 
to be either Rob Hennigan of the Orlando Magic or Ryan McDonough of the 
Phoenix Suns[16]) stated that his team would try to tank that season to 
have the best chance at a top pick in the 2014 NBA draft, which was anticipated 
to be one of the deepest in recent league history. The GM explained how 
he got the team's owners and the coach to agree to it while trying to keep 
it a secret from the players.[17] The Australian Football League, the main 
competition of Australian rules football, has used a system of priority 
draft picks since 1993, with poorly performing teams receiving extra selections 
at or near the start of the draft. Prior to 2012, a team automatically 
received a priority pick if its win-loss record met pre-defined eligibility 
criteria. However, that system led to accusations of tanking by several 
clubs—most notably by Melbourne in 2009 (the club was found not guilty, 
but the head coach and general manager were found guilty on related charges). 
Since 2012, priority picks are awarded at the discretion of the AFL Commission, 
the governing body.of both the AFL and the overall sport. Until the 2014–15 
NHL season, the National Hockey League assured the last place team of at 
least the second position in its entry draft, with the first overall pick 
being subject to a draft lottery among the five worst teams. As NHL drafts 
typically include only one NHL-ready prospect, if any at all, in any given 
year (most others must continue developing in junior ice hockey or the 
minor leagues for several years before reaching the NHL), this rudimentary 
lottery has historically been enough of a deterrent to avoid deliberate 
tanking. However, in 2014–15, two elite prospects widely considered to 
be “generational talents,” Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel, were projected 
to enter the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, thus ensuring the last place team at 
least one of the two prospects. This was most prominent with the Buffalo 
Sabres, whose fans openly rooted against their team in the hopes they would 
clinch last place in the league for much of the season (the Sabres themselves 
denied they were tanking and openly criticized their fans for suggesting 
the notion).[18] Beginning in 2015–16, the top three picks in the draft 
will be subject to lottery, with all fourteen teams that did not qualify 
for the playoffs eligible to win the picks. NFL teams have been accused 
of tanking games to obtain a more favorable schedule the following season; 
this was especially true between 1977 and 1993, when a team finishing last 
in a five-team division would get to play four of its eight non-division 
matches the next season against other last-place teams. In addition to 
the match fixing that is committed by players, coaches and/or team officials, 
it is not unheard of to have results manipulated by corrupt referees. Since 
2004, separate scandals have erupted in prominent sports leagues in Portugal,[19] 
Germany (Bundesliga scandal), Brazil (Brazilian football match-fixing scandal) 
and the United States (see Tim Donaghy scandal), all of which concerned 
referees who fixed matches for gamblers. Many sports writers have speculated 
that in leagues with high player salaries, it is far more likely for a 
referee to become corrupt since their pay in such competitions is usually 
much less than that of the players. On December 2, 1896, former Old West 
lawman Wyatt Earp refereed the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey boxing match, promoted 
as the Heavyweight Championship of the World.[20] Earp was chosen as referee 
by the National Athletic Association the afternoon of the match after both 
managers refused to agree on a choice. In the eighth round of a fight dominated 
by Fitzsimmons, Sharkey suddenly went down, clutching his groin, yelling 
foul. Referee Earp conferred with both corners for a few seconds before 
he disqualified Fitzsimmons for a foul that virtually no one saw.[20] Fitzsimmons 
went to court to attempt to stop Shakey from taking the purse, but failed 
when the court ruled that the match was illegal and it had no jurisdiction.[21] 
Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee was arrested in Portland, Oregon. 
He had been accused of treating Sharkey to make it appear that he had been 
fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee said, "I fixed Sharkey up to look as if he had 
been fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, but 
I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons 
was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for 
my part in the affair."[22] Match fixing does not necessarily involve deliberately 
losing a match. Occasionally, teams have been accused of deliberately playing 
to a draw or a fixed score where this ensures some mutual benefit (e.g. 
both teams advancing to the next stage of a competition.) One of the earliest 
examples of this sort of match fixing in the modern era occurred in 1898 
when Stoke City and Burnley intentionally drew in that year's final "test 
match" so as to ensure they were both in the First Division the next season. 
In response, the Football League expanded the divisions to 18 teams that 
year, thus permitting the intended victims of the fix (Newcastle United 
and Blackburn Rovers) to remain in the First Division. The "test match" 
system was abandoned and replaced with automatic relegation. A more recent 
example occurred in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, West Germany played Austria 
in the last match of group B. A West German victory by 1 or 2 goals would 
result in both teams advancing; any less and Germany was out; any more 
and Austria was out (and replaced by Algeria, who had just beaten Chile). 
West Germany attacked hard and scored after 10 minutes. Afterwards, the 
players then proceeded to just kick the ball around aimlessly for the remainder 
of the match. Algerian supporters were so angered that they waved banknotes 
at the players, while a German fan burned his German flag in disgust.[23] 
By the second half, the ARD commentator Eberhard Stanjek refused any further 
comment on the game, while the Austrian television commentator Robert Seeger 
advised viewers to switch off their sets. As a result, FIFA changed its 
tournament scheduling for subsequent World Cups so that the final pair 
of matches in each group are played simultaneously. Another example took 
place on the next-to-last weekend of the 1992–93 Serie A season. Milan 
entered their match with Brescia needing only a point to secure the title 
ahead of crosstown rivals Inter, while Brescia believed a point would be 
enough for them to avoid relegation. In a 2004 retrospective on the "dodgiest 
games" in football history, two British journalists said about the match, 
"For over 80 minutes, the two teams engaged in a shameful game of cat-and-mouse, 
in which the cat appeared to have fallen asleep and the mouse was on tranquilisers." 
Milan scored in the 82nd minute, but Brescia "mysteriously found themselves 
with a huge overlap" and equalised two minutes later. The 1–1 draw gave 
Milan their title, but in the end did not help Brescia; other results went 
against them and they suffered the drop.[23] In knockout competitions where 
the rules require drawn matches to be replayed, teams have sometimes been 
accused of intentionally playing one or more draws so as to ensure (a) 
replay(s). In this case, the motive is usually financial since the ensuing 
replay(s) would typically be expected to generate additional revenue for 
the participating teams. One notorious example of this particular type 
of alleged fix was the 1909 Scottish Cup Final, which sparked a riot after 
being played twice to a draw. On several occasions, "creative" use of tie-breaking 
rules have allegedly led teams to play less than their best. An example 
occurred in the 2004 European Football Championship. Because unlike FIFA, 
UEFA takes the result of the game between the two tied teams (or in a three-way 
tie, the overall records of the games played with the teams in question 
only) into consideration before overall goal difference when ranking teams 
level on points, a situation arose in Group C where Sweden and Denmark 
played to a 2–2 draw, which was a sufficiently high scoreline to eliminate 
Italy (which had lower-scoring draws with the Swedes and Danes) regardless 
of Italy's result with already-eliminated Bulgaria. Although Italy beat 
Bulgaria by only one goal to finish level with Sweden and Denmark on five 
points, and would hypothetically have been eliminated using the FIFA tie-breaker 
too, some Italian fans bitterly contended that the FIFA tie-breaker would 
have motivated their team to play harder and deterred their Scandinavian 
rivals from, in their view, at the very least half-heartedly playing out 
the match after the score became 2–2. The exact same situation happened 
to Italy in 2012, leading to many pre-game complaints from Italy, who many 
commentators suggested were right to be concerned because of their own 
extensive experience in this area.[24] But Spain-Croatia ended up 1–0, 
and the Italians went through. The FIFA tie-breaker, or any goal-differential 
scheme, can cause problems, too. There have been incidents (especially 
in basketball) where players on a favored team have won the game but deliberately 
ensured the quoted point spread was not covered (see point shaving). Conversely, 
there are cases where a team not only lost (which might be honest) but 
lost by some large amount, perhaps to ensure a point spread was covered, 
or to grant some non-gambling related favor to the victor. Perhaps the 
most famous alleged example was the match between Argentina and Peru in 
the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Argentina needed a four-goal victory to advance 
over Brazil, an enormous margin at this level of competition, especially 
since Argentina had a weak offense (6 goals in 5 games) and Peru a stout 
defence (6 goals allowed in 5 games). Yet somehow, Argentina won 6–0. Much 
was made over political collusion,[25] that the Peruvian goalkeeper was 
born in Argentina, and that Peru was dependent on Argentinian grain shipments, 
but nothing was ever proven.[26] Although the Denmark-Sweden game above 
led to calls for UEFA to adopt FIFA's tiebreaking formula for future tournaments, 
it is not clear if this solves the problem; the Argentina-Peru game shows 
a possible abuse of the FIFA tie-breaker. Proponents of the UEFA tie-breaker 
argue that it reduces the value of blow-outs, whether these be the result 
of a much stronger team running up the score or an already-eliminated side 
allowing an unusually large number of goals. Perhaps the most infamous 
incident occurred in December 1983 when Spain, needing to win by eleven 
goals to qualify for the Euro 1984 ahead of the Netherlands, defeated Malta 
by a score of 12–1 on the strength of nine second half goals. Especially 
in international football, such lopsided results are seen as unsavoury, 
even if they are honest. If anything, these incidents serves as evidence 
that the FIFA tie-breaker can cause incentives to perpetrate a fix in some 
circumstances, the UEFA tie-breaker in others. A player can concede with 
the understanding that the opponent will share the prize equally with him 
or her. Depending on the game, this can lead to disqualification.[27] On 
occasion, teams tank games as a protest against actions in earlier games. 
The most lopsided professional football match in history, AS Adema 149–0 
SO l'Emyrne, was a result of SO l'Emyrne intentionally losing the game 
in protest against the referee's action in a previous game. Bookmakers 
in the early 21st century accept bets on a far wider range of sports-related 
propositions than ever before. Thus, a gambling-motivated fix might not 
necessarily involve any direct attempt to influence the outright result, 
especially in team sports where such a fix would require the co-operation 
(and prerequsitely, the knowledge) of many people, and/or perhaps would 
be more likely to arouse suspicion. Fixing the result of a more particular 
proposition might be seen as less likely to be noticed. For example, disgraced 
former National Basketball Association referee Tim Donaghy has been alleged 
to have perpetrated some of his fixes by calling games in such a manner 
as to ensure more points than expected were scored by both teams, thus 
affecting "over-under" bets on the games whilst also ensuring that Donaghy 
at least did not look to be outright biased. Also, bets are increasingly 
being taken on individual performances in team sporting events, which in 
turn has seen the rise of a phenomenon known as spot fixing, although it 
is currently unlikely that enough is bet on an average player to allow 
someone to place a substantial wager on them without being noticed. One 
such attempt was described by retired footballer Matthew Le Tissier, who 
in 2009 admitted that while he was playing with Southampton FC back in 
1995 he tried (and failed) to kick the ball out of play right after the 
kick-off of a Premier League match against Wimbledon FC so that a group 
of associates would collect on a wager made on an early throw-in.[28] Similarly, 
in 2010 Pakistani cricket players were accused of committing specific no 
ball penalties for the benefit of gamblers.[29] This scandal centred on 
three Pakistani players accepting bribes from a bookmaker, Mazhar Majeed 
during the Lord's test match against England. Following investigations 
by the News of the World and Scotland Yard, on 1 November 2011, Majeed, 
Pakistan's captain, Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were found 
guilty of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and to accept corrupt payments. 
As a result, all three of the players were banned by the International 
Cricket Council (ICC); Butt for ten years, Asif for seven and Amir for 
five.[30] On 3 November 2011, jail terms were handed down of 30 months 
for Butt, one year for Asif, six months for Amir and two years eight months 
for Majeed.[31] Whenever any serious motivation for teams to manipulate 
results becomes apparent to the general public, there can be a corresponding 
effect on betting markets as honest gamblers speculate in good faith as 
to the chance such a fix might be attempted. Some bettors might choose 
to avoid wagering on such a fixture while others will be motivated to wager 
on it, or alter the bet they would otherwise place. Such actions will invariably 
affect odds and point spreads even if there is no contact whatsoever between 
teams and the relevant gambling interests. The rise of betting exchanges 
has allowed such speculation to play out in real time. Since gambling pre-dates 
recorded history it comes as little surprise that evidence of match fixing 
is found throughout recorded history. The ancient Olympic Games were almost 
constantly dealing with allegations of athletes accepting bribes to lose 
a competition[32] and city-states which often tried to manipulate the outcome 
with large amounts of money. These activities went on despite the oath 
each athlete took to protect the integrity of the events and the severe 
punishment sometimes inflicted on those who were caught. Chariot racing 
was also dogged by race fixing throughout its history. By the end of the 
19th century gambling was illegal in most jurisdictions, but that did not 
stop its widespread practice. Boxing soon became rife with fighters "taking 
a dive", likely due to boxing being a sport involving individual competitors, 
which makes its matches much easier to fix without getting caught. Baseball 
also became plagued by match fixing despite efforts by the National League 
to stop gambling at its games. Matters finally came to a head in 1919 when 
eight members of the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series (see Black 
Sox Scandal). In an effort to restore confidence, Major League Baseball 
established the office of the Baseball Commissioner, and one of Kenesaw 
Mountain Landis's first acts was to ban all involved players for life. 
MLB Rule 21 prohibits players from participating in any form of betting 
on baseball games, and a lifetime ban on betting on a player's own games. 
A poster with Rule 21 must be posted on all professional baseball clubhouses. 
Yaochō (八百長?) is a Japanese word meaning a cheating activity which is committed 
at places where a match, fight, game, competition, or other contest, is 
held, where the winner and loser are decided in advance by agreement of 
the competitors or related people. It is believed that the word Yaocho 
came from the name ("Chobei") of the owner of a vegetable stand (yaoya) 
during the Meiji period. Created from the first syllable of Yaoya and chobei, 
the word yaocho was created for a nickname of Chobei. Chobei had a friend 
called "Isenoumi Godayu" (7th Isenoumi stablemaster) with whom he played 
the game Igo, who had once been a sumo wrestler "Kashiwado Sogoro" (former 
shikona: "Kyonosato") and now was a "toshiyori" (a stablemaster of sumo). 
Although Chobei was a better Igo player than Isenoumi, he sometimes lost 
games on purpose to please Isenoumi, so that Isenoumi would continue to 
buy merchandise from his shop. Afterward, once people knew of his cheating, 
they started to use yaocho as a word meaning any decision to win/lose a 
match in advance by negotiation etc. with the expectation of secondary 
profit, even though the match seems to be held seriously and fairly. Economists, 
using statistical analysis, have shown very strong evidence of bout fixing 
in sumo wrestling.[33] (See also Match fixing in professional sumo) Most 
of the motive for match fixing is helping each other's ranking to keep 
their salary higher, according to Keisuke Itai. For example, wrestlers 
in jūryō (the second tier) desperately try to avoid finishing the tournament 
with a losing record (7–8 or worse) and exchange or buy the match result 
otherwise their salary would be nothing, literally 0 yen, with the participation 
wage of 150,000 yen every two months if they finish the tournament with 
a losing record, and their ranking would go down to makushita (third level) 
and only participate in seven matches, the lesser ranking from jūryō in 
which one can earn 1,036,000 yen monthly with some prizes and a full 15-match 
tournament. The sumo association appears to make a distinction between 
yaocho (the payment of money to secure a result) and koi-ni-yatta mukiryoku 
zumo (the deliberate performance of underpowered sumo, whereby an opponent 
simply lays a match down without exchange of money). The intricacies of 
Japanese culture, which include subordination of individual gain to the 
greater good, and knowing how to read a situation without the exchange 
of words (i.e. I know my opponent's score, he needs help and I should automatically 
give it to him), mean that the latter is almost readily accepted in the 
sumo world, and is also nigh-impossible to prove.[34] In professional wrestling, 
most matches have predetermined results; however, as it is an open secret 
that professional wrestling is staged, it is not considered match fixing. 
Up until the 1920s, professional wrestling was a legitimate sport. This 
did not endure as professional wrestling became identified with modern 
theatrics or admitted fakery ("kayfabe"), moving away from actual competition. 
The worked nature of the art have made critics consider it an illegitimate 
sport, particularly in comparison to boxing, amateur wrestling, and, in 
more recent times, mixed martial arts. Many individuals began to doubt 
the legitimacy of wrestling after the retirement of Frank Gotch in 1913.[35] 
As wrestling's popularity was diving around the same time that Major League 
Baseball had its own legitimacy issues, wrestling started to take on a 
more worked approach while still appearing as a legitimate sport, beginning 
with the Gold Dust Trio of the 1920s.[35] Even after the formation of the 
National Wrestling Alliance in 1948, wrestling continued to have legitimacy 
issues. Nevertheless, wrestling was still regulated by state athletic commissions 
in the United States well into the 1980s, until Vince McMahon, owner of 
the World Wrestling Federation, convinced the state of New Jersey in 1989 
that wrestling was considered a form of entertainment (or sports entertainment, 
as McMahon used) rather than as a legitimate sport, and that it shouldn't 
be regulated by state athletic commissions.[36] The move was seen as more 
of a relief to those who had questioned wrestling's legitimacy, since at 
least one major company (in this case, the WWF) was now publicly willing 
to admit that wrestling was staged; however, the move did anger many wrestling 
purists.[36] Today, despite the staged aspects of wrestling, it is still 
seen as a legitimate sport in several countries, such as Canada, Japan, 
Mexico, and the United Kingdom, while it is seen as a form of entertainment 
in the United States similar to that of the Harlem Globetrotters. Due to 
the lingering legitimacy issues that surrounded wrestling from the 1910s 
until the 1980s, gambling was generally not allowed on wrestling matches
