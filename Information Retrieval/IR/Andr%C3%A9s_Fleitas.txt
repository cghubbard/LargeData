Andrés Fleitas [flei'-tasz] (November 8, 1916 – December 18, 2011) was 
a professional Cuban baseball catcher and first baseman. Listed at 5' 11", 
175 lb., he batted and threw right handed.[1] Born in Las Villas Province, 
Fleitas came from a baseball family, as his older brother, Ángel Fleitas, 
played briefly for the Washington Senators of the American League.[2] Despite 
never reaching the Major Leagues as his brother did, Fleitas enjoyed a 
solid career in the Cuban Winter League and Minor League Baseball. A member 
of the Cuban national team and two-time Most Valuable Player, he had several 
.300 seasons, and holds the distinction of being the only catcher ever 
to have caught a no-hitter in Caribbean Series history.[3] Prior to his 
professional career in Cuba, Fleitas was a member of the Cuban National 
team that won two Amateur World Series in 1939 and 1942, earning MVP honors 
in the latter victory, after batting a top average of .405.[4] He joined 
the Alacranes de Almendares during the 1942–43 campaign and stayed with 
them nine and a half seasons (1951-52[start]) before joining the Tigres 
de Marianao (1951-52[end]), Leones de la Habana (1952–53, 1953–54) and 
Elefantes de Cienfuegos (1954–55).[3] Fleitas opened 1943 with Double-A 
Jersey City Giants, a New York Giants farm club. He was the primary catcher 
for Jersey City, where future Hall of Famer Gabby Hartnett served as manager 
and backup catcher. Fleitas batted .218 in his rookie minor league season 
and improved to a .260 mark the next year.[5] After playing two seasons 
with the Giants, Fleitas was well on the path to the major leagues with 
the Senators before receiving an offer to play in the Mexican League. By 
that time, the multi-millionaire Jorge Pasquel had begun to raid American 
professional baseball for some of its talent.[6] Pasquel and his four brothers 
spent around fifty million dollars to build the Mexican circuit, offering 
big leaguers and minor leaguers larger salaries, unique gifts, and various 
incentives to play baseball in the newly created league.[6] The Cuban Lázaro 
Salazar, manager of the Industriales de Monterrey, spoke to Pasquel about 
Fleitas, who was offered a $20,000 contract plus $200 for monthly expenses. 
This salary was double that received Fleitas with the Giants. Without hesitation, 
he accepted the offer and moved to Mexico.[7] Fleitas spent three seasons 
with Monterrey, batting over a .300 average each year (.304/.342/.385).[8] 
While the significant increase in salary allowed him to purchase a home 
in Santa Fe,[7] his stay in Mexico effectively nixed any chance he would 
have playing in the majors. In response to Pasquel actions, MLB Commissioner 
Happy Chandler banned all players for five years that left the United States 
for the Mexican League that did not return before his deadline. Only when 
former New York Giants outfielder Danny Gardella threatened to sue the 
Major League Baseball hierarchy, did the owners relent and lift the ban.[6] 
After that, Fleitas played in the Washington Senators minor system from 
1948 through 1953 for Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts (1948–1951) and Class-A 
Havana Cubans (1952–1953), splitting his playing time at first base and 
catching. He later played with the independent Havana Sugar Kings of the 
International League during the 1954 season. In this seven-year period 
he batted for a combined .281 average in 560 games.[5] Interestingly, the 
younger Fleitas joined his brother Ángel during his four-year stint at 
Chattanooga.[5] Fleitas started with Almendares in the 1942–43 season, 
sharing with Mike Guerra for catching duties while also playing at first 
base. He batted a paltry .152 average as a rookie, but raised to .299 during 
his sophomore season. He continued to improve in 1944-45, when he led the 
league with 10 doubles and 29 runs batted in while hitting a solid .291.[3] 
He replaced Guerra as the team's primary catcher during the 1945-46 campaign 
and batted .313 with a second-best 32 RBI, three behind league and MVP 
Alejandro Crespo. He also led the league with 14 doubles and was selected 
to the All-Star team.[3] His most productive season came in the 1946–47 
period, when he posted career numbers with a .316 average, 83 hits and 
69 games played, while leading the league in hits. He formed part of the 
All-Star for a second time and provided an extra effort late in the season.[3] 
That season represented the most significant pennant race in Cuban League 
history. During the last month Almendares began making up a six-game deficit 
to Habana. On February 23, 1947 Habana had a 1½ game lead over Almendares 
with a three-game series remaining against them. Almendares would need 
to win all three to win the league's title. Then, their pitching star Max 
Lanier defeated the Leones, 4–2, in the first game. The next day, reliable 
left-handed Agapito Mayor won a complete-game pitching duel against Fred 
Martin and the Leones by a score of 2–1, being highlighted by Fleitas, 
who tripled the winning run in the 7th inning to obtain the narrow victory. 
Then, Fleitas caught Lanier on only one day of rest to beat Habana 9–2 
in the final game, and Almendares completed the feat. At the end, Fleitas 
won MVP honors, beating out established big leaguers like Bobby Ávila, 
Alex Carrasquel, Sandy Consuegra, George Hausmann, Red Hayworth, Lou Klein, 
Minnie Miñoso, and the aforementioned Gardella and Lanier, among others.[3][9] 
The next two seasons Fleitas posted averages of .236 and .188 respectively, 
while Almendares won easily the 1948–49 title. As the league champions, 
the team represented Cuba in the inaugural Caribbean Series played in Havana 
in 1949. He went 1 for 5 in the Series, while Cuba captured the competition 
with an undefeated record of 6-0.[3] He was greatly improved in the 1949-50 
season, going 81 for 262 for a .309 average in a career-best 68 games, 
helping his team win a second consecutive title and a trip to the 1950 
Series, where he batted 5 for 25 with two runs and three RBI for a disappointing 
Almendares that finished in third place.[3] But Fleitas declined in the 
next two seasons. He averaged a lousy .220 in 32 games for Almendares in 
1950-51, while batting a combined .246 with Almendares and Marianao in 
1951-52. Even so, he was signed as a reinforcement prior to the 1952 Caribbean 
Series to be the regular catcher for the title-winning Habana. He responded 
with a batting average of .304 (7 for 23), including a double, one RBI 
and two runs, helping Habana win the Series with a 5–0 record, and also 
was selected for the All-Star team. In addition, Fleitas became the first 
man to catch a no-hitter in Series history, when he caught Tommy Fine in 
his 1–0 gem against the Cervecería Caracas of Venezuela in Game 2. The 
feat has not been repeated since.[10][11] He then became a part-time catcher/first 
baseman for Habana in 1952-53, batting .286 in 27 games during the regular 
season. Habana returned to the Series in 1953 and finished second with 
a 3-3 mark. Fleitas batted .333 (2 for 6) as a backup for catcher Dick 
Rand. The next season he batted .133 in 21 games, mostly in pinch-hitting 
duty. He concluded his baseball career with Cienfuegos in the 1954-55 season, 
going 3 for 24 (.125) with a double and one RBI.[3] Fleitas made 537 game 
appearances over 13 seasons in the Cuban league. He finished with a batting 
average of .274 (496 for 1811), which includes 81 doubles, 18 triples, 
nine home runs and 21 stolen bases, driving in 223 runs while scoring 195 
times. He played 17 games in four Caribbean Series, batting .274 (15 for 
54) with two doubles, four runs and seven RBI.[3] Fleitas gained induction 
in the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame (Phase 2) in 1971.[12] He later was 
inducted into the Cuban Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.[13] Fleitas was a 
long time resident of Miami, Florida, where he died in 2011 at the age
