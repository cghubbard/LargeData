The West Baden Sprudels were an early Negro league baseball team that played 
as an independent club owned by the Burnett-Pollard-Rogers Baseball Club 
Company, where Edward Rogers was the Chief Officer. The Sprudels appear 
to have been from Springs Valley, Indiana, but they often frequented baseball 
diamonds near the West Baden Springs Hotel in West Baden Springs, Indiana 
and the French Lick Springs Hotel in French Lick, Indiana. Games started 
between the teams between 1907 and 1908.[1] The team was managed by C. 
I. Taylor[2] from 1910 to 1913. Their name derived from a bottled water 
produced at the Hotel. The Hotel bordered on a local salt lick and mineral 
spring and the minerals from the spring made the water act as an effective 
and marketable natural laxative. The product was labeled as "Sprudel Water". 
Their frequent rivals, the French Lick Plutos, came from a hotel on the 
same spring that had also bottled the water and sold it as "Pluto Water". 
The West Baden Sprudels played long before the Negro National League formed 
in 1920, but still against many of the great pre-Negro league baseball 
teams of the day, including the Chicago American Giants, Indianapolis ABCs, 
Cuban Stars, Louisville White Sox, Chicago Union Giants, Chicago Giants, 
French Lick Plutos, and the Brooklyn All Stars. Many famous Negro league 
baseball and pre-Negro league players were on the West Baden Sprudels team
