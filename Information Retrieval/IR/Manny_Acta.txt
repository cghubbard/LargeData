As manager As coach Manuel Elias Acta (born January 11, 1969) is a former 
professional baseball manager who is currently the third base coach for 
the Seattle Mariners, and formerly a broadcast analyst for ESPN and ESPN 
Deportes. He has served as manager for the Washington Nationals and the 
Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball. In the Dominican Winter League, 
he managed the Tigres del Licey from 2003–2005, including leading them 
to victory at the 2004 Caribbean Series. Acta managed the Dominican Republic 
team at the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Acta was signed by the Houston 
Astros at age 17 as an undrafted free agent infielder.[1] Acta played baseball 
professionally for six seasons, all in the Astros' system, but never reached 
the major leagues as a player. The Astros organization would eventually 
send him to scouting school in Florida to utilize his analytical skills 
rather than his athletic talent. In 1991, Acta became a player-coach at 
the A level, and soon after that quit his playing career and focused solely 
on coaching. He became the manager of the A-level Auburn Astros team at 
Auburn, New York in 1993, and he managed in the minors through 2000. He 
led the Kissimmee Cobras to a Florida State League championship in 1999. 
Acta was hired as the third base coach for the Montreal Expos under Frank 
Robinson in 2002, and held that position through 2005. In 2005 Acta was 
hired as the third base coach for the New York Mets under manager Willie 
Randolph. He held this position for two years, leaving to become the manager 
of the Washington Nationals On November 9, 2015, Acta was hired as the 
third base coach for the Seattle Mariners under new manager Scott Servais 
for the 2016 season. Acta will be the first person issued #14 as it had 
been out of circulation since Lou Piniella left the team after the 2002 
season. Acta was hired as manager of the Washington Nationals on November 
14, 2006, returning to the franchise that gave him his first major league 
job (the Nationals were the Expos prior to a relocation following the 2004 
season). Acta received the job for his youth and enthusiasm, as well as 
knowing a few of the Nationals players from his third base coaching job 
with the Expos.[2] In his first season with Washington, projected[3] to 
be one of the worst teams in Major League Baseball, Acta and the Nationals 
finished 73–89. With his team beset by many injuries[quantify], Acta maintained 
a positive influence on his young Nationals. In his first year with the 
Nationals he earned votes for NL Manager of the Year, coming in fifth in 
that vote.[4] In his second season managing the Nats, the team's record 
worsened to 59–102. Signs of the team progressing in the win column was 
not being realized during the beginning of his third season with the club. 
At 26–61, and the Nats coming off a 100-loss season, including a seven-game 
road trip in which they would win just one game, Acta's time as manager 
was drawing to a close. On July 12, 2009, Acta reported he had been fired 
as Nationals manager following a loss to the Houston Astros.[5] The Nationals 
announced on their website on July 13 that an announcement concerning the 
dismissal was forthcoming, which served as a confirmation of the firing.[6] 
Nationals bench coach Jim Riggleman, who had previously managed the San 
Diego Padres, Chicago Cubs, and Seattle Mariners, assumed the position 
as interim manager.[7] On October 25, 2009, the Cleveland Indians announced 
that they had hired Acta as their manager, signing him to a three-year 
contract with an option for an additional year.[8] The Astros had also 
offered Acta their managerial position.[9] The Indians struggled in his 
first year, marginally improving from their 2009 campaign at 69–93. In 
his second season, the Indians improved by 11 games to 80–82 after starting 
out the season 30–15. Cleveland would finish in second place, fourteen 
games behind the Detroit Tigers. On September 29, 2011, the Indians announced 
they had exercised Acta's option for the 2013 season.[10] After a 20-51 
record in the second half of the 2012 season, the Indians fired Acta on 
September 27, 2012, with only six games remaining in the regular season. 
Bench coach Sandy Alomar, Jr. was named interim manager.,[11] and Terry 
Francona eventually was named to the position full-time. Acta comes from 
a family of Lebanese descent that settled in San Pedro de Macorís a century 
ago.[12] The fatal plane crash on October 11, 2006, that killed New York 
Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle and his pilot crashed into Acta's apartment 
building in New York while he was still coaching for the Mets. Acta wasn't 
there at the time because he had gone to Shea Stadium to prepare for that 
night's Game 1 of the NLCS between the Mets and St. Louis Cardinals.[13]

scholarships in the United States and neared completion of an athletic/education
