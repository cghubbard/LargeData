-73.92972 Yeshiva University is a private university in New York City, 
with four campuses in New York City.[3] Founded in 1886, it is a research 
university. The university's undergraduate schools—Yeshiva College, Stern 
College for Women, and Syms School of Business—offer a dual curriculum 
inspired by Modern-Centrist-Orthodox Judaism's hashkafa (philosophy) of 
Torah Umadda ("Torah and secular knowledge") combining academic education 
with the study of the Torah.[4] Yeshiva is perhaps best known for its secular, 
highly selective graduate schools, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine 
and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. The Forward announced on May 
27, 2014 that Yeshiva would be shedding the financial burden of the Albert 
Einstein College of Medicine when the medical school is taken over by the 
Bronx-based Montefiore Health Systems.[5] While the majority of students 
at the University are of the Jewish faith, many students, especially at 
School of Law, the College of Medicine, and the School of Business, are 
not Jewish. Yeshiva University is an independent institution chartered 
by New York State.[6][7][8][9] It is accredited by the Commission on Higher 
Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools[10] 
and by several professional agencies.[11] The University, having been founded 
in 1886, is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States 
that combines Jewish scholarship with studies in the liberal arts, sciences, 
medicine, law, business, social work, Jewish studies and education, and 
psychology.[citation needed] It has its roots in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva 
founded in 1886 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a cheder-style elementary 
school founded by Eastern European immigrants that offered study of Talmud 
along with some secular education, including instruction in English.[citation 
needed] As of August 2012,[12] Yeshiva University enrolls approximately 
6,400 undergraduate students, 3,500 graduate students, and 1,000 students 
at its affiliated high schools and Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. 
It conferred 1,822 degrees in 2007 and offers community service projects 
serving New York, Jewish communities, the United States and Canada.[11] 
Richard M. Joel is Yeshiva University's president, while Rabbi Dr. Norman 
Lamm served as chancellor until 2013. Joel is the first president of YU 
who is not a rabbi. The university's past leaders include Dr. Bernard Revel, 
Dr. Samuel Belkin, and "The Rav," Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. In April 
2015 Moshael Straus was elected as Yeshiva University Board Chief. Straus, 
will succeed Henry Kressel, whose six years as the head of the university’s 
board overlapped with an era of "financial crisis" at the university. Straus, 
who currently serves as vice-chairman, has been a member of the board since 
1998. His term began on July 1, 2015. The university has run an operating 
deficit for seven consecutive years. In 2014 it lost $84 million, and in 
2013 suffered a loss of $64 million. In March 2015, the faculty of Yeshiva 
College passed a "no-confidence motion" against Richard Joel, the university 
president. Professor Gillian Steinberg, a member of the Yeshiva College 
executive committee, told The New York Jewish Week that the vote was meant 
to “signal donors in a meaningful way” and “indicate that the board of 
trustees is moving in the wrong direction.”[5] In January 2016 the University 
disclosed that it will cede almost half of its $1 billion endowment to 
the Albert Einstein School of Medicine, as the medical college enters the 
separate joint venture with Montefiore Health System.[13] The University's 
main campus, Wilf Campus, is located in Washington Heights. A 1928 plan 
to build a spacious Moorish Revival campus around several gardens and courtyards 
was cancelled by the Great Depression of 1929 after only one building had 
been erected. Building continued after the Depression in modern style and 
by the acquisition of existing neighborhood buildings.[14] Since it was 
first founded in 1886, Yeshiva University has expanded to comprise some 
twenty colleges, schools, affiliates, centers, and institutions, with several 
affiliated hospitals and health care institutions. It has campuses and 
facilities in Manhattan (Washington Heights, Murray Hill, Greenwich Village), 
the Bronx, Queens, and Israel. The Yeshiva University Museum is a teaching 
museum and the cultural arm of Yeshiva University. Founded in 1973, Yeshiva 
University Museum is AAMG accredited and aims to provide a window into 
Jewish culture around the world and throughout history through multi-disciplinary 
exhibitions and publications. Yeshiva University maintains four campuses 
in New York City: The high school for girls is located in the Holliswood 
neighborhood of eastern Queens. The university's building in Jerusalem, 
in the Bayit VeGan neighborhood, contains a branch of the rabbinical seminary 
and an office coordinating the S. Daniel Abraham Israel Program,[16] a 
formal arrangement between Yeshiva University and 42 men's yeshivot and 
women's midrashot in Israel that enables students to incorporate study 
in Israel into their college years. While studying in Israel, students 
study Jewish subjects while learning firsthand about Israel's land, people, 
history, and culture. Yeshiva University Israel advisers visit each school 
regularly to offer academic guidance, career planning, and personal counseling. 
In addition, the program sponsors lectures and activities where students 
can gather under the auspices of Yeshiva University, and a guidance center 
to provide support for students studying in Israel. Yeshiva University 
also cosponsors events for American students in Israel, such as the Battle 
of the Bands and Inter-Seminary Choir Competition, and an annual career 
fair. The program is headquartered at the Student Center at Yeshiva University's 
Israel Campus in the Bayit Vegan neighborhood of Jerusalem. Mrs. Stephanie 
Strauss serves as director of the program. Clubs and activities are maintained 
by the students in each school, generally under the auspices of a student 
government. Activities are funded by a student activities fee collected 
by the school but freely distributed by the elected council. (Athletics 
are usually an academic department.) Each graduate school maintains a student 
council, such as the Student Bar Association at Cardozo, which, in turn, 
supports the many clubs and publications in each school. At the undergraduate 
level, there are separate student governments on the two campuses. Although 
the two student governments are separate, they work closely in coordinating 
joint events. The men's schools are represented overall by the Yeshiva 
Student Union, and specifically by the Yeshiva College Student Association, 
the Syms Student Council, the Student Organization of Yeshiva (SOY, which 
represents both undergraduate MYP students as well as RIETS students), 
and student councils for SBMP, IBC, and JSS. The latter four run most Jewish-related 
activities on campus, including holiday celebrations and the famed SOY 
Seforim (Jewish book) sale annually around February, which is open to the 
general public and attracts large crowds from near and far. There are also 
individual councils for each class, council committees, a Student Court, 
and clubs. On the Wilf Campus, the Yeshiva Student Union, run by Aryeh 
Minsky oversees most of student life on campus. The council consists of 
Raffi Wiesen, Max Hoffman, Josh Deutsch and semi-popular figurehead Jacob 
M. Herenstein. The women's schools are represented by the Stern College 
and Syms Student Councils; there are also a Torah Activities Council, which 
coordinates Jewish-related events, and individual class councils, along 
with various clubs. The various positions on all councils are chosen by 
elections open to all students (both as voters and candidates) generally 
held in the Spring (for the following year's councils), although Freshman 
and Sophomore class councils are elected in the Fall, the latter owing 
to the large number of students spending the freshman year abroad in Israel. 
The undergraduate men's newspaper is The Commentator, and the undergraduate 
women's The Observer, as well as a co-ed satirical news site The Quipster; 
there is also a student newspaper (in addition to a number of law journals) 
at Cardozo. There are numerous other publications on a wide range of topics, 
both secular and religious, produced by the various councils and academic 
clubs, along with many official university publications and the university 
press. The call letters of the student radio station are WYUR, currently 
an Internet-only station, available at wyur.net.[17] There are dormitory 
and dining facilities on each campus. Cardozo has a single dormitory building 
a block south of the classroom building, while Einstein has a number of 
student housing buildings on campus for single and married students. Approximately 
80% of the undergraduate student populations live on campus. The Wilf Campus 
includes three main dormitory buildings: Morgenstern (nicknamed "Morg"), 
Rubin, and Muss Halls. Many upperclassmen and some graduate students live 
in the surrounding independent housing that is run by the university or 
in other nearby buildings; there is also a small high school dormitory 
on campus, Strenger Hall, which houses some older students as well who 
serve as counselors. The Beren campus includes four dormitory buildings: 
Brookdale, Schottenstein, the 36th Street and 35th Street Residence Halls. 
Many students live in university-administered independent housing nearby. 
Yeshiva University is home to a variety of NCAA Division III-level sports 
teams. The teams, nicknamed "The Maccabees",[18] include: men's baseball, 
basketball, golf, volleyball, wrestling, women's basketball, cross country, 
fencing, soccer, tennis, and volleyball. One of the most successful teams 
in Yeshiva University sports history is the fencing team, known as the 
"Taubermen", named after the coach of the team, Professor Arthur Tauber, 
who served as the head coach of the team from 1949 through 1985. Olympic 
gold medalist Henry Wittenberg was at one time the coach of the wrestling 
team.[19] Because of Yeshiva's dual curriculum, most of the sports teams 
practice at night, sometimes even as late as 11:00 pm. A few of the sports 
teams have been known to get in an early morning practice or workout before 
classes begin at 9:00 am. Teams have participated in weekend tournaments 
outside of New York City, with athletes staying with local families in 
the area. This took place in Boston with the basketball and fencing teams, 
and in Hollywood, Florida with the baseball team in 2008. Some international 
students have participated in NCAA sports, with as many as nine different 
nationalities representing the school on the sports field.[20] Two members 
of the Yeshiva Maccabees Baseball team were drafted out of college by professional 
teams of the Israeli Baseball League. Pitcher Aryeh Rosenbaum, celebrated 
a championship with his team in the IBL's first year.[21] Yeshiva's Men's 
Basketball team is an annual playoff contender. The best era for Yeshiva 
basketball in recent history has been the first few years and last few 
years of the 1990s. Banners hang in the Max Stern Athletic Center commemorating 
seasons from both eras. The 2007–2008 season had particular note as Yeshiva 
was home to the NCAA Skyline Conference's Rookie of the Year. Since 2010, 
the Men's Cross Country and Men's Volleyball teams have won multiple championships.[22][23] 
Many of the Maccabees have gained attention nationwide, like Sam Cohen 
won an individual championship as well as Capital One Academic honors.[24] 
Other attention grabbers come from Women's Basketball and Women's Fencing.[25][26] 
In 2014, the Men's Tennis team won the Skyline Conference championship, 
becoming the first team in school history to advance to the NCAA tournament 
in any sport. In 2015[27] the Men's Tennis team repeated as Skyline Conference 
champions and went back to the NCAA National Tournament, advancing to the 
2nd round.[28] They lost to the defending National Champions Amherst[29] 
College. In 2016 the Men's Tennis team completed an epic three-peat by 
winning the Skyline Conference a third year in a row[30] and advancing 
to the NCAA D3 National Tennis Tournament again. Men's Tennis (3): 2016

run by the student body. Student groups include the Commentator (a student 
newspaper) and the Yeshiva University Dramatics Society (YCDS) that puts 
on a performance each semester. A student-run group known as the Heights 
Initiative sponsors several outreach programs that work with the schools 
and organizations of the Washington Heights community. Student Government 
is run through YSU, YCSA, SOY-JSC, and SYMS. These four student run organizations 
hold weekly meetings with their respective councils and a weekly meeting 
with university administrators. Their goal is to help ensure that the student 
clubs and organizations are receiving the appropriate funding and support. 
Additionally, they run community events like the annual Hannukah Concert 
and a carnival celebrating Israeli Independence Day. In 2009 students gathered 
together to create a "Tolerance Club", the purpose of which was to promote 
the idea of there being a diversity of people within the Yeshiva University 
community. The group was controversial on the Yeshiva University campus. 
This controversy came to a head when the Tolerance Club sponsored a panel 
discussion entitled "Being Gay in the Orthodox World" in December 2009. 
Several hundred people attended this panel discussion. Numerous Jewish 
news sources covered the panel and the conflict that enveloped the Yeshiva 
campus in its wake. The Tolerance Club disbanded in May 2010. "[32] The 
Yeshiva University Medical Ethics Society (MES), is an undergraduate student-run 
organization of Yeshiva University which was founded by students in the 
fall of 2005 with the help of the Center for the Jewish Future toward the 
goal of promoting education and awareness of Jewish medical ethics in the 
university itself and the community at large. Since that time, MES working 
with the CJF has grown from a small group of students with common interests 
to running events with university-wide participation. In the first several 
years, they hosted a program of on-campus lectures by experts[who?] in 
the field of medical ethics and Halakha (Jewish law). Topics covered have 
included stem cell research, cloning, do not resuscitate orders, genetic 
testing, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and birth control. They also 
host genetic testing events to help combat the high incidence of various 
genetic diseases in the Jewish community. The Society hosts events throughout 
the year, including an annual conference focused on a chosen medical ethics 
topic. The events are open to all those who have an interest in learning 
more about Jewish medical ethics. The U.S. News and World Report's 2017 
"America's Best Colleges" ranked Yeshiva University as the 66th best National 
University.[41][42] Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein School of Medicine 
was ranked 38th in the nation in research[43] and 51st in primary care,[44] 
and its Cardozo School of Law was ranked number 75[45] among law schools. 
It ranked #5 in Dispute Resolution & #7 in Intellectual Property Law.[46] 
The Washington Monthly 2013 College Rankings placed Yeshiva University 
187th nationally.[47] Forbes ranked Yeshiva University as; #135 Of all 
colleges in America, #102 in Private Colleges, #70 in Research Universities 
& #63 in the Northeast.[48] Internationally, Yeshiva was ranked 156th by 
the Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[49] in the 200s by 
the Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Academic Ranking of World Universities[50] 
and 269th in the world by the QS World University Rankings.[51] Notable 
graduates of Yeshiva University include author Chaim Potok (B.A. 1950), 
diplomat Daniel C. Kurtzer (B.A. 1971), former Speaker of the New York 
State Assembly Sheldon Silver (B.A. 1978), former Governor of Vermont Howard 
Dean (M.D. 1978), Triple Crown-winning racehorse owner Ahmed Zayat (B.A. 
198?), baseball executive David Samson (J.D. 1992), and restaurateur and 
writer Eddie Huang (J.D. 2008), in addition to a number of prominent rabbis. 
Notable faculty members past and present of Yeshiva University include 
Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist Paul Greengard and Pulitzer Prize-winning
