Joseph Daniel "Joey" Votto (born September 10, 1983) is a Canadian professional 
baseball first baseman for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He made his MLB debut with the Reds in 2007. Votto is a four-time 
MLB All-Star and a five-time Tip O'Neill Award winner. In 2010, he won 
the National League (NL) MVP Award, the NL Hank Aaron Award, and the Lou 
Marsh Trophy as Canada's athlete of the year.[1] Votto was born on September 
10, 1983 to Wendy (Howell) and Joseph Votto[2] in Toronto, Ontario, and 
grew up in Etobicoke, a district in the west end of Toronto. His mother 
is a sommelier and restaurant manager. His father was a chef and a baseball 
fan who died at age 52 in 2008.[3] He is of Italian descent. As a child, 
he adorned his wall with a Ted Williams poster.[4] Votto enrolled in high 
school at Richview Collegiate Institute in 1997. In high school, he also 
played basketball — playing point guard and once scoring 37 points in a 
game — and hockey.[5] He played for the Etobicoke Rangers baseball program.[6] 
Votto signed a National Letter of Intent to play college baseball for the 
Coastal Carolina Chanticleers after high school.[7] Votto was drafted out 
of high school in the second round of the 2002 MLB amateur draft by the 
Reds (44th overall), After his first two professional seasons with the 
Reds' rookie-level affiliates, he burst onto the scene in 2004 with the 
Class A Dayton Dragons, hitting 26 doubles and 14 home runs with a batting 
average of .302. He was promoted to the Class A-Advanced Potomac and hit 
five more home runs in 20 games to end the season with 19. During his time 
in the minor leagues, Votto made appearances in the outfield and as a catcher, 
aside from first base. Votto's consistency declined during 2005 campaign 
with Sarasota. While he still hit 19 home runs, he struck out 122 times 
and his batting average dropped nearly 50 points to .256. Votto rebounded 
in 2006 with the best season of his minor league career. Playing with Class 
AA Chattanooga, he improved his batting average to .319 and hit 46 doubles 
and 22 home runs. He led the Southern League in batting average and total 
bases and was third in home runs and RBI. He was selected to play in the 
2006 Futures Game on the World Team. He was named to both the Mid-Season 
and Post-Season Southern League All-Star teams, and was voted a minor league 
all-star by Baseball America. He culminated his season by winning the Southern 
League Most Valuable Player Award. During his five seasons in the minors, 
Votto carried Ted Williams' The Science of Hitting with him.[4] Votto started 
off the 2007 season playing in Triple-A for the Louisville Bats. He was 
called up on September 1, 2007. He made his Major League debut on September 
4, 2007, striking out against Guillermo Mota of the New York Mets. In his 
second major league at-bat, he hit his first career home run. He went 3-for-5 
and scored two runs as the Reds won the game, 7–0. On September 8, he went 
1-for-3 with a home run and three runs batted in. His three RBIs were the 
only Reds' runs as they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers, 4–3. In his next 
game, he went 2-for-4. On September 14, he stole his first career base 
against the Brewers. He ended the season going 2-for-4 with a home run 
and five RBIs in the Cincinnati Reds' final game of the 2007 season.[8] 
He would finish the season batting .321 with 4 home runs and 17 runs batted 
in. Beginning with the 2008 season, Votto shared time platooning at first 
base with Scott Hatteberg until Manager Dusty Baker began playing Votto 
as the Reds' starting first baseman in early April. On April 15, he hit 
his first home run of the season off of Michael Wuertz. He drove in a career-high 
five runs against the Cubs two games later. On May 7, Votto hit three home 
runs in a game against the Chicago Cubs. "I'm like a kid", said Votto, 
a second-year player who had never hit more than one in a game. "I thought 
it was cool. It's not a big part of my game."[9] Votto hit his first career 
pinch-hit home run against Cleveland's Cliff Lee, who would go on to win 
the AL Cy Young Award. On August 31, Votto had his first career four-hit 
game against the San Francisco Giants. He knocked in 4 runs in a 9–3 Reds 
victory. On September 18, Votto and teammate Jay Bruce each homered twice. 
They became the fifth rookie teammates in the divisional-era to hit 20 
home runs in the same season.[10] Votto finished second in National League 
Rookie of the Year voting to the Chicago Cubs' Geovany Soto.[11] He led 
all NL rookies in hitting (.297), hits (156), HR (24), total bases (266), 
multi-hit games (42), on-base percentage (.368) and slugging percentage 
(.506).[12] Votto also broke the Reds' record for the most runs batted 
in by a rookie in a season. The previous record was held by National Baseball 
Hall of Fame outfielder Frank Robinson with 83 in 1956. Votto drove in 
84 runs during the 2008 season. Votto played for Canada in the 2009 World 
Baseball Classic. In Canada's first game against the United States, he 
had four hits in five at-bats, one of which was a home run.[13] Votto began 
the 2009 season strong as the outright starter at first base. In the second 
game of the season, he went 3-for-5 with a homer and three RBI in a loss 
to the New York Mets. In the next game against the Mets, he had another 
homer and four RBI. He had a six-game hitting streak from April 12–18. 
On April 23, he went 4-for-5 with a home run and two runs batted in against 
the Cubs.[14] He ended out with a .346 batting average, 3 home runs, and 
20 runs batted in in the month of April.[15] Votto opened May with a five-game 
hitting streak. In a May matchup against the St. Louis Cardinals, he had 
two homers and four RBI. He finished the month with five home runs and 
a .378 batting average. However, he was placed on the DL to open June after 
missing time in May due to personal issues. Prior to his return game during 
the 2009 season, he indicated he had been suffering from depression and 
anxiety issues as a result of the sudden death of his father in August 
2008 and had sought treatment.[16] He had previously missed time because 
of dizziness related to an inner ear infection. Votto made his return against 
the Toronto Blue Jays on June 23. In his third game back, he went 4-for-5 
with a home run and four runs batted in.[14] After going hitless in his 
fourth game back, he had a 14-game hitting streak. During that stretch, 
he batted .389 with three home runs and 14 runs batted in. His hitting 
streak ended against the Mets on July 12 when he went 0-for-2.[14] Votto 
was named the National League Player of the Week for September 21–27, 2009 
after hitting 10 doubles in a five-game span, a feat not accomplished in 
77 years since Hall of Fame outfielder Paul Waner of the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in 1932.[17] Despite missing 31 games overall, Votto finished the 2009 
season among the National League leaders in batting average (.322), on-base 
percentage (.414) and slugging percentage (.567) and he hit 25 home runs.[12] 
Votto started the 2010 season by going 3-for-5 with a home run and a run 
batted in. By the end of April, he had four home runs and 12 runs batted 
in. His average was .275 but his on-base percentage was .400 due to 18 
bases on balls. Votto played better in the month of May. He batted .344 
with six home runs and 21 runs batted in. However, he missed the last six 
games that month due to a sore neck. He would be back on June 1 in a game 
against the Cardinals. He went 4-for-5 with a home run and a run batted 
in. The Reds won the game to regain the NL Central lead. Votto was not 
initially voted to the 2010 All-Star game in Anaheim, California, but made 
the roster via online fan voting through the National League's Final Vote. 
He was named on 13.7 million of the 26 million ballots submitted.[18] Votto 
went 0-for-2 in the game. On August 25, Votto went 4-for-7 with two home 
runs and four RBI. He also drove in the tie-breaking run with a single 
off Giants pitcher Barry Zito.[19] Votto made the cover of Sports Illustrated 
on the August 30, 2010 edition. On September 11, Votto hit his first career 
walk-off home run off Pirates relief pitcher Justin Thomas.[citation needed] 
For the season, Votto hit .324 with 113 RBIs, 106 runs scored and 37 homers, 
including a grand slam off Tommy Hanson of the Atlanta Braves on May 20. 
He finished the season leading the Major Leagues in On-Base Percentage 
(.424) and led the National League in Slugging Percentage (.600) and On-Base 
Plus Slugging (1.024). The Reds made the postseason but lost to the Phillies 
in the National League Divisional Series in a three-game sweep.[20] Votto 
struggled in the series, batting .091 with one run batted in.[12] Votto 
won the 2010 Hank Aaron Award in the National League.[21] Votto was announced 
as the 2010 NL MVP, coming within one vote of winning unanimously as Albert 
Pujols received the other first-place vote.[22] He was only the third Canadian 
to win the MVP award, after Larry Walker and Justin Morneau.[23] He became 
the first Reds player to win the National League MVP since Barry Larkin 
won it in 1995. "Not to be dramatic or anything, but after I was told, 
I couldn't help but cry because I know how much at some point this meant 
to me and would have meant to my (late) father", Votto remarked after being 
named MVP. He added, "I did some pretty good things, and most importantly, 
we won. We went to the playoffs – it's been a long time since we'd been 
to the playoffs – and I think those all together were the reason I won."[23] 
On January 16, it was announced that the Reds and Votto agreed to a three-year, 
$38 million deal. [24] Votto homered in the Reds' first game of the 2011 
season, a solo homer off Kameron Loe of the Brewers. He recorded his first 
four-hit game of the season against the Arizona Diamondbacks and raised 
his average to .455. By the end of April, he had a .370 batting average, 
four home runs, and 14 runs batted in. He posted a .500 on-base percentage. 
He began the season by reaching base in 27 consecutive games dating back 
to the previous season. The club record was set by Dave Collins with 34 
in 1981.[citation needed] On June 25, Votto hit his 100th career home run 
against Brian Matusz of the Orioles. He later added another home run in 
the game. That was also his first multi-homer game of the season. He also 
drove in five runs, his most in a game during the season.[25] On July 3, 
Votto was voted in by the players for the 2011 All-Star Game as a reserve. 
He went 0-for-2 with a strikeout.[12] On August 28, Votto hit a walk-off 
home run against the Nationals in the 14th inning. On September 24, he 
drove in two runs against the Pirates for his 100th and 101st RBI of the 
season, becoming the first Reds player to drive in 100 runs in back-to-back 
seasons since Dave Parker in 1985–1986.[26] Votto finished the season with 
a .309 batting average, 29 home runs, and 103 RBIs. He also led the NL 
in doubles (40), bases on balls (110) and on-base percentage (.416).[12] 
On November 1, Votto won his first Gold Glove Award. He finished sixth 
in the NL MVP voting.[12] On April 2, 2012, Votto signed a 10-year, $225 
million contract extension with the Reds, running through the 2024 season.[27] 
The deal includes the two years that remained on his previous contract 
and pushes the total worth of the contract to 12 years and $251.5 million, 
the longest active deal in baseball. The deal (including the one-year team 
option), is the fifth-largest deal in MLB history,[28] behind only Giancarlo 
Stanton's contract with the Miami Marlins (13 years, $325 million), Alex 
Rodriguez's contracts with New York (10 years, $275 million) and Texas 
(10 years, $252 million) and Albert Pujols' deal with the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim (10 years, $240 million). It is the longest guaranteed contract 
in MLB history.[29] The contract made Votto the highest paid athlete from 
Canada.[28] On May 13, Votto went 4 -for-5 with three home runs and six 
RBI, including a walk-off grand slam against the Washington Nationals in 
a 9–6 win. It was the first time in major league history that a player 
hit three home runs including a walk-off grand slam in a single game.[30] 
On July 1, Votto was selected by the fans as a National League team starter 
in the 2012 MLB All-Star Game.[31] At the time of his selection, he was 
hitting .350 with 14 home runs and 47 RBI. On July 16, the Reds announced 
that Votto would need arthroscopic knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus 
in his left knee and was expected to miss three to four weeks.[32] He originally 
hurt the knee June 29 sliding into third base.[33] He left the next day 
before the bottom of the fifth inning and missed the next two games due 
to inflammation in the knee.[34][35] At the time surgery was announced, 
he was leading the NL in walks, doubles, OBP and extra-base hits. He was 
second in RISP average and third in slugging percentage.[35] On September 
5, Votto returned to the Reds' lineup in a game against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. In his first at-bat since July 15, he lined a single off pitcher 
Roy Halladay in the first inning. He would finish the game by 2-for-3 with 
a base on balls.[36] After his return from the disabled list, he struggled 
with his power numbers. In 25 games, he hit eight doubles but no home runs 
and drove in seven runs. He still got on base at a high clip at .505, walking 
28 times. In that span, he also batted over .316.[37] Votto finished the 
season having played in 111 games, the fewest he has played in a season 
since becoming the Reds' starting first basemen in 2008. He had a .337 
batting average, .474 on-base percentage, and a .567 slugging percentage 
to go along with 14 home runs, 56 runs batted in and 44 doubles.[38] His 
94 walks led the NL (18 of them were intentional, which led MLB). In late 
February, Votto was voted by fans as the "Face of the MLB", a contest that 
pits the "Face" of every MLB team against each other and is voted on using 
Twitter. He received more votes than Joe Mauer, Jose Bautista, Derek Jeter, 
Andrew McCutchen and Matt Kemp. Votto played for Team Canada in the 2013 
World Baseball Classic. Votto homered on consecutive days from April 20–21 
against the Marlins, making it the first time since September 10–11 of 
2011 he homered in consecutive games.[39] In July, he was again voted as 
an All-Star starter for the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It 
was his fourth All-Star appearance, and in the game he went 0-for-2, making 
him a career 0-for-9 in All-Star Games.[40] On May 21, 2014, Votto was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left quadriceps. He 
returned on June 10 but went back on the DL with the same injury on July 
8 and didn't make it back before the end of the season. In 62 games played, 
he hit a career-low .255 with a .390 on-base percentage, .409 slugging 
percentage, 6 home runs, 47 walks, and 23 runs batted in. On May 6, 2015, 
Votto was ejected following a strikeout where he threw his helmet down 
in frustration. Speculation claimed that prior to his ejection, he had 
choice words with Gerrit Cole during his at-bat. After getting ejected, 
Votto appeared to have bumped Chris Conroy. It was only his 5th career 
ejection and his first one since 2010. He later received a one-game suspension 
for this act which he served when the Reds played the Chicago White Sox.[41] 
On June 9, Votto hit three home runs in a single game for the third time 
in his career in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, a feat last 
accomplished by a Red by Johnny Bench.[42] On August 2, Votto was ejected 
following a bench-clearing brawl between the Reds and the Pirates.[43] 
On September 10, Votto was ejected for arguing balls and strikes. It was 
the third time of the season that Votto was ejected, coincidentally all 
three times have been against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[44] On September 
11, MLB suspended Votto 2 games with an option to appeal.[45] On October 
2, Votto tied a Reds record set by Pete Rose in 1978 when he got on base 
for his 48th straight game.[46] In 158 games of 2015, Votto had an MLB-leading 
143 walks, a .314 batting average, 29 home runs, and 80 RBI. Following 
the season, Votto was awarded his fifth Tip O'Neill Award.[47] He also 
finished third in the National League MVP voting behind Bryce Harper and 
Paul Goldschmidt. After an abysmal start to the 2016 season, hitting a 
season-low .213 on May 31, Votto became the first player in MLB since Ichiro 
Suzuki in 2004 to hit .400 after the All-Star Break. Votto hit .408/.490/.668 
in the second half. Votto's .326 season average was the second-best of 
his career, behind only his 2012 season, where he hit .337.[48] Votto hit 
29 home runs, second only to his 2010 MVP season.[48] Votto finished the 
season with a .326/.435/.550 line with 108 walks, 29 home runs, and 97 
RBI, playing 158 games for the second straight season. Votto is known for 
being a clutch hitter. Through June 9, 2014, he had a career .312 batting 
average, 163 home runs, and 542 runs batted in. He has been known to show 
great patience at the plate. He led the NL in base on balls with 110 in 
2011 and did it again in 2012, with 94, despite missing 51 games. His career 
on-base percentage is .420.[12] He led the NL in that category every year 
from 2010 through 2013.[12] Votto has been recognized for his defensive 
play as a first baseman. He led the league in assists (with 136) for first 
basemen in 2008, a feat he repeated in consecutive seasons in 2011 and 
2012. He finished 5th in 2009 with 101 assists and second in 2010 with 
128 assists.[12] In 2011, he also led all NL first basemen in putouts (1,341), 
and was third in fielding percentage (.996). That year, he won his first 
Gold Glove Award. Votto lives in Mount Adams, Cincinnati.[28] He has three 
brothers; Tyler, and twin brothers named Ryan and Paul who now attend North 
Park Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario. Votto's adopted mastiff-golden 
retriever mix is named "Maris", after former baseball player Roger Maris.[49] 
Votto is represented by sports agent Dan Lozano.[28] Major League: Minor
