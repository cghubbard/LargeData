The Bradenton Marauders are a minor league baseball team based in Bradenton, 
Florida that plays in the Florida State League. The Marauders are the Class 
A-Advanced affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Their home games are played 
at McKechnie Field, which also serves as the Pirates' spring training facility. 
The franchise can be directly traced to 1957 as the Tampa Tarpons, a team 
in the Florida State League, then a Class D minor league, based in Tampa, 
Florida.[1] From their inception, the Tarpons played all their home games 
at Al Lopez Field, built in 1955 and located at the current site of Raymond 
James Stadium. The Tarpons were affiliated with the Philadelphia Phillies 
from 1957 to 1960. In 1961 they began a long affiliation with the Cincinnati 
Reds. During the 1970s several Tarpon alumni went on to be part of Cincinnati's 
"Big Red Machine". Future Reds star Pete Rose led the first place Tarpons 
in 1961 with a .331 batting average and 30 triples, still an FSL record.[2] 
Other Reds players of the era who started with the Tarpons include Ken 
Griffey, Sr., Johnny Bench, Dan Driessen, Rawly Eastwick, and Dave Concepción. 
Later, the 1990 World Series Champion Reds roster included former Tarpons 
such as Tom Browning, Rob Dibble, and Paul O'Neill. Randy Poffo, who later 
became famous as professional wrestler "Macho Man" Randy Savage, finished 
a minor league baseball career with the Tarpons in 1974.[3] The Tampa Tarpons 
won three league championships, in 1957, 1959 and 1961.[4] In the 1980s 
rumors arose that a major league team would come to Tampa, which would 
threaten the viability of the Tarpons and other minor league teams in the 
Tampa Bay Area. In 1988 the Chicago White Sox replaced Cincinnati as the 
Tarpons' affiliate, launching murmurs that the White Sox would themselves 
relocate to the area.[5] Fearing his team would soon be displaced, in 1989 
Tarpons owner Mitchell Mick sold his franchise to the White Sox, who moved 
it to Sarasota, Florida as the Sarasota White Sox.[6] The team started 
play in Sarasota as the Sarasota White Sox in the 1989 season.[6] They 
remained in the city for the next 21 seasons, going through a series of 
name changes due to their affiliation changes. They were known as the White 
Sox from 1989–1993, as the Sarasota Red Sox from 1994–2004, and the Sarasota 
Reds from 2004–2009. In Sarasota, the team played in Payne Park (1989) 
and then Ed Smith Stadium (1990–2009). They won two division championships, 
in 1989 and 1992, and made playoff appearances in 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 
and 2007.[4] The Pittsburgh Pirates have had their spring training facilities 
based in Bradenton, Florida since in 1969, when the city met with Pirates' 
general manager Joe Brown and owner John W. Galbreath and both sides agreed 
to a lease of 40 years, with an option for another 40 years.[7] After the 
Reds' spring-training departure from Florida's Grapefruit League to Arizona's 
Cactus League in 2009, the Reds and Pirates did an "affiliate-swap". The 
Pirates took over the Sarasota Reds, while the Reds became the parent club 
of the Pirates' former Class A-Advanced affiliate, the Lynchburg Hillcats 
of the Carolina League.[8] On November 10, 2009, baseball officials voted 
to allow the Pirates to purchase and uproot the Sarasota Reds.[9] The Pirates 
moved the team to Bradenton, where they were renamed the Bradenton Marauders.[8] 
The Marauders became the first Florida State League team located in Bradenton 
since the Bradenton Growers folded in 1926.[10] The Marauders are also 
the Pirates' first affiliate in the Florida State League since the Leesburg 
Pirates ended play in 1948. On April 8, 2010, the Marauders played their 
first game in front of 2,396 spectators at McKechnie Field. The inaugural 
game ended in 18–3 Bradenton victory over the Fort Myers Miracle. Pittsburgh 
Pirates prospect, Bryan Morris, was the team's starting pitcher. The team's 
first hit came off its first batter, Greg Picart. Meanwhile, Quincy Latimore 
registered the team's first home run and run scored. In the fourth inning 
of the game, Jeremy Farrell registered the team's first grand slam. Calvin 
Anderson, Eric Fryer, Robbie Grossman, Joel Hanrahan, Starling Marté, and 
Tony Sanchez also played for the Marauders in their first game.[11][12] 
A few nights later on April 12, 2010, the Marauders completed their first 
ever four game series sweep at McKechnie Field. The team capped off their 
first ever, four game series sweep with a final score of 6–2 over Fort 
Myers.[13] The team's first loss came on Thursday April 15, 2010, when 
they were defeated 3–2 by the Jupiter Hammerheads at Roger Dean Stadium.[14] 
The Marauders' first home loss came on Saturday April 17, 2010, by a score 
of 10–7, to the St. Lucie Mets.[15] On May 16, 2010, Bryan Morris became 
the very first Marauder to be promoted, when he was called up to the Pirates' 
Double A affiliate, the Altoona Curve.[16] The Marauders finished their 
2010 inaugural season with a 76–62 record and led the league in runs, batting 
average, on-base percentage and on-base plus slugging, and they also finished 
fifth (out of 12 teams) in runs allowed and fourth in ERA. They also finished 
third in the league in overall winning percentage. The team lost the Southern 
Division Championship to the Charlotte Stone Crabs 2 games to 1.[17] In 
March 2011, Nathan Adcock became the first player from the Marauders to 
make a major league team's 25-man roster. Adcock was added to the Kansas 
City Royals roster after he was chosen by the team in the Rule 5 draft.[18] 
The Marauders play struggled during the first half of the 2011 FSL season. 
The team finished the first half of the season with a 30–40 record and 
never really contending for the South Division title. At the start of the 
season's second half, the Marauders posted a 7–5 record. Two scheduled 
home games were also moved to Port Charlotte's Sports Park while McKechnie 
Field's roof underwent construction earlier in the season. However one 
of the biggest stories involving the team came in the form of improved 
attendance. After 40 homes, the Marauders drew 56,718 fans to their home 
games in 2011, with a game average of 1,418 fans. The team ranks eighth 
in attendance in the Florida State League. In all of 2010, the team drew 
51,856 fans in 70 home dates, only the Dunedin Blue Jays drew fewer fans. 
According to team officials, the turn-around attendance is believed to 
be a result of the team having a full season to market itself and establish 
a fanbase.[19] By the season's end, the team drew a total regular season 
attendance of 103,978 fans, doubling the previous year's attendance.[20] 
On August 18, 2011, Bradenton's Robbie Grossman became the first minor 
league player to score 100 runs and walk 100 times in a season since Nick 
Swisher did so in 2004. He is also the first player in the Florida State 
League to walk 100 times since 1998.[21] Ramon Cabrera was also awarded 
the Florida State League batting title on September 5 by finishing the 
2011 season with a .343 batting average. Three of the FSL's top four hitters 
were members of the Marauders: Cabrera (1st), Eleyvs Gonzalez (2nd) and 
Adalberto Santos (4th).[22] On August 30, 2011, the Marauders defeated 
the Palm Beach Cardinals, 6–3, to clinch the Florida State League's second 
half title, for the second time in two years, and playoff berth.[23] However 
the team would go on to lose the Southern Division Championship, 2 games 
to 1, for the second straight year.[24] The 2012 campaign was the first 
in which the Marauders failed to make the playoffs. However the year still 
was memorable for having the Pirates' top prospect in the line-up, Gerrit 
Cole. It was also the first in which the team used their alternate logo 
which features two crossed bats behind a skull wearing an eye patch.[25] 
Bradenton missed the playoffs again in 2013, however the line-up once again 
featured the top prospect for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Gregory Polanco. 
Shortstop Alen Hanson, Polanco, and starting pitcher Nick Kingham represented 
Bradenton at the 52nd Annual FSL All-Star Game.[26] Jeff Locke also became 
the first Marauders player to make the roster for the Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game.[27] In 2014 the journey of current Marauders' player Rinku 
Singh from India to professional baseball was portrayed in the movie Million 
Dollar Arm. The film starred Jon Hamm and was produced by Walt Disney Pictures.[28] 
The Marauders recognized Singh with a commemorative bobblehead that was 
given away at the gates to the first 1,000 fans on Saturday, May 17 against 
Dunedin.[29] The club's 2014 roster consisted of three of the Pirates top 
20 prospects, as comprised by MLB.com: pitcher Tyler Glasnow, outfielder 
Josh Bell and catcher Jin De-Jhang.[30] The club also hosted the 2014 Florida 
State League All-Star Game on Saturday, June 14 at McKechnie Field.[31] 
The Marauders were represented in the game by outfielder Josh Bell and 
left-handed pitcher Orlando Castro.[32] The Marauders returned to the playoffs 
in 2014 by clinching Second Half South Division Championship for the third 
time in five years. However the team was eliminated by Fort Myers in the 
first round. Still the club won, a franchise-best, 78 games in the regular 
season and swept the Florida State League Pitcher of the Year (Tyler Glasnow), 
and the Player of the Year (Josh Bell) awards.[33] Despite a late season 
surge, the 2015 Marauders were eliminated from playoff contention with 
a 4-1 loss to the St. Lucie Mets on September 4.[34] However the following 
season proved much better for the Marauders. On June 20, 2016, the Marauders’ 
clinched a first-half division title for the first time in franchise history.[35] 
On September 7, 2016, the Marauders defeated the St. Lucie Mets with a 
4-1 win in Game 2 of the FSL South Division Series at McKechnie Field. 
The win advanced the Marauders to the Florida State League Championship 
Series for the first time in franchise history.[36] A week later on September 
12, 2016, the Marauders defeated the Tampa Yankees, 3 games to 1, at McKechnie 
Field to win their first Florida State League title.[37] The Pirates do 
not call the club the Bradenton Pirates, which has been used in the past 
by the Gulf Coast League Pirates, the team was given an original name and 
logo. According to Pittsburgh Pirates President Frank Coonelly; the Marauders' 
uniforms are closely associated with the Pirates brand, but also allows 
for the team to have its own unique identity. The Marauders uniforms incorporate 
the Marauders logo and letter script, while the colors mirror the Pirates' 
black and gold colors. White uniforms are worn for games played at McKechnie 
Field. These white uniforms feature the "Marauders" team name across the 
chest of the sleeved jersey, as well as the Marauders logo on the cap. 
During the Marauders 2010 inaugural season, the home jerseys also featured 
a commemorative patch on the sleeve. Gray uniforms are worn for Marauders 
road games. These gray uniforms feature the name "Bradenton" across the 
chest of the sleeved jersey and a styled "B" logo on the cap. Meanwhile, 
batting practice jerseys are worn during home and road batting practice, 
as well as during select games throughout the year. These jersey are black 
and feature the Marauders logo on the left chest, along with yellow and 
red accents along the sides. The Marauders also have an alternate gold 
cap with a black bill and the uniquely styled "B" logo on the cap representing 
the City of Bradenton. The gold cap is reminiscent of the one worn by the 
Pirates of the early 1970s. A second alternate black cap with the styled 
"B" logo is also in use.[38] In December 2011, the team unveiled an alternate 
logo, that is used for select games, for use on their caps during the 2012 
season. The logo features a pair of crossed bats and a smiling skull with 
a patch over its right eye.[39] On May 31, 2012, the Marauders dressed 
in Bradenton Growers' uniforms during a 2-1 win over the Fort Myers Miracle 
for Turn Back the Clock Night at McKechnie Field. The team took the opportunity 
to honor the Growers, who last played in 1926 and were the last Florida 
State League team to be based in Bradenton prior to the Marauders' arrival 
in 2010.[40] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches 7-day
