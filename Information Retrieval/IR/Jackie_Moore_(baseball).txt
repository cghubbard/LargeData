As player As manager As coach Jackie Spencer Moore (born February 19, 1939) 
is a former Major League Baseball catcher, coach and manager. He spent 
all or parts of 12 years over five separate terms as a Texas Rangers coach, 
and 32 years in all as a coach for eight different MLB teams.[1] Moore 
managed in the Majors for the Oakland Athletics (1984–86), and played part 
of one season with the Detroit Tigers as a third-string catcher in 1965. 
After graduating from Bellaire High School in Houston, Texas, Moore joined 
the Tigers as an amateur free agent in 1957 when just eighteen years old. 
He started his minor-league career as an outfielder, with the Montgomery 
Rebels in 1957, but was converted to catcher in 1958 and remained behind 
the plate the rest of his playing career. He hit .264, with 43 home runs 
and 162 runs batted in, in the eight years in the Tigers' farm system before 
being called up to the parent club for the 1965 season only. He caught 
12 innings of a 13-inning marathon against the California Angels in his 
Major League debut, and his first MLB hit was a thirteenth-inning single 
that moved the eventual winning run to third.[2] But after that, he didn't 
get much playing time behind perennial All-Star Bill Freehan and backup 
catcher John Sullivan. His Major League career consisted of just 53 at-bats 
with a meager .094. On October 4, 1965, the Tigers acquired starting pitcher 
Bill Monbouquette from the Boston Red Sox for George Smith, George Thomas 
and a player to be named later, which turned out to be Moore just nine 
days later. He spent 1967 in the BoSox organization as a catcher for the 
Triple-A Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League before retiring 
as an active player. Despite his brief playing stint in the Majors, Moore 
spent over forty years coaching in the game, most of which has been at 
the MLB level. His post-playing career began in the Red Sox farm system 
in 1968 as the manager of the Jamestown Falcons of the short-season Class 
A New York–Penn League. In two seasons under Moore, Jamestown went 64–85. 
He then was hired as bullpen coach for the Seattle Pilots shortly after 
their one and only season in Major League Baseball (1969), and went with 
them when they moved to Milwaukee and became the Brewers starting in 1970.[3] 
He was their bullpen coach through 1972, when he was released at the end 
of the season. He was hired by new Texas Rangers manager Whitey Herzog 
as the Rangers' first base coach shortly afterward for his first stint 
with the Rangers. After the 1973 season he was retained when Billy Martin 
took over as the Rangers' pilot in 1974.[4] After one season under Martin, 
Moore then managed Texas' Double-A farm team, the Pittsfield Rangers of 
the Eastern League, for the first half of 1975 before returning to the 
Rangers for his second term as a coach when Frank Lucchesi became their 
new manager, replacing Martin, in mid-season. After 1976, he joined one 
of the American League's 1977 expansion teams, the Toronto Blue Jays, and 
spent three seasons working for skipper Roy Hartsfield, but, during the 
1979 campaign, he announced that he wouldn't return to the Jays for the 
following season. He rejoined the Texas coaching staff in 1980, but after 
just one season was let go when manager Pat Corrales and his entire staff 
were fired. In 1981, Billy Martin, now manager of the Oakland Athletics, 
invited Moore to coach first base for his "Billy Ball" team. He remained 
with the club after Steve Boros replaced Martin in 1983, and eventually 
replaced Boros as manager on May 24, 1984. In his only full season at the 
helm, 1985, the A's went 77–85. The 1986 Athletics' record hovered around 
.500 until an 8–23 skid dropped the team's record to 29–44 in mid-June, 
worst in the majors. Moore, who went 163–190 (.462) in his 2+ years managing 
the A's, was replaced on an interim basis on June 25 by Jeff Newman, and 
in early July by Tony La Russa, who stayed in Oakland through 1995 before 
concluding his brilliant managerial career with the St. Louis Cardinals 
from 1996 to 2011. In 1987, Moore caught on as a coach with the Montreal 
Expos under manager Buck Rodgers, and remained Montreal's third base coach 
through 1989. He celebrated his only World Series championship with Lou 
Piniella's Cincinnati Reds when he joined them in 1990 as their bench coach. 
He stayed with the Reds through Piniella's departure in 1992, after which 
he left for his fourth stint in Texas (1993–1994, during the managerial 
tenure of Kevin Kennedy), followed by three seasons as bench coach for 
the Colorado Rockies on the staff of Don Baylor. In 2000, Moore was appointed 
the first manager in the history of the Round Rock Express, the Double-A 
affiliate of the Houston Astros owned by a syndicate including Baseball 
Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan. He led his team to a Texas League championship 
with an 83–57 record in their first season to earn "Manager of the Year" 
honors. He followed that up with league titles in 2001 and 2002, and division 
titles in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, the Express moved up to Triple-A in the 
Pacific Coast League. He remained their manager through 2007, winning a 
division crown in 2006. In his five Texas League seasons the Express went 
376–324; in the Pacific Coast League, 220–210. On September 30, 2007, he 
was named the Houston Astros' bench coach for the 2008 season by manager 
Cecil Cooper. Moore was Cooper's first professional baseball manager with 
Jamestown in 1968. After just one season, Moore left the Astros to begin 
his fifth term as a coach with the Texas Rangers, reuniting him with Ryan, 
then club president of the Rangers.[5] During five seasons as the bench 
coach for manager Ron Washington, the Rangers won two American League pennants, 
qualified for the playoffs three times, and tied for the second AL wild 
card in 2013. After the Rangers' defeat at the hands of the Tampa Bay Rays 
in a one-game playoff on September 30, 2013, Moore, 74, was notified he 
would not return as the club's bench coach for 2014.[6] Moore and his wife, 
JoAnne, have a son, Johnathan, who was drafted by Texas in the 45th round 
of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, and is currently a catcher/first 
baseman with the Arizona Fall League AZL Rangers.[7] Moore has four children
