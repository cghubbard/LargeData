The Milwaukee Brewers are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They play in the National League Central division. 
Established in Seattle, Washington as the Seattle Pilots in 1969, the team 
became the Milwaukee Brewers after relocating to Milwaukee the following 
season. The franchise played in the American League until 1998, when it 
moved to the National League as part of an MLB realignment plan.[1] As 
of the completion of the game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 
3, 2016 (Which resulted in a 7-4 victory), the franchise has played in 
7,616 regular season games and compiled a win–loss record of 3,628–3,988.[2] 
They have a postseason record of 14–18.[2] The Brewers have figured in 
the MLB postseason picture on four occasions. In the first, the Brewers 
lost to the New York Yankees in the 1981 American League Division Series 
three games to two. The following year, Milwaukee won the 1982 American 
League Championship Series versus the California Angels three games to 
two. In that year’s World Series, the Brewers faced the National League 
Champion St. Louis Cardinals. The series went to a decisive game seven 
and resulted in a Brewers World Series loss. After a 26-season postseason 
drought that remains the third-longest in the expanded-postseason era, 
in their third appearance the Brewers won the 2008 National League Wild 
Card, earning them a berth in the 2008 National League Division Series. 
Milwaukee lost the series, three games to one, against the eventual World 
Series Champion Philadelphia Phillies. Most recently, the Brewers won the 
2011 National League Central Division title and defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 
three games to two in the 2011 National League Division Series. Despite 
winning game one in the 2011 National League Championship Series they would 
be eliminated by the eventual World Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals 
four games to two. The Brewers’ highest winning percentage (.593) was achieved 
in 2011 with a record of 96–66. Conversely, the team’s lowest winning percentage 
(.346) came in 2002 with a record of 56–106. The following table describes 
the Brewers' MLB win–loss record by decade. These statistics are from Baseball-Reference.com's
