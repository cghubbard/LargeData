The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is an American sports stadium located 
in the Exposition Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The stadium 
serves as the current home to the University of Southern California (USC) 
Trojans football team, and as the temporary home for the National Football 
League (NFL)'s Los Angeles Rams. The Coliseum was home to the Rams from 
1946 to 1979, when they moved to Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California, 
and 2016 to 2018, after which they will move to the City of Champions Stadium 
in the City of Inglewood. From 1982 to 1994, the Los Angeles Raiders played 
in the Coliseum. The facility has a listed seating capacity of 93,607 for 
USC football games, making it the largest football stadium in the Pac-12 
Conference, and a capacity of 80,000 for Rams games making the stadium 
the fourth largest in the NFL. The stadium is located in Exposition Park 
and across the street from USC. The Coliseum is jointly owned by the state 
of California, Los Angeles County, and the city of Los Angeles and managed 
and operated by the Auxiliary Services Department of the University of 
Southern California.[9][10] From 1959 to 2016, the Los Angeles Memorial 
Sports Arena was located adjacent to the Coliseum; the Sports Arena was 
closed in March 2016 and demolished between August and October 2016. Banc 
of California Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium and future home of Major 
League Soccer expansion club Los Angeles FC, will be built on the former 
Sports Arena site and is scheduled to open in March 2018. The Coliseum 
is the first stadium to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, in 
1932 and 1984 and has been proposed to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.[11] 
The stadium was the temporary home of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major 
League Baseball from 1958 to 1961 and was the host venue for games 3, 4, 
and 5 of the 1959 World Series. It was the site of the First AFL-NFL World 
Championship Game, later called Super Bowl I, and Super Bowl VII. Additionally, 
it has served as a home field for a number of other teams, including the 
Los Angeles Raiders of the NFL, and UCLA Bruins football. It was declared 
a National Historic Landmark on July 27, 1984, the day before the opening 
ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.[8] The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 
Commission, which consists of three voting members appointed by the three 
ownership interests and meets on a quarterly basis, provides public oversight 
of the master lease agreement with USC. Under the lease the University 
has day-to-day management and operation responsibility for both the Coliseum 
and Sports Arena. The 98-year lease took effect on July 29, 2013, and was 
signed by the parties on September 5, 2013. The agreement requires the 
University to make approximately $100 million in physical improvements 
to the Coliseum, pay $1 million each year rent to the State of California, 
maintain the Coliseum's physical condition at the same standard used on 
the USC Campus, and assume all financial obligations for the operations 
and maintenance of the Coliseum and Sports Arena Complex.[12][13] The Coliseum 
is now primarily the home of the USC Trojans football team and the home 
of the Los Angeles Rams until their new stadium is completed in 2019. Most 
of USC's regular home games, especially the alternating games with rivals 
UCLA and Notre Dame, attract a capacity crowd. The current official capacity 
of the Coliseum is 93,607.[14][15] USC's women lacrosse and soccer teams 
use the Coliseum for selected games, usually involving major opponents 
and televised games.[16] USC also rents the Coliseum to various events, 
including international soccer games, musical concerts and other large 
outdoor events.[17] The Olympic Cauldron (also known as the Olympic Torch) 
was built for the stadium's two Olympic Games. It is still lit during the 
fourth quarter of USC football games, and other special occasions (e.g., 
when the Olympics are being held in another city). It was lit to honor 
the fallen Israeli Athletes from the 1972 Munich Olympics Games. It was 
also lit for several days following the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster 
in 1986. The torch was lit for over a week following the September 11 attacks 
in 2001. In 2004, the cauldron was lit non-stop for seven days in tribute 
to president Ronald Reagan, who had died. It was lit again in April 2005 
following the death of Pope John Paul II, who had celebrated Mass at the 
Coliseum during his visit to Los Angeles in 1987. At the Los Angeles Dodgers 
50th anniversary game on March 29, 2008, the torch was lit for the ThinkCure! 
charity ceremony, while Neil Diamond's "Heartlight" was played and the 
majority of the attendees turned on their complimentary souvenir keychain 
flashlights. It was lit for the duration of Special Olympics World Games 
held in Los Angeles from July 25, 2015 to August 2, 2015. The cauldron 
was most recently lit for the returning Los Angeles Rams first home game 
on September 18, 2016 against the Seattle Seahawks. The Coliseum was commissioned 
in 1921 as a memorial to LA veterans of World War I (rededicated to all 
United States veterans of World War I in 1968). The official ground breaking 
ceremony took place on December 21, 1921 with work being completed in just 
over 16 months, on May 1, 1923.[18] Designed by John and Donald Parkinson, 
the original bowl's initial construction costs were $954,873. When the 
Coliseum opened in 1923, it was the largest stadium in Los Angeles with 
a capacity of 75,144. In 1930, however, with the Olympics due in two years, 
the stadium was extended upward to seventy-nine rows with two tiers of 
tunnels, expanding the seating to 101,574. The now-signature torch was 
added. For a time it was known as Olympic Stadium. The Olympic cauldron 
torch which burned through both Games remains above the peristyle at the 
east end of the stadium as a reminder of this, as do the Olympic rings 
symbols over one of the main entrances. The football field runs east to 
west with the press box on the south side of the stadium. The scoreboard 
and video screen that tower over the peristyle date back to 1983; they 
replaced a smaller scoreboard above the center arch installed in 1972, 
which in turn supplanted the 1937 model, one of the first all-electric 
scoreboards in the nation. Over the years new light towers have been placed 
along the north and south rims. The large analog clock and thermometer 
over the office windows at either end of the peristyle were installed in 
1955. In the mid-and late 1950s the press box was renovated and the "Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum" lettering and Olympic rings, lighted at night, 
were added to the eastern face of the peristyle tower. Between the double 
peristyle arches at the east end is the Coliseum's "Court of Honor"—plaques 
recognizing many of the memorable events and participants in Coliseum history, 
including a full list of 1932 and 1984 Olympic gold medalists. (The complete 
roster of honorees can be seen below). A pair of life-sized bronze nude 
statues of male and female athletes atop a 20,000 pound (9,000 kg) post-and-lintel 
frame formed the Olympic Gateway created by Robert Graham for the 1984 
games. The statues, modeled on water polo player Terry Schroeder [19] and 
long jumper from Guyana, Jennifer Inniss, who participated in the games, 
were noted for their anatomical accuracy. A decorative facade bearing the 
Olympic rings was erected in front of the peristyle for the 1984 games, 
and the structure remained in place through that year's football season. 
The stadium rim and tunnels were repainted in alternating pastel colors 
that were part of architect Jon Jerde's graphic design for the games; these 
colors remained until 1987. For many years the Coliseum was capable of 
seating over 100,000 spectators. In 1964 the stadium underwent its first 
major renovation in over three decades. Most of the original pale green 
wood-and-metal bench seating was replaced by individual theater-type chairs 
of dark red, beige, and yellow; these seats remain in place today, though 
the yellow color was eliminated in the 1970s. The seating capacity was 
reduced to approximately 93,000. The Coliseum was problematic as an NFL 
venue. At various times in its history, it was either the largest or one 
of the largest stadiums in the NFL, making it difficult to sell out. Since 
the NFL's blackout rule barred games from being televised locally unless 
they were sold out 72 hours before kickoff, this meant Rams (and later 
Raiders) games were often blacked out in Southern California. Partly due 
to this, from 1964 to the late 1970s it was common practice to shift the 
playing field to the closed end of the stadium and install end zone bleachers 
in front of the peristyle, limiting further the number of seats available 
for sale. For USC–UCLA and USC-University of Notre Dame games, which often 
attracted crowds upward of 90,000, the bleachers were moved eastward and 
the field was re-marked in its original position. When a larger east grandstand 
was installed in 1977–1978 at the behest of Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom, 
the capacity was just 71,500. With the upcoming 1984 Summer Olympic Games, 
a new track was installed and the playing field permanently placed inside 
it. However, the combination of the stadium's large, relatively shallow 
design, along with the presence of the track between the playing field 
and the stands, meant that some of the original end zone seats were as 
far from the field by the equivalent length of another football field. 
To address these and other problems, the Coliseum underwent a $15 million 
renovation before the 1993 football season which included the following:[1] 
Additionally, for Raiders home games, tarpaulins were placed over seldom-sold 
sections, reducing seating capacity to approximately 65,000. The changes 
were anticipated to be the first of a multi-stage renovation designed by 
HNTB that would have turned the Coliseum into a split-bowl stadium with 
two levels of mezzanine suites (the peristyle end would have been left 
as is). After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, however, $93 million was 
required from government agencies (including the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency) to repair earthquake damage, and the renovations demanded by the 
Raiders were put on hold indefinitely. The Raiders then redirected their 
efforts toward a proposed stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood before 
electing to move back to the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum prior to the 
1995 season. The last element of the Northridge earthquake repairs was 
the replacement of the condemned press box with a new press box in 1995. 
In August 2011, construction began on the Coliseum's west end on a new 
6,000 square-foot high-definition video scoreboard, accompanying the existing 
video scoreboard on the peristyle (east end) of the stadium.[21] The video 
scoreboard officially went into operation on September 3, 2011, at USC 
football's home opener versus the University of Minnesota, with the game 
being televised on ABC. In July 2013, USC gained the master lease of the 
Coliseum, after the previously governing Coliseum Commission failed to 
deliver promised renovations.[22] Part of the 98-year lease contract states 
that USC will provide $100 million in improvements in the first half of 
the contract, with $70 million of that coming in the first 10 years.[23] 
On October 29, 2015, the University of Southern California unveiled an 
estimated $270-million plan to renovate and restore the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum. The proposed upgrades include replacing all seats in the stadium, 
adding new aisles and widening some seats, a new sound system, construction 
of a large structure on the southern side of the stadium that contains 
box suites, premium lounges, and an updated press box, restoration of the 
Peristyle, stadium wide wifi, new HIgh Definition video screens, new and 
upgraded concession stands, upgraded entry concourses, new lighting, modernization 
of plumbing and electrical systems, and a reduction in capacity of about 
16,000 seats, with the final total at approximately 77,500 seats.[24] The 
plans have been met with mixed reactions from the public.[25] The Los Angeles 
2024 Olympic bid committee proposes spending $300 million in added renovations 
to support its bid added to USC's total.[26] Construction is expected to 
start after the conclusion of the 2017 football season, and is scheduled 
to be completed by the fall of 2019. USC officials stated that construction 
will be planned around the school's (and the Rams') 2018 home football 
schedule, with no interruption. On October 6, 1923, Pomona College and 
USC played in the inaugural game at the Los Angeles Coliseum, with the 
Trojans prevailing 23–7. Situated just across the street from Exposition 
Park, USC agreed to play all its home games at the Coliseum, a circumstance 
that contributed to the decision to build the arena. From 1928 to 1981, 
the UCLA Bruins also played home games at the Coliseum. When USC and UCLA 
played each other, the "home" team (USC in odd-numbered years, UCLA in 
even), occupied the north sideline and bench, and its band and rooters 
sat on the north side of the stadium; the "visiting" team and its contingent 
took to the south (press box) side of the stadium. Excepting the mid-1950s 
and 1983–2007, the two teams have worn their home jerseys for the UCLA-USC 
rivalry football games; this tradition was renewed in 2008, even though 
the two schools play at different stadiums. In 1932, the Coliseum hosted 
the 1932 Summer Olympic Games; the first of two Olympiads hosted at the 
stadium. The Coliseum served as the site of the field hockey, gymnastics, 
the show jumping part of the equestrian, and the track and field events 
along with the opening and closing ceremonies.[27] The 1932 games marked 
the introduction of the Olympic Village as well as the victory podium.[8] 
The former Cleveland Rams of the National Football League relocated to 
the Coliseum in 1946, becoming the Los Angeles Rams; but the team later 
relocated again, first to Anaheim in 1980, then to St. Louis, Missouri 
in 1995 only to move back to Los Angeles in 2016. The Los Angeles Dons 
of the All-America Football Conference played in the Coliseum from 1946 
to 1949, when the Dons franchise merged with its NFL cousins just before 
the two leagues merged.[28] In 1960 the American Football League's Los 
Angeles Chargers played at the Coliseum before relocating to San Diego 
the next year. Among other sporting events held at the Coliseum over the 
years was Major League Baseball, which was held at the Coliseum when the 
Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League relocated from Brooklyn, New 
York in 1958. The Dodgers played here until Dodger Stadium was completed 
in time for the 1962 season. Even allowing for its temporary status, the 
Coliseum was extremely ill-suited for baseball, which requires roughly 
2.5 times more area than a football gridiron. As a result, foul territory 
was almost nonexistent down the first base line, but was very expansive 
down the third base line with a very large backstop for the catcher. Sight 
lines also left much to be desired; some seats were as far as 710 feet 
(216 m) from the plate. Also, from baseball's point of view, the locker 
rooms were huge, because they were designed for football (not baseball) 
teams. From 1951 to 1971 the Coliseum hosted what is now called the Pro 
Bowl. The field was just barely large enough to fit a baseball diamond. 
In order to shoehorn even an approximation of a baseball field onto the 
playing surface, the left-field fence was set at only 251 feet (77 m) from 
the plate. This seemed likely to ensure that there would be many "Chinese 
home runs", as such short shots were called at the time, and sportswriters 
began jokingly referring to the improvised park as "O'Malley's Chinese 
Theatre"[29] or "The House that Charlie Chan Built", drawing protests from 
the Chinese American community in the Los Angeles area.[30] They also expressed 
concern that cherished home run records, especially Babe Ruth's 1927 seasonal 
mark of 60, might easily fall as a result of 250-foot pop flies going over 
the left-field fence. Sports Illustrated titled a critical editorial "Every 
Sixth Hit a Homer!" [29] Players, too, complained, with Milwaukee Braves' 
ace Warren Spahn calling for a rule that would require any home run to 
travel at least 300 feet (91 m) before it could be considered a home run.[31] 
Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick ordered the Dodgers to erect two 42 feet 
(12.8 m) screens in left field to prevent pop flies from becoming home 
runs. One screen would have topped the left field wall, while the second 
would have been in the stands, 333 feet (101 m) from the plate. A ball 
hit to left would have to clear both screens to be a home run; if it cleared 
the first screen, it would be a ground-rule double. However, the Dodgers 
discovered that the state's earthquake safety laws barred construction 
of a second screen. The first screen was built, however; its cables, towers, 
wires and girders were in play.[32] As it was, the "short porch" in left 
field looked attractive to batters. In the first week of play during the 
1959 season, the media's worst preseason fears seemed to be realized when 
24 home runs were hit in the Coliseum, three of them by Chicago Cubs outfielder 
Lee Walls, not especially distinguished as a hitter. But pitchers soon 
adapted, throwing outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to pull 
the bat hard if they wanted to hit toward left. Perhaps no player took 
better advantage than Dodgers outfielder Wally Moon, who figured out how 
to hit high fly balls that dropped almost vertically just behind the screen. 
By season's end, he had hit 19 homers, all but 5 of them in the coliseum. 
In recognition, such homers were dubbed "Moon Shots."[31] Unable to compel 
the Dodgers to fix the situation, the major leagues passed a note to Rule 
1.04 stating that any ball field constructed after June 1, 1958, must provide 
a minimum distance of 325 feet (99 m) down each foul line. Also, when the 
expansion Los Angeles Angels joined the American League for 1961, Frick 
rejected their original request to use the Coliseum.[33] This rule was 
revoked (or perhaps, simply ignored) when the Baltimore Orioles launched 
the "Retro Ballpark" era in 1993, with the opening of Camden Yards. With 
a right field corner of only 318 feet, this fell short. However, baseball 
fans heartily welcomed the "new/old" style, and all new ballparks since 
then have been allowed to set their own distances. Late that season, the 
screen figured in the National League pennant race. The Braves were playing 
the Dodgers in the Coliseum on September 15, 1959, and Joe Adcock hit a 
ball that cleared the screen but hit a steel girder behind it and got stuck 
in the mesh. According to the ground rules, this should have been a home 
run. However, the umpires ruled it a ground-rule double. Then the fans 
shook the screen, causing the ball to fall into the seats. The umpires 
changed the call to a homer, only to change their minds again and rule 
it a ground-rule double.[32] Adcock was left stranded on second. The game 
was tied at the end of nine innings and the Dodgers won it in the tenth 
inning.[34] At the end of the regular season, the Dodgers and Braves finished 
in a tie. The Dodgers won the ensuing playoff and went on to win the World 
Series. Although less than ideal for baseball due to its poor sight lines 
and short dimensions (left field at 251 feet [mentioned above] and power 
alleys at 320 feet (98 m)) it was ideally suited for large paying crowds. 
Each of the three games of the 1959 Series played there drew over 92,706 
fans, a record unlikely to be seriously threatened anytime soon, given 
the smaller seating capacities of today's baseball parks. A May 1959 exhibition 
game between the Dodgers and the New York Yankees in honor of legendary 
catcher Roy Campanella drew 93,103, the largest crowd ever to see a baseball 
game in the Western Hemisphere until an exhibition game in 2008 between 
the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox to mark the 50th anniversary 
of MLB in Los Angeles. The Coliseum also hosted the second 1959 MLB All-Star 
Game. The Coliseum was also the site of John F. Kennedy's memorable acceptance 
speech at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. It was during that speech 
that Kennedy first used the term "the New Frontier". The Rams hosted the 
1949, 1951, and 1955 NFL championship games at the Coliseum. The Coliseum 
was the site of the very first NFL-AFL Championship Game in January 1967, 
an event since renamed the Super Bowl. It also hosted the Super Bowl in 
1973, but future Super Bowls in the Los Angeles region would instead be 
hosted at the Rose Bowl, which has never had an NFL tenant. The venue was 
also the site of the NFL Pro Bowl from 1951 to 1972 and again in 1979. 
The Los Angeles Wolves of the United Soccer Association played their home 
games in the Coliseum for one year (1967) before moving to the Rose Bowl. 
The largest gathering in the Coliseum's history was a Billy Graham crusade 
which took place on September 8, 1963 with 134,254[35] in attendance, noted 
by the Coliseum's website as an all-time record. With the renovations of 
1964, the capacity of the Coliseum was reduced to roughly 93,000 for future 
events. In July 1972, the Coliseum hosted the "Super Bowl" of Motocross. 
The event was the first motocross race held inside a stadium.[36] It has 
evolved into the AMA Supercross championship held in stadiums across the 
United States and Canada. On August 20, 1972, Wattstax, also known as the 
"Black-Woodstock", took place in the Coliseum. Over 100,000 Black residents 
of Los Angeles attended this concert for African American pride. Later, 
in 1973, a documentary was released about the concert. In 1973, Evel Knievel 
used the entire distance of the stadium to jump 50 stacked cars at the 
stadium. Knievel launched his motorcycle from atop one end of the Coliseum, 
jumping the cars in the center of the field, and stopping high atop the 
other end. The jump was filmed by ABC Wide World of Sports.[37] Also in 
1973, the Coliseum was host to Super Bowl VII which saw the AFC champion 
Miami Dolphins (17–0) defeat the NFC champion Washington Redskins (13–4), 
14–7, and become the first, and presently the only, team in the NFL to 
complete a perfect, undefeated season and postseason. The Los Angeles Rams 
played their home games in the Coliseum until 1979, when they moved to 
Anaheim prior to the 1980 NFL Season. They hosted the NFC Championship 
Game in 1975 & 1978 in which they lost both times to the Dallas Cowboys 
by lopsided margins. The Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer 
League used the Coliseum as their home ground in both the 1977 and 1981 
seasons. The Coliseum was also home to the USFL's Los Angeles Express between 
1983 and 1985. In this capacity, the stadium also is the site of the longest 
professional American football game in history; a triple-overtime game 
on June 30, 1984 (a few weeks before the start of the 1984 Summer Olympics) 
between the Express and the Michigan Panthers, which was decided on a 24-yard 
game winning touchdown by Mel Gray of the Express, 3:33 into the third 
overtime to give Los Angeles a 27–21 win. Until 2012, this game marked 
the only time in the history of pro football that there was more than one 
kickoff in overtime play in the same game.[38] In 1982 the former Oakland 
Raiders moved in. The same year, UCLA decided to move out, relocating its 
home games to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The Coliseum was also the site 
of the 1982 Speedway World Final, held for the first and, to this day, 
only time in the USA. The event saw Newport Beach native Bruce Penhall 
retain the title he had won in front of 92,500 fans at London's Wembley 
Stadium in 1981. An estimated 40,000 fans were at the Coliseum to see Penhall 
retain his title before announcing his retirement from motorcycle speedway 
to take up an acting role on the NBC drama series CHiPs. Los Angeles hosted 
the 1984 Summer Olympics, and the Coliseum became the first stadium to 
host the Summer Olympic Games twice; again serving as the primary track 
and field venue and site of the opening and closing ceremonies.[39] The 
coliseum played host to the 2-day California World Music Festival on April 
7–8, 1979.[40] The Rolling Stones played at the stadium on their 1981 Tattoo 
You tour (9 & 11 October),[41] supported by George Thorogood, J. Geils 
Band, and a relatively unknown newcomer called Prince. Bruce Springsteen 
& The E Street Band concluded their Born in the U.S.A. Tour, with four 
consecutive concerts on September 27, 29–30 and October 2, 1985. These 
shows were recorded and eight songs from the September 30th show appear 
on their box set, entitled Live 1975–85. U2 played at the stadium on leg 
3 of their breakout Joshua Tree tour in 1987 with two consecutive nights, 
November 17th and 18th, 1987. They later returned on their Pop Mart tour, 
June 21st, 1997. The stadium played host to The Monsters of Rock Festival 
Tour, featuring Van Halen, Scorpions, Dokken, Metallica and Kingdom Come, 
on July 24, 1988. A second show was planned to take place on the 23rd, 
but was later canceled. The stadium also played host to Amnesty International's 
Human Rights Now! Benefit Concert on September 21, 1988. The show was headlined 
by Sting and Peter Gabriel and also featured Bruce Springsteen & The E 
Street Band, Tracy Chapman, Youssou N'Dour and Joan Baez. The Coliseum 
was set to be the site of WrestleMania VII on March 24, 1991. However, 
the event was eventually moved to the nearby Los Angeles Memorial Sports 
Arena. Officially, the World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling 
Entertainment) claimed the decision to move the event was due to security 
concerns (this may have been in reference to then-champion Sgt Slaughter, 
who was playing a heel Iraqi sympathizer character to coincide with Operation 
Desert Storm). However, that claim has often been disputed and the venue 
change attributed to low ticket sales.[42] When it was first announced 
that the Coliseum was to host WM7, WWF owner Vince McMahon's original promos 
for the event told that they expected over 100,000 fans to attend. The 
reported attendance in the Sports Arena was 16,158.[citation needed] The 
100,000-plus mark would later occur 25 years later on April 3, 2016 when 
AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas housed 101,763 fans for WrestleMania 32. 
The Raiders began looking to move out of the Coliseum as early as 1986. 
In addition to the delays in renovating the stadium, they never drew well; 
even after they won Super Bowl XVIII in 1984, they had trouble filling 
it. The NFL scheduled all of the Raiders' appearances on Monday Night Football 
as road games since the Los Angeles market would have been blacked out 
due to the Coliseum not being sold out. Finally, in 1995, the Raiders left 
Los Angeles and returned to Oakland, leaving the Coliseum without a professional 
football tenant for the first time since the close of World War II. The 
most recent pro football tenant prior to the return of the Rams was the 
short-lived Los Angeles Xtreme, the first and only champion of the XFL. 
It won the championship game at the Coliseum over San Francisco. The Legends 
Football League began as a halftime spectacular known as the Lingerie Bowl. 
The first 3 years (2004, 2005, 2006) were played at the coliseum. From 
2009 to 2011, a couple of Los Angeles Temptation games were played in the 
coliseum. Beginning in 2015, the Temptation resumed playing at the coliseum 
after 3 seasons at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario. The stadium 
hosted several matches, including the semi-finals and final, of the 1991 
CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer tournament. The United States national team beat 
Honduras in the final. The Coliseum also staged the final match of the 
Gold Cup in the 1996, 1998, and 2000 tournaments. The stadium hosted the 
K-1 Dynamite!! USA mixed martial arts event. The promoters claimed that 
54,000 people attended the event, which would have set a new attendance 
record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States; however, other 
officials estimated the crowd between 20,000 and 30,000.[43] In May 1959, 
the Dodgers had hosted an exhibition game against the reigning World Series 
champion New York Yankees at the Coliseum, a game which drew over 93,000 
people. The Yankees won that game 6–2. As part of their west coast 50th 
anniversary celebration in 2008, the Dodgers again hosted an exhibition 
game against the reigning World Series Champions, the Boston Red Sox.[44] 
The middle game of a three-game set in Los Angeles, held on March 29, 2008, 
was also won by the visitors, by the relatively low score of 7–4, given 
the layout of the field – Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek had joked that 
he expected scores in the 80s. As previously mentioned in the 1950s–1960s 
section, during 1958–1961, the distance from home plate to the left field 
foul pole was 251 feet (76.5 m) with a 42-foot (13 m) screen running across 
the close part of left field. Due to the intervening addition of another 
section of seating rimming the field, the 2008 grounds crew had much less 
space to work with, and the result was a left field foul line only 201 ft 
long (61.3 m), with a 60-foot (18 m) screen, which one Boston writer dubbed 
the "Screen Monster".[45] Even at that distance, 201 feet is also 49 ft 
(14.9 m) short of the minimum legal home-run distance. This being an exhibition 
game, balls hit over the 60 ft (18 m) temporary screen were still counted 
as home runs. There were only a couple of homers over the screen, as pitchers 
adjusted (and Manny Ramirez did not play).[46] A diagram ([47]) illustrated 
the differences in the dimensions between 1959 and 2008: A sellout crowd 
of 115,300 was announced,[48] which set a Guinness World Record for attendance 
at a baseball game, breaking the record set at a 1956 Summer Olympics baseball 
demonstration game between teams from the USA and Australia at the Melbourne 
Cricket Ground. Beginning in June 2007, Insomniac Events began hosting 
their annual Electronic Dance Music Festival, known as Electric Daisy Carnival, 
on the Coliseum grounds, also using nearby Exposition Park. 2007's show 
brought in over 30,000 attendees and 2008's event brought in nearly 75,000 
attendees.[49][50] In 2009 it was expanded to a two-day event, the first 
day brought in 45,000 attendees, and the second night featured 95,000, 
with some estimating that the attendance was actually above 100,000. It 
is currently the biggest electronic dance music festival outside Europe. 
In 2006 the Coliseum Commission focused on signing a long-term lease with 
USC; the school offered to purchase the facility from the state but was 
turned down. After some at-time contentious negotiations, with the university 
threatening in late 2007 to move its home stadium to the Rose Bowl, the 
two sides signed a 25-year lease in May 2008 giving the Coliseum Commission 
8% of USC's ticket sales, approximately $1.5 million a year, but commits 
the agency to a list of renovations.[51] In 2006 the Mexican group RBD 
held a concert during the RBD Tour USA for more than 70,000 people, the 
tickets sold out in less than 30 minutes.[52] On June 23, 2008, the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission announced they were putting the naming 
rights of the Coliseum on the market, predicting a deal valued at $6 million 
to $8 million a year. The funds would go towards financing more than $100 
million in renovations over the next decade, including a new video board, 
bathrooms, concession areas and locker rooms.[51] Additional seating was 
included in the renovation plans which increased the Coliseum's seating 
capacity to 93,607 in September 2008.[14][15] On June 17, 2009, the Coliseum 
was the terminus for the Los Angeles Lakers 2009 NBA Championship victory 
parade. A crowd of over 90,000 attended the festivities, in addition to 
the throngs of supporters who lined the 2-mile parade route. The Coliseum 
peristyle was redesigned in purple and gold regalia to commemorate the 
team and the Lakers' court was transported from Staples Center to the Coliseum 
field to act as the stage. Past parades had ended at Staples Center, but 
due to the newly constructed L.A. Live complex, space was limited around 
the arena.[53] On July 30, 2011, the LA Rising festival with Rage Against 
the Machine, Muse, Rise Against, Lauryn Hill, Immortal Technique and El 
Gran Silencio was hosted at the Coliseum. On April 27, 2013, the stadium 
hosted the Stadium Super Trucks.[54] On July 29, 2013, the Los Angeles 
Memorial Coliseum Commission and USC implemented the Second Amendment to 
the Lease and Agreement between the Coliseum Commission and USC which transferred 
to USC the responsibility for the long-term (98 years) operation of both 
the Coliseum and Sports Arena facilities and the capital renewal of the 
Coliseum.[55] On September 13, 2014 the Coliseum hosted the 5th-place game, 
3rd-place game, and Final of the 2014 Copa Centroamericana in front of 
41,969 spectators. In August 2015, the Coliseum hosted the Opening and 
Closing Ceremonies for the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.[56] 
On October 29, 2015, the University of Southern California unveiled an 
estimated $270-million plan to renovate and restore the stadium.[57] On 
January 13, 2016, the NFL gave permission for the St. Louis Rams to relocate 
back to Los Angeles. The Rams play at the Coliseum until the new stadium 
is ready for the 2019 season, when the team is expected to move into the 
City of Champions Stadium in Inglewood.[58][59] On August 13, 2016, the 
Coliseum hosted its first NFL game at the stadium since 1994, as the Rams 
hosted Dallas Cowboys at a preseason game to a crowd of 89,140 people. 
And that same year on September 18, the Coliseum hosted the first Rams 
regular season home game since 1979, against the Seattle Seahawks. There 
was much debate about the Coliseum's potential to be a modern NFL venue. 
Although the Coliseum has significant historical value, it is regarded 
by some as inadequate to be the home of a major professional sports team. 
Since it was designed and built long before the age of club seats, luxury 
boxes, and the other revenue-generating amenities that modern football 
stadiums possess, any professional team moving to the Coliseum will likely 
have to perform extensive renovations. Also, its status as a National Historic 
Landmark means any renovations would have to be complementary to the most 
identifiable parts of the building, a guideline that was not followed during 
Soldier Field's renovations in 2002. Soldier Field was stripped of its 
landmark status as a result of its renovation. Los Angeles County voters 
have been generally uninterested in appropriating tax revenue toward building 
a new stadium. Without public funds, the costs of renovation would have 
to be borne by any future tenant of the Coliseum. Because of the difficulties 
that the NFL has had with trying to finance a renovated Coliseum, Rose 
Bowl or brand new stadium, pro football has been absent from the second-largest 
media market in the United States for two decades. (The NFL was to award 
a franchise to Los Angeles in 2002, but debate over a stadium, coupled 
with Houston's aggressiveness, led the NFL to award the franchise to Houston 
instead.) On November 10, 2005, then-NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced 
that the NFL and city officials had reached a preliminary agreement on 
bringing an NFL team back to the Coliseum. However, this did not come to 
fruition. An article in the Wednesday, May 24, 2006 issue of the Los Angeles 
Times made light of a proposition to spend tens of millions of dollars 
of city funds to heavily renovate the stadium, and indicated that the city 
may make more than $100 million in added funds available in the future 
toward further renovation. City leaders who support the spending despite 
significant disapproval from the local population cite that the renovations 
are necessary to help attract a new NFL team to the city and that the tax 
revenue generated by the presence of a new franchise team would eventually 
pay back the investment many times over. While a proposal to bring pro 
football back to the Los Angeles area was still in the works (at the time), 
there had been little action taken in recent times of bringing an NFL team 
to the Coliseum. Up until 2013, USC had a series of mostly one- and two-year 
leases with the commission.[60] In November 2007, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio 
Villaraigosa declared that the policy of requiring the NFL to relocate 
to the Coliseum will change and other options will be explored.[61] The 
Coliseum Commission's June 23, 2008 decision to sell naming rights to the 
stadium had signaled a likely end to the prospects of the NFL's returning 
to the Coliseum as the prospect of a naming-rights deal by a future NFL 
team tenant could have helped lure a new pro team.[51] In August 2011, 
Tim Leiweke, President of AEG, Inc., stated publicly that his interest 
in using the Coliseum as a possible temporary venue for an NFL team that 
might relocate to Los Angeles would require that such negotiations with 
AEG be conducted with USC and not with the Coliseum Commission.[citation 
needed] On September 7, 2011, the Coliseum Commission voted unanimously 
to request USC to undertake negotiations for possible management agreement 
regarding the Coliseum and Sports Arena. USC and the Commission began negotiations 
at the end of September and concluded in December 2011 with a Term Sheet 
outlining basic points of agreement negotiated between USC and the Commission 
negotiating committee. The full Commission on December 21, 2011 unanimously 
endorsed the terms and instructed its legal counsel to proceed with development 
of an actual lease agreement so that a draft could be made available for 
public comment. Over the next 18 months the Commission and its staff held 
several public meetings on the draft lease and discussion meetings with 
the California Science Center (representative for the State owned property 
in Exposition Park). During an open session meeting on July 17, 2013, the 
Commission authorized the amendment to the existing USC-Coliseum Commission 
Lease for the operation of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Los Angeles 
Memorial Sports Arena. On July 25, 2013, the Coliseum Commission and USC 
executed this new long-term master lease agreement. It became effective 
on July 29, 2013, and the Commission transferred day-to-day management 
and financial responsibilities for the Coliseum and Sports Arena to USC. 
This included the rehiring by USC, on a fixed term basis, of the Coliseum/Sports 
Arena employees who had been working for the Commission the previous day. 
For most of the former Coliseum Commission employees, the fixed term of 
their employment would be short-lived, ending on May 30, 2014. The new 
master lease contains a provision that requires USC to cooperate with any 
request by the City or County of Los Angeles for use of the Coliseum on 
a temporary basis (no longer than 4 years) by an NFL team. USC is required 
to negotiate in good faith with the NFL to structure a sublease or occupancy 
agreement on fair market terms; USC can require the NFL team to contribute 
to any capital improvements in the Coliseum; USC is not obligated under 
the master lease to incur any additional expense or liabilities from the 
use of the Coliseum by an NFL team. Additionally, under the master lease 
USC has the right to refuse to enter into an agreement with the NFL if 
the school reasonably determines that the NFL team being proposed poses 
security or safety concerns for the USC campus or if the activities associated 
with the NFL team would cause violations of NCAA or Pac-12 bylaws, regulations, 
or policies/procedures.[62] With the Rams relocating to Los Angeles for 
the 2016 NFL season, the Coliseum serves as their temporary stadium until 
City of Champions Stadium is finished in 2019.[63] *For college football 
Records differ between the 2006 USC football media guide and 2006 UCLA 
football media guide. (This may be due to only keeping records for "home" 
games until the 1950s.) The USC Media guide lists the top five record crowds 
as: The UCLA Media guide does not list the 1939 game against USC, and only 
lists attendance for the second game in 1945 for Coliseum attendance records. 
These are the top three listed UCLA record Coliseum crowds: The largest 
crowd to attend a USC football game against an opponent other than UCLA 
or Notre Dame was 96,130 for a November 10, 1951 contest with Stanford 
University. The largest attendance for a UCLA contest against a school 
other than USC was 92,962 for the November 1, 1946 game with Saint Mary's 
College of California. The Los Angeles Rams played the San Francisco 49ers 
before an NFL record attendance of 102,368 on November 10, 1957. This was 
a record paid attendance that stood until September 2009 at Cowboys Stadium, 
though the overall NFL regular season record was broken in a 2005 regular 
season game between the Arizona Cardinals and San Francisco 49ers at Azteca 
Stadium in Mexico City.[65][66] Both records were broken on September 20, 
2009 at the first regular season game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, 
Texas between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants. In 1958 the Rams 
averaged 83,680 for their six home games, including 100,470 for the Chicago 
Bears and 100,202 for the Baltimore Colts. In their 13 seasons in Los Angeles 
the Raiders on several occasions drew near-capacity crowds to the Coliseum. 
The largest were 91,505 for an October 25, 1992 game with the Dallas Cowboys, 
91,494 for a September 29, 1991 contest with the San Francisco 49ers, and 
90,380 on January 1, 1984 for a playoff game with the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
The Coliseum hosted the first AFL-NFL World Championship Game, later called 
the Super Bowl. The January 15, 1967 game, pitting the Green Bay Packers 
against the Kansas City Chiefs, attracted 61,946 fans—a lower-than anticipated 
crowd (by comparison, a regular-season game between the Packers and Rams 
a month earlier drew 72,418). For Super Bowl VII in 1973, which matched 
the Miami Dolphins against the Washington Redskins, the attendance was 
a near-capacity 90,182, a record that would stand until Super Bowl XI at 
the Rose Bowl. The 1975 NFC Championship Game between the Los Angeles Rams 
and Dallas Cowboys had an attendance of 88,919, still the largest crowd 
for a conference championship game since the conference-title format began 
with the 1970 season. The 1983 AFC Championship Game between the Raiders 
and Seattle Seahawks attracted 88,734. The Rams' first NFL game at the 
Coliseum since 1979, after spending fifteen years at Anaheim Stadium and 
then twenty-one seasons in St. Louis, a pre-season contest against the 
Cowboys on August 13, 2016, drew a crowd of 89,140. The team's first regular-season 
home game, on September 18 against the Seattle Seahawks, attracted 91.046 
-- the largest attendance for a Rams game at the Coliseum since 1959. Contemporary 
baseball guides listed the theoretical baseball seating capacity as 92,500. 
Thousands of east-end seats were very far from home plate, and were not 
sold unless needed. The largest regular season attendance was 78,672, the 
Dodgers' home debut in the Coliseum, against the San Francisco Giants on 
April 18, 1958. The May 7, 1959, exhibition game between the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and the 1958 World Series Champion New York Yankees, in honor of 
disabled former Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella, drew 93,103, which was 
a Major League Baseball record prior to 2008. All three Dodgers home games 
in the 1959 World Series with the Chicago White Sox exceeded 90,000 attendance. 
Game 5 drew 92,706 fans, a major league record for a non-exhibition game. 
The attendance for the exhibition game on March 29, 2008, between the Boston 
Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers, was 115,300,[67] setting a new Guinness 
World Record for attendance at a baseball game. The previous record of 
an estimated 114,000 was in the 1956 Summer Olympics at Melbourne Cricket 
Ground for an exhibition game between teams from branches of American Military 
Forces and Australia. "Commemorating outstanding persons or events, athletic
