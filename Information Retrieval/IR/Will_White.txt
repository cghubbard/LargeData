William Henry "Whoop-La" White (October 11, 1854 – August 31, 1911) was 
an American baseball pitcher and manager from 1875 to 1889. He played all 
or parts of 10 seasons in Major League Baseball, primarily for the Cincinnati 
Reds in the National League (1878–1880) and the Cincinnati Red Stockings 
in the American Association (1882–1886). He had three 40-win, and one 40-loss, 
seasons in Cincinnati. During the 1882 and 1883 seasons, he led the American 
Association in wins, compiling an 83–34 win–loss record and a 1.84 earned 
run average (ERA). Over the course of 10 major league seasons, White compiled 
a 229–166 record with a 2.28 ERA. His career ERA ranks ninth on the all-time 
List of Major League Baseball career ERA leaders. White also set a number 
of major league pitching records and still holds several. His 1879 totals 
of 75 complete games, 75 games started, 680 innings pitched, and 2,906 
batters faced remain major league records. He was also the player-manager 
of the Red Stockings for 71 games during the 1884 season, compiling a 44–27 
managerial record. He is also remembered as the first, and for many years 
only, major league player to wear eyeglasses on the baseball field. White 
was born in 1854 in the town of Caton in Steuben County, New York.[1] His 
parents were Lester White (born c. 1820), a farmer, and his wife, Adeline 
(born c. 1823). The couple had at least eight children:[2][3] Oscar Leroy[4] 
(born c. 1844), James (born 1847), Melville (born c. 1851), William, Phebe 
Davis[5] (born c. 1856), Estelle (born c. 1858), George (born c. 1862) 
and Hattie (born c. 1867); they also adopted a girl named Phebe Maynard 
(born c. 1876) when they were in their fifties.[6] White's ancestors likely 
immigrated to America during the colonial period.[7] White came from a 
baseball-playing family. When he was age 13, his older brother, Deacon 
White, began playing professional baseball; Deacon was eventually inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[8] His cousin, Elmer White, played in the 
major leagues in 1871, while Will was 16, and died in 1872 at age 21.[9] 
At least one account indicates that White was also related to Warren White, 
a native of Milton, New York, who played in the major leagues from 1871 
to 1875.[10] Records of White's early years in organized baseball during 
the mid-1870s are scarce. In an 1892 account on "The History of Base Ball 
Pitching", The Sporting Life wrote that White was "about the first" pitcher 
to develop "the sharp curve ball", doing so in 1875.[11] During the 1876 
season, White reportedly pitched for the Binghamton Crickets, where John 
Kelly was his catcher.[12] In 1877, White's older brother, Deacon White, 
was playing at first base for the Boston Red Caps of the National League.[8] 
Deacon, by then an established veteran, brought Will with him to Boston 
for a tryout.[13] Will was given a three-game tryout with the Red Caps, 
making his major league debut on July 20, 1877, at age 22. He pitched three 
complete games and compiled a 2–1 record and a 3.00 earned run average 
(ERA) in 27 innings pitched.[1] During White's tryout with the Red Caps, 
Deacon and Will White "formed the first brother battery in the game."[14] 
Will White accomplished another major league first. He was the first, and 
for many years the only, major league player to wear eyeglasses on the 
baseball field.[14][15] In a later account of White's early years, The 
Sporting Life wrote: "White was about the only pitcher of consequence who 
wore glasses. He had great control of the ball, and he could land one over 
the plate whenever he wanted to notwithstanding he was handicapped by weak 
eyes."[12] The novelty of his wearing eyeglasses was a regular subject 
of coverage, and a 1911 newspaper story on "Eye-Glassed Players" noted 
that there were none in the game at that time and had been none since White. 
The famous slugger, Dan Brouthers, was quoted in the article as follows: 
"Will White, I suppose, was the last of the eye-glassed professionals. 
Near-sighted as Roosevelt – and Teddy could play a good game of ball, I'll 
bet – White was nevertheless a great pitcher. He had the curves, the speed 
and all sorts of scientific trickery."[16][17] In 1878, the White brothers 
joined the Cincinnati Reds, where they were battery-mates for the next 
three seasons.[1][8] The 1878 season was White's first full season in professional 
baseball. He appeared in 52 games for the Reds, all complete games, and 
compiled a 30–21 record and a 1.79 ERA.[1] By July 1878, White had earned 
the nickname "Whoop-La." After pitching a four-hitter against Harry Wright's 
Boston club, the Cincinnati Enquirer ran a headline, "WHOOP-LA, WILLIAM!" 
When George Wright struck out swinging to end the eight inning, the crowd 
in Cincinnati "arose almost to a man and such cheers and waving of hats 
and handkerchiefs were never heard and seen on the grounds." When White 
then walked to the plate and hit the first pitch for a double, there was 
more "howling" by screaming, frantic fans.[18] In 1879, Deacon White took 
over as the manager of the Red Stockings for the first 16 games of the 
season.[19] The brothers also continued to work together as pitcher and 
catcher. After Will threw a four-hit shutout in June 1879, the Cincinnati 
Enquirer wrote that there could be "not a doubt in the world that with 
Jim [Deacon] to back him Will White as a pitcher is to-day without a peer."[20] 
During the 1879 season, Will White established several major league records. 
Out of the 80 games played that year by the Red Stockings, White started 
75 of them, threw 75 complete games, totaled 680 innings pitched and 2,906 
batters faced, and compiled a 43–31 record with a 1.99 ERA and 232 strikeouts. 
White's 1879 totals remain major league records in games started, complete 
games, innings pitched and batters faced. Pud Galvin tied White's games 
started record in 1883, but White's other records remain unmatched more 
than 130 years later.[21][22][23][24] White's complete game and inning 
pitched records have been ranked with "baseball's most unbreakable records,"[25] 
and the most "unapproachable" records.[26] O. P. Caylor, one of the founders 
of the American Association, recalled that White was given the task in 
1879 of demonstrating the curveball to Col. John A. Joyce, the "moving 
spirit" behind the Red Stockings. White was at the time "one of the most 
expert curvers in the profession." Caylor described the demonstration that 
was conducted as follows: "White stood upon the left of the fence at one 
end so that his hand could not possibly pass beyond the straight line, 
and pitched the ball so that it passed to the right of the middle post. 
This it did by three or four inches, but curved so much that it passed 
the third post a half foot to the left. The diagram on page 403 [reproduced 
at right] will illustrate the test."[27] In 1880, White pitched in fewer 
games, but was even more effective by some measures than he had been in 
his record-setting 1879 season. In his third full season, White started 
62 games, all complete games, and compiled a 2.14 ERA in 517-1/3 inning 
pitched.[1] White's performance in 1880 also earned him a 5.2 Wins Above 
Replacement (WAR) rating—the tenth highest WAR rating in the National League 
that year.[1] Unfortunately, White played for a team that compiled the 
lowest batting average in the National League; the 1880 Reds hit for a 
.224 average, 21 points below the league average and 55 points below the 
league-leading Chicago White Stockings.[28] Lacking offensive support, 
White finished the season with an 18–42 win-loss record.[1] The Reds were 
removed from the National League after the 1880 season, and the team folded, 
leaving White without a club. In April 1881, the newest National League 
club, the Detroit Wolverines, signed White after its principal pitcher, 
George Bradley, suffered a with pulmonary hemorrhage during a pre-season 
practice.[29] When White was signed, the Detroit Free Press wrote of him: 
"He is too well known to base ball admirers to need an introduction."[30] 
On May 5, 1881, at Buffalo, New York, White appeared in the fourth game 
played by the Detroit Wolverines. He allowed eight runs and 13 hits, including 
two hits by his brother, Deacon White, who had joined the Buffalo club. 
Hardy Richardson also hit a bases-loaded triple in the ninth inning and 
was thrown out at home plate. The Wolverines lost the game, 8–1, but the 
Detroit Free Press wrote: "White, considering that he has had no practice 
to speak of this season, pitched very well, but he failed to bother the 
batsmen very badly."[31] White appeared in his second, and final, game 
for the Wolverines on May 12, 1881. Detroit lost by a 10–4 score to the 
Worcester Worcesters, and the press was less understanding after a second 
poor showing. The Detroit Free Press wrote: "White, who is an old-fashioned, 
straight-armed pitcher, not a modern underhanded thrower, is not the man 
for a pitcher's position. The Worcesters had no trouble in batting him, 
and the only wonder is that they made no more base hits and runs."[32] 
In his only two games for the 1881 Detroit Wolverines, White compiled an 
0–2 record and a 5.00 ERA in 18 innings.[1] The Detroit team settled on 
George Derby as its lead pitcher, with Stump Wiedman as the change pitcher, 
and White was released after two starts. White finished the 1881 season 
playing for a semipro team in Cincinnati.[33] In November 1881, White signed 
to play with the Cincinnati Red Stockings for the inaugural season of the 
new American Association.[34] During the 1882 season, White compiled a 
40–12 record with a 1.54 ERA. He led the American Association in wins (40), 
complete games (52), and innings pitched (480).[1] White also developed 
into one of the best-fielding pitchers in baseball. During the 1882 season, 
White had 223 fielding assists, a total that stood as the major league 
record for pitchers until Ed Walsh totaled 227 assists in 1907; White's 
total of 223 assists remains the second highest in major league history 
for a pitcher.[35] White's 11.1 WAR rating in 1882 was the highest in the 
major leagues.[36] White also proved to be a decent hitter during the 1882 
season, batting .266 with 28 runs scored and 25 runs batted in. White pitched 
right-hand, but he was a switch hitter.[1] Despite refusing to pitch on 
Sundays, White led the 1882 Red Stockings to their first pennant in 1882.[37] 
In 1883, White compiled a 43–22 record and led the league with 43 wins, 
a 2.09 ERA and six shutouts.[1] White also ranked among the American Association's 
leaders with a 9.1 WAR rating (2nd), 1.000 Walks plus hits per inning pitched 
(WHIP) rating (3rd), 65 games played as pitcher (2nd), 577 innings pitched 
(2nd), 64 games started (2nd), and 64 complete games (2nd). In August 1883, 
White was baptized in the Second Advent denomination by being immersed 
in the Ohio River near Dayton, Kentucky.[38] In 1884, White became a player-manager, 
managing the Reds for the first 71 games of the season and leading the 
club to a 44–27 record.[39] In August 1884, White decided to step down 
as manager, believing he was "of too easy a disposition"; he persuaded 
his catcher, Pop Snyder, to take over as manager.[40] White remained the 
Reds' ace pitcher during the 1884 season, compiling a 34–18 and 3.32 ERA. 
He led the league with seven shutouts and again ranked among the league's 
leading pitchers with a 5.7 WAR rating (8th), 34 wins (5th), 456 innings 
pitched (7th), and 52 complete games (7th).[1] Baseball historian David 
Nemec wrote that White's career suffered in 1884 when the American Association 
adopted a rule granting a batter a base if he was hit by a pitched ball. 
According to Nemec, the new rule deprived White of "one of his chief weapons 
– intimidation."[33] White set a major league record in 1884 with 35 hit 
batsmen, a total that remains the ninth highest in major league history.[41] 
He led the league again in 1885 with 27 batsmen hit by pitch.[1] In an 
article titled "Will White's Misery", the Cincinnati Enquirer wrote after 
a 12–4 loss to the Metropolitans, "If ever a person had the conceit knocked 
completely out of him, that person was Will White yesterday afternoon."[42] 
White played his last full major league season for the Reds in 1885. He 
appeared in 34 games, threw 33 complete games and compiled an 18–15 record 
with a 3.53 ERA.[1] In late August 1885, The Sporting Life correspondent 
from Cincinnati reported that White would not do any further pitching for 
the Reds "for some time to come", noting that the local fans held a "bitter 
feeling" toward White, which had caused the club president to employ other 
pitchers.[43] According to baseball historian Joseph M. Overfield, White's 
"arm had nothing left" by the end of the 1885 season[15] In January 1886, 
The Sporting Life reported that White had "gone back to his first love 
– the grocery business", opening a grocery in Fairmount, near Cincinnati.[44] 
Another published story that same month reported that White's "delivery 
wagon can be seen almost any day on the street. White is not a loafer, 
and when base ball fails he makes money just like other people."[45] White 
returned briefly to baseball in June and July 1886, appearing in three 
games for Cincinnati. He compiled a 1–2 record as his ERA jumped to 4.15 
in 26 innings pitched. He appeared in his last major league game on July 
5, 1886, at age 31.[1] Two days after White's last game, The Sporting Life 
reported: "Will White seems to have disappeared from the scene of action 
as quickly as he appeared. Surely two games didn't settle him."[46] In 
December 1888, White's older brother, Deacon, and Jack Rowe, both of whom 
had been part of baseball's famed "Big Four" throughout the 1880s, purchased 
the Buffalo Bisons, a minor league baseball club, intending to be co-owners, 
managers, and players.[13][47] In March 1889, Deacon White announced that 
he was also going into business in Buffalo with his brother, Will, and 
that Will had agreed to "twirl for the Bisons whenever needed."[48] In 
June 1889, White agreed to become a regular pitcher and also to serve as 
an assistant manager.[49] With Will White returning to the game, The Sporting 
Life again focused on his glasses: "Will White still has his spectacles 
with him. He is the only professional player who wears them."[50] By early 
July, however, the newspaper was focused on his performance as it reported: 
"Will White is still quite a pitcher."[51] However, the brothers' plans 
were thwarted by William Nimick, the owner of the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. 
The Pittsburgh club held the rights to Rowe and Deacon White and refused 
to release them, saying, "If they don't want to play in Pittsburgh, they'll 
play nowhere."[47][52] In July 1889, Rowe and Deacon White agreed to play 
for Pittsburgh,[53] and Will White was left in Buffalo to take over as 
"solo manager" of the Bisons.[54] After two years away from baseball, White 
started 20 games for the 1889 Bisons, threw 17 complete games, and compiled 
a 7–13 record and a 2.33 ERA in 174 innings pitched.[55] During his 10 
years in the major leagues, White compiled a 229–166 win-loss record. He 
ranks among the major leagues' all-time career leaders with a 2.28 ERA 
(9th),[56] 394 complete games (17th), 1.111 Walks and Hits per Innings 
Pitched (27th), 221 wild pitches (8th), 106 errors as pitcher (15th), 1.260 
walks per 9 innings pitched (17th), and 36 shutouts (63rd).[1] White was 
married in approximately 1876 to Harriet Holmes. They had a daughter, Katherine, 
born in December 1876.[15][57] After retiring from baseball, White and 
his wife lived in Buffalo, New York. White worked with his brother, Deacon, 
in the optical supply business, doing business as the Buffalo Optical Company.[58][59] 
In 1895, The Sporting Life wrote that the brothers owned 99% of the company, 
which was a "great success" and had "taken a handsome store on Main street, 
Buffalo."[60] At the time of the 1900 U.S. Census, White and his wife were 
living in Buffalo with their daughter, and White was employed as an optician.[57] 
In 1910, White remained living in Buffalo working as an optician. His household 
at that time included his wife and daughter, as well as a nephew and a 
cousin.[61] White died in August 1911 at his summer home in Port Carling, 
Ontario, Canada.[1][15] The cause of death was drowning.[62] According 
to one account, he was teaching his niece to swim, suffered a heart attack 
while in the water and died.[15] He was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery
