Michael Brooks Kieschnick (born June 6, 1972) is a former American baseball 
utility player and pitcher who played six seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He played the majority of his career for the Chicago Cubs and the 
Milwaukee Brewers, and also played for the Cincinnati Reds and Colorado 
Rockies from 1996 to 2004. He batted left-handed but threw right-handed. 
During the initial part of his major league career, he was exclusively 
a position player, playing the outfield; for his final two seasons in the 
big leagues, he served primarily as a relief pitcher who also occasionally 
doubled as an outfielder and pinch hitter. Kieschnick played college baseball 
at the University of Texas at Austin for the Texas Longhorns from 1990 
until 1993, when he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs. After two seasons 
with the team, he was selected by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 1997 
expansion draft. However, he never played a major league game for them 
and played only in the minor leagues during his tenure with the organization. 
Although he was originally projected to be a hitter, he eventually revived 
his career by returning to pitching, which he excelled at during his years 
at the Texas Longhorns. He was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2003 
and played his final major league game for them on October 3, 2004. Kieschnick 
is best known for being the only player to win the Dick Howser Trophy twice.[1] 
Kieschnick was born in Robstown, Texas on June 6, 1972. He graduated from 
high school at Mary Carroll High School in Corpus Christi, Texas.[2] He 
then attended college at the University of Texas at Austin, where he played 
three seasons of baseball.[3] During his time with the Texas Longhorns, 
Kieschnick won the Dick Howser Trophy (bestowed annually to the national 
college baseball player of the year)[4] in 1992.[5] He won the award again 
in 1993, thus becoming the only player to win the honor twice.[6] In his 
three years with the Longhorns, Kieschnick batted .360 and slugged 43 home 
runs and 215 runs batted in, in addition to having a 34–8 win–loss record 
and a 3.05 ERA.[7] Because of his rare ability of competency in both hitting 
and pitching,[8][9] Kieschnick was recognized as one of the most versatile 
players in college baseball.[7] Even though Kieschnick did not play a defensive 
position,[5] he was selected in the first round (and tenth overall pick) 
of 1993 amateur draft by the Chicago Cubs.[10] He received a $650,000 signing 
bonus and was instantly viewed as the organization's best prospect in terms 
of hitting for power.[11] Kieschnick honed his skills in the minor leagues 
and was ranked as the Cubs' top prospect by Baseball America during his 
three seasons in the Cubs farm system. Even though he had pitched well 
at the college level, the team viewed Kieschnick's offense as being more 
valuable.[9] Accordingly, he was used exclusively as a position player 
by the Cubs at both the minor and major league levels. Kieschnick made 
his major league debut for the Cubs on April 3, 1996.[2] Kieschnick never 
lived up to his potential and was unable to produce the form he showed 
in the minor leagues.[9] After appearing in only 25 games during the 1996 
season,[2] he was demoted back to the minors in the final week of spring 
training of 1997.[12] He was described as being "stunned and dejected"[12] 
when he was informed of the decision to replace him with Brant Brown.[13] 
Nevertheless, Kieschnick was recalled on April 11 and eventually won the 
left field position.[12] He played 39 games and finished the season with 
a disappointing .200 batting average, 2 doubles, 4 home runs and 12 RBIs, 
while striking out 21 times.[2] After the season ended, Kieschnick was 
selected as the 64th pick of the 1997 expansion draft by the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays[2] and was regarded as "just another underachieving Cub."[14] 
Kieschnick was never given the opportunity to play a major league game 
for the Devil Rays.[2] He was instead consigned to the minor leagues and 
shuffled between the Gulf Coast League Devil Rays, St. Petersburg Devil 
Rays, Durham Bulls and Edmonton Trappers during his two-year stint with 
the organization.[15] In 1999, he was loaned out to the Anaheim Angels 
for the majority of the year.[15][16] At the end of the season, Kieschnick 
became a free agent for the first time in his career and subsequently signed 
for the Cincinnati Reds.[2] In the 2000 season, Kieschnick spent most of 
his time in the minors: his major-league stint that year was limited to 
just fourteen games and he was unable to garner any hits in his 13 plate 
appearances that year. He proceeded to sign with the Colorado Rockies as 
a free agent at the season's end. He again split his time between the minors 
and the majors. In the 45 major league games he played in 2001, he batted 
.238, had 10 hits in 42 at bats, amassed 3 home runs and 9 RBIs and struck 
out 13 times. Kieschnick signed with the Cleveland Indians for the 2002 
season, but was released prior to the end of spring training. Picked up 
by the Chicago White Sox a month later and signed to a minor league deal, 
Kieschnick then radically changed his career approach. Up to this point, 
Kieschnick had pitched in exactly two minor league games in his career—both 
token relief appearances in blowout games, one in 1999 and one in 2001. 
Nevertheless, in the 2002 season Kieschnick switched his primary focus 
to pitching, hoping to better his chances of making a major league roster 
as a pitcher who was also a versatile utility player. He ended up spending 
the entire 2002 season in the minor leagues with the triple-A Charlotte 
Knights, appearing in 25 games as a relief pitcher, 1 as an outfielder 
and over 40 as either a pinch-hitter or DH.[2][15] He finished the season 
batting .275 with 13 home huns in just 189 at bats; as a pitcher, he was 
0-1 with a 2.59 ERA in just over 31 innings pitched. Signing with the Milwaukee 
Brewers organization in time for the 2003 campaign, Kieschnick returned 
to the majors in the role of pitcher/utility outfielder/DH. During the 
2003 season, Kieschnick became the first player in the MLB to hit home 
runs as a pitcher, designated hitter and pinch hitter in the same season.[17] 
Throughout 2003 and 2004, the Milwaukee Brewers took advantage of Kieschnick's 
versatility, using him as a pinch hitter, designated hitter, and left fielder 
in addition to his primary role in the bullpen. Kieschnick played three 
complete games as a left fielder in September 2003; these would be his 
only on-field appearances as a defensive player for Milwaukee (outside 
of his role as pitcher) during 2003-04. During his second season with Milwaukee 
(2004), Kieschnick opened the season as a pitcher/pinch-hitter, but due 
to an injury was used exclusively as a pinch hitter for a two-month period 
from July 3-September 3, spending part of that time on the disabled list. 
Kieschnick did not appear as an outfielder or as a designated hitter during 
2004. Though Kieschnick's pitching effectiveness improved over his 2003 
season, his hitting tailed off, as he hit only 1 home run all year (compared 
to 7 in 2003). In a total of 306 career at-bats, Kieschnick's batting average 
was .248. In his two seasons of pitching at the major league level, his 
ERA was 4.59. Kieschnick was released by Milwaukee near the end of spring 
training, 2005. He subsequently spent the 2005 season in the Houston Astros 
minor league system, hitting .327 but also compiling a pitching record 
of 2-4 with an ERA of 5.12. On February 15, 2006, Kieschnick announced 
his retirement from baseball.[18] In 2002, in an online poll conducted 
in Austin, Kieschnick was voted the best baseball player in the history 
of the University of Texas.[19] He became one of ten inaugural members 
of the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006[7] and on March 29, 2009, 
Kieschnick had his number 23 retired by the University of Texas.[1] In 
the fall of 2014, Kieschnick opened Alamo Icehouse in San Antonio, Texas
