As player As manager Harold Joseph "Pie" Traynor (November 11, 1898 – March 
16, 1972) was an American professional baseball player, manager, scout 
and radio broadcaster.[1] He played his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) 
career (1920–37) as a third baseman with the Pittsburgh Pirates.[1] He 
was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1948.[2] Following the Second 
World War, Traynor was often cited as the greatest third baseman in MLB 
history. In recent years his reputation has diminished, with the modern-era 
careers of third basemen such as Eddie Mathews, Brooks Robinson, Mike Schmidt 
and George Brett moving to the forefront in the memories of baseball fans.[3][4][5] 
Traynor was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, to parents who had emigrated 
from Canada.[6] He received his nickname as a child in Somerville, Massachusetts, 
because he frequented a grocery store and often asked for pie. The store 
owner called him "Pie Face", which was later shortened to Pie by his friends.[3] 
Traynor began his professional baseball career in 1920 as a shortstop for 
the Portsmouth Truckers of the Virginia League.[7] He was asked by a Boston 
Braves scout to work out with the team at Braves Field, but the scout forgot 
to tell Braves manager George Stallings.[8] Stallings ran Traynor off the 
field, telling him not to return.[8] Traynor made his major league debut 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates at the age of 21 on September 15, 1920, appearing 
in 17 games that season.[1] He appeared in 10 games for the Pirates in 
1921, but spent the majority of the season playing for the Birmingham Barons.[7] 
He posted a .336 batting average in 131 games for the Barons, but he committed 
64 errors as a shortstop.[6][7] Traynor became the Pirates' regular third 
baseman in 1922, hitting for a .282 batting average with 81 runs batted 
in.[1] Following the advice of Rogers Hornsby, he began using a heavier 
bat in 1923 and blossomed into one of the best hitters in the National 
League (NL) . He hit above .300 for the first time with a .338 batting 
average along with 12 home runs and 101 runs batted in.[1][6] With tutoring 
provided by teammate Rabbit Maranville, his defense also began to improve, 
leading National League third basemen in putouts and assists.[6][9] In 
1925, Traynor posted a .320 average with six home runs, 106 runs batted 
in and led the league in fielding percentage as the Pirates won the NL 
pennant by 8 1⁄2 games over the New York Giants.[1][10] In the 1925 World 
Series, he hit .347 including a home run off future Hall of Fame pitcher 
Walter Johnson as the Pirates defeated the Washington Senators in a seven-game 
series.[11][12] Traynor ended the season eighth in Most Valuable Player 
(MVP) Award balloting.[13] His 41 double plays in 1925 set an NL record 
for third basemen that stood for 25 years.[6] The Pirates won the pennant 
again in 1927 with Traynor hitting .342 with five home runs and 106 runs 
batted in, but they lost to the New York Yankees in the 1927 World Series.[1][14] 
In November of that year, members of the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America selected him as the third baseman for the 1927 all-star major 
league team.[15] Traynor hit .337 and produced a career-high 124 runs batted 
in during the 1928 season despite hitting only three home runs and finished 
in sixth place in the NL MVP Award balloting.[1] He continued to be a cornerstone 
for the Pirates, posting a .356 batting average in 1929.[1] Traynor hit 
for a career-high .366 average in 1930.[1] A different baseball was used 
in MLB in 1931, and Traynor's batting average decreased to .298. Despite 
the decline in his average, Traynor supported the use of the new ball, 
saying that the 1930 ball had caused too large of an advantage for hitters 
and had led to lopsided games that had ultimately decreased interest in 
the sport.[16] In 1933 MLB held its inaugural All-Star Game and, Traynor 
was selected as a reserve player for the NL team.[17][18] Traynor's last 
full season was in 1934 when he hit over .300 for the ninth time in ten 
seasons, and was named as the starting third baseman for the NL in the 
1934 All-Star Game.[1][19] During the 1934 season, his throwing arm was 
injured in a play at home plate and his defense began to suffer as a result.[6] 
Traynor played his final game on August 14, 1937.[1] In a 17-year major 
league career, Traynor played in 1,941 games, accumulating 2,416 hits in 
7,559 at bats for a .320 career batting average along with 58 home runs, 
1,273 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .362.[1] He retired with 
a .946 fielding percentage.[1] Traynor was not a home run hitter – he reached 
a high of 12 in 1923 – but had high numbers of doubles and triples, hitting 
371 doubles and 164 triples lifetime and leading the league in triples 
in 1923, with 19.[1] He hit over .300 ten times and had over 100 runs batted 
in (RBI) in a season seven times.[1] Among major league third basemen, 
his seven seasons with more than 100 runs batted in is second only to the 
nine seasons by Mike Schmidt.[20] Chipper Jones is the only other third 
baseman in history to match Traynor's five consecutive seasons with more 
than 100 runs batted in.[6] He had 208 hits in 1923, and was the last Pirate 
infielder with 200 or more hits until shortstop Jack Wilson, who had 201 
hits in 2004. He struck out only 278 times in his career.[1] Traynor was 
considered the best fielding third baseman of his era, leading the National 
League in fielding percentage once, assists and double plays three times 
and putouts seven times.[21] His 2,289 putouts ranks him fifth all-time 
among third basemen.[22] His 1,863 games played at third base was a major 
league record that stood until 1960 when it was surpassed by Eddie Yost.[23] 
Traynor is the only MLB player to steal home plate in an All-Star Game.[6] 
Traynor finished in the top ten in voting for the NL's MVP Award six times 
during his career.[1] Traynor became the Pirates' player-manager during 
the 1934 season.[24] He retired as an active player after the 1937 season, 
but continued as the Pirates' manager.[25] He almost won another pennant 
as a manager in 1938, as the Pirates led the NL for most of the season 
before faltering to the Chicago Cubs in the famous "Homer in the Gloamin'" 
game at Wrigley Field.[26] The loss of the pennant devastated Traynor.[6] 
He seemed to lose confidence in his team, and after a sixth-place finish 
in 1939, he resigned after five seasons as the manager of the Pirates.[6] 
After spending time as a scout for the Pirates, Traynor eventually took 
a job as a sports director for a Pittsburgh radio station in 1944.[6] His 
radio broadcasts became popular with Pittsburgh sports fans and he remained 
at the job for 21 years.[6] Traynor retired from broadcasting in 1965. 
In 1948, Traynor was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, being the first 
third baseman to be chosen by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[2] 
In 1969, as part of the observance of the centennial of professional baseball, 
Traynor was named the third baseman on MLB's all-time team.[6] In 1971, 
he threw out the first pitch of Game 3 of the 1971 World Series at Three 
Rivers Stadium.[6] He died in 1972 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, not long 
after the Pirates moved into Three Rivers Stadium and retired his uniform 
number 20.[27][28] Traynor was buried in Homewood Cemetery in Pittsburgh. 
In 1999, he ranked number 70 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team.[29][30] Baseball historian Bill James ranked 
Traynor 15th all-time among third baseman in his Historical Baseball Abstract.[4]
