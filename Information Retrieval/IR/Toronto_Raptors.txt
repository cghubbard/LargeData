The Toronto Raptors are a Canadian professional basketball team based in 
Toronto, Ontario. The Raptors compete in the National Basketball Association 
(NBA), as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. 
The team was established in 1995, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, as 
part of the NBA's expansion into Canada. When the Grizzlies relocated to 
Memphis, Tennessee to become the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, the Raptors 
became the only Canadian-based team in the NBA. They originally played 
their home games at the SkyDome (since renamed Rogers Centre in 2005), 
before moving eastward along Bremner Boulevard to the Air Canada Centre 
in 1999. Like most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early 
years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft day trade 
in 1998, the team set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs 
in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to 
a then-franchise high 47 wins and their first playoff series win in 2001, 
where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the 2002–03 
and 2003–04 seasons, they failed to make significant progress and he was 
traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets. After Carter left, Chris Bosh emerged 
as the team leader. In 2006–07, Bryan Colangelo's first full season as 
President and General Manager, a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall 
NBA draft pick Andrea Bargnani and a revamp of the roster helped the Raptors 
qualify for their first playoff berth in five years, capturing the Atlantic 
Division title with 47 wins. In the 2007–08 season, they advanced to the 
playoffs again, but failed to make the playoffs in each of the next five 
seasons. In a bid to persuade Bosh to stay, Colangelo overhauled the team 
roster for the 2009–10 season, but Bosh signed with the Miami Heat in July 
2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors. After 
Masai Ujiri was brought in as the new General Manager in 2013, he traded 
Bargnani to the New York Knicks. With a backcourt led by Kyle Lowry and 
DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors returned to the playoffs, won their second Atlantic 
Division title, and won a then-franchise record 48 games in the 2013–14 
season. However, they failed for a fourth consecutive time to advance beyond 
the first round of the playoffs. In the 2014–15 season, they won a then-franchise 
record 49 games, but failed for a second consecutive year to advance past 
the first round of the playoffs, getting swept by the Washington Wizards, 
4–0. In the 2015–16 season, they won a franchise record 56 games, finishing 
in second place in the conference for the first time in franchise history. 
In the playoffs, they won their first playoff series since 2001 by defeating 
both the Indiana Pacers and Miami Heat, advancing to the Conference Finals 
for the first time against the Cleveland Cavaliers, only for the Raptors 
to lose to the eventual NBA champions in six games. The Toronto Raptors 
were established on November 4, 1993, when the NBA, as part of its expansion 
into Canada, awarded its 28th franchise to a group headed by Toronto businessman 
John Bitove for a then-record expansion fee of C$125 million US.[1] Bitove 
and Allan Slaight of Slaight Communications each owned 44%, with the Bank 
of Nova Scotia (10%), David Peterson (1%), and Phil Granovsky (1%) being 
minority partners.[1][4] Wagering on NBA games in Ontario nearly cost Toronto 
the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited 
gambling. However, an agreement was reached whereby the provincial lottery 
corporation agreed to stop offering wagering on all NBA games in exchange 
for a donation by the Raptors of $5 million in its first three years and 
$1 million annually afterwards to its charitable foundation to compensate 
the provincial lottery corporation for its loss of revenue.[5][6][7] The 
Raptors, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, played their first game in 
1995, and were the first NBA teams based in Canada since the 1946–47 Toronto 
Huskies,[1] though the Buffalo Braves had played a total of 16 regular 
season games at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto from 1971 to 1975.[8] Initial 
sentiment was in favour of reviving the Huskies nickname, but team management 
realized it would be nearly impossible to design a logo that did not substantially 
resemble that of the Minnesota Timberwolves.[9] As a result, a nationwide 
contest was held to help name the team and develop their colours and logo. 
Over 2,000 entries were narrowed down to ten prospects: Beavers, Bobcats, 
Dragons, Grizzlies, Hogs, Raptors, Scorpions, T-Rex, Tarantulas, and Terriers.[1] 
The final selection—Toronto Raptors—was unveiled on Canadian national television 
on May 15, 1994:[1] the choice was influenced by the popularity of the 
1993 film adaption of the 1990 science fiction novel Jurassic Park by Michael 
Crichton. The name "Raptor" is a common informal name for the velociraptor, 
a swift medium-sized dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur. On May 24, 1994, 
the team's logo and first General Manager, Isiah Thomas were revealed at 
a press conference.[1] As part of the deal, Thomas received an option to 
purchase part of the team, reportedly for under market value.[10][11] He 
would purchase 4.5% in May 1995[12][13] and a further 4.5% in December 
1995,[11][14] half each from Bitove and Slaight, decreasing their share 
to 39.5%.[1][15] The team's colours of bright red, purple, black, and silver 
were also revealed; "Naismith" silver was chosen as an ode to Canadian 
James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.[1] The team originally competed 
in the Central Division,[16] and before the inaugural season began, sales 
of Raptors merchandise ranked seventh in the league, marking a successful 
return of professional basketball to Canada.[1] As General Manager, Isiah 
Thomas quickly staffed the management positions with his own personnel, 
naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' 
head coach.[1] The team's roster was then filled as a result of an expansion 
draft in 1995. Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and 
selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong. 
Armstrong refused to report for training and Thomas promptly traded him 
to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor 
Alexander.[1] Thomas then selected a wide range of players in the expansion 
draft, including veterans Jerome Kersey, Willie Anderson and his former 
Pistons teammate John Salley.[1] Subsequent to the expansion draft, the 
Raptors landed the seventh pick in the NBA draft lottery, behind their 
fellow 1995 expansion club, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Thomas selected Damon 
Stoudamire, a point guard out of Arizona, around whom the franchise would 
seek to construct its near future. Yet, the selection of Stoudamire was 
met with boos from fans at the 1995 NBA draft at SkyDome in Toronto, many 
of whom wanted Ed O'Bannon of UCLA, an NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player.[1] 
In the team's first official NBA game, Alvin Robertson scored the first 
NBA points in Raptors history,[17] while Stoudamire recorded 10 points 
and 10 assists in a 94–79 victory over the New Jersey Nets.[18] The Raptors 
concluded their inaugural season with a 21–61 win–loss record,[16] although 
they were one of the few teams to defeat the Chicago Bulls,[19] who set 
a then all-time NBA best 72–10 win–loss regular season record. With averages 
of 19.0 points and 9.3 assists per game, Stoudamire also won the 1995–96 
Rookie of the Year Award.[20] In November of the 1996–97 season, Bitove 
sold his ownership interest in the team to Slaight for $65 million after 
Slaight had activated a shotgun clause in their partnership agreement,[21][22][23] 
giving Slaight 79% control of the team,[24] and remaining minority partner 
of the Bank of Nova Scotia (10%), Thomas (9%) Peterson (1%) and Granovsky 
(1%).[25] Slaight subsequently acquired the 1% which had been owned by 
both Peterson and Granovsky, who had died a year earlier.[4][26][27] The 
team improved on its win record by nine games.[28] They selected centre 
Marcus Camby with the second overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft.[29] By 
the end of the season, Camby earned a berth on the NBA's All-Rookie Team 
while Stoudamire continued to play well, averaging 20.2 points and 8.8 
assists per game.[1] As in the previous season, the Raptors were one of 
only 11 teams to topple the eventual 1997 Champions, the Chicago Bulls.[29][30] 
The Raptors also defeated the Houston Rockets, Utah Jazz and Miami Heat, 
all of which were eventual Conference finalists.[29][31] However, the Raptors 
struggled against teams who were not of championship calibre, including 
three losses to the 15–67 Boston Celtics.[31] In the 1997–98 season, the 
team suffered numerous injuries and slid into a 17-game losing streak.[32] 
After Thomas' attempts to execute a letter of intent with Slaight to purchase 
the team failed, he resigned his position with the team in November and 
sold his 9% stake in the team to Slaight.[26][33][34] This left Slaight 
with 90% and the Bank of Nova Scotia with 10%.[33] Thomas was replaced 
by Glen Grunwald as GM.[35] With Thomas gone, Stoudamire immediately sought 
a trade.[36] On February 13, 1998, he was shipped to the Portland Trail 
Blazers along with Walt Williams and Carlos Rogers for Kenny Anderson, 
Alvin Williams, Gary Trent, two first-round draft choices, a second-round 
draft choice and cash.[32] Anderson refused to report to Toronto and was 
traded to the Celtics with Žan Tabak and Popeye Jones for Chauncey Billups, 
Dee Brown, Roy Rogers and John Thomas.[32] When the trading deadline was 
over, the Raptors became the youngest team in the league with an average 
age of 24.6.[32] They had five rookies on their roster, including the 18-year-old 
Tracy McGrady, who at the time was the youngest player in the NBA.[32] 
The inexperienced Raptors struggled throughout the season and their regular 
season record regressed to 16–66.[37] On February 12, 1998, Maple Leaf 
Gardens Ltd., the owners of the Toronto Maple Leafs, purchased 100% of 
the Raptors and the arena the team was building, Air Canada Centre, from 
Slaight and the Bank of Nova Scotia.[34][38] MLSE paid a reported $467 
million, made up of $179 million for the team and $288 million for the 
arena.[39][40][41] During the 1998 NBA draft, in what became a defining 
move for the franchise, Grunwald traded the team's 4th overall pick Antawn 
Jamison to the Golden State Warriors for Vince Carter, who was selected 
5th overall.[42] To bring further credibility to the Raptors, Grunwald 
traded Marcus Camby to the New York Knicks for Charles Oakley,[43] a veteran 
with playoff experience. Kevin Willis, another veteran acquired from the 
trade, solidified the centre position, while the coaching staff temporarily 
rotated Brown, Williams and Doug Christie to play point guard. Both Christie 
and Williams became talented players in their own right; Christie developed 
into one of the elite defenders in the NBA,[43] while Williams improved 
his play on the offensive end. New coach Butch Carter was also credited 
with much of the team's turnaround during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 
season. Although the team did not make the playoffs, many were optimistic 
with the impressive performances of Rookie of the Year Carter[42] and a 
much improved McGrady. During the 1999 NBA draft, believing that the Raptors 
still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round 
draft pick Jonathan Bender for power forward Antonio Davis of the Indiana 
Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors starting lineup and he would 
develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would 
only play nine seasons and would be out of the league by age 29.[44] In 
the backcourt, Carter, Christie and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard 
position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation 
of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's 
improvement helped the team make its first ever playoff appearance, fulfilling 
a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season.[45] Lacking significant 
post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks 
in the first round.[45] Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of 
Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest[42]—attracted 
many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. 
The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, 
after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better 
suited to baseball and Canadian football.[45] Overall, the Raptors concluded 
the season with a 45–37 record.[46] Still, playoff failures and Butch Carter's 
media altercations surrounding Camby led Grunwald to replace Carter prior 
to the 2000–01 season with Lenny Wilkens, a Hall of Fame coach and player 
with more than 30 years of coaching experience.[47] The team roster was 
also largely revamped, including the signing of veteran playmaker Mark 
Jackson on a four-year contract.[48] When Alvin Williams later emerged 
as a clutch performer,[49] Jackson was traded to allow Williams more playing 
time.[48] In the 2000 off-season, free agent McGrady opted to leave the 
Raptors in a sign-and-trade deal worth $67.5 million over six years, while 
giving a conditional draft pick as part of the agreement to the Orlando 
Magic, for a first-round draft pick.[50] As predicted by analysts, the 
team easily secured a berth in the 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise high 
47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated 
New York 3–2, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals for the first 
time in franchise history.[48][51] Wilkens was praised for having Williams 
defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell 
Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 
76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment 
value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their 
respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from 
Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams 
and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome 
Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 
7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim.[52] 
Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony 
at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored 
only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting, after a 39-point performance in Game 
6.[53][54] Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark 
for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing 
beyond the first round of the playoffs.[48][55] The relocation of the Vancouver 
Grizzlies to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001, as the Memphis Grizzlies, left 
Toronto as the NBA's only Canadian team.[56] In the summer of 2001, long-term 
contracts were given to Alvin Williams, Jerome Williams and Davis, while 
former NBA MVP centre Hakeem Olajuwon was signed to provide Carter with 
good support.[57] The Raptors appeared to be on their way to another competitive 
season, with a 29–21 record going into the All-Star break[57] and with 
Carter the top vote-getter for the All-Star game for the third consecutive 
year.[42] Carter then suffered a bout of patellar tendinitis (also known 
as "jumper's knee")[58] forcing him to miss the All-Star game and the rest 
of the season,[57] and without their franchise player, Toronto lost 13 
consecutive games.[57] However, they were able to win 12 of their last 
14 games, clinching a playoff spot on the last day of the regular season.[57] 
The comeback featured some of the Raptors' best defence of the season, 
along with inspired performances by Davis and Keon Clark. Despite Toronto's 
improved defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely missed in 
the first-round series against the second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the 
first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace's 
strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals.[59] 
Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to 
force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit.[57] With 10.7 
seconds left in the game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of 
the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed 
badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play,[60] instead of passing 
to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly 
insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' 
late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the 
Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career 
lows in minutes, points and rebounds.[61] Furthermore, Childs, Clark, and 
Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season. The 
2002–03 season began with the same optimism that the Raptors exhibited 
in three consecutive playoff seasons, although it faded early. Carter, 
while voted as a starter in the 2003 All-Star Game,[42] suffered a knee 
injury, while Davis expressed disinterest in Toronto, and Wilkens' laissez-faire 
attitude created a team that lacked the motivation and spirit of the previous 
years' teams. The team was ravaged with injuries, losing an NBA record 
number of player games due to injury.[62] Furthermore, the Raptors recorded 
the dubious honour of being the only team in NBA history to not dress 12 
players for a single game in a season.[62] Wilkens was criticized heavily 
by the Toronto media for his inability to clamp down on his players when 
necessary, especially given this was the year that Wilkens overtook Bill 
Fitch for the most losses by an NBA coach,[63] with his loss total getting 
dangerously close to his win total. The Raptors ended the season with a 
24–58 record[64] and Wilkens was fired. This turned out to be a blessing 
in disguise, when the Raptors were given the 4th overall pick in the 2003 
NBA draft and brought another star to Toronto in Chris Bosh. Canadian country 
singer Shania Twain helped launch the new red Raptors alternate road uniform 
at the start of the 2003–04 season,[65] and the jerseys made their debut 
in a 90–87 season-opening victory on October 29, 2003 against the defending 
Conference Champion New Jersey Nets.[65] Davis and Jerome Williams were 
traded early in the season for Jalen Rose and Donyell Marshall. After 50 
games, Toronto was 25–25 and in a position to make the playoffs, but injuries 
to key players sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings. Rose, Carter, 
and Alvin Williams all suffered injuries as the Raptors struggled to a 
record of 8–24 in their remaining games.[65] The notable individual season 
performances were Carter's 22.5 ppg, Marshall's 10.7 rpg and rookie Bosh, 
a 6–10 forward-centre who averaged 11.5 ppg and 7.4 rpg and was named to 
the NBA All-Rookie Team.[66] Williams' knee injury turned out to be career-ending. 
For the 2004–05 season, the team moved into the Atlantic Division and the 
Raptors decided to revamp the team. Raptors President and CEO of Maple 
Leaf Sports & Entertainment Richard Peddie fired Grunwald on April 1, 2004, 
after the team ended the season three games short of the eighth and final 
playoff spot in the previous season.[65] Head coach Kevin O'Neill and his 
four assistant coaches were also dismissed immediately after Grunwald's 
termination. Toronto interim manager Jack McCloskey said: "While the blame 
for that certainly does not rest on O'Neill and his staff alone, we need 
a change."[67] Rob Babcock was named General Manager on June 7, 2004, alongside 
the appointments of Wayne Embry as senior advisor and Alex English as director 
of player development.[68] Sam Mitchell, a former NBA forward and assistant 
coach of the Milwaukee Bucks was hired as new head coach of the Raptors.[69] 
Babcock's first move as GM was drafting centre Rafael Araújo—selected eighth 
overall—in the 2004 NBA draft, in a move that was criticized by fans and 
analysts, considering highly touted swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted 
with the next pick.[70] Babcock signed point guard Rafer Alston to a five-year 
deal. After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed 
to the media that Carter's agent had asked for a trade confirming Carter 
was discontent. The Toronto Sun reported that Carter felt he was being 
misled by the Raptors' hierarchy during the General Manager search and 
had concluded that as long as the managerial structure at Maple Leaf Sports 
and Entertainment Ltd. remained intact, the Raptors would never be an elite 
team.[71] Carter was finally traded mid-season, ending his six-year tenure. 
Toronto received Alonzo Mourning, forwards Eric Williams and Aaron Williams 
and two mid-to-late future first round picks from the New Jersey Nets. 
Mourning chose not to report to Toronto, forcing Babcock to buy out the 
remainder of his contract[72] at a reported $10 million, leaving him free 
to sign with the Miami Heat. Eric and Aaron Williams were supposed to add 
defensive toughness and rebounding, but were generally under-utilized for 
the entire season. Analysts had predicted Babcock got the bad end of the 
deal,[73] and the trade eventually cost him his job. Carter's departure 
heralded a new era for Toronto. Bosh stepped up to the role of franchise 
player[74] and performed well in his sophomore campaign, ranking tenth 
in the league in defensive rebounds.[66] In contrast to Bosh's emergence, 
Araújo struggled to keep a spot in the line-up, and became unpopular with 
fans and local media.[75] Although the ACC was often well-attended due 
to the Raptors' 22–19 home record,[76] their inability to win on the road 
(11–30) and poor defensive record made Mitchell's first year as head coach 
unimpressive. Additionally, Mitchell had problems dealing with Alston, 
who openly expressed his unhappiness with Mitchell in a post-game interview.[77] 
Later in the season, Alston was suspended two games for "conduct detrimental 
to the team" for reportedly walking out of a scrimmage during practice.[78] 
Notwithstanding the unrest, in their first season competing in the Atlantic 
Division, Toronto maintained the same regular season record of 33–49 as 
the previous season.[74] The Raptors continued to rebuild during the 2005 
NBA draft, selecting Charlie Villanueva, Joey Graham, Roko Ukić and Uroš 
Slokar, with Villanueva's selection being very controversial amongst basketball 
pundits and Raptors fans alike.[79] The Raptors started their training 
camp by trading Alston to the Houston Rockets for Mike James, and signing 
free agent José Calderón as a back-up for James. Despite the infusion of 
new players, Toronto's overall 2005–06 season was a disappointment; they 
set a franchise record by losing their first nine games[80] and 15 out 
of their first 16 games.[81] With losses mounting and media scrutiny intensifying, 
the Raptors hired ex-Purdue coach Gene Keady as an assistant off the bench 
to help develop the young Raptors team, as well as establish a defensive 
persona for the team. On January 15, 2006, the Raptors set a franchise 
points record in a 129–103 win over the Knicks when Villanueva hit a three-pointer 
late in the game,[82] but less than a week later, the Raptors gave up an 
18-point lead against the Los Angeles Lakers, and allowed Lakers star Kobe 
Bryant to score 81 points, the second highest single-game total in NBA 
history.[83] With media scrutiny intensifying once more and the Raptors 
entrenched at the bottom of the league in defensive field goal percentage,[84] 
Toronto fired Babcock.[85] The 2005–06 season was not a total disaster. 
Villanueva's play impressed both fans and former critics as he came in 
second in NBA Rookie of the Year[86] and recorded 48 points in an overtime 
loss to Milwaukee Bucks, the most points scored by any rookie in franchise 
history and the most by a rookie in the NBA since 1997.[87] Bosh was also 
named a reserve forward for the Eastern All-Star Team in the 2006 game,[66] 
becoming the third Raptor after Vince Carter and Antonio Davis to appear 
in an All-Star Game. On February 27, 2006, the team named Bryan Colangelo, 
the 2004–05 NBA Executive of the Year, the President and General Manager 
of the Raptors.[88] Known for his success in transforming a lottery Phoenix 
team into a 62-win offensive juggernaut, his hiring gave hope to many fans. 
Still, Toronto ended the season weakly when Bosh suffered a season-ending 
thumb injury.[89] The Raptors lost ten in a row after Bosh's injury[90] 
and finished the season with the fifth worst record (27–55) in the NBA.[91] 
The 2006–07 season represented a watershed year for the Raptors franchise. 
The roster was overhauled, including the selection of 2006 NBA draft number 
one pick Andrea Bargnani, the acquisition of point guard T. J. Ford in 
exchange for Villanueva, and the signing of shooting guard Anthony Parker 
and small forward Jorge Garbajosa.[92] Bosh was given a three-year contract 
extension,[92] while Maurizio Gherardini of Benetton Treviso was hired 
as the club's vice-president and assistant general manager.[93] The first 
half of the season produced mixed results as Toronto struggled towards 
the .500 mark.[94] After the All-Star break, Bargnani continued to work 
on his defence and shooting (averaging 14.3 points per game (ppg) and 3.9 
rebounds per game (rpg) in 12 games for the month of February 2007), and 
he was selected as the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for the second 
straight time on March 1, 2007.[95] Bargnani became the third Raptor ever 
to win the award twice, joining Vince Carter and Damon Stoudamire.[95] 
Toronto ended the regular season with a 47–35 record, securing the third 
seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2007 NBA Playoffs along with the 
Atlantic Division title, as well as homecourt advantage for the first time 
in franchise history.[96][97] Bosh was voted to start in the 2007 NBA All-Star 
Game.[98] The Raptors were also praised for their improved defence, ball-sharing 
and tremendous team chemistry.[99] Colangelo, Gherardini and Mitchell were 
credited with Toronto's turnaround this season,[100] which was one of the 
best in NBA history in terms of league standing and defensive ranking.[101] 
Mitchell was subsequently named the 2006–07 NBA Coach of the Year, the 
first coach in Raptors history to receive the honour,[102] while Colangelo 
was named 2006–07 Executive of the Year.[103] On April 24, 2007, the Raptors 
won their first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 victory over 
the New Jersey Nets,[104] but lost the series 4–2.[105] The series was 
notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. The 
Nets took home court advantage in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally 
in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to 
even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, 
the Nets took charge of the series, winning games 3 and 4 in routs. New 
Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors 
took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey managed to chip 
away, and had a chance to win the game, but Boštjan Nachbar's three-pointer 
missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto 
held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard 
Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted 
to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal 
the series for the Nets. Several changes to the roster were made before 
the 2007–08 campaign as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the 
previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in 
a trade with Detroit for two second round draft picks,[106] and signed 
Jamario Moon[107] and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free agents.[108] 
On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans 
Hornets.[109] Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were 
widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles.[110] 
However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's 
inability to play well consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 
games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed the possibility of 
a smooth campaign as the Raptors finished 41-41, six fewer wins than the 
previous season, but still good enough for a playoff spot as the 6th seed. 
They were pitted against Dwight Howard and the resurgent Orlando Magic. 
In Game 1, Dwight Howard gave the Magic their first playoff win since 2003 
as they practically led the entire game.[111] Howard would put up a 29–20 
in Game 2, as Hedo Türkoğlu scored the final four go-ahead points to give 
the Magic a 2–0 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory 
keyed by great point guard play from Ford and José Calderon. However, Jameer 
Nelson, Rashard Lewis and Keith Bogans keyed strong three point shooting 
in Game 4 and overcame Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic 
out of Toronto with a 3–1 lead. Howard would finish off the series in Game 
5 as impressively as he started–21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks.[112][113] 
Whereas the preceding season was considered a success, the 2007–08 campaign 
was considered a disappointment. Weaknesses in Toronto's game—rebounding, 
defence, and a lack of a swingman—were brought into sharp focus during 
the playoffs, and changes were expected to be made to the roster.[113] 
As it turned out, a blockbuster trade was agreed in principle before the 
2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the 
Indiana Pacers in exchange for Ford (who had become expendable with the 
emergence of Calderón), Rasho Nesterović, Maceo Baston, and Roy Hibbert, 
the 17th pick in the 2008 NBA draft, giving the Raptors a potential boost 
in the frontcourt.[114] Meanwhile, Bargnani, who had spent the summer working 
on his interior game, was projected to come off the bench. The Raptors 
also introduced a black alternate road jersey for the season similar to 
the earlier purple design that was dropped a few seasons ago. It had a 
maple leaf featured on the back neck of the jersey, symbolizing the Raptors 
as "Canada's team".[115] Despite the introduction of O'Neal, who brought 
home the rebounds and the blocks, and a much improved Bargnani, the Raptors 
were too inconsistent. Following an 8–9 start to the season, Mitchell was 
fired and replaced by long-time assistant Jay Triano.[116] Triano tweaked 
with the starting line-up to no avail as the Raptors fell to 21–34 prior 
to the All-Star break. O'Neal and Moon were then traded to Miami for Shawn 
Marion and Marcus Banks,[117] but with the losses mounting, the Raptors 
soon fell out of the playoffs picture, and were eliminated from contention 
with seven games of the regular season remaining.[118] The Raptors eventually 
finished with a 33–49 record[119] and headed into the next season with 
a potential overhaul of the core: Marion could become a free agent; Bosh 
could become one after 2009–10; Parker would soon turn 35; and Bargnani 
had his breakthrough season. On May 12, 2009, Triano was given a three-year 
term for the position of head coach.[120] The inevitable roster shakeup 
for the 2009–10 season began when Kapono was traded to the Philadelphia 
76ers for the aggressive veteran forward Reggie Evans.[121] Toronto then 
drafted DeMar DeRozan with the ninth pick, enabling them to fill a spot 
on the wings.[122] This was followed by the signing of free agent Hedo 
Türkoğlu, which in turn led to a sign-and-trade agreement involving four 
teams, with Toronto landing wing players Devean George (later traded for 
Marco Belinelli) and Antoine Wright, while releasing Marion, Kris Humphries 
and Nathan Jawai.[123] Around the same time, Parker headed for the Cleveland 
Cavaliers,[124] while Indiana point guard Jarrett Jack was added and Nesterovič 
brought back to provide cover for the big men. Finally, Delfino and Ukić 
were moved to the Milwaukee Bucks for Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems.[125] 
It became increasingly clear that Colangelo, in securing a credible nucleus 
for the future, was doing this to persuade Bosh to stay beyond 2010.[126] 
While the Raptors were off to a sluggish start, they picked up the pace 
around the All-Star break, reaching a season-high seven games above .500 
and standing fifth in the Eastern Conference.[127] Bosh was recording career-highs 
in ppg and rpg.[66] However, a season-ending injury to Bosh after the break 
coincided with Toronto's descent down the standings from the fifth seed 
to the eighth, and they ultimately relinquished their spot to Chicago a 
few games before the regular season ended.[128] Before the 2010–11 season 
began, there was much anticipation around the league over the fates of 
an elite pack of free agents, featuring the likes of Bosh, Dwyane Wade, 
LeBron James, and Amar'e Stoudemire. Bosh and James eventually chose to 
converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign-and-trade transaction that ensued 
resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade 
exception from Miami.[129] Prior to this, Toronto had drafted Ed Davis, 
also a left-handed power forward like Bosh. After Bosh left, Colangelo 
sought to trade Calderón, Evans and the disenchanted Türkoğlu for Tyson 
Chandler, Leandro Barbosa, and Boris Diaw,[130] but the trade involving 
Chandler collapsed at the last minute, as Chandler was traded to the Dallas 
Mavericks instead.[131] Belinelli was then traded to New Orleans Hornets 
for Julian Wright,[132] and 13 games into the season, Jack, David Andersen, 
and Marcus Banks to New Orleans for Peja Stojaković and Jerryd Bayless.[133] 
Bosh's first return to Toronto was received to a chorus of boos, but not 
as nearly as harsh as what former Raptors Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter 
received upon their respective returns.[134] Without Bosh, Toronto as a 
team regressed and were only able to secure 22 wins in the regular season. 
Dwane Casey, an assistant coach with the Mavericks, was hired as the new 
head coach of Toronto before the 2011–12 season.[135] The Raptors used 
their number five pick to select Jonas Valančiūnas, a centre from Lithuania 
in the 2011 NBA draft. The season was shortened by 16 regular season games 
due to the 2011 NBA lockout, and the Raptors finished the season with a 
23–43 record. During the 2012 off-season, Colangelo tried to lure Canadian 
free agent and two-time MVP Steve Nash, who had become a free agent after 
playing for the Phoenix Suns, to play for the Raptors. When Nash joined 
the Los Angeles Lakers instead, the Raptors acquired point guard Kyle Lowry 
from the Houston Rockets for a future first round pick. Lowry, combined 
with Valančiūnas and the 8th pick in the 2012 draft Terrence Ross, represented 
the next phase of the re-building process. On January 30, 2013, the Raptors 
acquired Memphis Grizzlies star Rudy Gay and centre Hamed Haddadi as well 
as Pistons player Austin Daye in a three-way deal that sent Calderón to 
the Detroit Pistons and Davis, along with Pistons veteran Tayshaun Prince 
and a 2nd round pick to the Grizzlies. Haddadi was later traded, along 
with a second round pick, to Phoenix in exchange for guard Sebastian Telfair. 
The 2012–13 season was the first season since 2009–10 that the Raptors 
finished the season with a winning home record (21–20), despite their overall 
losing record (34–48). During the 2013 off-season, new General Manager 
Masai Ujiri traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks for Marcus Camby, Steve 
Novak, Quentin Richardson, a future first round draft pick, and two future 
second round picks; Camby and Richardson were both waived shortly after 
the trade. The Raptors also added Tyler Hansbrough, D. J. Augustin, Dwight 
Buycks, and Austin Daye via free agency. On December 9, 2013, the Raptors 
traded Rudy Gay, Quincy Acy, and Aaron Gray to the Sacramento Kings for 
John Salmons, Greivis Vásquez, Patrick Patterson, and Chuck Hayes, and 
waived Augustin.[136] During the 2013–14 season, the Raptors were 6–12 
before the Rudy Gay trade; after the trade, they went on a 10–3 run as 
they maintained their lead in the division, and rose above the .500 mark 
for the first time in almost three years. The Raptors entered the All-Star 
break with a 28–24 record, and DeRozan was also selected to play in the 
All-Star game, being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so. On March 28, 
2014, the Raptors clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2008 
after beating the Boston Celtics 105–103.[137] On April 11, 2014, the Raptors 
lost to the New York Knicks 108–100, but since division rival Brooklyn 
lost to the Atlanta Hawks the same night, the Raptors became Atlantic Division 
champions for the first time since 2007.[138] They finished the regular 
season with a franchise-high 48 wins (.585), going 42–22 (.656) after the 
Rudy Gay trade, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors 
faced the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the playoffs for the first 
time since 2007, when the Nets where located in New Jersey. Toronto nearly 
advanced to the next round, but Paul Pierce blocked a potential game-winner 
by Lowry in Game 7.[139] During the 2014–15 season, the Raptors were off 
to their best start in franchise history: a then-Eastern Conference leading 
24–8 record by the end of 2014.[140] On March 27, 2015, the Raptors clinched 
the Atlantic division title with a 94–83 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. 
This was the second consecutive year that the Raptors clinched the Atlantic 
Division title.[141] On April 11, 2015, the Raptors beat the Miami Heat, 
Toronto's first road win over the Heat since November 19, 2008, ending 
a ten-game slide on Miami's home floor. The win was Toronto's 48th of the 
season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records.[142] Four days 
later, the Toronto Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th 
win of the season. After the 2014–15 season, Louis Williams won the NBA 
Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first ever Raptor to do so. The 
Raptors faced the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2015 playoffs, 
and lost four straight games as the Wizards swept the Raptors.[143] On 
June 25, 2015, the Raptors selected Delon Wright with their first round 
pick in the 2015 NBA draft, along with Norman Powell in the second round. 
On June 29, the Raptors announced their new NBA D-League team, the Mississauga-based 
Raptors 905, which began play in the 2015–2016 season.[144] The Raptors 
added DeMarre Carroll, Cory Joseph, Bismack Biyombo, and Luis Scola via 
free agency. The Raptors opened a new practice facility, the BioSteel Centre 
in Exhibition Place, on February 10, 2016. The Raptors hosted the 2016 
NBA All-Star Game on February 14, 2016 and its associated weekend for the 
first time in its history. With a 105–97 win at home against the Atlanta 
Hawks on March 30, 2016, the Raptors attained their first ever 50-win season.[145] 
The following day the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title for 
the third consecutive season as a result of a Boston Celtics loss against 
the Portland Trail Blazers.[146] The 56–26 record became the best Raptors 
regular season ever, fourth overall in the league and second only to the 
Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference. Entering the 2016 playoffs 
as the East's second seed,[147] the Raptors were pushed to seven games 
by the Indiana Pacers, but managed to win their first playoff series in 
15 years.[148] Another seven-game series against the Miami Heat ensued, 
which Toronto also won. The Raptors, who were one of the four teams that 
never reached the NBA Conference Finals in their histories, appeared in 
the third round for the first time in their twenty-first season, facing 
the Cleveland Cavaliers,[149] in which they ultimately lost the series 
4–2.[150] The Cavaliers would then advance to the NBA Finals and became 
champions. On December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary 
logo, which the team described as "a circular shield with a ball torn by 
the unmistakable attack of a Raptor".[2] The current Toronto Raptors logo 
(2015–present) Wordmark logo (2015–present) Occasionally, the Raptors would 
wear the Toronto Huskies throwback jersey during retro nights, given that 
the Huskies are the unofficial predecessor of the Raptors and the Raptors 
are among the newest NBA teams. On August 3, 2015, the Toronto Raptors 
unveiled four new uniforms. The uniforms were released in partnership with 
2K Sports' NBA 2K16 video game. The team said in a press release the new 
uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and 
to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club 
in the NBA. The main colours would remain centred on Canada's national 
colours of red and white, whereas black and silver will continue to be 
used for trim on the home white and red road uniform. The uniforms themselves 
underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point 
up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of "We The North". 
Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed 
downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey 
is an upside-down tag with the team's "We The North" slogan. The team said 
the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their 
jersey. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front 
of the waistband, and the letter "T" is now on the sides of the shorts, 
with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to 
the city of Toronto's "T-Dot" nickname.[151] Roster • Transactions Last 
transaction: 2016–10–22 The Raptors hold the draft rights to the following 
unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, 
either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed 
by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA team. 
In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until 
one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[152] This 
list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. 
General managers Owners Head coaches Since their inception in 1995, the 
Raptors have made the playoffs eight times (2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 
2014, 2015 and 2016), advancing past the first round twice (2001 and 2016). 
The Raptors have won the Atlantic Division four times (2007, 2014, 2015 
and 2016), and the franchise record number of wins in the regular season 
is 56 (2016). Five Raptors have been selected to play in the All-Star game: 
Vince Carter, Antonio Davis, Chris Bosh, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. 
Raptors games are primarily broadcast on television by TSN and Sportsnet. 
Through MLSE, the Raptors also operate the Canadian version of NBA TV (formerly 
known as Raptors NBA TV), which airs reruns of Raptors telecasts along 
with other news and analysis programs focusing on the team and the rest 
of the NBA.[160] Television Radio The Raptors have enjoyed a consistent 
fanbase throughout their history. The Toronto Raptors set NBA attendance 
records in their 2000, 2001, 2002 seasons when they made the playoffs. 
Attendance dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during 
the 2006–07 regular season to an average of 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 
92.2% of capacity at the ACC.[161] Following the success of the 2006–07 
season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales 
for the 2007–08 season.[162] Their television ratings, however, are considerably 
lower than other more established Toronto sports teams and most other sporting 
events shown on Canadian television.[160] Another successful run starting 
in 2013–14 led to a spike in the Raptors' support. For the 2014–15 season, 
the team sold out the 12,500 season tickets, the first time it occurred 
since 2011.[163] Public watchings of the Raptors games, particularly during 
the playoffs, started being held at Maple Leaf Square, which the fans nicknamed 
"Jurassic Park". MLSE decided to endorse this practice by setting up concession 
stands and branded sponsorships at the square, along with increased security. 
At times, footage from the square is broadcast to the Raptors locker room.[164][165] 
The victorious Game 7 against the Indiana Pacers on the 2016 playoffs was 
the most watched Raptors broadcast ever, as well as the biggest television 
audience in Canada that day, averaging 1.53 million viewers with a peak 
of 2.63 million.[166] The value of the Raptors franchise has risen over 
the years. In 1998, the franchise was bought for US$125 million. With the 
continued popularity of the Raptors, the value of the franchise doubled 
from US$148 million in 2000 to $297 million in 2004. The value of the franchise 
grew again from $315 million in 2006 to $373 million in 2007, and $400 million 
in 2008. By 2016, Forbes estimated the Raptors were worth $920 million.[167][168][169][170][171] 
On game day, the fans are usually entertained by the Raptor mascot, the 
Raptors Dance Pak, and the 4 Korners Raptors Soundcrew during pre-game, 
time-outs, and intervals. During the 2013–14 season, a new "Drake Zone" 
was created in the lower bowl. Limited edition shirts were given away to 
fans sitting in the Drake Zone. Giveaways are sometimes bundled with tickets 
to encourage attendance. Further, whenever Toronto scores more than 100 
points in a home game and wins, fans can redeem their ticket for a cheese 
or pepperoni pizza slice at standalone Pizza Pizza locations throughout 
Ontario for the business day after the game that was played. This is part 
of a promotion made by the Raptors' official pizza sponsor.[172] In the 
lead-up to the team's 20th anniversary season in 2015, and its hosting 
of the 2016 All-Star Game, the Raptors began the process of re-branding 
itself. On September 30, 2013, Toronto-based rapper Drake was announced 
as the new "global ambassador" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining 
the executive committee of his hometown's NBA team.[173] In April 2014, 
the Raptors unveiled a new imaging campaign developed by the agency Sid 
Lee, "We The North", built around a manifesto that was meant to embrace 
the team's trait of being an "outsider" from the "north side", and the 
accompanying feelings of players and fans.[174] The "We The North" campaign 
was originally to be launched during the 2015–16 season; however, the launch 
was hastened so it would be ready in time for the 2014 playoffs, taking 
into account the poor performance of Canada's other pro sports teams at 
the time. An introductory commercial was quickly filmed, which featured 
the manifesto as narration, scenes of local basketball players in various 
outdoor locations around the city, and ended with a scene displaying a 
black, waving flag with the motto written on it. The campaign was immediately 
embraced by fans during the playoffs and following season; the launch commercial 
was viewed over 500,000 times in the two days following its release, "We 
The North"-branded shirts and flags became a common sight at games, while 
Ryerson University sports marketing professor Cheri Bradish compared the 
campaign to Molson's former "I Am Canadian" alcohol advertising campaign 
in how it resonated with the country.[174][175] On December 19, 2014, the 
Raptors soft-launched a new logo also designed by Sid Lee, which features 
a basketball with claw marks. The new logo was officially implemented during 
the 2015–2016 season.[176] The logo's introduction was marred by a disorganized 
launch, which saw a black and white version initially shown before the 
eventual unveiling of colored versions later in the day, mixed reviews 
for the design itself, with some (especially on the black and white version) 
comparing it to that of the Brooklyn Nets, and despite teasing merchandise 
with the new logo, not releasing any until at least mid-2015.[177] There 
were also alleged tensions between MLSE staff and Drake surrounding the 
new design—in particular, the performer had pushed for the team to change 
its primary colour from red to gold (a colour seen in one of the official 
variants of the logo unveiled that day). In a response on Twitter, Drake 
distanced himself from the "execution" of the new logo.[178] The New Jersey/Brooklyn 
Nets and the Raptors have been minor rivals since the trade of Vince Carter 
to the Nets during the 2004–05 season. The rivalry began to heat up as 
the two teams faced each other in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, 
with the Nets winning the series 4–2 after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson 
with 8 seconds left in Game 6 ensuring 98–97 defeat for the Raptors.[179] 
The rivalry was rekindled during the 2013–14 season when the Nets and Raptors 
battled for the Atlantic Division. The Raptors won the division final but 
then they found themselves facing the Nets in the opening round of the 
2014 NBA Playoffs. Prior to Game 1 of the series, Raptors GM Masai Ujiri 
spoke at a Raptors rally outside Air Canada Centre's Maple Leaf Square. 
During the rally, Ujiri yelled "Fuck Brooklyn!" which found its way quickly 
onto social media platforms within minutes. Masai was fined $25,000 by 
the NBA for the quote and later apologized for the excessive language.[180] 
The hard fought series lasted seven games, and was decided in the final 
seconds when Paul Pierce blocked Kyle Lowry's shot giving the Nets the 
104–103 victory.[181][182] The New York Knicks and the Raptors had a playoff 
rivalry in 2000 and 2001. The Raptors made their first-ever playoff appearance 
during the 1999–2000 season, in which they were swept by the Knicks in 
the first round 3–0. The following season, the Raptors redeemed themselves, 
defeating the Knicks in the first round 3–2; this effectively ended the 
Knicks' run as perennial NBA championship contenders, which began in the 
early 1990s.[181][183] The Raptors Foundation was the charitable arm of 
the Raptors, dedicated to assisting Ontario's registered charities that 
support programs and sports initiatives for at-risk children and youth. 
The Foundation strove to lift spirits and change lives for young people 
by supporting local and provincial organizations that provide recreational, 
educational and other youth-oriented activities. Through its community 
ties and with the help of its corporate partners, donors, Raptors players 
and volunteers, the Foundation has successfully raised more than $14 million 
between 1995 and 2007, and reached out to thousands of other charities.[184] 
The Raptors Foundation was one of three parts of the Raptors' community 
service program. The other projects are Raptors Community Relations and 
Raptors Basketball Development, both of which focus on providing basketball 
development programs. The Toronto Raptors lead the NBA for amount of money 
donated to the community. In 2009, the Raptors Foundation merged with the 
other charitable arms of MLSE's other sports franchises to form the Team
