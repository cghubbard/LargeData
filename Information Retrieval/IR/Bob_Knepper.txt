Robert Wesley Knepper (born May 25, 1954) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He played as a pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1976 
to 1990 for the San Francisco Giants and Houston Astros, both of the National 
League. Knepper was a two-time All-Star and the 1981 NL Comeback Player 
of the Year. He generated controversy with his remarks about female umpire 
Pam Postema and the National Organization for Women in 1988. In the September 
1978 issue of SPORT Magazine, Jay Stuller wrote an extraordinarily positive 
article on Knepper, entitled, You Can't Compare Him To Koufax...Yet.[1][2] 
As Knepper's career never reached that standard, critics would often refer 
to that article and say, "You Can't Compare Him to Koufax...Ever." On December 
8, 1980, Knepper was traded from the Giants along with Chris Bourjos to 
the Astros for Enos Cabell.[3] He won The Sporting News Comeback Player 
of the Year Award in 1981.[4] He was voted to the National League All-Star 
team twice (1981 and 1988). He led the National League in shutouts in 1978, 
with six, and in 1986, with five. He also led the league in hit batsmen 
in 1980, with eight, and losses in 1987, with 17. By July 1989, Knepper 
was struggling with a 4-10 win-loss record and 5.89 ERA. The Astros released 
him after he refused a demotion to the minor leagues.[5] He was signed 
by the San Francisco Giants a few days later.[6] He pitched the rest of 
the regular season with San Francisco, but did not make their postseason 
roster.[7] The Giants waived Knepper in June 1990.[8] During a 1988 season 
that was one of the best of his career, Knepper made controversial remarks 
about Pam Postema, a female AAA umpire officiating a Major League spring 
training game. He said, "I just don’t think a woman should be an umpire. 
There are certain things a woman shouldn’t be and an umpire is one of them. 
It’s a physical thing. God created women to be feminine. I don’t think 
they should be competing with men. It has nothing to do with her ability. 
I don’t think women should be in any position of leadership. I don’t think 
they should be presidents or politicians. I think women were created not 
in an inferior position, but in a role of submission to men. You can be 
a woman umpire if you want, but that doesn’t mean it’s right. You can be 
a homosexual if you want, but that doesn’t mean that’s right either."[9] 
He also criticized the National Organization for Women, saying, "They are 
a bunch of lesbians. Their focus has nothing to do with women's rights.
