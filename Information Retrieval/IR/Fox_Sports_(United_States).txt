Fox Sports is the programming division of the Fox Broadcasting Company, 
owned by 21st Century Fox, that is responsible for sports broadcasts on 
the network, and its dedicated regional and national sports cable channels. 
The flagship entity of 21st Century Fox's Fox Sports Media Group division, 
it was formed in 1994 with Fox's acquisition of broadcast rights to National 
Football League (NFL) games. In subsequent years, it has televised the 
National Hockey League (1994–1999), Major League Baseball (1996–present), 
NASCAR (2001–present), Bowl Championship Series (2007–2010), the USGA Championships 
(2015–present), NHRA (2016–present) and the FIFA World Cup (starting in 
2015). When the Fox Broadcasting Company launched in October 1986, the 
network's management, having seen how sports programming (in particular, 
soccer events) played a critical role in the growth of the British satellite 
service BSkyB, determined that sports would be the type of programming 
that would ascend Fox to a major network status the quickest; as a result, 
Fox tried to attract a professional football package to the network. In 
1987, after ABC initially hedged on renewing its contract with the National 
Football League (NFL) for the television rights to Monday Night Football, 
Fox made an offer for the package at the same price that ABC had been paying 
at the time – about $13 million per game. However, partly due to the fact 
that Fox had yet to establish itself as a major network, the NFL decided 
to resume negotiations with ABC, with the two parties eventually agreeing 
to a new contract, keeping what was the crown jewel of the league's television 
broadcasts on that network (where it remained until 2006, when MNF moved 
to sister network ESPN as part of a contract that also saw NBC gain the 
Sunday Night Football package). Six years later, as the league's television 
contracts for both the National Football Conference and American Football 
Conference divisions, and for the Sunday and Monday primetime football 
packages were up for renewal, Fox placed a bid for $1.58 billion to obtain 
the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference. On December 17, 
1993, the NFL selected Fox's bid and signed a four-year contract with the 
network to award it the rights to televise regular season and playoff (as 
well as select preseason) games from the NFC, beginning with the 1994 season; 
the initial contract also included the exclusive U.S. television rights 
to broadcast Super Bowl XXXI in 1997.[1] The deal stripped CBS of football 
telecasts for the first time since 1955. Fox also lured commentators Pat 
Summerall, John Madden, Dick Stockton, Matt Millen, James Brown and Terry 
Bradshaw as well as many behind-the-scenes production personnel from CBS 
Sports to staff the network's NFL coverage. In order to bolster viewership 
for the NFL telecasts, Fox parent News Corporation (which would spin-off 
Fox and most of its other television properties, except for those based 
in Australia, to 21st Century Fox in July 2013) decided to strike affiliation 
deals with broadcasting companies that owned stations affiliated with ABC, 
NBC and CBS in order to raise the profile of Fox's affiliate body, which 
at the time mainly consisted of UHF stations that (with some exceptions) 
had little to no prior history as a major network affiliate, had weaker 
signals and largely did not carry as much value with advertisers as the 
Big Three's affiliates. During the late spring and summer of 1994, Fox 
reached separate agreements with New World Communications (a media company 
controlled by investor Ronald Perelman, which Fox's station group Fox Television 
Stations would purchase in July 1996) and SF Broadcasting (a joint venture 
between Fox and Savoy Pictures that purchased four stations from Burnham 
Broadcasting through separate deals in July and August 1994) to switch 
a total of sixteen stations to Fox between September 1994 and September 
1996 as affiliation contracts with those stations' existing network partners 
expired.[2][3][4][5][6][7] The NFL television rights and affiliation deals 
firmly established Fox as the nation's fourth major network. The network's 
relationship with the NFL would expand in 1997, when it began airing games 
from NFL Europe, an agreement which ended when the European league folded 
in 2005. With a sports division now established, Fox decided to seek broadcast 
rights agreements with other major sports leagues. On September 9, 1994, 
Fox was awarded the broadcast television rights to the National Hockey 
League in a $155 million bid (amounting to $31 million annually);[8] as 
a result, it became the first broadcast network to be awarded a national 
television contract to carry NHL games, which longtime NHL Commissioner 
John Ziegler had long thought to be unattainable[9] (NHL games had not 
aired regularly on a national broadcast network – outside of select championship 
and All-Star games, and time buy basis airings of ESPN telecasts on ABC 
from 1992 to 1994 – since NBC's telecast of the 1975 Stanley Cup Finals, 
as networks were not willing to commit to broadcasting a large number of 
games due to low viewership). Again, Fox outbid CBS, which wanted to secure 
the rights as a result of losing the NFL to Fox, for the NHL package. Fox 
lost the NHL rights to ABC Sports and ESPN in 1999. On November 7, 1995, 
Fox was awarded partial broadcast rights to Major League Baseball games, 
in a shared deal with NBC (which had carried the league's telecasts since 
1947). Through the deal, which Fox paid a fraction of the amount ($115 
million) that CBS paid to obtain the rights effective with the 1990 season, 
Fox would broadcast approximately 16 regular season Saturday afternoon 
games per season (unlike the previous Baseball Network deal between NBC 
and CBS) and offered different game broadcasts shown on a regionalized 
basis (usually up to three per week). As part of a six-year renewal of 
this deal – valued at $2.5 billion – in September 2000, Fox Sports became 
the exclusive over-the-air broadcaster of Major League Baseball, giving 
it the exclusive rights to the World Series beginning with the 2000 edition, 
as well as rights to the All-Star Game, select Division Series games and 
exclusive coverage of the League Championship Series. Under a clause in 
the contract (which has not been exercised as there has not been a labor 
dispute during the term of rights while Fox Sports has held the contract), 
if some of the scheduled games were cancelled by a strike or lockout, Fox 
would still pay Major League Baseball for a full slate of annual games, 
while the league in turn had to compensate Fox with additional telecasts. 
In 1998, Fox obtained the broadcast rights to the Cotton Bowl Classic college 
football game; the game aired on Fox until 2014, with ESPN assuming the 
rights beginning with the 2015 game, adding it the five other bowl games 
comprising the College Football Playoff system that ESPN already broadcast, 
under a twelve-year deal worth over $7.3 billion.[10][11] On November 11, 
1999, NASCAR awarded Fox and sister cable channel FX the partial television 
rights to its races (as part of a four-network deal, valued at $2.4 billion, 
that also included NBC and TBS; the latter's rights were later assumed 
by TNT) starting with the 2001 season, with Fox and FX alternating coverage 
of all races held during the first half of the season (NBC and TNT would 
air all races held during the second half). The deal also included alternating 
coverage of the preeminent Daytona 500 race, with Fox televising it in 
odd-numbered years and NBC airing it in even-numbered years through 2006, 
with the opposing network airing the Pepsi 400 instead.[12] The rights 
later extended to sister motorsports-oriented cable network Speed Channel 
in October 2002, when it bought out ESPN's contract to televise the Camping 
World Truck Series races. Through a 2006 contract renewal, Fox became the 
exclusive U.S. broadcaster of the Daytona 500. In partnership with Speed, 
Fox has also broadcast the start of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and select 
Formula One races produced by Speed beginning in 2007, and also carries 
two Camping World Truck Series races per season that were transferred from 
Speed, and are produced under the Fox NASCAR brand. In 2007, Fox began 
airing most of the games that were part of the Bowl Championship Series, 
including the BCS Championship Game (although due to a separate arrangement 
between ABC and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association, events in 
the series that were held at the Rose Bowl stadium – such as the Rose Bowl 
Game and the 2010 BCS Championship – were excluded from the contract), 
in a deal worth close to $20 million per game.[13] ESPN assumed the BCS 
rights beginning in 2010.[14] In 2011, Fox began to increase its college 
football output through the introduction of a Saturday "game of the week" 
on FX, featuring games from the Pac-12, the Big 12 and Conference USA (the 
rights to which were later assumed by Fox and Fox Sports 1);[15] Fox also 
signed deals to carry two new championship games created through conference 
realignments that occurred in 2010 and 2011: the Big Ten Conference Championship 
through 2016 (as part of Fox Sports' involvement with the Big Ten Network),[16] 
and the Pac-12 Championship through 2017 on an alternating basis with ESPN.[17] 
In May 2010, Fox aired the final of the UEFA Champions League, marking 
the network's first ever soccer broadcast.[18] In August 2011, Fox Sports 
announced it had reached a seven-year broadcast agreement with the Ultimate 
Fighting Championship, ending the mixed martial arts promotion's relationship 
with Spike. The deal included the rights to broadcast four live events 
in prime time or late night annually, as well as other UFC programming 
that would air on various Fox properties, including the Fox network (which 
aired its first UFC match in November 2011, the first time that the UFC 
aired an event on broadcast television), FX and Fuel TV.[19][20] Fox previously 
carried events from UFC competitor International Fight League in 2007 on 
its sister network-turned-programming service MyNetworkTV under a time-buy 
arrangement until that organization was purchased by UFC; however, no MyNetworkTV 
involvement was announced under the current UFC agreement (by that point, 
the programming service had eliminated first-run programming to focus on 
off-network reruns of drama series). On August 6, 2013, Fox Sports announced 
a 12-year deal to broadcast the three major open championships of the United 
States Golf Association, including the U.S. Open, beginning in 2015.[21] 
In addition to the broadcast division, Fox Sports owns numerous regional 
and national cable sports channels in the United States, which include: 
Fox Sports Media Group formally announced the replacement of Speed with 
Fox Sports 1 on March 5, 2013, with a target launch date slated for August 
17. The network airs content from Major League Baseball, the UFC, NASCAR, 
soccer (including the FIFA World Cup) and multiple college sports events 
(including owning rights to Big East basketball and its annual postseason 
basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden). As a competitor to ESPN's 
SportsCenter, the network created Fox Sports Live, described as a "24/7 
news franchise providing around-the-clock coverage through regularly scheduled 
programs, hourly updates and an information-rich ticker that provides a 
network agnostic sports event television schedule."[22] Notable personalities 
on FS1 include Regis Philbin, Mike Tyson, Michael Strahan, Erin Andrews, 
as well as many other Fox Sports personalities.[23][24] On August 17, 2013, 
with little advanced promotion, the extreme sports-focused Fuel TV was 
rebranded as Fox Sports 2, a companion network serving primarily as an 
overflow channel for Fox Sports 1, along with providing supplementary sports 
coverage.[25] The networks launched on August 17, 2013. On September 2, 
2013, Fox Soccer was replaced by FXX, an entertainment-based sister network 
to FX with a focus on comedy programming. With the concurrent shutdown 
and replacement of the network, Fox Soccer's sports programming was shifted 
over to Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2. As a result, outside of very rare 
sports conflicts on both Fox Sports networks, FX no longer carries any 
sports programming.[26] Fox Soccer's companion premium service, Fox Soccer 
Plus, continues to exist and supplements soccer coverage on Fox Sports 
1 and Fox Sports 2. Fox Sports Networks operates as a slate of regional 
sports networks with broadcasting agreements that follow league market 
distribution rules (for example, cable and satellite subscribers in Kansas 
City, Missouri receive Kansas City Royals games on Fox Sports Midwest, 
while viewers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin see Milwaukee Brewers games on Fox 
Sports Wisconsin). The regionalized coverage frequently restricts broadcasts 
of live sporting events outside of a team's home market. The regional networks 
also air team, conference, or other regionally based analysis and biographical 
programming, as well as some common national programming. In some markets, 
the regional Fox Sports network operates an overflow (or "plus") feed that 
carries additional sports, documentary and magazine programs that cannot 
be carried on the main feed due to event conflicts. The graphics and scoring 
bugs used by Fox Sports have won awards and changed how sports broadcasts 
are presented on United States television.[citation needed] The opening 
notes of the theme used on the Fox network's NFL broadcasts are incorporated 
in iterations of other themes used on Fox Sports broadcasts. Originally, 
when the scoring bugs are upgraded, the previous versions were retained 
for one of the division's other properties for about a year; however, this 
practice ended in 2009. The first score bug was used for Fox's NFL coverage, 
and was then expanded to the network's baseball and hockey broadcasts. 
One segment of the Scott Schreer-composed theme, coincidentally or otherwise, 
echoes the notes for the "giddyup, giddyup, giddyup, let's go" line from 
the Leroy Anderson-composed song, Sleigh Ride. Although, the rhythm of 
that segment of both tunes is similar to that of the first four bars of 
both the first and second figures of the Johann Strauss Sr.-composed Radetzky 
March, which itself is similar to that of the finale of Giachino Rossini's 
overture to his opera William Tell. During sports broadcasts aired during 
the Christmas holiday season, Fox Sports broadcasts will sometimes acknowledge 
this fact by seguéing from the one tune into the other during the commercial 
break outcue. Beginning in October 2010, the NFL broadcast theme became 
uniform for all Fox Sports properties beginning with the National League 
Championship Series that year and NASCAR races with the 2011 Budweiser 
Shootout. It is yet unknown if this includes the Fox Sports Networks affiliates, 
as their basketball, hockey, baseball and college football broadcasts continue 
to use their own disctint theme music. By 2001, the score bug was restructured 
as a banner positioned at the top of the screen, and was simpler than the 
version used today. It was first utilized that year on Fox's NASCAR coverage 
with the introduction of a new updated graphics package that was based 
on the 1998 design; the banner and updated graphics were then utilized 
on the network's Major League Baseball and NFL telecasts. It featured a 
translucent black rectangle, a baseball diamond graphic for baseball broadcasts 
on the far left, the team abbreviations in white with their scores in yellow 
boxes (the boxes were white for NFL broadcasts until Super Bowl XXXVI, 
when the coloring was changed to yellow), then the quarter or inning, time 
or number of outs, pitch count/speed (used for baseball broadcasts), and 
the logo of the Fox Sports event property whose game is being telecast 
(such as NFL on Fox or MLB on Fox) on the far right. Beginning with the 
2003 NFL season, the banner was upgraded as part of a new graphics package. 
At first, the team abbreviations were replaced with team logos, and the 
scores were rendered in white within black parallelograms. Unlike the previous 
version, the FoxBox would alternate between a black rectangle and several 
black parallelograms; however, it reverted to being a black rectangle beginning 
with the 2004 NFL season, and the team logos would later be replaced with 
abbreviations in the respective teams' primary colors (the colorized team 
abbreviations would first be utilized on postseason baseball broadcasts 
that year). Whenever a team scores a point or a run, the team's score and 
logo would flash a few times. During baseball broadcasts, the entire banner 
would flash, with the words "HOME RUN" and the team's name in the team's 
color zooming in to the center from both left and right. In late 2005, 
a new white banner resembling a chrome finish was introduced, and the team 
abbreviations became rendered in white letters in the team's main color; 
the new banner would then be expanded to NFL and NASCAR broadcasts. The 
baseball broadcasts continued to use the 2001 scoring banners and graphics 
in 2004 until the network's coverage of that year's postseason. Beginning 
with the 2006 NFL season, the scoring banner was upgraded again. This time, 
real-time scores from around the league were included as a permanent fixture 
on the extreme right side of the bar, while the banner's coloring changed 
to the colors of the team currently in possession of the ball (this coloring 
scheme was seen only on football broadcasts). The banner no longer flashed 
after the scoring of runs, touchdowns or field goals. During baseball broadcasts, 
the diamond graphic appeared in middle-justification and was slimmed down 
to just the three main bases, unlike other implements which included home 
plate. This banner, after first being used for NFL broadcasts in 2006, 
was eventually expanded to Bowl Championship Series, NASCAR and baseball 
broadcasts; baseball telecasts, however, continued to use the late-2005 
scoring banners and graphics in 2007. In 2008, Fox NASCAR introduced a 
new camera embedded between turns one and two on the various tracks; it 
was soon known as "Digger Cam", unveiled alongside a gopher mascot named 
Digger. For the 2009 season, the 2006 graphics package was dropped entirely 
for Fox's baseball telecasts and replaced with the new Fox Sports Net graphics, 
which had debuted on baseball telecasts across FSN's affiliates that season. 
These were later repositioned for widescreen in July 2010, when Fox Sports 
began presenting all of its high definition programming content in the 
16:9 aspect ratio, with letterboxing on standard definition feeds relayed 
to pay television providers. At the beginning of the 2010 NFL pre-season, 
Fox debuted a new graphics package for its football coverage – an upgraded 
version of the 2006 design with a "much more colorful 3D look." The new 
graphics also marked a migration to Vizrt hardware for CG, providing producers 
with a more streamlined workflow for graphics.[27] The new design would 
be rolled out for Fox's racing coverage and the Speed network in 2011, 
at the start of the 2011 MLB season (where both Fox and the FSN networks 
would begin using it as well, excluding SportSouth games simulcast by WPCH-TV 
and Root Sports – which used the previous FSN appearance), and on Fox Soccer. 
Starting with the 2010 National League Championship Series, Fox began using 
its football theme music for its Major League Baseball broadcasts, to the 
confusion and dismay of some viewers. Division president Eric Shanks gave 
a rationale for the change, stating that the NFL theme music was more energetic 
than the previous theme; Shanks then announced that the NFL theme would 
be used for all Fox Sports telecasts going forward.[28] A new graphics 
package for Fox Sports broadcasts was introduced for Fox's NASCAR coverage 
leading up to the 2014 Daytona 500. Fox Sports Midwest producer Max Leinwand 
described the look as being "cleaner" than the previous design.[29] The 
design has also been used to introduce new design conventions for some 
of Fox's graphics; for NASCAR, the running order ticker was replaced by 
a leaderboard-style display that was initially displayed as a vertical 
sidebar, while MLB coverage now uses a scoreboard positioned in the bottom-left 
of the screen instead of the top-left.[29][30] For Super Bowl XXXVI in 
2002, Fox Sports produced its first telecast in a 16:9, 480p enhanced-definition 
format marketed as "Fox Widescreen"; while promoted as having better quality 
than standard definition, and being the first U.S. sporting event produced 
completely in a widescreen format, it was not true high definition, but 
still matched the aspect ratio of HDTV sets.[31][32] Fox Sports began producing 
selected events in 720p high definition, starting on July 3, 2004 with 
the Pepsi 400, select NFL games, the 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game, and that year's postseason. Fox would produce more telecasts in HD 
during the following years, but still fell back on using 480p widescreen 
for events not televised in HD.[32][33] As of late July 2010, all sports 
programming broadcast by Fox-owned networks began transitioning to a format 
optimized for 16:9 widescreen displays, with graphics framed within a widescreen 
safe area rather than the 4:3 safe area, intended to be shown in a letterboxed 
format on standard definition feeds.[34] In February 2008, Fox Sports announced 
a new charitable foundation called Fox Supports, which provides grants 
and marketing support for health-related causes. Each organization is tied 
to a specific events package seen on Fox Sports.[35] The following are 
the charities supported during the history of the program: Although the 
amount of sports content on the network has gradually expanded since Fox 
Sports was founded in 1994 (particularly since 2013), Fox's sports schedule 
on weekend afternoons has remained very inconsistent to this day as the 
majority of its sports contracts are with professional leagues and collegiate 
conferences associated with more widely known sporting events, with very 
limited supplementary coverage of amateur, extreme or winter sports (unlike 
NBC or CBS) that can be aired during the daytime even when major events 
are not broadcast – leaving absences in daytime sports coverage on either 
a Saturday, a Sunday or both on certain weeks. Syndicated programming (either 
in the form of feature films, series or both) and/or infomercials scheduled 
by the network's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, as well as 
occasional Fox Sports-produced specials and Fox-supplied preview specials 
for upcoming primetime shows fill Fox stations' weekend afternoon schedules 
on days with limited to no sports programming. Some of the network's sports 
telecasts (most frequently, college football and Sunday afternoon NFL games, 
and the World Series) delay or outright pre-empt regularly scheduled local 
evening newscasts on Fox stations due to typical overruns past a set time 
block or pre-determined later start times; a few Fox affiliates that maintain 
news departments (such as WBRC in Birmingham, Alabama and WVUE-DT in New 
Orleans) have opted not to air or have cancelled early evening newscasts 
on Saturdays and Sundays due to frequent sports preemptions in that daypart, 
while others (such as WDAF-TV in Kansas City, Missouri) instead reschedule 
their weekend early evening news programs to an earlier timeslot if possible 
when Fox is scheduled to air an evening game or race. As is done with CBS, 
Fox offers a flex schedule for its NFL, NCAA and Major League Baseball 
telecasts, featuring a selection of up to four games that vary on a regional 
basis, allowing either one or (often) two consecutive telecasts to air
