As player As manager Harry William Walker, known to baseball fans of the 
middle 20th century as "Harry the Hat" (October 22, 1916 – August 8, 1999), 
was an American baseball player, manager and coach. Born in Pascagoula, 
Mississippi, Harry was a member of a distinguished baseball family. He 
was the son of former Washington Senators pitcher Ewart "Dixie" Walker 
and the brother of Fred "Dixie" Walker, like Harry an outfielder, left-handed 
hitter, and National League batting champion. He was also the nephew of 
fellow Major League outfielder Ernie Walker. "Harry the Hat" got his nickname 
from his habit during at-bats of continually adjusting his cap between 
pitches—there were no batting helmets in his day. His batting title came 
in 1947, when he hit .363 in a season during which he was traded from his 
original team, the St. Louis Cardinals, to the Philadelphia Phillies. The 
previous year he was one of the stars of the Cardinals’ 1946 World Series 
championship team. In the decisive seventh game against the Boston Red 
Sox, with Enos Slaughter on first base, Harry doubled to left center and 
Slaughter, running on the pitch and taking advantage of a slow relay from 
the Red Sox' Johnny Pesky, scored from first base in a "mad dash" with 
the winning run. He knocked in six runs during that Series, and batted 
.412. Harry lacked his brother Dixie's power—he hit only ten home runs 
in all or parts of 11 seasons in the National League—but he compiled a 
.296 lifetime batting average with the Cards, Phils, Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati 
Reds and was to be famed throughout his coaching and managing career as 
a batting tutor. Harry and Dixie are the only brothers in MLB history to 
win batting titles, Dixie won the National League batting title with a 
.357 average in 1944 while playing for the Dodgers, while Harry accomplished 
the historical feat in 1947 after a trade from the Cardinals to the Philadelphia 
Phillies winning the National League batting title with a .363 average. 
After prepping as a skipper in the Cardinals’ minor league system beginning 
in 1951, Walker was called up from Rochester in the AAA International League 
on May 28, 1955, to replace Eddie Stanky as Cardinals’ manager.[1] However, 
the change backfired: the Cards plummeted two places in the standings under 
Walker, losing 67 of 118 games. Harry was replaced by Fred Hutchinson at 
the end of the 1955 season, and it would be another decade before he would 
again manage in the majors. During that exile, he returned to the Cardinal 
farm system to manage (1956–58; 1963–64), and served four years (1959–62) 
as a St. Louis coach. After piloting the Jacksonville Suns to the 1964 
International League pennant, Walker was hired[2] by the Pittsburgh Pirates 
as manager, replacing Danny Murtaugh, who stepped down for health reasons. 
Although the Pirates did not win a pennant during Walker's first two seasons, 
he made an immediate impact. His skill as a batting coach was an important 
factor in the transformation of the Pirates into the National League's 
top offensive team. The Pirates battled for the pennant until the closing 
days of the 1965 and 1966 seasons—each year finishing third behind the 
champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the runner-up San Francisco Giants. But 
when the 1967 Pirates—further strengthened by an off-season trade for standout 
shortstop Maury Wills—stumbled to a disappointing .500 mark in mid-season, 
Walker was let go on July 18 in favor of his predecessor, Murtaugh.[3] 
Less than a week later, Walker was hired to be the organizational batting 
coach for the Houston Astros.[4] Eleven months later, on June 18, 1968, 
the Astros replaced skipper Grady Hatton[5] with "Harry the Hat", still 
well-known from his stint as manager of the Texas League's Houston Buffaloes 
during the late 1950s. Featuring players like Joe Morgan, Jimmy Wynn, and 
Don Wilson, the Astros finished last in 1968, but their record under Walker 
was 49-52. In 1969, they contended for the National League West Division 
title before fading to finish 12 games behind the Atlanta Braves. After 
back-to-back 79-83 marks in 1970 and 1971, Walker was sacked August 26, 
1972, in favor of Leo Durocher; with the Astros at 67-54 and in third place 
at the time of the firing, it was Walker's best season in Houston. Over 
his managing career, he won 630 games, losing 604 (.511). After his firing, 
Walker returned to the Cardinals as a hitting instructor.[6] Walker served 
as the head baseball coach at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) 
from 1979 to 1986. He was the program's first coach. In ten seasons he 
compiled a record of 211-171, good for a .552 winning percentage. In 1981 
the Blazers were the champions of the Sun Belt Conference's North Division 
in just the third year of the program's existence. The Blazers repeated 
as North Division champions in 1982. Walker was profiled quite flatteringly 
in Jim Bouton's memoir of the 1969 season, Ball Four. In the book, Walker 
is seen as a knowledgeable manager who has good advice for his charges. 
Although many of the players complain that Walker talks too much, Bouton 
is careful to point out that Walker always makes a good point and has good 
advice. This is notable because Bouton was unafraid to show his earlier 
manager, Joe Schultz, in a much less flattering light. Bouton even tells 
a humorous story of how Walker himself would follow the advice he always 
gave when he played in an old timer's game. The players jokingly would 
yell tips that Walker always said, such as "hit the ball up the middle." 
Walker would then proceed to single up the middle, then break up the double 
play, prompting Astro third baseman Doug Rader to remark, "Son of a bitch. 
Every year Harry gets a hit up the middle and breaks up the double play." 
Walker died in Birmingham, Alabama, at the age of 82.[7] His interment
