Joseph David Magrane (born July 2, 1964) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher and is currently a color commentary broadcaster for the MLB Network.

1988, despite winning only five games (losing nine). He finished 4th in 
voting for the 1989 NL Cy Young with an 18-9 win-loss record, a 2.91 ERA 
and only 5 home runs surrendered in 234 2‚ÅÑ3 innings. An injured elbow in

and Magrane never really regained his early form. He did win 11 games between

than 2 wins or 74 innings pitched in any other season until his retirement 
in 1996 at the relatively early age of 32. Magrane is married to his wife 
Renee,[2] and have two daughters, Shannon and Sophia.[3] In 2012, Shannon
