The following is a list of the national television and radio networks and 
announcers that have broadcast American League Championship Series games 
over the years. It does include any announcers who may have appeared on 
local broadcasts produced by the participating teams. For all of the League 
Championship Series telecasts spanning from 1969–1975, only Game 2 of the 
1972 American League Championship Series (Oakland vs. Detroit) is known 
to exist. However, the copy on the trade circuit of Game 2 of the 1972 
ALCS is missing the Bert Campaneris–Lerrin LaGrow brawl. There are some 
instances where the only brief glimpse of telecast footage of an early 
LCS game can be seen in a surviving newscast from that night. For instance, 
the last out of the 1973 National League Championship Series as described 
by Jim Simpson was played on that night's NBC Nightly News, but other than 
that, the entire game is gone. On the day the New York Mets and Baltimore 
Orioles wrapped up their respective League Championship Series in 1969, 
a feature story on the CBS Evening News showed telecast clips of the ALCS 
game (there's no original sound, just voiceover narration). This is all 
that likely remains of anything from that third game of the Orioles–Twins 
series. While all telecasts of World Series games starting with 1972 are 
accounted for and exist, the LCS is still a spotty situation through the 
late 1970s: As previously mentioned, from 1969 until 1983, the Major League 
Baseball television contract allowed a local TV station in the market of 
each competing team to also carry the LCS games. From 1969–1975, there 
was no official national radio network coverage of the League Championship 
Series. NBC only had the national radio rights to the All-Star Game and 
World Series during this period. Instead, national coverage was provided 
by local team radio broadcasts being syndicated nationally over ad hoc 
networks. From 1969 to present, with the exception of the period between 
1969–1975, the non-National radio broadcasts of the American League Championship 
Series we're broadcast on the flagship station and the radio network of
