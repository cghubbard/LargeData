George John Kurowski (April 19, 1918 – December 9, 1999) was a third baseman 
in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis 
Cardinals (1941-49). Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted 
on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In 
a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home 
runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came 
from his already white hair.[1] A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski 
overcame several personal problems. Kurowski overcame childhood osteomyelitis,[2] 
which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm.[1] Before he 
started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, 
and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942.[1][3] 
His most productive season came in 1947, when he posted career-highs in 
average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging 
% (.544) and on-base % (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons 
(1943–47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a 
major league record for a third baseman (1944–45, 1947), and hit over .300 
three times (1945–47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, 
twice in fielding %, and once in double plays.[2] In four World Series 
appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI 
in 23 games, as the Cardinals were World Champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. 
His only home run in the Series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2–2 
tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis 
over the New York Yankees.[2] He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, 
in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and 
elbow problems and his playing career ended.[2] After that, he coached 
and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972.[1] He gained 
induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. [1] In 
an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published 
an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter," consisting of five ethnic baseball 
teams. Kurowski was the third baseman on Stein's Polish team. Kurowski
