Salomon B. Artiaga (born August 4, 1946) is a retired baseball executive, 
whose most significant role was as president of the National Association 
of Professional Baseball Leagues from 1988 through 1991.[1][2][3] Artiaga 
was born in Los Lunas, New Mexico, from Mexican descent. He is praised 
in baseball circles for helping and teaching Latino ballplayers in many 
aspects of the game, through cultural assimilation programs designed to 
prepare them for life in the United States, spending almost a half century 
in organized baseball working in different capacities for several organizations. 
In addition, he has authored many books to assist young Latin American 
players transition in their new environment.[4] Artiaga began his baseball 
career in 1965 with the Double-A El Paso Sun Kings of the Texas League, 
where he worked as assistant business manager for the team.[3] He then 
spent two years with the Class-A Tampa Tarpons of the Florida State League, 
first as its business manager and later as the general manager.[3] Following 
that, Artiaga was with the Cincinnati Reds organization in the scouting 
and player development department from 1967 through 1982.[5] He then moved 
to the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues office in 
1983, serving as administrator under president John H. Johnson.[6] At the 
time, the NAPBL attained attendance levels that had not been approached 
in nearly 40 years, while franchise values increased dramatically. In his 
new role, Artiaga helped draft the new disposition involving free agency 
for Minor League players, the so-called six-year free agent rule, which 
keeps a veteran player from being stuck in one farm system.[3] Johnson, 
who was re-elected to a three-year term in 1986, died in January 1988 and 
Artiaga succeeded him in the presidency three months later. During his 
first year in office, Artiaga saw the Minor Leagues raise to over 21,659,000 
fans in attendance with 188 clubs.[6] Artiaga remained in office until 
1991. After that, he worked one season as president of the Arizona Fall 
League and served as coordinator of cultural development for the Chicago 
White Sox from 1993 to 1999.[5] Additionally, he headed a committee that 
organized the Venezuelan Summer League, which was launched in 1997 as an 
alternative to the Dominican Summer League to improve the development of 
young prospects from Venezuela in their early years in organized baseball.[3] 
In between, he supervised presentations on steroid use during visits to 
its development academies.[7] Artiaga then found himself on the move again, 
this time as director of Latin American operations for the Philadelphia 
Phillies during 11 years spanning 1999â€“2009.[5] Afterward, he became the 
coordinator of cultural development for the Kansas City Royals for three 
years before retiring in 2012, ending 48 years of service in professional
