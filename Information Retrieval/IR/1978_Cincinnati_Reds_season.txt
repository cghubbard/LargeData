The 1978 Cincinnati Reds season was a season in American baseball. The 
Reds finished in second place in the National League West with a record 
of 92-69, 2Â½ games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Reds were managed 
by Sparky Anderson and played their home games at Riverfront Stadium. Following 
the season, Anderson was replaced as manager by John McNamara, and Pete 
Rose left to sign with the Philadelphia Phillies for the 1979 season. In 
honor of Saint Patrick's Day, Reds general manager Dick Wagner had green 
versions of the Reds' uniforms made. The Reds hosted the New York Yankees 
at Al Lopez Field on March 17, 1978. This was the first time a major league 
team wore green trimmed uniforms on March 17, a practice adopted in subsequent 
years by multiple major league teams.[4] During the season, Pete Rose tied 
the National League record with a 44-game hitting streak held by Willie 
Keeler. The streak began on June 14, and came to an end on August 1. On 
May 5, 1978, Rose became the 13th and youngest player in major league history 
to collect his 3,000th career hit, with a single off Expos pitcher Steve 
Rogers. On June 14 in Cincinnati, Rose singled in the first inning off 
Cubs pitcher Dave Roberts; Rose would proceed to get a hit in every game 
he played until August 1, making a run at Joe DiMaggio's record 56-game 
hitting streak, which had stood virtually unchallenged for 37 years. The 
streak started quietly, but by the time it had reached 30 games, the media 
took notice and a pool of reporters accompanied Rose and the Reds to every 
game. On July 19 against the Phillies, Rose was hitless going into the 
ninth with his team trailing. He ended up walking and the streak appeared 
over. But the Reds managed to bat through their entire lineup, giving Rose 
another chance. Facing Ron Reed, Rose laid down a perfect bunt single to 
extend the streak to 32 games. He eventually tied Willie Keeler's single 
season National League record at 44 games; but on August 1, the streak 
came to an end as Gene Garber of the Braves struck out Rose in the ninth 
inning. The competitive Rose was sour after the game, blasting Garber and 
the Braves for treating the situation "like it was the ninth inning of 
the 7th game of the World Series" and adding that "Phil Niekro would have 
given me a fastball to hit."[7] [8] Infielders Other batters Coaches Note:
