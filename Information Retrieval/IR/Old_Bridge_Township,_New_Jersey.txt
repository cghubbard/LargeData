Old Bridge Township is a township in Middlesex County, New Jersey, United 
States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the township had a total population 
of 65,375,[8][9][10] reflecting an increase of 4,919 (+8.1%) from the 60,456 
counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 3,981 (+7.0%) 
from the 56,475 counted in the 1990 Census.[21] As of the 2010 Census, 
the township was the state's 18th largest municipality, after being the 
state's 21st most-populous municipality in 2000.[22] Old Bridge is a bedroom 
suburb of New York City located across the Raritan Bay from Staten Island, 
and it is about 25 miles (40 km) from Manhattan,[23] and about 30 miles 
(48 km) south of Newark.[24] What is now Old Bridge Township was originally 
incorporated as Madison Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature 
on March 2, 1869, from portions of South Amboy Township (now City of South 
Amboy).[25] In a referendum held on November 5, 1975, voters approved changing 
the township's name to Old Bridge Township by a margin of 7,150 votes to 
4,888.[26][27] The township's name was changed to avoid confusion with 
the borough of Madison in Morris County.[26][28] Use of the name Old Bridge 
for a location "on the Camden and Amboy Railroad, about eight miles (13 
km) beyond South Amboy" or "about seven miles (11 km) from South Amboy" 
goes back, however, to at least 1853.[29] Initially, the township was made 
up of farms and the population grew slowly. In 1880, the population was 
1,662 and in 1950 it had reached 7,365. Over the next decade, a building 
boom started and farms gave way to developments, and the population grew 
to 22,772 by 1960. The 1980 census cited 51,406 people. The township saw 
major changes with the extension of Route 18 to the shore. The township 
was named as a contender for the title of one of the best places to live 
in the United States by Money magazine in both 2005 and 2007.[30][31] In 
2016, SafeWise named Old Bridge Township as the sixth-safest city in America 
to raise a child; the township was the second-highest ranked of the 12 
communities in New Jersey included on the list.[32] The first inhabitants 
of the area known as Old Bridge, were the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. 
Those who settled in Old Bridge were known as the Unami, or "people down 
the river."[27] They, like many people today, migrated to the shore along 
the Raritan each summer from their hunting grounds in the north. When the 
English gained control from the Dutch in 1664, the state was divided into 
two provinces, East Jersey and West Jersey. In 1683, the general assembly 
of East Jersey defined the boundaries of Middlesex County and the three 
other original counties (Bergen, Essex and Monmouth) as containing all 
plantations on both sides of the Raritan River, as far as Cheesequake Harbor 
to the east, then southwest to the Provincial line, with the southwest 
line being the border of Monmouth and Middlesex Counties and the Township's 
southern border.[33] Thomas Warne, one of the original 24 proprietors of 
East Jersey, was listed as a landowner of this area, and his son is said 
to have been the earliest white resident residing in the Cheesequake area 
in 1683. John and Susannah Brown were granted a 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) land 
grant from the King of England in 1737. They called the area Brownville, 
and today this part of town is now known as Browntown.[27] Other important 
proprietors of Old Bridge were the Bowne, Morgan, Letts, Brown, Tone, Herbert 
and Cottrell families, who date back as some of the first landowners of 
Old Bridge. In 1684, South Amboy Township was formed. At that time, it 
covered an area that now consists of the Townships of Monroe and Old Bridge, 
the Borough of Sayreville and the City of South Amboy. The Township covers 
42 square miles (110 km2) that separated from South Amboy on March 2, 1869, 
and was originally called Madison Township.[34] In 1975, the name was changed 
by referendum to the Township of Old Bridge. The purpose of doing this 
was to formulate just one postal designations and ZIP code for the township 
and to differentiate the township from the Borough of Madison in Morris 
County.[35][36] Old Bridge derives its name from the fact that the first 
bridge spanning the South River was built there, and as other bridges were 
built across the river the first one became known as "the Old Bridge." 
Prior to that, it was known as South River Bridge."[37] According to the 
United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 40.783 square 
miles (105.627 km2), including 38.060 square miles (98.575 km2) of land 
and 2.723 square miles (7.052 km2) of water (6.68%).[1][2] Brownville (2010 
population of 2,383[38]), Laurence Harbor (2010 population of 6,536[39]), 
Madison Park (2010 population of 7,144[40]) and Old Bridge CDP (2010 population 
of 23,753[41]) are unincorporated communities and census designated places 
(CDPs) located within Old Bridge Township.[42][43] Other unincorporated 
communities, localities and place names within Old Bridge Township include 
Browntown, Brunswick Gardens, Cheesequake, Cottrell Corners, East Spotswood, 
Matchaponix, Moerls Corner, Morristown, Parlin, Redshaw Corner, Runyon, 
Sayre Woods South, South Old Bridge and Texas.[44] Old Bridge Township 
shares a border with New York City, sharing a boundary with the borough 
of Staten Island across Raritan Bay. The township also borders East Brunswick 
Township, Monroe Township, Sayreville and Spotswood in Middlesex County; 
and Aberdeen Township, Manalapan Township, Marlboro Township and Matawan 
in Monmouth County.[45] Madison Township had many mill streams that were 
used to generate water power. The Warne family owned fulling mills in the 
area. Fulling was used as a finishing process used on woolen cloth that 
would remove the dirt and grease and to compact the wool fibers. The mill 
is said to have been run behind Old Bridge High School and flows east into 
the Matawan Creek. The area of Old Bridge was also known for their numerous 
snuff mills. The Washington Snuff mill (later renamed the Dill Snuff Mill) 
was established in 1801 and was located on Mount Pleasant and Old Bridge 
Turnpike (now Route 516). Snuff is a scented tobacco product that was used 
by men and women during that time period.[46] The clay soil in the area 
surrounding Old Bridge was used for pottery and bricks way before the first 
European settlers. "Fine clay had surrounded Cheesequake Creek when the 
Lenni Lenape Native Americans lived there. The early discoveries of clay 
along the banks opened the clay industry to Middlesex County as well as 
the state of New Jersey. By the 1800s clay was a major industry. The clay 
deposits found along Cheesequake Creek are reported to be some of the finest 
stoneware clays in the United States."[35] The clay supplied local potters 
as well as those in Hudson Valley, Norwalk, Connecticut, other New England 
states, and parts of Canada. The earliest use of clay from this area was 
used by Captain James Morgan before the Revolution. The Perrine clay pit 
was located near U.S. Route 9 and Ernston Road.[46] The Cottrell homestead 
is a landmark in Old Bridge. It was built in 1831 and still stands today 
on the northeast corner of County Route 516 and Cottrell Road. The Cottrells 
owned a 150 acres (0.61 km2) apple orchard that was located across the 
street from their home. Apples that could not be used because of their 
size or quality did not go to waste. Across from the cold-storage building 
on the southwest corner of Cottrell Road and Route 516 (where Rite Aid 
is now located), the family built the New Jersey Apple Growers Inc. distillery. 
It was at this distillery that they pressed the apples into cider and distilled 
the brandy in large vats. The brandy would age in barrels in a government 
warehouse that was located on the Cottrells' property. The Cottrells produced 
apple brandy for twenty years on the farm and sold it wholesale to distributors 
under the name Browntown.[35] At the 2010 United States Census, there were
