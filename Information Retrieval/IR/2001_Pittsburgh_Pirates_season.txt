The 2001 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the 120th season of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates franchise; the 115th in the National League. This was the franchise's 
first season at its new venue, PNC Park. The Pirates finished sixth and 
last in the National League Central with a record of 62–100. The year also 
saw longtime Pirate Bill Mazeroski inducted into the Hall of Fame.[2] [1]

Coaches The Pirates opened the park with two pre-season games against the 
New York Mets, the first was played on March 31, 2001.[8] The first official 
baseball game played in PNC Park was between the Cincinnati Reds and the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, on April 9, 2001. The Reds won the game by the final 
score of 8–2. The first pitch was thrown by Todd Ritchie, a ball to Barry 
Larkin. In the top of the first inning, Sean Casey's two-run home run was 
the first hit in the park. The first Pirates' batter, Adrian Brown, struck 
out; however, later in the inning Jason Kendall singled, the first hit 
by a Pirate. Two days later, John Vander Wal became the first Pirate to 
hit a home run in the park.[9] Upon opening in 2001, PNC Park was praised 
by fans and media alike. Jim Caple, of ESPN.com, ranked PNC Park as the 
best stadium in Major League Baseball, with a score of 95 out of 100.[10] 
He compared the park to Fallingwater, calling the stadium itself "perfect", 
and citing the high ticket prices as the only negative aspect of visiting 
the park.[11] Pirates' vice-president Steve Greenberg said, "We said when 
construction began that we would build the best ballpark in baseball, and 
we believe we've done that."[9] Major League Baseball executive Paul Beeston 
has said the park was the best he's seen so far in baseball.[9] Many of 
the workers who built the park said that it was the nicest that they have 
seen.[12] In 2008, Men's Fitness named the park one of "10 big league parks 
worth seeing this summer".[13][14] 2001 Major League Baseball All-Star
