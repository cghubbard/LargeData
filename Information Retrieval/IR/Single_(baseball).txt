In baseball, a single is the most common type of base hit, accomplished 
through the act of a batter safely reaching first base by hitting a fair 
ball (thus becoming a runner) and getting to first base before a fielder 
puts him out. As an exception, a batter-runner reaching first base safely 
is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another 
runner on the first play; this is one type of a fielder's choice. Also, 
a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder's error 
trying to put him out at first base or another runner out (as a fielder's 
choice) is not credited with a single. On a single hit to the outfield, 
any runners on second base or third base normally score, and sometimes 
the runner from first base is able to advance to third base. Depending 
on the location of the hit, a quick recovery by the outfielder can prevent 
such an advance or create a play on the advancing runner. Hitters who focus 
on hitting singles rather than doubles or home runs are often called "contact 
hitters". Contact hitters who rely on positioning their hits well and having 
fast running speed to achieve singles are often called "slap hitters". 
Ty Cobb, Pete Rose, Tony Gwynn, and Ichiro Suzuki are examples of contact 
hitters; of these, Rose and Suzuki might be called slap hitters. There 
is no universally accepted symbol for a single. Most often, singles are 
not reported; rather, the total number of hits, doubles, triples, and home 
runs is reported; then, hits minus these "extra base hits" yields the number 
of singles. Sometimes, 1B is used as the symbol for singles; however, this 
symbol is more commonly used for the first baseman or for first base itself. 
Another possible symbol is a horizontal line, -. The letter S is never
