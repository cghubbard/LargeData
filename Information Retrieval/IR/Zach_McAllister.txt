Zachary Taylor McAllister (born December 8, 1987) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher with the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball. He 
was drafted out of high school by the New York Yankees in 2006. After several 
seasons in the Yankees minor league system, he was traded to the Cleveland 
Indians in 2010. McAllister made his major league debut in July 2011 and 
earned his first major league win in May 2012. McAllister played basketball 
and baseball for Illinois Valley Central High School out of Chillicothe, 
Illinois throughout his high school career. His senior year, McAllister 
was a key component to bringing IVC enroute to its first IHSA State Finals 
appearance against Seneca HS for the Class 1A Boy's Basketball State championship. 
Despite losing to Seneca 44-47, McAllister was a key player scoring 10 
points total for the Ghosts.[1][2] Three months later, McAllister brought 
the Grey Ghosts back to the State Finals this time for the Class 1A State 
Baseball championship against Trenton (Wesclin) HS. McAllister entered 
the State final boasting an 11-1 record, .475 BA, 107 SO, and a .74 ERA.[3][4] 
McAllister was named Gatorade Illinois Baseball Player of the Year for 
2005-2006.[5] McAllister was drafted by the New York Yankees in the third 
round of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft out of Illinois Valley Central 
High School.[6] McAllister was ranked the Yankees' sixth best prospect 
prior to the 2009 season, according to Baseball America,[7] and their fifth 
best prospect prior to the 2010 season.[8] He was named the Yankees' Minor 
League Pitcher of the Year in 2009 for his performance with the Double-A 
Trenton Thunder.[9] However, he struggled in 2010 with the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Yankees.[10] At the 2010 MLB trade deadline, the Yankees and Seattle Mariners 
almost completed a deal that would have sent McAllister, Jes√∫s Montero, 
and David Adams to the Seattle Mariners for Cliff Lee. When the teams shared 
medical reports, the Mariners determined that Adams' ankle was broken, 
not sprained.[11] As a result, they chose to trade Lee to the Texas Rangers 
in a package centered on Justin Smoak.[12] On August 20, he was revealed 
to be the player to be named later in the July 30 trade between the Yankees 
and Cleveland Indians for Austin Kearns.[9][13] After the 2010 season, 
McAllister was added to the Indians' 40-man roster to protect him from 
the Rule 5 draft.[14] After teammate Fausto Carmona was sent to the disabled 
list, McAllister was activated and made his major league debut against 
the Toronto Blue Jays on July 7, 2011 at Progressive Field in Cleveland.[15] 
McAllister earned his first MLB victory on May 7, 2012 against the Chicago 
White Sox.[16] In a May 13, 2012 road game against the Boston Red Sox, 
McAllister started in place of injured pitcher Josh Tomlin and recorded 
a career-high 8 strikeouts in a 4-1 loss. McAllister pitched 7 innings 
and gave up 4 runs on 8 hits.[17] McAllister recorded the shortest outing 
of his career on August 6, pitching 1.2 innings. He gave up 9 runs, 2 earned.[18] 
He was designated for assignment on August 1, 2014,[19] and optioned to 
the Triple-A Columbus Clippers on August 3. At the end of the 2016 regular 
season, McAllister finished with a 3.44 ERA and would be added to the postseason 
roster as the Indians clinched its first Central divsion title since 2007.[20] 
On October 17, 2016, McAllister made his first postseason debut as the 
fourth pitcher of Game 3 of the ALCS against the Blue Jays. He faced three 
batters before giving up one run, before being pulled in favor of Bryan 
Shaw.[21] During Game 2 of the World Series, McAllister made his second 
postseason appearance relieving Trevor Bauer. McAllister pitched through 
the fifth inning with two strikeouts before issuing a walk and two earned 
runs.[22] From 2010 to 2014, McAllister threw a four-seam and two-seam 
fastball in the low 90s, a cut fastball in the mid-high 80s, a changeup 
averaging about 80, and a curveball in the high 70s.[23] Some sources also 
list him as throwing a slider.[24] Since being converted into a reliever
