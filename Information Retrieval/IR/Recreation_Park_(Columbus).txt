Recreation Park is a former baseball ground located in Columbus, Ohio, 
USA. The ground was home to the Columbus Buckeyes of the American Association 
for the 1883 and 1884 seasons as well as the Columbus Solons from 1889 
to 1891. The park was located in the Schumacher Place neighborhood, and 
was bound by Schiller (now East Whittier) Street to the south, Jaeger Street 
to the west, Ebner Street to the east and eventually East Kossuth Street 
to the north. The site is now occupied by a Giant Eagle and is bisected 
by South Grant Avenue.[1] On November 1, 1890 the Ohio State University 
football team played their first home game at Recreation Park. A historical 
marker was put up at the former site of the field on October 20, 2006 to 
commemorate the first Ohio State home game, a 64–0 loss to Wooster.[2]
