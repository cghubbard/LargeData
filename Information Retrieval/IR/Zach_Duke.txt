Zachary Thomas "Zach" Duke (born April 19, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Arizona Diamondbacks, 
Washington Nationals, Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Brewers, and Chicago White 
Sox. Duke was born in Clifton, Texas.[1] He was drafted directly out of 
Midway High School in Waco, Texas, in the 20th round of the 2001 draft,[2] 
and began his career the following year with the Pirates' rookie level 
Gulf Coast League team. He spent 2003 with the low-A Hickory Crawdads. 
In 2004, Duke led all minor league pitchers with a 1.46 earned run average 
(24 earned runs in 148.1 innings pitched). He posted a 15-6 record in 26 
combined starts between Class-A Lynchburg and Double-A Altoona, and his 
15 wins tied for third-most among all minor league pitchers. Following 
the 2004 season, Duke was named Pittsburgh's Minor League Pitcher-of-the-Year 
and earned Carolina League Pitcher-of-the-Year honors.[3] He was selected 
by Baseball America as the sixth-best prospect in the Eastern League and 
the best pitching prospect (fourth-best prospect overall) in the Carolina 
League. He was also recognized by the publication as having the best breaking 
pitch in the league. Duke made his major league debut on July 2, 2005 against 
the Milwaukee Brewers, striking out nine and receiving a no-decision in 
the Pirates 5-3 loss. His nine strikeouts were the most by a Pirate making 
their MLB debut since Tim Wakefield on July 31, 1992. Duke's debut month 
included a 3-0 shutout victory against Greg Maddux and the Cubs on July 
16 and 22 consecutive scoreless innings from July 2 to July 21. He was 
named National League Rookie of the month for July while compiling a 0.87 
ERA, the best among all starting pitchers in the Major Leagues.[4] He became 
only the second Pittsburgh rookie to win his first 5 decisions, along with 
Whitey Glazner. He also became one of only four pitchers during the Live-ball 
era to record an ERA below 1.00 in their first six starts (the others being 
Fernando Valenzuela, Boo Ferriss and Steve Rogers).[5] Duke finished 2005 
with an 8-2 record in 14 starts, striking out 58 in 84.2 innings. He finished 
in fifth place in the Rookie of the Year voting, garnering 10% of the vote. 
Duke's first full season with the Pirates was as the new team ace, anchoring 
a very young rotation with Ian Snell. Duke had a number of good starts 
in the first half of the season, but many of them were undone by the Pirates' 
weak bullpen and lack of run support for Duke. The second half of 2006 
was a re-emergence of the Duke that had dazzled Pittsburgh with his stuff 
from the previous year, and, on a side note, it was the first time the 
Pirates had compiled a winning record for a half of a season since 1992. 
Duke recorded 2 complete game efforts, the only 2 that Pittsburgh had all 
season. His first was a shutout of the Chicago Cubs on May 2, but he only 
had 2 strikeouts and a walk. His better effort was on August 11 against 
the St. Louis Cardinals. While he scattered 8 hits, Duke only allowed 1 
run (it was earned), recorded no walks and 7 strikeouts. Duke also threw 
11 fewer pitches than his previous complete game effort, and recorded 14 
ground-ball outs. Duke's final line for the 2006 season was 10-15 with 
a 4.47 ERA and 117 strikeouts against 68 walks. Duke also became the first 
Pirates starter since Kris Benson in 2000 to throw more than 200 innings 
with 215 and 1/3 innings pitched. In 2008 he gave up more doubles than 
any other pitcher in the majors, with 58, and more sacrifice hits, with 
14.[6] Zach Duke was named to the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, 
replacing the injured Matt Cain.[7] He finished off 2009 with an 11-16 
record, a 4.06 era, 3 complete games, 1 shutout, 23 home runs given up, 
only 3 hit batsmen, 49 walks, 106 strikeouts, a .285 average against, 1.31 
walks and hits per innings pitched, and 213 inning pitched. On November 
24, 2010, the Pittsburgh Pirates traded Duke to the Arizona Diamondbacks 
for a player to be named later, determined to be César Valdez.[8] On May 
28, 2011, Duke was activated off the disabled list and made his first start 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks, replacing Micah Owings in the rotation. 
He also hit his first major league home run that day, a three-run home 
run off of Bud Norris.[9] Duke made 9 starts in the rotation, going 2-4 
with a 5.47 ERA, and opponents hitting .336/.368/.481 off of him. On July 
15, Duke was relocated to the bullpen,[10] where he fared slightly better 
in a long-relief role, recording a 3.86 ERA in 25.2 innings, only striking 
out 6 while walking 8. Overall in 2011, Duke was 3-4 with a 4.91 ERA in 
21 appearances. Duke signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros 
on January 27, 2012. He also received an invitation to spring training; 
however, he was released on March 27.[11] Duke signed a minor league contract 
with the Washington Nationals on March 29, 2012 playing for the Washington 
Nationals's AAA affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs.[12] He was brought up to 
the majors[13] and relieved Stephen Strasburg in the third inning in what 
was to be Strasburg's final home appearance of the 2012 season. On December 
2, 2012, Duke resigned with the Nationals on a 1-year deal to serve as 
the team's long reliever.[14] He was designated for assignment on June 
4, 2013. On June 10, 2013, Duke was released by Washington.[15] Duke signed 
a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds on June 13, 2013.[16][17] 
He eventually was promoted to the big league club and recorded an 0.84 
ERA in ten and two-thirds innings pitched. Duke was invited to spring training 
with the Milwaukee Brewers for 2014 and made the roster as a left-handed 
relief specialist. He recorded his first win of 2014 on April 20 against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. Duke had emerged as a key member of the Brewers' 
bullpen, finding success against lefties and righties. As of July 21, his 
ERA was a minuscule 1.16, and he had struck out 49 batters in 38 1/3 innings 
pitched. He finished the year strong, recording a 2.45 ERA with 74 strikeouts 
to only 17 walks in 58.2 innings, appearing in 74 games and notching 12 
holds. He limited left-handed hitters to a .198 batting average. Duke signed 
a three-year, $15 million contract with the Chicago White Sox on November 
18, 2014.[18] On July 31, 2016, the White Sox traded Duke to the St. Louis 
Cardinals for outfielder Charlie Tilson.[19] He married Kristin Gross in 
Evansville, Indiana, in November 2007. They met when she was an emcee for 
the Indianapolis Indians. His best man was former Pirates closer Matt Capps.[20]
