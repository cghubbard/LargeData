Max Robert Stassi (born March 15, 1991) is an American professional baseball 
catcher for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made 
his MLB debut with the Astros in the 2013 season. Stassi attended Yuba 
City High School in Yuba City, California. He played for his school's baseball 
team, and was twice named The Sacramento Bee's player of the year.[1] Stassi 
also competed for the United States national baseball team, winning gold 
in the 2006 Pan American Games in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, and the International 
Baseball Federation's 16 and Under Baseball World Championship in 2007.[2] 
He finished his high school career with a .514 batting average, 40 home 
runs, and 162 runs batted in.[3] Stassi committed to attend the University 
of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), to play college baseball for the UCLA 
Bruins.[1] Heading into the 2009 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, Sporting 
News called Stassi the best available high school catcher. Stassi made 
it clear that he expected a large signing bonus to agree to a professional 
contract. A potential first round pick, Stassi was not selected in the 
first three rounds, which Baseball America called "one of the biggest surprises" 
of the draft.[4] The Oakland Athletics selected Stassi in the fourth round, 
with the 123rd overall selection, of the draft.[5] He received a $1.5 million 
bonus, a record for a fourth round pick, forgoing his commitment to UCLA.[1] 
Stassi also negotiated in his contract that the Athletics would invite 
him to spring training with the major league team in 2010.[6] Stassi played 
for the Vancouver Canadians of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, 
and had a .280 batting average.[6] In 2010, he performed well at spring 
training, impressing team officials, who assigned him to the Kane County 
Cougars of the Class A Midwest League.[7][8] He played for the Stockton 
Ports of the Class A-Advanced California League in 2011,[9] but missed 
the end of the season with shoulder surgery. The Athletics invited him 
to spring training in 2012.[10] He batted .268 with 15 home runs and 45 
RBIs in 84 games with Stockton during the 2012 season.[11] After the 2012 
season, the Athletics traded Stassi to the Houston Astros with Brad Peacock 
and Chris Carter for Jed Lowrie and Fernando Rodriguez.[11] Playing for 
the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class AA Texas League in 2013, Stassi hit 
home runs in five consecutive games in July.[12] He was named the Texas 
League's player of the week twice in July,[13] and was named the Texas 
League's player of month for July.[14] The Astros promoted Stassi to the 
majors on August 20, 2013,[13] to serve as a backup to Jason Castro when 
the Astros placed Carlos Corporán on the disabled list. Making his MLB 
debut that day, he recorded two hits.[14] In his second MLB game, Stassi 
was hit in the face by a 96 miles per hour (154 km/h) fastball,[15] which 
resulted in his being placed on the disabled list.[16][17] Since the bases 
were loaded at the time he was plunked, he earned his first major-league 
RBI. Stassi began the 2014 season with the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the 
Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL).[18] He finished the season with the 
Houston Astros, batting .350 (7 for 20) and driving in four runs in seven 
games played. Stassi played for the Fresno Grizzlies of the PCL in 2015, 
before being promoted to the major leagues in August due to an injury to 
Castro.[19] He played in 11 games for the Astros. Following the offseason 
trade of Hank Conger, Stassi entered spring training in 2016 expected to 
become the backup to Castro.[20] In March, he had surgery on a fractured 
hamate bone in his left wrist, and will miss six weeks.[21] Stassi's father, 
grandfather, and great-grandfather played as catchers in minor league baseball. 
His father, Jim, coached him at Yuba City.[22] Max's great uncle, Myril 
Hoag, played in three World Series, batting .320 in them.[23][24] His brother, 
Brock Stassi, is a minor league player in the Philadelphia Phillies organization. 
Max and Brock Stassi have raised more than $100,000 with an annual charity 
event held in Yuba City, called "Homers for the Hungry." The money goes
