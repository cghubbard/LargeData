The 1998 Chicago Cubs season was the 127th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 123rd in the National League and the 83rd at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished second in the National League Central with a record of 90–73. 
The season was a significant one for the team for several reasons. Firstly, 
it saw the Cubs reach the playoffs for the first time since 1989 by way 
of a Wild Card berth, which they clinched after winning a one-game playoff 
against the San Francisco Giants. The Cubs, however, would lose the Division 
Series in a 3-0 sweep by the Atlanta Braves. The season also saw Sammy 
Sosa, along with Mark McGwire, surpass the existing single-season home 
run record of 61. Sosa would hold the home run lead at several points over 
the course of the season, eventually finishing four homers behind McGwire 
(66 and 70 respectively). The 1998 season also saw the debut of Kerry Wood, 
who drew immediate national attention because of a 20-strikeout performance 
in his fifth career start, a 13-6 record over 26 starts, and more than 
12 strikeouts per nine innings pitched. On February 18, 1998, Cubs broadcaster 
Harry Caray died. Caray had the benefit of being in the booth during the 
NL East title run in 1984, when being a Cub fan became more popular to 
Chicagoans. His trademark call of "Holy Cow!" and his singing of "Take 
me out to the ballgame" during the 7th inning stretch made Caray a fan 
favorite both locally and, thanks to WGN's superstation status, on a national 
level as well. The Cubs still have a live singer, usually a celebrity, 
during the 7th inning stretch to honor Caray's memory to this day. Caray 
is also honored with a statue located at the corner of Sheffield and Addison 
streets, and during the 1998 season, a patch with Caray's caricature and 
Brickhouse's trademark "Hey Hey" were worn on the players sleeves to honor 
the passing of both commentators within a span of a few months. Harry's 
popularity also led to his grandson Chip Caray joining the broadcast team 
in winter of 1997, shortly before Harry's death. In the final game of the 
season, with the Cubs and Giants tied for the Wild Card lead, a Terry Mulholland 
throwing error cost the Cubs a victory against the Houston Astros, as San 
Francisco held an early lead in Colorado, and the teams playoff hopes were 
in jeopardy. However, a Neifi Pérez walk-off home run gave the Rockies 
a win and forced a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
