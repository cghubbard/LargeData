Eric Orlando Young Jr. (born May 25, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball second baseman and outfielder who is a free agent. He previously 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Colorado Rockies, Atlanta 
Braves, New York Mets and New York Yankees. He was the National League 
stolen base champion in 2013. He is the son of former professional baseball 
player Eric Young. Young was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and graduated 
from Piscataway High School in Piscataway, New Jersey. He had a football 
scholarship to attend Villanova University. The Colorado Rockies selected 
Young in the 30th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft, and he 
signed rather than attend college.[1] He began his career playing in 2004 
for the Casper Rockies (now the Grand Junction Rockies), that was an advanced 
rookie team and that was part of the Pioneer League that is located in 
Casper, Wyoming. In 2006 Young led all minor leaguers in stolen bases, 
with 87.[2] He then won the Arizona Fall League batting title, finishing 
with a .430 average.[3] Young appeared in the 2009 Futures Game, hitting 
a three-run home run. The world team won 7 to 5.[4] Young made his major 
league debut on August 25, 2009 for the Colorado Rockies playing Center 
Field. He had his first career hit in this game during the 5th inning and 
ended the game 1-4. Eric Young Sr. was in attendance for his son's debut. 
On September 8, 2009, he hit his first career home run in the bottom of 
the 6th inning against the Cincinnati Reds. During spring training for 
the 2010 season he was optioned to the team's Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado 
Springs Sky Sox.[5] On April 25, 2010, Young was recalled to the Rockies 
from the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. On May 15, 2010 he suffered a stress 
fracture and was placed on the DL to return to Coors Field on August 14, 
2010. On May 27, 2011 he was called back up to the Rockies with an above 
300 batting average from the Sky Sox. He was designated for assignment 
on June 12, 2013 and traded to the New York Mets on June 18, 2013 in exchange 
for Collin McHugh.[6] On July 24, 2013, Young was involved in a season-ending 
accident with Tim Hudson. Hudson was covering the first base bag and Young 
attempted to beat the groundout. When Young stepped late on the bag, his 
cleat dug hard into Hudson's ankle full stride, unnaturally rolling it. 
This incident broke Hudson's ankle, and ultimately ended Hudson's last 
season with the Braves. Young expressed extreme concern for Hudson after 
the play ended.[7] On August 2, 2013, Young hit the first walk-off hit 
of his career, a two-run home run, in the 11th inning against the Kansas 
City Royals. On September 29, 2013, in the final game of the season, Young 
stole his 45th and 46th bases against the Milwaukee Brewers, becoming the 
National League stolen base leader. He is the Mets' first stolen bases 
champion since Jos√© Reyes in 2007. On December 2, 2014, Young was non-tendered 
by the Mets. Young signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves 
on February 13, 2015. The deal included an invitation to spring training.[8][9] 
On June 5, 2015, the Braves designated Young for assignment.[10] On August 
22, 2015, Young was traded back to the Mets in exchange for cash considerations.[11] 
Young was removed from the 40-man roster on November 5, 2015 making him 
a free agent.[12] Young went with a batting average of .153 with no homeruns, 
five RBIs and .217 on-base percentage with both the Braves and the Mets 
in 2015. On January 5, 2016, Young signed a minor league contract with 
the Brewers, with an invitation to spring training.[13] Young was one of 
nine players competing to be the Brewers center fielder for the 2016 season.[14] 
Center field was one of the last positions the Brewers decided,[15][16] 
but Young did not make the Opening Day roster.[17] On August 31, 2016, 
the Brewers traded Young to the New York Yankees for cash considerations. 
The Yankees assigned Young to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders.[18]
