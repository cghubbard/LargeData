The 1999 Houston Astros season was a season in American baseball. The Astros 
won their third consecutive National League Central division title. It 
was their final season playing in the Astrodome as their home ballpark. 
In 1999, the Astros played their final season in the Astrodome as their 
new stadium was being prepared for play to begin in the 2000 season. The 
ballpark was first christened as Enron Field on April 9, 1999, with naming 
rights sold to the Houston energy and financial trading company in a 30-year, 
$100 million deal. Astros management faced a public relations nightmare 
when the energy corporation went bankrupt in the midst of one of the biggest 
corporate scandals in American history in 2001, and they bought back the 
remainder of Enron's thirty years of naming rights for $2.1 million, rechristening 
the ballpark as Astros Field on February 7, 2002. The field was unofficially 
known as "The Field Formerly Known As Enron" by fans and critics alike, 
in wake of the Enron scandal. On June 5, 2002, Houston-based Minute Maid, 
the fruit-juice subsidiary of Coca-Cola, acquired the naming rights to 
the stadium for 28 years at a price exceeding $100 million. Based on its 
downtown location next to the old Union Station buildings, one of the suggested 
names (and nicknames) is the Ballpark at Union Station, or the BUS. During 
its days as Enron Field, it was also dubbed "Ten-Run" or "Home Run" Field 
due to its cozy left-field dimensions. In keeping with this theme while 
paying homage to its current sponsor, the nickname "The Juice Box" is colloquially 
used today. On April 21, Jeff Bagwell hit three home runs in a 10â€“3 win 
against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, his second career three-home 
run game. The second home run allowed him to surpass Jimmy Wynn as the 
Astros' all-time home run leader at 224 and he tied a career-high in one 
game with six runs batted in (RBI).[4] He produced another three-home run 
game on June 9 against the Chicago White Sox. He was also a grand slam 
short of hitting for the "home run cycle," with a solo home run, a three-run 
home run, and a two-run home run, respectively.[5] The two three-home run 
games made him the only player to accomplish this feat at two different 
stadiums in Chicago in the same season.[6] On August 20, Bagwell walked 
a major-league record six times in a 16-inning game against the Florida 
Marlins.[7][8] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played;
