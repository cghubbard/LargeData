Norristown is a borough (with home rule status) in and the county seat 
of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States.[1] Located along the 
Schuylkill River approximately six miles from the Philadelphia city limits, 
Norristown has a population of 34,324 as of the 2010 U.S. Census and is 
the 4th most populous municipality in the county.[2] The area where Norristown 
sits was originally owned by the family of Isaac Norris, who purchased 
the land from William Penn in 1704. Named the county seat in 1784 when 
Montgomery County was formed, Norristown was incorporated as a borough 
in 1812 and subsequently enlarged in 1853. About 500 people lived there 
at the time of its incorporation. Growing rapidly after the Civil War, 
it swelled to 22,265 people by 1900 and by 1940 it was home to 38,181 Norristonians, 
making it the most populous borough in Pennsylvania before declining in 
the decades after World War II. At its height, Norristown was an industrial, 
retail, banking, and government center. Breweries, cigar factories, textile 
mills, icehouses, foundries, rolling mills, and lumber yards provided ample 
employment for skilled laborers and artisans.[3] The downtown featured 
two department stores, several theaters, and enough goods and services 
that residents never had to leave town to find anything they needed.[4] 
Although primarily settled by the English and a handful of Germans, Scots, 
Dutch, and Swedes, in the mid-1800s the Irish began arriving in large numbers, 
followed by waves of Italians at the turn of the century.[5] With the opening 
of new malls in nearby King of Prussia and Plymouth Meeting, the downtown 
declined in the decades after World War II. Industry soon followed, as 
many companies closed or relocated into new industrial parks throughout 
Montgomery County.[6] Efforts to revitalize and reshape itself as a 21st-century 
community have produced minimal results. Norristown is located in southeastern 
Pennsylvania, approximately 6 miles (10 km) northwest of Philadelphia. 
Totaling 3.519 square miles in land area, the municipality sits along the 
Schuylkill River. Two major tributaries, the Stony Creek and the Saw Mill 
Run, bisect the town into thirds and empty directly into the Schuylkill. 
The town’s terrain is generally hilly, especially in the areas closest 
to downtown, which itself sits on a plateau surrounded by all three major 
waterways. Norristown has four distinct neighborhoods: the West End, the 
East End, the North End, and the downtown. It is bounded by West Norriton, 
East Norriton, and Plymouth Townships, as well as Bridgeport Borough. As 
of the 2010 census, Norristown's population is 34,324, which represents 
a 9.7% increase since 2000. The municipality's population was 40.9% White, 
35.9% Black or African American, 0.4% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.1% 
Native Hawaiian, and 4.6% were two or more races. 28.3% of the population 
were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry, which is almost triple the Hispanic 
population in 2000.[12] There were 11,963 households and 7,498 families 
residing in the municipality.[13] The population density was 9,753.9 people 
per square mile. There were 13,420 housing units at an average density 
of 3,813.5 per square mile.[14] Of the 11,963 households, 62.7% (7,498) 
were family households and 37.3% were non-family households. Of the 7,498 
families, 58.2% had their own and related children under the age of 18 
living with them; 51.0% were married couples living together, and 36.6% 
had a female householder with no husband present. The average household 
size was 2.79 and the average family size was 3.41.[15] The median age 
of all residents is 31.2 years, with an age distribution of 26.2% under 
the age of 18, 43.5% between ages 18 and 44, 21.2% between ages 45 and 
64, and 9.1% ages 65 and above.[16] According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 
2012 American Community Survey, the median household income was $42,764. 
Males had a median income of $34,214 versus $34,086 for females. The per 
capita income was $21,204. About 17.3% of families and 19.3% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 28.3% of those under the age of 
18 and 11.8% of those 65 and older.[15] Approximately 76.0% of all persons 
25 and older have a high school diploma or higher, while 16.7% have a college 
degree (Bachelor’s or higher).[17] Norristown’s economy is based largely 
on institutions in the government, healthcare, legal, and social services 
sectors. The Montgomery County government is the municipality’s largest 
employer.[18] Other major Norristown employers with a considerable presence 
are the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the 
Montgomery County Intermediate Unit, USM (formerly U.S. Maintenance), U.S. 
Roofing Corporation, BartonPartners Architects+Planners, Chandler Bats, 
and the Norristown Area School District. Norristown is home to the corporate 
headquarters of both USM and U.S. Roofing. In addition to major employers, 
there are numerous small professional, manufacturing, technology, and distribution 
firms operating in the municipality, as well as law offices and local realty 
companies. Norristown has been a home rule municipality since 1986 when 
voters adopted a charter with a manager/council form of government and 
a seven-member municipal council. The office of mayor was abolished in 
July 2004 after a public referendum amended the municipal charter. Executive 
and administrative authority is now delegated to a council appointed Municipal 
Manager. The municipality is part of the Thirteenth Congressional District 
(represented by Rep. Brendan Boyle), the 70th and 150th State House Districts 
(represented by Rep. Matt Bradford and Rep. Mike Vereb) and the 17th State 
Senate District (represented by Sen. Daylin Leach). Norristown sits at 
the junction of several major roads in the Philadelphia region. Main Street 
(also known as Ridge Pike outside of the municipality) and Airy Street 
run east-west through the downtown, eventually leading to interchanges 
for I-476 (the Blue Route) and the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276), respectively, 
in Plymouth Meeting. U.S. 202 is the major north-south route through the 
town, connecting it with other nearby county seats such as Doylestown and 
West Chester. U.S. 202 is split through the municipality, as DeKalb St. 
is designated “U.S. 202 North” while Markley St. is signed “U.S. 202 South.”[19][20] 
Norristown is the largest multi-modal transportation hub in Montgomery 
County. Numerous rail lines, bus routes, multi-use trails, and parking 
areas converge at the Norristown Transportation Center (NTC). The Southeastern 
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) operates eight bus routes 
(90, 91, 93, 96, 97, 98, 99, and 131), one light rail route (the Norristown 
High Speed Line), and a regional rail line (the Manayunk/Norristown Line) 
out of the NTC complex. The regional rail station at the Transportation 
Center is one of three on the Manayunk/Norristown line. The other two are 
Main Street and Elm Street. The NTC contains a 522-space SEPTA commuter 
parking garage that also contains an intercity bus terminal operated seven 
days a week by Bieber Tourways, Greyhound Lines, and Martz Trailways. Several 
taxi companies and private bus shuttles have a presence at the Transportation 
Center. The Schuylkill River Trail, which connects Philadelphia to Phoenixville 
and runs through downtown Norristown, also passes through the NTC complex. 
The Chester Valley Trail will also connect to the Transportation Center 
by the end of the 2010s. The Times Herald is the city's daily newspaper, 
printing seven days a week and serving most of Montgomery County. Founded 
on June 15, 1799, it is currently owned by 21st Century Media.[21] The 
paper's staff offices are located within the municipality. Despite the 
loss of its historic movie and vaudeville theaters, Norristown is home 
to two performing arts centers (the Montgomery County Cultural Center and 
Centre Theatre) and one professional theater company, Theatre Horizon. 
All are part of The Theatre Alliance of Greater Philadelphia and the Greater 
Philadelphia Cultural Alliance. These theaters form the nucleus for Norristown 
Arts Hill, a collection of theaters, art galleries, and professional firms 
on the 300-500 blocks of DeKalb Street in downtown. Norristown’s Main Street 
contains a wide variety of upscale ethnic restaurants providing Korean/Japanese, 
Mexican, Ethiopian, Vietnamese, and Italian food. Norristown has seen several 
new office buildings constructed or rehabbed over the last several decades. 
One Montgomery Plaza, the municipality’s iconic downtown 10-story office 
building, was built in the early 1970s, and is now owned by Montgomery 
County. Two newer mid-rise downtown office buildings, the Montgomery County 
Intermediate Unit Building and the Department of Environmental Protection 
Building, were built in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2009, the historic 
former Bell Telephone building was completely renovated for offices, and 
that same year the U.S. Roofing Corporation rehabbed the former Conte Luna 
pasta factory on East Main Street to house their operations. The former 
Sears building at the Studio Centre shopping center in the North End was 
renovated as a modern office center. Since the early 2000s, the Regatta 
Apartments, the Rittenhouse condominium building, and dozens of new townhouses 
have contributed to a residential boom in the East End. Two new downtown 
parking garages were built in the late 2000s, one at Main and Cherry Streets 
for visitors and another at SEPTA’s Norristown Transportation Center on 
Lafayette Street. Several large downtown and neighborhood streetscape projects 
were completed by the municipal government to install new street lighting, 
trees, curbing, and sidewalks along Main Street, DeKalb Street, and Powell 
Street. The Lafayette Street Extension Project, a $60 million effort now 
underway by Montgomery County, PennDOT, and the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA), will improve highway access and mobility into downtown Norristown 
by widening Lafayette Street and extending it eastward toward Ridge Pike 
and Conshohocken, with eventual connections to the Pennsylvania Turnpike
