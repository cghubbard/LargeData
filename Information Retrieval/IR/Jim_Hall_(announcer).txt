Jim Hall (born May 30, 1933 in New York, New York)[1] is the public address 
announcer for New York Giants football games at MetLife Stadium, located 
in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Hall served as spotter and understudy to 
legendary New York Yankees and Giants PA announcer Bob Sheppard from the 
opening of Giants Stadium in 1976 until the beginning of the 2006 season, 
when he replaced the retiring Sheppard as principal announcer. He still 
holds this position as of the 2015 season. Hall met Sheppard when he was 
in high school, as Sheppard would judge Hall in speech and debate events. 
Hall, like Sheppard, taught in high school and at St. Johnâ€™s University, 
where he became the chairman of the Department of Speech, Communication 
and Theater for twelve years out of a forty-five year tenure, before retiring 
in 2004.[2] Hall also served as Sheppard's understudy at Yankee Stadium, 
beginning in the mid-1960s. He replaced Sheppard for the 2007 post-season 
when Sheppard developed bronchitis, and again for the entire 2008 season. 
Paul Olden took over as the full-time Yankee Stadium announcer when the 
Yankees moved to their new ballpark in 2009.[3] Hall's voice is quite similar 
to Bob Sheppard's. When he filled in for Sheppard, visiting teams and media 
often did not know that Sheppard was not announcing. This was purposeful, 
as Hall has said Sheppard asked him to speak in his same style and cadence
