The 1980 Chicago White Sox season was the team's 80th season in Major League 
Baseball, and its 81st season overall. They finished with a record of 70-90, 
good enough for 5th place in the American League West, 26 games behind 
the first-place Kansas City Royals. In 1979 and 1980, Bill Veeck made overtures 
to Denver interests. An agreement was reached to sell to Edward J. DeBartolo, 
Sr., who pledged to keep the club in Chicago.[1] His offer was turned down 
by the owners. Veeck was forced to sell to a different investment group.[1] 
On October 4, 54-year-old Minnie Mi√±oso entered a game against the California 
Angels as a pinch hitter for third baseman Greg Pryor. In doing so, he 
became the first major leaguer since Nick Altrock to play in five different 
decades.[3] He grounded out against Angels pitcher Frank Tanana.[4] [1]
