As Player As Manager Tetsuharu Kawakami (川上 哲治, Kawakami Tetsuharu?, March 
23, 1920 – October 28, 2013) was a Japanese baseball player and manager, 
known for his red bat, and his nickname 打撃の神様 (dageki no kamisama,, "the 
God of Batting/Hitting"?). He was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1965. Born in Hitoyoshi, Kumamoto, he played for Kumamoto Tech 
(Kumamoto) in the 1937 Summer Kōshien. Kumamoto advanced to the championship 
game, but lost. After the game, Kawakami grabbed a handful of dirt from 
the playing field of Kōshien Stadium and put it in his uniform pocket as 
a memento. This became known as the original scooping of "the dirt of Kōshien" 
(甲子園の土 Kōshien no tsuchi?). Since then, as a memento of their fleeting 
time on the hallowed grounds of Kōshien, players from the losing teams 
take home a pouch of the precious soil. Kawakami played for Tokyo Kyojin/Yomiuri 
Giants between 1938 and 1958 (though he missed the years 1943–1945 when 
he served in the Japanese military). Kawakami signed with the Giants as 
a pitcher/first baseman, and actually pitched in 39 games between 1938 
and 1941, compiling 11 wins against 9 losses, with an excellent 2.61 ERA. 
He converted full-time to first base in 1942.[1] In 1951, he struck out 
only 6 times, which is the Japanese single-season tie record. In 1954, 
Kawakami hit the first cycle in Yomiuri Giants' franchise history. He was 
a professional player for 18 years, winning the batting title five times, 
two home run crowns, three RBI titles, and had six titles for the most 
hits in a season. He was the MVP of the 1953 Japan Series. He was the first 
player in Japanese pro baseball to achieve 2,000 hits and was named the 
league's MVP three times.[2] As manager of the Giants from 1961–1974, he 
was known for his ruthless, tough-love style, but he led the Yomiuri Giants 
to nine consecutive championships.[3][4] Tetsuharu Kawakami appeared in 
three films:[5] In addition, Kawakami is referred to by name in the baseball 
game scene from film director Akira Kurosawa's Stray Dog (1949); a.k.a.
