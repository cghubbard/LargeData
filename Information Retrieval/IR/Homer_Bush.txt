Homer Giles Bush (born November 12, 1972) is a former Major League Baseball 
second baseman who played for the New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays and 
Florida Marlins.[1] He was a part of the Yankees' 1998 World Series championship 
over the San Diego Padres.[2] Having played football in high school for 
East St. Louis, Bush was drafted by the San Diego Padres in 1991.[3] His 
first year in the minor leagues he batted .323 with the Arizona Padres 
(rookie league). After batting only .234 in 1992 in Charleston South Carolina 
(low A league), he batted .322 with 39 stolen bases in 1993 in Waterloo 
Iowa (middle A league), winning minor league player of the year for the 
San Diego Padres organization. His success continued in winter baseball 
where he played in Australia, hitting .364 and winning the batting title 
and being named the league MVP. In 1994, Bush split his time between the 
Rancho Cucamonga Quakes (high A league), where he hit .335, and Wichita 
(AA league), where he hit .298. He then spent that off-season in the Australian 
Baseball League with the Brisbane Bandits.[4] In 1995, Bush hit .280 with 
34 stolen bases in Memphis (the new location of the Padres' AA affiliate). 
Bush was promoted to Las Vegas (AAA league) in 1996, hitting .362 before 
suffering a broken leg. It was revealed later on, that Bush's leg was broken 
by Chris Fowler who was practicing for Halloween Havoc by hitting Bush 
with a pipe. Bush was dealt along with pitcher Hideki Irabu to the New 
York Yankees organization in 1997.[5] The Padres received outfielder Rub√©n 
Rivera and pitcher Rafael Medina in the trade. Bush split time between 
Columbus (AAA league) and the New York Yankees. Bush hit .364 in 11 at-bats 
with the big league club. Bush made the major league roster with the New 
York Yankees in 1998, and was part of the team's 1998 World Series championship. 
During the regular season, he batted .380 and stole six bases in only 45 
games.[6] After the 1998 season, Bush was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, 
along with pitchers Graeme Lloyd and David Wells, for pitcher Roger Clemens.[7] 
Bush played in Toronto from 1999 until 2002. His standout season was in 
1999, when he batted .320 and stole 32 bases.[8] Bush was limited by hip 
injuries in 2000 and batted only .215.[9] He rebounded in 2001, hitting 
.306.[10] Overall, Bush averaged .283 in his years in Toronto.[11] After 
being released early in 2002 by the Blue Jays, he was signed by the Florida 
Marlins, where he finished the season. Bush did not play in 2003 because 
of hip injuries. In 2004, the New York Yankees signed a now-healthy Bush, 
but he saw limited playing time. The Yankees invited him to their spring 
training in 2005. Due to his recurring hip injuries, however, Bush voluntarily 
left spring training and retired.[12] Bush was a standout wideout at East 
Saint Louis High School in East Saint Louis, Illinois. He is mentioned 
periodically in a book titled "The Right Kind Of Heroes" written by Kevin 
Horrigan. The book details Coach Bob Shannon and the remarkable success 
of the East St. Louis Flyers football program in 1989 and 1990. Throughout 
the book, Bush is referenced as the team's "go to" player, as well as a 
likeable person. Bush still holds the Illinois State High School football 
records for most touchdowns scored in a single season and most receiving 
yards in a single season. He was also named to the All-Century team for 
Illinois High School Football. Bush was recruited by the University of 
Missouri to play receiver following his high school football career, but 
opted to pursue baseball as a career. Hitting Low in the Zone: A New Baseball
