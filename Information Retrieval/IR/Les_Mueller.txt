Leslie Clyde Mueller (March 4, 1919 – October 25, 2012) was a right-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Detroit Tigers in 1941 
and 1945. He was born in Belleville, Illinois. In 1940, Mueller played 
for the Beaumont Exporters in the Texas League and threw a no-hitter on 
August 22, 1940 against Dallas. The following year, Mueller reached the 
big leagues, pitching four games for the Detroit Tigers. He enlisted in 
the Army after the United States entered World War II and missed the next

removed Mueller, the pitcher asked, "Gee, Steve, the game isn't over, is

World Series. Mueller was sent to the minors in 1946 and finished his career
