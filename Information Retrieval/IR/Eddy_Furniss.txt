Wilburn Edward "Eddy" Furniss III (born September 18, 1975) is an American 
retired professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter. A standout 
college baseball player for Louisiana State University (LSU), Furniss has 
been inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame, the LSU Athletic 
Hall of Fame, and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. With the LSU Tigers, 
Furniss was a two-time College World Series champion and a two-time All-American. 
He won the Dick Howser Trophy as college baseball's best player in 1998, 
and set Southeastern Conference (SEC) records in numerous offensive categories, 
including home runs and runs batted in (RBIs). He was among the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association's all-time leaders in home runs and RBIs 
at the time he graduated from college. Drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in 1998, Furniss played in their minor league system through 2000. He played 
for the Oakland Athletics organization in 2001 and the Texas Rangers organization 
in 2002. Unable to advance beyond Class AA, Furniss decided to retire from 
baseball and attend medical school. He graduated from the University of 
Texas Health Science Center at Houston and completed his residency at John 
Peter Smith Hospital. He practices family medicine in his native Nacogdoches, 
Texas. Furniss attended Nacogdoches High School in Nacogdoches, Texas, 
where he played for the school's baseball team. In his senior season, Furniss 
had a .430 batting average,[1] and was named to the All-State team.[2] 
He had no intention of playing college baseball, expecting to study medicine 
in college. Following the persistence of college coaches who tried to recruit 
him, Furniss agreed to continue his baseball career in college.[3] After 
graduating from high school in 1994, Furniss enrolled at Louisiana State 
University (LSU), where he played college baseball for the LSU Tigers baseball 
team in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) of the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association's (NCAA) Division I. Furniss batted .326 as a freshman with 
the LSU Tigers in 1995,[4] and was named to the All-Tournament Team in 
the 1995 SEC Baseball Tournament. As a sophomore, Furniss was named the 
SEC Player of the Year, as he batted .374 and hit 26 home runs with 103 
RBIs, the most in the nation. He was also named a first-team All American 
as a designated hitter, as the Tigers won the 1996 College World Series 
(CWS).[4] As a junior, Furniss batted .378 with 17 home runs and 77 RBIs.[5] 
The Tigers repeated, winning the 1997 CWS. The SEC presented Furniss with 
their Sportsmanship Award after the season.[6] Furniss sought to improve 
his physical shape for the 1998 season,[5] and after losing weight, Furniss 
batted .403 average in 1998 with 27 doubles, three triples, 28 home runs, 
85 runs scored, and 76 RBIs. He also set a career-high with 72 walks and 
a career-low in strikeouts with 40.[4] He earned first-team All-America 
and All-SEC honors,[4][7] and won the Dick Howser Trophy as the top collegiate 
baseball player.[8] He was also a semifinalist for the Golden Spikes Award, 
though the award was won by Pat Burrell.[9][10] Furniss had a .371 batting 
average in his four years at LSU, and set SEC career records for hits (349), 
doubles (87), home runs (80), runs batted in (309), and total bases (689). 
At the end of his career, he was among the NCAA's all-time leaders in various 
offensive categories, ranking third in total bases, fourth in home runs 
and doubles, and fifth in RBIs.[4] Selected in the 14th round of the 1997 
Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft by the Minnesota Twins, Furniss opted 
to return to LSU for his senior season, rather than sign for the signing 
bonus typically given to a player selected in that round.[11] After his 
senior season, Furniss was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the fourth 
round of the 1998 MLB Draft.[9] Furniss made his professional debut with 
the Augusta GreenJackets of the Class A South Atlantic League. After a 
strong showing with Augusta, batting 40-for-86 (.465) with seven doubles, 
nine home runs, 31 RBIs and 32 runs scored in 24 games, the Pirates promoted 
Furniss to the Carolina Mudcats of the Class AA Southern League in mid-July, 
bypassing the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League.[12] 
Furniss struggled in Carolina, and the Pirates demoted Furniss to Lynchburg 
on August 4.[13] He batted .193 in 36 games with Lynchburg to close the 
season.[14] The Pirates assigned Furniss to Lynchburg in 1999, where he 
batted .261 with 23 home runs and 87 RBIs, and was honored as the Carolina 
League's All-Star first baseman.[3] He also set a Hillcats franchise record 
for walks with 94.[15] The Pirates sent Furniss to play in the Arizona 
Fall League after the 1999 regular season.[16] He played for the Altoona 
Curve of the Class AA Eastern League, the Pirates' new Class AA affiliate, 
in 2000,[17] where he batted .239 in 121 games played.[18] Signed as a 
free agent by the Oakland Athletics organization after the season, Furniss 
started the 2001 season with the Midland RockHounds of the Class AA Texas 
League, but was demoted to the Visalia Oaks of the Class A-Advanced California 
League in April.[19] The Athletics promoted him back to Midland later in 
the season.[20] Joining the Texas Rangers organization for the 2002 season, 
he played for the Tulsa Drillers, also in the Texas League, where he played 
in 26 games and batted .143.[21] In honor of his LSU career, Furniss has 
been inducted into three halls of fame; the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 
2007,[22] the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010,[23] and the Louisiana 
Sports Hall of Fame in 2012. During his 2012 induction speech, Furniss 
quoted the character based on Moonlight Graham from Field of Dreams. Graham 
played in one MLB game before he retired to practice medicine.[4] On April 
22, 2016 the LSU baseball team retired Furniss' No. 36 jersey.[24] "When 
I was in high school I always planned to be a doctor and come back to Nacogdoches. 
The baseball was an accidental success, something I happened to be good 
at and so my plan was I'd do it as long as possible. I could always go 
back to being a doctor." Furniss graduated LSU with an academic major in 
zoology on a pre-medical track, and grade point averages above 3.5 in each 
of his last three years. He took his laboratory courses during the fall 
semester, so they did not distract from the baseball season in the spring 
semester.[4] After the 2002 season, Furniss retired from baseball, as he 
promised himself he would if he found himself unable to advance beyond 
Class AA.[3] He enrolled in medical school at University of Texas Health 
Science Center at Houston,[4] and completed his residency at John Peter 
Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas.[3] Furniss practices in the Nacogdoches 
Medical Center, the same building where his father practices.[3][4] Furniss 
was raised in Nacogdoches, Texas, on a 36-acre (15Â ha) ranch. His father, 
a medical doctor who practices family medicine, built Eddy a batting cage 
so that he could take 200 to 300 practice swings a day as a child.[2] Furniss 
married his high school girlfriend, Crystal, with whom he has two sons
