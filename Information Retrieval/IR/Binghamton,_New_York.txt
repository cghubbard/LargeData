Binghamton /ˈbɪŋəmtən/ is a city in, and the county seat of, Broome County, 
New York, United States.[5] It lies in the state's Southern Tier region 
near the Pennsylvania border, in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence 
of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers.[6] Binghamton is the principal 
city and cultural center of the Binghamton metropolitan area (also known 
as Greater Binghamton, or historically the Triple Cities), home to a quarter 
million people.[2] The population of the city itself, according to the 
2010 census, is 47,376.[4] From the days of the railroad, Binghamton was 
a transportation crossroads and a manufacturing center, and has been known 
at different times for the production of cigars, shoes, and computers.[7] 
IBM was founded nearby, and the flight simulator was invented in the city, 
leading to a notable concentration of electronics- and defense-oriented 
firms. This sustained economic prosperity earned Binghamton the moniker 
of the Valley of Opportunity.[8] However, following cuts made by defense 
firms after the end of the Cold War, the region has lost a significant 
portion of its manufacturing industry.[9] Today, while there is a continued 
concentration of high-tech firms, Binghamton is emerging as a healthcare- 
and education-focused city, with the presence of Binghamton University 
acting as much of the driving force behind this revitalization.[10] The 
first known people of European descent to come to the area were the troops 
of the Sullivan Expedition in 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, 
who destroyed local villages of the Onondaga and Oneida tribes.[8] The 
city was named after William Bingham, a wealthy Philadelphian who bought 
the 10,000 acre patent for the land in 1786, then consisting of portions 
of the towns of Union and Chenango.[8][11] Joshua Whitney, Jr., Bingham's 
land agent, chose land at the junction of the Chenango and Susquehanna 
Rivers to develop a settlement, then named Chenango Point, and helped build 
its roads and erect the first bridge.[8][12] Significant agricultural growth 
led to the incorporation of the village of Binghamton in 1834.[7][8] The 
Chenango Canal, completed in 1837, connected Binghamton to the Erie Canal, 
and was the impetus for the initial industrial development of the area.[13] 
This growth accelerated with the completion of the Erie Railroad between 
Binghamton and New York City in 1849.[14] With the Delaware, Lackawanna, 
and Western Railroad arriving soon after, the village became an important 
regional transportation center.[8][15] Several buildings of importance 
were built at this time, including the New York State Inebriate Asylum, 
opened in 1858 as the first center in the United States to treat alcoholism 
as a disease.[16] Binghamton incorporated as a city in 1867, and due to 
the presence of several stately homes, was nicknamed the Parlor City.[7] 
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many immigrants moved to the 
area, finding an abundance of jobs. During the 1880s, Binghamton grew to 
become the second-largest manufacturer of cigars in the United States.[8] 
However, by the early 1920s, the major employer of the region became Endicott 
Johnson, a shoe manufacturer whose development of welfare capitalism resulted 
in many amenities for local residents.[17] An even larger influx of Europeans 
immigrated to Binghamton, and the working class prosperity resulted in 
the area being called the Valley of Opportunity.[8][17] In 1913, 31 people 
perished in the Binghamton Clothing Company fire, which resulted in numerous 
reforms to the New York fire code.[18][19] Major floods in 1935 and 1936 
resulted in a number of deaths, and washed out the Ferry Street Bridge 
(now the Clinton Street Bridge). The floods were devastating, and resulted 
in the construction of flood walls along the length of the Susquehanna 
and Chenango Rivers.[8][20] During the Second World War, growth and corporate 
generosity continued as IBM, which was founded in Greater Binghamton, emerged 
as a global technology leader.[21] Along with Edwin Link's invention of 
the flight simulator in Binghamton, IBM transitioned the region to a high-tech 
economy. Other major manufacturers included Ansco and General Electric.[7] 
Until the Cold War ended, the area never experienced an economic downfall, 
due in part to its defense-oriented industries.[8] The population of the 
city of Binghamton peaked at around 85,000 in the mid-1950s.[22] Post-war 
suburban development led to a decline in the city population, as the towns 
of Vestal and Union experienced rapid growth.[8] As seen in many other 
Rust Belt cities, traditional manufacturers saw steep declines, though 
Binghamton's technology industry limited this impact. In an effort to reverse 
these trends, urban renewal dominated much of the construction during the 
1960s and early 1970s, with many ornate city buildings torn down during 
this period.[8] The construction included the creation of Government Plaza, 
the Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena, and North Shore Dr. (NY 363).[23][24][25] 
As was typical of urban renewal, these projects ultimately failed to stem 
most of the losses, though they did establish Binghamton as the government 
and cultural center of the region.[8] The city's population declined from 
approximately 64,000 in 1969 to 56,000 by the early 1980s.[26] As the Cold 
War came to a close in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 
defense-related industries in Greater Binghamton began to falter, resulting 
in several closures and widespread layoffs[1] These were most notable at 
IBM, which sold its Federal Systems division and laid off several thousands 
of workers.[9] The local economy went into a deep recession, and the long-prevalent 
manufacturing jobs dropped by 64% from 1990 to 2013.[27] A mass shooting 
took place on April 3, 2009, at the American Civic Association, leaving 
14 dead, including the gunman.[28] In the 21st century, the city has attempted 
to diversify its economic base in order to spur revitalization. The local 
economy has slowly transitioned towards a focus on services and healthcare.[10] 
Major emphasis has been placed on Binghamton University, which built a 
downtown campus in 2007,[29] and several student housing complexes have 
been created downtown.[30] Further student housing projects are planned, 
and the increased downtown residential population has spurred development 
of supporting businesses, along with a renewed focus on the riverfront.[31] 
Unfortunately, the recovery has been stymied by two severe floods. While 
the majority of the impact of the Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006 
was in the surrounding metropolitan area, the remnants of Tropical Storm 
Lee topped city flood walls in September 2011, causing $1 billion of damage 
in Greater Binghamton.[32] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 11.14 square miles (28.9 km2). 10.49 square 
miles (27.2 km2) of it is land and 0.65 square miles (1.7 km2) of it (5.83%) 
is water.[2] Binghamton is located at the confluence of two rivers, in 
the middle of a long but relatively narrow valley.[6] The north branch 
of the Susquehanna River passes south of downtown. This branch rises in 
eastern New York and receives a number of tributaries above Binghamton. 
In the center of the city, the Chenango River feeds into the Susquehanna 
from the north. As a result, eleven bridges span the rivers inside city 
limits. Major floods have occurred in 1865, 1935, 1936, 2006, and 2011.[8][33][34] 
The incorporation of Binghamton united various communities located on both 
shores of the two rivers. The majority of the city's population and development 
lies along the rolling terrain nearest the riverbanks with sparse development 
in the hills that define the city limits. The old city was laid out on 
a grid system by Joshua Whitney, Jr.,[8] but as development spread to the 
outer regions of the city and merged with other settlements, several grids 
were eventually juxtaposed against each other. In the Southside, the grid 
breaks down, as more curvilinear roads make up the predominantly residential 
areas along the hills. The city was the traditional economic center of 
the region, and contains several historic districts. The Railroad Terminal 
Historic District consists of several factories and buildings along the 
railroad line in the northern limits of downtown.[35] Over 1,000 properties 
on the West Side contribute to the Abel Bennett Tract Historic District, 
mainly made up of residential properties along Riverside Drive.[36] The 
State Street-Henry Street Historic District in downtown consists of several 
older low-rise buildings.[37] The Court Street Historic District contains 
some of the most notable architecture in the city, including the Press 
Building and Security Mutual Building, early 20th century high rises, and 
the Broome County Courthouse.[38] The Press Building was the tallest building 
in Binghamton until the completion of the State Office Building in Government 
Plaza, which remains the tallest in the city.[39] Away from downtown, the 
majority of the buildings are single- and multi-family dwellings, along 
with low-rise business buildings lining commercial arteries. Along the 
railroad corridors, a number of factories, mostly abandoned, rise above 
the otherwise-uniform landscape. Main Street runs through the West Side, 
and continues west to serve as Main Street in the villages of Johnson City 
and Endicott. On the east side of the Chenango River, the road becomes 
Court Street, the major east-west artery in downtown and the East Side. 
Binghamton is divided into seven neighborhoods.[40][41][42] Downtown Binghamton, 
also known as Center City, is home to most of the city's largest buildings, 
and is home to government services. Located at the northeast corner of 
the river confluence, downtown is increasingly being populated by college 
students, and supports a flourishing arts scene.[31][43] The North Side 
is across the Norfolk Southern rail tracks from downtown, lying along the 
Chenango River.[44] The North Side is a light commercial and working-class 
residential section of the city, with Chenango Street serving as its major 
artery. The East Side lies east of the Brandywine Highway, along the north 
bank of the Susquehanna River. The neighborhood is largely residential 
with commercial corridors along both Robinson and Court streets, and contains 
pockets of industrial development along its borders. Across the Chenango 
River lies the West Side, a primarily residential neighborhood along the 
banks of the Susquehanna, containing a combination of family homes, student 
housing, and stately mansions. Main Street forms the West Side's commercial 
corridor, made up of several large supermarkets, pharmacies, bank branches, 
pubs, restaurants, auto shops, and a few strip malls.[45] The First Ward 
is a largely residential neighborhood opposite the railroad tracks from 
the West Side, but is best known for Antique Row, a series of antique shops 
that line Clinton Street. Several gold-domed ethnic churches are located 
in this part of the city, as a result of settlement in the area by a large 
number of Eastern European immigrants.[46] Ely Park is Binghamton's northernmost 
neighborhood, and contains its municipal golf course.[47] It lies on portions 
of Prospect Mountain and other hills north of the First Ward. The Southside 
lies along the south bank of the Susquehanna River, connected to downtown 
by several bridges. At the base of the historic South Washington Street 
Bridge is the Southbridge commercial district.[48] The neighborhood is 
partitioned into two separate neighborhood assemblies, divided by Pennsylvania 
Avenue and Southbridge, due to their distinct characters.[40] Southside 
East contains working-class residences and some public housing projects, 
while Southside West is primarily made up of larger middle-class residences. 
Binghamton has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb), with cold, snowy 
winters and warm, wet summers.[49] Summers in Binghamton are typified by 
warm yet temperate days, and there are an average of only 2.6 days annually 
where the high exceeds 90 °F (32 °C), with the highest recorded temperature 
at 98 °F (37 °C) on July 16, 1988.[50] Winters are somewhat less moderate, 
with 5.8 days with sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows annually on average; the lowest 
temperature ever recorded was −20 °F (−29 °C) on January 15, 1957.[50] 
As with most cities in upstate New York, precipitation in Binghamton is 
spread evenly throughout the year, and as such there is no dry season.[49][50] 
Binghamton is the 10th rainiest city in the United States, with 162 rainy 
days a year.[51] With 212 cloudy days annually, it is also the seventh 
cloudiest city in the country, and the cloudiest east of the Rocky Mountains.[52] 
Binghamton's proximity to the Great Lakes results in significant cloudiness 
and precipitation, as weather systems traveling over the lake pick up significant 
moisture, and cooler air masses from the west and the north culminate in 
a continuously unsettled weather pattern.[51][53][54] Snowfall is significant, 
with an annual total of 84.4 inches (214 cm). Binghamton is not as greatly 
affected by lake-effect snow as cities further north or west such as Syracuse 
and Buffalo, which are part of the Great Lakes snowbelt.[55] However, persistent 
snow bands from both the Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes do occasionally 
result in moderate snows.[54] Binghamton receives occasional major snowfall 
from nor'easter storms as well (such as the 1993 Storm of the Century), 
and competes for the Golden Snowball Award with other upstate cities.[55] 
As of the census[2] of 2010, there were 47,376 people, 21,150 households, 
and 9,986 families residing in the city. The population density was 4,516.8 
per square mile (1,743.9/km²). There were 23,842 housing units at an average 
density of 2,273.1 per square mile (877.6/km²). Of all households, 20.8% 
had children under the age of 18 living with them, 26.9% were married couples 
living together, 15.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 
4.7% had a male householder with no wife present, and 52.8% were non-families. 
40.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 25.5% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.18 and the average family size was 2.94. Binghamton is home to a 
large ethnic population. During its industrial heyday, thousands of European 
immigrants moved to the city as they found an abundance of jobs and working-class 
prosperity. A large number of Irish, Italians, and Eastern Europeans settled 
in the area, and the American Civic Association was created to help their 
transition to life and assimilation in the United States.[8][46] This inrush 
led to a temporary rise in the local Ku Klux Klan during the 1920s, with 
Binghamton serving as state headquarters. Area residents, who primarily 
embraced the different cultural heritages, quelled such anti-immigrant 
sentiment by founding several ethnic organizations and holding ethnic celebrations, 
at the encouragement of Endicott-Johnson.[17][61] This has had a lasting 
effect on the city, which sports a large number of churches and contemporary 
ethnic festivals, along with a population that is still predominantly white 
(though steadily decreasing in proportion). As of 2010, the racial makeup 
of Binghamton was 77.6% White, 11.4% Black or African American, 0.3% Native 
American, 4.2% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 2.0% from other races, and 
4.4% from two or more races. 6.4% of the population were Hispanic or Latino 
of any race. Due to its ethnic diversity, there are a large number of religious 
affiliations within the region. The First Ward was historically home to 
much of the Eastern European population, and houses several gold dome Orthodox 
churches.[46] As a result of its strong Italian and Irish heritage, the 
largest religious body in Broome County is the Catholic Church.[62] Binghamton 
falls under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse. Throughout the county, 
105,064 people, or 52.4% of the total population, are listed as congregational 
adherents.[62] Until the mid-1950s, Binghamton saw its population grow 
rapidly due to its industrial boom, and was one of the largest 100 cities 
in the United States between 1890 and 1910.[8][22][63] Since 1950, the 
city has experienced sustained population loss, some of which was the result 
of suburbanization.[60] Much of the recent population loss has occurred 
throughout the region, and is skewed towards the younger population, resulting 
in the growth of the relative proportion of the elderly in Broome County.[64] 
In the city, the population was spread out with 19.9% under the age of 
18, 15.0% from 18 to 24, 24.7% from 25 to 44, 25.0% from 45 to 64, and 
15.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.2 years. 
For every 100 females, there were 96.1 males. For every 100 females age 
18 and over, there were 87.8 males. The Binghamton metropolitan area is 
home to 251,725 people. The MSA is composed of all of Broome County and 
neighboring Tioga County. The urban area, which includes portions of Susquehanna 
County, Pennsylvania, has a population of 158,054.[4] Alternatively defined, 
the number of people living in an approximately 30-mile radius of the city 
center is 316,270.[65] This count includes Broome County and portions of 
Tioga, Cortland, Delaware, Chenango, and Tompkins Counties in New York, 
and parts of Susquehanna, Bradford, and Wayne Counties in Pennsylvania. 
The median income for a household in the city was $30,978, and the median 
income for a family was $43,436. Males had a median full-time income of 
$40,170 versus $35,060 for females. The per capita income for the city 
was $20,576. About 23.6% of families and 33.3% of the population were below 
the poverty line, including 47.3% of those under age 18 and 14.9% of those 
age 65 or over. After the boom of the cigar industry in the 1880s,[8] the 
Binghamton area became increasingly reliant on large manufactures, with 
both Endicott Johnson, a shoe manufacturer, and IBM employing 15,000 to 
20,000 local workers at their peak.[8][17] Other companies with a significant 
historical presence included Link Aviation Devices, Ansco, and General 
Electric.[7] Several other notable businesses started in Binghamton, such 
as Valvoline,[66] the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company (which merged to 
form Whirlpool),[67] and Dr. Kilmer's Swamp Root, a famous patent medicine.[68] 
Dick's Sporting Goods started out as a fishing store in the East Side in 
1948, and remained headquartered in Binghamton until 1994.[69] Much of 
Binghamton's current employment base is still oriented towards technology 
and defense manufacturing, though the sector has been diminishing since 
1990.[9][10] Areas of specialization include systems integration, flight 
simulation, and printed circuit board manufacturing. The largest such companies 
in the area are Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, IBM, Sanmina-SCI, and Universal 
Instruments.[70] Other notable technology firms include Endicott Interconnect, 
Rockwell Collins, Emerson Network Power, and L-3 Communications, which 
absorbed the Link Aviation operations. Although not a large employer, the 
McIntosh Laboratory is a well-known[71][72] high-end manufacturer of audio 
amplifiers, receivers, and other components.[73] Despite the sustained 
job losses, 13% of New York State's computer and electronics manufacturing 
jobs are in the Binghamton MSA as of 2010.[70] Education and health care 
are also becoming significant sectors in the regional economy.[10] In particular, 
Binghamton University and Broome Community College employ a large number 
of researchers and educators. Binghamton University contains a New York 
State Center of Excellence for small-scale systems integration, and has 
also provided the major impetus behind the $22 million Southern Tier High 
Technology Incubator, which is being built in downtown Binghamton to encourage 
local growth of startups.[74] Upstate Medical University has been working 
on expanding the presence of its clinical campus by establishing a permanent 
home at the former New York State Inebriate Asylum on the East Side.[75] 
Major companies in the private healthcare industry include United Health 
Services and Lourdes Hospital.[70] There is also a large presence of food 
services and distribution companies in Binghamton. Both Maines Paper & 
Food Service and Willow Run Foods are headquartered in the region, and 
are two of the largest food distributors in the country, servicing a large 
region of restaurants and chains throughout the United States.[76][77] 
Maines is one of the largest private companies in the country.[76] Crowley 
Foods, a subsidiary of HP Hood, maintains headquarters in Binghamton,[78] 
and Frito-Lay has a large plant in the region.[70] Agriculture has long 
played a notable role in the regional economy, and the farm bureau movement 
started in Binghamton in 1911.[79] Other notable local employers include 
New York State Electric & Gas and Johnson Outdoors.[70] Two insurance companies, 
Security Mutual Life and Columbian Financial Group, maintain headquarters 
in the area.[80][81] Several large shopping areas exist within the region. 
Downtown Binghamton is home to a Boscov's department store,[82] and the 
development of large student housing projects has resulted in a resurgence 
of restaurants and service-oriented business downtown.[31] Previously, 
downtown was also home to several major department stores, and was the 
center of regional shopping.[8] Most shopping, however, has now shifted 
away from the traditional downtown area towards the suburbs. The town of 
Vestal has several shopping centers and big-box stores along a five-mile 
stretch of the Vestal Parkway.[83] The village of Johnson City is home 
to the Oakdale Mall, the only indoor super regional mall in the area.[84] 
Significant commercial development has also taken place in the town of 
Dickinson, with numerous shopping centers just north of the city. In the 
First Ward, Clinton Street is home to Antique Row, a collection of antique 
shops.[83] The public Binghamton City School District has 5,668 students 
enrolled, and is the largest school district in the metropolitan area.[85] 
The district consists of Binghamton High School, two middle schools, and 
seven elementary schools.[86] While the district maintains an International 
Baccalaureate program and has received several academic awards,[87] it 
is classified as high needs, and has had difficulty meeting several educational 
requirements.[85] The Catholic Schools of Broome County, a private district 
run by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse, operate Seton Catholic Central 
High School and an elementary school in the city of Binghamton.[88] The 
city of Binghamton is home to four satellite campuses: The suburb of Vestal 
is home to the main campus Binghamton University. The university is one 
of four university centers in the SUNY system, and is home to approximately 
15,000 students.[92] Binghamton University is a selective[93] top-ranking 
public university,[94] and is considered to be a Public Ivy.[95] The university 
also has a significant research presence, including a New York State Center 
of Excellence for small-scale systems integration. While the campus is 
in Vestal, many students living off-campus find housing in the West Side. 
There has also been a recent push for student housing downtown, intended 
to be a major driver in the revitalization of the business district.[96] 
In addition to its downtown campus, the university is also leading the 
development and construction of the $22 million Southern Tier High Technology 
Incubator in the city.[74] SUNY Broome (formerly Broome Community College) 
is located just north of the city in Dickinson. A two-year SUNY college, 
the school is attended by 6,000 commuter students.[97] Formerly specializing 
in technical education, SUNY Broome started in downtown Binghamton, and 
was housed at the Washington Street Armory until a fire in 1951.[98] The 
college is currently constructing dormitories on campus to expand beyond 
its commuter population.[99] SUNY Broome also offers courses at several 
off-campus locations, including in the city of Binghamton at the Binghamton 
University Downtown Center.[100] The college is also looking to acquire 
and renovate the former Carnegie Library, with the goal of creating a permanent 
downtown campus that will specialize in new career-oriented programs.[101][102] 
Davis College (formerly Practical Bible College), a Bible college, in also 
nearby, in the village of Johnson City. The Elmira Business Institute also 
has a Vestal campus. The region has, in the last several years, developed 
a growing and pervasive arts scene. These include a large cluster of art 
galleries[103] and shops centered around downtown Binghamton. These galleries 
have given rise to the First Friday Art Walk, through the efforts an association 
of local artists and merchants in Downtown Binghamton.[104] These events 
have been drawing large crowds downtown since 2004. Artists of local prominence 
that display or have galleries include photorealist painter Anthony Brunelli, 
Orazio Salati, and Marla Olmstead, a local child who achieved fame in the 
art world for her abstract art.[105][106][107] The Binghamton Philharmonic 
is the region's premiere professional orchestra.[108] Founded in 1955, 
the Philharmonic provides symphonic music to all of the Southern Tier.[109] 
Concerts are performed throughout the year, with a variety of classical, 
pops and chamber music.[110] The Tri-Cities Opera stages full-scale operas 
at the Broome County Forum. The professional company has performed since 
1949, and is famed for its actor training program.[111] Several other semi-professional 
and amateur orchestras and theaters exist in the region, such as the Cider 
Mill Playhouse.[108] The Roberson Museum and Science Center, at the heart 
of Binghamton, is home to the Binghamton Visitor's Center, the Link Planetarium, 
and a number of exhibits detailing the culture and history of Greater Binghamton 
and the Southern Tier.[108][112] The Kopernik Observatory & Science Center 
observatory is the largest public observatory in the northeast United States.[113] 
The Binghamton Zoo at Ross Park, in the Southside, opened in 1875, and 
is the fifth oldest zoo in the nation.[114] Binghamton is known as the 
Carousel Capital of the World, as it houses six of the remaining antique 
carousels. Two of these are within city limits, one at Recreation Park 
and another at the Binghamton Zoo at Ross Park.[115] Other visitor attractions 
include the Phelps Mansion museum, the Cutler Botanic Garden, the Bundy 
Museum of History and Art, and the interactive, child-oriented Discovery 
Center.[113] The Center for Technology & Innovation, a museum dedicated 
to local industry, is currently under construction.[116][117] The area 
is the home of the regional dish known as the spiedie. It is very popular 
locally, and numerous restaurants in the area serve spiedies, but they 
have only experienced limited penetration beyond the Southern Tier and 
Central New York.[118] Spiedies are celebrated at the Spiedie Fest and 
Balloon Rally, which is held at Otsiningo Park every August and attracts 
over 100,000 people annually.[119] Other annual events held in the city 
include the St. Patrick's Day parade in March,[120] July Fest (a festival 
of jazz music, arts, and crafts held downtown since 1962),[121] the 100-year-old 
St. Mary of the Assumption Bazaar in August,[122] Blues on the Bridge (a 
September music festival that takes place on the South Washington Street 
Bridge),[123] and the Columbus Day Parade and Italian Festival every October, 
which includes a marching band competition.[124] Broome County is home 
to several festivals (including a significant concentration of ethnic celebrations 
due to its heritage), which in 2001 were recognized by the New York Department 
of Economic Development as the year's official I Love New York festival, 
and collectively dubbed the "Festival of Festivals."[125] Notable former 
festivities include the Yegatta Regatta and the Pops on the River concert.[126] 
Residents of Binghamton typically speak the Inland Northern dialect of 
American English, and the region falls within a distinct set of isoglosses 
that also contain Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse.[127] Much of the local 
accent has been subject to the Northern cities vowel shift, though this 
has not fully taken hold.[128] Unlike other Inland Northern cities, people 
in Binghamton typically refer to athletic shoes as sneakers (as opposed 
to tennis shoes), and to soft drinks as soda (and not pop).[129] The area 
is home to the Eastern League's Binghamton Rumble Ponies (AA affiliate 
of the New York Mets). The former B-Mets have sent stars like José Reyes, 
David Wright, Preston Wilson, Ike Davis, Zack Wheeler, Edgardo Alfonzo, 
Jon Niese, and Jay Payton to the majors. Binghamton has a long history 
in professional Organized Baseball dating back to 1877. Teams nicknamed 
the Crickets, the Bingoes, and for many years the Triplets represented 
Binghamton in the New York State League (now defunct), the New York-Pennsylvania 
League, the International League and the Eastern League (1892–94, 1938–1963, 
1967–1968, 1992–present). The 1887 Binghamton Bingoes of the International 
League attracted national attention when the white players revolted against 
the two black players on the team. The reaction around the league forced 
Binghamton to release the black players, and the team itself folded shortly 
thereafter. The Binghamton Triplets of the Eastern League, founded in 1923, 
became a farm club of the New York Yankees in 1932, and sent many players 
to New York through 1968, when the team folded. Notably, the Hall of Fame 
pitcher Whitey Ford was a starting pitcher for the Triplets in 1949. Binghamton 
is also home to two semi-pro American football teams, the Broome County 
Dragons (members of the Empire Football League) and the Southern Tier Green 
Machine (members of the North American Football League). In addition, two 
women's football teams call Binghamton home; the Binghamton Tiger Cats 
(members of the Independent Women's Football League) and the Southern Tier 
Spitfire (members of the Women's Football Alliance). Of the 4 teams only 
the Binghamton Tiger Cats still survive for 2012. The B.C. Open was an 
official PGA Tour event that was held annually from 1971 to 2005 at Endicott's 
En-Joie Golf Course. (Note that the 2006 B.C. Open had to be played in 
Verona, N.Y. due to extensive damage during the June 2006 Flooding of the 
Susquehanna River.) Beginning in 2007, the area hosted a PGA Champion's 
Tour event, the Dick's Sporting Goods Open. The event replaced the B.C. 
Open and continues to be played at En-Joie Golf Course in Endicott. Professional 
hockey arrived in Binghamton in 1973 with the founding of the Broome Dusters 
of the North American Hockey League. The Dusters were popular from the 
start with a wide open style of play which was unusual in professional 
hockey at the time. When the league folded in 1977, the Providence team 
of the American Hockey League moved to Binghamton and became the Binghamton 
Dusters. The team became the Binghamton Whalers from 1980 to 1990 and the 
Binghamton Rangers from 1990 to 1997 as a result of affiliations with the 
NHL Hartford Whalers and New York Rangers. The team is now the Binghamton 
Senators who currently serve as the AHL affiliate of the Ottawa Senators. 
The B-Sens won division titles on 2003 and 2005, reaching the AHL conference 
finals in 2003 and winning the Calder Cup in 2011. They play their home 
games at Floyd L. Maines Veterans Memorial Arena. The B-Sens have sent 
stars like Jason Spezza, Robin Lehner, Chris Kelly, Jakob Silfverberg and 
Jean-Gabriel Pageau to the NHL. The area is also home to an annual Professional 
Tennis Challenger, the Levene Gouldin & Thompson Tennis Challenger, part 
of the USTA pro circuit (Known as the Frito-Lay Tennis Challenger in years 
past). Tennis greats such as Lleyton Hewitt, James Blake and more recently 
Andy Murray found their start with this tournament, using it as a spring 
board to the U.S. Open (tennis).[130] Binghamton University plays Division 
I college sports as a member of the America East Conference. Division III 
College Sports are played at Broome Community College. Bobby Gonzalez, 
former head coach of Seton Hall's men's basketball team was born here, 
and still has family in the area. King Rice, head basketball coach at Monmouth 
University, attended Binghamton High School.[131] Two world-famous amateur 
sports tournaments are held in Binghamton. The Stop DWI Holiday Classic 
– a nationally recognized high school basketball tournament – calls the 
city home during the Christmas season, amassing about 16 of the nations 
best teams from places such as Orlando, NYC, Philadelphia, Kentucky, Cincinnati, 
and other large metropolitan areas. The World Youth Classic is an American 
Legion youth baseball tournament featuring world-class Legion baseball 
teams. Held in July, it features teams from Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, New 
York, Georgia, and New England. As many as 32 teams may play per year. 
Since 1978 a round of the American Motorcyclist Association's Motocross 
Championship has been held at the nearby Broome-Tioga Sports Center. This 
round of the series has recently been moved to Texas and is no longer hosted 
by the Broome-Tioga Sports Center. They also host the New York State Motocross 
Championships each fall and many other semi-pro events throughout the season. 
Binghamton is known for its bicycling and walking clubs, facilities, and 
trails. The Binghamton River Trail is an urban trail starting at Confluence 
Park, where the rivers intersect, and traveling alongside the Chenango 
River, past the Martin Luther King, Jr. Promenade and Noyes Island, up 
to Cheri A. Lindsey Park in the North Side. In 2007, Binghamton was named 
the ninth-greenest city in the U.S. by Country Home magazine.[132] Since 
its incorporation as a city in 1867, Binghamton has been a municipality 
with a "strong" mayor-council form of government. The city government, 
originally housed in the old Municipal Building on Collier Street (now 
the Grand Royale Hotel), is now based at the Binghamton City Hall which 
occupies the west-wing of Government Plaza on the corner of State and Hawley 
streets. The mayor and councilors are elected to four-year terms and are 
limited to serving only two. The Binghamton City Council is a unicameral 
body consisting of seven Council members whose districts are defined by 
geographic population boundaries. The current mayor of Binghamton is Richard 
C. David (R). The mayor oversees the following city departments:[133] The 
current 7-member City Council comprises: The Binghamton City Council meets 
for Work Sessions on the first and third Monday of the month at 6:00 PM 
in the Council Work Room. Council holds Business Meetings every first and 
third Wednesday after the first Monday of the month at 6:30 PM in Council 
Chambers.[135] The Binghamton Neighborhood Assemblies Program created seven 
public forum assemblies in which city residents play a lead role in "restoring 
the pride" in Binghamton by sharing their concerns, hopes and needs and 
then working in conjunction with city government and community partners 
to implement positive change. The initiative was a collaboration between 
City of Binghamton, Citizen Action of NY, and the Women's Studies Program 
at Binghamton University. The assemblies were supported from 2006 through 
2009 by the a team of seven to nine America-Corps*VISTA volunteers, who 
worked with residents on media training, beautification projects, youth 
initiatives, and organizing efforts. The assemblies were an effective way 
to re-connect citizens with City Hall, however, by the end of Mayor Ryan's 
first term, only two assemblies remained very active. The City no longer 
offers direct support to the assemblies, but the South Side and North Side 
Assemblies continue to meet monthly, driven largely by resident leaders. 
Public safety in Binghamton is the primary responsibility of the 124-officer 
Binghamton Police Department[136] and the 119-firefighter Binghamton Fire 
Department.[137] The Binghamton Fire Department is composed of 119 paid 
uniformed firefighters, EMTs and paramedics. In 2008, the City of Binghamton 
enacted Local Law 08-1, the Binghamton Human Rights Law, which expands 
protections offered at the state and federal government to include prohibitions 
against discrimination based on gender identity or expression, height and 
weight in employment, housing, education and public accommodation. In 2011, 
under the authority of N.Y. General Municipal Law 239-O and by City of 
Binghamton Local Law 11-3, the City of Binghamton established the Binghamton 
Human Rights Commission whose mission is to condemn discrimination in all 
its forms, to educate the public, and to work to eliminate discrimination 
against people based on age, race, color, creed, religion, national origin, 
ancestry, disability, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity 
or expression, weight or height, veteran status, or criminal conviction. 
Intake forms for claims of discrimination can be found at the Commission's 
website: www.binghamtonhrc.org.[138][139] The Press & Sun-Bulletin is the 
only major daily paper in Binghamton. As of 2014, the region makes up the 
159th largest television market in the United States,[140] as well as the 
187th largest radio market.[141] The market is served by TV stations that 
are affiliated with the major American broadcast networks, including WBNG-TV 
12 (CBS/CW), WBGH-CD 20 (NBC), WIVT 34 (ABC), and WICZ-TV 40 (Fox). WSKG-TV 
46 is Binghamton's PBS member station, and serves a large portion of the 
Southern Tier. Most Binghamton radio stations are owned by one of three 
groups: Townsquare Media, iHeartMedia, or the locally based Equinox Broadcasting.[142][143] 
Binghamton is a major junction in the Interstate Highway System, much as 
it was during the days of the railroad. Interstate 81, a major north-south 
route, connects the city to Syracuse and Ontario, as well as to Pennsylvania 
and Appalachia. Binghamton also serves as the western terminus of Interstate 
88, which gives a direct route to Albany. New York State Route 17, the 
Southern Tier Expressway, is in the process of being upgraded to Interstate 
86, and spans the southern border of New York, providing access to New 
York City, as well as to the western Southern Tier and Erie, Pennsylvania. 
Between 1953 and 1966, the state constructed an arterial system to alleviate 
traffic, which includes the Brandywine Highway (New York State Route 7), 
North Shore Drive (New York State Route 363), and the portion of the Vestal 
Parkway (New York State Route 434) within city limits.[144] Other major 
thoroughfares in the city include Chenango Street, Main Street (New York 
State Route 17C), and Court/Front Streets (U.S. Route 11). Public transportation 
in Binghamton and outlying areas is served by B.C. Transit, a daily bus 
service provided by Broome County. Binghamton University students are also 
served by Off-Campus College Transport. Intercity buses originate from 
the Greater Binghamton Transportation Center, which was opened in 2010 
and also serves as the B.C. Transit hub.[145] Greyhound Lines provides 
direct routes to Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester, Scranton, Toronto, and New 
York City. Short Line Buses offer service to Olean, Ithaca, Utica, Albany, 
New York City, and Long Island. Trailways of New York also has direct service 
to Albany and Rochester. The Greater Binghamton Airport (IATA code BGM, 
ICAO code KBGM) is a medium-size regional airport, and the only area airport 
that offers scheduled airline service. Located 10 miles (16 km) north of 
downtown, the airport has non-stop flights to Philadelphia on American 
Eagle, Newark Airport serving the New York City metro area on United Airlines, 
and Detroit on Delta Air Lines. The region also has a general aviation 
airport, Tri-Cities Airport, which is 10.5 miles (16.9 km) to the west. 
Binghamton is served by three freight railroads. Norfolk Southern Railway 
serves Binghamton with its Southern Tier Main Line (the former Erie Lackawanna 
mainline) and on the main line between Albany and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 
(formerly the Delaware and Hudson Railway). The New York, Susquehanna and 
Western Railway maintains lines from Binghamton to Syracuse and Utica, 
and the Central New York Railroad offers freight service to Port Jervis. 
Binghamton currently has no railroad passenger service. The last scheduled 
service, the Lake Cities train from Hoboken, New Jersey to Chicago, ended 
on January 6, 1970.[146] New York Senator Chuck Schumer is currently pushing 
for passenger rail service between Binghamton and New York City via Scranton 
and the Lackawanna Cut-Off.[147] Electricity and natural gas service are 
supplied and distributed by New York State Electric and Gas. The only cable 
provider in the city is Time Warner Cable, which also offers high-speed 
internet and digital phone. Verizon provides local telephone and internet 
service. Plexicomm offers wireless internet and VoIP phone service.[148] 
The City Department of Public Works handles garbage and recycling, and 
maintains city street lights.[149] The city also provides a free municipal 
wireless network in the downtown area, which is maintained by Plexicomm.[150] 
Water and sewer services are maintained by the city government. The primary 
source of potable water in Binghamton is the Susquehanna River, which is 
fed through a water treatment facility.[151] Sewage is treated and then 
released back into the Susquehanna downstream, at the Binghamton–Johnson 
City Joint Sewage Treatment Plant. The sewage plant was severely damaged 
by Tropical Storm Lee, and will require $90 million of repairs.[152] United 
Health Services (UHS) operates Binghamton General Hospital in the Southside, 
while Lourdes Hospital is sponsored by the Daughters of Charity of Saint 
Vincent de Paul. The Dr. Garabed A. Fattal Community Free Clinic is run 
by Upstate Medical University, and offers services in conjunction with 
the Broome County Health Department and United Health Services.[153] A 
third major area hospital, UHS Wilson Medical Center, is in Johnson City. 
The New York State Office of Mental Health operates the Greater Binghamton 
Health Center, which will become a regional center of excellence for children's 
behavior.[154] The Broome Developmental Center, operated by the state Office 
for People With Developmental Disabilities, is slated for closure in 2016.[155] 
Both facilities have seen patient numbers dwindle in recent years.[155][156] 
Binghamton has two sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:
