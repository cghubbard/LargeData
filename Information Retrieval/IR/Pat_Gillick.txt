As general manager As president Lawrence Patrick David Gillick (born August 
22, 1937) is an American professional baseball executive. He previously 
served as the general manager of four MLB teams: the Toronto Blue Jays 
(1978–94), Baltimore Orioles (1996–98), Seattle Mariners (2000–03), and 
Phillies (2006–08). He guided the Blue Jays to World Series championships 
in 1992 and 1993, and later with the Phillies in 2008. He won a national 
championship in college while pitching for the University of Southern California 
(USC). Gillick was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1997, the National Baseball Hall of Fame on July 24, 2011, and the Ontario 
Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.[2][3] Gillick was born to former minor league 
baseball player Larry Gillick in Chico, California. In 1951, he earned 
his Eagle Scout from the Boy Scouts of America. He continued to stay involved 
in Scouting and received the Order of the Arrow's Vigil Honor mere months 
after winning the College World Series at USC. After graduating from Notre 
Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California, he hitchhiked to Vulcan, 
Alberta to toil as a kid pitcher with the semi-pro Vulcan Elks of the Foothills-Wheatbelt 
League. Gillick had to wire his grandmother for 25 dollars to finance his 
last leg from Montana to Vulcan.[4] He attended USC and joined the Delta 
Chi Fraternity. He graduated in 1958 with a degree in business. He was 
also a gifted pitcher, playing on the 1958 National Title baseball team 
at USC and spending five years in the minor league systems of the Baltimore 
Orioles and the Pittsburgh Pirates, venturing as high as Triple-A. A left-hander, 
Gillick posted a win/loss record of 45–32 with an earned run average of 
3.42 in 164 minor league games. Gillick retired from playing and began 
a front-office career in 1963, when he became the assistant farm director 
with the Houston Astros. He would eventually work his way up to the position 
of Director of Scouting before moving to the New York Yankees system in 
1974, as a Coordinator of Player Development. In 1976, he moved, this time 
to the expansion Toronto Blue Jays, becoming their Vice President of Player 
Personnel, and in 1977, their Vice President of Baseball Operations and 
General Manager. In 1984, he was named Executive Vice President of Baseball 
Operations. As Toronto's general manager, Gillick won five division titles 
(1985, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1993) and led the club to their first World 
Series championships in 1992 and 1993. Shortly after Gillick resigned in 
1994, the Blue Jays went into decline, not finishing higher than third 
place until 2006, and failing to make the playoffs until 2015. In 1995, 
Gillick was named the general manager of the Baltimore Orioles to replace 
Roland Hemond, who had resigned.[5][6] He cited the fact that they were 
close to winning a championship as a factor to his decision to come out 
of retirement.[6] He guided the Orioles to the playoffs in 1996 and 1997. 
He resigned at the conclusion of his three-year contract in 1998.[7] The 
Orioles struggled shortly after his departure, failing to achieve a winning 
season until 2012.[8] Gillick then became the general manager of the Seattle 
Mariners, who had parlayed their incredible 1995 playoff run into a new 
ballpark and the financial resources to become a perennial contender. Upon 
his hiring, the responsibility fell on Gillick to trade Ken Griffey, Jr. 
to Cincinnati after Griffey played out his final season in Seattle. The 
Mariners made back-to-back playoff appearances for the only time in franchise 
history in 2000 and 2001, and the 2001 team, with a 116–46 record, tied 
the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the all-time Major League Baseball record for 
most wins in a single season. However, the Mariners failed to make it past 
the American League Championship Series in either year, and did not make 
the playoffs for the rest of Gillick's tenure as GM and advisor. The Mariners 
have not reached the playoffs since his departure.[9][unreliable source?] 
Gillick was inducted into the Toronto Blue Jays "Level of Excellence" on 
August 8, 2002. On November 2, 2005, Gillick was named the Philadelphia 
Phillies' general manager, after which his first big move was to trade 
Jim Thome and cash to the Chicago White Sox for Aaron Rowand along with 
prospects Gio Gonzalez and Daniel Haigwood, being a move which cleared 
the way for Phillies' Rookie of the Year Ryan Howard to become the permanent 
starter. Howard would be named NL MVP that year.[10] Gillick had permanent 
residence in Toronto with his wife Doris, however they have since re-located 
to Seattle after he became the Phillies GM. He had become a Canadian citizen 
in 2004. Gillick retired from his position as general manager after leading 
the Phillies to a World Series championship in 2008. Assistant general 
manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. was named his successor. Gillick remained in the 
organization as a senior advisor to Amaro and Phillies president David 
Montgomery.[11][unreliable source?] In August 2014, Gillick became interim 
president of the Phillies while Montgomery was on medical leave. In January 
2015, Montgomery returned but became Phillies chairman, while Gillick assumed 
the club presidency on a permanent basis.[12] Gillick returned to his senior 
advisor role after the Phillies promoted Andy MacPhail to President, who 
first joined the Phillies organization as a special assistant to Gillick
