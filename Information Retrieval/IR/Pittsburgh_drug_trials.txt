The Pittsburgh drug trials of 1985 were the catalyst for a Major League 
Baseball-related cocaine scandal. Several current and former members of 
the Pittsburgh Pirates – Dale Berra, Lee Lacy, Lee Mazzilli, John Milner, 
Dave Parker, and Rod Scurry – and other notable major league players – 
Willie Aikens, Vida Blue, Enos Cabell, Keith Hernandez, Jeffrey Leonard, 
Tim Raines, and Lonnie Smith – were called before a Pittsburgh grand jury. 
Their testimony led to the drug trials, which made national headlines in 
September 1985. Eleven players were officially suspended, but all the suspensions 
were commuted in exchange for fines, drug testing, and community service.[1] 
The Pittsburgh drug trials are considered one of baseball's biggest all-time 
scandals, albeit one that was "behind the scenes" and did not affect play 
on the field.[2] The players were granted immunity in exchange for their 
testimony.[3] Ex-Pirate John Milner talked about getting amphetamines from 
Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Willie Stargell. Milner added that he bought 
two grams of cocaine for $200 in the bathroom stalls at Three Rivers Stadium 
during a Pirates-Houston Astros game in 1980. Keith Hernandez revealed 
he'd used cocaine for three years. Hernandez later added that about 40% 
of all Major League Baseball players were using cocaine in the early 1980s[3] 
– he quickly backtracked, however, saying that he might have been "grossly 
wrong."[citation needed] Tim Raines admitted keeping a gram of coke in 
his uniform pocket (as well as revealing that he snorted during games), 
and that he only slid into bases headfirst so as not to break the vial.[4] 
Testimony also revealed that Rod Scurry once left the stadium to go looking 
for cocaine during the late innings of a Pirates game.[3] Drug dealers 
frequented the Pirates' clubhouse. Even the Pirate Parrot, Kevin Koch, 
was implicated for buying cocaine and introducing a few of the ballplayers 
to a local drug dealer.[5] Dealer Curtis Strong (ostensibly the Philadelphia 
Phillies' clubhouse caterer)[6] and six Pittsburgh men were convicted and 
found guilty of 11 counts of distributing cocaine by the United States 
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania:[7] In September 
2006, Shiffman and the former mascot Koch were interviewed on HBO's Real 
Sports with Bryant Gumbel in a segment entitled "Under the Influence."[9] 
On February 28, 1986, Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth handed down 
suspensions to 11 players. All the suspensions were commuted in exchange 
for fines and community service.[5] Ueberroth also asked each suspended 
player to submit to voluntary urine tests – ultimately, the Players Association 
thwarted that plea.[10] Seven players were determined to have been prolonged 
drug users who had also facilitated distribution to other players, and 
were suspended for a full season.[10] The players were allowed to continue 
playing under the condition that they donated 10% of their base salaries 
to drug-abuse programs, submitted to random drug testing, and contributed 
100 hours of drug-related community service. Four players were suspended 
for 60 days; they were allowed to continue playing if they donated 5% of 
base salaries and contributed 50 hours of drug-related community service:[5] 
Ten other players were named, but not suspended or otherwise punished. 
They were, however, subject to random drug testing for the duration of 
their careers:[10] In July 1987, a year and a half after the verdicts, 
and after Commissioner Ueberroth declared that baseball was free of drugs,[3] 
Lonnie Smith told the Kansas City Times that under his agreement he was 
supposed to be tested six-to-eight times per year, but had not been tested 
to-date in 1987. More so, he strongly disagreed with Ueberroth that baseball 
was then drug-free.[6][3] Several players went on to rejuvenated careers 
in the wake of the scandal: Others continued to struggle with substance
