David Leslie Stapleton (born January 16, 1954 in Fairhope, Alabama) is 
a former Major League Baseball player who played for the Boston Red Sox 
from 1980 to 1986. Stapleton attended University of South Alabama. Stapleton 
was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the tenth round (231st overall) of 
the 1975 amateur baseball draft and over the next five years worked his 
way up the Red Sox minor league system playing for Winter Haven, Bristol 
and Pawtucket. He made his first appearance for the Red Sox on May 30, 
1980. During his time with the Red Sox, he primarily served as a utility 
player, covering first base, second base, shortstop and third base as well 
as playing in the outfield and serving as designated hitter. In 1982 and 
1983 he served as the team's first baseman, losing the job to Bill Buckner 
in 1984. From 1984 to 1986, Stapleton only played 82 games for the Red 
Sox. Stapleton is most remembered in Boston by Red Sox fans in relation 
to the 1986 World Series. During the year, Stapleton was frequently called 
in as a late inning defensive replacement for the ailing Buckner. During 
Game 6 of the World Series, Red Sox manager John McNamara left Buckner 
in the game, leading to the infamous Mookie Wilson ground ball that went 
through Buckner's legs, giving the New York Mets a come-from-behind win 
in the tenth inning. The Mets went on to win the Series four games to three. 
After the 1986 season, Stapleton became a free agent and signed with the 
Seattle Mariners, but was released on March 31, 1987 prior to the start 
of the regular season. In his career, Stapleton batted .271 (550-2028), 
with 41 home runs, 224 RBI, 238 runs, 118 doubles, eight triple, six stolen 
bases, a .310 on-base percentage, and 807 total bases for a .398 slugging 
average.[1] Among major leaguers who played at least seven seasons, Stapleton 
is the only hitter in history whose batting average dropped in each successive
