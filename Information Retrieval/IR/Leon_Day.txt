Leon Day (October 30, 1916 – March 13, 1995) was an American right-handed 
pitcher in the Negro leagues. He played for the Baltimore Black Sox, the 
Brooklyn & Newark Eagles, and the Baltimore Elite Giants. He was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995, and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame 
in 2002. Day, born in Alexandria, Virginia, is noted for pitching a perfect 
season in 1937 (13-0) while playing for the Newark Eagles, and for his 
fastball. Day was also a good hitter and baserunner, batting .320 in 1937. 
From 1935 through 1946 he appeared in a record seven East-West All-Star 
Games, and set an all-star record by striking out 14 batters. On July 24, 
1942 Day set an NNL record when he struck out 18 Baltimore batters in a 
single game – including Roy Campanella three times. Day's teammate Monte 
Irvin referred to him "He (Day) was as good or better than Bob Gibson. 
When he pitched against Satchel Paige, Satchel didn't have an edge. You 
thought Don Newcombe could pitch. You should have seen Day"[1] When the 
Negro league was in the off-season, Day played winter ball in Puerto Rico. 
There he established a Puerto Rican record of 19 strikeouts. During World 
War II, Day served in the United States Army, landing on Utah Beach on 
D-Day.[2] He was discharged in February 1946, and on May 5 of that year 
pitched an Opening Day no-hitter against the Philadelphia Stars. In 1950 
he left the United States to play in Canada, with the Toronto Maple Leafs 
Baseball Club in the International League in 1951, for a year. The next 
two years he returned to play in the minor leagues, (most of which by then 
were also becoming integrated), then returned to Canada to finish his career. 
Day retired from baseball in 1955. In 1960, he was working in a Newark 
bar when he met Geraldine Ingram. She was in her early 20s, but she said 
that she liked how he treated women. After Ingram approached him, they 
went on a dinner date and began a relationship. They were married within 
about a year. The couple moved to Baltimore, where they supported the Baltimore 
Orioles baseball team.[3] He died of a heart attack in March 1995, just 
six days after learning he had been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
Leon Day was the 12th Hall of Famer chosen from the Negro leagues, and 
the seventh to be selected while he was still living. The "Bloomsbury Oval", 
a meadow/playgrounds in West Baltimore's Gwynns Falls Park was renamed
