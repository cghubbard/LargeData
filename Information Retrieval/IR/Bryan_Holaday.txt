John Bryan Holaday (born November 19, 1987) is an American professional 
baseball catcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Holaday made his MLB debut on June 6, 2012, with the Detroit Tigers. Prior 
to his professional career, Holaday played college baseball at TCU. In 
his senior season, Holaday won the Johnny Bench Award, given to the best 
collegiate catcher for the season. Holaday attended Warren Travis White 
High School in Dallas, Texas, where he played for the school's baseball 
team.[1] Holaday was a two-way player, appearing as both a pitcher and 
shortstop.[2] In 2006, he was named to the Class 5A All-State Third Team 
by the Texas Sports Writers Association.[3] Opposing teams began to consistently 
walk Holaday, leading the team's head coach to use him as the team's leadoff 
hitter.[4] He competed in the Connie Mack World Series after the 2006 season.[5] 
After graduating in 2006, he enrolled at North Central Texas College, where 
he was initially a third baseman.[6] During the season, he transitioned 
into a catcher.[2] During the summer of 2007, he played collegiate summer 
baseball for the McKinney Marshals of the Texas Collegiate League.[7] Holaday 
transferred to Texas Christian University (TCU) before his sophomore season, 
becoming the starting catcher for the TCU Horned Frogs baseball team.[2] 
In 2010, his senior season, he batted .355 17 home runs, 53 runs batted 
in (RBIs), and 72 runs scored in 68 games played.[8] He was credited for 
his work with the Horned Frogs' pitching staff, especially freshman Matt 
Purke.[9][10] He led the Horned Frogs to the Mountain West Conference (MWC) 
tournament, winning the tournament Most Valuable Player award. He was also 
named the Most Outstanding Player of the Houston College Classic.[11] Holaday 
was named to the All-MWC first team, though TCU coach Jim Schlossnagle 
indicated that he felt Holaday should have won the player of the year award 
over C. J. Cron, due to his contributions as a batter and as a fielder.[9] 
TCU reached the 2010 College World Series (CWS),[12] the school's first 
CWS appearance.[6] Holaday was named to the CWS All-Tournament Team. He 
was also named a Second Team All-American and won the Johnny Bench Award 
as the top collegiate catcher for the season.[11][13] The Detroit Tigers 
selected Holaday in the sixth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft. 
He signed, and played for the Lakeland Tigers of the Class A-Advanced Florida 
State League that season.[14] He attended Tigers' spring training as a 
non-roster invitee in 2011.[8] He played for the Erie Seawolves of the 
Eastern League, the Tigers Class AA affiliate, during the 2011 season.[15] 
He was again invited to spring training as a non-roster invitee in 2012. 
He started the season with the Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AAA International 
League, where he batted .248 with no home runs and ten RBIs.[16] The Tigers 
promoted Holaday to the major leagues on June 6, 2012, as the team added 
him to their 40-man roster due to injuries to starting catcher Alex Avila. 
He became the third position player selected in the 2010 draft to reach 
the majors, following Bryce Harper and Kole Calhoun.[16] Holaday made his 
MLB debut that day. He had one hit in four at bats during his debut.[17] 
Holaday was recalled June 17, 2013, when catcher Alex Avila was placed 
on the disabled list.[18] After the 2013 season, the Tigers informed backup 
catcher Brayan Pe√±a they would not re-sign him, giving Holaday the opportunity 
to become the backup to Avila.[19] Holaday competed with James McCann to 
be the backup catcher behind Avila during spring training in 2015. McCann 
won the competition, and Holaday began the season in the minor leagues.[20] 
Once again, Holaday entered Spring Training in 2016 competing for a backup 
role, this time with Jarrod Saltalamacchia. Despite losing the job, Holaday 
attracted large amounts of trade interest due to hitting .438/.455/.969 
in 16 games and his lack of minor league options remaining.[21] In 4 seasons 
with the Tigers, Holaday hit .251/.283/.340 with 3 HR and 30 RBI in 108 
games. On March 29, 2016, the Tigers traded Holaday to the Texas Rangers 
in exchange for Bobby Wilson and Myles Jaye.[22] Holaday began 2016 sharing 
catching duties with Robinson Chirinos. Following the acquisition of Jonathan 
Lucroy, Holaday was designated for assignment.[23] The Boston Red Sox claimed 
Holaday off of waivers on August 5.[24] Holaday's older brother, Bobby, 
also played for the baseball team at Warren Travis White High School.[1]
