Murfreesboro is a city in and the county seat of Rutherford County, Tennessee.[7] 
The population was 108,755 according to the 2010 census, up from 68,816 
residents certified in 2000. In 2014, census estimates showed a population 
of 120,954.[5] The city is the center of population of Tennessee[8] and 
is part of the Nashville metropolitan area, which includes thirteen counties 
and a population of 1,757,912 (2013). It is Tennessee's fastest growing 
major city and one of the fastest growing cities in the country.[9] Murfreesboro 
is also home to Middle Tennessee State University, the largest undergraduate 
university in the state of Tennessee, with an undergraduate population 
of 22,299 and 25,188 total students as of 2009[update].[10] In 2006, Murfreesboro 
was ranked by Money as the 84th best place to live in the United States, 
out of 745 cities with a population over 50,000.[11][12] In 1811, the Tennessee 
State Legislature established a county seat for Rutherford County. The 
town was first named "Cannonsburgh" in honor of Tennessee politician Newton 
Cannon, but was soon renamed "Murfreesboro" for Revolutionary War hero 
Colonel Hardy Murfree.[13] Author Mary Noailles Murfree was his great-granddaughter. 
As Tennessee grew westward, the location of the state capital in Knoxville 
began to be inconvenient for the many settlers at a distance to the west. 
In 1818, Murfreesboro was designated as the capital of Tennessee. In 1826, 
it was replaced by Nashville as the state capital.[14] On December 31, 
1862, the Battle of Stones River, also called the Battle of Murfreesboro, 
was fought near the city between the Union Army of the Cumberland and the 
Confederate Army of Tennessee. This was a major engagement of the American 
Civil War. Between December 31 and January 2, 1863, there were 23,515 casualties.[15] 
It was the bloodiest battle of the war based on percentage of casualties. 
Following the Confederate retreat from the Battle of Perryville in central 
Kentucky, Confederate forces moved through East Tennessee and turned northwest 
to defend at Murfreesboro. General Bragg's veteran cavalry was successful 
in harassing General Rosecrans' troop movements and in capturing and destroying 
supply trains, but could not completely stop the supplies and reinforcements 
from reaching Rosecrans. Despite the large number of casualties, the battle 
was tactically inconclusive. It is considered a Union victory. At the end 
of the battle, Confederate General Braxton Bragg retreated 36 miles (58 km) 
south to Tullahoma. General Rosecrans did not pursue until he had a secure 
logistical posture six months later in June 1863. The battle was strategically 
significant since it provided the Union with the basis for further movement 
to Chattanooga and Atlanta, which would eventually result in the Union 
splitting the Eastern and Western theaters by Sherman's March to the Sea. 
Stones River National Battlefield is a national historical site. General 
Rosecrans' movement to the south was dependent on a secure source of provisions. 
Murfreesboro was destined to become a supply depot for the Union Army. 
Soon after the battle ended in January 1863, Brigadier General James St. 
Clair Morton, Chief Engineer of the Army of the Cumberland, was charged 
with constructing Fortress Rosecrans approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) northwest 
of the town. The fortifications comprised more than 225 acres (0.91 km2) 
and were the largest built during the war. Immense quantities of supplies 
were stored and maintained in the fortress. The fortress consisted of eight 
lunettes, four redoubts and connecting fortifications. Both the Nashville 
and Chattanooga Railroad and the West Fork of the Stones River ran through 
the fortress. Two roads provided additional transportation capabilities. 
The interior of the fortress was a huge logistical resource center including 
sawmills, warehouses, quartermaster maintenance depots, ammunition magazines, 
and living quarters for the 2,000 troops who handled the supply operations 
and defended the fortress. After the fortress was rushed to completion 
in June, Rosecrans moved south leaving Brigadier General Horatio P. Van 
Cleve in command.[16] The fortress was never assaulted by Confederate forces, 
in part, because the Union held the town hostage by keeping cannon aimed 
at the courthouse. Significant portions of the earthworks still exist and 
have been incorporated into the battlefield site. Murfreesboro had begun 
as a mainly agricultural community, but by 1853 the area was home to several 
colleges and academies, earning it the nickname "Athens of Tennessee". 
Despite the trauma of the Civil War, by the early 1900s its growth began 
to regain momentum, in contrast to large areas of the South. In 1911, the 
state created Middle Tennessee State Normal School, a two-year school for 
training teachers. There was a subsequent merger with the Tennessee College 
for Women. In 1925 the school was expanded to a four-year institution. 
During and following World War II, it grew and developed, attaining university 
status in 1965 as Middle Tennessee State University.[17] MTSU now has the 
highest undergraduate enrollment in the state, including several hundred 
international students. World War II resulted in Murfreesboro diversifying 
into industry, manufacturing, and education. Since the end of World War 
II, growth has been steady, giving rise to a stable economy. Murfreesboro 
has enjoyed substantial residential and commercial growth, with its population 
increasing 123.9% between 1990 and 2010, from 44,922 to 100,575.[18] The 
city has been a destination for many immigrants leaving areas affected 
by warfare; since 1990 numerous Somalis and Kurds from Iraq have settled 
here. The city has also become more cosmopolitan by attracting more numerous 
international students to the university. Murfreesboro hosted its first 
pride parade in 2016.[19] The city council has six members, all elected 
at-large for four-year terms, on staggered schedules with elections every 
two years. The mayor is elected at large. City council members have responsibilities 
for various city departments. Murfreesboro is located at 35°50′46″N 86°23′31″W﻿ 
/ ﻿35.846143°N 86.392078°W﻿ / 35.846143; -86.392078.[20] According to the

the geographic center of the state of Tennessee. A stone monument marks 
the official site on Old Lascassas Pike, about 0.5 miles (0.80 km) north 
of MTSU. The West Fork of the Stones River flows through Murfreesboro. 
A walking trail, the Greenway, parallels the river for several miles. A 
smaller waterway, Lytle Creek, flows through downtown including historic 
"Cannonsburgh Village". Parts of the 19-mile (31 km) long creek suffer 
from pollution due to the urban environment and its use as a storm-water 
runoff.[22] Murfreesboro is home to a number of natural and man-made lakes 
plus several small wetlands including Todd's Lake and the Murfree Spring 
wetland area.[23][24] Murfreesboro is served by Nashville International

of destructive tornados several times. On April 10, 2009, at approximately 
12:30 p.m. CDT, an EF4 tornado struck the western and northern fringes 
of the city of Murfreesboro. As a result, two people were killed and 41 
others injured. 845 homes were affected: 117 were totally destroyed; 292 
had major damage; 175 had minor damage and 255 others were affected to 
some degree. The tornado, which the National Weather Service indicates

Center of Murfreesboro faced protests related to its plan to build a new 
12,000-square-foot (1,100 m2) mosque. The county planning council had approved 
the project, but opposition grew in the aftermath, affected by this being 
a year of elections. Signs on the building site were vandalized, with the 
first saying "not welcome" sprayed across it and the second being cut in 
two.[53] Construction equipment was also torched by arsonists.[54] In August 
2011, a Rutherford County judge upheld his previous decision allowing the 
mosque to be built, noting the US constitutional right to religious freedom 
and the ICM's observance of needed process.[55] The Center has a permanent 
membership of around 250 families and a few hundred students from the university.[56] 
The case ultimately attracted national media attention as an issue of religious 
freedom. Murfreesboro is the home of a Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy
