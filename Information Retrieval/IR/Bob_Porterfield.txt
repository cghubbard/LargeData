Erwin Coolidge "Bob" Porterfield (August 10, 1923 – April 28, 1980) was 
a right-handed Major League Baseball pitcher. He played for twelve seasons 
between 1948 and 1959 for the New York Yankees, Washington Senators, Boston 
Red Sox, Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs. He appeared in one All-Star 
game in his career. Originally signed by the Yankees in 1946, it did not 
take him long to reach the Major Leagues. He made his debut on August 8, 
1948 at the age of 24. He showed some promise in his rookie season, going 
5 and 3 with a 4.50 ERA in 78 innings of work. Although he walked 34 and 
struck out only 30 batters, he threw only one wild pitch in that time so 
his control must not have been too much of a concern. While in the minors 
in 1948, he led the International League in ERA. He spent the next couple 
years with the Yankees, never playing a full season with them. In his time 
with them, he wore the number 18, except in 1951, he wore 23. On June 15, 
1951, he was sent with Tom Ferrick and Fred Sanford to the Senators for 
Bob Kuzava. The Senators would end up getting the better of the deal. In 
less than three seasons with the Yankees, Kuzava would go 15 and 19 as 
a starter/reliever. In contrast, Ferrick went 6 and 3 with a 2.73 ERA in 
49 relief appearances with the Senators. Although Stanford did not amount 
to much, Bob Porterfield was the gem of the trade. In 1952, he posted a 
mediocre 13 and 14 record, but he did post solid 2.72 ERA, which was good 
for seventh in the league. In 1953, he led the league with 22 wins and 
was tenth in the league with a 3.35 ERA. He was seventh in the league in 
MVP voting and was named The Sporting News Pitcher of the Year. He led 
the league with 24 complete games and 9 shutouts and was also involved 
in a triple play on May 22. He threw two one-hitters in 1953. Oddly, this 
season was not his lone All-Star season. In fact, 1954 was. He posted a 
mediocre 13 and 15 record, leading the league in hits allowed with 249. 
He did lead the league in complete games with 21, but obviously 1953 was 
far more All-Star worthy than 1954. In his appearance in the All-Star Game, 
he allowed one home run to Ted Kluszewski. After his three successful seasons 
in which he averaged a record of 15 and 13, and posted a cumulative 3.14 
ERA, his career quickly spiraled downward. His 10 and 17 record and 4.45 
in 1955 prompted the Senators to trade him (along with Johnny Schmitz, 
Tom Umphlett, and Mickey Vernon) to the Red Sox for Karl Olson, Dick Brodowski, 
Tex Clevenger, Neil Chrisley, and Al Curtis (a minor leaguer) on November 
8 of that year. While with the Senators, he wore the number 19, except 
in 1951, where he wore 29. His statistics did not improve while with the 
Red Sox. In fact, in just over two years with the Red Sox, he posted a 
7 and 16 record with an ERA of 4.65. After pitching only two games with 
the Red Sox in the 1958 season, the Pirates purchased him. In his time 
with the Red Sox, he wore number 19, except in 1956, where he wore 16 and 
20. He actually did fairly well with the Pirates in 1958—in 37 appearances 
(only six starts), he posted a less-than-stellar 4 and 6 record, but his 
ERA was a solid 3.29. He surrendered only 78 hits in 87 2⁄3 innings with 
the Bucs. He won quite a pitching duel with Curt Simmons, earning the victory 
in a 1–0, 11 inning bout with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was involved 
in another interesting game in 1958 as well—on July 23, "Dodger Norm Larker 
hits a ball just inside the 1B line, which the Pirates believe to be foul. 
When umpire Vic Delmore signals it fair, P Bob Porterfield picks up the 
ball from where it had rolled into the bullpen. Though not playing, Porterfield 
is ejected for intentional interference with a ball in play. Larker is 
safe on 2B. The Dodgers still lose 11–3 in the doubleheader opener and 
are now in last place."[1] 1959 was an interesting year for Porterfield. 
He started off the season with the Pirates, pitching six games with them, 
posting a small ERA of 1.69. Nevertheless, the Pirates released him, and 
the Cubs picked him up. With them, he pitched four games, posting an 11.37 
in that time. He was then selected off waivers from the Cubs by the Pirates, 
the team he started the season with. This go-around with the Bucs was not 
so successful. In 30 relief appearances, he posted a 4.75 ERA. He played 
his final game on September 9, 1959. The final batter he faced was Lee 
Maye. He was released two days after the 1959 season ended. In his time 
with the Pirates, he wore 16 again. With the Cubs, he wore 43. Overall, 
he posted an 87 and 97 career record with a 3.79 ERA and 1,567+ innings 
of work. He was obviously not a strikeout pitcher-he posted just 572 Ks 
in his career (that is only about 3.3 per nine innings of work). He posted 
a .184 career batting average, although he did have two very successful 
seasons. In 98 at-bats in 1953, for example, he posted a .255 average with 
three home runs and sixteen RBI. His first career home run was a grand 
slam, which he hit on May 5 of that year. In 1956, he hit .326 in 43 at-bats. 
Overall, he hit six home runs in his career, driving in 43 runs. He stole 
one base in one chance. In the field, he committed 15 errors for a .960 
fielding percentage. He was also involved in 15 double plays in his career. 
After his career ended, he became a welder for the Westinghouse Corporation. 
In 1966, he received one vote for induction into the baseball Hall of Fame-obviously 
not enough to get him in. He died in 1980 in Charlotte, North Carolina, 
from lymphoma, at the age of 56. He is buried in Sharon Memorial Park in 
Charlotte. In 2005, Porterfield was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall
