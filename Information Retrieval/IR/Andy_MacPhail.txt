Andrew Bowen MacPhail (born April 5, 1953) is an American baseball executive 
and currently the President of Baseball Operations for the Philadelphia 
Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously served as general 
manager for the Minnesota Twins and Chicago Cubs, and as president for 
the Baltimore Orioles. MacPhail is the son of Lee MacPhail and the grandson 
of Larry MacPhail, both of whom were inducted into the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame for their careers as executives in MLB. MacPhail began his 
career as a baseball executive with the Chicago Cubs' Rookie-level Minor 
League Baseball affiliate in 1976. After a year in the role, he became 
an assistant in the Cubs' parks operations department, and was promoted 
to assistant director of player development. He joined the front office 
of the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball as their assistant director 
of scouting in 1981, and then was promoted to assistant to the general 
manager in 1982. He was hired as the Minnesota Twins' vice president of 
player development in 1984,[1] and then as the Twins' general manager in 
1985. As the Twins' general manager, he hired Tom Kelly to serve as the 
team's field manager, and traded for Jeff Reardon, Dan Gladden, Joe Niekro, 
and Dan Schatzeder.[2] Under MacPhail, the Twins won the 1987 World Series 
and 1991 World Series championships. The 1991 Twins rebounded from a last 
place finish after MacPhail signed Jack Morris in the offseason.[1] MacPhail 
won Sporting News' Executive of the Year Award in 1991.[3] At the end of 
the 1994 season, the Cubs hired MacPhail as their president and chief executive 
officer.[4] MacPhail demoted Larry Himes, the Cubs' general manager,[1] 
and hired Ed Lynch to fill the role.[5] The Cubs reached the playoffs when 
they won the National League wild card spot in 1998. They won the National 
League Central division in 2003.[6] MacPhail served with the Cubs until 
the end of the 2006 season, when he stepped down and was succeeded by John 
McDonough.[7] Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, hired 
MacPhail as the team's President of Baseball Operations on June 20, 2007.[3] 
Before the 2008 season, MacPhail traded Érik Bédard for a package that 
included Adam Jones and Chris Tillman. He acquired J. J. Hardy after the 
2010 season and Chris Davis and Tommy Hunter at the trade deadline in 2011. 
He also hired Buck Showalter as manager during the 2010 season.[6] MacPhail's 
contract expired at the end of the 2011 season, following the Orioles' 
14th consecutive losing season, and he opted to leave the team.[8] Many 
of the players acquired by MacPhail, as well as Showalter, helped the Orioles 
reach the postseason after MacPhail's departure.[6] On June 29, 2015, the 
Philadelphia Phillies hired MacPhail as a special assistant to Pat Gillick, 
the team's president. MacPhail succeeded Gillick as president at the end 
of the 2015 season.[9] MacPhail is the youngest of four sons born to Lee 
MacPhail, who served as president of the American League.[10][11] He is 
the grandson of Larry MacPhail, who with Lee forms the only father-and-son 
members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Andy's uncle, Bill MacPhail (Lee 
MacPhail's brother), was President of CBS Sports and later was President 
of CNN Sports.[10] MacPhail graduated with a degree in American Studies 
from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 1977,[2] where he
