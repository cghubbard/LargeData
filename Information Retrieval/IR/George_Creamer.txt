W. Triebel, was an American Major League Baseball second baseman from Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania. He played with four different teams in two leagues: the Milwaukee 
Grays (1878), the Syracuse Stars (1879), the Worcester Ruby Legs (1880–1882), 
and the Pittsburgh Alleghenys (1883–1884).[1] On August 20, 1883, after 
a game between the Louisville Eclipse and the Alleghenys‚ Creamer and fellow 
players Billy Taylor and Mike Mansell were each fined $100 and suspended 
indefinitely for drunkenness.[2] In 1884, he briefly managed the Alleghenys 
for 8 games, but he lost all the games he oversaw.[1] Creamer died of tuberculosis
