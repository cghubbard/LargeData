Westbury incorporated in 1932 as a village in Nassau County, New York in 
the United States. The population was 15,146 at the 2010 census. The Incorporated 
Village of Westbury is in the Town of North Hempstead. It is located about 
18 miles(40 km) east of Manhattan. The first settlers arrived in 1658 in 
the region known as the Hempstead Plains. Many of the early settlers were 
Quakers. Westbury's Jericho Turnpike which provides connection to Mineola 
and Syosset as well as to the Long Island Expressway (or LIE) was once 
a trail used by the Massapequa Indians. As far back as the 17th century, 
it served as a divider between the early homesteads north of the Turnpike 
and the great plains to its south. Today, it serves as a state highway 
complex. In 1657, Captain John Seaman purchased 12,000 acres (49 km2) from 
the Algonquian Tribe of the Massapequa Indians. In 1658, Richard Stites 
and his family built their homestead in this area.[citation needed] Theirs 
was the only family farm until an English Quaker, Edmond Titus, and his 
son Samuel, joined them and settled in an area of Hempstead Plains known 
to us today as the Village of Westbury. In 1675 Henry Willis, also an English 
Quaker, named the area "Westbury", after Westbury, Wiltshire, his hometown 
in England.[3] Other Quaker families who were also seeking a place to freely 
express their religious beliefs joined the Tituses and Willises. The first 
Society of Friends meeting house was built in 1700. The early history of 
Westbury and that of the Friends are so interconnected that they are essentially 
the same. These settlers, like many other landowners throughout the colonies, 
owned slaves. In 1775, compelled by their religious beliefs, the Quakers 
freed all 154 African-Americans that they owned. Many of these freed men 
and women built their own homesteads on the open land near the sheep grazing 
pastures. Their new community consisted of farms and dairies. In 1834, 
with Quaker assistance, they and their descendants built the New Light 
Baptist Church. Now known as the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, 
the building still stands on the corner of Union Avenue and Cross Street. 
The outbreak of the American Revolution disrupted Westbury's tranquility. 
From the beginning of the war until 1783, British soldiers and German-speaking 
mercenaries occupied local homes, confiscated livestock, and cleared the 
woods for firewood for the troops. With the close of the war, Westbury 
received its third group of settlers, the Hessians, mostly from Hesse-Cassel 
in the Holy Roman Empire, who chose not to return to their home country. 
Instead, they remained in an area now known as New Cassel, a name chosen 
in honour of the part of Hesse from which most had come.[4] By 1837, the 
Long Island Rail Road had built through Westbury. Schedules from March 
1837 mention a stop at Westbury, but by June list Carle Place instead,[5] 
with schedules from 1842 listing both.[6] In 1840, the first public school 
was built. The railroad made it easier for German, Italian, Irish and Polish 
immigrants to work Westbury's farms and in 1857, St. Brigid's Parish was 
founded. At the same time more African-American families came to the area 
via the Underground Railroad. For some, Westbury was only one stop on the 
way to Canada, but several stayed in this area after being harbored in 
secret rooms in the homes of the Quakers. In the years after the Civil 
War, until near the turn of the century, the few stores that comprised 
the small village around the railroad depot, were mainly black owned. The 
Village moved from its agricultural setting in the late 19th century when 
the very wealthy began to settle and build mansions. This area is now known 
as Old Westbury. Post Avenue soon became a commerce center to serve the 
surrounding estates. Various estate workers began to move in as well. Streets 
were mapped out and constructed. Post Avenue received electricity in 1902 
and in 1914 a water company was founded. From the 1850s to the 1900s, Westbury's 
population and ethnic diversity began to rise as many people of Irish, 
Italian and Polish origins continued to settle. New Cassel began to be 
developed in the first quarter of the 20th century.[4] In 1927, Charles 
Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field, a couple of hundred yards south 
of downtown, for the history-making flight to Paris, marking probably the 
most famous event tied to Westbury.[7] In response to a rumor that northern 
Westbury planned to incorporate, thereby leaving the southern part without 
a name,[citation needed] residents[who?] collected enough petitions for 
third class[clarification needed] incorporation in 1932. The Village included 
Grantsville, the section south of Union Avenue around A.M.E. Zion church, 
but did not take in New Cassel, since the few families that lived there 
thought it would only unnecessarily increase their taxes. In 1938, the 
Northern State Parkway was constructed and in 1940, Roosevelt Raceway. 
In 1941, the Second World War began. Westbury sent 1,400 persons to serve 
the country. This was 20% of the community's population, making it the 
highest percentage of any comparable community in the United States. In 
the mid-1950s, Westbury virtually ran out of undeveloped land and with 
it came the end of the building boom. In 1940, Westbury listed its population 
at 4,525. By 1960, Westbury's population had grown to 14,757, according 
to the census data for that year. Many Caribbean and Latin American families 
began to settle during this time and in the decades that followed. As the 
birth rate declined, people married at a later age and the high cost of 
buying a home prevented many people from assuming a mortgage in the 1970s, 
Westbury again underwent change. Today, the Village's population remains 
over 15,000 and is rich with ethnic and racial diversity. Westbury is located 
at 40°45′32″N 73°35′17″W﻿ / ﻿40.758930°N 73.588173°W﻿ / 40.758930; -73.588173.[8] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area 
of 2.4 square miles (6.2 km2), all of it land. In addition to Westbury 
Village itself, unincorporated regions surrounding its borders also use 
the Westbury name, including New Cassel, Salisbury (South Westbury) and 
parts of Jericho. For example, the world-famous Westbury Music Fair performing 
venue (now known as the NYCB Theatre at Westbury), located in the Westbury 
postal zone, is part of the Jericho hamlet. The region is grouped under 
the name Greater Westbury, a region that also includes organizations with 
common interests, such as those in Carle Place, New York to the south and 
Old Westbury, New York to the north. The school districts that serve the 
Greater Westbury region, based on the boundaries, are Westbury (including 
New Cassel), Carle Place, East Meadow, East Williston and Jericho. The 
only homes zoned for East Meadow Schools are actually located in the Hamlet 
of Salisbury, which is in the Town of Hempstead.[9][10] Westbury School 
District students attend Westbury High School. Westbrook Preparatory School 
is a special school located in the village. Westbury is a very diverse 
community, made up of Italian-Americans, African-Americans, Arab-Americans, 
Indian-Americans, and Hispanic Americans. Many of the Hispanics are of 
Salvadoran origin. Many of the Italian-Americans in the village trace their 
origins to the town of Durazzano in Southern Italy, and are closely related. 
A great number still reside on the Hill across from Saint Brigid's Church. 
The nickname for the Village, "A Community for All Seasons," was adapted 
after The Greater Westbury Community Coalition ran a slogan contest shortly 
after the 1966 release of the Oscar-winning Best Movie-- “A Man for All 
Seasons.” The film was about Sir Thomas More who was portrayed as a man 
of the utmost principle. The winning slogan: “A Community For All Seasons” 
was a take-off on the movie’s title and was meant to suggest that Westbury 
was a good place to live, a place that stood for accepting people of all 
sorts, a community that embraced diversity. As of the census[1] of 2010, 
there were 15,146 people, 4,638 households, and 3,441 families residing

over. Westbury is served by the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road 
with connection to Penn Station, Hicksville and Port Jefferson. It is also
