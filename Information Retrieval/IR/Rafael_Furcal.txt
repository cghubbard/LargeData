Rafael Antoni Furcal (born October 24, 1977) is a Dominican former professional 
baseball shortstop. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta 
Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals and Miami Marlins. Furcal 
grew up in Loma de Cabrera, a small village in the Dominican Republic near 
the Dajabón River and border with Haiti. His father, Silvino, drove a taxi 
and his mother, Aura, was a schoolteacher. Furcal had three older brothers, 
José, Manuel and Lorenzo, and a sister.[1] Silvino Furcal was a standout 
outfielder during an era when Dominican ballplayers did not get much recognition 
from Major League scouts.[2] Silvino introduced his sons to baseball and 
Rafael credited his father with teaching him how to enjoy the game. Until 
his death in 2010, Silvino would often call Rafael to give him advice after 
games.[3] Manuel Furcal pitched in the Seattle Mariners organization and 
Lorenzo played in the Oakland Athletics system before suffering career-ending 
injuries.[2] José Furcal committed suicide in 1999 and Manuel died that 
same year in an accident.[2][3] Furcal attended Jose Cabrera High School 
and was prepared to enroll in engineering school before being spotted by 
a scout at a tryout in Santo Domingo. He was subsequently signed as an 
amateur free agent by the Atlanta Braves on November 9, 1996 for $5,000.[2] 
He began his professional career as a second baseman with the Gulf Coast 
Braves in 1997. The following season, with the Danville Braves he hit .328 
and stole a league record 60 bases in only 66 games. He was named Danville's 
Player of the Year and Appalachian League All-Star Second Baseman. In 1999, 
he switched to shortstop and joined the Macon Braves in "A" ball and hit 
.337 with 73 stolen bases in 83 games. He was transferred to the advanced 
"A" team in Myrtle Beach and hit .293 for them with 23 steals in 43 games. 
He led all of minor league baseball with 96 steals total. He was named 
to Baseball America's first team All-Star team and the South Atlantic League 
All-Star team. In addition, he was the Braves Minor League Player of the 
Year, the South Atlantic League Most Outstanding Prospect and a Class A 
All-Star. An injury to Braves shortstop Walt Weiss prior to the 2000 season 
led to Furcal improbably making the jump from "A" ball to the Major League 
roster. He made his Major League debut on April 4, 2000 against the Colorado 
Rockies, getting 2 hits in 4 at-bats. His first hit was against Rockies 
pitcher Rolando Arrojo. Furcal went on to hit .295 with 40 stolen bases 
for the Braves and won the National League Rookie of the Year Award that 
year. He missed most of the 2001 season because of a dislocated left shoulder, 
suffered while stealing second base in a July 6 game at Boston. The Braves 
learned Furcal's true age, then 23, at the start of the 2002 season. Before 
then, he had claimed he was only 21.[4][5] He returned to the starting 
lineup that season and tied a modern Major League record with three triples 
in a game on April 21 against Florida. Furcal completed an unassisted triple 
play for the Braves against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 10, 2003. 
It was the 12th in baseball history. In the fifth inning, the shortstop 
caught pitcher Woody Williams' liner with the runners moving in a hit and 
run attempt, stepped on second base to retire catcher Mike Matheny (who 
later became Furcal's manager in St. Louis) and tagged Orlando Palmeiro 
before he could return to first.[6] He was selected to the National League 
All-Star Team as a reserve in 2003. In September 2004, during his final 
season with the Braves, he was arrested for drunk driving, violating his 
probation dating from an earlier drunk driving arrest in June 2000. Furcal 
was ordered to serve 21 days in jail. In an unusual arrangement, the beginning 
of the jail term was contingent upon the Braves' situation on the playoffs. 
Once the Braves were eliminated from post-season action, Furcal served 
his time.[7] On December 7, 2005, Furcal signed a free agent contract with 
the Los Angeles Dodgers for three years and $39 million. In September 2006 
Furcal was selected as the inaugural winner of the Roy Campanella Award, 
given to the Dodgers player who best exemplifies the spirit and leadership 
of the late Hall of Fame catcher. The award was voted on by only his teammates. 
In May 2007, he became one of only five Major League players to get 4 hits 
in each of 3 consecutive games. Early in 2008, he suffered a back injury 
that kept him sidelined for most of the season, not returning until right 
before the playoffs started. In the fifth inning of Game Five the 2008 
National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, 
Furcal made three errors to set records for most errors in one NLCS inning 
and game. He was just the second player to make three errors in one postseason 
inning. No shortstop had made three errors in one playoff game since Buck 
Weaver in the 1917 World Series. Two of the errors came on the same play 
as Furcal booted a routine groundball hit by Pat Burrell and then airmailed 
his throw behind home plate in a failed attempt to prevent Chase Utley 
from scoring.[8] On December 19, 2008, after speculation that he would 
re-sign with the Braves as a free agent, Furcal signed a 3-year $30 million 
contract to stay with the Dodgers.[9] Furcal struggled in the first year 
of his new contract, hitting only .269 for the Dodgers in 2009. His on-base 
plus slugging of .711 was also below his career average of .757.[10] Furcal 
was added to the 2010 National League All-Star team as a reserve after 
New York Mets shortstop José Reyes suffered an injury and was forced to 
withdraw. Furcal walked in his only plate appearance in the game. Due to 
injuries he only appeared in 97 games for the Dodgers in 2010, but finished 
with a .300 batting average and stole 22 bases. In 2011, he spent more 
time on the disabled list than the active roster for the Dodgers, appearing 
in just 37 games, during which he hit only .197. Furcal was traded along 
with cash considerations to the St. Louis Cardinals on July 30, 2011 for 
Double-A outfielder Alex Castellanos. In 50 games with the Cardinals, he 
hit .255 with 7 home runs. In the 2011 World Series, he only hit .179 but 
picked up his first World Series ring when the Cards won the series by 
beating the Texas Rangers in seven games.[11][12] On October 31, 2011, 
the St. Louis Cardinals declined his $12 million option for 2012. The club 
signed Furcal to a 2-year, $14 million deal on December 10, 2011. During 
the 2012 season Furcal was batting .264 with five home runs and 49 RBIs 
until being sidelined with an elbow injury on August 30.[13] An MRI of 
the elbow revealed damage to a ligament in his throwing arm. Furcal would 
be placed on the disabled list for the remainder of the season in order 
to undergo four to six weeks of physical rehabilitation in the hopes of 
forestalling surgical repair.[14] As a replacement for Furcal, the Cardinals 
called up Pete Kozma from the Triple-A affiliate Memphis Redbirds.[15] 
On March 7, 2013 the Cardinals announced that Furcal would undergo Tommy 
John surgery and would almost certainly miss all of the 2013 baseball season.[16] 
An off-season program of rest and rehabilitation for his damaged right 
elbow at first appeared to be successful, as Furcal reported for Cardinals 
spring training. However a bone spur began to cause discomfort prompting 
an MRI and examination by Cardinals team radiologist Greg Cizek on March 
4, 2013, who recommended surgery. A second opinion from noted surgeon Dr. 
James Andrews confirmed the diagnosis on March 6, 2013.[16] He became a 
free agent after the 2013 World Series on October 31, 2013.[17] On December 
6, 2013, Furcal signed a one-year deal with the Miami Marlins.[18][19] 
With the younger Adeiny Hechavarria at shortstop, Furcal was projected 
to play second base with the Marlins.[20] He made his Marlins debut on 
June 13, 2014, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. On March 17, 2015, Furcal 
signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. He was released 
on March 31[21] and then re-signed the following day to another minor league 
contract.[22] He played just seven games in the minors for the Wilmington 
Blue Rocks and Northwest Arkansas Naturals, hitting .240. On May 19, he 
announced his retirement.[23] During the offseason, Furcal played for the 
Aguilas Cibaeñas. He resides in Santiago, Dominican Republic with his family. 
Furcal met his wife, Glenny, during his final spring training with the 
Braves and the couple has two sons together, Rafael, Jr. (born in 2006) 
and Anthony (born in 2008).[2][24] Furcal also has a daughter named Ashley 
from a previous relationship.[1] Furcal has used his baseball earnings 
to give back to his hometown. When Furcal re-signed with the Dodgers in 
2008, he arranged to have the Los Angeles Fire Department donate a fire 
truck to Loma de Cabrera which, until then, did not have a fire department.[25] 
He has also arranged to pay the hospital bills of Loma de Cabrera residents.[1][26] 
Furcal's father, Silvino, died on Father's Day in 2010 after being kicked
