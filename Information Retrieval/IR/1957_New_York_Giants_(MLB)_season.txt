The 1957 New York Giants season involved the team finishing in sixth place 
in the National League with a 69–85 record, 26 games behind the NL and 
World Champion Milwaukee Braves. It was the team's 75th and final season 
in New York City before its relocation to San Francisco, California for 
the following season. The last game at their stadium, the Polo Grounds, 
was played on September 29 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. While seeking 
a new stadium to replace the crumbling Polo Grounds, the Giants began to 
contemplate a move from New York, initially considering Metropolitan Stadium 
in Minneapolis–St. Paul, which was home to their top farm team, the Minneapolis 
Millers. Under the rules of the time, the Giants' ownership of the Millers 
gave them priority rights to a major league team in the area. At this time, 
the Giants were approached by San Francisco mayor George Christopher. Despite 
objections from shareholders such as Joan Whitney Payson (who later owned 
the expansion Mets), majority owner Horace Stoneham entered into negotiations 
with San Francisco officials around the same time that Dodgers' owner Walter 
O'Malley was courting the city of Los Angeles. O'Malley had been told that 
the Dodgers would not be allowed to move to Los Angeles unless a second 
team moved to California as well. He pushed Stoneham toward relocation. 
In the summer of 1957, both the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers 
announced their moves to California, and the golden age of baseball in 
the New York area ended. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other
