Jeremy Bryan Sowers (born May 17, 1983) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. Sowers grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, where he attended 
Ballard High School. His twin brother, Joshua Sowers, formerly played in 
the Toronto Blue Jays organization. Sowers pitching repertoire features 
a fastball with which he varies the speed between about 85 and 92 mph, 
a curveball, a slider that cuts in on right-handed batters, and a changeup.[1] 
Sowers threw four no-hitters in high school. In both his junior and his 
senior year at Ballard, he led the team to consecutive appearances in the 
state high school championship game and was named All-State, All-Section, 
All-Region and County Player of the Year. As a senior, he was named to 
Baseball America's National High School All-American team, Kentucky Gatorade 
Player of the Year, Mr. Kentucky Baseball and Kentucky High School Coaches 
Association Athlete of the Year.[2] He was selected out of high school 
with the 20th overall pick in the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft by the 
Cincinnati Reds. Rather than sign with the Reds, Sowers chose to attend 
Vanderbilt University where he was named to the Louisville Slugger Freshman 
All-American team following the 2002 season[3] and to their 2004 pre-season 
All-American team.[4] He was second team All-SEC as both a sophomore[5] 
and a junior[6] and was also selected second team All-South Region by the 
American Baseball Coaches Association as a sophomore.[7] After his junior 
year at Vanderbilt, the Indians selected Sowers with the 6th overall pick 
in the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft and he signed with them for a $2.475 
million signing bonus, the third highest bonus in club history.[8] During 
the 2005–06 offseason, he was granted permission by the club to return 
to Vanderbilt to complete his political science degree. Sowers split most 
of the 2005 season between the Indians' Single-A (Kinston) and Double-A 
(Akron) farm teams, compiling a combined 13–4 record and 2.40 ERA. He finished 
2005 with a single start for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons in which he was 
credited with a win. He was named the Indians Minor League Pitcher of the 
Year (Bob Feller Award) for the 2005 season.[9] Baseball America named 
him the #2 prospect in the Indians organization,[10] the #6 prospect in 
the Carolina League[11] and the #8 prospect in the Eastern League.[12] 
He was named the Indians' 2005 Minor League Player of the Year (receiving 
the "Lou Boudreau Award").[13] In 2006, he was a non-roster invitee at 
the Indians' spring training, but did not make the club's Opening Day roster, 
beginning the season with Buffalo. In 15 starts for the Bisons, he picked 
up where he left off in 2005, posting a sterling 9–1 record and 1.39 ERA. 
Baseball America named him the #3 prospect in the International League.[14] 
Sowers' performance for Buffalo in 2006 earned him a promotion to Cleveland 
on June 20 where he made his major league debut against the Reds on June 
25, taking the loss (5 IP, 4 ERs, 5 Hs, 2 HRs, 3 SOs, 2 BBs). He tossed 
his first major league complete game shutout on July 22, 2006, against 
the Minnesota Twins, allowing 4 hits and 1 walk while striking out 4. Six 
days later, he threw another shutout—this one a 1–0 game against the Seattle 
Mariners—becoming the first Indians rookie to throw back-to-back shutouts 
since Dick Tidrow in 1972.[15] In his next start against Boston, he extended 
his scoreless inning streak to 22 before yielding an RBI double in the 
fifth inning. Sowers was projected to be the Indians' fourth starter in 
2007.[16] When Cliff Lee was injured during spring training, Sowers was 
bumped up to the third spot in the starting rotation. However, he struggled 
through the first two months of the season (1–6, 6.93 ERA in 12 starts) 
and was demoted to Buffalo on June 10.[17] During spring training in 2009, 
Sowers competed for the fifth starting pitcher slot; he was not selected 
and was sent down to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers.[18] On March 31, 2010, 
after failing to secure a spot in the major league starting rotation, Sowers 
was sent outright to Triple-A Columbus and removed from the Indians' 40-man 
roster. Suffering with a sore shoulder for most of the season, Sowers was 
finally placed on the disabled list on August 14, 2010 and did not play
