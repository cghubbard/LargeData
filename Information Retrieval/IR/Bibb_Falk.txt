As player As manager Bibb August Falk (January 27, 1899 – June 8, 1989) 
was an American left fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the 
Chicago White Sox (1920–28) and Cleveland Indians (1929–31). Born in Austin,

College World Series titles in 1949 and 1950. In 1975, the new Disch-Falk 
Field at the University of Texas was named in honor of Falk and his former
