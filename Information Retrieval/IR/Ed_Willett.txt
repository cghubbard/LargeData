Robert Edgar Willett (March 7, 1884 – May 10, 1934), sometimes known by 
the nickname "Farmer",[1] was a right-handed American baseball pitcher. 
He played professional baseball for 17 years from 1905 to 1921, including 
ten seasons in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers of the American 
League from 1906 to 1913 and the St. Louis Terriers of the Federal League 
from 1914 to 1915. In 274 major league games, Willett compiled a 102–100 
win–loss record with 142 complete games, an earned run average (ERA) of 
3.08, 600 strikeouts, and 695 assists in 1,773 innings pitched. Willett 
was born in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1884.[2] He moved to Caldwell, Kansas, 
in his youth. Willett began his professional baseball career in the Western 
Association, playing for the Wichita Jobbers in 1905 and 1906. He compiled 
a 10–5 win-loss record with a 2.69 earned run average (ERA) in 16 games 
during the 1905 season and a 12–17 record in 38 games for Wichita in 1906.[3] 
On August 27, 1906, in his final game in a Wichita uniform, Willett held 
Webb City to one run in 15 innings.[4] Although he lost more games than 
he won in 1906, he reportedly lost a number of games on flukes and was 
regarded by many as the best pitcher in the Western Association.[5] On 
August 9, 1906, Willett was purchased from Wichita by the Detroit Tigers, 
and became the first Western Association player to make it with a major 
league club.[5][6] Originally scheduled to remain with Wichita through 
the end of the 1906 season, the Tigers asked in late August that he report 
early.[1] Willett made his major league debut with Detroit on September 
5, 1906,[2] pitching a five-hitter against Chicago.[6] In the final month 
of the 1906 season, Willett appeared in three games, all as a starter, 
and compiled a 0–3 record with a 3.96 ERA.[2] In 1907, Willett saw limited 
action with the Tigers, appearing in 10 games, six as a starter, and compiled 
a 1–5 record with a 3.70 ERA in 48-2/3 inning pitched.[2] Willett became 
a regular starting pitcher for the 1908 Detroit Tigers team that won the 
American League pennant. He appeared in 30 games, 23 as a starter, and 
compiled a 15–8 record with 2.28 ERA and 77 strikeouts in 197-1/3 inning 
pitched.[2] Willett's best season was 1909 when he appeared in 41 games, 
34 as a starter, and compiled a 21–10 record with a 2.34 ERA. He ranked 
among the American League leaders with 21 wins (third) and a .677 winning 
percentage (sixth). He also appeared in two games as a relief pitcher in 
the 1909 World Series, giving up no earned runs and three hits in 7-2/3 
innings pitched against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[2][7] Willett had another 
strong season in 1910. He appeared in 37 games, 25 as a starter, and compiled 
a 16–11 record and a 2.37 ERA. He remained a regular starting pitcher for 
the Tigers through the 1913 season, compiling records of 13–14 in 1911, 
17–15 in 1912, and 13–14 in 1913.[2] In January 1914, Willett signed a 
contract to play for Mordecai Brown's St. Louis Terriers in the Federal 
League.[8] The Terriers finished in eighth place in the Federal League 
in 1914, and Willett compiled a career-worst 4–17 record with a 4.27 ERA 
in 27 games. In 1915, Willett returned to the Terriers, though he was converted 
into a relief pitcher. He appeared in 17 games, all but two games in relief, 
and compiled a 2–3 record with a 4.61 ERA. He appeared in his last major 
league game on September 23, 1915, at age 31.[2] Throughout his career, 
Willett had a propensity to hit batters with his pitches. He led the American 
League with 17 hit batsmen in 1912 and was among the league leaders seven 
straight years from 1908 to 1914. His career total of 106 hit batsmen ranks 
73rd in major league history.[2] Willett was an excellent fielding pitcher, 
consistently achieving a range factor in excess of the league average. 
Over his career, he had a range factor of 2.89 — 71 points higher than 
the league average of 2.09 for pitchers. In 1910, Willett had 113 assists 
in 224 innings pitched, meaning that he had an assist every other inning. 
His range factor of 3.38 in 1912 was a remarkable 1.43 points higher than 
the league average of 1.95 — meaning Willett got to nearly twice as many 
batted balls as the typical pitcher of his era.[2] Willett was also a good 
hitter for a pitcher, batting .268 with a .333 on-base percentage and a 
.427 slugging percentage in 1911. In 1913, he raised his batting average 
to .283.[2] Detroit trainer Harry Tuthill later recalled, "Ed always could 
hit, but he gave the fans a real thrill one afternoon at old Bennett Park, 
by clouting two home runs. And in that era of the comparatively dead ball, 
two home runs in a single game was quite a feat."[7] In 274 career games, 
Willett had a 102–100 win-loss record with 142 complete games, an earned 
run average of 3.08, 600 strikeouts, and 695 assists in 1,773 innings pitched.[2] 
Although his major league career ended with St. Louis in 1915, he continued 
to play in the minor leagues through the 1919 season, playing for the Memphis 
Chickasaws of the Southern Association in 1916, the New Orleans Pelicans 
of the Southern Association in 1917, and the Salt Lake City Bees of the 
Pacific Coast League in 1918 and 1919.[3] In 1920, he played for the Rexburg, 
Idaho, club in the Snake River-Yellowstone League. He began the 1921 season 
with the Blankenship team in the Pacific International League and also 
played for a Victoria, British Columbia, team in the first half of the 
1921 season.[9] On June 4, 1921, Willett took over as a player-manager 
for the Ogden Gunners in the Northern Utah League.[9] He led Ogden to the 
second half pennant.[10] He went on to manage the Grand Island Champions 
in 1922 and the Beatrice Blues in 1923, both clubs playing in the Nebraska 
State League.[3] Willett was married in 1908 and filed for divorce the 
following year in October 1909.[11][12] He remarried to Elizabeth White 
on October 25, 1910, in St. Louis.[13] He lived in Wellington, Kansas, 
in his later years and was managing an amateur baseball club there at the 
time of his death.[7] He died from a heart attack in 1934 at age 50 in 
Wellington.[7] He was found dead in his hotel room in Wellington.[10] He
