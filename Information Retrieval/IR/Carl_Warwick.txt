Carl Wayne Warwick (born February 27, 1937) is a retired American professional 
baseball player. An outfielder, he appeared in 530 games over six Major 
League seasons (1961–66) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, 
Houston Colt .45s, Baltimore Orioles and Chicago Cubs. During the 1964 
World Series, he set a record by reaching base in his first four plate 
appearances (three singles and one base on balls) as a pinch hitter,[1] 
as he helped his Cardinals defeat the New York Yankees in seven games. 
Warwick batted right-handed but threw left-handed; he stood 5 feet 10 inches 
(1.78 m) tall and weighed 170 pounds (77 kg). Born in Dallas, Texas, he 
graduated from Sunset High School and then played varsity baseball for 
Texas Christian University, leaving after his junior season to sign a bonus 
contract with the Dodgers. In his second pro season, 1959 with the Victoria 
Rosebuds, he led the Double-A Texas League in runs scored (129) and home 
runs (35), hit .331 and was selected Most Valuable Player. The following 
year, playing with the Triple-A St. Paul Saints, he was named an American 
Association all-star. Warwick made the Dodgers' 28-man early-season roster 
coming out of spring training in 1961, but was traded to the Cardinals 
May 30 with shortstop Bob Lillis for third baseman Daryl Spencer.[2] Struggling 
at the plate, he spent 52 games tuning up his batting stroke with the Triple-A 
Charleston Marlins. He then spent the next four full seasons at the Major 
League level. In 1962, in another early-season trade, the Cardinals dealt 
him to the expansion Colt .45s on May 7. Back in his native Texas, Warwick 
became Houston's regular center fielder, starting in 104 games, and his 
16 home runs ranked second on the club (to Román Mejías' 24). The Colt 
.45s moved Warwick to right field in 1963, and he got into a career-high 
150 games, but his power numbers declined (hitting only seven home runs 
with 47 runs batted in). Just prior to spring training in 1964, the Cardinals 
reacquired Warwick to serve as a spare outfielder and pinch hitter. He 
appeared in 88 games (49 defensively), and had 11 hits in 43 at bats in 
a pinch hitting role, as St. Louis put on a late-season surge to win the 
National League pennant on the closing day of the season. Then, in the 
1964 World Series, Warwick was called on to pinch hit five times by manager 
Johnny Keane. He proceeded to reach base four times in his first four appearances. 
His sixth-inning pinch single in Game 1 off Al Downing drove home the go-ahead 
run in the Cardinals' 9–5 triumph. He also singled and scored a run in 
Game 2 against Mel Stottlemyre, drew a base on balls from Jim Bouton in 
Game 3 and singled again off Downing in Game 4, to spark a rally capped 
by Ken Boyer's grand slam home run in a 4–3 Cardinal win. He fouled out 
off Bouton in Game 6 to complete a Series in which he batted .750 with 
a .800 on-base percentage, two runs scored and an RBI.[3] The 1964 Series 
was the high-water mark of Warwick's baseball career. He batted only .132 
in a 1965 season split between the Cardinals and Orioles, and then .227 
in 16 games for the last-place 1966 Cubs. He retired from baseball prior 
to the 1967 season, returning to Houston and operating real estate and 
travel agencies.[4] In the Majors, Warwick collected 363 hits, including
