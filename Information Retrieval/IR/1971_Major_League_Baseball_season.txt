The 1971 Major League Baseball season was the final season for the Senators 
in Washington, D.C., before the team's relocation to the Dallas-Fort Worth 
suburb Arlington for the following season, as the Texas Rangers, leaving 
the nation's capital without a baseball team of its own until 2005. This 
was the final season the majority of MLB teams wore wool flannel uniforms. 
The Pirates and Cardinals wore double knit uniforms of nylon and rayon 
throughout 1971, and the Orioles gradually phased out flannels, going all-double 
knit in time for the ALCS. By 1973, flannel uniforms completely disappeared 
from the MLB scene. Three of the four division races were anticlimactic; 
the only race was in the N.L. West between old rivals Los Angeles Dodgers 
and San Francisco Giants. The Giants led by 8.5 games on September 1 but 
the Dodgers chipped away. In mid September, the Dodgers won 8 in a row, 
including 5 over the Giants to narrow the gap to one game. But they could 
get no closer; ultimately both teams won on the final day of the season
