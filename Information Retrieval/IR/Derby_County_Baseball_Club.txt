The Derby County Baseball Club was a short-lived baseball club in Derby, 
England that played baseball until 1898 when football became the dominant 
sport. Baseball was introduced to Derby by Francis Ley, an industrialist 
who owned Ley's Malleable Castings. Following a visit to the United States 
of America in 1889, Ley decided that, as a way of ensuring a healthier 
and more productive workforce, an investment should be made in promoting 
recreation for his workers. During his journey to the States, Ley had seen 
the way in which baseball fields had been laid out by companies and factories 
for the use by their workers and decided to follow suit on his return to 
Derby. Consequently, Ley had the Baseball Ground built; a 12-acre (49,000Â m2) 
park for the use of workers with cricket and baseball facilities. The club 
ran away with the first championship after the National Baseball League 
of Great Britain and Ireland was established in 1890. However, pressure 
from other teams in the league over the number of American players on the 
Derby team forced Derby to resign at the end of the league's first season, 
though the baseball club itself lasted until 1898. The Baseball Ground 
continued to be used under that name as the home of football's Derby County
