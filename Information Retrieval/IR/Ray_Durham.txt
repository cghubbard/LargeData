Ray Durham (born November 30, 1971) is a former Major League Baseball second 
baseman. He is a 14-year major league veteran owning a .277 lifetime batting 
average with 1,249 runs scored, 2,054 hits, 440 doubles, 79 triples, 192 
home runs, 875 run batted in (RBIs) and 273 stolen bases in 1,975 career 
games. He graduated from Harry P. Harding High School (now Harding University 
High School) in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1990, where he played baseball 
and football. He was on the state select baseball team and was an honorable 
mention All-American defensive back. He did not attend college as he began 
playing minor league baseball with the Gulf Coast White Sox. Ray Durham 
was originally a 5th round pick by the Chicago White Sox in 1990. Durham 
has not played since the 2008 season and still resides in North Carolina 
with his wife Regina and their four children. Durham was a member of the 
Chicago White Sox from 1995 to 2002. Durham was a leadoff hitter during 
these years of his career. Durham established himself as one of baseball's 
better leadoff hitters with above league average on-base percentages and 
averaging well over 20 stolen bases and 10 home runs per season. His performance 
from 2000 to 2002 was exceptional. By posting at least 15 home runs with 
100 runs, 20 steals, a .450 slugging percentage and 65 RBIs in three consecutive 
seasons, Durham became just the 10th player in baseball history to accomplish 
such a feat. Durham is in great company, with the list including Hall of 
Famers Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, and Joe Morgan, as well as current superstars 
Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez. Durham left Chicago as the club's all-time 
leader in leadoff home runs (20), while ranking fifth in steals (219), 
seventh in doubles (249) and extra base hits (408) and eighth in runs (784). 
Durham was traded to the Oakland Athletics before the 2002 baseball trading 
deadline for right-handed pitcher Jon Adkins. Durham's hitting helped push 
the A's into the 2002 playoffs. The Durham deal was a prototypical "rent 
a player" trade that can occur at the trading deadline. The A's, who constantly 
rank among the bottom teams in baseball in player salaries, made a trade 
for the short-term playoff push. With the A's limited finances, it was 
well known in baseball circles that Durham would most likely re-sign elsewhere. 
After the 2002 season, Durham signed a three-year contract US$20.1 million 
with the San Francisco Giants with a $7 million player option for a fourth 
year that was later exercised.[1] The health Durham displayed during the 
earlier years of his career vanished. Between 1996 and 2002, Durham appeared 
in at least 150 games each season, but in 2003 he only appeared in 110 
games and in 2004 he appeared in 120. Recurring hamstring injuries and 
other injuries caused Durham to spend time on the disabled list. The injuries 
also hampered Durham's success when he was on the field. Durham's running 
game and stolen bases dropped as Durham tried to protect his hamstrings 
from reinjury. Despite these injuries, Durham did post solid offensive 
numbers during his time in the line up. Because of Durham's injuries that 
limited his speed and the recurring injuries to Giants outfielder Moisés 
Alou, Durham was given the opportunity to bat fifth in the batting order 
more often. Durham was batted fifth regularly in 2006. In the 2005–2006 
off-season, Durham adopted a new work out and strength conditioning routine. 
The result was a healthy Durham and perhaps his best offensive year in 
2006 when in 137 games he batted .293 with career highs in slugging percentage 
(.538), home runs (26), RBIs (93). Durham re-signed with the Giants for 
a two-year contract worth $14.5 million on December 2, 2006.[2] Giants 
general manager Brian Sabean lauded Durham for making an impressive transition 
from a lead off hitter to a middle of the order run producer.[3] After 
re-signing with the Giants, Durham struggled in 2007. Durham called the 
season "embarrassing" and the "worst" of his career. Durham admitted that 
his defense had suffered because he was thinking about his hitting while 
on defense. Durham claimed he had trouble adjusting to the new strategy 
to pitch against him, which included throwing cutters inside and throwing 
curveballs on the outside corner. Some Giants fans and radio personalities 
criticized Durham's performance in 2006 as being motivated by money because 
2006 was Durham's contract year. Durham denied these claims and claimed 
that almost every year is a contract year.[4] On August 21, 2007, against 
Sergio Mitre of the Florida Marlins, Durham fouled a pitch at the plate 
that bounced up and hit his groin. He would go on to single on the next 
pitch. "I was swinging at the first thing so I could sit down", Durham 
said. "Then, I end up with a knock and I had to run from first to third. 
It did not feel good".[5] On September 9, 2007, Durham hit a pinch-hit 
three-run homer in the eighth inning to help San Francisco beat the Los 
Angeles Dodgers 4–2. On June 12, 2008, Durham got his 2000th hit off Colorado 
Rockies pitcher Greg Reynolds. On July 20, 2008, Durham, was traded to 
the Milwaukee Brewers for minor league pitcher Steve Hammond and minor 
league outfielder Darren Ford. Durham filed for free agency on November 
1, 2008. He retired after rejecting a minor league deal from the Washington
