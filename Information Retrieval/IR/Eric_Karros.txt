Eric Peter Karros (born November 4, 1967) is a former American professional 
baseball first baseman. Karros played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 
1991 to 2004 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago Cubs and Oakland Athletics. 
He was the National League Rookie of the Year in 1992 and won a Silver 
Slugger Award in 1995. Karros was born in Hackensack, New Jersey and graduated 
from Patrick Henry High School in San Diego, California.[1] He attended 
UCLA, where he received a degree in economics. Karros was selected by the 
Los Angeles Dodgers in the sixth round of the 1988 Major League Baseball 
draft. He made his Major League debut as a pinch runner on September 1, 
1991 against the Chicago Cubs. He made his first start, at first base, 
on September 4, 1991 against the St. Louis Cardinals, when he was 0-for-3 
with two strikeouts. Karros recorded his first Major League hit as a pinch 
hitter in the bottom of the 12th inning against Cincinnati Reds pitcher 
Milt Hill on September 16, 1991. It was a two-run RBI double to left field, 
his only hit in 14 batting appearances during the 1991 season. In his first 
at-bat of the 1992 season, on April 9 against the San Diego Padres, Karros 
hit a two-run shot to deep left field off of Craig Lefferts for his first 
career home run. He became a full-time starter for the Dodgers that season, 
appearing in 149 games and hitting 20 home runs while driving in 88 runs. 
He was named the 1992 National League Rookie of the Year. Karros put up 
consistent numbers throughout his career with the Dodgers, with a batting 
average just under .270 and an average of almost 25 home runs a year. No 
Dodger in the organization's history compiled more 30 home run 100 RBI 
seasons than Karros (five, matched only by Duke Snider and Gil Hodges). 
Karros also remains the only player in Dodger history to hit two homers 
in the same inning. 1999 was his best statistical year with the Dodgers, 
when he hit .304 with 34 home runs and 112 RBI. His career 270 home runs 
as a Los Angeles Dodger are the most in the team's history, and third amongst 
Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers. On December 2, 2002, he was traded along 
with Mark Grudzielanek to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for Todd Hundley 
and Chad Hermansen. Karros started the season as the Cubs backup first 
basemen, but took over the role at the beginning of June after Hee-seop 
Choi was injured in a collision with Cub teammate Kerry Wood. After playing 
the 2003 season with the Cubs he was granted free agency from the team 
at the end of the year. In 114 games with the Cubs, he hit .286 with 12 
home runs and 40 RBI. He then signed with the Oakland Athletics before 
the start of the 2004 season. Karrosâ€™ final MLB game was on July 21, 2004, 
and he was released by the Athletics on August 3, 2004. He only appeared 
in 40 games with the team, hitting .194 with 2 home runs and 11 RBI. Karros 
works as a color commentator for baseball on Fox. He previously worked 
for Fox Sports in 2004 doing the pregame shows for the Major League Baseball 
playoffs, and ESPN until 2006 as a studio and game analyst. He previously 
worked on KCAL-TV in Los Angeles, where he did the pre-game show for Dodger 
games. Karros is a broadcaster on four video games MLB 11: The Show, MLB 
12: The Show, MLB 13: The Show and MLB 14: The Show along with Matt Vasgersian, 
Dave Campbell and Steve Lyons. Karros was hired to call regional games 
for Fox Saturday Baseball in 2007. He was promoted to the No.2 team in 
2011 primarily calling games with Thom Brennaman. In March 2014 it was 
announced that Brennaman and Karros would continue to call FOX games together, 
and the pair called the first regular season game ever on Fox Sports 1.
