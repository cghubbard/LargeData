Fred Wilpon (born November 22, 1936)[1] is a real estate developer, baseball 
executive and the majority owner of the New York Mets. Wilpon was raised 
in a Jewish family[2] in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.[3] His father, Nathan Wilpon, 
managed a funeral home.[4] Wilpon attended Lafayette High School in Brooklyn.[4] 
Wilpon was a big fan of baseball and pitched his freshman year in college 
until he was injured. In 1958, he graduated with a B.A. from the University 
of Michigan.[3][5] After college, he sold calculators for a time while 
his wife worked as a secretary for Branch Rickey, the former president 
of the Brooklyn Dodgers, whom he knew from the neighborhood.[6] In 1972, 
he cofounded Sterling Equities, a commercial real estate development company, 
with his brother-in-law Saul Katz.[7] They built a development of townhouses 
in Tarrytown, a suburb in Westchester County which was very successful.[6] 
Seeking to minimize their tax obligations, they purchased real estate throughout 
the country that had favorable tax treatment[6] which turned out to be 
a boon since they were unknowingly buying property at the bottom of the 
market.[6] In 1980, Wilpon bought a one-percent stake in the Mets when 
Charles Shipman Payson sold the team, with publishing company Doubleday 
& Co. holding the remaining interest. In 1986, Doubleday president Nelson 
Doubleday, Jr. sold Doubleday & Co., the owner of his interest in the Mets, 
to Bertelsmann AG.[2] Wilpon had a right of first refusal in the event 
of a sale and threatened to exercise it.[2] In the resulting settlement, 
Doubleday and Wilpon agreed to purchase the Mets for $81 million becoming 
equal partners in the team.[2] In 2002, the Wilpon Family purchased the 
remaining 50% of the Mets from Doubleday for $391 million. Wilpon served 
as president of the team between 1980 and 2002, as Chief Executive Officer 
since 1980 and as Chairman of the Board since 2003. Wilpon currently serves 
as Chairman of Sterling Equities. Wilpon was one of the investors who invested 
a significant amount of money with Bernard Madoff which was lost when the 
Ponzi scheme collapsed in December 2008.[8] It was reported that Wilpon 
had "lost" about $700 million because of Madoff, which has led to speculation 
that he may be forced to sell the team.[9] Since then Wilpon has said that 
his losses were "substantially less" than that figure.[10] Reports later 
surfaced that Wilpon and his family actually made about $300 million with 
Madoff and had not lost money as previously reported.[11] As a result, 
in December 2010, Wilpon was named in a lawsuit filed by Irving Picard 
on behalf of the victims of Madoff's investment scandal and on January 
28, 2011 Wilpon issued a statement seeking “one or more strategic partners” 
interested in buying 20 to 25% interest in the Mets to offset pending losses 
due to litigation (which may total up to $1 billion).[12] Wilpon and his 
partner and brother-in-law Saul Katz were involved in another Ponzi scheme 
which was orchestrated by Samuel Israel III and they were forced to pay 
$13 million to investors when Israel's hedge fund collapsed.[13] It was 
revealed that Wilpon utilized Madoff in running the Mets' finances. It 
became a common practice to negotiate deferred money into players' contracts 
and then put that money with Madoff to invest because they were able to 
make money for themselves before paying players.[14] The lawsuit also contends 
that Madoff funds were used to cover team expenses such as payroll and 
its minor league club in Brooklyn,[15] as well as financing the creation 
of the cable network SportsNet New York and Citi Field.[16] In an interview 
while in prison, Madoff claimed that Wilpon "knew nothing" about his Ponzi 
scheme.[17] After it was reported that Major League Baseball loaned the 
Mets $25 million in November 2010 to shore up their finances, Wilpon is 
now willing to sell up to a 49% ownership stake of the team[18] at a cost 
of $200 million.[19] On May 26, 2011, it was reported that Wilpon has agreed 
to sell a minority share of the Mets to David Einhorn, president of the 
hedge fund Greenlight Capital,[20] but ended negotiations on September 
1.[21] After the Mets received a $40 million loan from Bank of America 
in November 2011, Major League Baseball is monitoring the situation closely 
and is prepared to take control of the team from Wilpon if he defaults 
on the loan.[22] The trustee to the Madoff trust, Irving H. Picard, had 
declared that the Wilpons had enriched themselves over many years of profitable 
investing with Mr. Madoff while ignoring repeated warnings that he might 
have been a fraud. On March 19, 2012, Wilpon agreed to settle Picard's 
lawsuit for $162 million.[23] The Judy and Fred Wilpon Family Foundation 
donated $5 million to the University of Michigan's College of Literature, 
Science, and the Arts to establish the Irene and Morris B. Kessler Presidential 
Scholarship Fund named in honor of his wife's parents, Romanian immigrant 
and dentist, Morris Kessler, and Irene Nass.[24] The Wilpons have also 
donated $5 million to create the University of Michigan Bone & Joint Injury 
Prevention & Rehabilitation Center, and $4 million for the Wilpon Baseball 
and Softball Complex.[24] Wilpon is married to Judy Kessler whom he met 
in college. She is a 1958 graduate of the University of Michigan.[3] His 
daughter, Robin Wilpon, is married to Phillip Wachtler, son of former Chief 
Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, Sol Wachtler.[25][26] His son, 
Jeff Wilpon, is COO of the Mets and the executive vice-president of Sterling 
Equities.[27] His son, Bruce Wilpon, is community manager & limited partner 
at Lerer Hippeau Ventures.[27][28] As a teenager Wilpon was a teammate 
of Baseball Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax on Brooklyn's Lafayette High School 
baseball team. Wilpon and Koufax remain close friends, with Koufax an annual 
visitor at the Mets' spring training facility in Port St. Lucie, Florida
