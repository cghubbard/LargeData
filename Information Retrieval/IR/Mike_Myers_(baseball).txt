Michael "Mike" Stanley Myers (born June 26, 1969) is a former left-handed 
Major League Baseball relief pitcher. Myers attended high school at Crystal 
Lake Central High School in Illinois[1] and later attended Iowa State University, 
where he played college baseball for the Iowa State Cyclones baseball team. 
In the summers of 1988 and 1989, he pitched for the Brewster Whitecaps 
of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Myers was in the minor leagues for parts 
of six seasons. In his final four minor league seasons, he was 14-27 with 
a 4.29 ERA. He was used primarily as a starting pitcher until 1995, when 
he pitched 42 games, all in relief, for the Charlotte Knights and Toledo 
Mud Hens.[2] The San Francisco Giants drafted Myers in the fourth round 
of the 1990 Major League Baseball Draft. Before he ever played for the 
Giants at the major league level, he was drafted by the Florida Marlins 
in the 1992 Rule 5 draft. He made his major league debut with the Marlins 
on April 25, 1995, pitching an inning of scoreless relief.[3] In August 
of that year, the Marlins traded Myers to the Detroit Tigers as the player 
to be named later from an earlier deal between the two clubs, in which 
the Marlins acquired Buddy Groom. He went a combined 1-9 for Detroit between 
the 1996 and 1997 seasons. He did lead the Majors in appearances, appearing 
in 83 and 88 games respectively in both seasons. Myers pitched for Detroit 
through the 1997 season. After the season, Myers was traded by the Tigers 
with Rick Greene and Santiago Perez to the Milwaukee Brewers for Bryce 
Florie. Myers pitched for the Brewers for two seasons, pitching in 70 games 
in 1998 and 71 in 1999. After the 1999 season, the Brewers traded Myers 
to the Colorado Rockies for Curt Leskanic. In 2000, Myers had the best 
season of his career while pitching half his games in Coors Field. He had 
a 2.05 ERA in 43 games at Coors Field in 2000. He finished the season with 
a career low 1.99 ERA in 78 games. The following season, Myers pitched 
in 73 games for the Rockies, going 2-3 with a 3.60 ERA. Before the 2002 
season, the Rockies traded Myers to the Arizona Diamondbacks for JD Closser 
and Jack Cust. In 2002, he had a 4.38 ERA in 69 games while in 2003 he 
had a 5.70 ERA in 64 games. He signed as a free agent with the Seattle 
Mariners for the 2004 season, but was selected off of waivers by the Boston 
Red Sox in August 2004. He signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Cardinals 
in the 2004-05 offseason, but was traded back to the Red Sox for two minor 
league players before the 2005 season began. During the 2005-06 offseason, 
Myers signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees. He got off to an 
amazing start in 2006, with an ERA under 2 by mid July. But he then struggled 
down the stretch. One big highlight late in the season was the big outs 
he got in Boston during a 5-game series against the Red Sox. The Yankees 
released Myers in August 2007, and he signed with the Chicago White Sox. 
On January 25, 2008, Myers signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers to a minor 
league contract and was invited to spring training.[4] Myers did not make 
the Dodgers team, but was assigned to play for the Las Vegas 51s in Triple-A. 
He asked for his release from the 51s on April 25 and became a free agent. 
On March 17, 2009, Myers was hired as a special assistant to the head of 
the Major League Baseball Players Association, Donald Fehr.[5] Myers is 
a submarine pitcher, throwing the ball with his arm at or below his shoulder 
rather than above. When Myers was with the Tigers, Baseball Hall of Famer 
Al Kaline, then a broadcaster with the team, suggested that Myers experiment 
with the submarine style of pitching. His luck improved in his next two 
appearances against Baltimore, retiring three batters in a row both times. 
"Kaline suggested my throwing sidearm to give me a little bit of funk and 
mystery against left-handed hitters. After what I did against Baltimore, 
I just kept going from there," Myers said.[6] He throws two different breaking 
balls with a deceptive movement that disconcerts opposing hitters, especially 
left-handed hitters. Myers is particularly durable as well. Since his first 
full major league season in 1996, he has appeared in at least 60 games 
every year, topping 80 appearances in his first two seasons to lead the 
league both years, and over 70 in his next four seasons. Myers's primary 
role was as a left-handed relief specialist (known in the sport as a "LOOGY, 
or "Lefty One-Out Guy"), against baseball's left-handed hitters, though 
the statistics say he has difficulty performing his job against the very 
best of the group. With the Rockies and Diamondbacks, he would frequently 
come into games to face Giants slugger Barry Bonds, and was similarly used 
by the Red Sox against Hideki Matsui of the Yankees and by the Yankees 
against David Ortiz of the Red Sox. However, through the end of the 2007 
season, Bonds is 8-for-25 (.320) with a home run and eight walks against 
Myers, while Ortiz is 5-for-17 (.294) with a home run and two walks, and
