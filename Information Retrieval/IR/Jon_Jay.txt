Jonathan Henry "Jon" Jay (born March 15, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball center fielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals and the San Diego Padres. A 
product of the University of Miami (UM), he played college baseball for 
the Hurricanes and was the St. Louis Cardinals' second round selection 
in 2006. He made his MLB debut for the Cardinals in 2010 after batting 
.301 with 34 home runs, .803 on-base plus slugging percentage and 61 stolen 
bases in 409 minor league games. The starting center fielder for four consecutive 
National League Championship Series (NLCS)-qualifying clubs as a Cardinal 
(2011−14), Jay was a World Series champion in 2011. Between 2011 and 2013, 
he established an errorless streak for as the record for NL center fielders 
at 245 games. He finished tenth in 2012 in the NL in both batting average 
and on-base percentage. After wrist injuries limited his effectiveness 
in 2015, the Cardinals traded Jay to the Padres. Active in the community, 
he has hosted celebrity bowling tournaments for charity. Jon Jay was born 
in Miami, Florida, and spent his youth there. He went to middle school 
at George Washington Carver Middle School, part of the Miami-Dade County 
Public Schools district, and attended high school at Christopher Columbus 
High School, in Miami. Showing exceptional baseball skill in high school, 
Jay played on the state championship-winning team during his senior year 
in 2003. He then received a scholarship at the University of Miami (UM) 
and played for the Miami Hurricanes baseball team. During his two years 
at UM, he batted a combined .387 with 31 doubles, four triples, seven home 
runs (HR), and 108 runs batted in (RBI) in 120 games played.[1] The Cardinals 
selected him from UM in the second round (74th overall) of the 2006 MLB 
draft.[2] Jon Jay made his Major League debut on April 26, 2010 with the 
St. Louis Cardinals, after beginning his second consecutive season with 
the Memphis Redbirds. During his rookie season, he played in 105 games 
and made 323 plate appearances (PA), batting .300 with 19 doubles and a 
.359 on-base percentage (OBP). In the outfield, he played all three positions. 
Stationed mainly in right field, he collected five assists. On July 27, 
2011, the Cardinals traded starting center fielder Colby Rasmus to the 
Toronto Blue Jays, clearing the way for Jay to take over as the regular 
center fielder. That season, he led the team in games played (159) and 
batted .297 with a career-high 10 HR. In Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, 
Jay had a key hit in the 10th inning and later scored the tying run off 
of a little blooper into centerfield by Lance Berkman. On May 15, 2012, 
Jay was moved to the 15-day disabled list due to lingering shoulder soreness 
after running into the outfield wall the month before, but he returned 
shortly thereafter.[3] For the year, he finished with career-bests in batting 
average (.305) and OBP (.373), both of which placed tenth in the National 
League (NL). His 19 stolen bases (SB) were another career best. He hit 
four HR, collected 40 RBI, 22 doubles and scored 70 runs. Between August 
24, 2011 and July 30, 2013, Jay established a new NL all-time errorless 
streak record for center fielders at 245 games against the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
It is also the longest streak for all Cardinals outfielders.[4] Curt Flood, 
a former Cardinal, owned the previous center field record of 226 games 
spanning from Sep 3, 1965 to Jun 2, 1967.[5] With increased playing time 
in 2013, Jay established career-highs in PA (628), doubles (27), runs (75), 
and BB (52), and RBI (67). However, his batting average (.276) and SLG 
(.370) slumped to a career-lows. He was third among NL center fielders 
in games played (153), fourth in putouts (335), first in double plays (three), 
and second in fielding percentage (.997). Conversely, advanced defensive 
metrics showed he was ten runs below average for center fielders for defensive 
runs saved (DRS), ranking 32nd in MLB. From 2011–13, Fangraphs rated his 
arm at 21st out of 21 centerfielders who played at least 2,000 innings. 
Runners advanced for extra bases on Jay in 60 percent of plays.[6] The 
Cardinals agreed with Jay on a one-year $3.25 million contract on January 
17, 2014, to avoid arbitration. Through 2013, Jay had a career batting 
average of .300 with a .356 OBP and a .400 SLG.[7] After the Cardinals 
acquired outfielder Peter Bourjos in a trade with the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim during the offseason of 2013, Jay's role on the club was expected 
to be reduced during 2014. Bourjos' impressive defensive ability was one 
of the main reasons of the trade, as Jay's 2013 defensive campaign was 
probably the worst of his career. But after a poor offensive April for 
Bourjos, Jay's playing time started to increase throughout the season, 
as Bourjos found himself on the bench more and more. By the end of the 
season, Jay finished batting .303, with three home runs while driving in 
46 runs. Although appearing in only 17 less games in 2014 than in 2013, 
Jay had 135 less at bats, and could not contend for the batting title, 
where at one point in September he was batting well over .320, which was 
higher than the final .319 batting average of Justin Morneau, who won the 
batting title. During the postseason, where Jay had historically struggled 
throughout his career, he batted .478, going 14-29 throughout the NLDS 
and NLCS.[8] In the off-season preceding the 2015 season, Jay had surgery 
on the left wrist, which did not heal completely.[9] He struggled through 
other injuries on the same wrist, such as a bone bruise and tendinitis, 
hampering his ability to hit effectively.[10] He missed a number of games 
in the month of May, and another 57 from July 1 to September 4.[11] On 
December 8, 2015, Jay was traded to the San Diego Padres in exchange for 
Jedd Gyorko.[12][13] After a productive first couple of months of the season 
for the Padres, Jay suffered a broken forearm on June 19th and was placed 
on the DL on June 28th. He was reactivated on September 6th.[14] At various 
times, he has been nicknamed "The Federalist", "The Founding Father", and 
"The Chief Justice" in honor of the U.S. Founding Father John Jay and his 
contributions to The Federalist Papers.[15][16] Shortly into the 2016 season, 
NBC 7 San Diego lead sports reporter Derek Togerson popularized "The Federalist", 
which quickly became popular with Padres fans. Razzball.com originally 
started calling him The Federalist back in 2011.[17] On January 28, 2011, 
Jon Jay hosted a charity bowling event at Lucky Strikes Lanes in Miami 
Beach, Florida.[18] Called Jon Jay's Celebrity Bowling Challenge, an estimated 
$25,000 were accumulated throughout the almost four-hour event and went 
to Chapman Partnership, involved in homeless centers throughout the Miami-area. 
Jon and his family had been involved in charities just like Chapman Partnership 
throughout his childhood. Among the twenty Major League Baseball attendees 
were Yonder Alonso, J. P. Arencibia, Gio Gonzalez, Drew Storen, Chris Marrero, 
Tyler Greene, Allen Craig, Lance Lynn, John Mayberry, Gaby Sánchez, Manny 
Machado, and Mike Lowell. Chris Bosh was also present.[19] In May, 2014, 
Jay hosted another bowling event, this time with Allen Craig. They named 
it the Jay-Craig Celebrity Bowl and held it at the Flamingo Bowl in downtown 
St. Louis. The proceeds benefited Great Circle, a nonprofit organization 
that provides behavioral health services autism, educational challenges, 
emotional health, in-home crisis intervention, foster care and adoption, 
adventure therapy and psychological trauma recovery.[20] In December 2015, 
Jay accompanied an expedition to Cuba with former Cardinals player and 
manager Joe Torre, and then-Cardinals catcher Brayan Peña. It was MLB's 
first visit there since 1999, and one anticipated as an important step 
to help normalize relations with the United States that had begun to ease
