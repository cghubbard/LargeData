often seen in young pitchers under the age of sixteen. The pitching motion 
causes a valgus stress to be placed on the elbow joint which can cause 
damage to the structures of the elbow, resulting in an avulsion of the 
medial epiphyseal plate (growth plate). The first diagnosis of the injury 
in 1960 set off a firestorm of controversy regarding how much youth baseball 
players can and should be asked to pitch. The ailment even appeared in 
the comic strip Peanuts in 1963 when Charlie Brown received a diagnosis.[2]
