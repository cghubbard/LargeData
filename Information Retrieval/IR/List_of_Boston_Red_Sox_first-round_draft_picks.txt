The Boston Red Sox are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in 
Boston, Massachusetts. They play in the American League East division. 
Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the Red Sox have selected 
70 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player 
Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning amateur 
baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball 
clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous 
season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving 
the first pick.[1] In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous 
off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] Of the 
70 players picked in the first round by the Sox, 31 have been pitchers, 
the most of any position; 20 of these were right-handed, while 11 were 
left-handed. 19 of the players picked in the initial round were outfielders, 
while nine shortstops, four first basemen, four catchers, and two second 
basemen were selected. The team also selected one player at third base.[3] 
Ten of the players came from high schools or universities in the state 
of California, while Texas and South Carolina follow with seven and six 
players, respectively. The Red Sox have also drafted two players from outside 
the United States: Chris Reitsma (1996) from Canada and Reymond Fuentes 
(2009) from Puerto Rico.[3] Two of their first-round picks have won championships 
with the franchise. Outfielder Trot Nixon (1993) was on the 2004 championship 
team[4] and outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury (2005) played with the 2007 championship 
team.[5] Nomar Garciaparra (1994) won the Rookie of the Year Award with 
the Red Sox in 1997.[6] Jim Rice (drafted in 1971), Roger Clemens (drafted 
in 1983), and Mo Vaughn (drafted in 1989) have each won a Most Valuable 
Player Award with the team.[7][8][9] Clemens also won three Cy Young Awards 
with the Red Sox and another four with other teams for a total of seven, 
more than any other pitcher in MLB history.[8][10] Clay Buchholz (2005) 
threw a no-hitter, the 17th in Red Sox franchise history, in his second 
major league start, tying him with Wilson √Ålvarez for the second-fastest 
no-hitter by an MLB pitcher.[11] Jim Rice is the only first-round pick 
of the Red Sox in the Baseball Hall of Fame, inducted in 2009.[7] The Red 
Sox have made 20 selections in the supplemental round of the draft. They 
have never made the first overall selection in the draft.[3][12] They have 
had 30 compensatory picks since the institution of the First-Year Player 
Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a 
particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season,[2][13][V] or, 
more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.[14] 
The Red Sox have failed to sign two first-round picks across their draft 
history. First, Jimmy Hack (1970) did not sign but they received no compensation 
pick.[15] The Red Sox also did not sign Greg McMurtry (1986)[16] and were 
given the 32nd pick of the 1987 draft in compensation which they used to
