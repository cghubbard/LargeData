The 1974 Cincinnati Reds season was a season in American baseball. It consisted 
of the Reds finishing in second place in the National League West with 
a record of 98-64, four games behind the NL West and pennant-winning Los 
Angeles Dodgers. The Reds were managed by Sparky Anderson, and played their 
home games at Riverfront Stadium. The Reds' second-place finish was really 
more about the Los Angeles Dodgers improvements more than any perceived 
failures by Cincinnati. The Reds' 98 victories were second-best in all 
of baseball to the Dodgers' 102 victories. The Dodgers had finished in 
second place from 1970-73, three of those years the Reds won the NL West. 
In the offseason, the Dodgers added center fielder Jimmy Wynn in a trade 
from Houston and acquired future Cy Young Award winning reliever Mike Marshall 
from Montreal. The Reds did add a solid starter in 12-game winner Clay 
Kirby in the offseason. With All-Star shortstop Dave Concepcion fully recovered 
from a broken ankle he suffered at mid-season in '73, and All-Star catcher 
Johnny Bench having another MVP caliber season, the Reds were not going 
to relinquish their divisional crown easily. Just as they had done the 
previous season, the Dodgers started hot and gained a large lead on the 
Reds in the National League West Division, due largely to their success 
against the Reds heads-up. The Dodgers won 9 of their first 10 games against 
the Reds. After losing 6-3 to the Dodgers on August 5, the Reds trailed 
the Dodgers by 7 1/2 games despite a solid 66-45 record. By Aug. 15, the 
Reds had cut the lead to 1 1/2 games after winning the first two of a three-game 
set at Dodger Stadium marking 9 losses in 11 games for Los Angeles. In 
the third game, Jimmy Wynn hit a seventh-inning grand-slam to break open 
a tight game as the Dodgers rallied to a 7-1 victory, which helped keep 
the Dodgers ahead in the NL West. The Reds would get no closer than two 
games the rest of the season. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position;
