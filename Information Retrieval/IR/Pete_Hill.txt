Negro league Baseball John Preston "Pete" Hill (October 12, 1882 – December 
19, 1951) was an American outfielder and manager in baseball's Negro leagues 
from 1899 to 1925. He played for the Philadelphia Giants, Leland Giants, 
Chicago American Giants, Detroit Stars, Milwaukee Bears, and Baltimore 
Black Sox. Hill starred for teams owned by Negro league executive Rube 
Foster for much of his playing career. He was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 2006. Though he was thought to have been born Joseph Preston 
Hill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on October 12, 1880,[6] recent research 
has shown that Hill's first name was John and that he was probably born 
on October 12, 1882 in Culpeper County, Virginia; some sources indicate 
a birth year of 1883 or 1884.[7] Hill lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 
at the time of the 1900 Census. The 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m), 215 pound Hill 
was considered the most important member of three of the most talented 
Negro league teams to ever play. Author William NcNeil referred to Hill 
as "black baseball's first superstar", citing Hill's speed, his strong 
throwing arm, and his ability to hit for batting average or for power. 
He spent much of his career playing for teams run by Negro league pioneer 
Rube Foster. Foster usually built his teams around Hill.[8] From 1904 through 
1907, he was the star left fielder for Sol White's great-hitting Philadelphia 
Giants. Also during this time, like many Negro league stars of the era, 
Hill spent some time in a few other leagues, mainly the Cuban Winter League. 
In 1910-11, he led the league in batting average (.365). Foster decided 
to form the Chicago American Giants, which chiefly consisted of Foster's 
best players from Leland, including Hill, who was made team captain. In 
the first year of the American Giants' existence, Hill came to be known 
as one of its best hitters. He hit safely in 115 of 116 games that year 
against all levels of competition. While he faced mostly minor-league level 
opponents, some of his opposition consisted of major league quality pitching, 
including Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, Nap Rucker and Mordecai Brown. Cumberland 
Posey, owner of the Homestead Grays and famous black baseball player, manager 
and executive, once called Hill "the most consistent hitter of his time." 
He also maintained that the left-handed Hill could "hit both left-handers 
and right-handers equally well". Besides being a top-class hitter, Hill 
was known to have great power, although not enough home run and RBI numbers 
were preserved for precise statistics, as was the case with other Negro 
league players. Sportswriter and fellow player Jimmy Smith put Hill on 
his 1909 "All American Team."[9] While playing for Foster, the two had 
a close friendship and in 1919, Foster asked Hill to become the player/manager 
of the newly formed Detroit Stars. Hill was then 36 years old, but agreed 
to take on the job. By his third year, Hill was respected by his players 
and continued to hit, with an average of .388 in 1921 to lead the Stars. 
After his stint with Detroit, Hill went on to play with three more Negro 
league clubs, also spending time in other leagues. As his playing career 
came to an end (he played his last game with the Baltimore Black Sox in 
1925), Hill attempted to follow in Foster's footsteps and take a baseball 
front office job. His final position in pro baseball was as the field manager 
of the 1924–25 Baltimore Black Sox. Hill died at age 69 in Buffalo, New 
York, and he was buried in the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. 
In a poll taken in 1952 by the African-American weekly Pittsburgh Courier 
poll named Hill the fourth-best outfielder in Negro league history, behind 
Oscar Charleston, Monte Irvin and Cristóbal Torriente. An all-star team 
compiled by Cumberland Posey in 1944 also listed Hill as one of the greatest 
Negro league outfielders.[10] Hill was inducted into the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 2006 along with 16 other Negro league and pre-Negro league figures.[11] 
In late July 2010, the Hall of Fame announced that it would commission 
a new plaque to correct Hill's name from Joseph Preston Hill to John Preston 
Hill. The new plaque was unveiled at a ceremony on October 12, 2010 attended
