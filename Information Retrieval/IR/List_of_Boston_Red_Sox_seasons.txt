The Boston Red Sox are a professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. 
From 1912 to the present, the Red Sox have played in Fenway Park.[1] The 
"Red Sox" name originates from the iconic uniform feature. They are sometimes 
nicknamed the "BoSox", a combination of "Boston" and "Sox" (as opposed 
to the "ChiSox"), the "Crimson Hose", and "the Olde Towne Team".[2] Most 
fans simply refer to them as the Sox. One of the American League's eight 
charter franchises, the club was founded in Boston in 1901. They were a 
dominant team in the early 20th century, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in the first World Series in 1903. They won four more championships by 
1918, and then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball 
history. Many attributed the phenomenon to the "Curse of the Bambino" said 
to have been caused by the trade of Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees in 
1920. The drought was ended and the "curse" reversed in 2004, when the 
team won their sixth World Series Championship.[3] The Red Sox led all 
MLB teams in average road attendance in 2007, while the small capacity 
of Fenway caused them to rank 11th in home attendance.[4][5] Every home 
game from May 15, 2003 through April 10, 2013 was sold out—a span of 820 
games over nearly ten years.[6] The following table describes the Red Sox's
