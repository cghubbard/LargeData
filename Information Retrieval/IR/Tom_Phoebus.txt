Thomas Harold Phoebus (born April 7, 1942), is a former starting pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played with the Baltimore Orioles (1966–70), 
San Diego Padres (1971–72) and Chicago Cubs (1972). He batted and threw 
right-handed. Phoebus attended high school at Mount Saint Joseph College, 
a private high school in Baltimore. As a boy he played baseball in Baltimore 
through the Mary Dobkin Athletic Clubs.[1] Phoebus began his career with 
Baltimore pitching shutouts in his first two starts, on September 15 and 
20, 1966, against the Angels and Kansas City. He became just the fourth 
American League pitcher ever to do it. In 1967, Phoebus finished 14–9 with 
179 strikeouts and a 3.33 ERA, en route to being selected The Sporting 
News Rookie of the Year. On April 27, 1968, Phoebus no-hit the Red Sox 
6-0 at Memorial Stadium.[2] Converted outfielder Curt Blefary was the catcher. 
Meanwhile, third baseman Brooks Robinson helped with the bat and made a 
great catch to rob a hit from Rico Petrocelli in the 8th inning. Phoebus 
won a career-high 15 games in that season, and 14 in 1969, including the 
American League clincher over Cleveland. He also won Game Two of the 1970 
World Series in relief duties.[3] In the Minors, Tom led the Florida State 
League with 12 losses while playing for the Leesburg Orioles in 1961. In 
1962, he was tops in the Northern League with 195 strikeouts and 152 bases 
on balls while playing for the Aberdeen Pheasants. The next season, 1963, 
he led the Eastern League with 124 bases on balls while playing for the 
Elmira Pioneers. The minor leaguer's pitch count didn't let up in 1964 
when he again led the International League with 120 bases on balls while 
playing for the Rochester Red Wings. In 1966 his walks were down and his 
Ks were still high, but he still managed to get the league lead in the 
International League with 208 strikeouts and 95 bases on balls while playing 
for the Rochester Red Wings. Although Tom couldn't hit for average, he 
hit his two major league home runs against all-stars Jim Coates (1967) 
and Jim Kaat (1968). Phoebus was sent to San Diego in the same trade that 
brought Pat Dobson to the Orioles, and finished his career with the Cubs 
in 1972. In a seven-year career, Phoebus compiled a 56–52 record with 725
