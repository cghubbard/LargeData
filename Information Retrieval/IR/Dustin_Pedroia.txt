Dustin Luis Pedroia (born August 17, 1983) is an American baseball second 
baseman for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is a 
four-time All-Star and an American League (AL) Most Valuable Player award 
winner, who has also received four Gold Gloves and a single Silver Slugger 
award. Pedroia was drafted by the Red Sox in 2004, and made his major league 
debut in 2006 before becoming a full-time player in the 2007 season, and 
winning the AL Rookie of the Year award. He contributed to two Red Sox 
World Series championships in 2007 and 2013. Pedroia remains under contract 
with the Red Sox through the 2021 season. Pedroia is an above-average contact 
hitter with a very low strikeout rate and "a surprising amount of power", 
whose defense at second base has been rated significantly above-average. 
[1][2] Pedroia has achieved Major League success despite a relative lack 
of height − his height is reported to be 5 ft 7 in or 5 ft 8 in (170–173 cm).[3][4][5] 
Pedroia was born in Woodland, California on August 17, 1983. His parents 
operated a tire shop in the city where they would work fifteen hours per 
day.[6][7] Debbie Pedroia played tennis at Sacramento City College.[7] 
Pedroia's older brother, Brett, played baseball as a catcher at Shasta 
College.[8] Pedroia attended Woodland High School in Woodland, California 
where he played baseball and football. His football career ended when, 
as a freshman quarterback, a hit from future NFL linebacker Lance Briggs 
shattered his ankle.[9] As a senior baseball player, Pedroia did not strike 
out all season,[10] compiled a .445 batting average and was chosen as his 
league's most valuable player. Pedroia attended Arizona State University 
(ASU), where he played college baseball for the Arizona State Sun Devils 
baseball team. He was teammates with Ian Kinsler and Andre Ethier. Kinsler 
and Pedroia competed for the shortstop position at ASU. Ultimately, Pedroia 
stayed at shortstop, while Kinsler ended up at second base before transferring 
to the University of Missouri. In three years at ASU, Pedroia never hit 
below .347 and had a career average of .384, starting all 185 games. To 
help ASU recruit better pitchers, Pedroia also relinquished the last two 
years of his athletic scholarship.[9] He was named ASU On Deck Circle Most 
Valuable Player; other winners have included Ike Davis, Willie Bloomquist, 
Paul Lo Duca, and Barry Bonds.[11] Pedroia was drafted by the Red Sox in 
the second round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft, with the 65th 
pick overall. Pedroia, the eighth shortstop drafted, received a $575,000 
signing bonus.[9] In two years in the minors (2004–06), Pedroia batted 
.308 while playing second base and shortstop. After a brief call-up in 
2006, when he hit just .191 in 89 at-bats,[12] Pedroia became the regular 
second baseman for the Red Sox in 2007 replacing Mark Loretta. Pedroia 
suffered through an early-season hitting slump, but recovered, later putting 
up a 13-game hitting streak and a five-hit game against the Giants.[13] 
He notably made a diving stop to preserve fellow rookie Clay Buchholz's 
no-hitter on September 1.[14] Pedroia won the AL Rookie of the Year award 
and was selected to the 2007 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.[15][16] 
The Red Sox played the Indians in the 2007 ALCS. In Game 7 of the series, 
Pedroia homered and doubled, collecting five RBI to secure the Red Sox' 
spot in the World Series, to face the Rockies. Pedroia homered in the first 
at bat of the series, making him only the second player, and the first 
rookie, to lead off the Series with a home run.[17] Pedroia performed very 
well during the 2008 regular season, and received AL MVP, Gold Glove and 
Silver Slugger awards.[18][19][20] He was the first-ever Red Sox second 
baseman to win a Silver Slugger Award, the first Red Sox second baseman 
to win a Gold Glove since Doug Griffin in 1972, and the first second baseman 
to win an MVP Award since Nellie Fox in 1959. He hit .326 with 17 homers 
over 726 PAs, for a 127 wRC+.[21] Pedroia was defensively great, making 
only six errors through 157 games,[22][23] saving +9.7 runs over the season, 
according to UZR.[2] 2008 was also Pedroia's most productive season on 
the basepaths; he stole 20 bases in 21 attempts, for baserunning worth 
4.9 runs above average.[21][24] Pedroia's contribution in the regular season 
was rated 6.5 WAR by Fangraphs, a "superstar" level of performance.[21][25] 
He became only the third player in MLB history to win Rookie of the Year 
and Most Valuable Player in consecutive seasons joining Cal Ripken Jr. 
and Ryan Howard.[citation needed] Pedroia was hitless through the first 
three games of the 2008 ALDS, recording only an RBI double in Game 4. The 
Red Sox defeated the Angels in four games.[citation needed] In the ALCS 
against the Tampa Bay Rays, Pedroia collected 9 hits in 26 plate appearances, 
including three home runs and a double. The rest of the team struggled 
to a .234 batting average against the Tampa pitching staff, and the Red 
Sox lost the series.[citation needed] On December 3, 2008, Pedroia signed 
a six-year contract extension worth $40.5 million, with an additional team 
option for 2015 worth $11 million.[26] Pedroia announced on December 15, 
2008 that he would play for the United States team in the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic. He recorded the first Major League hit in Citi Field history during 
an April 3 exhibition game against the Mets. He hit a home run in his first 
at bat of the 2009 season.[citation needed] Pedroia was selected to start 
for the 2009 AL All Star Team. However, Pedroia had to withdraw from the 
team to stay with his wife Kelli, who was experiencing pregnancy complications 
with the couple's first child. The same issue had caused him to miss a 
regular season game prior to the All Star break.[citation needed] Pedroia 
achieved his first multi-home run game on September 9, 2009, against the 
Orioles.[citation needed] In 2010, MLB umpire Joe West made controversial 
statements regarding the speed of play between the Red Sox and Yankees, 
Pedroia responded by saying, "What he doesn't understand is that when we 
don't do well in these games against the Yankees, we get killed. If he 
doesn't want to do Red Sox and Yankee games, he should tell the umpires' 
union. Then when we're in the World Series, he'll be out of that assignment, 
too."[27][28] On June 24, 2010, Pedroia went 5 for 5, with 5 RBI, and hit 
three home runs in a game against the Rockies that the Red Sox won, 13–11, 
in the tenth inning.[29] The next day, Pedroia fouled a ball off his foot 
in an at-bat versus the Giants. MRI results the next day confirmed that 
he had a broken bone in his foot, and he was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list. Pedroia was under doctor's orders not to put weight on his injured 
foot for two weeks, but continued to practice fielding grounders while 
on his knees.[30] Pedroia was named to be a reserve player on the 2010 
AL All Star team, but did not participate due to this injury, and had former 
Arizona State teammate Ian Kinsler replace him on the roster. Pedroia returned 
to the lineup on August 17 against the Angels, only to be put back on the 
DL after playing 2 games. Pedroia would end the 2010 season having played 
only 75 games.[21] In 2011, Pedroia bounced back, batting .307 and slugging 
21 home runs over 159 games. He won a Fielding Bible Award in 2011 as the 
best fielding second baseman in MLB,[31] and had his best defensive season 
by ultimate zone rating, with 18.1 runs saved.[2] In June and July, Pedroia 
had a 25-game hitting streak, the longest for a Red Sox second baseman.[32] 
On August 16, Pedroia was involved in throwing a triple play, started by 
Jed Lowrie. Pedroia's 2011 season was rated at 7.6 Wins Above Replacement 
by Fangraphs, an "MVP-caliber" performance.[21][25] On September 30, 2012, 
Pedroia broke his ring finger on his left hand but after being reassured 
that the injury would not degrade with use, he made the decision to play 
through the pain in the following season-ending series at Yankee Stadium.[33] 
On July 23, 2013, Pedroia and the Red Sox agreed to an 8-year extension 
worth $110 million.[34] Pedroia was represented in negotiations by Sam 
Levinson and Seth Levinson of ACES Inc. Pedroia bounced back from his injury-affected 
2012 season to become the only player on the Red Sox to play more than 
150 games during the team's 2013 regular season, playing in 160 games.[35] 
Pedroia posted a strong regular season performance, and was awarded his 
third Gold Glove, and the Wilson AL Defensive Player of the Year award.[19][21][36] 
The Red Sox won their division and went on to win the World Series. In 
November 2013, Pedroia underwent thumb surgery to repair a torn UCL, an 
injury he suffered when sliding to first base on opening day.[37] In May 
2014, Pedroia hit his 100th career home run and his 300th career double. 
Pedroia hit only four home runs before the 2014 All Star break, and his 
hitting productivity dropped to league average.[21][38] However, his fielding 
numbers remained strong.[2][22] For his defensive performance, Pedroia 
was honored with the American League Gold Glove award at second base, his 
fourth in his nine-year career. This made him the first Red Sox infielder 
to win four Gold Gloves.[39] Pedroia began the 2015 MLB season with two 
home runs in the Red Sox opening game, on the road at Citizens Bank Park, 
Philadelphia.[40] On June 25, 2015 the Red Sox placed him on the 15-day 
disabled list due to a right hamstring strain.[41] Pedroia had a strong 
month as a hitter in August, culminating in a streak of three games, from 
August 25 through 27, over which he hit safely in 11 consecutive at bats, 
falling one hit shy of tying the major league record of 12 consecutive 
at bats with a base hit (shared by three players since 1902). During the 
streak, Pedroia had 10 singles, one double, scored two runs and drove in 
three. He also walked once during the streak, thus reaching base safely 
over 12 consecutive plate appearances.[42] Pedroia finished the 2016 season 
with a batting average of .318.[43] In 154 games of 2016, Pedroia finished 
the year with a .318 batting average, 201 hits, 36 doubles, 105 runs scored, 
15 home runs, and 74 RBI. The Red Sox finished the 2016 season with a 93-69 
record, clinching the AL East division, but were swept in three games by 
the Indians in the 2016 ALDS. On October 13, 2016, Pedroia underwent left 
knee surgery, a partial medial meniscectomy and chondroplasty. Despite 
the surgery, he, along with teammate Mookie Betts 2016 Fielding Bible awards. 
Pedroia has garnered multiple nicknames during his time in Boston, these 
include: Pedey, Laser Show, and the Muddy Chicken.[44][not in citation 
given] Pedroia is of Swiss Italian (Brione s/Minusio, Canton Ticino) , 
Portuguese and Spanish heritage.[citation needed] He is the nephew of Temple 
University defensive coordinator Phil Snow.[9] On January 9, 2009, Pedroia 
was named as the cover athlete of the baseball video game MLB 09: The Show, 
and appeared in several commercials for the game. On August 18, 2009, Dustin's 
wife, Kelli, gave birth to the couple's first child, a boy named Dylan.[45] 
On September 13, 2012, Dustin's wife, Kelli, delivered their second son, 
Cole.[46] On June 13, 2014, Dustin's wife, Kelli, delivered the couple's 
third son, Brooks. Dustin Pedroia is a fan of the NBA's Sacramento Kings, 
and the NFL's San Francisco 49ers. In a 2009 interview given to Boston, 
Pedroia criticized his home town of Woodland, California, calling it a 
"dump" and a city that never embraced him.[10] This generated backlash 
from his hometown and his family received death threats.[47] Pedroia later 
clarified his comments saying he was only joking and his comments were 
taken out of context.[48] The original article's author, however, insisted 
that his use of the comment was not misleading. His transcript of the interview 
with Pedroia quoted Pedroia as saying "It's a dump. You can quote me on 
that. I don't give a shit."[49] Pedroia has expressed an interest in bigfoot, 
including tweeting about the show Finding Bigfoot from his Twitter account.[50][51] 
Pedroia enjoys playing the game cribbage; he and former manager, Terry 
Francona, used to play together.[52][53] Born to Play: My Life in the Game
