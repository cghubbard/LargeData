Joseph Paul Visner (born Joseph Paul Vezina: September 27, 1859 â€“ June 
17, 1945) was a 19th-century Major League Baseball outfielder and catcher 
born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He played from 1885 to 1891, mostly in 
the American Association.[1] Visner also has the distinction of being one 
of the few Native Americans to play professionally in the years prior to 
the arrival of the much more famous Louis Sockalexis.[2] Visner began his 
Major League career with a brief appearance with the Baltimore Orioles 
in 1885, playing in four games and getting three hits in thirteen at bats.[1] 
He didn't appear again until 1889, when he played in 80 games, 53 at catcher 
for the first place Brooklyn Bridegrooms. The team lost the "World Series" 
after the season to the New York Giants, six games to three.[3] After a 
successful season in Brooklyn, Visner then jumped over to the Players' 
League and played all of his games as the starting right fielder for the 
Pittsburgh Burghers. He batted .267, and led the team in runs scored with 
110, and hit 22 triples.[4] When the Players' League folded after just 
one season, Visner moved back to the American Association and played sparsely 
for the Washington Statesmen and the St. Louis Browns in 1891.[1] After 
his major league career, he played some minor league baseball, specifically 
for the Minneapolis Millers of the Western League in 1894.[5] Visner died 
in Fosston, Minnesota, at the age of 85, and was interred at the Hansville
