Led by new manager Billy Martin, the 1969 Minnesota Twins won the newly 
formed American League West with a 97–65 record, nine games over the second-place 
Oakland Athletics. The Twins were swept by the Baltimore Orioles in the 
first American League Championship Series. In the first year of divisional 
play, the Twins won the American League West, led by Rod Carew (.332, his 
first AL batting title), Tony Oliva (.309, 24 HR, 101 RBI) and league MVP 
Harmon Killebrew (49 HR, 140 RBI – both league-leading totals). Carew stole 
home 7 times. Leadoff batter César Tovar was third in the AL with 45 stolen 
bases. Jim Perry and Dave Boswell each won 20 games, the first and only 
time a Minnesota club has held two 20-game winners. Reliever Ron Perranoski 
became the first Twin to lead the AL in saves with 31. Pitcher Jim Kaat 
won his 8th Gold Glove Award. In the May 18 loss to Detroit, Twins stole 
five bases during the third inning to tie a major league record. Four bases 
were stolen during Harmon Killebrew's at-bat: César Tovar stole home, and 
Rod Carew stole second, third and then home.[1] On June 21 in Oakland, 
the Twins were tied 3-3 with the A's going into the tenth inning. In the 
top of the inning, Minnesota scored eleven times, tying a 1928 New York 
Yankees record. The Twins won the game 14-4.[2] Four Twins made the All-Star 
Game: first baseman Killebrew, second baseman Carew, outfielder Oliva, 
and catcher Johnny Roseboro. Harmon Killebrew became the second Twin to 
be named American League Most Valuable Player. 1,349,328 fans attended 
Twins games, the third highest total in the American League. [1] [2] [3]
