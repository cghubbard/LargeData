The Toronto Blue Jays came into existence in 1976,[1] as one of two teams 
slated to join the American League for the following season (the other 
being the Seattle Mariners), via the 1977 Major League Baseball expansion. 
Toronto had been mentioned as a potential major league city as early as 
the 1880s, and had been home to the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of 
the International League, from 1896 to 1967. In January 1976, San Francisco 
Giants owner Horace Stoneham agreed to sell the team for $13.25 million 
to a Toronto group which was led by Don McDougall and consisted of Labatt 
Breweries of Canada, Ltd., Vulcan Assets Ltd. – owned by Globe and Mail 
chairman and president Howard Webster[2] – and Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce (CIBC). The team would have begun play in the 1976 season at Exhibition 
Stadium, and be called the Toronto Giants.[3] However the plan to move 
the Giants was quashed by a U.S. court.[4] Following the court ruling, 
Bob Lurie purchased the Giants and kept them in San Francisco.[5] The City 
of Toronto had renovated Exhibition Stadium to accommodate Major League 
Baseball (MLB), in anticipation of the Giants relocating there, and continued 
to push for an MLB franchise. MLB awarded the City of Toronto an expansion 
franchise in 1976, along with Seattle, Washington. A consortium composed 
of Labatt Breweries (45%), Webster (45%) and CIBC (10%), purchased the 
rights for the franchise from MLB for $7 million.[4][6][7] However, even 
after the franchises were awarded, the future of baseball in Toronto appeared 
uncertain. U.S. President Gerald Ford had attempted to put pressure on 
MLB to give Washington, D.C. an expansion franchise instead of Toronto.[8] 
Washington had been without Major League Baseball since the Senators were 
moved to Arlington, Texas to become the Texas Rangers following the 1972 
season. Following this development there was brief speculation by Metro 
Toronto chairman Paul Godfrey,[4] among others, that Washington would be 
awarded Toronto's American League franchise and Toronto would instead be 
awarded a National League expansion franchise. However, Ford's attempts 
did not amount to anything and Toronto was allowed to keep its American 
League expansion franchise. The franchise's first employee was Paul Beeston, 
who began work in 1976 as the vice president of business operations. Beeston 
would later serve as president of the Blue Jays and MLB; he eventually 
returned to the Blue Jays in 2008, as president. Before the team's inaugural 
season in 1977, Peter Bavasi was chosen as the general manager, and Pat 
Gillick was assistant general manager. The name "Blue Jays" came about 
when the team held a "name the team" contest in 1976, which involved more 
than 4,000 suggestions.[9] "Blue Jays" was chosen by majority owner Labatt 
Breweries—an apparent tie-in with its feature brand, Labatt Blue. However, 
it is very likely that the team would have used blue as one of its colours 
in any event; blue has been the primary colour for Toronto's top-level 
teams since the Toronto Argonauts adopted it in 1873. The Blue Jays played 
their first game on April 7, 1977, against the Chicago White Sox, before 
a home crowd of 44,649. The game is now perhaps best remembered for the 
minor snowstorm which began just before the game started. Toronto won the 
snowy affair 9–5, led by Doug Ault's two home runs. That win would be one 
of only 54 of the 1977 season, as the Blue Jays finished in last place 
in the AL East, with a record of 54–107. After the season, Gillick became 
general manager of the team, a position he would hold until 1994. In 1978, 
the team improved their record by five games, but remained last with a 
record of 59–102. In 1979, after a 53–109 last place finish, shortstop 
Alfredo Griffin was named American League co-Rookie of the Year. In addition, 
the Blue Jays' first mascot, BJ Birdy, made its debut in 1979. In 1980, 
Bobby Mattick became manager, succeeding Roy Hartsfield, the Blue Jays' 
original manager. Mattick began the 1980 season with the goal of losing 
fewer than 100 games for the first time in the team's brief history. For 
a brief time during the early part of the season, the surprising young 
Jays actually battled with the New York Yankees for first place in the 
AL East, before they tumbled during the summer back to the bottom of the 
standings. Still, the Jays almost reached the 70-win mark, finishing with 
a record of 67–95, a 14-win improvement on 1979, and achieving Mattick's 
goal of fewer than 100 losses. Jim Clancy led with 13 wins and John Mayberry 
became the first Jay to hit 30 home runs in a season. In the strike-divided 
season of 1981, the Jays again finished in last place in the American League 
East, in both halves of the season. They were a dismal 16–42 in the first 
half, but improved dramatically, finishing the 48-game second half at 21–27, 
for a combined record of 37–69. After the season, Mattick stepped down 
as manager, but remained with the team as executive co-ordinator of baseball 
operations, eventually being promoted to vice president of baseball in 
1984. Under new manager Bobby Cox, Toronto's first solid season came in 
1982 as they finished 78–84. Their pitching staff was led by starters Dave 
Stieb, Jim Clancy and Luis Leal, and the outfield featured a young Lloyd 
Moseby and Jesse Barfield. 1982 was also the Blue Jays' first season in 
which they were not worse than every other team in their division, as they 
tied Cleveland for sixth place. First baseman Willie Upshaw became the 
first Blue Jay to have at least 100 RBIs in a season. In 1983, the Jays 
would make an even bigger breakthrough, leading the AL East for most of 
the summer (including at the All-Star break) before tailing off during 
August and September; in the end, the club did compile their first winning 
record, 89–73, finishing in fourth place, 9 games behind the eventual World 
Series champions, the Baltimore Orioles. It would be the first of 11 straight 
winning seasons for the team. The Blue Jays' progress continued in 1984, 
finishing with the same 89–73 record, but this time in a distant second 
place behind another World Series champion, the Detroit Tigers. After 1984, 
Alfredo Griffin went to the Oakland Athletics, thus giving a permanent 
spot to young Dominican shortstop Tony Fernández, who would become a fan 
favourite for many years. In 1985, Toronto won their first championship 
of any sort: the first of their six American League East division titles. 
The Blue Jays featured strong pitching and a balanced offense. Their mid-season 
call up of relief pitcher Tom Henke also proved to be important. They finished 
99–62 (the franchise record for most wins), two games in front of the New 
York Yankees. The Blue Jays faced the Kansas City Royals in the American 
League Championship Series (ALCS), and took a 3 games to 1 lead. However, 
Kansas City won three consecutive games to win the series 4 games to 3, 
on their way to their first World Series championship. Shortly after the 
loss in the ALCS, Bobby Cox left the Blue Jays to return to his former 
club, the Atlanta Braves, as general manager. With Jimy Williams now the 
skipper, The Blue Jays could not duplicate their success in 1986, sliding 
to a fourth-place tie at 86–76. Jesse Barfield and George Bell led the 
way with 40 and 31 home runs respectively and Jimmy Key and Jim Clancy 
tied for the team wins lead with 14 each. In 1987, the Blue Jays lost a 
thrilling division race to the Detroit Tigers by two games, after being 
swept on the last weekend of the season by the Tigers, ending the season 
with 7 straight losses. The Blue Jays finished with a 96–66 record, second 
best in the major leagues, but to no avail. However, George Bell was named 
Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the American League. Bell was the first MVP 
in Blue Jays history, and would remain the franchise's only winner until 
Josh Donaldson won the award in 2015.[10] In 1988, however, Toronto could 
not duplicate the successes of the previous season, tying the Milwaukee 
Brewers for third in the division at 87–75. Still, the season had numerous 
highlights. First baseman Fred McGriff hit 34 home runs, and Dave Stieb 
had back-to-back starts in which he lost a no-hitter with two out and two 
strikes in the ninth inning. In 1989, the Blue Jays' new retractable roofed 
home, SkyDome, opened in the mid-season. It also marked the beginning of 
an extremely successful five-year period for the team. In May, management 
fired manager Jimy Williams and replaced him with Cito Gaston, the team's 
popular hitting instructor. The club had a dismal 12–24 record at the time 
of the firing, but went 77–49 under Gaston to win the American League East 
title by two games. On May 28, 1989, the Blue Jays played their final game 
at Exhibition Stadium against the Chicago White Sox, who coincidentally 
were the Blue Jays' opponents in their first game in franchise history, 
at the same stadium, twelve years earlier; the Blue Jays won 7–5 in 10 
innings. The first game at the new stadium took place on June 5 against 
the Milwaukee Brewers, which the Jays lost 5–3. In the 1989 American League 
Championship Series, Rickey Henderson led the Oakland Athletics to a 4–1 
series win. In 1990, the Blue Jays again had a strong season, but finished 
in second place, two games behind the Boston Red Sox. Dave Stieb pitched 
his only no-hitter, beating the Cleveland Indians 3–0 in front of a less 
than capacity crowd at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. This was also, as of 
2015[update], the only no-hitter ever pitched by a Toronto Blue Jay pitcher. 
During the offseason, the Blue Jays made one of the two biggest trades 
in franchise history, sending all-star shortstop Tony Fernández and first 
baseman Fred McGriff to the San Diego Padres in exchange for outfielder 
Joe Carter and second baseman Roberto Alomar. The Jays also obtained center 
fielder Devon White from the California Angels. These deals, particularly 
the trade with San Diego, were instrumental in the team's future success. 
Carter, Alomar and White would prove to be extremely effective additions, 
as the Blue Jays again won the division in 1991, as Carter drove in the 
division winning run. Once again, however, they fell short in the postseason, 
losing to the Minnesota Twins, who were on their way to their second World 
Series victory in five seasons, in the ALCS. In 1991, the Blue Jays became 
the first Major League club ever to draw over four million fans in one 
season. In early November 1991, Labatt announced that it had acquired the 
45% ownership stake in the team held by Webster's estate for $67.5 million, 
giving it 90% of the club with CIBC owning the renaming 10%.[11][12] After 
the 1991 season had ended, the Blue Jays acquired pitcher Jack Morris, 
who had led the Minnesota Twins to victory in the World Series by pitching 
a 10-inning complete game shutout in Game 7 and had been named the World 
Series MVP. To add veteran leadership to their explosive offense, Toronto 
signed future Hall of Famer Dave Winfield to be the team's designated hitter. 
The 1992 regular season went well, as the Jays clinched their second straight 
AL East crown with a final record of 96–66, four games ahead of the Milwaukee 
Brewers. They also went the entire season without being swept in any series. 
The Blue Jays met the Oakland Athletics (who had the same record as the 
Jays and led the division by six games over the defending champion Twins) 
in the ALCS, winning 4 games to 2. The pivotal game of the series was Game 
4, considered by many to be one of the most important games in Blue Jays 
history: the Blue Jays rallied back from a 6–1 deficit after seven innings, 
capped off by Roberto Alomar's huge game-tying 2-run homer off Hall of 
Fame A's closer Dennis Eckersley in the top of the ninth. This paved the 
way for a 7–6 victory in 11 innings, a 3 games to 1 lead in the series 
and an eventual 4–2 ALCS series win. The Blue Jays then faced the Atlanta 
Braves in the World Series. The pivotal game in this series turned out 
to be Game 2, in which reserve player Ed Sprague hit a 9th-inning 2-run 
home run off Braves closer Jeff Reardon to give the Blue Jays a 5–4 lead, 
which would hold up. After winning Game 3 thanks to Candy Maldonado's ninth 
inning RBI hit and Game 4 due to Jimmy Key's superb 7 1⁄3 inning pitching 
effort in which he retired 15 straight batters (five innings), the Jays 
could not win the Series on home turf as the Braves struck back with a 
7–2 win in Game 5. Game 6 in Atlanta, with the Blue Jays leading 3 games 
to 2, was a very close game. Toronto was one strike away from winning in 
the bottom of the 9th inning, 2–1,[13] but Otis Nixon singled in the tying 
run off the Blue Jays' closer Tom Henke. It was the first run the Toronto 
bullpen had given up in the series. The game was decided in the 11th inning, 
when Dave Winfield doubled down the left-field line, driving in two runs. 
The Braves would again come within one run in the bottom of the 11th, but 
Jays reliever Mike Timlin fielded Otis Nixon's bunt, throwing to Joe Carter 
at first base for the final out. The Blue Jays became the first team based 
outside of the United States to win the World Series. Pat Borders, the 
Jays' catcher, was the unlikely player who was named MVP after hitting 
.450 with one home run in the World Series. Oddly, Morris was acquired 
in large part for his reputation as a clutch postseason pitcher, but he 
went 0–3 in the playoffs. Morris, however, pitched well in the regular 
season, becoming the Blue Jays' first 20-game winner, with a record of 
21–6 and an ERA of 4.04. After the 1992 season, the Blue Jays let World 
Series hero Dave Winfield and longtime closer Tom Henke go but signed two 
key free agents: designated hitter Paul Molitor from the Milwaukee Brewers 
and perennial playoff success Dave Stewart from the Oakland Athletics. 
In 1993, the Blue Jays had seven All-Stars: outfielders Devon White and 
Joe Carter, infielders John Olerud and Roberto Alomar, designated hitter 
Molitor, plus starting pitcher Pat Hentgen, and closer Duane Ward. In August, 
the Jays acquired former nemesis Rickey Henderson from the Athletics. The 
Blue Jays cruised to a 95–67 record, one less win than 1992 and seven games 
ahead of the New York Yankees, winning their third straight division title. 
The Jays beat the Chicago White Sox 4 games to 2 in the ALCS, and then 
the Philadelphia Phillies, 4 games to 2, for their second straight World 
Series victory. The World Series featured several exciting games, including 
Game 4, played under a slight rain, in which the Blue Jays came back from 
a 14–9 deficit to win 15–14 and take a 3 games to 1 lead in the series. 
It remains the highest scoring game in World Series history. Game 6 in 
Toronto saw the Blue Jays lead 5–1, but give up 5 runs in the 7th inning 
to trail 6–5. In the bottom of the 9th inning Joe Carter hit a one-out, 
three-run walk-off home run to clinch the series, off Phillies closer Mitch 
Williams. This is the only time in the history of Major League Baseball 
that a team hit a walk-off home run while trailing in the bottom of the 
9th inning to win the World Series. The home run is also memorable for 
late Blue Jays broadcaster Tom Cheek's call: A swing, and a belt! Left 
field! Way back! Blue Jays win it! The Blue Jays are World Series champions 
as Joe Carter hits a three-run home run in the ninth inning and the Blue 
Jays have repeated as World Series champions! Touch 'em all, Joe, you'll 
never hit a bigger home run in your life! In the regular season, three 
Blue Jays—John Olerud, Paul Molitor and Roberto Alomar—finished 1-2-3 for 
the AL batting crown. Expectations were high for the Blue Jays for the 
1994 season, following back-to-back championships, but they slumped to 
a 55–60 record and a third-place finish (16 games back of the New York 
Yankees) before the players' strike. It was their first losing season since 
1982. Joe Carter, Paul Molitor and John Olerud enjoyed good years at the 
plate, but the pitching fell off. Juan Guzmán slumped considerably from 
his first three years (40–11, 3.28 ERA), finishing 1994 at 12–11 with a 
5.68 ERA. Three young players, Alex Gonzalez, Carlos Delgado and Shawn 
Green, did show a lot of promise for the future. Before the 1995 season, 
Pat Gillick, the longtime Blue Jays general manager, resigned and handed 
the reins of the team to Toronto native Gord Ash, who would lead the team 
in its most tumultuous era yet. In the 1995 season, the Blue Jays proved 
that they had lost their contending swagger of the past 12 years. Although 
they had most of the same cast of the World Series teams, the Blue Jays 
freefell to a dismal 56–88 record, last place in the AL East, 30 games 
behind the Boston Red Sox. Attendance also tailed off dramatically during 
the 1995 season, and wouldn't recover for several years. During SkyDome's 
first four-plus seasons, Blue Jays tickets were among the toughest in all 
of baseball. While attendance suffered throughout the majors in the years 
immediately after the strike, the dropoff was especially pronounced for 
the Canadian teams, the Montreal Expos and Blue Jays. Labatt Breweries 
was bought by Belgian-based brewer Interbrew (now InBev) in 1995,[14][15] 
making the Blue Jays the second baseball team owned by interests outside 
of North America. Interestingly, the first was the Blue Jays' expansion 
cousins, the Mariners, owned by Nintendo. 1996 was another mediocre year 
for the Blue Jays, despite Pat Hentgen's Cy Young Award (20–10, 3.22 ERA). 
Ed Sprague had a career year, hitting 36 home runs and driving in 101 runs. 
However, their 74 wins did put them in 4th place, improving over their 
last place finish in 1995. They improved their record by 18 victories as 
they played the full 162 game schedule for the first time since 1993. The 
Blue Jays started 1997 with high hopes. Not only did the Jays drastically 
change their uniforms, they signed former Boston Red Sox ace Roger Clemens 
to a $24,750,000 contract. Clemens had one of the best pitching seasons 
ever as he won the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the American League 
with a record of 21–7, a 2.05 ERA, and 292 strikeouts. This was not enough 
to lead the Blue Jays to the postseason, however, as they finished in last 
place for the second time in three years with a record of 76–86. Cito Gaston, 
the longtime manager who led the team to 3 division titles and 2 World 
Series crowns, was fired five games before the end of the season. Before 
the start of the 1998 season, the Blue Jays acquired closer Randy Myers 
and slugger Jose Canseco. Gaston was replaced with former Blue Jay Tim 
Johnson, a relative unknown as a manager. Despite mediocre hitting, strong 
pitching led by Clemens' second straight pitching Triple Crown (20–6, 2.65 
ERA, 271 strikeouts) sparked the Blue Jays to an 88–74 record – their first 
winning season since 1993. However, this was only good enough to finish 
a distant third, 26 games behind the New York Yankees, who posted one of 
the greatest records in all of baseball history at 114–48. They were, however, 
in contention for the wildcard spot until the final week. Before the 1999 
season, the Blue Jays traded Clemens to the Yankees for starting pitcher 
David Wells, second baseman Homer Bush and relief pitcher Graeme Lloyd. 
They also fired manager Tim Johnson during spring training after he lied 
about several things (including killing people in the Vietnam War) in order 
to motivate his players. The Blue Jays had initially been willing to stand 
by Johnson. A blizzard of questions about his credibility during spring 
training, however, led Ash to fire him less than a month before opening 
day. Johnson was replaced with Jim Fregosi, who managed the Phillies when 
they lost to the Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series. The offense picked 
up somewhat in 1999, but the pitching suffered without Clemens, as the 
Blue Jays finished at 84–78, in third place. After the 1999 season, the 
Blue Jays' original mascot for 20 years, BJ Birdy, was replaced by a duo 
named Ace & Diamond. On November 8, 1999, Toronto traded star outfielder 
Shawn Green to the Los Angeles Dodgers for left-handed relief pitcher Pedro 
Borbón and right-fielder Raúl Mondesí. Green had told the Jays that he 
would not be re-signing when his contract was up at the end of the year 
(he wished to play closer to his home in Southern California). 2000 proved 
to be a similar season, as the Jays had an 83–79 record, well out of the 
wild card race but only a slim 4½ games back of the three-time defending 
World Series Champion Yankees in the AL East, the first time since 1993 
they had contended for the division. Carlos Delgado had a stellar year, 
hitting .344 with 41 home runs, 57 doubles, 137 RBI, 123 walks and 115 
runs. In addition, six other players hit 20 or more home runs, an outstanding 
feat. José Cruz Jr., Raúl Mondesí, Tony Batista, Darrin Fletcher, Shannon 
Stewart, and Brad Fullmer all contributed to the powerful heart of the 
lineup. On September 1, 2000, Rogers Communications Inc. announced that 
it had purchased 80% of the baseball club for $168 million with Interbrew 
(now InBev) maintaining 20% interest and the Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce relinquishing its 10% share.[14][15] Rogers would acquire the 
remaining 20% owned by Interbrew in January 2004 for $45 million,[16][17] 
and currently owns 100% of the team. Buck Martinez, a former catcher and 
broadcast announcer for the Blue Jays, took over as manager before the 
2001 season. The Blue Jays were back under .500 for 2001, finishing at 
80–82, with mediocre pitching and hitting. Delgado led the team again with 
39 home runs and 102 RBI. After the 2001 season ended, the Blue Jays fired 
Gord Ash, ending a seven-year tenure as general manager. The Blue Jays' 
struggles were further aggravated by an extremely unfavourable currency 
exchange rate. In the early 2000s, the Canadian dollar traded for as low 
as 62 U.S. cents, resulting in massive losses for the Blue Jays who collected 
most of their revenues in Canadian dollars but paid player salaries in 
U.S. dollars. When J. P. Ricciardi, then director of player development 
under Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane, was named the Blue 
Jays' General Manager he was expected to slash the payroll immediately 
in order to stem the tide of red ink. During the off-season, the team traded 
or let go several popular players, including Alex Gonzalez, Paul Quantrill, 
Brad Fullmer and closer Billy Koch to let talented youngsters such as Eric 
Hinske and Felipe López get a chance to develop into major leaguers. The 
Blue Jays started the 2002 season with slow progress in performance. Buck 
Martinez was fired about a third of the way through the season, with a 
20–33 record. He was replaced by third base coach Carlos Tosca, an experienced 
minor league manager. They went 58–51 under Tosca to finish the season 
78–84. Roy Halladay was relied on as the team's ace and rose to the challenge 
of being the team's top pitcher, finishing the season with a 19–7 record 
and 2.93 ERA. The hitters were led once again by Carlos Delgado. Promising 
young players were assigned to key roles; starting third baseman Eric Hinske 
won the Rookie of the Year Award at the season's conclusion, and 23-year-old 
centre fielder Vernon Wells had his first 100 RBI season. The 2003 season 
was a surprise to both team management and baseball analysts. After a poor 
April, the team had its most successful month ever in May. Carlos Delgado 
led the majors in RBI, followed closely by Wells. Despite their hitting 
successes, poor pitching continued to plague the team. Halladay was an 
exception, winning his first Cy Young Award, going 22–7, with a 3.25 ERA. 
In July, Shannon Stewart was traded to the Minnesota Twins for Bobby Kielty, 
another outfielder with a much lower batting average than Stewart's. Although 
the Jays finished in third place in their division, Delgado was second 
in the voting for the American League MVP Award. In the off-season, Kielty 
was traded to the Oakland Athletics for starter Ted Lilly. The 2004 season 
was a disappointing year for the Blue Jays right from the beginning. They 
started the season 0–8 at SkyDome and never started a lengthy winning streak. 
Much of that was due to injuries to All-Stars Carlos Delgado, Vernon Wells 
and Roy Halladay among others. Although the additions of starting pitchers 
Ted Lilly and Miguel Batista and reliever Justin Speier were relatively 
successful, veteran Pat Hentgen faltered throughout the season and retired 
on July 24. Rookies and minor league callups David Bush, Jason Frasor, 
Josh Towers and others filled the void in the rotation and the bullpen; 
however, inconsistent performances were evident. With the team struggling 
in last place and mired in a five-game losing streak, manager Carlos Tosca 
was fired on August 8, 2004, and was replaced by first base coach John 
Gibbons. Long-time first baseman Carlos Delgado became a free agent in 
the off-season. Nevertheless, prospects Russ Adams, Gabe Gross, and Alex 
Ríos provided excitement for the fans. Rookie pitchers David Bush, Gustavo 
Chacín and Jason Frasor also showed promise for the club's future. The 
Blue Jays' lone MLB All-Star Game representative was Lilly. The Blue Jays 
had a good start to the 2005 season. They led the AL East from early to 
mid-April and held their record around .500 until late August. The Jays 
were hit with the injury bug when third baseman Corey Koskie broke his 
finger, taking him out of the lineup, but the club was pleasantly surprised 
with the performance of rookie call-up Aaron Hill in his stead. On July 
8, just prior to the All-Star break, Blue Jays ace Roy Halladay was struck 
on the shin by a line drive, resulting in a fractured leg. Though Halladay's 
injury was hoped to be minor, the recovery process was met with constant 
delays, and eventually, he was out for the rest of the season. Prior to 
his injury, the Blue Jays were in serious wild card contention, but soon 
fell out of the playoff race. The team received glimpses of the future 
from September call-ups Guillermo Quiróz, John-Ford Griffin, and Shaun 
Marcum. Marcum made himself noteworthy by posting an ERA of 0.00 over 5 
relief appearances and 8 innings in September. Josh Towers also stepped 
up, showing largely unseen potential by going 7–5 with a 2.91 ERA in the 
second half of the season. In 2006, the team experienced its most successful 
season in years. On July 2, Troy Glaus, Vernon Wells, Roy Halladay, B. 
J. Ryan, and Alex Ríos were picked to represent the Blue Jays at the All-Star 
Game.[18] It was the largest number of Blue Jay All-Stars selected for 
the game since 1993. The team played well in the critical month of September, 
going 18–10. This, combined with the slumping of the Boston Red Sox, enabled 
the Blue Jays to take sole possession of second place in the American League 
East by the end of the season. This marked the first time that the Jays 
had finished above third place in their division since their World Championship 
season of 1993, and with the most wins since the 1998 season. On December 
18, the Blue Jays announced that they had re-signed centre fielder Wells 
to a seven-year contract worth $126 million, which came into effect after 
the 2007 season. The 2007 season was blighted by persistent injuries, with 
12 Blue Jays landing on the disabled list. The most serious injury was 
that of B. J. Ryan, who was out for the entire season having had Tommy 
John surgery. Prior to the season, the team signed starting pitchers John 
Thomson, Tomo Ohka, and Víctor Zambrano; each of them was released before 
the end of the season. However, young starters Shaun Marcum and Dustin 
McGowan had breakout years, with 12 wins each. On June 24, McGowan pitched 
a complete game one-hitter. On June 28, Frank Thomas became the 21st major 
league player to hit 500 career home runs. Aaron Hill also had a breakout 
year, setting a team record for second basemen with 47 doubles. The Blue 
Jays' 2008 season featured a strong pitching staff, which led the major 
leagues with a 3.49 ERA. For much of the season, however, the team struggled 
to hit home runs and drive in runs. On May 24, starter Jesse Litsch set 
a team record, with 38 consecutive innings without giving up a walk. On 
June 20, following a five-game losing streak and with the Jays in last 
place in the AL East, management fired John Gibbons and several members 
of his coaching staff, and re-hired Cito Gaston. Meanwhile, Alex Ríos had 
32 stolen bases, making him the first Blue Jay with 30 since 2001. On September 
5, Roy Halladay earned his 129th career win, moving him into second spot 
on Toronto's all-time wins list. Halladay also came second in the voting 
for the Cy Young Award, after posting a 20–11 record and 2.78 ERA. From 
August 30 to September 9, the team had a 10-game winning streak. The 2009 
season saw the addition of two new patches on the Blue Jays' uniforms: 
on the right arm, a bright red maple leaf (part of the Canadian flag), 
and on the left arm, a small black band with "TED" written on it, in reference 
to team owner Ted Rogers, who died in the off-season. On opening day at 
the Rogers Centre, the Jays, led by Roy Halladay, beat the Detroit Tigers 
12–5.[19] On June 9, with the 20th pick in the MLB draft, the Jays selected 
RHP Chad Jenkins, a power pitcher that has drawn comparisons to David Wells 
and Gustavo Chacín[20] (passing over Mike Trout who was picked 25th by 
the Angels). Aaron Hill and Roy Halladay both had excellent years and represented 
the Blue Jays at the 2009 All-Star Game in St. Louis. In mid-August, J. 
P. Ricciardi allowed the Chicago White Sox to claim Alex Ríos off waivers. 
Despite a hot start, the Jays quickly fell, including a 9-game losing streak, 
after starting with a 27–14 record. With two games remaining in what was 
a disappointing season, Ricciardi was fired on October 3. He was replaced 
by assistant general manager Alex Anthopoulos.[21][22] Despite a 75-win 
season, the Jays saw the strong return of Aaron Hill, who won the American 
League Comeback Player of the Year Award and the Silver Slugger for second 
base. Adam Lind, who also had a strong season, earned the Silver Slugger 
for designated hitter. Shortstop Marco Scutaro also broke out for career 
highs in batting average (.282), slugging percentage (.379), at bats (574), 
and total bases (235). In the off-season, the Jays' ace Roy Halladay was 
traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for Kyle Drabek, Travis d'Arnaud, and 
Michael Taylor; Taylor was immediately traded to the Oakland Athletics 
for Brett Wallace. The team's significant free agent signings were that 
of catcher John Buck and shortstop Álex González.[23] The 2010 season was 
a surprising 10-win improvement over the last season. It was a career year 
for José Bautista, who hit 54 home runs, breaking George Bell's franchise 
record. In doing so, he became the 26th player to reach 50 home runs and 
the first since Alex Rodriguez and Prince Fielder achieved the feat in 
2007. The Blue Jays also set a franchise record for the most home runs 
in a single season as they hit 257, 13 more than their previous record 
of 244 set by the 2000 Blue Jays. The Blue Jays tied the 1996 Baltimore 
Orioles for the third most home runs by a team in a single season. Seven 
players (José Bautista, Vernon Wells, Aaron Hill, Adam Lind, Lyle Overbay, 
John Buck, and Edwin Encarnación) hit 20 home runs or more throughout the 
season, tying an MLB record previously set by four teams, including the 
2000 Blue Jays. On August 7, catching prospect J. P. Arencibia made his 
major league debut. He went 4-for-5 with 2 home runs, including a home 
run hit on the first pitch he saw. The next day, starting pitcher Brandon 
Morrow came within one out of a no-hitter, finishing with 17 strikeouts 
in a complete game one-hitter. Led by new manager John Farrell, the Blue 
Jays' 2011 season was up-and-down for the most part, as the team finished 
with a .500 record. After signing a five-year $64 million contract extension,[24] 
José Bautista followed up his record setting 2010 season with an arguably 
better season. He finished with a Major League-leading 43 home runs, along 
with 103 RBI, 132 walks, and a .302 average. Rookie J. P. Arencibia also 
had a successful year, setting a Blue Jays single-season record with 23 
home runs by a catcher. In August, third base prospect Brett Lawrie made 
his Major League debut and hit .293 with 9 home runs, 4 triples, and 25 
RBI, in just 43 games. Starting pitcher and ace Ricky Romero had a breakout 
year, leading the team with 15 wins and a 2.92 ERA. He also became an All-Star 
for the first time in his career. The other starting pitchers were inconsistent 
throughout the season. Jon Rauch and Frank Francisco, both acquired in 
the off-season, shared the closer role.[25] They both struggled through 
the first half of the season, though Francisco improved in the last two 
months of the season, and had six saves in September. On July 31, the Blue 
Jays retired their first number, Roberto Alomar's #12. The 2012 season 
was an injury-plagued year for the Blue Jays, having used 31 total pitchers, 
which set a franchise record.[26] In June, three starting pitchers (Brandon 
Morrow, Kyle Drabek, and Drew Hutchison) were lost to injury in a span 
of four days, two of whom required Tommy John surgery.[26] In the second 
half of the season, some key players in Toronto's lineup, including All-Star 
José Bautista, missed a significant amount of playing time due to injury, 
sending the team into a freefall and culminating in a 73–89 record. Despite 
the underachievements of Ricky Romero and Adam Lind, Casey Janssen established 
himself as a reliable closer (22 SV, 2.52 ERA) and Edwin Encarnación developed 
into one of the league's best power hitters (.280 AVG, 42 HR, 110 RBI). 
The team opened on the road in Cleveland, where they beat the Indians 7–4 
in 16 full innings, setting a new record for the longest opening-day game 
in major league history. The previous record of 15 innings had been set 
by the Washington Senators and Philadelphia Athletics on April 13, 1926, 
and tied by the Detroit Tigers and the Indians on April 19, 1960.[27] On 
April 20, the Jays turned a triple play against the Kansas City Royals 
in a 4–3 win. It was the first triple play they turned since September 
21, 1979.[28] During the off-season the Blue Jays announced multiple blockbuster 
trades and free agent signings. One such trade acquired Mark Buehrle, José 
Reyes and Josh Johnson among others from the Miami Marlins and another 
was with the Mets for R.A. Dickey. Melky Cabrera was signed as a free agent 
around the same time.[29] Despite fans and analysts high expectations,[30] 
the 2013 team did not live up to the pre-season predictions. Most of the 
regulars battled injury (Reyes broke his ankle during a steal attempt 10 
games into the season and a benign tumor was removed from Cabrera's spine 
after the season ended) and generally underperformed.[31] One of the few 
bright spots was the promotion of fan favorite Munenori Kawasaki to replace 
Reyes. The Blue Jays also tied a franchise record with an eleven-game winning 
streak from June 11–23. Edwin Encarnación finished the season on the DL 
with a wrist injury but had great numbers (.272 AVG, 36 HR and 104 RBI)
