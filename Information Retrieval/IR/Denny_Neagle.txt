Dennis Edward Neagle Jr. (/ˈneɪɡəl/; born September 13, 1968) is a former 
Major League Baseball pitcher. He was last under contract with the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays during the 2005 season, but he did not play due to injury. 
During the 1990s, he was one of the top pitchers in baseball, but his career, 
and personal life, deteriorated in the early 2000s. With the New York Yankees, 
he won the 2000 World Series over the New York Mets. Neagle attended Arundel 
Senior High School in Gambrills, MD and played on the baseball team. Neagle 
attended the University of Minnesota and played on the baseball team. Neagle 
was drafted in the 3rd round of the 1989 amateur draft by the Minnesota 
Twins. He saw some action in the summer of 1991 for the Twins, but was 
not on their postseason roster when the club won the 1991 World Series. 
Neagle was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates during spring training in 1992,[1] 
and became a full-time starter for the Pirates in 1994. The following season, 
Neagle posted a 13-8 record with a 3.43 ERA and became the ace of a mediocre 
Pittsburgh staff. That year, Neagle represented the Pirates at the All-Star 
Game. He got off to an impressive 14–6 start in 1996. On August 27, 1996, 
he pitched eight innings giving up only two runs to the first place Atlanta 
Braves. The next day, the Braves traded a young Jason Schmidt to Pittsburgh 
for Neagle in the midst of their playoff run. Neagle was given the opportunity 
to start in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series, earning a no-decision. Remaining 
with the Braves in 1997, Neagle had his best season, going 20–5 with a 
2.97 ERA. He earned another All-Star selection and finished third in Cy 
Young Award voting. In the 1997 National League Championship Series, Neagle 
pitched a complete-game shutout. Neagle's 16-11 record and 3.55 ERA in 
1998 were still solid numbers, but the emergence of Kevin Millwood made 
him expendable and he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds after the season. 
Injuries limited Neagle to 19 starts in 1999, but he stormed out to an 
8–2 record in 2000. The playoff-bound New York Yankees traded prospects 
Drew Henson, Jackson Melián and Ed Yarnall to acquire Neagle on July 12, 
2000. He only registered a 7-7 record over the rest of the season with 
the Yankees, and his playoff performance was shaky, but his team triumphed 
in the 2000 World Series and Neagle earned a World Series ring. In December 
2000, the Colorado Rockies signed Neagle and fellow left-hander Mike Hampton 
to expensive contracts. Neagle's contract was for five years and US$51 
million,[2] and his 17-19 record and 5.31 ERA over the 2001 and 2002 seasons 
spelled disaster for the Rockies. Due to injuries, Neagle only started 
seven games in 2003. He went 2–4 with a 7.90 ERA, pitching what was to 
be his last Major League game on July 20, 2003. Neagle missed the 2004 
season due to ligament and elbow surgeries. Then, in late November 2004, 
a Denver policeman ticketed him for soliciting a woman for oral sex. Less 
than a week later, the Rockies canceled the final year of his lucrative 
contract, citing a morals clause in his contract.[3] The incident ultimately 
led to the end of Neagle's marriage. He signed with the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays before the 2005 season, but did not play due to injury. Denny Neagle 
was born and raised in the Annapolis, Maryland suburb of Gambrills, and 
graduated from Arundel High School. On January 24, 2006, Neagle pleaded 
guilty in Jefferson County, Colorado, on one charge of patronizing a prostitute.[4] 
Although the sentence can carry a maximum of a $500 fine and up to six 
months in prison, Neagle was only sentenced to 40 hours of community service. 
On August 27, 2007, Neagle was arrested for and later pleaded guilty to 
driving under the influence.[5] On December 13, 2007, Neagle was mentioned 
in the Mitchell Report in connection with steroids. In 2012 he sued his 
financial adviser, William S. Leavitt, for placing his investment of 80%
