Sports in New York's Capital District are not well known but the area has 
a rich history of professional teams and college athletics. The "major 
league" sport of the region is thoroughbred horse racing at the Saratoga 
Race Course, which has been held annually since 1863 with only a few breaks. 
The Saratoga Race Course is the oldest racetrack in the US, and possibly 
the oldest sporting venue of any kind in the country.[1] The Saratoga meet 
runs for 40 racing days beginning in July and ending on Labor Day,[2] and 
includes fifteen grade I stakes races. The Travers Stakes, America's "Midsummer 
Derby" is the highlight of the meet; winners include Man o' War, Whirlaway, 
Native Dancer, Sword Dancer, Alydar, and Birdstone. According to legend 
the game of baseball was invented by Abner Doubleday of Ballston Spa. The 
Troy Trojans were a Major League Baseball team in the National League for 
four seasons from 1879 to 1882. In 1883 the New York Gothams, later the 
New York and San Francisco Giants, took the Trojans place in the National 
League. Nearly half of the original Gotham players had been members of 
the Trojans. Many other Major League ballplayers have had their start at 
various levels in the Capital District, including Derek Jeter of the New 
York Yankees who once played for the Albany-Colonie Yankees.[3] NBA head 
coach of the Los Angeles Lakers Phil Jackson won his first championship 
ring when he guided the Albany Patroons to the 1984 CBA championship. Three 
years later, the Patroons completed a 50â€“6 regular season, including winning 
all 28 of their home games; at that time, Denver Nuggets head coach George 
Karl was the Patroons' head coach. Future NBA stars Mario Elie and Vincent 
Askew were part of that season's squad. A third NBA head coach has roots 
in the Capital District as well, Pat Riley, most famous as the coach of 
the Los Angeles Lakers, but also of the New York Knicks and Miami Heat. 
Riley played for Linton High School in Schenectady,[4] where he was also 
a football star. He also played on the Schenectady Little League Baseball 
team when in 1954 it won the Little League Baseball World Series. Mike 
Tyson received his early training in the Capital District and his first 
professional fight was in Albany in 1985 and Tyson's first televised fight 
was in Troy in 1986. He fought professionally four times in Albany and 
twice each in Troy and Glens Falls between 1985 and 1986. Since 1988, the 
Siena College men's basketball team (the Siena Saints) have appeared in 
six NCAA Tournaments (1989, 1999, 2002, 2008, 2009, and 2010). Since 2005, 
the University at Albany Great Danes men's basketball team has appeared 
in four NCAA Tournaments (2006, 2007, 2013, and 2014). The University at 
Albany Great Danes women's basketball team has made three consecutive NCAA 
Tournaments (2012, 2013, and 2014). Roller derby leagues in the area include 
Albany's Albany All-Stars Roller Derby,[5][6] Troy's Hellions of Troy Roller 
Derby.[7] and Capital District Men's Roller Derby.[8] The Dutchman's Shoes 
trophy is awarded to the winner of the annual college football game between 
the RPI Engineers and the Union College Dutchmen, the oldest football rivalry 
in New York. Many sports figures have connections to the Capital District:
