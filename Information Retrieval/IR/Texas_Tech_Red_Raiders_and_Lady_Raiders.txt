The Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Texas Tech Lady Raiders are the athletic 
teams that represent Texas Tech University (TTU). The women's basketball 
team uses the name Lady Raiders; however, the school's other women's teams 
use the "Red Raiders" name. The university's athletic program fields 17 
varsity teams in 11 sports all of whom have combined to win 62 conference 
championships as well as 4 national championships.[2] The Masked Rider 
and Raider Red serve as the mascots representing the teams, and the school 
colors are scarlet and black. Texas Tech participates in the NCAA Division 
I and is a founding member of the Big 12 Conference. From 1932 until 1956, 
the university belonged to the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association. 
Texas Tech was admitted to the Southwest Conference on May 12, 1956. When 
the Southwest Conference disbanded in 1995, Texas Tech, along with the 
University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, and Baylor University, 
joined with all eight former members of the Big Eight Conference to form 
the Big 12 Conference. The university's athletic director is College Football 
Playoff committee representative Kirby Hocutt. Bob Knight, the most victorious 
coach in men's Division I basketball history, coached the Red Raiders men's 
basketball team from 2001 to 2008. Following Bob Knight's retirement in 
2008, his son Pat Knight assumed head coaching duties. The Red Raiders 
football team, which has been coached by Mike Leach from 2000 to 2009, 
is a member of the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision and has appeared in the 
19th-most bowl games of any team. Tommy Tuberville was named head coach 
in 2010 following the firing of Mike Leach and remained in the position 
until 2012 before resigning. He was replaced by former Texas Tech quarterback 
Kliff Kingsbury in 2013. In 1993, led by coach Marsha Sharp, the Lady Raiders 
basketball team won the NCAA Women's Basketball Championship. Following 
Sharp's retirement in 2006, Kristy Curry was named Lady Raiders head coach. 
Red Raiders baseball coach Larry Hays, who is one of only four coaches 
in NCAA baseball history to win 1,500 career games, retired in 2008. On 
February 24, 1925, an article published in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
suggested Tech's athletic teams be called the "Dogies" explaining that 
"a Dogie is a calf whose mother died and is forced to look out for itself" 
and "If ever anything had to rustle for itself, it was West Texas and Tech 
College."[3] Texas Tech competes in the following varsity sports: Men's 
sports Women's sports Behind football and men's basketball, baseball is 
the third oldest sport at Texas Tech. The initial team organized in 1925 
and the first game, an 18–9 victory over West Texas State Teachers College, 
was played in 1926.[4] In the following game, the team suffered its first 
ever loss, 14–9 to the team it had previously defeated. The third game 
in the team's history—this one against Daniel Baker College—ended in a 
3–3 tie after 11 innings.[5] E. Y. Freeland was the first coach of the 
Red Raiders, though the team was known as the Matadors at the time. He 
remained in the position for three years before R. Grady Higginbotham took 
the role. Higginbotham coached for only two years.[4] From 1930 to 1953, 
Tech did not field an intercollegiate baseball team.[5] When the program 
returned in 1954, Beattie Feathers became the head coach of the Red Raiders 
and remained until 1960. He was followed by Berl Huffman (1961–1967), Kal 
Segrist (1968–1983), and Gary Ashby (1984–1986). Upon Ashby's departure, 
Larry Hays became the head coach of the team.[4] Texas Tech's baseball 
team plays at Dan Law Field at Rip Griffin Park and is coached by Dan Spencer. 
Larry Hays had been the Red Raider's head coach for the previous 22 years 
and accumulated over 800 wins with Texas Tech.[6] On April 2, 2008, Hays 
became just the fourth coach in NCAA baseball history to win 1,500 career 
games.[7][8] The Red Raider's first ever win came on April 5, 1926 against 
New Mexico Military Institute.[9] During the 1990s, Tech players drew notice 
from 17 big league organizations. Two Red Raiders were selected in the 
second round, one each in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds.[10] As of 
2002, 16 former Tech players have appeared in Major League Baseball.[11] 
Larry Hays took over the Red Raiders baseball team in 1987. Under Hays, 
Texas Tech endured only two losing seasons, his first and last, and enjoyed 
their greatest success in baseball. Hays took Tech from having a losing 
tradition to being a national contender. When Hays started with the Red 
Raiders, the team's overall record stood at 550–576. By the time he left, 
he was the fourth-winningest coach is college baseball history and the 
team's record had improved to 1,365–1,054–9.[12] The Red Raiders reached 
eight straight NCAA tournaments from 1995–2002 and again in 2004, three 
of which were held at Dan Law Field.[13] They also won two conference championships, 
in 1995 (while still in the Southwest Conference) and 1997, and two conference 
tournament championships, in 1996 and 1998.[12] The team is currently coached 
by Tim Tadlock who was hired as associate head coach for the Red Raiders 
under Dan Spencer. The following season saw Tadlock replace Spencer as 
the ninth head coach of the Red Raiders following Spencer's firing. Tadlock's 
first season saw the team finish 26–30, and 8th of 9 in Big 12 play. Prior 
to the 2014 season, the Red Raiders were selected to finish in 8th place 
in the Big 12 Conference in the preseason polls. In only his second season, 
the Red Raiders won their first NCAA Tournament Regional Championship, 
defeating the Columbia Lions and host team Miami Hurricanes to advance 
to the program's first Super Regional appearance. The team would host the 
College of Charleston in the Super Regional round before shutting them 
out twice in two 1-0 games, earning the programs first berth in the College 
World Series on the back of a 0.65 post season earned run average produced 
by assistant coach Ray Hayward's pitching staff.[6] Texas Tech's cross 
country and indoor/outdoor track & field teams are coached by Wes Kittley. 
Under his leadership, the program has reached new heights. At the 2005 
Outdoor National Championships, Tech qualified 31 men's and women's athletes, 
more than any other school in the country.[14] Under Kittley's tutelage, 
Texas Tech has produced 16 national champions, seven Olympic Medalists, 
over 200 All-Americans and over 119 Big 12 Champions.[15] From 1990 to 
2006, the men's team garnered 91 All-America awards, 20 Big 12 championships, 
and one individual national title. In the same time period, the women's 
team won 32 All-America awards, 29 Big 12 championships, and five individual 
national titles. During the 2007/08 season, the women had another strong 
showing behind Sally Kipyego, who won four individual national titles (cross 
country, indoor 3000 m and 5000 m, outdoor 10,000 m) and placed second 
in her bid for a fifth title in one academic year (outdoor 5000 m). Kipyego 
added three more national titles (cross country, indoor 5000 m, outdoor 
5000 m) and one more second-place win (outdoor 1500 m) during the 2007/08 
season. Under Kipyego's leadership, the women's team captured its first 
title in 2008. Their success was followed by another national championship 
appearance in 2009 and 2010.[16] Kennedy Kithuka followed up on the prior 
success of the program by winning the 2012 NCAA Cross Country Championship, 
being the first in the men's program to do so. For his accomplishments, 
Kithuka was named the 2012 National Male Athlete of the Year for cross 
country.[17] In 2015 NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships, 
Jacorian Duffield and Bradley Adkins won 1st and 2nd place respectively 
in the high jump event. The men's team has won two Big 12 Champions (2005, 
2014) and the women's teams has won three (2008, 2009, 2010). The Red Raiders 
football team is a member of the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly 
known as Division I-A). Texas Tech played its first intercollegiate football 
game on October 3, 1925. The contest, against McMurry University, ended 
in a controversial 0–0 tie. Tech's Elson Archibald seemed to have kicked 
a game-winning 20-yard field goal but the referee ruled that the clock 
had run out before the score. It was later reported that the referee made 
the call to get revenge because he wanted to be the team's first head coach 
but the job was instead given to Ewing Y. Freeland.[18] Through the 2015 
season, the Texas Tech Red Raider football team has amassed a 551-429-32 
record in 91 seasons (1925–2015). In 1932, the program joined the Border 
Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Five years later, the team won its 
first conference championship and was invited to the Sun Bowl. The game 
was played on January 1, 1938, and resulted in a 6–7 loss to West Virginia.[19] 
Texas Tech suffered four more bowl losses before getting their first postseason 
win in the 1952 Sun Bowl.[19] Before withdrawing for the Border Intercollegiate 
Athletic Association in 1956, the Red Raiders won a total of eight conference 
championships and one co-championship, the most titles held by a Border 
Conference team. In 1960, Texas Tech was admitted to the Southwest Conference 
(SWC). The Red Raiders won conference co-championships in 1976 and 1994.[20] 
The team remained in the SWC until the conference ceased operations 1996. 
Following the dissolution of the SWC, the university became a charter member 
of the Big 12 Conference. In the Big 12 Conference, the Red Raiders competed 
in the South Division from the athletic conference's formation until the 
2010 season when the divisions were dissolved. The Red Raiders, coached 
by Mike Leach from 2000–09, earned 56 wins from the 2000 through the 2006 
season. During the same period, only three other Big 12 teams had more 
victories—Oklahoma, Texas, and Nebraska.[21] In fourteen of its last fifteen 
seasons Tech finished with a winning record, before suffering a losing 
season in 2011 under then-head coach Tommy Tuberville.[22][23] Tuberville 
resigned his position and was replaced by Kliff Kingsbury in 2013. The 
Red Raiders have made 36 bowl appearances(14-21-1), which is 20th most 
of any university.[24] 2007 saw the men's golf team compete in its first 
back-to-back National Championship tournaments since 1960. The team, coached 
by Greg Sands, qualified for the tournament after finishing 7th in NCAA 
Central Regional.[25] The Texas Tech Ice Hockey Team was established in 
1999. As a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association, the Red 
Raiders compete with Big XII Conference Teams as well as with colleges 
throughout the United States and Canada. Players are recruited from the 
United States, Canada, and abroad. Basketball came to Texas Tech only two 
years after the school was founded and the program has since won 18 conference 
titles, the last one being in 1996, all of which have been won while the 
Red Raiders were in their Border Conference and Southwest Conference tenures. 
The inaugural game was a 37–25 loss to Daniel Baker College. Tech would 
lose two more games before finally clinching their first ever victory—35–21 
at Sul Ross University.[26][27] Grady Higginbotham was the first coach, 
earning a 14–18 record over two seasons. At .438, Higgenbotham was the 
only Tech basketball coach to garner an overall losing record during his 
stay. Following Higgenbotham's departure, Victor Payne led the Matadors 
(as the school's teams were known until 1936) from 1927 to 1930.[28] His 
final tally stood at 32 wins and 20 losses. W. L. Golightly coached only 
one season, bringing in an 11–9 record. Dell Morgan held the head coaching 
job from 1931 to 1934, chalking up 42 wins to 29 losses. He was followed 
by Virgil Ballard. Though Ballard coached only a single season, it was 
during his time that the team won their milestone 100th game, a one-point 
victory over House of David. Ballard left with a 15–9 record.[26] Berl 
Huffman was twice the head basketball coach at Texas Tech—first from 1935 
to 1942 and then from 1946 to 1947. During his total of eight seasons, 
he garnered a record of 121–67. Polk Robison was the only other person 
to serve two different times as the head basketball coach at the school. 
When Huffman left in 1942, Robison took the job. And, when Huffman left 
a second time in 1947, it was Robison who again filled the position, this 
time remaining until 1961. At a total of 18 seasons, his stay is the second 
longest of any Red Raiders basketball coach, behind Gerald Myers. He departed 
after leading his teams to 254 wins, 195 losses, and the first two NCAA 
tournaments in school history.[27] Gene Gibson followed Robison into the 
position. In his eight seasons, he chalked up the second worst record of 
any head basketball coach at Tech. Still, at 100–92, there were eight more 
wins than losses. Bob Bass led the program to a 22–15 record over a season-and-a-half 
before returning to professional basketball coaching duties.[27][29] Bob 
Knight became the men's basketball coach in 2001. He retired on February 
4, 2008. On New Year's Day 2007, a 70–68 defeat of New Mexico by Tech marked 
the 880th total win for Knight, making him the winningest coach in men's 
college basketball history. Knight also has several other distinctions, 
including being the only coach to win the NCAA, the NIT, the Olympic Gold, 
and the Pan-Am Gold, and has been given several awards. Knight was succeeded 
by his son Pat Knight. After Pat Knight's termination, Billy Gillispie 
was named head coach on March 20, 2011 and subsequently resigned due to 
health reasons after one season following while also being amidst allegations 
of mistreating players. Chris Walker took over on an interim basis for 
the 2012 season and led the red raiders to an 11-20 record. In March 2013, 
Tubby Smith was named the new men's basketball coach and lead the team 
to its first upset over a top 25 opponent since 2009. Texas Tech students 
broke both school and Big 12 Conference records for student attendance 
at the United Spirit Arena during a February 25, 2014 loss to Kansas State. 
The record of 6,086 students fell less than 2,000 short of the national 
record.[30] The Red Raiders softball program began in 1981 but the program 
was dropped after only five seasons. When Texas Tech joined the Big 12 
Conference as a charter member, the program was resurrected in time for 
the inaugural 1996 season. Shanon Hays, the first Lubbock Christian University 
head softball coach, turned the Red Raider softball team around from a 
15-42 season under interim head coach Amy Suiter to 80-34 in just his first 
two seasons. Hays led the Red Raiders to three NCAA Regional appearances 
during his five seasons at the helm. Adrian Gregory was named the seventh 
head coach in Texas Tech history in June 2014. Tim Siegel has been coaching 
at Tech for 15 years, helping the men's tennis team to numerous winning 
seasons. Siegel was recently honored as the 2008 Big 12 Coach of the Year.[31] 
He has coached players who are now college coaches themselves.[32] The 
men's tennis team had a very successful 2008 season being ranked as high 
as #17 in the nation. The Red Raiders faced 11 ranked teams and have only 
lost to two, #31 TCU and #11 Tulsa.[33] Texas Tech ended the regular season 
ranked #17.[31] Most recently, the Red Raiders 2012 season resulted in 
a closing ITA ranking of 19. The Texas Tech tennis team won the Border 
Conference tennis championship in 1936, 1937, and 1950. The woman's team, 
led by Todd Petty, won the Big 12 Conference in 2012.[34] Of the varsity 
sports, Texas Tech has had its greatest success in women's basketball with 
13 conference titles and 1 national championship. Led by its star player 
Sheryl Swoopes and head coach Marsha Sharp, the Lady Raiders won the NCAA 
Women's Basketball Championship in 1993. In early 2006, Lady Raiders coach 
Marsha Sharp retired and was replaced on March 30, 2006 by Kristy Curry, 
who had been the coach at Purdue. Curry accepted the same position at The 
University of Alabama on May 11, 2013 and was replaced by Candace Whitaker, 
a former player for Texas Tech in the 1990s, who was named head coach on 
May 22, 2013. The Texas Tech volleyball program began in 1975. The Red 
Raiders were most recently coached by Don Flora (2011–15). In addition 
to varsity sports, the university's Sport Clubs Federation offers 30 recreational 
and competitive sport clubs, including polo, rugby union, lacrosse, fencing, 
and soccer.[35] Of the clubs sports, Texas Tech's Polo Club team, coached 
by Clyde Waddell, has had the greatest success. In spite of having no previous 
experience, at the invitation of students, Waddell took the job in 2000. 
Six year later, the team beat in-state rival Texas A&M to win the United 
States Polo Association National Intercollegiate Championship.[36] Texas 
Tech's rodeo club team competes in the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association 
and won the 1955 championship at the College National Finals Rodeo.[37] 
Texas Tech rugby plays in Division 1-A in the Allied Rugby Conference, 
a conference composed primarily of schools from the Big 12 South, against 
its traditional rivals such as Texas and Texas A&M. For the 2011–12 year, 
Texas Tech had also fielded a side to play in Division 2, where they won 
the Texas championship and qualified for the national playoffs.[38][39] 
Jones AT&T Stadium serves as home to the Red Raiders football team. The 
stadium, named for Clifford B. and Audrey Jones, opened in 1947. In 2000, 
the stadium was renamed Jones SBC Stadium after SBC Communications made 
a $30 million contribution to the university. Following SBC Communications' 
acquisition of AT&T Corporation in 2006, the stadium was renamed Jones 
AT&T Stadium.[40] The stadium's original seating capacity was 27,000, but 
it was expanded in 1959, 1972, 2003, 2005, 2009, 2010, and 2013 to the 
current capacity of 60,862. Overall, from 1999 to 2009 the school spent 
more than $84 million for ongoing renovation and expansion to the stadium 
and the football program.[41] In January 2013, construction began adding 
another 368 seats in the north endzone, in addition to an observation deck 
that will hold 40. The $11 million project also includes a significantly 
upgraded jumbotron with a new sound system, a Spanish Renaissance-themed 
colonnade, and a new north end zone concourse connecting the two stadium 
halves. Along with the other additions, 157 feet of ribbon board will be 
added on the north end zone, more than 160 linear feet in the northeast 
and northwest corners of the stadium, and 94 linear feet in the south end 
zone over the athletic offices. All of the new features of Jones AT&T Stadium 
were unveiled on September 7, 2013 .[42] Since 1999, home basketball games 
have been played at United Supermarkets Arena (originally United Spirit 
Arena), a 15,020-seat multi-purpose facility which cost $62 million to 
build.[43] In addition to serving as home to the men's and women's basketball 
teams, the arena is used by the Red Raiders volleyball team. Texas Tech 
has won 1 NCAA team national championship.[44] Below are the 3 National 
team titles that are not bestowed by the NCAA: Texas Tech has won 64 conference 
championships: 17 Big 12 Conference titles, 27 Southwest Conference (SWC) 
titles, and 22 Border Conference titles.[34][46] The Red Raiders were originally 
known as the "Matadors" from 1925–1936. As the school was thinking of an 
appropriate nickname for its athletic teams in 1925, the wife of the first 
football coach suggested "Matadors" to reflect the influence of the campus' 
Spanish Renaissance architecture. The students followed the suggestion, 
and later chose red and black as the school colors to represent a matador's 
traditional garb. Coincidentally, the football team won its first game 
right after it had adopted the name.[47] The nickname and school colors 
became official during a formal convocation on March 15, 1926.[48] There 
are two main stories as to how the name "Red Raiders" replaced its predecessor. 
In one story, football coach Pete Cawthon ordered attractive scarlet uniforms 
to help the team's identity. The football team, wearing its new outfit, 
defeated heavily favored Loyola in Los Angeles on October 26, 1934.[49] 
A Los Angeles sports writer called the Matadors a "red raiding team". Other 
writers who covered Tech sports caught on with the term and successfully 
promoted the use of "Red Raiders". In the other tale, former Lubbock Avalanche-Journal 
sports columnist Collier Parris, reporting on a 1932 Tech football game, 
wrote: "The Red Raiders from Texas Tech, terror of the Southwest this year, 
swooped into the New Mexico University camp today." The name soon became 
popular afterward and by 1936, it officially replaced "Matadors" at the 
same time the Saddle Tramps came about.[47] Red Raider spirit is led by 
such organizations as the Saddle Tramps, the High Riders, and the spirit 
squads (consisting of the cheer squad and the pom squad). In April 2010, 
the Texas Tech cheer squad finished third at the National Cheerleaders 
Association and National Dance Association.[50] The Masked Rider is Texas 
Tech University's oldest mascot. The tradition began in 1936, when "ghost 
riders" circled the field prior to home football games. The Masked Rider 
became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto 
the field at the Gator Bowl. According to reports from those present at 
the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his 
horse, Blackie, rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After 
a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer 
for the Atlanta Journal who witnessed the event, later wrote, "No team 
in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance."[51][52] In 2000, 
The Masked Rider tradition was commemorated with the unveiling of a statue 
outside of the university's Frazier Alumni Pavilion. The sculpture, created 
by artist Grant Speed, is 25 percent larger than life.[53] Today the Masked 
Rider, with guns up, leads the team onto the field for all home games. 
This mascot, adorned in a distinctive gaucho hat like the ones worn by 
members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas 
Tech. Ashley Wenzel, a sophomore education major from Friendswood, Texas, 
will represent the university as the Masked Rider during 2012–13.[54] Texas 
Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a more recent creation. Beginning with 
the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion 
of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. 
For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's 
horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle 
Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the 
Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk 
West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor.[55] Though the Masked 
Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that 
Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her 
tenure.[56] The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle 
Tramps or High Riders. Texas Tech's main athletic rivals are the Texas 
Longhorns and Texas A&M Aggies.[57][58][59] It is common for people to 
camp out in front of Jones AT&T Stadium a few days prior to home football 
games against the Aggies, the Longhorns, and the Oklahoma Sooners.[60][61] 
In March 2009, Texas Tech and Baylor reached an agreement to move their 
next two football games to the Dallas metropolitan area. The schools played 
November 28, 2009, at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington with Tech claiming the 
victory. The next game was scheduled for October 9, 2010, at the Cotton 
Bowl Stadium during the State Fair of Texas, with Tech emerging victorious 
again.[62][63] The arrangement was extended for an additional two years.[64] 
Head coaches of Texas Tech teams include: In the sports world, Texas Tech 
Red Raiders have gone on to play in the NFL, NBA, WNBA, Major League Baseball, 
and more. Current alumni standouts include NFL All-Pros Zach Thomas of 
the Kansas City Chiefs, Wes Welker of the Denver Broncos, Danny Amendola 
of the New England Patriots, and Michael Crabtree of the Oakland Raiders.[68][69]
