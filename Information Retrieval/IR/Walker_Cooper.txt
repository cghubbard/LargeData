William Walker Cooper (January 8, 1915 – April 11, 1991) was an American 
professional baseball player.[1] He was a catcher in Major League Baseball 
who played for six National League teams from 1940 to 1957.[1] He was known 
as one of the top catchers in baseball during the 1940s and early 1950s.[2] 
A native of Atherton, Missouri, Cooper was a solid defensive catcher as 
well as a strong hitter, making the National League All-Star team every 
year from 1942 to 1950.[1] After being stuck in the Cardinals' talent-rich 
farm system in the late 1930s, he finally broke in with the team in late 
1940 at age 25 (and reportedly complained to umpire Beans Reardon about 
the first pitch he saw);[2] but a broken collarbone limited his play to 
68 games in 1941. On August 30 of that year, Cooper caught Lon Warneke's 
no-hitter.[3] In 1942 he batted .281, finishing among the National League's 
top ten players in slugging, doubles and triples as St. Louis won the pennant 
by two games;[4] brother Mort won the Most Valuable Player Award.[5] Batting 
fifth, he hit .286 in the World Series against the defending champion New 
York Yankees, driving in the winning run in Game 4 and scoring the winning 
run on Whitey Kurowski's home run in the ninth inning of the final Game 
5; he then picked Joe Gordon off second base with no outs in the bottom 
of the ninth inning, as the team earned its first title in eight years.[6][7] 
In 1943 he raised his average to a career-high .318, and was third in the 
National League in batting and slugging and fifth in RBI,[8] as the Cardinals 
repeated as league champions; he was runnerup in the Most Valuable Player 
Award vote to teammate Stan Musial.[9] In the 1943 World Series he batted 
.294 as the clean-up hitter, but St. Louis lost the rematch with the Yankees. 
In 1944 his average dipped only slightly to .317 as the Cardinals won their 
third straight pennant, facing the crosstown St. Louis Browns in the World 
Series; again batting cleanup, he hit .318 in the Series and scored the 
team's first run in the final Game 6, and the Cardinals won another title.[10] 
World War II service in the Navy led him to appear in only four games in 
1945, and before his return the New York Giants purchased his contract 
following a salary dispute in January 1946;[11] the sale by the Cardinals 
for $175,000 ($2,127,176 today) was the highest cash-only deal ever to 
that time; the transactions of Joe Cronin in 1934 and Dizzy Dean in 1938 
were larger deals, but also involved other players. Cooper enjoyed his 
most productive season at the plate in 1947, when he hit .305 and compiled 
career highs in home runs (35), RBI (122), runs (79), hits (157) triples 
(8) and games (140);[1] the Giants set a new major league record with 221 
home runs. In that season, Cooper homered in six consecutive games to tie 
a record set by George Kelly in 1924.[2] After Leo Durocher became Giants 
manager in 1948, he began revamping the team to emphasize speed, and Cooper 
was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in June 1949 after starting the year 
hitting .211.[11] Three weeks later, on July 6, Cooper became the only 
catcher in major league history, and one of only eleven players, to have 
hit 10 or more RBI in a single game; he was 6-for-7, including three home 
runs and five runs.[2] That year, he also led National League catchers 
in assists for the only time in his career. In May 1950 he was traded to 
the Boston Braves, where he caught Vern Bickford's no-hitter on August 
11 of that year.[11][12] He remained with the Braves through their 1953 
move to Milwaukee, batting over .300 in his first two seasons with the 
club.[1] Cooper holds the distinction of being the last man to come to 
bat at Boston's Braves Field, flying out to Brooklyn's Andy Pafko. Cooper 
signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates before the 1954 season but was let go 
in May after hitting only .200; he was picked up by the Chicago Cubs, and 
hit well as a backup catcher and pinch-hitter through 1955.[11] He then 
returned to St. Louis to spend his last two seasons as a Cardinal, ending 
his career in October 1957. After his daughter, Sara (Miss Missouri 1957), 
married Cardinals second baseman Don Blasingame, he noted, "It's time to 
quit when you've got a daughter old enough to marry a teammate." In an 
eighteen-year major league career, Cooper played in 1,473 games, accumulating 
1,341 hits in 4,702 at bats for a .285 career batting average along with 
173 home runs, 812 runs batted in, and a .464 slugging percentage.[1] He 
led National League catchers three times in range factor, twice in caught 
stealing percentage, and once in assists, finishing with a .977 career 
fielding percentage.[1] One of the sport's strongest players in his prime,[2][13] 
at the end of his career he ranked among the top five National League catchers 
in career batting average (.285), slugging average (.464), home runs (173) 
and runs batted in (812). He also batted .300 over three World Series with 
the St. Louis Cardinals from 1942 to 1944 as the team won two championships,[14] 
and ranked tenth in National League history in both games (1,223) and putouts 
(5,166) behind the plate when he retired. During his career, he set a record 
by hitting grand slams with five different teams (a mark subsequently tied 
by Dave Kingman and Dave Winfield). His .464 slugging average then placed 
him behind only Roy Campanella (.500) and Gabby Hartnett (.489) among players 
with 1,000 National League games as a catcher, and his 173 HRs and 812 
RBI put him behind only Campanella (242, 856), Hartnett (236, 1,179), and 
Ernie Lombardi (190, 990). His older brother, Mort Cooper, was a National 
League pitcher and his teammate for the first few years of his career, 
and his son-in-law, Don Blasingame, also was a major leaguer. After his 
playing career, he managed the Indianapolis Indians (1958–59) and Dallas-Fort 
Worth Rangers (1961) of the Triple-A American Association and was a coach 
for the 1960 Kansas City Athletics, before leaving the game.[15] Walker
