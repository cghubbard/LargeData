As Player As Manager David James Bancroft (April 20, 1891 – October 9, 
1972) was an American baseball shortstop and manager. Nicknamed "Beauty" 
for his penchant for calling good pitches "beauties", he played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) from 1915 to 1930, for the Philadelphia Phillies, 
New York Giants, Boston Braves, and Brooklyn Robins. Born in Sioux City, 
Iowa, Bancroft played in minor league baseball from 1909 through 1914, 
at which point he was bought by the Phillies. The Giants traded for Bancroft 
during the 1920 season. After playing for the Giants through the 1923 season, 
he became player-manager of the Braves, serving in that role for four years. 
After he was fired by the Braves, Bancroft played two seasons for the Robins 
and ended his playing career with the Giants the next season. He coached 
with the Giants, then managed in the minor leagues and the All-American 
Girls Professional Baseball League. Bancroft was part of the Giants' World 
Series championship teams in 1921 and 1922. He was also a part of the National 
League pennant-winning teams of 1915 and 1923. Considered an excellent 
defensive shortstop and a smart ball player, Bancroft was elected to the 
Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971. However, his election 
was not without controversy, as the Veterans Committee included former 
teammates of Bancroft, resulting in charges of cronyism against the Veterans 
Committee. Bancroft was born in Sioux City, Iowa, the youngest of three 
children of Ella (née Gearhart) and Frank Bancroft. Frank worked as a news 
vendor on the Milwaukee Railroad.[1][2] Bancroft attended Hopkins Grade 
School and Sioux City High School.[1] In the summer after his junior year 
of high school, at the age of 18, Bancroft began his professional career 
in 1909 with the Duluth White Sox of the Class-D Minnesota–Wisconsin League. 
Bancroft did not have immediate success, registering a .210 batting average 
and .917 fielding percentage in 111 games, but he developed a positive 
reputation in the league.[2] The Superior Blues acquired Bancroft at midseason, 
and he remained there through the 1911 season.[1][3] Bancroft finished 
the 1911 season with a .273 batting average and 41 stolen bases,[1] and 
the Blues won the league championship.[4] The Portland Beavers of the Class-AA 
Pacific Coast League (PCL) drafted Bancroft from Superior for the 1912 
season.[1] He struggled in 1912, batting .207, and was demoted to the Portland 
Colts of the Class-B Northwestern League in 1913. After batting .244 for 
the Colts, he was promoted back to the Beavers in 1914, where he batted 
.271 and drew comparisons to former Beavers star shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh 
as the team won the PCL championship.[1] While with the Beavers, Bancroft 
earned the nickname "Beauty", for his habit of referring to pitches as 
"beauties" while he batted.[1][5] Before the 1915 season, the Philadelphia 
Phillies purchased Bancroft from Portland for $5,000 ($117,155 in current 
dollar terms). Portland's manager was quoted as saying he did not expect 
Bancroft would last with the Phillies.[6] In his rookie season, Bancroft 
finished second in the National League (NL) to teammate Gavvy Cravath in 
walks (77), third in runs scored (85), and tied Fred Luderus for sixth 
in home runs (7).[7] For his ability to hit with power from both sides 
of the plate, The Pittsburgh Press declared he was developing into "a second 
Honus Wagner".[8] The Phillies won their first NL pennant in 1915,[1][9] 
but lost the 1915 World Series to the Boston Red Sox. Bancroft's offense 
contributed to the Phillies' victory in Game 1, as he had an infield hit 
leading to the Phillies' winning run.[10] Though the Phillies batted .182 
as a team in the series, Bancroft batted .294.[11] Bancroft batted third 
in the Phillies' lineup in 1916.[4] However, he slumped to a .212 batting 
average that season, the lowest of his career. Despite his offensive struggles, 
he gained recognition for his fielding skills, and an injury to Bancroft 
late in the season contributed to the Phillies' poor play late in the season.[12][13] 
Bancroft feuded with Cravath, who became the Phillies' manager in 1919.[14] 
Before the 1919 season, Bancroft requested a trade to the Cincinnati Reds,[15] 
but the trade request was not granted. John McGraw, manager of the New 
York Giants, coveted Bancroft due to his intelligent and hard-nosed style 
of playing. Upon McGraw's urging, the Giants traded Art Fletcher, Bill 
Hubbell and $100,000 ($1,183,223 in current dollar terms) to the Phillies 
for Bancroft on June 7, 1920.[1][16] With the Giants, Bancroft was an able 
performer.[17] His 102 runs scored during the 1920 season were second only 
to new Giants teammate George Burns.[18] On June 1, 1921, in a game the 
Giants won against the Phillies, Bancroft hit for the cycle.[19][20] His 
153 games played in the 1921 season tied for second in the NL with several 
others, behind only Rogers Hornsby. He also tied teammate Frankie Frisch 
for second with 121 runs scored, behind only Hornsby, while his 193 hits 
were eighth-best and his .389 on-base percentage was ninth-best in the 
NL.[21] However, he only batted .152 in the 1921 World Series, which the 
Giants won over the New York Yankees in eight games.[22] Bancroft played 
in all 156 games in the 1922 season. He tied Jack Smith for third with 
117 runs scored, finished third with 209 hits, and tied Bob O'Farrell for 
second with 79 walks.[23] His .321 batting average was his career-high. 
He set an MLB record for the most fielding chances by a shortstop in a 
season (984).[24] Though the Giants swept the 1922 World Series from the 
Yankees in four games, he again had a poor World Series, batting .211.[25] 
Serving as team captain,[26] Bancroft began to suffer through leg injuries 
in 1923.[27] He was also hospitalized with a case of pneumonia during the 
season.[28] Bancroft returned by the postseason, but batted .091 in the 
1923 World Series,[29] which the Yankees won in six games.[30] With a young 
Travis Jackson ready to succeed Bancroft as the Giants' shortstop, and 
with Bancroft desiring an opportunity to manage, McGraw traded Bancroft 
to the Boston Braves with Bill Cunningham and Casey Stengel for Joe Oeschger 
and Billy Southworth after the 1923 season.[1][31][32] McGraw was also 
looking to aid his former star Christy Mathewson, who was then the General 
Manager of the Braves.[33] Bancroft served as player–manager for the Braves 
for three seasons, from 1924 through 1927. Upon becoming manager, he became 
the youngest manager in the National League (NL).[1][33] He missed time 
during the 1924 season with appendicitis.[34] After finishing in last place 
in the eight-team NL, Bancroft overhauled the Braves' roster for the 1925 
season.[35] However, he lost the services of Rube Marquard and Joe Genewich,[36] 
and the Braves finished in fifth place.[37] Bancroft suggested that Bob 
Smith, ineffective as an infielder, become a pitcher; Smith's successes 
as a pitcher benefited the Braves' starting rotation.[38] The Braves lacked 
offense going into the 1926 season,[39] but hoped their pitching and defense 
could lead them into contention.[38][39] The Braves finished in seventh 
place in the NL in 1926 and 1927.[40][41] Failing to turn the Braves into 
a winning team, Bancroft requested his release from the team after the 
1927 season. He signed with the Brooklyn Robins the same day.[42][43] Stating 
that he was happy to no longer have the stress of managing,[44] he played 
for the Robins for the 1928 and 1929 seasons. During his time with the 
Robins, he was seen as a possible successor to manager Wilbert Robinson.[45] 
The Robins released Bancroft after the 1929 season, and he returned to 
the Giants as assistant manager and coach, serving under McGraw.[46] He 
ended his MLB playing career in 1930. He remained as a coach, filling in 
for McGraw when he was too ill to manage.[1][3][47] During the 1930 offseason, 
he led a team of MLB players on an exhibition trip to Cuba.[48] When McGraw 
retired in 1932, the Giants appointed Bill Terry as player-manager. Surprised 
and disappointed that Terry was chosen over him, Bancroft left the Giants.[1][3] 
After retiring as a player, Bancroft managed in minor league baseball. 
He managed the Minneapolis Millers of the Class-AA American Association 
in 1933.[49] Though the Millers reached the championship series,[50] he 
was not retained for the 1934 season, as the Millers sought a player-manager 
to help the team reduce costs.[51][52] After the season, Bancroft interviewed 
for the managerial job with the Cincinnati Reds;[53] however, the Reds 
hired O'Farrell.[54] Bancroft next managed the Sioux City Cowboys of the 
Class-A Western League in 1936.[55] He appeared in one game for Sioux City 
as a player. Bancroft then managed the St. Cloud Rox of the Class-C Northern 
League in 1947.[56] In the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, 
Bancroft managed the Chicago Colleens in 1948 and South Bend Blue Sox in 
1949 and 1950.[57][58] Grover Cleveland Alexander, Bancroft's teammate 
in Philadelphia, and Hughie Jennings, his coach in New York, considered 
Bancroft one of the best shortstops in MLB.[17][59] Sportswriter Frank 
Graham called Bancroft "the greatest shortstop the Giants ever had and 
one of the greatest that ever lived."[1] Bancroft is still considered to 
be among the top fielders in baseball history.[60][61] He was also considered 
one of the fastest shortstops in baseball.[13] In contrast to other great 
fielding shortstops, Bancroft was noted for his offensive ability.[62] 
"Bancroft is one of the greatest shortstops in the history of the game. 
He can go equally well to his right or left, has a great arm, and is a 
good hitter. In addition, he is pretty fast on his feet. The best hing 
about Bancroft is, he can think. He uses his brain. He is more than a great 
mechanical player. A player like Banny at short means everything to a ball 
club." After failing to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), the Veterans Committee 
elected Bancroft in 1971.[63] Former Giants teammates Terry and Frankie 
Frisch, who joined the Veterans Committee in 1967, aided the elections 
of several of their former teammates. Terry and Frankie shepherded the 
selections of Jesse Haines in 1970, Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, Ross 
Youngs in 1972, George Kelly in 1973, Jim Bottomley in 1974, and Freddie 
Lindstrom in 1976.[64] Bancroft, along with some of the other selections 
made by Terry and Frisch, has been considered among the weakest of all 
inductees.[65][66] According to the BBWAA, the Veterans Committee was not 
selective enough in choosing members.[67] Charges of cronyism were levied 
against the Veterans Committee.[68] This led to the Veterans Committee 
having its powers reduced in subsequent years.[65] Despite the criticism 
of players elected to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in this 
period, Bancroft grades well in terms of sabermetric statistics. He finished 
fourth in the NL in Wins Above Replacement in 1920 (6.5) and third in 1921 
(7.2) and 1922 (6.0).[69][70][71] Bancroft was also inducted in The Des 
Moines Register's Iowa Sports Hall of Fame.[2] Bancroft married Edna Harriet 
Gisin while he played minor league baseball. They had no children and lived 
in Superior, Wisconsin for the remainder of their lives.[1] After retiring 
from baseball, Bancroft worked as a warehouse supervisor for Interprovincial 
Pipeline Company. He retired in 1956 and spent his later years hunting 
and fishing.[1] Bancroft died on October 9, 1972 in a hospital in Superior
