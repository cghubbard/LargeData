Roy Frederick Smalley III (born October 25, 1952) is a former professional 
baseball shortstop. From 1975 through 1987, Smalley played in Major League 
Baseball for the Texas Rangers (1975–76), Minnesota Twins (1976–82; 1985–87), 
New York Yankees (1982–84) and Chicago White Sox (1984). He was a switch-hitter 
and threw right-handed. His father, Roy Jr. was also a former major league 
shortstop, and his uncle, Gene Mauch was a long-time major league manager. 
Drafted out of Westchester High School in Los Angeles in 1970 by the Montreal 
Expos,[1] Smalley played college baseball for one year at Los Angeles City 
College, then transferred to the University of Southern California.[2] 
He was part of the 1972 and 1973 College World Series championship teams 
under longtime head coach Rod Dedeaux. Smalley was named an All-American 
and received All-College World Series honors in 1973. He was drafted four 
times by major league teams between 1970 and 1973 without signing. Smalley 
was selected by the Montreal Expos in the 35th round of the June 1970 draft, 
by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the January 1971 draft, by the 
St. Louis Cardinals in the 2nd round on the June 1971 draft, and again 
by the Red Sox in the 5th round of the January 1972 draft. Smalley was 
the number one overall pick in the January 1974 amateur draft by the Rangers. 
Following his junior year, he stayed out of school in the fall of 1973 
to be eligible for the January free agent draft.[3] After signing in January, 
Smalley had wrist surgery in February, injured while playing semi-pro ball 
in December.[4] He was sent to the Pittsfield Rangers in the Double-A Eastern 
League where he held his own, hitting .251 with 14 home runs and 42 RBI 
as a 21-year-old straight out of college. Following a brief stint with 
the Triple-A Spokane Indians in the Pacific Coast League, Smalley was promoted 
to the big leagues for good, seeing time in 78 games for the Rangers in 
1975, despite hitting only .228 with 3 home runs.[5] Smalley started the 
1976 season back in Texas, but did not improve on his 1975 average. On 
June 1, his career would take a major corner. Under the ownership tenure 
of Calvin Griffith, the Minnesota Twins made few headlines in the transaction 
department, but Smalley's arrival and departure from the Twins both involved 
blockbuster trades. On June 1, 1976, Smalley was traded to the Twins, along 
with Texas infielder Mike Cubbage, pitchers Jim Gideon and Bill Singer 
and cash, for Twins' ace Bert Blyleven and shortstop Danny Thompson, who 
was battling leukemia.[6] Smalley was inserted into the Twins' starting 
lineup and manned shortstop until 1982. During his first go around with 
the Twins, Smalley developed into an all-star. Smalley's best season came 
in 1979, when he was voted the starting shortstop for the American League 
in the All-Star game. Smalley had a sensational first half of the season, 
entering the break with the second-highest batting average in the major 
leagues (.341). Though he tailed off in the second half, Smalley established 
career highs in runs, RBIs, and home runs, and was named the shortstop 
on The Sporting News AL All-Star team. He also led the league in games 
played, plate appearances, all fielders in assists, and all shortstops 
in putouts,[5] while hitting .271 and leading the team with 24 home runs 
and 95 RBI. He did not build on this season with the Twins, as injuries 
struck, and he played only 133 games in 1980 and 56 in 1981. After showing 
that he'd recovered from his injuries, Smalley was traded in 1982 on April 
10 to the Yankees for pitchers Ron Davis and Paul Boris and shortstop Greg 
Gagne. With the Yankees, Smalley showed a glimpse of the player he had 
been in 1979, hitting 20 home runs in 1982 and 18 in 1983. After a bad 
start to the 1984 season, in which he hit only .239 with 7 home runs and 
26 RBI over the first 67 games of the season, Smalley was traded again, 
this time to the White Sox for middle reliever Kevin Hickey and future 
Pittsburgh Pirates Cy Young and 155-game winner Doug Drabek.[5] Smalley 
was a member of Minnesota's 1987 World Championship team. In a 13-season 
career, Smalley posted a .257 batting average with 163 home runs and 694 
RBI in 1653 games played. He was inducted in the USC Athletic Hall of Fame 
in 2007.[7] Smalley now works for Fox Sports North as an analyst during 
Minnesota Twins games. In 2010, Smalley opened a restaurant near the Twins 
new home park, Target Field, called Smalley's '87 Club, however it closed 
in February 2012.[8][9] Smalley serves as the President on the Board of 
Directors for the nonprofit organization Pitch in for Baseball.[10] He 
was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013.[citation needed]
