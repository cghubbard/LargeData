Wilmington Park was a ballpark in Wilmington, Delaware that was located 
at the corner of 30th Street and Governor Printz Boulevard. It was home 
to the University of Delaware football team from 1940 to 1952 and the Wilmington 
Blue Rocks of the Class B Interstate League from 1940 to 1952. The Blue 
Rocks were an affiliate of the Philadelphia Athletics from 1940 to 1943 
and the Philadelphia Phillies from 1944 to 1952.[1] The University of Delaware 
Blue Hens football team played its home games at the park from 1940 until 
1952. Delaware had played at Frazer Field in Newark, Delaware before moving 
to Wilmington Park midway through the 1940 season. Delaware played its 
first game at Wilmington Park on November 9, 1940 and beat Pennsylvania 
Military College 14 to 7. While Delaware would continue to play occasional 
games at Frazer through the 1946 season, the team played its home games 
at Wilmington Park until midway through the 1952 season. In their last 
game at the ballpark, Delaware beat Pennsylvania Military College, 43 to 
20. Delaware finished the 1952 season at the brand-new Delaware Stadium 
which returned the team to Newark and the university campus.[2] During 
World War II, in January 1943, Major League Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw 
Mountain Landis ordered most Major League clubs to hold spring training 
north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers to comply with government requests 
to help the war effort by eliminating nonessential travel. The Philadelphia 
Athletics held spring training at Wilmington Park in 1943 and the Philadelphia 
Phillies at the park in 1944 and 1945.[3] In addition to World War II-spring 
training games at Wilmington Park, the Phillies played occasional exhibition 
games at the ballpark including games against the Blue Rocks. The Phillies 
and Athletics had long played pre-season exhibition games against each 
other in the Philadelphia City Series. The A's moved to Kansas City prior 
to the 1955 season but returned to the Philadelphia-area for a final match-up 
prior to 1955 Opening Day. They played the 1955 series at Wilmington where 
the A's beat the Phillies 9 to 6 on April 9, 1955 and 10 to 2 on April 
10, 1955.[4] The Philadelphia Stars Negro League baseball team hosted the 
Newark Eagles at the ballpark on Memorial Day in 1945.[5] 7,000 fans attended 
the Blue Rocks’ first game at the ballpark in 1940 and the club established 
a Class B attendance record in 1940 with 145,643 attending ballgames at 
Wilmington Park. The club topped that mark with 172,531 fans in 1944. The 
single game attendance record for the Blue Rocks was set in 1947 when 7,062 
fans saw Curt Simmons’ Wilmington debut. But attendance in 1950 dropped 
to 38,678, and despite a slight improvement to 43,135 in 1951, attendance 
continued to sink in 1952 which proved to be the last for the Blue Rocks 
at the ballpark.[6] Coordinates: 39°45′07″N 75°31′30″W﻿ / ﻿39.751981°N
