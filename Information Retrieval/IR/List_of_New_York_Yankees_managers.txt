The New York Yankees are a professional baseball team based in New York 
City, New York in the borough of The Bronx. The New York Yankees are members 
of the American League (AL) East Division in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
The Yankees have won the World Series 27 times, more than any other MLB 
team.[1][2] In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager, 
or more formally, the field manager. The duties of the team manager include 
team strategy and leadership on and off the field.[3][4] Since starting 
to play as the Baltimore Orioles (no relationship to the current Baltimore 
Orioles team[5]) in 1901, the team has employed 34 different managers.[6] 
The current Yankee manager is Joe Girardi, the current general manager 
is Brian Cashman and the current owners are Hal and Hank Steinbrenner, 
who are sons of the late George Steinbrenner, who first bought the Yankees 
in 1973.[7][8][9] The franchise's first manager was Hall of Famer John 
McGraw, who managed the team for one year and part of a second before becoming 
manager of the New York Giants.[10] In 1903, the team moved from Baltimore 
to New York, where it was initially known as the New York Highlanders.[11] 
Its first manager in New York was Clark Griffith, who managed the team 
from 1903 to 1908.[6] Miller Huggins was the next manager to manage the 
team for more than three seasons. Huggins took over the managerial duties 
in 1918 and led the Yankees to six American League championships and three 
World Series titles until his death in 1929. Huggins won 1,067 regular 
season games with the Yankees, which ranks fourth all-time among Yankee 
managers.[6][12] Several other managers spent long tenures with the Yankees. 
Joe McCarthy managed the Yankees from 1931 until midway through the 1946 
season. During his tenure, the Yankees won eight American League titles 
and won the World Series seven times. He won 1,460 regular season games 
with the Yankees and lost 867, both more than any other Yankee manager.[6][13] 
Casey Stengel managed the team from 1949 until 1960, winning 10 American 
League championships, 7 World Series titles, and 1,149 games, which ranks 
third among Yankee managers.[14] After Stengel retired, Ralph Houk managed 
the Yankees from 1961 through 1963, winning American League titles each 
season, and winning the World Series twice. He served a second term as 
Yankee manager from 1966 through 1973.[15] From 1974 until 1995, no Yankee 
managerial term lasted as long as three complete seasons.[6] Joe Torre 
managed the Yankees from 1996 through 2007 and the team made the playoffs 
each season. He also won six American League championships and four World 
Series titles. His 1,173 regular season wins are second all-time among 
Yankees managers. He also has the most playoff appearances, playoff wins 
and playoff losses of any Yankee manager. Torre was named American League 
Manager of the Year twice, in 1996 and 1998.[16] His predecessor, Buck 
Showalter, also was named Manager of the Year in 1994.[16] Torre left after 
the 2007 season and was replaced by Joe Girardi, who is the current manager 
of the New York Yankees.[6][17][18] Several managers have had multiple 
tenures with the Yankees. Billy Martin served five terms as Yankee manager.[19][20] 
Before his death in 1989, Martin was rumored to be in line for a sixth 
term if the Yankees started the 1990 season poorly.[21] Yogi Berra, Houk, 
Bob Lemon, Gene Michael, Lou Piniella and Dick Howser each served two terms 
as the Yankees' manager. Howser's first term lasted only a single game, 
as interim manager in 1978 between Martin's firing and Lemon's hiring.[22] 
Howser also managed a full season in 1980, leading the team to the playoffs, 
but was fired after the Yankees failed to advance to the World Series. 
Howser has the highest career winning percentage among all Yankee managers 
at .632.[6][22] List of Owners and Executives, including General Managers
