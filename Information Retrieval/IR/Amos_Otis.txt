As player As coach Amos Joseph Otis (born April 26, 1947) is a former center 
fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the New York Mets (1967, 
1969), Kansas City Royals (1970â€“1983) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1984). He 
batted and threw right-handed. Otis was initially drafted by the Boston 
Red Sox in 1965 as a shortstop. However, he spent time in the outfield, 
third base, and first base while playing in the minors. In November 1966, 
the Mets drafted him and he jumped all the way to Class AAA in 1967. He 
saw some time with the Mets late in the 1967 season, but he spent 1968 
at AAA again before making the major league roster in 1969.[1] When the 
Braves asked for Otis when trying to trade Joe Torre, the Mets refused 
and Torre wound up going to the St. Louis Cardinals instead. Otis immediately 
clashed with Mets manager Gil Hodges, who tried to make him a third baseman. 
After four games, Otis was sent back to the minors for a month. At the 
end of the season, Royals general manager Cedric Tallis sent third baseman 
Joe Foy to the Mets, in exchange for the young Otis.[1] Foy was bogged 
down by drug problems and was out of baseball by 1971. Meanwhile, the Royals 
immediately moved Otis to center field, and he became the starter for most 
of the 1970s. He made the American League all-star team each of his first 
four years with the team and he won three Gold Gloves. His speed worked 
well with the Royals' team philosophy of speed and defense.[1] On September 
7, 1971, he became the first player since 1927 to steal five bases in one 
game. He led the American League with 52 stolen bases that year. Otis scored 
the final run ever at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium in the fifth inning 
on October 4, 1972. He hit as many as 26 homers in a season, knocked in 
90 runs or more three times, twice led the AL in doubles and once in stolen 
bases with 52. He compiled a career total of 341 steals, while being caught 
stealing 93 times. Otis was a clutch performer, and he consistently produced 
for the Royals as the team became a perennial contender. On September 12, 
1977, Otis helped eight youths who were stranded after a Royals game had 
been rained out when flooding prevented the boys' parents picking them 
up. "If it was my kids", Otis said, "I would have wanted someone to do 
something for them, too."[2] Otis hit .478 with three home runs and seven 
runs batted in the 1980 World Series. He set a record for putouts in a 
game by an outfielder in Game 3, a contest in which he also homered. Later 
his offense began to decline, in part due to a hand injury. By the late 
1970s and early 1980s his fielding skills had diminished, and he lost his 
center field job to Willie Wilson near the end of his long run with the 
Royals. In 1983, he left the team before the season ended when told he 
was not in the Royals' future plans. He spent most of 1984 in the National 
League with the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was a quiet end to a successful 
career. In a 17-season career, Otis posted a .277 batting average, with 
193 home runs and 1,007 RBI in 1,998 games while stealing 341 bases. He 
worked for the San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies as a hitting instructor, 
and he has retired to Las Vegas. Otis still attends Royals reunions, and 
he dons a uniform to play in alumni games. In the early 1990s Otis admitted
