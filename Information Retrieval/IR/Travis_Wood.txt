Travis Alan Wood (born February 6, 1987), is an American professional baseball 
pitcher who is currently a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs. Born and raised in Little 
Rock, Arkansas, Wood attended Bryant High School where he starred in baseball 
and football. At the Babe Ruth World Series, Wood tossed a no-hitter, striking 
out 17, and at Bryant, Wood received All-State honors in each of his three 
seasons at the school. During his junior season, Wood also led Bryant to 
a state championship, and was Arkansas Gatorade Player of the Year in 2004 
and 2005.[1] Wood was selected 60th overall in the 2005 Major League Baseball 
Draft by the Cincinnati Reds out of Bryant High School. He chose not to 
attend college and went straight to professional baseball. Wood's first 
season as a professional was split between the Reds' Rookie Class teams, 
the Gulf Coast League Reds and the Billings Mustangs. He went a combined 
2–0 with a 1.29 ERA in 14 games, including 11 starts. Wood held batters 
to a .166 batting average, struck out 67, and pitched 47.2 innings, including 
17.2 scoreless over his first six appearances. Wood spent all of 2006 with 
the Class-A Dayton Dragons. He started 27 games and compiled a 10-5 record 
and a 3.66 ERA. Wood fanned 133 batters and held opponents to a .215 batting 
average. He was named Midwest League Pitcher of the Week for May 15–21, 
going 2–0 in 10.1 innings, striking out 13, and allowing one earned. Wood 
allowed only two runs in 26 innings pitched, while striking out 14 in his 
final four starts of the season. Wood was placed on the disabled list on 
July 10 and stayed there until September 14. In 12 starts for Class-A Advanced 
Sarasota, he went 3–2 with a 4.86 ERA. In 46.1 innings, Wood allowed 49 
hits and 27 walks, striking out 54, and opponents batted .268 off him. 
Wood began the 2008 season in Sarasota, and went 3–4 with a 2.70 ERA in 
nine starts. He held batters to a .222 average while with the team. He 
earned Pitcher of the Week of the Florida State League for the week of 
4/28-5/4, going 2–0 with a 1.38 ERA in 13 innings over the stretch, allowing

innings, Wood allowed 91 hits, 67 runs (63 earned), nine home runs, walked

affiliate. That time around, he improved drastically over his previous 
season in Double-A. Wood pitched 119 innings over 19 starts, going 9-3 
with a 1.21 ERA. Allowing just 16 earned runs on 78 hits and 37 walks, 
he also stuck out 103 batters and hitters batted only .189 off the lefty. 
Earning a call-up to Triple-A Louisville, Wood went 4–2 in 48.2 innings 
for the Bats. He allowed 43 hits over eight starts, walking 16 and striking 
out 32. He was added to the Reds' 40-man roster after the 2009 season to 
protect him from the Rule 5 Draft.[2] Wood was one of the last players 
cut from the Reds' roster in Spring Training, and was one of many competing 
for the Reds' fifth starter spot. In a crowded race featuring veterans 
Mike Lincoln and Justin Lehr, young arms Micah Owings and Matt Maloney, 
and prospects Sam LeCure, Aroldis Chapman, and Mike Leake, Wood came down 
to the last two but was cut in favor of Leake. He started the season in 
Louisville. On June 30, Wood was called up from Triple-A Louisville replacing 
Daniel Ray Herrera on the Reds active roster [3] Wood made his major league 
debut on July 1, 2010 versus the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, getting 
a no decision in an eventual 3–2 Reds victory.[citation needed] In his 
third career start, versus the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park 
on July 10, 2010, Wood flirted with a perfect game, pitching eight flawless 
innings before surrendering a double to Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz in 
the bottom of the ninth inning. Regardless, Wood actually could not have 
finished the perfect game in the ninth inning, because Phillies ace Roy 
Halladay, who himself had thrown a perfect game earlier in the 2010 season, 
also was pitching a shutout through nine innings. Wood exited after nine 
innings of one-hit ball, and the Reds would later lose the game 1–0 in 
11 innings, with Ruiz scoring the winning run. Wood hit his first career 
home run on September 4, 2010 off St. Louis Cardinals' Adam Wainwright. 
Wood finished the 2010 season 5-4 with a 3.51 ERA in 17 starts. Wood went 
6-6 with a 4.84 ERA in 22 games (18 starts) during the 2011 season. On 
December 21, 2011, Wood was traded to the Chicago Cubs, along with outfielder 
Dave Sappelt and a minor league second baseman Ronald Torreyes in exchange 
for left-handed reliever Sean Marshall.[4] Wood was called up to the major 
league club in early May 2012 after Chris Volstad was demoted to Iowa because 
of his 0–6 start. Wood went 6-13 with a 4.27 ERA in his first year as a 
Cub. On May 19, 2013, Wood became the first Cub since Mordecai Brown to 
start a season with 9 straight quality starts. On May 30, 2013, Wood hit 
his first career grand slam off of Jake Peavy in an 8-3 victory over the 
Chicago White Sox. On July 6, 2013, Wood was named to his first All-Star 
selection. In 2014, Travis Wood hit his 9th career homerun off of St. Louis 
Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright. Wood struggled in 2014, with a 5.03 
ERA in 31 starts. After struggling in the rotation to start the season, 
Wood was moved to the bullpen. Wood fared much better as a reliever, posting 
a 2.95 ERA and 4 saves in relief. Overall, he finished the season with 
a 3.84 ERA in 54 games (9 starts). Working out of the bullpen, Wood posted 
a 4-0 record with a 2.95 ERA in 77 appearances. In Game 2 of the NLDS, 
Wood hit a homerun off of Giants' reliever George Kontos. He became the 
2nd relief pitcher to homer in a postseason game, after Rosy Ryan. Wood 
has an expansive pitch repertoire, throwing six pitches with regularity. 
He has three fastballs — a four-seamer at 89–92 mph, a two-seamer at 88–91, 
and a cutter at 87–90. He also throws two breaking balls — a slider (80–83) 
and a curveball (71–75) – and, finally, a changeup at 78–81. Wood's pitches 
to left-handed hitters are most often four-seamers, cutters, and sliders, 
with an occasional curveball. To right-handers, he throws the four-seamer,
