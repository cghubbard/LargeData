David Christopher Justice (born April 14, 1966) is a former American outfielder 
and designated hitter in Major League Baseball who played for the Atlanta 
Braves (1989–1996), Cleveland Indians (1997–2000), New York Yankees (2000–2001), 
and Oakland Athletics (2002). David was born in Cincinnati, the son of 
Robert and Nettie Justice. Justice went to catholic schools; St. Joseph 
and St. Clement, respectively. He excelled both athletically and in the 
classroom, skipping the seventh and eighth grades. In high school, Justice 
was more known for his basketball abilities, becoming the all-time leading 
scorer in school history, averaging 26.5 points per game in his senior 
year. He graduated from Covington Latin School in Covington, Kentucky at 
age 16 in 1982. He then attended Thomas More College on a basketball scholarship, 
in Crestview Hills, Kentucky majoring in Criminal Justice, and minoring 
in Psychology. He is a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Justice 
made his major league debut in May 1989, playing for the last-place Atlanta 
Braves. The then 23-year-old right fielder earned the starting job after 
Braves fan favorite Dale Murphy was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Justice promptly went on an offensive tear during the second half of the 
1990 season, finishing with 28 home runs, which helped him claim the National 
League's Rookie of the Year Award. In 1991, the upstart Braves surged to 
the top of their division and Justice was leading the National League in 
runs batted in when he was sidelined by a nagging back injury in June. 
He finished with 87 runs batted in despite the injury and played in his 
first World Series. After seeing his production slide slightly in 1992, 
Justice enjoyed a solid 1993 season. He clubbed 40 home runs and 120 RBIs 
with 78 walks, finishing third in MVP voting behind Barry Bonds and Lenny 
Dykstra. Justice was batting .313 with a .427 on-base percentage and .531 
slugging average when the strike ended play in 1994. When baseball returned 
in 1995, Justice helped his Braves to the World Series against the Cleveland 
Indians. He drew attention (and boos) when he criticized Atlanta fans for 
the level of support they were providing the team.[1] Justice ended up 
a hero, however, when his crucial home run in Game 6 provided the only 
run in a 1–0 game that clinched the championship. In May 1996, a swing 
and miss in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates caused a season-ending 
shoulder separation. It would prove to be Justice's last at bat as a Brave, 
as he was traded during the final week of Spring training the following 
year. On ESPN, Justice stated, "I love the Braves, so when [Braves president] 
John Schuerholz looked me in my face and told me 'I'd bet my house and 
my family that you won't be traded' that's good enough confidence for me 
coming from a General Manager, and then out of nowhere, one week later 
I'm gone." Justice was later traded along with outfielder Marquis Grissom 
to the Cleveland Indians for outfielder Kenny Lofton and relief pitcher 
Alan Embree. Justice proved right away that he had many good years left. 
He hit .329 with a .418 OBP and .596 slugging average in 1997, with 33 
home runs, while making another World Series appearance. He posted solid 
numbers in 1998 and 1999 with the Cleveland Indians before his big year 
in 2000. That season, he hit a combined .286 with a .377 OBP and .584 slugging 
average, and slugged 41 home runs with 118 RBIs. On June 28, 2000, Yankees 
GM Brian Cashman finalized a trade with Indians GM John Hart, sending Jake 
Westbrook, Zach Day and Ricky Ledée to Cleveland for Justice. The Yankees, 
who were unable to lure Sammy Sosa or Juan Gonzalez from their respective 
teams, looked to Justice as a legitimate longball threat. In return, Justice 
caught fire down the stretch and won the 2000 AL Championship Series MVP 
Award en route to his second world championship. As a result of persistent 
groin injury, Justice saw his production slide considerably in 2001, and 
he was traded to the New York Mets on December 7, 2001 for 3B Robin Ventura.[2] 
Mets GM Steve Phillips then sent him to the Oakland Athletics on December 
14 for LHP Mark Guthrie and RHP Tyler Yates. He played a final season on 
an Oakland team which reached the playoffs in 2002 and was named the American 
League Player of the Week for the first week of the season. His addition 
to Oakland was referred to as an 'experiment' by A's assistant GM Paul 
DePodesta.[3] The experiment was to evaluate whether hitters retained their 
ability to get on base as they got older (kept their batter's eye). His 
.376 OBP and BB/K ratio of greater than 1:1 seemed to prove that correct. 
Justice finished his career as a .279 hitter, with a .378 OBP and .500 
slugging percentage, 305 home runs, 903 walks and 1017 RBI in 1610 games. 
From 1991 to his last season in 2002, Justice's teams made the postseason 
every year (with the exception of the strike-shortened 1994 season). Of 
those times, he made the World Series six times, winning twice. He is in 
the top ten in a number of career postseason categories, such as at-bats, 
games played, hits, and home runs.[4] On May 9, 1994, David Justice was 
listed in People Magazine's "50 Most Beautiful People" issue (Vol. 41 No. 
17). The article goes on to state: "'I check my face to make sure there's 
nothing sticking on it,' he says. 'But I don't make sure every hair's in 
place.' He needn't worry. He gets the most fan mail on the team and is 
mobbed when he makes personal appearances on behalf of charities."[5][6] 
In March 2007, it was announced that David Justice would be inducted into 
the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame. He was the first member of any of the 
Braves' fourteen consecutive division title teams (1991–2005, excluding 
the strike-shortened season in 1994) to be inducted in the Braves Hall 
of Fame. The induction took place on August 17, 2007. Numerous ex-Braves 
players and coaches were in attendance and tribute videos from Braves legend 
Hank Aaron and former owner Ted Turner were shown. Prior to that evening's 
game Justice was presented with a portrait by sports artist Bart Forbes 
during an on-field ceremony. Justice was eligible for the Major League 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008, however he received only one vote, preventing 
him from being named on future ballots. The timing of the vote may have 
adversely affected his candidacy, as it was held shortly after the release 
of the Mitchell Report. In an interview for the Mitchell Report, released 
December 13, 2007, Justice denied using performance-enhancing substances, 
but was willing to report the names of individuals he suspected, though 
he claimed to have no direct knowledge of any other player's steroid use. 
He also claims to have never been warned of the side effects of steroids 
or explicitly told steroids were a banned substance. The Mitchell Report 
states that in a later interview, former New York Mets clubhouse attendant 
Kirk Radomski claimed to have sold Justice human growth hormone when Justice 
was with the Yankees after the 2000 World Series. Justice has called the 
allegation "a bald-faced lie" and says that he has never met Radomski.[7] 
Justice has claimed that his only involvement with performance-enhancing 
drugs was a discussion about HGH in 2000 with Brian McNamee, then the New 
York Yankees' strength coach. Justice, who had shoulder problems, thought 
that HGH might aid in his recovery. Justice stated that after the discussion, 
he went to his locker and found a bag containing HGH and several injection 
needles; Justice claimed that he was unwilling to inject himself and never 
used any of it. Justice further stated in the interviews that all claims 
in the Mitchell Report concerning his alleged purchase and use of any performance 
drugs were false and encouraged all players whose names appear in the report, 
especially Roger Clemens, to publicly deny any claims made by the Mitchell 
Report if they are untrue. After his playing career, Justice served as 
a commentator for ESPN baseball telecasts for two years. He later joined 
the YES Network of the New York Yankees as a game and studio analyst, and 
also hosted the network's youth-oriented program Yankees on Deck. Prior 
to the 2008 season, the YES Network announced that Justice would not appear 
on air during that season, but would contribute articles to the network's 
website. Justice stated that this change was not in response to his inclusion 
in the Mitchell report, but was due to the destruction of his California 
home by a wildfire and the recent passing of his mother. Justice never 
returned to the network. Justice has also appeared on a 1992 episode of 
The Young and the Restless.[8] He was played by Stephen Bishop in Moneyball, 
the film adaptation of the best-selling Michael Lewis book Moneyball: The 
Art of Winning an Unfair Game about the Oakland Athletics baseball team 
and its general manager, Billy Beane.[9] Justice graduated from Covington 
Latin School in 1982. On December 31, 1992 Justice married film actress 
Halle Berry. The couple resided in Sandy Springs, Georgia. They separated 
on February 22, 1996[10] and divorced on June 24, 1997.[10] The marriage 
ended acrimoniously, with Berry seeking a restraining order against Justice.[11] 
His first son David, Jr. (b. 27 December 1999) is with ex-girlfriend, Nicole 
Foster. He married Rebecca Villalobos on 8 February 2001.[10] Villalobos 
is CEO of Exotic Spices Calendars.[12] They have two children together:
