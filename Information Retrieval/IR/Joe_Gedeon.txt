Elmer Joseph Gedeon (December 5, 1893 – May 19, 1941) was a second baseman 
in Major League Baseball. He played for the Washington Senators, New York 
Yankees, and St. Louis Browns. Born in Sacramento, California, Gedeon started 
his professional baseball career in 1912 in the Pacific Coast League. He 
won a job with the Senators the following season. Gedeon hit poorly in 
limited action and went back to the PCL in 1914. In 1915, he had the best 
offensive season of his career with the Salt Lake City Bees, batting .317 
and slugging .514 in 190 games.[1] For most of the next five seasons, Gedeon 
was a regular with the Yankees and Browns. He was an above-average defensive 
player, leading all American League second basemen in assists once (1918) 
and fielding percentage twice (1918 and 1919). In 1920, he led the AL in 
sacrifice hits with 48; this total is still a Browns/Orioles single season 
record. Unfortunately, Gedeon – who was a friend of Black Sox conspirator 
Swede Risberg – was present during a meeting with gamblers, as they were 
discussing the plot to fix the 1919 World Series. He was later called as 
a witness in the trial. On November 3, 1921, Gedeon was banned for life 
from organized baseball for "having guilty knowledge" of the Black Sox 
Scandal.[2] He died in San Francisco, California at the age of 47, having 
suffered from cirrhosis of the liver. The official cause of death was bronchial 
pneumonia. His nephew, Elmer Gedeon, was one of only two Major League Baseball
