Frank Andrew McCormick (June 9, 1911 – November 21, 1982) was an American 
baseball first baseman who played fifteen seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Nicknamed "Buck" in honor of Frank Buck,[1] he played for the Cincinnati 
Reds, Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Braves from 1934 to 1948. He batted 
and threw right-handed and was listed at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and 205 
pounds (93 kg). McCormick signed with the Cincinnati Reds as an amateur 
free agent in 1934 and played for their minor league affiliate in Beckley 
until September of that same year, when the Reds promoted him to the major 
leagues. After spending twelve seasons with the organization, McCormick 
was sold to the Philadelphia Phillies, where he spent the next two seasons. 
In the middle of the 1947 season, he was released and subsequently joined 
the Boston Braves, with whom he played his last game on October 3, 1948. 
He is most famous for winning the National League Most Valuable Player 
Award in 1940. McCormick was born on June 9, 1911 in New York City.[2] 
His father, Andrew McCormick, was a railroad worker; his mother was Ann. 
As a youngster, he played sandlot ball and participated in baseball at 
his high school and church's leagues, playing in the oufield. He made the 
decision to play professional baseball at seventeen and tried out for several 
major league teams. After he was rejected by the Philadelphia Athletics, 
Washington Senators and New York Giants, he took a $50 loan from his uncle 
in order to go to the Cincinnati Reds' tryout held in Beckley, West Virginia.[1] 
McCormick's manager at the sandlot team encouraged him to switch positions 
to first base, citing how there was less competition for the spot compared 
to the outfield. His performance at the tryout left a lasting impression 
on former major league player and renowned scout Bobby Wallace, who promptly 
signed the 23-year-old.[1] At the conclusion of his 1938 rookie season, 
McCormick married his wife Vera (née Preedy) on October 8. Together, they 
had two daughters, Judith and Nancy. The McCormicks' children are still 
alive today, along with their grandchildren (Adam Thorson, Samantha Harris, 
and Judson and Jason Venier) and his great grandchildren (Kai and Hunter 
Harris and Olivia, Lily, and Ben Venier). After his Major League career 
ended, McCormick went on to manage the Quebec Braves,[3] Lima Phillies 
and Bradford Phillies, spending one season at each minor league baseball 
affiliate from 1949 to 1951.[4] He proceeded to coach his former team—the 
now-renamed Cincinnati Redlegs—in 1955, replacing Dick Bartell.[5] After 
his coaching tenure finished, he continued his affiliation with the Reds 
as a scout, as well as a broadcaster, announcer and analyst on WLWT-TV 
from 1958 to 1968,[6] before moving back to his hometown and working as 
the director of ticket sales for the New York Yankees until his death. 
McCormick died of cancer on November 21, 1982 in Manhasset, New York at 
the age of 71.[1][7] He was interred at the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in 
Westbury, New York.[2] McCormick began his professional baseball career 
for the Beckley Black Knights, a minor league baseball team that were members 
of the Middle Atlantic League. In 120 games played and 487 at bats that 
season, he posted a batting average of .347 and garnered 169 hits.[4] His 
stellar performance that year earned him a promotion to the major leagues.[1] 
After he was exiled back to the minors, he split the 1935 season between 
five teams—the Dayton Ducks, Decatur Commodores, Nashville Volunteers, 
Fort Worth Cats and Toronto Maple Leafs—and batted .277 and made 121 hits 
throughout the entire season.[4] In 1936, he moved to the Durham Bulls, 
a minor league baseball team that competed in the Piedmont League. He began 
the season in a disappointing fashion before his manager, Johnny Gooch, 
advised him to modify his batting grip. The change helped McCormick tremendously, 
as he led the league with a .381 batting average that season[1] and finished 
with 211 hits, 49 doubles and 15 home runs. His final stint in the minor 
leagues saw him bat .322 with the Syracuse Chiefs in 1937.[4] McCormick 
made his major league debut for the Reds on September 11, 1934, at the 
age of 23,[2] entering the game as a pinch-hitter for pitcher Ray Kolp 
in a 5–2 loss against the Brooklyn Dodgers.[8] He played just 12 games 
with the Reds and though he batted .313 in 16 at-bats, he was demoted to 
the minor leagues, where he was consigned for the next two seasons.[2] 
He was briefly brought back up to the majors in 1937, but after the Reds 
were unable to fit him into one position, he was sent back down and remained 
there until September 19. In his first day back with the team, he amassed 
seven hits in a doubleheader[1] and finished the season with a .325 batting 
average in 83 at-bats.[2] McCormick became the Reds' full-time first baseman 
from 1938 onwards,[1] replacing Buck Jordan.[9] That year, he had 106 runs 
batted in (RBI), finished third in the National League in batting average 
(.327)[2] and led the majors in hits with 209.[10] In recognition of his 
brilliant performance in his first full year in the major leagues, McCormick 
was named the unofficial "Rookie of the Year" by the Associated Press.[9] 
The 1939 season saw another strong showing from McCormick both offensively 
and defensively. He led the National League in hits (209), drove in 128 
RBIs to become the league's RBI champion[11] and finished first in fielding 
percentage at first base (.996).[12] His impressive performance during 
the latter half of the season was recognized as being a key factor in the 
Reds' drive to win the pennant.[13] The Reds advanced to the 1939 World 
Series, where they lost to the New York Yankees in a four-game sweep.[14] 
In spite of team's performance, he was still able to maintain a .400 batting 
average throughout the series. His contributions to the team that year 
led to him being accepted into the "Jungle Club" of Reds' infielders, who 
gave him the nickname "Wildcat".[1] In a 13-season career, McCormick posted 
a .299 batting average with 1,711 hits, 128 home runs and 951 run batted 
in in 1,534 games played.[2] He was the Most Valuable Player in the National 
League in 1940. That season, he led the league in hits (191) and doubles 
(44) as the Reds stormed to their second consecutive National League championship 
and the 1940 World Series title. McCormick was selected to the NL All-Star 
team for nine straight seasons (1938–1946, although there was no game played 
in 1945). McCormick also led his league in hits two other times (1938–1939, 
with 209 each season) and in RBI in 1939 (with 128). He topped NL basemen 
in fielding percentage four times. In three World Series (1939–1940 with 
the Reds and 1948 with the Braves), he batted .271 with 13 hits in 14 games 
played.[1][2] He is one of only three NL players with three consecutive 
hits titles. The others are Ginger Beaumont (1902–04) and Rogers Hornsby 
(1920–22). McCormick set an MLB first basemen record with 131 straight 
errorless games (1945–46). He is a member of the Cincinnati Reds Hall of
