Multipurpose stadiums are a type of stadium designed to be easily used 
by multiple types of events. While any stadium could potentially host more 
than one type of sport or event, this concept usually refers to a specific 
design philosophy that stresses multifunctionality over specificity. It 
is used most commonly in Canada and the United States, where the two most 
popular outdoor team sports – football and baseball – require radically 
different facilities. Football uses a rectangular field (Canadian football 
fields are larger than American ones), while baseball is played on a diamond 
and large outfield. This requires a particular design to accommodate both, 
usually an oval. While building stadiums in this way means that sports 
teams and governments can share costs, it also imposes some challenges. 
In North America, multipurpose stadiums were built primarily during the 
1960s and 1970s as shared home stadiums for Major League Baseball and National 
Football League or Canadian Football League teams. Some stadiums were renovated 
to allow multipurpose configurations during the 1980s. This type of stadium 
is associated with an era of suburbanization, in which many sports teams 
followed their fans out of large cities into areas with cheaper, plentiful 
land. They were usually built near highways and had large parking lots, 
but were rarely connected to public transit. As multipurpose stadiums were 
rarely ideal for both sports usually housed in them, they had fallen out 
of favor by the 1990s. With the completion of the Truman Sports Complex 
in Kansas City in 1973, a model for purpose-built stadiums was laid down. 
Since Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened in 1992, most major league sports 
stadiums have been built specifically for one sport. Outside North America, 
the term is rarely used, since soccer is the only major outdoor team sport 
in many countries; in some countries, soccer and rugby can easily co-exist, 
with Australia and South Africa being notable examples. In other countries, 
such as England, teams rarely share facilities. In Australia, many sports 
grounds are suited to both Australian rules football and cricket, as Australian 
rules was originally conceived for play on cricket fields. Soccer stadiums 
have historically served as track and field arenas, as well, and some (like 
the Olympiastadion in Berlin) still do, whereas a newer generation frequently 
has no running track to allow the fans closer to the field. As of 2016, 
the Oakland Coliseum is the last multipurpose stadium to serve as a full-time 
home to both an MLB team and an NFL team. Several stadiums hosted multiple 
sports teams prior to the advent of multipurpose stadiums. In New York 
City, the Polo Grounds hosted football teams early on, and although the 
stadium was ostensibly designed for polo, its rectangular nature lent itself 
well to football, and was also – with somewhat less of a fit – used for 
baseball. The original configuration of Yankee Stadium was specifically 
designed to accommodate football, as well as track and field (it was Yankee 
Stadium that popularized the warning track, originally designed as a running 
track, around baseball fields), in addition to its primary use for baseball. 
Wrigley Field, while originally built for baseball, also hosted the Chicago 
Bears, just as Comiskey Park hosted the Chicago Cardinals and Tiger Stadium 
hosted the Detroit Lions. Later venues such as Cleveland Stadium and Baltimore 
Memorial Stadium were built to accommodate both baseball and football. 
In the 1960s, multipurpose stadiums began replacing their baseball-only 
and football-only predecessors, now known as "classics" or "jewel box" 
parks. The advantage to a multipurpose stadium is that a singular infrastructure 
and piece of real estate can support both teams in terms of transportation 
and playing area, and money (often public money) that would have been spent 
to support infrastructure for two stadiums could be spent elsewhere. Also 
playing into the advent of the multipurpose stadium was Americans' growing 
use of automobiles as a form of transportation, therefore the need for 
professional sports stadiums to accommodate parking. As most cities lacked 
the space to construct the stadiums with necessary parking lots near their 
city centers, most multipurpose stadiums were built in suburbs, away from 
the city centers, but near freeways or highways. Subsets of the multipurpose 
stadiums were the so-called "cookie-cutter stadiums" or "concrete donuts" 
which were all very similar in design. They featured a completely circular 
or nearly circular design, and accommodated both baseball and football 
by rotating sections of the box seat areas to fit the respective playing 
fields. These fields often used artificial turf, as it could withstand 
the reconfiguration process more easily or be removed for nonsporting events, 
plus it could be used in domes, which many of these stadiums were. The 
first of these stadiums was Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. It was 
followed during the 1960s and 1970s by Shea Stadium, Atlanta–Fulton County 
Stadium, Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, the Astrodome, Jack Murphy Stadium, 
Riverfront Stadium, Busch Memorial Stadium, Three Rivers Stadium, Veterans 
Stadium, and the Kingdome. As of 2016, seven of these 11 stadiums have 
been demolished. Only Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, the Oakland Coliseum, 
and Jack Murphy Stadium (now known as Qualcomm Stadium) remain in use; 
the Astrodome, while still standing, has been disused since 2008 because 
of fire code violations; Shea Stadium, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, Riverfront 
Stadium, Busch Memorial Stadium, Three Rivers Stadium, Veterans Stadium, 
and the Kingdome were all demolished between 1997 and 2009. The Washington 
Nationals and San Diego Padres baseball teams have since moved out of Robert 
F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium and Qualcomm Stadium, respectively, although 
the latter stadium is still home to the San Diego Chargers (NFL) and San 
Diego State Aztecs (college) football teams. The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome 
was unusual in that it was one of the few air-supported dome stadiums that 
was multipurpose in practice, being convertible between football and baseball. 
Home of the Minnesota Vikings through the 2013 season, it was also home 
to the Minnesota Twins until 2009 and the Minnesota Golden Gophers football 
team (NCAA) until 2008.[1] The Carrier Dome was another such air-supported, 
multipurpose stadium, although it was built to accommodate outdoor sports 
such as football and indoor sports such as basketball. The Carrier Dome 
remains in use. The Metrodome has been demolished, with U.S. Bank Stadium, 
built mainly for professional football but able to convert to a college 
baseball stadium,[2] now sitting on its former site. Most other inflatable 
domes, such as the Hoosier Dome and Pontiac Silverdome, were football-only 
stadiums. During the height of the multipurpose stadium construction era 
of the 1960s and 1970s, four baseball-only stadiums were constructed: Candlestick 
Park (1960), Dodger Stadium (1962), Anaheim Stadium (1966; now Angel Stadium 
of Anaheim), and Royals Stadium (1973; now Kauffman Stadium). Anaheim Stadium 
was, however, renovated into a multipurpose stadium in 1980 to accommodate 
the Los Angeles Rams' move from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and 
renovated back into a baseball-only facility in 1997, three years after 
the Rams' departure for St. Louis. Similarly, Candlestick Park was renovated 
into a multipurpose stadium in 1970 to accommodate the San Francisco 49ers' 
move from Kezar Stadium and converted to football only after the San Francisco 
Giants moved to their new ballpark in 2000. Another baseball stadium, Denver's 
Mile High Stadium, was also renovated with additional seating, including 
a 4,500-ton, three-tier movable grandstand to accommodate both baseball 
and football configurations. Mile High Stadium was home to the AFL/NFL 
Denver Broncos and the MLB Colorado Rockies franchises. The Atlanta Committee 
for the Olympic Games (ACOG) built Centennial Olympic Stadium in a way 
that it could be converted to a new baseball stadium, and ACOG paid for 
the conversion.[3] This was considered a good agreement for both the Olympic 
Committee and the Braves, because no use existed for a permanent 85,000-seat 
track and field stadium in downtown Atlanta], as the 71,000-seat Georgia 
Dome had been completed four years earlier by the state of Georgia. Furthermore, 
the Braves had already been exploring opportunities for a new venue to 
replace Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium.[4] The southwest corner of the Olympic 
Stadium was built to accommodate the future baseball infield and seating. 
This is easily seen in aerial views and diagrams of the stadium in its 
Olympic configuration, where the seats are not placed next to the oval 
running track. The southwest part of the stadium also had four tiers of 
seats, luxury boxes, a facade facing the street, and a roof, whereas the 
northern half of the stadium used a simpler two-tiered seating configuration. 
During reconstruction, the athletics track was removed, and the north half 
of the stadium was demolished, reducing the capacity to 49,000 when it 
reopened as Turner Field. Because of the need to fit a track within the 
stadium in its earlier incarnation, the field of play, particularly foul 
territory, while not large by historical standards, is still larger than 
most new MLB stadiums. In Canada, several large multisport stadiums were 
built during this style's heyday. However, unlike in the United States, 
an NFL team has never been based primarily in Canada (though the Buffalo 
Bills played some home games in Toronto between 2008 and 2013) and only 
two MLB teams have been based there, so teams from these leagues have not 
been the major impetus behind stadium construction (with the notable exception 
of Toronto). Instead, stadiums were built primarily for Canadian Football 
League teams and to host multiple-sport events, such as the Olympics, Commonwealth 
Games, and Pan-American Games. Three of Canada's largest stadiums from 
this era and type feature domed or retractable roofs, namely BC Place in 
Vancouver, SkyDome/Rogers Centre in Toronto, and Olympic Stadium in Montreal. 
BC Place is capable of hosting baseball, but has been primarily a football 
venue. Rogers Centre was built to accommodate baseball (MLB's Toronto Blue 
Jays play there), but was a football venue until the CFL's Toronto Argonauts 
moved to BMO Field after the 2015 CFL season. Montreal's Olympic Stadium 
was built primarily for a multisport event (the 1976 Summer Olympics, during 
which it hosted the track and field events and the soccer final) rather 
than for professional team sports, but it later became the home of the 
Montreal Alouettes football team and the Montreal Expos baseball team, 
and began serving as an alternate home to the Montreal Impact when that 
team entered Major League Soccer in 2012. Similarly, the open-air Commonwealth 
Stadium in Edmonton was constructed for the 1978 Commonwealth Games, but 
has also become home of the Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL. It has also hosted 
many soccer events, as well as the 2003 Heritage Classic, the first major 
outdoor ice hockey event in Canada. Tim Hortons Field, which opened in 
2014, was built both as a venue for the 2015 Pan American Games and as 
the new home of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats football team; its predecessor, 
Ivor Wynne Stadium, was originally built for the first Commonwealth Games. 
Other Canadian cities never expressed interest in building a venue for 
Major League Baseball or the Summer Olympics, and felt no need to replace 
their smaller, open-air stadiums used mostly for Canadian football. For 
example, Calgary's open-air McMahon Stadium dates from 1960 and has been 
used only for Canadian football, the 1988 Winter Olympics, and an outdoor 
ice hockey event (the 2011 Heritage Classic). Similar situations hold in 
Ottawa, Winnipeg, Hamilton, and Regina. No large stadiums of any kind are 
in cities such as Quebec City, London, or Saskatoon, or in Atlantic Canada; 
in those places (with the exception of Saskatoon), smaller stadiums (less 
than 13,000 seats) exist that can be augmented with temporary seating to 
bring their capacities close to that of the smaller CFL stadiums. The idea 
of a sharp difference between a multipurpose stadium and a single-sport 
stadium is less important outside of North America, since in most countries 
stadiums that are constructed with soccer in mind are easily able to accommodate 
rugby, track and field, or other sports with a similar-sized playing field. 
For example, any large stadium in most of Latin America, part of Asia, 
most of Africa, or continental Europe is likely to be used mostly for soccer. 
The majority of the largest stadia in the world were built for either association 
football or American football. The regions where other outdoor sports can 
draw numbers comparable to soccer or American football are limited. They 
include: baseball in Japan and the Spanish Caribbean; cricket in England, 
Australia, the Anglophone Caribbean, and the Indian subcontinent; rugby 
(union or league) in Wales, England, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand, 
Fiji, and parts of Australia and France; Australian rules football in Australia; 
bandy in Russia and Scandinavia; and Gaelic games in Ireland. However, 
even in these areas, the amount of compromise needed to accommodate multiple 
sports varies considerably. Most outdoor team sports have a rectangular 
playing field, but cricket and Australian-rules fields are rounded, while 
baseball is played in a diamond. This makes them much harder to accommodate 
within a rectangular-shaped stadium. Likewise, accommodating athletics 
(track and field), such as for a Summer Olympics, means constructing a 
rounded 400-m track around the infield. This often means the sports simply 
find it easier to play in separate stadiums. In the case of Ireland, grounds 
built for Gaelic games are physically capable of hosting soccer and the 
rugby codes without changing the seating configuration. Because the Gaelic 
games' pitch is rectangular and also longer and wider than that of soccer 
or either rugby code, the only changes required are the physical goals 
and field markings. However, opposition to those sports within large parts 
of the Gaelic games community, most notably manifested in GAA Rule 42, 
means that soccer and rugby clubs have generally had to play in separate 
grounds. True multisport facilities, where teams from a variety of sports 
use the same stadium as their home ground, exist outside North America 
in a few cases, most of those smaller stadiums. A handful are notable for 
having 60,000 seats or more. Melbourne Cricket Ground hosts cricket, Australian 
rules football, and soccer. Before its currently ongoing conversion into 
a dedicated rectangular stadium, ANZ Stadium hosted cricket and Australian 
rules, as well as both rugby codes and soccer. Wembley Stadium in London, 
Stade de France near Paris, and Millennium Stadium in Cardiff are not the 
permanent homes to any club teams, but are used primarily for international 
competitions and major tournament finals, mostly for soccer and rugby. 
In South Africa, Soccer City and Ellis Park Stadium have hosted rugby union 
and soccer, while Moses Mabhida Stadium has hosted soccer and cricket. 
Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi in India hosts cricket and soccer. Eden 
Park in New Zealand hosts rugby union and cricket. Westpac Stadium in Wellington, 
New Zealand, has hosted both rugby codes, cricket, soccer, and Australian 
rules. The architects Arup cited history that a rarely used athletics track 
does not work with football, such as the Stadio delle Alpi and the Munich 
Olympic Stadium, with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving to new stadiums 
less than 40 years after inheriting them.[5] The delle Alpi's design was 
criticized, as it left spectators exposed to the elements, and the long 
distance between the stands and the pitch resulted in poor visibility. 
This was because the athletics track, which was seldom used, was constructed 
around the outside of the pitch, while views from the lower tier were also 
restricted due to the positioning of advertising boardings.[6] These factors 
contributed to low attendances; only 237 spectators showed up for the Coppa 
Italia home match against Sampdoria in the 2001–02 season, while in the 
2005–06 season, the average attendance was 35,880.[7][8] Manchester City 
Council wished to avoid creating a white elephant, so to give the stadium 
long-term financial viability, extensive work was carried out to convert 
the City of Manchester Stadium from a field and track arena to a football 
stadium. The old Estádio da Luz was demolished so that the football-specific 
replacement could be built on the site as part of Portugal's bid to host 
Euro 2004. German stadiums such as the AWD-Arena, Commerzbank-Arena, Mercedes-Benz 
Arena, RheinEnergieStadion, Volksparkstadion, and Zentralstadion also underwent 
reconstruction/renovation by removing the running track to become football-only 
venues; several of these projects were done in preparation for the 2006 
FIFA World Cup. A different take on the multipurpose concept can be seen 
in the Saitama Super Arena in Japan and Arena 92, a stadium set to open 
in 2017 near La Défense in the inner suburbs of Paris. Both venues are 
similar to the Carrier Dome in that they are fully enclosed stadiums (though 
with fixed roofs instead of the Carrier Dome's air-supported roof) that 
can accommodate field and indoor court sports. However, they differ from 
the Carrier Dome in the specific way they accommodate court sports. Both 
the Super Arena (used mainly for basketball, volleyball, mixed martial 
arts, and professional wrestling events) and Arena 92 (the future home 
of rugby union's Racing 92) feature movable seating blocks that allow each 
facility to serve as an appropriately sized venue for either field or court 
sports. Most multipurpose stadiums that existed in North America overlaid 
one sideline of the football field along one of the baseball foul lines, 
with one corner of the football field being located where home plate would 
be. Because the length of a regulation American football field is 360 feet, 
longer than the roughly 330-foot average for foul lines in Major League 
Baseball, this requires an unusually long distance from the home plate 
to the fence along the foul line on which the football field is constructed, 
part of the football field to be constructed in foul territory (and the 
size of said territory to be increased accordingly), or a temporary wall. 
The Oakland Coliseum uses a configuration such that its football sideline 
runs along a line drawn from first base to third base (the former Atlanta–Fulton 
County Stadium also used this configuration). This was done presumably 
to make the same coveted seats behind home plate at a baseball game also 
coveted 50-yard line seats at a football game, and also so the stadium 
would need only one press box. Different stadiums have different angles 
between the left- and right-field seats. In stadiums that were primarily 
football stadiums converted to baseball stadiums, the stands were at nearly 
right angles. This allowed the football field to be squared within the 
bleachers, but left the baseball configuration with many undesirable views 
farther away from home plate or facing away from the diamond, such as at 
the Kingdome, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, and the venue now known 
as Hard Rock Stadium. For stadiums such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, 
where the Los Angeles Dodgers played their home games from 1958 through 
1961 while awaiting completion of Dodger Stadium, this also had the undesirable 
effect of having unusually short foul lines, making it easier to hit so-called 
"Chinese home runs". Baseball stadiums that converted to football stadiums 
had more of an obtuse angle between the stands. This made the football 
viewing farther away, and in some cases partially obscured as in Candlestick 
Park. In the case of Qualcomm Stadium, it was constructed with half of 
the field-level seating permanent (built of concrete, in the southern quadrant 
of the stadium), and the other half portable (modular construction using 
aluminum or steel framing). When the stadium was configured for baseball, 
the portable sections would be placed in the western quadrant of the stadium 
and serve as the third-base half of the infield. In the football configuration, 
these are placed in the northern quadrant of the stadium (covering what 
is used as left field in the baseball configuration) to allow for the football 
field to be laid out east-west. This had the advantage of improving sightlines 
for both sports while keeping the baseball dimensions roughly symmetrical. 
While multipurpose stadiums were intended to easily accommodate both American 
football and baseball (and in some cases, soccer), the fundamentally different 
sizes and shapes of the playing fields made them inadequate for either 
sport. When used for baseball, the lower-level boxes were usually set back 
much further from the field than comparable seats in baseball-only parks 
because they swiveled into position for football and soccer. In the case 
of stadiums that hosted both baseball and Canadian football, the lower 
boxes were set even further back than their American counterparts, because 
Canadian football fields are 30 yards longer and considerably wider than 
their American counterparts. Likewise, attempts to build stadiums without 
support columns to obstruct spectators' views, as was the case with sport-specific 
"jewel box" stadiums, resulted in upper decks being placed very high above 
the field—as far as 600 feet away in some cases. Several teams closed off 
sections of the upper level and only sold them during the playoffs, as 
they were too far away to be of any use during the regular season. For 
football, the seats nearest the field were set farther back than at football-only 
stadiums to accommodate the larger baseball field. In some cases, the seats 
closest to the field, normally prime seats for baseball, were almost at 
field level for football. In general, spectator sightlines were not optimized 
for either sport, i.e., seats were angled towards the center of the field 
rather than towards the logical center of the game action (home plate for 
baseball and the 50-yard line for football). The large capacities of multipurpose 
stadiums were usually more than adequate for football. However, baseball 
crowds tend to be much smaller than football crowds, resulting in baseball 
games at these stadiums being swallowed up in the environment. This was 
especially true if a baseball team were not doing particularly well either 
on the field or in the box office. This was another reason some baseball 
teams closed sections of the upper level during the regular season. Many 
multipurpose stadiums also had artificial turf playing surfaces, to ease 
the transition from baseball field to football field and vice versa. In 
many cases, the turf was nothing more than carpet on top of concrete with 
little padding material, which caused frequent injuries to players. During 
the first month of the football season, the playing field included the 
infield soil that is harder than the grass and is also a significant injury 
risk. In the baseball configuration, most had symmetrical field dimensions. 
This detracted from the unique, individual identity enjoyed by the sport-specific 
"jewel box" stadiums with odd or asymmetrical field dimensions, and further 
supported the "cookie cutter stadium" nickname. Fans also criticized the 
large parking lots surrounding the stadiums, as well as their concrete 
or painted concrete façades as uninviting. The suburban locales of many 
multipurpose stadiums (as well as other sport-specific stadiums also built 
there) were also a focal point for criticism, as they were often no longer 
in the municipality the teams represent, especially if the stadium were 
built across a state border. One of the most famous examples is Giants 
Stadium, which primarily hosted football, but was also a soccer stadium 
at times; its primary tenants were nominally based in New York City, but 
Giants Stadium was neither in New York City or even New York, instead being 
built in the Meadowlands of East Rutherford, New Jersey. Soccer was perceived 
as an especially bad fit for this type of stadium because, in the United 
States, the sport does not draw as many fans to games as American football 
or baseball (with the partial exception of Seattle), resulting in the stadium 
being filled to only a fraction of its capacity. This led to the soccer-specific 
stadium movement. Scheduling was also a big issue, since the MLB postseason 
overlaps with the NFL regular season. If a baseball team advances in the 
postseason to the point where it is scheduled to play a postseason game 
on the same day the football team plays a home game, adjustments had to 
be made, such as having the game moved to Monday night or – if a division 
opponent were scheduled – have the game sites switched, putting the upcoming 
meeting on the road and playing the home game during the latter meeting. 
An example of the former happening was in 1997 when the Florida Marlins 
played game 7 of the World Series at home on Sunday, Oct. 26, which moved 
the Miami Dolphins game against the Chicago Bears to Monday night.[9] An 
example of the latter happening was in 1989 when the San Francisco Giants 
hosted a postseason game on Sunday, Oct. 8, against the Chicago Cubs, the 
same day the San Francisco 49ers were scheduled to host their division 
rival New Orleans Saints. The Oct. 8 game was moved to New Orleans and 
the Nov. 6 game was moved to San Francisco.[10] In Australia, most major 
stadiums which can hold over 50,000, such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground 
and Adelaide Oval, are circular or oval-shaped venues which – while suitable 
for cricket and Australian rules football – pose the same sight-line problems 
for soccer, rugby league, and rugby union as an athletics venue would. 
Playing sports with rectangle-shaped pitches on larger ovals often means 
fans can be as much as 30 m or more from the sidelines. Both Stadium Australia 
in Sydney and the Docklands Stadium in Melbourne have retractable seating 
to be able to change from an oval to rectangle shape and bring fans closer 
to the action if needed. Lang Park in Brisbane is currently (as of 2016) 
the only purpose-built rectangle stadium in Australia (with fixed seating) 
with a capacity exceeding 50,000. Stadium Australia is currently undergoing 
a major renovation which will convert the facility to rectangular-only 
(though still with movable seating); once the project is complete (expected 
in 2017), it will have a capacity of 75,000. The first real departure from 
the multipurpose stadium design occurred in 1972, when the Jackson County 
Sports Authority in Kansas City, Missouri, opened the Truman Sports Complex, 
which houses Kauffman Stadium (named Royals Stadium at the time of opening) 
and Arrowhead Stadium. The Truman Sports Complex was the first example 
of multiple stadiums being built for specific sports at the same time. 
The designers, Kivett and Myers, were then absorbed by Kansas City architecture 
firm Hellmuth, Obata, and Kassabaum to become HOK Sport + Venue + Event 
(now the independent firm Populous), which went on to design many professional 
sports venues in the United States. Though hailed as revolutionary at the 
time, the Truman Sports Complex model of stadium design was widely ignored 
for the next 20 years, though the influence of both Arrowhead and Kauffman 
Stadiums were easily seen in venues such as Giants Stadium. The true end 
of the multipurpose era began in 1987, when Buffalo's Pilot Field, a stadium 
built for the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball team and a potential 
MLB expansion franchise, opened. Pilot Field replaced the long-obsolete 
War Memorial Stadium, which had been designed mainly for football, but 
had been (awkwardly) fit for baseball after the city's baseball park, Offermann 
Stadium, was torn down in 1960. During the 1990s and 2000s, most of the 
multipurpose stadiums used for MLB in the United States were replaced (most 
of those replaced have been demolished) by "retro- style" ballparks. These 
parks were built in two varieties: "retro-classic" parks, which combine 
the interior and exterior design of the "classic" ballparks with the amenities 
of newer facilities; and "retro-modern" parks, which have modern amenities 
and "retro" interiors, but have modern exterior designs. The first "retro-classic" 
park in MLB was Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, which opened 
in 1992 and was based mostly on the Pilot Field design. (The second Comiskey 
Park, now Guaranteed Rate Field, had opened a year earlier in Chicago, 
but it was very modernist in its design and had little in common with the 
later retro-classic parks. However, due to extensive renovations over the 
years, Comiskey Park now enjoys many of the same amenities.) The "retro-modern" 
park made its first appearance in 1994 with the opening of Jacobs Field, 
now known as Progressive Field, in Cleveland. Many football teams that 
shared a stadium with a baseball team had their stadiums converted into 
football-only facilities shortly after the baseball tenant left (e.g., 
Qualcomm Stadium), while other football teams followed their baseball counterparts 
and had new football-only stadiums constructed. The widespread adoption 
of FieldTurf and similar modern artificial turfs beginning in the early 
2000s also has had a role in the decline of the multipurpose stadium. While 
first-generation, short-pile turfs such as AstroTurf lent themselves well 
to multiple sports (one could have a turf for football, roll it up and 
replace it with one for baseball, soccer, or lacrosse), this was not the 
case with FieldTurf and its competitors. Modern artificial turf requires 
a more permanent installation, including sand and rubber base and/or infill 
that is not easily removed, thus does not lend itself well to multipurpose 
stadiums. Because of such turfs' superiority in other features compared 
to the earlier turfs, it has been seen as easier to build new stadiums 
for each sport rather than attempt to share an inflexible turf installation 
among multiple sports. The Miami Marlins, which changed their name from 
the original Florida Marlins in November 2011, moved to Marlins Park, a 
new retractable-roof stadium in Miami, in 2012. Sun Life Stadium (now Hard 
Rock Stadium) was then renovated to eliminate its baseball functionality, 
making it a football-only stadium.[11] With the Marlins' relocation, the 
Oakland Athletics are the only team left in the U.S. still sharing a stadium 
with an NFL team (the Oakland Raiders), the Oakland Coliseum. The Athletics 
and Raiders are both seeking new places to play; the Athletics recently 
explored plans to build Cisco Field. The Raiders have no concrete plans 
to move, but have suggested a move back to Los Angeles, where they played 
from 1982 to 1994. Also, suggestions have been made for the Raiders to 
share the new Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara with the 49ers. The Raiders' 
lease on the Coliseum expired after the 2013 season, and the team is currently 
only in the stadium because of emergency lease extensions; the Raiders 
have also been aggressively exploring a move to the Alamodome in San Antonio, 
and should the Raiders decide to relocate to any of those venues, shared 
stadiums will no longer be used by both the NFL and MLB. Still later, after 
the NFL rejected a proposed Los Angeles-area stadium for both the Raiders 
and San Diego Chargers (favoring instead a rival stadium plan that led 
to the return of the Los Angeles Rams from St. Louis), the Raiders have 
entered into talks with authorities in Las Vegas. Currently, soccer-specific 
stadiums are now required by North America's three main soccer leagues: 
Major League Soccer[citation needed], the North American Soccer League, 
and the United Soccer League. In Canada, smaller, more specialized stadiums 
have generally become more popular, but none of the major multiple-use 
stadiums of the 1970s and 1980s have been demolished as of 2015[update]. 
The Toronto Blue Jays shared Rogers Centre with the Toronto Argonauts of 
the CFL before the Argonauts moved to BMO Field after the 2015 season,[12] 
and shared the facility on a part-time basis with the Buffalo Bills of 
the NFL for several years beginning in 2008.[13] Before their 2015–16 move, 
the Argonauts had publicly announced plans to leave Rogers Centre twice, 
only to end up staying; during that time, the originally soccer-specific 
BMO Field was built by Toronto FC. The Blue Jays presently do not have 
any plans to leave Rogers Centre; the Argonauts had proposed renovating 
BMO Field so they could share it with Toronto FC, and the Bills sought 
to end their sharing agreement with the Rogers Centre and return to playing 
all of its games in Buffalo and ultimately did so after the 2013 season. 
BC Place in Vancouver is still used by the BC Lions and was also the Olympic 
Stadium for the 2010 Winter Olympics; the Lions played their 2010 season 
at the temporary Empire Field while BC Place was being renovated to replace 
the original air-supported roof with a retractable roof. The Vancouver 
Whitecaps, which entered Major League Soccer in 2011, shared Empire Field 
and are sharing the renovated BC Place with the Lions. This was intended 
to be a temporary arrangement until the MLS team could build their own 
Whitecaps Stadium, but local opposition to the planned stadium has led 
the Whitecaps to make BC Place a long-term home. The Montreal Expos' owners 
often cited the inadequacy of Olympic Stadium as a reason for the team's 
financial troubles, which eventually led to relocation to Washington, D.C.. 
The Montreal Alouettes moved out of Olympic Stadium to Molson Stadium. 
In soccer, the original Montreal Impact built the smaller Saputo Stadium, 
which was expanded to accommodate the team's 2012 entry into MLS. Both 
the Alouettes and Impact continue to use Olympic Stadium for playoff games 
and other special events when extra capacity is needed. Commonwealth Stadium 
in Edmonton received major upgrades to host the 2001 World Championships 
in Athletics, and continues to host the Edmonton Eskimos, but is not hosting 
the new soccer team, FC Edmonton, which began play in 2011. An added benefit 
of single-sport stadiums that was impossible with the "concrete donut" 
design of the multipurpose stadiums is improved panoramic views of areas 
outside the stadium, such as mountains, bodies of water, or city skylines. 
Examples include CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field, which replaced the 
Kingdome in Seattle, and Heinz Field and PNC Park, which replaced Three 
Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. Still, several modern baseball-specific stadiums 
are able to be (and have been) converted for football use. In addition 
to the aforementioned Safeco Field, which has hosted occasional college 
football games, San Francisco's AT&T Park (which hosted the XFL's San Francisco 
Demons, hosted the college bowl game now known as the Foster Farms Bowl 
from 2002 to 2013, and also hosted California Golden Bears football games 
in the 2011 season while that team's stadium was being renovated), Phoenix's 
Chase Field (which hosted the Insight Bowl from 2000–2005), and St. Petersburg's 
Tropicana Field (which was built as a baseball-specific stadium, but began 
hosting a college bowl game in 2008) have all been used to host professional 
and college games since they were built; Tropicana Field, being an indoor 
stadium, has also hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning ice hockey team for a 
time. (Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., was to be the original host 
of the EagleBank Bowl before that game was moved, first to RFK Stadium[14] 
and eventually to Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland.) 
Yankee Stadium hosts the Pinstripe Bowl, New York City FC soccer (among 
other neutral-site matches), and various other high-profile college football 
games. Furthermore, some teams in the United Football League played their 
home schedule at a baseball-specific stadium. The California Redwoods played 
their home games at the aforementioned AT&T Park; though they moved to 
a football stadium in Sacramento (Sacramento Mountain Lions) in 2010 and 
2011, they moved back to a baseball park (this time Raley Field) for 2012. 
Although their home field was the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, the Florida Tuskers 
played one 2009 home game at Tropicana Field. The team has since moved 
to the Hampton Roads area as the Virginia Destroyers and played its last 
two seasons at a stadium designed for soccer, the Virginia Beach Sportsplex. 
The Omaha Nighthawks played their inaugural 2010 season at a baseball park, 
Rosenblatt Stadium, and played in Rosenblatt's replacement, TD Ameritrade 
Park Omaha (a stadium built mainly for baseball's College World Series, 
but with a round field more reminiscent of the multipurpose stadiums), 
until the league's demise. The New York Sentinels originally planned to 
play their games at Citi Field, the home of baseball's New York Mets; budget 
issues prompted the team to play all of its games in other stadiums. The 
Stars Football League, one of the de facto second-tier professional football 
leagues that filled the void of the UFL's departure, played all of its 
2013 games at Central Broward Regional Park, a stadium designed for cricket. 
The Fall Experimental Football League had two of its teams play in baseball 
parks: the Omaha Mammoths at TD Ameritrade Park and the Brooklyn Bolts 
at MCU Park; for its 2015 season, the league went further and put all of 
its teams in baseball parks (franchises were given to minor league baseball 
franchises so they could use their ballparks after the end of the baseball
