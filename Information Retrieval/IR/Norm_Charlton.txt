Norman Wood Charlton III (born January 6, 1963), nicknamed "The Sheriff", 
is a former Major League Baseball relief pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds 
(1988-1992, 2000), Seattle Mariners (1993, 1995-1997, 2001), Philadelphia 
Phillies (1995), Baltimore Orioles (1998), Atlanta Braves (1998), and Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays (1999). Charlton holds three degrees from Rice University.[1] 
The left-handed Charlton was best known as being part of the infamous "Nasty 
Boys" relief pitching corps for the 1990 Reds team who won the World Series.[2] 
Randy Myers and Rob Dibble were the other two members. The Boys were renowned 
for their clutch, shutdown performances, particularly during the playoff 
run; their blazing fastballs; and their bruising beanballs. Charlton is 
also famous in Cincinnati for plowing over Mike Scioscia to score a run 
in a nationally televised Sunday night game.[3] Charlton was also a key 
member of the two most beloved Mariner teams. During the 1995 "Refuse to 
Lose" team that was the first Mariner team to reach the playoffs, he was 
the team's closer after a midseason trade. As a member of the 2001 team 
that won an MLB record 116 games, he was a lefty specialist, fleshing out 
a bullpen which also featured Japanese closer Kazuhiro Sasaki, Jeff Nelson, 
and fellow lefty Arthur Rhodes. Before the 1998 season, Charlton signed 
a contract to join the Baltimore Orioles bullpen. His subsequent poor pitching 
however led to an explosion of his ERA to 6.94. Baltimore was expected 
to contend in 1998 after having made the playoffs in 1997, but Charlton's 
lackluster performance was a factor in the Orioles having a losing record. 
Charlton was released on July 28. He signed with the Braves a few days 
later. On October 22, 2007, the Mariners named him their bullpen coach. 
Charlton's contract, along with those of the remainder of the 2008 coaching 
staff, was not renewed following the hire of Don Wakamatsu as the club's
