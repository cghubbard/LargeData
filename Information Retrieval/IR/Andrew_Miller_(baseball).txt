Andrew Mark Miller (born May 21, 1985) is an American professional baseball 
relief pitcher for the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played in MLB for the Detroit Tigers, Florida Marlins, Boston 
Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and New York Yankees. He attended the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before the Tigers drafted him. With a 
5.70 earned run average (ERA) over 66 starts early in his major league 
career, Miller converted to full-time relief in 2012, and sustained success 
followed. He won the American League Reliever of the Year Award in 2015, 
and was selected as an All-Star for the first time in 2016. Miller played 
college baseball for the North Carolina Tar Heels, and was the Baseball 
America College Player of the Year and Roger Clemens Award winner in 2006. 
The Tigers chose him sixth overall in the 2006 amateur draft, and he made 
his MLB debut that same year after three minor league appearances. Miller 
was traded by the Tigers to Florida after the 2007 season, then traded 
to Boston after the 2010 season. The Red Sox traded Miller to the Orioles 
in 2014, and Miller signed as a free agent with the Yankees after the season. 
The Yankees traded Miller to the Indians during the 2016 season. Andrew 
Miller was born to David, an accountant and real estate developer, and 
Kim Miller, a pediatric nurse, in Gainesville, Florida.[1] His uncle, Dan 
Miller, is a former NFL and USFL placekicker who played college football 
at the University of Miami. Miller's favorite athlete is Maria Sharapova. 
His favorite book is the The Da Vinci Code and favorite film Days of Thunder.[2] 
Miller pitched for, and graduated from, Buchholz High School in Gainesville. 
As a junior, he was a choice for third-team all-state. For his senior year, 
he was the Florida baseball Gatorade Player of the Year, a selection for 
both pre-season and post-season All-America honors and first-team all-state.[2] 
After graduation from Buchholz, Miller attended the University of North 
Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill and majored in business administration. He 
pitched for the Tar Heels baseball team, posited in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference (ACC).[2] As freshman in 2004, Miller made his college debut 
as a starting pitcher versus Gardner–Webb on February 25, recording six 
shutout innings pitched. He struggled with control early but was selected 
for the weekend rotation in the California series on March 14. On May 16, 
he struck out a season-best 11 batters while allowing three hits in eight 
shutout innings at No. 2 Miami. His first career complete game was on May 
28 against Duke in the ACC Tournament, in which he permitted two runs and 
struck out seven.[2] In 15 starts and three relief appearances in 2004, 
Miller finished with a 6–3 win–loss record (W−L), 2.93 earned run average 
(ERA), 88 strikeouts in 89 innings, and a .202 batting average against 
(BAA). He led the ACC in batting average against, and was third in the 
conference in ERA and fifth with 8.90 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched 
(K/9). He led Tar Heel starters in ERA and led the club in strikeouts. 
He was named second-team All-ACC honors and to Baseball America's All-Freshman 
second team.[2] Miller won his first seven decision of 2005 while permitting 
three earned runs in his first seven starts. In his first three starts, 
all victories over Appalachian State, UNC Wilmington and Birmingham–Southern, 
he allowed one total earned run. He was selected as ACC Pitcher of the 
Week on February 28 and March 21. Miller struck out a career-high 12 batters 
in a no-decision against Arizona State on March 4. On two occasions, he 
carried no-hitters into the sixth inning, once each against Birmingham–Southern 
and Clemson.[2] He tied an NCAA division I record by hitting seven batters 
against Virginia on April 1.[3] Miller pitched in tournament losses both 
to Wake Forest at the ACC Tournament and to Florida in the NCAA Regional 
in his hometown of Gainesville.[2] In 16 starts, Miller totaled 96 2⁄3 
innings and posted an 8–4 record, 2.98 ERA, 104 strikeouts, .230 BAA, 9.68 
K/9, 52 bases on balls and 19 hit batters. The strikeout total ranked as 
the seventh-highest in Tar Heel history and the most since 1995. He led 
the ACC in strikeouts per nine innings, was in sixth in BAA and seventh 
in ERA. For the second consecutive season, Miller earned second-team All-ACC 
honors.[2] As the Tar Heels' season-opening starter on February 19, 2006, 
against Seton Hall, Miller logged six shutout innings with nine strikeouts, 
including reaching 200 for his career. He reached double-figure strikeouts 
totals in wins over George Washington on February 26 (11 strikeouts) and 
Purdue on March 5 (10 strikeouts). He struck out a career-high 13 batters 
in seven shutout innings versus No. 4 Georgia Tech on March 24, and earned 
ACC Pitcher of the Week honors for that week ending March 27. On March 
31, he held No. 1 Florida State scoreless on four hits over seven innings, 
striking out nine. He was named ACC Pitcher of the Week for the second 
consecutive week on April 3.[2] In his win over Boston College on May 18, 
Miller permitted two hits over eight innings to become Carolina's first 
11-game winner since 1995. He also struck out 11 Eagle batters to set the 
school career strikeout record and earned ACC Pitcher of the Week honors 
on May 22 for the third time of the season. In six regular starts against 
nationally-ranked opponents, he was 5–1 with a 1.27 ERA. Miller was credited 
with an 8–1 W–L and 1.94 ERA in ACC regular season competition.[2] Appearing 
in his first College World Series tournament, Miller made his first tournament 
start against No. 2 Cal State Fullerton and struck out nine in 7 1⁄3 innings 
in a no-decision. His first career save was in the Tar Heels' second victory 
over the Titans. Miller achieved his first career postseason win after 
allowing four runs with six strikeouts in eight innings versus Winthrop 
on June 3. In the Tuscaloosa Super Regional victory on June 9 over No. 
4 Alabama, he struck out 11, walked one, and allowed five hits and two 
unearned runs over seven innings.[2] The Tar Heels were runners-up to Oregon 
State for the three-game College World Series championship. Miller started 
Game 1, and allowed three runs and struck out five in five innings.[2] 
In the final game of the three-game series, Miller relieved future Boston 
Red Sox teammate Daniel Bard with the runners on base, including the go-ahead 
and series-deciding run in Bill Rowe on third base. Miller induced the 
first batter he faced, pinch hitter Ryan Gipson, to hit a ground ball. 
Second baseman Bryan Steed fielded and threw wide of first baseman Tim 
Federowicz, allowing Rowe to score and giving Oregon the title.[4] In his 
junior year in 2006, Miller allowed 12 extra base hits,[2] while producing 
a 13−2 W−L with a 2.48 ERA, 133 strikeouts and a .222 BAA in 123 1⁄3 innings.[5] 
He became the first Tar Heel to win 13 games since 1978. In five games, 
he struck out at least 10 batters.[2] A number of awards followed Miller's 
accomplishments in 2006, including Baseball America's College Player of 
the Year[6] and the Roger Clemens Award winner as the nation's top collegiate 
pitcher.[7] The ACC selected him as conference Pitcher of the Year.[8] 
He was chosen to be on the rosters of All-America first teams by Collegiate 
Baseball, Baseball America, NCBWA and Rivals.com.[9] Further, Miller was 
selected as a finalist in 2006 for the Golden Spikes Award by USA Baseball, 
won by Tim Lincecum.[10] Miller set Carolina strikeout records for both 
single season (133 in 2006) and career (325). He also ranked third in Tar 
Heels' history with 27 wins and fourth in total innings pitched with 309. 
He reached double-figures in strikeouts in nine games in his career.[2] 
On January 30, 2016, UNC commemorated Miller's accomplishments during the 
half-time of a men's basketball game versus Boston College and retired 
his uniform number 33. He became the third Tar Heel baseball alumnus thusly 
recognized, following Dave Lemonds and B. J. Surhoff.[11][12] In the summers 
of 2004 and 2005, Miller pitched for the Chatham Anglers (A's) in the Cape 
Cod Baseball League (CCBL). In a July 2004 game versus the Falmouth Commodores 
called by fog after four innings, he struck out 12 batters, including future 
Red Sox teammate Jacoby Ellsbury. With Miller's slider hitting the back 
foot of several hitters as they swung at strike three and missed, controversy 
arose as to whether they had been officially hit by the pitch or were out 
on strikes. However, the game's achievements were not counted as five innings 
would have had to have been completed for the game to be entered as an 
official record.[13] Named to the CCBL All-Star Game that summer, Miller 
played one inning and struck out all three batters faced on 15 pitches.[14] 
His season totals included 48 strikeouts in 40 innings, 2–0 W–L and a 2.03 
ERA. Baseball America named him the league's number one Major League prospect.[2] 
In 2005, Miller posted a 1.65 ERA. Baseball America rated him the College 
Summer Player of the Year and the number one prospect in the CCBL in 2005. 
That year, he also won the Robert A. McNeece Award (outstanding professional 
prospect) and was a co-winner with Tim Norton of Falmouth and Uconn for 
the B.F.C. Whitehouse Outstanding Pitcher Award.[9] Overall with the A's, 
MIller won eight games without being defeated and struck out 114 batters 
in 89 innings. Once the compulsory five-year waiting period concluded, 
Miller was elected to the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2012. Former Chatham general 
manager Charlie Thoms presented him for enshrinement on November 10, 2012, 
at the Chatham Bars Inn.[9] Although Miller was considered a possible first 
overall selection in the 2006 Major League Baseball draft, the Kansas City 
Royals instead took Luke Hochevar,[15] and the Detroit Tigers chose Miller 
sixth overall.[16] They agreed to a contract with a guaranteed value of 
$5.45 million and a signing bonus of $3.55 million on August 4, 2006.[5] 
He made his professional debut on August 20, 2006, with the Lakeland Tigers 
of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. His stint with Lakeland lasted 
less than a week, as he pitched his third and final outing six days later. 
After five scoreless innings with nine strikeouts, Detroit called him up 
to the major leagues.[17] Miller made his major league debut on August 
30, 2006, at Yankee Stadium against the New York Yankees, pitching one 
scoreless inning and allowing one baserunner, Craig Wilson, on a hit by 
pitch.[18] In eight games, Miller posted a 0–1 record with a 6.10 ERA, 
walking ten batters in 9 1⁄3 innings, including seven of 16 left-handers 
faced. The Tigers advanced to the playoffs and did not include him on the 
roster.[19] They lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 World Series.[20] 
Baseball America rated Miller's slider as the best in the Tigers organization 
and the franchise's second-best prospect overall.[21] While Miller did 
not make the Tigers' opening day roster in 2007, he made his first major 
league start May 18, 2007, versus the Cardinals. Starting in place of the 
injured Jeremy Bonderman, he completed six scoreless innings with four 
hits, three walks and two strikeouts, earning his first major league victory. 
Detroit optioned him back to the minors four days later with Bonderman 
recovered from injury. Miller played for Lakeland and the Erie Seawolves 
of the Class AA Eastern League. With the SeaWolves, he started three games 
in May and yielded a 0.78 ERA in 23 IP.[21] The Tigers recalled Miller 
on June 10 when they sent Nate Robertson to the disabled list (DL) with 
arm fatigue, and Miller started that day. He was the winning pitcher by 
decision in a 15–7 victory over the New York Mets. His best game pitched 
of 2007 was a six-inning performance in Atlanta on June 24, allowing four 
hits and no runs while also striking out two batters and walking two ending 
in a 5–0 Tigers victory. In July, he compiled a 2–1 record, 3.71 ERA and 
28 strikeouts over five starts and 26 1⁄3 IP, and was fifth in the American 
League with 9.45 K/9. He went on the DL on August 3 and was reinstated 
on August 24, as he produced a 0–1 record and 19.80 ERA, allowing 11 ER 
in five IP in two starts before being optioned to Lakeland on August 30. 
In 13 starts in 2007, Miller was credited with a 5–5 record and 5.63 ERA. 
He limited left-handed batters (LHB) to a .175 batting average, and right-handers 
(RHB) batted .312 against him, the ninth-highest average against in the 
American League.[21] On December 5, 2007, the Tigers traded Miller, Cameron 
Maybin, Mike Rabelo, Dallas Trahern, Eulogio de la Cruz and Burke Badenhop 
to the Florida Marlins for Dontrelle Willis and Miguel Cabrera.[22] Miller 
started the season in the Marlins rotation. From April 23 to May 10, he 
established a new personal-best three game winning streak. In the month 
of May, he made five starts, going 3–2 with a 2.43 ERA. He made 20 starts 
through July 18 until landing on 15-day disabled list on July 18 with patellar 
tendinitis in the right knee. Through that point, he had posted a 5–9 record 
and 5.63 ERA in 100 2⁄3 innings.[21] Miller played in six rehab games, 
going 1–1 with 2.33 ERA, before reinstatement from the DL on September 
1, 2008. The Marlins moved him to the bullpen, and he went 1–1 W–L and 
9.45 ERA in nine appearances and 6 2⁄3 innings. From June 22 to September 
9, he lost four consecutive decisions, matching his personal high. Reaching 
new career-highs for a season, Miller appeared in 29 games, starting 20, 
and went 6–10 W–L with a 5.87 ERA and 89 strikeouts in 107 1⁄3 innings. 
He allowed a .226 average (21 hits in 93 at bats) and three home runs to 
LHB, and a .321 average (99-for-322) and four home runs to RHB.[21] The 
Marlins initially assigned Miller to the bullpen in 2009 before inserting 
him into the starting rotation on April 15. He injured his oblique muscle 
on April 20. The club placed him on the disabled list and reactivated him 
on May 16. He completed a season-high seven innings and tied a career-best 
with nine strikeouts versus the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 21. Florida 
optioned him to the New Orleans Zephyrs on July 20, where he was 1–2 with 
a 5.79 ERA in 18.2 IP in five starts at the minor league level. He rolled 
his ankle during July 29 start at Nashville. He was recalled to the major 
leagues on September 6. He made 20 appearances in 2009, with 14 of them 
starts, going 3–5 with a 4.84 ERA.[21] During spring training in 2010, 
the Marlins announced that they would assign Miller to their Triple-A minor 
league team, New Orleans to open the season. He also pitched for the Double-A 
Jacksonville Suns, where he made 18 starts and completed 85 1⁄3 innings. 
His record was 1–8 record and ERA 6.01 as he allowed 57 earned runs and 
61 walks with 66 strikeouts.[21] The club recalled him to the major leagues 
on August 18. Miller finished the 2010 year 1–5 with an 8.54 ERA in nine 
games and seven starts. On November 12, 2010, the Marlins traded Miller 
to the Boston Red Sox for relief pitcher Dustin Richardson.[23] Boston 
non-tendered him less than a month later. Manager Terry Francona estimated 
that he "must have made 15 calls that winter trying to get him to come 
to the Red Sox" after they club non-tendered him because he saw that flaws 
in his pitching mechanics could be easily corrected.[24] Miller re-signed 
with Boston on December 16, 2010.[25] During 2011 spring training, Boston 
optioned Miller to minor league camp and announced that he would begin 
the year as a starting pitcher with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox.[26] 
On June 19, 2011, Boston purchased Miller's contract. The Red Sox won the 
first four games that he started, while he was credited as the winning 
pitcher in three of them. His first loss of the 2011 season came on July 
15, as the Tampa Bay Rays hosted the Red Sox at Tropicana Field. Miller 
was pulled after 2 2⁄3 innings, having already given up seven runs on five 
hits, including a grand slam to Ben Zobrist.[27] He finished the 2011 year 
6–3 with a 5.54 ERA in 17 games and 12 starts. Miller began the 2012 season 
in the minors while recovering from an injury. When he was called up to 
the majors, the Red Sox moved him to the bullpen,[28] which became permanent 
after having posted a 5.70 ERA in 66 career starts.[29] Miller limited 
left-handed batters (LHB) to a .149 average (13-for-87) in 2012, the second-lowest 
in the AL for all pitchers with a minimum of 100 batters faced, and the 
lowest average by a Red Sox left-handed pitcher since at least 1974. He 
allowed one extra-base hit to LHB over the season, on May 23, and afterward 
allowed 10 more hits to LHB. Of 46 runners inherited, he stranded 39 (84.8 
percent), the fifth best in the AL, and the eighth-best ratio of Red Sox 
relievers since at least 1974 who had inherited 30 or more runners. He 
recorded a team-high 31 hitless appearances and produced 22 perfect outings.[21] 
Miller's 2012 totals included a 3–2 record and a 3.35 ERA in 53 appearances. 
His totals in games, ERA, holds (13), WHIP (1.19), opponent AVG (.194), 
walks per 9.0 innings (4.46), and K/9 (11.38) were all career-bests. The 
Boston BBWAA named Miller Red Sox Fireman of the Year in his first full 
season of relief pitching.[21] In a July 6, 2013, game against the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Miller tripped and suffered a foot injury by 
while covering home plate after J. B. Shuck had hit a single.[30] Podiatrist 
Dr. George Theodore found torn ligaments in the Lisfranc zone of his foot. 
As a result, Miller missed the remainder of the 2013 season.[31] He had 
accumulated a 1–2 W–L with a 2.64 ERA and 48 strikeouts over 30 2⁄3 innings 
in 37 games.[32] He averaged a career-best 2.82 strikeout-to-walk ratio 
(K/BB) and career-high 14.1 K/9, the second-highest ratio for all MLB relievers 
with at least 30 IP.[21] Despite his year-ending absence, the Red Sox awarded 
Miller a championship ring after winning the World Series.[33] Miller reached 
new levels of success in 2014 with Boston. He was especially effective 
at home at Fenway Park, stranding 24 of 26 inherited runners (92.3%) and 
allowing one run in 26 games for a 0.39 ERA in 23 IP while limiting opponents 
to a .105 batting average and career-low .229 on-base percentage.[21] His 
season totals with the Red Sox included 50 appearances with a 3–5 W–L, 
2.34 ERA, 13 walks and 69 strikeouts in 42 1⁄3 innings.[1] On July 31, 
2014, Boston traded Miller to the Baltimore Orioles for minor-league pitcher 
Eduardo Rodríguez.[34] On September 7, 2014, Miller completed a scoreless 
11th in a 7−5 victory over Tampa Bay for his first career save.[35] The 
Orioles clinched their first American League East title in 17 years on 
September 16, 2014, in an 8−2 win over Toronto.[36] He faced two batters 
in that game and struck both out.[37] According to Brooks Baseball, opponents 
batted .071 against Miller's slider in 2014,[38] and .153 against him overall.[16] 
In 23 appearances with Baltimore, Miller finished 2–0 with a 1.35 ERA. 
With both Boston and Baltimore in 2014, Miller made 73 appearances going 
5–5 with a 2.02 ERA and 103 strikeouts. During the Orioles' American League 
Division Series (ALDS) sweep of the Detroit Tigers, Miller earned a hold 
in two of the Oriole victories. He pitched a total of 3 2⁄3 innings of 
no-hit and no-run baseball while striking out three Tigers batters[39] 
and retired 22 of 24 batters faced in seven scoreless innings overall in 
the 2014 playoffs.[24] On December 5, 2014, Miller reached an agreement 
on a contract with the New York Yankees lasting four years and worth $36 
million.[40] Before the season started, Yankees manager Joe Girardi announced 
that Miller and Dellin Betances would split the closing job. Both men had 
one career save entering the season.[41] Miller began the season with 17 2⁄3 
scoreless innings,[42] recording his first save in a Yankee uniform on 
April 8, 2015.[43] On April 27, he became the first Yankee player to record 
eight saves in a 20-game span.[44] According to Brooks Baseball, opponents 
batted .092 against Miller's slider in 2015.[38] Miller finished the season 
with a 2.04 ERA, 36 saves, and 100 strikeouts in 61 2⁄3 innings pitched. 
He won the 2015 American League Relief Pitcher of the Year Award,[45] the 
Rollie Fingers American League Relief Pitcher of the Year as voted by the 
Internet Baseball Writers' Association of America,[46] and was recognized 
at the 2016 Thurman Munson Awards as the Yankees' "premier closer" for 
2015.[47] In the AL Cy Young Award voting, Miller placed tenth.[48] Prior 
to the 2016 season, the Yankees informed Miller that he would serve as 
the seventh inning setup man[49] with the acquisition of Aroldis Chapman, 
considered one of baseball's top closers.[50] However, early in spring 
training, MLB suspended Chapman for 30 games to commence with the start 
of the upcoming regular season, and the Yankees temporarily reinstalled 
Miller as closer.[51] At the end of spring training, a line drive fractured 
the pisiform bone in his right hand. He decided to pitch with the fracture, 
providing an analysis that, “according to Wikipedia, it’s not really an 
important bone. It doesn’t really do anything.” [52] Until Chapman's return, 
Miller saved nine games. While with the Yankees, the triumvirate of Betances, 
Chapman and Miller were known by fans as "No Runs–D.M.C., owing to the 
relievers' dominance of opposing hitters.[53] Miller was selected to his 
first All-Star Game, played at Petco Park in San Diego. He pitched two-thirds 
of an inning and was removed after loading the bases, but no runs were 
charged to him.[54] Before the midseason trade, Miller recorded 77 strikeouts 
in 45 1⁄3 innings while posting an ERA of 1.39 in 44 games for the Yankees. 
On July 31, 2016, the Yankees traded Miller to the Cleveland Indians for 
Clint Frazier, Justus Sheffield, Ben Heller and J. P. Feyereisen.[55] Miller's 
first save for Cleveland was in a 5−2 victory over New York at Yankee Stadium 
on August 6, 2016. He became the first pitcher to earn a save for and against 
the Yankees in the same season since 1988.[56] Francona, now reunited with 
Miller as the Indians' manager, commented that he saw "a guy that is willing 
to pitch any inning." He deployed Miller in every inning from the fifth 
into extra innings,[57] "in the highest stress situations,"[58] appearing 
before the eighth inning in nine of 26 games. With Cleveland, Miller completed 
29 innings, allowed two walks, and struck out 46, posting a 1.55 ERA. With 
both the Yankees and Indians in the 2016 regular season, he totaled a 10−1 
record, 1.45 ERA, 0.68 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP),[59] 123 
strikeouts and nine walks.[57] He became the first major leaguer in history 
to record 120 or more strikeouts in a season while allowing fewer than 
ten walks.[60] According to Brooks Baseball, opponents batted .159 against 
Miller's slider in 2016.[38] I have been in many postseasons and hadn't 
seen anybody dominate like Andrew Miller. Not even the great Mariano Rivera 
I saw having as much success as Andrew Miller, overpowering hitters. The 
Indians swept Boston in the ALDS and Miller completed four innings in two 
appearances, permitting two hits, walking two and striking out seven.[61] 
He played in two innings each of Games 1 and 2 in the American League Championship 
Series (ALCS) against the Toronto Blue Jays, he striking out ten of 12 
batters faced. After striking out Kevin Pillar in the seventh inning of 
Game 2, he matched Phil Coke in the 2012 World Series as the only pitchers 
to strike out at least five consecutive batters in the postseason. Miller 
also became the first pitcher in major league history to strike out at 
least five batters each on consecutive days.[60] Covering his first four 
appearances in the 2016 postseason, he struck out 17 in 7 2⁄3 innings.[61] 
Miller recorded the final four outs of Game 3, striking out three in a 
4−2 win, for his first career postseason save.[62] In Game 5, he completed 
2 2⁄3 innings as the Indians won the ALCS. He was named ALCS Most Valuable 
Player (MVP), having completed 7 2⁄3 scoreless innings, allowing three 
hits, no walks and striking out 14. His strikeout total set an ALCS record 
for relievers. He also was credited with three holds and one save.[63] 
At that point, he had completed 20 scoreless innings to begin his playoff 
career.[64] In Game 3 of the World Series against the Chicago Cubs, Miller 
was credited with his first World Series win in a 1–0 victory. After striking 
out three of four batters faced in 1 1⁄3 innings, he reached 15 consecutive 
scoreless inning in the 2016 playoffs, surpassing Mariano Rivera and Goose 
Gossage to set the record for relief pitchers in a single playoff.[65][66] 
In Game 4, he struck out two Cubs hitters, bringing his 2016 playoff total 
to 29, and surpassing Francisco Rodríguez' total of 28 in the 2002 postseason 
for the all-time record among relievers in a postseason.[67] Dexter Fowler 
homered off Miller, ending his scoreless streak at 17 innings in the 2016 
playoffs and 24 1⁄3 to commence his postseason career.[68] In Game 7, Miller 
allowed five batters to reach base and two runs to score in 2 1⁄3 innings 
as the Indians lost the game and Series.[69] Attempting to lead sequences 
against hitters with the fastball and myriad mechanical issues limited 
Miller's success as a starting pitcher early in his major league career. 
He also threw a changeup more frequently earlier in his career. His most 
effective pitch is the slider (83-87 mph), and after he began to use that 
more frequently, he experimented more with varying the output. One variety, 
with a flat and horizontal break, more closely resembles a fastball than 
the others by traveling in a more direct path. Another is designed to dart 
toward the back foot of a right-handed batter.[70] He’s probably the nastiest 
guy I’ve ever caught. He has got a funky delivery — and throwing hard from 
the left side, too. He comes at you, and that slider, man, it’s untouchable. 
Unhittable. Said former Tigers manager Jim Leyland of Miller's early struggles, 
"He was like a lot of guys breaking into the profession and wasn’t sure 
what it was all about. He had a huge arm – big, big stuff — but he found 
it tough to repeat his delivery.[72] ... He didn't have the command. But 
I think he's got it right. This game is hard. Success is definitely not 
a straight line, but are you willing to work?"[73] With each of the different 
teams for which he played before converting to relief, Miller experimented 
with different pitching philosophies. Detroit encouraged him to throw harder 
while Florida wanted him to throw more changeups and curveballs. He also 
experimented with the different arm slots. One day while playing bullpen 
catch with Edward Mujica as teammates in Boston, he suggested that Miller 
keep his back foot on the rubber as long as possible. This allowed Miller 
to increase the stability of his feet before pivoting and aid his mechanics.[74]
