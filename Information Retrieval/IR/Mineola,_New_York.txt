Mineola is a village in Nassau County, Long Island, New York, USA. The 
population was 18,799 at the 2010 census. The name is derived from a Native 
American[clarification needed] word meaning a "pleasant place". Most of 
the Incorporated Village of Mineola is located in the Town of North Hempstead, 
with a small portion of its southern edge within the Town of Hempstead.[1] 
Old Country Road runs along the southern border of the village. The area 
serviced by the Mineola Post Office extends farther south into the adjacent 
village of Garden City, New York, where the county seat of Nassau County[2] 
is located. Offices of many Nassau County agencies are located in both 
Mineola and Garden City. The central, flat, grassy part of Long Island 
was originally named "Hempstead Plains". In the 19th century various communities 
were started. One of them was called "Hempstead Branch", and finally, "Mineola". 
Long Island was part of Henry Hudson's original claim in the name of the 
Dutch East India Company dating as far back as 1609. In the 18th century 
the Dutch and English settlers worked to clear farmland to start their 
life on the Hempstead Plains. It was in 1858 when this land was named after 
an Algonquin Indian Chief, Miniolagamika meaning, "Pleasant Village". The 
name was later shortened and altered to "Mineola". From about 1787 until 
the 1870s, the area was the county seat for Queens County, in a section 
then known as Clowesville,[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] just 
outside the present village boundaries. The western portion of Queens became 
a borough of New York City in 1898, and in 1899 Nassau County was formed 
from the part of Queens that did not so consolidate. Voters selected Mineola 
(in the Town of North Hempstead) to be the county seat for the new county 
of Nassau in November 1898[15] (before Mineola incorporated as a village 
in 1906 and set its boundaries), winning out over Hicksville and Hempstead.[16] 
The Garden City Company (founded in 1893 by the heirs of Alexander Turney 
Stewart)[17] donated four acres of land for the county buildings just south 
of the Mineola train station and the present day Village of Mineola, in 
the Town of Hempstead.[18][19] Mineola officially became the County Seat 
on July 13, 1900, as Governor Theodore Roosevelt laid the cornerstone of 
the Nassau County Court House. A celebration was held to commemorate the 
occasion on the barren 5-acre (20,000 m2) site at the corner of Old Country 
Road and Franklin Avenue. Many dignitaries were present to witness this 
event such as Frederick Hicks, Congressman Townsend Scudder, Colonel William 
Youngs and Supervisors William Jones and Edwin Willits. Mineola was legally 
incorporated in 1906 and run by a president. The land on which the County 
buildings sat was not included as part of the village. The land and the 
buildings have a Mineola postal address, but are within the present day 
Village of Garden City,[20] which did not incorporate, nor set its boundaries, 
until 1919. Winthrop-University Hospital, founded in 1896 by local physicians 
and residents as Nassau Hospital, was Long Island's first voluntary hospital. 
In 1897, it admitted 91 patients, performed 27 operations, and reported 
two births and eight deaths during the first year. The original hospital 
was constructed in 1900. Renamed Winthrop in the 1980s, it is now a nationally-recognized 
award-winning hospital and in 2004 was ranked among the Top 5 Percent of 
Acute-Care Hospitals in the Country. Mineola was also a familiar place 
to many of the most famous pilots in history. The Aero Club of America 
chose the area for the level plains. Glenn Curtiss brought the area to 
national attention in July 1909 with his second Scientific American Award 
flight of over 23 minutes and 15 miles. He also made some of the first 
public flights in America in his "Golden Flyer", while practicing for the 
Reims Aviation Meet in France. The Wright Brothers, Igor Sikorsky, Captain 
Rene Fonck, and the famed duo of Clarence Chamberlain and Bert Acosta, 
dubbed "twins of derring-do", all spent time in Mineola taking advantage 
of the rolling grasslands and favorable winds. On November 1, 1915, Captain 
Raynal Cawthorne Bolling—a prominent New York attorney working at United 
States Steel—organized the Aviation Detachment, 1st Battalion Signal Corps 
of the New York National Guard (now the 102d Rescue Squadron). It was the 
Guard's first genuine aviation unit. Subsequently, the organization was 
redesignated the lst Aero Company. Located at Mineola on Long Island, the 
unit rented and then purchased its own aircraft with funds donated by the 
Aero Club of America and other contributors. It was "provisionally recognized" 
on June 22, 1916 and then called into federal service on July 13, 1916 
during the Mexican border crisis. However, instead of active service in 
the southwest, it remained at Mineola training and was released from federal 
service on November 2, 1916. On May 20, 1927, at 7:52 a.m., Charles Lindbergh 
started his historic flight from nearby Roosevelt Field. Thirty-three hours 
later he landed in Paris and became the first person to complete a solo 
flight from the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. Main Street was 
the center of village business as well as a popular meeting place for farmers 
and the business community alike. The general store offered an array of 
goods that would fulfill most everyday needs, such as hardware, toys, wool, 
dry goods, clothing and food. The small glass-fronted mail and delivery 
boxes filled the existing six-foot post office. As the Mineola population 
grew, the post office was relocated to the Meyer Building on Mineola Boulevard 
and then twice more to 3rd Street and 2nd Street. It eventually found its 
permanent home on 1st Street and Main Street. Mineola's first theatre named 
Allen's Hall drew in many early moviegoers to see "the flickers". Motion 
picture success drew in other theaters to the area, the most lavish being 
the Century Opera House. Most theaters had a showing in the morning and 
in the evening, usually featuring a live pianist who kept up with the action 
of the movie while playing music that suited the story. As years passed, 
Jericho Turnpike became the commercial "main street", farmland was sold 
off, and homes and offices were built. Mineola has continued to be a community 
of growth and development. Mineola held its centennial celebration in 2006.

of local laws to address village concerns. They are appointed to be liaison 
officers to various community organizations throughout the village and 
report back to the board with updates at board meetings.[27] The current 
trustees are: In 2005-2006, as a result of numerous recommendations from 
the community that Mineola increase its police force, a Mineola Police 
Task Force was appointed by Mayor Jack M. Martins to evaluate the feasibility 
of withdrawing from the Nassau County Police Department and establishing 
a village police force. The Mayor indicated to the Task Force at its inception 
that if the feasibility study resulted in a positive report, Mineola would 
only have its own police department if the residents approved such through 
a Village-wide referendum.[28] The village board was split 3-2 in favor 
of the police force with Mayor Jack Martins, Deputy Mayor Werther and Trustee 
Davanzo supporting it while Trustees Fargrieve and Cusato opposed it. On 
December 5, 2006 the measure was defeated by a 2-1 margin.[29] Mineola
