Altoona is a city in central Pennsylvania Blair County, Pennsylvania, United 
States. It is the principal city of the Altoona Metropolitan Statistical 
Area (MSA). The population was 46,320 at the time of the 2010 Census, making 
it the eleventh most populous city in Pennsylvania. The Altoona MSA includes 
all of Blair County and was recorded as having a population of 127,089 
at the 2010 Census,[5] around 100,000 of which live within a 5-mile (8.0 km) 
radius of the Altoona city center according to U.S. Census zip code population 
data. This includes the adjacent boroughs of Hollidaysburg and Duncansville, 
adjacent townships of Logan, Allegheny, Blair, Frankstown, Antis, and Tyrone, 
as well as nearby boroughs of Bellwood and Newry. Having grown around the 
railroad industry,[6] the city is currently working to recover from industrial 
decline and urban decentralization experienced in recent decades. The city 
is home to the Altoona Curve baseball team of the Double A Eastern League, 
which is the affiliate of the Major League Baseball team Pittsburgh Pirates. 
It also houses the 75+ year-old Altoona Symphony Orchestra,[7] under the 
direction of Teresa Cheung. Prominent landmarks include the Horseshoe Curve, 
the Railroaders Memorial Museum, the Juniata Shops of the Altoona Works, 
the Mishler Theatre, the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, and the Jaffa 
Shrine Center. As a major railroad town, Altoona was founded by the Pennsylvania 
Railroad (PRR) in 1849 as the site for a shop and maintenance complex. 
Altoona was incorporated as a borough on February 6, 1854, and as a city 
under legislation approved on April 3, 1867, and February 8, 1868.[8] One 
explanation of the city's name is that the word "Altoona" is a derivative 
of the Latin word altus, meaning "high".[9] This explanation is contradicted 
by Pennsylvania Place Names.[10] Although Altoona, in Blair Country, is 
popularly known as "the Mountain City", its name has no direct or indirect 
etymological relation to the Latin adjective altus, signifying "elevated, 
lofty." Two very different explanations of the origin of this name are 
current. The one which seems to be most natural and reasonable runs as 
follows: "The locomotive engineer who ran the first train into Altoona 
in 1851 was Robert Steele, who died several years ago, aged nearly ninety 
years. He was then the oldest continuous resident of the city. He was much 
respected, and had long been one of the private pensioners of Andrew Carnegie. 
Mr. Steele is authority for the statement that Colonel Beverly Mayer, of 
Columbia, Pennsylvania, who, as a civil engineer of what was then the Pennsylvania 
Central Railway, had laid out the tracks in the yards of the newly projected 
city, named the place Altoona after the city of Altona in danish Holstein, 
which became part of Germany in 1864."[citation needed] The German Altona, 
which is today a district of Hamburg, lies on the right bank of the Elbe, 
immediately west of Hamburg city center, and is an important railway and 
manufacturing centre with a population of nearly 200,000. The etymological 
derivation of the name Altona is not known with certainty, but widely believed 
to be Low German all to na, meaning "all too near" (sc. Hamburg).[citation 
needed] In 1849 David Robinson sold his farm to Archibald Wright of Philadelphia, 
who transferred the property to his son, John A. Wright, who laid it out 
in building lots, became one of the founders of Altoona, and was responsible 
for the naming of the town. According to his own statement, he had spent 
considerable time in the Cherokee country of Georgia, where he had been 
especially attracted by the beautiful name of Allatoona, which he had bestowed 
upon the new town in the belief that it was a Cherokee word meaning "the 
high lands of great worth." In the Cherokee language there is a word eladuni, 
which means "high lands", or "where it is high"; but to a Cherokee, Allatoona 
and eladuni are so different that the former could hardly be derived from 
the latter.[citation needed] An older history dated 1883 [11] favored the 
Cherokee derivation, stating that "Its name is not derived from the Latin 
word altus nor from the French word alto, as has frequently been asserted 
and published, but from the beautiful, liquid, and expressive Cherokee 
word allatoona. This is on the authority of the person who bestowed the 
name, Mr. Wright, of Philadelphia, who was long a resident of the Cherokee 
country in Georgia, and an admirer of the musical names of that Indian 
language."[citation needed] The town grew rapidly in the late 19th century, 
its population approximately 2,000 in 1854, 10,000 in 1870, and 20,000 
in 1880. The demand for locomotives during the Civil War stimulated much 
of this growth, and by the later years of the war Altoona was known as 
a valuable city for the North. Altoona was also the site of the first Interstate 
Commission meeting to create and design the Gettysburg National Cemetery 
following the devastating Battle of Gettysburg. The centrality and convenience 
of the town's rail transportation brought these two important gatherings 
to the city during the war.[citation needed] Horseshoe Curve, a curved 
section of track built by the PRR, has become a tourist attraction and 
National Historic Landmark. The curve was used to raise trains to a sufficient 
elevation to cross the Allegheny Ridge to the west. The Allegheny Ridge 
had been a major barrier and construction of the Erie Canal in New York 
twenty years earlier already had diverted much port traffic which had used 
Philadelphia to New York City instead, causing the rise of that city's 
commercial dominance. Because the curve was an industrial link to the western 
U.S., Horseshoe Curve was a primary target of eight Nazi saboteurs who 
had infiltrated the U.S. during World War II by being dropped off by U-boats 
of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during Operation Pastorius.[12] In the early 
20th century, PRR's Altoona Works complex employed, at its peak, approximately 
15,000 people and covered three miles (5 km) in length, 218 acres (88 ha) 
of yards and 37 acres (15 ha) of indoor workshop floor space in 122 buildings. 
The PRR built many of its own locomotives at the Works, some 7,873 in all, 
the last being constructed in 1946.[13] PRR had significant influence on 
the city, creating the city's fire departments and relocating the hospital 
to a site nearer to the shop's gates. Today, the fire department employs 
65 personnel and is the largest career department between Harrisburg and 
Pittsburgh.[14] PRR sponsored a city band and constructed Cricket Field 
(a sports complex). In 1853, the PRR built the Mechanic's Library, the 
first industrial library in the nation which exists today as the Altoona 
Area Public Library.[15] With the decline in railroad demand after World 
War II, things began to decline. Many treasures of the city's history disappeared, 
including the Logan House Hotel and railroad shops.[13] On May 22, 1949, 
at about 6:00 pm a tornado moved through the southern part of Altoona. 
According to the Altoona Mirror the tornado touched down near Sugar Run 
Road in the Canan Station area and cut a 100-yard swath of destruction 
through the south western portion of Altoona. Trees over a foot in diameter 
were "twisted apart" and several houses were unroofed, and garages were 
demolished in the Canan Station and Sugar Run areas. Along 58th street 
large trees were uprooted, one of them left a seven-foot hole in the ground. 
Also on 58th street, the roof was torn off of a restaurant, as was the 
brand new neon sign, also a large billboard was pushed to the ground. Houses 
lost shingles and there was extensive tree damage in the Eldorado and Llyswin 
sections of town. Huge trees were blown down in Highland Park. The Adams 
School, which is located near the end of the tornado's path at 6th Avenue 
and 24th street had damage to its slate roof and several windows were blown 
out. Another tornado touched down in Morrisons Cove. Houses were unroofed 
and barns were destroyed in the Henrietta and Millerstown Area. A 17-year-old 
girl was injured in Henrietta. The damage done by these tornadoes is consistent 
with winds of 105-110MPH.[16] A map made by Dr. Ted Fujita, in 1974 of 
all of the tornadoes in the U.S between 1930 and 1974, shows these two 
tornadoes mapped as F1 tornadoes on the Fujita Scale.[17] Altoona is one 
of the dual seats of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona–Johnstown. The 
Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament was made a cathedral and rechristened 
from St. John's Church in 1851. The Altoona Mirror newspaper,[18] founded 
in 1876 by Harry Slep, is Altoona's oldest media outlet. Today, the newspaper 
has a daily circulation of 32,000 and a Sunday circulation of 39,000. Approximately 
13,000 people read the online edition of the newspaper each day. Altoona 
serves as the corporate home to Sheetz, a rapidly growing convenience store 
chain in the United States. It now has over 500 locations throughout Pennsylvania, 
Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio and North Carolina. Altoona is 
home to the world's oldest wooden roller coaster, the Leap-The-Dips, located 
in Lakemont Park. Altoona lies at the base of Brush Mountain within Logan 
Valley and Pleasant Valley. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 9.8 sq mi (25.3 km²), all land. Altoona is 
situated in the Allegheny Mountains. Altoona has a humid continental climate 
(Köppen Dfb) climate, with cold, snowy winters, and humid, very warm summers. 
The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 23.8 °F (−4.6 °C) in 
January to 70.8 °F (21.6 °C) in July, although extremes in temperature 
have ranged from −29 °F (−34 °C) in 1904 to 103 °F (39 °C) in 2011. Unofficial 
readings in town below -30 in the cold snap of January 1977 were recorded, 
but the official low on that night was "only" -20. Total precipitation 
is greatest in May and least in February. Snowfall averages 60.6 inches 
(154 cm) per season, with almost all of that total occurring from December 
to March, although significant falls are not unheard of in May and October. 
There are several townships outside of Altoona city limits that, although 
autonomous, use the name Altoona for postal and name-place designation. 
They include the townships of: Logan Township and Tyrone Township, as well 
as small parts of Allegheny Township and Frankstown Township. The main 
sections of Altoona are the Downtown, Center City, Logantown, Fairview, 
Juniata, Wehnwood, Calvert Hills, 5th Ward, Westmont, Eldorado, East End, 
Dutch Hill, Pleasant Valley, Hileman Heights, 6th Ward, Mansion Park, Llyswen, 
Garden Heights, and Highland Park. Some significant neighborhoods are: 
Little Italy, Gospel Hill, Toy Town, Columbia Park, Knickerbockers, and 
Curtin. Some areas within Logan Township are not within the defined City 
limits but still considered sections of Altoona, including: Lakemont, Greenwood, 
Bellmeade, Westfall, Newburg, and Red Hill. Many of the older districts 
consist of a mix of rowhomes and individual homes, which were a common 
building style in railroad towns so-as to provide for worker and manager 
housing, respectively. The downtown is the cultural and commercial center 
of Altoona and straddles the famous railroads. As is typical to a traditional 
city layout, the downtown is centrally located and contains significant 
development in all directions from the downtown. Much of the downtown area 
is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Downtown Altoona 
Historic District.[20] Popular landmarks include the Mishler Theatre, the 
Penn Alto Building (formerly the Penn Alto Hotel), the Gable's Building, 
City Hall, the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, and Eleventh Avenue 
itself. Altoona is notable for having several churches, such as the Cathedral 
of the Blessed Sacrament at the corner of 13th Street and 13th Avenue, 
the building on the corner of 12th Street and 14th Avenue that used to 
house the First Presbyterian Church, and the First Lutheran Church on the 
corner of 14th Street and 12th Avenue. The Station Medical Center, formerly 
known as the Station Mall, was a downtown mall built during the 1970s in 
place of many old railroad shops. The downtown contains most of what's 
known as Altoona's Little Italy district. Because of the geography of the 
area, exact or natural boundaries for Downtown are not present. Therefore, 
Downtown is generally defined by what the City has zoned as Central Business: 
between 13th Ave and the PRR Expressway, and from 7th Street to 16th Street. 
However, it is common for areas within Logantown and Center City to be 
expressed locally as "downtown." The Texas Hot Dog was originally created 
in downtown Altoona in 1918, although the Paterson, New Jersey Texas Hot 
Dog location, which opened in 1924, is more famous. The commercial core 
of the downtown includes many multistory residential, commercial, and mixed-use 
facilities designed in at the turn-of-the-20th-century in a mix of Victorian, 
Edwardian Baroque, and Neo-Romanesque styles. This style features high 
ceilings, resulting in taller buildings than is typical for the number 
of floors. The high ceilings are typically made of either tin or plaster, 
although sometimes a drop ceiling is utilized. Individual homes originally 
provided housing to managers and executives of the PRR and have structural 
similarities to Victorian or Edwardian mansions, but built very narrow 
and tall. These are sometimes used as double or triple family apartments 
or even converted into commercial space. Outside of the commercial core 
is a mosaic of multistory commercial structures, mixed use facilities, 
single story commercial structures, apartment buildings, multi-unit housing, 
and single-family homes. The United States post office in Altoona contains 
two oil-on-canvas WPA commissioned murals painted by Lorin Thompson in 
1938 titled Pioneers of Altoona and Growth of the Road.[21] Murals were 
produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of 
Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury 
Department. As typical of many Rust Belt cities, the economic downturn 
of the railroad resulted in the closure of many of the downtown's landmark 
stores and industries; and the simultaneous rise in prominence of the automobile 
shifted commercial development to the suburbs. However, through recent 
revitalization efforts, Altoona's downtown maintains a significant level 
of economic vitality and hosts few office and residential vacancies.[citation 
needed] The downtown maintains a significant focus on pedestrian-oriented 
development, as evidenced by the presence of more pedestrian bridges and 
underpasses across the railroad tracks (connecting the two parts of downtown) 
than automobile crossings. Penn State Altoona has bought several downtown 
buildings, including the former Playhouse Theater building, the six-story 
Penn Furniture building, and the former WRTA building. The University has 
turned them into the Devorris Downtown Center, the Aaron Building and the 
Kazmaier Family Building. Recently Sheetz has added another building to 
Penn State Altoona called The Sheetz Center for Entrepreneurial Excellence 
on the former site of a department store behind the Amtrak Station. The 
University provides a flow of resources into the downtown, aiding in revitalization 
efforts. As an example of the university's value to the downtown's economy, 
the installation of the Blue Lot near the Wolf Court Building has improved 
the economic attraction of downtown by offering up to three hours of free 
parking. A bike path connecting the Campus to Downtown Altoona has also 
been built. Center City comprises industrial and commercial zones as well 
as urban and multiple household residential zones. Often, the Center City, 
Little Italy, and Gospel Hill areas (as well as Lower Fairview) are included 
as part of "downtown" for tourism and promotional purposes, much like how 
the Strip District in Pittsburgh is promoted. This is due to both the proximity 
and the fact that the buildings from these sections are similar to downtown 
buildings and blend in with the skyline. On the west side of the tracks, 
Center City extends around Downtown 2-3 blocks with heavy residential, 
industrial and commercial to the north, south and west. The eastern side 
of the tracks, which according to the public maps is called "East Side", 
runs along the length of the tracks from 1st Street to 23rd street and 
from the tracks to 6th Avenue west to east. However, the Altoona Area High 
School is considered Center City despite standing on the Dutch Hill side 
of 6th Avenue. The East Side of Center City is home to the High School 
and Junior High, the former Roosevelt Junior High School, the Altoona Railroaders 
Museum, Boyer Candies, the Station Medical Center of Altoona Regional Health 
System, as well as many current and old railroad facilities. The neighborhood 
area known as Little Italy is the neighborhood between 7th Street and 12th 
Street north to south and 9th Ave to 6th Ave west to east, sometimes this 
is extended to include the Station Medical Center. Gospel Hill is the neighborhood 
in the area of 15th Street and 16th Ave and adjacent to the park of the 
same name. Logantown is the area just north of the Downtown and is considered 
a direct extension of Downtown. It borders Fairview along 16th Ave, Willow 
Ave and Cherry Ave to the north, 13th Ave and Chestnut Ave to the south, 
and Juniata Gap Road to the east. This is where UPMC Altoona is located, 
which is the tallest building in Altoona at 14 Floors. This is also where 
Cricket Field used to be located. Logantown is zoned as a mix of commercial 
and residential, and contains some of the oldest houses built in Altoona 
that are still standing. Fairview is a mostly residential area North and 
West of Downtown and Logantown. It borders Calvert Hills to the south at 
12th Street, Downtown and Logantown to the east along 16th Ave and Willow 
Ave and then along Cherry Ave after 5th Street, and borders Juniata Gap 
Road to the north. Fairview is zoned as multiple household residential 
in the areas directly bordering Downtown, and transitions to single household 
residential after 21st Avenue, and eventually to suburban after 24th Ave. 
Many houses in the part of downtown near Fairview and lower Fairview are 
the middle-density mansions originally owned by managers and executives 
of the PRR. The most striking example of this is the Penn Alto residential 
hotel on the corner of 13th Avenue and 12th Street, which has two single-unit 
houses next to it. Conversely, there are several multistory residential 
and commercial buildings on 17th Avenue. One of the sections of the downtown 
is called "Lower Fairview" due to its transitional nature. The houses between 
14th and 15th avenues (with two commercial buildings included) on 12th 
street are designed based on an architectural pattern used in Philadelphia's 
urban neighborhoods. Dutch Hill district contains an abundance of historic 
neighborhoods and traditional "corner markets". This section gets its name 
from the abundance of Germans who moved into this area when the City was 
still expanding. Dutch Hill is the area that borders the City Center to 
the East and is zoned as multiple household residential. The boundaries 
are generally considered 4th Street to 17th Street north to south, and 
6th Avenue to Walton Avenue from west to east. However, as the Altoona 
Area High School and Junior High are considered City Center, the border 
is around 4th Ave (or 3rd Ave if the entire school zone is included) when 
between 11th Street and 17th Street. Juniata is defined as north of Juniata 
Gap Road, east of East 25th Ave and on the west side of the railroad line. 
The area is zoned as mostly residential limited, but also uniquely has 
a significant area of light and heavy industrial as well as a central business 
area. This is because Juniata was once its own city, and was incorporated 
into Altoona in the late 19th century. Because of this, the section's street 
names had conflicting numbers with the rest of the City, and had to be 
given a North prefix. The commercial area is sometimes nicknamed "downtown 
Juniata." The most important street in Juniata's L-shaped commercial district 
is North Fourth Avenue. The J.L. Noble School was added to the National 
Register of Historic Places in 1996.[22] The original Thompson's Pharmacy 
was on 2nd Street in Juniata before moving a few blocks to a larger main 
store and branching out to become a small, local chain. The East End is 
defined as the area on the east side of the railroad line north of 4th 
Street. It is called the East End because it borders the north end of the 
tracks where trains would depart east towards Philadelphia. Because of 
this, most streets have an East prefix. The East End is mostly single household 
residential and suburban, but has small areas of residential-commercial 
and neighborhood business along Kettle Street and Lloyd Street, as well 
as highway business along Pleasant Valley Blvd. Pleasant Valley is the 
area that centers on Pleasant Valley Boulevard, which is a massive stretch 
of highway business that runs the entire length of Altoona. The Sheetz 
store known locally as "Supersheetz" is located here along 17th Street 
and was the first of its kind ever built. The area is defined as southeast 
of Walton Ave and extends from 1st Street til 22nd Street and defined by 
Polk Ave to the east. As well as the large highway business area, Pleasant 
Valley also has an even amount of single household residential and suburban 
along with some small stretches of residential commercial and urban. Eldorado 
(pronounced locally as "El-doe-ray-doe") is the southern section of Altoona, 
south of Logan Boulevard and west of 6th Avenue as well as a small section 
south of 57th Street all the way to Rhode Island Avenue (Goods Lane) in 
the east. Eldorado is zoned as almost entirely suburban, with small areas 
of light industrial and neighborhood business. The Sheetz Headquarters 
is located in this area. At one time, this section was also known as the 
"West End" because trains leaving the south end of town head west towards 
Pittsburgh. Some parts of Eldorado are actually outside of incorporated 
Altoona and located in Allegheny Township and Logan Township. Toy Town 
is the neighborhood in between 31st and 33rd Streets and centered on Race 
Street. Lakemont is located southeast of Garden Heights between Frankstown 
Road and Logan Boulevard. While residing within Logan Township just outside 
the official border of the City and designated as the "Village of Lakemont", 
it is commonly accepted as a section of Altoona. In fact, Peoples Natural 
Gas Field the home of the Altoona Curve resides in Lakemont. Also in Lakemont 
is Lakemont Park and Galactic Ice. Lakemont is zoned as single household 
residential, residential commercial and highway business. Greenwood is 
the area north of the East End and begins around a block north of Grant 
Street. While mostly residing within Logan Township just outside the official 
border of the City and designated as the "Village of Greenwood", it is 
commonly accepted as a section of Altoona, especially since a 3 block by 
4 block zone lies within the city limits. Greenwood is zoned almost entirely 
as suburban with a section of highway business along Route 220. Greenwood 
Road is a lone exception with a more urban residential zoning. Ward Trucking's 
headquarters are located in this section of Altoona. Wehnwood is the area 
west of 25th Ave between Wehnwood Road to the north and 1st St to the south. 
This is part of where Penn State Altoona is located. Wehnwood is mostly 
zoned as suburban or single residential with an area of neighborhood business 
along 25th Ave and Juniata Gap Road. There is a fair amount of student 
housing surrounding the campus, and therefore a small pocket of urban residential 
next to it. Mansion Park is named for the Baker Mansion, one of its prominent 
houses. There are several streets surrounding the old plantation where 
mansions built in the early 20th century still stand. Mansion Park Stadium 
is also located here, which is the 10,000 seat stadium where the Altoona 
Mountain Lions play. The Mansion Park area is located east of 6th Ave, 
with Logan Blvd and Ward Ave to the south, 27th Street to the north and 
a block past Union Ave to the east. Columbia Park is the neighborhood adjacent 
to Tuckahoe Park between 6th Ave and Union Ave with Crescent Road to the 
south. The area is single and suburban residential. Highland Park is the 
area south of Logan Blvd, east of 6th Ave, north of 57th Street and west 
of Ruskin Drive. The name comes from the hill that the area is centered 
on is the only significant highland in southern Altoona. The actual Highland 
Park is located on top of the hill. Highland Park is zoned entirely suburban. 
The Knickerbockers are a unique collection of homes along 6th Ave between 
Burgoon Road to the north and 41st Street to the south. The Knickerbocker 
Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places 
in 2002.[22] This collection of extremely closely built together homes 
are a local landmark, and the Knickerbocker Tavern is one of the most popular 
bars in the area. 6th Ward is the area south of Dutch Hill, west of Pleasant 
Valley, east of Curtain Neighborhoods and north of Mansion Park. It is 
between 17th and 27th Streets north to south, and 6th Ave and Michelle 
Drive west to east. This area consists of multiple and single residential. 
There are several streets in the 6th Ward where mansions from the early 
20th century still stand. Westmont is the area on the east side of the 
tracks south of 21st street and between the 5th Ward and the tracks to 
the west and the 9th Ave tracks to the east. The area is zoned as multiple, 
single and suburban residential as well as residential commercial and light 
industrial. This is probably one of the more varied and diverse areas of 
the city architecturally. Curtin is the neighborhood where the Jaffa Mosque 
is located. As well as the Broad Avenue Historic District, which was added 
to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.[22] Hileman Heights 
is a suburban area south of Pleasant Valley. The heights are from South 
25th Street south to South 27th Street and are between Wren Ave to the 
west and Robin Ave to the east. There is also a small section of residential 
commercial. Llyswen is a small section west of Union Ave, east of Ruskin 
Drive, south of Ward Ave and north of Plank Road. This low-lying area is 
almost entirely suburban, with small areas of multiple residential, residential 
commercial, neighborhood business and highway business. The Llyswen Historic 
District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.[22] 
Garden heights is the area east of Plank Road, northwest of Lakemont and 
south of Frankstown Road. Garden Heights is mostly single residential, 
but is highway business along Plank Road, residential commercial along 
parts of Frankstown Road and Logan Blvd, and light industrial south of 
Logan Blvd. This is the only section of the defined city limits that Interstate 
99 actually passes through. Calvert Hills is a small area between 12th 
Street and 16th Street north to south and 17th Ave to the east. This is 
the area of multiple, single and suburban residential on the hills around 
the former Keith Junior High School, which is now an apartment complex. 
The 5th Ward and Westfall is the area on the west side of the tracks south 
of Calvert Hills and north of the Curtain Neighborhoods. It borders a park 
to the west also called Westfall. The northwestern corner of 5th Ward is 
known as Newburg, with Red Hill being farther north up Route 36. The boundaries 
for the southern area are 20th Street to the north and 10th Ave to the 
south. The 5th Ward is a mix of single and suburban residential. Altoona 
is a major center on the Norfolk Southern Railway's (NS) Pittsburgh Line. 
In Altoona, helper engines are added to heavy trains to give them extra 
power up and over Horseshoe Curve west of town. The Juniata Heavy Repair 
Shop Complex, originally built by the PRR, is the primary repair and maintenance 
facility on NS. On an average day, 60 to 80 trains pass though Altoona. 
The historical importance to the railroad industry and the current high 
level of railroad activity has made Altoona a mecca for railfans for over 
60 years, with the Railroaders Memorial Museum and the Horseshoe Curve 
being popular spots. Amtrak's Pennsylvanian stops at Altoona station once 
daily in each direction. Local bus service in the city is provided by AMTRAN. 
In 2007, AMTRAN customers suffered a major loss in service due to cuts 
in state funding. In May of that year, Governor Rendell visited Altoona 
to discuss plans intended to rectify this situation. Roadway service primarily 
consists of Interstate 99, which provides access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike 
to the south and Interstate 80 to the north; and U.S. Route 22, which provides 
east-west service and direct access to Pittsburgh and Harrisburg. Local 
roadways in Altoona tend to be given numerical names, and Streets are aligned 
northwest-southeast and Avenues are aligned northeast-southwest. The Altoona–Blair 
County Airport provides commercial air service for Altoona, offering daily 
flights to Pittsburgh International Airport. Historically, the sole economic 
force driving the growth of Altoona into a City was the Pennsylvania Railroad. 
While the various local railroad shops still employ over a thousand people, 
they are no longer the driving economic engine of the area. The top field 
of employment in Altoona and the metro area is healthcare. Facilities include: 
UPMC Altoona with its many local facilities that employ thousands, Healthsouth 
Rehabilitation Hospital and its several local facilities, James E. Van 
Zandt Medical Center (Veterans Hospital), dozens of doctors offices, and 
over 20 nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Another massive employer 
is retail and service industries. Altoona is the linchpin of Tri-City Region. 
Its location along I-99 draws from a large trade area over a wide geographic 
area that extends to State College and Johnstown and over 40 miles (64 km) 
south along I-99 past I-70. Altoona draws the most retail customers in 
the region due to its centralized location and to the fact that it has 
the best complementary retail of the three markets with 2,800,000 square 
feet (260,000 m2) of retail space.[23] A new shopping center, Convention 
Center Commons, is slated to open in 2015. The new shopping center will 
house a Carmike Big D Movie Theater, a Holiday Inn Express, and other stores 
and restaurants. This is expected to bring 800 jobs to the area.[24] The 
scale and diversity of retail within the City of Altoona and the surrounding 
area is not paralleled within the region. The areas of retail include: 
Altoona is the home of the Sheetz headquarters. Sheetz is one of the largest 
convenience store and gas station chains in the country, with 500 stores 
in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina. 
Approximately 20 Sheetz stores[25] are located in and around Altoona. Altoona 
and the Altoona Area are serviced by several companies for emergency services. 
Given that Altoona is entirely encompassed by Logan Township, and some 
small areas within the city are belonging to the Township, City and Township 
services often intermingle. Given the close proximity to Hollidaysburg 
and Duncansville Boroughs as well as Allegheny and Blair Townships, City, 
borough and township services will often assist or be called in place of 
each other. The Altoona Police Department (APD) services the City. APD 
is about 66 strong, and the precinct is located on 16th St downtown. Logan 
Township Police Department services all areas of Logan Township. However, 
since the Township encompasses the City, in order to be centrally located 
the precinct is located in the City on 7th Ave. LTPD is 16 strong. The 
Altoona Fire Department (AFD) supplies fire and Quick Response Service 
(QRS) to the City, as well as Haz-Mat response for Blair County. The Department 
is also a part of the IAFF, local 299. The AFD is composed of 64 line personnel, 
over 4 "tricks" (a.k.a. shifts), A, B, C, and D. Each shift works two 10-hour 
daylight shifts, then two 14-hour night shifts, followed by four days off. 
Within the city, there are five firehouses, four of which are manned 24/7. 
The fifth station is the old AMED (Altoona's Ambulance Service building) 
located across from AFD Headquarters. The department operates under the 
number 300. Like all county fire apparatus, the city still follows the 
standard unit numbering to distinguish fire engines from ladder trucks 
to fire chiefs. The AFD has 21 pieces of apparatus that service the residents 
of Altoona. Amongst these pieces of equipment are manned and reserve apparatus. 
At all times, the city maintains 4 engines, 1 ladder truck, 1 heavy-rescue 
truck, plus an assistant chief on duty. Also, all 4 main engines carry 
the AMKUS Jaws of Life equipment. The five stations are located throughout 
the city. Headquarters at Station 1 (310) is at 1319 Washington Avenue. 
This is where the department chief, deputy chief, and assistant chief are 
housed. Station 350 is across the street at the old AMED building. Station 
2 is located on N. 2nd Street and N. 6th Avenue in Juniata. Station 3 is 
located on Crawford Avenue and 6th Street in Pleasant Valley. Station 4, 
in Eldorado, is on 6th Avenue and Burgoon Road. There are also several 
Volunteer Companies located just outside the city limits on all sides. 
However, they do not run calls inside the city in tandem with the City 
Fire Department. Nearby stations include: Logan Township United (18) just 
north of Juniata, Allegheny Township (50) just south of Eldorado, Kittanning 
Trail in Eldorado (14), Newburg (12) just north of Westfall, Greenwood 
(16), Pinecroft (23), and Lakemont (15). The only times that both the AFD 
and a surrounding volunteer company will respond together on calls is for 
motor vehicle accidents on I-99 in Logan Township and for incidents on 
a stretch of E Chestnut Ave / N 4th Ave between Juniata Gap Rd and N 2nd 
St. AMED or the Altoona Mobile Emergency Department provides EMS services 
for both Altoona and Logan Township as well as many surrounding areas in 
Blair County including: Bellwood, Tyrone and Roaring Spring. AMED has several 
online and several offline ambulances on duty at the main station 430 on 
7th Ave and 10th Street as well as an additional online ambulance at 480 
in Lakemont. Altoona has many, various types of parks for a variety of 
public uses within the city limits. They range from simple green areas 
with perhaps some benches and a few swings to full athletic fields for 
the public use and enjoyment. In the early 20th century, the Pennsylvania 
Railroad constructed a large sports complex at the intersection of Chestnut 
Avenue and Seventh Street.[26] It was named Cricket Field in an attempt 
to appeal to Cricket-loving British investors. Cricket did not catch on 
with the Altoona populace, so its close relative baseball became the choice 
for Cricket Field. Well known baseball players as Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson 
played at Cricket Field, and the stadium was also the venue for numerous 
other sporting events, musical competitions, marching units, and activities.[15] 
A plaza that's home to; Wendy's, Rite Aid Pharmacy and the Pennsylvania 
State Parole & Probation, stands today on the site of Cricket Field. Altoona 
was the site of a 1.25-mile (2.01 km) board track called Altoona Speedway 
from 1923 to 1931.[27] On June 15, 1929, just two weeks after winning the 
1929 Indianapolis 500, Ray Keech was killed in an accident at the Altoona 
Speedway. Altoona Area School District's Mansion Park Stadium has long 
been recognized as one of the finest athletic complexes in Pennsylvania. 
The stadium, which has a seating capacity of 10,400, is a source of community 
pride and regularly serves as the site of a variety of events which benefit 
the economy of the Altoona-Blair County area. In the summer of 2009, Sports 
Construction Group, LLC installed "Trophy Turf," which has a 48-ounce face 
weight and inlaid football and soccer lines. Mansion Park's first artificial 
surface was installed in 1989. Omniturf provided a way to maximize the 
use of the facility throughout the year and at the same time, save taxpayer 
dollars through reduced maintenance costs. AstroTurf 12-2000 was installed 
in 1999. The eight-lane polyurethane running track was installed in 1989 
and has been resurfaced several times. For 22 consecutive seasons, the 
playing surface has received rave reviews from players and coaches as athletes 
have experienced controlled footing regardless of the weather conditions. 
Most importantly, there has been a significant decrease in serious injuries 
since the artificial turf was installed. During a typical fall season, 
more than 60 events take place on the turf. Altoona High varsity and junior 
varsity teams, Altoona Area Junior High School ninth grade teams, and Bishop 
Guilfoyle High School all play home football games at Mansion Park. The 
stadium is also the site of AAHS boys and girls soccer matches and countless 
practice sessions. District and interdistrict football and soccer playoffs 
are held each year at Mansion Park, the home of the PIAA Football Championships 
from 1992 through 1997. The Pennsylvania Scholastic Football Coaches Association 
East West High School All Star Game was played at Mansion Park from 2001 
to 2010. Numerous high school and junior high school track meets, including 
the District 6 Class AA and AAA championships and the West Central Coaches 
Meet, are held at the stadium each spring. The track is also used extensively 
on a daily basis by hundreds of community residents who enjoy walking and 
jogging. Mansion Park has also been the site of a 1992 Pittsburgh Steeler 
intrasquad scrimmage, the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference men's 
and women's college soccer championships, University of Pittsburgh preseason 
football practices and the 1995 PIAA Soccer Championships. Music events 
have also been well received. Appearances by The Beach Boys, Up With People, 
the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, the Penn State Blue Band, 
the Ohio State Pride of the Buckeyes Band, the University of Notre Dame 
Band of the Fighting Irish, the University of Illinois Marching Illini 
and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Marching Band have attracted 
huge crowds. Drum Corps International competitions were held in 1998 and 
again in 2000. Altoona Area High School's Commencement is scheduled at 
the stadium each year. Mansion Park is also the home of the American Cancer 
Society's Relay For Life. In early 2010, a new scoreboard featuring a video 
display board with an improved stadium sound system was erected thanks 
to the generosity of local sponsors.[28] Altoona has an education system 
that contains three high schools, two parochial, one public. Bishop Guilfoyle 
High School is one of the private parochial school having grades 9–12, 
located at 2400 Pleasant Valley. Blvd. Great Commission Schools is the 
second private parochial school having grades K–12, located at 1100 6th 
Ave. Altoona Area High School[29] houses grades 10–12, and is located at 
1415 6th Ave. Altoona High is much larger than Bishop Guilfoyle, graduating 
around 600 students annually, while Guilfoyle graduates around 100. Most 
athletic teams at Bishop Guilfoyle are the smallest classification within 
the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA), which is 
Class single A. In contrast, those at Altoona Area High School are the 
largest classification within the PIAA, which is AAAA. These high schools 
occasionally compete against each other in basketball, volleyball, tennis, 
cross country and softball. It also contained two junior high schools, 
named D.S. Keith Junior High and Theodore Roosevelt Junior High, but both 
closed and merged in 2008 to become the Altoona Area Junior High School. 
Roosevelt was torn down and the ground on which it stood was constructed 
into the new field for the new junior high. Keith, however, was turned 
into residential apartments. Altoona is the location of the Pennsylvania 
State University, Ivyside Park campus, also known as Penn State Altoona. 
This is the third largest of the Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth 
campuses. The college has approximately 3,903 students as of the 2014–15 
school year.[30] Altoona also has several technical schools. The Greater 
Altoona Career and Technology Center (GACTC) is located on 16th Street 
next to the high school and offers a variety of technical classes for both 
Junior High and High School students throughout Blair County, as well as 
high school graduates seeking a technical degree. YTI Career Institute 
has a campus in Logan Hills on Fairway Drive. South Hills Business School 
has a campus located on 58th Street. The Altoona television market is part 
of the regional Johnstown/Altoona/State College market. As of the 2010
