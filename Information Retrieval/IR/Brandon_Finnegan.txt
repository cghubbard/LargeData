Brandon Kyle Finnegan (born April 14, 1993) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He has also played in MLB for the Kansas City Royals. Prior to his professional 
career, Finnegan attended Texas Christian University (TCU) and played college 
baseball for the TCU Horned Frogs baseball team. He was drafted by the 
Royals in the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft, and made his MLB debut 
that season. The Royals traded Finnegan to the Reds during the 2015 season. 
Finnegan attended Southwest High School in Fort Worth, Texas. He was drafted 
by the Texas Rangers in the 45th round of the 2011 Major League Baseball 
Draft, but did not sign and attended Texas Christian University (TCU).[1] 
As a freshman in 2012, he pitched in 23 games with 11 starts. He finished 
the season 4–5 with a 3.47 earned run average (ERA) with 56 strikeouts 
in 62 1⁄3 innings. As a sophomore in 2013 he pitched in 16 games with 15 
starts, going 0–8 but with a 3.18 ERA and 86 strikeouts in 79 1⁄3 innings. 
During the summer he pitched for the United States collegiate national 
team.[2][3] After not winning a game during his sophomore season, he earned 
a victory in his first start of his junior season in 2014.[4] During the 
season he missed a few starts due to a minor injury.[5][6] He finished 
the year 9–3 with a 2.04 ERA and 134 strikeouts in 105 2⁄3 innings. Finnegan 
was considered a top prospect for the 2014 Major League Baseball Draft.[7] 
The Kansas City Royals selected Finnegan in the first round, 17th overall, 
of the draft.[8] He signed with the team on June 28.[9] Finnegan was called 
up to the majors for the first time on September 1, 2014 becoming the first 
player from the 2014 Draft to be promoted to the majors.[10] He made his 
major league debut on September 6 against the New York Yankees. He earned 
his first major league hold on September 22 by pitching a scoreless seventh 
inning against the Cleveland Indians. He made his MLB postseason debut 
in the American League Wild Card game vs the Oakland Athletics on September 
30, 2014. He pitched 2 1⁄3 innings, allowing one earned run while striking 
out three in the extra innings victory.[citation needed] On October 3, 
2014, in the second game of the 2014 American League Division Series, Finnegan 
came in relief and picked up the 4-1 win, becoming the youngest relief 
pitcher in Royals postseason history to log a win.[11] Finnegan became 
the first player to play in a College World Series and an MLB World Series 
in the same year when he took the mound in the seventh inning of Game 3 
of the 2014 World Series against the San Francisco Giants.[12] Finnegan 
took the loss in Game 4, allowing five runs in one inning of work.[13] 
In 2015, Finnegan began the season with the Omaha Storm Chasers of the 
Class AAA Pacific Coast League, working as a starting pitcher.[14] During 
the season, the Royals promoted him to the major leagues, shifting him 
between the starting rotation and bullpen.[15] On July 26, 2015, Finnegan 
was traded to the Cincinnati Reds, along with John Lamb and Cody Reed, 
for Johnny Cueto and cash considerations.[16] He pitched for the Louisville 
Bats of the Class AAA International League as a starting pitcher, and was 
promoted to the Reds on September 1 as a relief pitcher.[15] Although he 
was traded from the 2015 World Series Champion Kansas City Royals, Finnegan 
was awarded a World Series ring for his contributions before the trade. 
Finnegan began the 2016 season pitching out of the rotation for Cincinnati, 
opening as the teams second starter behind Raisel Iglesias due to a plethora 
of injuries. In 5 starts in April, Finnegan went 1–1 with a 3.86 ERA, striking 
out 23 and walking 15 in 28 innings. In 6 starts in May, Finnegan went 
0–3 with a 4.37 ERA, striking out 21 and walking 16 in 35 innings. However, 
in one of his losses, Finnegan threw a complete 8 innings against the Dodgers, 
giving up one run and losing to Clayton Kershaw's two-hit shutout.[17]
