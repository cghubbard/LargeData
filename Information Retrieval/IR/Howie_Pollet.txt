Howard Joseph Pollet (June 26, 1921 – August 8, 1974) was an American left-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball during the 1940s and 1950s. A three-time 
All-Star in 1943, 1946 and 1949, he twice led the National League in earned 
run average (1.75 in 1943 and 2.10 in 1946). Born in New Orleans, Pollet 
signed his first professional contract with the St. Louis Cardinals, and 
it was as a Cardinal that he achieved his greatest success. In 1941, he 
won 20 of 23 decisions and led the Class A1 Texas League in ERA (1.16) 
and strikeouts (151) as a member of the Houston Buffaloes. This performance 
earned Pollet a promotion to the Cards that season: as a rookie, he won 
5 and lost 2, with an ERA of 1.93. He missed the 1944–45 seasons while 
serving in the United States Army Air Forces in the Pacific Theater of 
Operations during World War II.[1] Pollet returned to baseball in 1946, 
and promptly played a major role in the Redbirds' National League pennant 
and world title. In addition to topping the NL in earned-run average, he 
led the league in wins (21) (losing ten) and innings pitched (266). When 
the Cardinals finished in a tie for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers 
at the close of the regular season, he was chosen by manager Eddie Dyer 
to start Game 1 of the best-of-three National League playoff on October 
1. Pollet hurled a complete game, 4–2 victory in the opener, and the Cardinals 
wrapped up the league title by easily winning Game 2 behind Murry Dickson. 
Pollet started two games of the 1946 World Series against the Boston Red 
Sox, and lost his only decision, posting an ERA of 3.48 in 12⅓ innings 
pitched. Pollet's other outstanding season came in 1949, when he posted 
a 20–9 mark and led the NL in shutouts with five. That year, however, St. 
Louis finished second to Brooklyn by one game. He was traded to the second-division 
Pittsburgh Pirates on June 15, 1951, and thereafter struggled to post a 
winning record. During his 14-year career, he won 131 and lost 116 (.530) 
with a career ERA of 3.51. As a Cardinal (1941–43; 1946–51), his record 
was 97–65; as a member of the Pirates, Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox 
(1951–56), he won 34 and lost 51. Altogether, he worked in 403 Major League 
games pitched and 2,107⅓ innings pitched; he gave up 2,096 hits and 745 
bases on balls with 934 strikeouts. Pollet returned to the field in 1959 
as the Cardinals' pitching coach, serving through 1964. In his last season 
there, the Cards won their seventh world championship. He then moved back 
to his adopted city of Houston in 1965, serving as pitching coach of the 
Astros for one season. Pollet was a business partner of his former manager, 
Dyer, in insurance, real estate and energy companies in Houston. He retired 
from baseball and resumed his business career after the 1965 season, and
