The Boston Red Sox' 2008 season began on March 25, 2008 in Tokyo, Japan 
for the MLB Japan Opening Day 2008. The Red Sox were attempting to become 
the first repeat World Series Champions since the 1999–2000 New York Yankees 
and also be the first repeat Champions of the 21st century. They also tried 
to become World Series Champions three times in five years. At the 2008 
MLB All Star Game, 7 Red Sox players were selected. The Red Sox clinched 
a spot in the American League Division Series with their 5–4 win over the 
Cleveland Indians. On September 28, the Red Sox officially retired Johnny 
Pesky's number 6 jersey. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim in the ALDS. Jed Lowrie of the Boston Red Sox became the fourth 
rookie in MLB history to end a postseason series by a walk-off hit.[1] 
They then took the Tampa Bay Rays to a seven-game ALCS but were beaten 
3–1 in Game 7 on October 19. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: G =
