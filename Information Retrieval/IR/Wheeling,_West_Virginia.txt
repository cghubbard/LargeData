Wheeling is a city in Ohio County in the U.S. state of West Virginia. Located 
almost entirely in Ohio County, of which it is the county seat,[5] it lies 
along the Ohio River in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Wheeling 
was originally a settlement in the British colony of Virginia and later 
an important city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Wheeling was the first 
state capital of West Virginia. Due to its location along major transportation 
routes, including the Ohio River, National Road, and the B&O Railroad, 
Wheeling became a manufacturing center in the late nineteenth century. 
After experiencing the closing of factories and substantial population 
loss following World War II, Wheeling's major industries now include healthcare, 
education, law and legal services, entertainment and tourism, and energy. 
Wheeling is the principal city of the Wheeling Metropolitan Statistical 
Area. As of the 2010 census, the Wheeling, WV MSA had a population of 147,950, 
and the city had a population of 28,486. The origins of the name "Wheeling" 
are disputed. One of the more credible explanations is that the word comes 
from the Lenni-Lenape phrase wih link, which meant "place of the head." 
This supposedly referred to a white settler who was scalped and decapitated. 
His severed head was displayed at the confluence of Wheeling Creek and 
the Ohio River.[6] The area had been inhabited by Native Americans for 
thousands of years. In the 17th century, the Iroquois from present-day 
New York state conquered the upper Ohio Valley, pushing out other tribes 
and maintaining the area as their hunting ground. Originally explored by 
the French, Wheeling still has a lead plate remnant buried by the explorer 
Céloron de Blainville in 1749 at the mouth of Wheeling Creek to mark their 
claim. Later, Christopher Gist and George Washington surveyed the land, 
in 1751 and 1770, respectively.[7] During the fall of 1769, Ebenezer Zane 
explored the Wheeling area and established claim to the land via "tomahawk 
rights." (This process meant to deaden a few trees near the head of a spring, 
and mark the bark with the initials of the name of the person who made 
the claim). He returned the following spring with his wife Elizabeth and 
his younger brothers, Jonathan and Silas; they established the first permanent 
European settlement in the Wheeling area, naming it Zanesburg. Other families 
joined the settlement, including the Shepherds (see Monument Place), the 
Wetzels, and the McCollochs (see McColloch's Leap). In 1787, the United 
States gave Virginia this portion of lands west of the Appalachians, and 
some to Pennsylvania at its western edge, to settle their claims. By the 
Northwest Ordinance that year, it established the Northwest Territory to 
cover other lands north of the Ohio River and west to the Mississippi River. 
Settlers began to move into new areas along the Ohio. In 1793, Ebenezer 
Zane divided the town into lots, and Wheeling was officially established 
as a town in 1795 by legislative enactment. The town was incorporated January 
16, 1805. On March 11, 1836, the town of Wheeling was incorporated into 
the city of Wheeling. By an act of the Virginia General Assembly on December 
27, 1797, Wheeling was named the county seat of Ohio County.[8] Originally 
dubbed Fort Fincastle in 1774, the fort was later renamed Fort Henry in 
honor of Virginia's American governor, Patrick Henry. In 1777, Native Americans 
of the Shawnee, Wyandot and Mingo tribes joined to attack pioneer settlements 
along the upper Ohio River, which were illegal according to the Crown's 
Proclamation of 1763. They hoped an alliance with the British would drive 
the colonial settlers out of their territory. Local men, later joined by 
recruits from Fort Shepherd (in Elm Grove) and Fort Holliday, defended 
the fort. The native force burned the surrounding cabins and destroyed 
livestock. During the first attack of the year, Major Samuel McColloch 
led a small force of men from Fort Vanmetre along Short Creek to assist 
the besieged Fort Henry. Separated from his men, McColloch was chased by 
attacking Indians. Upon his horse, McColloch charged up Wheeling Hill and 
made what is known as McColloch's Leap 300 feet (91 m) down its eastern 
side. In 1782, a native army along with British soldiers attempted to take 
Fort Henry. During this siege, Fort Henry's supply of ammunition was exhausted. 
The defenders decided to dispatch a man to secure more ammunition from 
the Zane homestead. Betty Zane volunteered for the dangerous task. During 
her departing run, she was heckled by both native and British soldiers. 
After reaching the Zane homestead, she gathered a tablecloth and filled 
it with gunpowder. During her return, she was fired upon but was uninjured. 
As a result of her heroism, Fort Henry remained in American control.[8] 
The National Road arrived in Wheeling in 1818, linking the Ohio River to 
the Potomac River, and allowing goods from the Ohio Valley to flow through 
Wheeling and on to points east. As the endpoint of National Road, Wheeling 
became a gateway to early western expansion. In 1849 the Wheeling Suspension 
Bridge crossed the Ohio River and allowed the city to expand onto Wheeling 
Island. Lessons learned constructing the bridge were used in the construction 
of the Brooklyn Bridge. Rail transportation reached Wheeling in 1853 when 
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad connected Wheeling to Pennsylvania, Maryland 
and markets in the Northeast. A bridge over the river connected it to Bellaire, 
Ohio and western areas. Much of this area had been settled by yeomen farmers, 
few of whom owned slaves. With the railroad, a larger industrial or mercantile 
middle-class developed that depended on free labor; it either felt disinterest 
or hostility to slavery. The Wheeling Intelligencer newspaper expressed 
the area's anti-secession sentiment as tensions rose over slavery and national 
issues. The city became part of the movement of western areas to secede 
from Virginia after the beginning of the Civil War. It was the location 
of the aforementioned Wheeling Convention.[9] It served as the provisional 
capital of the Restored Government of Virginia from 1861 to 1863, and became 
the first capital of West Virginia after it seceded from Virginia and was 
admitted to the Union in its own right in 1863. The growing German population, 
which included immigrants after the 1848 Revolutions, was firmly anti-slavery. 
The Germans of Wheeling organized the "First West Virginia Artillery" to 
oppose the Confederacy and played a role in the initial movement to separate 
from Virginia.[10] The Germans' culture influenced the city, such as their 
"German Singing Societies," the first of which began in 1855.[11] Although 
Wheeling lost its position as capital in 1865, it continued to grow. In 
the late nineteenth century, it served as a prime industrial center for 
the state. Noted businesses of the era included the Bloch Brothers Tobacco 
Company and steel concerns.[12] As it grew, prosperous residents built 
an area of fine housing around Wheeling Island, but slums also grew.[13] 
With industry, Wheeling reached its peak of population in 1930. The Great 
Depression, and later changes and restructuring in heavy industry following 
World War II, led to a loss of working-class jobs and population. Capitalizing 
on its rich architectural heritage, Wheeling has worked to revive its main 
street and heritage tourism activities near the Ohio River. In addition, 
West Virginia has constructed fiber optics networks for advanced communication. 
Wheeling is becoming a center in health services and education as well.

of the Ohio River, and on an island in the middle of the river called Wheeling 
Island. Wheeling lies on the transitional climate zone between the humid 
subtropical climate and the humid continental climate (Köppen: Cfa/Dfa,

cities may adopt the Manager-Mayor Plan. The elected mayor presides over 
meetings of the Wheeling City Council, which has six members elected from 
geographic wards. City Council members serve four-year terms. The City 
Council also confirms executive nominations for members to various boards 
which have limited regulatory authority, including the Planning Commission, 
the Board of Zoning Appeals, and the Traffic Commission.[19] The City Manager 
serves as Chief Executive and Administrative officer for the city.[20] 
The current Mayor of Wheeling is Glenn Elliott, and the current City Manager 
of Wheeling is Robert Herron. The current members of City Council are Vice-Mayor 
Chad Thalman (1st Ward), Ken Imer (2nd Ward), Brian Wilson (3rd Ward), 
Wendy Scatterday (4th Ward), Ty Thorngate (5th Ward), and Dave Palmer (6th 
Ward).[19] City elections were held on May 10, 2016, and the current term 
began on July 1, 2016. City elections will be held again on May 12, 2020. 
The city of Wheeling has a rich and varied history. West Virginia Independence 
Hall was the site of the Wheeling Convention, two meetings held in 1861 
that ultimately reversed Virginia's Ordinance of Secession. Twenty-six 
counties in Virginia's north and west voted against secession from the 
Union and created the new state of West Virginia, which the United States 
quickly admitted. Later in 1861 and continuing to 1863, the building was 
the site of many heated debates during the First Constitutional Convention 
of West Virginia[21] including the name of the new state.[22] Wheeling 
is home to Centre Market, formerly Wheeling's market house. Built in 1853,[23] 
the market house and the surrounding area have been adapted for use as 
retail shops and restaurants. The first official memorial monument in the 
state of West Virginia, dedicated specifically to men killed in the Vietnam 
War, was dedicated in Wheeling, with full military honors, in a Memorial 
Day 1986 ceremony. The monument was erected in front of the flagpole near 
the main shelter of Bethlehem Community Park in the village of Bethlehem, 
just southeast of Wheeling. The roughly 6 foot tall granite memorial consists 
of a large, bronze dedication plaque with the names of KIAs from the Wheeling/Ohio 
County region. Below the dedication plaque is a bronze map of South Vietnam, 
complete with names of 28 major cities. Wheeling features several municipal 
parks including Oglebay Resort & Conference Center and Wheeling Park. Ohio 
County has six golf courses, including designs by renowned golfer Arnold 
Palmer and architect Robert Trent Jones. The Wheeling Suspension Bridge, 
which was once the longest suspension bridge in the world, connects downtown 
Wheeling to Wheeling Island. In October 2007 the City of Wheeling opened 
the state's first concrete skateboard park. The 12,000-square-foot (1,100 m2) 
facility was designed and built by world-renowned skatepark builder, Grindline, 
of Seattle, Washington. The park consists of 60% bowls and 40% street elements; 
it is located within the Chambers Ballfield Complex in the Elm Grove section 
of the City. An addition to the street section of the park was completed 
by Grindline in November 2009. A covered shelter, restrooms, and webcam 
are scheduled to be installed in early 2010. The park is lighted and open 
24/7. As elsewhere in West Virginia, K–12 schools are organized at the 
county level of government. The public school system, Ohio County Schools, 
consists of 14 schools: nine elementary schools, four middle schools, which 
include Triadelphia Middle which has been nominated for the blue ribbon 
school award; and the nationally recognized Wheeling Park High School. 
Several parochial and private schools, including Wheeling Central Catholic 
High School and the Linsly School, are located in the city. Wheeling is 
the hub of higher education in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia. 
Wheeling Jesuit University, a private Jesuit university and the only Catholic 
college in the state of West Virginia, is located here.[24] The main campus 
of West Virginia Northern Community College has recently been expanding 
with centers in downtown Wheeling; it focuses on job training and community 
development. Also located within close proximity to the city are West Liberty 
University (formerly West Liberty State College), a four-year university, 
and private Bethany College, giving area residents a wide variety of educational 
options. Wheeling has a long tradition of live musical performance and 
radio broadcasting. With over 2,500 seats, The Capitol Theatre is the largest 
theatre in West Virginia. Opened in 1928, The Capitol was home to It's 
Wheeling Steel, a popular radio program in the early forties featuring 
musical performances by workers at a local steel plant. The Capitol has 
welcomed musical performances of all types, from Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, 
and Tammy Wynette, to Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, B.B. King and Black Sabbath. 
Other past performers include Jerry Seinfeld, David Copperfield, and George 
Carlin. The Wheeling Symphony Orchestra is housed at the Capitol Theatre 
and performs a range of contemporary, classical, and seasonal arrangements. 
Wheeling is also home to the Victoria Theater, the oldest theater in West 
Virginia. The 700-seat Victorian-style theater served as home to the WWVA 
Jamboree program from 1933–1936. More recently, it has been the site for 
the "Wheeling Jamboree", a local initiative started in 2009 and modeled 
after the original WWVA Jamboree (which changed its name in the 1960s to 
Jamboree U.S.A.). The original WWVA Jamboree ran from 1933–2007, making 
it the second longest running country radio program and a variety show 
in the country after the "Grand Ole Opry" in Nashville, Tennessee. Live 
music echoes from the amphitheatre at the Wheeling Heritage Port several 
nights per week from mid-Spring through late-Fall. The waterfront park 
area hosts numerous festivals, concerts, movie nights, celebrations, a 
regatta and numerous visits from the Delta, Mississippi and American Queen 
riverboats. The Port holds over 8,000 spectators and has become a focal 
point to the City. Held in nearby Belmont County, Ohio Jamboree In The 
Hills draws over 100,000 country music fans to the Wheeling area every 
July. Fans of theater have several options in Wheeling. The Capitol Theatre 
hosts numerous touring musical performances. In addition, the Oglebay Institute's 
Towngate Theatre in Center Wheeling has, for over 35 years, produced plays.[25] 
Wheeling is home to the Wheeling Nailers hockey team. The Nailers play 
in the WesBanco Arena (formerly the Wheeling Civic Center), and participate 
in the North division, American Conference of the ECHL. High school football 
and soccer are played at Wheeling Island Stadium. Formerly home to the 
Ohio Valley Greyhounds, Wheeling became home to a second team in 2009.[26] 
The team, known as the Wheeling Wildcats, played in the Continental Indoor 
Football League but folded after the 2009 season.[27] Wheeling is also 
home to the headquarters of the Mountain East Conference, a NCAA Division 
II conference that launched in the 2013–14 school year. Wheeling Jesuit 
and West Liberty are both charter members of the new conference, an offshoot 
of the disbanding West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Wheeling 
is the home of Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack located on Wheeling 
Island. Formerly known as Wheeling Downs, the facility features live greyhound 
racing, slots, poker games, and casino-style table games. In accordance 
with House Bill 271 adopted on March 8, 2007, Ohio County and Jefferson 
County held special elections on June 9, 2007, to approve the legalization 
of table games within the respective counties. The Ohio County measure 
passed, but the Jefferson County one failed. A similar measure was successfully 
adopted in Hancock County on June 30, 2007.[28] Due to its close proximity 
to Pittsburgh, Wheeling is heavily influenced by that city's broadcast 
media outlets, which are easily received in the area. Besides broadcast 
stations Wheeling's cable providers also carry Root Sports Pittsburgh and 
the Pittsburgh-centric news/talk channel PCNC as its "home" sports and 
information sources. In addition to the Pittsburgh outlets, the Wheeling 
television market is served by CBS affiliate WTRF-TV Channel 7, PBS affiliate 
W41AA Channel 41, and NBC affiliate WTOV-TV Channel 9 in nearby Steubenville, 
Ohio. The city is served by cable television provider Comcast and parts 
of the city are also served by Centre TV. Wheeling is home to WWVA 1170 
AM, the state's only 50,000-watt AM station that can be heard throughout 
the East Coast at night. WVLY 1370 AM and WKKX 1600 AM provide local news, 
sports, and talk. On the FM dial, WVKF 95.7, WKWK 97.3, WOVK 98.7 and WEGW 
107.5 provide the area with various music genres. The Wheeling area is 
the home of WDUQ-LP, a listener-supported commercial-free station, which 
also serves as the local Pacifica affiliate. Pittsburgh's radio stations 
provide Wheeling with coverage. A number of translators and repeater stations 
provide NPR and American Family Radio networks. Wheeling also has a student-run 
radio station, WPHP 91.9, operated by Wheeling Park High School students. 
WPHP plays top 40 songs and also covers all of the Wheeling Park Patriots' 
football and basketball games. The city is home to The Intelligencer and 
Wheeling News-Register newspapers. Both papers are owned by Ogden Newspapers 
Inc., based in Wheeling. The Intelligencer is published weekday mornings 
and Saturdays, while the News-Register is published weekday afternoons 
and Sundays. The Times-Leader of Martins Ferry, Ohio, another Ogden Newspapers 
Inc. paper, also covers Wheeling issues. In Wheeling magazine is published 
quarterly and covers society and events in the city.[29] Two local websites, 
Weelunk and Dateline: Wheeling, serve as independent news sources for the 
city.[30][31] Interstate 70 and its spur Interstate 470 run through the 
city east-west and link it with suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the 
east and Ohio to the west. U.S. Route 40/National Road links downtown with 
residential neighborhoods to the east. West Virginia Route 2 connects Wheeling 
with Moundsville to the south and Weirton to the north. U.S. Route 250 
also runs through the city. The Fort Henry Bridge and Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial Bridge carry I-70 and I-470 respectively over the Ohio River. 
The historic Wheeling Suspension Bridge, completed in 1849, which was part 
of National Road (see early pic.), now carries cars and light trucks as 
well as pedestrian traffic between downtown and Wheeling Island. I-70 passes 
under Wheeling Hill through the Wheeling Tunnel. Bus transportation to 
points throughout North America is available from Wheeling through Greyhound 
Lines. The bus terminal, the Robert C. Byrd Intermodal Transportation Center, 
was built with $11.1 million in federal funds.[32] Regional transportation 
through West Virginia and Eastern Ohio is provided by the East Ohio and 
Ohio Valley Regional Transit Authorities, which shares the Intermodal Transportation 
Center as its hub for its Hub-and-Spoke routes throughout the area.[33] 
Wheeling once operated streetcars from the 1880s to 1943 under the Wheeling 
Traction Company and Co-operative Transit Company. Buses replaced streetcar 
operations due to operating costs.[34] The city is served by the Wheeling 
Ohio County Airport for general aviation and Pittsburgh International Airport
