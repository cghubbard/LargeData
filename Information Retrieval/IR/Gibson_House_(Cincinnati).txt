The Gibson House was a well-known and well-regarded hotel, the precursor 
of the Hotel Gibson. The Gibson House was located on Main St. between 4th 
& 5th (south of Fountain Square) until the 1970s. The Gibson House was 
opened about February 1849 on Walnut Street between Fourth and Fifth Street, 
on the west side of the street, in Cincinnati, OH. The first proprietors 
were J.K. and D.V. Bennett.[1] It was considered the "best house in the 
city"[2][3] within a year. The hotel was financed by Peter Gibson, a Scottish 
immigrant who was born October 20, 1802, and emigrated to America in 1831. 
Many wall decorations and frescoes were painted by the artist William A. 
Thien, who lived in Cincinnati for a time.[4] During World War II, Gibson 
House was used as an internment camp for German-Americans.[5] During the 
first season of professional baseball, on several occasions the fans would 
meet the Cincinnati Red Stockings baseball team and escort them to the 
Gibson House where celebrations and banquets were held.[6] The House was 
often used to greet VIPs who visited Cincinnati, such as Rutherford B. 
Hayes, who visited Cincinnati September 15, 1877.[7] Coordinates: 39°06′02″N
