The 1967 Los Angeles Dodgers season marked the end of the franchise's most 
successful era on the ballpark. One season after losing the World Series 
to the Baltimore Orioles, the Dodgers declined to a record of 73–89, and 
finished ahead of only the Houston Astros and the New York Mets in the 
National League race, 28½ games behind the NL and World Champion St. Louis 
Cardinals. It was the Dodgers’ worst record since the war-affected 1944 
season, and their worst peacetime record since 1937. The Dodgers would 
not return to the postseason until 1974. Infielders Other batters Coaches 
The Dodgers were coming off back to back National League titles, but were 
stunned by ace pitcher Sandy Koufax's retirement after the 1966 season. 
Still, while not expected to be a contender in 1967, there was a solid 
nucleus that would have been expected to win in the neighborhood of 85 
games. However, a couple of questionable trades (Tommy Davis for Ron Hunt, 
and Maury Wills for Bob Bailey and Gene Michael) further weakened an offense 
that was already considered below average. In May, leading hitter and team 
home run leader Lou Johnson was injured sliding into home against the Braves 
and missed two months of the season. New shortstop Gene Michael batted 
.202, a full 100 points less than the man he replaced, as Maury Wills batted 
.302 for the Pirates. Ron Fairly, Willie Davis, and Bob Bailey all slumped 
off from their 1966 production; but one of the few bright spots was rookie 
Al Ferrara's .277 average and 16 home runs in just over half the season. 
Ultimately, the Dodgers scored fewer runs than any National League team 
except the last place Mets. Despite the loss of Koufax, the pitching was 
generally solid, but the starters' won-loss records suffered from lack 
of run support despite solid ERAs. Rookie Bill Singer was 12–8 with a 2.64 
ERA, Don Drysdale was 13–16 with a 2.74 ERA, and Claude Osteen was 17–17 
with a 3.22 ERA. Don Sutton suffered from a "sophomore jinx", as he went 
11–15 with a 3.95 ERA, nearly a full run higher than his 2.99 ERA in 1966. 
The bull pen was led by Ron Perranoski, Jim Brewer, and Phil Regan, who 
combined for 23 saves and all had an ERA under 3. The Dodgers lost 10 of 
their first 16 games and never got closer than 7 games out of 1st place. 
They were never able to top the .500 mark, and while they were a respectable 
42–39 at home, they were a dismal 31–50 on the road. Note: Pos = Position;

year of a Major League Baseball Draft. The Dodgers drafted 87 players in 
the June draft and 9 in the January draft. The top draft pick was third 
baseman Donnie Denbow from Southern Methodist University. He played in 
the Dodgers farm system through 1970. In 177 games in the rookie leagues 
and Class-A, he hit .242. Of this years draft class, only catcher Steve 
Yeager, drafted in the fourth round, made any impact in the Majors. He 
played with the Dodgers from 1972–1985 and hit 102 home runs during his
