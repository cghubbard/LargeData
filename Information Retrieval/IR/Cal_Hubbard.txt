Robert Calvin Hubbard (October 31, 1900 – October 17, 1977) was a professional 
American football player and Major League Baseball (MLB) umpire. After 
playing football at Centenary College and Geneva College, Hubbard played 
in the National Football League (NFL) between 1927 and 1936 for the New 
York Giants, Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Pirates, playing the bulk 
of his career with the Packers.[3] Hubbard is credited as being one of 
the inventors of the football position of linebacker.[4] He was also an 
umpire in the American League (AL) from 1936 to 1951, then worked as an 
umpire supervisor until 1969. George Halas affectionately called Hubbard 
the "Big Umpire."[5] To date Hubbard is the only person to be enshrined 
in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Baseball Hall of Fame. He 
is also a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Cal Hubbard was 
born in Keytesville, Missouri to parents Robert P. and Sarah "Sallie" (Ford) 
Hubbard.[6] He grew up in modest means as the son of a small family farmer. 
Cal graduated from Keytesville High School, but because the school had 
no football team he also attended one year at Glasgow High School in nearby 
Glasgow, Missouri, which did offer football.[6] Already tall and weighing 
200 pounds as a 14-year-old, Hubbard displayed natural athletic gifts. 
He aspired to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, 
New York; however a physical discovered he had flat feet, eliminating him 
from eligibility.[6] From an early age Hubbard was involved with sports. 
He umpired pickup baseball games at the age of 18.[7] Hubbard chose to 
attend a college or university that offered football, selecting Chillicothe 
Business College in Chillicothe, Missouri[6] while also continuing to work 
around his family farm.[4] A chance meeting in 1922 with Bo McMillin, the 
new football coach at Centenary College in Shreveport, Louisiana, led Hubbard 
to enroll and play football there from 1922 to 1924.[6] Hubbard was the 
school's first All-American.[8] Georgia Tech coach Bill Alexander once 
watched Centenary when it was in town to play Oglethorpe. "Bo, this Oglethorpe 
bunch has fast backs, but the line is light and green. If you turn that 
Hubbard loose, he might kill some of them. Have Cal 'hurt his knee', why 
don't you, and let him sit on the bench?"[9] When McMillin moved on to 
suburban Pittsburgh's Geneva College, Hubbard followed him and played there 
in 1926 (after a year of ineligibility for switching schools in 1925). 
Geneva opened the season with an upset of Harvard.[10] In an era when 6-foot 
players were considered tall, Hubbard was noted for remarkable speed for 
a player of his size, listed officially at 6-foot-2, 253 pounds but as 
high as 6-foot-5 in Packers' sources.[3] He starred as a tackle and end, 
playing off the 7-man line in a style similar to that of a modern linebacker.[11] 
Hubbard completed his college education in 1927, earning a Bachelor of 
Arts degree from Geneva College.[6] Hubbard moved on to the National Football 
League in 1927, signing with the New York Giants for a salary of US$150 
per game.[3] Playing alongside Steve Owen his rookie year, he helped the 
Giants defense allow opponents to score just twenty total points all season 
as they won the league championship.[12] For his efforts Hubbard won all-league 
honors by the press the following year. But with a lifelong dislike for 
big cities, he didn't feel comfortable in New York and a 1928 road game 
in Green Bay led him to request a trade to the Packers, threatening to 
retire otherwise.[3] Under Packers coach Curly Lambeau, Hubbard and the 
team won the NFL title in each of his first three years there (1929–1931). 
The 1929 team surrendered just 22 points. Lambeau had Hubbard play in the 
line, ending his "linebacker" days.[2] The NFL named its first official 
All-League team in 1931 with Cal Hubbard being one of that inaugural list. 
He was chosen for the honor again in 1932 and 1933.[3] Mel Hein said Hubbard 
was "probably the greatest tackle I ever played against."[13] Once while 
playing the Chicago Bears with Ukrainian fullback Bronko Nagurski, the 
Bears prepared to punt. Hubbard went to the halfback Red Grange and said: 
"I promise not to try to block the kick, Red, but get out of the way so 
I can get a shot at that Polack." "Grange, glad not to try to block Hubbard 
for once, obliged. Cal tore through the line, slammed into Nagurski and 
bounced off. Rising slowly, he turned to Grange and said: "Hey, Red, don't 
do me any more favors."[5] Hubbard stepped away from professional football 
following the 1933 season, taking a job as the line coach at Texas A&M 
in 1934.[14] However, he was persuaded to return to play after that one 
year on the sidelines, returning to Green Bay in 1935. The Giants wooed 
him back to start 1936 with them, but he played only six games the entire 
season, five for the Giants and a final game for the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
the future Steelers.[3] Hubbard returned to football coaching briefly, 
serving as head coach of his alma mater Geneva College in 1941 and 1942.[6] 
He was among the initial class of inductees to the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame in 1963. In a 1969 poll by the Hall of Fame committee, Hubbard was 
voted the NFL's greatest tackle of all-time.[4] Even while Hubbard's football 
career was going full-force, he began to focus on a second career in baseball 
officiating. From 1928 onward he spent his football off-season umpiring 
in minor league baseball.[6] By 1936 Hubbard had been called up to the 
major leagues, umpiring in the American League from 1936 to 1951, a contemporary 
with the likes of Yogi Berra.[5] Soon recognized as one of the game's best 
officials, he was selected to work in the 1938 World Series, followed by 
Series appearances in 1942, 1946 and 1949.[15] In addition, he umpired 
in the All-Star Game in 1939, 1944 and 1949, behind the plate for half 
of the 1939 and 1944 midsummer classics.[16] Hubbard found the then-common 
practice of officials moving to different positions on the field during 
a game to be confusing and hampered accuracy when making calls. Applying 
his football experience to baseball, he devised a system where each official 
had clearly defined duties and also added an additional official to the 
crew.[3] This was the foundation on which MLB established new officiating 
standards in 1952.[16] While hunting during the 1951 off-season a ricocheting 
pellet from a friends shotgun blast accidentally struck Hubbard in the 
right eye.[17] The damage was extensive enough to force his retirement 
from baseball officiating. However the American League soon hired him as 
an assistant supervisor for league officiating crews, and in 1954 he became 
the top supervisor, a position he would hold until retiring for good in 
1969.[6] Never a fan of big cities, Hubbard had moved to Milan, Missouri 
in 1944.[18] He left in 1945 but moved back in 1948 for good.[6] Milan 
was a small town much like his native Keytesville, which is about fifty 
miles to the south on Missouri Route 5. A lifelong avid fisherman and hunter, 
the rural areas of Sullivan and neighboring counties offered ample opportunity. 
Hubbard stayed involved in community affairs, especially children's sports, 
as much as his schedule would allow. In honor of his efforts the football 
field at Milan High School is named Cal Hubbard Field.[19] Hubbard developed 
emphysema in the last few years of his life, so doctors suggested that 
he move away from the cold weather in Missouri. He relocated in 1976 to 
St. Petersburg, Florida.[20] In recognition of his contributions to the 
game as an umpire and supervisor, Cal Hubbard was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1976, only the fifth umpire to be so honored up to that 
time.[6] Hubbard died due to cancer October 17, 1977 in St. Petersburg. 
He is buried in the Oakwood Cemetery, Milan, Missouri. He was survived 
by wife Mildred and two sons, Dr. Robert Hubbard, and William "Bill" Hubbard.[21]
