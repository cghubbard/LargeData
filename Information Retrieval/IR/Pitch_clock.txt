A pitch clock is used in college baseball and Minor League Baseball to 
limit the amount of time a pitcher uses before he throws the ball to the 
hitter. In college baseball, the Southeastern Conference experimented with 
using pitch clocks in 2010. Pitchers were given twenty seconds to throw 
the pitch, or a ball would be added to the count. Similarly, a batter stepping 
out of the batter's box with less than five seconds on the clock will be 
assessed an additional strike.[1] After the 2010 season, the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association sought to make the pitch clocks mandatory,[2] and 
instituted it for the 2011 college baseball season, but only for when there 
are no runners on base.[3] Pitch clocks made their professional debut in 
the Arizona Fall League in 2014. On January 15, 2015, Major League Baseball 
announced it will use a 20-second pitch clock for Double-A and Triple-A 
teams during the 2015 season.[4] Pitchers were given twenty seconds to 
throw the pitch, with the punishment of a ball awarded to the batter if 
not followed.[5] Along with other rule changes addressing the pace of the 
game, the clocks contributed to a 12-minute reduction in game times at 
those levels between the 2014 and 2015 seasons, compared to the leagues 
that did not use the clock, which saw game times change from an increase
