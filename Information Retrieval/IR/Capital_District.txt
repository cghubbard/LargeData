The Capital District, also known as the Capital Region, refers to the metropolitan 
area surrounding Albany, the capital of the U.S. state of New York. With 
a population of 1,170,483 (2013), the Capital District is the fourth largest 
metropolitan region in the state[1] and the 45th largest in the country.[2] 
Companies that have headquarters in Albany include CommerceHub and the 
Environment One Corporation.[3] In the 21st century, the Capital District 
has emerged as a major anchor of Tech Valley, the moniker describing the 
technologically-focused region of eastern New York State. The Capital District 
was first settled by the Dutch in the early 17th century and came under 
British control in 1664. Albany has been the permanent capital of the state 
of New York since 1797. The Capital District is notable for many historical 
events that predate the independence of the United States, including the 
Albany Plan of Union and The Battles of Saratoga. The term Capital District 
is commonly used to refer to the area due to its location surrounding the 
state capital. This is similar to other capital districts throughout the 
world, all of which are associated with a respective capital city. The 
earliest reference to the name "Capital District" stems from the planned 
metropolitan area surrounding Albany,[4] which was attempted by the state 
in the late 1760s comprising land that is now the cities of Albany, Troy, 
Rensselaer, Watervliet, and Cohoes; along with what are now the towns of 
Colonie (including the villages of Colonie and Menands), Green Island, 
North Greenbush, and East Greenbush.[5] Later, Schenectady was added to 
this district as well.[6] In the 1810s several economic and government 
organizations covering the area also used Capital District in their name, 
such as the Capital District Conference of Charities and Corrections in 
1813,[7] the Capital District Life Underwriters Association also in 1813,[8] 
and the Capital District Recreation League.[9] The Capital District Recreation 
League, formed in 1816, proposed a Capital District Park (also referred 
to as the Six City Park) to be roughly 8 miles (13 km) from Albany, Cohoes, 
Rensselaer, Schenectady, Troy, and Watervliet. The location proposed was 
the area of the Shaker settlement.[9] The park was never created, though 
in 1928 the location was used for Albany International Airport for the 
same reason of its central location to those suburbs. Capitaland, Metroland, 
and Tech Valley are nicknames sometimes used to refer to the Capital District.[10] 
Different uses of the names Capital District, Capital Region, and Eastern 
New York may sometimes be used on regions that include Hamilton County; 
and the extreme northern portions of the Mid-Hudson Valley, usually Ulster 
and Dutchess counties; or extreme southern sections of Essex County.[11] 
The Capital District is a part of the area marketed under the name Tech 
Valley in recognition of the technology companies that have moved to the 
region, or are being wooed by governmental or educational institutions 
to relocate to the area. The 19-county region, which extends from the Canada–US 
border south to Orange County,[12] is marketed by organizations such as 
the Tech Valley Chamber Coalition, the Albany-Colonie Regional Chamber 
of Commerce, and the Albany-based Center for Economic Growth.[13] Permanent 
European claims and settlement began in 1609 when Henry Hudson sailed north 
up the Hudson River in the name of the Dutch.[14] During the same year, 
Samuel Champlain explored south down Lake Champlain and Lake George in 
the name of France.[14] Conflict soon ensued between the French and Dutch 
for control of the fur trade and both made alliances with different Native 
American tribes.[15] In 1630, Kiliaen van Rensselaer founded the Manor 
of Rensselaerswyck, a Dutch patroonship in the area, which encompassed 
much of the area that is now the Capital District.[16] In 1664 the English 
successfully conquered the Dutch while rivalry with the French continued.[17] 
The Dutch, and then the English, maintained focus on settlement and farming 
while the French incursion into this area was limited to hunting for furs, 
trading with the natives, and building a few forts. Conflict arose when 
the French-built Fort Carillon and the British-built Fort William Henry 
near each other, both in order to control the route between the Hudson 
River Valley and the Champlain Valley. Through the Dongan Charter, Governor 
Thomas Dongan granted Albany the right to purchase 500 acres (2.0 km2) 
in "Schaahtecogue" (today Schaghticoke, in Rensselaer County)[18][19] and 
1,000 acres (4.0 km2) at "Tionnondoroge" (today Fort Hunter, in Montgomery 
County).[18][20] Arent van Curler founded Schenectady in 1662; Fort Saratoga 
was built at present-day Schuylerville in 1691; and Greenbush (present-day 
city of Rensselaer) was settled in the 1620s. South of Albany, settlement 
occurred quickly at first, but slowed as growth on the frontier pushed 
people north and west of Albany and left the southern reaches of the Capital 
District behind. Hudson, in Columbia County, was purchased from the natives 
in 1662 by Dutch farmers and speculators but did not see actual settlement 
and growth until 1783 when New Englanders, mainly from southeastern Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island, arrived.[21] It was chartered as a city in 1785, becoming 
only the third city in the state. The French and Indian War saw several 
major battles in the Capital District, including at the aforementioned 
forts. In the end, the French were defeated, freeing the land for further 
settlement to the west and north of Albany. During the American Revolution 
the area again saw fighting and Fort Ticonderoga experienced notable action. 
The Battle of Saratoga, which took place in the present-day town of Stillwater, 
is considered the turning point of the war. In 1776, General Philip Schuyler 
built a small fleet of ships at Whitehall. They were used by Benedict Arnold 
in the Battle of Valcour Island. The event led to Whitehall's modern-day 
claim to be the birthplace of the United States Navy.[22] After the Revolution, 
settlements continued to proliferate west and north of the Albany area. 
North of Albany, along the river, settlements grew quickly: Waterford (oldest 
continuously incorporated village in the US, incorporated in 1794),[23] 
Troy (settled in 1787, chartered as a village 1801, city in 1816), Lansingburgh 
(a village in 1763, annexed to Troy in 1900), and Watervliet (settled in 
1643 and incorporated as a village in 1836 as West Troy, city in 1897). 
West from Schenectady, land purchases in the 1750s led to settlements at 
Fonda and Fultonville in Montgomery County, but land purchases elsewhere, 
such as at Gloversville in Fulton County did not see settlement until the 
end of the 18th century when the Iroqouis threat had been eliminated by 
the Sullivan Expedition in 1779, which came as retaliation for the Cherry 
Valley Massacre in nearby Otsego County. The entire area of the Capital 
District was within the original boundaries of Albany County as established 
by the Province of New York on November 1, 1683; it was one of the original 
12 counties.[24][25] In 1772, Charlotte County and Tryon County were both 
formed from parts of Albany County. Charlotte County was renamed Washington 
County in 1784, and from part of that, Warren County was created in 1813.[26] 
Tryon County was renamed Montgomery County in 1784, and from part of that, 
Fulton County was created in 1838.[26] Tryon County was large: it encompassed 
the lands from five miles (8 km) west of Schenectady to the western indeterminate 
boundary of the Province of New York.[27] What remained of Albany County 
in 1774 became the most populated county in the state with a population 
of 42,921 and it continued to be the most populous county until at least 
1790, when the population was 75,921.[25] Albany lost population as new 
counties were created from within: Columbia County was created in 1786; 
Rensselaer and Saratoga counties were formed in 1791; Schoharie County 
was created in 1795 from parts of both Albany and Otsego counties (Otsego 
having been created from part of Montgomery County in 1791); Greene County 
was formed in 1800 from parts of both Albany and Ulster counties; Schenectady 
County was created in 1809; and Warren County was formed in 1813 from Washington 
County. Fulton County was the last county in the Capital District to be 
formed.[26] A graphical representation of the county breakup timeline can 
be seen below. Many geographical features weighed heavily in the area's 
early industrialization. The abundance of small creeks with waterfalls 
led to early adoption of the waterwheel, while water navigation south on 
the Hudson and land routes west along the relatively flat Mohawk Valley 
allowed for easy access to and from resources and markets in those areas. 
In the late 1790s stage lines began to connect the various cities and villages 
in the area; this network would then connect the area to the rest of the 
country in the early 19th century. The early 19th century also saw the 
rise of turnpikes (the Great Western Turnpike would be the first in 1799), 
plank roads, and post roads. It was in Albany in 1809 that Robert Fulton 
first demonstrated that steam boats could be economically successful with 
a trip to the city of New York. In 1813, to support the army in the War 
of 1812, the US government built the Watervliet Arsenal in West Troy, one 
of the earliest large scale industrial complexes in the Capital District. 
In 1823 the Federal Dam was built on the Hudson, allowing for navigation 
north past Troy to Waterford and Cohoes. The Champlain and Erie canals 
were opened in 1823 [28] and 1825,[29] respectively. Their completion connected 
the area to the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, leading to a large 
influx in industrialization and immigration.[citation needed] Shortly after 
the completion of the canals, in 1831, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad Company 
(M&H) built the Albany and Schenectady Railroad between those two cities.[citation 
needed] This was the first railway in the state.[citation needed] Railroads, 
like the plank/post roads and canals before them, made Albany an even more 
important transportation hub. In 1853 Erastus Corning consolidated 10 railroads 
stretching from Albany to Buffalo as the New York Central Railroad, headquartered 
in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt took over in 1867 and moved the company 
to New York City.[30] Industry consequently became prominent in the area. 
Gloversville was labeled the "headquarters of the glove and mitten industry" 
and became the preeminent glove-manufacturing and leather-working region 
in New York.[31] Cohoes became known as the Spindle City for its large 
cotton mills, due mainly to Harmony Mills, the largest cotton mill complex 
in the world when it opened in 1872.[citation needed] Troy became famous 
for its iron works due to Burden Iron Works,[32] though later Troy would 
earn the nickname of Collar City due to Cluett, Peabody & Co., which made 
Arrow brand shirts at the largest collar, cuff, and shirt factory in the 
world at the time.[32] In 1887 Thomas Edison moved his Edison Machine Works 
to Schenectady, and in 1892 Schenectady became the headquarters of the 
General Electric Company (GE).[33] Schenectady Locomotive Works, along 
with seven other locomotive manufacturers, merged in 1901 and the American 
Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed and headquartered in Schenectady.[34] 
Due to the dominance of GE and ALCO in their respective industries, Schenectady 
would gain the nicknames of Electric City and "The City that Lights and 
Hauls the World". The nature of this industry lent itself to the creation 
of many labor-saving inventions, such as the horseshoe machine of Henry 
Burden, the pre-shrinking fabric machines of Sanford Cluett, the power 
knitting loom of Timothy Bailey, the railroad air-brake of George Westinghouse, 
and the hundreds of electricity-related improvements of General Electric 
Company scientists.[32] Starting with the 1980 US Census, Albany posted 
a decline in population until the 2000 US Census. Meanwhile, the suburbs 
saw an influx in population and grew at the expense of the city of Albany.[35] 
There were many causes to this, including the building of interstates and 
other highways allowing for more commuting, lack of available suitable 
land within the urban centers, and the subsequent location of shopping 
centers following the people to the suburbs. The decline of exporting from 
the United States contributed to a general decline as well. Watervliet, 
Cohoes, and especially Troy lost a competitive edge that came with being 
at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers: the location no longer 
meant better access to markets, waterfalls no longer made the cheapest 
power, and cheap labor in the southern and western parts of the nation 
became important to companies.[36] General Electric moved part of their 
headquarters to Connecticut from Schenectady in the mid-80s.[37] Within 
the Capital District focus shifted to the suburbs. The suburbs had large 
open spaces for office parks and homes while the cities were constrained 
in available land. Albany International, with their headquarters and factory 
straddling the Menands and Albany border, built a new headquarters in 1987 
in suburban East Greenbush,[38] as did Garden Way, headquartered in Troy.[39] 
The region's first technology park was built in the 1980s in North Greenbush 
by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).[40] Not only was there a shift 
in population to the suburbs, there was also a shift in retail shopping 
as well; retail sales in the cities declined a percent between 1972 and 
1987, having increased 63 percent in the suburbs.[41] In 1957 Westgate 
Plaza became the first "suburban"-style shopping center in the area; it 
was and still is within the city limits of Albany however, but then two 
years later in 1959 Stuyvesant Plaza was built outside Albany in the neighboring 
town of Guilderland.[42] 1966 saw the opening of Colonie Center, the area's 
first enclosed shopping mall.[42] When built it drew shoppers from hundreds 
of miles from Albany.[42] Macy's, which only had locations in the New York 
City area, and Sears originally wanted to build in downtown Albany, but 
interference from Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd led to those stores choosing 
to move into suburban Colonie Center instead.[43][unreliable source?] Problems 
with Mayor Corning would also force the Albany Times Union newspaper to 
move from Albany to Colonie in the 1970s. Crossgates Mall is a large upscale 
mall that was built in the suburb of Guilderland in 1984. A modern expansion 
in 1994 drew luxury anchor Lord & Taylor to the mall and added another 
Macy's which was exclusive to the region. Five more enclosed malls were 
built in the next ten years, all outside of Albany limits: Rotterdam Square 
outside Schenectady, Wilton Mall in Saratoga Springs, Aviation Mall in 
Queensbury, and Clifton Park Center in Clifton Park.[42] The first mall 
built within a downtown area was completed back in 1977 as the Amsterdam 
Mall in Amsterdam.[44] The next year, Troy opened the Uncle Sam Atrium,[42] 
and in 1986 Cohoes attempted Cohoes Commons, which is now office space.[45][46] 
In the late 1980s historic parts of Albany, as well as areas of Schenectady, 
Troy, and Saratoga Springs all began to see intensive restoration with 
an influx of private investments. During the Pataki administration a plan 
(referred to as the "Albany Plan") was devised to move state workers out 
of the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus and move them to 
the downtowns of Albany, Schenectady, Troy and Wolf Road in Colonie.[47] 
Just prior to and as part of the Albany Plan regional headquarters of NYSDOT 
were built on the corner of State and Broadway in Schenectady, state workers 
were moved to the Troy Atrium in Troy, and the DEC and Comptrollers buildings 
were built in Albany. Along with new state workers and buildings Albany 
also saw the refurbishment and renovation of the State Education Building, 
State Capitol, Smith Building, and the NY Court of Appeals. New construction 
also occurred at other levels of government with the building of the Albany 
County Family Court and with the city refurbishing the Palace Theatre. 
Private investment in downtown Albany saw an influx of restaurants, bars, 
and nightclubs; especially on Pearl Street and the first new office high 
rise in 15 years was built on Broadway. In Schenectady the Metroplex Authority 
allowed for massive private investment on State Street in the vicinity 
of Proctor's Theatre. Along with Proctor's being expanded, two new hotels, 
a large movie theater, and the headquarters of Price Chopper moving Downtown 
from the suburbs of neighboring Rotterdam, that section has seen a huge 
revival. The Capital District's most prominent geological features were 
formed by glaciers creating its major rivers and valleys through ancient 
mountain ranges. The Hudson River forms the Hudson Valley which is a north-south 
running valley through the core of the Capital District while its tributary 
the Mohawk River forms the Mohawk Valley which runs west from Schenectady, 
the Schoharie Creek, a tributary of the Mohawk, forms the Schoharie Valley 
which runs through Schoharie County. Major mountain ranges are the Adirondack 
Mountains in the northwestern area and the Appalachian Mountains along 
the southern and eastern sections. The Appalachians include the Rensselaer 
Plateau in Rensselaer and southeastern Washington counties; the Taconic 
Mountains along the Washington, Rensselaer, and Columbia counties' borders 
with Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut; the Allegheny Plateau in 
Schoharie, Greene, and western Albany counties, which includes the Helderberg 
Escarpment in Albany County; and the Catskill Mountains in Greene County. 
Major lakes include the Great Sacandaga Lake in Saratoga and Fulton counties, 
Saratoga Lake in Saratoga County, and Lake George in Warren and Essex counties. 
The Capital District has a humid continental climate, with cold, snowy 
winters, and hot, wet summers. Albany receives around 36.2 inches of rain 
per year, with 135 days of at least .01 inches of precipitation. Snowfall 
is significant, totaling about 63 inches annually,[49] but with less accumulation 
than the lake-effect areas to the north and west, being far enough from 
Lake Ontario. The core of the region is however, close enough to the coast 
to receive heavy snow from Nor'easters, and the region gets the bulk of 
its yearly snowfall from these types of storms. The region also occasionally 
receives Alberta clippers. Mohawk–Hudson convergence occasionally prolongs 
snowfall events in the Capital District, where precipitation has ended 
elsewhere across the region.[50] Winters are often very cold with fluctuating 
conditions, temperatures can drop to below 0 °F (−18 °C) at night. Summers 
in the region can contain stretches of excessive heat and humidity, with 
temperatures above 90 °F (32 °C) and dew points near 70. Severe thunderstorms 
are common but tornadoes are rare. Albany receives on average per year 
69 sunny days, 111 partly cloudy days, and 185 cloudy days;[51] and an 
average, over the course of a year, of less than four hours of sunshine 
per day, with just over an average of 2.5 hours per day over the course 
of the winter.[52] The chance during daylight hours of sunshine is 53%, 
with the highest percentage of sunny daylight hours being in July with 
64%, and the lowest month is November with 37%.[49] The Capital District, 
having a history of settlement stretching back 400 years, has had many 
different architectural styles built over the years. Early Dutch farmhouses 
are still standing in the rural towns, especially west of Albany, such 
as the Mabee House. The Van Ostrande-Radliff House (1728) in Albany and 
the Rosa House in Schenectady (before 1700) are the oldest houses in each 
city. In 1885 American Architect and Building News, a magazine with national 
circulation, polled its readers asking what the nation's Top Ten most beautiful 
buildings were. Two buildings in the city of Albany made the list: Albany 
City Hall and the New York State Capitol; both finished in 1883 and designed 
by Henry Hobson Richardson.[53] Troy has many distinctive features in architecture 
that sets it apart, such as its ornamental ironwork, cast-iron storefronts 
such as the Arts Center of the Capital Region, and the abundance of windows 
by Tiffany such as St. John's Episcopal Church, Troy Public Library, and 
St. Paul's Episcopal Church.[54] The Capital District also has a large 
selection of brownstone buildings especially in the Center Square neighborhood 
of Albany and the Washington Park neighborhood in Troy. Washington Park 
in Troy is one of only two privately owned urban ornamental parks in the 
state.[55] Schenectady's Stockade neighborhood has representations of residential 
architecture from all periods in its 300-year history including Dutch, 
Federal, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, and Victorian.[56] Also in Schenectady 
is the GE Realty Plot built by General Electric as homes for their employees,[57] 
the houses are in revival styles such as Tudor, Georgian, Queen Anne, Dutch 
Colonial, and Spanish Colonial.[58] The first all electric house was built 
by GE in the Realty Plot to showcase its products.[56] In Albany's Pine 
Hills neighborhood is a style of residential architecture that is rare 
in the rest of the Capital District, bungalows in the Spanish revival style, 
with red tile roofs and stucco walls, only 27 still exist and are the remnants 
of the Winchester Gables development.[59] For recreation the Capital District 
has many state and local parks, preserves, hiking trails, public pools, 
and ice skating rinks. The following state parks are in the Capital District: 
Cherry Plain, Max V. Shaul, Saratoga Spa, Grafton Lakes, Mine Kill, Schodack 
Island, Hudson River Islands, Moreau Lake, Thompson's Lake, John Boyd Thacher, 
and Peebles Island.[60] While they are frequently referred to as state 
parks, the Adirondack Park and Catskill Park have much more in common with 
a national forest: they mix private with public land and have year-round 
residents within their boundaries in long-established settlements. The 
boundaries of the Adirondack and Catskill parks are often referred to as 
the Blue Line. Parts of Fulton, Saratoga, Warren, and Washington counties 
are in the Adirondack Park. Much of Greene County is in the Catskill Park 
The various municipalities of the Capital District have established many 
parks, small and large, for the recreational enjoyment of the residents 
and visitors of the area. Central Park in the city of Schenectady has over 
4,000 individual rose bushes of between 300 and 400 different varieties 
in its rose garden at the Wright Avenue entrance.[61] Washington Park in 
Albany is home to many festivals, including the TulipFest and the LatinFest. 
One of the largest events in the Capital District is the Tulip Fest held 
in Albany every spring at Washington Park. The tradition stems from when 
Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd got a city ordinance passed declaring the tulip 
as Albany's official flower on July 1, 1948. In addition, he sent a request 
to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to name a variety as Albany's tulip. 
On July 11, 1948 her reply was "Her Majesty gladly accepts the invitation 
to designate a tulip as the official flower of Albany." She picked the 
variety "Orange Wonder", a bronzy orange shaded scarlet. The first Tulip 
Fest was celebrated the next year on May 14, 1949 with opening ceremonies 
still carried on today as tradition, such as the sweeping of State Street 
and the crowning of a Tulip Queen.[62] The African-American tradition of 
Pinksterfest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, 
was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest.[citation needed] Attendance 
to the festival in 2010 was approximately 80,000.[63] The largest Flag 
Day parade in the United States is held every year in Troy. The 42nd annual 
parade in 2009 is along a two-mile (3 km) long route.[64] First Night celebrations 
are held in Saratoga Springs, while in 2006 Albany decided to eliminate 
its First Night celebrations in favor of a new "Albany WinterFestival" 
(WinterFest).[65] Other major festivals in the Capital District include 
ethnic festivals. The Albany LatinFest, which has been held since 1996, 
drew 10,000 people to Washington Park in 2008.[66] In Schenectady the growing 
Guyanese community has celebrated the Guyanese Family Fun Day for several 
years in that city's Central Park.[67] PolishFest is a three-day celebration 
of Polish culture in the Capital District, held in the town of Colonie 
for the past eight years.[68] The Capital District has many enclosed malls 
that are regional malls (malls over 400,000 sq ft (37,000 m2) ), and two 
that are classified as super-regional malls (malls with over 800,000 sq ft 
(74,000 m2) ).[69] Crossgates Mall in Guilderland and Colonie Center in 
Colonie are the two super-regional malls with over 1,000,000 square feet 
(93,000 m2) of rentable space in each. Regional malls are located in Schenectady, 
Saratoga, and Warren counties. In the Capital District are several regional 
amusement parks and water parks. The Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom 
is a Six Flags park in Queensbury with an indoor waterpark and hotel across 
the street. Zoom Flume Water Park is in East Durham. Hoffman's Playland 
in the town of Colonie is a children's amusement park. During the winter 
months the Capital District has many places to go for such cold-weather 
activities as skiing, snowboarding, tubing, ice fishing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, 
and ice climbing. Some downhill ski centers include Maple Ski Ridge in 
Schenectady County, Willard Mountain in Washington County, Windham Mountain 
and Hunter Mountain in Greene County, West Mountain and Hickory Ski Center 
in Warren County which has the sixth highest vertical drop in the state.[70] 
In addition to downhill skiing most also have cross-country skiing trails 
as well. There are also cross-country trails at the state parks in the 
area, the Schenectady County Forest in Duanesburg and Pine Ridge XC Ski 
Area in Rensselaer County. There are over 18 miles (29 km) of official 
trails for snowshoeing at the Albany Pine Bush Preserve.[71] The 11 counties 
of the Capital District are divided into 13 cities and 143 towns, with 
62 villages that are inside one or more towns. One village, Green Island 
is coterminous with its town and share only one government institution. 
The municipalities in the Capital District range in size from villages 
with a few hundred residents to Albany (the largest city) with over 95,000 
and Colonie (the largest town) with over 80,000. Albany consistently ranks 
high on lists of top cities/metro areas for culture, such as being 23rd 
in the book Cities Ranked & Rated.[76] Albany ranked 12th among large metro 
areas and Glens Falls ranked 12th among the small metro areas in Sperling's 
Best Places;[77] and Expansion Management (a monthly business magazine) 
gave the Albany-Schenectady-Troy area five Stars, its highest ranking, 
for quality of life features.[77] The Capital District has many museums, 
historical sites, art galleries, and festivals that stretch back to the 
17th century. The Capital District has been pivotal in the history of Santa 
Claus in the United States including the first written reference to Santa 
(Sinterclaas) in 1675 and the first publishing of 'Twas the Night before 
Christmas in 1823.[78][79] The Albany-Schenectady-Troy media market, the 
56th largest in the United States,[80] includes all of the 11 counties 
of the Capital District, along with Hamilton County, New York, as well 
as Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and Bennington County, Vermont. In 
total, there are 16 AM/MW stations, 30 full-power FM stations, 14 low-power 
FM translators, 8 full power analog TV stations, 5 low-power TV translators, 
and 8 full power digital TV (DTV) stations licensed to communities within 
30 miles (48 km) of downtown Albany. In terms of broadcast media, Albany 
is part of Arbitron market #63 (radio), and Nielsen DMA #57 (television), 
and is a broadcast market with historical relevance. The pioneering influence 
of General Electric in Schenectady directly contributed to the area emerging 
as the birthplace of station-based television (WRGB), WRGB also has the 
distinction of being the very first affiliated station of the NBC Television 
Network. In 1947, this region was also home to the first independently 
owned and operated stand-alone FM radio station in the United States, W47A 
and one of the earliest FM broadcast stations (today's WRVE), in addition 
to the first federally licensed radio station in upstate New York, WGY. 
In the early 2000s, the greater Albany market had the distinction of having 
the highest concentration of FM broadcast stations east of the Mississippi 
River. There are no radio stations in the Albany area that provide programming 
in languages other than English on a full-time basis. A few individual 
programs; in languages including Spanish, Italian, and Arabic; are scheduled 
primarily on college owned and operated stations. The Albany Times Union 
is the area's primary daily newspaper; its headquarters moved to suburban 
Colonie from Albany in the 1970s after a dispute with then-Mayor Erastus 
Corning 2nd over land needed for expansion. More localized are the Daily 
Gazette, which focuses primarily on Schenectady; the Troy Record, which 
focuses on Troy; The Post-Star, which focuses on Washington, Warren, and 
northern Saratoga counties; The Saratogian, which focuses on Saratoga County; 
the Amsterdam Recorder for Montgomery and Fulton County; the Gloversville 
Leader-Herald for Fulton County; the Daily Mail for Greene County; and 
the Register-Star for Columbia County. Metroland is the alternative newsweekly 
in the area, publishing each Thursday, while The Business Review is a business 
weekly published each Friday. Capital Region Living is a monthly magazine 
available in Albany, Columbia, Fulton, Greene, Montgomery, Rensselaer, 
Saratoga, Schenectady, Warren, and Washington counties in New York; Bennington 
and Rutland counties in Vermont; and in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. 
The Capital District has been the birthplace of several important foods 
in American food culture. Potato chips were invented by African-American/Native 
American chef George Crum, at the Moon Lake Lodge's restaurant in Saratoga 
Springs. The club sandwich was also invented in Saratoga Springs, at the 
Saratoga Club-house, today the Canfield Casino, in 1894.[81] Pie à la Mode 
was first made at the Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, Washington County in 
the 1890s.[82][83] Sturgeon in the Hudson River was once so plentiful that 
the fish was referred to as "Albany beef".[84] Though the Capital District 
is not well known for its sports teams it does have a rich history of professional 
teams and college athletics. The Troy Trojans were a Major League Baseball 
team in the National League for four seasons from 1879 to 1882. In 1883 
the New York Gothams, later the New York and San Francisco Giants, took 
the Trojans place in the National League. Nearly half of the original Gotham 
players had been members of the Trojans. NBA head coach of the Los Angeles 
Lakers Phil Jackson won his first championship ring when he guided the 
Albany Patroons to the 1984 CBA championship. Three years later, the Patroons 
completed a 50–6 regular season, including winning all 28 of their home 
games; at that time, Denver Nuggets head coach George Karl was the Patroons' 
head coach. Future NBA stars Mario Elie and Vincent Askew were part of 
that season's squad. A third NBA head coach has roots in the Capital District 
as well, Pat Riley, most famous as the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, 
but also of the New York Knicks and Miami Heat. Riley played for Linton 
High School in Schenectady,[85] where he was also a football star. He also 
played on the Schenectady Little League Baseball team when in 1954 it won 
the Little League Baseball World Series. Aileen Durrant, from Stillwater 
High School, is the former New York State High School Softball Chairwoman 
and in 2012 she was inducted as part of the first class into the New York 
State High School Softball Hall of Fame Mike Tyson received his early training 
in the Capital District and his first professional fight was in Albany 
in 1985 and Tyson's first televised fight was in Troy in 1986. He fought 
professionally four times in Albany and twice each in Troy and Glens Falls 
between 1985 and 1986. Since 1988, the Siena College men's basketball team 
(the Siena Saints) have appeared in six NCAA Tournaments (1989, 1999, 2002, 
2008, 2009, and 2010), while their crosstown rivals, the Great Danes of 
the University at Albany (SUNY) have appeared five times 2006, 2007, 2013, 
2014 and 2015. The University at Albany has recently run a top 20 NCAA 
lacrosse program. The Capital District, however, has achieved its best 
success in NCAA hockey. Union College won the NCAA National Championship 
in 2014, while its rival, RPI, brought home the national title in 1985 
and 1954[86] Roller derby leagues in the area include Albany's Albany All-Stars 
Roller Derby and Troy's Hellions of Troy Roller Derby.[87] The economy 
of the Capital District was at the beginning of settlement by Europeans 
dominated by the fur trade, especially in beaver pelts, hence Albany's 
early name of Beverwyck. But as settlement grew and matured the economy 
became traditionally anchored by several large manufacturing industries, 
such as the glove and leather industry in Fulton and Montgomery counties, 
American Locomotive and General Electric in Schenectady, first steel and 
then the shirt industry in Troy, and lumber in Albany and Watervliet. Now 
the economy of the region is heavily anchored by the state as the largest 
employer in the eleven-county region,[88] employing thirteen percent of 
the non-farm workforce in the Capital District.[89] One-fourth of the area's 
workforce works for the state or local governments,[90] with the state 
of New York, the Federal government, and Albany County as the first, third, 
and eighth largest employers in the area. [88] There have traditionally 
been three legs holding up the region's economy- state government, health 
care, and education.[91] Health care provides a large and growing sector 
of the region's economy as well. Albany Medical Center, St. Peter's Health 
Care Services, and Northeast Health are the fourth, fifth, and sixth largest 
employers in the eleven-county Capital District.[88] Price Chopper, a privately 
owned grocery chain headquartered in Schenectady, is the 13th largest employer 
in the entire state of New York with 14,000 employees.[92] Manufacturing 
has been disappearing but is still important, and makes up six percent 
of the non-farm workforce.[93] Major factories in the area are owned by 
General Electric, still the region's largest private-sector employer,[88] 
and spin-offs such as Momentive Performance Materials' plant in Waterford, 
Saratoga County and the SABIC plant in Selkirk, Albany County. Mechanical 
Technology Inc. (MTI) of Schenectady, another spin-off from General Electric, 
has helped put the region on the map for alternative energy production, 
as has its own spin-off, Plug Power of Latham and the Center for Future 
Energy Systems at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The Capital District 
has historically been linked to banking, finance, and insurance. Bank of 
Albany, founded in 1792, was the second bank established in the state,[94] 
and American Express was founded in Albany. Finance and insurance employs 
six percent of the workforce in the area.[95] Many important regional and 
national banks are headquartered in the area, such as Trustco Bank, and 
many national banks have regional headquarters in Albany, such as Bank 
of America and KeyBank.[96][97] Albank, Norstar, Troy Savings Bank, Hudson 
River Bankcorp, and KeyBank were all founded in the area and have either 
moved their headquarters out of the region, such as KeyBank in 1994,[98] 
or been merged into larger companies such as Hudson River Bankcorp into 
First Niagara Bank, out of Buffalo. Though Bank of America is the nation's 
largest bank it ranks only sixth in the region in bank deposits.[98] Citizens 
Bank is the region's largest bank by market share of deposit holdings (32.5%), 
while Trustco Bank is largest by number of branches (52) in the area, as 
defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[98] Since the 2000s, 
the economy of the Capital District has been redirected toward high technology. 
Tech Valley is a marketing name for the eastern part of New York State, 
encompassing the Capital District and the Hudson Valley.[99] Originated 
in 1998 to promote the greater Albany area as a high-tech competitor to 
regions such as Silicon Valley and Boston, it has since grown to represent 
the counties in the Capital District and extending to IBM's Westchester 
County plants in the south and the Canada–US border to the north. The area's 
high technology ecosystem is supported by technologically focused academic 
institutions including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State University 
of New York Polytechnic Institute.[100] Tech Valley encompasses 19 counties 
straddling both sides of the Adirondack Northway and the New York Thruway,[99] 
and with heavy state taxpayer subsidy, has experienced significant growth 
in the computer hardware side of the high-technology industry, with great 
strides in the nanotechnology sector, digital electronics design, and water- 
and electricity-dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing,[101] 
involving companies including GlobalFoundries in Malta, IBM in Armonk and 
its Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, and others.[100][102][103] 
The Capital District is New York's most affluent metro area outside of 
the New York City metropolitan area. Median household income was roughly 
$86,787[104] in 1999 and its educational attainment profile, with 28 percent 
of adults having a college degree, is slightly above state average and 
well-above the national average.[105] The Albany Metropolitan Statistical 
Area (MSA) is defined by the Office of Management and Budget and includes 
Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, and Schoharie counties; makes 
up a large portion of the Capital District.[106] The A-S-A CSA is the vast 
majority of the Capital District, leaving out only Greene County. It has 
a population of 1,118,095 according to the 2000 US census,[107] and is 
ranked 38 out of the 169 CSAs in the US,[2] and is the third largest in 
the state. Adding the population of Greene County in the 2000 census, 48,195, 
to the population of the A-S-A MSA there is 1,166,290 persons in the 11 
counties of the Capital District. The Albany MSA includes only interior 
counties and was ranked the 56th most populous in the United States of 
America in the 2000 census.[108] Exterior counties Warren and Washington, 
in the northern reaches, make up the Glens Falls Micropolitan Statistical 
Area (μSA); while Fulton County the Gloversville (μSA), formed in 1990, 
Montgomery County the Amsterdam μSA (formed in 1990 from Albany MSA), and 
Columbia County is the Hudson μSA (formed in 1990). The Albany MSA along 
with those Micropolitan Stat. Areas combine to form the Albany Combined 
Statistical Area (A-S-A CSA).[109] Oneonta μSA The Capital District is 
split between several different districts for representation in the New 
York Legislature and the United States Congress. Chuck Schumer[110] (D) 
and Kirsten Gillibrand[111][112] (D) represent the state in the United 
States Senate. The area contains three congressional districts. The 20th 
district makes up most of the south, east, and north of the Capital District, 
while much of the rest is part of the 21st district. A small part of Fulton 
County is part of 23rd district. Currently the districts are represented 
by Chris Gibson (R) (20th district),[113][114] Paul Tonko (D) (21st district),[115] 
and Bill Owens (D) (23rd district). The area is represented in the State 
Legislature by nine Assembly districts and four Senate districts. For the 
Assembly the area is represented by Jack McEneny (D) of Albany (104th district);[116] 
George Amedore (R) of Rotterdam (105th district);[117] Ronald Canestrari 
(D) of Cohoes (106th district);[118][119] Timothy P. Gordon (I) of Delmar 
(108th district);[120] Robert Reilly (D) of Colonie (109th district);[121] 
James Tedisco (R) of Schenectady (110th district); [122] Tony Jordan (R), 
(112th district);[123] Teresa Sayward (R) of Willsboro (113th district);[124] 
and Peter Lopez (R) of Schoharie (127th district).[125] In the State Senate 
the area is represented by Roy McDonald (R) of Wilton (43rd district); [126] 
Hugh Farley (R) of Schenectady (44th district);[127] Betty Little (R) of 
Queensbury (45th district);[128] and Neil Breslin (D) of Albany (46th district).[129] 
In Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady counties there are 54 
public school districts,[130] each of which is under the umbrella of one 
of four Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) in the area: 
Capital Region BOCES,[131] Questar III (Rensselaer-Columbia-Greene BOCES),[132] 
Washington-Saratoga-Warren-Hamilton-Essex BOCES,[133] or Hamilton-Fulton-Montgomery 
BOCES.[134] Some of these districts cross county borders since school district 
boundaries are independent of town and county borders. The smallest district 
by student enrollment is North Greenbush Common School District, with 20 
students in 2006[135] and the largest school district is Shenendehowa Central 
School District, with 9,745 students in the end of the 2008 school year.[136] 
Bethlehem Central High School is the highest ranked public high school 
in the Capital District. By far the largest educational institution in 
the Capital District is The University at Albany, one of the four major 
university centers of the State University of New York. It has an enrollment 
of over 17,500 students from more than 100 nations at the graduate and 
undergraduate levels. Students can choose from 111 undergraduate majors 
and minors and 120-plus graduate programs. Many of these programs are nationally 
ranked, among them criminal justice, information technology, public administration, 
social welfare and sociology. The colleges and universities of the Capital 
District have a long and distinguished heritage. Founded in 1795, Union 
College was the alma mater of President Chester A. Arthur.[137] Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute in Troy is the oldest continually existing technical 
university in the English-speaking world.[138] Albany Law, Albany College 
of Pharmacy, Sage College of Albany, and Albany Medical Center (which consists 
of Albany Medical Center Hospital and the Albany Medical College) are independent 
of each other but all share one campus as part of the University Heights 
Association, in Albany. Saratoga Springs is the home of Skidmore College, 
a liberal arts college founded in 1903. Also in the Capital District are 
two Catholic schools, Siena College, a school in the Francisican tradition 
located in Loudonville, and St. Rose College, founded by the Sisters of 
St. Joseph in the Pine Hills section of Albany. The Capital Region also 
boasts two Community Colleges; Schenectady County Community College in 
Schenectady and Hudson Valley Community College located in Troy. Albany 
has long been at the forefront of transportation technology from the days 
of turnpikes and plank roads to the Erie Canal, from the first passenger 
railroad in the state to the oldest municipal airport in the nation. Today, 
Interstates, Amtrak, and the Albany International Airport continue to make 
the Capital District a major crossroads of the Northeastern United States. 
The Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) is the Metropolitan 
Planning Organization (MPO) for the Albany Metropolitan Statistical Area 
(MSA). Every metropolitan area in the United States with a population of 
over 50,000 must have a MPO in order to get any federal transportation 
funding. The US Department of Transportation (USDOT) uses an MPO to make 
decisions on what projects are most important to a metro area for immediate 
versus long term funding. The USDOT will not approve federal funds for 
transportation projects unless they are on an MPO's list.[139] The Adirondack/Glens 
Falls Transportation Council (A/GFTC) is the MPO for the Glens Falls MSA 
(and the town of Moreau, in Saratoga County).[140] The Capital District 
is situated at a major crossroads of the Northeastern United States, and 
was so even before Interstates and the US highway system. Many of the US 
and state routes were originally plank roads or turnpikes connecting the 
region. It is here that east-west Interstate 90 (I-90) and north-south 
Interstate 87 (I-87) meet at Exit 24 of the Thomas E. Dewey New York State 
Thruway. Exit 24 is the busiest exit on the Thruway.[141] I-87 parallels 
the much older US Route 9W south of Albany and US Route 9 north and I-90 
parallels New York State Route 5 west from Albany; all three highways are 
still important for local and regional traffic despite the proximity of 
the Interstates. The Thomas E. Dewey New York State Thruway is a toll-road 
which carries I-90 west from Exit 24 at Albany and I-87 south. North of 
Albany I-87 is a non-toll highway called the Adirondack Northway. East 
of Albany I-90 is toll-free until meeting up with the Berkshire Spur of 
the Thruway in Columbia County, at which point it joins the Spur and is 
a toll road to the Massachusetts border. Both I-90 and I-87 have three-digit 
Interstate spurs, Interstate 787 (I-787) and Interstate 890 (I-890). I-787 
connects with the Thruway/I-87 at Exit 23 and travels north connecting 
Albany with Watervliet, Cohoes, and Troy. I-787 parallels New York State 
Route 32 (Route 32), which remains an important road through those cities 
and beyond to and through Saratoga County. I-890 connects downtown Schenectady 
and the General Electric plant with I-90 at both ends east and west. Interstate 
88 starts at the Thruway (I-90) in Schenectady County and travels through 
Schoharie County to the Southern Tier of New York and the city of Binghamton, 
I-88 was originally planned to extend through the Capital District and 
exit the area into Vermont and end in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. I-88 parallels 
New York State Route 7 (Route 7) also another major highway in the Capital 
District, I-88's extension that was never built was to continue to parallel 
(and in many places replace) Route 7. One place in the Capital District 
in which I-88's route has been built but remained as part of a restructured 
Route 7 is the limited access highway section between the Northway and 
Troy, it was once called "Alternate 7". Route 7 continues through Troy 
and is an important route to Vermont. Albany has several short arterials 
that help connect it to the suburban and rural fringes, such as New York 
State Route 85 which begins as a limited access highway from I-90 in Albany, 
but then changes to a two lane highway south of the city limits, and the 
South Mall Arterial which connects Albany to Rensselaer and carries US 
Route 20 and US Route 9. US Route 4 is an important route in the Capital 
District and starts in East Greenbush, Rensselaer County and though it 
is labelled as east-west in the other states in which it runs, it is labelled 
as north-south in New York. The four core counties of the Capital District 
are served by buses of the Capital District Transportation Authority, which 
has transit hubs in the three principal cities of Albany, Schenectady, 
and Troy. There is also express bus service between Saratoga Springs and 
Albany. The CDTA serves a large part of Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady 
counties, and has recently started expanding its service in Saratoga County,[142] 
but currently does not serve north of Saratoga Springs. The Greater Glens 
Falls Transit serves the city of Glens Falls, and its suburbs in Warren, 
Washington, and Saratoga counties. The Gloversville Transit System covers 
the twin cities of Gloversville and Johnstown along with their suburbs 
in Fulton County, along with one longer distance route to and through Amsterdam 
in Montgomery County and back. The Schoharie County Public Transit services 
a large swath of that county. The city of Mechanicville, Saratoga County 
runs a public transit service on four routes which cover the city and the 
surrounding suburbs in the towns of Stillwater and Halfmoon in Saratoga 
County and the hamlet of Hemstreet Park in the town of Schaghticoke, Rensselaer 
County.[143] Nine of the 11 counties in the Capital District make up the 
Upper Hudson Region as defined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
In 1978 the FAA assigned the Capital District Regional Planning Commission 
to be responsible for this region's aviation system planning and to provide 
technical assistance. The Upper Hudson Region has 26 airports open to public 
use, with 13 designated as system airports.[144] Those 13 airports are:[145] 
Amtrak has several routes servicing the stations of the Capital District. 
The Adirondack (north to Montreal, Quebec and south to the city of New 
York), Empire Service (west to Buffalo and Niagara Falls, south to New 
York), Ethan Allen Express (northeast to Rutland, Vermont and south to 
New York), Maple Leaf (west to Toronto and south to New York), and the 
Lake Shore Limited (at Albany-Rensselaer separate routes from Boston and 
New York merge to one train west to Chicago, on way east one train splits 
to two, one east to Boston another south to New York). Amtrak stations 
in the region are: Nation: States: Territories: Coordinates: 42°39′42.25″N
