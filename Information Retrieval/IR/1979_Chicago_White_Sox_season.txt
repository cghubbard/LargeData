The 1979 Chicago White Sox season was the team's 80th season overall, and 
their 79th in Major League Baseball. They finished with a record 73-87, 
good enough for fifth place in the American League West, 15 games behind 
the first-place California Angels. The team opened the season with reserve 
infielder Don Kessinger acting as player-manager. He was relieved of his 
managerial duties on August 2, with the team's record at 46-60, at which 
point he also retired as a player. He was replaced by coach Tony La Russa, 
making his major league managerial debut. The team went 27-27 the rest 
of the season. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 
[14] Infielders Coaches Disco Demolition Night (also known as "Anti-Disco 
Night" and "Disco Sucks Night") was a promotional event that took place 
on July 12, 1979, at Comiskey Park in Chicago. It was held during a scheduled 
twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. 
After the first game, a throng of fans stormed the field, damaging it so 
badly that the second game had to be forfeited to Detroit. Note: G = Games
