The 2009 Detroit Tigers season was the team's 109th season. The Tigers' 
new slogan for 2009 was "Always a Tiger." It replaced the 2006–2008 slogan 
"Who's Your Tiger?" The Tigers ended the season on October 6 with a 6–5 
loss in 12 innings to the Minnesota Twins in the tie-breaker game to win 
the AL Central. The Tigers spent 146 days in first place and became the 
first team in Major League history to lose a three-game lead with four 
games left to play. On July 30, the Tigers traded outfielder Josh Anderson 
to Kansas City for cash considerations.[25] On July 31, the Tigers traded 
rookie left-handed pitcher Luke French and left-handed pitcher Mauricio 
Robles to Seattle for veteran left-handed starting pitcher Jarrod Washburn.[26] 
On August 17, the Tigers traded pitcher Brett Jacobson to Baltimore for 
Aubrey Huff.[27] The Tigers' home opener was on April 10 against the Texas 
Rangers.[28] The Tigers won that game 15–2, which included a grand slam 
by Miguel Cabrera and finished the series with a sweep.[29] The Tigers 
swept their rivals the Indians in Cleveland during the second weekend of 
May.[30] The Tigers also completed back-to-back sweeps in May, against 
the Athletics and the Rangers. The Tigers also completed back-to-back sweeps 
in late June, over the Brewers and Cubs. On May 15, the Tigers hit 2 grand 
slams in a game, only the third time in team history.[31] On June 19, Instant 
replay was used twice in the Tigers' 10-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers 
at Comerica Park, the first time that's happened in league history.[32] 
Miguel Cabrera's third-inning single off the top of the wall is called 
a home run after instant replay review shows that it had actually cleared 
the wall. Contrarily, Dusty Ryan's fourth-inning home run was overturned 
to a ground rule double. Later that weekend, the Tigers won the series 
with a sweep. On May 19, Dontrelle Willis and four relief pitchers combined 
to throw a one-hitter in a 4–0 Tigers Victory. Willis had a stretch in 
which he retired 17 straight batters [33] The Tigers completed back-to-back 
sweeps against the Indians and Rays in early September.[34][35] The Tigers 
held the 1st-place position from May 8 until they lost it to the Twins 
in the tiebreaker game on October 6. The Tigers swept the Indians for the 
third time of the season in late September.[36] Infielders Outfielders
