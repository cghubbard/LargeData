Dodger blue, white, red The Oklahoma City Dodgers are a Minor League Baseball 
team based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The team, which plays in the Pacific 
Coast League (PCL), is the Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
They play at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark, located in the Bricktown Entertainment 
District in downtown Oklahoma City. The team was originally known as the 
Oklahoma City 89ers from 1962 to 1997 when the team played at All Sports 
Stadium (now demolished) at the state fairgrounds. It first competed in 
the American Association (AA) in 1962, moved to the PCL from 1963 to 1968, 
and returned to the AA from 1969 to 1997. In 1998, the team rejoined the 
PCL and became known as the Oklahoma RedHawks. In 1999, a minor name change 
resulted in the Oklahoma City RedHawks. Since the Los Angeles Dodgers purchased 
a share of the team prior to 2015, the team has been known as the Oklahoma 
City Dodgers. Oklahoma City won the PCL championship in 1963 and 1965 as 
the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Colt .45s/Astros and the AA championship 
in 1992 and 1996 with the Texas Rangers. Oklahoma City has been home to 
professional baseball for all but a few years since 1904, when the Metropolitans 
(Mets) were established as the city's first team.[1] Oklahoma City's teams 
and names have changed numerous times since. The team became known as the 
Indians in 1909 before returning to the original Mets name in 1910 and 
reverting again to the Indians name in 1911. Oklahoma City was home to 
the Senators in 1912. After one year without a baseball team, Oklahoma 
City's squad became the Boosters in 1914. The Senators name returned from 
1915 to 1916, but the Boosters name came back in 1917. The Oklahoma City 
Indians name returned in 1918 and the team name stuck until 1957 (the team 
did not compete during World War II).[2] Oklahoma City's current baseball 
franchise began competing in 1962 as the Oklahoma City 89ers following 
a four-year period without professional baseball in the area.[3] The franchise's 
original name made reference to the Land Run of 1889, which led to the 
founding of Oklahoma City. After the Houston Buffaloes of the American 
Association were purchased for territorial rights by the Houston Colt .45s 
(later the Houston Astros) of the National League, the big league club 
decided to move their minor league club elsewhere. In July 1961, Spec Richardson, 
who was then general manager of the Houston Buffs, met with Oklahoma City 
officials and boosters, and agreed to move the team.[4][5][6] After a unanimous 
approval from the American Association's board of directors, the current 
franchise began play in 1962 as the top affiliate of the Houston Colt .45s.[7] 
Eventually, the Astros sold the team to Tulsa businessman, P. C. Dixon, 
in November 1970.[8] In 1973, a three-year connection with the Cleveland 
Indians was established. A later affiliation with the Philadelphia Phillies 
lasted from 1976 until 1982. In 1983, the Texas Rangers became the parent 
club, a relationship that would continue as the 89ers adopted new colors 
and uniforms along with the nickname "RedHawks" in 1998. The city's first 
professional baseball name change in 35 years corresponded with the team's 
move to its current home, Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark, and with the team's 
return to the Pacific Coast League in 1998.[9] The team was renamed the 
RedHawks after the red-tailed hawk, a bird of prey commonly seen throughout 
Oklahoma. When announcing the new name, team officials noted the raptor's 
four-foot wingspan and migration patterns, which always return the bird 
to Oklahoma. A hawk is also part of the state's official song.[10] Prior 
to the 2009 season, the team once again named itself after its home city. 
The minor renaming was accompanied by new logos and a new color scheme.[11] 
The team's name change to the Oklahoma City RedHawks was made to honor 
Oklahoma City citizens who paid for the ballpark through a temporary one-cent 
sales tax to fund the Metropolitan Area Projects Plan or MAPS.[12] On September 
14, 2010, the Texas Rangers ownership announced that they were moving their 
Triple-A affiliation to the Round Rock Express (formerly the Astros' Triple-A 
affiliate).[13] On September 15, the RedHawks were sold to Mandalay Baseball 
Properties, which also owns or operates four other Minor League Baseball 
teams, and is part of the Mandalay Entertainment conglomerate chaired by 
entertainment industry executive Peter Guber. On September 20, Mandalay 
entered into a formal agreement for the RedHawks to become the Astros' 
new Triple-A affiliate.[14][15] After the 2015 season, the RedHawks announced 
the sale of the franchise to a partnership between Mandalay Entertainment 
Chairman and CEO Peter Guber, other current principals of Mandalay Baseball 
Properties, Jason Sugarman,[16] and the Los Angeles Dodgers. As a result 
of the purchase agreement, the RedHawks became the Triple-A affiliate of 
the Dodgers in 2016 and were renamed after their parent club, becoming 
the Oklahoma City Dodgers.[17] Pitchers Dustin Nippert and Luis Mendoza 
recorded the two no-hitters in team history (since 1998). Nippert recorded 
the RedHawks' first no-hitter on June 29, 2008, at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium 
in Omaha, Nebraska against the Omaha Royals. The Redhawks won the seven-inning 
game, the first of a doubleheader, 2–0. Nippert walked two batters and 
struck out five in the first Oklahoma City professional baseball no-hitter 
since August 13, 1996, when Rick Helling recorded a perfect game for the 
89ers).[18] Mendoza pitched the team's first nine-inning no-hitter on August 
14, 2009, against the Salt Lake Bees at Bricktown Ballpark. He threw 125 
pitches, including 74 for strikes. He walked six and struck out six batters 
in the 5–0 win.|[19] Six players have hit three home runs in a single game. 
Adrian Gonzalez became the first to accomplish the offensive feat on May 
24, 2005, at Albuquerque. He went 3-for-4 with five RBI. All three of Nelson 
Cruz's hits on July 19, 2008, against Memphis were home runs. He went 3-for-5 
with five RBI in the game. Nate Gold went 4-for-5 with three homers and 
four RBI on July 28, 2008, at Colorado Springs. Chad Tracy hit three homers 
on June 27, 2010, against Omaha, finishing the game 3-for-3 with five RBI. 
Mike Hessman went 4-for-4 with three homers on June 3, 2012, against Iowa.[20] 
Matt Duffy went 3-for-4 with three homers and three RBI on June 9, 2014, 
against Salt Lake. The 2013 Redhawks made numerous entries into the club's 
record book. The RedHawks set the team record for most runs scored in a 
game at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark and tied the club record for most 
runs scored in a game overall in a 24–5 win against Colorado Springs on 
August 3, 2013.[21] The 2013 squad also compiled the longest overall and 
home winning streaks in club history. The RedHawks won 12 straight games 
overall from July 26 to August 6. They continued winning at home, stringing 
together 17 consecutive wins at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark from July 
26 to August 20.[22] The Dodgers broadcasts their games on the radio on 
1340 The Game. The team has had multiple broadcasters who advanced to the 
major league level. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches
