The Rice University athletic teams are known as the Rice Owls. The name 
comes from the owls in Rice's crest. Rice participates in NCAA Division 
I athletics and is part of Conference USA. Rice was a member of the Southwest 
Conference until its breakup in 1996. Rice then joined the Western Athletic 
Conference before joining C-USA on July 1, 2005. Rice is the fifth-smallest 
school competing in NCAA Division I FBS football measured by undergraduate 
enrollment, just above the University of Tulsa's 2,756 and the three FBS 
United States service academies's approximate 4,500. Rice's sports rivalry 
include cross-town University of Houston, and Tulane University. A member 
of Conference USA, Rice sponsors teams in eight men's and eight women's 
NCAA sanctioned sports:[2] Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate 
Sports The Rice baseball team is the school's top athletic program and 
one of the NCAA's top baseball programs, having won its conference the 
15 of the last 16 consecutive seasons stretching back to the final Southwest 
Conference championship in 1996.[3] The Owls won the College World Series 
in 2003 and finished third in both the 2006 and 2007 College World Series 
tournaments.[4] Rice now has made seven appearances in Omaha for the CWS. 
The team has played at on-campus Reckling Park since the 2000 season.[5] 
The Owls play at an on-campus football facility, Rice Stadium, which was 
the site of Super Bowl VIII and a speech by John F. Kennedy on September 
12, 1962 in which he challenged the nation to send a man to the moon by 
the end of the decade. Rice Stadium opened in 1950 with a capacity of 70,000 
seats. After improvements in 2006, the stadium is currently configured 
to seat 47,000 for football but can be readily reconfigured to its original 
capacity of 70,000,[6] more than the total number of Rice alumni, living 
and deceased.[7] The Owls began playing football in 1919 as a member of 
the Southwest Conference. Until 1950, when Rice Stadium was completed, 
they played at Rice Field, the site of which is now Rice Track/Soccer Stadium. 
During its first 40 years, Rice's football program was a regional and national 
powerhouse. By the early 1960s, the program found it difficult to compete 
against schools that were ten times its size or more—and in some cases, 
had more freshmen than Rice had undergraduates. In 2006, the football team 
played in the New Orleans Bowl, the first time the team had gone to a bowl 
game since 1961, ending the second-longest bowl drought in the country 
at the time. The Rice Owls play in the Western Division of Conference USA 
and are currently coached by David Bailiff. The Rice Owls finished the 
2008 Regular season with a 9-3 overall record (7-1 C-USA)--the first time 
they won more than seven games in over 40 years—and accepted a bid to play 
against Western Michigan University in the Texas Bowl on December 30 where 
they came away with a 38-14 victory for their first bowl victory since 
1954. At the end of the 2008 season wide receiver Jarett Dillard was named 
a 2nd Team All-American by the Football Writers Association, the first 
Rice Owl selected in 50 years. He has also been named an All-American by 
Sports Illustrated, CBSSports.com (where he was joined by fellow owls Chase 
Clement and James Casey), and Walter Camp. In 2013, Rice finally won its 
first outright football conference championship since 1957, when it defeated 
Marshall in the Conference USA championship game. Rice's men's basketball 
teams won 10 conference titles in the former Southwest Conference (1918, 
1935*, 1940, 1942*, 1943*, 1944*, 1945, 1949*, 1954*, 1970; * denotes shared 
title). Most recently, guard Morris Almond was selected in the 2007 NBA 
draft by the Utah Jazz. Rice has been more successful in their women's 
sports. In 2004-05, Rice sent its women's volleyball, soccer, and basketball 
teams to their respective NCAA tournaments. In 2005-06, the women's soccer, 
basketball, and tennis teams advanced to NCAA tournaments, and five individuals 
competed at the national championships in outdoor track and field. In 2006-07, 
the Rice women's basketball team made the NCAA tournament, while four Rice 
women's outdoor track and field athletes received individual NCAA berths, 
two of them earning All-America honors. In 2008-09, the Rice women's volleyball 
team went to NCAA playoffs again, where they played Wichita State in 08 
and TCU 09. In 2013, 2014, 2015 the Rice women's swimming team sent multiple 
swimmers to the NCAA Women's Division I Swimming and Diving Championships 
hosted in Indianapolis, Ind. Founded in 1968, the Rice Rugby Football Club 
plays college rugby in Division I-AA in the Southwest Conference (SWC) 
against its traditional rivals such as the University of Houston. Rice 
have been led since 2007 by Head Coach Mario Botha, who formerly played 
professional rugby in South Africa.[8] Rice won the Southwest Conference 
with a 6-0 conference record in 2013, advancing to the Division I-AA national 
playoffs.[9] Previously, Rice finished second in the Southwest Conference 
in 2012, losing 36-26 to the University of Texas in the conference championship.[10] 
Rice Rugby had a successful period during the late 1980s and throughout 
the 1990s, winning multiple Texas championships and producing players such 
as Mike Glass ('87) and Brannan Smoot ('89) who went on to play for the 
U.S. national rugby team.[11] Rice rugby has been supported since 1996 
by the Rice Rugby Alumni Association, which established an endowment fund 
in 1999 and since then has provided financial support to the team.[12] 
Rice Rugby advanced to the national playoffs in spring 2000 for the first 
time.[13] Rice has men's and women's ultimate teams. The women's team, 
named Torque, won consecutive national championships in Division III in 
2014 and 2015.[14] In addition to football, Rice Stadium also serves as 
the performance venue for the university's Marching Owl Band, or "MOB." 
Despite its name, the MOB is a scatter band which focuses on performing 
humorous skits and routines rather than traditional formation marching. 
Prior to the dissolution of the Southwest Conference, the MOB had a lesser 
rivalry with the "Fightin' Texas Aggie Band" from Texas A&M. Rice's mascot 
is Sammy the Owl. In previous decades, the university kept several live 
owls on campus in front of Lovett College, but this practice has been discontinued. 
Rice also has a fourteen-member coed cheerleading squad and an all-female 
dance team, both of which perform at football and basketball games throughout
