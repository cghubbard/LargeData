Hugh Bradley, born on May 23, 1885 in Grafton, Massachusetts, played first 
base in Major League Baseball from 1910 to 1915. On April 26, 1912 he hit 
the first ever home run at Fenway Park.[1] As a backup first baseman for 
the 1912 World Series champion Boston Red Sox, Bradley got off to a hot 
start to the season and had a chance to supplant manager Jake Stahl as 
the regular at the position, but his hitting fell off dramatically as the 
season went on.[2] Bradley died on January 26, 1949 in Worcester, Massachusetts.
