Kent Franklin Mercker (born February 1, 1968) is a retired American Major 
League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He played for nine teams over his 
seventeen-year career. Mercker was born in Dublin, Ohio. He was taken in 
the first round (5th pick overall) of the 1986 Major League Baseball Draft 
by the Atlanta Braves. He made his major league debut with the Braves on 
September 22, 1989, and appeared in two games that season. During his years 
with the Braves, Mercker split time between the bullpen and the starting 
rotation. After serving as a reliever for the vast part of his first five 
seasons, he joined the Braves' rotation full-time for the 1994 and 1995 
seasons. After the 1995 season, the Braves traded Mercker to the Baltimore 
Orioles. Mercker then became a journeyman, spending time with Baltimore 
(1996), Cleveland (1996), Cincinnati (1997, 2003, 2005-2006, 2008), St. 
Louis (1998-1999), Boston (1999), Anaheim (2000), Colorado (2002), Atlanta 
(2003), and the Chicago Cubs (2004). During the 2004 season, Mercker reportedly 
called the broadcast booth to complain about commentary by Steve Stone 
and, along with Moisés Alou, confronted Stone on a team flight. He signed 
with Cincinnati for the third time in his career on December 20, 2004.[1] 
Mercker received the Tony Conigliaro Award in 2000 following his recovery 
from a cerebral hemorrhage. Mercker has taken part in two no-hit games 
during his career, both with the Braves. The first, on September 11, 1991 
against the San Diego Padres at Fulton County Stadium, was a combined effort 
between Mercker, the starter, who pitched six innings; Mark Wohlers, who 
pitched the seventh and eighth innings; and Alejandro Peña, who pitched 
the ninth. The Braves defeated the Padres 1-0. The second no-hitter was 
a solo effort by Mercker, as he no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 
8, 1994 at Dodger Stadium in a 6-0 victory. To date, this no-hitter is 
the last to be pitched by a Brave.[2] On February 8, 2008, Mercker signed 
a minor league contract with Cincinnati with an invitation to spring training.[3] 
He pitched in 15 games for the Reds that season. He currently works as
