Timothy Charles Wallach (born September 14, 1957), nicknamed "Eli" in reference 
to actor Eli Wallach,[1] is a former third baseman in Major League Baseball 
who played from 1980 to 1996 for the Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Dodgers, 
and California Angels. He is currently the bench coach for the Miami Marlins. 
Wallach grew up in Tustin, California and attended high school at University 
High School in neighboring Irvine, California.[2] The young student did 
not attend his hometown Tustin High School and instead was enrolled at 
University High School in an effort by the school district to increase 
the student population of the then-newly opened Irvine high school.[2] 
There he played on the school's lower level baseball team during his freshman 
and sophomore years before being promoted to the varsity team for his last 
two years.[2] Upon graduating in 1975, the aspiring young baseball player 
enrolled at the nearby Saddleback College and transferred to California 
State University, Fullerton.[2] Though Wallach was passed over from being 
signed to the major leagues out of high school, he soon caught the attention 
of scouts as a member of the university's Titans baseball team. He led 
the team to its first Division I title in 1979 while being awarded the 
USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award, selected on the 1979 College Baseball 
All-America Team and named the Sporting News College Player of the Year.[2] 
He won three Gold Glove awards for defensive excellence and two Silver 
Slugger awards for offensive excellence. He was named to five All-Star 
teams. Wallach spent the majority of his career with the Expos, forming 
a potent lineup with teammates Tim Raines, Gary Carter and Andre Dawson. 
He was voted the Montreal Expos Player of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990. 
Bill James has referred to Wallach as a "poor man's Brooks Robinson", largely 
because of his defensive skills.[3] With the Expos on September 6, 1980, 
Wallach hit a home run in his first major league at bat. He was the first 
player from Cal State Fullerton to do this. On September 6, 2011, Brett 
Pill of the San Francisco Giants became the second player from Cal State 
Fullerton to also hit a home run in his first at bat in the major league. 
In 8099 career at-bats, Wallach had 2085 hits. He batted .257 with 260 
home runs and 1125 RBI. Wallach had 908 career runs scored. He was the 
equal third last Major League Baseball player to wear a flapless batting 
helmet, after Tim Raines and Gary Gaetti and equal with Ozzie Smith.[4] 
On Saturday June 21, 2014, Tim Wallach was inducted into the Canadian Baseball 
Hall of Fame, in St. Marys, Ontario, along with former Montreal Expos play-by-play 
announcer Dave Van Horne and former Montreal Expos general manager Murray 
Cook.[5] In 2004 and 2005, Wallach was the hitting coach of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. When Grady Little became the manager and replaced Jim Tracy in 
December 2005, Wallach remained hitting coach until he was replaced by 
Eddie Murray. On January 12, 2009, he was named the manager for the Triple-A 
Albuquerque Isotopes in the Dodgers organization.[6] He led the Isotopes 
into the playoffs with a franchise record 80 wins and was named as Pacific 
Coast League Manager of the Year.[7] On November 22, 2010, he was named 
the new third base coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In late 2013, Wallach 
interviewed for managerial jobs with the Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners. 
When he missed out on those jobs, the Dodgers announced that he would be 
promoted to bench coach for the 2014 season.[8] On December 4, 2015, he 
was announced as the new bench coach for the Miami Marlins.[9] Tim has 
three sons (Matt, Brett and Chad) with his wife, Lori. Matt was drafted 
by the Dodgers in the 22nd round of the 2007 MLB draft as a catcher out 
of California State University Fullerton. Brett was drafted by the Dodgers 
as a pitcher in the 3rd round of the 2009 MLB draft out of Orange Coast 
College and then traded to the Chicago Cubs in 2010. Chad was a catcher 
for California State University Fullerton who was selected by the Miami 
Marlins in the 5th round of the 2013 MLB draft and was traded to the Cincinnati 
Reds in 2014. Chad was named Miami Marlins Minor League Player of the Month 
for June 2014 and was the starting catcher for the South Atlantic League 
Northern Division All-Stars in June 2014 as a member of the Greensboro
