Long Branch is a beach side city in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United 
States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city's population was 
30,719,[9][10][11] reflecting a decline of 621 (-2.0%) from the 31,340 
counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 2,682 (+9.4%) 
from the 28,658 counted in the 1990 Census.[20] Long Branch was formed 
on April 11, 1867, as the Long Branch Commission, from portions of Ocean 
Township. Long Branch was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey 
Legislature on April 8, 1903, based on the results of a referendum, replacing 
the Long Branch Commission.[21] Long Branch was a beach resort town in 
the late 18th century, named for its location along a branch of the South 
Shrewsbury River.[22] In the 19th century it was a "Hollywood" of the east, 
where some of the greatest theatrical and other performers of the day gathered 
and performed. It was visited by presidents Chester A. Arthur, James A. 
Garfield, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford B. Hayes, William 
McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson.[23] Seven Presidents Park, a park near the 
beach, is named in honor of their visits. The Church of the Presidents, 
where all seven worshiped, is the only structure left in Long Branch associated 
with them.[24] President Garfield was brought to Long Branch in the hope 
that the fresh air and quiet might aid his recovery after being shot on 
July 2, 1881, an incident that left the assassin's bullet lodged in his 
spine. He died here on September 19, 1881, exactly two months before his 
50th birthday.[25] The Garfield Tea House, constructed from railroad ties 
that had been laid to carry Garfield's train, is in Elberon.[26] The famous 
Long Branch Saloon of the American Old West, located in Dodge City, Kansas, 
was given its name by its first owner, William Harris, who had moved west 
from Long Branch, New Jersey, his hometown.[27] Originally a resort town 
with a few hotels and large estates and many farms in the early 20th century, 
Long Branch grew in population. Italian, Irish and Jewish immigrants settled 
in during this period. By the 1950s, Long Branch like many other towns 
had developed new residential spots and housing to make room for the growing 
population. Many of the former farms of Long Branch were transformed into 
residential suburbs. Many of the estates and a few old historic resorts 
(with the addition of many new ones) still remain. With the ascendancy 
of Hollywood in California as a film capital, Long Branch lost much of 
its activity as a theater spot. In addition, the opening of the Garden 
State Parkway in the mid-1950s allowed shore visitors to access points 
further south, which added to Long Branch's decline. The civil unrest of 
the 1960s caused riots in neighboring Asbury Park, and many fled the shore 
cities for the suburban towns west of the beach. Decades later, the older, 
more dilapidated parts of the resort town were condemned and redeveloped, 
in part by using eminent domain legislation. Long Branch still continues 
to be a popular resort area. Many people from New York City travel or settle 
into the area to escape the crowded city and enjoy Long Branch's beaches. 
The area also attracts some tourists from the Philadelphia area as well. 
On October 29, 2012, Long Branch was one of many shore communities that 
were devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Although Sandy's winds were powerful, 
Long Branch's position between Long Beach Island and Sea Bright gave Long 
Branch a much larger wall of security because it could not be engulfed 
by surrounding waters. Despite this mainland advantage, there were still 
several instances of flooding in Long Branch during the storm. Many residents 
went without electricity for 9 to 15 days. The boardwalk was destroyed 
and the city plans to start rebuilding it in 2015 and finish by summer 
of 2016. It is the last boardwalk damaged by Sandy to be rebuilt, and is 
planned to match that of Pier Village.[28] Long Branch takes its name from 
the "long branch" or south branch of the Shrewsbury River.[29][30][31][32] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area 
of 6.283 square miles (16.274 km2), including 5.274 square miles (13.660 km2) 
of land and 1.009 square miles (2.614 km2) of water (16.06%).[1][2] The 
city borders the Monmouth County communities of Deal, Monmouth Beach, Ocean 
Township, Oceanport and West Long Branch.[33] There are several distinct 
neighborhoods and areas in the City of Long Branch, each with its own character. 
Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the city include Branchport, East Long Branch, Elberon 
(served as ZIP code 07740), Hollywood, Kensington Park, North Long Branch, 
Pleasure Bay and West End.[34] Other areas include North End (once known 
as "Atlanticville"), Beachfront North and South (including Pier Village, 
adjacent to the site of the former Long Branch Pier at the foot of Laird 
Street), Downtown and Uptown. As the city's redevelopment initiatives continue 
to expand, the lower Broadway area (a portion of the city's Downtown) will 
become an Arts District. In years past, Long Branch was a major destination 
for beachgoers, along with Asbury Park, and enjoyed an upscale connotation 
with tourists. Long Branch is home to Seven Presidents Oceanfront Park, 
named for the United States presidents who visited the fashionable resort 
town, including Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, Rutherford Hayes, 
Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, Woodrow Wilson and James Garfield.[35] 
Long Branch's fame as the Nation's First Seaside Resort waned in the years 
following World War II.[36] The defining moment marking the end of this 
era occurred on June 8, 1987 when the largest fire in the history of the 
city destroyed the landmark amusement pier and adjoining Haunted Mansion, 
"Kid's World" Amusement Park and other businesses.[37] Broadway Center 
is a planned entertainment and commercial hub of Long Branch, as envisioned 
by the City Government and Thompson Design Group, who created the Master 
Plan for the city. This complex is planned to offer retail shops, cafes, 
bars, restaurants and two performing arts theaters as well as 500 new residences 
sitting atop a 1,500 car parking garage. It will be designed by the architectural 
firms of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK).[38] In June 2013, the city 
approved designation of the area around its train station as a transit 
village, which can bring incentives for revitalization and denser development.[39] 
There are several mid-rise buildings lining the oceanfront.[30] In December 
2013 another 12-story residential project was approved.[40] Portions of 
Long Branch are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. In addition to other 
benefits to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage 
of a reduced 3½% sales tax rate (versus the 7% rate charged statewide) 
at eligible merchants.[41] At the 2010 United States Census, there were

schools are operated by the Long Branch Public Schools, serving children 
in pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade. The district is one of 31 former 
Abbott districts statewide,[84] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" 
based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building 
and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the 
New Jersey Schools Development Authority.[85][86] All Long Branch Public 
Schools are free, including the district's preschool programs which are 
full-day and accommodate children ages 3–5 years old. Long Branch schools 
offer free breakfast each morning for the students. In addition, Long Branch 
Public Schools provide free summer programs for most of the summer. As 
of the 2011-12 school year, the district's nine schools had an enrollment 
of 5,396 students and 505.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a 
student–teacher ratio of 10.67:1.[87] Schools in the district (with 2011-12 
enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics[88]) 
are Lenna W. Conrow School[89] (PreK and K; 369 students), Joseph Ferraina 
Early Childhood Learning Center[90] (PreK and K; 343), Morris Avenue School[91] 
(PreK and K; - was PreK-2; 433), Amerigo A. Anastasia School[92] (1-5 - 
was PreK-5; 749), George L. Catrambone Elementary School[93] (1-5 - new

an alternative education program[97] (was 3-5; 341 as Audrey W. Clark School).[98] 
George L. Catrambone Elementary School was constructed at a total cost 
over $40 million for a facility that was designed to house 800 students 
in a facility covering 109,000 square feet (10,100 m2) for which construction 
began in 2012.[99] With the start of the 2014-15 school year, a realignment 
of the district closed West End School, converted Morris Avenue School 
for early childhood use and repurposed Audrey W. Clark School for alternative 
education.[100] Seashore School is a private K-8 school, with class size 
limited to 16 students.[101] Declining attendance led the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Trenton to close the K-8 Holy Trinity School in June 2006.[102] 
The city had a total of 89.49 miles (144.02 km) of roadways, of which 80.10 
miles (128.91 km) were maintained by the municipality, 6.26 miles (10.07 km) 
by Monmouth County and 3.13 miles (5.04 km) by the New Jersey Department 
of Transportation.[103] Route 36 and Route 71 pass through the city. Long 
Branch is connected to New York City and Northern New Jersey via NJ Transit 
trains running on the North Jersey Coast Line.[104] The Long Branch station,[105] 
located three blocks away from the beach, marks the end of electrified 
trackage, with passengers continuing south must change to diesel-powered 
trains. A second station is located at Elberon district just north of the 
borough of Deal.[106] In the past there were stops in the West End neighborhood 
and on Broadway, but they were closed to reduce travel time to New York 
City. Local bus transportation is provided by NJ Transit on the 831 and 
837 routes.[107] People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely
