Arthur Pue Gorman (March 11, 1839 – June 4, 1906) was a United States Senator 
from Maryland, serving from 1881 to 1899 and from 1903 to 1906. He also 
served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1869 to 1875, and the Maryland 
State Senate to 1881.[1] He was a prominent leader of the Democratic Party 
and later served as a member of the "Mills Commission" which investigated 
the origins of baseball.[2] Gorman was born in Woodstock, Maryland on March 
11, 1839, to parents Peter and Elizabeth A. Gorman (née Brown). The oldest 
of five children, he was named after the family's physician, Dr. Arthur 
Pue.[2] Gorman's paternal grandfather, John, emigrated to the U.S. from 
Ireland circa 1794, first settling in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania before moving 
to the Baltimore area.[2] Arthur's immediate family, including younger 
brother William Henry Gorman, moved to Laurel, Maryland[3][4] in 1848, 
where they had a 150-acre (61 ha) farm.[2] Arthur had attended public schools 
though there were none in Laurel; Gorman's father hired a succession of 
tutors until arranging with Congressman William T. Hamilton and Edward 
Hammond a position for his son as a U.S. Senate page at age 11 in 1850.[2] 
Gorman became friends with Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas (famous 
regular Democratic presidential candidate in the split Election of 1860 
versus Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln whom he earlier debated in 
a series of debates for the Illinois seat in the U.S. Senate), who made 
him his private secretary.[2] Gorman subsequently served the U.S. Senate 
in various offices as page, messenger, Assistant Doorkeeper, Assistant 
Postmaster, and finally Postmaster.[5] At the age of 20 in 1859, Gorman 
was one of the founding members of the Washington Nationals Base Ball Club, 
the first official baseball team in America, and rose to become a star 
by the end of the Civil War era.[6] Eventually he would become president 
of the National Association of Base Ball Players.[2] In September 1866, 
Gorman was removed from his Senate Office of Postmaster and was immediately 
appointed Collector of Internal Revenue for the Fifth Congressional District 
of Maryland.[2] Gorman married a widow, Hannah "Hattie" Donagan (1836–1910, 
formerly Schwartz),[7] on March 28, 1867. They would have six children: 
Haddie, Ada, Grace, Arthur P. Jr., Anne Elizabeth (Bessie), and Mary.[2] 
In 1890, Gorman's wife and daughter Grace escaped a fire at their Laurel 
house "Fairview" that his father built; a new Queen Anne style house was 
built in its place.[8][9][10] Gorman was closely aligned with Baltimore 
political leader Isaac Freeman Rasin. Rasin helped support Oden Bowie's 
rival William Pinkney Whyte in the 1871 Maryland Governor race with vote 
buying in Baltimore city. Whyte in turn gave Gorman a position as director 
of the C&O Canal.[11] Gorman served as a director and eventually president 
of the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal Company;[12] the canal ran along the north 
shore of the Potomac River from Georgetown above Washington, D.C. to Cumberland, 
Maryland. Gorman was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1869, 
serving until 1875; he served as Speaker of the House for one session. 
In 1875, he was elected to the Maryland State Senate, serving until 1881.[5] 
In 1880, Gorman was elected to the United States Senate, where he soon 
became a leader of the Bourbon Democrat wing of the Democratic Party. The 
New York Times reported the election was influenced by large groups of 
"ward rounders" who shot and wounded black Republican voters at the Howard 
County polls.[13] In 1884 Gorman worked on Grover Cleveland's bid for presidency.[14] 
He served as the Democratic caucus chairman from 1890 to 1898, as the chairman 
of the Senate Committee on Printing (in the Fifty-third Congress), and 
as a member of the Senate Committee on Private Land Claims (Fifty-fifth 
Congress).[5] In 1889, Gorman sought to differentiate his party from a 
growing racially mixed independent-Democrat/Republican coalition. He was 
quoted saying "We have determined that this government was made by white 
men and shall be ruled by white men as long as the republic lasts".[15] 
He played a major role in financial and tariff legislation, especially 
the Wilson-Gorman Tariff of 1894, where he defeated President Grover Cleveland's 
low tariff goals by raising the tariff to thwart competition with industry 
in his state. Gorman was reelected twice more in 1886 and 1892[5] (then 
by the state General Assembly), but was defeated for re-election in 1898, 
losing to Louis E. McComas. After his defeat, Gorman campaigned for the 
other Maryland U.S. Senate seat, and was elected to the U.S. Senate again 
by the Legislature in 1902.[citation needed] He was again appointed as 
the Democratic Caucus Chairman, which he held from 1903 to 1906.[5] Gorman 
was briefly a candidate for U.S. President in 1892 and 1904.[16] In 1903–1905, 
per a Maryland State biography, Gorman "spearheaded an attempt by Democrats 
to disenfranchise black voters in Maryland, who tended to vote Republican." 
Related legislation passed easily in the Democratically controlled Senate 
of early 1904, though Governor Warfield did not sign the bill into law, 
and it was rejected by voters in late 1905.[12] Gorman served as a U.S. 
senator until his death from a heart attack in Washington, D.C. on June 
4, 1906.[12] He had been ill with stomach trouble and hadn't left his Washington 
house since mid-January.[16][17] Gorman, Maryland and Gormania, West Virginia, 
are named after him,[18] as is Gorman Road in North Laurel.[19] An elementary 
school near this road is named "Gorman Crossing".[19] Gorman's daughter, 
Haddie (1869–1923),[20] married Stephen Warfield Gambrill[21] in 1900. 
He later became a Maryland state delegate and senator before service in 
the U.S. House of Representatives from 1924 to his death in 1938.[22] Gorman's 
daughter, Ada (1870–1950), married Charles Joseph Magness, a young man 
about half her age,[23][24][25] on September 5, 1908, against her family's 
wishes. Magness was soon thereafter imprisoned for desertion from the U.S. 
Navy. Upon his release a year later, the couple lived in Washington, D.C., 
and then the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville.[26] When her mother died 
in 1910, Ada was cut off from her share of the Gorman family estate.[27] 
The marriage lasted a total of 14 years before Ada divorced in 1922 due 
to her husband's infidelity.[26][28] She died childless and with few friends 
in the spring of 1950;[26] her gravestone reads only "A.G.M."[29] Gorman's 
daughter, Grace (1871–1958), who went by the name "Daisy", lived at the 
historic Overlook farm house in North Laurel on land inherited by her father. 
The town of Daisy in Howard County, Maryland is named after her. In 1895, 
Grace married Richard Alward Johnson (1871–1918), the first manager of 
the Laurel race track and a Maryland state senator during his last few 
years.[30][31][32] They had two children, Richard A. Johnson, Jr. (1902–1966), 
and Grace Louise Johnson.[32] Richard Jr. raised and trained horses.[33] 
His sister Grace (1898–1977) married Braxton Bragg Comer, Jr.[34][35] (1888–1954),[36] 
son of former Alabama governor B. B. Comer, in April 1918 and had a son 
Richard Johnson Comer[35] (born 1919) who married Annie Laurie Comer[37] 
(born 1919) and had two children: Grace Louise Comer (born 1945) and Richard 
Johnson Comer, Jr. (born 1947). Gorman's son, Arthur Pue Gorman, Jr. (1873–1919), 
attended Lawrenceville Prep and traveled to the Maryland Agricultural College 
(now the University of Maryland at College Park), where he played on the 
"Aggies" football team in 1892 and 1893 as a fullback and served as an 
assistant coach.[38] He formed the Piedmont Mining Company in 1898 along 
with his uncle William Henry Gorman and Thomas L. Marriott, with operations 
in Maryland and West Virginia.[39] He married Grace Norris on November 
28, 1900,[40] and served as a Maryland State Senator (1904–1910), the last 
year during which he was Senate President.[41] Arthur Jr. was nominated 
over Blair Lee as the Democratic candidate for Maryland governor in 1911,[42] 
though lost in a close race against Republican Phillips Lee Goldsborough.[43] 
He was later a State Tax Commissioner until his death in 1919[44][45] due 
to complications from diabetes.[46] Gorman's daughter, Bessie (1875–1959), 
married Wilton J. Lambert (1871–1935) on June 24, 1896,[47] at the Gorman's 
Washington home on the corner of 15th and K Streets.[48] Lambert was a 
member of the Princeton class of 1892 and described himself to fellow alumni 
fifteen years later as a Maryland Democratic party speech-writer.[49] Lambert's 
alumni bio included that he completed his legal studies at Georgetown University; 
lived in Washington, D.C., at 1620 S Street N.W; represented the District 
at the St. Louis Exposition; and had two children: Elizabeth (b. 1897) 
and Arthur.[50] An attorney, Lambert helped Arthur Gorman attempt to buy 
the Washington Senators baseball team in February 1903.[2] His son, Arthur 
Gorman Lambert (1899–1991), was a member of Princeton's class of 1922, 
also practiced law, and founded Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland;[51] 
he unveiled a donated portrait of his grandfather, Arthur Pue Gorman, at 
the Capitol in 1943.[52] Gorman's daughter, Mary (1876–1944),[53] married 
Ralph Warren Hills[7] (1875–1940)[54] on February 27, 1901. Their son, 
Ralph Gorman Hills (1902–1977),[55][56] won a bronze medal for shot put 
at the 1924 Summer Olympics. The following year, he graduated from Princeton 
University, after which he earned an M.D. degree from Johns Hopkins University 
and became a doctor;[57] his first son, J. Dixon Hills,[58] also chose 
to become a physician.[55] His second son and great-grandson of Gorman, 
named Ralph Warren Hills (1939–2012),[59] also attended Princeton and was 
a WBAL television producer in Baltimore.[58][60][61] The repair ship USS 
Tutuila was originally named SS Arthur P. Gorman in August 1943.[62] In 
2000, a proposed neighborhood within Columbia, Maryland's Kings Contrivance 
section was to have been named "Gorman's Promise", though when the former 
U.S. senator's attempts at black voter disenfranchisement were made known,
