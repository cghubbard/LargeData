The Anaheim Angels' 2002 season was the franchise's 42nd, and it ended 
with the team's first American League pennant and World Series championship. 
The Angels finished the regular season with a record of 99-63, 4 games 
behind the Oakland Athletics in the American League West standings, but 
qualified for the franchise's first ever wild card playoff berth to return 
to the postseason for the first time since 1986. Outfielder Garret Anderson 
led the team with 123 runs batted in and a .539 slugging percentage, was 
selected for the AL All-Star team, and won the Silver Slugger Award. Jarrod 
Washburn went 18-6 with a 3.15 earned run average to anchor a pitching 
staff that allowed the fewest runs in the league. In the postseason, the 
Angels defeated the New York Yankees 3-1 in the American League Division 
Series, then defeated the Minnesota Twins 4-1 in the American League Championship 
Series to win the AL pennant. The Angels then won the World Series in dramatic 
fashion when, with a 3-2 series deficit to the San Francisco Giants, they 
overcame a 5 run deficit in the late innings of Game 6 to force a winner-take-all 
Game 7, which they won to clinch the series 4-3. The morning after the 
win, The Orange County Register celebrated the Angels' win with the headline 
"7th Heaven,"[1] referring to the popular television series and fact that 
it took seven games for the Angels to win the World Series, and in doing 
so, it sent them to seventh heaven.[2] 2002 was also notable as the season 
in which the Angels debuted their present-day uniforms, colors, and halo 
insignia, which replaced the widely ridiculed "periwinkle" uniforms and 
"winged" insignia they had worn since 1997. It was also the last full season 
the team was owned by The Walt Disney Company, which sold its controlling 
interest in the team to present-day owner Arte Moreno in May 2003. The 
Anaheim Angels focus in the off season leading up to the 2002 season was 
on how to improve the Angels from the 2001 season when they finished an 
incredible 41 games behind the Seattle Mariners (who won an American League 
record 116 games) in the AL West. The Anaheim Angels' 2002 Spring training 
was Tempe Diablo Stadium in Tempe, Arizona and held a Spring training record 
of 17-15. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]

over the Texas Rangers on Mon. September 26, 2002, the Angels clinched 
their first (and only to date as of 2015) Wildcard berth. At this time, 
the Angels would be in the postseason for the first time since the 1986 
season. The 2002 American League Division Series featured the Wildcard 
winner Anaheim Angels and the AL East champion New York Yankees. The series 
began on October 1, 2002 with the Angels splitting the first two games 
at Yankee Stadium. The Angels then proceeded to win the next two games, 
earning their ticket to the ALCS and winning their first postseason series 
in franchise history. The 2002 American League Championship Series featured 
the Wildcard winner Anaheim Angels and the AL Central champion Minnesota 
Twins. The series began on October 8, 2002 with the Angels splitting the 
first two games at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The Angels then went 
home where they won three straight at Edison Field to earn a spot in the 
2002 World Series. Infielder Adam Kennedy was the ALCS MVP. The 2002 World 
Series was the 98th edition of the Fall Classic, held from October 19–27, 
2002. The series featured the American League champion Anaheim Angels defeating 
the National League champion San Francisco Giants, 4–3, to win the franchise's 
first ever World Series. The series was notable as being the first time 
since the 1995 inception of the wild card in Major League Baseball that 
two wild card teams would vie for the title. It was also the fourth World 
Series played between two teams from California (after 1974, 1988, and 
1989, when the Giants last went to the World Series), and the first such 
series to not include the Oakland Athletics. It was also the last Series 
to be played in a full seven games until 2011. The series was played as 
a best-of-seven playoff with a 2–3–2 site format (standard in Major League 
Baseball). Barry Bonds of the Giants was almost elected World Series MVP 
before the Angels began their Game 6 comeback; the award would be presented 
the following night to Troy Glaus of the Angels for his role in that comeback. 
(Bobby Richardson of the 1960 New York Yankees remains the only World Series 
MVP from a losing team.) October 19, 2002 at Edison International Field

Major League Baseball's playoff format automatically seeds the Wild Card 
team 4th. Normally, the No. 1 seed plays the No. 4 seed in the Division 
Series. However, MLB does not allow the No. 1 seed to play the 4th seed/Wild 
Card winner in the Division Series if they are from the same division, 
instead having the No. 1 seed play the next lowest seed, the No. 3 seed.
