Oakland Park was the name used for a ballpark used by the New York Giants 
for two games in 1889.[1] While the team was evicted from the Polo Grounds, 
the Giants split their season's home games between the St. George Cricket 
Grounds in Staten Island and Oakland Park in Jersey City, New Jersey. The 
park was located at the corner of Oakland and Hoboken Avenues. The games 
were played on April 24 and April 25 against the Boston Braves. The games 
were split between the two teams. Coordinates: 40°44′02″N 74°03′22″W﻿ /
