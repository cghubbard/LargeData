The 2000 Chicago Cubs season was the 129th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 125th in the National League and the 85th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished sixth and last in the National League Central with a record of 
65â€“97. During this season, the Cubs played in the first game held outside 
of North America on Opening Day. The Cubs played the New York Mets in front 
of over 55,000 at the Tokyodome in Japan. The Cubs won the game by a score 
of 5-3.[1] On May 11, 2000 Glenallen Hill was responsible for a memorable 
event in the annals of Chicago Cubs baseball lore. On that day Hill became 
the first, and thus far only player, to hit a pitched ball onto the roof 
of a five-story residential building across the street from the left field 
wall of Wrigley Field. Sammy Sosa, despite hitting only 50 home runs (he 
had hit over 60 the previous two seasons) won his only home run crown.
