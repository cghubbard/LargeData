as the state's 14th-most populous county. The percentage increase in the 
county's population between 2000 and 2010 was the largest in New Jersey, 
almost triple the statewide increase of 4.5%, and the absolute increase 
in residents was the third highest.[5][6] Its county seat is Woodbury.[1][7] 
Gloucester County is located south of Philadelphia and northwest of Atlantic 
City. It is part of the Camden, New Jersey Metropolitan Division of the 
Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area[8] 
as well as the Delaware Valley Combined Statistical Area.[9] According 
to the 2010 Census, the county had a total area of 337.18 square miles 
(873.3 km2), including 322.00 square miles (834.0 km2) of land (95.5%) 
and 15.17 square miles (39.3 km2) of water (4.5%).[10] Gloucester County 
is largely composed of low-lying rivers and coastal plains. The highest 
elevation in the county is a slight rise along County Route 654 southeast 
of Cross Keys that reaches approximately 180 feet (55 m) above sea level;[11] 
the lowest point is at sea level on the Delaware River. Swedesboro and 
Bridgeport were the among the earliest European settlements in New Jersey 
as a part of the 17th century New Sweden colony. Gloucester dates back 
to May 26, 1686, when courts were established separate from those of Burlington. 
It was officially formed and its boundaries defined as part of West Jersey 
on May 17, 1694. Portions of Gloucester County were set off on February 
7, 1837, to create Atlantic County, and on March 13, 1844 to create Camden 
County.[12] The county was named for the city of Gloucester / county of 
Gloucestershire in England.[13] Woodbury, founded in 1683 by Henry Wood, 
is the oldest municipality in the county.[14] National Park, another town 
in the county, was the site of the Revolutionary War Battle of Red Bank 
where Fort Mercer once stood. It is now the site of Red Bank Battlefield 
Park and the remains of the HMS Augusta laid there until they were moved 
and subsequently re sunk in Gloucester City on their way to Philadelphia. 
During the colonial era, Gloucester County's main economic activity was 
agriculture. Woodbury was the site of the county courthouse, the county 
jail, a Quaker meeting house (still in existence), and an inn (on the current 
location of Woodbury Crossings). Because of the county's many creeks leading 
to the Delaware River and the Atlantic Ocean, smuggling was very common.
