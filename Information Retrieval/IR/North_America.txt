North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and 
almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern 
subcontinent of the Americas.[2][3] It is bordered to the north by the 
Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south 
by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean 
Sea. North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers 
(9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the earth's land area and about 
4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third largest continent 
by area, following Asia and Africa,[4] and the fourth by population after 
Asia, Africa, and Europe.[5] In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 
565 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's 
population, if nearby islands (most notably the Caribbean) are included. 
North America was reached by its first human populations during the last 
glacial period, via crossing the Bering land bridge. The so-called Paleo-Indian 
period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago (the beginning 
of the Archaic or Meso-Indian period). The Classic stage spans roughly 
the 6th to 13th centuries. The Pre-Columbian era ended with the arrival 
of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the Early Modern period. 
Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect different kind of interactions 
between European colonists, indigenous peoples, African slaves and their 
descendants. European influences are strongest in the northern parts of 
the continent while indigenous and African influences are relatively stronger 
in the south. Because of the history of colonialism, most North Americans 
speak English, Spanish or French and societies and states commonly reflect 
Western traditions. The Americas are usually accepted as having been named 
after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by the German cartographers 
Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann.[6] Vespucci, who explored South 
America between 1497 and 1502, was the first European to suggest that the 
Americas were not the East Indies, but a different landmass previously 
unknown by Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller produced a world map, in which 
he placed the word "America" on the continent of South America, in the 
middle of what is today Brazil. He explained the rationale for the name 
in the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio:[7] ... ab Americo inventore 
... quasi Americi terram sive Americam (from Americus the discoverer ... 
as if it were the land of Americus, thus America). For Waldseemüller, no 
one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer. He used 
the Latinized version of Vespucci's name (Americus Vespucius), but in its 
feminine form "America", following the examples of "Europa", "Asia" and 
"Africa". Later, other mapmakers extended the name America to the northern 
continent, In 1538, Gerard Mercator used America on his map of the world 
for all the Western Hemisphere.[8] Some argue that the convention is to 
use the surname for naming discoveries except in the case of royalty and 
so a derivation from "Amerigo Vespucci" could be problematic.[9] Ricardo 
Palma (1949) proposed a derivation from the "Amerrique" mountains of Central 
America—Vespucci was the first to discover South America and the Amerrique 
mountains of Central America, which connected his discoveries to those 
of Christopher Columbus. Alfred E. Hudd proposed a theory in 1908 that 
the continents are named after a Welsh merchant named Richard Amerike from 
Bristol, who is believed to have financed John Cabot's voyage of discovery 
from England to Newfoundland in 1497. A minutely explored belief that has 
been advanced is that America was named for a Spanish sailor bearing the 
ancient Visigothic name of 'Amairick'. Another is that the name is rooted 
in a Native American language.[8] The term North America maintains various 
definitions in accordance with location and context. In Canadian English, 
North America may be used to refer to the United States and Canada together.[10] 
Alternatively, usage sometimes includes Greenland[11][12][13] and Mexico 
(as in the North American Free Trade Agreement),[12][14][15][16][17] as 
well as offshore islands. The UN geoscheme for "North America" separates 
Mexico from the United States and Canada, placing it instead within its 
designated "Central America" region, while also treating the islands of 
the Caribbean separately from the US/Canada definition—the UN's "North 
America" definition still includes the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and 
Greenland together with the US/Canada continental definition, with both 
insular entities being tectonically on the North American plate. In Iran, 
and several Romance-language cultures, the cognates of North America usually 
designate a subcontinent of the Americas comprising Canada, the United 
States, and Mexico, and often Greenland, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, and 
Bermuda.[18] North America has been historically referred to by other names. 
Spanish North America (New Spain) was often referred to as Northern America, 
and this was the first official name given to Mexico.[19] Geographically 
the North American continent has many regions and subregions. These include 
cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions included those 
formed by trade blocs, such as the North American Trade Agreement bloc 
and Central American Trade Agreement. Linguistically and culturally, the 
continent could be divided into Anglo-America and Latin America. Anglo-America 
includes most of Northern America, Belize, and Caribbean islands with English-speaking 
populations (though sub-national entities, such as Louisiana and Quebec, 
are Francophone in composition). The southern North American continent 
is composed of two regions. These are Central America and the Caribbean.[20][21] 
The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast 
to the common definition of "North America", that which encompasses the 
whole continent, the term "North America" is also used to refer to Canada, 
Mexico, the United States, and Greenland.[11][12][13][14][22] The term 
Northern America refers to the northern-most countries and territories 
of North America, Canada, the United States, Greenland, Bermuda, and St. 
Pierre and Miquelon.[23][24] Although rarely used,[citation needed] the 
term Middle America—not to be confused with the Midwestern United States—groups 
the regions of Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico.[25] The largest 
countries of the continent, Canada and the United States, also contain 
well-defined and recognized regions. In the case of Canada these are the 
British Columbia Coast, Canadian Prairies, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, 
and Northern Canada. These regions also contain many subregions. In the 
case of the United States – and in accordance with the US Census Bureau 
definitions – these regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, East North 
Central States, West North Central States, South Atlantic States, East 
South Central States, West South Central States, Mountain States, and Pacific 
States. Regions shared between both nations included the Great Lakes Region. 
Megalopolises have also formed between both nations in the case of the 
Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes Megaregion. Laurentia is an ancient 
craton which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 
1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the Proterozoic eon.[33] The Canadian 
Shield is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late Paleozoic 
to Early Mesozoic eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day 
continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea, with Eurasia to its east. 
One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains, 
which formed some 480 million years ago, making it among the oldest mountain 
ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 million years 
ago, North America became part of Laurasia, before it separated from Eurasia 
as its own continent during the mid-Cretaceous period.[34] The Rockies 
and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a 
period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny, between 80 and 
55 million years ago. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama that connected 
the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 
million years ago,[35] and the Great Lakes (as well as many other northern 
freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 
years ago. North America is the source of much of what humanity knows about 
geologic time periods.[36] The geographic area that would later become 
the United States has been the source of more varieties of dinosaurs than 
any other modern country.[36] According to paleontologist Peter Dodson, 
this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, 
and history.[36] Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops 
in the many arid regions of the continent.[36] The most significant Late 
Jurassic dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the Morrison 
Formation of the western United States.[37] The indigenous peoples of North 
America have many creation myths by which they assert that they have been 
present on the land since its creation.[38] The specifics of Paleo-Indian 
migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and 
routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion.[39] The 
traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the Beringia 
land bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 25,000 
to 11,000 years ago.[40] The few agreements achieved to date are the origin 
from Central Asia, with widespread habitation of the Americas during the 
end of the last glacial period, or more specifically what is known as the 
late glacial maximum, around 13,000 years before present.[41] Some genetic 
research indicated secondary waves of migration occurred after the initial 
Paleo-Indian colonization,[42] but prior to modern Inuit, Inupiat and Yupik 
expansions.[43] Before contact with Europeans, the natives of North America 
were divided into many different polities, from small bands of a few families 
to large empires. They lived in several "culture areas", which roughly 
correspond to geographic and biological zones and give a good indication 
of the main lifeway or occupation of the people who lived there (e.g., 
the bison hunters of the Great Plains, or the farmers of Mesoamerica). 
Native groups can also be classified by their language family (e.g., Athapascan 
or Uto-Aztecan). Peoples with similar languages did not always share the 
same material culture, nor were they always allies. Anthropologists think 
that the Inuit people of the high Arctic came to North America much later 
than other native groups, as evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture 
artifacts from the archaeological record, and their replacement by the 
Thule people. During the thousands of years of native habitation on the 
continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest cultures yet 
found is the Clovis culture of modern New Mexico. Later cultures include 
the Mississippian culture and related Mound building cultures, found in 
the Mississippi river valley and the Pueblo culture of what is now the 
Four Corners. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible 
for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world, such 
as tomatoes and squash. Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one 
of the world's major staples, maize (corn). The earliest verifiable instance 
of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact by any European culture with the 
landmasses that geologically constitute the "mainland" of modern North 
America has been dated to the end of the 10th century CE - this site, situated 
at the northernmost extent of the island named Newfoundland, is known as 
L'Anse aux Meadows, where unmistakable evidence of Norse settlement was 
uncovered in the early 1960s.[44] As a result of the development of agriculture 
in the south, many important cultural advances were made there. For example, 
the Maya civilization developed a writing system, built huge pyramids and 
temples, had a complex calendar, and developed the concept of zero around 
400 CE, a few hundred years after the Mesopotamians.[45] The Mayan culture 
was still present in southern Mexico and Guatemala when the Spanish explorers 
arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire 
whose capital city Tenochtitlan was located further north in the Valley 
of Mexico. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by Hernán Cortés.[46] During 
the Age of Discovery, Europeans explored and staked claims to various parts 
of North America. Upon their arrival in the "New World", the Native American 
population declined substantially, because of violent conflicts with the 
invaders and the introduction of European diseases to which the Native 
Americans lacked immunity.[47] Native culture changed drastically and their 
affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic 
groups died out, and others changed quite quickly. The names and cultures 
that Europeans recorded were not necessarily the same as the names they 
had used a few generations before, or the ones in use today. Britain, Spain, 
and France took over extensive territories in North America - and fought 
over them. In the late 18th century and beginning of the 19th, independence 
movements that sprung up across the continent, led to the creation of the 
modern countries in the area. The 13 British colonies on the North Atlantic 
coast declared independence in 1776, becoming the United States of America. 
Canada was formed from the unification of northern territories controlled 
by Britain and France. New Spain, a territory that stretched from modern-day 
southern US to Central America, declared independence in 1810, becoming 
the First Mexican Empire. In 1823 the former Captaincy General of Guatemala, 
then part of the Mexican Empire, became the first independent state in 
Central America, officially changing its name to the United Provinces of 
Central America. North America occupies the northern portion of the landmass 
generally referred to as the New World, the Western Hemisphere, the Americas, 
or simply America (which, less commonly, is considered by some as a single 
continent[48][49][50] with North America a subcontinent).[51] North America's 
only land connection to South America is at the Isthmus of Panama. The 
continent is delimited on the southeast by most geographers at the Darién 
watershed along the Colombia-Panama border, placing all of Panama within 
North America.[52][53][54] Alternatively, some geologists physiographically 
locate its southern limit at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, with Central 
America extending southeastward to South America from this point.[55] The 
Caribbean islands, or West Indies, are considered part of North America.[2] 
The continental coastline is long and irregular. The Gulf of Mexico is 
the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by Hudson Bay. 
Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California. Before 
the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The 
islands of the West Indies delineate a submerged former land bridge, which 
had connected North and South America via what are now Florida and Venezuela. 
There are numerous islands off the continent's coasts; principally, the 
Arctic Archipelago, the Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, the Greater and Lesser 
Antilles, the Aleutian Islands (some of which are in the Eastern Hemisphere 
proper), the Alexander Archipelago, the many thousand islands of the British 
Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, 
and the world's largest, is on the same tectonic plate (the North American 
Plate) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, 
Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island which was formed 
on the fissure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge over 100 million years ago. The 
nearest landmass to it is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. However, Bermuda 
is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, 
political and cultural ties to Virginia and other parts of the continent. 
The vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts 
of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of California, including 
the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, and Santa Cruz, lie on the eastern 
edge of the Pacific Plate, with the two plates meeting along the San Andreas 
fault. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies 
lie on the Caribbean Plate, whereas the Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates border 
the North American Plate on its western frontier. The continent can be 
divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): 
the Great Plains stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian Arctic; 
the geologically young, mountainous west, including the Rocky Mountains, 
the Great Basin, California and Alaska; the raised but relatively flat 
plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern 
region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along 
the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long 
plateaus and cordilleras, falls largely in the western region, although 
the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf. The western 
mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and 
the coast ranges in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, 
with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying 
deserts—in between. The highest peak is Denali in Alaska. The United States 
Geographical Survey (USGS) states that the geographic center of North America 
is "6 miles [10 km] west of Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota" at about 
48°10′N 100°10′W﻿ / ﻿48.167°N 100.167°W﻿ / 48.167; -100.167, about 24 kilometres 
(15 mi) from Rugby, North Dakota. The USGS further states that "No marked 
or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the 
geographic center of either the 50 States, the conterminous United States, 
or the North American continent." Nonetheless, there is a 4.6-metre (15 ft) 
field stone obelisk in Rugby claiming to mark the center. The North American 
continental pole of inaccessibility is located 1,650 km (1,030 mi) from 
the nearest coastline, between Allen and Kyle, South Dakota at 43°22′N 
101°58′W﻿ / ﻿43.36°N 101.97°W﻿ / 43.36; -101.97﻿ (Pole of Inaccessibility 
North America).[56] Geologically, Canada is one of the oldest regions in 
the world, with more than half of the region consisting of precambrian 
rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the Palaeozoic 
era.[57] Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive.[57] Across 
the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, 
copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations 
have been recently developed in the Arctic,[58] making Canada one of the 
world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining 
towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, 
Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals 
in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin 
is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less known Temagami 
Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic 
anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second 
metal-rich impact crater.[59] The Shield is also covered by vast boreal 
forests that support an important logging industry. The lower 48 US states 
can be divided into roughly five physiographic provinces: The geology of 
Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of 
Hawaii consist of Neogene volcanics erupted over a hot spot. Central America 
is geologically active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring 
from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a major earthquake, killing 
23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes 
in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes 
devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one earthquake devastated 
northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in 
Honduras a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009. Volcanic eruptions 
are common in the region. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted 
and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have 
made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive 
highland areas. Central America has many mountain ranges; the longest are 
the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia, and the Cordillera 
de Talamanca. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are 
suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa 
Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the 
production of coffee, beans, and other crops. North America is a very large 
continent which surpasses the Arctic Circle, and the Tropic of Cancer. 
Greenland, along with the Canadian shield, is tundra with average temperatures 
ranging from between 10 to 20 °C (50 to 68 °F), but central Greenland is 
composed of a very large ice sheet. This tundra radiates throughout Canada, 
but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains (but still contains Alaska) 
and at the end of the Canadian Shield, near the Great Lakes. Climate west 
of the Cascades is described as being a temperate weather with average 
precipitation 20 inches (510 mm).[60] Climate in coastal California is 
described to be Mediterranean, with average temperatures in cities like 
San Francisco ranging from between 57 to 70 °F (14 to 21 °C) over the course 
of the year.[61] Stretching from the East Coast to eastern North Dakota, 
and stretching down to Kansas, is the continental-humid climate featuring 
hard seasons, with a large amount of annual precipitation, with places 
like New York City averaging 50 inches (1,300 mm).[62] Starting at the 
southern border of the continental-humid climate and stretching to the 
Gulf of Mexico (whilst encompassing the eastern half of Texas) is the subtropical 
climate. This area has the wettest cities in the contiguous U.S. with annual 
precipitation reaching 67 inches (1,700 mm) in Mobile, Alabama.[63] Stretching 
from the borders of the continental humid and subtropical climates, and 
going west to the Cascades Sierra Nevada, south to the southern tip of 
durango, north to the border with tundra climate, the steppe/desert climate 
is the driest climate in the U.S.[64] Economically, Canada and the United 
States are the wealthiest and most developed nations in the continent, 
followed by Mexico, a newly industrialized country.[65] The countries of 
Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and 
human development. For example, small Caribbean island-nations, such as 
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Antigua and Barbuda, have a higher GDP 
(PPP) per capita than Mexico due to their smaller populations. Panama and 
Costa Rica have a significantly higher Human Development Index and GDP 
than the rest of the Central American nations.[66] Additionally, despite 
Greenland's vast resources in oil and minerals, much of them remain untapped, 
and the island is economically dependent on fishing, tourism, and subsidies 
from Denmark. Nevertheless, the island is highly developed.[67] Demographically, 
North America is ethnically diverse. Its three main groups are Caucasians, 
Mestizos and Blacks.[citation needed] There is a significant minority of 
Indigenous Americans and Asians among other less numerous groups.[citation 
needed] The dominant languages in North America are English, Spanish, and 
French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside Greenlandic, and Dutch 
is spoken side by side local languages in the Dutch Caribbean. The term 
Anglo-America is used to refer to the anglophone countries of the Americas: 
namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the United 
States, but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially 
the Commonwealth Caribbean. Latin America refers to the other areas of 
the Americas (generally south of the United States) where the Romance languages, 
derived from Latin, of Spanish and Portuguese (but French speaking countries 
are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America 
(but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, 
or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except Guyana, 
Suriname, French Guiana (France), and the Falkland Islands (UK)). The French 
language has historically played a significant role in North America and 
now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially 
bilingual. French is the official language of the Province of Quebec, where 
95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and 
it is co-official with English in the Province of New Brunswick. Other 
French-speaking locales include the Province of Ontario (the official language 
is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the Province 
of Manitoba (co-official as de jure with English), the French West Indies 
and Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, as well as the US state of Louisiana, where 
French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group 
based on historical association but Haitians speak both Creole and French. 
Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia 
and the Commonwealth of Dominica alongside English. Christianity is the 
largest religion in the United States, Canada and Mexico according to a 
2012 Pew Research Center survey, 77.4% of the population considered themselves 
Christians.[68] Christianity also is the predominant religion in the 23 
dependent territories in North America.[69] The United States has the largest 
Christian population in the world, with nearly 247 million Christians (70%), 
although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their 
populations.[70] Mexico has the world's second largest number of Catholics, 
surpassed only by Brazil.[71] According to the same study religiously unaffiliated 
(include agnostic and atheist) make up about 17.1% of the population of 
Canada and the United States.[72] No religion make up about 22.8% of the 
United States population, and 23.9% of Canada total population.[73] Canada, 
the United States and Mexico host communities of both Jews (6 million or 
about 1.8%),[74] Buddhists (3.8 million or 1.1%)[75] and Muslims (3.4 million 
or 1.0%).[76] The biggest number of Jewish individuals can be found in 
the United States (5.4 million),[77] Canada (375,000)[78] and Mexico (67,476).[79] 
The United States host the largest Muslim population in North America with 
2.7 million or 0.9%,[80][81] While Canada host about one million Muslim 
or 3.2% of the population.[82] While in Mexico there were 3,700 Muslims 
in the country.[83] In 2012, U-T San Diego estimated U.S. practitioners 
of Buddhism at 1.2 million people, of whom 40% are living in Southern California.[84] 
The predominant religion in Central America is Christianity (95.6%).[85] 
Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Central America in the 16th 
century, Roman Catholicism became the most popular religion in the region 
until the first half of the 20th century. Since the 1960s, there has been 
an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well 
as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves 
as having no religion. Also Christianity is the predominant religion in 
the Caribbean (84.7%).[85] Other religious groups in the region are Hinduism, 
Islam, Rastafari (in Jamaica), and Afro-American religions such as Santería 
and Vodou. The most populous country in North America, is the United States 
with 318.4 million persons.[86] The second largest country is Mexico with 
a population of 112,322,757.[87] Canada is the third most populous country 
with 32,623,490.[88] The majority of Caribbean island-nations have national 
populations under a million, though Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto 
Rico (a territory of the United States), Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago 
each have populations higher than a million.[89][90][91][92][93] Despite 
Greenland's massive size (2,166,000 km² or 836,297 mi²), it has the world's 
lowest population density at 0.03 pop./km² (0.08 pop./mi²) for a small 
population of 55,984.[94] While the United States, Canada, and Mexico maintain 
the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those 
nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities 
in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York. These cities are 
the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three 
in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, Toronto,[95] Chicago, Havana, 
Santo Domingo, and Montreal. Cities in the sunbelt regions of the United 
States, such as those in Southern California and Houston, Phoenix, Miami, 
Atlanta, and Las Vegas, are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included 
warm temperatures, retirement of Baby Boomers, large industry, and the 
influx of immigrants. Cities near the United States border, particularly 
in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable 
is Tijuana, a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all 
over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in 
these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to 
deal with the major issue of water shortages.[96] Eight of the top ten 
metropolitan areas are located in the United States. These metropolitan 
areas all have a population of above 5.5 million and include the New York 
City metropolitan area, Los Angeles metropolitan area, Chicago metropolitan 
area, and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex.[97] Whilst the majority of the 
largest metropolitan areas are within the United States, Mexico is host 
to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America: Greater 
Mexico City.[98] Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan 
areas with the Toronto metropolitan area having six million citizens.[99] 
The proximity of cities to each other on the Canada–United States border 
and Mexico–United States border has led to the rise of international metropolitan 
areas. These urban agglomerations are observed at their largest and most 
productive in Detroit–Windsor and San Diego–Tijuana and experience large 
commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are 
responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international 
freight. In Detroit-Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study 
in 2004 concluded US$13 billion was dependent on the Detroit–Windsor international 
border crossing while in San Diego-Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port 
of Entry was valued at US$20 billion.[100][101] The North America continent 
has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. In the United 
States exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and 
comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions. These are the Arizona 
Sun Corridor, Cascadia, Florida, Front Range, Great Lakes Megaregion, Gulf 
Coast Megaregion, Northeast, Northern California, Piedmont Atlantic, Southern 
California, and the Texas Triangle.[102] Canada and Mexico are also the 
home of megaregions. These include the Quebec City – Windsor Corridor, 
Golden Horseshoe – both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes 
Megaregion – and megalopolis of Central Mexico. Traditionally the largest 
megaregion has been considered the Boston-Washington, D.C. Corridor, or 
the Northeast, as the region is one massive contiguous area. Yet megaregion 
criterion have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as 
the most populated region, being home to 53,768,125 people in 2000.[103] 
The top ten largest North American metropolitan areas by population as 
of 2013, based on national census numbers from the United States of America, 
and census estimates from Canada and Mexico. ‌†2011 Census figures. Canada, 
Mexico and the United States have significant and multifaceted economic 
systems. The United States has the largest economy of all three countries 
and in the world.[104] In 2014, the US had an estimated per capita gross 
domestic product (PPP) of $54,980, and is the most technologically developed 
economy of the three.[104] The United States' services sector comprises 
76.7% of the country's GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 22.2% 
and agriculture comprises 1.2%.[104] Canada shows significant growth in 
the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing.[105] Canada's per capita 
GDP (PPP) was estimated at $44,656 and it had the 11th largest GDP (nominal) 
in 2014.[105] Canada's services sector comprises 78% of the country's GDP 
(estimated in 2010), industry comprises 20% and agriculture comprises 2%.[105] 
Mexico has a per capita GDP (PPP) of $16,111 and as of 2014 is the 15th 
largest GDP (nominal) in the world.[106] Being a newly industrialized country,[65] 
Mexico maintains both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities 
and operations.[107] Its main sources of income are oil, industrial exports, 
manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, 
food, banking and financial services.[108] The North American economy is 
well defined and structured in three main economic areas.[109] These areas 
are the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Caribbean Community 
and Common Market (CARICOM), and the Central American Common Market (CACM).[109] 
Of these trade blocs, the United States takes part in two. In addition 
to the larger trade blocs there is the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement 
among numerous other free trade relations, often between the larger, more 
developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries. The North 
America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) forms one of the four largest trade 
blocs in the world.[110] Its implementation in 1994 was designed for economic 
homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign 
investment between Canada, the United States and Mexico.[111] While Canada 
and the United States already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship – 
and to present day still do – in the world and Canada - United States trade 
relations already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs,[112] 
NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar duty-free trade. The free 
trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously 
been in place on United States-Mexico trade. Trade volume has steadily 
increased annually and in 2010, surface trade between the three NAFTA nations 
reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3% or US$791 billion.[113] 
The NAFTA trade bloc GDP (PPP) is the world's largest with US$17.617 trillion.[114] 
This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the United States 
is the world's largest national economy; the country had a nominal GDP 
of approximately $14.7 trillion in 2010.[115] The countries of NAFTA are 
also some of each other's largest trade partners. The United States is 
the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico;[116] while Canada and Mexico 
are each other's third largest trade partners.[117][118] The Caribbean 
trade bloc – CARICOM – came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 
15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. 
CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a common passport for associated 
nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on Free Trade 
Agreements and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations (OTN) free 
trade agreements have been signed into effect. Integration of Central American 
economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market 
agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of 
this area into stronger financial cooperation. Recent implementation of 
the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has left the future of 
the CACM unclear.[119] The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed 
by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the United 
States. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar 
to that of NAFTA. In addition to the United States, Canada also has relations 
in Central American trade blocs. Currently under proposal, the Canada – 
Central American Free Trade Agreement (CA4) would operate much the same 
as CAFTA with the United States does. These nations also take part in inter-continental 
trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the G3 Free Trade Agreement with Colombia 
and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The United States 
has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the Transatlantic Free 
Trade Area between itself and the European Union; the US-Middle East Free 
Trade Area between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the 
Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership between Southeast Asian nations, 
Australia, and New Zealand. The Pan-American Highway route in the Americas 
is the portion of a network of roads nearly 48,000 km (30,000 mi) in length 
which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the 
Pan-American Highway exists because the US and Canadian governments have 
never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American 
Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the US border. 
However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity 
of the highway is roughly 26,000 km (16,000 mi). The First Transcontinental 
Railroad in the United States was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad 
network of the eastern US with California on the Pacific coast. Finished 
on 10 May 1869 at the famous Golden spike event at Promontory Summit, Utah, 
it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized 
the population and economy of the American West, catalyzing the transition 
from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system.[120] 
Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental 
railroad by connecting myriad eastern US railroads to the Pacific and was 
not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian Grand 
Trunk Railway (GTR) had, by 1867, already accumulated more than 2,055 km 
(1,277 mi) of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces 
west as far as Port Huron, Michigan, through Sarnia, Ontario. A shared 
telephone system known as the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) which 
is an integrated telephone numbering plan of 24 countries and territories: 
the United States and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean 
nations. Canada and the United States were both former British colonies. 
There is frequent cultural interplay between the United States and English-speaking 
Canada. Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous people 
of Canada but is considered Nordic and has strong Danish ties due to centuries 
of colonization by Denmark. Spanish-speaking North America shares a common 
past as former Spanish colonies. In Mexico and the Central American countries 
where civilizations like the Maya developed, indigenous people preserve 
traditions across modern boundaries. Central American and Spanish-speaking 
Caribbean nations have historically had more in common due to geographical 
proximity. Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of Monterrey, Tijuana, 
Ciudad Juárez, and Mexicali, is strongly influenced by the culture and 
way of life of the United States. Of the aforementioned cities, Monterrey 
has been regarded as the most Americanized city in North America.[121] 
Immigration to the United States and Canada remains a significant attribute 
of many nations close to the southern border of the US. The Anglophone 
Caribbean states have witnessed the decline of the British Empire and its 
influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence 
of Northern America. In the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to 
the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, 
and also because many of them now have more people living abroad than those 
remaining at home. The following table shows the most prominent sports 
leagues in North America, in order of average revenue.[122][123] Organizations
