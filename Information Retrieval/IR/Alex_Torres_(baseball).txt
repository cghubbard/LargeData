Alexander Jesus Torres Matos (born December 8, 1987) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent. He previously played in 
Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa Bay Rays, San Diego Padres and 
New York Mets. He is known as the first pitcher in Major League Baseball 
to take advantage of the league rules allowing pitchers to wear protective 
headgear full-time. Torres was signed on January 12, 2005, by Los Angeles 
Angels scout Carlos Porte, as an international free agent, and was assigned 
to the Angels' Dominican Summer League Angels that season. He spent the 
2006 and 2007 seasons with the Angels' rookie-level Arizona League Angels, 
as well as the beginning of the 2008 season before earning a promotion 
to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes in the Class A-Advanced California League. 
In 2009, Torres was again assigned to Rancho Cucamonga, where he earned 
minor league Pitcher of the Month honors for the Angels organization in 
both June and July. He held a stretch of 19 consecutive scoreless innings 
pitched (June 9–29, 2008) and won his final 5 starts before being promoted 
again to the Arkansas Travelers in the Double-A Texas League on July 31, 
2009.[1] On August 28, 2009, Torres was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays along 
with infielders Sean Rodriguez and Matthew Sweeney for pitcher Scott Kazmir, 
and he was assigned to the Montgomery Biscuits in the Double-A Southern 
League.[2][3] Following the 2009 season, the Rays added Torres to the 40-man 
roster on November 19 to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.[4] Torres started 
27 games for Montgomery in 2010, posting a 3.47 ERA and 150 strike-outs 
in 142 2⁄3 innings. For the 2011 season, Torres was promoted to the Durham 
Bulls in the Triple-A International League. He was promoted to the Major 
League for the first time on July 18, 2011.[5] He pitched in a single game 
on July 18, giving up one hit and three walks in one inning, before he 
was returned to Triple-A. He was called up to the Rays again in September, 
pitching in 3 more games in relief. For the season in Triple-A, he started 
27 games, had a 3.08 ERA and 156 strike-outs in 146 1⁄3 innings. Torres 
began 2012 as a starter for the Durham Bulls, but he struggled with control 
and was sent to the bullpen after 5 starts with a 10.38 ERA. He made 11 
relief appearances, allowing 11 earned runs in 20 1⁄3 innings, and then 
returned to the starting rotation in mid-June. He continued to struggle 
in 8 more starts, allowing 24 earned runs in 24 innings, before he was 
placed on the disabled list and then sent to the rookie-level Gulf Coast 
League Rays in Port Charlotte, Florida to work with pitching coach Marty 
DeMerritt.[6][7] Torres returned to make the final start of the year in 
Durham, pitching 5 2⁄3 scoreless innings and striking out 10. He then pitched 
in the winter leagues in his native Venezuela. Torres again opened 2013 
with the Triple-A Durham Bulls as he was eligible for a fourth option year 
after being added to the 40-man roster in 2009.[8] He pitched to a 3.52 
ERA in 9 starts in Durham in 2013. Torres was called up the Rays in mid-May 
when David Price went down with an injury.[9] He appeared in 2 games out 
of the bullpen, including a scoreless four-inning stint, and was sent back 
down to Durham. He was recalled on June 1 to add depth to the bullpen.[10] 
There was discussion in June about turning Torres into a starter, but manager 
Joe Maddon opted to keep him in the bullpen.[6] Torres remained with the 
big league club for the remainder of the season, accumulating a 1.71 ERA 
and 62 strike-outs in 58 innings and 39 games. On January 22, 2014, the 
Rays traded Torres and Jesse Hahn to the San Diego Padres for Logan Forsythe, 
Brad Boxberger, Matt Andriese, Maxx Tissenbaum and Matt Lollis.[11] On 
June 21, 2014, Torres became the first Major League Baseball pitcher to 
wear the isoBLOX protective cap introduced early in the year. MLB approved 
the product in January, nearly a year and a half after pitcher Brandon 
McCarthy was struck in the head by a line drive and suffered life-threatening 
brain injuries. Other pitchers with traumatic injuries includes Juan Nicasio, 
Alex Cobb and Aroldis Chapman, which led MLB to ramp up efforts to better 
protect pitchers.[12] Torres accumulated a 3.33 ERA over 54 innings in 
70 appearances in 2014, striking out 51 and walking 33. On March 30, 2015, 
the Padres traded Torres to the New York Mets for Cory Mazzoni and a player 
to be named later.[13][14] Torres pitched to a 3.15 ERA, but walked 26 
batters in 34 1⁄3 and allowed left-handed hitters a .268 batting average 
against. All of this combined with the fact that Torres was out of minor 
league options ultimately led the Mets to designate him for assignment 
on August 4.[15] Torres cleared waivers and was reassigned to the Mets' 
triple-A club in Las Vegas. Torres signed a minor league contract with 
the Atlanta Braves on December 31, 2015.[16] On March 30, 2016, he was
