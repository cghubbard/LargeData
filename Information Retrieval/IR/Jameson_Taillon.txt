Jameson Lee Taillon (born November 18, 1991) is a Canadian American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Taillon was drafted by the Pirates as the second overall pick in the 2010 
Major League Baseball draft.[1][2] Fangraphs called Taillon the best high 
school pitching prospect since Josh Beckett.[3] Baseball America compared 
him to pitchers like Stephen Strasburg.[4] As he was born in Florida and 
his parents were born in Canada, Taillon is a dual citizen of the United 
States and Canada.[5] Taillon attended The Woodlands High School in Texas. 
He caught the attention of Pirates scouts with a 22–6 high school career 
record. He was 8–1 his senior year and threw a 19-strikeout no-hitter against 
rival Conroe High School on March 23, 2010.[6][7] Taillon signed a National 
Letter of Intent with Rice University in November 2009 posing a challenge 
to the Pirates in their effort to sign him.[8][9] However, hours before 
the signing deadline, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Taillon 
had indeed signed with the Pirates.[10] Baseball America's Jim Callis reported 
that Taillon's deal included a $6.5 million signing bonus, the 2nd highest 
in draft history.[11] Taillon made his professional debut with the Pirates' 
low-A affiliate, the West Virginia Power against the Hagerstown Suns on 
April 27, 2011. He joined the team on April 24 after staying in Florida 
for an extended spring training assignment.[12] He was named to appear 
in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game.[13] He was promoted to the AA Altoona 
Curve in August 2012.[14] In his first week with the Curve, August 20–26, 
2012, Taillon was named the Eastern League pitcher of the week.[15] Prior 
to the 2013 season, Taillon was ranked as the 15th best prospect in baseball 
by MLB.com.[16] Taillon participated in the 2013 World Baseball Classic 
for Team Canada, being the youngest member of the team at age 21.[17] Taillon 
underwent Tommy John surgery in April 2014 to repair damage to the ulnar 
collateral ligament of the elbow in his throwing arm, costing him the 2014 
season, [18] while a sports hernia caused him to miss the 2015 season. 
Taillon began 2016 with Triple-A Indianapolis, where he made 10 starts 
before earning his first major league call-up. Taillon went 4–2 with a 
2.04 ERA, striking out 61 in 61.2 innings and walking only 6. On June 8, 
Taillon was recalled to make a spot start with the Pirates, who decided 
to push back Francisco Liriano's start one day after they played a doubleheader 
the day before.[19] Facing off against fellow 2010 first rounder Noah Syndergaard 
in his debut, Taillon threw 6 innings, giving up 3 runs on 6 hits, 2 walks, 
and 3 strikeouts, not receiving a decision in the eventual 5–6 loss. After 
the game, Taillon was optioned back to Triple-A, but not without receiving 
compliments from his manager Clint Hurdle on his effort, saying "This kid's 
poured into everything he's done. It's been a great fight back."[20] However, 
his stay in Indianapolis was very brief, as an injury to Gerrit Cole necessitated 
a move to bring Taillon back into the rotation.[21] On June 14, Taillon 
made his second start, also against the Mets, throwing 8 scoreless innings, 
carrying a no-hitter into the seventh before it was broken up by Curtis 
Granderson, and recording his first win in the 4–0 victory. Taillon stands 
at 6' 5" and has a fastball that has hit 99 miles per hour (mph) as well 
as a "plus" curveball according to MLB.com.[22] Pirates general manager 
Neal Huntington said of Taillon, "He has the stuff that allows you to envision 
down the road a top-of-the-rotation starter."[23] Taillon describes his 
pitch repertoire as being a four-seamer at 94–98 mph, a two-seam fastball 
at 93–96, a "power" curveball with diagonal break, and a circle changeup. 
He says of his pitch selection, "I feel pretty confident right now that
