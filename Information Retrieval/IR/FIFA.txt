International Olympic Committee The Fédération Internationale de Football 
Association (FIFA /ˈfiːfə/; "International Federation of Association Football") 
is the international governing body of association football, futsal and 
beach soccer. FIFA is responsible for the organisation of football's major 
international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 
and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. FIFA was founded in 
1904 to oversee international competition among the national associations 
of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and 
Switzerland. Headquartered in Zürich, its membership now comprises 211 
national associations. Member countries must each also be members of one 
of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: Africa, 
Asia, Europe, North & Central America and the Caribbean, Oceania and South 
America. Although FIFA does not control the rules of football (that being 
the responsibility of the International Football Association Board), it 
is responsible for both the organization of a number of tournaments and 
their promotion, which generate revenue from sponsorship. In 2013 FIFA 
had revenues of over 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, for a net profit of 72 million, 
and had cash reserves of over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars.[5] Reports by investigative 
journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging 
pursuant to the election of FIFA President Sepp Blatter and the organization's 
decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. 
These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials 
and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges 
including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015 
several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were 
launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the 
organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials 
who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face 
charges there as well.[6][7][8] The need for a single body to oversee association 
football became apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the 
increasing popularity of international fixtures. The Fédération Internationale 
de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters 
of the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques at the Rue Saint 
Honoré 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.[9] The French name and acronym are 
used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were 
the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, 
Spain (represented by Madrid Football Club; the Spanish federation was 
not created until 1913), Sweden and Switzerland. Also, that same day, the 
German Association declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.[1] 
The first president of FIFA was Robert Guérin. Guérin was replaced in 1906 
by Daniel Burley Woolfall from England, by then a member of the association. 
The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition 
for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, 
despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding 
principles of FIFA.[dubious – discuss] Membership of FIFA expanded beyond 
Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912, 
Canada and Chile in 1913, and the United States in 1914.[10] During World 
War I, with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel 
for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival 
was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organisation 
was run by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved from extinction, but 
at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations (of the United Kingdom), 
who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions 
with their recent World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their 
membership. The FIFA collection is held by the National Football Museum 
at Urbis in Manchester, England. The first World Cup in the world was in 
1930 in Montevideo, Uruguay. FIFA is headquartered in Zürich, and is an 
association established under the Law of Switzerland. FIFA's supreme body 
is the FIFA Congress, an assembly made up of representatives from each 
affiliated member association. Each national football association has one 
vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles 
in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been 
held once a year since 1998. The congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's 
governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. 
Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves 
the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations 
and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA, its General 
Secretary, and the other members of the FIFA Council on the year following 
the FIFA World Cup.[11] FIFA's Executive Committee, chaired by the President, 
is the main decision-making body of the organisation in the intervals of 
Congress. The Executive Committee is composed of 24 people: the President, 
8 Vice Presidents, and 15 members. The Executive Committee is the body 
that decides which country will host the World Cup. The President and General 
Secretary are the main officeholders of FIFA, and are in charge of its 
daily administration, carried out by the General Secretariat, with its 
staff of approximately 280 members. Gianni Infantino is the current president, 
appointed on 26 February 2016 at the Extraordinary FIFA Congress. The former 
president, Sepp Blatter is suspended pending a corruption investigation.[12][13] 
FIFA's worldwide organisational structure also consists of several other 
bodies, under authority of the Executive Committee or created by Congress 
as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, 
the FIFA Ethics Committee, the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, 
and the Referees Committee. The FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all 
matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular 
meetings of the FIFA Executive Committee.[14][15] The Emergency Committee 
consists of the FIFA President as well as one member from each confederation.[16] 
Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, 
although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting.[17] 
FIFA publishes its results according to IFRS. The total compensation for 
the management committee in 2011 was 30 million for 35 people. Blatter, 
the only full-time person on the committee, earned approximately two million 
Swiss francs, 1.2 million in salary and the rest in bonuses.[18][19][20] 
A report in London's Sunday Times in June 2014 said the members of the 
committee had their salaries doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 during the 
year. The report also said leaked documents had indicated $4.4 million 
in secret bonuses had been paid to the committee members following the 
2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[21] Besides its worldwide institutions 
there are six confederations recognised by FIFA which oversee the game 
in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, 
and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental 
confederations are provided for in FIFA's statutes, and membership of a 
confederation is a prerequisite to FIFA membership. In total, FIFA recognises 
211 national associations and their associated men's national teams as 
well as 129 women's national teams; see the list of national football teams 
and their respective country codes. FIFA has more member states than the 
UN as FIFA recognises 23 non-sovereign entities as distinct nations, such 
as the four Home Nations within the United Kingdom and politically disputed 
territories such as Palestine.[22] The FIFA Working Committee of Small 
Nations has categorized potential FIFA members into three categories: The 
FIFA World Rankings are updated monthly and rank each team based on their 
performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches. 
There is also a world ranking for women's football, updated four times 
a year. FIFA holds an annual awards ceremony which recognises both individual 
and team achievements in international association football. Individually, 
the top men's player is awarded the FIFA Ballon d'Or and the top women's 
player is named FIFA World Player of the Year; the latter title was also 
awarded to the men's player prior to its 2010 merger with France Football's 
Ballon d'Or. At the Ballon d'Or banquet, the FIFA Puskás Award, FIFA/FIFPro 
Best XI, FIFA Fair Play Award, and FIFA Presidential Award are also awarded. 
In 1994 FIFA published the FIFA World Cup All-Time Team. In 2000 FIFA published 
the results of an Internet poll, declaring Real Madrid to be the FIFA Club 
of the Century. In 2002 FIFA announced the FIFA Dream Team, an all-time 
all-star team chosen by fans in a poll. As part of its centennial celebrations 
in 2004, FIFA organised a "Match of the Century" between France and Brazil. 
The laws that govern football, known officially as the Laws of the Game, 
are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body 
called the International Football Association Board (IFAB). FIFA has members 
on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the 
football associations of the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, 
and Northern Ireland, who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognised 
for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game 
must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates. FIFA commits itself 
to constantly improving the sport of football. The FIFA Statutes form the 
overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system 
is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create 
a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the 
congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing 
and ad-hoc committees.[25] FIFA frequently takes active roles in the running 
of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions 
is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition 
when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member 
organisations or if the associate is not functioning properly. A 2007 FIFA 
ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and 
appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 
1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries 
whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of two former Ireland 
internationals. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this 
ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with 
out-of-phase seasons. FIFA does not permit video evidence during matches, 
although it is permitted for subsequent sanctions.[26] The 1970 meeting 
of the International Football Association Board "agreed to request the 
television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which 
reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee".[27] 
In 2008, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said: "Let it be as it is and let's 
leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right 
to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the 
decision – a man, not a machine."[28] It has been said that instant replay 
is needed given the difficulty of tracking the activities of 22 players 
on such a large field,[29] and it has been proposed that instant replay 
be used in penalty incidents, fouls which lead to bookings or red cards 
and whether the ball has crossed the goal line, since those events are 
more likely than others to be game-changing.[30] Critics point out that 
instant replay is already in use in other sports, including rugby union, 
cricket, American football, Canadian football, basketball, baseball, tennis, 
and ice hockey.[29][31][32][33] As one notable proponent of video replay, 
Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz has been quoted as saying that the "credibility 
of the game" is at stake.[34] An incident during a second-round game in 
the 2010 FIFA World Cup between England and Germany, where a shot by Englishman 
Frank Lampard, which would have leveled the scores at 2–2 in a match that 
ultimately ended in a 4–1 German victory, crossed the line but was not 
seen to do so by the match officials, led FIFA officials to declare that 
they will re-examine the use of goal-line technology.[35] Since the 1994 
FIFA World Cup, like the UEFA Champions League, FIFA has adopted an anthem 
composed by the German composer Franz Lambert. It has been recently re-arranged 
and produced by Rob May and Simon Hill. The FIFA Anthem is played at the 
beginning of official FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such as international 
friendlies, the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFA U-20 World 
Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, Football at the Summer Olympics, FIFA U-20 Women's 
World Cup, FIFA Women's U-17 World Cup, FIFA Futsal World Cup, FIFA Beach 
Soccer World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[36] Since 2007, FIFA has also 
required most of its broadcast partners to use short sequences including 
the anthem at the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage, as well as 
for break bumpers, to help promote FIFA's sponsors. This emulates practices 
long used by some other international football events such as the UEFA 
Champions League. Exceptions may be made for specific events; for example, 
an original piece of African music was used for bumpers during the 2010 
FIFA World Cup. In May 2006 British investigative reporter Andrew Jennings' 
book Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals 
(Harper Collins) caused controversy within the football world by detailing 
an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse 
of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure (ISL), and 
revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay 
the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had 
occurred in the fight for Sepp Blatter's continued control of FIFA. Shortly 
after the release of Foul! a BBC television exposé by Jennings and BBC 
producer Roger Corke for the BBC news programme Panorama was broadcast. 
In this hour-long programme, screened on 11 June 2006, Jennings and the 
Panorama team agree that Sepp Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police 
over his role in a secret deal to repay more than £1m worth of bribes pocketed 
by football officials. Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the English 
Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that "behaves like 
a mafia family", highlighting the association's "decades-long traditions 
of bribes, bungs and corruption".[43] All testimonies offered in the Panorama 
exposé were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save 
one; Mel Brennan, formerly a lecturer at Towson University in the United 
States (and from 2001 to 2003 Head of Special Projects for CONCACAF, a 
liaison to the e-FIFA project and a 2002 FIFA World Cup delegate), became 
the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations 
of greed, corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA 
leadership. During the Panorama exposé, Brennan—the highest-level African-American 
in the history of world football governance—joined Jennings, Trinidadian 
journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate 
allocations of money at CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible 
CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA. Since then, and in 
the light of fresh allegations of bribery and corruption and opaque action 
by FIFA in late 2010,[44] both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical 
of FIFA, with Brennan calling directly for an alternative to FIFA to be 
considered by the stakeholders of the sport throughout the world.[45] In 
a further Panorama documentary broadcast on BBC One on 29 November 2010, 
Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou 
and Ricardo Teixeira, had been paid huge bribes by FIFA's marketing partner 
ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. He claimed 
they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100 million. 
A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within ISL that 
the company was only awarded the marketing contract for successive World 
Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that 
another current official, Jack Warner, has been repeatedly involved in 
reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Sepp Blatter said that FIFA had not 
investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official 
channels'. The programme also criticized FIFA for allegedly requiring World 
Cup host bidding nations to agree to implement special laws for the World 
Cup, including blanket tax exemption for FIFA and sponsors, and limitation 
of workers' rights. It alleged that governments of bidding nations are 
required to keep the details of the required laws confidential during the 
bidding process; but that they were revealed by the Dutch government, which 
refused to agree to them, as a result of which it was told by FIFA that 
its bid could be adversely affected. According to the programme, following 
Jennings' earlier investigations he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, 
for reasons he says have not been made clear; and the accused officials 
failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally 
or by letter. British Prime Minister David Cameron and Andy Anson, head 
of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three 
days before FIFA's decision on the host for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, on 
the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials 
accused by the programme.[46][47] In June 2011, it came to light that the 
IOC had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president João 
Havelange into claims of bribery. The BBC Panorama programme alleged that 
the Brazilian accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The Olympic 
governing body said "the IOC takes all allegations of corruption very seriously 
and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC 
members to be passed to our ethics commission".[48] In a 2014 interview, 
American sports writer Dave Zirin said greed, corruption, nonfeasance and 
malfeasance are endemic to FIFA leadership, and that FIFA should be abolished 
for the good of the game. He said that currently FIFA is in charge of both 
monitoring corruption in football matches, and marketing and selling the 
sport, but that two "separate" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational 
body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like, and an organization 
that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. 
Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that's responsible 
for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.[49] Between 
2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations 
pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges. The pleas 
of Chuck Blazer, José Hawilla, Daryan Warner, Darrell Warner, Traffic Group 
and Traffic Sports USA were unsealed in May 2015.[7] In another 2015 case, 
Singapore also imposed a 6-year "harshest sentence ever received for match-fixing" 
on match-fixer Eric Ding who had bribed three Lebanese FIFA football officials 
with prostitutes as an inducement to fix future matches that they would 
officiate, as well as perverting the course of justice.[50] Fourteen FIFA 
officials and marketing executives were indicted by the United States Department 
of Justice in May 2015. The officials were arrested in Switzerland and 
are in the process of extradition to the US. Specific charges (brought 
under the RICO act) include wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering.[51] 
"Swiss authorities say they have also opened a separate criminal investigation 
into FIFA's operations pertaining to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids".[52] 
FIFA’s top officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on suspicion 
of receiving bribes totalling $100m (£65m). The US Department of Justice 
stated that nine FIFA officials and four executives of sports management 
companies were arrested and accused of over $150m in bribes.[53] The UK 
Shadow Home Secretary and Labour Member of Parliament, Andy Burnham, stated 
in May 2015 that England should boycott the 2018 World Cup against corruption 
in FIFA and military aggression by Russia.[54] FIFA's choice to award the 
2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has been widely 
criticised by media.[55][56][57][58][59] It has been alleged that some 
FIFA inside sources insist that the Russian kickbacks of cash and gifts 
given to FIFA executive members were enough to secure the Russian 2018 
bid weeks before the result was announced.[60] Sepp Blatter was widely 
criticised in the media for giving a warning about the "evils of the media" 
in a speech to FIFA executive committee members shortly before they voted 
on the hosting of the 2018 World Cup, a reference to The Sunday Times exposés[61] 
and the Panorama investigation.[62] Two members of FIFA's executive committee 
were banned from all football-related activity in November 2010 for allegedly 
offering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. In early 
May 2011, a British parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure 
the 2018 finals was told by member of parliament, Damian Collins, that 
there was evidence from the Sunday Times newspaper that Issa Hayatou of 
Cameroon and Jacques Anouma of Ivory Coast were paid by Qatar. Qatar has 
categorically denied the allegations, as have Hayatou and Anouma.[63] FIFA 
President Blatter said, as of 23 May 2011, that the British newspaper The 
Sunday Times has agreed to bring its whistle-blowing source to meet senior 
FIFA officials, who will decide whether to order a new investigation into 
alleged World Cup bidding corruption. "[The Sunday Times] are happy, they 
agreed that they will bring this whistleblower here to Zürich and then 
we will have a discussion, an investigation of this", Blatter said. Specifically, 
the whistleblower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou 
and Jacques Anouma were paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar.[64][65] The 
emirate's bid beat the United States in a final round of voting last December. 
Blatter did not rule out reopening the 2022 vote if corruption could be 
proved, but urged taking the matter "step by step". The FIFA president 
said his organization is "anxiously awaiting" more evidence before asking 
its ethics committee to examine allegations made in Britain's parliament 
in early May 2011. Hayatou, who is from Cameroon, leads the Confederation 
of African Football and is a FIFA vice president. Anouma is president of 
Ivorian Football Federation. The whistleblower said Qatar agreed to pay 
a third African voter, Amos Adamu, for his support. The Nigerian was later 
suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court ruled he solicited bribes 
from undercover Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said 
the newspaper and its whistleblower would meet with FIFA secretary general, 
Jérôme Valcke, and legal director, Marco Villiger. Allegations against 
FIFA officials have also been made to the UK Parliament by David Triesman, 
the former head of England's bid and the English Football Association. 
Triesman told the lawmakers that four long-standing FIFA executive committee 
members—Jack Warner, Nicolas Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi—engaged 
in "improper and unethical" conduct in the 2018 bidding, which was won 
by Russia. All six FIFA voters have denied wrongdoing.[66] On 28 September 
2015, Sepp Blatter suggested that the 2018 World Cup being awarded to Russia 
was planned before the voting, and that the 2022 World Cup would have then 
been awarded to the United States. However, this plan changed after the 
election ballot, and the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar instead of 
the U.S.[67][68] FIFA announced on 25 May 2011 that it had opened the investigation 
to examine the conduct of four officials—Mohamed Bin Hammam and Jack Warner, 
along with Caribbean Football Union (CFU) officials Debbie Minguell and 
Jason Sylvester—in relation to claims made by executive committee member, 
Chuck Blazer.[69][70][71] Blazer, who is the general secretary of the CONCACAF 
federation, has alleged that violations were committed under the FIFA code 
of ethics during a meeting organized by Bin Hammam and Warner on 10 and 
11 May—the same time Lord Triesman had accused Warner of demanding money 
for a World Cup 2018 vote—in relation to the 2011 FIFA presidential election,[72] 
in which Bin Hammam, who also played a key role in the Qatar 2022 FIFA 
World Cup bid, allegedly offered financial incentives for votes cast in 
his favour during the presidential election. As a result of the investigation 
both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended.[73] Warner reacted to his suspension 
by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general, 
Jérôme Valcke, had told him via e-mail that Qatar had bought the 2022 World 
Cup.[74][75] Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested 
it was bribery, saying instead that the country had "used its financial 
muscle to lobby for support". Qatar officials denied any impropriety.[76] 
Bin Hammam also responded by writing to FIFA, protesting unfair treatment 
in suspension by the FIFA Ethics Committee and FIFA administration.[77] 
Further evidence emerged of alleged corruption. On 30 May 2011, Fred Lunn, 
vice-president of the Bahamas Football Association, said that he was given 
$40,000 in cash[78] as an incitement to vote for FIFA presidential candidate, 
Mohamed bin Hammam. In addition, on 11 June 2011 Louis Giskus, president 
of the Surinamese Football Association, alleged that he was given $40,000 
in cash for "development projects" as an incentive to vote for Bin Hammam.[79] 
After being re-elected as President of FIFA Sepp Blatter responded to the 
allegations by promising to reform FIFA in wake of the bribery scandal, 
with Danny Jordaan, CEO of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, saying 
there is great expectation for reform.[80] Former US Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger is being tipped for a role on the newly proposed 'Solutions 
Committee', and former Netherlands national football team player Johan 
Cruyff is also being linked with a role.[75][81] UEFA secretary general 
Gianni Infantino said he hopes for "concrete" measures to be taken by the 
world game's authority. Saying that "the UEFA executive committee has taken 
note of the will of FIFA to take concrete and effective measures for good 
governance ... [and is] following the situation closely."[82] IOC president 
Jacques Rogge commented on the situation by saying that he believes FIFA 
"can emerge stronger" from its worst ever crisis, stating that "I will 
not point a finger and lecture ... I am sure FIFA can emerge stronger and 
from within".[83] Several of FIFA's partners and sponsors have raised concerns 
about the allegations of corruption, including Coca-Cola, Adidas, Emirates 
and Visa.[84][85][86] Coca-Cola raised concerns by saying "the current 
allegations being raised are distressing and bad for the sport"; with Adidas 
saying "the negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment 
is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners"; moreover Emirates 
raised its concerns by saying "we hope that these issues will be resolved 
as soon as possible"; and Visa adding "the current situation is clearly 
not good for the game and we ask that Fifa take all necessary steps to 
resolve the concerns that have been raised."[84] Australian Sports Minister 
Mark Arbib said it was clear FIFA needed to change, saying "there is no 
doubt there needs to be reform of FIFA. This is something that we're hearing 
worldwide", with Australian Senator Nick Xenophon accusing FIFA of "scamming" 
the country out of the A$46 million (US$35 million) it spent on the Australia 
2022 FIFA World Cup bid, saying that "until the investigation into FIFA 
has been completed, Australia must hold off spending any more taxpayers' 
money on any future World Cup bids."[87] Theo Zwanziger, President of the 
German Football Association, also called on FIFA to re-examine the awarding 
of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar.[88] Transparency International, which 
had called on FIFA to postpone the election pending a full independent 
investigation, renewed its call on FIFA to change its governance structure.[89] 
Moreover, former Argentine football player Diego Maradona was critical 
of FIFA in light of the corruption scandal, comparing members of the board 
to dinosaurs. He said "Fifa is a big museum. They are dinosaurs who do 
not want to relinquish power. It's always going to be the same."[90] In 
October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, "FIFA has 
fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many 
problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing 
to be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its 
conduct in the future will be such that the public can be confident in
