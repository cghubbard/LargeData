Elton P. "Ice Box" Chamberlain (November 5, 1867 – September 22, 1929) 
was a professional baseball pitcher. He pitched in Major League Baseball 
for ten seasons between 1886 and 1896. In several seasons, Chamberlain 
finished in his league's top ten in a number of pitching categories, including 
wins, earned run average, strikeouts, and shutouts. During one of his best 
seasons, the 1888 St. Louis Browns won the American Association pennant 
with a 92–43 record. Although a righthanded pitcher, Chamberlain pitched 
the last two innings of an 1888 game with his left hand. Chamberlain finished 
his major league career with 264 complete games out of his 301 games started.[1] 
After his playing days, he was hired as a baseball umpire and later announced 
that he was becoming a boxer, but neither venture seems to have worked 
out. Not much is known about Chamberlain's later life. He died in Baltimore 
in 1929. Chamberlain was born on November 5, 1867 in Warsaw, New York.[2] 
He was one of six children born to veterinary surgeon Irving Chamberlain 
and his wife Carrie.[3] Moving to Buffalo as a child, Chamberlain began 
to play organized baseball as a teenager. His early professional career 
included stints in Hamilton, Ontario and with a Southern League team in 
Macon, Georgia.[2] As a 17-year-old pitcher with Hamilton, he earned 18 
wins and led the league in strikeouts.[4] Chamberlain made his major league 
debut with the Louisville Colonels of the American Association on September 
13, 1886.[5] In early October, Chamberlain was pitching in a game against 
the Baltimore Orioles when Louisville players began to complain that opposing 
pitcher Matt Kilroy was leaving the pitcher's box when he threw the ball. 
When the umpire did not respond to Louisville's complaints, Chamberlain's 
manager told him to run forward out of the box when he let go of his pitches. 
The move "scared the Baltimore batters out of their wits" and Kilroy did 
not deliver any more questionable pitches.[6] In 1887, Chamberlain won 
18 games for Louisville. The right-hander, who stood 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) 
and weighed 168 lbs.,[7] earned the nickname "Ice Box". Some sources attribute 
the nickname to his ability to remain cool when facing tough opposition,[2] 
but at least one source links the nickname to chronic laziness.[8] On May 
9, 1888, while pitching against the Kansas City Cowboys, Chamberlain pitched 
righthanded for the first seven innings and lefthanded for the last two 
innings. Louisville won the game by a score of 18–6.[2] He was the third 
major league pitcher to throw with both his left and right hands during 
the same game. The feat was not repeated in the major leagues until Greg 
Harris switched arms for the ninth inning of a 1995 game.[9] Chamberlain 
was traded to the St. Louis Browns in August 1888, having already registered 
14 wins for the Colonels that year. He earned 11 more wins in the last 
six weeks of the season.[2] He struck out 176 batters and registered a 
2.19 earned run average that season, good for fifth among the league's 
pitchers.[1] The Browns finished 1888 with a fourth consecutive league 
pennant. However, not long after Chamberlain joined the club, pitcher Nat 
Hudson left the team to get married. In the World Series, the Browns had 
only Chamberlain and pitcher Silver King to face a trio of New York Giants 
pitchers that included future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe.[10] After Chamberlain 
pitched a shutout in the second game of the 1888 World Series, he lost 
the fourth, sixth and eighth games.[8] Chamberlain gave up 11 runs in the 
eighth game. Though the Giants clinched the series after that game, they 
played a full ten games, with Chamberlain winning the last game.[10] The 
series was Chamberlain's last major league postseason playing appearance.[1] 
The Cincinnati Reds talked to St. Louis about acquiring Chamberlain in 
1889, but Cincinnati balked when St. Louis asked $8,000 for him.[11] That 
year, Chamberlain pitched in a career-high 53 games and finished with 32 
wins; his win total was the third highest in the league.[1] Following the 
1889 season, a new major league was forming known as the Players' League. 
A players association known as the Brotherhood of Professional Ball Players 
had served as a union and bargaining agent since the mid-1880s; now the 
group's new league was attempting to compete with established baseball.[12] 
Browns owner Chris von der Ahe was afraid that Chamberlain would jump to 
the Chicago team in the new league; the manager of the Browns from the 
previous season, Charles Comiskey, had been hired there. Von der Ahe agreed 
to match the $800 pay increase that Chamberlain would have gotten in Chicago.[2] 
Chamberlain had returned to Buffalo by May 1890, where he was reported 
to be hanging out in pool rooms. Rumors held that Chamberlain wanted to 
join the Brotherhood and that he was "playing for his release."[2] He was 
sold to the Columbus Solons (also of the American Association) the next 
month.[13] Chamberlain had appeared in five games for St. Louis and pitched 
in 25 more for Columbus by the end of the season. He finished the year 
with a league-leading six shutouts.[1] In February 1891, Chamberlain pleaded 
guilty to a charge of aiding and abetting a prize fight. He received a 
$50 fine and the Columbus team declared that they would not retain him 
for the 1891 season.[14] The Philadelphia Athletics indicated immediate 
interest in Chamberlain, hoping that he would pitch most of the team's 
games.[14] Chamberlain earned a 22–23 win-loss record in 1891. He was the 
losing pitcher in the last of 485 shutouts recorded in the few seasons 
of American Association play.[15] In August, he gave up the longest home 
run that had been hit at Boston's Congress Street Grounds.[16] Chamberlain 
pitched for the NL's Cincinnati Reds in 1892, compiling a 19–23 record.[8] 
In May of that season, Chamberlain pitched in an unusual game that was 
suspended due to sunlight; the scoreless game was in extra innings when 
umpire Jack Sheridan ruled that the sun was too bright for players to see 
the ball.[17] The 1892 Reds finished with an overall record of 82–68. League 
officials split the season into two halves and the Reds finished fourth 
and eighth in the respective halves.[18] Before the 1893 season, Chamberlain 
indicated his displeasure with the climate in Cincinnati and said that 
he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia in the coming year. He also 
said that he would be happy to pitch in Buffalo if the city received a 
major league expansion team.[19] Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that 
season and the next one, earning 16–12 and 10–9 records.[8] On May 30, 
1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major 
league player to hit four home runs in one game.[20] Two of Lowe's home 
runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year 
career.[21] Chamberlain had agreed to play for the Cleveland Spiders in 
1895,[8] but instead he joined a Class D baseball team out of Warren, Ohio 
in the Iron and Oil League. Future Baseball Hall of Fame member Honus Wagner 
played on the team. Years later, Wagner recalled Chamberlain as an experienced 
pitcher who shared his baseball knowledge with his young teammates.[22] 
He reported to the Spiders in 1896. The team featured Cy Young and young 
pitchers such as Cy Swaim and Zeke Wilson.[23] Chamberlain was released 
after appearing in two games.[8] Chamberlain finished his major league 
career with a 157–120 win-loss record and a 3.57 earned run average. Though 
he only finished among the top ten in complete games in two of his seasons, 
Chamberlain completed 264 of his 301 games started. His complete game total 
was ranked 64th on the all-time major league list after the 2013 season.[1] 
Chamberlain also hit nine home runs, including a grand slam, during his 
major league career.[2] In early 1898, The Montreal Gazette reported that 
NL president Nicholas Young signed Chamberlain as an umpire for the coming 
season.[24] Chamberlain did not ultimately work for the NL because he was 
unhappy with the salary that he was offered. He played local semi-amateur 
baseball in Buffalo and then announced that he was leaving baseball to 
become a boxer. He challenged Jack Baty, a black fighter, to a boxing match 
and posted a $500 bet on the fight.[25] There is no record of Chamberlain 
boxing against Baty or anyone else, and little is known about his life 
after the major leagues.[3] Chamberlain briefly played minor league baseball 
for the 1899 Buffalo Bisons in the Western League.[26] He did not win any 
games for Buffalo.[27] In 1904, Sporting Life reported that the pitcher 
had a brother, F. Earl Chamberlain, who was named a Pacific Coast League 
umpire.[28] Elton died of colon cancer at the age of 61.[3] He was interred
