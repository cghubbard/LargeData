William Charles Harris (born June 22, 1978) is a retired American professional 
baseball outfielder. Harris played for the Baltimore Orioles (2001), Chicago 
White Sox (2002-2005), Boston Red Sox (2006), Atlanta Braves (2007), Washington 
Nationals (2008-2010) and New York Mets (2011). With the White Sox, he 
won the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros. He batted left-handed 
and threw right-handed. He attended Kennesaw State University and lives 
in Cairo, Georgia during the offseason. Versatility and speed are his biggest 
strengths, as Harris has the ability to play all three outfield positions 
as well as second base, where he started 28 games in 2005. He started two 
games at shortstop in 2005. He can also play third base. His most productive 
season came in 2004, when he posted career-numbers in average (.262), RBI 
(27), runs (68), hits (107), doubles (15) and at-bats (409). Harris also 
notched a career high of 19 stolen bases. In 2005, he stole 10 bases in 
56 games. In the 2005 playoffs, Harris went 2-for-2 in the postseason with 
an RBI, one stolen base, and one run scored. Harris' successful pinch-hit 
single in Game 4 of the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros would 
prove to be decisive after Harris scored on an RBI single by Jermaine Dye. 
Not only was the run the game-winner, it was the only run which would be 
scored in the Series-clinching Game 4. The Boston Red Sox signed Harris 
to a one-year, split contract. He went to spring training camp as a non-roster 
invitee, but he was figured to have a strong chance to make the Opening 
Day roster. On April 20, Harris had his contract purchased by the Boston 
Red Sox and was added to the 40-man roster. Harris was designated for assignment 
on July 18. Three days later, he cleared waivers and was assigned to the 
Pawtucket Red Sox. The Atlanta Braves and Oakland Athletics completed a 
trade on April 29, as the Braves sent outfielder Ryan Langerhans to the 
A's in exchange for a player to be named later or cash considerations. 
To fill Langerhans' spot, Atlanta purchased the contract of Harris from 
Triple-A Richmond. Harris went on to have a career year in 2007. He hit 
near .400 during the month of May and went in to the All-Star Break with 
a .342 average. He led the team with 17 stolen bases. On June 30, Willie 
Harris tied a career personal record with 3 stolen bases in a 6-5 win over 
the Marlins. He posted a remarkable night on July 21: In a 14-6 rout of 
the St. Louis Cardinals, Harris went 6-for-6 with four singles, two triples, 
six RBI, four runs scored, and a stolen base. He became just the second 
player in Atlanta history and the seventh in franchise history to have 
six hits in a game. But Harris' numbers in the second half of the season 
dropped precipitously. He had a .214 average, a .294 on-base percentage, 
and a .354 slugging average after the all-star break. On August 9, the 
Braves were beating the NL East-leading New York Mets 7-3 entering the 
bottom of the 9th at Shea Stadium. After Braves reliever Tyler Yates yielded 
three runs to bring the Mets within one, Óscar Villarreal came on to pitch. 
The first hitter he faced, first baseman Carlos Delgado, hit what appeared 
to be a solo home run to make it a tie game. Harris ranged back in left 
field, stopped just before the wall and jumped, robbing the home run and 
preserving the lead. Harris was designated for assignment on December 4, 
2007. Harris was not offered a new contract by the Braves and became a 
free agent on December 12, 2007. On December 13, 2007, he signed with the 
Washington Nationals. He proved an effective insurance policy, playing 
second base, third base, shortstop and all three outfield positions over 
the course of the season. He was known for playing stellar defense, and 
made several outstanding athletic catches in the outfield. On August 22, 
2008, Willie hit his eleventh and twelfth home runs of the year, including 
his first career grand slam that gave the Nationals a 6-4 lead. He also 
hit a 2-run home run, collected 6 RBI to give him 38 for the season, scored 
3 times, and stole a base in the Nationals' 13 to 5 win against the Chicago 
Cubs at Wrigley Field. Harris finished the season with 13 home runs, six 
more than he hit in the previous seven years of his career combined. During 
the 2008–2009 offseason, he signed a two-year contract with the Nationals, 
worth 3 million dollars (1.5 million per season).[1] On April 13, 2009, 
Willie Harris was placed on the 15-day disabled list for a left oblique 
strain.[2] On September 24, 2010, Harris hit the first inside-the-park 
home run in Nationals history against the Atlanta Braves.[3] On January 
14, 2011, Harris and the New York Mets agreed to a minor-league deal. According 
to reporter Anthony DiComo, Harris "is all but a lock to make the team 
in an arrangement that should net him between 250 and 400 plate appearances" 
in 2011.[4] On January 17, 2011 the Mets and Harris made it official that 
he had signed a minor league contract with the team. He also got an invite 
to Spring training. He played in 126 games for the Mets at all three outfield 
positions as well as second and third base. He had a .351 On Base Percentage 
and an OPS+ of 88. On January 23, 2012, Harris signed with the Cincinnati 
Reds. On June 26, 2012, Willie Harris was outrighted to Triple A.[5] Harris 
was hitting at a .114 clip, with a .170 OBP, 2 RBI, 0 home runs in 44 at-bats
