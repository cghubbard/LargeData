Joel Edward Horlen (born August 14, 1937) is a right-handed former Major 
League Baseball pitcher. Horlen pitched for the Chicago White Sox from 
1961 to 1971, and the Oakland Athletics in 1972. In references, he is called 
Joe Horlen or Joel Horlen with roughly equal frequency.[1] In his career, 
Horlen won 116 games against 117 losses, with a 3.11 earned run average 
and 1,065 strikeouts in 2,002 innings pitched. He is the only baseball 
player to play for teams that won a Pony League World Series (1952), a 
College World Series (Oklahoma State-1959), and a Major League World Series 
(Oakland-1972).[2] Horlen was a star pitcher at Oklahoma State University. 
He was named to the American Baseball Coaches Association All-America second 
team, as he helped lead Oklahoma State to the College World Series in 1959. 
Horlen was signed by the Chicago White Sox in 1959. He made his Major League 
debut against the Minnesota Twins in the second game of a September 4, 
1961 doubleheader. He won the game in relief while wearing a numberless 
uniform —- as the only available road uniform did not have a number. Horlen 
pitched as a spot starter in his first two full seasons with the White 
Sox. In 1964 he earned a spot in the starting rotation, posting a 13–9 
record and setting career bests in earned run average (1.88; 2nd in the 
American League only to Dean Chance's 1.65) and strikeouts (138). He also 
led the majors by allowing only 6.07 hits per 9 innings, bettering Sandy 
Koufax's National League-leading 6.22. In the next 42 years, only 8 right-handed 
pitchers bettered that ratio in a season. He also led the AL in Walks + 
Hits per IP (WHIP) (.935). That year his White Sox battled the New York 
Yankees and Baltimore Orioles for the pennant, but finished second, one 
game behind the Yankees and one game ahead of the Orioles. In 1965 he was 
2nd in the league in shutouts (4), and was 3rd in walks/9 IP (1.60). In 
1966 he led the league in wild pitches (14), was 6th in hit batsmen (6), 
and was 2nd in ERA (2.43). Horlen's best season was in 1967; he finished 
19–7 and led American League pitchers with a 2.06 ERA and 6 shutouts, was 
2nd in W-L percentage (.731), 4th in wins, complete games (13), and walks/9 
IP (2.02), and 7th in innings pitched (258). He also led the AL in Walks 
+ Hits per IP (WHIP) (.953). He was named to the American League All-Star 
team for the only time in his career, but did not pitch in the game. The 
highlight of Horlen's season was a clutch performance on September 10 as 
the White Sox were involved in a four-way pennant race with the Twins, 
Boston Red Sox, and Detroit Tigers; he no-hit the Tigers in the first game 
of a doubleheader at Comiskey Park. Not until the Tigers' Jack Morris no-hit 
the White Sox in 1984 would another no-hitter be pitched in a White Sox 
home game, and the next no-hitter by a White Sox in a White Sox home game 
wouldn't be pitched until 2007, by Mark Buehrle at U.S. Cellular Field. 
Horlen recorded victories in his next three starts, the next one coming 
five days later against the Twins. However, on September 27, which would 
be known by White Sox fans as "Black Wednesday", the lowly Kansas City 
Athletics swept a doubleheader from the White Sox and effectively eliminated 
Eddie Stanky's "Hitless Wonders" (the White Sox led the Majors with a 2.45 
earned run average but also posted a .225 batting average, with no regular 
batting above .250) from pennant contention. Horlen lost the second game, 
with 21-year-old Catfish Hunter shutting out the White Sox 4–0. The two 
games were the last played by the Athletics in Kansas City; they would 
move to Oakland for the start of the 1968 season. The White Sox finished 
fourth, three games behind the Red Sox who, after finishing next to last 
in 1966, won the pennant on the final day, finishing one game ahead of 
the Twins and Tigers. Horlen finished runner-up to Jim Lonborg, the star 
of the Red Sox staff, in the American League Cy Young Award balloting, 
and 4th in MVP voting, won by another Red Sox, Carl Yastrzemski. In 1968 
he led the AL in hit batsmen (14). In 1970 he was 5th in walks/9 IP (2.14). 
In spring training of 1972, two weeks after voting unanimously in favor 
of a strike, the White Sox released Horlen, who had been the Sox’ player 
representative. He later signed with Oakland, and pitched mostly in relief 
as the Athletics won the World Series — the first World Series title for 
the franchise since the Philadelphia Athletics in 1930. In 1989, Horlen 
played for the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional Baseball Association.[3]
