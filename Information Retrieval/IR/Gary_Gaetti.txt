Gary Joseph Gaetti (/ˈɡaɪ.ɛti/; born August 19, 1958), nicknamed "G-Man", 
"Rat", or "Zorn", is an American former third baseman in Major League Baseball 
for the Minnesota Twins (1981–1990), California Angels (1991–1993), Kansas 
City Royals (1993–1995), St. Louis Cardinals (1996–1998), Chicago Cubs 
(1998–1999) and Boston Red Sox (2000). Gaetti won a World Series with Minnesota 
in 1987 and was the MVP of that year's American League Championship Series 
against the Detroit Tigers. In 1987, Gaetti became the first player ever 
to hit home runs in his first two postseason plate appearances. Gaetti 
is the current manager of the independent league Sugar Land Skeeters.[1] 
Gary Gaetti played collegiate baseball for Lake Land College in Mattoon, 
Illinois and Northwest Missouri State University. Legend has it that Gaetti 
holds the record for the longest distance home run in NWMSU baseball history, 
an estimated 505 foot home run. Gaetti was drafted three times before finally 
signing with the Twins: first by the St. Louis Cardinals in the fourth 
round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft (then held annually in January) 
and again in 1978 by the Chicago White Sox in the third round of the June 
secondary draft before he was drafted by the Twins in the first round of 
the June secondary portion of the 1979 draft. Gaetti signed on June 21, 
1979.[2] Gaetti then spent the next three years in the Twins' minor league 
system, playing for the rookie level Elizabethton Twins in the Appalachian 
League in 1979, the A-level Wisconsin Rapids Twins in the Midwest League 
in 1980, and the AA-level Orlando Twins in the Southern League in 1981. 
Gaetti then made his major league debut in nine September games which included 
hitting a home run in his first major league at bat. In 1982, Gaetti would 
become a permanent fixture at third base for the Twins and would man the 
hot corner in Minnesota for the next nine seasons. In 1986, Gaetti batted 
.287 with 34 home runs and 108 runs batted in. Gaetti won four consecutive 
Gold Glove Awards for fielding excellence from 1986 through 1989. Gaetti 
helped propel the Twins to the 1987 post-season and their first World Series 
championship, hitting .257 with 31 home runs and 109 RBI. He also hit himself 
into the record books, with home runs in his first two career postseason 
plate appearances[3] in the American League Championship Series to help 
the Twins upset the Detroit Tigers. Gaetti was selected as an All-Star 
in 1988 and 1989. Playing against the Boston Red Sox on July 17, 1990, 
Gaetti helped the Twins make history as the team became the only team in 
baseball history to turn two triple plays in the same game. Despite their 
defensive heroics, the Twins lost the game 1–0.[4][5] His production at 
the plate would decline[6] and after hitting only .229 in 1990, Gaetti 
left the Twins for the Angels as a free agent. His production continued 
to drop off with the Angels and midway through the third year of his four-year 
contract, he was released, in June 1993. He was almost immediately signed 
by the Royals, who had lost their projected regular third baseman, Keith 
Miller, to injury and had been playing rookie Phil Hiatt at third. Gaetti 
hit 26 home runs for the Royals in 665 at-bats between 1993 and 1994, splitting 
time at third with Miller, David Howard, and Terry Shumpert. In 1995, Gaetti 
played in 137 games and at the age of 36, he hit .261 with 35 home runs 
and 96 RBI, winning his only Silver Slugger,[6] setting a career high in 
home runs and missing the Royals' team record for most home runs in a season 
by one. Following the 1995 season, Gaetti signed as a free agent with the 
Cardinals, where he enjoyed two more productive seasons before being released 
again in August 1998 after the Cardinals' acquisition of Fernando Tatís. 
Gaetti immediately signed with the Cubs, where he hit .320/8/27 as the 
Cubs won the National League wild card. The following season, Gaetti played 
only semi-regularly and was released at the end of the season after hitting 
.204 with 9 home runs. He wound up his career the following season in Boston, 
appearing in five games in April 2000 at the age of 41. Bill James noted 
Gaetti's baseball-related aging process as being unusual for two reasons. 
Unlike most other league veterans, his walk rate never improved and his 
rate of productivity decline was "exceptionally" slow.[7] Gaetti retired 
as the all-time home run king of players who homered in their first Major 
League at bat. Gaetti was used as an emergency relief pitcher by both the 
Cardinals and the Cubs, retiring with an ERA of 7.71 and one strikeout 
in three appearances. Gaetti was inducted into the NWMSU athletic hall 
of fame, the "M-Club", in October 2003. He coached in the Houston Astros 
minor league system as a hitting coach with the AAA New Orleans Zephyrs 
from 2002 to 2004.[8] Gaetti was promoted to hitting coach for the Astros 
on July 14, 2004 when the team dismissed manager Jimy Williams, hitting 
coach Harry Spilman, and pitching coach Burt Hooton. Gaetti remained in 
this position until July 12, 2006, when he was fired by the Astros. Following 
the season, he was hired as the hitting coach for Tampa Bay's AAA affiliate, 
the Durham Bulls – a position he would hold through the 2008 season.[9] 
After working at Baseball USA in Houston, Texas in 2011,[10] Gaetti was 
named the first manager of the Sugar Land Skeeters.[1] The independent 
team began play in 2012. On August 19, 2007, Gaetti's 49th birthday, the 
Minnesota Twins inducted him into the team's Hall of Fame, while the club 
simultaneously released a commemorative bobblehead in his honor. On October 
2, 2008, former Durham Bull, rookie Evan Longoria, joined Gaetti in the 
record books by hitting home runs in his first two postseason at-bats. 
Gaetti's son Joe played collegiate baseball for North Carolina State and 
played in the minor leagues in five different farm systems, including two 
separate stints with the Twins AA-level club, the New Britain Rock Cats. 
After failing to advance beyond the AAA level in the minor leagues, Joe 
ended his career in 2010 playing for the Lancaster Barnstormers of the
