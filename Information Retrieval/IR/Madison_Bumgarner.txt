MLB records Madison Kyle Bumgarner (born August 1, 1989), commonly known 
by his nickname, "MadBum",[1][2] is an American professional baseball pitcher 
for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). Bumgarner 
has won three World Series championships (2010, 2012, 2014) and two Silver 
Slugger Awards (2014, 2015). He has also been selected to four National 
League All-Star teams and is the Giants' strikeout leader by a left-handed 
pitcher in the San Francisco era.[3] Bumgarner played high school baseball 
at South Caldwell High School in Hudson, North Carolina, where he helped 
his team win the 2007 4A State Championship. After graduating, he was selected 
with the tenth overall pick in the 2007 MLB Draft by the San Francisco 
Giants. In his first year playing professionally, 2008, he won the South 
Atlantic League pitching triple crown. He made his major league debut in 
2009 with the Giants. In 2010, he began the season in the minor leagues 
but was called up midway through the season and wound up becoming the youngest 
left-handed pitcher to throw eight scoreless innings in a World Series[citation 
needed] as the Giants won the 2010 World Series, their first since 1954. 
In 2014, Bumgarner set a career high number of wins with 18 and won his 
third World Series as a Giant.[4] Following one of the most dominant postseason 
and World Series pitching performances in modern MLB history, he was named 
the Most Valuable Player of the 2014 World Series, the 2014 Babe Ruth Award 
winner, the 2014 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, and the 2014 
Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. He made history by becoming 
one of only 4 pitchers to ever intentionally bat for himself in a game 
played in an American League park, rather than use the designated hitter.[citation 
needed] Bumgarner was born August 1, 1989, in Hickory, North Carolina, 
and grew up in an area 10 miles away nicknamed "Bumtown" because of the 
abundance of people with the surname Bumgarner who have lived there over 
the years after their ancestors had arrived from Germany.[5][6] He grew 
up in a log house that his father, Kevin, built, sleeping in a loft at 
nights. Bumgarner's first word was "ball", and by the age of four, he was 
already playing in a youth baseball league. His father had to sign a waiver 
because the league was for five- to eight-year-olds. His parents, Kevin 
and Debbie, divorced while Bumgarner was in high school.[5] Much like fellow 
Major League pitcher Brett Cecil, throwing a ball is the only thing Bumgarner 
does left-handed[7] Bumgarner attended South Caldwell High School in Hudson, 
North Carolina, where he was known as "Maddie" to his friends and was a 
member of the Spartans baseball team and a member of Post 29's American 
Legion Baseball team. [8] In his junior season, he had a 12–2 record, an 
0.99 earned run average (ERA), and 120 strikeouts in 84 innings pitched 
as he led his team to a runner-up in the 2006 4A State Championship. Next 
season, he went 11–2 with a 1.05 ERA and 143 strikeouts in 86 innings while 
this time helping his team win the 2007 4A State Championship.[9] He batted 
.424 with 11 home runs and 38 runs batted in.[8] He was named Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) of the playoffs and the Gatorade North Carolina Player of 
the Year, garnering the nickname "The Carolina Peach". In 2013, the North 
Carolina High School Athletic Association included him on its "100 To Remember" 
male athletes list, which included Michael Jordan, Carl Eller, and Jim 
Beatty.[10] Bumgarner attracted so much attention from scouts and agents 
in high school that his father built a wall around the bullpen at his high 
school field to keep them from distracting him as he warmed up for games.[5] 
He committed to attend the University of North Carolina on a college baseball 
scholarship.[9] The San Francisco Giants selected Bumgarner tenth overall 
in the first round of the 2007 MLB draft. Going into the draft, Baseball 
America had ranked him as the 14th best prospect overall. He was the first 
high school pitcher to be selected by the Giants on their first pick since 
Matt Cain in 2002, and the first left-handed pitcher selected in the first 
round by the organization since Noah Lowry in 2001.[9] Bumgarner pitched 
for the Augusta Greenjackets, the Giants' Low-A South Atlantic League affiliate, 
in 2008. The Giants sought for him to alter the angle of his head during 
his delivery, but after Bumgarner struggled over his first three starts 
in Augusta, he reverted to the way he had thrown in high school. With Augusta, 
he worked on the changeup, the slider, and "the ability to pitch inside." 
When asked if it was tough to work on off-speed pitches in a league in 
which most of the hitters can be fooled with the fastball, Bumgarner replied, 
"The minors are all about player development. I needed to work on other 
pitches and have the confidence to throw them."[11] He won the South Atlantic 
League pitchers' Triple Crown, tying for the league lead in wins (15, tied 
with Levi Maxwell), leading the league in earned run average (1.46), and 
leading the league in strikeouts (164).[12] He began the 2009 season with 
the Giants' High-A affiliate, the San Jose Giants of the California League. 
After five starts, in which he went 3–1 with a 1.48 ERA and 23 strikeouts, 
he was called up to the Giants AA affiliate, the Connecticut Defenders 
of the Eastern League. On July 22, he hit a grand slam against Eric Niesen 
and picked up the victory in a 9–3 triumph over the Binghamton Mets.[13] 
In 20 games (19 starts) with them, he went 9–1 with a 1.93 ERA and 69 strikeouts.[14] 
In 2008, Baseball America ranked him the third-best prospect in the Giants 
organization.[15] Before the start of the 2009 season, the magazine ranked 
Bumgarner as the ninth-best prospect in baseball.[16] Entering 2010, he 
dropped to the 14th-best prospect in baseball on the magazine's list, as 
some writers were concerned about a drop in Bumgarner's velocity. Jason 
Grey of ESPN wrote that the drop was "puzzling."[17][18] Bumgarner was 
called up to the majors on September 8, 2009, to make his first major league 
start and debut in place of Tim Lincecum, who was scratched with back spasms. 
At the age of twenty, he became the second youngest pitcher ever to start 
a game for the Giants since the franchise moved west in 1958. He was older 
only than Mike McCormick, who played as a nineteen year old for San Francisco 
but had made his debut with the Giants two years earlier when the team 
was still in New York.[19][20] In the bottom of the third inning with no 
outs, Bumgarner struckout Kevin Correia for his first career strikeout. 
Bumgarner made four appearances with the Giants in 2009, posting an ERA 
of 1.80, striking out ten batters, and pitching ten innings.[8] Bumgarner 
attended the Giants' spring training before the 2010 season, competing 
for the position of fifth starter. However, out of shape after attending 
his half-sister's funeral, he struggled and was sent down to the AAA Fresno 
Grizzlies, partly due to a drop in his velocity.[17][21] In 14 starts with 
Fresno, he went 7–1 with a 3.16 ERA and 59 strikeouts.[14] On June 26, 
2010, Bumgarner was called up again to join the club, facing the Boston 
Red Sox the next day. He replaced Joe Martinez, who had made one start 
in place of an injured Todd Wellemeyer, in the rotation.[22] On July 6, 
2010, against the Milwaukee Brewers in Milwaukee, Bumgarner earned his 
first major league victory, 6–1, going eight innings without yielding a 
run.[23] Bumgarner pitched well enough that when Wellemeyer returned from 
the disabled list in August, Giants' manager Bruce Bochy chose to use him 
in the bullpen and leave Bumgarner in the rotation.[24] In five September 
starts during the Giants' successful run to the National League West Division 
championship, Bumgarner posted an ERA of 1.13.[25] At the end of September, 
Bumgarner earned his first win at home, making him 7–6 on the season. Despite 
a ten-day layoff, Bumgarner became the youngest pitcher in Giants' franchise 
history to pitch in and win a postseason game, which he did against the 
Braves in the NLDS-clinching game on October 11.[25][26] In addition to 
his clinching performance in the NLDS, he pitched two shutout innings in 
relief in the NLCS clinching game versus the Philadelphia Phillies.[27] 
On October 31, Bumgarner pitched eight shutout innings in Game 4 of the 
2010 World Series, becoming the fourth-youngest pitcher to start and win 
a World Series game, as well as the youngest to make a scoreless start 
of six innings or more.[28] This win gave the Giants a 3–1 lead in the 
series, en route to the Giants winning their first World Series championship 
in 56 years.[29] After the season, he was named a starting pitcher on Baseball 
America's 2010 All-Rookie Team.[30] After his start May 13, 2011, Bumgarner 
was 0–5 with a 4.58 ERA in his first seven starts of the season. He struggled 
in his first two games of the season, but soon after regained his post-season 
form. However, he was the victim of poor run support and bad luck.[31] 
Despite pitching at least six innings and giving up more than one earned 
run only once in his five starts from April 27 through May 19, it wasn't 
until the 19th that he got his first win, collecting an ERA of 3.71 for 
the season at that point. By June 9, Bumgarner had a 1.93 ERA over his 
last nine starts, yet had two wins and five losses to show for it. In seven 
of his eight losses at that point, the Giants either only scored once or 
scored no times at all.[32] On September 5, Bumgarner struck out thirteen 
batters while yielding two earned runs, seven hits and one walk over 8.1 
innings while earning the win against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park. 
It was his second consecutive double digit strikeout game, having struck 
out 11 batters in his previous start against the Chicago Cubs.[33] With 
his win September 16, Bumgarner had won five consecutive starts; he finished 
the season 13–13 with a 3.21 ERA, 204 innings pitched, and 191 strikeouts.[32] 
Worth noting, however, is that Bumgarner was 12–1 for the games in which 
his teammates scored three or more runs for him.[8] In April 2012, Bumgarner 
agreed to a six-year contract worth $35.56 million through the 2017 season, 
with additional $12 million options for 2018 and 2019.[34] Bumgarner began 
the 2012 season by going 5–1 with a 2.31 ERA.[35] With his win over the 
Brewers on May 5, he became the first Giant since Jason Schmidt to win 
14 games in a 20-game span.[36] His ERA then rose to 2.85 after he lost 
three consecutive games, with his record moving to 5–4.[35] After May 14, 
the Giants went 16 home games without a home run until Bumgarner hit the 
first of his career into left field on June 12, against Houston Astros 
pitcher Bud Norris. Bumgarner, with his home run and 12 strikeouts, became 
the most recent Giant to hit a home run and throw 10+ strikeouts since 
Mike Krukow, who was announcing the game.[37] On June 28, Bumgarner pitched 
nine shutout innings against the Cincinnati Reds to earn his first complete 
game and shutout. With this victory, the Giants franchise established a 
new San Francisco record for consecutive scoreless innings, a total of 
36.[38] In 2012, Bumgarner won 16 games (with only seven losses) while 
posting a 3.37 ERA and striking out 191 in 208 1⁄3 innings.[8] After struggling 
earlier in the playoffs with an 11.25 ERA,[39] Bumgarner pitched seven 
scoreless innings and struck out eight in Game 2 of the 2012 World Series 
on October 25. Bumgarner became the first pitcher to begin his World Series 
career with 15 scoreless innings since Bruce Hurst did so in 1986.[40] 
Hall of Famer Christy Mathewson in 1905 was the last Giant before Bumgarner 
to have scoreless outings in his first two career World Series starts.[40] 
The 2013 season saw Bumgarner set career bests for ERA (2.77), walks plus 
hits per inning pitched (WHIP) (1.03) and strikeouts (199) in 31 starts, 
finishing with a 13–9 record. Bumgarner's WHIP was the lowest for a Giants' 
left-hander since Carl Hubbell's in 1933. Bumgarner was also selected by 
Giants manager Bruce Bochy and the manager of the National League team, 
to pitch in the All Star game for the first time. However, Bumgarner didn't 
pitch in the game. He took pride in pitching 200+ innings for the third 
consecutive season (201.1) and improving at holding runners on base, conceding 
8 stolen bases in 2013 compared with 27 in 2012.[41] Bumgarner was rested 
for what would have been his final start of the season, following a great 
seven-inning, one-run, 10-strikeout win over the New York Mets. Bochy said 
he wanted to give Bumgarner a break and also allow Barry Zito a final home 
start.[42] Following his outstanding 2013 season, on February 25, Bumgarner 
was named the Giants' Opening Day starter for the first time in his career.[43] 
On April 11, Bumgarner hit his first career grand slam and registered a 
career-high five RBIs against the Colorado Rockies' Jorge de la Rosa, the 
third home run of Bumgarner's major league career.[44] Bumgarner was named 
NL Pitcher of the Month for May after going 5–0 in six starts, with 48 
strikeouts and a 2.08 ERA.[45] On July 13, in an 8–4 win over the Arizona 
Diamondbacks at AT&T Park, Bumgarner and batterymate Buster Posey each 
hit grand slam home runs, marking the first ever occurrence in MLB history 
that batterymates each hit grand slams in the same game.[46] Bumgarner 
also tied the all-time MLB records for grand slams in a career and in a 
single season by a pitcher with two. Tony Cloninger had been the last pitcher 
to hit two grand slams in one season, doing so in one game on July 3, 1966.[citation 
needed] On August 26 at AT&T Park, in a 3–0 win over the Colorado Rockies, 
Bumgarner pitched his second career complete game one-hit shutout, which 
included pitching seven perfect innings to start the game until Justin 
Morneau reached out on a 1–2 pitch that went down deep right field for 
a double. In the process, he set a franchise-record sixth career game with 
ten or more strikeouts and no walks. Bumgarner beat Jorge de la Rosa at 
AT&T Park for the second time that season. Bumgarner was named the NL Pitcher 
of the Month for August. He went 4–1 with a 1.57 ERA, threw three complete 
games, and had 56 strikeouts against just three walks.[47] On September 
12 at AT&T Park, in a 9–0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers Bumgarner struck 
out former teammate Juan Uribe for his 207th strikeout of the season, breaking 
Ray Sadecki's mark and setting a new San Francisco Giants single season 
strikeout record by a left-handed pitcher. Bumgarner set a career-high 
in wins with 18, posting an 18–10 record, a 2.98 ERA, and 219 strikeouts 
for the 2014 MLB regular season. On October 1, Bumgarner pitched a four-hit 
shutout in the NL Wild Card game against the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC 
Park, allowing the Giants to advance to the NLDS against the Washington 
Nationals.[citation needed]. He joins Sandy Koufax from the 1965 World 
Series and Justin Verlander from the 2012 ALDS as the only postseason pitchers 
to pitch a shutout and strikeout ten or more batters in a winner-take-all 
game. On October 11, in Game 1 of the NLCS, by tossing 7 2⁄3 shutout innings 
against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium, Bumgarner set a new, 
all-time MLB pitching record for postseason consecutive scoreless innings 
on the road, with 26 2⁄3. In doing so he broke the 90-year-old record held 
by fellow Giant, Art Nehf. For his performance, he was named NLCS MVP.[48] 
On October 21, in Game 1 of the 2014 World Series, Bumgarner pitched seven 
innings of one-run ball. Although his streak of scoreless innings ended 
at 21 2⁄3 when he gave up a home run to Salvador Pérez in the 7th inning, 
he earned his third career win in World Series competition as his team 
defeated the host Kansas City Royals 7–1 in Kauffman Stadium. Describing 
Bumgarner, Giants manager Bruce Bochy said, "This is a big stage, a loud 
crowd. But he just keeps that maniacal focus. He's as good as anybody I've 
seen at it."[49] Bumgarner threw a four-hit, complete-game shutout in Game 
5 on October 26. He set all-time MLB records for lowest World Series ERA 
(0.29) among pitchers of at least 25 innings pitched, and was the first 
pitcher in Series history to pitch a shutout with no walks and at least 
eight strikeouts.[50] On October 29, in Game 7, on two days rest, Bumgarner 
pitched five scoreless innings in relief in the final game of the World 
Series. This effort drew media comparisons to Barry Bonds, in terms of 
unusual statistical performance.[51] He was named the 2014 World Series 
MVP, finishing the Series with a 2–0 record, 1 save, and a 0.43 ERA.[52] 
In three pitching appearances, Bumgarner gave up one run in 21 innings. 
Some analysts have posited that Bumgarner's entire 2014 postseason record—in 
which the 25-year-old threw a record-breaking 52 2⁄3 innings[53]—was the 
most dominant postseason pitching performance ever.[54] Following the postseason, 
he won the Babe Ruth Award as the postseason MVP and was named Sports Illustrated 
Sportsman of the Year and Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year.[55][56][57] 
In a 4–0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 21, Bumgarner paired up 
and beat Clayton Kershaw for the third time that season, becoming the first 
pitcher to hit a home run off of Kershaw.[58] The homer made Kershaw the 
second Cy Young Award winner to surrender a home run to Bumgarner after 
Zack Greinke. He became the first reigning World Series MVP to homer off 
the defending League MVP.[59] On June 23 at AT&T Park against the San Diego 
Padres, Bumgarner struck out a career-high fourteen batters, tying Atlee 
Hammaker's franchise record for most strikeouts in a single game by a left-handed 
pitcher.[60] On June 28, in a 6–3 win over the Colorado Rockies at AT&T 
Park, Bumgarner had two hits, one a solo home run, scored twice, and struck 
out Brandon Barnes for his one-thousandth career strikeout. He is also 
the third left-handed pitcher in the San Francisco Era and the third youngest 
in franchise history to reach the milestone. Only Amos Rusie (21) and Christy 
Mathewson (25) were younger.[61] On July 14 at the 2015 MLB All-Star Game 
held at Great American Ball Park against the American League, Bumgarner 
appeared in his first career Major League Baseball All-Star Game, pitching 
a scoreless fourth inning for the National League with batterymate Buster 
Posey.[62] On August 11 at AT&T Park, Bumgarner pitched a complete game 
3–1 victory over the Houston Astros where he struck out twelve and walked 
none. During the outing, he struck out a career-high seven straight batters 
to tie a San Francisco record with Juan Marichal and Jonathan Sánchez.[63] 
On August 16, he tied his career-high by striking out fourteen batters, 
including striking out that year's National League MVP Bryce Harper a career-high 
three times, hit a home run, and pitched a complete game shutout against 
the Washington Nationals.[64] He became the first Giants left-handed pitcher 
to record multiple fourteen-strikeout games in a single season and career, 
and joined Juan Marichal as the only Giants pitchers in the San Francisco 
Era to strike out ten or more batters, hit a home run, and record a shutout 
in the same game.[65] Bumgarner was honored for the first time in his career 
with National League Player of the Week honors.[66] Bumgarner logged his 
first career pinch hit in the seventh inning on August 18 at Busch Stadium 
in a 2–0 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. He became the first Giants pitcher 
to record a hit in a pitch-hitting appearance since Kirk Rueter did so 
on August 17, 2004 against the Montreal Expos.[67] On August 21 at PNC 
Park, in a 6–4 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates, Bumgarner hit his fifth 
homer and won his fifteenth game of the season, the first to do so since 
Carlos Zambrano in 2006, and the sixth pitcher since 1970 according to 
SportsCenter.[68][69][70] On August 28 at AT&T Park, in a 9–1 win over 
the Chicago Cubs, Bumgarner struck out twelve batters through six innings, 
logging his third straight game with twelve or more strikeouts.[71] This 
marks the first occurrence a Giants pitcher has struck out twelve or more 
batters in at least three games in a single calendar month since John Montefusco 
in August 1975.[72] On September 1 at Dodger Stadium, Bumgarner paired 
up against Zack Greinke, both of whom batted eighth in the starting lineup. 
It marked the first time in the same Giants-Dodgers game that both pitchers 
batted eighth.[73] He also became the first left-handed pitcher in the 
live-ball era to hit five home runs and strikeout two hundred batters in 
a single season.[74] On September 12 at AT&T Park, in an 8–0 win over the 
San Diego Padres, Bumgarner pitched his third career complete game one-hit 
shutout, including a career-high 7 2⁄3 perfect innings to start the game.[75] 
On September 24 at Petco Park, Bumgarner struck out his 220th batter of 
the season, breaking his own San Francisco Giants single season strikeout 
record by a left-handed pitcher. Bumgarner tied a career-high in wins with 
eighteen, posting an 18–9 record, a 2.93 ERA, and also set career-highs 
with a .667 win percentage, 218.1 innings pitched and 234 strikeouts for 
the 2015 MLB regular season. According to CSN Bay Area, his 234 strikeouts 
are the most by a Giants left-handed pitcher since Rube Marquard struck 
out 237 batters in the 1911 season. He was named the winner of the 2015 
National League Silver Slugger Award at pitcher.[76] On April 9, 2016 at 
AT&T Park, Bumgarner matched up with Clayton Kershaw less than a year after 
hitting his first home run off of Kershaw, and Bumgarner hit another one 
into the left-field seats in nearly exactly the same spot. Since the 2014 
season, Bumgarner, Troy Tulowitzki, and Daniel Murphy are the only three 
players to have homered off of Kershaw multiple times. Over Kershaw's last 
twenty-seven starts, Kershaw has allowed two of his eleven home runs to 
Bumgarner.[77] On June 30, in a 12-6 win over the Oakland Athletics at 
Oakland Alameda Coliseum, Bumgarner was started at pitcher hitting for 
himself in an American League ballpark, the first time this was intentionally 
done in the Majors since 1976, according to SportsCenter, and only the 
fifth time since the creation of the designated hitter rule in 1973. He 
went 1 for 4, opening the third inning with a double and starting a six-run 
rally.[78] On July 10 at AT&T Park, in a 4-0 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
Bumgarner pitched his fourth career complete game one-hit shutout and third 
career game by striking out fourteen batters, tying his career-high and 
extending his record, including striking out a career-high nine batters 
via his curveball. Bumgarner's four career one-hitters are the most by 
a Giants pitcher in the last one hundred years, not since Christy Mathewson's 
six career one-hitters. Bumgarner struck out eleven batters through five 
innings, also a career-high. He also carried a no-hitter through 7 1⁄3 
innings until it was broken up by Jake Lamb. Bumgarner tied Christy Mathewson 
for second all-time in franchise history in double-digit strikeout games.[79][80] 
Bumgarner is the fourth pitcher in the last three seasons to carry at least 
three no-hit bids into the seventh inning or further. The others are Jake 
Arrieta with four and Max Scherzer and Marco Estrada who also have three.[citation 
needed] On July 31 at AT&T Park, in a 3-1 win over the Washington Nationals 
and in support of fellow rotation mate Matt Cain's one hundredth career 
win, Bumgarner pinch-hit for him after Cain threw five no-hit innings on 
ninety-three pitches. Bumgarner would hit an opposite-field leadoff double 
off the bricks, becoming the first Giants pitcher to record a pinch-hit 
double in a pitch-hitting appearance since Ray Sadecki did so in 1967, 
according to CSN Bay Area. The Giants inserted pinch-runner and another 
fellow rotation mate Jeff Samardzija, who would score later in the inning, 
marking the first occurrence in a San Francisco Giants game that a pinch-hitting 
pitcher reached base, was substituted for by a pinch-running pitcher, and 
scored a run.[81][82][83] On August 23 at Dodger Stadium, Bumgarner struck 
out Los Angeles Dodgers batter Rob Segedin for his two hundredth strikeout 
of the season, becoming the first left-handed pitcher in Giants franchise 
history to accomplish the feat for three straight seasons, and tying Christy 
Mathewson for second all-time behind Amos Rusie, Juan Marichal, and Tim 
Lincecum's four.[84][85][86] On September 3 at Wrigley Field, in a 3-2 
win over the Chicago Cubs, Bumgarner won his second game of the season 
facing the eventual World Series Champion Chicago Cubs and out-dueled their 
defending Cy Young Award winner Jake Arrieta, who much like Bumgarner is 
also a candidate again for the award this season. Bumgarner struck out 
ten batters and walked nobody, notching his thirtieth career double-digit 
strikeout game, surpassing Christy Mathewson's twenty-nine for second place 
in Giants franchise history behind only former rotation mate Tim Lincecum's 
thirty-six.[87][88][89] On September 20 at Dodger Stadium, Bumgarner struck 
out ten Los Angeles Dodgers batters and walked nobody, extending his franchise 
record and in the process struck out his two-hundredth and thirty-fifth 
batter of the season, which broke his own San Francisco Giants single-season 
strikeout record by a left-handed pitcher for the third consecutive year.[90] 
In addition to striking out his 240th batter of the season, he broke a 
Giants all-time franchise record for strikeouts in a single season by a 
left-handed pitcher that lasted 118 years. The former record holder Cy 
Seymour struck out 239 batters in 1898, leading the National League for 
the second consecutive year, and Bumgarner finished the night with 241 
for the season.[91] In his next start on September 24 at Petco Park against 
the San Diego Padres, by striking out Jon Jay for his 245th batter of the 
season, Bumgarner broke the previous record. He also registered his ninth 
career multi-hit game, including a career-high two doubles.[citation needed] 
On September 30 at AT&T Park, in a 9-3 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
Bumgarner won his one hundredth career game. According to CSN Bay Area, 
at age 27 years and 60 days, he became the third youngest pitcher in franchise 
history, the youngest left-handed pitcher, and the youngest in the San 
Francisco Era to reach the milestone. He broke Juan Marichal's San Francisco 
milestone when Marichal was 27 years, 288 days old in 1965. Only Hal Schumacher 
(24 years and 234 days in 1938) and Christy Mathewson (24 years and 262 
days in 1905) were younger. He became the seventh pitcher in the San Francisco 
Era to reach the milestone and the third Giant to win his one hundredth 
career game on the 2016 season, joining fellow rotation mates Johnny Cueto 
and Matt Cain.[92][93][94][95][96] In the 2016 National League Wild Card 
Game, Bumgarner pitching his second career complete game four-hit shutout 
to give him the most career complete game shutouts in the history of the 
Wild Card and and setting the Major League record for most career complete 
game shutout wins in winner-take-all-games. This marks Bumgarner's third 
career postseason shutout which is tied for second all-time behind Christy 
Mathewson's four. He also tied Tom Glavine's Major League record for most 
career postseason starts without giving up a run. He also lowered his Major 
League career postseason road ERA record to a microscopic 0.50.[97] Bumgarner's 
repertoire consists of four pitches including a curveball he throws at 
two different speeds with two different types of movement. He features 
a four-seam fastball in the 90 to 93 miles per hour (145 to 150 km/h) range 
that tops off at 95 mph, a cutter around 86 to 90 miles per hour (138 to 
145 km/h), a curveball that usually ranges from 75 to 78 miles per hour 
(121 to 126 km/h) with sharp, mostly downward break, but he occasionally 
throws a much slower curve with a more exaggerated and horizontal break 
in the mid-to-high 60 miles per hour range, and a change-up that sits at 
82 to 85 miles per hour (132 to 137 km/h). The fastball and cutter are 
his main pitches; through 2013, he has thrown the fastball 43.68% of the 
time and the cutter 33.84% of the time.[98] Madison has a unique pitching 
style. As he throws, it appears he is throwing toward first base. The only 
two remaining teams in MLB that Bumgarner has not pitched against are the 
Chicago White Sox and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. On December 8,

minutes from where he grew up in the old furniture manufacturing area of 
the state, and during the season in a condo in San Francisco.[5][107] Bumgarner 
has been a Baptist since his childhood.[5][108] Andrew Baggarly, a reporter 
who covers the Giants, wrote of Bumgarner, "While I wouldn't describe him 
as outgoing, he struck me as being smart, well spoken and polite. He is 
deeply Christian and seems to be very grounded."[11] Bumgarner had a half-sister, 
Dena, who died in 2010 reportedly from accidentally overdosing on pain 
medication following hospitalization[109] from cancer.[5] Bumgarner has
