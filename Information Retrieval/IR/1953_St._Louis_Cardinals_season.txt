The 1953 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 72nd season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and the 62nd season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
83–71 during the season and finished 3rd in the National League. Prior 
to the start of the season, August A. Busch, Jr. of Anheuser-Busch bought 
the team from Fred Saigh. That started a reign that would last until March, 
1996, when William DeWitt, Jr., Drew Baur and Fred Hanser bought the club. 
Realizing the Cardinals now had more resources than he could possibly match, 
Bill Veeck, owner of the St. Louis Browns decided to search for another 
city to which to move the Browns. As a first step, he sold Sportsman's 
Park to the Cardinals. He would have probably had to sell the park in any 
case; the park had fallen into disrepair over the years, and the city had 
threatened to have it condemned. With the Browns' declining revenues – 
despite collecting rent from the Cardinals – Veeck could not afford to 
bring it up to code. Busch heavily renovated the 44-year-old park and renamed 
it Busch Stadium. Within a year, Veeck also sold the Browns to Jerold Hoffberger 
and Clarence Miles, and the new owners moved them to Baltimore as the Orioles.
