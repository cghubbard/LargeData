Daniel Anthony Otero (born February 19, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher of Cuban descent, who currently plays for the Cleveland 
Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the San 
Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics. Otero went to Ransom Everglades 
High School in Coconut Grove, Florida. He began his college baseball career 
at Duke University, where he played for the Duke Blue Devils baseball team 
in the Atlantic Coast Conference from 2004 through 2006. Playing collegiate 
summer baseball in the summer of 2005, he helped the Newport Gulls win 
their third New England Collegiate Baseball League championship. Otero 
transferred to the University of South Florida (USF), where he played his 
senior season with the South Florida Bulls baseball team in the Big East 
Conference. The San Francisco Giants drafted Otero out of USF in the 21st 
round (644th overall) of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. They added 
him to the 40 man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft after the 
2011 season.[1] Otero made the club's Opening Day roster in 2012.[2] Otero 
won the 2012 Harry S. Jordan Award, which is given in recognition of the 
player in his first big league camp whose performance and dedication in 
Spring Training best exemplifies the Giants' spirit.[3] In his major league 
debut, on April 7, 2012, Otero recorded his first career major league strikeout 
against Justin Upton.[4] On March 26, 2013, he was claimed off waivers 
by the New York Yankees.[5] The Yankees designated him for assignment the 
next day.[6] Otero was then claimed off waivers by the Oakland Athletics 
on March 29, 2013, and immediately optioned to the Triple-A Sacramento 
River Cats.[7] Otero was designated for assignment after the club acquired 
Stephen Vogt from the Tampa Bay Rays on April 5, 2013.[8] He was outrighted 
to Sacramento on April 7.[citation needed] On June 14, 2013, he was brought 
up from Sacramento as Hideki Okajima was optioned down.[9] He had his first 
major-league win in relief of A.J. Griffin on July 2, 2013 against the 
Chicago Cubs.[10] On September 30, 2014, Otero was the losing pitcher in 
the 2014 American League Wild Card Game, giving up two earned runs in the 
bottom of the 12th inning. On November 3, 2015, Otero was claimed off of 
waivers by the Philadelphia Phillies.[11] They designated him for assignment 
on December 11[12] and traded him to the Cleveland Indians for cash considerations
