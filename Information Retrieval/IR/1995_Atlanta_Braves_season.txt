The 1995 Atlanta Braves season was the 125th season in the history of the 
franchise and 30th season in the city of Atlanta. The team finished the 
strike-shortened season with a record of 90–54, the best in the National 
League, en route to winning the World Series. For the sixth straight season, 
the team was managed by Bobby Cox.[1] The Braves started the season in 
mediocre fashion, posting a 20–17 record up to June 4, putting them in 
third place behind the Philadelphia Phillies and the Montreal Expos. The 
team went on to win twenty of the last twenty-five games before the All-Star 
Break to put themselves in first place by four and a half games. In the 
second half of the season, the Braves pulled away from the rest of the 
division by going 11–7 over the rest of July and 19–10 in August. The team 
went on to win the division by twenty-one games. The Braves' 90–54 record 
was second only to the American League's Cleveland Indians, who went 100–44 
on the season. The National League East title was the first of 11 consecutive 
NL East titles and the fourth of 14 consecutive division titles for the 
Braves (The Braves won the NL West from 1991–93).[1] In the postseason, 
the Braves beat the Colorado Rockies in the NL Division Series three games 
to one, then swept the Cincinnati Reds four games to zero to win the NL 
Championship Series. In the World Series, the Braves beat the Cleveland 
Indians four games to two, bringing the first (and currently only) World 
Championship to the city of Atlanta.[1] Through completion of the 2015 
MLB season, the Braves are the only team out of eight MLB franchises to 
have first swept their opponent in the League Championship Series (LCS), 
and subsequently go onto win the World Series. This two-decades-long milestone 
for Atlanta is based upon the (LCS) becoming a best-of-seven (games) format 
10 years earlier, 1985. Opening Day starter Greg Maddux led the National 
League in wins (19) and earned run average (1.63) to secure his fourth 
consecutive Cy Young Award.[2][3] Marquis Grissom won a Gold Glove for 
center field,[4] and Greg Maddux won his sixth (of thirteen) consecutive 
Gold Gloves.[5] The Braves 1995 season began without some of the regular 
contributors of 1994. The team lost Terry Pendleton, Dave Gallagher, and 
Bill Pecota to free agency. Roberto Kelly and Tony Tarasco were also traded 
with Esteban Yan to the Montreal Expos for Marquis Grissom. They signed 
free agents Mike Sharperson, Dwight Smith, and Mike Stanton. The Braves 
five starting pitchers remained the same from 1994.[6] The Braves would 
also be playing in the brand–new National League East in 1995. The division 
was formed through realignment prior to the 1994 Major League Baseball 
season, but division championships were not awarded in 1994 due to the 
1994 strike. The division includes the Philadelphia Phillies, the Montreal 
Expos, the Florida Marlins, and the New York Mets.[7] Atlanta wins series,
