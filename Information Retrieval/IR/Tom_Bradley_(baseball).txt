Thomas William Bradley (born March 16, 1947) is an American baseball coach 
and former professional player. He pitched in Major League Baseball from 
1969 to 1975. After being drafted by the California Angels in 1968, Bradley 
made his Major League debut for them on Sept. 9, 1969. It was not an auspicious 
one, Bradley being roughed up in a seven-run inning by the Minnesota Twins 
and taking the loss in an 11-7 defeat. He entered the game in the sixth 
inning and gave up a leadoff single to Cesar Tovar and a two-run homer 
by Leo Cardenas. With two more men on base after Rod Carew reached on an 
error, Tony Oliva hit a two-run double and Bradley was lifted from the 
game. He was traded on Nov. 30, 1970 to the Chicago White Sox and promptly 
became one of the team's most reliable starting pitchers. Bradley's 1971 
season included a 15-15 record and six shutouts, his 39 starts being the 
third-highest total in the American League that season. One of his most 
impressive starts came early in the season, when Bradley threw a four-hit 
shutout against the Oakland A's on April 17, 1971 at Comiskey Park, striking 
out 10, including Reggie Jackson three times. After another 15-win season 
a year later, the White Sox traded him to the San Francisco Giants, where 
Bradley had a 13-12 record in 1973. He finished his MLB career with the 
Giants in 1975. Bradley served as the head baseball coach at his alma mater, 
the University of Maryland, College Park, from 1991 to 2000. As coach, 
his Maryland Terrapins achieved a record of 243–306–5 (.439). His Atlantic 
Coast Conference (ACC) record stands at 57–173 (.248). He had more success 
coaching at Jacksonville University, where he coached the Dolphins. From 
1979 to 1990, he compiled a 432–291–5 (.597) record. In 2001, Bradley managed 
the Medicine Hat Blue Jays in the Pioneer League. He served as a pitching 
coach for the Midwest League's Lansing Lugnuts, a Blue Jays affiliate, 
in 2005. He remained in the Midwest League for the 2006 season, joining 
the San Diego Padres' affiliate, the Fort Wayne Wizards, as their pitching 
coach. Bradley spent the 2007 season as the pitching coach for the Padres's 
short-season Northwest League affiliate, the Eugene Emeralds. He returned
