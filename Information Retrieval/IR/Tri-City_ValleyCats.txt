The Tri-City ValleyCats (often shortened to 'Cats) are a minor league baseball 
team based in Troy, New York, and the 2010 and 2013 champions of the New 
York–Penn League (NYPL). The ValleyCats are the Short-Season A classification 
affiliate of the Houston Astros Major League Baseball club. The name Tri-City 
is based on the three nearby cities of Albany, Schenectady and Troy, which 
make up New York State's Capital District. The ValleyCats play at Joseph 
L. Bruno Stadium which opened in 2002 on the campus of Hudson Valley Community 
College located in Troy. They compete in the Stedler Division with the 
Vermont Lake Monsters, Connecticut Tigers, and Lowell Spinners. Prior to 
their arrival in Troy, the club was based first in Little Falls, New York, 
as the Little Falls Mets from 1977 to 1988, and then in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 
as the Pittsfield Mets (1989-2000), and Pittsfield Astros (2001). The ValleyCats 
played their first game on the road in Lowell, Massachusetts, on Tuesday, 
June 18, 2002, against their rival the Lowell Spinners. The Spinners had 
a 3–1 lead going into the 8th inning, but a triple by Aneudi Cuevas down 
the right field line drove in three runs leading the ValleyCats to a 5–4 
victory. In their 2006 season, the ValleyCats registered an attendance 
of 129,126 in 37 contests, averaging 3,489 fans per game. On July 4, 2006, 
the ValleyCats set a new all-time home attendance mark as 6,123 people 
attended a game against their rival the Lowell Spinners which was later 
broken in the following years. The Valley Cats hosted the 4th annual New 
York–Penn League All Star Game at Joseph L. Bruno Stadium in 2008. The 
game was played between teams made up of the affiliates of National League 
(NL) and American League (AL) teams. The ValleyCats, affiliate's of the 
National League's Houston Astros, were part of the NL squad. Four ValleyCats 
were voted to play in the game: first baseman Phil Disher, left fielder 
Jack Shuck, pitcher Philip Rummel, and center fielder Thomas Steele. However, 
Steele was injured two weeks before the game and was replaced by Tri-City 
third baseman David Flores. The NL All Stars won the game on a walk-off 
RBI by ValleyCats third baseman David Flores. Flores was also voted MVP 
of the game.[1] On June 21, 2008, pitchers Shane Wolf, David Miller, and 
Ashton Mowdy combined to throw the first no-hitter in the franchise's history. 
Wolf is a native of nearby Lansing, New York. The final score of the game 
was 10–0 over the Oneonta Tigers.[2] On July 4, 2008, The ValleyCats once 
again broke their single game attendance record drawing 6,630 to the ballpark, 
2,130 more than the listed ballpark capacity. The ValleyCats won, 9–2, 
against the Jamestown Jammers.[3] The ValleyCats also set a season attendance 
record in 2008 with 140,631 fans in attendance despite missing many games 
due to rain delays. On September 5, 2008, the ValleyCats extended their 
PDC (player development contract) with the Houston Astros through the 2010 
season.[4] The ValleyCats once again broke attendance records in 2009. 
Their single game attendance record was broken again on July 4 against 
the Brooklyn Cyclones. 6,838 fans attended the game that the ValleyCats 
ultimately lost, 2–1.[5] The ValleyCats also set a new single season attendance 
record, attracting 145,976 fans to Joseph L. Bruno Stadium in 2009.[6] 
The ValleyCats finished the season in fourth place in the Stedler Division, 
18 games behind the first place Lowell Spinners.[7] After three losing 
seasons, the ValleyCats finally turned around to be one of the front runners 
of the Stedler Division. They were the underdog in the 2010 NY–Penn League 
playoffs with a 38–36 record, winning their division by a half game over 
the Connecticut Tigers, but found themselves back in the championship series 
for the third time in their short history, later beating the heavy favorite 
Brooklyn Cyclones and their 51–24 record two games to none. [Jim Pankovits], 
the manager of the ValleyCats, left the Astros organization during the 
off-season to become the manager of Seattle Mariners double-A team the 
Jackson Generals. The Astros extended their PDC thru 2012. Stubby Clapp, 
who was previously the hitting coach for the Astros' single-A affiliate, 
the Lexington Legends, became the ValleyCats new manager. The Valley Cats 
have several mascots, the two most prominent being Southpaw and his grandfather, 
Pappy. Southpaw is a jersey-wearing cat, representing the "ValleyCat", 
the team's nickname. Another fan favorite is Sammy Baseball who wears a 
patriotic costume and represents Uncle Sam, reputedly derived from Samuel 
Wilson who operated a meat packing plant in Troy. The Tri-City Mayors, 
large caricature heads representing the current Mayors of Troy, Albany, 
and Schenectady, race (and dance) on a nightly basis at the ballpark. Ketchup, 
Mustard, and Relish mascots participate in the hot dog race. Other mascots 
include Spiedie the Chicken, Ribbie the Pig, Zoggy the Dinosaur, and Rowdy 
the River Rat, obtained when the Albany River Rats moved to Charlotte, 
North Carolina.[8] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches
