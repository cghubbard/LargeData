MLB Records: Henry Louis "Hank" Aaron (born February 5, 1934), nicknamed 
"Hammer", or "Hammerin' Hank", is a retired American Major League Baseball 
(MLB) right fielder. He played 21 seasons for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves 
in the National League (NL) and 2 seasons for the Milwaukee Brewers in 
the American League (AL), from 1954 through 1976. Aaron held the MLB record 
for career home runs for 33 years, and he still holds several MLB offensive 
records. He hit 24 or more home runs every year from 1955 through 1973, 
and is one of only two players to hit 30 or more home runs in a season 
at least fifteen times.[1] In 1999, The Sporting News ranked Aaron fifth 
on its "100 Greatest Baseball Players" list. Aaron was born and raised 
in and around Mobile, Alabama. Aaron had seven siblings, including Tommie 
Aaron, who later played in MLB with him. Aaron appeared briefly in the 
Negro American League and in minor league baseball before starting his 
major league career.[2] He played late in Negro league history; by his 
final MLB season, Aaron was the last Negro league baseball player on a 
major league roster. Aaron played the vast majority of his MLB games in 
right field, though he appeared at several other infield and outfield positions. 
In his last two seasons, he was primarily a designated hitter.[3] Aaron 
was an NL All-Star for 20 seasons and an AL All-Star for 1 season, from 
1955 through 1975. Aaron holds the record for the most seasons as an All-Star, 
the most All-Star Game selections (25),[a] and is tied with Willie Mays 
and Stan Musial for the most All-Star Games played (24). He was a Gold 
Glove winner for three seasons. In 1957, he was the NL Most Valuable Player 
(MVP) when the Milwaukee Braves won the World Series. He won the NL Player 
of the Month award in May 1958 and June 1967. Aaron holds the MLB records 
for the most career runs batted in (RBI) (2,297), extra base hits (1,477), 
and total bases (6,856). Aaron is also in the top five for career hits 
(3,771) and runs (2,174). He is one of only four players to have at least 
seventeen seasons with 150 or more hits.[4] Aaron is in second place in 
home runs (755) and at-bats (12,364), and in third place in games played 
(3,298). At the time of his retirement, Aaron held most of the game's key 
career power hitting records. Since his retirement, Aaron has held front 
office roles with the Atlanta Braves. He was inducted into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. In 1999, MLB introduced the Hank Aaron Award 
to recognize the top offensive players in each league. He was awarded the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. He was named a 2010 Georgia Trustee 
by the Georgia Historical Society in recognition of accomplishments that 
reflect the ideals of Georgia's founders. Aaron resides near Atlanta.[5] 
Aaron was born in Mobile, Alabama, to Herbert Aaron, Sr. and Estella (Pritchett) 
Aaron.[6][7] He had seven siblings.[6] Tommie Aaron, one of his brothers, 
also went on to play Major League Baseball. By the time Aaron retired, 
he and his brother held the record for most career home runs by a pair 
of siblings (768). They were also the first siblings to appear in a League 
Championship Series as teammates.[8] While he was born in a section of 
Mobile referred to as "Down the Bay", he spent most of his youth in Toulminville. 
Aaron grew up in a poor family.[6] His family could not afford baseball 
equipment, so he practiced by hitting bottle caps with sticks. He would 
create his own bats and balls out of materials he found on the streets.[9] 
His boyhood idol was baseball star Jackie Robinson.[10] Aaron attended 
Central High School as a freshman and a sophomore. Like most high schools 
they did not have organized baseball, and so he played outfield and third 
base for the Mobile Black Bears, a semipro team.[11] Hank Aaron was a member 
in the Boy Scouts of America. Although he batted cross-handed (i.e., as 
a right-handed hitter, with his left hand above his right), Aaron established 
himself as a power hitter. As a result, in 1949, at the age of fifteen, 
Aaron had his first tryout with an MLB franchise, the Brooklyn Dodgers; 
however, he did not make the team.[2][12] After this, Aaron returned to 
school to finish his secondary education, attending the Josephine Allen 
Institute, a private high school in Alabama. During his junior year, Aaron 
first joined the Pritchett Athletics,[12] followed by the Mobile Black 
Bears, an independent Negro league team.[6] While on the Bears, Aaron earned 
$3 per game ($91 today), which was a dollar more than he got while on the 
Athletics.[12] On November 20, 1951, baseball scout Ed Scott signed Aaron 
to a contract on behalf of the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American 
League where he played three months.[13][14] He started play as a 6 feet 
(180 cm), 180 pounds (82 kg), shortstop,[15] and earned $200 per month.[16] 
As a result of his standout play with the Indianapolis Clowns, Aaron received 
two offers from MLB teams via telegram, one from the New York Giants and 
the other from the Boston Braves. Years later, Aaron remembered: While 
with the Clowns he experienced some overt racism. His team was in Washington, 
D.C.: The Howe Sports Bureau credits Aaron with a .366 batting average 
in 26 official Negro league games, with 5 home runs, 33 runs batted in 
(RBI), 41 hits, and 9 stolen bases.[19] The Braves purchased Aaron from 
the Clowns for $10,000,[20] which GM John Quinn thought a steal as he stated 
that he felt that Aaron was a $100,000 property.[16] On June 12, 1952, 
Aaron signed with Braves' scout Dewey Griggs.[16] During this time, he 
picked up the nickname 'pork chops' because it "was the only thing I knew 
to order off the menu."[21] A teammate later said, "the man ate pork chops 
three meals a day, two for breakfast."[22] The Braves assigned Aaron to 
the Eau Claire Bears, the Braves' Northern League Class-C farm team.[6] 
The 1952 season proved to be very beneficial for Aaron. Playing in the 
infield, Aaron continued to develop as a ballplayer and made the Northern 
League's All-Star team.[6] He broke his habit of hitting cross-handed and 
adopted the standard hitting technique. By the end of the season, he had 
performed so well that the league made him the unanimous choice for Rookie 
of the Year.[2][6] Although he appeared in just 87 games, he scored 89 
runs, had 116 hits, nine home runs, and 61 RBI.[6] In addition, Aaron hit 
for a .336 batting average.[6] During his minor league experience, he was 
very homesick and faced constant racism, but his brother, Herbert Jr., 
told him not to give up the opportunity.[23] In 1953, the Braves promoted 
him to the Jacksonville Braves, their Class-A affiliate in the South Atlantic 
League.[6] Helped by Aaron's performance, the Braves won the league championship 
that year. Aaron led the league in runs (115), hits (208), doubles (36), 
RBI (125), total bases (338), and batting average (.362).[6] He won the 
league's Most Valuable Player Award.[6][11] and had such a dominant year 
that one sportswriter was prompted to say, "Henry Aaron led the league 
in everything except hotel accommodations."[24] Aaron's time with the Braves 
did not come without problems. He was one of the first African Americans 
to play in the league.[25] The 1950s were a period of racial segregation 
in parts of the United States, especially the southeastern portion of the 
country. When Aaron traveled around Jacksonville, Florida, and the surrounding 
areas, he was often separated from his team because of Jim Crow laws. In 
most circumstances, the team was responsible for arranging housing and 
meals for its players, but Aaron often had to make his own arrangements.[26] 
The Braves' manager, Ben Geraghty, tried his best to help Aaron on and 
off the field. Former Braves minor league player and sportswriter Pat Jordan 
said, "Aaron gave [Geraghty] much of the credit for his own swift rise 
to stardom."[27] That same year, Aaron met his future wife, Barbara Lucas. 
The night they met, Lucas decided to attend the Braves' game. Aaron singled, 
doubled, and hit a home run in the game. On October 6, Aaron and Lucas 
married.[28] In 1958, Aaron's wife noted that during the offseason he liked 
"to sit and watch those shooting westerns." He also enjoyed cooking and 
fishing.[28] Aaron spent the winter of 1953 playing in Puerto Rico. Mickey 
Owen, the team's manager, helped Aaron with his batting stance. Up to that 
time, Aaron hit most pitches to left field or center field, but after working 
with Owen, Aaron was able to hit the ball more effectively all over the 
field.[2][better source needed] During his stay in Puerto Rico, Owen also 
helped Aaron to transition from second baseman to outfielder. Aaron had 
not played well at second base, but Owen had noted that Aaron could catch 
fly balls and throw the ball well from the outfield to the infield.[29] 
The stint in Puerto Rico also allowed Aaron to avoid being drafted into 
military service. Though the Korean War was over, people were still being 
drafted. The Braves were able to speak to the draft board, making the case 
that Aaron could be the player to integrate the Southern Association the 
following season with the Atlanta Crackers. The board appears to have been 
convinced, as Aaron was not drafted.[29] 1954 saw Aaron attending spring 
training with the major league club. Although he was on the roster of its 
farm club, Milwaukee manager Charley Grimm later stated, "From the start, 
he did so well I knew we were going to have to carry him."[16] On March 
13, 1954, Milwaukee Braves left fielder Bobby Thomson fractured his ankle 
while sliding into second base during a spring training game. The next 
day, Aaron made his first spring training start for the Braves' major league 
team, playing in left field and hitting a home run.[11] This led Hank Aaron 
to a major league contract, signed on the final day of spring training, 
and a Braves uniform with the number five.[30] On April 13, Aaron made 
his major league debut and was hitless in five at-bats against the Cincinnati 
Reds' left-hander Joe Nuxhall.[31] In the same game, Eddie Mathews hit 
two home runs, the first of a record 863 home runs the pair would hit as 
teammates. On April 15, Aaron collected his first major league hit, a double 
off Cardinals' pitcher Vic Raschi.[32] Aaron hit his first major league 
home run on April 23, also off Raschi.[6] Over the next 122 games, Aaron 
batted .280 with thirteen homers before he suffered a fractured ankle on 
September 5. He then changed his number to 44, which would turn out to 
look like a "lucky number" for the slugger. Aaron would hit 44 home runs 
in four different seasons,[33] and he hit his record-breaking 715th career 
home run off Dodgers pitcher Al Downing, who coincidentally also wore number 
44.[34] At this point, Aaron was known to family and friends primarily 
as "Henry." Braves' public relations director Don Davidson, observing Aaron's 
quiet, reserved nature, began referring to him publicly as "Hank" in order 
to suggest more accessibility. The nickname quickly gained currency, but 
"Henry" continued to be cited frequently in the media, both sometimes appearing 
in the same article, and Aaron would answer to either one. During his rookie 
year, his other well-known nicknames, "Hammerin' Hank" (by teammates) and 
"Bad Henry" (by opposing pitchers) are reported to have arisen.[35] Aaron 
hit .314 with 27 home runs and 106 RBI, in 1955. He was named to the NL 
All-Star roster for the first time; it was the first of a record 21 All-Star 
selections and first of a record 25 All-Star Game appearances.[36][37] 
In 1956, Aaron hit .328 and captured the first of two NL batting titles. 
He was also named The Sporting News NL Player of the Year. In 1957, Aaron 
won his only NL MVP Award,[6] as he had his first brush with the triple 
crown.[38] He batted .322, placing third, and led the league in home runs 
and runs batted in.[6] On September 23, 1957, Aaron hit a two-run game-ending 
home run in Milwaukee, clinching the pennant for the Braves and being carried 
off the field by his teammates. Milwaukee went on to win the World Series 
against the New York Yankees, the defending champions.[6] Aaron did his 
part by hitting .393 with three homers and seven RBI. On December 15, 1957, 
his wife gave birth to twins.[28] Two days later, one of the children succumbed.[28] 
In 1958, Aaron hit .326, with 30 home runs and 95 RBIs. He led the Braves 
to another pennant, but this time they lost a seven-game World Series to 
the Yankees. Aaron finished third in the MVP race and he received his first 
of three Gold Glove Awards. During the next several years, Aaron had some 
of his best games and best seasons as a major league player. On June 21, 
1959, against the San Francisco Giants, he hit three two-run home runs. 
It was the only time in his career that he hit three home runs in a game.[39] 
In 1963, Aaron nearly won the triple crown. He led the league with 44 home 
runs and 130 RBI and finished third in batting average.[nb 1] In that season, 
Aaron became the third player to steal 30 bases and hit 30 home runs in 
a single season. Despite that, he again finished third in the MVP voting. 
The Braves moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta after the 1965 season. In 1968, 
Aaron was the first Atlanta Braves player to hit his 500th career home 
run, and in 1970, he was the first Atlanta Brave to reach 3,000 career 
hits.[40] During his days in Atlanta, Aaron reached a number of milestones; 
he was only the eighth player ever to hit 500 career home runs, with his 
500th coming against Mike McCormick of the San Francisco Giants on July 
14, 1968—exactly one year after former Milwaukee Braves teammate Eddie 
Mathews had hit his 500th.[41] Aaron was, at the time, the second-youngest 
player to reach that plateau.[nb 2] On July 31, 1969, Aaron hit his 537th 
home run, passing Mickey Mantle's total; this moved Aaron into third place 
on the career home run list, after Willie Mays and Babe Ruth. At the end 
of the 1969 season, Aaron again finished third in the MVP voting. In 1970, 
Aaron reached two more career milestones. On May 17, Aaron collected his 
3,000th hit, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, the team against which 
he played his first game.[42] Aaron established the record for most seasons 
with thirty or more home runs in the National League. On April 27, 1971, 
Aaron hit his 600th career home run, the third major league player ever 
to do so. On July 13, Aaron hit a home run in the All-Star Game (played 
at Detroit's Tiger Stadium) for the first time. He hit his 40th home run 
of the season against the Giants' Jerry Johnson on August 10, which established 
a National League record for most seasons with 40 or more home runs (seven). 
At age 37, he hit a career-high 47 home runs during the season (along with 
a career-high .669 slugging percentage) and finished third in MVP voting 
for the sixth time. During the strike-shortened season of 1972, Aaron tied 
and then surpassed Willie Mays for second place on the career home run 
list. Aaron also knocked in the 2,000th run of his career and hit a home 
run in the first All-Star game played in Atlanta. As the year came to a 
close, Aaron broke Stan Musial's major league record for total bases (6,134). 
Aaron finished the season with 673 home runs. Aaron himself downplayed 
the "chase" to surpass Babe Ruth, while baseball enthusiasts and the national 
media grew increasingly excited as he closed in on the 714 career home 
runs record. Aaron received thousands of letters every week during the 
summer of 1973, including hate mail; the Braves ended up hiring a secretary 
to help him sort through it.[43] Aaron (then age 39) hit 40 home runs in 
392 at-bats, ending the 1973 season one home run short of the record. He 
hit home run number 713 on September 29, 1973, and with one day remaining 
in the season, many expected him to tie the record. But in his final game 
that year, playing against the Houston Astros (managed by Leo Durocher, 
who had once roomed with Babe Ruth), he was unable to achieve this. After 
the game, Aaron stated that his only fear was that he might not live to 
see the 1974 season. [44] He was the recipient of death threats during 
the 1973–1974 offseason and a large assortment of hate mail from people 
who did not want to see Aaron break Ruth's nearly sacrosanct home run record.[45] 
The threats extended to those providing positive press coverage of Aaron. 
Lewis Grizzard, then sports editor of the Atlanta Journal, reported receiving 
numerous phone calls calling journalists "nigger lovers" for covering Aaron's 
chase. While preparing the massive coverage of the home run record, he 
quietly had an obituary written, afraid that Aaron might be murdered.[46] 
Sports Illustrated pointedly summarized the racist vitriol that Aaron was 
forced to endure: "Is this to be the year in which Aaron, at the age of 
thirty-nine, takes a moon walk above one of the most hallowed individual 
records in American sport...? Or will it be remembered as the season in 
which Aaron, the most dignified of athletes, was besieged with hate mail 
and trapped by the cobwebs and goblins that lurk in baseball's attic?"[47] 
At the end of the 1973 season, Aaron received a plaque from the US Postal 
Service for receiving more mail (930,000 pieces) than any person excluding 
politicians.[18] Aaron received an outpouring of public support in response 
to the bigotry. Newspaper cartoonist Charles Schulz created a series of 
Peanuts strips printed in August 1973 in which Snoopy attempts to break 
the Ruth record, only to be besieged with hate mail. Lucy says in the August 
11 strip, "Hank Aaron is a great player...but you! If you break Babe Ruth's 
record, it'll be a disgrace!" Coincidentally, Snoopy was only one home 
run short of tying the record (and finished the season as such when Charlie 
Brown got picked off during Snoopy's last at-bat), and as it turned out, 
Aaron finished the 1973 season one home run short of Ruth.[48] Babe Ruth's 
widow, Claire Hodgson, even denounced the racism and declared that her 
husband would have enthusiastically cheered Aaron's attempt at the record.[49] 
As the 1974 season began, Aaron's pursuit of the record caused a small 
controversy. The Braves opened the season on the road in Cincinnati with 
a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds. Braves management wanted 
him to break the record in Atlanta, and were therefore going to have Aaron 
sit out the first three games of the season. But Baseball Commissioner 
Bowie Kuhn ruled that he had to play two games in the first series. He 
played two out of three, tying Babe Ruth's record in his very first at 
bat—on his first swing of the season—off Reds pitcher Jack Billingham, 
but did not hit another home run in the series.[50] The Braves returned 
to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, a crowd of 53,775 people showed up for 
the game—a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally 
on NBC. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off Los Angeles 
Dodgers pitcher Al Downing.[6] Although Dodgers outfielder Bill Buckner 
nearly went over the outfield wall trying to catch it, the ball landed 
in the Braves' bullpen, where relief pitcher Tom House caught it. While 
cannons were fired in celebration, two college students [51] sprinted onto 
the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the 
bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful Craig Sager actually 
interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT 
(now WWSB-Channel 40) in Sarasota.[52] As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's 
parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer Milo Hamilton, calling 
the game on WSB radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: "Henry 
Aaron, in the second inning walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's 
the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. 
That ball is gonna be-eee... Outta here! It's gone! It's 715! There's a 
new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron! The fireworks 
are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home 
plate. And listen to this crowd!"[53] Meanwhile, Dodgers broadcaster Vin 
Scully addressed the racial tension — or apparent lack thereof — in his 
call of the home run: "What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous 
moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for 
the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in 
the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And 
it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron. ...And 
for the first time in a long time, that poker face in Aaron shows the tremendous 
strain and relief of what it must have been like to live with for the past 
several months."[54] On October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd and final 
home run as a Braves player.[55] Thirty days later, after Aaron decided 
not to retire, the Braves traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers for Roger 
Alexander and Dave May. The trade re-united Aaron with former teammate 
Del Crandall, who was now managing the Brewers. On May 1, 1975, Aaron broke 
baseball's all-time RBI record, previously held by Ruth with 2,213. That 
year, he also played in his last and 24th All-Star Game (25th All-Star 
Game selection[56]); he lined out to Dave Concepción as a pinch-hitter 
in the second inning. This All-Star Game, like the first one he played 
in 1955, was before a home crowd at Milwaukee County Stadium. Aaron hit 
his 755th and final home run on July 20, 1976, at Milwaukee County Stadium 
off Dick Drago of the California Angels, which stood as the MLB career 
home run record until it was broken in 2007 by Barry Bonds. Over the course 
of his record-breaking 23-year career, Aaron had a batting average of .305 
with 163 hits a season, while hitting an average of just over 32 home runs 
a year and knocking home 99 runs batted in (RBIs) a year. He had 100+ RBIs 
in a season 15 times, including a record 13 in a row.[38] After the 1976 
season, Aaron rejoined the Braves as an executive.[15] On August 1, 1982, 
he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, having received votes on 
97.8 percent of the ballots, second only to Ty Cobb, who had received votes 
on 98.2% of the ballot in the inaugural 1936 Hall of Fame election.[57] 
Aaron was then named the Braves' vice president and director of player 
development. This made him one of the first minorities in Major League 
Baseball upper-level management.[24] Since December 1980, he has served 
as senior vice president and assistant to the Braves' president.[24] He 
is the corporate vice president of community relations for TBS, a member 
of the company's board of directors and the vice president of business 
development for The Airport Network.[24] On January 21, 2007, Major League 
Baseball announced the sale of the Atlanta Braves. In that announcement, 
Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig also announced that Aaron would be playing 
a major role in the management of Braves, forming programs through major 
league baseball that will encourage the influx of minorities into baseball.[58] 
Hank founded the Hank Aaron Rookie League program.[59] His autobiography, 
I Had a Hammer was published in 1990. The book's title is a play on his 
nickname, "The Hammer" or "Hammerin' Hank", and the title of the folk song 
"If I Had a Hammer". Aaron now owns Hank Aaron BMW of south Atlanta in 
Union City, Georgia, where he gives an autographed baseball with every 
car sold.[60] Aaron also owns Mini, Land Rover, Toyota, Hyundai and Honda 
dealerships throughout Georgia, as part of the Hank Aaron Automotive Group. 
Aaron sold all but the Toyota dealership in McDonough in 2007. During the 
2006 season, San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds passed Babe Ruth 
and moved into second place on the all-time home run list, attracting growing 
media coverage as he drew closer to Aaron's record. Playing off the intense 
interest in their perceived rivalry, Aaron and Bonds made a television 
commercial that aired during Super Bowl XLI, shortly before the start of 
the 2007 baseball season, in which Aaron jokingly tried to persuade Bonds 
to retire before breaking the record.[61] As Bonds began to close in on 
the record during the 2007 season, Aaron let it be known that, although 
he recognized Bonds' achievements, he would not be present when Bonds broke 
the record.[62] There was considerable speculation that this was a snubbing 
of Bonds based on the widespread belief that Bonds had used performance-enhancing 
drugs and steroids to aid his achievement. However, some observers looked 
back on Aaron's personal history, pointing out that he had downplayed his 
own breaking of Babe Ruth's all-time record and suggesting that Aaron was 
simply treating Bonds in a similar fashion. In a later interview with Atlanta 
sportscasting personality Chris Dimino, Aaron made it clear that his reluctance 
to attend any celebration of a new home run record was based upon his personal 
conviction that baseball is not about breaking records, but simply playing 
to the best of one's potential.[62] After Bonds hit his record-breaking 
756th home run on August 7, 2007, Aaron made a surprise appearance on the 
JumboTron video screen at AT&T Park in San Francisco to congratulate Bonds 
on his accomplishment: I would like to offer my congratulations to Barry 
Bonds on becoming baseball's career home run leader. It is a great accomplishment 
which required skill, longevity, and determination. Throughout the past 
century, the home run has held a special place in baseball and I have been 
privileged to hold this record for 33 of those years. I move over now and 
offer my best wishes to Barry and his family on this historical achievement. 
My hope today, as it was on that April evening in 1974, is that the achievement 
of this record will inspire others to chase their own dreams. Aaron lives 
in the Atlanta area.[63] In July 2013, media reported that his home was 
burglarized. Jewelry and two BMW vehicles were stolen. The cars were later 
recovered.[63] Aaron was awarded the Spingarn Medal in 1976, from the NAACP.[64] 
In 1982, Aaron was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during his first 
year of eligibility. In 1988 Aaron was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic 
Hall of Fame for his time spent on the Milwaukee Braves.[65] In 1999, MLB 
created the Hank Aaron Award, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Aaron's 
surpassing of Babe Ruth's career home run mark of 714 home runs and to 
honor Aaron's contributions to baseball. The award is given annually to 
the baseball hitters voted the most effective in each respective league. 
That same year, baseball fans named Aaron to the Major League Baseball 
All-Century Team. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Hank Aaron 
on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. When the city of Atlanta 
was converting the 1996 Olympic Stadium into a new baseball stadium, many 
local residents hoped the stadium would be named for Hank Aaron. When the 
stadium was instead named Turner Field (after Atlanta Braves owner Ted 
Turner), a section of Capitol Avenue running past the stadium was renamed 
Hank Aaron Drive. The stadium's street number is 755, after Aaron's total 
number of home runs. In April 1997, a new baseball facility for the AA 
Mobile Bay Bears constructed in Aaron's hometown of Mobile, Alabama was 
named Hank Aaron Stadium.[66] On February 5, 1999, at his 65th birthday 
celebration, Major League Baseball announced the introduction of the Hank 
Aaron Award.[67] The award honors the best overall offensive performer 
in the American and National League. It was the first major award to be 
introduced in more than thirty years and had the distinction of being the 
first award named after a player who was still alive.[68] Later that year, 
he ranked fifth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball 
Players,[69] and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[70] 
In July 2000 and again in July 2002, Aaron threw out the ceremonial first 
pitch at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Turner Field 
and Miller Park, respectively.[71] On January 8, 2001, Hank Aaron was presented 
with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton.[72] He 
received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian 
honor, from President George W. Bush in June 2002.[73] In 2001, a recreational 
trail in Milwaukee connecting Miller Park with Lake Michigan along the 
Menomonee River was dedicated as the "Hank Aaron State Trail". Hank Aaron 
was on hand for the dedication. Aaron is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson
