Gold, black           The original Buffalo Bisons baseball club played 
in the National League between 1879 and 1885. The Bisons played their games 
at Riverside Park (1879–83) and Olympic Park (1884-85) in Buffalo, New 
York. The NL Bisons are included in the history of the minor-league team 
of the same name that still plays today; it is thus the only extant NL 
team from the 19th century that both still exists and no longer plays in 
Major League Baseball. Brouthers, Galvin, O'Rourke, Radbourn, and White
