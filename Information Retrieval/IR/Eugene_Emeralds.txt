The Eugene Emeralds (nicknamed the Ems) are a minor league baseball team 
in Eugene, Oregon, United States. They are a short-season Class A team 
in the Northwest League, and are currently the Class A short-season affiliate 
of the Chicago Cubs.[1] From 2001 through 2014, the team was affiliated 
with the San Diego Padres. Originally created 61 years ago in 1955 as a 
charter member of the Northwest League, the Emeralds won the inaugural 
pennant as an independent,[2][3][4] and remained in the NWL for 14 seasons, 
through 1968. They played in northwest Eugene in 4,000-seat Bethel Park 
at Roosevelt Boulevard and Maple Street (44°03′52″N 123°08′43″W﻿ / ﻿44.0644°N 
123.1454°W﻿ / 44.0644; -123.1454), later torn down for the construction 
of a highway that wasn't built.[4][5][6] In 1950 and 1951, Bethel Park 
was the home of the Eugene Larks of the Class D Far West League; its outfield 
is present-day Lark Park. Its final game in 1968 on August 29 drew 897 
fans for a one-hitter and a 7-0 Emeralds win.[7] The NWL changed to a short 
season league in 1966, and that season opened in Eugene against the Lewiston 
Broncs. The second pick in the 1966 MLB draft, future hall of famer Reggie 
Jackson played his first professional games at Bethel Park, as a 20-year-old 
center fielder, following his sophomore season at Arizona State. Hitless 
in the opener,[8][9] the next game he got his first pro hit, a single in 
the first, and later a home run to right field in the ninth.[10][11] In 
the 1969 season, the Emeralds were promoted to AAA status in the Pacific 
Coast League (PCL) as the primary affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
The Ems returned to the Northwest League five years later, when the Phillies 
moved their AAA farm team to the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League 
for the 1974 season. Eugene was independent that season, then became an 
affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds in 1975. As a Triple A team in 1969, the 
Emeralds moved from Bethel Park to Civic Stadium. The 6,800-seat facility 
was owned by the Eugene School District and was built in 1938 as a venue 
for high school football, which was played there until 1968. Civic Stadium 
also hosted semi-pro baseball teams, sponsored by local timber companies, 
until Bethel Park was built in 1950. Facing an outdated stadium and high-maintenance 
costs,[12] the Eugene Emeralds moved into the new baseball stadium across 
town that was built by the University of Oregon, PK Park. A vacant Civic 
Stadium was destroyed by fire in 2015,[13] several years after the Emeralds 
had been playing at PK Park. The Emeralds new home, PK Park, is adjacent 
to Autzen Stadium and near the Willamette River. They share the new facility 
with the Oregon Ducks, whose regular season ends in May. A new logo, based 
upon Sasquatch, was adopted by the Emeralds in 2012.[14] In 2013, the Emeralds 
partnered with Voodoo Doughnut to offer a bacon maple bratwurst as a specialty 
food item.[15] Following the 2014 season, the Emeralds switched from being 
an affiliate of the San Diego Padres to the Chicago Cubs, who signed Eugene 
to a two-year deal through 2016.[16] The player development contract was 
extended through the 2018 season on June 14, 2016. With year player was
