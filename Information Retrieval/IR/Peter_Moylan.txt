Peter Michael Moylan (born 2 December 1978) is an Australian professional 
baseball relief pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers and Kansas City 
Royals. Moylan features a mid ninety mile per hour fastball and throws 
sidearm. Moylan began his professional career in the Minnesota Twins system. 
He was released in 1998 and returned to Australia, taking a job as a pharmaceutical 
salesman.[1] Moylan eventually improved his pitching and began working 
on a comeback. Moylan broke out while playing for the Australian team in 
the 2006 World Baseball Classic. He was selected for that tournament following 
his strong showing in the 2006 Claxton Shield. His 96 mph fastball enabled 
him to strike out established major-leaguers Bobby Abreu, Marco Scutaro, 
Ramón Hernández and Magglio Ordóñez. Based on his performance in this tournament, 
Moylan was invited to participate in spring training prior to the 2006 
season with the Atlanta Braves. Moylan was signed by the Atlanta Braves 
in 2006 and assigned to their Triple-A Richmond club. On 11 April 2006, 
Moylan was called up to the Braves to replace Joey Devine in the bullpen 
and he made his MLB debut the following day, pitching one scoreless inning 
against the Philadelphia Phillies; however he was later sent back to the 
Richmond club. He pitched in 15 total games during three separate call-ups 
in 2006, with a 4.80 ERA in 15 innings. At the end of spring training in 
2007, Moylan was again assigned to Richmond, but he was quickly called 
up on 14 April due to the injury of pitcher Chad Paronto. Moylan sealed 
a permanent spot on the roster as he proved invaluable to the Braves bullpen 
in 2007. Moylan earned his first major league win against the Florida Marlins 
in Miami on 24 April 2007. He earned his first major league save three 
days later against the Colorado Rockies in Denver. He finished the season 
5–3 with a 1.80 ERA. He led the majors in intentional walks allowed, with 
12.[2] In April 2008, The Braves placed Moylan on the 15-day disabled list 
with a sore right elbow. Medical examination showed the ulna collateral 
ligament in Moylan's right elbow was compromised by a bone spur. On 5 May, 
Moylan was transferred to the 60-day disabled list, and missed the remainder 
of the 2008 season recovering from Tommy John surgery. Moylan exceeded 
rehabilitation expectations and was declared fit to pitch during the Braves' 
2009 Spring Training camp in Orlando, Florida. Moylan worked with former 
Braves closer Gene Garber to work on his side-arm/submarine delivery.[3] 
He used the spring work to continue to gain arm strength, and began the 
season on the Braves active roster. After a few shaky appearances in April, 
Moylan began to find more consistency during May, settling into his role 
as the team's primary 7th inning specialist. Between the 80 appearances 
he made in 2007 and the 87 appearances in 2009, he became the first Braves 
pitcher to have two seasons with 80 or more games pitched. In addition 
he did not allow a home run in 2009, setting a Major League Baseball record 
for the most consecutive appearances to start a season without giving up 
a home run, eclipsing the record of 73 set by Brian Shouse with the Milwaukee 
Brewers in 2007.[4] Moylan appeared in 85 games for the Braves in 2010, 
finishing with a 6–2 record and a 2.97 ERA. In 2011, Moylan appeared in 
seven games before being placed on the disabled list in mid-April. He underwent 
successful back surgery on 17 May 2011, and was expected to miss at least 
two months.[5] Moylan returned to the Braves on 3 September 2011, but after 
six appearances, he was diagnosed with torn rotator cuff and labrum in 
his pitching shoulder. Although he was initially expected to miss most 
or possibly all of 2012,[6] it was later estimated that he would need six-month 
recovery period, allowing him to be ready for spring training in 2012.[7] 
While with the Braves, Moylan gained a reputation as a fan favorite through 
his embrace of Twitter and his sense of humor, even posting a link to a 
photo of himself in a dress stating he was wearing it to the ESPYs.[1] 
On 17 January 2012, the Braves re-signed Moylan to a minor-league deal 
worth approximately $1 million.[8] He only appeared in eight games with 
the Braves in 2012. On 16 January 2013, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed 
Moylan to a minor-league deal and he was assigned to the AAA Albuquerque 
Isotopes.[9] He was recalled to the Dodgers on 31 May. He appeared in 10 
games with the Dodgers and was then optioned back to AAA on 29 June. In 
38 games with the Isotopes, he was 4–1 with a 2.74 ERA. He returned to 
the Dodgers when rosters expanded on 1 September, where he appeared in 
four more games. Overall he was 1–0 with a 6.46 ERA in 14 games for the 
Dodgers. The Dodgers designated him for assignment on 22 October 2013.[10] 
He elected free agency on 29 October 2013. On 4 December 2013 Moylan signed 
a minor league contract with the Houston Astros.[11] He was released on 
26 March 2014.[12] On 5 March 2015 Moylan signed a 2-year minor league 
deal with the Braves that included a spring training invite for 2016.[13] 
The deal also made Moylan a player/coach in the Braves minor leagues in 
2015 as he rehabbed from his second Tommy John surgery.[14][15] On 16 August 
2015, Moylan's contract was selected by the Braves after posting a 3.14 
ERA and 6 saves in 27 games in AAA Gwinnett. On the same day, Moylan made 
his first major league appearance since 2013.[16] On 23 January 2016, the 
Kansas City Royals signed Moylan to a minor-league deal.[17] He was released
