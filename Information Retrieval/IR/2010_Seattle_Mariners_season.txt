The 2010 Seattle Mariners season was the 34th season in franchise history. 
The Mariners finished the season with 61 wins and 101 losses. Most of the 
2009 major league coaching staff was retained, with the exception of third 
base coach Bruce Hines.[1] Mike Brumley was named the new third base coach 
on October 30, 2009.[2] On December 7, the Mariners announced their minor 
league staff.[3] Eriberto Menchaca, who managed the Class-A Clinton LumberKings 
in 2009, was moved to the rookie-level Pulaski Mariners, Jesus Azuaje was 
named manager of the rookie-level Peoria Mariners, Tim Laker was named 
the manager of the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx, and Andy Fox was named 
hitting coach for the Diamond Jaxx.[3] On October 19, 2009, catcher Kenji 
Johjima, the first Japanese-born catcher in Major League Baseball, exercised 
an opt-out clause in his contract and returned to playing in Nippon Professional 
Baseball.[4] The Mariners also lost their home run leader, Russell Branyan, 
who declined a one-year deal with the Mariners to test the free agent market.[5] 
Two-time Gold Glove winner Adrián Beltré opted for free agency on November 
5, 2009, and later signed with the Boston Red Sox.[6] The third baseman 
declined $12 million in arbitration from the Mariners only days after the 
team signed Chone Figgins (see below).[7] Beltre officially parted ways 
with the Mariners when he signed a one-year, $9 million deal with the Boston 
Red Sox. Pitcher Phillippe Aumont, noted as one of the top prospects in 
the organization, was sent to the Phillies in the trade for Cliff Lee. 
Also, pitcher Brandon Morrow was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays as well.[8] 
Carlos Silva, whose time in Seattle was plagued by injury, was traded to 
the Chicago Cubs on December 18.[9] Chone Figgins signed a four-year contract 
valued at $36 million.[10] General manager Jack Zduriencik noted Figgins' 
versatility on defense and could ask him to play second base as well.[11] 
Ken Griffey, Jr. returned to the Mariners with a one-year deal after a 
successful 2009 season and large amount of Seattle fans asking for "one 
more year."[12] Shortstop Jack Wilson signed a two-year, $10 million deal 
to remain in Seattle. Wilson was one of the players received from the Pittsburgh 
Pirates at the trading deadline in 2009.[13] On December 14, 2009, the 
Mariners, along with the three other organizations including the Philadelphia 
Phillies, the Toronto Blue Jays, and the Oakland Athletics agreed to a 
4-team, 9-player deal. The Mariners received former Cy Young Award winner 
Cliff Lee from Philadelphia in exchange for three prospects as a complement 
to ace Félix Hernández.[14][15][16][17][18] On December 18, 2009, the Mariners 
traded pitcher Carlos Silva and cash considerations to the Chicago Cubs 
for outfielder Milton Bradley, particularly noting his offensive capabilities.[9] 
On December 22, the Mariners traded Brandon Morrow to the Toronto Blue 
Jays for pitcher Brandon League, and a minor league prospect.[8] The Mariners 
acquired first baseman Casey Kotchman from the Boston Red Sox in exchange 
for utility player Bill Hall, a player to be named later, and cash considerations. 
On January 29, 2010, the Mariner signed outfielder Eric Byrnes to a one-year, 
$400,000 contract after he was released by the Arizona Diamondbacks.[19] 
The Mariners signed first baseman Ryan Garko to a one-year $550,000 contract 
on February 1.[20] On February 6, the Mariners re-signed pitcher Érik Bédard 
to a one-year, $1.5 million contract, with a mutual option for 2011.[21] 
After the World Series, the Mariners cleared five spots from their 40-man 
roster after infielder Bryan LaHair, pitchers César Jiménez, Randy Messenger 
and Marwin Vega were outrighted to the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers, and pitcher 
Justin Thomas was claimed off waivers by the Pittsburgh Pirates.[22] The 
Mariners added seven new scouts after the season including the West Coast 
Supervisor Butch Baccala, Southern California scout John Ramey, Northwest 
scout Joe Ross, Midwest scout Tony Russo, Southwest scout Jess Kapellusch, 
Atlantic scout Mike Moriarty, and Gulf Coast scout Devitt Moore.[23] On 
November 25, the Mariners re-signed minor league pitchers Steve Bray and 
Steven Shell, and catcher José Yépez.[24] On December 9, the Mariners signed 
outfielder Corey Patterson to a minor league contract with an invitation 
to spring training.[25] It was reported by Baseball America that the Mariners 
signed pitcher Levale Speigner and infielder Travis Denker, and also re-signed 
pitcher Chris Seddon and Josh Wilson to minor league contracts on December 
12.[26] On December 16, the Mariners signed 19-year-old Brazilian prospect 
Pedro Okuda to a minor league contract.[27] During the trade for Cliff 
Lee, the Mariners gave up three prospects including pitchers Phillippe 
Aumont and J. C. Ramírez and outfielder Tyson Gillies.[28] On December

contract with an invitation to spring training.[31] On January 13, the 
Mariners re-signed first baseman Brad Nelson to a minor league contract 
with and invitation to spring training.[32] Formerly of the Milwaukee Brewers 
organization, Jesús Colomé signed a minor league contract with an invitation 
to spring training with the Mariners on February 10.[33] On February 12, 
2010, the Mariners signed Mike Sweeney, a player who MLB.com called a "key 
clubhouse component from the Mariners' dramatic 2009 turnaround", to a 
minor league contract with an invitation to spring training.[34] During 
the offseason, MLB.com ranked Mariners' first round draft Dustin Ackley 
as the 15th best prospect in Minor League Baseball.[36] Ackley was also

followed by outfielder Michael Saunders, catcher Adam Moore, third baseman 
Alex Liddi, infielder Carlos Triunfel, pitcher Michael Pineda, shortstop 
Nick Franklin, outfielder Greg Halman, pitcher Dan Cortes, and corner infielder 
Mario Martínez.[35] Baseball America also ranked players by their specific

On February 8, newly acquired pitcher Cliff Lee underwent minor surgery 
to remove a floating bone spur in his left foot.[42] Lee was expected to 
be out two-to-three weeks, making him unable to report to spring training 
at the scheduled time.[42] On March 4, closer David Aardsma experienced 
tightness in his groin causing him to miss playing time.[43] Shortstop 
Jack Wilson suffered from right hamstring tightness after a Mariners' game

strain.[45] At the end of spring training, Lee was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list for the aforementioned reason.[46] On April 3, Mariners' 
minor leaguer James McOwen dislocated his shoulder while attempting to 
catch a ball hit by Clint Barmes.[47] On March 10, 2010, the Mariners cut 
10 people from their spring roster including Ryan Feierabend, Josh Fields,
