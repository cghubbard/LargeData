The European Cup is an annual baseball tournament, sanctioned and created 
by the Confederation of European Baseball (CEB). The tournament features 
the top teams of the professional baseball leagues in Europe.[1] Starting 
in 2008, the tournament is now held in two locations. The best two teams 
from each tournament then compete in the European Champion Cup "Final Four", 
with the winner receiving the European Champion Cup. Between 2013 and 2015, 
the "Final Four" format was replaced with a best-of-three series between 
the winners of each tournament. In the 2015 tournament, six teams competed 
in the Paris group, while six other teams competed in Rotterdam. The best 
two teams then competed in the "Final Four" in Italy, in a best-of-three 
series, for the championship. From 2016, a new format has been introduced 
with an 8 team knockout tournament and two new tournaments for lower level 
teams, the CEB Cup and the Federations Cup. The first season of the tournament 
was held in 1963 and was won by the Picadero Jockey Club Barcelona. Rimini
