               Indy Fuel (ECHL) The Chicago Blackhawks (spelled Black Hawks 
until 1986, and known colloquially as the Hawks) are a professional ice 
hockey team based in Chicago, Illinois. They are members of the Central 
Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). 
They have won six Stanley Cup championships since their founding in 1926. 
The Blackhawks are one of the "Original Six" NHL teams along with the Detroit 
Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins and New 
York Rangers. Since 1994, the club's home rink is the United Center. The 
club had previously played for 65 years at Chicago Stadium.[2] The club's 
original owner was Frederic McLaughlin, who owned the club until his death 
in 1944. Under McLaughlin, a "hands-on" owner who fired many coaches during 
his ownership, the club won two Stanley Cup titles. The club was then owned 
by the Norris family, who as owners of the Chicago Stadium were the club's 
landlord, and owned stakes in several of the NHL teams. At first, the Norris 
ownership was as part of a syndicate fronted by long-time executive Bill 
Tobin, and the team languished in favor of the Norris-owned Detroit Red 
Wings. After the senior James E. Norris died in 1952, the Norris assets 
were spread among family members and James D. Norris became owner. Norris 
Jr. took an active interest in the team and under his ownership, the club 
won one Stanley Cup title in 1961. After James D. Norris died in 1966, 
the Wirtz family became owners of the franchise. In 2007, the club came 
under the control of Rocky Wirtz, who is credited with turning around the 
organization, which had lost fan interest and competitiveness. Under Rocky 
Wirtz, the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup three times within six seasons 
(from 2010 to 2015). On May 1, 1926, the NHL awarded an expansion franchise 
for Chicago to a syndicate headed by former football star Huntington Hardwick 
of Boston. At the same meeting, Hardwick arranged the purchase of the players 
of the Portland Rosebuds of the Western Hockey League for $100,000 from 
WHL President Frank Patrick in a deal brokered by Boston Bruins' owner 
Charles Adams.[3] However, only one month later, Hardwick's group sold 
out to Chicago coffee tycoon Frederic McLaughlin.[4] McLaughlin had been 
a commander with the 333rd Machine Gun Battalion of the 86th Infantry Division 
during World War I.[5] This Division was nicknamed the "Blackhawk Division" 
after a Native American of the Sauk nation, Black Hawk, who was a prominent 
figure in the history of Illinois.[5] McLaughlin named the new hockey team 
in honor of the military unit, making it one of many sports team names 
using Native Americans as icons. However, unlike the military division, 
the team's name was spelled in two words as the "Black Hawks" until 1986, 
when the club officially became the "Blackhawks," based on the spelling 
found in the original franchise documents.[6] The Black Hawks began play 
in the 1926–27 season, along with new expansion franchises Detroit Cougars 
and New York Rangers. McLaughlin took a very active role in running the 
team despite having no background in the sport. McLaughlin hired Bill Tobin, 
a former goaltender who had played in the Western league, as his assistant, 
but directed the team himself. He was also very interested in promoting 
American hockey players, then very rare in professional hockey. Several 
of them, including Doc Romnes, Taffy Abel, Alex Levinsky, Mike Karakas 
and Cully Dahlstrom, become staples with the club, and under McLaughlin, 
the Black Hawks were the first NHL team with an all-American-born lineup.[5] 
The Hawks' first season was a moderate success. They played their first 
game on November 17 when they played the Toronto St. Patricks in the Chicago 
Coliseum. The Black Hawks won their first game 4–1, in front of a crowd 
of over 7,000.[4] They ended up finishing the season in third place with 
a record of 19–22–3. The Black Hawks lost the 1927 first-round playoff 
series to the Boston Bruins. Following the series, McLaughlin fired Head 
Coach Pete Muldoon. According to Jim Coleman, sportswriter for the Toronto-based 
Globe and Mail, McLaughlin felt the 'Hawks were good enough to finish first. 
Muldoon disagreed, and in a fit of pique, McLaughlin fired him. According 
to Coleman, Muldoon responded by yelling, "Fire me, Major, and you'll never 
finish first. I'll put a curse on this team that will hoodoo it until the 
end of time." The Curse of Muldoon was born – although Coleman admitted 
years after the fact that he had fabricated the whole incident[7] – and 
became one of the first widely known sports "curses." While the team would 
go on to win three Stanley Cups in its first 39 years of existence, it 
did so without ever having finished in first place, either in a single- 
or multi-division format. The Black Hawks proceeded to have the worst record 
in the League in 1927–28, winning only seven of 44 games. For the 1928–29 
season, the Black Hawks were originally slated to play in the new Chicago 
Stadium, but due to construction delays and a dispute between McLaughlin 
and Chicago Stadium promoter Paddy Harmon, the Black Hawks instead divided 
their time between the Coliseum, the Detroit Olympia and the Peace Bridge 
Arena in Fort Erie, Ontario. They moved to Chicago Stadium the following 
season. By 1931, they reached their first Stanley Cup Final, with goal-scorer 
Johnny Gottselig, Cy Wentworth on defense, and Charlie Gardiner in goal, 
but fizzled in the final two games against the Montreal Canadiens. Chicago 
had another stellar season in 1932, but that did not translate into playoff 
success. However, two years later, Gardiner led his team to victory by 
shutting out the Detroit Red Wings in the final game of the Stanley Cup 
Finals. The score after double overtime was 1–0. In 1938, the Black Hawks 
had a record of 14–25–9, and almost missed the playoffs. They stunned the 
Canadiens and New York Americans on overtime goals in the deciding games 
of both semi-final series, advancing to the Cup Final against the Toronto 
Maple Leafs. Black Hawks goalie Mike Karakas was injured and could not 
play, forcing a desperate Chicago team to pull minor-leaguer (Pittsburgh 
Hornets) Alfie Moore out of a Toronto bar and onto the ice. Moore played 
one game and won it. Toronto refused to let Moore play the next, and Chicago 
used Paul Goodman in game two and lost the game. However, for games three 
and four, Karakas was fitted with a special skate to protect his injured 
toe, and the team won both games. It was too late for Toronto, as the Hawks 
won their second championship. As of 2014[update], the 1938 Black Hawks 
possess the poorest regular-season record of any Stanley Cup champion. 
The Black Hawks returned to the Finals in 1944 behind Doug Bentley's 38-goal 
season with linemate Clint Smith leading the team in assists. After upsetting 
the Red Wings in the semi-finals, they were promptly dispatched by the 
dominant Canadiens in four games. Owner and founder Frederic McLaughlin 
died in December 1944. His estate sold the team to a syndicate headed by 
longtime team president Bill Tobin. However, Tobin was only a puppet for 
James E. Norris, who owned the rival Red Wings. Norris had also been the 
Black Hawks' landlord since his 1936 purchase of Chicago Stadium. For the 
next eight years, the Norris-Tobin ownership, as a rule, paid almost no 
attention to the Black Hawks. Nearly every trade made between Detroit and 
Chicago ended up being Red Wing heists. As a result, for the next several 
years, Chicago was the model of futility in the NHL. Between 1945 and 1958, 
they only made the playoffs twice. Upon Norris' death, his eldest son, 
James D. Norris, and Red Wings minority owner Arthur Wirtz (the senior 
Norris' original partner in buying the Red Wings 23 years earlier) took 
over the floundering club. They guided it through financial reverses, and 
rebuilt the team from there. One of their first moves was to hire former 
Detroit coach and General Manager Tommy Ivan as general manager. In the 
late 1950s, the Hawks struck gold, picking up three young prospects (forwards 
Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita and defenseman Pierre Pilote), as well as obtaining 
both star goaltender Glenn Hall and veteran forward Ted Lindsay (who had 
just had a career season with 30 goals and 55 assists) from Detroit. Hull, 
Mikita, Pilote and Hall became preeminent stars in Chicago, and all four 
would eventually be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. After two first-round 
exits at the hands of the eventual champions from Montreal in 1959 and 
1960, it was expected that the Canadiens would once again beat the Hawks 
when they met in the semifinals in 1961. A defensive plan that completely 
wore down Montreal's superstars worked, however, as Chicago won the series 
in six games. They then bested the Wings to win their third Stanley Cup 
championship. The Hawks made the Cup Finals twice more in the 1960s, losing 
to the Leafs in 1962 and the Canadiens in 1965. They remained a force to 
be reckoned with throughout the decade, with Hull enjoying four 50-goal 
seasons, Mikita winning back-to-back scoring titles and MVP accolades, 
Pilote winning three consecutive Norris Trophies, and Hall being named 
the First or Second All-Star goaltender eight out of nine seasons. Hull 
and Mikita especially were widely regarded as the most feared one-two punch 
in the league. However, despite a strong supporting cast which included 
Bill Hay, Ken Wharram, Phil Esposito, Moose Vasko, Doug Mohns and Pat Stapleton, 
the Hawks never quite put it all together. In 1966–67, the last season 
of the six-team NHL, the Black Hawks finished first, breaking the supposed 
Curse of Muldoon, 23 years after the death of Frederic McLaughlin. However, 
they lost in the semifinals to Toronto, who went on to win their last Stanley 
Cup to date. Afterward, Coleman, who first printed the story of the curse 
in 1943, admitted that he made the story up to break a writer's block he 
had as a column deadline approached. James D. Norris died in 1966. One 
of his last moves in the NHL was to arrange an expansion franchise in St. 
Louis, where he owned the St. Louis Arena. Tobin died in 1963, a club vice-president 
until his death. The ownership of the Black Hawks now came under the control 
of Arthur Wirtz and his son Bill Wirtz. Hall was drafted by the expansion 
St. Louis Blues for the 1967–68 season, while Pilote was traded to the 
Maple Leafs for Jim Pappin in 1968. In the 1968–69 season, despite Hull 
breaking his own previous record of 54 goals in a season with 58, the Black 
Hawks missed the playoffs for the first time since 1958—and the last time 
before 1997–98. In 1967, the Black Hawks made a trade with the Boston Bruins 
that turned out to be one of the most one-sided in the history of the sport. 
Chicago sent young forwards Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield 
to Boston in exchange for Pit Martin, Jack Norris and Gilles Marotte. While 
Martin would star for the Hawks for many seasons, Esposito, Hodge, and 
Stanfield would lead the Bruins to the top of the league for several years 
and capture two Stanley Cups. In Boston, Phil Esposito set numerous scoring 
records en route to a career as one of the NHL's all-time greats. Nonetheless, 
in 1970–71 NHL season, life was made easier for Chicago, as in an attempt 
to better balance the divisions, the expansion Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver 
Canucks were both placed in the East Division, while the Hawks moved into 
the West Division. They became the class of the West overnight, rampaging 
to a 46–17–15 record and an easy first-place finish. With second-year goalie 
Tony Esposito (Phil's younger brother and winner of the Calder Memorial 
Trophy for Rookie of the Year the previous season), Hull, his younger brother 
Dennis, Mikita, and sterling defensemen Stapleton, Keith Magnuson and Bill 
White, the Hawks reached the Stanley Cup final before bowing out to the 
Canadiens. A critical blow to the franchise came in 1972–73, though, with 
the start of the World Hockey Association. Long dissatisfied with how little 
he was paid as the league's marquee star, Bobby Hull jumped to the upstart 
Winnipeg Jets for a million-dollar contract. Former Philadelphia Flyers 
star Andre Lacroix, who received very little ice time in his single season 
in Chicago, joined Hull, and the pair became two of the WHA's great stars. 
The Hawks repeated their appearance in Cup Final that year, however, again 
losing to Montreal. Stapleton left for the WHA too after that year, depleting 
the team further. While the team led or was second in the West Division 
for four straight seasons, for the rest of the 1970s, the Black Hawks made 
the playoffs each year—winning seven division championships in the decade 
in all—but were never a successful Stanley Cup contender, losing 16 straight 
playoff games at one point. The team acquired legendary blueliner Bobby 
Orr from the Boston Bruins in 1976, but ill health forced him to sit out 
for most of the season, and he eventually retired in 1979, having played 
only 26 games for the Hawks. Mikita did the same the following year after 
playing 22 years in Chicago, the third-longest career for a single team 
in league history. By 1982, the Black Hawks squeaked into the playoffs 
as the fourth seed in the Norris Division (at the time the top four teams 
in each division automatically made the playoffs), and were one of the 
league's Cinderella teams that year. Led by second-year Denis Savard's 
32 goals and 119 points and Doug Wilson's 39 goals, the Hawks stunned the 
Minnesota North Stars and Blues in the playoffs before losing to another 
surprise team, the Vancouver Canucks, who made the Stanley Cup Finals. 
Chicago proved they were no fluke the next season, also making the third 
round before losing to the eventual runner-up Edmonton Oilers. After an 
off-year in 1984, the Hawks again faced a now fresh-off-a-ring Edmonton 
offensive juggernaut of a team and lost in the third round in 1985. In 
1983, Arthur Wirtz died and the club came under the sole control of Bill 
Wirtz. Although the Black Hawks continued to make the playoffs each season, 
the club began a slow decline, punctuated with an appearance in the 1992 
Stanley Cup Finals. During the 1985 playoff series against Edmonton, the 
Black Hawks and their fans started a tradition of cheering during the singing 
of "The Star-Spangled Banner."[8] The cheering at the United Center has 
been known to reach up to 122 Decibels while during the anthem.[9] While 
this action is not without controversy, as some people consider it disrespectful, 
the tradition continues to the present day.[10] Many people have sung the 
"Star-Spangled Banner" for the Blackhawks since the tradition of cheering 
began, but the current full-time anthem singer is Jim Cornelison.[8] Moreover, 
prior to the 1986–87 season, while going through the team's records, someone 
discovered the team's original NHL contract, and found that the name "Blackhawks" 
was printed as a compound word as opposed to two separate words, "Black 
Hawks," which was the way most sources had been printing it for 60 years 
and as the team had always officially listed it. The name officially became 
"Chicago Blackhawks" from that point on. In the late 1980s, Chicago still 
made the playoffs on an annual basis, but made early-round exits each time. 
In 1988–89, after three-straight first-round defeats, and despite a fourth-place 
finish in their division in the regular season, Chicago made it to the 
Conference Final in the rookie seasons of both goalie Ed Belfour and center 
Jeremy Roenick. Once again, however, they would fail to make the Stanley 
Cup Final, losing to the eventual champions, the Calgary Flames. The following 
season, the Hawks did prove they were late-round playoff material, running 
away with the Norris Division title, but, yet again, the third round continued 
to stymie them, this time against the eventual champion Oilers, despite 
1970s Soviet star goaltender Vladislav Tretiak coming to Chicago to become 
the Blackhawks' goaltender coach. In 1990–91, Chicago was poised to fare 
even better in the playoffs, winning the Presidents' Trophy for best regular-season 
record, but the Minnesota North Stars stunned them in six games in the 
first-round en route to an improbable Stanley Cup Final appearance. In 
1991–92 the Blackhawks – with Roenick scoring 53 goals, Steve Larmer scoring 
29 goals, Chris Chelios (acquired from Montreal two years previously) on 
defense, and Belfour in goal – finally reached the Final after 19 years 
out of such status. The Blackhawks won 11 consecutive playoff games that 
year, which set an NHL record. However, they were swept four games to none 
by the Mario Lemieux-led defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins 
(who, in sweeping the Blackhawks, tied the record Chicago had set only 
days before). Although the 4–0 sweep indicates Pittsburgh's dominance in 
won games, it was actually a close series that could have gone either way. 
Game 1 saw the Blackhawks squander leads of 3–0 and 4–1, and would eventually 
be beaten 5–4 after a Lemieux power-play goal with 9 seconds remaining 
in regulation. The Blackhawks most lackluster game was game two, losing 
3–1. A frustrating loss of 1–0 followed in game three, and a natural hat 
trick from Dirk Graham and stellar play from Dominik Hasek (who showed 
indications of the goaltender he would later become) could not secure a 
win in game four, which ended in 6–5 final in favor of Pittsburgh. The 
defending NBA champion Chicago Bulls were in their finals in 1992, but 
won their championship in six, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers. Although 
this was the only year the city of Chicago would host a concurrent NBA/NHL 
finals in the same year, Blackhawks head coach Mike Keenan would see this 
again in New York when he coached the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup 
in 54 years two years later. Belfour posted a 40-win season in 1992–93 
as the Hawks looked to go deep yet again, and Chelios accumulated career-high 
penalty time with 282 minutes in the box, but St. Louis stunned Chicago 
with a first-round sweep to continue Chicago's playoff losing streak. Although 
they finished near-.500 season in 1994, the Blackhawks again qualified 
for the playoffs. They were eliminated by eventual Western Conference finalist 
Toronto, but broke their playoff losing streak at 10 games with a game 
three win. It wasn't enough, however, and the Blackhawks fell in six games. 
The 1993–94 season also marked the Blackhawks' last at the old Chicago 
Stadium, and the team moved into the new United Center in the lockout-shortened 
1995 season. Bernie Nicholls and Joe Murphy both scored 20 goals over 48 
games, and Chicago once again made it to the Western Conference Final, 
losing to the rival Detroit Red Wings. Also in 1994, management fired Wayne 
Messmer, popular singer of "The Star-Spangled Banner." Roenick, Belfour 
and Chelios were all traded away as the Blackhawks faltered through the 
late 1990s until they missed the playoffs by five points in 1998 for the 
first time in 29 years, one season short of tying the Boston Bruins' record 
for the longest such streak in North American professional sports history. 
Chicago would also miss the playoffs for a second consecutive season in 
1999, and would later miss the playoffs in 2000 and 2001. The millennium 
started with disappointment for the Blackhawks. Éric Daze, Alexei Zhamnov 
and Tony Amonte emerged as some of the team's leading stars by this time. 
However, aside from a quick first-round exit in 2002 (where they lost to 
the Blues in five games after winning Game 1 of the series), the 'Hawks 
were consistently out of the playoffs from the 1997–98 season until the 
2008–09 season, in most years finishing well out of contention, despite 
finishing in third place in the Central Division six times. Amonte left 
for the Phoenix Coyotes in the summer of 2002. During the 2002–03 season, 
the Blackhawks finished third in the Central Division with 79 points, but 
would finish ninth in the Western Conference, which would make them miss 
the playoffs by 13 points. A somber note was struck in February 2004 when 
ESPN named the Blackhawks the worst franchise in professional sports.[11] 
Indeed, the Blackhawks were viewed with much indifference by Chicagoans 
for much of the 1990s and early 2000s due to anger over several policies 
instituted by then-owner Bill Wirtz (derisively known as "Dollar Bill"). 
For example, Wirtz did not allow home games to be televised in the Chicago 
area, claiming it was unfair to the team's season ticket holders. He also 
raised ticket prices to an average of $50, among the most expensive in 
the NHL. Many hockey fans in Chicago began supporting the American Hockey 
League (AHL)'s Chicago Wolves. For a time, the Wolves took a jab at the 
Hawks with the slogan, "We Play Hockey The Old-Fashioned Way: We Actually 
Win." The club, under Wirtz, was then subject of a highly critical book, 
Career Misconduct, sold outside games until Wirtz had its author and publisher 
arrested. In the 2003–04 season, the Blackhawks would finish last in the 
Western Conference, winning only 20 games. Following the lockout of the 
2004–05 season, new GM Dale Tallon set about restructuring the team in 
the hopes of making a playoff run. Tallon made several moves in the summer 
of 2005, most notably the signing of Tampa Bay Lightning Stanley Cup-winning 
goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin and All-Star defenseman Adrian Aucoin. However, 
injuries plagued Khabibulin and Aucoin, among others, and the Blackhawks 
again finished well out of the playoffs with a 26–43–13 record – next-to-last 
in the Western Conference and the second-worst in the NHL. The Blackhawks 
reached another low point on May 16, 2006, when they announced that popular 
TV/radio play-by-play announcer Pat Foley was not going to be brought back 
after 25 years with the team, a move unpopular amongst most Blackhawks 
fans. Foley then became the television/radio voice of the Chicago Wolves. 
With the third overall pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, the team selected 
Jonathan Toews, who led the University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux hockey 
team to the 2006 NCAA Frozen Four. The Blackhawks were eager to make a 
splash in the free-agent market, and offered big money to many of the top 
free agents. They were, however, denied, only being able to acquire two 
backup goaltenders in Patrick Lalime and Sebastien Caron. Chicago was one 
of the biggest buyers in the trade market, though, acquiring a future franchise 
player in left-winger Martin Havlat, as well as center Bryan Smolinski 
from the Ottawa Senators in a three-way deal that also involved the San 
Jose Sharks. The 'Hawks dealt forward Mark Bell to the Sharks, Michal Barinka 
and a 2008 second-round draft pick to the Senators, while Ottawa also received 
defenseman Tom Preissing and center Josh Hennessy from San Jose. Havlat 
gave the Blackhawks the talented, first-line caliber gamebreaker they so 
desperately needed. The Havlat trade was soon followed by another major 
trade — winger and key Blackhawk player Kyle Calder was traded to the Philadelphia 
Flyers in exchange for grinding defensive center Michal Handzus. The move 
caused a stir in Chicago; Calder had won an increase in his contract through 
arbitration, which was accepted by the Hawks, but rather than ink their 
leading scorer, the Blackhawks decided to address their need for a proven 
center by acquiring Handzus. Injuries to both Havlat and Handzus hurt the 
Blackhawks, and Smolinski was eventually traded at the trade deadline to 
the Vancouver Canucks. On November 26, 2006, Blackhawks General Manager 
Dale Tallon fired Head Coach Trent Yawney and appointed Assistant Coach 
Denis Savard as the head coach. Savard had been the assistant coach of 
the Blackhawks since 1997, the year after he retired as one of the most 
popular and successful Blackhawks players of all time. The Blackhawks continued 
to struggle, and finished last in the Central Division, 12 points out of 
the playoffs. They finished with the fourth worst record in the NHL, and 
in the Draft Lottery, won the opportunity to select first overall in the 
draft, whereas the team had never had a draft pick higher than third overall. 
They used the pick to draft right wing Patrick Kane from the London Knights 
of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). On September 26, 2007, Bill Wirtz, 
the longtime owner of the Blackhawks, died after a brief battle with cancer.[12] 
He was succeeded by his son, Rocky, who drastically altered his father's 
long-standing policies.[13] Midway into the 2007–08 NHL season, the franchise 
experimented with a partnership with Comcast SportsNet Chicago and WGN-TV 
by airing selected Blackhawks home games on television.[14] During the 
next season, Comcast and WGN began airing all of the team's regular season 
games.[14] Rocky also named John McDonough, formerly the president of the 
Chicago Cubs, as the franchise's new president.[15] Since taking over the 
position, McDonough has been an instrumental figure in the Blackhawks current 
marketing success, including establishing links between the Blackhawks 
and the Chicago White Sox fan base in a number of ways.[16] In April 2008 
the Blackhawks announced a partnership with the White Sox. As a result 
of this partnership the Blackhawks have a Zamboni race featuring Patrick 
Kane and Duncan Keith on the jumbotron at every White Sox home game. Wirtz 
was also able to bring back former Blackhawks greats Tony Esposito, Stan 
Mikita and Bobby Hull, as the franchise's "hockey ambassadors."[17] In 
addition to the changes in the team's policies and front office, the younger 
Wirtz also made a concerted effort to rebuild the team. According to a 
team source, he spent money to make money.[18] The Blackhawks roster was 
bolstered by the addition of Patrick Kane, the first overall selection 
in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, who led all rookies in points.[19] Kane and 
Jonathan Toews were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, which is 
awarded to the NHL's best rookie. Kane ultimately beat his teammate for 
the award.[20] Kane finished the 2007–08 season with 21 goals and 51 assists 
in 82 games. The Blackhawks finished with a record of 40–34–8, missing 
the playoffs by three points. The 2007–08 season marked the first time 
in six years that the team finished above .500.[21] The Blackhawks made 
several major roster changes before the 2008–09 NHL season. The team traded 
Tuomo Ruutu, their longest tenured player, to the Carolina Hurricanes for 
forward Andrew Ladd on February 26, 2008.[22] Later that day, the Blackhawks 
traded captain Martin Lapointe to the Ottawa Senators for a sixth-round 
draft pick in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.[22] On the first day of free agency, 
July 1, the team signed goaltender Cristobal Huet to a four-year US$22.5 
million contract, and later signed defenseman Brian Campbell to an eight-year, 
$56.8 million contract.[23] The team also added former coaches Joel Quenneville 
and Scotty Bowman to their organization.[24][25][26] On February 13, 2008, 
the Blackhawks announced they would hold their first fan convention. On 
July 16, 2008, the team announced that they would host the 2009 NHL Winter 
Classic on a temporary ice rink at Wrigley Field on New Years Day against 
fellow "Original Six" member Detroit Red Wings.[27] The Detroit Red Wings 
defeated Chicago, 6–4. On June 16, Pat Foley returned as the Blackhawks 
TV play-by-play man, replacing Dan Kelly. Foley called Blackhawk games 
from 1981 to 2006 and spent the next two years broadcasting for the Chicago 
Wolves. Foley was partnered with Eddie Olczyk to broadcast all of the Hawks 
games.[28][29] The Blackhawks relieved Denis Savard of his head coaching 
duties, and replaced him with Joel Quenneville on October 16, 2008.[30] 
Savard has since been brought back to the organization as an ambassador. 
Prior to the 2008–09 season opener, the Blackhawks named Toews, at 20 years 
and 79 days, as the new captain, succeeding the traded Lapointe and making 
him the third-youngest captain at the time of appointment. The Blackhawks 
finished the 2008–2009 regular season in second place in their division, 
with a record of 46–24–12, putting them in fourth place in the Western 
Conference with 104 points. The Blackhawks clinched a playoff berth for 
the first time since the 2001–02 season with a 3–1 win over Nashville on 
April 3. On April 8, with a shootout loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets, 
the Blackhawks clinched their first 100-point season in 17 years. The Blackhawks 
beat the fifth-seeded Calgary Flames in six games to advance to the Western 
Conference Semifinals for the first time since 1996.[31] The team proceeded 
to defeat the third-seeded Vancouver Canucks in six games.[32] The Blackhawks 
played the then Stanley Cup champions, the Detroit Red Wings, for the Western 
Conference Championship. They lost the series to the Red Wings in five 
games.[33] During the 2008–09 season, the team led the League in home attendance 
with a total of 912,155, averaging 22,247 fans per game.[34] This figure 
includes the 40,818 fans from the Winter Classic at Wrigley Field. Therefore, 
the total attendance for games hosted at the United Center is 871,337, 
good for an average of 21,783 which still leads the league over Montreal's 
21,273 average. The Blackhawks welcomed their one millionth fan of the 
season at the United Center before game six of the Western Conference semi-finals 
on May 11, 2009.[35] Prior to the 2009–10 NHL season, the Blackhawks made 
another major free agent purchase, signing Marian Hossa to a 12-year contract 
worth US$62.8 million.[36] The team also acquired Tomas Kopecky, John Madden, 
and Richard Petiot.[36][37] In early July, general manager Dale Tallon 
and the Blackhawks management came under fire when the National Hockey 
League Players' Association (NHLPA) claimed the team did not submit offers 
to their restricted free agents before the deadline.[38] In the worst-case 
scenario, the team's unsigned restricted free agents at the time, including 
Calder Memorial Trophy finalist Kris Versteeg, would have become unrestricted 
free agents.[38] Despite the ordeal, the Blackhawks were able to sign Versteeg 
and all of their restricted free agents before the NHLPA could take further 
actions.[38] On July 14, 2009, The Blackhawks demoted Tallon to the position 
of Senior Adviser. Stan Bowman, son of Scotty Bowman, was promoted to general 
manager.[39] The Blackhawks continued to sell out games, with the best 
average attendance of 21,356 over Montreal's 21,273 in the NHL, and had 
a total of 854,267 excluding the playoffs. The Blackhawks reached the one 
million mark in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals against the San 
Jose Sharks. The Blackhawks re-signed Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews to 
contract extensions worth $31.5 million over five years, and Duncan Keith 
to a 13-year extension worth $72 million on December 1, 2009. On April 
6, 2010, the Hawks won their 50th game of the 2009–10 season against the 
Dallas Stars, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season. The 
next night, April 7, the Hawks notched their 109th point of the season 
against the St. Louis Blues, setting another franchise record. The Blackhawks 
made the playoffs for the second consecutive season with a regular-season 
record of 52–22–8. They defeated the Nashville Predators in six games in 
the first round, before defeating the third-seeded Canucks for the second 
straight year, again in six games. The Blackhawks then played the top-seeded 
San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Finals and won the series in 
four games. The Blackhawks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first 
time since 1992. They faced the Philadelphia Flyers, and won the series 
in six games, with the overtime goal scored by Patrick Kane. It was the 
Blackhawks' first Cup win since 1961. After losing the final game of the 
2010–11 regular season at home to the Red Wings, the Blackhawks needed 
the Dallas Stars to either lose to the Minnesota Wild later that evening 
or at least have the game go into a shootout to qualify for the Stanley 
Cup Playoffs. Dallas lost 5–3, and the Blackhawks clinched the eighth and 
final seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the 2011 playoffs, 
the Blackhawks faced the top-seeded Vancouver Canucks. It was the third 
consecutive post-season the two teams faced each other. The Canucks built 
a 3–0 lead in the best-of-seven series before the Blackhawks were able 
to win three games in a row, becoming just the sixth (the feat was repeated 
in the second round that year by the Detroit Red Wings) team in NHL history 
to force a seventh game in a best-of-seven series after facing a 0–3 deficit. 
Alex Burrows won the seventh game for the Canucks in overtime, 2–1, to 
advance to the Western Conference Semifinal round. In the 2011 draft, they 
traded Troy Brouwer to the Washington Capitals for the 2011 26th overall 
pick and Brian Campbell to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Rostislav 
Olesz. Their first round picks were Mark McNeill (18th overall) and Phillip 
Danault (26th overall, via Washington). On March 31, 2012, the Blackhawks 
clinched the playoffs with a 5–4 win over the Nashville Predators. The 
win marked the Blackhawks fourth consecutive season making the playoffs. 
Eventually finishing with the sixth seed, they faced the Phoenix Coyotes 
in the opening round. The series, which Phoenix won in six games for their 
first playoff series win since the days of the old Winnipeg Jets, saw five 
of the six games going to overtime, with Bryan Bickell (game two) and Jonathan 
Toews (game five) scoring the only Blackhawk overtime winners of the series. 
The series was overshadowed however, by Raffi Torres' blindside hit on 
Marian Hossa in game three, forcing him out of the series with an upper 
body injury. Torres was suspended for 25 games, though it was eventually 
reduced to 21 games. The Blackhawks started the shortened 2012–13 season 
with much success, by establishing several new franchise and NHL records. 
On January 27, 2013, the Blackhawks set a new franchise record for starting 
the season 6–0–0 with a win against the Red Wings. On February 19 against 
the Vancouver Canucks, the Blackhawks tied the NHL record previously set 
by the Anaheim Ducks in the 2006–07 season for earning points in the first 
16 consecutive games of a season, and beat the Ducks record (28 points) 
by one point. On February 22 against the San Jose Sharks, the Blackhawks 
set a new NHL record for earning points in the first 17 consecutive games 
of a season. On March 5 against the Minnesota Wild, the Blackhawks recorded 
a franchise record of 10 consecutive wins. On March 6, the Blackhawks extended 
the NHL record to 24 games with a record of 21–0–3, and the franchise record 
for most consecutive wins to 11 games. On March 6, goaltender Ray Emery 
also set an NHL record of 10–0–0 with most consecutive wins to start a 
season. The Blackhawks lost 6–2 to the Colorado Avalanche on March 8. It 
was their first loss in regulation and ended their 24-game streak in which 
they earned at least one point, an NHL record to start a season. The streak 
was the third-longest in NHL history. The 1979–80 Philadelphia Flyers had 
a 35-game unbeaten streak from October 14 – January 6, and the 1977–78 
Montreal Canadiens had a 28-game unbeaten streak.[40][41][42] The United 
Center also recorded its 200th consecutive combined regular season and 
playoff Blackhawks sell-out on March 1 against the Columbus Blue Jackets, 
which began during the 2007–08 season with the game on March 30, 2008 against 
the Blue Jackets. The Blackhawks won the 2012–13 President's Trophy for 
the best regular season record in the league, at the same time earning 
home ice advantage throughout the entirety of the playoffs. After dispatching 
the Minnesota Wild in the first round, the Blackhawks faced the Detroit 
Red Wings in the Western Conference Semifinals. After winning the series 
opener, the Blackhawks lost the next three games, putting Chicago on the 
edge of elimination. However, the Hawks clawed back, eventually winning 
the series on a series-clinching goal by Brent Seabrook in overtime of 
game seven to defeat the Red Wings four games to three. A 4–3 win in game 
five of the Conference Final against the Los Angeles Kings on June 8, 2013 
saw them make their second Stanley Cup Final appearance in four seasons. 
Starting on June 12, 2013, they faced the Boston Bruins, another Original 
Six team, in the Finals. It was the first time since 1979 that two Original 
Six teams have made the Stanley Cup Finals and the first time since 1945 
that the last four teams to win the Stanley Cup were in the Conference 
Finals. It was also the first time that the Blackhawks and Bruins had faced 
each other in the Finals. The Bruins made their second appearance in the 
Finals in three years (winning in 2011) and were making a similar resurgence 
as the Blackhawks. On June 24, 2013, the Chicago Blackhawks defeated the 
Boston Bruins in the sixth game of the Stanley Cup Final to win the Stanley 
Cup for the 2012–13 NHL season, having overcome a 2–1 deficit with just 
over a minute remaining. Bryan Bickell and Dave Bolland scored goals with 
1:16 and 0:58.3 remaining in the game, just 17 seconds apart, to win 3–2. 
The Blackhawks began the 2013–14 season in hopes of becoming the first 
team to win consecutive Championships since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997 
and 1998.[43] The team was dramatically altered in the off-season to remain 
under the salary cap.[44] The team traded Dave Bolland, Daniel Carcillo 
and Michael Frolik in exchange for future draft picks, while parting ways 
with Ray Emery and Viktor Stalberg.[45] Despite these changes, The Blackhawks 
tallied a 28–7–7 record going into January 2014. The team played their 
second outdoor game in franchise history against the Pittsburgh Penguins 
at Soldier Field as part of the 2014 NHL Stadium Series. The Blackhawks 
defeated the Penguins, 5–1, in front of 62,921 fans.[46] The franchise 
recorded its 2,500th regular season win, while head coach Joel Quenneville 
won 693 wins as a coach, the third most in the history of the NHL.[47][48] 
The Blackhawks finished the season with a 46–21–15 record, good for third 
in the Central Division. They opened the playoffs by losing two games to 
the St. Louis Blues. The Blackhawks surged back with four straight games 
to win the series.[49] The team then defeated the Minnesota Wild for the 
second consecutive year. However, the Los Angeles Kings defeated the Blackhawks 
in seven games and would ultimately go on to win the Stanley Cup.[50] After 
the season's conclusion, Duncan Keith won the Norris Trophy for the second 
time in his career, and Jonathan Toews was named a finalist for the Frank 
J. Selke Trophy.[51][52] The Blackhawks' roster remained largely intact 
following the 2013–14 season. The team signed veteran center Brad Richards 
and rookie goaltender Scott Darling to one-year deals, and dealt defenseman 
Nick Leddy to the New York Islanders for three prospects.[53][54][55] For 
the first half of the season, Patrick Kane led the team in scoring and 
points. The Blackhawks mustered a 30–15–2 record going into the All-Star 
break.[56] The Blackhawks sent six players to the All-Star Game, including 
Kane, Jonathan Toews, Duncan Keith, Brent Seabrook, and Corey Crawford.[57] 
The team also played in the 2015 NHL Winter Classic at Nationals Park in 
Washington, D.C., where they lost to the Washington Capitals, 3–2.[58] 
However, in late February, Kane suffered a shoulder injury that was expected 
to sideline him for the remainder of the regular season and much of the 
post-season.[59] The team called up rookie Teuvo Teravainen from the American 
Hockey League, and traded their first-round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry 
Draft to acquire center Antoine Vermette from the Arizona Coyotes.[60] 
The Blackhawks also acquired veteran defenseman Kimmo Timonen from the 
Philadelphia Flyers for second round picks in 2015 and 2016.[61] The Blackhawks 
finished the season with a 48–28–6 record, placing third in their division. 
The team allowed the fewest goals in the NHL.[62] Kane recovered quicker 
than projected and was ready for the start of the playoffs.[63] The Blackhawks 
dispatched the Nashville Predators in six games, and swept the Minnesota 
Wild to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the fifth time in 
seven years.[64] The top-seeded Anaheim Ducks held a 3–2 lead in the series, 
but the Blackhawks rallied back in the series to win games six and seven. 
The team defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals 
to secure their third Stanley Cup in six seasons.[65] The Blackhawks started 
out wearing black and white jerseys until 1933, when it introduced red 
to the palette. With the exception of cream replacing white from 1935 to 
1937, and a minimally designed sweater during that period, the Black Hawks, 
as they were called then, wore barber pole-styled jerseys from 1926 to 
1955. In 1940 a white uniform was introduced, featuring none of the barber 
pole stripes the team was known for then. The crest logo went through some 
cosmetic changes during the uniform's lifetime. Since 1955, the Blackhawks 
basically had the same uniform design, featuring red uniforms with alternating 
white and black stripes on the bottom and sleeves, and white uniforms with 
black and red stripes on the bottom and sleeves. Over the years, the crest 
logo underwent several cosmetic changes before evolving to its current 
form by 1999. The crossed tomahawk logo adorned both sleeves before it 
moved to the shoulders in 1959. In 1957 sleeve numbers were added, while 
a secondary trim color for the uniform numbers were added in 1973. Player 
names were added in 1977, in compliance with the new NHL rule put in place. 
A black alternate jersey was introduced in 1996, featuring white and red 
stripes. Like all NHL teams for the 2007–08 NHL season, the Chicago Blackhawks 
unveiled the Rbk EDGE jerseys from Reebok. Unlike other clubs, Chicago 
did not deviate much from previous jerseys with small exceptions: The Blackhawks 
brought back their black third jerseys for several games in 2008–09 after 
a one-year absence. For the 2009 Winter Classic, the Blackhawks wore jerseys 
based on the design worn in the 1936–37 season. The jersey is predominantly 
black with a large beige stripe across the chest (also on the sleeves), 
with a red border, and an old-style circular Black Hawks logo.[66] The 
Blackhawks used this Winter Classic design as their third jersey for the 
2009–10 season until they retired after the 2010–11 season, with the only 
change in the design was by adding the familiar "C" with crossed tomahawks 
on the shoulders. The Blackhawks' uniform was voted one of the 25 best 
in professional sports by Paul Lukas of GQ in November 2004. The Hockey 
News voted the team's jersey as the best in the NHL.[67] In 2009, The Blackhawks 
wore special camouflage jerseys on Veterans Day during their pregame warm-ups. 
The jerseys were later sold in auctions to raise money for the USO of Illinois.[68] 
For the 2014 NHL Stadium Series, the Blackhawks wore a black uniform similar 
to the alternates they wore from 1996 to 2009, but the stripes around the 
waist are no longer straight, they are jagged around the sides in order 
to follow the shape of the bottom of the jersey. Keeping with stripes, 
the ones on the arms simply stop halfway round; angled numbers are above 
these sleeve half-stripes. On one shoulder is the familiar "C" with crossed 
tomahawks logo and the Chicago 2014 Stadium Series logo on the other. Each 
2014 NHL Stadium Series jerseys features chrome-treated logo designs inspired 
by the NHL shield. The chrome crest was developed using new technology 
that fuses print and embroidery and allows logos to be displayed as a high-resolution 
image incorporated into the crest. As a result, the design reduces the 
weight of the crest, creating in a lighter jersey. Numbering on the back 
of the jersey is enlarged and sleeve numbers are angled to improve visibility 
in outdoor venues.[69] For the 2015 NHL Winter Classic, the Blackhawks 
wore a uniform which was inspired by their 1957–58 jersey. This uniform 
is nearly identical to the road uniform that the Blackhawks currently wear. 
The main differences between this design and the current road design comes 
in the form of the lace up collar, the name/number block font (which is 
serifed), and the C-Tomahawk logo, which is mostly red, black, and white 
(with a tad bit of yellow) instead of being mostly red, yellow, green black 
and white.[70] For the 2016 NHL Stadium Series, the Blackhawks wore a unique 
uniform for their game against the Minnesota Wild. This uniform is primarily 
white with black/red/black stripes on the sleeves and socks. The current 
logo is on the chest. Framed between the two black stripes and over the 
red stripe on the sleeve is the familiar "C" with crossed tomahawks. The 
collar of the uniform features two different colors. The four, six-pointed 
red stars from the Flag of Chicago is featured on the white portion of 
the collar, while the other side of the collar is black. Sleeve numbers 
have been shifted to the shoulders and enlarged. With the shoulders being 
black, the numbering is white. But, the numbering and lettering on the 
back is also enlarged and black in color.[71] McLaughlin's wife, Irene 
Castle, designed the original version of the team's logo, which featured 
a crudely-drawn black and white Native head in a circle.[72] This design 
went through several significant changes between 1926 and 1955. During 
this period, seven distinct versions of the primary logo were worn on the 
team's uniforms. At the beginning of the 1955–56 season, the outer circle 
was removed and the head began to resemble the team's current primary logo. 
This crest and uniform went through subtle changes until the 1964–65 season; 
the basic logo and jersey design have remained constant ever since. In 
2008, The Hockey News' staff voted the team's main logo to be the best 
in the NHL.[73] In 2010, sports columnist Damien Cox called on the franchise 
to retire the "racially insensitive" logo, saying that, "Clearly, no right-thinking 
person would name a team after an aboriginal figure these days any more 
than they would use Muslims or Africans or Chinese or any ethnic group 
to depict a specific sporting notion."[74] Furthermore, the National Congress 
of American Indians (NCAI) believes that all Native-themed logos, including 
that of the Blackhawks, "continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated 
during a time when white superiority and segregation were common place." 
[75] The Blackhawks have worked with the American Indian Center to help 
educate their community and fan base by sharing Native American culture 
and history. Scott Sypolt, executive counsel for the American Indian Center, 
commented on the logo and name controversy: Joe Podlasek, the executive 
director of the American Indian Center of Chicago, commented on their relationship, 
stating, "[The Hawks] are far and away ahead of everyone else in forward-thinking. 
What they have done is engaged the community. In the other cities (organizations) 
want nothing to do with native people but yet they’re trying to say they 
respect us."[76] However, this stance is markedly different from the one 
taken by the American Indian Center up until recent years. In 2010, Joe 
Podlasek stated that, "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks 
logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. Would you do that 
with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on 
it and dance on it?" [77] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe 
of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position may be tied to contributions 
the team has recently begun making to the center: "We all do contributions, 
but we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something 
we've done that's offensive." [78] The Blackhawks mascot is Tommy Hawk, 
a hawk who wears the Blackhawks' four feathers on his head, along with 
a Blackhawks jersey and hockey pants. Tommy Hawk often participates in 
the T-shirt toss and puck chuck at the United Center. He walks around the 
concourse greeting fans before and during the game. The Hawks introduced 
Tommy in the 2001–02 season. The Blackhawks have had two giveaways featuring 
Tommy Hawk items. The first was a bobble-head doll and the second was a 
Mountain Dew-sponsored Tommy Hawk water bottle. "Here Come the Hawks!" 
is the official fight song and introduction of the Chicago Blackhawks. 
The song was written by J. Swayzee, an avid Blackhawks fan, and produced 
by the Dick Marx Orchestra and Choir in 1968 and is heard quite often both 
in vocal and organ renditions during Blackhawks home games.[79] In late 
2007 the song "Keys to the City" was released by Ministry & Co Conspirators 
as a gift to the Blackhawks organization.[80] The Blackhawks were one of 
the first NHL teams to sound a horn whenever they scored a goal at home.[81] 
Bill Wirtz donated his yacht's horn to Chicago Stadium.[81] The goal horn 
became a popular trend among other NHL teams after the Blackhawks played 
the Montreal Canadiens in the 1973 Stanley Cup Finals.[81] The Blackhawks 
began playing "Chelsea Dagger" by The Fratellis as their official goal 
song during the 2008-09 NHL season.[79][82] The Blackhawks also have dedicated 
goal songs for Patrick Kane ("Rock You Like a Hurricane" by The Scorpions) 
and Jonathan Toews ("Johnny B. Goode" by Chuck Berry).[83] It is a tradition 
for Blackhawks fans to applaud and cheer loudly during the singing of the 
national anthem. This tradition originated during a 1985 Campbell Conference 
playoff game at Chicago Stadium versus the Edmonton Oilers.[84] Jim Cornelison 
currently sings the national anthem for all home games. Before their 2010 
Stanley Cup victory, the team had not won the Cup since 1961. At 49 years, 
it was the second longest Stanley Cup drought in NHL history at the time, 
behind the New York Rangers, which ended in 1994 after 54 years.[85] On 
June 9, 2010, the Blackhawks won the 2010 Stanley Cup championship in six 
games, beating the Philadelphia Flyers 4–3 in sudden death overtime with 
a goal by Patrick Kane. As of 2016, The Toronto Maple Leafs currently hold 
the second longest drought of 49 years since a Stanley Cup win dating back 
to 1967. For the first time in team history, all 82 games plus playoffs 
were broadcast on television during the 2008–09 season. At least 20 of 
them aired on WGN-TV (Channel 9), the first time the Blackhawks had been 
seen on local over-the-air television in 30 years. Games produced by WGN-TV 
through its WGN Sports department are not available in its superstation 
feed WGN America due to league broadcast rights restrictions. Other games 
not broadcast by WGN-TV are aired on regional sports network Comcast SportsNet 
Chicago, the first time in at least 35 years that non-nationally broadcast 
home games were seen locally, either over-the-air or on cable. On February 
15, 2011, it was announced that the team had renewed their broadcast contract 
with WGN-TV for the next five years, starting in the 2011–12 NHL season. 
The deal was further extended for three more years on May 15, 2014, keeping 
the team on Channel 9 until the end of the 2018–19 season.[86] Radio broadcasts 
since the 1970s and into the mid-2000s varied between WBBM (780) and WMAQ/WSCR 
(670), and often came into conflict with White Sox baseball by the start 
of April. On April 30, 2008, the team signed a three-year deal with WGN 
Radio (720 AM), with games airing alternately instead on WIND (560 AM) 
in scheduling conflict situations during the baseball season due to the 
Cubs having contractual preference to air on WGN; these moved to WGWG-LP 
(Channel 6/87.7 FM, an analog television station carrying an audio-only 
sports talk format using a quirk in the FM band) in mid-2014 when Tribune 
began a local marketing agreement with that station's owner. During the 
2010 Stanley Cup Finals, the Cubs agreed to allow the Blackhawks games 
to be broadcast on WGN and have the Cubs revert to WIND when there was 
a conflict. This allowed the Finals games to be heard over a larger area 
due to WGN's clear-channel signal. All Blackhawk games are also streamed 
live on wgnradio.com, regardless of whether the games are on WGN or WGWG-LP. 
WLUP-FM (97.9 FM) is also utilized as an alternate station. This is a partial 
list of the last five seasons completed by the Blackhawks. For the full
