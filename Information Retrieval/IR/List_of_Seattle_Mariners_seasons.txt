The Seattle Mariners have completed 39 seasons of professional baseball 
in the West division of Major League Baseball (MLB)'s American League (AL) 
since they began play in 1977. From 1977 until June 27, 1999, the Mariners 
played in Seattle's Kingdome. Since July 15, 1999, the Mariners have played 
at Safeco Field.[1] Their name reflects their home city's coastal and marine 
culture. An expansion team created as a result of a breach of contract 
lawsuit involving the Seattle Pilots' 1969 departure after just one year 
in Seattle,[2] the Mariners finished each of their first 14 seasons with 
a losing record. However, after Seattle won its division and a playoff 
berth for the first time in 1995, they have enjoyed sporadic success, making 
the playoffs three more times but never advancing beyond the American League 
Championship Series (ALCS). The following table describes the Mariners' 
MLB winâ€“loss record by decade. These statistics are from Baseball-Reference.com's 
Seattle Mariners History & Encyclopedia,[9] and are current as of October
