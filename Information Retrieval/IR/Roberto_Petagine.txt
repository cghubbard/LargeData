Roberto Antonio Petagine (/pɛtəˈɡɪneɪ/; born June 7, 1971 in Nueva Esparta, 
Venezuela) is a retired professional baseball player. His Major League 
Baseball career includes brief stints with the Houston Astros (1994), San 
Diego Padres (1995), New York Mets (1996 and 1997), Cincinnati Reds (1998), 
Boston Red Sox (2005), and Seattle Mariners (2006); but he is best known 
for his success in the Japanese Central League between 1999 and 2004 where, 
as a member of the Yakult Swallows (1999–2002) and Yomiuri Giants (2003–2004), 
he was among that country's premier offensive players. Petagine entered 
professional baseball on February 13, 1990, at the age of 18, when Houston 
signed him as an undrafted amateur free agent after starting his career 
in Venezuela with the Leones del Caracas baseball team in which he contributed 
with his power for several campaigns becoming a star and a well-known baseball 
player in his country. Later that year, he played his first pro season 
with the rookie-level GCL Astros of the Gulf Coast League. His production 
there, and the following year with Single-A Burlington, was solid (if unspectacular). 
Petagine would go on to substantial minor league success in his early to 
mid 20s, but even his early stats hinted at the trends that would define—and 
perhaps curse—his career in American baseball: always having an above-average 
OBP, but relatively little home run power, by the standards historically 
applied to first basemen. A solid contact hitter who used the whole field 
with occasional pull power, the young Petagine was indeed most noteworthy 
for his control of the strike zone, and more specifically for the exceptional 
rate at which he drew walks. His breakout years were in 1992 through 1994, 
as he moved through the minors to Triple-A, cumulatively averaging an OBP 
above .400 and a .500+ slugging percentage. Baseball America twice ranked 
him among the Astros' top ten prospects (in 1992 and 1994 [1]); he was 
a three-time All-Star (1996–1998) in Triple-A; and he won the International 
League's MVP Award in back-to-back years: 1997 as a member of the Mets' 
Triple-A affiliate in Norfolk and 1998 as a member of the Reds' Triple-A 
affiliate in Indianapolis. Despite his early successes, though, Petagine 
would never become a regular in the majors, nor receive much chance to 
play his way into the role; he was traded three times between December, 
1994 and February, 1998, and in December 1998 the Reds sold his contract 
to the Yakult Swallows. A new home helped revitalize Petagine's career. 
Let go by the Reds in 1998, he proved a welcome addition in the Japanese 
Central League, as he won three Gold Gloves, two home run titles and one 
Central League MVP award while playing for the Yakult Swallows (1999–2002) 
and Yomiuri Giants (2003–04). For Yakult and Yomiuri, Petagine hit .317 
with 223 home runs and 594 RBI in 756 games. In 2003–04, Petagine became 
the highest-paid baseball player in Japan. The Giants acquired him to take 
the place of departed Hideki Matsui who came to the United States to play 
for the New York Yankees. However, he was forced to play as an outfielder 
because there was also infielder Kazuhiro Kiyohara.[2] Before the 2005 
season, the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league contract with Petagine. 
He underwent knee surgery in spring training, preventing him from making 
the 25-man roster. In August, first baseman John Olerud was placed on the 
15-day disabled list and his roster spot was filled by Petagine, who'd 
had a productive Triple-A season (including a .327 batting average with 
20 home runs and 69 RBI in 74 games at Pawtucket). In 18 games with Boston, 
he hit .281 (9-for-34) with one home run and nine RBI. The Red Sox declined 
to sign Petagine for the 2006 season. He signed a minor league contract 
with the Seattle Mariners, and was invited to spring training. After a 
productive spring, he made the major league team as a backup to Richie 
Sexson. On July 9, 2006, he was designated for assignment by the Mariners. 
In 2008, Petagine played first baseman for the Diablos Rojos del Mexico 
of the Mexican League. On May 12, 2008, the LG Twins announced that he 
would join the team, in substitution for starting pitcher Jamie Brown. 
The contract was worth $250,000 throughout the year of 2008. Petagine returned 
to NPB to play one season for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks before retiring.
