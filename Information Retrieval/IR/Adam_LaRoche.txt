David Adam LaRoche (born November 6, 1979) is a former American professional 
baseball first baseman who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He played for the Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Red Sox, Arizona 
Diamondbacks, Washington Nationals and Chicago White Sox. He is the son 
of pitcher Dave LaRoche and the brother of third baseman Andy LaRoche. 
Adam LaRoche was a 1998 graduate of Fort Scott High School in Fort Scott, 
Kansas, where he played baseball. He was named an All-American in baseball 
as a senior. His uncle, Dave Regan, was his high school head coach.[citation

in 1999 before transferring to Seminole Community College in Seminole, 
Oklahoma in 2000, where he was an All-American and the MVP of the Junior 
College World Series.[citation needed] He had been drafted by the Florida 
Marlins in both the 1998 and 1999 amateur drafts, but refused to sign. 
He was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 2000 and did sign. For the start 
of the 2004 season, the Braves made LaRoche, who had not yet made his major 
league debut, their starting first baseman. The left-handed LaRoche platooned 
with 46-year-old veteran Julio Franco and put up a respectable .278 rookie 
batting average. LaRoche demonstrated his strong defensive skills at first 
base, but also a lack of speed running the bases.[citation needed] LaRoche 
again platooned with Franco in 2005. While he did hit 22 home runs, LaRoche 
had a very streaky season. He hit .385 in his final 17 games of the year, 
but just .105 in the 19 games that preceded that streak. He batted .500 
with a grand slam in the Braves 2005 NLDS Series against the Houston Astros. 
With the offseason departure of Franco, LaRoche became the Braves sole 
starter at first base in 2006. On May 15, 2006, LaRoche garnered the contempt 
of Braves fans, players, and management after a play in which he fielded 
a routine grounder and lackadaisically jogged to first, and was beaten 
to the bag by Nick Johnson. LaRoche was heavily booed by the crowd (which 
continued for some time in the following games) and was benched for the 
play.[1] On May 28, 2006, LaRoche contributed two of the Braves' record 
eight home runs in a remarkable win against the Chicago Cubs. In addition, 
in a wild game against the San Diego Padres on July 14, 2006, LaRoche hit 
two more home runs and had five RBIs to help the Braves to a 15–12, 11-inning 
win. He finished the year with a .285 average, 32 home runs, and 90 RBIs 
— all career-bests. The Braves traded LaRoche and minor league outfielder 
Jamie Romak to the Pittsburgh Pirates on January 17, 2007 for reliever 
Mike Gonzalez and minor league shortstop Brent Lillibridge. During the 
2009 season he played with his brother Andy LaRoche with the Pirates until 
July 22, 2009 when he was traded to the Boston Red Sox. On May 13, 2009, 
LaRoche became the first player in major league history to have a home 
run taken away through the use of video replay.[2] On July 22, 2009, LaRoche 
was traded to the Boston Red Sox[3] for minor league pitcher Hunter Strickland 
and shortstop Argenis Díaz.[4] In six games, LaRoche would go on to hit 
one home run and three RBIs, with an average of .263. During his brief 
tenure in Boston, LaRoche lived with his teammate J. D. Drew in Drew's 
home in Boston. On July 31, 2009, after only spending six games with Boston 
he was dealt back to his former Atlanta Braves for first baseman Casey 
Kotchman.[5] LaRoche was traded by Boston in order to cut payroll and the 
belief that Kotchman would be a better pinch hitter than LaRoche would.[citation

with the Arizona Diamondbacks. His deal included a $7.5 million mutual 
option with a $1.5 million buyout.[6] In his 1-year tenure with the Diamondbacks, 
LaRoche hit .261 with 25 home runs and 100 RBI in 151 games. On January 
4, 2011, LaRoche agreed to a 2-year contract with the Washington Nationals.[7] 
His contract paid him $7 million in 2011 and $8 million in 2012 with a 
mutual option for $10 million in 2013.[8] On April 7, LaRoche hit his first 
home run as a member of the Nationals, a game-winning two-run home run 
off Florida Marlins reliever Edward Mujica in the 11th inning of a 5–3 
Nationals win. His 2011 season ended with labrum surgery on his left shoulder[9] 
with career-low batting numbers of .172/.288/.258 (BA/OBP/SLG).[10] LaRoche's 
2012 season began much more successfully, hitting .329 in April. He was 
a consistent bat throughout the season, driving in no fewer than 12 runs 
each month from April to August.[11] LaRoche accomplished a rare feat in 
early September when he homered in each game of a four-game series against 
the Chicago Cubs (and hit five home runs overall). The only other players 
to match this feat are Hall-of-Fame sluggers Babe Ruth, Hank Greenberg, 
Yogi Berra, Johnny Bench, and Mike Schmidt.[12] On October 2, LaRoche reached 
two personal milestones. He hit his career-high 33rd home run, in the process 
tying a career high of 100 RBI.[13] He earned his first Gold Glove and 
the Silver Slugger Award.[14] LaRoche declined his $13.3 million 2013 option 
on November 1 and became a free agent. Since the Nationals exercised their 
half, LaRoche wasn't paid a $1 million buyout.[15] On January 8, 2013, 
LaRoche signed a 2-year, $24 million contract to remain with the Nationals, 
that included a mutual option for 2015.[16] LaRoche had a down year in 
2013, hitting .237 with 20 homeruns and 62 RBI in 152 games. LaRoche had 
a good bounce back season in 2014, hitting .259 with 26 home runs and 92 
RBI in 140 games. After the Nats were eliminated in the NLDS by the San 
Francisco Giants, the Nats announced they would not pick up LaRoche's $15.3MM 
option, with the intent of moving Ryan Zimmerman to first base. On November 
25, 2014, the Chicago White Sox announced that LaRoche had been signed 
to a two–year, $25 million contract.[17] LaRoche hit his 250th career home 
run off Detroit Tigers reliever Joakim Soria in a 4-3 White Sox win on 
June 6, 2015.[18] On March 15, 2016, LaRoche said that he intended to "step 
away from baseball." He said that he would honor a request from teammates 
to reconsider his retirement for a day or two before making an official 
announcement.[19] On the next day, it was revealed that LaRoche's reason 
for a possible retirement was that the White Sox had placed a restriction 
on his 14-year-old son entering the team's clubhouse every day. By retiring, 
LaRoche walked away from a $13 million contract.[20] The following day, 
teammates were close to boycotting their spring training game until manager 
Robin Ventura stepped in and told the players to play. White Sox executive 
vice president Kenny Williams defended his request by stating "name one 
job in the country where you can bring your child to work every day." LaRoche's 
decision was also helped by a change of perspective after spending ten 
days undercover, helping to identify and rescue under-age sex slaves in 
Southeast Asia with Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Blaine Boyer. [21] LaRoche 
and his wife Jennifer have a daughter, Montana, and a son, Drake.[22] His 
hobbies include fishing, hunting, and golf. He is the son of former Major 
League pitcher Dave LaRoche and older brother of Andy LaRoche. LaRoche 
suffers from ADHD that was diagnosed during his high school years, which 
occasionally leads to on field blunders such as in a game against the Washington 
Nationals in 2006, when he picked up a Nick Johnson ground ball that should 
have resulted in the third out of the inning, but did not move quickly 
to step on first base. Johnson beat LaRoche to the base; the inning continued, 
and the Nationals scored four unearned runs. Washington won 8-1, and LaRoche 
was benched for the next game.[23] LaRoche is one of the co-owners of Outdoor 
Networks hunting show Buck Commander with friends and pro athletes Chipper 
Jones, Ryan Langerhans, Tom Martin, Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, and Willie 
Robertson who is from the Duck Commander series. LaRoche is a devout Christian 
who helped the Washington Nationals promote "Faith Day" at Nationals Park
