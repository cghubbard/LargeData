The Baseball Ground (sometimes referred to as the BBG)[1] was a stadium 
in Derby, England. It was first used for baseball as the home of Derby 
County Baseball Club from 1890 until 1898 and then for football as the 
home of Derby County from 1895 until 1997. The club's reserve and youth 
sides used it until 2003, when it finally closed as a sports stadium after 
113 years (108 of them as a football stadium) and was demolished. As the 
name suggests, the stadium was originally used for baseball. It was originally 
called Ley's Baseball Ground and was part of a complex of sports grounds 
(Ley's Recreation Ground) built and owned by businessman Sir Francis Ley 
for workers at his foundry, Ley's Malleable Castings Vulcan Ironworks. 
The stadium was the focal point of the complex and was part of a personal 
quest by Ley to introduce baseball to the UK. The stadium was home to Derby 
County Baseball Club, which was allied to the more famous Derby County 
Football Club. The baseball club ran away with the first championship after 
the National Baseball League of Great Britain and Ireland was established 
in 1890. However, pressure from other teams in the league over the number 
of American players Derby used forced them to resign at the end of the 
league's first season, though the baseball club itself lasted until 1898. 
Derby County Football Club was formed in 1884, as an offshoot of the Derbyshire 
County Cricket Club.[2] The football club played on a pitch that was part 
of the Derby cricket ground, which at that time was in the middle of a 
racecourse.[2] This site, which had minimal facilities, was chosen to host 
five FA Cup semi-finals, the replay of the 1886 FA Cup Final and an England 
international match in 1895.[2] Derby had occasionally used Ley's Baseball 
Ground for their home matches due to horse racing meetings taking priority.[2] 
With their partner baseball club in decline, Derby County FC made it their 
permanent home in 1895 and renamed it The Baseball Ground. A party of Gypsies 
were forced to move and legend has it that before leaving they put a curse 
on the ground preventing Derby County winning the FA Cup. The ground became 
the property of the club in 1924 when it was purchased from Ley's heirs 
for £10,000. The Baseball Ground was once used for an international match: 
England beat Ireland 2-1 in a British Home Championship match on 11 February 
1911. At its height, the Baseball Ground could accommodate around 42,000 
spectators. The record attendance was 41,826 for a match against Tottenham 
Hotspur in 1969, just after Derby County were promoted under the management 
of Brian Clough, at the beginning of the most successful era in the club's 
history. Clough guided Derby County to the league title in 1972 and his 
successor Dave Mackay oversaw another title triumph in 1975. However, attendances 
fell at the turn of the 1980s as Derby were relegated from the First Division 
in 1980, and in 1984 they fell into the Third Division, though an upswing 
in form followed and they were back in the First Division by 1987. Perimeter 
fencing was erected between the stands and the pitch during the 1970s to 
combat pitch invasions by hooligans, but this was dismantled in April 1989, 
within days of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool fans were 
fatally injured, most of them crushed to death against perimeter fencing. 
This resulted in policing levels in games at the Baseball Ground being 
increased by 50%.[citation needed] Derby County remained at the stadium 
until 1997, when they relocated to the Pride Park Stadium. The relocation 
plan had only been unveiled some 18 months before the new stadium was opened 
- chairman Lionel Pickering had originally planned to boost Derby's stadium 
capacity by rebuilding it with a 26,000-seat capacity. The last league 
match to be played there was a Premier League fixture against Arsenal (where 
18,287 people watched Derby lose 3-1, although their top flight status 
was secured one season after promotion), though the stadium continued to 
be used for reserve team games for a few seasons afterwards.[3] In late 
2003, the Baseball Ground was finally demolished to make way for housing. 
The former ground has since been redeveloped to around 150 new homes and, 
in September 2010 a commemorative statue was unveiled on the site. The 
15' (4 and a half metre) high metalwork featuring the silhouettes of three 
footballers dribbling and shooting was commissioned by the builders Spirita 
and Strata and designed by artist Denis O'Connor.[4] A fan, George Glover, 
'made history' by scoring the last ever goal at the Baseball Ground in 
a game between fans. [5] After the Taylor Report was published, the stadium 
was slowly converted to become all-seater from terracing. Consequently 
its capacity dropped to 17,451 in the 1995–96 season.[6] This was inadequate 
for the ambitions of Derby County, who were chasing promotion to the Premier 
League during the early to mid-1990s, finally achieving it as Division 
One runners-up in 1996. The stadium featured two 3-tier stands at either 
end, both with the lowest tier not facing completely straight towards the 
pitch (due to the previous configuration for baseball) giving a wedge-like 
appearance at one end. Also, in one corner was a unique stand that was 
more house-like, mainly for media use. In 1990, a halt was built to serve 
the stadium called Ramsline Halt although only four trains ever stopped
