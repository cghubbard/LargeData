The Cal Ripken Collegiate Baseball League (CRCBL) is a collegiate summer 
baseball league located in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland 
metropolitan areas. All players are from NCAA-sanctioned colleges and universities 
and have at least one year of NCAA eligibility remaining. The CRCBL is 
a member of the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball (NACSB). The 
CRCBL was founded in 2005.[1] The league was named in honor of Cal Ripken, 
Sr. in recognition of his lifelong dedication "to helping young baseball 
players develop and reach their potential." Although the league is named 
in his honor, it is not associated with the Cal Ripken, Sr. foundation.[2] 
In 2009 the league removed the "Sr." in the name to accommodate both Cal 
Ripken, Sr. and Cal Ripken, Jr.. The league's founding teams were the Bethesda 
Big Train, College Park Bombers, Maryland Redbirds, Rockville Express, 
Silver Spring-Takoma Thunderbolts, and Youse's Maryland Orioles. The Herndon 
Braves joined in 2007 and the Alexandria Aces joined in 2008, expanding 
the league into Northern Virginia.[2] In 2009, the Southern Maryland Nationals, 
formerly the "Southern Maryland Cardinals", joined the league for the 2010 
season when it was announced that the College Park Bombers would not be 
competing in 2010 due to financial struggles.[3][4] Another name change 
occurred as the Maryland Redbirds changed their name to the "Baltimore 
Redbirds." In 2011, the Vienna River Dogs became the ninth team in the 
league and the third in Northern Virginia. The league expanded into Washington, 
D.C. when the D.C. Grays joined for the 2012 season. In 2013 two new teams, 
the Baltimore Presstman Cardinals and the Gaithersburg Giants, joined the 
League. In 2014 the Cardinals were replaced by the Baltimore Dodgers and 
the Southern Maryland Nationals ceased operations. <http://calripkenleague.org> 
After the completion of the 2014 season, Youse's Maryland Orioles announced 
that they would not be competing in the League in 2015. In 2015 the League 
changed to a two division format with a playoff. On July 15, 2009, the 
CRCBL took on the Valley Baseball League, another collegiate wooden bat 
league based in Virginia, in the Mid-Atlantic Classic in Waldorf, Maryland. 
Each side gathered a roster of All-Stars for the match. In the game, the 
Ripken League defeated the Valley League 2-1 (see game summary). On July 
11, 2011 the two leagues held the second Mid-Atlantic Classic (the scheduled 
2010 re-match was rained out) at Eagle Field at Veterans Memorial Stadium 
in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The Ripken League won again, this time by a 
score of 6-3 (see game summary and box score). In 2007, CRCBL alumnus Joe 
Smith earned a spot on a major league roster, with the New York Mets.[5] 
In May 2009, Brett Cecil, who pitched for the Thunderbolts in 2005, was 
called up by the Toronto Blue Jays. In 2013 he became the first Ripken 
League alum to be selected to an MLB All-Star team, representing the American 
League. The 2008 MLB Draft saw 40 former or current players chosen. Some 
players drafted included former Big Train player Carlos Gutierrez, at 27th 
overall by the Minnesota Twins. Three other players got drafted in the 
first three rounds: former Big Train player Evan Frederickson, at 35th 
overall by the Milwaukee Brewers, and two former players from the Youse's 
Orioles, Derrik Gibson in the 2nd round by the Boston Red Sox, and L. J. 
Hoes in the 3rd round by the Baltimore Orioles. In the 2009 MLB draft, 
37 former Ripken Leaguers were chosen, with the highest being Ben Tootle 
in the 3rd round, by the Minnesota Twins. In the 2010 MLB Draft, 31 former 
Ripken Leaguers were chosen, with the highest being Jarrett Parker in the 
2nd round, by the San Francisco Giants.[6] In the 2011 MLB Draft, 33 former 
Ripken Leaguers were chosen, with the highest being Jed Bradley in the 
1st round (15th overall), by the Milwaukee Brewers.[7] In the 2012 MLB 
Draft, 31 former Ripken Leaguers were chosen, with the highest being Kyle 
Zimmer in the 1st round (5th overall), by the Kansas City Royals.[8] In 
the 2013 MLB Draft, 22 former Ripken Leaguers were chosen, with the highest 
being Hunter Renfroe in the 1st round (13th overall), by the San Diego 
Padres.[9] In the 2014 MLB Draft, 26 former Ripken Leaguers were chosen, 
with the highest being Mark Zagunis in the 3rd round, by the Chicago Cubs.[10]
