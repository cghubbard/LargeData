Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941 – August 28, 1955) was an African-American 
teenager who was lynched in Mississippi at the age of 14 after reportedly 
flirting with a white woman. Till was from Chicago, Illinois, and visiting 
relatives in Money, a small town in the Mississippi Delta region. He spoke 
to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the married proprietor of a small grocery 
store there. Several nights later, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother 
J. W. Milam went to Till's great-uncle's house and abducted the boy. They 
took him away and beat and mutilated him before shooting him and sinking 
his body in the Tallahatchie River. Three days later, Till's body was discovered 
and retrieved from the river. Till's body was returned to Chicago. His 
mother, who had mostly raised him, insisted on a public funeral service 
with an open casket to show the world the brutality of the killing. "The 
open-coffin funeral held by Mamie Till Bradley exposed the world to more 
than her son Emmett Till's bloated, mutilated body. Her decision focused 
attention not only on American racism and the barbarism of lynching but 
also on the limitations and vulnerabilities of American democracy".[1] 
Tens of thousands attended his funeral or viewed his casket and images 
of his mutilated body were published in black-oriented magazines and newspapers, 
rallying popular black support and white sympathy across the U.S. Intense 
scrutiny was brought to bear on the condition of black civil rights in 
Mississippi, with newspapers around the country critical of the state. 
Although initially local newspapers and law enforcement officials decried 
the violence against Till and called for justice, they soon began responding 
to national criticism by defending Mississippians, which eventually transformed 
into support for the killers. In September 1955, Bryant and Milam were 
acquitted of Till's kidnapping and murder. Protected against double jeopardy, 
Bryant and Milam publicly admitted in an interview with Look magazine that 
they killed Till. Problems identifying Till affected the trial, partially 
leading to Bryant's and Milam's acquittals, and the case was officially 
reopened by the United States Department of Justice in 2004. As part of 
the investigation, the body was exhumed and autopsied resulting in a positive 
identification. He was reburied in a new casket, which is the standard 
practice in cases of body exhumation. His original casket was donated to 
the Smithsonian Institution. The trial of Bryant and Milam attracted a 
vast amount of press attention. Till's murder is noted as a pivotal catalyst 
to the next phase of the Civil Rights Movement. Events surrounding Emmett 
Till's life and death, according to historians, continue to resonate. Some 
writers have suggested that almost every story about Mississippi returns 
to Till, or the region in which he died, in "some spiritual, homing way".[2] 
Emmett Till was the son of Mamie Carthan (1921–2003) and Louis Till (1922–1945). 
Emmett's mother was born in the small Delta town of Webb, Mississippi. 
The Delta region encompasses the large, multi-county area of northwestern 
Mississippi in the watershed of the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers. When 
Carthan was two years old, her family moved to Argo, Illinois, as part 
of the Great Migration of rural black families out of the South to the 
North to escape lack of opportunity and unequal treatment under the law.[3] 
Argo received so many Southern migrants it was named "Little Mississippi"; 
Carthan's mother's home was often used as a way station for people who 
had just moved from the South as they were trying to find jobs and housing. 
Mississippi was the poorest state in the U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta 
counties were some of the poorest in Mississippi.[4] In Tallahatchie County, 
where Mamie Carthan was born, the average income per household in 1949 
was $690 ($6,755 in 2013 dollars); for black families it was $462 ($4,523 
in 2013 dollars).[5] Economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. 
Most of them were sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks 
had essentially been excluded from voting and the political system since 
the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution in 1890, and 
had very few legal rights. Till was born in Chicago and nicknamed "Bobo" 
as an infant by a family friend. His mother Mamie largely raised him with 
her mother; she and Louis Till separated in 1942 after she discovered he 
had been unfaithful. Louis later choked her to unconsciousness, to which 
she responded by throwing scalding water at him.[6] For violating court 
orders to stay away from Mamie, Emmett's father Louis was forced by a judge 
to choose between jail or enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1943;[7] he was 
executed in Italy in 1945 after being convicted of rape and murder by a 
court-martial. At the age of six Emmett contracted polio, leaving him with 
a persistent stutter.[8] Mamie and Emmett moved to Detroit, where she met 
and married "Pink" Bradley in 1951. Emmett preferred to live in Chicago, 
so he relocated to live with his grandmother; his mother and stepfather 
rejoined him later that year. After the marriage dissolved in 1952, Bradley 
returned to Detroit.[9] Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived together in 
a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near extended relatives. She 
began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary 
and recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at 
home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered that 
he did not know his own limitations at times. Following his and Mamie's 
separation, Bradley visited and began threatening her. At eleven years 
old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him 
if Bradley did not leave.[10] Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and 
his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage 
of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's 
underwear on his head), and spent their free time in pickup baseball games. 
He was a natty dresser and often the center of attention among his peers.[11] 
In 1955, Emmett was stocky and muscular, weighing about 150 pounds (68 kg) 
and standing 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 m). Despite his being 14 years old, 
whites in Mississippi claimed Till looked like an adult.[12] Mamie Till 
Bradley's uncle, 64-year-old Mose Wright, visited her and Emmett in Chicago 
during the summer and told Emmett stories about living in the Mississippi 
Delta. Emmett wanted to see for himself. Bradley was ready for a vacation 
and planned to take Emmett with her, but after he begged her to visit Wright, 
she relented. Wright planned to accompany Till with a cousin, Wheeler Parker, 
and another, Curtis Jones, would join them soon. Wright was a sharecropper 
and part-time minister who was often called "Preacher".[13] He lived in 
Money, Mississippi, a small town in the Delta that consisted of three stores, 
a school, a post office, a cotton gin, and a couple hundred residents, 
8 miles (13 km) north of Greenwood. Before Emmett departed for the Delta, 
his mother cautioned him that Chicago and Mississippi were two different 
worlds, and he should know how to behave in front of whites in the South.[14] 
He assured her he understood.[15] Since 1882, when statistics on lynchings 
began to be collected, more than 500 African Americans had been killed 
by extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across 
the South.[16] Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; 
though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders 
still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial 
relationships (while indulging in affairs with black women) as a means 
to maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of sexual contact between 
black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A 
resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow mores was evident following 
World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal 
rights in the South.[17] Racial tensions increased further after the United 
States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to 
end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. 
Many segregationists believed the ruling would lead to interracial marriage. 
Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling, in the case of a Virginia 
county, closing all the public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions 
simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures 
to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, which they had been since the 
turn of the century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks 
forcefully from any semblance of social equality.[18] A week before Till 
arrived in Mississippi, a black activist named Lamar Smith was shot and 
killed in front of the county courthouse in Brookhaven for political organizing. 
Three white suspects were arrested, but they were soon released.[19] Till 
arrived in Money, Mississippi on August 21, 1955. On August 24, he and 
cousin Curtis Jones skipped church where his great-uncle Wright was preaching, 
joining some local boys as they went to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market 
to buy candy. The teenagers were children of sharecroppers and had been 
picking cotton all day. The market was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old 
Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old[20] wife Carolyn; it mostly served the local 
sharecropper population. Carolyn was alone in the store that day; her sister-in-law 
was in the rear of the store watching children. Jones left Till with the 
other boys while Jones played checkers across the street. According to 
Jones, the other boys reported that Till had a photograph of an integrated 
class at the school he attended in Chicago,[note 1] and Till bragged to 
the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed 
to a white girl in the picture, or referred to a picture of a white girl 
that had come with his new wallet,[21] and said she was his girlfriend. 
One or more of the local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant.[20] The facts 
of what took place in the store are still disputed. According to several 
versions, including comments from some of the kids standing outside the 
store when Till walked in,[22] Till may have wolf-whistled at Bryant.[23] 
A newspaper account following his disappearance stated that Till sometimes 
whistled to alleviate his stuttering.[24] His speech was sometimes unclear; 
his mother said he had particular difficulty with pronouncing "b" sounds, 
and he may have whistled to overcome problems asking for bubble gum.[25] 
According to other stories, Till may have grabbed Bryant's hand and asked 
her for a date, or said "Bye, baby" as he left the store,[12] or "You needn't 
be afraid of me, baby, I've been with white women before."[26] Bryant testified 
during the murder trial that Till grabbed her hand while she was stocking 
candy and said, "How about a date, baby?"[27] She said that after she freed 
herself from his grasp, the young man followed her to the cash register,[27] 
grabbed her waist and said, "What's the matter baby, can't you take it?"[27] 
Bryant said she freed herself, and Till said, "You needn't be afraid of 
me, baby,"[27] used "one 'unprintable' word"[27] and said "I've been with 
white women before."[27] Bryant also alleged that one of Till's companions 
came into the store, grabbed him by the arm, and ordered him to leave.[27] 
Till's cousin, Simeon Wright, writing about the incident decades later, 
challenged Carolyn Bryant's account.[28] Entering the store "less than 
a minute" after Till was left inside alone with Bryant,[28] Wright saw 
no inappropriate behavior and heard "no lecherous conversation."[28] Wright 
said Till "paid for his items and we left the store together."[28] The 
FBI noted in their 2006 investigation of the cold case that a second anonymous 
source, who was confirmed to have been in the store at the same time as 
Till and his cousin, supported Wright's account.[21] In any event, Bryant 
was allegedly so alarmed she ran outside to a car to retrieve a pistol 
from under the seat. Upon seeing her do this, the teenagers left immediately.[26] 
It was acknowledged that while Bryant was running to her car, Till whistled.[21] 
However, it is disputed whether Till whistled toward Carolyn or toward 
a checkers game that was occurring just across the street.[21] One of the 
other boys ran across the street to tell Curtis Jones what happened in 
the store. When the older man with whom Jones was playing checkers heard 
the story, he urged the boys to leave quickly, fearing violence. Bryant 
told others of the events at the store, and the story spread quickly. Jones 
and Till declined to tell his great-uncle Mose Wright, fearing they would 
get in trouble.[29] Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's 
husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and 
did not return home until August 27.[30] When Roy Bryant was told of what 
had happened, he aggressively questioned several young black men who entered 
the store. That evening, Bryant, with a black man named J. W. Washington, 
approached a young black man walking along a road. Bryant ordered Washington 
to seize the young man, put him in the back of a pickup truck, and took 
him to be identified by a companion of Carolyn's who had witnessed the 
episode with Till. Friends or parents vouched for the young men in Bryant's 
store, and Carolyn's companion denied that the young man Bryant and Washington 
seized was the one who had accosted her. Somehow, Bryant learned that the 
young man in the incident was from Chicago and was staying with Mose Wright.[note 
2] Several witnesses overheard Bryant and his 36-year-old half-brother 
John William "J. W." Milam discussing taking Till from his house.[31] In 
the early morning hours—between 2:00 am and 3:30 am—on August 28, 1955, 
Bryant, Milam, and another man (who may have been black) drove to Mose 
Wright's house. Milam was armed with a pistol and a flashlight. He asked 
Wright if he had three boys in the house from Chicago. Till shared a bed 
with another cousin; there were eight people in the small two-bedroom cabin. 
Milam asked Wright to take them to "the nigger who did the talking". When 
they asked Till if it was him, he replied, "Yeah", for which they threatened 
to shoot him and told him to get dressed.[12][32] The men threatened to 
kill Wright if he reported what he had seen. Till's great-aunt offered 
the men money, but they did not respond. They put Till in the back of a 
pickup truck and drove to a barn at the Clint Shurden Plantation in Drew. 
Till was pistol-whipped and placed in the bed of the pickup truck again 
and covered with a tarpaulin. Throughout the course of the night, Bryant, 
Milam, and witnesses recall their being in several locations with Till. 
According to some witnesses, they took Till to a shed behind Milam's home 
in the nearby town of Glendora, where they beat him again and tried to 
decide what to do. Witnesses recall between two and four white men and 
two and four black men who were either in or surrounding the pickup truck 
where Till was seated. Others passed by Milam's shed and heard someone 
being beaten. Accounts differ as to when Till was shot; either in Milam's 
shed or by the Tallahatchie River. The group drove with him in the truck 
to Bryant's store, where several people noticed blood pooling in the truck 
bed. Bryant explained he killed a deer, and in one instance showed the 
body to a black man who questioned him, saying "that's what happens to 
smart niggers".[33] Well, what else could we do? He was hopeless. I'm no 
bully; I never hurt a nigger in my life. I like niggers—in their place—I 
know how to work 'em. But I just decided it was time a few people got put 
on notice. As long as I live and can do anything about it, niggers are 
gonna stay in their place. Niggers ain't gonna vote where I live. If they 
did, they'd control the government. They ain't gonna go to school with 
my kids. And when a nigger gets close to mentioning sex with a white woman, 
he's tired o' livin'. I'm likely to kill him. Me and my folks fought for 
this country, and we got some rights. I stood there in that shed and listened 
to that nigger throw that poison at me, and I just made up my mind. 'Chicago 
boy,' I said, 'I'm tired of 'em sending your kind down here to stir up 
trouble. Goddam you, I'm going to make an example of you—just so everybody 
can know how me and my folks stand.' In an interview with William Bradford 
Huie, published in Look magazine in 1956, Bryant and Milam said they intended 
to beat Till and throw him off an embankment into the river to frighten 
him. They told Huie that while they were beating Till, he called them bastards, 
declared he was as good as they, and had had sexual encounters with white 
women. They put Till in the back of their truck, drove to a cotton gin 
to take a 70-pound (32 kg) fan—the only time they admitted to being worried, 
thinking that by this time in early daylight they would be spotted and 
accused of stealing—and drove for several miles along the river looking 
for a place to dispose of Till. They shot him by the river and weighted 
his body with the fan.[12][note 3] Mose Wright stayed on his front porch 
for twenty minutes waiting for Till to return. He did not go back to bed. 
He and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and drove around trying 
to find Till. Unsuccessful, they returned home by 8:00 am.[34] After hearing 
from Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his 
life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff and another 
to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie 
Till Bradley.[35] Wright and his wife also drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth 
Wright's brother contacted the sheriff.[36] Bryant and Milam were questioned 
by Leflore County sheriff George Smith. They admitted they had taken the 
boy from his great-uncle's yard but claimed they had released him the same 
night in front of Bryant's store. Bryant and Milam were arrested for kidnapping.[37] 
Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi 
state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People (NAACP) and Amzie Moore, head of the Bolivar County chapter, 
became involved. They disguised themselves as cotton pickers and went into 
the cotton fields in search of any information that might help find Till.[38] 
Three days after his abduction, Till's swollen and disfigured body was 
found by two boys fishing in the Tallahatchie River. His head was very 
badly damaged. He had been shot above the right ear, an eye was dislodged 
from the socket, there was evidence that he had been beaten on the back 
and the hips, and his body weighted by the fan blade, which was fastened 
around his neck with barbed wire. He was nude, but wearing a silver ring 
with the initials "L. T." and "May 25, 1943" carved in it.[39][note 4] 
Confusion about Till's whereabouts and a positive identification of the 
body retrieved from the river compounded issues in the case that eventually 
influenced the trial. Hodding Carter in the Delta Democrat-Times, a local 
Mississippi newspaper, reported that Till may have been hidden by his relatives 
or perhaps returned to Chicago for his safety.[40] The body's face was 
unrecognizable due to trauma and having been submerged in water. Mose Wright 
was called to the river and identified Till. The silver ring Till wore 
was removed and returned to Wright, and further passed to the district 
attorney. Stories from witnesses, both black and white, conflict about 
whether the ring was on Till's body and who knew he had worn it previously.[41] 
Although lynchings and racially motivated murders had occurred throughout 
the South for decades, the circumstances surrounding Emmett Till and the 
timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention to the case of 
a 14-year-old boy who had unknowingly defied a severe social caste system. 
Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations 
between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, the 
NAACP, White Citizens' Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were played 
out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.[42] When 
Till went missing, a three-paragraph story was printed in the Greenwood 
Commonwealth and quickly picked up by other Mississippi newspapers. They 
reported on his death when the body was found, and the next day, when a 
picture of him his mother had taken the previous Christmas showing them 
smiling together appeared in the Jackson Daily News and Vicksburg Evening 
Post, editorials and letters to the editor were printed expressing shame 
at the people who had caused Till's death. One read, "Now is the time for 
every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' 
before hoodlum white trash brings us to destruction." The letter said that 
Negroes were not the downfall of Mississippi society, but whites like those 
in White Citizens' Councils that condoned violence.[43] Till's body was 
clothed, packed in lime, and put in a pine coffin and prepared for burial. 
It may have been embalmed while in Mississippi. Mamie Till Bradley demanded 
that the body be sent to Chicago; she later said that she worked to halt 
an immediate burial in Mississippi and called several local and state authorities 
in Illinois and Mississippi to make sure that her son was returned to Chicago.[44] 
A doctor did not examine Till post-mortem.[45] Mississippi's governor, 
Hugh L. White, deplored the murder, asserting that local authorities should 
pursue a "vigorous prosecution". He sent a telegram to the national offices 
of the NAACP promising a full investigation and assuring them "Mississippi 
does not condone such conduct". Delta residents, both black and white, 
also distanced themselves from Till's murder, finding the circumstances 
abhorrent. Local newspaper editorials denounced the murderers without question.[26][46] 
Leflore County Deputy Sheriff John Cothran stated, "The white people around 
here feel pretty mad about the way that poor little boy was treated, and 
they won't stand for this."[47] Soon, however, discourse about Till's murder 
became more complex. Robert B. Patterson, executive secretary of the segregationist 
White Citizens' Council, lamented Till's death by reiterating that racial 
segregation policies were in force for blacks' safety and that their efforts 
were being neutralized by the NAACP. In response, NAACP executive secretary 
Roy Wilkins characterized the incident as a lynching and said that Mississippi 
was trying to maintain white supremacy through murder. He said, "there 
is in the entire state no restraining influence of decency, not in the 
state capital, among the daily newspapers, the clergy, nor any segment 
of the so-called better citizens".[48] Mamie Till Bradley told a reporter 
that she would seek legal aid to help law enforcement find her son's killers 
and that the State of Mississippi should share the financial responsibility. 
She was misquoted; it came out as "Mississippi is going to pay for this".[49] 
The A. A. Rayner Funeral Home in Chicago received Till's body. Upon arrival, 
Bradley insisted on viewing it to make a positive identification, later 
stating that the stench from it was noticeable two blocks away.[50] She 
decided to have an open-casket funeral, saying, "There was just no way 
I could describe what was in that box. No way. And I just wanted the world 
to see."[38] Tens of thousands of people lined the street outside the mortuary 
to view Till's body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral 
at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ. Photographs of his mutilated 
corpse circulated around the country, notably appearing in Jet magazine 
and The Chicago Defender, both black publications, and drew intense public 
reaction. According to The Nation and Newsweek, Chicago's black community 
was "aroused as it has not been over any similar act in recent history".[51][note 
5] Till was buried on September 6 in Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. 
News about Emmett Till spread to both coasts. Chicago Mayor Richard J. 
Daley and Illinois Governor William Stratton also became involved, urging 
Governor White to see that justice be done. The tone in Mississippi newspapers 
changed dramatically. They falsely reported riots in the funeral home in 
Chicago. Bryant and Milam appeared in photos smiling in military uniforms[52] 
and Carolyn Bryant's beauty and virtue were extolled. Rumors of an invasion 
of outraged blacks and northern whites were printed throughout the state 
so that the Leflore County sheriff took them seriously. Local businessman, 
surgeon, and civil rights proponent T. R. M. Howard, one of the wealthiest 
blacks in the state, warned of a "second civil war" if "slaughtering of 
Negroes" was allowed.[53] Following Wilkins' comments, white opinion began 
to shift. According to historian Stephen Whitfield, a specific brand of 
xenophobia in the South was particularly strong in Mississippi, urging 
whites to reject the influence of Northern opinion and agitation.[54] This 
independent attitude was profound enough in Tallahatchie County that it 
earned the nickname "The Freestate of Tallahatchie", according to a former 
sheriff, "because people here do what they damn well please", making the 
county often difficult to govern.[55] Tallahatchie County Sheriff Clarence 
Strider, who initially positively identified Till's body and stated that 
the case against Milam and Bryant was "pretty good", on September 3 announced 
his doubts that the body pulled from the Tallahatchie River was that of 
Till, who, he speculated, was probably still alive. Strider suggested that 
the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T. R. M. Howard, 
who colluded to place Till's ring on it.[56] Strider changed his account 
after the comments made in the press about the people of Mississippi, later 
saying, "The last thing I wanted to do was to defend those peckerwoods. 
But I just had no choice about it."[26][note 6] Bryant and Milam were indicted 
for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was 
not confident that he could get a conviction in a case of white violence 
against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black 
paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did 
the New York Times. The high-profile comments made in Northern newspapers 
and by the NAACP concerned the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he 
worried that his office would not be able to secure a guilty verdict, despite 
their compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially 
had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys 
at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono.[54] Collection jars 
were placed in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually 
gathering $10,000 for the defense.[57] The town of Sumner in Tallahatchie 
County served as the venue for the trial as the body had been found there. 
Sumner had one boarding house; the small town was besieged by reporters 
from all over the country. David Halberstam called it "the first great 
media event of the civil rights movement".[58] A reporter who had covered 
the trials of Bruno Hauptmann and Machine Gun Kelly remarked that this 
was the most publicity for any trial he had ever seen.[26] No hotels were 
available for black visitors. Mamie Till Bradley arrived to testify and 
the trial also attracted black congressman Charles Diggs from Michigan. 
Bradley, Diggs, and several black reporters stayed at Howard's home in 
Mound Bayou. Located on a large lot and surrounded by Howard's armed guards, 
it resembled a compound. The day before the start of the trial, a young 
black man named Frank Young arrived to tell Howard he knew of two witnesses 
to the crime. Levi "Too Tight" Collins and Henry Lee Loggins were black 
employees of Leslie Milam, J. W.'s brother, in whose shed Till was beaten. 
Collins and Loggins were spotted with J. W. Milam, Bryant, and Till. The 
prosecution team was unaware of Collins and Loggins. Sheriff Strider, however, 
booked them into the Charleston, Mississippi jail to keep them from testifying.[59] 
The trial was held in September 1955, lasting for five days; and attendees 
remember the weather being very hot. The courtroom was filled to its 280-spectator 
capacity, and as a matter of course was racially segregated.[60] Press 
from major national newspapers attended, including black publications; 
black reporters were made to sit segregated from the white press, farther 
from the jury. Sheriff Strider welcomed black spectators coming back from 
lunch with a cheerful, "Hello, Niggers!"[61] Some visitors from the North 
found the court to be run with surprising informality. Jury members were 
allowed to drink beer on duty, and many white men in the audience wore 
handguns holstered to their belts.[62] The defense's primary strategy was 
arguing that the body pulled from the river could not be positively identified, 
and they questioned whether Till was dead at all. The defense asserted 
that Bryant and Milam had taken Till, but had let him go. They attempted 
to prove that Mose Wright—who was addressed as "Uncle Mose" by the prosecution 
and "Mose" by the defense—could not identify Bryant and Milam as the men 
who took Till from his cabin. Only Milam's flashlight was in use, and no 
other lights in the house were turned on. Milam and Bryant identified themselves 
to Wright the evening they took Till—the third man did not speak—but Wright 
only saw Milam clearly. Wright's testimony was considered remarkably courageous 
and a first in the state for a black man implicating the guilt of a white 
man in court. Journalist James Hicks, who worked for the black news wire 
service, the National Negro Publishers Association, (later renamed the 
National Newspaper Publishers Association), was present in the courtroom; 
he was especially impressed that Wright stood to identify Milam, pointing 
to him and saying "Thar he" (There he is),[note 7] calling it a historic 
moment and one filled with "electricity".[65] A writer for the New York 
Post noted that following his identification, Wright sat "with a lurch 
which told better than anything else the cost in strength to him of the 
thing he had done".[66] A reporter who covered the trial for the New Orleans 
Times-Picayune stated it was "the most dramatic thing I saw in my career".[67] 
Mamie Till Bradley testified that she instructed her son to watch his manners 
in Mississippi and that should a situation ever come to his being asked 
to get on his knees to ask forgiveness of a white person, he should do 
it without a thought. The defense questioned her identification of her 
son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken 
out on him.[68] While the trial progressed, Leflore County Sheriff George 
Smith, Howard, and several reporters, both black and white, attempted to 
locate Collins and Loggins. They could not, but found three witnesses who 
had seen Collins and Loggins with Milam and Bryant on Leslie Milam's property. 
Two of them testified that they heard someone being beaten, blows, and 
cries.[68] One testified so quietly the judge ordered him several times 
to speak louder; he said he heard the victim call out, "Mama, Lord have 
mercy. Lord have mercy."[69] Judge Curtis Swango allowed Carolyn Bryant 
to testify, but not in front of the jury, after the prosecution objected 
that her testimony was irrelevant to Till's abduction and murder. It may 
have been leaked in any case to the jury. Sheriff Strider testified for 
the defense his theory that Till was alive, and that the body retrieved 
from the river was white. A doctor from Greenwood stated on the stand that 
the body was too decomposed to identify, and therefore had been in the 
water too long for it to be Till.[70] In the concluding statements, one 
prosecuting attorney admitted that what Till did was wrong, but it warranted 
a spanking, not murder. Gerald Chatham passionately called for justice 
and mocked the sheriff and doctor's statements that alluded to a conspiracy. 
Mamie Bradley indicated she was very impressed with his summation.[71] 
The defense stated that the prosecution's theory of the events the night 
Till was murdered were improbable, and said the jury's "forefathers would 
turn over in their graves" if they convicted Bryant and Milam. Only three 
outcomes were possible in Mississippi for capital murder: life imprisonment, 
the death penalty, or acquittal. On September 23 the all-white jury acquitted 
both defendants after a 67-minute deliberation; one juror said, "If we 
hadn't stopped to drink pop, it wouldn't have taken that long."[72] In 
post-trial analyses, blame for the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was 
criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have 
been picked almost exclusively from the hill country section of Tallahatchie 
County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks 
competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population 
living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore 
County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian 
Stephen Whitaker, those in the eastern part of the county were virulent 
in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential 
juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote 
to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone 
who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them.[26][71] 
One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced 
and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit.[73] In later interviews, 
the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but 
simply did not believe life imprisonment or the death penalty fit punishment 
for whites who had killed a black man.[74] This is somewhat disputed by 
later interviews with two jurors who stated as late as 2005 that they believed 
the defense's case, that the prosecution had not proven that Till had died, 
nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.[73] In November 
1955, a grand jury declined to indict Bryant and Milam for kidnapping, 
despite the testimony given that they had admitted taking Till. Mose Wright 
and a young man named Willie Reed, who testified to seeing Milam enter 
the shed from which screams and blows were heard, both testified in front 
of the grand jury.[75] T. R. M. Howard after the trial paid to relocate 
to Chicago Wright, Reed, and another black witness who testified against 
Milam and Bryant, to protect them from reprisal for testifying.[71] Reed, 
who later changed his name to Willie Louis to avoid being found, continued 
to live in the Chicago area until his death on July 18, 2013. He avoided 
publicity and kept his history secret from his wife until she was told 
by a relative. Reed began to speak publicly about the case in the PBS documentary 
The Murder of Emmett Till in 2003.[76] Reactions from newspapers in major 
international cities and Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and socialist publications 
were furious about the verdict and very critical of American society. Southern 
newspapers, particularly in Mississippi, wrote that the court system had 
done its job.[77] Till's story continued to make news for weeks following 
the trial, especially sparking debate between Southern, Northern, and black 
newspapers, the NAACP and various high-profile segregationists about justice 
for blacks and the propriety of Jim Crow society. In October 1955, the 
Jackson Daily News reported facts about Till's father that had been suppressed 
by the U.S. military. While serving in Italy, Louis Till raped two women 
and killed a third. He was court-martialed and hanged by the Army near 
Pisa in July 1945. Mamie Till Bradley and her family knew none of this, 
having been told only that Louis had been killed for "willful misconduct". 
Mississippi senators James Eastland and John C. Stennis probed Army records 
to uncover Louis Till's crimes. Although Emmett Till's murder trial was 
over, news about his father remained on the front pages of Mississippi 
newspapers for weeks in October and November 1955, further engaging debate 
about Emmett Till's actions and Carolyn Bryant's integrity. Stephen Whitfield 
writes that the lack of attention paid to identifying or finding Till is 
"strange" compared to the amount of published discourse about his father.[78] 
Emmett Till's urges, to white Mississippians, were genetic instincts that 
were violently expressed by his father Louis Till. According to historians 
Davis Houck and Matthew Grindy, "Louis Till became a most important rhetorical 
pawn in the high-stakes game of north versus south, black versus white, 
NAACP versus White Citizens' Councils".[79] Protected against double jeopardy, 
Bryant and Milam struck a deal with Look magazine in 1956 to tell their 
story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. 
The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended 
Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own 
attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the 
murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and 
sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till 
and neither of them thought of themselves as guilty or that they had done 
anything wrong.[80] Reaction to Huie's interview with Bryant and Milam 
was explosive. Their brazen admission that they had slain Till caused prominent 
civil rights leaders to push the federal government harder to investigate 
the case. Till's murder was one of several reasons the Civil Rights Act 
of 1957 was passed; it allowed the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene 
in local law enforcement issues when civil rights were being compromised.[26] 
Huie's interview, in which he said that Milam and Bryant had acted alone, 
overshadowed inconsistencies in earlier versions of the stories. Details 
about Collins and Loggins and anyone else who had possibly been involved 
in Till's abduction, murder, or the clean-up of it, were, according to 
historians David and Linda Beito, forgotten.[81][note 8] If the facts as 
stated in the Look magazine account of the Till affair are correct, this 
remains: two adults, armed, in the dark, kidnap a fourteen-year-old boy 
and take him away to frighten him. Instead of which, the fourteen-year-old 
boy not only refuses to be frightened, but, unarmed, alone, in the dark, 
so frightens the two armed adults that they must destroy him.... What are 
we Mississippians afraid of? The story of Emmett Till began to seep into 
the consciousness of Americans through media and literature. Langston Hughes 
dedicated an untitled poem (eventually to be known as "Mississippi—1955") 
to Till in his October 1, 1955 column in The Chicago Defender. It was reprinted 
across the country and continued to be republished with various changes 
from different writers.[83] Author William Faulkner, a prominent Mississippi 
native who often focused on racial issues, wrote two essays on Till: one 
before the trial in which he pleaded for American unity and one after, 
a piece titled "On Fear" that was published in Harper's in 1956. In it 
he questioned why the tenets of segregation were based on irrational reasoning.[82] 
Till's murder was the focus of a 1957 television episode for the U.S. Steel 
Hour titled "Noon on Doomsday" written by Rod Serling, who was fascinated 
by how quickly Mississippi whites supported Bryant and Milam. Although 
the script was rewritten to avoid mention of Till, and did not say that 
the murder victim was black, White Citizens' Councils vowed to boycott 
U.S. Steel. The eventual episode bore little resemblance to the Till case.[84] 
Gwendolyn Brooks wrote a poem titled "A Bronzeville Mother Loiters in Mississippi. 
Meanwhile, A Mississippi Mother Burns Bacon" (1960). The same year Harper 
Lee published To Kill a Mockingbird, in which a white attorney is committed 
to defending a black man named Tom Robinson, accused of raping a white 
woman. Lee, whose novel had a profound effect on civil rights, never publicly 
stated Robinson's origins. Literature professor Patrick Chura notes several 
compelling similarities between Till's case and that of Robinson.[85] Writer 
James Baldwin loosely based his 1964 drama Blues for Mister Charlie on 
the Till case. He later divulged that Till's murder had been bothering 
him for several years.[86] Bob Dylan recorded a song titled "The Death 
of Emmett Till" in 1962. Till was mentioned in the 1968 autobiography of 
Anne Moody, Coming of Age in Mississippi, in which she states she first 
learned to hate during the fall of 1955.[87] Audre Lorde's poem "Afterimages" 
(1981) focuses on the perspective of a black woman thinking of Carolyn 
Bryant 24 years after the murder and trial. Bebe Moore Campbell's 1992 
novel Your Blues Ain't Like Mine centers on the events of Till's death. 
Toni Morrison's only play as of 2010 is Dreaming Emmett (1986), a feminist 
look at the roles of men and women in black society, which she was inspired 
to write while considering "time through the eyes of one person who could 
come back to life and seek vengeance".[88] Emmylou Harris includes a song 
called "My Name is Emmett Till" on her 2011 album, Hard Bargain. According 
to scholar Christopher Metress, Till is often reconfigured in literature 
as a specter that haunts the white people of Mississippi, causing them 
to question their involvement in evil, or silence about injustice.[86] 
The 2002 book Mississippi Trials, 1955 is a fictionalized account of Till's 
death. After Bryant and Milam admitted to Huie that they had killed Till, 
their support base in Mississippi eroded.[89] Many of their former friends 
and supporters, including those who had contributed to their defense funds, 
cut them off. Their shops went bankrupt and closed after blacks boycotted 
them, and banks refused them loans to plant crops.[26] After struggling 
to secure a loan and find someone who would rent to him, Milam managed 
to secure 217 acres and a $4,000 loan to plant cotton, but blacks refused 
to work for him. He was forced to pay whites higher wages.[90] Eventually, 
Milam and Bryant relocated to Texas, but their infamy followed them, and 
they continued to generate extreme animosity from locals. After several 
years, they returned to Mississippi.[note 9] Milam found work as a heavy 
equipment operator, but ill health forced him into retirement. Over the 
years, Milam was tried for offenses such as assault and battery, writing 
bad checks, and using a stolen credit card. He died of spinal cancer in 
1980, at the age of 61.[91] Bryant worked as a welder while in Texas, until 
increasing blindness forced him to give up this employment. At some point, 
he and Carolyn divorced; he remarried in 1980. He opened a store in Ruleville, 
Mississippi, and was convicted in 1984 and 1988 of food stamp fraud. In 
a 1985 interview, he denied that he had killed Till, but said: "if Emmett 
Till hadn't got out of line, it probably wouldn't have happened to him." 
Fearing economic boycotts and retaliation, Bryant lived a private life 
and refused to allow himself to be photographed or reveal the exact location 
of his store, explaining: "this new generation is different and I don't 
want to worry about a bullet some dark night".[92] He died of cancer in 
1994, at the age of 63.[93] Till's mother married Gene Mobley, became a 
teacher, and changed her surname to Till-Mobley. She continued her life 
as an activist working to educate people about her son's murder. In 1992, 
Till-Mobley had the opportunity to listen while Bryant was interviewed 
about his involvement in Till's murder. With Bryant unaware that Till-Mobley 
was listening, he asserted that Till had ruined his life, expressed no 
remorse, and said, "Emmett Till is dead. I don't know why he can't just 
stay dead."[94] In 1996, documentary filmmaker Keith Beauchamp, who was 
greatly moved by Till's open-casket photograph,[58] started background 
research for a feature film he planned to make about Till's murder. He 
asserted that as many as 14 people may have been involved, including Carolyn 
Bryant Donham (who had remarried). Mose Wright heard someone with "a lighter 
voice" affirm that Till was the one in his front yard immediately before 
Bryant and Milam drove away with the boy. Beauchamp spent the next nine 
years producing The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till, released in 2003. 
That same year, PBS aired an installment of American Experience titled 
The Murder of Emmett Till. In 2005, CBS journalist Ed Bradley aired a 60 
Minutes report investigating the Till murder, part of which showed him 
tracking down Carolyn Bryant at her home in Greenville, Mississippi.[95] 
A 1991 book written by Stephen Whitfield, another by Christopher Metress 
in 2002, and Mamie Till-Mobley's memoirs the next year all posed questions 
as to who was involved in the murder and cover-up, leading federal authorities 
to try to resolve the questions about the identity of the body pulled from 
the Tallahatchie River.[96] In 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice announced 
that it was reopening the case to determine whether anyone other than Milam 
and Bryant was involved.[97] David T. Beito, a professor at the University 
of Alabama, states that Till's murder "has this mythic quality like the 
Kennedy assassination".[67] It was one of a number of cold cases dating 
to the Civil Rights era that Justice was investigating. The body was exhumed 
and an autopsy conducted by the Cook County coroner in 2005. Using DNA 
from Till's relatives, dental comparisons to images taken of Till, and 
anthropological analysis, the body exhumed was positively identified as 
Till's. It had extensive cranial damage, a broken left femur, and two broken 
wrists. Metallic fragments were found in the skull consistent with being 
shot with a .45 caliber gun.[98] In February 2007, a Leflore County grand 
jury, composed primarily of black jurors and empaneled by Joyce Chiles, 
a black prosecutor, found no credible basis for Beauchamp's claim that 
14 people took part in Till's abduction and murder. Beauchamp was angry 
with the finding, but David Beito and Juan Williams, who worked on the 
reading materials for the Eyes on the Prize documentary, were critical 
of Beauchamp for trying to revise history and taking attention away from 
other cold cases.[99] The grand jury failed to find sufficient cause for 
charges against Carolyn Bryant Donham. Neither the FBI nor the grand jury 
found any credible evidence that Henry Lee Loggins, identified by Beauchamp 
as a suspect who could be charged, had any role in the crime. Other than 
Loggins, Beauchamp refused to name any of the people he alleged were involved.[67] 
In October 2016, the sign marking the site where Till's body was found 
was shot at by unknown persons, leaving it riddled with more than 40 bullet 
holes.[100] Somehow [Till's death and trial] struck a spark of indignation 
that ignited protests around the world... It was the murder of this 14-year-old 
out-of-state visitor that touched off a world-wide clamor and cast the 
glare of a world spotlight on Mississippi's racism. Through the constant 
attention it received, Till's case became emblematic of the disparity of 
justice for blacks in the South. In 1955 The Chicago Defender urged its 
readers to react to the acquittal by voting in large numbers, a reminder 
that most blacks in the South had been disfranchised since the turn of 
the century under laws passed by white Democrat-dominated legislatures.[102] 
Myrlie Evers, widow of Medgar Evers, stated in 1985 that Till's case resonated 
so strongly because it "shook the foundations of Mississippi—both black 
and white, because...with the white community...it had become nationally 
publicized...with us as blacks...it said, even a child was not safe from 
racism and bigotry and death."[103] The NAACP asked Mamie Till Bradley 
to tour the country relating the events of her son's life, death, and the 
trial of his murderers. It was one of the most successful fundraising campaigns 
the NAACP had ever known.[104] Journalist Louis Lomax acknowledges Till's 
death to be the start of what he terms the "Negro revolt" and scholar Clenora 
Hudson-Weems characterizes Till as a "sacrificial lamb" for civil rights. 
NAACP operative Amzie Moore considers Till the start of the Civil Rights 
Movement, at the very least, in Mississippi.[105] The 1987 14-hour Emmy 
award-winning documentary Eyes on the Prize begins with the murder of Emmett 
Till. Accompanying written materials for the series, Eyes on the Prize 
and Voices of Freedom (for the second time period) exhaustively encompass 
the major figures and events of the Civil Rights Movement. Furthermore, 
Stephen Whitaker states, as a result of the attention Till's death and 
the trial received, Mississippi became in the eyes of the nation the epitome 
of racism and the citadel of white supremacy. From this time on, the slightest 
racial incident anywhere in the state was spotlighted and magnified. To 
the Negro race throughout the South and to some extent in other parts of 
the country, this verdict indicated an end to the system of noblesse oblige. 
The faith in the white power structure waned rapidly. Negro faith in legalism 
declined, and the revolt officially began on December 1, 1955, with the 
Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott.[26] In Montgomery, Rosa Parks refused 
to give up her seat to a white bus rider, sparking a year-long well-organized 
grassroots boycott of the public bus system, designed to force the city 
to change its segregation policies. Parks later said when she did not get 
up and move to the rear of the bus, "I thought of Emmett Till and I just 
couldn't go back."[106] According to author Clayborne Carson, Till's death 
and the widespread coverage of the students integrating Little Rock Central 
High School in 1957 were especially profound for younger blacks: "It was 
out of this festering discontent and an awareness of earlier isolated protests 
that the sit-ins of the 1960s were born."[107] After seeing pictures of 
Till's mutilated body, in Louisville, Kentucky, young Cassius Clay (later 
famed boxer Muhammad Ali) and a friend took out their frustration by vandalizing 
a local railyard, causing a locomotive engine to derail.[108][109] It is 
thought that Till's story influenced Harper Lee to create the character 
Tom Robinson in her novel To Kill A Mockingbird.[110] In 1963, Sunflower 
County resident Fannie Lou Hamer, herself a sharecropper, was jailed and 
beaten for attempting to register to vote. The next year, she led a massive 
voter registration drive in the Delta region, and volunteers worked on 
Freedom Summer throughout the state. Before 1954, 265 black people were 
registered to vote in three Delta counties, where they were a majority; 
they made up 41% of the total state population. The summer Emmett Till 
was killed, the number of registered voters in those three counties dropped 
to 90. By the end of 1955, fourteen Mississippi counties had no registered 
black voters.[111] The Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964 registered 63,000 
black voters in a simplified process administered by the project; they 
formed their own political party because they were closed out of the Democratic 
Regulars in Mississippi.[112] The story of Emmett Till is one of the most 
important of the last half of the 20th century. And an important element 
was the casket.... It is an object that allows us to tell the story, to 
feel the pain and understand loss. I want people to feel like I did. I 
want people to feel the complexity of emotions. Till continues to be the 
focus of literature and memorials. A statue was unveiled in Denver in 1976 
(and has since been moved to Pueblo, Colorado) featuring Till with Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Till was included among the forty names of people who 
had died in the Civil Rights Movement (listed as martyrs[114]) on the granite 
sculpture of the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, dedicated 
in 1989. In 1991, a 7-mile (11 km) stretch of 71st Street in Chicago, was 
renamed "Emmett Till Road". Mamie Till-Mobley attended many of the dedications 
for the memorials, including a demonstration in Selma, Alabama on the 35th 
anniversary of the march over the Edmund Pettis Bridge. She later wrote 
in her memoirs, "I realized that Emmett had achieved the significant impact 
in death that he had been denied in life. Even so, I had never wanted Emmett 
to be a martyr. I only wanted him to be a good son. Although I realized 
all the great things that had been accomplished largely because of the 
sacrifices made by so many people, I found myself wishing that somehow 
we could have done it another way."[115] Till-Mobley died in 2003, the 
same year her memoirs were published. James McCosh Elementary School in 
Chicago, where Till had been a student, was renamed the "Emmett Louis Till 
Math And Science Academy" in 2005.[116] The "Emmett Till Memorial Highway" 
was dedicated between Greenwood and Tutwiler, Mississippi, the same route 
his body took to the train station on its way to Chicago. It intersects 
with the H. C. "Clarence" Strider Memorial Highway.[117] In 2007, Tallahatchie 
County issued a formal apology to Till's family, reading "We the citizens 
of Tallahatchie County recognize that the Emmett Till case was a terrible 
miscarriage of justice. We state candidly and with deep regret the failure 
to effectively pursue justice. We wish to say to the family of Emmett Till 
that we are profoundly sorry for what was done in this community to your 
loved one."[118] The same year, Georgia congressman John Lewis, whose skull 
was fractured while being beaten during the 1965 Selma march, sponsored 
a bill that provides a plan for investigating and prosecuting unsolved 
Civil Rights era murders. The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act 
was signed into law in 2008.[119] On July 9, 2009, a manager and three 
laborers at Burr Oak Cemetery were charged with digging up bodies, dumping 
them in a remote area, and reselling the plots. Till's grave was not disturbed, 
but investigators found his original glass-topped casket rusting in a dilapidated 
storage shed.[120] When Till was reburied in a new casket in 2005, there 
were plans for an Emmett Till memorial museum, where his original casket 
would be installed. The cemetery manager, who administered the memorial 
fund, pocketed donations intended for the memorial. It is unclear how much 
money was collected. Cemetery officials also neglected the casket, which 
was discolored, the interior fabric torn, and bore evidence that animals 
had been living in it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's 
National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, 
D.C. acquired the casket a month later. According to director Lonnie Bunch 
III, it is an artifact with potential to stop future visitors and make 
them think.[113] Fictionalized accounts of Till and the ensuing events
