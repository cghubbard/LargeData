Hilton Lee Smith (February 27, 1907[1] â€“ November 18, 1983) was an American 
right-handed pitcher in Negro league baseball. He pitched alongside Satchel 
Paige for the Kansas City Monarchs between 1932 and 1948. In 2001 he was 
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Born in Giddings, Texas, 
Smith began his career in black baseball's equivalent of the minor leagues 
with the Austin Black Senators in Austin, Texas. Smith made the dean's 
list as a student at Prairie View A&M College in 1928 and 1929. He was 
an outfielder in his first college season and a pitcher in his second year.[2] 
His big league debut was with the Monroe Monarchs of Monroe, Louisiana 
in 1932. In 1934, Smith wed Louise Humphrey. They had two children.[3] 
From 1935 to 1936, Smith pitched for the Bismarck semi-professional team 
organized by Neil Churchill. In 1935 his teammates included Satchel Paige, 
Ted "Double Duty" Radcliffe, Quincy Trouppe, Barney Morris, and Chet Brewer. 
In August, the team won the national semipro championship in Wichita, Kansas. 
In 1936, Paige, Radcliffe, and Brewer departed and Smith became the ace 
of the Bismarck team. They returned to the national championship, where 
Smith won four games, but Bismarck failed to repeat as champions.[4] In 
late 1936 Smith signed with the Kansas City Monarchs. From 1937 until his 
retirement in 1948 Smith was a star pitcher on the Monarchs. He possessed 
an outstanding curveball, but he was overshadowed by his more flamboyant 
teammate Satchel Paige. Often Paige would pitch the first three innings 
of a game, leaving Smith to pitch the remaining six. Also, unlike Paige, 
Smith was a very good hitter. After retiring from baseball, Hilton Smith 
worked as a schoolteacher and later as a steel plant foreman. He also scouted 
for the Chicago Cubs. Smith had a quiet, reserved temperament, but in his 
later years he stood up for Negro leaguers in their struggle to be inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He died in 1983 in Kansas City, Missouri. 
It was not until 2001 that he became a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.
