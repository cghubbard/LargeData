Northport is a historic maritime village located within the Town of Huntington 
on Long Island, New York. Initially designated as Great Cow Harbour by 
17th-century English colonists and officially renamed Northport in 1837. 
In 1898 Northport incorporated itself as a village for the purpose of localizing 
governance. Northport is known for its Victorian era village center, still 
bearing trolley rails from a long since discontinued streetcar which would 
transport village residents to the Long Island Rail Road station in East 
Northport. The village Main Street runs from the Village Green along the 
harbor-front to the former hamlet of Vernon Valley, which has since been 
subsumed by the neighboring community of East Northport. As of 2010, the 
village has a population of around 7,401[1] and is served by the Northport-East 
Northport School District. The original inhabitants of the area now known 
as Northport were the Matinecocks, one of 13 Native American tribes of 
Long Island. The Matinecocks called this land Opcathontyche, which meant 
"wading place creek".[2] After Dutch interest a few years earlier, the 
land was sold by Chief Asharoken, head of the Matinecocks, to three Englishmen 
in 1656.[3] With land that was well suited for farming, the early settlers 
grazed cattle on pastures around the harbor. The area soon became known 
as Great Cow Harbour.[4] (The nearby hamlet of Centerport was known as 
Little Cow Harbour.) The oldest house still standing in Northport, the 
Skidmore House on Main Street, was built in 1761. In 2009 the house was 
put up for sale, sparking the village to pass a historical preservation 
law.[5] In the early 19th century Great Cow Harbor was still a rural farming 
community. By the 1830s the village contained only eight dwellings.[6] 
But a new industry of shipbuilding brought rapid change and growth. The 
village shifted away from its farming roots as shipbuilding became the 
community's primary industry. By 1837 the village was being referred to 
as Northport.[2] The 1860 census listed Northport's population at 1,016. 
By 1874 it had become the most flourishing village on Suffolk County's 
north shore, with three ship yards, five sets of marine railways, two hotels, 
and at least six general stores.[6] Northport's shipbuilding boom lasted 
fifty years but waned at the end of the century as steel-hulled ships began 
replacing the wooden vessels produced in the village.[2] On April 25, 1868, 
the Long Island Rail Road opened a station within the village of Northport.[7] 
This was an essential transportation link for the village, especially for 
the growing commuter population. However, just a few years later the LIRR 
decided to move the Northport station to a new location in Larkfield to 
facilitate further railway extension to Port Jefferson. The new railway 
station located on Larkfield Road was opened on January 13, 1873,[8] and 
retained the station name of Northport. To avoid confusion with the former 
station located in the village of Northport, train conductors would refer 
to the station in Larkfield as "East of Northport" because the station 
was located east of the Northport railway junction which directed trains 
north to the station located in the village. Despite the fact that Larkfield 
was primarily south of Northport, the area became known thereafter as East 
Northport.[9] The original rail spur to Northport would then be known as 
the Northport Branch. After the old bypassed village station closed in 
1899, Northport decided to build a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) trolley line to take 
commuters between Main Street and the new Northport station located in 
Larkfield. The new commuter trolley opened in mid-April 1902. The trolley 
would eventually become obsolete with the increasing popularity of the 
automobile, and the trolley made its last scheduled commuter run on August 
19, 1924.[10] Although it was known by the name of Northport since at least 
1837, the village of Northport was not formally incorporated until 1894,[4] 
becoming the first village in the Town of Huntington to do so.[2] Over 
the years Northport has expanded from its original borders, annexing other 
established communities. Around the Revolutionary War, a concentration 
of 31 families began settling 1.5 miles (2.4 km) east of Northport, around 
where Main Street and Route 25A now intersect 40°53′58″N 73°19′47″W﻿ / 
﻿40.8995°N 73.3296°W﻿ / 40.8995; -73.3296. This settlement was originally 
known as Red Hook[2] and changed names to Vernon Valley in 1820.[4] By 
1874 Vernon Valley had a population of around 150 inhabitants.[6] Vernon 
Valley became part of Northport in the mid-20th century.[6][11] Northport 
also annexed the formerly independent settlement of Crab Meadow 40°55′15″N 
73°19′13″W﻿ / ﻿40.9207°N 73.3202°W﻿ / 40.9207; -73.3202[12] (also known 
as Great Neck[13]), as well as western parts of the Freshpond community 
40°55′21″N 73°17′47″W﻿ / ﻿40.9224°N 73.2965°W﻿ / 40.9224; -73.2965. By 
the 1920s, after nearly a century of heavy commercial use, the waterfront 
which had supported the community for generations had fallen into decay. 
The village decided to purchase the land along the harbor and created Northport 
Memorial Park in 1932, which is a defining feature of Northport today.[2] 
In 1967, the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) opened the Northport 
Power Station, currently the largest oil-fired electric generating station 
on the East Coast.[14] The four enormous stacks are a well-known landmark 
that can be seen from as far away as Connecticut across Long Island Sound. 
Each stack is 600 feet (180 m) tall.[15] The Northport Trolley which had 
ceased operations in 1924 enjoyed a popular revival in the 1970s and 1980s, 
transporting weekend tourists along Main Street. Unlike the original electric 
trolleys, this nostalgic replica was horse driven. It also ran on rubber 
automobile tires rather than utilizing the original rails which still remain 
a visible element of Main Street to this day. In July 1984, Northport garnered 
nationwide media attention for being the site of the gruesome murder of 
17-year-old Gary Lauwers by his friend, high school dropout and alleged 
devil-worshiper Ricky Kasso. The events made national headlines and have 
since been recounted in books[16] and movies,[17] which caused the village 
to suffer a negative reputation for reputed satanism.[17] Every September 
the village of Northport commemorates its rich history with the celebration 
of Cow Harbor Day, which follows the annual Great Cow Harbor 10K race. 
Northport is located at 40°54′10″N 73°20′39″W﻿ / ﻿40.90278°N 73.34417°W﻿ 
/ 40.90278; -73.34417 (40.902803, -73.344069).[18] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 2.5 square miles 
(6.5 km2), of which 2.3 square miles (6.0 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles 
(0.52 km2), or 9.02%, is water. Most of the village is made up of the low, 
steep hills of Long Island's northern terminal moraine. To the west is 
the highly sheltered Northport Harbor, to the north is Long Island Sound, 
and to the east are woods and marshland. A prominent feature of Northport 
is Steer's Pit (known simply as "The Pit" to locals[2]), a large land depression 
carved into the cliffs adjacent to Northport Harbor and just south of the 
enormous LIPA smokestacks. This unusual geographic feature is the result 
of sand mining operations by the Steers and Steers Company. Mining began 
in 1923 and ceased in the 1950s.[19] The mined sand was shipped by barge 
to New York City where, mixed with Portland cement and rock aggregate, 
it became the sidewalks of New York.[citation needed] The area has since 
been utilized for home and condo use, and a portion of the Pit is a park 
used by local youth soccer and baseball leagues. The Northport Fire Department 
maintains a training facility in the Pit that is the site of the annual 
firemen fair in the summer. As of the census[22] of 2010, there were 7,753 
people, 2,955 households, and 2,074 families residing in the village. The
