The 1980 New York Mets season was the 19th regular season for the Mets, 
who played home games at Shea Stadium. Led by manager Joe Torre, the team 
had a 67â€“95 record and finished in fifth place in the National League East. 
On January 24, 1980, ownership of the team changed hands. The group that 
bought the Mets for an estimated $22 million (the largest amount ever paid 
for a ball club to that point) was headed by Nelson Doubleday, Jr. and 
Fred Wilpon. Doubleday was head of the old and distinguished publishing 
company that bore his name, while Wilpon was a highly successful real-estate 
developer. The new owners promised to spend money to get winning players 
and to make the club competitive,[1] but it would take years before the 
new partners were able to tear down their club and rebuild a contender. 
Hired as architect of this rebuilding was Frank Cashen, who had spent ten 
years in the front office of the Baltimore Orioles from 1966 to 1976, during 
which time the Orioles went to four World Series, winning two. During his 
tenure, the Mets would see what some called a "resuscitation",[2] eventually 
leading to the team's first World Championship in 17 years. After leaving 
the Orioles, Cashen worked outside of baseball for three years before joining 
commissioner Bowie Kuhn's office as administrator of baseball. It was from 
this job that the Mets wooed him and installed him as executive vice president 
and general manager. Due to their last-place finish in 1979, the Mets had 
the first pick in the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft. They used it to 
select an 18-year-old outfielder from Los Angeles, Darryl Strawberry, who 
would be a big part of future Mets teams. The team under Torre suffered 
their 4th straight losing season, 24 games out of first place. although 
the Mets moved up one place in the standings to fifth. They were right 
around .500 until losing 38 of their last 49 games, which may have led 
to attendance jumping nearly 400,000 to almost 1,200,000. The team had 
the motto the "Magic is Back" during the 1980 season. Infielders Coaches
