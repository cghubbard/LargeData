The Devil Rays began to build their organization shortly after the franchise 
was awarded in 1995 by naming former Atlanta Braves assistant general manager 
Chuck LaMar the senior vice president of baseball operations and general 
manager. The franchise's first minor league games took place in the 1996 
season. On November 7, 1997, Larry Rothschild was named the team's first 
manager. The team acquired 35 players in the Expansion Draft on November 
18, 1997. Tony Saunders from the Florida Marlins was the first player drafted 
by the Devil Rays. The team also drafted future star Bobby Abreu but traded 
him to the Philadelphia Phillies for Kevin Stocker, who had very little 
success for the Rays. Before the 1998 season, veteran stars Wade Boggs, 
Fred McGriff, and Wilson Álvarez were acquired. The Devil Rays played their 
first game on March 31, 1998 against the Detroit Tigers at Tropicana Field 
before a crowd of 45,369. Wilson Álvarez threw the first pitch and Wade 
Boggs hit the first home run in team history that day. Despite losing their 
opening game 11–6, the team actually got off to a respectable start and 
were 11–8 after 19 before losing six straight and falling below .500. They 
would go on to lose 99 games that year. One of the first memorable moments 
in franchise history occurred on August 7, 1999 when Wade Boggs tallied 
his 3000th career hit, the first player to do so with a home run.[1] Boggs 
retired after the season and is the only Ray with his number retired. He 
was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005. The Devil Rays acquired 
sluggers Vinny Castilla, Jose Canseco and Greg Vaughn; along with incumbent 
Fred McGriff, this quartet was dubbed the "Hit Show." However, all of these 
players were past their prime and unable to sustain their previous successes. 
The Devil Rays continued to struggle in 1999 and 2000. Prior to the 2001 
season, they modified their team colors and uniforms and also acquired 
highly touted outfielder Ben Grieve from Oakland. Early in the 2001 season, 
Larry Rothschild was fired as manager and was replaced by Hal McRae, and 
McGriff was dealt to the Chicago Cubs. By the 2002 season, the Devil Rays 
decided to rebuild with younger players and drastically reduced the team 
payroll. Randy Winn, Aubrey Huff, Toby Hall, and Carl Crawford began to 
emerge as key players. However, the 2002 season would prove to be the worst 
in franchise history to date. McRae was moved to a front office position 
after the season. Before the 2003 season, the team traded Randy Winn to 
the Seattle Mariners for the right to negotiate with manager Lou Piniella, 
a Tampa native, who managed winning teams at every stop in his managerial 
career, including the New York Yankees, the Cincinnati Reds (whom he led 
to a World Series Trophy in 1990), and the Mariners. Piniella was attracted 
to the Tampa Bay job because of the proximity to his family and the chance 
to build a losing franchise into a winner as he had done in Seattle. Piniella's 
first team still came in last place, but finished seven games better than 
the 2002 team. A highlight of the 2003 season was the emergence of Rocco 
Baldelli, a native of Rhode Island, as one of the top rookies in the major 
leagues. Entering the 2004 season expectations for the Devil Rays were 
low, but the team won 70 games for the first time and finished in 4th place 
in the American League East, out of last place for the first time. Entering 
May, the team was 10–28 before going on to win 30 of 40 games, including 
a team-record 12-game winning streak. The Devil Rays peaked at 42–41 but 
the team was unable to sustain that success and finished 21 games below 
.500. Following a 28–61 record at the All-Star Break in 2005, the Devil 
Rays went 39–34 for a final record of 67–95. Carl Crawford and newcomers 
Jorge Cantú and Jonny Gomes led a productive offense that finished third 
in the American League in team batting average. However, the pitching staff 
had the second worst ERA in the American League. Despite the promising 
finish, Lou Piniella became frustrated with what he perceived as an insufficient 
commitment to winning by the ownership group, and he reached a settlement 
with the team to release him from the last year of his contract and Angels 
coach Joe Maddon was named manager, the fourth in team history. Shortly 
after the season ended, new owner Stuart Sternberg, immediately fired Chuck 
LaMar along with most of the front office. Matthew Silverman was named 
the team president, and Andrew Friedman took the role of Executive Vice 
President of Baseball Operations. Sternberg decided not to have a de jure 
General Manager, calling the position "outdated."[2] With the change of 
ownership and the strong finish to the 2005 season, Tampa Bay fans were 
optimistic about the 2006 season, the official attendance for the Devil 
Rays' home opener was 40,199, the highest turnout since the 1998 inaugural 
season home opener.[3] At the All-Star break, Tampa Bay was only eleven 
games under the .500 mark (39–50). However, the front office became convinced 
that the Devil Rays would not contend in 2006 and they traded several veteran 
players and the Devil Rays struggled in the second half particularly on 
the road, and finished with a league worst 61–101 record. The Devil Rays 
were involved in two unusual triple plays in 2006; one they hit into, the 
other they executed themselves. On June 11 against Kansas City, they hit 
into the third triple play in major league history, and first since 1937, 
that involved an appeal. Russell Branyan flied out to center, Rocco Baldelli 
tried to advance to second base and was thrown out, and then Aubrey Huff 
was called out when the umpires ruled that he left third base early when 
he tagged up. Then, on September 2 against Seattle, the Devil Rays executed 
a 2–6–2 triple play where the ball never touched the bat, something that 
had never been done before. The triple play involved a strikeout and two 
baserunners caught off base. Tampa Bay pitcher J. P. Howell struck out 
Raúl Ibañez. Catcher Dioner Navarro fired the ball to shortstop Ben Zobrist, 
who tagged out Adrián Beltré trying to steal second base. During that throw, 
José López tried to go home from third, but Zobrist returned the ball to 
Navarro in time to put Lopez out at the plate, completing the first 2–6–2 
triple play in MLB history.[4] The Devil Rays finished with a winning record 
at home (41–40) for the first time ever and home attendance increased by 
20% from 2005.[4] In the 2006–07 off-season, the Devil Rays won the rights 
to Japanese infielder Akinori Iwamura.[5] and signed him to a three-year 
contract. In an effort to court the Orlando, Florida, market, the Devil 
Rays played a series at The Ballpark (now called Champion Stadium) at Disney's 
Wide World of Sports Complex in the 2007 season. The series selected was 
the May 15–17 series versus the Texas Rangers. The Devil Rays swept the 
Rangers in that series.[6] In 2007, the Devil Rays had the youngest starting 
line-up since the 1983 Minnesota Twins. The Rays had several bright spots 
on the year as they were led by pitchers James Shields and Scott Kazmir 
but with a poor bullpen the Rays compiled the worst record in baseball 
(66–96), finishing last in the American League East for the ninth time 
in their 10-season existence. Prior to the 2008 season the team unveiled 
new uniforms along with a name change. After considering other options 
such as the "Aces", "Bandits", "Cannons", "Dukes", "Stripes", and Stuart 
Sternberg's personal favorite, the "Nine,"[7] the team's new name was officially 
announced to be the "Tampa Bay Rays." The new team colors were "navy, Columbia 
blue and a touch of gold"[8] and a new team logo featured a bright yellow 
sunburst symbolizing the Sunshine State of Florida. Following a front office 
promise to increase the team's payroll, it was raised to $43 million.[8] 
The Rays lineup remained largely intact from 2007, several key trades and 
free agent signings improved the team, additions included Matt Garza, Jason 
Bartlett, and veteran relief pitcher and closer Troy Percival. Top third-base 
prospect Evan Longoria was expected to be the starter at the hot corner 
while the Rays also signed the #1 pick from the previous year's draft, 
pitcher David Price, who was widely recognized as one of the top players 
in college baseball.[9] The Rays finished spring training with a club record 
18 wins and tied for highest winning percentage in the Grapefruit League. 
They began the season with a win in Baltimore and snapped a 7-game losing 
streak in road openers. As they did during the 2007 season, the Rays played 
a regular season home series at Champion Stadium in Walt Disney World for 
the April 22–24 series against the Toronto Blue Jays.[10] As in the Orlando 
series in the previous season, the Rays won all three games and followed 
with their first-ever sweep of the Boston Red Sox in Tropicana Field. The 
Rays became the first team in modern Major League history (since 1900) 
to hold the best record in the league through Memorial Day, after having 
the worst record in the league the year before.[11] This marked the best 
start in franchise history and the first time ever that the team was 11 
games over .500. In June, incidents over the course of two consecutive 
games led to a bench clearing brawl against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway 
Park, in which Coco Crisp charged the mound after being hit by a pitch 
by James Shields. Within the first week of July the Rays stretched their 
division lead to 5½ games, but then lost seven consecutive games heading 
into the All-Star Break. Trailing the Red Sox for the division lead by 
½ game, they still led the Wild Card. Scott Kazmir and Dioner Navarro were 
selected to play in the All-Star Game. Evan Longoria was voted into the 
roster by the fans in the Final Vote giving the Rays a team record for 
All-Stars. In another franchise first, Longoria participated in the Home 
Run Derby. Despite injuries to several key players in early August including 
Evan Longoria, Carl Crawford, and Troy Percival, the Rays finished August 
on a 5-game winning streak, compiling a record of 21–7 for the month, the 
best single month in franchise history. With an 84–51 overall record, the 
best in the league, their lead in the division grew to 5½ games going into 
the final month of the season. On September 20, the Rays, with the best 
home record in Major League Baseball, clinched their first-ever postseason 
berth in franchise history and clinched the AL East Pennant shortly thereafter.[12] 
In the American League Division Series the Rays defeated the Chicago White 
Sox in 4 games, clinching their first playoff series victory and advanced 
to the American League Championship Series (ALCS) where they defeated the 
Boston Red Sox in 7 games to go to the World Series for the first time. 
Despite having home-field advantage in the series, the Rays lost to the 
Philadelphia Phillies, four games to one, in the World Series. The Rays' 
turnaround was mostly credited to much improved defense and pitching. The 
Rays also stole 142 bases, more than any other team in the AL. They also 
had five pitchers throw over 150 innings, more than any other team in baseball: 
Shields, Kazmir, Garza, Andy Sonnanstine, and Edwin Jackson.[13] While 
the 2007 bullpen and defense were historically bad, stats for 2008 were 
among the best in the majors, and the best in franchise history. With the 
Rays' new payroll total above $60 million principal owner Stuart Sternberg 
announced that unlike previous seasons the Rays had no more flexibility 
to make additions during the upcoming season. In the 2008 season, despite 
the Rays being contenders the entire season, attendance was still among 
the lowest in the league. Sternberg also stated the only team that did 
not have an average attendance higher than the league average in the season 
following a World Series appearance was the Florida Marlins, who did so 
twice after each of their championship seasons. He accepted that the Rays 
might become the third occurrence, saying about the 2008 season, "it wasn't 
the best year to win", because of the current state of the economy.[14] 
Following a lackluster start the Rays finished May with an overall record 
of 25–28 and just half a game out of last place but pulled within 4 games 
of the AL East and 1½ back in the wild card toward the All-Star break. 
Carl Crawford, Jason Bartlett, Ben Zobrist, and Evan Longoria were named 
as All-Stars for the American League in the All-Star Game with Longoria 
earning the start at third base but was unable to play due to injury. Carlos 
Peña was added as an injury replacement and participated in the 2009 Home 
Run Derby. In the All-Star Game Carl Crawford won MVP honors by making 
a leaping catch at the wall to take away Brad Hawpe's home run. In August 
Iwamura returned from injuries sustained in May and the Rays traded Scott 
Kazmir to the Angels for two minor league prospects and a player to be 
named later. Kazmir left the team as the all-time leader in wins and strikeouts.[15] 
The Rays stumbled in September, losing 11 games in a row at one point, 
and lost Carlos Peña for the remainder of the season to a broken finger 
from a hit by pitch. At the time Peña was leading the American League in 
home runs. The Rays clinched a winning season but the team did not make 
the post-season finishing with an 84–78 record, good enough for 3rd place. 
On October 2 B.J. Upton became the first Tampa Bay player to hit for the 
cycle.[16] After the 2009 season second baseman Akinori Iwamura was traded 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates for relief pitcher Jesse Chavez who was then 
traded to the Atlanta Braves for closer Rafael Soriano.[17] In spring training 
the Rays finished with the best record in the Grapefruit League and set 
a franchise record for wins in spring training. Second baseman Sean Rodriguez, 
who had been acquired in the Scott Kazmir trade with the Angels, was considered 
a breakout player during the spring, on both the offensive and defensive 
side of the ball.[18] Although the Rays had the league best record at the 
time, Dallas Braden of the Oakland Athletics threw a perfect game against 
the Rays in May. It was the league's second perfect game in a row thrown 
against Tampa Bay, the last being in 2009 by Mark Buehrle, and at the time 
was the shortest amount of time between perfect games in Major League Baseball. 
The Rays were once again victims of a no-hitter on June 25 at Tropicana 
Field, thrown by former Ray, Edwin Jackson of the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
Jackson threw 149 pitches against his old team, and although 10 batters 
reached base, none were the result of a base hit. David Price, Evan Longoria, 
Carl Crawford, and Rafael Soriano were named to the American League team 
in the 2010 All-Star game. Price was named the starting pitcher for the 
AL. On July 26, 2010, Matt Garza threw a no-hitter against the Detroit 
Tigers, becoming the fifth pitcher to throw a no-hitter that season. It 
was the first no-hitter ever thrown by a Tampa Bay pitcher in the franchise's 
history.[19] On the last day of the regular season, the Rays won their 
second AL East championship in three years, and finished the 2010 season 
with the American League's best record (96–66), and behind only the Philadelphia 
Phillies by one game for the Majors' best record. The Rays' ace pitcher 
David Price finished with 19 wins, finishing second in the American League 
Cy Young Award voting, and closer Rafael Soriano converted 45 saves, both 
setting new franchise records in those respective categories. In the postseason, 
the Rays were eliminated in the ALDS, losing to the Texas Rangers in five 
games. During the offseason, several key players from the Rays were either 
traded away or lost to free agency. They received five minor league prospects 
from the Chicago Cubs in a trade that included starting pitcher Matt Garza,[20] 
while shortstop Jason Bartlett was sent to the San Diego Padres for four 
minor league prospects.[21] Seven relief pitchers would not return to the 
team in 2011. First baseman Carlos Peña, the franchise's all-time leader 
in home runs, signed with the Chicago Cubs.[22] Perhaps the biggest loss 
for the Rays was left fielder Carl Crawford, who signed a lucrative deal 
with the Boston Red Sox.[23] Among their acquisitions were veterans and 
former Red Sox teammates Johnny Damon and Manny Ramirez, who each signed 
one-year contracts with the Rays.[24] Although on April 8, Ramirez chose 
to retire due to testing positive for a banned substance in spring training.[25] 
The Rays started the season 0–6, their worst start in franchise history, 
but finished the month of April with a record of 15–12, 1½ games behind 
the New York Yankees for first place in the AL East. The Rays became the 
first team in league history to start the season 0–6 and finish April with 
a winning record.[26] The Rays entered the final day of the regular season 
tied with the Boston Red Sox for the American League wild card. The Rays 
won the AL wild card spot after beating the New York Yankees 8–7 in the 
12th inning. The Rays battled back from a 7–0 deficit in the eighth with 
six runs. Down to their final strike in the ninth inning, they tied the 
game in the bottom of the ninth following pinch-hitter Dan Johnson's solo 
home run. Evan Longoria's walk-off home run won the game in the 12th inning. 
Longoria's home run came three minutes following the conclusion of the 
Baltimore Orioles rallying past the Red Sox. Boston went down in history 
as suffering the biggest collapse during the final month of the season 
in MLB history by giving up a 9-game lead in the American League Wild Card 
race at the beginning of September. Game 162 is commemorated in two ways 
in Tropicana Field. There is 162 Landing a designation in the left field 
corner where Longoria's playoff-clinching home run landed. The area is 
located off Left Field Street where Evan Longoria's 12th-inning walk-off 
homer landed Sep 28 to beat the Yankees and propel Tampa Bay to the postseason. 
The entrance to 162 Landing is open to the public and includes a recap 
of the events here and at Camden Yards from that night, video highlights 
and interviews, photos and displays. There also is a white seat in the 
right field corner commemorating where Dan Johnson's two-out, two-strike 
game-tying homer landed in the bottom of the ninth. Section 140, Seat 10, 
Row T. Tampa Bay was eliminated in the ALDS by the Texas Rangers, three 
games to one. After the elimination, owner Stuart Sternberg expressed concern 
about the team's viability in Florida after the team's last playoff game 
failed to sell out.[27] The Rays failed to make the postseason for the 
first time since 2009 after posting a 90–72 record. Some of the highlights 
of the season included closer Fernando Rodney setting a new single-season 
franchise record with 48 saves, and also finished with a 0.60 earned run 
average for the season, which is the lowest by a relief pitcher in major 
league history, as of today.[28] Rodney was also named AL Comeback Player 
of the Year. David Price became the first pitcher in the history of the 
team to win 20 games, as well as the first Rays player to be given the 
Cy Young Award. During the offseason, the Rays traded pitchers James Shields 
and Wade Davis to the Kansas City Royals for top prospects Wil Myers and 
Jake Odorizzi, along with players Patrick Leonard, and Mike Montgomery. 
Elliot Johnson was later traded as a PTBNL. The Rays acquired players Yunel 
Escobar, Roberto Hernández (formerly known as Fausto Carmona), James Loney, 
Juan Carlos Oviedo, Jamey Wright, Kelly Johnson, among others. The Rays 
lost B.J. Upton, Carlos Peña, Jeff Keppinger, J.P. Howell, among others 
as well. The Rays also re-signed Fernando Rodney. On October 24, 2014, 
manager Joe Maddon exercised an opt-out clause in his contract and resigned 
as manager of the Rays. He is now the manager of the Chicago Cubs.[29]
