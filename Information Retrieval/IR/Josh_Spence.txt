Joshua Patrick William "Josh" Spence (born 22 January 1988) is an Australian 
professional baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent. Previously, 
he pitched for the San Diego Padres. Spence enrolled at Central Arizona 
College, and played for their baseball team in 2008 and 2009. He was selected 
in the 2008 draft by the Arizona Diamondbacks and in the 2009 draft by 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, but did not sign either time.[citation 
needed] He transferred to Arizona State University to play for the Sun 
Devils for the 2010 season, where he joined Mike Leake and Seth Blair in 
the Sun Devils' starting rotation.[1] He was drafted by the Padres in the 
ninth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft, and signed with them.[citation 
needed] He was called up by San Diego on June 21, 2011, after they designated 
Luis Durango for assignment to make room for him on the 40-man roster.[2] 
Spence made his debut on 25 June 2011 in the top of the ninth inning against 
the Atlanta Braves; he faced three All-Stars in Jason Heyward, Chipper 
Jones, and Brian McCann, setting them down in order. He became the 29th 
Australian to reach the Majors and first pitcher since Rich Thompson debuted 
for the Angels in 2007.[3] The Padres designated Spence for assignment 
after the 2012 season. The New York Yankees claimed Spence off waivers 
on November 6.[4] He was designated for assignment by the Yankees on December 
14. He signed a minor league deal with the Miami Marlins in December 2013. 
On April 1, 2014, he was assigned to AAA New Orleans Zephyrs. He was released 
on May 20, 2014. Spence is a finesse pitcher, relying on pitch location 
and movement rather than overpowering speed. His two main pitches are a 
sinker averaging about 84 mph and a slider averaging 78. He also has a 
changeup at 76-77 mph that he uses often against right-handed hitters.[5]
