As Player As Manager Harry Francis Craft (April 19, 1915 – August 3, 1995) 
was an American Major League Baseball player and manager. Born in Ellisville, 
Mississippi, he was a center fielder for the Cincinnati Reds from 1937 
to 1942. Craft attended Mississippi College, threw and batted right-handed, 
stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). He was 
the first manager in Houston Major League history as skipper of the expansion 
Houston Colt .45s, later the Astros. A well-praised defensive center fielder, 
Craft was an average hitter in his short career. His best season came, 
basically, as a rookie (he had 42 at bats the previous season) in 1938. 
On June 15 of that year, Craft caught the ninth-inning pop fly (batted 
by Leo Durocher) to make the final out in the historic game that gave Johnny 
Vander Meer his second consecutive no-hitter. That same season, Craft batted 
a solid .270 as the Reds' everyday center fielder with 15 home runs and 
83 RBIs in 151 games. He had 165 hits that season in 612 at bats. All those 
numbers ended up being career-highs. The next two years were Cincinnati's 
best seasons as they went to the World Series in both, winning in 1940 
against the Detroit Tigers. However, Craft did not play a large part in 
the victory, having only 1 at bat. He ended up with just one postseason 
hit, which came the year before. On June 8, 1940, he hit for the cycle 
in a 23–2 win over the Brooklyn Dodgers. Craft joined the Navy in 1942. 
By the time he returned to baseball his skills had deteriorated and he 
never made it back to the major leagues as a player. In six seasons, Craft 
had an all-time .253 batting average with 44 home runs and 267 RBIs. He 
accumulated 14 stolen bases and 237 runs scored. He had 533 hits in 2104 
at bats. Craft began his managing career in the farm system of the New 
York Yankees. He was Mickey Mantle's first manager in professional baseball 
— in 1949 with Independence of the Kansas–Oklahoma–Missouri League. In 
1950, Craft would manage Mantle again with the Joplin Miners in the Western 
Association.[1] Eventually, Craft progressed to the AAA level with the 
Kansas City Blues of the American Association in 1953–1954. "I was lucky 
to have Harry as skipper my first two years", Mantle said years later. 
"He started me out right." [1] Craft would also manage Roger Maris at the 
Major League level in 1958–1959 with the Kansas City Athletics, just before 
the young right fielder was traded to the Yankees. Maris credited Craft 
with helping him with his hitting. During his time with the Chicago Cubs, 
Craft briefly returned to managing at the Minor League level for the Triple-A 
affiliate Houston Buffs of the American Association in 1961. He would be 
the last manager for the Houston Buffs, before being promoted to become 
the first manager of the big league club when that city officially began 
its National League Houston Colt .45s in 1962. Craft went from the minor 
league Blues to the Major League Athletics in 1955, their first year in 
Kansas City after transferring from Philadelphia, when he was named a coach 
on the staff of Lou Boudreau. After over 2½ losing seasons, Boudreau was 
released on August 6, 1957, and Craft was named his successor. Craft's 
Athletics went 23–27 to finish the 1957 season. He then lasted two more 
full campaigns, 1958 and 1959, before his firing. Craft finished with a 
162–196 record at Kansas City. His best finish was seventh place in the 
eight-team American League. In 1961, Craft was a member of Chicago Cubs 
owner Phil Wrigley's ill-fated College of Coaches. From 1961 to 1965, the 
team had no permanent manager, and rotated the "head coach" job among its 
coaching staff. Craft led the Bruins for 16 games in 1961, coming out 7–9, 
as one of four head coaches that year. He spent the latter half of the 
year managing the Buffs, then the Cubs' top farm team. Craft became the 
first skipper in the history of the expansion Houston Colt .45s the following 
year.[2] He managed them from 1962 to 1964, before his replacement by Lum 
Harris in the closing days of the '64 season.[3] He ended 191–280 with 
the Colt .45s, never having managed an above .500 team in all or parts 
of seven seasons as a big league manager. He remained in the game, however, 
as a scout and farm system official for the Baltimore Orioles, San Francisco 
Giants and the Yankees, retiring in 1991. Craft ended his managing career 
with a 360–485 record in 849 games, a .426 winning percentage. His best 
finish was seventh place. The authors of The Great American Baseball Card 
Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book, Brendan C. Boyd & Fred C. Harris, 
Little Brown & Co, 1973, had this to say about Craft's career on p. 52, 
perhaps unfairly given what little he had to work with on those clubs: 
"Of course, if you are really lousy at what you do, there's always a chance 
you can work your way into management, that being the American Way... Harry 
Craft managed three teams in a seven year span... They finished 7th, 7th, 
7th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 9th. Do I detect a trend in there somewhere?" He 
died after a long illness in Conroe, Texas, at the age of 80 on Thursday,
