James Emory "Jimmie" Foxx (October 22, 1907 – July 21, 1967), nicknamed 
"Double X" and "The Beast", was an American baseball first baseman who 
played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Athletics, 
Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, and Philadelphia Phillies.[1] His most productive 
years were with the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston Red Sox, where 
he hit 30 or more home runs in 12 consecutive seasons and drove in more 
than 100 runs in 13 consecutive years. Foxx became the second player in 
MLB history to hit 500 career home runs, after Babe Ruth. Attaining that 
plateau at age 32 years 336 days, he held the record for youngest to reach 
500 for sixty-eight years, until superseded by Alex Rodriguez in 2007. 
His three career Most Valuable Player awards are tied for second all-time. 
Foxx was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951.[2] Foxx 
was born in Sudlersville, Maryland on October 22, 1907 to Dell and Mattie 
Foxx, who were farmers. Dell Foxx had played baseball for a town team when 
he was younger. Jimmie Foxx did well in school but excelled in sports, 
particularly soccer, track, and baseball. He played all three sports at 
Sudlersville High School. Foxx dropped out of high school early to join 
a minor league team managed by former Philadelphia Athletics great Frank 
"Home Run" Baker. Foxx had hoped to pitch or play third base, but since 
the team was short on catchers, Foxx moved behind the plate. He immediately 
drew interest from the Athletics and New York Yankees. Foxx signed with 
the A's and made his major league debut in May 1925 at age 17. He was still 
in his junior year of high school at the time.[3] The A's catching duties 
were already filled by future Baseball Hall of Fame member Mickey Cochrane, 
so by 1927, Foxx was splitting time between catching, first base, and the 
outfield. In 1929, installed as the A's regular first baseman, Foxx had 
a breakthrough year, batting .354 and hitting 33 home runs. That year, 
Foxx appeared on the cover of Time.[4] In 1932, Foxx hit .364, with 58 
home runs with 169 RBIs, missing the Triple Crown by just three points 
in batting average. Foxx actually hit 60 home runs that year, which would 
have tied Babe Ruth's record, but two of the home runs were hit in games 
that ended up being rained out, so the home runs didn't count. Boston Red 
Sox first baseman Dale Alexander hit .367, but in just 454 plate appearances; 
he would not have won the batting title under current rules, which are 
based upon 3.1 plate appearances per team games played. Foxx did win the 
Triple Crown the following season, with a batting average of .356, 163 
RBIs, and 48 home runs. He won back-to-back MVP honors in 1932 and 1933. 
Foxx was one of the three or four most feared sluggers of his era. The 
great Yankee pitcher Lefty Gomez once said of him, "He has muscles in his 
hair." In 1937, Foxx hit a ball into the third deck of the left-field stands 
at Yankee Stadium in New York City, a very rare feat because of the distance 
and the angle of the stands. Gomez was the pitcher who gave it up, and 
when asked how far it went, he said, "I don't know, but I do know it took 
somebody 45 minutes to go up there and get it back." When the Great Depression 
fully hit in the early 1930s, A's owner Connie Mack was unable to pay the 
salaries of his highly paid stars, and was obliged to sell off a number 
of them. After a 1936 contract dispute, Mack sold Foxx's contract to the 
Boston Red Sox for $150,000. Foxx played six years for Boston, including 
a 1938 season in which he hit 50 home runs, drove in 175 runs, batted .349, 
won his third MVP award, and again narrowly missed winning the Triple Crown. 
Foxx is one of nine players to have won three MVPs; only Barry Bonds (7) 
has more. On June 16, 1938, he set an American League record when he walked 
six times in a game. In 1939 he hit .360, his second-best all-time season 
batting average. His 50 home runs would remain the single-season record 
for the Red Sox until David Ortiz hit 54 in 2006. Foxx's skills diminished 
significantly after 1941. Some sources attribute this to a drinking problem, 
while others attribute it to a sinus condition. He split the 1942 season 
between the Red Sox and Chicago Cubs, playing mostly a reserve role. He 
sat out the 1943 season and appeared only in 15 games in 1944, mostly as 
a pinch hitter. He wound up his career with the Philadelphia Phillies in 
1945, filling in at first and third, pinch hitting, and pitching nine games, 
including two as the starting pitcher. He compiled a 1–0 record and 1.59 
ERA over 22 2⁄3 innings. Foxx was often called the right-handed Babe Ruth, 
but his career was the opposite of Ruth in this regard. Ruth began his 
big-league career as a pitcher; Foxx ended his big-league career as one. 
Foxx finished his 20-year career with 534 home runs, 1,922 runs batted 
in, and a .325 batting average. His 12 consecutive seasons with 30 or more 
home runs was a major league record until it was broken by Barry Bonds 
in 2004. At the end of his career, his 534 home runs placed him second 
only to Ruth on the all-time list, and first among right-handed hitters. 
He retained these positions until Willie Mays passed Foxx for second place 
in 1966. Foxx was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1951. Foxx worked 
as a minor league manager and coach after his playing days ended, including 
managing the Fort Wayne Daisies of the All-American Girls Professional 
Baseball League for one season in 1952.[5] He took them to the playoffs 
where they lost in the first round 2 games to 1 against the Rockford Peaches. 
Foxx did not return for the 1953 season. Foxx served as head coach for 
the University of Miami baseball team for two seasons, going 9–8 in 1956 
and 11–12 in 1957. A series of bad investments left Foxx broke by 1958.[6] 
He retired to suburban Cleveland in Lakewood, and was employed by the Lakewood 
Recreation Department. His two children, a daughter and son, also lived 
in Lakewood. His son, Jimmie Foxx, Jr., was an outstanding football player 
at Lakewood High School and at Kent State University. Foxx had a city baseball 
field named in his honor. The dedication ceremony included Foxx's son, 
grandchildren and several former members of the Cleveland Indians, including 
Herb Score and Mike Hegan. TV announcer Casey Coleman, son of announcer 
Ken Coleman, served as master of ceremonies of the event. A plaque commemorating 
Foxx's community service remains there today. Foxx died in 1967 at age 
59 in Miami, Florida.[7] He became ill while eating dinner with his brother 
and was taken to a hospital, where resuscitative efforts failed. An autopsy 
showed that Foxx had choked on a piece of food. The year before, Foxx's 
second wife, Dorothy, had also died of choking.[8] Foxx is buried at Flagler 
Memorial Park in Miami. A statue of Foxx was erected in his hometown of 
Sudlersville, Maryland on October 25, 1997. In 1999, he ranked number 15 
on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[9] and 
was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Tom Hanks' 
character Jimmy Dugan in the movie A League of Their Own was largely based 
on Foxx and Hack Wilson, although the producers took a number of liberties 
in creating the role.[6] Foxx is mentioned in the poem "Line-Up for Yesterday" 
by Ogden Nash: X is the first Of two x's in Foxx Who was right behind Ruth
