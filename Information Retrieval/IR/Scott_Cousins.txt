Scott Michael Cousins (born January 22, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball for the Florida 
/ Miami Marlins and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim from 2010 through 2013. 
Cousins, 6'1 197 lbs,[1] attended North Valleys High School in Reno, Nevada 
(03') where he was a stand out in both baseball and basketball. As a sophomore 
at the University of San Francisco in 2005, Cousins batted .309 with 30 
RBIs, 13 stolen bases, and 7 home runs. On the mound, he went 8–5 with 
a 2.64 ERA and 76 strikeouts.[2] In 2006, as a junior, Cousins hit .343 
with 46 RBIs, 21 stolen bases, and 7 home runs for the Dons. He also won 
4 games striking out 61 batters.[2] For his performance, Cousins was named 
a first-team All-American and the 2006 West Coast Conference Player of 
the Year. Cousins' play helped the Dons win their first WCC title and make 
an inaugural trip to the NCAA Regionals.[3] Cousins was drafted by the 
Marlins in the third round of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft.[citation

home runs, 74 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases. He earned "MiLB.com Class A Best 
Single-Game Performer honors when he slugged three home runs and drove 
in a career-high nine RBIs on Aug. 22 against Hickory ... stroked a game-tying 
two-run homer, launched a grand slam, the first of his career, an inning 
later, and finished his day with a three-run drive in the eighth."[4] In 
2008, as a member of the Mesa Solar Sox, Cousins led the Arizona Fall League 
in RBIs with 33 and hit .297 with 6 home runs.[2] In 2009 for the Jacksonville 
Suns, Cousins batted .263 with 74 RBIs, 12 home runs, 27 stolen bases, 
and led all AA with 11 triples (also setting a Marlins' minor league record).[2] 
Cousins was added to the Marlins' 40 man roster following the 2009 season 
to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.[citation needed] Cousins hit .285 
with 14 home runs, 49 RBIs, and 12 stolen bases for the New Orleans Zephyrs 
in the Class AAA Pacific Coast League before being called up to the major 
leagues on September 2, 2010.[2] Cousins recorded his first hit, a walk-off 
single, against the Atlanta Braves on September 5, 2010. Regarding Cousins' 
call up, USF head coach Nino Giarratano stated, "Academically, athletically 
and personally he is most deserving of the opportunity and a lifetime of 
opportunities in Major League Baseball."[3] On September 24 and 25, Scott 
Cousins became the first major leaguer since Willie McGee in 1982 to record 
back-to-back pinch hit triples when he hit three baggers against the Brewers 
at Miller Park.[5] On April 21, 2011, Cousins hit his first career home 
run, a grand slam off James McDonald of the Pittsburgh Pirates.[citation

Cousins collided with catcher Buster Posey at home plate after tagging 
up from third base on a sacrifice fly from Emilio Bonifacio. Posey sustained 
a broken fibula and three torn ligaments in his ankle, causing him to miss 
the rest of the season.[6] Cousins said he hit Posey on purpose so that 
he could score. "If you hit them, you punish them and you punish yourself, 
but you have a chance of that ball coming out."[7] While Cousins maintained 
that he did not intend to injure Posey, many others[who?] disagreed, and 
argued that Cousins hit Posey with the intention of hurting him.[8] This 
collision led to MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association 
to agree to a new rule intended to limit home plate collisions.[9] On June 
15, 2012, Cousins was called up to the majors. Two days later, on June 
17, Cousins made his first start as a Marlin since being called up. He 
went 3 for 7 against the Tampa Bay Rays, including a game-winning RBI triple 
in the 15th inning.[citation needed] On October 17, 2012, Cousins was claimed 
on waivers by the Toronto Blue Jays after being designated for assignment 
by the Marlins.[10] On November 1, Cousins was designated for assignment 
by the Blue Jays and was claimed off waivers by the Seattle Mariners 5 
days later.[11] On November 20, The Mariners designated him for assignment.[12] 
The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim claimed Cousins on November 30, 2012.[13] 
He was designated for assignment on May 18, 2013. He was later resigned 
and sent to Salt Lake. With two teams this minor league season, Cousins 
has hit .242, with 3 doubles, 5 triples, 1 home run, and 19 RBIs to go 
along with 6 stolen bases. Cousins signed a minor league deal with the 
Boston Red Sox in January 2014. He was released on March 29, 2014.[14] 
On April 16, 2014, Cousins signed a minor league contract with the Texas 
Rangers.[15] In 2016, Cousins became an area scout based in Scottsdale,
