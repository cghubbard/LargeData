As player As manager As coach Frank Robinson (born August 31, 1935) is 
an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and manager. 
He played for five teams from 1956 to 1976, and became the only player 
to win league MVP honors in both the National and American Leagues.[1] 
He won the Triple Crown, was a member of two teams that won the World Series 
(the 1966 and 1970 Baltimore Orioles), and amassed the fourth-most career 
home runs at the time of his retirement (he is currently 10th). Robinson 
was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. Robinson was the first 
African-American hired to serve as manager in MLB history. He managed the 
Cleveland Indians during the last two years of his playing career, compiling 
a 186–189 record. He went on to manage the San Francisco Giants, the Baltimore 
Orioles, and the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals. He is the honorary 
President of the American League. Robinson attended McClymonds High School 
in Oakland, California, where he was a basketball teammate of Bill Russell. 
He was a baseball teammate of Vada Pinson and Curt Flood.[2] While playing 
for the Reds in the late 1950s, he attended Xavier University in Cincinnati 
during the off-season.[3] Robinson had a long and successful playing career. 
Unusual for a star in the era before free agency, he split his best years 
between two teams: the Cincinnati Reds (1956–65) and the Baltimore Orioles 
(1966–71). The later years of his career were spent with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers (1972), California Angels (1973–74) and Cleveland Indians (1974–76). 
He is the only player to be named Most Valuable Player in both leagues, 
in 1961 with the Reds and again in 1966 with the Orioles. In his rookie 
year, 1956, he tied the then-record of 38 home runs by a rookie, as a member 
of the Cincinnati Reds, and was named Rookie of the Year. Although the 
Reds won the NL pennant in 1961 and Robinson won his first MVP that year 
(in July he batted .409, hit 13 home runs, and drove in 34 RBI to win NL 
Player of the Month) his best offensive year arguably came in 1962, when 
he hit .342 with 39 home runs, 51 doubles, 208 hits (his only 200+ hit 
season), 136 RBI and 134 runs. The Reds lost the 1961 World Series to the 
Yankees. Robinson practiced a gutsy batting style, crowding the plate perhaps 
more than any other player of his time, and experienced many knockdowns. 
Asked by an announcer what his solution to the problem was, he answered 
simply, "Just stand up and lambast the next pitch", which he often did. 
Prior to the 1966 season, Reds owner Bill DeWitt sent Robinson to Baltimore 
in exchange for pitcher Milt Pappas, pitcher Jack Baldschun and outfielder 
Dick Simpson. The trade is now considered among the most lopsided deals 
in baseball history, especially as Robinson was only 30 years old and appeared 
to have many productive years ahead of him. DeWitt attempted to downplay 
this fact and defend the deal to skeptical Reds fans by famously referring 
to Robinson as "not a young 30."[4] It forever tarnished Dewitt's legacy, 
and outrage over the deal made it difficult for Pappas to adjust to pitching 
in Cincinnati (he was traded out of town after only three seasons). There 
were also rumors that Robinson did not get along well with teammate Vada 
Pinson. In Robinson's first year in Baltimore, he won the Triple Crown, 
leading the American League with a .316 batting average (the lowest ever 
by a Triple crown winner), 49 home runs (the most ever by a right-handed 
Triple crown winner) and 122 runs batted in. On May 8, 1966, Robinson became 
the only player ever to hit a home run completely out of Memorial Stadium. 
The shot came off Luis Tiant in the second game of a doubleheader against 
the Cleveland Indians. Until the Orioles' move to Camden Yards in 1991, 
a flag labeled "HERE" was flown at the spot where the ball left the stadium. 
The Orioles won the 1966 World Series and Robinson was named the Series 
MVP. In the Orioles' four-game sweep of the defending champion Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Robinson hit two home runs—in Game One, which Baltimore won 5–2, 
and in Game Four, the only run of the game in a 1–0 series-clinching victory. 
Both home runs were hit off Don Drysdale. It was in Baltimore that he first 
became active in the civil rights movement. He originally declined membership 
in the NAACP unless the organization promised not to make him do public 
appearances. However, after witnessing Baltimore's segregated housing and 
discriminatory real estate practices, he changed his mind and became an 
enthusiastic speaker on racial issues.[5] On June 26, 1970, Robinson hit 
back-to-back grand slams (in the fifth and sixth innings) in the Orioles' 
12–2 victory over the Washington Senators at RFK Stadium. The same runners 
were on base on both home runs—Dave McNally on third, Don Buford on second 
and Paul Blair on first. The Orioles won three consecutive pennants between 
1969 and 1971, and won the 1970 World Series over his old club Cincinnati. 
During a 21-year baseball career, he batted .294 with 586 home runs, 1,812 
runs batted in, and 2,943 hits. At his retirement, his 586 career home 
runs were the fourth-best in history (behind only Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, 
and Willie Mays). He is second on Cincinnati's all-time home run leaders 
list (324), behind Johnny Bench and is the Reds' all-time leader in slugging 
percentage (.554).[6] Robinson finished his playing career with brief appearances 
for the Los Angeles Dodgers, California Angels (where he became their first 
DH and was again team mates with Vada Pinson) and Cleveland Indians. Robinson 
managed in the winter leagues late in his playing career. By the early 
1970s, he had his heart set on becoming the first black manager in the 
majors; the Angels traded him to the Cleveland Indians midway through the 
1974 season due to his open campaigning for the manager's job. In 1975, 
the Indians named him player-manager, giving him distinction of being the 
first black manager in the Majors.[5] In his first at bat as player/manager 
of the Indians, he homered at Cleveland Stadium off Yankees pitcher Doc 
Medich. His managing career would go on to include Cleveland (1975–77); 
the San Francisco Giants (1981–84); the Baltimore Orioles (1988–91); and 
the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals franchise (2002–06). In addition 
to being the first black manager in the major leagues with the American 
League's Indians, upon joining the Giants, he also became the first black 
manager in the National League. He was awarded the American League Manager 
of the Year Award in 1989 for leading the Orioles to an 87–75 record, a 
turnaround from their previous season in which they went 54–107. After 
Robinson had spent some years known in baseball as the Director of Discipline, 
he was chosen by Major League Baseball in 2002 to manage the Expos, which 
MLB owned at that time. The 2002 Expos performed surprisingly well, finishing 
second in the NL East, and posting a 19-game improvement over 2001. In 
2005, the Montreal Gazette's Stephanie Myles reported that Robinson had 
devoted much time playing golf during his years in Montreal, sometimes 
spending 16-hour days between the course and the games at night. Some journalists 
have questioned his disregard of statistics to determine pitching match-ups 
with his hitting line-ups. Robinson defended his style of managing by saying 
that he goes by his "gut feeling". In a June 2005 Sports Illustrated poll 
of 450 MLB players, Robinson was selected the worst manager in baseball, 
along with Buck Showalter, then manager of the Texas Rangers. In the August 
2006 poll, he again was voted worst manager with 17% of the vote and 37.7% 
of the NL East vote.[7] In 2005, one of Robinson's Nationals players asked 
him if he had ever played in the majors. This was reported on Real Sports 
with Bryant Gumbel as an illustration of how little some current players 
are aware of the history of the game. On April 20, 2006, with the Nationals'10–4 
victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Robinson got his 1000th win, becoming 
the 53rd manager to reach that milestone.[8] He had earned his 1000th loss 
two seasons earlier.[9] During a game against the Houston Astros on May 
25, 2006, Robinson pulled Nationals catcher Matt LeCroy during the middle 
of the seventh inning, violating an unwritten rule that managers do not 
remove position players in the middle of an inning. Instead, managers are 
supposed to discreetly switch position players in between innings. However, 
LeCroy, the third-string catcher, had allowed Houston Astros baserunners 
to steal seven bases over seven innings and had committed two throwing 
errors. Although the Nationals won the game 8–5, Robinson found the decision 
so difficult to make on a player he respected so much, he broke down crying 
during the post-game interviews.[10] On September 30, 2006, the Nationals' 
management declined to renew Robinson's contract for the 2007 season, though 
they stated he was welcome to come to spring training in an unspecified 
role. Robinson, who wanted either a front office job or a consultancy, 
declined.[11] On October 1, 2006, he managed his final game, a 6–2 loss 
to the Mets, and prior to the game addressed the fans at RFK Stadium.[12] 
Robinson's record as a manager stands at 1065 wins and 1176 losses.[13] 
In addition to his two Most Valuable Player awards (1961 and 1966) and 
his World Series Most Valuable Player award (1966), Robinson was honored 
in 1966 with the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year 
in any sport. In 1982, Robinson was inducted into the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame as a Baltimore Oriole. Robinson is also a charter member of 
the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame (along with Brooks Robinson), and a 
member of the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame, being inducted into both in 
1978. Both the Reds and the Orioles have retired his uniform number 20. 
In 1999, he ranked Number 22 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. In 2003, the Reds dedicated a bronze statue 
of Robinson at Great American Ball Park. On April 28, 2012, the Orioles 
unveiled a bronze statue of Robinson at Oriole Park at Camden Yards as 
part of the Orioles Legends Celebration Series.[14] He was awarded the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 9, 2005, by President George 
W. Bush.[15] On April 13, 2007 Robinson was awarded the first Jackie Robinson 
Society Community Recognition Award at George Washington University.[16] 
In his career, he held several major league records. In his rookie season, 
he tied Wally Berger's record for home runs by a rookie (38).[5] (The current 
record would be set by Mark McGwire in 1987.) Robinson still holds the 
record for home runs on opening day (8), which includes a home run in his 
first at bat as a player-manager.[17] Robinson won the American League 
Triple Crown (.316 BA, 49 HR, 122 RBI) – only two players (Carl Yastrzemski 
and Miguel Cabrera) have since won the award in either league – and the 
two MVP awards, which made him the first player in baseball history to 
earn the title in both leagues. Robinson first served in the MLB front 
office as Vice President of On-Field Operations from 1999 to 2002, responsible 
for player discipline, uniform policy, stadium configuration, and other 
on-field issues.[18] Robinson served as an analyst for ESPN during 2007 
Spring training.[19] The Nationals offered to honor Robinson during a May 
20 game against his former club the Baltimore Orioles but he refused.[20] 
In 2007 Robinson rejoined the MLB front office, serving as a Special Advisor 
for Baseball Operations from 2007 to 2009. He then served as Special Assistant 
to Bud Selig from 2009 to 2010, and then was named Senior Vice President 
for Major League Operations from 2010 to 2011. In June 2012, he became 
Executive Vice President of Baseball Development.[18] In February 2015, 
Robinson left his position as Executive Vice President of Baseball Development 
and was named senior advisor to the Commissioner of Baseball and Honorary
