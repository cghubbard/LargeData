The Tampa Bay Rays are a Major League Baseball franchise based in St. Petersburg, 
Florida. The Rays (formerly the Tampa Bay Devil Rays) compete in the American 
League East division. Since the franchise was established in 1995, the 
Rays have selected 27 players in the first round. Officially known as the 
"First-Year Player Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is Major League Baseball's 
primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, 
colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams. The draft order 
is determined based on the previous season's standings, with the team possessing 
the worst record receiving the first pick.[1] In addition, teams which 
lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory 
or supplementary picks.[2] The First-Year Player Draft is unrelated to 
the 1997 expansion draft in which the Rays filled their roster. Of the 
27 players the Rays have selected in the first round, nine have been outfielders 
and nine have been pitchers. Of the nine pitchers, six were right-handed 
and three were left-handed. The Rays have also drafted four shortstops, 
three third basemen, one catcher, and one second baseman. The team has 
never drafted a player at first base.[3] 17 players were drafted out of 
high school, while ten were drafted out of college. Two players were drafted 
from Rice University in Houston, Texas in consecutive years.[3] None of 
the Rays' first-round picks have won a World Series championship with the 
team, and no pick has been named the Most Valuable Player. Evan Longoria 
(2006) won the Rookie of the Year Award in 2008, the only Rays' player 
to do so.[4] The Rays have made the first selection in the draft four times, 
drafting Josh Hamilton (1999), Delmon Young (2003), David Price (2007), 
and Tim Beckham (2008).[3] The Rays have made nine selections in the supplemental 
round of the draft since their establishment in 1995.[3] These additional 
picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent 
in the previous off-season,[2][5][V] or, more recently, if a team fails 
to sign a draft pick from the previous year.[6] The Rays have failed to 
sign one of their first-round picks, LeVon Washington (2009), a client 
of Scott Boras who could not come to an agreed contract with the team.[7]
