The Homestead Grays Bridge, also known as the (Homestead) High Level Bridge, 
was built in 1936 and spans the Monongahela River between Homestead Borough 
and the southernmost tip of Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.[2] 
It is notable as the first bridge to incorporate the Wichert Truss, which 
uses a quadrilateral shape over each support, into its design. This made 
the truss statically determinate, so that forces in the structural members 
could be calculated. The bridge was dedicated on Saturday November 20, 
1937, having cost the county of Allegheny $2,750,000 to build and originally 
carried four highway lanes and two streetcar tracks of Pittsburgh Railways 
Company.[3] It replaced the 1897 Brown's Bridge (Homestead and Highland 
Bridge) which was upstream and had linked Brown's Hill Rd on the north 
bank and Second Avenue between Ann Street and Amity Street, Homestead on 
the south bank.[4] On July 11, 2002, the Homestead High-Level Bridge was 
renamed the Homestead Grays Bridge in honor of the Homestead Grays baseball 
team.[5] The bridge had grown dilapidated since its last renovation in 
1979. In 2006 and 2007 work was undertaken to rehabilitate the bridge: 
the deck was removed and the structure stripped down to the steel, then 
the steel structure repaired and a new, wider deck put on. The new deck 
is six feet wider in traffic lanes—three feet on each side—and also has 
broader pedestrian walkways. The railings and lighting were replaced with 
reproductions of historic models, and the entire structure received a new
