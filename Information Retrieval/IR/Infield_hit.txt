An infield hit is an outcome in baseball in which the batted ball stays 
in the infield but neither the batter nor any of the runners are put out. 
If the batter and the runners reach safely due to an error, it is not considered 
an infield hit. Runners normally only advance one base in an infield hit, 
as opposed to a single where the runner from second base frequently comes 
in to score. Ichiro Suzuki is particularly noted for his infield hits.
