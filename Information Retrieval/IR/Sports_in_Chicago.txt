Sports in Chicago include many professional sports teams. Chicago is one 
of four U.S. cities to have teams from the five major American professional 
team sports (baseball, football, basketball, hockey, soccer). Chicago has 
been named as the Best Sports City by Sporting News three times in 1993, 
2006, and 2010. Chicago was a candidate city for the 2016 Summer Olympics 
but lost to Rio de Janeiro.[1] Upon the USOC reaching a new revenue sharing 
agreement with the IOC, Chicago had been mentioned as a potential candidate 
for the 2024 Summer Olympics.[2] Chicago also hosted the 1959 Pan American 
Games, the 2006 Gay Games, as well as the 1968 and 1970 Special Olympics 
Summer World Games. Chicago will be the host of the 2017 Warrior Games. 
The following is a list of active, professional major-league Chicago sports 
teams, ranked by attendance: Chicago is one of four metro areas in the 
United States that has two Major League Baseball teams, the other three 
being Los Angeles, New York, and the San Francisco Bay Area, and is one 
of only two, along with New York, which has both teams in the central city. 
The city has two Major League Baseball (MLB) teams: the Chicago Cubs of 
the National League (NL), who play in Wrigley Field on the North Side; 
and the Chicago White Sox of the American League (AL), who play in Guaranteed 
Rate Field on the South Side. Chicago is the only city that has had more 
than one MLB franchise every year since the AL began in 1901 (New York 
only hosted one between 1958 and early 1962, and Los Angeles has only done 
so since 1961). The Chicago Cubs of the National League play at Wrigley 
Field, which is located in the north side neighborhood of Lakeview, the 
western part of which is commonly referred to as "Wrigleyville."[3] The 
Cubs' rivalry with the St. Louis Cardinals is one of the most bitter in 
North American professional sports. The Cubs are the oldest team to play 
continuously in the same city since the formation of the National League 
in 1876.[4] The Cubs are the oldest Major League Baseball team to have 
never changed their city, one of nine out of the sixteen teams to predate 
expansion that have not changed cities. They have played in Chicago since 
1871, and continuously so since 1874 due to the Great Chicago Fire. They 
have played more games, have more wins and scored more runs than any other 
team in Major League baseball since 1876.[5] They have won three World 
Series titles and are fifth among National League teams with 16 pennants. 
In 2016, the Cubs beat the two longest droughts in professional sports: 
They won their sport's title for the first time since 1908 a drought of 
108 years, and participated in a World Series for the first time since 
1945 a drought of 71 years, both records in their respective rights. The 
Chicago White Sox of the American League play at Guaranteed Rate Field, 
which is located in the South Side neighborhood of Armour Square. They 
have played in Chicago since the formation of the American League in 1900. 
The White Sox have played on the South Side continuously since 1901, with 
all three of their home fields throughout the years being within mere blocks 
of one another. They have won three World Series titles (1906, 1917, 2005) 
and six American League pennants, including the first in 1901. The Sox 
are fifth in the American League in all-time wins, and sixth in pennants. 
The Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association is a professional 
basketball team. Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen led the Bulls to six 
NBA championships in two "threepeats" from 1991–1993 and again from 1996–1998.[6] 
The new generation of Bulls, known as "The Baby Bulls", emerged in 2005.[7] 
In 2007, they swept the defending champs, the Miami Heat. In 2011, led 
by league MVP Derrick Rose, the Bulls made it to the Eastern Finals, losing 
to the Miami Heat. Chicago is home to the Chicago Sky of the Women's National 
Basketball Association. The Chicago Bears of the National Football League 
play at Soldier Field. The Bears' history includes many NFL personalities, 
including owner George Halas, players Dick Butkus, Gale Sayers, Walter 
Payton, and coach Mike Ditka. The Bears are one of the original teams of 
the NFL, founded by Halas in 1919 in Decatur, Illinois. They currently 
have the most players inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame with 
26.[8] In 1985, the Bears won Super Bowl XX 46-10 over the New England 
Patriots.[9] In the 2006 season, the Bears once again made it to the Super 
Bowl, but lost 29-17 to the Indianapolis Colts.[10] They were led by coach 
Lovie Smith. The Bears' rivalry with the Green Bay Packers dates back the 
1920s, and is one of the most intense in American professional sports.[11] 
The Bears have other regional and divisional rivalries with the Minnesota 
Vikings and the Detroit Lions.[12] The Bears play their home games at Soldier 
Field, named after "The men and women of the armed forces". It is located 
next to the shores of Lake Michigan, on Lake Shore Drive. Soldier Field 
was an aging stadium and was in dire need of renovation by the end of the 
20th century. In 2003, the stadium re-opened after an extensive renovation, 
which increased the number of luxury boxes and dramatically improved the 
game day experience for Bears fans. However, because of this renovation, 
the stadium lost its National Historic Landmark designation on February 
17, 2006. The Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League is the city's 
professional ice hockey team, and are an Original Six team. The Blackhawks 
won the Stanley Cup in 1934, 1938, 1961, 2010, 2013,[13] and again in 2015.[14] 
With 3 Stanley cup wins within 6 years(2010, 2013 and 2015) gave the Blackhawks 
the title of a Dynasty. The Blackhawks receive national attention for the 
intense rivalries with the Detroit Red Wings, also an Original Six team.[15] 
Other rivalries include the Vancouver Canucks, St. Louis Blues (former 
Norris Division rivals), and the Nashville Predators. Some well-known players 
include: Stan Mikita, Tony Esposito, Bobby Hull, Keith Magnuson, Glenn 
Hall, Denis Savard, Steve Larmer, Jeremy Roenick, Chris Chelios, and Ed 
Belfour. The Chicago Fire, a member of Major League Soccer, have won one 
MLS Cup and four U.S. Open Cups since they entered the league in 1998. 
The Fire won their sole MLS Cup in 1998, their inaugural season, led by 
head coach Bob Bradley, who later went on to coach the U.S. national soccer 
team.[16] The Fire have played since 2006 at Toyota Park, a soccer-specific 
stadium located in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview near Midway Airport. 
The Fire have historically drawn an attendance average of over 15,000 fans 
per game.[17] The Fire originally played at Soldier Field,[18] also spending 
parts of two seasons at Cardinal Stadium in Naperville. Some notable former 
players include Cuauhtémoc Blanco from Mexico, Brian McBride from the USA, 
and Peter Nowak from Poland – a demonstration of the team's international 
flavor. Chicago is also home to the Chicago Red Stars, currently playing 
in the National Women's Soccer League. The Red Stars began their second 
stint at Toyota Park in 2016, having played there previously as a member 
of the now-defunct Women's Professional Soccer. The following is a list
