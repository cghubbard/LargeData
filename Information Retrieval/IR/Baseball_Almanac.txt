Baseball Almanac is an interactive baseball encyclopedia with 3,000 pages 
of baseball facts, research, awards, records, feats, lists, notable quotations, 
baseball movie ratings, and statistics.[3][4][5][6][7] Its goal is to preserve 
the history of baseball.[3] It serves, in turn, as a source for a number 
of books and publications about baseball, and/or is mentioned by them as 
a reference, such as Baseball Digest,[8] Understanding Sabermetrics: An 
Introduction to the Science of Baseball Statistics,[9] and Baseball's Top 
100: The Game's Greatest Records.[6] Dan Zachofsky described it in Collecting 
Baseball Memorabilia: A Handbook as having the most current information 
regarding members of the Hall of Fame.[10][11] David Maraniss, author of 
Clemente, the Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero, described it as 
an absolutely reliable and first-rate bountiful source, that supplied accurate 
schedules and box scores.[12] Glenn Guzo, in The New Ballgame: Baseball 
Statistics for the Casual Fan, described it as having a rich supply of 
contemporary and historic information.[6] Richard Roeper described it in 
Sox and the City: A Fan's Love Affair with the White Sox from the Heartbreak 
of '67 to the Wizards of Oz as "one of the beauteous wonders of the Internet".[13] 
Harvey Frommer, Dartmouth College Professor and sports author, said of 
Baseball Almanac: "Definitive, vast in its reach and scope, Baseball Almanac 
is a mother lode of facts, figures, anecdotes, quotations and essays focused 
on the national pastime.... It has been an indispensable research tool
