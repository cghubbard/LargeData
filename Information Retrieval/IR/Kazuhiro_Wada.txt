Kazuhiro Wada (和田 一浩, Wada Kazuhiro?, born June 19, 1972 in Gifu, Gifu, 
Japan) was a Japanese professional baseball player. He played mostly as 
an outfielder for the Chunichi Dragons and the Seibu Lions of the Nippon 
Professional Baseball league in a career spanning 18 years. Following retirement 
in 2015, he has become a color commentator for Dragons broadcasts for the 
NHK. Playing for Tohoku Fukushi University, Wada was MVP of the Sendai 
Big Six University League as a senior and won the batting title. He hit 
.429 for Kobe Seiko in the industrial leagues, then in 1996 was drafted 
in the fourth round of the Japanese draft by the Seibu Lions. He hit .190 
in 1997 when he first played for Seibu and was 0/1 in the 1997 Japan Series. 
In 1998, Wada hit .333 in 36 games for Seibu and split his time between 
catching and the outfield. He went 0/2 in the 1998 Japan Series. In 1999, 
he batted .271 while again seeing limited time behind the plate, with Tsutomu 
Ito starting. In 1998, Wada began playing semiregularly as an outfielder, 
batting .306, the same average he recorded the next year. He still not 
yet an everyday player. In 2002, Wada finally became a starter and responded 
by batting .319 with 33 homers. Playing left field and DH, he made the 
Best Nine as the top designated hitter in the Pacific League. He finished 
third in slugging behind teammates Alex Cabrera and Kazuo Matsui. His Japan 
Series woes continued with a miserable 0/15 in the 2002 Japan Series, as 
Seibu got swept by the Yomiuri Giants. Wada did even better in 2003, hitting 
.346 (.379 with runners in scoring position), homering 30 times, scoring 
87 runs and driving in 89. He made his first All-Star team and was on the 
Best Nine as an outfielder alongside Yoshitomo Tani and Tuffy Rhodes. Wada 
finished third in the Pacific League in average (behind Michihiro Ogasawara 
and Tani) and slugging (behind Cabera and Ogasawara). He was fourth in 
OBP behind Ogasawara, Tadahito Iguchi and Nobuhiko Matsunaka. 2004 was 
an eventful year for Wada. He hit .320 (.375 with RISP), homered 30 times 
and drove in 89 despite missing time for the 2004 Olympics. For the bronze 
medal-winning Japanese club in the Olympics, he hit .333 and slugged .636. 
Hitting cleanup or fifth for Seibu, he was honored again as an All-Star 
and Best Nine. In the 2004 Japan Series, he finally broke his postseason 
struggles in a big way by batting .310 with four homers in Seibu's victory 
over the Chunichi Dragons. Wada broke a 54-year-old record for most extra-base 
hits in a Japan Series with eight, breaking Isao Harimoto's record of 7 
in the 1950 Japan Series. His 26 total bases were a Japan Series record, 
breaking Yasumitsu Toyoda's 46-year-old record of 25; he tied the record 
with four homers in a series and his two homers in game six helped Seibu 
to a 4-2 victory to tie the series at three. Takashi Ishii beat him out 
for Series MVP honors, though. Wada continued his dazzling pace in 2005, 
batting .322, though his 27 homers were his lowest total in four years. 
He made his fourth straight All-Star contingent. He edged Julio Zuleta 
(.319) and Matsunaka (.315) for the first Pacific League batting title 
won by a right-handed hitter since Hatsuhiko Tsuji in 1993. He was fourth 
in slugging, third in OBP, tied for third in runs (80), first in hits (153), 
second in doubles (32). Wada was on the winning Japanese club in the 2006 
World Baseball Classic and went 0 of 2 with one strikeout in two games 
as the backup left fielder to Hitoshi Tamura. Wada hit .298 in 2006 and 
finished third in the PL with 95 RBI, second to Fernando Seguignol with 
34 doubles, eighth with 144 hits, seventh with 239 total bases, tied for 
seventh with 72 runs, second with 78 walks (trailing only Matsunaka). He 
was fourth in OBP and eighth in slugging. His home run total continued 
to fall, down to 19, but still tied for seventh in the PL. He re-signed 
for Seibu for ¥275 million plus incentives. At the end of the 2007 season, 
Wada opted for free agency and joined boyhood club and reigning Japan Series 
champions, the Chunichi Dragons in a 3-year, ¥840 million deal to replace 
MLB bound right-fielder, Kosuke Fukudome.[2] Wada's hobbies are fishing,
