Sports The Sun Devils played in the Border Conference between 1931 and 
1961, before joining the Western Athletic Conference. Led by legendary 
head coach Frank Kush, the Sun Devils posted a remarkable 64–9 record between 
1970 and 1975, culminating in a 17–14 upset of the Nebraska Cornhuskers 
in the 1975 Fiesta Bowl. In 1978, both ASU and the University of Arizona 
joined the Pacific-8 Conference, causing the conference to become the Pacific-10 
(which grew again in 2011 to become the Pac-12). The Sun Devils suffered 
some down years due to a number of head coaching changes, but were still 
able to make it to the 1983 Fiesta Bowl and 1987 Rose Bowl winning both. 
After the 2006 season, Dirk Koetter was fired after six seasons, and on 
December 6, 2006, athletic director Lisa Love hired Dennis Erickson to 
become the head coach at ASU. Erickson, in his first year as coach of the 
Arizona State Sun Devils, led the team to 10 wins, a share of the Pac-10 
title with USC, and the Holiday Bowl against the University of Texas Longhorns. 
Dennis Erickson was fired on November 28, 2011 after five seasons with 
the Sun Devils. He was replaced by coach Todd Graham on December 14, 2011. 
Lisa Love was fired from her position as Vice President for University 
Athletics and Athletics Director on March 28, 2012 and was immediately 
replaced by Steve Patterson. Notable football alumni include Terrell Suggs, 
Jim Jeffcoat, Mike Pagel, Jake Plummer, Todd Heap, J.R. Redmond, Danny

national ranking the Sun Devils have achieved was No. 3 under Ned Wulk 
during the 1980–81 season when the starting lineup included Byron Scott, 
Fat Lever, and Alton Lister. Ned Wulk was the men's basketball coach from 
1958 to 1982 and remains the most successful coach in the history of the 
program with a record of 406 – 272 (.599). Arizona State appeared in the 
NAIA Men's Basketball National Tournament two years (1948 and 1953). Both

the head coaching job at Arizona State in 2006. Sendek took the Wolfpack 
to five consecutive NCAA Tournaments and also won ACC coach of the year 
in 2004. Sendek was credited for bringing a "basketball atmosphere" and 
level of excitement to the ASU campus that had been absent for years. In 
his first four seasons at ASU, Sendek led the Sun Devils to three consecutive 
20 win seasons, the 2009 Pac-10 conference tournament finals, and the second

State Women's Gymnastics Rene Lyst, former co-head coach at Arkansas, is 
currently the head coach for the Women's Gymnastics team. She is in her 
second season alongside assistant coaches Jeff Hunt and Ralph Russo. One 
of the nation's founding programs, the two-time NCAA national champion 
Sun Devils are in their 45th season on the diamond. ASU has recorded twenty-seven 
seasons of 30 or more wins and twelve with 40 or more, including an all-time 
high of 66 wins in 2008. The Sun Devils have appeared in 23 NCAA tournaments 
(33 postseason bids overall) and have made nine trips to the Women's College 
World Series. Prior to the current NCAA format, ASU went to seven WCWS, 
claiming back-to-back national tiles in 1972 and 1973. Arizona State's 
storied tradition of softball excellence continues to flourish under head 
coach Clint Myers, who has led the Sun Devils to two NCAA national championships. 
Myers joined Linda Vollstedt (women's golf – 7), Greg Kraft (women's track 
& field indoor – 2, women's track & field outdoor – 1, men's indoor track 
& field – 1), Bobby Winkles (baseball – 3) and Jim Brock (baseball – 2) 
as Sun Devil coaches with more than one NCAA title. The Sun Devils capped 
off the 2008 season with their first WCWS NCAA national championship on 
June 3, 2008. Kaitlin Cochran hit a three-run home run, Katie Burkhart 
pitched a four-hitter and Arizona State routed Texas A&M 11–0 to win the 
title. Cochran slammed the first pitch from Megan Gibson over the left 
field fence in the fifth inning to give the sixth-seeded Sun Devils a 4–0 
lead in the fifth inning. The margin ended up matching the second-most 
lopsided game in Women's College World Series history. On June 7, 2011, 
the Sun Devils captured their second NCAA national championship by defeating 
the Florida Gators. ASU pitcher, Dallas Escobedo, became the first freshman 
pitcher to lead a team to the NCAA title since 1990. Entering his 19th 
season, Greg Kraft is the current head coach of the Track and Field team. 
During his tenure the Sun Devils have won 4 NCAA Championships, 32 NCAA 
individual titles and produced 13 Olympians.[9] As part of being in the 
Pac-12 Conference, ASU competes with UCLA, UC Berkeley, University of Stanford, 
University of Colorado Boulder, University of Arizona, and other schools 
that are in Pac-12. Among the all-time Pac-12 records, three of the top 
ten times in the men's 4x400 relay are held by ASU (2004, 2004, 2005). 
The women currently hold three of the top ten spots in the 400m (1991, 
2004, 2015).[10] Notable Sun Devil alumni include Olympian Dwight Phillips 
(Long Jump Gold Medal at 2004 Olympic games). ASU has a history producing 
top competitive athletes to compete in the Olympics even before 2004. However, 
2004 was the final year. The men's golf team has won 20 conference championships:[11] 
They won NCAA regional championships in 1991 (co-champions), 1995, 1998 
(co-champions), 1999, 2001, and 2009.[11] They won the NCAA Division I

Purtzer, Jeff Quinney, Chez Reavie, Howard Twitty, JoAnne Carner, Heather 
Farr, Giulia Molinaro, Azahara Muñoz, Anna Nordqvist, Grace Park, and Wendy 
Ward. ASU has had a very successful wrestling team. The Sun Devils have 
captured one NCAA team national championship (1988) beating powerhouse 
Iowa, followed by two years of national runners-up in 1989 & 1990 losing 
out to Oklahoma State both years. Also, the Sun Devil Wrestling team produced 
eight individual championships, and 100 total All American honors.[13] 
Notable wrestling alumni include several Mixed Martial Arts stars, such 
as: Dan Severn (inductee to UFC Hall of Fame), Don Frye, Cain Velasquez 
(UFC Heavyweight Champion), Ryan Bader, Aaron Simpson, Dan Henderson, John 
Moraga, Clifford Starks, C.B. Dollaway, and Bubba Jenkins (157 lbs NCAA 
Champion). Eight Sun Devils have participated in the Olympic games, most 
recently in the 1996 Olympic games in Atlanta. There have been two silver 
medalists; Zeke Jones and Townsend Saunders.[14] Six Sun Devils have participated 
in the World Championships of Wrestling since 1985 (a total of 16 entries).Those 
wrestlers placed in the top 10 a total of ten times, including Zeke Jones, 
the 1991 champion at 114.5 pounds. During the 1992–1993 season ASU set 
a Pacific-10 Conference record for most points in a championship meet.[15] 
On May 13, 2008, the university announced it will drop the sport of Wrestling 
as well as Men's Tennis and Men's Swimming to save more than $1 million 
in operational costs. Just 10 days after the announcement to drop three 
sports, Arizona State announced it was reinstating the varsity wrestling 
program. The announcement came as local and civic sponsorship was announced 
as the reason to bring the sport back. In 2011, one-legged wrestler Anthony 
Robles won a national championship at 125 pounds. ASU announced plans to 
transition their ACHA men's hockey program to an NCAA varsity program on 
November 18, 2014. The Sun Devils will continue play in the ACHA in 2014–15, 
play a hybrid schedule in 2015–16 with a mix of NCAA and ACHA competition, 
play as a Division I independent in 2016–17 and join a conference in 2017–18.[16] 
The National Collegiate Hockey Conference, Western Collegiate Hockey Association, 
and Big Ten[17] have been seen as potential landing spots for Arizona State.[18] 
The ASU hockey team has a proud history of ACHA hockey. The highlight included 
winning the 2013-2014 ACHA National Championship, beating Robert Morris 
3-1 to win its first national championship in hockey. The team is led by 
Coach Greg Powers. Coach Powers enters his eighth overall season on the 
Sun Devil Coaching Staff and his first as Head Coach of ASU's NCAA Division 
I Hockey program. In the 2013-14 Season Coach Powers helped guide the Sun 
Devils to their 1st ever ACHA Division I National Championship. He holds 
a 164-27-9 career record, and his team ended the 2014-2015 season ranked 
No. 3 in the ACHA with a 35-4-1 record qualifying for the team's third 
straight ACHA Division I Final Four. Since taking the reigns as Head Coach, 
Greg has also coached eight ACHA Div. I All-Americans and 15 ACHA Academic 
All-Americans.[19] Coach Powers has helped lead Sun Devil Hockey to five 
consecutive ACHA National Tournament appearances, starting with his first

Champions both for 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, and Powers was named WCHL Coach 
of the Year for 2013-2014. Powers was also named an ACHA Division I National 
Coach of the Year finalist in 2012-13, and 2014-15.[19] Since 2009, Coach 
Power's ASU hockey teams held a 37-game winning streak over the rival college 
hockey team located in Tucson, AZ.[20] Founded in 1975, the Arizona State

Territorial Cup" for the two schools. Arizona won the inaugural season 
of the series 10.5 points to 7.5. The ASU wrestling team has been dominant 
over the UA Wildcats with a record of 28–8 all time.[32] The University
