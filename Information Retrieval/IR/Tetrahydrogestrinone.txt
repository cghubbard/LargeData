Tetrahydrogestrinone[1] (THG), often referred to as The Clear, is an anabolic 
steroid developed by Patrick Arnold.[2] It has affinity to the androgen 
receptor and the progesterone receptor, but not to the estrogen receptor.[3] 
It was used by a number of high-profile athletes such as Marion Jones and 
Dwain Chambers. Tetrahydrogestrinone was developed completely in secret 
by Arnold as a designer drug, on the basis that doping testers would be 
unlikely to detect a totally new compound. Arnold developed a chemical 
similar to two obscure steroids marketed by BALCO, norbolethone and desoxymethyltestosterone, 
which had been reported in scientific literature but never entered mass 
production, and the banned anabolic steroids trenbolone and gestrinone, 
the latter of which was used to synthesise it.[4] In 2003, whistleblower 
Trevor Graham passed a spent syringe containing a small amount of the drug 
to the United States Anti-Doping Agency. This was then transferred to the 
research group of pharmacologist Don Catlin, who identified the drug using 
mass spectrometry techniques and gave it its present name.[5][6] Tetrahydrogestrinone 
has never been fully tested for safety and has never entered legitimate 
medical use, although some studies have been made of its properties.[7] 
A synthesis was devised to ensure a source of material for comparison and 
it was scheduled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005.[8][9] 
Concerns have also been raised about its potential use in animals such 
as in horse-racing. Tetrahydrogestrinone is a highly potent agonist for 
the androgen and progesterone receptors,[10] around 10 times more potent 
than the comparison drugs nandrolone or trenbolone, but with no estrogenic 
activity. It has been found to bind to the androgen receptor with similar 
affinity to dihydrotestosterone and produces growth of muscle tissue.[11] 
According to Patrick Arnold, due to the drug's potency, he never had to 
supply significant quantities to BALCO, because "just a couple of drops 
under the tongue" were a sufficient dose.[2] When THG reaches the nucleus 
of a cell, it binds to the androgen receptor at the ligand-binding pocket. 
Here it changes the expression of a variety of genes, turning on several 
anabolic and androgenic functions.[12] It is the ligand’s structure which 
determines the number of interactions that can take place with the human 
androgen receptor ligand-binding domain. Even minor modifications in the 
ligand's structure have a great impact on the strength of the interactions 
this ligand has with the androgen receptor. THG, possessing a high affinity, 
establishes more van der Waals contacts with the receptor than with many 
other steroids. It is this higher affinity and specific geometry of THG 
which makes these interactions with the androgen receptor so strong, resulting 
in THG’s potency.[13] Side effects from prolonged use are likely to include 
infertility in both men and women, as well as other steroid side effects 
such as acne and hirsutism.[3] Unlike most other anabolic steroids, THG 
also binds with high affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor, and while 
this effect may cause additional weight loss, it is also likely to cause 
extra side effects such as immunosuppression that are not seen with most 
other steroids.[14] For a time, THG was considered the drug of choice for 
safe and "invisible" world record breaking in athletics, being used by 
several high-profile gold medal winners such as the sprinter Marion Jones, 
who resigned from her athletic career in 2007 after admitting to using 
THG prior to the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where she had won three gold medals.[15] 
It has also been used by formerly banned British athlete Dwain Chambers 
and Major League Baseball first baseman Jason Giambi.[16] THG was developed 
by Patrick Arnold for the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), which 
claimed to be a nutritional supplement company.[17] The company manufactured 
the drug through palladium-charcoal catalyzed hydrogenation from gestrinone, 
a substance used in gynecology for treatment of endometriosis (Australian 
Medicines handbook 2011). In 2003, U.S. sprint coach Trevor Graham delivered 
a syringe containing traces of THG to the United States Anti-Doping Agency 
(USADA). This helped Don Catlin, MD, the founder and then-director of the 
UCLA Olympic Analytical Lab, to identify and develop a test for THG, the
