Clifton Phifer "Cliff" Lee (born August 30, 1978) is an American professional 
baseball starting pitcher who is currently a free agent. He has played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia 
Phillies, Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers. He stands 6 feet 3 inches 
(191 cm) and weighs 205 pounds (93 kg). He was born in Benton, Arkansas. 
Lee played baseball at Benton High School and attended Meridian Community 
College and the University of Arkansas before being drafted by the Montreal 
Expos in the twentieth round of the 2000 draft. After playing with the 
Expos minor-league affiliate Harrisburg Senators, Lee was traded to the 
Cleveland Indians and went to the major leagues later that season. He was 
traded to the Phillies in 2009, then traded to the Seattle Mariners and 
Texas Rangers, and returned to the Phillies as a free agent in 2011. A 
four-time All-Star, Lee won the American League Cy Young Award in 2008 
as a member of the Indians after he led the American League in wins and 
lowest earned run average (ERA). Lee won his first straight seven postseason 
starts; as a Phillie going 4-0 in the 2009 postseason including pitching 
a complete game in 2009 World Series against New York Yankees, and next 
season with the Rangers where he shutout the Yankees 8-0 in the 2010 ALCS 
en route to reaching the 2010 World Series.[1] Lee is left-handed and throws 
three fastballs: a two-seam, four-seam and cutter. His pitches also include 
a slider, curveball and change-up. Lee was drafted by the Florida Marlins 
as the twelfth pick of the eighth round of the 1997 Major League Baseball 
draft out of Benton High School in his hometown of Benton, Arkansas, but 
instead chose to attend Meridian Community College in Mississippi. Later, 
Lee was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the twentieth round of the 
1998 amateur draft, but opted to attend the University of Arkansas instead.[citation 
needed] In the 2000 major league draft, he was chosen in the fourth round 
by the Montreal Expos and signed in July of that year. In 2002, Lee played 
for Double-A Harrisburg, and compiled a 7–2 record with a 3.23 ERA in the 
Eastern League by mid-summer.[citation needed] In June 2002, the Expos 
traded Lee (along with Brandon Phillips, Lee Stevens, and Grady Sizemore) 
to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for Bartolo Colón and Tim Drew.[2] 
Following the trade, Lee pitched seven games with the Akron Aeros before 
he went to the Buffalo Bisons. He compiled a 3–2 record with the Bisons 
before going to the Indians in September of that season. Lee made his major 
league debut in a start against the Minnesota Twins on September 15, 2002, 
giving up a lone run in 5.1 innings, resulting in a loss due to lack of 
run support.[3] He pitched once more that season, giving up one run in 
five innings against the Kansas City Royals, resulting in a no decision 
for Lee but a loss for the team.[4] Lee won at least fourteen games in 
each of his first three full seasons and pitched more than 200 innings 
in both 2005 and 2006. He finished the 2005 season with an 18–5 record 
and a 3.79 ERA, earning him fourth place in the AL Cy Young Award voting 
that year.[5] In 2006, the Indians gave him a midseason 3-year $14 million 
contract extension.[6] In 2007, Lee suffered a groin strain during a spring 
training start, forcing him to begin the regular season on the disabled 
list. He returned to the Indians' pitching rotation in May, but got only 
a 4–9 record and a 5.38 ERA in his first 16 starts. On July 21, Lee hit 
Texas Rangers' right fielder Sammy Sosa in the head with a pitch on the 
night when the Rangers were honoring Sosa for hitting his 600th home run. 
The incident sparked an altercation between Lee and Indians' catcher Víctor 
Martínez and led to a players-only meeting immediately after the game.[7] 
Lee encountered more problems on July 26, 2007, when he gave up seven runs 
in four innings against the Boston Red Sox. When he left the game, the 
fans booed him and he tipped his cap to the fans before he entered the 
dugout. The next day, on July 27, Lee was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo 
Bisons.[8] He was called back up on September 1 when rosters expanded, 
but only appeared in four games, all out of the bullpen.[citation needed] 
In 2008, Lee had a career year. Despite the Indians playing with a .500 
winning percentage for the season, Lee started the 2008 season with much 
success. Lee was one of only eight pitchers since 1920 to win 19 or more 
of his first 21 games. He was the first Cleveland pitcher to win his first 
six starts since Greg Swindell in 1988. He also recorded his first career 
shutout on April 25, 2008, against the Kansas City Royals, allowing just 
three hits and no walks.[9] He had the lowest On-base percentage since 
1909, having only a .163 percentage through five starts. For his efforts 
and success, he was named the American League Pitcher of the Month for 
April, when he went 5–0 with a 0.96 ERA.[10] Lee was picked to his first 
All-Star game in 2008, and was also selected to start the game. Lee pitched 
two scoreless innings for the American League team, striking out three 
batters and giving up only a Chipper Jones base hit.[11] On August 26, 
Lee won his 19th game of the season, yielding only two runs to the Detroit 
Tigers.[12] This victory set a new career high for Lee, outdoing his previous 
mark of 18 wins during the 2005 season. On September 1, Lee won his 20th 
game of the season, where he pitched a shutout. He was the first Indian 
to earn 20 wins since Gaylord Perry in 1974.[13] In August, Lee was named 
American League Pitcher of the Month for the second time in the 2008 season. 
He went 5–0 with a 1.86 ERA in the month. On September 12, Lee won his 
22nd game, making his record 22–2 for the season. This was the first time 
a pitcher had gone 20 wins over .500 since Bob Welch in 1990.[14] Lee ended 
the year with a 22–3 record, a 2.54 ERA, and 170 strikeouts. He started 
31 games, completed four, and had two shutouts. He pitched a total of 223⅓ 
innings. Lee was the American League champion for both wins and ERA in 
the 2008 season.[citation needed] Lee's 2008 winning percentage of 88% 
was the twelfth best of all time, and the fourth best by a pitcher starting 
a minimum of 30 games. He was behind only Randy Johnson, Ron Guidry, and 
Lefty Grove. Lee's winning percentage is the second best in the Indians' 
history, behind Johnny Allen's 93.8% (15 wins, 1 loss, in 24 games) in 
1937.[citation needed] Lee earned several awards following the 2008 season. 
These included the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award, the Players Choice 
Award for AL Outstanding Pitcher of the Year, Sporting News Pitcher of 
the Year Award, Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award, and the 
Warren Spahn Award for best left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. 
On November 13, 2008, Lee was awarded the AL Cy Young Award.[15] This made 
Lee the second straight Indian (and third overall) to win the award, following 
former teammate CC Sabathia, who won it in 2007.[citation needed] On June 
14, 2009, Lee pitched a no-hitter into the 8th inning in a game against 
St. Louis, striking out six and walking two. Lee allowed three hits in 
a complete-game shutout, improving his record to 4–6 and his ERA to 2.88.[citation 
needed] On July 29 (just before the July 31 trading deadline), the Indians 
traded Lee (along with outfielder Ben Francisco) to the Philadelphia Phillies 
in exchange for Carlos Carrasco, Jason Donald, Lou Marson, and Jason Knapp.[16] 
In his first game with the Philadelphia Phillies, Lee pitched a complete 
game and took a 5–1 victory. He pitched a no-hitter into the sixth inning 
and batted two hits, including his first career double and a run scored. 
Through his first five games with the Phillies, Lee compiled a 5–0 record, 
39 strikeouts in 40 innings pitched, and a 0.68 ERA.[citation needed] Charlie 
Manuel named Lee as the starting pitcher for the first game of the World 
Series. Lee had posted a 2–0 record in the first two rounds of the playoffs. 
Lee would be pitching against his former Indians teammate C.C. Sabathia.[1] 
Lee pitched a complete game in Game 1 of the 2009 World Series, winning 
the game 6–1 against the New York Yankees. He allowed no earned runs during 
this outing.[17][18] He was the first pitcher since Deacon Phillippe of 
the 1903 World Series to pitch a complete game in the World Series with 
ten or more strikeouts and no walks. However, Phillippe allowed two earned 
runs in his start, so Lee was the first to do so without allowing an earned 
run.[19] In his next start (Game 5), Lee earned another victory, allowing 
five runs and three walks while striking out three in seven innings. The 
Phillies won the game 8–6. Despite winning both of his starts, the Phillies 
lost the series in six games.[1] On December 16, 2009, the Phillies traded 
Lee to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for J. C. Ramírez, Phillippe Aumont 
and Tyson Gillies.[20][21] Lee appealed a five-game suspension imposed 
on him for throwing over the head of Chris Snyder during a spring training 
game.[22] Both the suspension and the accompanying fine were overturned.[23] 
Lee made his Mariners debut against the Texas Rangers on April 30, where 
he earned a no-decision in a 2–0 loss to the Rangers. He earned his first 
win with the Mariners on May 11, in a 5–1 win against the Baltimore Orioles. 
Lee pitched three consecutive complete games in June. He was picked to 
the 2010 AL All-Star team but attended as a Ranger. With the Mariners, 
Lee went 8–3 with a 2.34 ERA, an 0.945 WHIP, and an 89/6 K/BB ratio. Despite 
this, the Mariners were struggling, and Lee was placed on the trade market.[24] 
On July 9, after a deal with the New York Yankees failed, Lee was traded 
to the Texas Rangers along with Mark Lowe in exchange for Justin Smoak 
and prospects Blake Beavan, Josh Lueke and Matt Lawson.[25] On August 6, 
against the Oakland Athletics, Lee earned his 100th career win going eight 
innings and allowing only one run with seven strikeouts.[citation needed] 
Lee pitched Game 1 of the American League Division Series against Tampa 
Bay on October 6, 2010, the same day that Phillies' pitcher Roy Halladay 
pitched a no-hitter against the Reds in Game 1 of the National League Division 
Series. Lee pitched for seven innings. He gave up one run and struck out 
ten batters. There have been eight post-season pitching performances of 
at least ten strikeouts and no walks in baseball history, of which Lee 
has pitched the last four. Two of these were in the 2010 ALDS. In Game 
5 of the series, Lee set the ALDS series strikeout record and tied the 
MLB record with 21 strikeouts. He pitched a complete game, striking out 
eleven batters and allowing one run, earning a win.[citation needed] Lee 
continued his postseason mastery into the 2010 ALCS, when he allowed just 
two hits while striking out thirteen New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium 
in an 8–0 Texas victory in Game 3.[26] Lee has also become the first person 
to pitch three 10-plus strikeout games in one post-season.[27] However, 
facing the San Francisco Giants' Tim Lincecum in the 2010 World Series, 
Lee gave up seven runs (six earned) and did not make it through five innings. 
The Rangers lost the game 11–7.[28] Lee faced Lincecum once again in Game 
5 of the World Series with the Giants having a 3–1 series advantage. He 
gave up a three-run home run to Édgar Rentería, which resulted in a 3–1 
loss and the Giants winning the series.[29] On December 15, 2010, Lee signed 
a five-year and $120 million free-agent contract with the Phillies. The 
contract also included a vesting option for a sixth year.[30][31] He joined 
a pitching rotation consisting of Roy Halladay, Cole Hamels, Roy Oswalt 
and Joe Blanton. Commentators called it one of the best rotations ever 
assembled.[32][33][34][35] Halladay, Oswalt, Lee, and Hamels were dubbed 
the 'Phantastic Phour' by fans and the media.[34] In returning to the Phillies 
(despite the higher salary offered to him by the Yankees), Lee mentioned 
the chance to win a World Series ring, the strength of the staff, the chance 
to throw to a pitcher instead of a designated hitter in the National League, 
the regular sellouts, and the passion of the fans. He said "I never wanted 
to leave in the first place".[30] In Lee's first game back with the Phillies 
on April 2, 2011, he pitched seven innings, allowing four hits and three 
runs, while striking out eleven and walking none. On May 6, in a game against 
the Atlanta Braves, he struck out a career-high 16 batters, allowing three 
runs in a 5–0 Philadelphia loss.[36] On June 28, Lee pitched a third consecutive 
complete game shutout in a 5–0 victory over the Boston Red Sox.[37] Lee 
was awarded the National League Pitcher of the Month award for June 2011. 
Lee went 5–0 and had a 0.21 ERA. Lee pitched three consecutive shutouts 
and 34 scoreless innings. By the end of the month, he had also personally 
outscored teams he opposed (he scored two runs in the month while only 
allowing one run).[38] On July 9, Lee hit his first major league home run 
against Tommy Hanson of the Atlanta Braves after a ten-pitch at-bat. Although 
the Phillies lost the game 4–1, it was the first home run by a Phillies 
pitcher since Chan Ho Park in April 2009. Lee then went on to hit his second 
major league home run on August 9 against Ted Lilly of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. In the same game, Lee also recorded his 17th career double-digit 
strikeout game, resulting in a 2–1 Phillies win. [39] On September 26, 
2011, Lee was the winning pitcher in a 4–2 game against the Atlanta Braves. 
He pitched six innings, gave up five hits and two runs, struck out six, 
and walked none. He finished up the regular season with a 17–8 record, 
but more significantly helped the Philadelphia Phillies to a 100-win season. 
It marks the third time in franchise history that the Phillies have won 
100 or more games in a season.[40] He also led the MLB in shutouts with 
six, the most shutouts for any major league starter since Tim Belcher, 
who pitched eight shutouts in 1989 for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the 
postseason, despite having the best regular season for a second year and 
again tipped to win the World Series, the Phillies were eliminated by the 
St. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS. Lee started Game 2 where he surrendered 
five runs, as the Cardinals made a comeback from a 4-0 deficit to win 5-4. 
The Cardinals eventually defeated Lee's former team, the Texas Rangers, 
in seven games to win the World Series.[citation needed] Lee received poor 
run support throughout the entire 2012 season; particularly the first half. 
On April 18, in a game against the San Francisco Giants, Lee pitched ten 
shutout innings, but the Phillies eventually lost the game. On April 21, 
Lee was placed on the disabled list with an oblique strain. Despite pitching 
well throughout the spring, Lee didn't earn any wins until July 4 in a 
game against the New York Mets. He pitched eight innings, allowing two 
runs while striking out nine, resulting in a 9-2 road victory. Lee's streak 
of thirteen starts without any wins was the longest of any former Cy Young 
Award winner since Greg Maddux in 2008.[41] On September 17, Lee recorded 
his 1,500th career strikeout in a game against the New York Mets.[42] He 
finished the season 6-9, despite an ERA of 3.16 (which was below his career 
average) and the lowest walks per nine innings rate in the National League 
at 1.2. Lee started the 2013 season as the Phillies' third starter. In 
his first start against the Braves, he pitched eight scoreless innings 
and earned a win with a 2-0 Phillies' victory.[43] Lee was voted along 
with Domonic Brown to play in the 2013 MLB All-Star Game. He finished the 
season with a record of 14-8, an ERA of 2.87, 222 strikeouts, and a 1.3 
BB/9 rate, which was, once again, the best in the National League.[citation 
needed] After Cole Hamels was sidelined with an injury, Lee was named the 
Phillies' opening day starter, starting against the Texas Rangers.[44] 
He pitched five innings and earned a win, despite allowing eight runs. 
Lee was placed on the disabled list in May for a left elbow strain. He 
began to pitch again on June 10.[45] He was removed from the disabled list 
on July 21, only to come out of a game early on July 31, once again experiencing 
elbow discomfort. Lee made 13 starts in 2014 going 4-5 with a 3.65 ERA. 
On March 16, 2015, Lee was placed on the 60-day disabled list to start 
the 2015 season due to a left common flexor tendon tear, and missed the 
2015 season. After the season, the Phillies declined his $27.5 million 
option, paying him a $12.5 million buyout and making him a free agent.[46] 
On February 23, 2016, Lee's agent Darek Braunecker told Fox Sports that 
a return to pitching for Lee would take "a perfect situation", indicating 
that the offer he wanted was not forthcoming.[47] Lee's repertoire includes 
two fastballs (four-seam, two-seam) that reach 90-93 mph, an 85-88 mph 
cut fastball, an occasional slider, as well as a circle changeup and a 
curveball.[48] Lee usually appears stoic and confident on the mound. It 
is considered one of his greatest attributes when pitching in pressure 
situations.[49] Lee and his wife, Kristen, have a son, Jaxon, and a daughter, 
Maci. Jaxon was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of four months, but 
after undergoing treatments, is currently in remission.[50] The family
