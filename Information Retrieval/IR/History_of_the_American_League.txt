The History of the American League, officially known as the American League 
of Professional Baseball Clubs and often abbreviated AL, stretched back 
into the late-19th century. Prior to 2000, when the AL and NL were dissolved 
as separate entities and merged into the organization called Major League 
Baseball, the American League was one of the two leagues that made up major 
league baseball. Originally a minor league known as the Western League, 
the league later developed into a major league after the American Association 
disbanded. In its early history, the Western League struggled until 1894, 
when Ban Johnson became the president of the league. Johnson led the Western 
League into major league status and soon became the president of the newly 
renamed American League. The American League has one notable difference 
over the National League, and that is the designated hitter rule. Under 
the rule, a team may use a batter in their lineup who is not in the field 
defensively, compared to the old rule that made it mandatory for the pitcher 
to hit. The earliest predecessor to the American League was the Northwestern 
League, a minor league with teams based in the Midwestern United States.[1] 
Along with the National League and American Association, the Northwest 
League was one of the three leagues that signed the National Agreement, 
an agreement wherein the signers covenanted to honor contractual agreements 
between players and teams and set a minimum salary for players.[1] The 
league soon became known as the Western League, and went through financial 
woes, including disbanding multiple times.[1] Along with Ban Johnson, Charles 
Comiskey purchased the Western League in 1892.[1] Johnson hoped to clean 
up the sport of baseball by purchasing the league, including allowing umpires 
to suspend players who used profanity and disputed calls.[1] Johnson hoped 
to use his league as an example of a well-run league that was organized, 
profitable, entertaining and appealing.[1] In Johnson's first season at 
the helm of the Western League, 1894, most of the leagues' franchises turned 
a profit and by 1895 attendance began to climb for teams around the league.[1] 
In 1896, Johnson brought Connie Mack in as a manager of the Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin team and he became a major piece in what would soon be the American 
League.[1] The first signs that the Western League could become a major 
league appeared when the league began to attract many high caliber players 
and managers, and attendance ratings continued to climb.[1] Johnson and 
his associates Comiskey and Mack thought that they could make a move at 
becoming a major league by the turn of the 20th century, but knew that 
they would face the same struggles as the failed American Association.[1] 
During a fall meeting of Western League owners at Chicago's Great Northern 
Hotel in the Fall of 1899, the league's name was changed to the American 
League of Professional Baseball Clubs. At the time of the name change, 
the National League was struggling in attendance, while in comparison, 
the American League had a zero tolerance for foul language and behavior, 
bolstering attendance because of its image.[1] In The Arrival of the American 
League, author Warren N. Wilbert described the National League as having 
a monopoly on Major League Baseball at the time.[1] The Western League 
disbanded after the 1899 season so that owners Johnson and Comiskey could 
pursue major league options.[1] The Western League was re-created in a 
new form by a new owner. However, it had no association with the original 
league led by Johnson.[1] Johnson and Comiskey continued their hopes of 
creating a major league and by 1900, the duo created a franchise in the 
city of Chicago by moving the St. Paul Saints to that city.[1] The Chicago 
franchise, together with seven additional former Western League franchises, 
were established in Buffalo, Detroit, Indianapolis, Cleveland (moved from 
Grand Rapids), Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City.[1] Before the 1901 
season, the American League, often misprinted in news papers as the "American 
Association", was classified as a "special class", a level above Class-A 
minor league baseball.[2] Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Buffalo were dropped 
as franchises before the 1901 season and new teams added in Baltimore, 
Philadelphia and Boston.[3] The Kansas City club was moved to Washington, 
D.C. that same year.[3] The 1901 season was the first season that the American 
League (AL) was classified as a "major league". The AL comprised the Chicago 
White Stockings, Boston Americans, Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Athletics, 
Baltimore Orioles, Washington Senators, Cleveland Blues, and Milwaukee 
Brewers.[4] The AL lured many stars of the time due to the fact that they 
didn't have a maximum salary, unlike the National League.[4][5] Notably, 
Nap Lajoie was signed by Connie Mack to a $6,000 contract ($3,600 over 
the National League's maximum salary), $171Â thousand in today's standards.[4] 
Over the early years of the American League, they drew far more attendance 
to their games than the National League.[4] The Orioles fell into debt, 
with star player Joe Kelley reporting that the team owed as much as $12,000 
($328,754 in current dollar terms).[6] Unable to afford that debt, part-owner 
John Mahon began to purchase shares of the team in July 1902 from Kelley, 
his son-in-law, and player-manager John McGraw, who had resigned from the 
team and signed with the New York Giants of the NL. With this, Mahon became 
the majority shareholder. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold his interest in 
the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John 
T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That 
day, Freedman and Brush released McGinnity, McGraw, Kelley, Roger Bresnahan, 
Jack Cronin, Cy Seymour, and Dan McGann from their Oriole contracts. Brush 
then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, 
Bresnahan, Cronin, and McGann, joining McGraw, his new player-manager, 
on the Giants.[7] Johnson was forced to join with the Orioles' minority 
owners to seize control of the team using league rules and restock the 
team using players on loan from other AL franchises, but the Orioles had 
to forfeit their game that day due to not having enough players.[6] After 
the 1902 season, a "peace" agreement was reached by the two leagues.[4] 
The National League had hoped that a merger would form, however, Johnson 
knew he had the upper hand, and the National League recognized the league 
instead.[4] Following the regular season in 1903, the winners of the American 
League pennant and the National League pennant played each other in the 
inaugural World Series.[4] The Boston Americans (now the Red Sox) defeated 
the NL representatives, the Pittsburgh Pirates. In retaliation, the National 
League refused to play a World Series the following year, when the American 
League expanded its schedule to 154 games.[4] World Series play resumed 
in 1905 and has continued every year since, except the strike-shortened 
1994 season. During the 1919 World Series, members of the Chicago White 
Sox of the American League intentionally lost the series to make money 
off of the Cincinnati Reds win. The fix, which led to eight members of 
the team being banned from baseball for life, was put on by the White Sox 
first baseman Chick Gandil with the help of professional gambler Joseph 
"Sport" Sullivan and gangster Arnold Rothstein. It was stemmed from payment 
disagreements between the members of the team and its owner, Charles Comiskey. 
Amidst the Black Sox scandal, Ban Johnson's control of the American League 
slipped.[4] Johnson held the post until 1927, when he resigned and Ernest 
S. Barnard took over operations as the American League president.[4] Following 
the Black Sox scandal, the American League championed New York Yankees 
outfielder Babe Ruth.[4] In 1920, Ruth hit 54 home runs and drew many to 
the ball parks.[4] The American League sold five million tickets, over 
a million and a half over the National League total.[4] Ruth's 54 home 
runs was 35 above the runner-up, George Sisler.[4] Before the 1920s, pitching 
dominated both leagues.[8] In 1920, both leagues adopted new rules against 
defacing baseballs.[8] Led by Babe Ruth, hitters in the American League 
dominated the pitching competition.[8] Attendance was mostly even with 
the National League through the 1920s.[8] From 1927 to 1930, the National 
League beat the American League in attendance for the first time since 
the American League became a major league.[8] Through the 1930s, high scoring 
continued in the American League, unlike the National League where runs 
were becoming scarce.[8] In every year from 1931 through 1942, the American 
League outscored the National League.[8] From the same 12-year time period, 
the American League led in attendance six time while the National League 
led six times, despite the scoring dependency.[8] Like nearly everything 
else, Major League Baseball was affected by the United States involvement 
in World War II. Players off of every roster in the American League served 
in a branch of the United States Military;[9] of 144 major-league starters 
on Opening Day of 1941, only 26 were still in baseball by 1945.[10] More 
than a thousand current or former major-leaguers served in the military 
during the war.[11] One player, Elmer Gedeon, from the American League 
was killed in action.[9] Gedeon played outfield for the Washington Senators 
before he joined the United States Army in March 1941.[12] Notable players 
who served from the American League included Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, 
Hank Greenberg and Phil Rizzuto.[9] On the playing field, scoring was noticeably 
lower;[8] most players were over 35, or classified 4-F for physical disabilities. 
Due to material restrictions, baseballs were reused, unlike the previous 
years where the baseball's "sanitary" integrity was kept.[8] Jackie Robinson 
from the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers was the first African American 
major league player of the 20th century.[8] In the American League, the 
first player to break the color barrier was Larry Doby with the Cleveland 
Indians in 1946.[8] By 1955, there were still two all-Caucasian American 
League teams, the Detroit Tigers and the Boston Red Sox, compared to just 
one in the National League.[8] Writer Steve Treder from The Hardball Times 
noted that the fact that the American League employed fewer African Americans 
led to a discrepancy in talent, giving the National League the upper hand.[8] 
Over the time period of racial desegregation in baseball, the American 
League had better attendance than the National League for most of the seasons.[8] 
Starting in 1956, the National League began a 33-year streak of attendance 
superiority over the American League.[13] Treder again asserted that the 
American League failed to desegregate their league as fast and eagerly 
as the National League, however, he states that by the 1960s the American 
League started to catch-up.[13] Over the last half of the 20th century, 
the league expanded and teams changed locales. The St. Louis Browns relocated 
to Baltimore, Maryland and became the "Baltimore Orioles" in 1954 (the 
very first time a team actually moved east instead of south or west). After 
the '54 season the Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City, Missouri 
to become the "Kansas City Athletics" (before moving again to Oakland, 
California in 1968). After the 1960 season, the Washington Senators moved 
to Minneapolis to become the "Minnesota Twins". Two expansion teams began 
play in the AL for the 1961 season, the Los Angeles Angels and a new version 
of the Washington Senators (not to be confused with the aforementioned 
franchise). Two more expansion teams then began league play in 1969, the 
Kansas City Royals and the Seattle Pilots. After the Seattle Pilots' first 
season, they moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the "Milwaukee Brewers". 
The Senators then relocated to the DallasâFort Worth metropolitan area 
and were renamed the "Texas Rangers" after the 1971 season. Beginning in 
1977, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Seattle Mariners began league play. 
Before the 1998 season, the Milwaukee Brewers shifted to the National League 
while an expansion team, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays began play, eventually 
shortening their name to simply the "Tampa Bay Rays" before the 2008 season. 
Prior to the 2013 season, the Houston Astros shifted play from the National 
League to the American League. In the years before the Designated hitter 
rule was implemented, the American League was heavily outscored by the 
National League.[13] In 1973, a rule change adding a designated hitter 
on an experimental basis was added.[13] The rule added a batter designated 
to hit only, and not play defense. The old rule had the pitcher in the 
batting lineup. The National League still uses the old rule. Scoring in 
the American League jumped 23 percent and the "experimental" tag was dropped.[13] 
From 1973 to 2003, the American League out scored the National League.[13] 
Another jump in 1973 was the attendance numbers for the American League. 
Up 27 percent from the year before, the American League was still losing 
the attendance race to the National League after the implementation of
