Chester David Thomas (January 24, 1888 – December 24, 1953) was a backup 
catcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1912 through 1921 for 
the Boston Red Sox (1912–17) and Cleveland Indians (1918–21). Listed at 
5 ft 9.5 in (1.77 m), 173 lb., Thomas batted left-handed and threw right-handed. 
He was born in Camp Point, Illinois. The Red Sox signed Thomas in 1911 
but allowed him to play the 1911 season with the Sacramento Sacts before 
recalling him to the Major Leagues for the 1912 season.[1] He spent the 
1912 season as a little-used backup catcher for 1912 World Series championship 
Red Sox.[1] A fine defensive replacement, Thomas was the primary catcher 
for the Red Sox during three years, helping them to the World Championship 
in 1915 and 1916. In 1917 he led American League catchers with a .986 fielding 
percentage, but at the end of the season he was dealt to the Philadelphia 
Athletics, with two other players, in the same transaction that brought 
Joe Bush, Wally Schang and Amos Strunk to Boston. He did not appear in 
a game for the Athletics and was sold to the Indians. While in Cleveland, 
he won a third World Series ring in 1920. A good pinch-hitter as well, 
he hit .417 (13-for-31) from 1913 to 1918. In a 10-season career, Thomas 
was a .237 hitter (245-for-1035) with two home runs and 102 RBI, including 
88 runs, 27 doubles, eight triples, 12 stolen bases, and a .318 on-base 
percentage. In 423 catching appearances, he commiited 52 errors in 1,948 
chances for a .973 fielding percentage. He appeared as himself in the Paramount 
feature film Warming Up. Thomas died in Modesto, California at age 65.
