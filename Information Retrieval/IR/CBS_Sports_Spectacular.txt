CBS Sports Spectacular is a sports anthology television program that is 
produced by CBS Sports, the sports division of the CBS television network 
in the United States. The series began on January 3, 1960[2] as The CBS 
Sports Spectacular, and has been known under many different names, including 
CBS Sports Saturday,[3][4] CBS Sports Sunday,[5] Eye on Sports[6][7] and 
The CBS Sports Show.[8][9] The program continues to air on an irregular 
basis on weekend afternoons, especially during the late spring and summer 
months. Normally it airs pre-recorded "time-buy" sports events produced 
by outside companies, such as supercross or skiing competitions, or sponsored 
documentaries. Hosts of the program have included John "Bud" Palmer, Jack 
Whitaker, Brent Musburger,[10] Pat Summerall, Jim Kelly,[11] Dick Stockton,[12] 
Tim Brant,[13] Greg Gumbel, Pat O'Brien, Andrea Joyce and Michele Tafoya. 
Under its current format, the program does not have a regular host. An 
original composition by Edd Kalehoff featuring scat vocals was used as 
the theme for The CBS Sports Spectacular beginning in 1970.[14] From 1976[15] 
to 1978,[16] the Electric Light Orchestra's "Fire on High" was used as 
the theme for the program (when it was known as The CBS Sports Special). 
In 1979,[17] the program switched to an "in-house" version of American 
composer Aaron Copland's symphonic instrumental "Fanfare For The Common 
Man", which was used until 1980.[18][19] The CBS version of "Fanfare" – 
clocking in at 1 minute and eight seconds – was styled after the 9 minute, 
40 second version recorded by UK progressive rock group Emerson, Lake & 
Palmer on its 1977 LP, Works Volume 1. For CBS' Super Bowl XVI coverage 
at the end of the 1981 NFL season,[20][21] CBS' theme music would eventually 
become the theme for CBS Sports Saturday/Sunday. The music itself could 
be considered a hybrid of the theme used at the time for The NFL Today
