The Harvard Crimson are the athletic teams of Harvard University. The school's 
teams compete in NCAA Division I. As of 2013, there were 42 Division I 
intercollegiate varsity sports teams for women and men at Harvard, more 
than at any other NCAA Division I college in the country.[4] Like the other 
Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[5] 
The school has won national championships in men's football (12), golf 
(6), men's ice hockey (1), women's lacrosse (1), men's soccer (4), coed 
sailing (1), women's sailing (1), fencing (1), women's rowing (1), and 
men's individual wrestling (3)[needs update] . Harvard's baseball program 
began competing in the 1865 season. It has appeared in four College World 
Series. It plays at Joseph J. O'Donnell Field and is currently coached 
by Bill Decker. Harvard Crimson men's basketball program represents intercollegiate 
men's basketball at Harvard University. The team currently competes in 
the Ivy League in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) and play home games at the Lavietes Pavilion in Boston, Massachusetts. 
The team's last appearance in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament 
was in 2014, where they beat Cincinnati in the second round in a 12 to 
5 seed upset. The Crimson are currently coached by Tommy Amaker. The fencing 
team won the 2006 NCAA team championship in men's and women's combined 
fencing. Representing Harvard Crimson, Benjamin (Benji) Ungar won Gold 
in the 2006 Individual Men's Épée event at the NCAA Fencing Championship, 
and was named Harvard Athlete of The Year.[8] The football team has competed 
since 1873. They have won ten national championships when the school competed 
in what is now known as the FBS.[9] They are perhaps best known for their 
rivalry with Yale, known as "The Game". Sixteen former players have been 
inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Harvard's athletic rivalry 
with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax 
each fall in their annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875. While 
Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often 
was a century ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 
1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 
1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever 
permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's 
structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. 
Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in 
the sport, the Father of Football, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale 
football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the 
state-of-the-art Harvard Stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider 
playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support 
revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing 
the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's 
history.[10][11] In both 1919 and 1920, headed by All-American brothers 
Arnold Horween and Ralph Horween, Harvard was undefeated (9–0–1, as they 
outscored their competition 229–19, and 8–0–1, respectively).[12][13][14] 
The team won the 1920 Rose Bowl against the University of Oregon, 7–6.[15][16][17] 
It was the only bowl appearance in Harvard history.[18] Harvard has won 
six national collegiate team championships: 1898 (fall),[19] 1899, 1901, 
1902 (fall), 1903, and 1904. They have crowned eight individual national 
champions: James Curtis (1898, fall), Halstead Lindsley (1901), Chandler 
Egan (1902, fall), A. L. White (1904), H. H. Wilder (1908), F. C. Davison 
(1912), Edward Allis (1914), J. W. Hubbell (1916). They won the inaugural 
Ivy League championship in 1975, their only league championship.[20] The 
men's ice hockey team is one of the oldest intercollegiate ice hockey teams 
in the United States, having played their first game on January 19, 1898 
in a 0–6 loss to Brown.[21] Former head coach William H. Claflin and former 
captain George Owen are credited with the first use of line change in a 
game against Yale on March 3, 1923 when the Crimson substituted entire 
forward lines instead of individuals.[22] The men's ice hockey team won 
the NCAA Division I Championship on April 1, 1989, defeating the Minnesota 
Golden Gophers 4-3 in overtime.[23] The Cleary Cup, awarded to the ECAC 
regular-season champion, is named for former Harvard All-American hockey 
player, coach, and athletic director Bill Cleary, a member of the U.S. 
hockey team that won the 1960 Winter Olympics gold medal. The team competes 
in ECAC Hockey along with six other Ivy League schools and is coached by 
Harvard alumnus, Olympian, and former NHL forward, Ted Donato.[24] Harvard 
competes in one of the most heated rivalries of college hockey at least 
twice each season against Harvard's archrival, the Cornell Big Red, in 
installments of the Cornell-Harvard hockey rivalry. Cornell and Harvard 
are the most storied programs currently in the ECAC. Harvard became the 
first Ivy League institution to win a NCAA championship title in a women's 
sport, when its women's lacrosse team won the NCAA championship in 1990. 
The team was runner-up in 1989 and 1992. Older than The Game by 23 years, 
the Harvard-Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry 
between the two schools. It is held annually in June on the Thames river 
in eastern Connecticut. Both the Harvard heavyweight and lightweight teams 
are typically considered to be among the top teams in the country in rowing, 
having won numerous national championships in recent years. For a time 
the Harvard lightweight men's team had one of the "oddest" streaks in collegiate 
sports, having won the national championships in every odd year from 1989 
to 2003 (and in no corresponding even years).[25][26] The streak was broken 
when Harvard lost to Yale by almost 4 seconds in 2005.[27] The women's 
heavyweight rowing team were NCAA Champions in 2003. The Harvard Rugby 
Football Club is the college rugby team of Harvard. Founded in 1872, Harvard 
RFC is Harvard's oldest athletic team, and the oldest rugby club in the 
United States.[28][29] Harvard competes in the Ivy League,[30] and won 
the Ivy League Championship in 2007, 2003 and 1994, and were National Champions 
in 1984. In 2009, the men joined a newly established Ivy Rugby Conference 
that kicked off as a separate conference in Division 1.[30] Harvard added 
women's rugby as a varsity sport in 2013, increasing the number of sports 
the school offers to 42.[31][32] The NCAA classifies women's rugby as an 
emerging varsity sport. The Harvard team won the Leonard M. Fowle Trophy 
in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, and the dinghies Intercollegiate Sailing 
Association National Championships in 1952, 1953, 1959, 1974 and 2003, 
the women's dinghies in 2005, the sloops in 2001 and 2002, and the team 
race in 2002 and 2003. The team is currently[when?] ranked 11th nationally 
according to Sailing World.[33] Before the NCAA began its tournament in 
1959, the annual national champion was declared by the Intercollegiate 
Association Football League (IAFL) — from 1911 to 1926 — and then the Intercollegiate 
Soccer Football Association (ISFA), from 1927 to 1958. From 1911 to 1958, 
Harvard won four national championships. Women's soccer was elevated from 
a club to a varsity sport at Harvard in 1977. Bob Scalise, Harvard's current 
athletic director, was the first head coach. The team has won thirteen 
Ivy League Championships: 1978, 1979, 1981, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2008, 
2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2016. Currently the coaches are Chris Hamblin, 
Mike Calise and Kerry Baldwin. http://gocrimson.com/sports/wsoc/index Harvard 
Swimming and Diving was founded in 190230. Harvard Men's Swimming and Diving 
is currently coached by Kevin Tyrrell, Harvard Women's Swimming and Diving 
is currently coached by Stephanie Wriede Morawski31, 32, 33. Inaugural 
season for the men's team was 1981. The Crimson compete in the Eastern 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA) and are under the direction 
of head coach, Brian Baise. Inaugural season for the women's team was 1981. 
The Crimson compete in the Ivy League and are under the direction of head 
coach, Jennifer Weiss. Coach Ted Minnis heads both the Men's and Women's 
Water Polo teams, which compete in the Collegiate Water Polo Association. 
The teams both play in Blodgett Pool. Head coach Jay Weiss and his coaching 
staff have put the Harvard Wrestling program on the map. First established 
in 1913, the Harvard wrestling team is celebrating its 100th anniversary 
in 2013-14, making the Crimson one of the oldest collegiate wrestling programs 
in the nation. As part of that celebration GoCrimson.com has released the 
"Top Moments in Harvard Wrestling History" in collaboration with the Harvard 
Crimson Wrestling team. The team practices and competes in the Malkin Athletic 
Center. In 1938, The Harvard Wrestling team featured the program's first 
national champion, John Harkness. Jesse Jantzen ’04 graduated in 2004 as 
the most accomplished wrestler in Harvard history. The Crimson’s all-time 
leader in wins (132), win percentage (.910) and pins (50), Jantzen’s accomplishments 
also include: 2004 NCAA Champion, 2004 NCAA Most Outstanding Wrestler, 
3 Time NCAA All-American, 3 Time EIWA Champion, 4 Time NCAA Qualifier.[34] 
As of July 2, 2015, Harvard has 4 NCAA team national championships.[35] 
Below are 39 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: † 
The NCAA started sponsoring the intercollegiate golf championship in 1939, 
but it retained the titles from the 41 championships previously conferred 
by the National Intercollegiate Golf Association in its records. Men's 
conference championships Women's conference championships Harvard has several 
athletic facilities, such as the Lavietes Pavilion, a multi-purpose arena 
and home to the basketball teams. The Malkin Athletic Center, known as 
the "MAC," serves both as the university's primary recreation facility 
and as home to the varsity men's and women's volleyball, men's and women's 
fencing, and wrestling teams. The five-story building includes two cardio 
rooms, an Olympic-size swimming pool, a smaller pool for aquaerobics and 
other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held at all 
hours of the day, and an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and 
a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC also offers personal 
trainers and specialty classes. The MAC is also home to volleyball, fencing, 
and wrestling. The offices of several of the school's varsity coaches are 
also in the MAC. Weld Boathouse and Newell Boathouse house the women's 
and men's rowing teams, respectively. The men's crew also uses the Red 
Top complex in Ledyard, CT, as their training camp for the annual Harvard-Yale 
Regatta. The Bright Hockey Center hosts the ice hockey teams, and the Murr 
Center serves both as a home for the squash and tennis teams as well as 
a strength and conditioning center for all athletic sports. Other facilities 
include: Joseph J. O'Donnell Field[1] (baseball), Harvard Stadium (football), 
Cumnock Turf and Harvard Stadium (lacrosse), Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium[2] 
and Ohiri Field (soccer), and Blodgett Pool (swimming and diving, water 
polo). Harvard Undergraduate Television has footage from historical games 
and athletic events including the 2005 pep-rally before the Harvard-Yale 
Game. Harvard's official athletics website has more comprehensive information
