Bartolo Colón (born May 24, 1973) is a Dominican American professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. Nicknamed Big Sexy,[1] he has played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians (1997–2002), Montreal 
Expos (2002), Chicago White Sox (2003, 2009), Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
(2004–2007), Boston Red Sox (2008), New York Yankees (2011), the Oakland 
Athletics (2012–2013) and New York Mets (2014–2016). Colón won the American 
League Cy Young Award with the Angels in 2005, when he led the American 
League in wins. He is a four-time MLB All-Star. Entering the 2016 MLB season 
less than two months shy of his 43rd birthday, Colón is the oldest active 
player in Major League Baseball and also holds the distinction of being 
the last active Major Leaguer to play for the Montreal Expos.[2] Colón 
became the oldest MLB player to hit his first career home run at the age 
of 42.[3] Bartolo Colón grew up in a home without electricity, running 
water, or indoor plumbing in the town of Altamira in the Dominican Republic. 
He worked 12-hour days with his brothers, sister and father, Miguel, picking 
beans and fruit.[4] His mother's name was Adriana. He does major charity 
work for his old community.[5] The family could not afford balls or gloves 
so they substituted tightly wound rags for baseballs and milk cartons for 
gloves.[4] Bartolo Colón was signed by the Cleveland Indians as a free 
agent in 1993.[6] In 1995, pitching for Kinston of the Single-A Carolina 
League, he finished second in wins with 13 and ERA with 1.96, and led the 
circuit with 152 strikeouts. He was named the league's Pitcher of the Year, 
despite shutting down on August 1 with a bruised elbow. He was named the 
Indians' 1995 Minor League Player of the Year (receiving the "Lou Boudreau 
Award").[7] He played Triple-A ball with the Buffalo Bisons in 1997 and 
became the only player in team history to throw a no-hitter at Coca-Cola 
Field. Colón made his Major League Baseball debut at the Anaheim Angels 
on April 4, 1997, receiving a no decision.[8] In his first MLB season, 
Colón went 4–7 with a 5.65 ERA. The following year, he set the modern-day 
but unofficial MLB record for throwing the most pitches (20) in a single 
at bat on June 26, 1998[9] against Ricky Gutiérrez, who eventually struck 
out. Later that season, Colón won his only start of the 1998 American League 
Championship Series, pitching a four-hit, one-run complete game. In his 
1999 season, Colón finished 18–5, pitching over 200 innings with 161 strikeouts 
and a 3.95 ERA. On September 18, 2000, he tossed a one-hitter against the 
New York Yankees.[10] In 2000, Colón eclipsed his strikeouts number by 
51, ending with 212. He also posted a career-high 98 walks. Just prior 
to the 2002 trade deadline, Colón and Tim Drew were traded to the Montreal 
Expos in exchange for Lee Stevens, Brandon Phillips, and prospects Grady 
Sizemore and Cliff Lee. Colón finished 2002 with a combined 20–8 record 
and a 2.93 ERA, including 76 earned runs with 70 walks in 233 1⁄3 innings, 
three shutouts, and eight complete games. As of the 2016 season, Colón 
is the only active player to have played on the Expos. Before the 2003 
season, Colón was traded to the Chicago White Sox with minor leaguer Jorge 
Nunez for Orlando Hernández, Rocky Biddle, Jeff Liefer and cash.[11] A 
free agent after the season, he signed with the Anaheim Angels. Colón won 
18 games with Anaheim in 2004. During the 2005 season, he went 21–8 with 
a 3.48 ERA, and became the first Angels pitcher to win the Cy Young Award 
since Dean Chance in 1964.[12] Due to a partially torn rotator cuff that 
he received in a playoff game against the Yankees in 2005, Colón spent 
much of the 2006 season on the DL with soreness or inflammation in his 
right shoulder. In 10 starts, Colón went 1–5 with a 5.11 ERA. On April 
21, 2007, his first start of the 2007 season following his return from 
the DL, Colón pitched 7 innings, allowing one run on seven hits for his 
first win in 2007. On February 25, 2008, Colón signed a minor league deal 
with the Boston Red Sox and was invited to spring training.[13] On May 
15, 2008, Colón threw a one-hitter for the Red Sox' Triple-A team, the 
Pawtucket Red Sox. Six days later, Colón's contract was purchased by the 
Red Sox, and he was added to the active roster. Colón pitched his first 
major league game for the Red Sox on May 21, 2008, against the Kansas City 
Royals. Colón earned his 150th career win on June 11, 2008 against the 
Baltimore Orioles.[14] On September 19, 2008, Colón was placed on the suspended 
list by the Red Sox after leaving for the Dominican Republic to handle 
"personal matters" and deciding to stay, effectively ending his Red Sox 
career.[15] Colón was placed on the restricted list on September 25, 2008. 
Colón spent the post-season on the restricted list as the Red Sox won the 
2008 ALDS against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 4 games, but lost 
the 2008 ALCS against the Tampa Bay Rays in 7 games. He filed for free 
agency after the end of the 2008 season. Colón agreed to a one-year, $1 
million contract to return to the Chicago White Sox in January 2009, shortly 
after they had traded Javier Vázquez to the Atlanta Braves. He would compete 
for the fourth and fifth starters' positions in the White Sox rotation.[16] 
Colón made his comeback from off-season surgery to remove bone chips from 
his pitching arm elbow during the White Sox Spring training, in the Cactus 
League in Arizona. He was named as the White Sox fifth starter by manager 
Ozzie Guillén before the start of the regular season. He won his first 
start in his second stint in Chicago, pitching six strong innings of three-hit 
ball as the Sox blanked rivals Minnesota 8–0 on April 11, 2009. In doing 
so he became the first White Sox starting pitcher to win a regular season 
game in 2009. Colón then suffered another injury and did not pitch again 
for the remainder of the season. Colón has pitched 31 complete games, ranking 
11th among active players as of June 11, 2008.[17] Colón did not pitch 
in 2010 due to ongoing right shoulder and elbow pain and damage to the 
rotator cuff, ligaments and tendons.[18] In March 2010, he received a transplant 
of stem cells[19] to repair the damaged tissues in his right shoulder.[18] 
The orthopedic surgeon who performed the surgery said he had used human 
growth hormone in previous surgeries of the same type but not with Colón. 
The surgery was scrutinized by MLB but no wrongdoing was found.[20][21] 
Colón then played in the Pre-World Championship in Puerto Rico, winter 
ball with the Aguilas and the Leones del Escogido, and the Puerto Rican 
winter league.,[18] and announced that he would attempt a comeback to MLB 
for the 2011 season.[22] He signed a minor league deal with the New York 
Yankees on January 26, 2011. Colón was invited to spring training, competing 
for a spot on the 25 man roster, despite coming into camp 30 pounds overweight.[23] 
Colón was named to the Yankees' Opening Day roster in the bullpen. Colón 
made his first start for the Yankees on April 20, taking the rotation spot 
of the injured Phil Hughes.[24][25] Through the month of May, Colon was 
3–3 with a 3.26 ERA. On May 30, 2011, he threw a 4-hit complete game shutout, 
his first since 2006 against the Athletics. He sustained a hamstring injury 
on June 11, 2011, against the Cleveland Indians. When he was injured, he 
was in the 7th inning of a shutout game against the Indians, but he limped 
off the field after covering first base on a ground ball to Yankees first 
baseman Mark Teixeira. Colón then ended up on the 15-day disabled list. 
He said that he'd be back pitching right when he is eligible to.[26] On 
July 2, Colón returned to the Yankees and threw six shutout innings against 
the New York Mets. On July 14 against the Blue Jays, Colón lasted only 
after the first 2 outs in the first inning yielding 8 runs, the shortest 
outing of his career. Colón's 2011 season was somewhat of a resurgence, 
going 8–10 with a respectable 4.00 ERA and a WHIP of 1.29. Colón was demoted 
to the bullpen when the Yankees made the postseason and the team lost to 
the Detroit Tigers in the 2011 ALDS. On January 14, 2012, Colón agreed 
to a one-year, $2 million contract with the Oakland Athletics.[27] He started 
the second game of the season for the Athletics in the Opening Series in 
Tokyo, Japan, throwing 8 innings, giving up 1 run over 3 hits, with 6 strikeouts.[28] 
On April 18 Colón threw 38 consecutive strikes, the most since 1988, when 
the MLB began to collect pitching data in-depth, in a start against the 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[29] He started the 2012 season with a 3–1 
record and 2.64 ERA, but faltered with a 1–4 record and 5.80 ERA in his 
next seven starts.[30] Colón was suspended August 22, 2012, for 50 games 
by MLB after testing positive for synthetic testosterone, a performance-enhancing 
substance in violation of MLB's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. 
He was the second MLB player to be suspended within a two-week time frame 
for testosterone (the other being San Francisco Giants star Melky Cabrera).[21][31][32] 
The Athletics signed Colón to a one-year, $3 million deal for 2013.[33] 
He was selected for his third All-Star team in July after posting an 11–3 
record with a 2.78 ERA.[34] On December 11, 2013, Colón agreed to a 2-year, 
$20 million contract with the New York Mets.[35] On June 18, Colón got 
his first hit in 9 years when he hit a double off Lance Lynn. On August 
8, 2014, Colón recorded his 200th win in a 5–4 victory against the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[36] He is the third Dominican-born pitcher to do so, after Juan 
Marichal and Pedro Martínez, and the third pitcher to do so in a Mets uniform, 
after Orel Hershiser and Martínez. Colón finished the 2014 season with 
31 starts, 15-13 record, 202.1 innings pitched, 151 strikeouts, and a 4.09 
ERA while giving up 218 hits, 30 walks, 22 home runs, and 97 runs (92 of 
them earned). On Opening Day in 2015 against the Washington Nationals, 
Colón became the 3rd Opening Day pitcher that was over 40 years old to 
strike out 8 batters, after Cy Young and Nolan Ryan. On April 12, 2015, 
against the Atlanta Braves, Colón hit an RBI single off Alex Wood, his 
6th RBI of his career.[37] On April 23, 2015, Colón completed an unassisted 
pick off of Atlanta Braves catcher A. J. Pierzynski en route to becoming 
the first pitcher aged 40 years or older to win his first four starts in 
a season in the past 80 years. He also tallied one more RBI, on a double 
in May 31, 2015.[38][39] Colón became the first pitcher ever to record 
wins against one team (the Baltimore Orioles) for seven different clubs. 
Six pitchers held the previous record of six clubs.[40] On June 9, 2015, 
Colón set a new Mets franchise record of most consecutive decisions as 
a starting pitcher, achieving 26 decisions in 26 consecutive starts. This 
record was previously held by Dwight Gooden.[41] On September 5, 2015, 
Justin Bour of the Miami Marlins hit a chopper down the first-base line. 
Colón charged and made a behind-the-back flip to first for the out. Video 
of the play garnered widespread media acclaim.[42] In 33 games (31 starts), 
he finished the 2015 year with a 14-13 record and a 4.16 ERA. On October 
21, 2015, Colón pitched 1.1 innings in relief to earn the win in game 4 
of the NLCS and help the Mets to a sweep of the Chicago Cubs.[43] On October 
27, 2015, Colón pitched 2.1 innings in relief and took the loss at the 
end of game 1 of the World Series, becoming the oldest man ever to lose 
a World Series game.[44][45] It was his first World Series appearance since 
he was a rookie with the Indians back in 1997, and the Mets lost the series 
in five games to the Kansas City Royals. On December 16, 2015, Colón re-signed 
with the Mets on a 1-year, $7.25 million contract.[46] He entered the 2016 
MLB season as the oldest active player in Major League Baseball. He is 
also, following the retirement of Maicer Izturis, the last active MLB player 
who appeared for the Montreal Expos.[47] On May 7, Colón hit his first 
major league home run, against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park off of 
James Shields. At age 42 years and 349 days, Colón broke a record by becoming 
the oldest major league player to hit his first home run.[48] On June 21, 
Colón was injured when Whit Merrifield hit his pitch right to the pitcher's 
mound where the ball struck Colon in the thumb. He was immediately taken 
out of the game.[49] On July 8, Colón was named to the 2016 MLB All-Star 
Game, replacing Madison Bumgarner. On August 15, Colón drew a walk after 
having not been walked for the previous 281 plate appearances, achieving 
a new MLB record. On October 1, Colón became the 47th player all-time to 
make 500 career starts. Colón throws four pitches. Early in his career, 
Colón had excellent velocity on his four-seam fastball, throwing it in 
the mid 90s and occasionally touching 100 mph.[50] Currently, Colón's four-seamer 
sits at 86–91 mph, and he pairs it with a two-seamer at 84–88. This combination 
of fastballs makes up nearly 90% of Colón's pitches, but he also throws 
a changeup to left-handed hitters and a slider.[51] He is primarily known 
today as a control pitcher, with an exceptional ability to spot pitches 
at any location. This keeps walks to a minimum, but leads to more hits 
as he will throw strikes. Colón is known as Big Sexy by his teammates and 
the media.[52][53][54][55] Colon applied for a trademark on the Big Sexy 
nickname. He plans on making apparel out of it.[56] Colón's wife, Rosanna, 
and their sons, Bartolo Jr., Emilio, Wilder, and Randy, all live in Clifton, 
New Jersey. On September 30, 2014, Colón and his wife became US citizens.[57] 
Colón met his wife in the Dominican Republic when he was only 13 years 
old.[58] In 2015, Colón was sued in Manhattan by a Washington Heights woman 
seeking child support for her son and daughter, whom she alleges were fathered 
by Colón. The children were conceived and born during Colón's marriage.[58]
