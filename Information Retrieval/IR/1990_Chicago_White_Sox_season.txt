The 1990 Chicago White Sox season was the White Sox's 91st season. They 
finished with a record 94-68, good enough for 2nd place in the American 
League West, 9 games behind of the 1st place Oakland Athletics, as the 
White Sox played their final season at Comiskey Park before moving to the 
new Comiskey Park the next season. In the summer of 1990, Michael Jordan 
took batting practice at Comiskey Park.[1] The following year, Upper Deck 
created a baseball card of Michael Jordan and it was numbered SP1.[2] Bobby 
Thigpen had the best season of his career in 1990, setting the major league 
record of 57 saves. He also maintained a 1.83 ERA and was named to the 
AL All-Star team. He also blew eight saves that season, including two three-run 
leads. In anticipation of the move to new Comiskey Park, the White Sox 
adopted classic pinstriped uniforms late in the 1990 season along with 
the alternate black jerseys, instantly jumping to the top of the league 
in merchandise sales. Originally to be premiered in the 1991 season, the 
Sox sported the jerseys during their final days at the old ballpark. [1]

Park, Chicago, Illinois On July 11, 1990, as part of the celebration of 
Comiskey Park, the White Sox played a Turn Back the Clock game against 
the Milwaukee Brewers. The White Sox wore their 1917 home uniforms. This 
was the first Turn Back the Clock game in the major leagues and started 
what has become a popular promotion. The club turned off the electronic 
scoreboards and public address system. They constructed a special manually 
operated scoreboard in center field for the day and even the grounds-crew 
wore period costume. General admission tickets were sold for $0.50, popcorn 
was a nickel, and the stadium organ was shut down for the game. July 11,
