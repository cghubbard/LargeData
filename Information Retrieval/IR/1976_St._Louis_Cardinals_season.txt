The 1976 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 95th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and the 85th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
72-90 during the season and finished fifth in the National League East, 
29 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies. This was the twelfth and final 
season for Red Schoendienst as the Cardinals' full-time manager, although 
he would manage the club in parts of two later seasons (1980 and 1990). 
The Cardinals went to the Columbia blue road uniforms for the first time 
in '76. They would continue to wear those uniforms through the 1984 season.
