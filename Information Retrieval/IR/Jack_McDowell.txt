Jack Burns McDowell (born January 16, 1966) is a former Major League Baseball 
player. A right-handed pitcher, McDowell played for the Chicago White Sox, 
New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Anaheim Angels. Nicknamed "Black 
Jack", he was a three time All-Star and won the American League Cy Young 
Award in 1993. McDowell has also been a professional musician, most notably 
with the rock band, Stickfigure. McDowell attended Notre Dame High School[citation 
needed] in Sherman Oaks, California. He was drafted by the Boston Red Sox 
in the 20th round of the 1984 MLB draft but did not sign. He chose to attend 
Stanford University, where he was the co-Freshman of the Year in 1985, 
a 2nd team All-American in 1986 and a 3rd team All-American in 1987. He 
led the Cardinal to the 1987 College World Series championship. McDowell 
was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the first round (fifth pick) of 
the 1987 amateur draft. After only six games in the minor leagues, he made 
his Major League debut on September 15, 1987. He pitched seven shutout 
innings against the Minnesota Twins that day to pick up the win. In four 
starts, he was 3-0 with a 1.93 ERA. In 1988, he was 5-10 with a 3.97 ERA 
in 26 starts for the White Sox, but in 1989, while dealing with various 
injuries he did not pitch in the Majors, making 16 starts for the AAA Vancouver 
Canadians, where he was 5-6 with a 6.13 ERA. By the early 1990s, he had 
established himself as one of the most dependable pitchers in the game, 
pitching effectively and recording over 250 innings each season from 1991 
to 1993, he was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game each 
of those years. He won 20 games in 1992 and 22 in 1993, when he won the 
American League Cy Young Award and led the White Sox to the postseason 
(they lost in the 1993 American League Championship Series to the Toronto 
Blue Jays). From 1988 until 1995, his season ERA was consistently between 
3.00 and 4.00, well below the league average.[1] In 1993, he set a modern 
(post-1950) record by recording a decision in each of his first 27 starts.[2] 
After the 1994 season McDowell was traded to the New York Yankees for minor 
league pitcher Keith Heberling and outfielder Lyle Mouton.[3] McDowell 
spent one rocky season in New York with the Yankees was 15-10 with a 3.93 
ERA in 30 starts. He was perhaps best known for giving the finger to the 
fans at Yankee Stadium while being booed off the field after getting bombed 
by the White Sox on July 18, 1995 in the second game of a doubleheader.[4] 
McDowell was also the pitcher who gave up the walk-off, series-winning 
hit to Edgar Martínez in Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series, 
scoring Joey Cora and Ken Griffey, Jr. to eliminate the Yankees from the 
playoffs and send the Seattle Mariners to the American League Championship 
Series. McDowell spent 1996–1997 with Cleveland Indians. In 1996 he was 
13-9 with a 5.11 ERA in 30 starts but in 1997 he made only 6 starts due 
to an injury, which may have been made worse by his trying to pitch through 
it. He signed as a free agent with the Anaheim Angels in 1998 but was hampered 
with injuries during his time with the team. He was 5-7 with a 5.68 ERA 
in 18 starts over two seasons with Anaheim. He was released by the Angels 
after the 1999 season and retired from baseball. On January 29, 2014, McDowell 
announced on his Facebook page that he had been hired to manage the Los 
Angeles Dodgers Rookie League affiliate, the Ogden Raptors, in the Pioneer 
League (baseball). In 2015, he was named manager of the Arizona League 
Dodgers.[5] The Dodgers dismissed him after the season.[6] Even during 
his baseball career, McDowell played guitar in various groups in the alternative 
rock genre, usually performing during the baseball off-season. McDowell's 
first band, V.I.E.W., which consisted of him and fellow baseball players 
Lee Plemel and Wayne Edwards, had two albums, "Extendagenda" and "Replace 
The Mind." The band was formed in 1989 and disbanded in 1992. Their most 
notable accomplishment was touring with The Smithereens in 1992. His second 
band, stickfigure, consisted of McDowell, Michael Hamilton, Mike Mesaros 
and Frank Funaro. They produced the albums Just a Thought, Feedbag, Ape 
of the Kings and Memonto Mori, before the group disbanded in 2003.[7][8] 
In 2008, musicians Scott McCaughey (of The Minus 5), Steve Wynn, Linda 
Pitmon, and Peter Buck formed The Baseball Project to pay homage to America 
's greatest pastime. Their album Volume 1: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails 
contains the song The Yankee Flipper, a tribute to their friend Jack McDowell 
and a confession that a long night of drinking with the musicians may have
