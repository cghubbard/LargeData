Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an 
American film actor known for his natural, authentic, and understated acting 
style and screen performances. His career spanned thirty-five years, from 
1925 to 1960, and included leading roles in eighty-four feature films. 
He was a major movie star from the end of the silent film era through the 
end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed 
strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included 
roles in most major movie genres. Cooper's ability to project his own personality 
onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and 
authentic on screen. The screen persona he sustained throughout his career 
represented the ideal American hero. Cooper began his career as a film 
extra and stunt rider and soon landed acting roles. After establishing 
himself as a Western hero in his early silent films, Cooper became a movie 
star in 1929 with his first sound picture, The Virginian. In the early 
1930s, he expanded his heroic image to include more cautious characters 
in adventure films and dramas such as A Farewell to Arms (1932) and The 
Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935). During the height of his career, Cooper 
portrayed a new type of hero—a champion of the common man—in films such 
as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), Sergeant York (1941), 
The Pride of the Yankees (1942), and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943). In 
the postwar years, he portrayed more mature characters at odds with the 
world in films such as The Fountainhead (1949) and High Noon (1952). In 
his final films, Cooper played non-violent characters searching for redemption 
in films such as Friendly Persuasion (1956) and Man of the West (1958). 
He married New York debutante Veronica Balfe in 1933, and the couple had 
one daughter. Their marriage was interrupted by a three-year separation 
precipitated by Cooper's love affair with Patricia Neal. Cooper received 
the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in Sergeant York and High 
Noon. He also received an Academy Honorary Award for his career achievements 
in 1961. He was one of the top ten film personalities for twenty-three 
consecutive years, and was one of the top money-making stars for eighteen 
years. The American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Cooper eleventh on its 
list of the twenty five greatest male stars of classic Hollywood cinema. 
Frank James Cooper was born on May 7, 1901, at 730 Eleventh Avenue in Helena, 
Montana[1][Note 1] to English immigrants Alice (née Brazier, 1873–1967)[4] 
and Charles Henry Cooper (1865–1946).[5] His father emigrated from Houghton 
Regis, Bedfordshire[6] and became a prominent lawyer, rancher, and eventually 
a Montana Supreme Court justice.[7] His mother emigrated from Gillingham, 
Kent and married Charles in Montana.[8] In 1906, Charles purchased the 
600-acre (240 ha) Seven-Bar-Nine[9][10] cattle ranch about fifty miles 
(eighty kilometers) north of Helena near the town of Craig on the Missouri 
River.[11] Frank and his older brother Arthur spent their summers there 
and learned to ride horses, hunt, and fish.[12][13] In April 1908, the 
Hauser Dam failed and flooded the Missouri River valley along portions 
of the Cooper property, but Cooper and his family were able to evacuate 
in time.[14] Cooper attended Central Grade School in Helena.[2] In the 
summer of 1909, Alice, wanting her sons to have an English education, accompanied 
them to England and enrolled them in Dunstable Grammar School in Bedfordshire, 
where Cooper was educated from 1910 to 1912.[15][16][Note 2] At Dunstable, 
Cooper studied Latin and French, and took several courses in English history.[17] 
While he managed to adapt to the discipline of an English school and learned 
the requisite social graces, he never adjusted to the rigid class structure 
and formal Eton collars he was forced to wear.[18] After completing confirmation 
classes, Cooper was baptized into the Anglican Church on December 3, 1911, 
at the Church of All Saints in Houghton Regis.[19][20] Cooper's mother 
accompanied her sons back to the United States in August 1912, and Cooper 
resumed his education at Johnson Grammar School in Helena.[2] At the age 
of fifteen, Cooper injured his hip in a car accident and returned to the 
Seven-Bar-Nine ranch to recuperate by horseback riding at the recommendation 
of his doctor.[21] The misguided therapy left him with his characteristic 
stiff, off-balanced walk and slightly angled riding style.[22] After attending 
Helena High School for two years, he left school in 1918 and returned to 
the family ranch to help raise their five hundred head of cattle and work 
full-time as a cowboy.[22] In 1919, his father arranged for his son to 
complete his high school education at Gallatin County High School in Bozeman, 
Montana.[23][24] His English teacher, Ida Davis, encouraged him to focus 
on academics, join the school's debating team, and get involved in dramatics.[24][25] 
His parents would later credit her for helping their son complete high 
school, and Cooper confirmed, "She was the woman partly responsible for 
me giving up cowboy-ing and going to college."[25] In 1920, while still 
attending high school, Cooper took three art courses at Montana Agricultural 
College in Bozeman.[24] His interest in art was inspired years earlier 
by the Western paintings of Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington.[26] 
Cooper especially admired and studied Russell's Lewis and Clark Meeting 
Indians at Ross' Hole (1910), which still hangs in the state capitol building 
in Helena.[26] In 1922, Cooper enrolled in Grinnell College in Iowa to 
continue his art education. Cooper did well academically in most of his 
courses,[27] but was not accepted to the school's drama club.[27] His drawings 
and watercolors were exhibited throughout the dormitory, and he was named 
art editor for the college yearbook.[28] During the summers of 1922 and 
1923, Cooper worked at Yellowstone National Park as a tour guide driving 
the yellow open-top buses.[29][30] Despite a promising first eighteen months 
at Grinnell, he left college suddenly in February 1924, spent a month in 
Chicago looking for work as an artist, and then returned to Helena,[31] 
where he sold editorial cartoons to the Independent, a local newspaper.[32] 
In the autumn of 1924, Cooper's father left the Montana Supreme Court bench 
and moved with his wife to Los Angeles[33] to administer the estates of 
two relatives.[34] At his father's request, Cooper joined his parents in 
California on Thanksgiving Day, November 27, 1924.[33] In the coming weeks, 
after working a series of unpromising jobs, Cooper met two friends from 
Montana, Jim Galeen and Jim Calloway,[35][36] who were working as film 
extras and stunt riders in low-budget Western films for the small movie 
studios on Poverty Row on Gower Street.[37] They introduced him to another 
Montana cowboy, rodeo champion Jay "Slim" Talbot,[Note 3] who took him 
to see a casting director who offered him work.[35] With the goal of saving 
enough money to pay for a professional art course,[33] Cooper decided to 
try his hand at working as a film extra for five dollars a day, and as 
a stunt rider for twice that amount.[37] In early 1925, Cooper began his 
film career working in silent pictures such as The Thundering Herd and 
Wild Horse Mesa with Jack Holt,[38] Riders of the Purple Sage and The Lucky 
Horseshoe with Tom Mix,[39][40] and The Trail Rider with Buck Jones.[39] 
He worked for several Poverty Row studios, including Famous Players-Lasky 
and Fox Film Corporation.[41] While his skills as a horseman led to steady 
work in Westerns, Cooper found the stunt work "tough and cruel", sometimes 
resulting in injury to the horses and riders.[38] Hoping to move beyond 
the risky stunt work and obtain acting roles, Cooper paid for a screen 
test and hired casting director Nan Collins to work as his agent.[42] Knowing 
that other actors were using the name "Frank Cooper", Collins suggested 
he change his first name to "Gary" after her hometown of Gary, Indiana.[43][44][45] 
Cooper liked the name immediately.[46][Note 4] Cooper also found work in 
a variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked Cossack 
in The Eagle (1925), as a Roman guard in Ben-Hur (1925), and as a flood 
survivor in The Johnstown Flood (1926).[39] Gradually, he began to land 
credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as Tricks 
(1925), in which he played the film's antagonist, and the short film Lightnin' 
Wins (1926).[48] As a featured player, he began to attract the attention 
of major film studios.[49] On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with 
Samuel Goldwyn Productions for fifty dollars a week.[50] Cooper's first 
important film role was in The Winning of Barbara Worth (1926) with Ronald 
Colman and Vilma Bánky.[50] In the film, Cooper plays a young engineer, 
Abe Lee, who helps a rival suitor save the woman he loves and her town 
from an impending dam disaster.[51] Cooper's experience living among the 
Montana cowboys gave his performance an "instinctive authenticity", according 
to biographer Jeffrey Meyers.[52] The film premiered on October 14 and 
was a major success.[53] Critics singled out Cooper as a "dynamic new personality" 
and future star.[54][55] Goldwyn rushed to offer the actor a long-term 
contract, but Cooper held out for a better deal—finally signing a five-year 
contract with Jesse L. Lasky at Paramount Pictures for $175 a week.[54] 
In 1927, with help from established movie star Clara Bow, Cooper landed 
high-profile roles in Children of Divorce and Wings, the latter being the 
first film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.[56] That year, Cooper 
also appeared in his first starring roles in Arizona Bound and Nevada—both 
films directed by John Waters.[57] In 1928, Paramount paired Cooper with 
a youthful Fay Wray in The Legion of the Condemned and The First Kiss—advertising 
them as the studio's "glorious young lovers".[58] Their on-screen chemistry 
failed to generate much excitement with audiences.[58][59][60] With each 
new film, Cooper's acting skills improved and his popularity continued 
to grow, especially among female movie-goers.[60] During this time, he 
was earning as much as $2,750 per film[61] and receiving a thousand fan 
letters a week.[62] Looking to exploit Cooper's growing audience appeal, 
the studio placed him opposite popular leading ladies such as Evelyn Brent 
in Beau Sabreur, Florence Vidor in Doomsday, and Esther Ralston in Half 
a Bride.[63] That year, Cooper also made Lilac Time with Colleen Moore 
for First National Pictures, his first movie with synchronized music and 
sound effects.[63] It became one of the most commercially successful films 
of 1928.[63] Cooper became a major movie star in 1929 with the release 
of his first sound picture, The Virginian, which was directed by Victor 
Fleming and co-starred Mary Brian and Walter Huston.[64] Based on the popular 
novel by Owen Wister, The Virginian was one of the first sound films to 
define the Western code of honor and helped establish many of the conventions 
of the Western movie genre that have lasted to the present day.[65] According 
to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, the romantic image of the tall, handsome, 
and shy cowboy hero who embodied male freedom, courage, and honor was created 
in large part by Cooper in the film.[66] Unlike some silent film actors 
who had trouble adapting to the new sound medium, Cooper transitioned naturally, 
with his "deep and clear" and "pleasantly drawling" voice, which was perfectly 
suited for the characters he portrayed on screen, also according to Meyers.[67] 
Looking to capitalize on Cooper's growing popularity, Paramount cast him 
in several Westerns and wartime dramas in 1930, including Only the Brave, 
The Texan, Seven Days' Leave, A Man from Wyoming, and The Spoilers.[68] 
One of the more important performances in Cooper's early career was his 
portrayal of a sullen legionnaire in Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film Morocco[69] 
with Marlene Dietrich in her introduction to American audiences.[70] During 
production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated 
Cooper dismissively.[70] Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled 
directions at Cooper in German. The 6-foot-3-inch (191 cm) actor approached 
the 5-foot-4-inch (163 cm) director, physically picked him up by the collar 
and said, "If you expect to work in this country you'd better get on to 
the language we use here."[71][72] Despite the tensions on the set, Cooper 
produced "one of his best performances", according to Thornton Delehanty 
of the New York Evening Post.[73] In 1931, after returning to the Western 
genre in Zane Grey's Fighting Caravans with French actress Lili Damita,[74] 
Cooper appeared in the Dashiell Hammett crime film City Streets playing 
a westerner who gets involved with big-city gangsters in order to save 
the woman he loves.[75] Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two 
unsuccessful films: I Take This Woman with Carole Lombard, and His Woman 
with Claudette Colbert.[76] The demands and pressures of making ten films 
in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health, suffering from anemia 
and jaundice.[70][77] He had lost thirty pounds (fourteen kilograms) during 
that period,[77][78] and felt lonely, isolated, and depressed by his sudden 
fame and wealth.[79][80] In May 1931, Cooper left Hollywood and sailed 
to Algiers and then Italy, where he lived for the next year.[79] During 
his time abroad, Cooper stayed with the Countess Dorothy di Frasso at the 
Villa Madama in Rome, where she taught him about good food and vintage 
wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how to socialize among 
Europe's nobility and upper classes.[81] After guiding him through the 
great art museums and galleries of Italy,[81] she accompanied him on a 
ten-week big-game hunting safari on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa,[82] 
where he was credited with over sixty kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, 
and various antelopes.[83][84] His safari experience in Africa had a profound 
influence on Cooper and intensified his love of the wilderness.[84] After 
returning to Europe, he and the countess set off on a Mediterranean cruise 
of the Italian and French Rivieras.[85] Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long 
exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932[86] and negotiated 
a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 
a week, and director and script approval.[87] In 1932, after completing 
Devil and the Deep with Tallulah Bankhead to fulfill his old contract,[88] 
Cooper appeared in A Farewell to Arms,[89] the first film adaptation of 
an Ernest Hemingway novel.[90] Co-starring Helen Hayes, a leading New York 
theatre star and Academy Award winner,[91] and Adolphe Menjou, the film 
presented Cooper with one of his most ambitious and challenging dramatic 
roles,[91] playing an American ambulance driver wounded in Italy who falls 
in love with an English nurse during World War I.[89] Critics praised his 
highly intense and emotional performance,[92][93] and the film became one 
of the year's most commercially successful pictures.[91] In 1933, after 
making Today We Live with Joan Crawford and One Sunday Afternoon with Fay 
Wray, Cooper appeared in the Ernst Lubitsch comedy film Design for Living, 
based on the successful Noël Coward play.[94][95] Co-starring Miriam Hopkins 
and Fredric March,[96] the film received mixed reviews and did not do well 
at the box office.[97] Cooper's performance—playing an American artist 
in Europe competing with his playwright friend for the affections of a 
beautiful woman—was singled out for its versatility[98] and revealed his 
genuine ability to do light comedy.[99] Cooper changed his name legally 
to "Gary Cooper" in August 1933.[100] In 1934, Cooper was loaned out to 
MGM for the Civil War drama film Operator 13 with Marion Davies, about 
a beautiful Union spy who falls in love with a Confederate soldier.[101] 
Despite Richard Boleslawski's imaginative direction and George J. Folsey's 
lavish cinematography, the film did poorly at the box office.[102] Back 
at Paramount, Cooper appeared in his first of seven films by director Henry 
Hathaway,[103] Now and Forever, with Carole Lombard and Shirley Temple.[104] 
In the film, he plays a confidence man who tries to sell his daughter to 
the relatives who raised her, but is eventually won over by the adorable 
girl.[105] Impressed by Temple's intelligence and charm, Cooper developed 
a close rapport with her, both on and off screen.[103][Note 5] The film 
was a box-office success.[102] The following year, Cooper was loaned out 
to Samuel Goldwyn Productions to appear in King Vidor's romance film The 
Wedding Night with Anna Sten,[106] who was being groomed as "another Garbo".[107][108] 
In the film, Cooper plays an alcoholic novelist who retreats to his family's 
New England farm where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful Polish 
neighbor.[106] Cooper delivered a performance of surprising range and depth, 
according to biographer Larry Swindell.[109] Despite receiving generally 
favorable reviews,[110] the film was not popular with American audiences, 
who may have been offended by the film's depiction of an extramarital affair 
and its tragic ending.[109] That same year, Cooper appeared in two Henry 
Hathaway films: the melodrama Peter Ibbetson with Ann Harding, about a 
man caught up in a dream world created by his love for a childhood sweetheart,[111] 
and the adventure film The Lives of a Bengal Lancer, about a daring British 
officer and his men who defend their stronghold at Bengal against rebellious 
local tribes.[112] While the former was more successful in Europe than 
in the United States, the latter was nominated for six Academy Awards[113] 
and became one of Cooper's most popular and successful adventure films.[114][115] 
Hathaway had the highest respect for Cooper's acting ability, calling him 
"the best actor of all of them".[103] The year 1936 marked an important 
turning point in Cooper's career.[116] After making Frank Borzage's romantic 
comedy film Desire with Marlene Dietrich at Paramount—delivering a performance 
considered by some contemporary critics as one of his finest[116]—Cooper 
returned to Poverty Row for the first time since his early silent film 
days to make Frank Capra's screwball comedy Mr. Deeds Goes to Town with 
Jean Arthur for Columbia Pictures.[117] In the film, Cooper plays the character 
of Longfellow Deeds, a quiet, innocent writer of greeting cards who inherits 
a fortune, leaves behind his idyllic life in Vermont, and travels to New 
York where he faces a world of corruption and deceit.[118] Capra and screenwriter 
Robert Riskin were able to use Cooper's well-established screen persona 
as the "quintessential American hero"[116]—a symbol of honesty, courage, 
and goodness[119][120][121]—to create a new type of "folk hero" for the 
common man.[116][122] Commenting on Cooper's impact on the character and 
the film, Capra observed: As soon as I thought of Gary Cooper, it wasn't 
possible to conceive anyone else in the role. He could not have been any 
closer to my idea of Longfellow Deeds, and as soon as he could think in 
terms of Cooper, Bob Riskin found it easier to develop the Deeds character 
in terms of dialogue. So it just had to be Cooper. Every line in his face 
spelled honesty. Our Mr. Deeds had to symbolize uncorruptibility, and in 
my mind Gary Cooper was that symbol.[123] Both Desire and Mr. Deeds opened 
in April 1936 to critical praise and were major box-office successes.[124] 
In his review in The New York Times, Frank Nugent wrote that Cooper was 
"proving himself one of the best light comedians in Hollywood".[125] For 
his performance in Mr. Deeds, Cooper received his first Academy Award nomination 
for Best Actor.[126] Cooper appeared in two other Paramount films in 1936. 
In Lewis Milestone's adventure film The General Died at Dawn with Madeleine 
Carroll, he plays an American soldier of fortune in China who helps the 
peasants defend themselves against the oppression of a cruel warlord.[127][128] 
Written by playwright Clifford Odets, the film was a critical and commercial 
success.[127][129] In Cecil B. DeMille's sprawling frontier epic The Plainsman—his 
first of four films with the director—Cooper portrays Wild Bill Hickok 
in a highly fictionalized version of the opening of the American western 
frontier.[130] The film was an even greater box-office hit than its predecessor,[131] 
due in large part to Jean Arthur's definitive depiction of Calamity Jane 
and Cooper's inspired portrayal of Hickock as an enigmatic figure of "deepening 
mythic substance".[132] That year, Cooper appeared for the first time on 
the Motion Picture Herald exhibitor's poll of top ten film personalities, 
where he would remain for the next twenty-three years.[133] In late 1936, 
while Paramount was preparing a new contract for Cooper that would raise 
his salary to $8,000 a week,[134] Cooper signed a contract with Samuel 
Goldwyn for six films over six years with a minimum guarantee of $150,000 
per picture.[135] Paramount brought suit against Goldwyn and Cooper, and 
the court ruled that Cooper's new Goldwyn contract afforded the actor sufficient 
time to also honor his Paramount agreement.[136] Cooper continued to make 
films with both studios, and by 1939 the United States Treasury reported 
that Cooper was the country's highest wage earner, at $482,819 (equivalent 
to $8.23 million in 2015).[135][137][138] In contrast to his output the 
previous year, Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937, Henry Hathaway's 
adventure film Souls at Sea.[139] A critical and box-office failure,[140] 
Cooper referred to it as his "almost picture", saying, "It was almost exciting, 
and almost interesting. And I was almost good."[140] In 1938, he appeared 
in Archie Mayo's biographical film The Adventures of Marco Polo.[141] Plagued 
by production problems and a weak screenplay,[142] the film became Goldwyn's 
biggest failure to that date, losing $700,000.[143] During this period, 
Cooper turned down several important roles,[144] including the role of 
Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind.[145] Cooper was producer David O. Selznick's 
first choice for the part.[145] He made several overtures to the actor,[146] 
but Cooper had doubts about the project,[146] and did not feel suited to 
the role.[133] Cooper later admitted, "It was one of the best roles ever 
offered in Hollywood ... But I said no. I didn't see myself as quite that 
dashing, and later, when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection, 
I knew I was right."[133][Note 6] Back at Paramount, Cooper returned to 
a more comfortable genre in Ernst Lubitsch's romantic comedy Bluebeard's 
Eighth Wife (1938) with Claudette Colbert.[143][149] In the film, Cooper 
plays a wealthy American businessman in France who falls in love with an 
impoverished aristocrat's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth 
wife.[150] Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy 
Wilder,[151] and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert,[149] American 
audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer.[151] 
After all, It succeeded only in European market.[151] In the fall of 1938, 
Cooper appeared in H. C. Potter's romantic comedy The Cowboy and the Lady 
with Merle Oberon, about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love 
with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be 
a poor, hard-working lady's maid.[152] The efforts of three directors and 
several eminent screenwriters could not salvage what could have been a 
fine vehicle for Cooper.[153] While more successful than its predecessor, 
the film was Cooper's fourth consecutive box-office failure in American 
market.[154] In the next two years, Cooper was more discerning about the 
roles he accepted and made four successful large-scale adventure and cowboy 
films.[154] In William A. Wellman's adventure film Beau Geste (1939), he 
plays one of three daring English brothers who join the French Foreign 
Legion in the Sahara to fight local tribes.[155] Filmed in the same Mojave 
Desert locations as the original 1926 version with Ronald Colman,[154][156] 
Beau Geste provided Cooper with magnificent sets, exotic settings, high-spirited 
action, and a role tailored to his personality and screen persona.[157] 
This was the last film in Cooper's contract with Paramount.[157] In Henry 
Hathaway's The Real Glory (1939), he plays a military doctor who accompanies 
a small group of American Army officers to the Philippines to help the 
Christian Filipinos defend themselves against Muslim radicals.[158] Many 
film critics praised Cooper's performance, including author and film critic 
Graham Greene who recognized that he "never acted better".[159] Cooper 
returned to the Western genre in William Wyler's The Westerner (1940) with 
Walter Brennan and Doris Davenport, about a drifting cowboy who defends 
homesteaders against Roy Bean, a corrupt judge known as the "law west of 
the Pecos".[159][160] Screenwriter Niven Busch relied on Cooper's extensive 
knowledge of Western history while working on the script.[161] The film 
received positive reviews and did well at the box-office,[162] with reviewers 
praising the performances of the two lead actors.[163] That same year, 
Cooper appeared in his first all-Technicolor feature,[164] Cecil B. DeMille's 
adventure film North West Mounted Police (1940).[165][Note 7] In the film, 
Cooper plays a Texas Ranger who pursues an outlaw into western Canada where 
he joins forces with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who are after the 
same man, a leader of the North-West Rebellion.[167] While not as popular 
with critics as its predecessor,[168] the film was another box-office success—the 
sixth-highest-grossing film of 1940.[162][169] The early 1940s were Cooper's 
prime years as an actor.[170] In a relatively short period, he appeared 
in five critically successful and popular films that produced some of his 
finest performances.[170] When Frank Capra offered him the lead role in 
Meet John Doe before Robert Riskin even developed the script, Cooper accepted 
his friend's offer, saying, "It's okay, Frank, I don't need a script."[171] 
In the film, Cooper plays Long John Willoughby, a down-and-out bush-league 
pitcher hired by a newspaper to pretend to be a man who promises to commit 
suicide on Christmas Eve to protest all the hypocrisy and corruption in 
the country.[172] Considered by some critics to be Capra's best film at 
the time,[173] Meet John Doe was received as a "national event"[173] with 
Cooper appearing on the front cover of Time magazine on March 3, 1941.[174] 
In his review in the New York Herald Tribune, Howard Barnes called Cooper's 
performance a "splendid and utterly persuasive portrayal"[175] and praised 
his "utterly realistic acting which comes through with such authority".[174] 
Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, wrote, "Gary Cooper, of course, 
is 'John Doe' to the life and in the whole—shy, bewildered, non-aggressive, 
but a veritable tiger when aroused."[176] That same year, Cooper made two 
films with director and good friend Howard Hawks.[177] In the biographical 
film Sergeant York, Cooper portrays war hero Alvin C. York,[178] one of 
the most decorated American soldiers in World War I.[179] The film chronicles 
York's early backwoods days in Tennessee, his religious conversion and 
subsequent piety, his stand as a conscientious objector, and finally his 
heroic actions at the Battle of the Argonne Forest, which earned him the 
Medal of Honor.[178][180] Initially, Cooper was nervous and uncertain about 
playing a living hero, so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his 
home, and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered 
they had much in common.[181] Inspired by York's encouragement, Cooper 
delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune 
called "one of extraordinary conviction and versatility", and that Archer 
Winston of the New York Post called "one of his best".[182] After the film's 
release, Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars for his "powerful contribution to the promotion 
of patriotism and loyalty".[183] York admired Cooper's performance and 
helped promote the film for Warner Bros.[184] Sergeant York became the 
top-grossing film of the year and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards.[183][185] 
Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend James 
Stewart, Cooper said, "It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award. Shucks, 
I've been in the business sixteen years and sometimes dreamed I might get 
one of these. That's all I can say ... Funny when I was dreaming I always 
made a better speech."[185] Cooper concluded the year back at Goldwyn with 
Howard Hawks to make the romantic comedy Ball of Fire with Barbara Stanwyck.[186] 
In the film, Cooper plays a shy linguistics professor who leads a team 
of seven scholars who are writing an encyclopedia. While researching slang, 
he meets Stanwyck's flirtatious burlesque stripper Sugarpuss O'Shea who 
blows the dust off their staid life of books.[187] The screenplay by Charles 
Brackett and Billy Wilder provided Cooper the opportunity to exercise the 
full range of his light comedy skills.[187] In his review for the New York 
Herald Tribune, Howard Barnes wrote that Cooper handled the role with "great 
skill and comic emphasis" and that his performance was "utterly delightful".[188] 
Though small in scale, Ball of Fire was one of the top-grossing films of 
the year[189]—Cooper's fourth consecutive picture to make the top twenty.[189] 
Cooper's only film appearance in 1942 was also his last under his Goldwyn 
contract.[190] In Sam Wood's biographical film The Pride of the Yankees,[191] 
Cooper portrays baseball star Lou Gehrig who established a record with 
the New York Yankees for playing in 2,130 consecutive games.[192] Cooper 
was reluctant to play the seven-time All-Star, who only died the previous 
year from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) —now commonly called "Lou 
Gehrig's disease".[193] Beyond the challenges of effectively portraying 
such a popular and nationally recognized figure, Cooper knew very little 
about baseball[194] and was not left-handed like Gehrig.[193] After Gehrig's 
widow visited the actor and expressed her desire that he portray her husband,[193] 
Cooper accepted the role that covered a twenty-year span of Gehrig's life—his 
early love of baseball, his rise to greatness, his loving marriage, and 
his struggle with illness, culminating in his farewell speech at Yankee 
Stadium on July 4, 1939 before 62,000 fans.[195] Cooper quickly learned 
the physical movements of a baseball player and developed a fluid, believable 
swing.[196] The handedness issue was solved by reversing the print for 
certain batting scenes.[197] The film was one of the year's top ten pictures[198] 
and received eleven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and 
Best Actor (Cooper's third).[199] Soon after the publication of Ernest 
Hemingway's novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, Paramount paid $150,000 for 
the film rights with the express intent of casting Cooper in the lead role 
of Robert Jordan,[200] an American explosives expert who fights alongside 
the Republican loyalists during the Spanish Civil War.[201] The original 
director, Cecil B. DeMille, was replaced by Sam Wood who brought in Dudley 
Nichols for the screenplay.[200] After the start of principal photography 
in the Sierra Nevada in late 1942, Ingrid Bergman was brought in to replace 
ballerina Vera Zorina as the female lead—a change supported by Cooper and 
Hemingway.[202] The love scenes between Bergman and Cooper were "rapturous" 
and passionate.[203][204] Howard Barnes in the New York Herald Tribune 
wrote that both actors performed with "the true stature and authority of 
stars".[205] While the film distorted the novel's original political themes 
and meaning,[206][207] For Whom the Bell Tolls was a critical and commercial 
success and received ten Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture 
and Best Actor (Cooper's fourth).[204] Cooper did not serve in the military 
during World War II due to his age and health,[170] but like many of his 
colleagues, he got involved in the war effort by entertaining the troops.[198] 
In June 1943, he visited military hospitals in San Diego,[198] and often 
appeared at the Hollywood Canteen serving food to the servicemen.[208] 
In late 1943, Cooper undertook a 23,000-mile (37,000 km) tour of the South 
West Pacific with actresses Una Merkel and Phyllis Brooks, and accordionist 
Andy Arcari.[198][208][209] Traveling on a B-24A Liberator bomber,[198] 
the group toured the Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, Queensland, Brisbane—where 
General Douglas MacArthur told Cooper he was watching Sergeant York in 
a Manila theater when Japanese bombs began falling[198]—New Guinea, Jayapura, 
and throughout the Solomon Islands.[210] The group often shared the same 
sparse living conditions and K-rations as the troops.[211] Cooper met with 
the servicemen and women, visited military hospitals, introduced his attractive 
colleagues, and participated in occasional skits.[211] The shows concluded 
with Cooper's moving recitation of Lou Gehrig's farewell speech.[211] When 
he returned to the United States, he visited military hospitals throughout 
the country.[211] Cooper later called his time with the troops the "greatest 
emotional experience" of his life.[209] In 1944, Cooper appeared in Cecil 
B. DeMille's wartime adventure film The Story of Dr. Wassell with Laraine 
Day—his third movie with the director.[212] In the film, Cooper plays American 
doctor and missionary Corydon M. Wassell, who leads a group of wounded 
sailors through the jungles of Java to safety.[213] Despite receiving poor 
reviews, Dr. Wassell was one of the top-grossing films of the year.[214] 
With his Goldwyn and Paramount contracts now concluded, Cooper decided 
to remain independent and formed his own production company, International 
Pictures, with Leo Spitz, William Goetz, and Nunnally Johnson.[215] The 
fledgling studio's first offering was Sam Wood's romantic comedy Casanova 
Brown with Teresa Wright, about a man who learns his soon-to-be ex-wife 
is pregnant with his child, just as he is about to marry another woman.[216] 
The film received poor reviews,[217] with the New York Daily News calling 
it "delightful nonsense",[218] and Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, 
criticizing Cooper's "somewhat obvious and ridiculous clowning".[219] The 
film was barely profitable.[220] In 1945, Cooper starred in and produced 
Stuart Heisler's Western comedy Along Came Jones with Loretta Young for 
International.[221] In this lighthearted parody of his past heroic image,[222] 
Cooper plays comically inept cowboy Melody Jones who is mistaken for a 
ruthless killer.[222] Audiences embraced Cooper's character, and the film 
was one of the top box-office pictures of the year—a testament to Cooper's 
still vital audience appeal.[223] It was also International's biggest financial 
success during its brief history before being sold off to Universal Studios 
in 1946.[224] Cooper's career during the post-war years drifted in new 
directions as American society was changing.[225] While he still played 
conventional heroic roles, his films now relied less on his heroic screen 
persona and more on novel stories and exotic settings.[226] In November 
1945, Cooper appeared in Sam Wood's nineteenth century period drama Saratoga 
Trunk with Ingrid Bergman, about a Texas cowboy and his relationship with 
a beautiful fortune-hunter.[227] Filmed in early 1943, the movie's release 
was delayed for two years due to the increased demand for war movies.[228] 
Despite poor reviews, Saratoga Trunk did well at the box office[229] and 
became one of the top money-makers of the year for Warner Bros.[230] Cooper's 
only film in 1946 was Fritz Lang's romantic thriller Cloak and Dagger, 
about a mild-mannered physics professor recruited by the OSS during the 
last years of World War II to investigate the German atomic bomb program.[231] 
Playing a part loosely based on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer,[232] Cooper 
was uneasy with the role and was unable to convey the "inner sense" of 
the character.[233] The film received poor reviews and was a box-office 
failure.[234] In 1947, Cooper appeared in Cecil B. DeMille's epic adventure 
film Unconquered with Paulette Goddard, about a Virginia militiaman who 
defends settlers against an unscrupulous gun trader and hostile Indians 
on the Western frontier during the eighteenth century.[235] The film received 
mixed reviews, but even long-time DeMille critic James Agee acknowledged 
the picture had "some authentic flavor of the period".[236] This last of 
four films made with DeMille was Cooper's most lucrative, earning the actor 
over $300,000 in salary and percentage of profits.[237] Unconquered would 
be his last unqualified box-office success for the next five years.[236] 
In 1948, after making Leo McCarey's romantic comedy Good Sam,[238] Cooper 
sold his company to Universal Studios and signed a long-term contract with 
Warner Bros. that gave him script and director approval and a guaranteed 
$295,000 per picture.[239] His first film under the new contract was King 
Vidor's drama The Fountainhead (1949) with Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey.[240] 
In the film, Cooper plays an idealistic and uncompromising architect who 
struggles to maintain his integrity and individualism in the face of societal 
pressures to conform to popular standards.[241] Based on the novel by Ayn 
Rand who also wrote the screenplay, the film reflects her Objectivist philosophy 
and attacks the concepts of altruism and collectivism while promoting the 
virtues of selfishness and individualism.[242] For most critics, Cooper 
was hopelessly miscast in the role of Howard Roark.[243] In his review 
for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther concluded he was "Mr. Deeds out 
of his element".[244] Cooper returned to his element in Delmer Daves' war 
drama Task Force (1949), about a retiring rear admiral who reminisces about 
his long career as a naval aviator and his role in the development of aircraft 
carriers.[245] Cooper's performance and the Technicolor newsreel footage 
supplied by the United States Navy made the film one of Cooper's most popular 
during this period.[246] In the next two years, Cooper made four poorly 
received films: Michael Curtiz' period drama Bright Leaf (1950), Stuart 
Heisler's Western melodrama Dallas (1950), Henry Hathaway's wartime comedy 
You're in the Navy Now (1951), and Raoul Walsh's Western action film Distant 
Drums (1951).[247] Cooper's most important film during the post-war years 
was Fred Zinnemann's Western drama High Noon (1952) with Grace Kelly for 
United Artists.[248] In the film, Cooper plays retiring sheriff Will Kane 
who is preparing to leave town on his honeymoon when he learns that an 
outlaw he helped put away and his three henchmen are returning to seek 
their revenge. Unable to gain the support of the frightened townspeople, 
and abandoned by his young bride, Kane nevertheless stays to face the outlaws 
alone.[249] During the filming, Cooper was in poor health and in considerable 
pain from stomach ulcers.[250] His ravaged face and discomfort in some 
scenes "photographed as self-doubt", according to biographer Hector Arce,[251] 
and contributed to the effectiveness of his performance.[250] Considered 
one of the first "adult" Westerns for its theme of moral courage,[252] 
High Noon received enthusiastic reviews for its artistry, with Time magazine 
placing it in the ranks of Stagecoach and The Gunfighter.[253] Bosley Crowther, 
in The New York Times, wrote that Cooper was "at the top of his form",[254] 
and John McCarten, in The New Yorker, wrote that Cooper was never more 
effective.[255] The film earned $3.75 million in the United States[253] 
and $18 million worldwide.[256] Following the example of his friend James 
Stewart,[257] Cooper accepted a lower salary in exchange for a percent 
of the profits, and ended up making $600,000.[256] Cooper's understated 
performance was widely praised,[251][255] and earned him his second Academy 
Award for Best Actor.[258][Note 8] After appearing in André de Toth's Civil 
War drama Springfield Rifle (1952)[260]—a standard Warner Bros. film that 
was overshadowed by the success of its predecessor[261]—Cooper made four 
films outside the United States.[262] In Mark Robson's drama Return to 
Paradise (1953), Cooper plays an American wanderer who liberates the inhabitants 
of a Polynesian island from the puritanical rule of a misguided pastor.[263] 
Cooper endured spartan living conditions, long hours, and ill health during 
the three-month location shoot on the island of Upolu in Western Samoa.[264] 
Despite its beautiful cinematography, the film received poor reviews.[265] 
Cooper's next three films were shot in Mexico.[262] In Hugo Fregonese's 
action adventure film Blowing Wild (1953) with Barbara Stanwyck, he plays 
a wildcatter in Mexico who gets involved with an oil company executive 
and his unscrupulous wife with whom he once had an affair.[266] In 1954, 
Cooper appeared in Henry Hathaway's Western drama Garden of Evil with Susan 
Hayward, about three soldiers of fortune in Mexico hired to rescue a woman's 
husband.[267] That same year, he appeared in Robert Aldrich's Western adventure 
Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster. In the film, Cooper plays an American adventurer 
hired by Emperor Maximilian I to escort a countess to Vera Cruz during 
the Mexican Rebellion of 1866.[268] All of these films received poor reviews 
but did well at the box-office.[269] For his work in Vera Cruz, Cooper 
earned $1.4 million in salary and percent of the gross.[270] During this 
period, Cooper struggled with health problems. As well as his ongoing treatment 
for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of 
Blowing Wild when he was hit by metal fragments from a dynamited oil well.[270] 
During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, 
and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding 
from the blank shell pierced his clothing.[270] In 1955, he appeared in 
Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, 
about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials 
of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the 
War Department for a series of air disasters.[271] Some critics felt that 
Cooper was miscast,[272] and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did 
not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality.[273] In 1956, Cooper 
was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil 
War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire.[274] Like Sergeant 
York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism 
and civic duty.[275] For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden 
Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor.[276] The film was nominated 
for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film 
Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.[275][277] In 1956, 
Cooper traveled to France to make Billy Wilder's romantic comedy Love in 
the Afternoon with Audrey Hepburn and Maurice Chevalier.[278] In the film, 
Cooper plays a middle-aged American playboy in Paris who pursues and eventually 
falls in love with a much younger woman.[279] Despite receiving some positive 
reviews—including from Bosley Crowther who praised the film's "charming 
performances"[280]—most reviewers concluded that Cooper was simply too 
old for the part.[281] While audiences may not have welcomed seeing Cooper's 
heroic screen image tarnished by his playing an aging roué trying to seduce 
an innocent young girl, the film was still a box-office success.[281] The 
following year, Cooper appeared in Philip Dunne's romantic drama Ten North 
Frederick[282] In the film, which was based on the novel by John O'Hara,[283] 
Cooper plays an attorney whose life is ruined by a double-crossing politician 
and his own secret affair with his daughter's young roommate.[282] While 
Cooper brought "conviction and controlled anguish" to his performance, 
according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers,[283] it was not enough to save 
what Bosley Crowther called a "hapless film".[284] Despite his ongoing 
health problems and several operations for ulcers and hernias, Cooper continued 
to work in action films.[285] In 1958, he appeared in Anthony Mann's Western 
drama Man of the West (1958) with Julie London and Lee J. Cobb, about a 
reformed outlaw and killer who is forced to confront his violent past when 
the train he is riding in is held up by his former gang members.[286] The 
film has been called Cooper's "most pathological Western", with its themes 
of impotent rage, sexual humiliation, and sadism.[283] According to biographer 
Jeffrey Meyers, Cooper, who struggled with moral conflicts in his personal 
life, "understood the anguish of a character striving to retain his integrity 
... [and] brought authentic feeling to the role of a tempted and tormented, 
yet essentially decent man".[287] Mostly ignored by critics at the time, 
the film is now well-regarded by film scholars[288] and is considered Cooper's 
last great film.[284] After his Warner Bros. contract ended, Cooper formed 
his own production company, Baroda Productions, and made three unusual 
films in 1959 about redemption.[289] In Delmer Daves' Western drama The 
Hanging Tree, Cooper plays a frontier doctor who saves a criminal from 
a lynch mob, and later tries to exploit his sordid past.[290] Cooper delivered 
a "powerful and persuasive" performance of an emotionally scarred man whose 
need to dominate others is transformed by the love and sacrifice of a woman.[291] 
In Robert Rossen's historical adventure They Came to Cordura with Rita 
Hayworth, he plays an army officer who is found guilty of cowardice and 
assigned the degrading task of recommending soldiers for the Medal of Honor 
during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916.[292] While Cooper received 
positive reviews, Variety and Films in Review felt he was too old for the 
part.[293] In Michael Anderson's action drama The Wreck of the Mary Deare 
with Charlton Heston, Cooper plays a disgraced merchant marine officer 
who decides to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship in order to prove the 
vessel was deliberately scuttled and to redeem his good name.[294] Like 
its two predecessors, the film was physically demanding.[295] Cooper, who 
was a trained scuba diver, did most of his own underwater scenes.[295] 
Biographer Jeffrey Meyers observed that in all three roles, Cooper effectively 
conveyed the sense of lost honor and desire for redemption[296]—what Joseph 
Conrad in Lord Jim called the "struggles of an individual trying to save 
from the fire his idea of what his moral identity should be".[296][297] 
Cooper was formally introduced to his future wife, twenty-year-old New 
York debutante Veronica Balfe,[Note 9] on Easter Sunday 1933 at a party 
given by her uncle, art director Cedric Gibbons.[299][300][301] Called 
"Rocky" by her family and friends, she grew up on Park Avenue and attended 
finishing schools.[302] Her stepfather was Wall Street tycoon Paul Shields.[302] 
Cooper and Rocky were quietly married at her parents' Park Avenue residence 
on December 15, 1933.[303] According to his friends, the marriage had a 
positive impact on Cooper, who turned away from past indiscretions and 
took control of his life.[304] Athletic and a lover of the outdoors, Rocky 
shared many of Cooper's interests, including riding, skiing, and skeet-shooting.[305] 
She organized their social life, and her wealth and social connections 
provided Cooper access to New York high society.[306] Cooper and his wife 
owned homes in the Los Angeles area in Encino (1933–36),[304] Brentwood 
(1936–53),[304] and Holmby Hills (1954–61),[307] and owned a vacation home 
in Aspen, Colorado (1949–53).[308][Note 10] Cooper's daughter Maria Veronica 
Cooper was born on September 15, 1937.[309] By all accounts, he was a patient 
and affectionate father, teaching Maria to ride a bicycle, play tennis, 
ski, and ride horses.[309] Sharing many of her parents' interests, she 
accompanied them on their travels and was often photographed with them.[309] 
Like her father, she developed a love for art and drawing.[310][Note 11] 
As a family they vacationed together in Sun Valley, Idaho, spent time at 
Rocky's parents' country house in Southampton, New York, and took frequent 
trips to Europe.[306] Cooper and Rocky were legally separated on May 16, 
1951, when Cooper moved out of their home.[311] For over two years, they 
maintained a fragile and uneasy family life with their daughter.[312] Cooper 
moved back into their home in November 1953,[313][314] and their formal 
reconciliation occurred in February 1954.[270] Prior to his marriage, Cooper 
had a series of romantic relationships with leading actresses, beginning 
in 1927 with Clara Bow, who advanced his career by helping him get one 
of his first leading roles in Children of Divorce.[315][Note 12] Bow was 
also responsible for getting Cooper a role in Wings, which generated an 
enormous amount of fan mail for the young actor.[319] In 1928, he had a 
relationship with another experienced actress, Evelyn Brent, whom he met 
while filming Beau Sabreur.[320] In 1929, while filming The Wolf Song, 
Cooper began an intense affair with Lupe Vélez, which was the most important 
romance of his early life.[321] During their two years together, Cooper 
also had brief affairs with Marlene Dietrich while filming Morocco in 1930[322] 
and with Carole Lombard while making I Take This Woman in 1931.[323] During 
his year abroad in 1931–32, Cooper had an affair with the married Countess 
Dorothy di Frasso, while staying at her Villa Madama in Rome.[81] After 
he was married in December 1933, Cooper remained faithful to his wife until 
the summer of 1942, when he began an affair with Ingrid Bergman during 
the production of For Whom the Bell Tolls.[324] Their relationship lasted 
through the completion of filming Saratoga Trunk in June 1943.[325] In 
1948, after finishing work on The Fountainhead, Cooper began an affair 
with actress Patricia Neal, his co-star.[326] At first they kept their 
affair discreet, but eventually it became an open secret in Hollywood, 
and Cooper's wife confronted him with the rumors, which he admitted were 
true. He also confessed that he was in love with Neal, and continued to 
see her.[327][328] Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951,[311] 
but he did not seek a divorce.[329] Neal ended their relationship in late 
December 1951.[330] During his three-year separation from his wife, Cooper 
had affairs with Grace Kelly,[331] Lorraine Chanel,[332] and Gisèle Pascal.[333] 
For me the really satisfying things I do are offered me, free, for nothing. 
Ever go out in the fall and do a little hunting? See the frost on the grass 
and the leaves turning? Spend a day in the hills alone, or with good companions? 
Watch a sunset and a moonrise? Notice a bird in the wind? A stream in the 
woods, a storm at sea, cross the country by train, and catch a glimpse 
of something beautiful in the desert, or the farmlands? Free to everybody 
...[334] Cooper's twenty-year friendship with Ernest Hemingway began at 
Sun Valley in October 1940.[335] The previous year, Hemingway drew upon 
Cooper's image when he created the character of Robert Jordan for the novel 
For Whom the Bell Tolls.[336] The two shared a passion for the outdoors,[335] 
and for years they hunted duck and pheasant, and skied together in Sun 
Valley. Both men admired the work of Rudyard Kipling—Cooper kept a copy 
of the poem "If—" in his dressing room—and retained as adults Kipling's 
sense of boyish adventure.[337] As well as admiring Cooper's hunting skills 
and knowledge of the outdoors, Hemingway believed his character matched 
his screen persona,[335] once telling a friend, "If you made up a character 
like Coop, nobody would believe it. He's just too good to be true."[337] 
They saw each other often, and their friendship remained strong through 
the years.[338][Note 13] Cooper's social life generally centered on sports, 
outdoor activities, and dinner parties with his family and friends from 
the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William 
Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara 
Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor.[340][341][342] As well as hunting, Cooper 
enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving.[343][344] 
He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, 
he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including 
works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, and Georgia O'Keeffe.[345] 
Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1956.[345] 
Cooper had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included 
a 1930 Duesenberg.[346][347] Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective, 
and loved the solitude of outdoor activities.[348] Not unlike his screen 
persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences[348] 
with an occasional "yup" and "shucks".[349][350] He once said, "If others 
have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet."[351] According 
to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist 
on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, 
sports cars, and modern art.[351] He was modest and unpretentious,[348] 
frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments.[352] 
His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and 
thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor.[351] Cooper maintained 
a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie 
star status—never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director 
or leading lady.[353] His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, "Coop never 
fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody 
that worked with him liked him."[353] Cooper was a conservative Republican 
like his father, and voted for Calvin Coolidge in 1924, Herbert Hoover 
in 1928 and 1932, and campaigned for Wendell Willkie in 1940.[239] When 
Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented fourth presidential term 
in 1944, Cooper campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey and criticized Roosevelt 
for being dishonest and adopting "foreign" ideas.[354] In a radio address 
that he paid for himself just prior to the election,[354] Cooper said, 
"I disagree with the New Deal belief that the America all of us love is 
old and worn-out and finished—and has to borrow foreign notions that don't 
even seem to work any too well where they come from ... Our country is 
a young country that just has to make up its mind to be itself again."[354][355] 
He also attended a Republican rally at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 
that drew 93,000 Dewey supporters.[356] Cooper was one of the founding 
members of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American 
Ideals,[357] a conservative organization dedicated, according to its statement 
of principles, to preserving the "American way of life" and opposing communism 
and fascism.[358] The organization—whose membership included Walt Disney, 
Clark Gable, Ronald Reagan, Barbara Stanwyck, and John Wayne—pressured 
the United States Congress to investigate communist influence in the motion 
picture industry.[359] On October 23, 1947, Cooper appeared before the 
House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and was asked if he had observed 
any "communistic influence" in Hollywood.[360] Cooper recounted statements 
he'd heard suggesting that the Constitution was out of date and that Congress 
was an unnecessary institution—comments that Cooper said he found to be 
"very un-American".[360] He also testified that he had rejected several 
scripts because he thought they were "tinged with communist ideas".[360] 
Unlike some other witnesses, Cooper did not name any individuals during 
his testimony.[360][361] Cooper was baptized in the Anglican Church in 
December 1911 in England,[19] and was raised in the Episcopal Church in 
the United States.[362] While he was never an observant Christian during 
his adult life, many of his friends believed he had a deeply spiritual 
side.[363] On June 26, 1953, Cooper accompanied his wife and daughter, 
who were devout Catholics,[364] to Rome, where they had an audience with 
Pope Pius XII.[365] Cooper and his wife were still separated at the time, 
but the papal visit marked the beginning of their gradual reconciliation.[366] 
In the coming years, Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal 
behavior,[363] and started discussing Catholicism with his family.[364][367] 
He began attending church with them regularly,[367] and met with their 
parish priest, who offered Cooper spiritual guidance.[363][367] After several 
months of study, Cooper was baptized as a Roman Catholic on April 9, 1959, 
before a small group of family and friends at the Church of the Good Shepherd 
in Beverly Hills.[362][367] On April 14, 1960, Cooper underwent surgery 
at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for prostate cancer after it 
had metastasized to his colon.[368] He fell ill again on May 31 and underwent 
further surgery at Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles in early June to remove 
a malignant tumor from his large intestine.[368] After recuperating over 
the summer, Cooper took his family on vacation to the south of France[369] 
before traveling to England in the fall to make his last film, The Naked 
Edge.[368] In December 1960, he worked on the NBC television documentary 
The Real West,[370] which was part of the company's Project 20 series.[371][Note 
14] On December 27, his wife learned from their family doctor that Cooper's 
cancer had spread to his lungs and bones and was inoperable.[373] His family 
decided not to tell him immediately.[374] On January 9, 1961, Cooper attended 
a dinner given in his honor at the Friars Club hosted by Frank Sinatra 
and Dean Martin.[370] Attended by many of his industry friends,[375] the 
dinner concluded with a brief speech by Cooper who said, "The only achievement 
I'm proud of is the friends I've made in this community."[376] In mid-January, 
Cooper took his family to Sun Valley for their last vacation together.[374] 
Cooper and Hemingway hiked through the snow together for the last time.[377] 
On February 27, after returning to Los Angeles, Cooper learned that he 
was dying.[378] He later told his family, "We'll pray for a miracle; but 
if not, and that's God's will, that's all right too."[379] On April 17, 
Cooper watched the Academy Awards ceremony on television and saw his good 
friend James Stewart, who had presented Cooper with his first Oscar years 
earlier, accept on Cooper's behalf an honorary award for lifetime achievement—his 
third Oscar.[380] Speaking to Cooper, an emotional Stewart said, "Coop, 
I want you to know I'll get it to you right away. With it goes all the 
friendship and affection and the admiration and deep respect of all of 
us. We're very, very proud of you, Coop."[380][Note 15] The following day, 
newspapers around the world announced the news that Cooper was dying.[338] 
In the coming days he received numerous messages of appreciation and encouragement, 
including telegrams from Pope John XXIII[382] and Queen Elizabeth II,[349][382] 
and a phone call from President John F. Kennedy.[349][382] On May 4, Cooper, 
in his last public statement, said, "I know that what is happening is God's 
will. I am not afraid of the future."[383] He received the last rites on 
May 12. Cooper died quietly the following day, Saturday, May 13, 1961, 
at 12:47 pm, less than a week after his sixtieth birthday.[384][385] A 
requiem mass was held on May 18 at the Church of the Good Shepherd, attended 
by many of Cooper's friends, including James Stewart, Henry Hathaway, Joel 
McCrea, Audrey Hepburn, Jack L. Warner, John Ford, John Wayne, Edward G. 
Robinson, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Randolph Scott, Walter Pidgeon, Bob 
Hope and Marlene Dietrich.[386][Note 16] Cooper was buried in the Grotto 
of Our Lady of Lourdes in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.[388] 
In May 1974, after his family relocated to New York, Cooper's remains were 
exhumed and reburied in Sacred Hearts Cemetery in Southampton.[389][390] 
His grave is marked by a three-ton boulder from a Montauk quarry.[389] 
Naturalness is hard to talk about, but I guess it boils down to this: You 
find out what people expect of your type of character and then you give 
them what they want. That way, an actor never seems unnatural or affected 
no matter what role he plays.[391] Cooper's acting style consisted of three 
essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality 
onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his 
roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated 
for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher Lee Strasberg once observed: 
"The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary 
Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act but to be themselves, 
to respond or react. They refuse to say or do anything they feel not to 
be consonant with their own characters."[184] Film director François Truffaut 
ranked Cooper among "the greatest actors" because of his ability to deliver 
great performances "without direction".[184] This ability to project elements 
of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across 
his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced 
that he was simply "playing himself".[392] Cooper's ability to project 
his personality onto his characters played an important part in his appearing 
natural and authentic on screen. Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, "This 
fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest 
of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural."[91] Charles 
Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed, "In 
truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it 
from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life."[91] William 
Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a "superb actor, a 
master of movie acting".[393] In his review of Cooper's performance in 
The Real Glory, Graham Greene wrote, "Sometimes his lean photogenic face 
seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of 
his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual 
jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though 
a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think 
anymore."[91] Cooper's style of underplaying before the camera surprised 
many of his directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, 
he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial 
movements.[394] Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director 
Howard Hawks observed, "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be 
working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene 
and you'd think ... this isn't going to be any good. But when you saw the 
rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all 
the things he'd been thinking."[177] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four 
films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of 
the Yankees, noting, "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be 
just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd 
swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures."[395] 
His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on 
her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, 
"The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that 
expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. 
You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he 
was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever 
worked with."[203] Cooper's career spanned thirty-six years, from 1925 
to 1961.[396] During that time, he appeared in eighty-four feature films 
in a leading role.[397] He was a major movie star from the end of the silent 
film era to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His natural 
and authentic acting style appealed powerfully to both men and women,[398] 
and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres, 
including Westerns, war films, adventure films, drama films, crime films, 
romance films, comedy films, and romantic comedy films. He appeared on 
the Motion Picture Herald exhibitor's poll of top ten film personalities 
for twenty-three consecutive years, from 1936 to 1958.[133] According to 
Quigley's annual poll, Cooper was one of the top money-making stars for 
eighteen years, appearing in the top ten in 1936–37, 1941–49, and 1951–57.[399] 
He topped the list in 1953.[399] In Quigley's list of all-time money-making 
stars, Cooper is listed fourth, after John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Tom 
Cruise.[399] At the time of his death, it was estimated that his films 
grossed well over $200 million[396] (equivalent to $1.59 billion in 2015). 
In over half of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, 
pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men of action.[392] In the rest he played 
a wide range of characters, included doctors, professors, artists, architects, 
clerks, and baseball players.[392] Cooper's heroic screen image changed 
with each period of his career.[400] In his early films, he played the 
young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph 
of simple virtues (The Virginian).[400] After becoming a major star, his 
Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure 
films and dramas (A Farewell to Arms).[400] During the height of his career, 
from 1936 to 1943, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common 
man willing to sacrifice himself for others (Mr. Deeds, Meet John Doe, 
and For Whom the Bell Tolls).[400] In the post-war years, Cooper attempted 
broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly 
at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (The Fountainhead 
and High Noon).[401] In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects the violence 
of the past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (Friendly 
Persuasion and Man of the West).[402] The screen persona he developed and 
sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, 
handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity[403] who emphasized action 
over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, 
the adventurer, and the common man.[404] On February 6, 1960, Cooper was 
awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard 
for his contribution to the film industry.[405] He was also awarded a star 
on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana.[406] On 
May 6, 1961, he was awarded the French Order of Arts and Letters in recognition 
of his significant contribution to the arts.[370] On July 30, 1961, he 
was posthumously awarded the David di Donatello Special Award in Italy 
for his career achievements.[407] In 1966, he was inducted into the Hall 
of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum 
in Oklahoma City.[408] The American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Cooper 
eleventh on its list of the 25 male stars of classic Hollywood.[409] Three 
of his characters—Will Kane, Lou Gehrig, and Sergeant York—made AFI's list 
of the one hundred greatest heroes and villains, all of them as heroes.[410] 
His Lou Gehrig line, "Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the 
face of the earth.", is ranked by AFI as the thirty-eighth greatest movie 
quote of all time.[411] More than a half century after his death, Cooper's 
enduring legacy, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, is his image of 
the ideal American hero preserved in his film performances.[412] Charlton 
Heston once observed, "He projected the kind of man Americans would like 
to be, probably more than any actor that's ever lived."[413] The following 
is a list of feature films in which Cooper appeared in a leading role.[419][420]
