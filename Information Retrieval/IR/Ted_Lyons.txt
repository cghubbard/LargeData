As player As manager Theodore Amar Lyons (December 28, 1900 – July 25, 
1986) was an American professional baseball starting pitcher, manager and 
coach in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in 21 MLB seasons, all 
with the Chicago White Sox. He is the franchise leader in wins.[1] Lyons 
won 20 or more games three times (in 1925, 1927, and 1930) and became a 
fan favorite in Chicago. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 1955. He has the second highest career ERA of any Hall of Fame pitcher.[2] 
He is also the only Hall of Fame pitcher who gave up more walks than he 
had strikeouts. Lyons broke into the major leagues in 1923 after playing 
collegiate baseball at Baylor University. He joined the White Sox on a 
road trip and never pitched a day in the minors. He recorded his first 
2 wins as a relief pitcher in a doubleheader on October 6, 1923, making 
him one of the first pitchers to perform the feat. He worked his way into 
the starting rotation the following year, when he posted a 12–11 record 
and 4.87 ERA. Lyons pitched a no-hitter on August 21, 1926, which took 
just 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete (Ted Lyons August 21, 1926 No-hitter 
Box Score). Lyons was at his crafty best in 1930, when he posted a 22–15 
record and A.L.-leading totals of 29 complete games and 297⅔ innings for 
a team that finished 62–92. Prior to a 1931 arm injury, his pitches included 
a "sailer" (now known as a cut fastball), knuckleball, curveball, and changeup. 
After the 1931 injury, his pitches included a fastball, slow curve, knuckleball 
and an even slower curveball used as a changeup.[3] As Lyons aged, his 
career benefited from the White Sox's decision to never let him pitch more 
than 30 games per season from 1934 on. He was such a draw among the fans 
that, as his career began to wind down in 1939, manager Jimmy Dykes began 
using him only in Sunday afternoon games,[4] which earned him the nickname 
"Sunday Teddy". Lyons made the most of his unusual scheduling, winning 
52 of 82 decisions from 1939 until 1942. During 1942, Lyons' 20th and last 
full season, he led the league with a 2.10 ERA and completed every one 
of his 20 starts. Although exempt from the military draft due to age, after 
the season he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and fought in 
the Pacific War. In 1943, the White Sox announced that his jersey number 
would not be reissued.[5] In May of that year, he was based in Chicago 
at the Navy Pier. He commented that he would not be able to return to pitching 
if the war lasted three or four more years.[6] He made a brief return to 
the mound in 1946, with a 2.32 ERA[4] in five games, all complete. He stopped 
pitching for good that season, having compiled a 260–230 record, 356 complete 
games, 1073 strikeouts and a 3.67 ERA. He never appeared in a postseason 
game, as the generally mediocre-to-poor White Sox were usually far behind 
the American League leaders during his career. In Lyons' 21 seasons with 
the Sox, they finished fifth or lower (in an eight-team league) 16 times, 
and never finished higher than third. New York Yankees manager Joe McCarthy 
said, "If he'd pitched for the Yankees, he would have won over 400 games." 
Lyons succeeded Dykes as the White Sox manager in May 1946 after an apparent 
contract dispute between Dykes and Grace Comiskey.[7] He had less success 
as a manager than he had as a player, guiding them to a meager 185–245 
record. Lyons resigned as manager in October 1948.[8] Lyons coached the 
pitchers for the Detroit Tigers (1949–52) and Brooklyn Dodgers (1954). 
In 1955, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Lyons served as 
a scout with the White Sox until his retirement in 1967.[9] Lawrence Ritter 
and Donald Honig included Lyons in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball 
Players of All Time (1981). On July 25, 1986, Lyons died in a nursing home 
in Sulphur, Louisiana.[10] One year later, the Chicago White Sox retired
