John Owen "Chief" Wilson (August 21, 1883 – February 22, 1954) was an American 
baseball outfielder who played nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the St. Louis Cardinals from 1908 
to 1916. He batted left-handed but threw right-handed and served primarily 
as a right fielder. Wilson played minor league baseball for three different 
teams until the end of 1907, when he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
After spending six seasons with the organization, Wilson was traded to 
the St. Louis Cardinals, where he spent the last three seasons of his major 
league career and with whom he played his last game on October 1, 1916. 
Wilson is best known for setting the single-season record for triples in 
1912 with 36, a record that still stands. Wilson was born on August 21, 
1883, in Austin, Texas.[1] He grew up at a ranch owned by his family located 
approximately 50 miles north of Austin in Bertram.[2] He was known for 
his silent and introvert nature; his Pirates teammate and roommate Bobby 
Byrne recounted how Wilson "wouldn't say two words all day."[2] Wilson 
started his baseball career playing in several teams in independent leagues, 
before joining the Austin Senators in 1905.[2][3] After he retired from 
baseball, Wilson returned to his family ranch in Bertram, where he became 
a stock farmer and held various positions in service to the community.[4] 
He died on October 24, 1954, at the age of 70 and was interred at Austin 
Memorial Park.[1][2] On March 31, 2007, the Bertram Little League Sports 
Complex was dedicated to and named after Wilson in order to honor the city's 
famous inhabitant.[4] Contrary to popular belief, Wilson was not of Native 
American descent.[5] He was nicknamed "Chief" because his Pittsburgh teammates 
and manager Fred Clarke thought Wilson, a native Texan with a towering 
height of 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m),[6] resembled a "Chief of the Texas 
Rangers."[2] In 1905, Wilson signed with the Austin Senators, a minor league 
baseball team in the Texas League.[3] However, the team disbanded in the 
middle of the season on June 6 and Wilson joined the Fort Worth Panthers, 
playing for them until he was promoted to the Des Moines Champs of the 
Western League in 1907. He performed well, posting a batting average of 
.323 in 56 games.[2][3] It was during his first (and only) season with 
the Champs that Wilson was spotted by Denver Grizzlies' pitcher Babe Adams, 
who had signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates at the end of 1907. Adams informed 
Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss of Wilson's "tremendous arm" and his ability 
"not only as a hitter but as a fielder."[2] This prompted Dreyfuss to sign 
Wilson to the Pirates as their right fielder.[2] Wilson made his major 
league debut for the Pirates on April 15, 1908, at the age of 24,[1] in 
a 3–1 Opening Day win against the St. Louis Cardinals.[7] During his 1908 
rookie season, Wilson had a relatively disappointing year,[2][5] batting 
.227, slugging .285 and finished sixth in the National League (NL) in strikeouts 
with 66. Out of his 120 hits that season, only 18 were extra base hits.[1][2] 
As a result of his offensive woes, Pirates fans booed him on a constant 
basis.[2] Wilson greatly improved his batting in the following season, 
raising his batting average to .272, playing all 154 games in the season 
and finishing fifth in the NL in triples with 12.[1] This success culminated 
in the Pirates winning the World Series at the conclusion of that season.[8] 
In the Opening Day game of the 1910 season, Wilson got injured and had 
to sit out for seven games, with Vin Campbell taking his place in the lineup.[9] 
He finished the season with similar statistics as the previous year,[2] 
batting .276 and hitting 13 triples.[1] The 1911 season was a breakout 
year for Wilson. He posted a batting average of .300, finished third in 
the NL in doubles (34), fifth in home runs (12) and sixth in slugging (.472) 
and drove in 107 runs batted in (RBI), thus becoming the league's RBI champion.[1] 
The 12 home runs he hit that season marked a Pirates team record he held 
until 1925.[2] In 1912, Wilson recorded the same batting average as the 
year before and came second in the league in slugging (.513) and games 
played (152), third in home runs (11), fourth in RBI (95) and seventh in 
hits (175).[1] Furthermore, he set the single-season record for triples, 
hitting 36 in total that year.[2] However, his record received almost no 
press coverage whatsoever. Baseball sportswriter Ernest Lanigan suggested 
that this was because a record book erroneously attributed Nap Lajoie with 
having 44 triples in 1903, when he hit only 11 that year.[2] As a result, 
several newspapers—most notably the Pittsburgh Press—were under the belief 
that Lajoie held the record.[10] Wilson's record still stands today and 
is currently the third oldest single-season record, behind Lajoie's .426 
batting average in 1901 and Jack Chesbro's 41 wins in 1904.[11] It is considered 
one of baseball's most unbreakable records,[12] as only Sam Crawford (1914) 
and Kiki Cuyler (1925) have come the closest to breaking the record; both 
players hit 26 triples.[13] Wilson's record also accounted for part of 
the 129 triples amassed by the Pirates that year, setting a single-season 
for most triples by a team since 1900.[2][14] Due to his stellar and record-breaking 
performance, Wilson finished eighth in that season's voting for the Chalmers 
Award, the precursor to the MLB Most Valuable Player Award.[15] General
