Alfredo Aceves Martínez (born December 8, 1982) is a Mexican professional 
baseball pitcher for the Sultanes de Monterrey of the Mexican Baseball 
League. He has pitched in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees 
and the Boston Red Sox. Aceves uses a fastball, which can reach the mid 
90s, a curveball, a changeup, and a cut fastball. He is known for his control 
and his ability to throw any pitch in any count.[1] Aceves was signed by 
the Toronto Blue Jays as an amateur free agent in 2001. He made ten starts 
in the Dominican Summer League that year. However, Aceves felt isolated, 
and when the Blue Jays assigned him to stay in the DSL for 2002, Aceves 
stayed in Mexico, and his contract was purchased by the Yucatán Leones 
of the Mexican League.[2] Aceves pitched for Yucatán and Sultanes de Monterrey 
for the next six seasons. Yankees scout Lee Sigman followed Aceves in the 
Mexican League, feeling he could achieve similar success as Teddy Higuera, 
who Sigman had signed for the Milwaukee Brewers.[2] Feeling that he had 
developed well in the Mexican League, the Yankees purchased Aceves, along 
with Manny Banuelos and two other players, for $450,000 during the 2007–08 
offseason.[2][3] He began 2008 with the Single-A Advanced Tampa Yankees. 
He was quickly promoted to the Double-A Trenton Thunder and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Yankees. He was named Eastern League pitcher of the week for the week ending 
May 25, 2008.[4] After going a combined 8-6 with a 2.62 earned run average 
(ERA) on the three Yankee farm teams, Aceves was called up to the Yankees 
on August 28, 2008. On August 31, Aceves made his Yankee and major league 
debut, pitching two scoreless innings in relief. After pitching effectively 
through his first few relief appearances, Aceves was moved to the rotation 
in replacement of Darrell Rasner.[5] In his first career start, he pitched 
seven innings of one-run ball with two strikeouts against the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim, earning the win. After starting the 2009 season in the 
minors, Aceves rejoined the Yankees on May 4.[6] Due to his ability to 
pitch effectively in any situation, Aceves has drawn comparisons to former 
Yankee reliever and spot starter Ramiro Mendoza.[7] Aceves made ten relief 
appearances in 2010 before succumbing to a strained lower back that ended 
his season. He suffered a broken collarbone in an off-season bicycle accident.[8] 
He was non-tendered after the season.[9] Aceves was signed to a major league 
deal by the Boston Red Sox on February 8, 2011.[10] On April 21, he was 
optioned to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox to make room for Matt Albers 
on the roster.[11] On May 6 he was called back up, and on May 16 he won 
his first game with the Red Sox. Between then and September 1, Aceves has 
a 9–1 record out of the bullpen for Boston. After an injury to Andrew Bailey, 
Aceves was named the acting closer for the beginning of the 2012 season, 
but had a slow start, surrendering the game-winning hit on Opening Day 
and allowing a game-tying home run in the 9th inning of the 3rd game of 
the season. In late August, once Bailey returned from his injury, he took 
the closer role back. After five games in 2013, which included three starts, 
Aceves was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket on April 25 two days after giving 
away eight runs in 3.1 innings against the Oakland Athletics. Aceves was 
recalled on May 24 for a one-off start against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Despite the win, he was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket on May 28. He was 
recalled again on June 12,[12] and returned to Pawtucket the next day. 
He was recalled on July 7 when Andrew Miller suffered a year-ending foot 
injury.[13] He was optioned 3 days later. On July 14, Aceves was outrighted 
off the 40-man roster after clearing waivers.[14] He elected free agency 
on October 4. Aceves signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles 
in January 2014. Aceves took a short break from 2014 Spring training to 
return to Mexico to obtain a work visa.[15] After learning that he would 
not make the Orioles roster near the end of Spring training, Aceves elected 
to opt out of his contract, making him a free agent. Aceves signed a minor 
league deal with the Yankees on March 28, 2014.[16] He received a promotion 
to the major leagues on May 3,[17][18] and was designated for assignment 
on June 4.[19] On July 3, he was suspended for 50 games for failing a drug 
test for recreational drugs.[20] He was released on August 27.[21] Aceves 
signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants on March 7, 2015.[22] 
The Giants assigned him to the Sultanes de Monterrey of the Mexican League 
for the 2015 season.[23][24] He was suspended for the remainder of the 
season in June for his confrontation with an umpire.[25] He resigned on 
April 5, 2015. Aceves married his wife Arley in November 2008, after proposing 
to her during a Trenton Thunder game during the 2008 season.[2][26] His 
father, Alfredo Aceves Sr., was a first baseman in the Mexican League.[27] 
His older brother, Jonathan Aceves, was a minor league catcher in the Chicago 
White Sox organization, for the Naranjeros de Hermosillo in the Mexican 
Pacific League and for the Saraperos de Saltillo of the Mexican League.[28] 
Aceves wears #91, a number worn by Dennis Rodman, whom Aceves admires.[2]
