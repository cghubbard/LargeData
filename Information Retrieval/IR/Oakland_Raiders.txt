The Oakland Raiders are a professional American football franchise based 
in Oakland, California. The Raiders began playing in 1960 as a member club 
of the American Football League (AFL); they have been a member club of 
the National Football League (NFL) since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger. The Raiders 
compete in the NFL as a member club of the American Football Conference 
(AFC) West division; the team plays its home games at the Oakland Alameda 
Coliseum. As of the start of the team's 2015 season, the Raiders have an 
all-time regular season record of 444–397–11, with a playoff record of 
25–18.[8] In the club's first three seasons (1960–1962), the team struggled 
both on and off the field. In 1963, the Raiders appointed eventual owner/general 
manager Al Davis to the position of head coach. Under Davis' guidance, 
the team's fortunes improved dramatically. In 1967, the Raiders reached 
the postseason for the first time; they went on to win their first, and 
only, AFL title that year by beating the Houston Oilers in the Championship 
Game, but they were defeated by the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II. 
The Raiders' run of success grew during the 1970s; during this time, they 
won six division titles and played in six AFC championship games. In 1976, 
the team captured its first championship by defeating the Minnesota Vikings 
in Super Bowl XI. In 1980, the Raiders unexpectedly won a second championship 
by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XV, at the time being 
the first NFL team to have ever done so as the wild card team in the playoffs. 
Two years later, the franchise relocated to Los Angeles. In 1983 (their 
second season since the move), they defeated the Washington Redskins in 
Super Bowl XVIII to capture their third and, to date, last championship. 
The Raiders' fortunes declined considerably following the 1985 season; 
they would win just one division title (1990) and two playoff games over 
their final nine seasons in Los Angeles. In 1995, the team returned to 
Oakland. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Raiders experienced a massive 
(albeit brief) resurgence; their renaissance culminated with a 2002 loss 
to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII. The team has struggled 
significantly ever since that Super Bowl loss. While the Raiders' fortunes 
somewhat improved in 2010 and 2011, they have neither reached the playoffs 
nor attained a winning record (any record better than .500) in 13 seasons. 
They most recently finished 7–9 in 2015. Today, the Raiders are known for 
their extensive fan base and distinctive team culture. Since 1963, the 
team has won 15 division titles (three AFL and 12 NFL), three Super Bowls, 
four AFC titles (1976, 1980, 1983, and 2002) and an AFL Championship. 14 
former members of the team have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall 
of Fame. The Oakland Raiders were originally going to be called the Oakland 
Señors after a name-the-team contest had that name finish first, but after 
being the target of local jokes, the name was changed to the Raiders before 
the 1960 season began. Having enjoyed a successful collegiate coaching 
career at Navy during the 1950s, San Francisco native Eddie Erdelatz was 
hired as the Raiders first head coach. On February 9, 1960, after rejecting 
offers from the NFL's Washington Redskins and the AFL's Los Angeles Chargers, 
Erdelatz accepted the Oakland Raiders head coaching position. In January 
1960, the Raiders were established in Oakland, and because of NFL interference 
with the original eighth franchise owner, were the last team of eight in 
the new American Football League to select players, thus relegated to the 
remaining talent available (see below). The 1960 Raiders 42-man roster 
included 28 rookies and only 14 veterans. Among the Raiders rookies were 
future Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee center Jim Otto, and a future 
Raiders head coach, quarterback Tom Flores. In their 1960 debut year under 
Erdelatz the Raiders finished with a 6–8 record. Off the field, Erdelatz 
had numerous conflicts with the team's front office while he battled an 
ulcer. Ownership conflicts prevented the team from signing any top draft 
picks the next season.[citation needed] On September 18, 1961, Erdelatz 
was dismissed after the Raiders were outscored 99–0 in the first two games 
of the 1961 season. On September 24, 1961, after the dismissal of Erdelatz, 
management named Los Angeles native and offensive line coach Marty Feldman 
as the Raiders head coach. The team finished the 1961 season with a 2–12 
record. Feldman began the 1962 season as Raiders head coach but was fired 
on October 16, 1962 after a dismal 0–5 start. From October 16, 1962 – December 
16, 1962, the Raiders then appointed Oklahoma native and assistant coach 
Red Conkright as head coach. Under Conkright, the Raiders' only victory 
was its final game of the season, finishing with a 1–13 record. Following 
the 1962 season the Raiders appointed Conkright to an interim mentor position. 
Under the Raiders first three head coaches since entering the AFL, the 
team's combined three-year win-loss record was 9–33. After the 1962 season, 
Raiders managing general partner F. Wayne Valley hired Al Davis as Raiders 
head coach and general manager. At 33, he was the youngest person in professional 
football history to hold the positions.[9] Davis immediately began to implement 
what he termed the "vertical game", an aggressive offensive strategy inspired 
by the offense developed by Chargers head coach Sid Gillman.[10] Under 
Davis the Raiders improved to 10–4, and he was named the AFL's Coach of 
the Year in 1963. Though the team slipped to 5–7–2 in 1964, it rebounded 
to an 8–5–1 record in 1965. The famous silver and black Raider uniform 
debuted at the regular-season opening game on September 8, 1963. Previous 
to this, the team wore a combination of black and white with gold trim 
on the pants and oversized numerals. In April 1966, Davis left the Raiders 
after being named AFL Commissioner, promoting assistant coach John Rauch 
to head coach. Two months later, the league announced its merger with the 
NFL. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, 
and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. 
On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part-owner of the team. He purchased 
a 10% interest in the team for $18,000, and became the team's third general 
partner — the partner in charge of football operations.,[11][12] Under 
Rauch, the Raiders matched their 1965 season's 8–5–1 record in 1966 but 
missed the playoffs, finishing second in the AFL West Division. On the 
field, the team Davis had assembled and coached steadily improved. With 
John Rauch (Davis's hand-picked successor) as head coach, and led by quarterback 
Daryle Lamonica, acquired in a trade with Buffalo, the Raiders finished 
the 1967 season with a 13–1–0 record and won the 1967 AFL Championship, 
defeating the Oilers 40–7. The win earned the team a trip to the Orange 
Bowl in Miami, Florida in Super Bowl II, January 14, 1968, where they were 
defeated 33–14 by Vince Lombardi's Packers. The following year, the Raiders 
ended the 1968 season with a 12–2–0 record winning the AFL West Division 
title but were defeated 27–23 by the New York Jets in the AFL Championship 
Game. Citing management conflicts with day-to-day coaching decisions, Rauch 
resigned as Raiders head coach on January 16, 1969, accepting the head 
coaching job of the Buffalo Bills. During the early 1960s, John Madden 
was a defensive assistant coach at San Diego State University under SDSU 
head coach Don Coryell. Madden credits Coryell as being an influence on 
his coaching. In 1967, Madden was hired by Al Davis as the Raiders linebacker 
coach. On February 4, 1969, after the departure of John Rauch, Raiders 
assistant coach John Madden was named the Raiders sixth head coach. Under 
Madden, the 1969 Raiders won the AFL West Division title with a 12–1–1 
record. On December 20, 1969, the Raiders defeated the Oilers 56–7 in the 
AFL Division playoff game. In the AFL Conference Championship game on January 
4, 1970, the Raiders were defeated by Hank Stram's Chiefs 17–7. In 1970, 
the AFL–NFL merger took place and the Raiders joined the Western Division 
of the American Football Conference (actually the AFL West with the same 
teams as in 1969, except for the Cincinnati Bengals) in the newly merged 
NFL. The first post-merger season saw the Raiders win the AFC West with 
an 8–4–2 record and go all the way to the conference championship, where 
they lost to the Colts. Despite another 8–4–2 season in 1971, the Raiders 
failed to win the division or achieve a playoff berth. When backup OG-OT 
Ron Mix (former Charger) played, the 1971 Raiders had an eventual all-Pro 
Football Hall of Fame offensive interior line (with OT Art Shell, OG Gene 
Upshaw, C Jim Otto, and OT Bob Brown). The teams of the 1970s were thoroughly 
dominant teams, with 8 Hall of Fame inductees on the roster and a Hall 
of Fame coach in John Madden. The 1970s Raiders created the team's identity 
and persona as a team that was hard-hitting. Dominant on defense, with 
the crushing hits of safeties Jack Tatum and George Atkinson and cornerback 
Skip Thomas, the Raiders regularly held first place in the AFC West, entering 
the playoffs nearly every season. From 1973 through 1977, the Raiders reached 
the conference championship every year. This was the era of the bitter 
rivalry between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Raiders. In the 1970s, the 
Steelers and Raiders during many of those seasons were the two best teams 
in the AFC and, arguably, the NFL. The Raiders regularly met the Steelers 
in the playoffs, and the winner of the Steelers-Raiders game went on to 
win the Super Bowl in 3 of those instances, from 1974 to 1976. The rivalry 
garnered attention in the sports media, with controversial plays, late 
hits, accusations and public statements. The rivalry began with and was 
fueled by a controversial last-second play in their first playoff game 
in 1972. That season the Raiders achieved a 10–3–1 record and an AFC West 
title. In the divisional round, they were beaten by the Steelers 13–7 on 
a play that become known as the "Immaculate Reception". The Raiders won 
the AFC West again in 1973 with a 9–4–1 record. Lamonica was replaced as 
starting quarterback early in the season by Ken Stabler, who remained the 
starting quarterback throughout the team's dominant seasons of the 1970s. 
The Raiders defeated Pittsburgh 33–14 in the divisional round of the playoffs 
to reach the AFC Championship, but lost 27–10 to the Dolphins. In 1974, 
Oakland had a 12–2 regular season, which included a 9-game winning streak. 
They beat the Dolphins 28–26 in the divisional round of the playoffs in 
a see-saw battle remembered as the "Sea of Hands" game.[13] They then lost 
the AFC Championship to the Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl. 
The Raiders were held to only 29 yards rushing by the Pittsburgh defense, 
and late mistakes turned a 10–3 lead at the start of the fourth quarter 
into a disappointing 24–13 loss. In the 1975 season opener, the Raiders 
beat Miami and ended their 31-game home winning streak. With an 11–3 record, 
they defeated Cincinnati 31–28 in the divisional playoff round. Again, 
the Raiders faced the Steelers in the conference championship, eager for 
revenge; again, the Raiders came up short, as the Steelers won the AFC 
Championship and then went on to another Super Bowl title. According to 
John Madden and Al Davis, the Raiders relied on quick movement by their 
wide receivers on the outside sidelines – the deep threat, or 'long ball' 
– more so than the Steelers of that year, whose offense was far more run-oriented 
than it would become later in the 1970s. Forced to adapt to the frozen 
field of Three Rivers Stadium, with receivers slipping and unable to make 
quick moves to beat coverage, the Raiders lost, 16–10. The rivalry had 
now grown to hatred, and became the stereotype of the 'grudge match.' In 
1976, the Raiders came from behind dramatically to beat Pittsburgh 31–28 
in a revenge match in the season opener, and continued to cement its reputation 
for dirty play by knocking WR Lynn Swann out for two weeks with a clothesline 
to the helmet. Al Davis later tried to sue Steelers coach Chuck Noll for 
libel after the latter called safety George Atkinson a criminal for the 
hit. The Raiders won 13 regular season games and a close controversial 
21–17 victory over New England in the playoffs. With the Patriots up by 
three points in final two minutes, referee Ben Dreith calls roughing the 
passer on New England's Sugar Bear Hamilton after he hits Oakland QB Ken 
Stabler in 1976 NFL playoffs. Raiders go on to score a touchdown in the 
final minute to win, and go on to win the Super Bowl. They then knocked 
out the Steelers in the AFC Championship to go to Super Bowl XI. Oakland's 
opponent was the Vikings, a team that had lost three previous Super Bowls. 
The Raiders led 16–0 at halftime, having forced Minnesota into multiple 
turnovers. By the end, they won 32–14 for their first post-merger championship. 
The following season saw the Raiders finish 11–3, but they lost the division 
title to Denver. They settled for a wild card, beating the Colts in the 
second-longest overtime game in NFL history remembered as the Ghost to 
the Post game, but then fell to the Broncos in the AFC Championship. During 
a 1978 preseason game, Patriots WR Darryl Stingley was injured by a hit 
from Raiders FS Jack Tatum and paralyzed for life. Although the 1978 Raiders 
achieved a winning record at 9–7, they missed the playoffs for the first 
time since 1971, losing critical games to Seattle, Denver and Miami towards 
the end of the season. After 10 consecutive winning seasons and one Super 
Bowl championship, John Madden left the Raiders (and coaching) in 1979 
to pursue a career as a television football commentator. His replacement 
was former Raiders quarterback Tom Flores, the first Hispanic head coach 
in NFL history.[14] Flores led the Raiders to another 9–7 season, but not 
the playoffs. In the midst of the turmoil of Al Davis's attempts to move 
the team to Los Angeles in 1980, Tom Flores coached the Raiders to their 
second NFL Championship by beating the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 
XV, with the Raiders becoming the first team to ever win the Super Bowl 
after getting into the playoffs as the wild card team. Quarterback Jim 
Plunkett revitalized his career, taking over in game 5 when starter Dan 
Pastorini was lost for the season to a broken leg, by leading the team 
to this championship, after owner Al Davis had picked up Pastorini when 
he swapped quarterbacks with the Houston Oilers, sending the beloved Ken 
Stabler to the Oilers. In 1980, Al Davis attempted unsuccessfully to have 
improvements made to the Oakland Alameda Coliseum, specifically the addition 
of luxury boxes. That year, he signed a memorandum of agreement to move 
the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. The move, which required ¾ approval 
by league owners, was defeated 22–0 (with five owners abstaining). When 
Davis tried to move the team anyway, he was blocked by an injunction. In 
response, the Raiders not only became an active partner in an antitrust 
lawsuit filed by the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (who had recently lost 
the Los Angeles Rams), but filed an antitrust lawsuit of their own.[15] 
After the first case was declared a mistrial, in May 1982 a second jury 
found in favor of Davis and the Los Angeles Coliseum, clearing the way 
for the move.[16][17][18] With the ruling, the Raiders finally relocated 
to Los Angeles for the 1982 season to play their home games at the Los 
Angeles Coliseum. The team finished 8–1 in the strike-shortened 1982 season, 
first in the AFC, but lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Jets. 
The following season, the team finished 12–4 and won convincingly against 
the Steelers and Seattle Seahawks in the AFC playoffs. Against the Washington 
Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII, the Raiders built a 21–3 halftime lead en 
route to a 38–9 victory and their third NFL championship. The team had 
another successful regular season in 1984, finishing 11–5, but a three-game 
losing streak forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild-card, where they 
fell to the Seahawks. The 1985 campaign saw 12 wins and a division title, 
but that was followed by a home playoff loss to the Patriots. The Raiders' 
fortunes declined after that, and from 1986 to 1989, Los Angeles finished 
no better than 8–8 and posted consecutive losing seasons for the first 
time since 1961–1962. Also 1986 saw Al Davis get into a widely publicized 
argument with RB Marcus Allen, whom he accused of faking injuries. The 
feud continued into 1987, and Davis retaliated by signing Bo Jackson in 
Allen's place. However, Jackson was also a left fielder for Major League 
Baseball's Kansas City Royals, and could not play full-time until baseball 
season ended in October. Even worse, another strike cost the NFL one game 
and prompted them to use substitute players. The Raiders achieved a 1–2 
record before the regular team returned. After a weak 5–10 finish, Tom 
Flores moved to the front office and was replaced by Denver Broncos offensive 
assistant coach Mike Shanahan. Shanahan led the team to a 7–9 season in 
1988, and Allen and Jackson continued to trade places as the starting RB. 
Low game attendance and fan apathy were evident by this point, and in the 
summer of 1988, rumors of a Raiders return to Oakland intensified when 
a preseason game against the Houston Oilers was scheduled at Oakland Alameda 
Coliseum.[19] As early as 1986, Davis sought to abandon the Coliseum in 
favor of a more modern stadium. In addition to sharing the venue with the 
USC Trojans, the Raiders were less than ecstatic with the Coliseum as it 
was aging and still lacked the luxury suites and other amenities that Davis 
was promised when he moved the Raiders to Los Angeles.[20] Finally, the 
Coliseum had 95,000 seats and the Raiders were rarely able to fill all 
of them even in their best years, and so most Raiders home games were blacked 
out in Southern California. Numerous venues in California were considered, 
including one near now-defunct Hollywood Park in Inglewood and another 
in Carson. In August 1987, it was announced that the city of Irwindale 
paid Davis US$10 million as a good-faith deposit for a prospective stadium 
site.[21] When the bid failed, Davis kept the non-refundable deposit.[22][23] 
Negotiations between Davis and Oakland commenced in January 1989, and on 
March 11, 1991, Davis announced his intention to bring the Raiders back 
to Oakland.[24] By September 1991, however, numerous delays had prevented 
the completion of the deal between Davis and Oakland. On September 11, 
Davis announced a new deal to stay in Los Angeles, leading many fans in 
Oakland to burn Raiders paraphernalia in disgust.[25][26] After starting 
the 1989 season with a 1–3 record, Shanahan was fired by Davis, which began 
a long-standing feud between the two.[27][not in citation given] He was 
replaced by former Raider offensive lineman Art Shell, who had been voted 
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame earlier in the year. With the hiring, 
Shell became the first African American head coach in the modern NFL era, 
but the team still finished a middling 8–8.[28] In 1990, Shell led Los 
Angeles to a 12–4 record. They beat the Bengals in the divisional round 
of the playoffs, but Bo Jackson had his left femur ripped from the socket 
after a tackle. Without him, the Raiders were crushed in the AFC Championship 
by the Buffalo Bills. Jackson was forced to quit football as a result, 
although surgery allowed him to continue playing baseball until he retired 
in 1994. The team's fortunes faded after the loss. They made two other 
playoff appearances during the 1990s, and finished higher than third place 
only three times. In 1991, they got into the postseason as a wild-card 
after a 9–7 regular season, but fell to Kansas City. 1992 saw them drop 
to 7–9. This period was marked by the injury of Jackson in 1991, the failure 
of troubled quarterback Todd Marinovich, the acrimonious departure of Marcus 
Allen in 1993, and the retirement of Hall of Fame defensive end Howie Long 
after the 1993 season, when the Raiders went 10–6 and lost to Buffalo in 
the divisional round of the playoffs. Shell was fired after posting a 9–7 
record in the 1994 season. On June 23, 1995, Davis signed a letter of intent 
to move the Raiders back to Oakland. The move was approved by the Alameda 
County Board of Supervisors the next month[29] As the NFL had never recognized 
the Raiders' initial move to Los Angeles, they could not disapprove of 
the move or request a relocation fee, which had to be paid by the Los Angeles 
Rams for their move to St. Louis. The move was greeted with much fanfare,[30] 
and under new head coach Mike White the 1995 season began well for the 
team. Oakland started 8–2, but injuries to starting quarterback Jeff Hostetler 
contributed to a six-game losing streak to end the season, and the Raiders 
failed to qualify for the playoffs for a second consecutive season. In 
order to convince Davis to return, Oakland spent $220 million on stadium 
renovations. These included a new seating section – commonly known as "Mount 
Davis" – with 10,000 seats. It also built the team a training facility 
and paid all its moving costs. The Raiders pay $525,000 a year in rent 
– a fraction[clarification needed] of what the nearby San Francisco 49ers 
paid to play at the now-extinct Candlestick Park – and do not pay maintenance 
or game-day operating costs. After two more losing seasons (7–9 in 1996 
and 4–12 in 1997) under White and his successor, Joe Bugel, Davis selected 
a new head coach from outside the Raiders organization for only the second 
time when he hired Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Jon Gruden, 
who had previously worked for the 49ers and Packers under head coach Mike 
Holmgren. Under Gruden, the Raiders posted consecutive 8–8 seasons in 1998 
and 1999, and climbed out of last place in the AFC West. Oakland finished 
12–4 in the 2000 season, the team's most successful in a decade. Led by 
veteran quarterback Rich Gannon (MVP), Oakland won their first division 
title since 1990, and advanced to the AFC Championship, where they lost 
16–3 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens. The Raiders 
acquired all-time leading receiver Jerry Rice prior to the 2001 season. 
They started 10–3 but lost their last three games and finished the season 
with a record of 10–6 in the wild card playoff spot and won a second-straight 
AFC West title. They defeated the New York Jets 38–24 in the wild card 
round but lost their divisional-round playoff game to the eventual Super 
Bowl champion New England Patriots, in a controversial game that became 
known as the "Tuck Rule Game". The game was played in a heavy snowstorm, 
and late in the fourth quarter Raiders star cornerback Charles Woodson 
blitzed Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, causing an apparent fumble which 
was recovered by Raiders linebacker Greg Biekert. The recovery would assuredly 
have led to a Raiders victory, as the Raiders would have a first down with 
1:43 remaining and the Patriots had no more time outs); however, the play 
was reviewed and determined to be an incomplete pass (it was ruled that 
Brady had pump-faked and then "tucked" the ball into his body, which, by 
rule, cannot result in a fumble—though this explanation was not given on 
the field, but after the NFL season had ended). The Patriots retained possession 
and drove for a game-tying field goal. The game went into overtime and 
the Patriots won 16–13.[31] Shortly after the season, the Raiders made 
a move that involved releasing Gruden from his contract and allowing the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers to sign him. In return, the Raiders received cash 
and future draft picks from the Buccaneers. The sudden move came after 
months of speculation in the media that Davis and Gruden had fallen out 
with each other both personally and professionally.[citation needed] Bill 
Callahan, who served as the team's offensive coordinator and offensive 
line coach during Gruden's tenure, was named head coach.[32] Under Callahan, 
the Raiders finished the 2002 season 11–5, won their third-straight division 
title, and clinched the top seed in the playoffs. Rich Gannon was named 
MVP of the NFL after passing for a league-high 4,689 yards. After beating 
the Jets and Titans by large margins in the playoffs, the Raiders made 
their fifth Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXXVII. Their opponent 
was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, coached by Gruden. The Raiders, who had not 
made significant changes to Gruden's offensive schemes, were intercepted 
five times by the Buccaneers en route to a 48–21 blowout. Some Tampa Bay 
players claimed that Gruden had given them so much information on Oakland's 
offense, they knew exactly what plays were being called.[33][34] Callahan's 
second season as head coach was considerably less successful. Oakland finished 
4–12, their worst showing since 1997. After a late-season loss to the Denver 
Broncos, a visibly frustrated Callahan exclaimed, "We've got to be the 
dumbest team in America in terms of playing the game."[35] At the end of 
the 2003 regular season Callahan was fired and replaced by former Washington 
Redskins head coach Norv Turner. The team's fortunes did not improve in 
Turner's first year. Oakland finished the 2004 season 5–11, with only one 
divisional win (a one-point victory over the Broncos in Denver). During 
a Week 3 victory against the Buccaneers, Rich Gannon suffered a neck injury 
that ended his season and eventually his career. He never returned to the 
team and retired before the 2005 season.[36] Kerry Collins, who led the 
New York Giants to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXV and signed with Oakland 
after the 2003 season, became the team's starting quarterback. In an effort 
to bolster their offense, in early 2005 the Raiders acquired Pro Bowl wide 
receiver Randy Moss via trade with the Minnesota Vikings, and signed free 
agent running back Lamont Jordan of the New York Jets. After a 4–12 season 
and a second consecutive last place finish, Turner was fired as head coach. 
On February 11, 2006 the team announced the return of Art Shell as head 
coach. In announcing the move, Al Davis said that firing Shell in 1995 
had been a mistake.[37] Under Shell, the Raiders lost their first five 
games in 2006 en route to a 2–14 record, the team's worst since 1962. Oakland's 
offense struggled greatly, scoring just 168 points (fewest in franchise 
history) and allowing a league-high 72 sacks. Wide receiver Jerry Porter 
was benched by Shell for most of the season in what many viewed as a personal, 
rather than football-related, decision. Shell was fired again at the end 
of the season.[38] The Raiders also earned the right to the first overall 
pick in the 2007 NFL Draft for the first time since 1962, by virtue of 
having the league's worst record.[39] On January 22, the team announced 
the hiring of 31-year-old USC offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin, the youngest 
coach in franchise history and the youngest coach in the NFL.[40] In the 
2007 NFL Draft, the Raiders selected LSU quarterback JaMarcus Russell with 
the #1 overall pick, despite a strong objection from Kiffin. Russell, arguably 
the biggest bust in NFL history, held out until September 12 [41] and did 
not make his first career start until week 17.[42] Kiffin coached the Raiders 
to a 4–12 record in the 2007 season. After a 1–3 start to 2008 and months 
of speculation and rumors, Davis fired Kiffin on September 30, 2008. Tom 
Cable was named as his interim replacement, and officially signed as the 
17th head coach of the Oakland Raiders on Tuesday, February 3, 2009. Their 
finish to the 2008 season would turn out to match their best since they 
lost the Super Bowl in the 2002 season. However, they still finished 5–11 
and ended up third in the AFC West, the first time they did not finish 
last since 2002. They would produce an identical record in 2009; however, 
the season was somewhat ameliorated by the fact that four of the Raiders' 
five wins were against opponents with above .500 records. In 2010, the 
Raiders became the first team in NFL history to go undefeated against their 
division yet miss the playoffs (6–0 in the AFC West, 8–8 overall, 3 games 
behind the Jets for the second Wild Card entry). On January 4, 2011, owner 
Al Davis informed head coach Tom Cable that his contract would not be renewed, 
ending his tenure with the organization. Many Raider players, such as punter 
Shane Lechler, were upset with the decision. On January 17, 2011, it was 
announced that offensive coordinator Hue Jackson was going to be the next 
Raiders head coach. A press conference was held on January 18, 2011, to 
formally introduce Jackson as the next Raiders head coach, the fifth in 
just seven years. Following Davis' death during the 2011 season, new owners 
Carol and Mark Davis decided to take the franchise in a drastically different 
direction by hiring a general manager. On New Year's Day of 2012, the Raiders 
played the San Diego Chargers, hoping to go to the playoffs for the first 
time since 2002, the game ended with a 38–26 loss. Their season ended with 
another disappointing 8–8 record. On January 6, 2012, the Raiders named 
Green Bay Packers director of football operations Reggie McKenzie as the 
team's first General Manager since Al Davis. Given full autonomy over personnel 
decisions by the Davis family, McKenzie, in his first day on the job, fired 
head coach Hue Jackson after only one season on January 10, seeking to 
hire his own head coach instead. In the process, the Raiders lost their 
sixth head coach in the past ten seasons, none of whom lasted more than 
two seasons. Two weeks later, McKenzie hired Broncos defensive coordinator 
Dennis Allen as head coach. Most of the coaching staff has been replaced 
by new position and strength and conditioning coaches.[citation needed] 
The Raiders began 2012 by running a nose tackle when they run a 4-3 defense. 
They lost their home opener on Monday Night Football against San Diego 
22–14. The Raiders finished the season with a 4–12 record. In the 2013 
offseason, the Raiders began making major roster moves. These included 
the signing of linebackers Kevin Burnett, Nick Roach, and Kaluka Maiava, 
defensive tackles Pat Sims and Vance Walker, cornerbacks Tracy Porter and 
Mike Jenkins, defensive end Jason Hunter, and safety Usama Young and the 
release of wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, safety Michael Huff, linebacker 
Rolando McClain and defensive tackle Tommy Kelly. [43] Starting quarterback 
Carson Palmer was traded to the Arizona Cardinals in exchange for a sixth-round 
draft pick and a conditional seventh-round draft pick. Shortly before, 
they had traded a fifth-round pick and an undisclosed conditional pick 
in exchange for Matt Flynn.[44] In addition to signing Matt Flynn, the 
Raiders also welcomed back Charles Woodson, signing him to a 1-year deal 
in mid-May.[45] The Oakland Raiders finished the 2013 season with a record 
of 4–12. In the 2014 Draft, the Raiders selected linebacker Khalil Mack 
in the first round and quarterback Derek Carr in the second round hoping 
each would anchor their side of the ball. Carr was given control early 
as he was chosen as the starter for the opener of the 2014 season. After 
an 0–4 start to the 2014 season, and an 8–28 overall record as head coach, 
Allen was fired.[46] Offensive line coach Tony Sparano was named interim 
head coach on September 30. The Oakland Raiders finished the 2014 season 
with a record of 3–13. Carr started all 16 games for the Raiders, the first 
Raider since 2002 to do so. First round pick Mack finished third in Defensive 
Rookie of the Year voting. On January 14, 2015, Jack Del Rio was hired 
to become the new head coach of the Oakland Raiders, replacing the fired 
Dennis Allen (who coincidentally had preceded him as the Broncos defensive 
coordinator) and interim head coach Tony Sparano.[47] The Raiders showed 
great improvement in Del Rio's first season, improving upon their 3 win 
2014 season, going 7–9 in the 2015 season. Rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper 
fulfilled almost all expectations and Derek Carr continued his improvement 
at quarterback. Cooper, Mack, Murray and Carr were selected to participate 
in the Pro Bowl. The Oakland Raiders finished the 1967 season with a 13–1–0 
record and won the 1967 AFL Championship. The Raiders have won a total 
of 3 Super Bowls. They won their first Super Bowl under John Madden. When 
the team was founded in 1960, a "name the team" contest was held by the 
Oakland Tribune. The winning name was the Oakland Señors.[48] After a few 
days of being the butt of local jokes (and accusations that the contest 
was fixed, as Chet Soda was fairly well known within the Oakland business 
community for calling his acquaintances "señor"), the fledgling team (and 
its owners) changed the team's name nine days later [49] to the Oakland 
Raiders, which had finished third in the naming contest.[50] The original 
team colors were black, gold and white. The now–familiar team emblem of 
a pirate (or "raider") wearing a football helmet was created, reportedly 
a rendition of actor Randolph Scott.[51] The original Raiders uniforms 
were black and gold, while the helmets were black with a white stripe and 
no logo. The team wore this design from 1960 to 1962.[52] When Al Davis 
became head coach and general manager in 1963, he changed the team's color 
scheme to silver and black, and added a logo to the helmet.[53] This logo 
is a shield that consists of the word "RAIDERS" at the top, two crossed 
cutlasses with handles up and cutting edge down, and superimposed head 
of a Raider wearing a football helmet and a black eye patch covering his 
right eye. Over the years, it has undergone minor color modifications (such 
as changing the background from silver to black in 1964), but it has essentially 
remained the same. The Raiders' current silver and black uniform design 
has essentially remained the same since it debuted in 1963. It consists 
of silver helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The 
black jerseys have silver lettering names and numbers, while the white 
jerseys have black lettering names and numbers with silver outlining the 
numbers only. Originally, the white jerseys had black letters for the names 
and silver numbers with a thick black outline, but they were changed to 
black with a silver outline for the 1964 season. In 1970, the team used 
silver numerals with black outline and black lettering names for the season. 
However, in 1971 the team again displayed black numerals and have stayed 
that way ever since (with the exception of the 1994 season as part of the 
NFL's 75th Anniversary where they donned the 1963 helmets with the 1970 
silver away numbers and black lettering names). The Raiders wore their 
white jerseys at home for the first time in their history on September 
28, 2008 against the San Diego Chargers. The decision was made by Lane 
Kiffin, who was coaching his final game for the Raiders, and was purportedly 
due to intense heat.[54] The high temperature in Oakland that day was 78°.[55] 
For the 2009 season, the Raiders took part in the AFL Legacy Program and 
wore 1960s throwback jerseys for games against other teams from the former 
AFL.[56] In the 2012 and 2013 seasons, the team wore black cleats as a 
tribute to Al Davis. However, the team reverted to white cleats in 2014. 
After splitting the first home season between Kezar Stadium and Candlestick, 
the Raiders moved exclusively to Candlestick Park in 1961, where total 
attendance for the season was about 50,000, and finished 2–12. Valley threatened 
to move the Raiders out of the area unless a stadium was built in Oakland, 
so in 1962 the Raiders moved into 18,000–seat Frank Youell Field (later 
expanded to 22,000 seats), their first home in Oakland.[57] It was a temporary 
home for the team while the 53,000 seat Oakland Alameda Coliseum was under 
construction; the Coliseum was completed in 1966. The Raiders have shared 
the Coliseum with the Oakland Athletics since the A's moved to Oakland 
from Kansas City in 1968, except for the years the Raiders called Los Angeles 
home (1982–94). The Raiders have defeated and lost to all 31 other NFL 
teams at the Coliseum at least once. The Raiders did play one regular season 
game at California Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, California. On September 
23, 1973 they played the Miami Dolphins in Berkeley due to a scheduling 
conflict with the Athletics. The team defeated the Dolphins 12–7, ending 
Miami's winning streak. During the Los Angeles years, the Raiders played 
in the 93,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Raiders have been 
linked to a number of new stadium projects, due to the age of Oakland Alameda 
Coliseum, being secondary tenants to Major League Baseball's Athletics, 
and the expiration of the team's lease at the end of 2016. There had been 
ongoing discussions for the Raiders to share Levi's Stadium with the San 
Francisco 49ers.[58] However, the 49ers went ahead without the Raiders 
and broke ground on the new $1.2 billion stadium on April 19, 2012[59] 
and have since sold $670 million worth of seats including 70% of club and 
luxury suites, making it unlikely that the Raiders would continue to explore 
the idea of sharing the stadium as they would now be secondary tenants 
with little to no commercial rights over the highly lucrative luxury suites.[60] 
Raiders' owner Mark Davis further increased the unlikelihood of the Raiders 
and the 49ers sharing Levi's stadium when he told NFL Network reporter 
Ian Rapoport that he has no plans to share the stadium but that he did 
recognize the Raiders' need for a new home and that he hoped the new home 
would be in Oakland.[61] If the Raiders move to Santa Clara, this would 
mark the second time the Raiders and 49ers use the same venue. Before the 
Coliseum was built, the Raiders shared Kezar Stadium with the 49ers in 
San Francisco in 1960. On February 19, 2015, the Raiders and the Chargers 
announced that they would build a privately financed $1.78 billion stadium 
in Carson, California if they were to move to the Los Angeles market.[62] 
Both teams stated that they would continue to attempt to get stadiums built 
in their respective cities.[63] The Carson City Council would bypass the 
public vote and approved the plan 3–0.[64] The council voted without having 
clarified several issues, including who would finance the stadium, how 
the required three-way land swap would be performed, and how it would raise 
enough revenue if only one team moved in as tenant.[65] On January 12, 
the NFL rejected the Raiders' relocation request. However, the NFL left 
open the possibility of the Raiders relocating to Los Angeles by 2019, 
playing in a new stadium under construction in Inglewood, California to 
house the Los Angeles Rams. The San Diego Chargers would have the first 
option to join the Rams at the new stadium, but the Raiders would be authorized 
to negotiate an agreement if the Chargers do not exercise their option 
by January 2017.[66] On March 21, 2016, Mark Davis said, "I know the site 
very much" and "I love this site very much, and I think it's a great opportunity" 
when he was asked about the Rams new stadium in Inglewood. On March 7, 
2012, then-mayor Jean Quan unveiled an ambitious project to the media that 
was designed to improve the sports facilities of all three major league 
sports teams in the city (the Raiders, Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Athletics 
and the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Golden State Warriors), 
as well as attract new businesses to the city. The project, dubbed Coliseum 
City, had entailed the redevelopment of the existing Oakland Alameda Coliseum 
complex. The redevelopment would have seen the construction of two new 
stadiums on the present location, a baseball-only stadium and a football-only 
stadium, while Oracle Arena, home of the Warriors, will be either rebuilt 
or undergo extensive renovations. A sum of $3.5 million was committed to 
preliminary planning on the project. However, no officials from either 
of Oakland's major league teams were present at the media conference. According 
to the San Francisco Business Times, Oakland's assistant city administrator 
Fred Blackwell said the Bay Investment Group LLC, an entity being formed 
by ColonyCapital LLC, Rashid Al Malik (chairman and CEO of HayaH Holdings), 
and the city, have numerous details to continue working out for the prospective 
$2 billion Coliseum City project, which covers 800 acres surrounding the 
Oakland Alameda Coliseum Complex. The development team also includes JRDV 
Urban International, HKS Architects, and Forest City Real Estate Services. 
In an ideal situation, construction could start by the end of 2014.[67] 
Meanwhile, as of 2014, the Warriors are going forward with plans to build 
a new arena at Mission Bay, not far from AT&T Park, and move back across 
the Bay Area from Oakland to San Francisco as soon as 2019. On May 23, 
2016, It was reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and other media outlets 
that a group led by NFL Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott and retired quarterback 
Rodney Peete are looking into building a new stadium for the Raiders. The 
group has met with team executives and Oakland city officials to brief 
them on their proposal. They have also met with mayor Libby Schaaf. The 
Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted to begin negotiations with Lott's 
group and with the city of Oakland regarding the "price and terms of sale" 
for the 120-acre land of the Oakland Coliseum and Oracle Arena. On July 
29, 2014, it was reported by the San Antonio Express-News that Mark Davis 
met with officials from the city of San Antonio to discuss the possibility 
of relocating the Raiders to San Antonio after the 2014–15 NFL season.[68] 
Davis confirmed that he did speak with San Antonio city officials while 
visiting San Antonio to honor former Raiders wide receiver Cliff Branch's 
induction into a local Hall of Fame, but did not comment on whether he 
was considering relocation to San Antonio.[69] San Antonio is home to the 
65,000-seat stadium known as the Alamodome, where the Raiders would play 
until a new stadium could be built. The abandoned Concord Naval Weapons 
Station, 26.6 miles from Oakland, was announced in 2013 as a possible location 
for a new stadium.[70] On January 29, 2016, team owner, Mark Davis, met 
with Las Vegas Sands owner Sheldon Adelson about possibly relocating to 
a $2.3 billion, 65,000 capacity domed stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. During 
Davis' meeting with Adelson, he also visited the University of Nevada, 
Las Vegas (UNLV), which included a contingent consisting of the university's 
president Len Jessup, former university president Donald Snyder, Steve 
Wynn, and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) owner Lorenzo Fertitta. 
The stadium is being proposed to replace Sam Boyd Stadium and would serve 
as the home of both the Raiders and the UNLV Rebels college football program. 
A relocation to Las Vegas would be a long-term proposal, as Sam Boyd Stadium 
is undersized for the NFL and there are no other professional-caliber stadiums 
in Nevada. Raiders officials were also in Las Vegas to tour locations in 
the valley for a potential new home; they were also on the 42-acre site 
of the proposed stadium to ask questions about the site Davis also was 
on an interview with Tim Kawakami and said that he had a "great" visit 
in the city he described it as "Interesting." Davis also said about Las 
Vegas that "it's absolutely an NFL city," and "It's an international city", 
adding, "it's a global city," as well as saying that "the Raider brand 
would do well" and "I think Las Vegas is coming along slowly".[71] On March 
21, 2016, when asked about Las Vegas, Davis said, "I think the Raiders 
like the Las Vegas plan," and "it's a very very very intriguing and exciting 
plan", referring to the stadium plan in Las Vegas. Davis also met with 
Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval about the stadium plan. On April 1, 2016, 
Davis toured Sam Boyd Stadium to evaluate whether UNLV could serve as a 
temporary home of the team and was with UNLV football coach Tony Sanchez, 
athletic director Tina Kunzer-Murphy, adviser Don Snyder and school president 
Len Jessup to further explore the possibility of the Raiders moving to 
Las Vegas. On April 28, 2016, Davis said he wanted to move the Raiders 
to Las Vegas and pledged $500 million toward the construction of a proposed 
$2.4 billion domed stadium.[72][73] "Together we can turn the Silver State 
into the silver and black state", Davis said.[72][74] At a media conference 
in UNLV's Stan Fulton Building, Davis also said the club had "made a commitment 
to Las Vegas at this point in time and that's where it stands." In an interview 
with ESPN after returning from a meeting for the 2016 NFL draft he expanded 
upon reasons why Southern Nevada held a certain appeal over the East Bay 
of the Oakland–San Francisco Bay Area, how he tried to make it work in 
Oakland and why (as he told Sandoval) he hopes to turn Nevada into the 
"Silver and Black State"; he also spoke of the meeting saying, "It was 
a positive, well-organized presentation that I believe was well-received", 
and stating, "It was a very positive step in finding the Raiders a home." 
On May 20, 2016, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said he would 
support Davis and the Raiders move to Las Vegas, stating, "I think it would 
be good for the NFL."[75] If the Raiders were to move to Las Vegas the 
only competition they would have is Las Vegas new NHL team. On August 11, 
2016, Raiders officials met with Northern Nevada officials about the possibility 
of Reno being the site of a new training camp/practice facility and toured 
several sites including the University of Nevada, Reno, Reno area high 
schools, and sports complexes. [76] On August 25, 2016, the Raiders filed 
a trademark application for "Las Vegas Raiders" on the same day renderings 
of a new stadium (located west of Interstate 15 at Las Vegas) were released 
to the public.[77] On September 15, 2016, the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure 
Committee unanimously voted to recommend and approve $750 million for the 
Las Vegas stadium plan.[78] On October 11, 2016, the Nevada Senate voted 
16–5 to approve the funding bill for the Las Vegas stadium proposal.[79] 
The Nevada Assembly voted 28–13 three days later to approve the bill to 
fund the new Las Vegas stadium proposal, two days later Sandoval signed 
the funding bill into law.[80] Davis told ESPN on October 15, 2016 that 
even if the Raiders are approved by the league to relocate to the Las Vegas 
metropolitan area, the club would play the next two seasons at the Oakland 
Alameda Coliseum in 2017 and 2018, stating "We want to bring a Super Bowl 
championship back to the Bay Area".[81] The team would then play at a temporary 
facility in 2019 after its lease at the Coliseum expires. On October 17, 
2016, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed into law Senate Bill 1 and 
Assembly Bill 1 which approved a hotel room rate tax increase to accommodate 
$750 million in public funding for the new stadium.[82][83] On November 
12, 2016, a report from the NFL's own in-house media team outlined how 
Las Vegas might not be a done deal. The report stated that the majority 
of owners favor the Raiders staying in Oakland due to market size stability 
and size. The vast majority of the NFL's revenue comes from TV contracts. 
So because of that, it made little sense for the other 31 NFL owners to 
vote in favor of one of their partners abandoning the 6th biggest media 
market for the 42nd. It remains to be seen if the leverage created in Las 
Vegas will result in a stadium deal in Oakland or if a no-move vote from 
the other owners will simply start the stadium search process over again.[84] 
Al Davis coined slogans such as "Pride and Poise", "Commitment to Excellence", 
and "Just Win, Baby"—all of which are registered trademarks of the team.[85] 
"Commitment to Excellence" comes from a quote of Vince Lombardi, "The quality 
of a person's life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, 
regardless of their chosen field of endeavor."[86] The nickname Raider 
Nation refers to the die hard fans of the team spread throughout the United 
States and the world.[87] Members of the Raider Nation who attend home 
games are known for arriving to the stadium early, tailgating, and dressing 
up in face masks and black outfits. The Raider Nation is also known for 
the Black Hole, a specific area of the Coliseum (sections 104–107) frequented 
by the team's rowdiest and most fervent fans.[88][89][90] Al Davis created 
the phrase Raider Nation in 1968. In September 2009, Ice Cube recorded 
a song for the Raiders named "Raider Nation".[citation needed] In 2010, 
he took part in a documentary for ESPN's 30 for 30 series titled Straight 
Outta L.A..[91] It mainly focuses on N.W.A and the effect of the Raiders' 
image on their persona.[92] The Oakland Raiderettes are the cheerleading 
squad for the Oakland Raiders. They were established in 1961 as the Oakland 
Raiderettes. During the team's time in Los Angeles they were the Los Angeles 
Raiderettes. They have been billed as "Football's Fabulous Females". Raider 
games are broadcast in English on 16 radio stations in California, including 
flagship station KGMZ 95.7 (FM) "The Game" in San Francisco. Additionally, 
games are broadcast on 20 radio stations in Nevada, Oregon, Colorado, Idaho, 
Hawaii, Virginia, Texas, Arkansas, Nebraska and Georgia. Greg Papa is the 
play-by-play announcer, with former Raider coach and quarterback Tom Flores 
doing commentary. George Atkinson and Jim Plunkett offer pre- and post-game 
commentary. Compass Media Networks is responsible for producing and distributing 
Raiders radio broadcasts. Bill King was the voice of the Raiders from 1966 
to 1992, during which time he called approximately 600 games. The Raiders 
awarded him rings for all three of their Super Bowl victories. It is King's 
radio audio heard on most of the NFL Films highlight footage of the Raiders. 
King's call of the Holy Roller has been labeled (by Chris Berman, among 
others) as one of the five best in NFL history. King died in October 2005 
from complications after surgery. Former San Francisco 49ers tight end 
Monty Stickles and Scotty Stirling, an Oakland Tribune sportswriter, served 
as "color men" with King. The Raider games were called on radio from 1960 
to 1962 by Bud (Wilson Keene) Foster and Mel Venter, and from 1963 to 1965 
by Bob Blum and Dan Galvin. Raiders' games are broadcast locally on CBS 
affiliate KPIX (when playing an AFC opponent) and on Fox affiliate KTVU 
(when hosting an NFC opponent), unless the game is blacked out locally. 
Sunday night and a few Thursday night games are on NBC affiliate KNTV. 
The Raiders are a beneficiary of league scheduling policies. Both the Raiders 
and the San Francisco 49ers share the San Francisco Bay Area market, and 
said market is on the West Coast of the United States. This means that 
the Raiders cannot play home games or most division games in the early 
10:00 a.m. Pacific time slot, nor can they play interconference home games 
at the same time or network as the 49ers. As a result, both teams generally 
have more limited scheduling options, and also benefit by receiving more 
prime time games than usual. The Oakland Raiders have four primary rivals: 
their divisional rivals (Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs, and San Diego 
Chargers) and their geographic rival, the San Francisco 49ers. They also 
have rivalries with other teams that arose from playoff battles in the 
past, most notably with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots. 
The Seattle Seahawks have an old rivalry with Oakland as well, but the 
rivalry became less relevant when the Seahawks moved to the NFC West as 
part of the NFL's 2002 realignment. The Broncos and Raiders have been divisional 
rivals since the two teams began play in the AFL in 1960. The Raiders had 
a 14-game winning streak against the Broncos from 1965 to 1971, lasted 
until October 22, 1972 when the Broncos defeated the Raiders 30–23. While 
the Raiders still hold the advantage in the all-time series 60–49–2, the 
Broncos amassed 21 wins in 28 games, from the 1995 season and the arrival 
of Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan, through the 2008 season. Shanahan 
coached the Raiders before being fired just four games into the 1989 season, 
which has only served to intensify this rivalry. On Sunday, October 24, 
2010, the Raiders beat the Broncos (59–14), giving the Raiders the most 
points scored in a game in the team's history. On December 13, 2015, The 
Raiders pulled a huge upset on the Broncos (15–12) by a spectacular performance 
from their defense allowing 4 field goals. Linebacker Khalil Mack who recorded 
5 sacks In that game against Denver which is tied the most sacks in franchise 
along with Howie Long. The Broncos' first ever Super Bowl appearance (in 
the 1977 season) was made possible by defeating Oakland in the AFC Championship. 
Final Score was 20–17. The Chiefs and Raiders have had several memorable 
matches and have a bitter divisional rivalry. Oakland lost the 1969 AFL 
Championship against Kansas City, who went on to beat the Minnesota Vikings 
and win the Super Bowl. From 1990 to 1999, the Raiders have lost 17 out 
of 20 regular season meetings between the Chiefs, including a 10–game losing 
streak at Kansas City; the Raiders also lost to the Chiefs on December 
28, 1991 Wild Card Playoffs; final score was 10–6. On September 8, 1996, 
the Chiefs also began to lead the overall series against the Raiders for 
the first time since November 23, 1969. On January 1, 2000, the last game 
of the 1999 NFL regular season, the Raiders defeated the Chiefs for the 
1st time in Kansas City since 1988 in overtime on a 33–yard field goal 
kick made by Joe Nedney. Kansas City leads the overall series 52–58–2. 
The San Diego Chargers' rivalry with Oakland dates to the 1963 season, 
when the Raiders defeated the heavily favored Chargers twice, both come-from-behind 
fourth quarter victories. The Raiders have had a temporary fantastic winning 
streak without losing to the Chargers of a 16–0–2 record from 1968 to 1977. 
One of the most memorable games between these teams was the "Holy Roller" 
game in 1978, in which the Raiders fumbled for a touchdown in a very controversial 
play. In January 1981, the Chargers hosted their first AFC title against 
the Raiders. The Raiders were victorious over the Chargers of a score 34–27. 
The Raiders ended up moving on to play in Super Bowl 15 defeating the Eagles 
27–10. On November 22, 1982, the Raiders hosted their first Monday Night 
football game in Los Angeles against the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers 
led the game in the 1st half 24–0 until the Raiders came into the 2nd half 
and made a huge comeback and defeated the San Diego Chargers 28–24. On 
October 10, 2010, The Raiders ended their 13-game losing streak to the 
San Diego Chargers with a score of 35–27. The Raiders hold the overall 
series advantage at 59–50–2. The San Francisco 49ers, located on the other 
side of San Francisco Bay, are the Raiders' geographic rivals. The first 
exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the 
AFL Raiders 13–10. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38–7. 
As a result, games between the two are referred to as the "Battle of the 
Bay."[93][94] Since the two teams play in different conferences, regular-season 
matchups happen at least every four years. Fans and players of the winning 
team can claim "bragging rights" as the better team in the area. On August 
20, 2011, in the third week of the preseason, the preseason game between 
the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at Candlestick 
Park, including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. 
The NFL has decided to cancel all future preseason games between the Raiders 
and 49ers. The Raiders currently lead the all-time regular season series 
with 7 wins to the 49ers' 6. Oakland won the latest matchup at home 24–13, 
on December 7 in Week 14 of the 2014 regular season. Unless the two teams 
meet in the Super Bowl, or the NFL scheduling formula is reconfigured, 
the next matchup will be in 2018. The rivalry between the Raiders and New 
England Patriots dates to their time in the AFL, but was intensified during 
a 1978 preseason game, when Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley was 
permanently paralyzed after a vicious hit delivered by Raiders free safety 
Jack Tatum. Before that, New England also lost a playoff game in 1976 to 
the Raiders; the game is unofficially known as "The Ben Dreith Game" due 
to a controversial penalty by head referee Dreith. The two teams met in 
a divisional-round playoff game in 2002, which became known as the "Tuck 
Rule Game". Late in the game, an incomplete pass, ruled a fumble, by Patriots 
quarterback Tom Brady was overturned, and New England went on to win in 
overtime and eventually won the Super Bowl against the heavily favored 
St. Louis Rams, the Raiders' former crosstown rivals in Los Angeles.[95] 
Since that game, the Patriots have won four of the last five regular season 
contests between the two teams. The first contest being the following year 
during the 2002 season in Oakland, with the Raiders winning 27–20; they 
met in the 2005 season opener in New England with the Patriots ruining 
Randy Moss' debut as a Raider 30–20; the Patriots defeated the Raiders 
49–26 in December 2008 in Bill Belichick's 100th regular season win as 
Patriots coach; a Patriots 31–19 win during the 2011 season; and the most 
recent being a scrappy 16–9 Patriots win in the third week of the 2014 
season. The New York Jets began a strong rivalry with the Raiders in the 
AFL during the 1960s that continued through much of the 1970s, fueled in 
part by Raider Ike Lassiter breaking star quarterback Joe Namath's jaw 
during a 1967 game (though Ben Davidson wrongly got blamed),[96] the famous 
Heidi Game during the 1968 season, and the Raiders' bitter loss to the 
Jets in the AFL Championship later that season. The rivalry waned in later 
years, but saw a minor resurgence in the 2000–02 period.[97][98] The Jets 
edged the Raiders in the final week of the 2001 season 24–22 on a last-second 
John Hall field goal; the Raiders hosted the Jets in the Wild Card round 
the following Saturday and won 38–24. In the 2002 season the Raiders defeated 
the Jets 26–20 in December, then defeated them again in the AFC Divisional 
Playoffs, 30–10. The Raiders lost the 37–27 on December 8, 2013, but won 
the most recent matchup 20–34 on November 1, 2015.[99] Rivalries that have 
waned in recent[when?] years have been with the Miami Dolphins and Houston 
Oilers/Tennessee Titans. The Raiders faced the Dolphins twice in the early 
1970s; the Dolphins defeated the Raiders in the 1973 AFC Championship Game 
27–10 on their way to Super Bowl VIII. The next year in the divisional 
playoffs the Raiders trailed Miami 26–21; in the final minute the Raiders 
drove to the Miami eight yard line; a desperation pass by Ken Stabler was 
caught in traffic by Clarence Davis in the play known as the "Sea Of Hands." 
The Pittsburgh Steelers' rivalry with the Raiders has historically been 
very tight; as of the 2015 season the Raiders lead the rivalry 12 wins 
to 11, and their playoff rivalry is tied 3–3. The rivalry was extremely 
intense during the 1970s. The Steelers knocked the Raiders out of the playoffs 
in three of four consecutive seasons in the early 1970s (the first loss 
was the "Immaculate Reception" game) until the Raiders finally beat the 
Steelers in the 1976 AFC Championship (and went on to win Super Bowl XI). 
During the 1975 AFC Championship game, Raiders strong safety George Atkinson 
delivered a hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver Lynn Swann that gave him a 
concussion. When the two teams met in the 1976 season opener, Atkinson 
hit Swann again and gave him another concussion. After the second incident, 
Steelers head coach Chuck Noll referred to Atkinson as part of the "criminal 
element" in the NFL. Atkinson filed a $2 million defamation lawsuit against 
Noll and the Steelers, which he lost.[100] The two clubs' three most recent 
contests harkened back to the rivalry's history of bitterness and close 
competition. On December 6, 2009 the 3–8 Raiders helped spoil the defending 
champions' quest for the playoffs as the game lead changed five times in 
the fourth quarter and a Louis Murphy touchdown with 11 seconds to go won 
it 27–24 for the Raiders. Oakland was then beaten 35–3 by Pittsburgh on 
November 21, 2010; this game brought out the roughness of the rivalry's 
1970s history when Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was punched 
by Raiders defensive end Richard Seymour following a touchdown. Most recently, 
on November 8, 2015 the Steelers outplayed the Raiders for a 38-35 victory. 
During the game the Raiders defense allowed wide receiver Antonio Brown 
to catch 17 passes for 284 yards. Both are Steelers team records and the 
284 yards is the 7th most yards receiving in a game in NFL history. The 
Raiders faced the Houston Oilers throughout the AFL era and twice in AFL 
playoffs in the late 1960s, winning 40–7 in 1967 on their way to Super 
Bowl II and 56–7 in the 1969 divisional playoffs. Oakland defeated the 
Oilers in the 1980 Wild Card playoffs 27–7 and defeated the Titans in the 
2002 AFC Championship Game 41–24; the combined scores of these four games 
is 164–45. As mentioned earlier, the Oakland Raiders and Los Angeles Rams 
had a rivalry during the 13 years both teams shared the Los Angeles market. 
The teams met six times in the regular season in this period; Raiders won 
the 1st meeting 37–31 when both teams met in this period in December 18, 
1982, with the Raiders winning four times during the battle of Los Angeles. 
Notes: Max Winter, a Minneapolis businessman was among the eight proposed 
franchise owners in the American Football League. In a move typical of 
the NFL owners who were frightened by the prospect of competition and continually 
obstructed the new league, they offered Winter an expansion franchise in 
the NFL. This was AFTER the NFL had rejected Lamar Hunt's feelers, saying 
they were not interested in expansion. One of many obfuscations put forward 
by the NFL in its attempt to derail the AFL. After the AFL's first draft, 
in which players were selected for the THEN-NAMELESS Minneapolis franchise, 
Winter reneged from his agreement with the AFL owners and defected to the 
NFL with a franchise that started play in 1961 and was named the Minnesota 
Vikings. The Vikings were never an AFL team, nor did they have any association 
with the AFL. Many of the players (including Abner Haynes) that had been 
assigned to the UNNAMED and defunct Minneapolis AFL franchise were signed 
by some of the seven loyal remaining members of the AFL's 'Foolish Club'. 
The city of Oakland was awarded the eighth AFL franchise on January 30, 
1960. Once the consortium of owners was found for the eighth franchise, 
the team was named the Raiders.[102][103] Because many of the defunct Minneapolis 
franchise's originally drafted players were signed by other AFL teams, 
the AFL held an 'allocation' draft, in which each team earmarked players 
that could be chosen by the Raiders. The Minneapolis group did not take 
with them any of the rights to players they drafted when they defected 
to the NFL, because their first draft in that league was in 1961. The Raiders 
were not originally in Minnesota as some claim. They were a new, charter 
franchise in the American Football League. One reason they were so weak 
in the first few years of the AFL was that the other AFL teams did not 
make quality players available in the allocation draft. At the time, Oakland 
seemed an unlikely venue for a professional football team. The city had 
not asked for a team, there was no ownership group and there was no stadium 
in Oakland suitable for pro football (the closest stadiums were in Berkeley 
and San Francisco) and there was already a successful NFL franchise in 
the Bay Area in the San Francisco 49ers. However, the AFL owners selected 
Oakland after Los Angeles Chargers owner Barron Hilton threatened to forfeit 
his franchise unless a second team was placed on the West Coast.[104] Upon 
receiving the franchise, Oakland civic leaders found a number of businesspeople 
willing to invest in the new team. A limited partnership was formed to 
own the team headed by managing general partner Y. Charles (Chet) Soda 
(1908–89), a local real estate developer, and included general partners 
Ed McGah (1899–1983), Robert Osborne (1898–1968), F. Wayne Valley (1914–86), 
restaurateur Harvey Binns (1914–82), Don Blessing (1904–2000), and contractor 
Charles Harney (1902–62)[105] as well as numerous limited partners. The 
Raiders finished their first campaign with a 6–8 record, and lost $500,000. 
Desperately in need of money to continue running the team, Valley received 
a $400,000 loan from Buffalo Bills founder Ralph C. Wilson Jr.[106] After 
the conclusion of the first season Soda dropped out of the partnership, 
and on January 17, 1961, Valley, McGah and Osborne bought out the remaining 
four general partners. Soon after, Valley and McGah purchased Osborne's 
interest, with Valley named as the managing general partner. In 1962, Valley 
hired Al Davis, a former assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers, as 
head coach and general manager. In April 1966, Davis left the Raiders after 
being named AFL Commissioner. Two months later, the league announced its 
merger with the NFL. With the merger, the position of commissioner was 
no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about 
returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part owner 
of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for US $18,000, and 
became the team's third general partner — the partner in charge of football 
operations.[11][12] In 1972, with Wayne Valley out of the country for several 
weeks attending the Olympic Games in Munich, Davis's attorneys drafted 
a revised partnership agreement that gave him total control over all of 
the Raiders' operations. McGah, a supporter of Davis, signed the agreement. 
Under partnership law, by a 2–1 vote of the general partners, the new agreement 
was thus ratified. Valley was furious when he discovered this, and immediately 
filed suit to have the new agreement overturned, but the court sided with 
Davis and McGah. In 1976, Valley sold his interest in the team, and Davis 
— who now owned only 25% of the Raiders — was firmly in charge.[11][107] 
Legally, the club is a limited partnership with nine partners — Davis' 
heirs and the heirs of the original eight team partners. From 1972 onward, 
Davis had exercised near-complete control as president of the team's general 
partner, A.D. Football, Inc. Although exact ownership stakes are not known, 
it has been reported that Davis owned 47% of the team shares before his 
death in 2011.[108] Ed McGah, the last of the original eight general partners 
of the Raiders, died in September 1983. Upon his death, his interest was 
devised to a family trust, of which his son, E.J. McGah, was the trustee. 
The younger McGah was himself a part-owner of the team, as a limited partner, 
and died in 2002. Several members of the McGah family filed suit against 
Davis in October 2003, alleging mismanagement of the team by Davis. The 
lawsuit sought monetary damages and to remove Davis and A. D. Football, 
Inc. as the team's managing general partner. Among their specific complaints, 
the McGahs alleged that Davis failed to provide them with detailed financial 
information previously provided to Ed and E.J. McGah. The Raiders countered 
that—under the terms of the partnership agreement as amended in 1972—upon 
the death of the elder McGah in 1983, his general partner interest converted 
to that of a limited partner. The team continued to provide the financial 
information to the younger McGah as a courtesy, though it was under no 
obligation to do so.[109] The majority of the lawsuit was dismissed in 
April 2004, when an Alameda County Superior Court judge ruled that the 
case lacked merit since none of the other partners took part in the lawsuit.[110] 
In October 2005, the lawsuit was settled out of court. The terms of the 
settlement are confidential, but it was reported that under its terms Davis 
purchased the McGah family's interest in the Raiders (approximately 31%), 
which gave him for the first time a majority interest, speculated to be 
approximately 67% of the team. As a result of the settlement, confidential 
details concerning Al Davis and the ownership of the Raiders were not released 
to the public.[111] His ownership share went down to 47% when he sold 20% 
of the team to Wall Street investors [108] In 2006, it was reported that 
Davis had been attempting to sell the 31% ownership stake in the team obtained 
from the McGah family. He was unsuccessful in this effort, reportedly because 
the sale would not give the purchaser any control of the Raiders, even 
in the event of Davis's death.[112] Al Davis died on October 8, 2011, at 
82. According to a 1999 partnership agreement, Davis' interest passed to 
his wife, Carol.[112][dead link] After Davis' death, Raiders chief executive 
Amy Trask said that the team "will remain in the Davis family."[5] Al and 
Carol's son, Mark, inherited his father's old post as managing general 
partner and serves as the public face of the ownership. According to a 
2006 report released by Forbes Magazine, the Raiders' overall team value 
of US $736 million ranked 28th out of 32 NFL teams.[113] The team ranked 
in the bottom three in league attendance from 2003 to 2005, and failed 
to sell out a majority of their home games. One of the reasons cited for 
the poor attendance figures was the decision to issue costly personal seat 
licenses (PSLs) upon the Raiders' return to Oakland in 1995. The PSLs, 
which ranged in cost from $250 to $4,000, were meant to help repay the 
$200 million it cost the city of Oakland and Alameda County to expand Overstock.com 
Coliseum. They were only valid for ten years, however, while other teams 
issue them permanently. As a result, fewer than 31,000 PSLs were sold for 
a stadium that holds twice that number. Since 1995, television blackouts 
of Raiders home games have been common.[114] In November 2005, the team 
announced that it was taking over ticket sales from the privately run Oakland 
Football Marketing Association (OFMA), and abolishing PSLs.[114][dead link] 
In February 2006, the team also announced that it would lower ticket prices 
for most areas of Overstock.com Coliseum.[115] Just prior to the start 
of the 2006 NFL season, the Raiders revealed that they had sold 37,000 
season tickets, up from 29,000 the previous year.[116] Despite the team's 
2–14 record, they sold out six of their eight home games in 2006.[117][not 
in citation given] The Raiders and Al Davis have been involved in several 
lawsuits throughout their history, including ones against the NFL. When 
the NFL declined to approve the Raiders' move from Oakland to Los Angeles 
in 1980, the team joined the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission in 
a lawsuit against the league alleging a violation of antitrust laws.[118] 
The Coliseum Commission received a settlement from the NFL of $19.6 million 
in 1987.[119] In 1986, Davis testified on behalf of the United States Football 
League in their unsuccessful antitrust lawsuit against the NFL. He was 
the only NFL owner to do so.[120] After relocating back to Oakland, the 
team sued the NFL for interfering with their negotiations to build a new 
stadium at Hollywood Park prior to the move. The Raiders' lawsuit further 
contended that they had the rights to the Los Angeles market, and thus 
were entitled to compensation from the league for giving up those rights 
by moving to Oakland. A jury found in favor of the NFL in 2001, but the 
verdict was overturned a year later due to alleged juror misconduct. In 
February 2005, a California Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the original 
verdict.[121] When the Raiders moved back from Los Angeles in 1995, the 
city of Oakland and the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority agreed 
to sell Personal Seat Licenses (PSLs) to help pay for the renovations to 
their stadium. But after games rarely sold out, the Raiders filed suit, 
claiming that they were misled by the city and the Coliseum Authority with 
the false promise that there would be sellouts. On November 2, 2005, a 
settlement was announced, part of which was the abolishment of PSLs as 
of the 2006 season.[122] In 1996, the team sued the NFL in Santa Clara 
County, California, in a lawsuit that ultimately included 22 separate causes 
of action. Included in the team's claims were claims that the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers' pirate logo diluted the team's California trademark in its 
own pirate logo and for trade dress dilution on the ground that the League 
had improperly permitted other teams (including the Buccaneers and Carolina 
Panthers) to adopt colors for their uniforms similar to those of the Raiders. 
Among other things, the lawsuit sought an injunction to prevent the Buccaneers 
and Panthers from wearing their uniforms while playing in California. In 
2003, these claims were dismissed on summary judgment because the relief 
sought would violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.[123] 
In 2003, a number of current and former Oakland players such as Bill Romanowski, 
Tyrone Wheatley, Barrett Robbins, Chris Cooper and Dana Stubblefield were 
named as clients of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO). BALCO 
was an American company led by founder and owner Victor Conte. In 2003, 
journalists Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada investigated the company's 
role in a drug sports scandal later referred to as the BALCO Affair. BALCO 
marketed tetrahydrogestrinone ("the Clear"), a then-undetected, performance-enhancing 
steroid developed by chemist Patrick Arnold. Conte, BALCO vice president 
James Valente, weight trainer Greg Anderson and coach Remi Korchemny had 
supplied a number of high-profile sports stars from the United States and 
Europe with the Clear and human growth hormone for several years. Headquartered 
in Burlingame, California, BALCO was founded in 1984. Officially, BALCO 
was a service business for blood and urine analysis and food supplements. 
In 1988, Victor Conte offered free blood and urine tests to a group of 
athletes known as the BALCO Olympians. He then was allowed to attend the 
Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. From 1996 Conte worked with well-known 
American football star Bill Romanowski, who proved to be useful to establish 
new connections to athletes and coaches.[124] Running backs Wide receivers
