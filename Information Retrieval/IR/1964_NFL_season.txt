The 1964 NFL season was the 45th regular season of the National Football 
League. Before the season started, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle reinstated 
Green Bay Packers running back Paul Hornung and Detroit Lions defensive 
tackle Alex Karras, who had been suspended for the 1963 season due to gambling. 
This season is noteworthy for a change in uniform rules – while the league 
had dictated since 1957 that the home team must wear a colored jersey and 
the visitors a white one, teams were now given the option of wearing their 
white jerseys at home. As a result, the Browns, Cardinals, Colts (except 
for one home game which was originally scheduled to be an away game), Cowboys, 
Rams, Redskins, Steelers (for one game) and Vikings (except for most of 
one game in which the Lions forgot to bring their blue jerseys) [1] did 
so; while the rest reverted to home colors the following year, the Cardinals 
would not wear red at home until 1966, the Rams would not do so again until 
1972, the Browns only once until 1975, and the Cowboys, aside from an unwilling 
use of their blue tops as the "home" team in Super Bowl V, have since continuously 
worn white at home. The season ended when the Cleveland Browns shut out 
the Baltimore Colts 27–0 in the NFL Championship Game. The Western Conference 
race started with Baltimore losing its opener at Minnesota, 34–24. After 
that, the Colts went on an 11-game winning streak, taking the lead on October 
4 with their 35–20 win over the Rams, and clinching a spot in the title 
game on November 22. In the Eastern Conference, the Browns and the Cardinals 
played to a 33–33 tie on September 20, and were both 4–1–1 after six games. 
In Week Seven, Cleveland beat New York 42–20, while St. Louis fell to Dallas, 
31–13. When the Cardinals beat the Browns 28–19 in Week Thirteen, they 
were only a game behind and needed a win and a Cleveland loss to have a 
chance for a playoff. St. Louis won, 36–34 in Philadelphia, but Cleveland 
also won, 52–20 over the Giants. W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, PCT= Winning
