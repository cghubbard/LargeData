Garfield is a city in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 
2010 United States Census, the city's population was 30,487,[10][11][12] 
reflecting an increase of 701 (+2.4%) from the 29,786 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 3,059 (+11.4%) from the 26,727 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[21] Garfield is one of the most contaminated locations 
in the United States due to chromium water contamination from a spill at 
the E.C. Electroplating Corporation site.[22][23] When the area that is 
now Garfield was first developed in 1873, it was known as East Passaic. 
In 1881, the community's name was changed to Garfield in honor of President 
of the United States James Garfield.[24][25][26] There are two explanations 
given for the circumstances behind the renaming. According to one, shortly 
after Garfield was elected to the presidency the founder of East Passaic 
said, "tell everyone...don't speak of East Passaic anymore; call it 'Garfield' 
after the man who will lead this great country to prosperity." Seven months 
later, President Garfield was assassinated but his name remained with the 
community.[27] The second theory holds that after Garfield's death in 1881, 
a new train station was named in his honor, which in turn led to the surrounding 
area becoming associated with his name as well.[28] Garfield was originally 
incorporated as a borough on March 15, 1898, from portions of Saddle River 
Township and Wallington. At the time, the New Jersey Legislature set Garfield's 
boundaries as they exist today. On April 19, 1917, the borough became the 
City of Garfield, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier.[29] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area 
of 2.160 square miles (5.594 km2), including 2.099 square miles (5.436 km2) 
of land and 0.061 square miles (0.158 km2) of water (2.82%).[2][3] Unincorporated 
communities, localities and place names located partially or completely 
within the township include Belmont, Bogart Heights, Dundee Dam and Plauderville.[30] 
The city has land borders with adjacent Elmwood Park, Lodi, Saddle Brook 
and South Hackensack. The Saddle River is a shared border with Wallington. 
There are three bridges over the Passaic River crossing the municipal and 
county line to Passaic and Clifton in Passaic County.[31] The borough is 
also home to an architecturally prominent Russian Orthodox church,[41] 
which serves the growing Ukrainian American community in western Bergen 
County. At the 2010 United States Census, there were 30,487 people, 11,073

1923 Municipal Manager Law of New Jersey municipal government and is governed 
by a City Manager and a five-member Council. Council members are elected 
at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve four-year terms on a concurrent 
basis.[8] In November 2015, following a referendum that supported the move 
by a 3-1 margin, the City Council voted to shift the city's municipal elections 
from May to November, citing hopes for greater voter participation and 
potential savings of $50,000 for each election. The next municipal election 
will be held on November 8, 2016, together with the presidential election, 
and will result in the extension of current terms for council and the municipal 
manager by six months, to the end of December 2016.[46] At a reorganization 
meeting held after each election, the Council selects one of its members 
to be the Mayor and another to serve as Deputy Mayor. The day-to-day operation 
of the city is carried on under the supervision of the appointed department 
heads, who report to the City Manager. As of 2016[update], members of the 
Garfield City Council are Mayor Tana M. Raymond, Deputy Mayor Glenn A. 
Mati, Louis G. Aloia, Frank J. Calandriello and Joseph Delaney, all serving 
terms of office ending June 30, 2016.[4][47] Garfield is located in the
