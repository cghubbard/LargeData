Kolten Kaha Wong (born October 10, 1990) is an American professional baseball 
second baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He made his MLB debut in 2013. He bats left-handed and throws right-handed. 
From Hilo, Hawaii, Wong starred in baseball at Kamehameha Hawaii High School 
and for the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Cardinals selected Wong 
in the first round of the 2011 MLB draft, and promoted him to the major 
leagues two years later. He has become the Cardinals' starting second baseman, 
and was named the National League Rookie of the Month for May 2014. He 
is currently signed through 2020 with a team option for 2021. Kolten Wong 
is the son of Kaha Wong, who played college baseball at the University 
of Southern California (USC), and spent two years in the minor leagues 
with the Reno Silver Sox in Class-A.[1][2] Despite batting .280 in 157 
games, the elder Wong returned home to Hilo, Hawaii, to raise his family.[1][3] 
He rose to prominence as a baseball coach in Hawaii.[2] Instead of pursuing 
a steady career, he took whatever jobs would afford him the most time to 
teach Kolten the game and about working out, which he emphasized on a daily 
basis. In time, Kolten Wong befriended mixed martial artist and Ultimate 
Fighting Championship star B. J. Penn, whose father, Jay Dee Penn, correspondingly 
befriended Kaha Wong. The Penns ran a gym which allowed Kaha Wong to train 
children how to swing a bat.[1] Kolten's paternal great-grandparents were 
Chinese.[4] To train as a baseball player, Wong spent two hours daily cutting 
trees with an axe to improve his strength and daily sessions in a batting 
cage. Kolten participated in the Cal Ripken World Series in Aberdeen, Maryland 
where he led his team, Pacific Southwest, to the championship. He also 
played in the 2007 Senior League Baseball World Series, with his team from 
Hilo American Little League.[5] His younger brother, Kean, played in the 
Junior Little League World Series.[1] Wong was a two-sport star at Kamehameha 
Hawaii High School in Keaau, Hawaii, playing baseball and football.[6] 
As a baseball standout, Wong batted .600 during his senior year and was 
named a co-winner for the 2008 Hawaii Baseball Player of the Year honor.[6] 
Wong was a top scholar as well.[7] The Minnesota Twins drafted him in the 
16th round of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. A scout from the Twins 
presented Wong with a $75,000 contract offer, which he refused, stating 
that "after taxes, it's not even that much."[1] Wong chose not to sign, 
opting to attend the University of Hawaii, where he played college baseball 
for the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors.[7] In a game against Loyola Marymount 
in his freshman year, he hit three home runs (HR). The Rainbow Warriors 
won a Western Athletic Conference (WAC) tournament in his sophomore year 
and a regular season championship. Against Louisiana Tech in the WAC tournament, 
he hit the game-tying and game-winning home runs. Wong was a three-time 
first-team All-WAC selection.[8] As a freshman, he played center field 
and batted .341 with 11 HR. During his sophomore year, he hit .357 with 
a .534 slugging percentage (SLG), .436 on-base percentage (OBP), 19 stolen 
bases and 40 runs batted in (RBIs).[1][2] Playing for the Orleans Firebirds 
of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) in 2010, he was named a CCBL All-Star 
and the Pat Sorenti Most Valuable Player.[9][10] His batting average (.341) 
placed third, slugging fourth (.452), OBP second (.426), and stolen bases 
second (22). He made just four errors in 145 chances for a .972 fielding 
percentage.[9] During his junior year at Hawaii, Wong led the team in batting 
average at .378 and was fourth in the WAC; he also finished fourth in the 
WAC in SLG (.560) and third in OBP at .492. Other totals included 48 runs 
scored, 11 doubles, seven home runs, 23 stolen bases, and 42 bases on balls.[8] 
Wong was named a Baseball America All-American in 2011.[11] He finished 
his college career with a .358 batting average (245 hits in 684 at-bats), 
47 doubles, 25 home runs, 145 RBIs, a .563 SLG and .449 OBP. He stole 53 
bases in 71 attempts.[12] Eligible for the amateur draft after his junior 
season at Hawaii, the Cardinals selected Wong in the first round, with 
the 22nd overall selection, of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. According 
to MLB.com, he was the #4-ranked prospect in the Cardinals organization.[7] 
He made his professional debut that season with the Quad Cities River Bandits 
of the Class A Midwest League. In 47 games, he batted .335 with 15 doubles, 
five home runs, 25 RBIs, and nine stolen bases. After earning a promotion 
to the Springfield Cardinals of the Class AA Texas League in 2012, Wong 
batted .287 with 52 RBIs and 21 stolen bases.[7] He was selected for the 
2012 All-Star Futures Game.[13] Wong finished the year playing in the Arizona 
Fall League (AFL), where he batted .324 with 12 RBIs and five stolen bases.[6] 
He was selected for the AFL "Top Prospect" team for second base after the 
season concluded.[14] The Cardinals promoted Wong to the Memphis Redbirds 
of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League in 2013, where he spent most of the 
year. Putting together a 20-game hitting streak in May, Wong collected 
30 hits in 70 at bats (AB). He also had 10 multi-hit games during that 
streak.[15] His totals at Memphis included a .303 batting average with 
10 home runs, 45 RBIs, and 20 stolen bases in 107 games, before the Cardinals 
called him up to the Major Leagues on August 16.[16] He participated in 
his second All-Star Futures Game in July.[17] He appeared in 32 MLB games, 
collecting nine hits in 59 AB with one double for a .153 batting average. 
In December, the Cardinals named him their Minor League Player of the Year 
for 2013.[15] Manager Mike Matheny named Wong to the 2013 Cardinals' postseason 
roster. He played in seven total games between the National League Division 
Series (NLDS), National League Championship Series (NLCS) and World Series. 
He made his World Series debut in Game 3 against the Boston Red Sox as 
a defensive substitution and collected a hit in the bottom of the eighth 
inning in his only Series plate appearance.[18] Wong also appeared in Game 
4 when Matheny inserted him as a pinch runner in the ninth inning. However, 
Boston closer Koji Uehara picked him off first base for the final out of 
the game, the only occasion in which a World Series game ended on a pickoff 
play.[a] Boston won the game, 4–2, and went on to win the Series, 4–2.[19][20] 
Wong became the de facto starter out of spring training for 2014. The Cardinals 
had traded third baseman David Freese and second baseman Matt Carpenter 
moved to third base.[21] The Cardinals signed veteran free agent Mark Ellis 
to provide insurance and guidance for him. Wong struggled early, batting 
.225 in April, and was demoted to Memphis.[22] He returned to the MLB club 
in May after hitting .344 with two homers, five steals, and an .867 on-base 
plus slugging (OPS) in 15 games, and also developed a modified swing.[23] 
Batting .333 with the Cardinals in May, Wong recorded the highest average 
for rookies with a minimum of 40 plate appearances. He also made no defensive 
errors.[24] Wong's plus-7 defensive runs saved led NL second basemen despite 
spending time in the minor leagues.[25] He was therefore named the National 
League Rookie of the Month.[24] On June 3, he hit his first career MLB 
home run, a grand slam against the Royals ace James Shields.[26] But when 
he reaggravated a shoulder injury sustained earlier in the month, the Cardinals 
placed Wong on the 15-day disabled list (DL) on June 21.[27] After returning 
from the DL, Wong hit a double to tie the score 2–2 in the second inning 
of a July 8 contest against the Pittsburgh Pirates. With the score tied 
4–4 in the bottom of the ninth of that game, he hit his first walk-off 
home run off Ernesto Frieri.[28] In a seven-game span beginning with a 
return from that DL stint and ending with the beginning of the All-Star 
break, he hit five home runs.[29] After enduring three games with three 
strikeouts each in a previous eight-game period, Wong finished a triple 
short of the cycle in an August 2 game against division rival Milwaukee 
Brewers.[30] His first career multi-home run game came five days later 
in a 3-for-4 performance with two home runs against the Red Sox.[31] Against 
the Baltimore Orioles on August 10, he notched his second career four-hit 
game in an 8–3 victory.[32] He batted .254 after being recalled from Memphis, 
including a .315 average against left-handed pitching.[22] Wong started 
100 games at second base, finishing with a .249 batting average, 12 home 
runs, 54 RBI, 42 runs scored and led the club with 20 stolen bases.[33] 
The Cardinals won the National League Central Division. In Game 3 of the 
NLDS versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, his seventh-inning, two-run homer 
broke a tie and provided the final margin in the Cardinals' 3–1 victory.[34] 
In Game 2 of the NLCS against the San Francisco Giants on October 12, Wong 
hit his second career MLB walk-off home run, a solo shot that secured a 
1-1 tie in the series for the Cardinals. This was the fourth postseason 
walk-off home run in franchise history, following Ozzie Smith (1985 NLCS), 
Jim Edmonds (2004 NLCS), and Freese (2011 World Series). In MLB postseason 
history, Wong became the third second baseman to accomplish the walk-off 
feat, after Bill Mazeroski (1960 World Series) and Jeff Kent (2004 NLCS).[35] 
For the 2014 postseason, Wong appeared in eight games, hitting three home 
runs and three doubles.[36] He finished third in the National League Rookie 
of the Year Award voting.[37] Wong contributed to the Cardinals' early 
success in 2015. On April 22 against the Washington Nationals, he had three 
hits – including a home run – and fielded would-be base hits from Yunel 
Escobar and Wilson Ramos (fifth and sixth innings) on the third base side 
of second, and turned and threw both out.[38] He hit his second career 
regular-season walk-off home run against Pittsburgh on May 3 in the 14th 
inning for a 3–2 decision.[39] During an eight-game hitting streak through 
May 10, he batted .517 (15-for-29) with two home runs.[40] For the season, 
he batted .262 with 28 doubles, four triples, 11 home runs, and 71 runs 
scored.[41] On March 2, 2016, Wong agreed to a five-year extension with 
the Cardinals worth $25.5 million, with $12.5 million team option for 2021.[42] 
He struggled early, batting .222 with a .571 OPS through June 5, and the 
Cardinals demoted him to Memphis the next day.[43] With Memphis, Wong began 
to gain experience as a center fielder.[44] In his debut with Memphis, 
he hit two home runs, including a grand slam, in an 8−5 win over Colorado 
Springs.[45] The Cardinals recalled Wong on June 17.[46] His ninth-inning, 
RBI double in the July 27 game against the New York Mets drove in the game-winning 
run for a 5−4 final score, where Jeurys Familia’s consecutive-saves streak 
had ended one batter earlier to Yadier Molina at 52, the third-longest 
in major league history.[47] Wong finished 2016 with a .240 batting average, 
5 home runs, 23 RBI's, and a .682 OPS.[48] Wong's brother, Kean, is a prospect 
in the Tampa Bay Rays organization and is also a second baseman. They have 
a sister, Kiani, who is a softball player at Hawaii. He is married to Alissa 
Noll, a former track and field athlete at Hawaii.[21] On December 19, 2013, 
Kolten's mother, Keala Wong, died from cancer.[51] a Although the 1926 
World Series between the Cardinals and the New York Yankees ended on the 
base path, it was on a stolen base attempt by Babe Ruth, not a pickoff.
