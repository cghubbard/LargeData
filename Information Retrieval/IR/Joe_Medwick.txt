Joseph Michael Medwick (November 24, 1911 – March 21, 1975), nicknamed 
"Ducky", was an American Major League Baseball player. A left fielder for 
the St. Louis Cardinals during the "Gashouse Gang" era of the 1930s, he 
also played for the Brooklyn Dodgers (1940–1943, 1946), New York Giants 
(1943–1945), and Boston Braves (1945). In 1937, Medwick won the National 
League Triple Crown. Medwick was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America in 1968, receiving 84.81% 
of the votes. In 2014 he became a member of the inaugural class of the 
St. Louis Cardinal Hall of Fame. The son of Hungarian immigrants, Medwick 
was born and raised in Carteret, New Jersey. He excelled in baseball, basketball, 
football and track at Carteret High School.[1] University of Notre Dame 
football coach Knute Rockne made arrangements for Medwick to play football 
there, but Medwick decided to forgo college and enter professional baseball.[2] 
Medwick entered professional baseball with the Scottdale Scotties of the 
Middle Atlantic League in 1930. In 75 games with the Scotties, he had a 
.419 batting average and 22 home runs. He spent most of the next two seasons 
with the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League. He played 161 games for 
Houston in 1931, hitting .305 with 19 home runs. He played in 139 games 
for the team the next year, hitting .354 with 26 home runs before being 
called up to the major leagues.[3] He made his debut with the Cardinals 
in 1932. By 1934, he hit .319 with 18 home runs and 106 runs batted in 
(RBI). Though Medwick swung at any pitch near the strike zone, he was difficult 
to strike out. He became known as one of baseball's rising stars, but it 
was also noted that Medwick had a self-centered nature.[4] Medwick's hard-charging 
style of play got him pulled out of the seventh game of the 1934 World 
Series by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. This occurred when Detroit 
Tigers fans started pelting him with garbage after he slid hard into third 
base on a triple. Landis also ordered Tigers third baseman Marv Owen, into 
whom Medwick had slid, benched. Medwick remains the only known player to 
be thrown out of a game for his own personal safety. When asked about the 
incident by reporters after the game, a perplexed Medwick said, "Well, 
I knew why [the Tiger fans] threw that garbage at me. What I don't understand 
is why they brought it to the park in the first place." Medwick won the 
National League Triple Crown and the NL Most Valuable Player in 1937, remaining 
the last NL player to win a Triple Crown. In one of the Triple Crown categories, 
home runs, Medwick finished the season tied with Mel Ott. On June 6 of 
that season, Medwick hit a home run that was later wiped out due to a forfeit, 
costing him the outright home run title.[5] Medwick's 64 doubles in 1936 
remains the National League record. He also holds the major league record 
for consecutive seasons with 40 or more doubles, set from 1933 through 
1939. In 1940, the Cardinals traded Medwick and Curt Davis to the Dodgers 
for $125,000 and four lesser-known players. While still a solid hitter, 
Medwick never excelled defensively and the Cardinals felt that he was losing 
some of the skills he displayed in the 1937 Triple Crown season.[6] Six 
days after the trade, Medwick was nearly killed by a beanball thrown at 
him by former Cardinal teammate Bob Bowman.[7] Bowman blamed the incident 
on sign stealing by Dodgers coach Chuck Dressen. He said that Dressen would 
whistle each time he saw the sign for a curveball. Hearing the whistle, 
Medwick stepped toward what he thought was a curveball, but Bowman had 
decided to throw a high, inside fastball to confuse them instead. When 
Medwick strode forward, the ball hit him in the temple and he was rendered 
unconscious.[8] Medwick helped lead the Dodgers to a pennant in 1941, but 
he had lost much of his dominance. He was traded to the New York Giants 
in 1943.[9] During a USO tour by a number of players in 1944, Medwick was 
among several individuals given an audience by Pope Pius XII, who had been 
Cardinal Secretary of State before his elevation to the papacy. Upon being 
asked by the Pope what his vocation was, Medwick replied, "Your Holiness, 
I'm Joe Medwick. I, too, used to be a Cardinal." Late in his career, Medwick 
said that golf was helping him to stay in good physical condition; thirty-six 
holes per day allowed him to walk more than ten miles "without heavy strain".[9] 
In 1946, he was signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Browns. However, 
after attending 1946 spring training with the Browns, he was not able to 
secure a spot on the regular-season roster and was seemingly out of baseball 
at age 34. He eventually returned to St. Louis to finish his career with 
the Cardinals in 1947 and 1948. In 1949 at the age of 37 Medwick was player-coach 
of the Miami Beach Flamingos, a Class 'B' team in the Florida International 
League. He had 375 at-bats in 106 games, with 121 hits for a .323 batting 
average. He continued playing minor-league baseball through 1952 with Class 
'B' Raleigh and Tampa, but his numbers declined substantially. Medwick 
retired with ten appearances in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game 
over seventeen seasons. He finished with a lifetime .324 batting average. 
In later years Medwick worked as a hitting coach in the Cardinals spring 
training camps and minor league system, his role with the team at the time 
of his death. Medwick had fallen short of the required Hall of Fame vote 
threshold on numerous ballots. In fact, he received no votes for the first 
seven years after his retirement, which is sometimes attributed to his 
strained relationship with teammates and the press. Medwick was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1968. After his election, Medwick said, 
"This was the longest slump of my career. I had gone 0 for 20 before, but 
never 0 for 20 years."[10] Medwick died in 1975 of a heart attack in St. 
Petersburg, Florida.[11] He was buried at St. Lucas Cemetery in Sunset 
Hills, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Medwick was one of three players 
born in New Jersey to be elected to the Hall of Fame, and one of five to 
have attended school in the state—in each case, the only one from the central 
part of the state. At number 79, he was the highest-ranking New Jersey 
native to have made The Sporting News' list of Baseball's Greatest Players 
in 1999.[12] That same year, he was nominated as a finalist for the Major 
League Baseball All-Century Team. He was elected New Jersey athlete of 
the century at century's end. In January 2014, the Cardinals announced 
Medwick among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. 
Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[13]
