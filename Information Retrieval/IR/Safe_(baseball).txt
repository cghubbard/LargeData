In baseball, a baserunner is safe when he reaches a base without being 
put out by various ways. While a runner is touching a base, he is usually 
not in jeopardy of being put out, and is thus "safe" from fielders' actions. 
The runner is in jeopardy once again, negating this safety, when he ceases 
touching the base, when forced on a force play, or when the runner commits 
interference. By the rules, a runner is safe when he is entitled to the 
base he is trying for. Umpires will signal that a runner is safe by extending 
their elbows to their sides and then extending their arms fully to the 
side. For emphasis, an umpire may fully cross and extend his arms several 
times to indicate safe. Verbally, the umpire will usually simply say "safe". 
If a close play occurs that may have appeared to be a putout, the umpire 
will also call a reason for the safe call, such as "he dropped the ball"
