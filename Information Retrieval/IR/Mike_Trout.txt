Michael Nelson Trout (born August 7, 1991), nicknamed The Millville Meteor, 
is an American professional baseball center fielder for the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim of Major League Baseball (MLB). Trout was the American 
League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2014 (finished second in 2012, 
2013 and 2015), is a five-time All-Star, and a two-time All-Star Game MVP 
since becoming a regular player in 2012. Trout was a first-round pick by 
the Angels in the 2009 MLB draft and made a brief major league appearance 
in 2011 as a teenager. He became a regular player for the Angels the subsequent 
season and won the 2012 AL Rookie of the Year Award unanimously. He is 
under contract with the Angels through 2020. Trout's MLB performances have 
received praise from both the mainstream media and sabermetricians, and 
he is regarded as one of the most outstanding young players in the history 
of baseball, as well as one of the best current players in all of MLB.[1][2][3][4] 
Trout has led the major leagues in wins above replacement (WAR) in four 
of his five full seasons (according to Fangraphs and Baseball-Reference.com). 
Born in Vineland, New Jersey, to Jeff and Debbie Trout, he has two older 
siblings, sister Teal and brother Tyler. His father, Jeff (born January 
7, 1961), played baseball at the University of Delaware [5][6] and was 
a fifth-round draft pick as a second baseman by the Minnesota Twins in 
1983.[7] Jeff played four years of minor league baseball before a torn 
plantar fascia and knee injuries ended his career.[8] Trout began playing 
baseball in Little League.[8] His main position as a little leaguer was 
the shortstop position. He wore #2 in honor of his childhood hero, New 
York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter. He would switch to #1 in high school.[9] 
Mike attended Lakeside Middle School and is a 2009 graduate of Millville 
Senior High School.[10] Trout attended Millville Senior High School in 
Millville, New Jersey where he played both baseball and basketball,[11] 
earning five letters (three in baseball and two in basketball).[6] In his 
junior year, he threw a no-hitter against Egg Harbor Township High School. 
The Thunderbolts made it to the state playoffs and were defeated by Cherry 
Hill High School East.[9] He started as a pitcher and shortstop, and was 
shifted to the outfield during his senior year.[12] That year, he hit 18 
home runs, a New Jersey high school record.[13] Trout had committed to 
play baseball at East Carolina University prior to the 2009 MLB Draft.[6] 
Millville initially planned to retire Trout's jersey number, but instead 
began awarding it to the team captain, starting in 2012.[14] Trout played 
travel ball with Tri-State Arsenal, one of the premier travel programs 
in the Northeast. He began working with the coaches at Arsenal at age 14.[15] 
Trout played in various tournaments with Tri-State Arsenal, including the 
Perfect Game WWBA Championships in Jupiter, Florida in 2007 and 2008.[16] 
In the summer before his senior year, Trout attended the Area Code Games 
in southern California, where he went 6-for-11 against some of the best 
players in the country.[17] Angels scout Greg Morhardt, who had played 
in the minor leagues with Trout's father, claimed Mike was the fastest 
and strongest 17-year-old he had ever seen.[7] Trout was drafted by the 
Angels, using their compensation pick from the New York Yankees for their 
signing of Mark Teixeira, 25th overall in the 2009 MLB draft.[18] He started 
his professional career in 2009 playing for the Arizona Angels of the rookie-level 
Arizona League, hitting .360 with a .418 OBP and .506 SLG with one home 
run, 25 runs batted in (RBIs), and 13 stolen bases in 187 plate appearances 
over 39 games. He was beaten out in being named AZL Most Valuable Player 
by Cody Decker.[19][20] He finished the season playing for the Cedar Rapids 
Kernels of the Class A Midwest League, hitting .267 over 20 plate appearances 
in five games.[citation needed] Before the 2010 season, Trout was considered 
the Angels' third-best prospect and the 85th-best in all of baseball by 
Baseball America.[21][22] He started the season playing for Cedar Rapids, 
where he hit .362 with a .454 on-base percentage (OBP) and a .526 slugging 
percentage (SLG) with six home runs, 39 RBIs, and 45 stolen bases in 82 
games. He was selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game.[13] In July, 
Baseball America named Trout the second-best overall baseball prospect.[23] 
After the Futures game, he was promoted to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes 
of the Class A-Advanced California League.[24] After the 2010 season, Trout 
was named 2010 J.G. Taylor Spink Award as the Topps Minor League Player 
of the Year. At just 19 years and two months, he was the youngest player 
to win this award.[25] He was also named a Baseball America All-Star as 
well as a Topps Class A All-Star.[26] Prior to the 2011 season, Trout was 
ranked number one by ESPN's Keith Law in his 2011 top 100 prospects list[27] 
and by MLB's Jonathan Mayo.[28] Trout started the 2011 season with the 
Arkansas Travelers of the Class AA Texas League. He hit .324 with nine 
home runs, 27 RBIs and 28 stolen bases in his first 75 games.[29] The Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim promoted Trout on July 8, 2011, to replace the 
injured Peter Bourjos in center field. He made his major league debut that 
night, going 0-for-3.[29] In his next game, Trout recorded his first career 
major league hit, an infield single against Seattle Mariners pitcher Michael 
Pineda in the bottom of the third inning.[30] He hit his first major league 
home run against Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mark Worrell on July 24.[31] 
Trout was sent back to Double-A Arkansas on August 1, 2011 after hitting 
.163 with one home run and six runs batted in 12 starts for the Angels.[32] 
After spending time back in Double-A Arkansas, Trout was recalled by the 
Angels on August 19, 2011. That night, he went 1-for-4 with a home run, 
his first at Angel Stadium.[33] On August 30, Trout became the youngest 
Angel to hit two home runs in one game, homering off of Mariners pitcher 
Anthony Vazquez in the top of the second inning and again in the top of 
the fourth inning.[34][35] In his 40-game rookie big league stint in 2011, 
Trout's batting average was .220, while his on-base percentage was .281 
and his slugging percentage .390.[36] For the 2011 season, of the 13 votes 
cast for the USA Today Minor League Player of the Year Award, Trout received 
the 2 votes allocated to the fan poll.[37] He was named Baseball America 
Minor League Player of the Year[38][39] after hitting .326/.414/.544 with 
11 home runs, 38 RBIs, 82 runs scored and 33 stolen bases in 91 games. 
He was again named an outfielder on Baseball America's 2011 Minor League 
All Star team.[40] Trout began the 2012 season with the Salt Lake Bees 
of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. On April 28, he was again brought 
up from the minors, this time to replace Bobby Abreu (who was batting .208 
in 24 at-bats). At that time, Trout had a .403 batting average, a .467 
on-base percentage, and a .623 slugging percentage in 20 games with Salt 
Lake.[41] Trout recorded his first career four-hit game on June 4, and 
15 days later Trout had his second career four-hit game. In the process, 
he scored all four times and two of his four hits went for doubles. Trout, 
along with Angels right fielder Torii Hunter, was named American League 
co-Player of the Week from June 4â€“10. During that stretch, Trout went 13-for-25 
for a .520 batting average to go along with 10 runs scored and four stolen 
bases.[42] On June 27 against the Baltimore Orioles, Trout had his third 
career 4-hit game in the same month. In the same game, he showed off his 
defensive skills when he robbed Orioles shortstop J. J. Hardy of a home 
run as he leaped up in the center field wall to make a spectacular catch 
in the bottom of the first inning.[43] Trout broke both an Angels' franchise 
and American League rookie record when he crossed home plate in 14 consecutive 
games after scoring a run in a game on July 22.[44] Trout's 26 stolen bases 
tied Jerry Remy for the team's rookie record for most stolen bases by the 
All-Star Break.[45] Playing in his first All-Star Game, Trout singled off 
of New York Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey in the bottom of the 6th inning and 
drew a base on balls against Cincinnati Reds pitcher Aroldis Chapman in 
the bottom of the 7th.[46] In the month of June, Trout batted .372 with 
three home runs and 16 RBI and was named AL Player of the Month and AL 
Rookie of the Month. Angels manager Mike Scioscia explained Trout's impact 
by saying, "It's a pleasant surprise only with the fact that you see very 
few guys come up and do this much. Is it surprising that Mike Trout's talent 
is able to produce what's happening on the field? No, that's not a surprise. 
He's an extraordinary talent."[47] Trout's 34 runs scored in July tied 
the Major League rookie record with Cleveland Indians first baseman Hal 
Trosky in 1934. He had a .392 batting average, 10 home runs, and 23 runs 
batted in. In addition, Trout continued to show his speed by stealing nine 
bases and scoring 32 runs in July.[48] Trout also became the first rookie 
to drive in at least 55 runs and score 80 runs in 81 games since Joe DiMaggio 
in 1936."[49] Against the White Sox on August 4, Trout made another highlight 
catch, robbing second baseman Gordon Beckham of a home run in the second 
inning. White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski told reporters after the game 
that Trout "makes those catches in the outfield look so good.".[50] On 
August 21, Trout went 2-for-4 in a victory over the Red Sox, raising his 
batting average to .344.[51] With the .344 average, Trout set the rookie 
record for batting average through 100 games.[49] Trout finished the month 
of August with a .284 batting average, seven home runs, 19 runs batted 
in, 11 stolen bases, and an .866 OPS. Trout was again named AL Rookie of 
the Month for August, his fourth time winning the honor. In winning the 
award for the fourth time, Trout became the first American League rookie 
since Ichiro Suzuki in 2001 to win Rookie of the Month four times during 
a single season.[52] Trout became the youngest player ever to hit at least 
20 home runs and steal at least 40 bases in a season. Houston Astros center 
fielder CÃ©sar CedeÃ±o had been the youngest player to accomplish the feat, 
doing so in 1972.[53] He also became the youngest hitter ever to hit at 
least 20 home runs and steal at least 30 bases in a season.[54] Trout scored 
his 100th run of the season on August 26, becoming the second Angels rookie 
to score at least 100 runs in a season after Devon White.[55] Trout set 
a new Angels record for runs scored in a rookie season, passing White. 
Trout scored three runs that day, the tenth time in the 2012 season where 
he scored three or more runs in one game, the most since Sammy Sosa's 11 
games in 2001.[56] On September 9, in a game against the Detroit Tigers, 
Trout became the first player in baseball history under the age of 22 to 
hit a leadoff home run in back-to-back games.[57] On September 21, Trout 
became the first rookie to score 120 or more runs since Ichiro Suzuki and 
the fourth rookie to accomplish that feat since 1964.[58] On September 
30, Trout became the youngest player in Major League Baseball history to 
join the 30â€“30 club when he belted a 7th-inning home run off of Texas Rangers 
pitcher Yu Darvish, helping the Angels win the game by a score of 5â€“4.[59] 
Trout became the first player in MLB history to hit 30 home runs, steal 
45 bases and score 125 runs in one season.[60] Trout set the Angels' club 
record for most runs scored in a season, surpassing Vladimir Guerrero. 
He also set the Angels rookie record for most hits in a season with 173, 
passing Wally Joyner.[61] Trout became the first rookie ever to hit 30 
home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season. In addition, Trout finished 
second in the AL in batting average (.326), third in slugging percentage 
(.564), third in on-base percentage (.399), second in OPS (.963), 9th in 
hits (182), and first in OPS+ (171).[62] He became the first Angels player 
to lead the league in stolen bases since Chone Figgins did so in 2005 with 
49 stolen bases.[63] According to Baseball-Reference.com, Trout finished 
with a wins above replacement (WAR) value of 10.9, 2.4 better than second-place 
finisher Robinson CanÃ³ of the Yankees.[64] Trout was the first position 
player to have a WAR above 10.0 since Barry Bonds for the San Francisco 
Giants in 2004.[65] Trout led the Angels in batting average, runs scored, 
hits (182), triples, stolen bases, total bases (315), base on balls, batting 
average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and on-base plus slugging 
despite playing in just 139 games. He was tied with Pujols for second place 
on the team in home runs behind Mark Trumbo and was fourth in runs batted 
in.[66] On November 12, 2012 Trout won the BBWAA Jackie Robinson Rookie 
of the Year Award, receiving 28 of 28 first place votes, becoming the first 
Angels player to win the award since Tim Salmon won it in 1993 and the 
youngest player to win the AL Rookie of the Year Award. Trout became just 
the 18th Rookie of the Year winner to win the award unanimously.[67] On 
November 13, Trout won the Heart and Hustle Award, given to the player 
who "demonstrates a passion for the game of baseball and best embodies 
the values, spirit and traditions of the game."[68][69] Trout was one of 
three outfielders in the American League to win the Silver Slugger for 
being the best offensive players at their position; the others were then-Ranger 
Josh Hamilton and Josh Willingham of the Minnesota Twins.[70] He also won 
a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding center fielder in MLB.[71] 
Trout's high WAR value led many to support his candidacy for American League 
Most Valuable Player.[72][73][74][75] Trout's main competition for the 
award was Miguel Cabrera, who became the first player since Carl Yastrzemski 
in 1967 to win the triple crown by leading the AL in batting average, home 
runs, and runs batted in.[74] The race between Trout and Cabrera created 
controversy amongst baseball fans and writers, and was described by many 
as a clash between new-age sabermetrics and supporters of more "traditional" 
statistics.[76] In supporting Trout's case, Jayson Stark wrote, "We just 
understand that Trout's insane 10.5 WAR are one more clear indication that 
he's a better baseball player than even one of the greatest hitters of 
our lifetimes. ... If you want to toss in his slash line, his 62 extra-base 
hits, his 92.3 percent stolen-base success rate or any other item on his 
stat sheet, you'll find that no player in the history of baseball has combined 
this much excellence in so many areas in the same season."[75] Meanwhile, 
Scott Miller of CBS Sports wrote, "Nobody combined overall statistics, 
badass lineup presence and value to his team more than Triple Crown winner 
Miguel Cabrera."[77] On November 15, Cabrera won the MVP decisively, winning 
twenty-two of twenty-eight first place votes to Trout's six.[78] Trout 
began the 2013 season as a left fielder, in order to accommodate for Peter 
Bourjos in center field.[79] Trout started the 2013 season slowly, hitting 
.261 with 2 home runs and 16 RBIs in April.[80] During a game on April 
20 against the Detroit Tigers, Trout hit his first career grand slam off 
pitcher Rick Porcello, capping a 10-run inning for the Angels, their highest-scoring 
inning in almost 18 years.[81] On April 30, Bourjos injured his hamstring, 
and Trout was moved back to center field.[82] In May, Trout regained his 
rookie-year form, batting .327 with 8 home runs, 21 RBIs, and 27 runs scored.[80] 
Trout stated that he had struggled early in the season because he was chasing 
pitches out of the strike zone and pressing too much on himself.[83] On 
May 21, 2013 Trout became the youngest player to hit for the cycle in American 
League history and sixth youngest in Major League history, doing so at 
home against the Seattle Mariners.[84] On May 30, Angels manager Mike Scioscia 
announced that Trout would return to left field after Bourjos returned 
from the disabled list. This decision caused some controversy, as some 
believed that Trout's successful May was a direct result of his move back 
to center field.[79] Scioscia, however, believed that Trout's numbers as 
a center fielder had to do with his batting-order position and hype subsiding.[85] 
On June 8, with shortstop Erick Aybar struggling at the leadoff spot, Trout 
began batting leadoff, marking his first time hitting in the leadoff spot 
since April 14.[86] In his first game batting leadoff since mid-April, 
Trout went 3 for 5, with two doubles, a run batted in, scored two runs, 
had a base on balls, and stole a base, helping the Angels win the game 
over the Boston Red Sox in the first game of a double-header.[87] Trout 
indeed moved back to left field after Bourjos returned to the Angels' lineup 
on June 10.[88] In his 249th career game, he scored his 200th career run, 
becoming the fastest player to accomplish this since Ted Williams (225 
games) and Barney McCosky (236 games) did it in 1940.[89] Trout represented 
the Angels in the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was the 
leading vote-getter among all AL outfielders and the first Angels position 
player to start in the All-Star Game since Vladimir Guerrero in 2007.[90] 
In the month of July, Trout led all of baseball with an on-base percentage 
of .475 and OPS of 1.108.[80] In addition, he was the only player in the 
American League to reach base in every game of the month and became the 
first Angels player to have two consecutive streaks of reaching base in 
at least 33 games.[91] Trout continued his strong play in August, batting 
.337 with 6 home runs and an on-base percentage of .500.[80] As in 2012, 
Trout's play declined somewhat in September, as he batted .281 with 4 home 
runs and 4 stolen bases.[80] According to Baseball-Reference, Trout finished 
the 2013 season with 9.2 WAR, again the highest in baseball.[92] Notably, 
Trout's walk rate increased from 10.5% in 2012 to 15.4% in 2013.[80] Trout's 
110 bases on balls led the American League.[92] Echoing the 2012 season, 
Miguel Cabrera won the 2013 AL MVP with twenty-three first-place votes, 
while Trout finished second with five.[93] Rumors of a contract extension 
surfaced in February 2014, as news outlets reported that the Angels were 
considering offering Trout a six-year $150 million contract. Instead, he 
signed a one-year, $1 million contract. That figure is the highest ever 
for a player not yet eligible for salary arbitration.[94] On March 28, 
2014, the Angels announced they had signed Trout to a 6-year, $144.5 million 
extension.[95] On April 19, 2014 Trout went 0-4 with four consecutive strikeouts 
against Max Scherzer, giving him his first golden sombrero after playing 
in 353 games.[96] On May 15, Trout hit his first career walk-off home run 
in a 6-5 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.[97] On July 15, Trout appeared 
in his third All-Star Game at Target Field in Minnesota. He went 2 for 
3, with a double, a triple, and two RBIs. He was named the Most Valuable 
Player of the game, making him the second-youngest All-Star Game MVP behind 
Ken Griffey Jr. in 1992.[98][99] On June 27, Trout hit the longest home 
run of the 2014 season, according to ESPN.com's Home Run Tracker.[100] 
The ball was hit 489 feet into left-center field at Kaufmann Stadium, Kansas 
City, Missouri.[101] Playing in 157 games in 2014, Trout batted .287 with 
36 home runs, 39 doubles, nine triples, an AL-leading 111 RBIs, 16 stolen 
bases and an MLB-leading 115 runs scored. He also struck out a league-high 
184 times. In an interview with Ken Rosenthal, Trout attributed his increased 
strikeouts to a "golf-swing." Nevertheless, Trout added he is working with 
staff to fix correct the strikeout tendency, and what may have been the 
only significant flaw of his all-around game.[citation needed] In Game 
3 of the 2014 American League Division Series against the Kansas City Royals, 
Trout hit his first career postseason home run but later in the ninth inning, 
he was the final batter of the Angels to strike out as the team lost to 
the Royals in a three-game sweep of the series.[citation needed] On November 
13, 2014, Major League Baseball announced that Trout was unanimously selected 
as the AL MVP, becoming the sixth player in MLB history to win both the 
regular season MVP and the All-Star Game MVP in the same season. Further, 
at the time, he was the fifth-youngest MVP ever, the 17th to win unanimously, 
and the fifth in Angels' franchise history, following Vladimir Guerrero 
in 2004.[102] On April 17, 2015, Trout became the youngest player in MLB 
history to reach 100 home runs and 100 stolen bases.[103] He was 23 years 
and 253 days old when he reached the milestone, passing the previous record-holder, 
Alex Rodriguez, who had achieved it at the age of 23 years and 309 days 
in 1999.[103] Trout led off the 2015 MLB All-Star Game with a home run, 
becoming the fourth player in All-Star Game history to do so.[104] For 
the second year in a row, Trout won the All-Star Game MVP Award, becoming 
the first player ever to win it in consecutive years.[105] On September 
22, Trout hit his 40th home run, becoming only the second Angels player 
to hit 40 home runs in a season.[106] Trout led the AL in WAR for the fourth 
straight year.[107] Trout finished the season with 41 homers and 90 RBIs. 
He also led all American League players in slugging percentage, and OPS 
with a slashline of .299/.402/.590/.991. For his offensive performance, 
Trout would go on to win his fourth Silver Slugger Award in as many seasons. 
In doing so, he became only the second player since Mike Piazza to win 
four straight Silver Slugger Awards to start off a career.[108] He also 
won the Best Major League Baseball Player ESPY Award.[109] On November 
10, it was announced that Trout, along with Royals outfielder Lorenzo Cain 
and Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson, were finalists for the AL MVP. 
Trout became the first player since Barry Bonds to be among the top three 
in MVP voting in four straight seasons. On November 19, Trout finished 
second to MVP winner Josh Donaldson, making it the third time he would 
finish second in MVP voting in his four big league seasons.[110] In June 
2016, Sporting News named Trout "baseball's best player" for the season.[111] 
According to Fangraphs, he had accumulated more WAR through his age-24 
season (on August 12, 2016) than any other player since 1913, with 45. 
Mickey Mantle was second with 41.1, followed by Mel Ott, Jimmie Foxx, and 
Ted Williams. A close contemporary of Trout's, Alex Rodriguez, was seventh.[112] 
In 159 games of 2016, Trout led the MLB with walks (116), runs scored (123), 
and on-base percentage (.441). He also had a .315 batting average, 29 home 
runs, 30 stolen bases, and 100 RBI. Notes: Through 2015 season. Per Baseball-Reference.com. 
Trout's combination of power and speed has drawn comparisons to Hall of 
Fame center fielder Mickey Mantle.[113] Trout has hit at least 27 home 
runs and 35 other extra base hits per season between 2012 and 2015, while 
also maintaining a high batting average and walk rate. He is particularly 
able to hit pitches that are low in the strike zone.[114][115] Trout's 
speed has allowed him to be an above average defender in center field (according 
to ultimate zone rating) and he is also a proficient baserunner, stealing 
113 bases between 2012 and 2015 at a success rate of 84 percent.[116][117] 
In the four-year period since Trout became a regular player, he has been 
MLB's most productive batter, according to Fangraphs. Trout led all MLB 
players in total runs above average (park-adjusted wRAA) with 221.5 runs, 
and led all qualified players in productivity per plate appearance (wRC+), 
producing runs at a rate 71 percent above league average.[118] Trout's 
exceptional performance at his young age has caused him to be compared 
to Ted Williams.[119] Trout's nicknames include "Prince Fish", "God's Gift" 
and "King Fish 2.0", in reference to retired Angel Tim Salmon.[120] He 
adopted the nickname "Millville Meteor" only after a prankster edited his 
Wikipedia article[121] and the name caught on.[62][122][123] In February 
2014, President Barack Obama used Trout as an analogy for the 2014 U.S. 
Farm Bill. To emphasize the versatility and utility of the bill, Obama 
remarked that it was "like Mike Trout, for those of you who know baseball...somebody 
who's got a lot of tools."[124] "Who is Mike Trout?" was an answer on a 
February 2013 episode of the quiz show Jeopardy! during the show's teen 
tournament.[125] In September 2012, Trout became a partner and investor 
in Bodyarmor SuperDrink, a sports drink.[126] Trout signed a sponsorship 
agreement with Subway in early 2013, first appearing in a commercial during 
Super Bowl XLVII.[127] Trout is also a sponsor for SuperPretzel.[128] In 
2014, Mike Trout made history when he became the first Major League Baseball 
player since Ken Griffey Jr. to have his own signature pair of Nike shoes.[129][130]
