James David Bristol (born June 23, 1933) is an American former manager 
in Major League Baseball in the 1960s and 1970s. He managed the Cincinnati 
Reds, Milwaukee Brewers, Atlanta Braves, and San Francisco Giants during 
this period. Bristol attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill and Western Carolina University. A right-handed hitting and throwing 
infielder, he never played in the Major Leagues. Bristol became a playing 
manager in the Cincinnati farm system at the age of 24 with the Hornell 
Redlegs of the Class D New York–Penn League in 1957. By 1964, he was managing 
the Reds' top farm team, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, 
where, at age 31, he won a pennant and playoff title—the fifth league championship 
of his eight-year career to date. In nine seasons (1957–65) as a minor 
league pilot, his teams won 652 games and lost 562 (.537). In 1966, Bristol 
was named to the Reds' coaching staff, and when the team performed badly 
under rookie skipper Don Heffner, Bristol took over the club as manager 
on July 13. At 33, he was the youngest pilot in the Major Leagues that 
season through 1969. Bristol guided the Reds through 3 1⁄2 winning seasons, 
but he was dismissed following the 1969 campaign. Sparky Anderson, who 
took over from Bristol, would go into the Baseball Hall of Fame as the 
leader of the "Big Red Machine". Cincinnati (298–265, .529) represented 
the highwater mark of Bristol's managing career. He would never manage 
another winning club. Not long after being fired by the Reds, Bristol was 
hired by the Seattle Pilots as the second manager in their history. He 
walked into a very difficult situation; the Pilots were on the verge of 
bankruptcy, and went to spring training not knowing whether they would 
play in Seattle or Milwaukee in 1970. Just six days before Opening Day, 
the Pilots got word they would be moving to Milwaukee as the Brewers. However, 
the Brewers assumed the Pilots' place in the American League West Division, 
and were thus saddled with the longest road trips in the league. As a result, 
Bristol was never able to put together a winning team, and was fired 30 
games into the 1972 season. In 1976, Bristol was hired as manager of the 
Atlanta Braves. Midway through the 1977 season, with the Braves mired in 
a 16-game losing streak, owner Ted Turner sent Bristol on a 10-day "scouting 
trip" and took over as his own manager. This only lasted for one game (a 
2–1 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates) before National League president Chub 
Feeney ordered Turner to give up the reins, citing major league rules which 
forbid managers or players from owning stock in a team.[1] After the Braves 
broke the streak with third-base coach Vern Benson as interim manager, 
Bristol—who had returned to his offseason home in Andrews, North Carolina—was 
brought back to finish out what was at the time the worst season in the 
Atlanta portion of Braves history (61–101—including a 60–100 record by 
Bristol). He was fired at the end of the season.[2] He last managed in 
MLB with the Giants late in the 1979 season and all of 1980 before he was 
replaced by Frank Robinson, prior to the 1981 season. He finished with 
a career managerial record of 657 win and 764 defeats (.462). In addition 
to his rookie MLB season with Cincinnati, Bristol also served as the third-base 
coach of the Montreal Expos (1973–75) and Giants (1978–79), plus two terms 
with the Philadelphia Phillies (1982–85; 1988), and two additional stints
