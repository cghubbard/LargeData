City Mayor Matthias Nicoll, became a patentee in the 1680s of the east 
end of what is now the town of Islip. He accumulated over 100 square miles 
(260 km2) and named his estate Islip, after the Nicolls' ancestral home 
in East Northamptonshire, England. His domain included what are now the 
hamlets of Islip, East Islip, Bayport, Sayville, West Sayville, Oakdale, 
Great River, Islip Terrace, Central Islip, Hauppauge, Holbrook, Bohemia, 
Brentwood, Holtsville, and a portion of Ronkonkoma. This land was purchased 
from Winnequaheagh, Sachem of Connetquot in 1683. The annual fee paid to 
Governor Thomas Dongan of New York was five bushels of good winter wheat 
or 25 shillings. The name "Islip" was chosen by local residents for their 
local post office when it opened in 1802. Islip was originally a farming 
community, gradually transforming into a posh enclave for wealthy families 
in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of the Colonial Revival, Greek Revival, 
Romanesque Revival, Federal, Moorish and Victorian mansions that once lined 
the streets of Islip have been razed, though some remain, adjacent to many 
newer, large homes. Islip has a wealth of extant Queen Anne Revival homes. 
Located along the picturesque Great South Bay, Islip has a long history 
associated with fishing, clamming (the world-famous Doxsee Clam Company 
started in Islip), swimming and boating. Islip Hamlet has its own public 
bathing beach, under the jurisdiction of the town. Boating and yachting 
are as popular today as they were years ago, if not more so, with the development 
of the communities on the adjacent barrier beach of Fire Island. Islip 
Hamlet is known widely for its quaint shopping district along Main Street 
(NY 27A). There are gift shops, hairdressers, boutiques, restaurants, pubs, 
natural food stores and many other types of establishments. Annual events 
include the Main Street Festival in the spring, Memorial Day Parade, a 
Sidewalk Sale, Trick or Treat on Main Street on Halloween, a Holiday House 
Tour, a Victorian High Tea, the Town Hall Christmas Tree Lighting and the 
Santa Comes to Town Parade. Bayberry Point lies adjacent to the Great South 
Bay. It is made up of three streets, separated by canals. Bayberry is Islip's 
most affluent area and home to some of its most expensive real estate. 
Bayberry Point was originally an experimental living cooperative financed 
by Horace Havemeyer, a son of sugar-refining magnate Henry O. Havemeyer, 
and designed by Grovsner Atterbury. It was "an experiment in co-operative 
living among the very rich." Building began at the end of the 19th century 
and was completed in 1916, with Havemeyer constructing several Moorish 
mansions along the banks of the canals, overlooking the bay. Many of these 
homes still exist today, though most have been extensively renovated. Parts 
of Islip are protected by the Islip Volunteer Fire Department. The main 
firehouse headquarters is located at 28 Monell Avenue. A firehouse sub-station 
is located on Commack Road. Additional areas of Islip are covered by the 
Islip Terrace Volunteer Fire Department located on Beaver Dam Road. Law 
enforcement is provided by the Suffolk County Police Department, as well 
as the Town of Islip Department of Public Safety. Islip is located approximately

a ZIP code of 11751. Islip is the mailing address for most residents of 
the hamlet, as well as for some residents of adjoining communities. The 
Islip Post Office opened under that name on September 7, 1802, but was 
closed just four months later. It reopened July 1, 1808, and has been in 
continuous operation under that name since then.[4] The Islip School District 
consists of five schools. The school district's mascot is the Buccaneer.
