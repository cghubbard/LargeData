As player As coach As manager Russell Aubrey "Lena" Blackburne (October 
23, 1886 – February 29, 1968) was an American baseball infielder, manager, 
coach, and scout in Major League Baseball (MLB). Between 1910 and 1929, 
Blackburne played for the Chicago White Sox (1910, 1912, 1914–1915, 1927, 
1929), Cincinnati Reds (1918), Boston Braves (1919) and Philadelphia Phillies 
(1919). He batted and threw right-handed. Following his playing career, 
Blackburne managed the White Sox (1928–29) and coached for the White Sox 
(1927–28), St. Louis Browns (1930) and Philadelphia Athletics (1933–38; 
1940–45; 1947–48).[1] Blackburne was a native of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, 
and moved to Palmyra, New Jersey with his family at a very young age. While 
living in Palmyra, as a youth, Blackburne played football for the Palmyra 
Field Club in 1906. Blackburne is best remembered for his eponymous rubbing 
mud, used by umpires on new baseballs to remove their slippery finish. 
Blackburne broke into the majors with the White Sox in 1910, appearing 
in part of five seasons, and split the 1919 season with the Braves and 
Phillies. In an eight-season playing career, Blackburne was a .214 hitter 
with four home runs and 139 runs batted in in 550 games played. As a fielder, 
he appeared in 539 games at shortstop (213), third base (180) and second 
(144) and first (2), and also relieved in one game. In 1933, he went on 
to become a coach with the Philadelphia Athletics of Connie Mack. Blackburne 
stayed with the Athletics as a scout when the club moved to Kansas City. 
As a manager in the major leagues, he posted a 99–133 record for a .427 
winning percentage. He managed the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International 
League for parts of three seasons: 1916, 1921, and 1932. In each case he 
was hired as a mid-season replacement. Blackburne died in Riverside Township, 
New Jersey at age 81, and is buried in Morgan Cemetery on the outskirts 
of Palmyra, not far from where he lived on Henry and Cinnaminson Avenues. 
Blackburne made an unusual and valuable contribution to baseball when he 
discovered a special use for the clay from the Delaware River to take the 
shine off of baseballs before each game. At the time, the mid-1930s, baseball 
teams used a variety of substances to rub baseballs: tobacco juice, shoe 
polish, dirt from the baseball field or a combination, but nothing they 
tried gave the balls the right look or feel. Blackburne searched for the 
perfect rubbing compound until one day, he found a mud that he liked close 
to home. The actual location has never been revealed, but rumor says it 
was from a tributary of the Delaware River, near Palmyra, New Jersey where 
he lived most of his life. He marketed his idea, and by 1938, he was supplying 
the mud to all American League teams; because Blackburne was a diehard 
American League fan, he refused to sell the mud to National League teams 
until the mid-1950s. Since then, every major and minor league team has 
used only his product. The mud is still collected today, from a new secret 
location. One container, a little more than 16 ounces, will usually last 
a season. The process of creating the mud was featured in a pilot episode 
of the television show Dirty Jobs on the Discovery Channel. The story of 
Blackburne's Rubbing Mud was also featured on History Channel's Modern 
Marvels "Dirt Education" and "Amazing Job Countdown" episodes. Blackburne's 
contribution to the game has earned him a mention in the Baseball Hall
