Bay Stater (official)[3] Massachusite (traditional)[4][5] Massachusetts 
i/ˌmæsəˈtʃuːsᵻts/ mass-ə-CHOO-sits; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern 
United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states 
of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont 
to the north, and New York to the west. The capital of Massachusetts and 
the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' 
population lives in the Greater Boston metro area, a region influential 
upon American history, academia, and industry.[41] Originally dependent 
on agriculture, fishing and trade,[42] Massachusetts was transformed into 
a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution.[43] During the 
20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services.[44] 
Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, 
higher education, finance, and maritime trade.[45] Plymouth was the site 
of the first colony in New England, founded in 1620 by the Pilgrims, passengers 
of the Mayflower. In 1692, the town of Salem and surrounding areas experienced 
one of America's most infamous cases of mass hysteria, the Salem witch 
trials.[46] In 1777, General Henry Knox founded the Springfield Armory, 
which during the Industrial Revolution catalyzed numerous important technological 
advances, including interchangeable parts.[47] In 1786, Shays' Rebellion, 
a populist revolt led by disaffected Revolutionary War veterans, influenced 
the United States Constitutional Convention.[48] In the 18th century, the 
Protestant First Great Awakening, which swept the Atlantic world, originated 
from the pulpit of Northampton preacher Jonathan Edwards.[49] In the late 
18th century, Boston became known as the "Cradle of Liberty"[50] for the 
agitation there that led to the American Revolution. The entire Commonwealth 
of Massachusetts has played a powerful commercial and cultural role in 
the history of the United States. Before the American Civil War, Massachusetts 
was a center for the abolitionist, temperance,[51] and transcendentalist[52] 
movements.[53] In the late 19th century, the sports of basketball and volleyball 
were invented in the western Massachusetts cities of Springfield and Holyoke, 
respectively.[54][55] In 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state 
to legally recognize same-sex marriage as a result of the decision of the 
state's Supreme Judicial Court.[56] Many prominent American political dynasties 
have hailed from the state, including the Adams and Kennedy families. Harvard 
University in Cambridge is the oldest institution of higher learning in 
the United States,[57] with the largest financial endowment of any university,[58] 
and whose Law School has spawned a contemporaneous majority of United States 
Supreme Court Justices.[59] Both Harvard University and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, also in Cambridge, have been ranked among the 
most highly regarded academic institutions in the world.[60] The Massachusetts 
Bay Colony was named after the indigenous population, the Massachusett, 
whose name can be segmented as mass-adchu-s-et, where mass- is "large", 
-adchu- is "hill", -s- is a diminutive suffix meaning "small", and -et 
is a locative suffix, identifying it as a place. It has been translated 
as "near the great hill",[61] "by the blue hills", "at the little big hill", 
or "at the range of hills", referring to the Blue Hills, or in particular 
the Great Blue Hill which is located on the boundary of Milton and Canton.[62][63] 
Alternatively, Massachusett has been represented as Moswetuset, from the 
name of the Moswetuset Hummock (meaning "hill shaped like an arrowhead") 
in Quincy where Plymouth Colony commander Miles Standish, hired English 
military officer, and Squanto, part of the now disappeared Patuxet band 
of the Wampanoag peoples, met Chief Chickatawbut in 1621.[64][65] The official 
name of the state is the "Commonwealth of Massachusetts".[66] Colloquially, 
it is often referred to simply as "the Commonwealth". While this designation 
is part of the state's official name, it has no practical implications.[67] 
Massachusetts has the same position and powers within the United States 
as other states.[68] Massachusetts was originally inhabited by tribes of 
the Algonquian language family such as the Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, 
Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett.[69][70] While cultivation of crops 
like squash and corn supplemented their diets, these tribes were generally 
dependent on hunting, gathering and fishing for most of their food supply.[69] 
Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as long houses,[70] 
and tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems.[71] In the 
early 1600s, after contact had been made with Europeans, large numbers 
of the indigenous people in the northeast of what is now the United States 
were killed by virgin soil epidemics such as smallpox, measles, influenza, 
and perhaps leptospirosis.[72][73] Between 1617 and 1619, smallpox killed 
approximately 90% of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans.[74] The first 
English settlers in Massachusetts, the Pilgrims, arrived via the Mayflower[75] 
at Plymouth in 1620, and developed friendly relations with the native Wampanoag 
people.[76] This was the second successful permanent English colony in 
the part of North America that later became the United States, after the 
Jamestown Colony. The event known as the "First Thanksgiving" was celebrated 
by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World which lasted 
for three days. The Pilgrims were soon followed by other Puritans, who 
established the Massachusetts Bay Colony at present-day Boston in 1630.[77] 
The Puritans, who believed the Church of England needed to be purified 
and experienced harassment from English authority because of their beliefs,[78] 
came to Massachusetts with the goal of establishing an ideal religious 
society.[79] Unlike the Plymouth colony, the bay colony was founded under 
a royal charter in 1629.[80] Both religious dissent and expansionism resulted 
in several new colonies being founded shortly after Plymouth and Massachusetts 
Bay elsewhere in New England. The Massachusetts Bay banished dissenters 
such as Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams due to religious and political 
disagreements. In 1636, Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island and 
Hutchinson joined him there several years later. Religious intolerance 
continued. Among those who objected to this later in the century were the 
English Quaker preachers Alice and Thomas Curwen, who were publicly flogged 
and imprisoned in Boston in 1676.[81][82] In 1641, Massachusetts expanded 
inland significantly, acquiring the Connecticut River Valley settlement 
of Springfield, which had recently disputed with, and defected from its 
original administrators, the Connecticut Colony.[83] This established Massachusetts' 
southern border in the west,[84] though surveying problems resulted in 
disputed territory until 1803–04.[85] In 1691, the colonies of Massachusetts 
Bay and Plymouth were united (along with present-day Maine, which had previously 
been divided between Massachusetts and New York) into the Province of Massachusetts 
Bay.[86] Shortly after the arrival of the new province's first governor, 
Sir William Phips, the Salem witch trials took place, where a number of 
men and women were hanged for alleged witchcraft.[87] The most destructive 
earthquake yet known in New England occurred in 1755, causing considerable 
damage across Massachusetts.[88][89] Massachusetts was a center of the 
movement for independence from Great Britain; colonists in Massachusetts 
had long uneasy relations with the British monarchy, including open rebellion 
under the Dominion of New England in the 1680s.[86] Protests against British 
attempts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in 1763 
led to the Boston Massacre in 1770, and the 1773 Boston Tea Party escalated 
tensions.[90] In 1774, the Intolerable Acts targeted Massachusetts with 
punishments for the Boston Tea Party and further decreased local autonomy, 
increasing local dissent.[91] Anti-Parliamentary activity by men such as 
Samuel Adams and John Hancock, followed by reprisals by the British government, 
were a primary reason for the unity of the Thirteen Colonies and the outbreak 
of the American Revolution in 1775.[92] The Battles of Lexington and Concord 
initiated the American Revolutionary War and were fought in the eponymous 
Massachusetts towns.[93] Future President George Washington took over what 
would become the Continental Army after the battle. His first victory was 
the Siege of Boston in the winter of 1775–76, after which the British were 
forced to evacuate the city.[94] The event is still celebrated in Suffolk 
County as Evacuation Day.[95] On the coast, Salem, Massachusetts, became 
a center for privateering. Although the documentation is incomplete, about 
1,700 Letters of Marque, issued on a per-voyage basis, were granted during 
the American Revolution. Nearly 800 vessels were commissioned as privateers 
and are credited with capturing or destroying about 600 British ships.[96] 
Bostonian John Adams, known as the "Atlas of Independence",[97] was an 
important figure in both the struggle for independence as well as the formation 
of the new United States. Adams was highly involved in the push for separation 
from Britain and the writing of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 
which, in the Elizabeth Freeman and Quock Walker cases, effectively made 
Massachusetts the first state to have a constitution that declared universal 
rights and, as interpreted by Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice William 
Cushing, abolished slavery. David McCullough points out that an equally 
important feature was its placing for the first time the courts as a co-equal 
branch separate from the executive.[98] The Constitution of the Vermont 
Republic, adopted in 1777, represented the first partial ban on slavery. 
Vermont became a state in 1791, but did not fully ban slavery until 1858 
with the Vermont Personal Liberty Law. The Pennsylvania Gradual Abolition 
Act of 1780[99] made Pennsylvania the first state to abolish slavery by 
statute. Later, Adams was active in early American foreign affairs and 
succeeded Washington as the second United States President. His son John 
Quincy Adams, also from Massachusetts,[100] would go on to become the sixth 
United States President. From 1786 to 1787, an armed uprising, known as 
Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays wrought 
havoc throughout Massachusetts, and ultimately attempted to seize the U.S. 
Federal Armory at Springfield.[48] The rebellion was one of the major factors 
in the decision to draft a stronger national constitution to replace the 
Articles of Confederation.[48] On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts became 
the sixth state to ratify the United States Constitution.[101] In 1820, 
Maine separated from Massachusetts and entered the Union as the 23rd state 
as a result of the ratification of the Missouri Compromise.[102] During 
the 19th century, Massachusetts became a national leader in the American 
Industrial Revolution, with factories around cities such as Lowell and 
Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing 
tools, paper, and textiles.[103][104] The economy transformed from one 
based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use 
of water-power and later the steam engine to power factories. Canals and 
railroads were used for transporting raw materials and finished goods.[105] 
At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence 
farms, and later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada.[106][107] 
In the years leading up to the Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of 
progressivism and abolitionist activity. Horace Mann made the state's school 
system a national model.[108] Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson 
made major contributions to American philosophy.[109] Members of the transcendentalist 
movement emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to 
humanity.[109] Although significant opposition to abolitionism existed 
early on in Massachusetts, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 
1835 and 1837,[110] opposition to slavery gradually increased throughout 
the next few decades.[111][112] Abolitionists John Brown and Sojourner 
Truth lived in Springfield and Northampton, respectively, while Frederick 
Douglass lived in Boston. The works of such abolitionists contributed to 
Massachusetts' actions during the Civil War. Massachusetts was the first 
state to recruit, train, and arm a Black regiment with White officers, 
the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.[113] In 1852, Massachusetts 
became the first state to pass compulsory school attendance laws.[114] 
Alexander Graham Bell is commonly credited as the inventor of the first 
practical telephone. On March 10, 1876 at Boston University, he was able 
to communicate with his assistant Thomas A. Watson in the next room. With 
the exodus of several manufacturing companies, the area's industrial economy 
began to decline during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition 
from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led to the 
collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, 
and precision mechanics.[115] This decline would continue into the later 
half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts 
residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000.[116] 
The 1969 closure of the Springfield Armory, in particular, spurred an exodus 
of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly 
as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.[117] 
Massachusetts manufactured 3.4 percent of total United States military 
armaments produced during World War II, ranking tenth among the 48 states.[118] 
In Eastern Massachusetts, following World War II, the economy was transformed 
from one based on heavy industry into a service-based economy.[119] Government 
contracts, private investment, and research facilities led to a new and 
improved industrial climate, with reduced unemployment and increased per 
capita income. Suburbanization flourished, and by the 1970s, the Route 
128 corridor was dotted with high-technology companies who recruited graduates 
of the area's many elite institutions of higher education.[120] The Kennedy 
family was prominent in Massachusetts politics in the 20th century. Children 
of businessman and ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. included John F. Kennedy, 
who was a senator and US president before his assassination in 1963, Robert 
F. Kennedy, who was a senator, US attorney general, and presidential candidate 
before his assassination in 1968, Ted Kennedy, a senator from 1962 until 
his death in 2009,[121] and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a co-founder of the 
Special Olympics.[122] In 1966, Massachusetts became the first state to 
popularly elect an African American to the US senate with Edward Brooke.[123] 
George H. W. Bush, 41st President of the United States (1989–1993) was 
born in Milton, Massachusetts in 1924.[124] In 1987, the state received 
federal funding for the Central Artery/Tunnel Project. Commonly known as 
"the Big Dig", it was, at the time, the biggest federal highway project 
ever approved.[125] The project included making the Central Artery a tunnel 
under downtown Boston, in addition to the re-routing of several other major 
highways.[126] Often controversial, with numerous claims of graft and mismanagement, 
and with its initial price tag of $2.5 billion increasing to a final tally 
of over $15 billion, the Big Dig has nonetheless changed the face of Downtown 
Boston.[125] It has connected areas that were once divided by elevated 
highway (much of the raised old Central Artery was replaced with the Rose 
Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway), and improved traffic conditions along a number 
of routes.[125][126] Additionally, Massachusetts has had a diplomatic relationship 
with the Japanese prefecture of Hokkaido since 1988.[127] On May 17, 2004, 
Massachusetts became the first state in the U.S. to legalize same-sex marriage 
after a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in November 2003 determined 
that the exclusion of same-sex couples from the right to a civil marriage 
was unconstitutional.[56] This decision was eventually superseded by the 
U.S. Supreme Court's affirmation of same-sex marriage in the United States 
in 2015. Two pressure cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the 
Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 at around 2:49 pm EDT. The explosions 
killed three civilians and injured an estimated 264 others. The Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later identified the suspects as brothers 
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The ensuing manhunt ended on April 
19 when thousands of law enforcement officers searched a 20-block area 
of nearby Watertown. Dzhokhar later said that he was motivated by extremist 
Islamic beliefs and learned to build explosive devices from an online magazine 
of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. On November 8, 2016, Massachusetts 
voted in favor of The Massachusetts Marijuana Legalization Initiative, 
also known as Question 4. [128] It was included on the United States presidential 
election, 2016 ballot in Massachusetts as an indirect initiated state statute. 
[129] Massachusetts is the 7th smallest state in the United States. It 
is located in the New England region of the northeastern United States, 
and has an area of 10,555 square miles (27,340 km2), 25.7% of which is 
water. Several large bays distinctly shape its coast. Boston is the largest 
city, at the inmost point of Massachusetts Bay, and the mouth of the Charles 
River. Despite its small size, Massachusetts features numerous topographically 
distinctive regions. The large coastal plain of the Atlantic Ocean in the 
eastern section of the state contains Greater Boston, along with most of 
the state's population,[41] as well as the distinctive Cape Cod peninsula. 
To the west lies the hilly, rural region of Central Massachusetts, and 
beyond that, the Connecticut River Valley. Along the western border of 
Western Massachusetts lies the highest elevated part of the state, the 
Berkshire Mountains range. The U.S. National Park Service administers a 
number of natural and historical sites in Massachusetts.[130] Along with 
twelve national historic sites, areas, and corridors, the National Park 
Service also manages the Cape Cod National Seashore and the Boston Harbor 
Islands National Recreation Area.[130] In addition, the Massachusetts Department 
of Conservation and Recreation maintains a number of parks, trails, and 
beaches throughout Massachusetts.[131] The primary biome of inland Massachusetts 
is temperate deciduous forest.[132] Although much of Massachusetts had 
been cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of old growth forest 
in isolated pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas 
as farms have been abandoned.[133] Currently, forests cover around 62% 
of Massachusetts.[134] The areas most affected by human development include 
the Greater Boston area in the east and the Springfield metropolitan area 
in the west, although the latter includes agricultural areas throughout 
the Connecticut River Valley.[135] There are currently 219 endangered species 
in Massachusetts.[136] A number of species are doing well in the increasingly 
urbanized Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger 
cities as nesting areas,[137] and the population of coyotes, whose diet 
may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades.[138] 
White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are 
also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas in the western 
part of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have 
returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in 
agriculture.[139] Massachusetts is located along the Atlantic Flyway, a 
major route for migratory waterfowl along the eastern coast.[140] Lakes 
in central Massachusetts provide habitat for many species of fish and waterfowl, 
but some species such as the common loon are becoming rare.[141] A significant 
population of long-tailed ducks winter off Nantucket. Small offshore islands 
and beaches are home to roseate terns and are important breeding areas 
for the locally threatened piping plover.[142] Protected areas such as 
the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding habitat 
for shorebirds and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population 
of gray seals. Freshwater fish species in Massachusetts include bass, carp, 
catfish, and trout, while saltwater species such as Atlantic cod, haddock, 
and American lobster populate offshore waters.[143] Other marine species 
include Harbor seals, the endangered North Atlantic right whales, as well 
as humpback whales, fin whales, minke whales, and Atlantic white-sided 
dolphins. Massachusetts has a transitional climate between the humid continental 
and humid subtropical climate regimes. The warm to hot summers render the 
oceanic climate rare in this transition, only applying to exposed coastal 
areas such as on the peninsula of Barnstable County. The climate of Boston 
is quite representative for the commonwealth, characterized by summer highs 
of around 81 °F (27 °C) and winter highs of 35 °F (2 °C), and is quite 
wet. Frosts are frequent all winter, even in coastal areas due to prevailing 
inland winds. The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population 
of Massachusetts was 6,794,422 on July 1, 2015, a 3.77% increase since 
the 2010 United States Census.[7] As of 2014, Massachusetts was estimated 
to be the third most densely populated U.S. state, with 839.4 people per 
square mile,[7] behind New Jersey and Rhode Island. In 2014, Massachusetts 
had 1,011,811 foreign-born residents or 15% of the population.[7] Most 
Bay State residents live within the Boston Metropolitan Area, also known 
as Greater Boston, which includes Boston and its proximate surroundings 
but also extending to Greater Lowell and to Worcester. The Springfield 
Metropolitan Area is also a major center of population. Demographically, 
the center of population of Massachusetts is located in the town of Natick.[148][149] 
Like the rest of the northeastern United States, the population of Massachusetts 
has continued to grow in the past few decades. Massachusetts is the fastest 
growing state in New England and the 25th fastest growing state in the 
United States.[150] Population growth was largely due to a relatively high 
quality of life and a large higher education system in the state.[150] 
Foreign immigration is also a factor in the state's population growth, 
causing the state's population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census 
(particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are 
lower).[151][152] 40% of foreign immigrants were from Central or South 
America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study, with many of the remainder 
from Asia. Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim 
Puerto Rican descent.[151] Many areas of Massachusetts showed relatively 
stable population trends between 2000 and 2010.[152] Exurban Boston and 
coastal areas grew the most rapidly, while Berkshire County in far Western 
Massachusetts and Barnstable County on Cape Cod were the only counties 
to lose population as of the 2010 Census.[152] By gender, 48.4% were male 
and 51.6% were female in 2014. In terms of age, 79.2% were over 18 years 
old and 14.8% were over 65 years old.[7] As of 2014, in terms of race and 
ethnicity, Massachusetts was 83.2% White (73.7% Non-Hispanic White), 8.8% 
Black or African American, 0.5% Native American and Alaska Native, 6.3% 
Asian American, <0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 2.1% 
from Some Other Race, and 3.1% from Two or More Races. Hispanics and Latinos 
of any race made up 11.2% of the population.[7] The state's most populous 
ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, has declined from 95.4% in 1970 to 73.7% 
in 2014.[7][154] As of 2011, non-Hispanic whites were involved in 63.6% 
of all the births,[155] while 36.4% of the population of Massachusetts 
younger than age 1 was minorities (meaning that they had at least one parent 
who was not non-Hispanic white).[156] As late as 1795, the population of 
Massachusetts was nearly 95% of English ancestry.[157] During the early 
and mid 19th century, immigrant groups began arriving in Massachusetts 
in large numbers; first from Ireland in the 1840s;[158] today the Irish 
and part-Irish are the largest ancestry group in the state at nearly 25% 
of the total population. Others arrived later from Quebec as well as places 
in Europe such as Italy, Portugal, and Poland.[159] In the early 20th century, 
a number of African Americans migrated to Massachusetts, although in somewhat 
fewer numbers than many other Northern states.[160] Later in the 20th century, 
immigration from Latin America increased considerably. Over 156,000 Chinese 
Americans made their home in Massachusetts in 2014,[161] and Boston hosts 
a growing Chinatown accommodating heavily traveled Chinese-owned bus lines 
to and from Chinatown, Manhattan in New York City. Massachusetts also has 
large Puerto Rican, Dominican, Haitian, Cape Verdean and Brazilian populations. 
Boston's South End and Jamaica Plain are both gay villages, as is nearby 
Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Massachusetts has a relatively 
large population of Irish descent (22.5% of the population) and also significant 
populations of Italians (13.5%), English (11.4%), and French (8%).[162] 
Lowell is home to the second-largest Cambodian (Khmer) community of the 
nation.[163] There are also several populations of Native Americans in 
Massachusetts, the Wampanoag tribe maintains reservations at Aquinnah on 
Martha's Vineyard and at Mashpee on Cape Cod - with an ongoing native language 
revival project underway since 1993; while the Nipmuck maintain two state-recognized 
reservations in the central part of the state, including one at Grafton.[164] 
Massachusetts has avoided many forms of racial strife seen elsewhere in 
the US, but examples such as the successful electoral showings of the nativist 
(mainly anti-Catholic) Know Nothings in the 1850s,[165] the controversial 
Sacco and Vanzetti executions in the 1920s,[166] and Boston's opposition 
to desegregation busing in the 1970s[167] show that the ethnic history 
of Massachusetts was not completely harmonious. The most common varieties 
of American English spoken in Massachusetts, other than General American 
English, are the cot-caught distinct, rhotic, western Massachusetts dialect 
and the cot-caught merged, non-rhotic, eastern Massachusetts dialect (popularly 
known as a "Boston accent").[168] As of 2010, 78.93% (4,823,127) of Massachusetts 
residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, 
while 7.50% (458,256) spoke Spanish, 2.97% (181,437) Portuguese, 1.59% 
(96,690) Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), 1.11% (67,788) 
French, 0.89% (54,456) French Creole, 0.72% (43,798) Italian, 0.62% (37,865) 
Russian, and Vietnamese was spoken as a main language by 0.58% (35,283) 
of the population over the age of five. In total, 21.07% (1,287,419) of 
Massachusetts' population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other 
than English.[7][169] Massachusetts was founded and settled by the Puritans 
in 1620[78][76] and most people in Massachusetts today remain Christians.[7] 
The descendants of the Puritans belong to many different churches; in the 
direct line of inheritance are the various Congregational churches, United 
Church of Christ and the congregations of Unitarian Universalist Association. 
The headquarters of the Unitarian Universalist Association, long located 
on Beacon Hill, is now located in South Boston.[171][172] Many Puritan 
descendants also dispersed to other Protestant denominations. Some disaffiliated 
along with Roman Catholics and other Christian groups in the wake of modern 
secularization. Today, Christians make up 57% of the state's population, 
with Protestants making up 21% of them. Roman Catholics make up 34% and 
now predominate because of massive immigration from primarily Catholic 
countries and regions – chiefly Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Quebec, 
and Latin America. Both Protestant and Roman Catholic communities have 
been in decline since the late 20th century, due to the rise of irreligion 
in New England. It is the most irreligious region of the country, along 
with the Western United States. A significant Jewish population immigrated 
to the Boston and Springfield areas between 1880 and 1920. Jews currently 
make up 3% of the population. Mary Baker Eddy made the Boston Mother Church 
of Christian Science the world headquarters. Buddhists, Pagans, Hindus, 
Seventh-day Adventists, Muslims, and Mormons also can be found. Kripalu 
Center in Stockbridge, the Shaolin Meditation Temple in Springfield, and 
the Insight Meditation Center in Barre are examples of non-Abrahamic religious 
centers in Massachusetts. According to 2010 data from The Association of 
Religion Data Archives (ARDA) the largest single denominations are the 
Roman Catholic Church with 2,940,199 adherents; the United Church of Christ 
with 86,639 adherents; and the Episcopal Church with 81,999 adherents.[173] 
32% of the population identifies as having no religion.[174] The United 
States Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that the Massachusetts gross 
state product in 2013 was US$446 billion.[175] The per capita personal 
income in 2012 was $53,221, making it the third highest state in the nation.[176] 
Thirteen Fortune 500 companies are located in Massachusetts, the largest 
of which are the Liberty Mutual Insurance Group of Boston and MassMutual 
Financial Services of Springfield.[177] CNBC's list of "Top States for 
Business for 2014" has recognized Massachusetts as the 25th best state 
in the nation for business.[178] According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing 
International, Massachusetts had the sixth-largest number of millionaires 
per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.73 percent.[179] Boston-Logan 
International Airport is the busiest airport in New England, serving 33.4 
million total passengers in 2015, and witnessing rapid growth in international 
air traffic since 2010.[180] Sectors vital to the Massachusetts economy 
include higher education, biotechnology, information technology, finance, 
health care, tourism, and defense. The Route 128 corridor and Greater Boston 
continue to be a major center for venture capital investment,[181] and 
high technology remains an important sector. In recent years tourism has 
played an ever-important role in the state's economy, with Boston and Cape 
Cod being the leading destinations.[182] Other popular tourist destinations 
include Salem, Plymouth, and the Berkshires. Massachusetts is the sixth 
most popular tourist destination for foreign travelers.[183] As of 2012, 
there were 7,755 farms in Massachusetts encompassing a total of 523,517 
acres (2,120 km2), averaging 67.5 acres (0.273 km2) apiece.[184] Particular 
agricultural products of note include green house products making up more 
than one third of the states agricultural output, cranberries, sweet corn 
and apples are also large sectors of production.[185] Massachusetts is 
the second-largest cranberry-producing state in the union after Wisconsin.[186] 
Depending on how it is calculated, state and local tax burden in Massachusetts 
has been estimated among U.S. states and Washington D.C. as 21st highest 
(11.44% or $6,163 per year for a household with nationwide median income)[187] 
or 25th highest overall with below-average corporate taxes (39th highest), 
above-average personal income taxes, (13th highest), above-average sales 
tax (18th) highest, and below-average property taxes (46th highest).[188] 
In the 1970s, the Commonwealth ranked as a relatively high-tax state, gaining 
the pejorative nickname "Taxachusetts". This was followed by a round of 
tax limitations during the 1980s - a conservative period in American politics 
- including Proposition 2½.[189] As of January 1, 2016, Massachusetts has 
a flat-rate personal income tax of 5.1%,[190] after a 2002 voter referendum 
to eventually lower the rate to 5.0%[191] as amended by the legislature.[192] 
There is a tax exemption for income below a threshold that varies from 
year to year. The corporate income tax rate is 8.8%,[193] and the short-term 
capital gains tax rate is 12%.[194] An unusual provision allows filers 
to voluntarily pay at the pre-referendum 5.85% income tax rate, which is 
done by between one and two thousand taxpayers per year.[195] The state 
imposes a 6.25% sales tax[193] on retail sales of tangible personal property—except 
for groceries, clothing (up to $175.00), and periodicals.[196] The sales 
tax is charged on clothing that costs more than $175.00, for the amount 
exceeding $175.00.[196] Massachusetts also charges a use tax when goods 
are bought from other states and the vendor does not remit Massachusetts 
sales tax; taxpayers report and pay this on their income tax forms or dedicated 
forms, though there are "safe harbor" amounts that can be paid without 
tallying up actual purchases (except for purchases over $1000).[196] There 
is no inheritance tax and limited Massachusetts estate tax related to federal 
estate tax collection.[194] Massachusetts' electricity generation market 
was made competitive in 1998, enabling retail customers to change suppliers 
without changing utility companies.[197] In 2012, Massachusetts consumed 
1374.4 trillion BTU,[198] making it the fifth lowest state in terms of 
consumption of energy per capita, and 63% of that energy came from natural 
gas.[198] In 2014 and 2015, Massachusetts was ranked as the most energy 
efficient state the United States[199][200] while Boston is the most efficient 
city,[201] but it had the third highest electricity prices of any state.[198] 
Massachusetts has 10 regional metropolitan planning organizations and three 
non-metropolitan planning organizations covering the remainder of the state;[202] 
statewide planning is handled by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. 
Amtrak operates inter-city rail, including the high-speed Acela service 
to cities such as Providence, New Haven, New York City, and Washington, 
DC from South Station. From North Station the Amtrak Downeaster serves 
Portland, Maine and Brunswick, Maine.[203] The Massachusetts Bay Transportation 
Authority (MBTA), also known as "The T",[204] operates public transportation 
in the form of subway,[205] bus,[206] and ferry[207] systems in the Metro 
Boston area. It also operates longer distance commuter rail services throughout 
the larger Greater Boston area, including service to Worcester, Lowell, 
and Plymouth.[208] As of the summer of 2013 the Cape Cod Regional Transit 
Authority in collaboration with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 
and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) is operating 
the CapeFLYER providing passenger rail service between Boston and Cape 
Cod.[209][210] Fifteen other regional transit authorities provide public 
transportation in the form of bus services in their local communities.[211] 
Two heritage railways are also in operation: the Cape Cod Central Railroad 
and the Berkshire Scenic Railway.[212][213] As of 2015, a number of freight 
railroads were operating in Massachusetts, with CSX being the largest carrier.[214] 
Massachusetts has a total of 892 miles (1,436 km) of freight trackage in 
operation.[215] The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship 
Authority regulates freight and passenger ferry service to the islands 
of Massachusetts including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.[216] The major 
airport in the state is Boston-Logan International Airport. The airport 
served 33.5 million passengers in 2015, up from 31.6 million in 2014,[180] 
and is used by around 40 airlines with a total of 103 gates.[217] Logan 
International Airport has service to numerous cities throughout the United 
States, as well as international service to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, 
Europe, and Asia.[218] Logan, Hanscom Field in Bedford, and Worcester Regional 
Airport are operated by Massport, an independent state transportation agency.[218] 
Massachusetts has approximately 42 public-use airfields, and over 200 private 
landing spots.[219] Some airports receive funding from the Aeronautics 
Division of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the Federal 
Aviation Administration; the FAA is also the primary regulator of Massachusetts 
air travel.[220] There are a total of 31,300 miles (50,400 km) of interstates 
and other highways in Massachusetts.[221] Interstate 90 (I-90, also known 
as the Massachusetts Turnpike), is the longest interstate in Massachusetts. 
The route travels 136 mi (219 km) generally west to east, entering Massachusetts 
at the New York state line in the town of West Stockbridge, and passes 
just north of Springfield, just south of Worcester and through Framingham 
before terminating near Logan International Airport in Boston.[222] Other 
major interstates include I-91, which travels generally north and south 
along the Connecticut River; I-93, which travels north and south through 
central Boston, then passes through Methuen before entering New Hampshire; 
and I-95, which connects Providence, Rhode Island with Greater Boston, 
forming a partial loop concurrent with Route 128 around the more urbanized 
areas before continuing north along the coast into New Hampshire. I-495 
forms a wide loop around the outer edge of Greater Boston. Other major 
interstates in Massachusetts include I-291, I-391, I-84, I-195, I-395, 
I-290, and I-190. Major non-interstate highways in Massachusetts include 
U.S. Routes 1, 3, 6, and 20, and state routes 2, 3, 9, 24, and 128. A great 
majority of interstates in Massachusetts were constructed during the mid 
20th century, and at times were controversial, particularly the intent 
to route I-95 northeastwards from Providence, Rhode Island, directly through 
central Boston, first proposed in 1948. Opposition to continued construction 
grew, and in 1970 Governor Francis W. Sargent issued a general prohibition 
on most further freeway construction within the I-95/Route 128 loop in 
the Boston area.[223] A massive undertaking to bring I-93 underground in 
downtown Boston, called the Big Dig, brought the city's highway system 
under public scrutiny for its high cost and construction quality.[125] 
Massachusetts has a long political history; earlier political structures 
included the Mayflower Compact of 1620, the separate Massachusetts Bay 
and Plymouth colonies, and the combined colonial Province of Massachusetts. 
The Massachusetts Constitution was ratified in 1780 while the Revolutionary 
War was in progress, four years after the Articles of Confederation was 
drafted, and eight years before the present United States Constitution 
was ratified on June 21, 1788. Drafted by John Adams, the Massachusetts 
Constitution is currently the oldest functioning written constitution in 
continuous effect in the world.[224][225][226] Massachusetts politics since 
the second half of the 20th century have generally been dominated by the 
Democratic Party, and the state has a reputation for being the most liberal 
state in the country.[227] In 1974, Elaine Noble became the first openly 
lesbian or gay candidate elected to a state legislature in US history.[228] 
The state housed the first openly gay member of the United States House 
of Representatives, Gerry Studds, in 1972[229] and in 2004, Massachusetts 
became the first state to allow same-sex marriage.[56] The Government of 
Massachusetts is divided into three branches: Executive, Legislative, and 
Judicial. The governor of Massachusetts heads the executive branch; duties 
of the governor include signing or vetoing legislation, filling judicial 
and agency appointments, granting pardons, preparing an annual budget, 
and commanding the Massachusetts National Guard.[230] Massachusetts governors, 
unlike those of most other states, are addressed as His/Her Excellency.[230] 
The current governor is Charlie Baker,[231] a Republican from Swampscott.[232] 
The executive branch also includes the Executive Council, which is made 
up of eight elected councilors and the Lieutenant Governor seat,[230] which 
is currently occupied by Karyn Polito.[231] Abilities of the Council include 
confirming gubernatorial appointments and certifying elections.[230] The 
Massachusetts House of Representatives and Massachusetts Senate comprise 
the legislature of Massachusetts, known as the Massachusetts General Court.[230] 
The House consists of 160 members while the Senate has 40 members.[230] 
Leaders of the House and Senate are chosen by the members of those bodies; 
the leader of the House is known as the Speaker while the leader of the 
Senate is known as the President.[230] Each branch consists of several 
committees.[230] Members of both bodies are elected to two-year terms.[233] 
The Judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Judicial Court, which serves 
over a number of lower courts.[230] The Supreme Judicial Court is made 
up of a chief justice and six associate justices.[230] Judicial appointments 
are made by the governor and confirmed by the executive council.[230] The 
Congressional delegation from Massachusetts is entirely Democratic.[234] 
Currently, the US senators are Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey. 
The members of the state's delegation to the US House of Representatives 
are Richard Neal, Jim McGovern, Niki Tsongas, Joseph Kennedy III, Katherine 
Clark, Seth Moulton, Mike Capuano, Stephen Lynch, and Bill Keating.[235] 
Federal court cases are heard in the United States District Court for the 
District of Massachusetts, and appeals are heard by the United States Court 
of Appeals for the First Circuit.[236] In U.S. presidential elections since 
2012, Massachusetts has been allotted 11 votes in the electoral college, 
out of a total of 538.[237] Like most states, Massachusetts's electoral 
votes are granted in a winner-take-all system.[238] Throughout the mid 
20th century, Massachusetts has gradually shifted from a Republican-leaning 
state to one largely dominated by Democrats; the 1952 victory of John F. 
Kennedy over incumbent Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. is seen as a watershed 
moment in this transformation. His younger brother Edward M. Kennedy held 
that seat until his death from a brain tumor in 2009.[239] Massachusetts 
has since gained a reputation as being a politically liberal state and 
is often used as an archetype of modern liberalism, hence the usage of 
the phrase "Massachusetts liberal".[240] Massachusetts routinely votes 
for the Democratic Party, with the core concentrations in the Boston metro 
area, the Cape and Islands, and Western Massachusetts outside Hampden County. 
Pockets of Republican strength are in the central areas along the I-495 
crescent, Hampden County, and communities on the south and north shores,[241] 
but the state as a whole has not given its Electoral College votes to a 
Republican in a presidential election since Ronald Reagan carried it in 
1984. Additionally, Massachusetts provided Reagan with his smallest margins 
of victory in both the 1980[242] and 1984 elections.[243] As of the 2014 
election, the Democratic Party holds a significant majority over the Republican 
party. Only 35 of the 160 seats in the state house[244] and 6 of the 40 
seats in the state senate belong to the Republican Party.[245] Although 
Republicans held the governor's office continuously from 1991 to 2007 and 
from 2015 onwards,[231] they have been among the most moderate Republican 
leaders in the nation.[247][248] In the 2004 election, the state gave Massachusetts 
senator John Kerry 61.9% of the vote, his best showing in any state.[249] 
In 2008, President Barack Obama carried the state with 61.8% of the vote.[250] 
In the 2010 special election for the U.S. Senate, Republican Scott Brown 
defeated Democrat Martha Coakley by a 52% to 47% margin only to lose the 
seat in the 2012 Senate election to Elizabeth Warren, the first female 
senator to represent Massachusetts.[251][252] A number of contemporary 
national political issues have been influenced by events in Massachusetts, 
such as the decision in 2003 by the state Supreme Judicial Court allowing 
same-sex marriage[253] and a 2006 bill which mandated health insurance 
for all Bay Staters.[254] In 2008, Massachusetts voters passed an initiative 
decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana.[255] Voters in 
Massachusetts also approved a ballot measure in 2012 that legalized the 
medical use of marijuana.[256] There are 50 cities and 301 towns in Massachusetts, 
grouped into 14 counties.[258] The fourteen counties, moving roughly from 
west to east, are Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden, Worcester, Middlesex, 
Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Bristol, Plymouth, Barnstable, Dukes, and Nantucket. 
Eleven communities which call themselves "towns" are, by law, cities since 
they have traded the town meeting form of government for a mayor-council 
or manager-council form.[259] Boston is the state capital and largest city 
in Massachusetts. The population of the city proper is 645,966,[260] and 
Greater Boston, with a population of 4,628,910, is the 10th largest metropolitan 
area in the nation.[261] Other cities with a population over 100,000 include 
Worcester, Springfield, Lowell, and Cambridge. Plymouth is the largest 
municipality in the state by land area.[258] Massachusetts, along with 
the five other New England states, features the local governmental structure 
known as the New England town.[262] In this structure, incorporated towns—as 
opposed to townships or counties—hold many of the responsibilities and 
powers of local government.[262] Most of the county governments were abolished 
by the state of Massachusetts beginning in 1997 including Middlesex County,[263] 
the largest county in the state by population.[264][265] The voters of 
these now defunct counties elect only Sheriffs and Registers of Deeds, 
who are part of the state government. Other counties have been reorganized, 
and a few still retain county councils.[266] Massachusetts was the first 
state in North America to require municipalities to appoint a teacher or 
establish a grammar school with the passage of the Massachusetts Education 
Law of 1647,[267] and 19th century reforms pushed by Horace Mann laid much 
of the groundwork for contemporary universal public education[268][269] 
which was established in 1852.[114] Massachusetts is home to the oldest 
school in continuous existence in North America (The Roxbury Latin School, 
founded in 1645), as well as the country's oldest public elementary school 
(The Mather School, founded in 1639),[270] its oldest high school (Boston 
Latin School, founded in 1635),[271] its oldest continuously operating 
boarding school (The Governor's Academy, founded in 1763),[272] its oldest 
college (Harvard University, founded in 1636),[273] and its oldest women's 
college (Mount Holyoke College, founded in 1837).[274] Massachusetts' per-student 
public expenditure for elementary and secondary schools was eighth in the 
nation in 2012, at $14,844.[275] In 2013, Massachusetts scored highest 
of all the states in math and third highest in reading on the National 
Assessment of Educational Progress.[276] Massachusetts is home to 121 institutions 
of higher education.[277] Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, both located in Cambridge, consistently rank among the world's 
best universities.[278] In addition to Harvard and MIT, several other Massachusetts 
universities currently rank in the top 50 at the national level in the 
widely cited rankings of U.S. News and World Report: Tufts University (#27), 
Boston College (#30), Brandeis University (#34), Boston University (#41) 
and Northeastern University (#47). Massachusetts is also home to three 
of the top five U.S. News and World Report's best Liberal Arts Colleges: 
Williams College (#1), Amherst College (#2), and Wellesley College (#4).[279] 
The public University of Massachusetts (nicknamed UMass) features five 
campuses in the state, with its flagship campus in Amherst that enrolls 
over 25,000 students.[280][281] Massachusetts has contributed to American 
arts and culture. Drawing from its Native American and Yankee roots, along 
with later immigrant groups, Massachusetts has produced a number of writers, 
artists, and musicians. A number of major museums and important historical 
sites are also located there, and events and festivals throughout the year 
celebrate the state's history and heritage.[282] Massachusetts was an early 
center of the Transcendentalist movement, which emphasized intuition, emotion, 
human individuality and a deeper connection with nature.[109] Ralph Waldo 
Emerson, who was born in Boston but spent much of his later life in Concord, 
largely created the philosophy with his 1836 work Nature, and continued 
to be a key figure in the movement for the remainder of his life. Emerson's 
friend, Henry David Thoreau, who was also involved in Transcendentalism, 
recorded his year spent alone in a small cabin at nearby Walden Pond in 
the 1854 work Walden; or, Life in the Woods.[283] Other famous authors 
and poets born or strongly associated with Massachusetts include Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, John Updike, Emily Dickinson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, E.E. 
Cummings, Sylvia Plath, H.P. Lovecraft, and Theodor Seuss Geisel, better 
known as "Dr. Seuss".[284][285][286] Famous painters from Massachusetts 
include Winslow Homer and Norman Rockwell;[286] many of the latter's works 
are on display at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge.[287] Massachusetts 
is also an important center for the performing arts. Both the Boston Symphony 
Orchestra and Boston Pops Orchestra are based in Massachusetts.[288] Other 
orchestras in Massachusetts include the Cape Cod Symphony Orchestra in 
Barnstable and the Springfield Symphony Orchestra.[289][290] Tanglewood, 
in western Massachusetts, is a music venue that is home to both the Tanglewood 
Music Festival and Tanglewood Jazz Festival, as well as the summer host 
for the Boston Symphony Orchestra.[291] Other performing arts and theater 
organizations in Massachusetts include the Boston Ballet, the Boston Lyric 
Opera,[288] and the Lenox-based Shakespeare & Company. In addition to classical 
and folk music, Massachusetts has produced musicians and bands spanning 
a number of contemporary genres, such as the classic rock band Aerosmith, 
the proto-punk band The Modern Lovers, the new wave band The Cars, and 
the alternative rock band Pixies.[292] Film events in the state include 
the Boston Film Festival, the Boston International Film Festival, and a 
number of smaller film festivals in various cities throughout Massachusetts.[293] 
Massachusetts is home to a large number of museums and historical sites. 
The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, 
and the DeCordova contemporary art and sculpture museum in Lincoln are 
all located within Massachusetts,[294] and the Maria Mitchell Association 
in Nantucket includes several observatories, museums, and an aquarium.[295] 
Historically themed museums and sites such as the Springfield Armory National 
Historic Site in Springfield,[130] Boston's Freedom Trail and nearby Minute 
Man National Historical Park, both of which preserve a number of sites 
important during the American Revolution,[130][296] the Lowell National 
Historical Park, which focuses on some of the earliest mills and canals 
of the industrial revolution in the US,[130] the Black Heritage Trail in 
Boston, which includes important African-American and abolitionist sites 
in Boston,[297] and the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park[130] 
all showcase various periods of Massachusetts's history. Plimoth Plantation 
and Old Sturbridge Village are two open-air or "living" museums in Massachusetts, 
recreating life as it was in the 17th and early 19th centuries, respectively.[298][299] 
Boston's annual St. Patrick's Day parade and "Harborfest", a week-long 
Fourth of July celebration featuring a fireworks display and concert by 
the Boston Pops as well as a turnaround cruise in Boston Harbor by the 
USS Constitution, are popular events.[300] The New England Summer Nationals, 
an auto show in Worcester, draws tens of thousands of attendees every year.[301] 
The Boston Marathon is also a popular event in the state drawing more than 
30,000 runners and tens of thousands of spectators annually.[302] Long-distance 
hiking trails in Massachusetts include the Appalachian Trail, the New England 
National Scenic Trail, the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail, the Midstate Trail, 
and the Bay Circuit Trail.[303] Other outdoor recreational activities in 
Massachusetts include sailing and yachting, freshwater and deep-sea fishing,[304] 
whale watching,[305] downhill and cross-country skiing,[306] and hunting.[307] 
There are two major television media markets located in Massachusetts. 
The Boston/Manchester market is the fifth largest in the United States.[308] 
The other market surrounds the Springfield area.[309] WGBH-TV in Boston 
is a major public television station and produces national programs such 
as Nova, Frontline, and American Experience.[310][311] The Boston Globe, 
Boston Herald, Springfield Republican, and the Worcester Telegram & Gazette 
are Massachusetts's largest daily newspapers.[312] In addition, there are 
many community dailies and weeklies. There are a number of major AM and 
FM stations which serve Massachusetts,[313] along with many more regional 
and community-based stations. Some colleges and universities also operate 
campus television and radio stations, and print their own newspapers.[314][315][316] 
Massachusetts generally ranks highly among states in most health and disease 
prevention categories. In 2014, the United Health Foundation ranked the 
state as third healthiest overall.[317] Massachusetts has the most doctors 
per 100,000 residents,[318] the second-lowest infant mortality rate,[319] 
and the lowest percentage of uninsured residents (for both children as 
well as the total population).[320] According to Businessweek, commonwealth 
residents have an average life expectancy of 78.4 years, the fifth longest 
in the country.[321] 37.2% of the population is overweight and 21.7% is 
obese,[322] and Massachusetts ranks sixth highest in the percentage of 
residents who are considered neither obese nor overweight (41.1%).[322] 
Massachusetts also ranks above average in the prevalence of binge drinking, 
which is the 20th highest in the country.[323] The nation's first Marine 
Hospital was erected by federal order in Boston in 1799.[324][325] There 
are currently a total of 143 hospitals in the state.[326] According to 
2015 rankings by US News & World Report, Massachusetts General Hospital 
the hospital ranked in the top three in two specialties.[327] Massachusetts 
General was founded in 1811 and serves as the largest teaching hospital 
for nearby Harvard University.[328] The state of Massachusetts is a center 
for medical education and research including Harvard's Brigham and Women's 
Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Dana-Farber Cancer 
Institute[329] as well as the New England Baptist Hospital, Tufts Medical 
Center, and Boston Medical Center which is the primary teaching hospital 
for Boston University.[330] The University of Massachusetts Medical School 
is located in Worcester.[331] The Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and 
Health Sciences has two of its three campuses in Boston and Worcester.[332] 
Massachusetts is home to five major league professional sports teams: seventeen-time 
NBA Champions Boston Celtics,[333] eight-time World Series winners Boston 
Red Sox,[334] six-time Stanley Cup winners Boston Bruins,[335] and four-time 
Super Bowl winners New England Patriots.[336] The New England Revolution 
is the Major League Soccer team for Massachusetts and the Boston Cannons 
are the Major League Lacrosse team.[337] The Boston Breakers are the Women's 
Professional Soccer in Massachusetts. Massachusetts is also the home of 
the Cape Cod Baseball League. In the late 19th century, the Olympic sports 
of basketball[54] and volleyball[55] were invented in the Western Massachusetts 
cities of Springfield[54] and Holyoke,[55] respectively. The Basketball 
Hall of Fame, is a major tourist destination in the City of Springfield 
and the Volleyball Hall of Fame is located in Holyoke.[55] The American 
Hockey League (AHL), the NHL's development league, is headquartered in 
Springfield.[338] Several universities in Massachusetts are notable for 
their collegiate athletics. Boston College fields teams in the nationally 
televised Atlantic Coast Conference, while Harvard University competes 
in the famed Ivy League. Boston University, Northeastern University, College 
of the Holy Cross, UMass Lowell, and UMass Amherst also participate in 
Division I athletics.[339][340] Many other Massachusetts colleges compete 
in lower divisions such as Division III, where MIT, Tufts University, Amherst 
College, Williams College, and others field competitive teams. Massachusetts 
is also the home of rowing events such as the Eastern Sprints on Lake Quinsigamond 
and the Head of the Charles Regatta.[341] A number of major golf events 
have taken place in Massachusetts, including nine U.S. Opens and two Ryder 
Cups.[342][343] Massachusetts has produced several successful Olympians 
including Butch Johnson, Todd Richards, Albina Osipowich, Aly Raisman, 
and Susan Rojcewicz.[344] Coordinates: 42°18′N 71°48′W﻿ / ﻿42.3°N 71.8°W﻿
