The following is a history of the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball. 
Professional baseball has been played in the Pittsburgh area since 1876. 
The teams of the era were "independents", barnstorming throughout the region 
and not affiliated with any organized league, though they did have salaries 
and were run as business organizations.[1] In 1882, the strongest team 
in the area joined the American Association as a founding member. Their 
various home fields in the 19th century were in a then-separate city called 
Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team was 
listed as "Allegheny" in the standings, and was sometimes called the "Alleghenys" 
(not the "Alleghenies") in the same generic way that teams from Boston, 
New York, and Chicago were sometimes called the "Bostons", the "New Yorks", 
and the "Chicagos", in the sports writing style of that era. After five 
mediocre seasons in the A.A., Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to 
switch to the older National League in 1887. At this time, the team renamed 
itself the Pittsburgh Alleghenys,[2] although Allegheny remained a separate 
city until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907. At that time, owner-manager 
Horace Phillips sold the team to Dennis McKnight; Phillips stayed on as 
manager.[3] In those early days, the club benefited three times from mergers 
with defunct clubs. The A.A. club picked up a number of players from a 
defunct Columbus, Ohio, team in 1885. The Alleghenys were severely crippled 
during the 1890 season, when nearly all of their stars jumped to the Pittsburgh 
Burghers of the Players' League. With a decimated roster, the team experienced 
what is still the worst season in franchise history, going 23–113.[4] The 
battle nearly ruined McKnight, and he was forced to return his franchise 
to the league. However, almost immediately after this, McKnight joined 
the backers of the Burghers as a minority owner, which then repurchased 
the Pittsburgh National League franchise and rechartered it under a different 
corporate name. They were thus able to legally recover the services of 
most of the players who had jumped to the upstart league a year earlier.[3] 
The new owners also signed highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer, 
who had previously played with the AA's Philadelphia Athletics. The Athletics 
failed to include him on their reserve list, and the Alleghenys picked 
him up. Nonetheless, this led to loud protests by the Athletics, and in 
an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' actions were 
"piratical".[5] This incident (which is discussed at some length in The 
Beer and Whisky League, by David Nemec, 1994) quickly accelerated into 
a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. 
Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, they made 
sport of being denounced for being "piratical" by renaming themselves "the 
Pirates" for the 1891 season.[2] The nickname was first acknowledged on 
the team's uniforms in 1912. Around the time the team adopted the Pirates 
nickname, the United States Board on Geographic Names forced the city of 
Pittsburgh to undergo a controversial name change by having them drop the 
"h" at the end of the name, making the team's official name the "Pittsburg 
Pirates" from the adoption of the Pirates nickname until Pittsburgh was 
able to get the "h" restored to its name in 1911. After the 1899 season, 
the Pirates made what is arguably the best player transaction in franchise 
history when they picked up nearly all of the star players from the Louisville 
Colonels. Louisville owner Barney Dreyfuss had been told that the Colonels 
were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. 
He secretly purchased a half-interest in the Pirates, then after the season 
sent nearly all of the Colonels' stars up the Ohio River to Pittsburgh. 
Since the transaction occurred before the Colonels officially folded, it 
was structured as a trade; the Pirates sent four relatively unknown players 
to Louisville.[3] Despite their nickname, the Pirates at least waited until 
after the season to pull off this blockbuster trade. This is unlike what 
happened in 1899 to the Cleveland Spiders and, to a lesser extent, the 
Baltimore Orioles, who were also part of two-team ownerships. Dreyfuss 
later bought full control of the team and kept it until his death in 1932. 
Bolstered by former Colonels shortstop Honus Wagner (who was born and raised 
in the Pittsburgh area) and player/manager Fred Clarke, the Pirates completely 
dominated the National League, in part because they lost few star players 
to the rival American League. However, owing to injuries to their starting 
pitchers, they lost the first modern World Series ever played, in 1903, 
to Boston. Deacon Phillippe pitched five complete games, winning three 
of them, but it was not enough. With largely the same star players, the 
Pirates would continue to be a strong team over the next few years, and 
won their first World Series title in 1909, defeating the Detroit Tigers 
in seven games. The same year, the club opened Forbes Field, which would 
be its home stadium for the next 61 years. The Pirates originally played 
in Recreation, Union, and Exposition Parks, all in what was then Allegheny 
City. Allegheny City was annexed by Pittsburgh in December 1907. Accordingly, 
the Pirates did not play their first major league game in Pittsburgh until 
1908 – over 25 years after their founding.[6] The decline of Honus Wagner, 
considered by many to be the greatest shortstop ever, led to a number of 
losing seasons, culminating in a disastrous 51–103 record in 1917; however, 
veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler, 
along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back into 
the spotlight. The Pirates recovered from a 3–1 deficit to win the 1925 
World Series over the Washington Senators, and reached the 1927 World Series 
before being swept by the New York Yankees, who at that time had built 
the most dominant team in baseball. The 1927 season was the first for the 
sharp-hitting combination of brothers Lloyd Waner and Paul Waner, who along 
with shortstop Arky Vaughan ensured that the Pirates had plenty of Hall 
of Fame-caliber position players through 1941. However, the Pirates' crushing 
defeats in 1927 and 1938 (when they lost the pennant to the Chicago Cubs 
in the final days of the season) were tremendous setbacks. The post-World 
War II years were not kind to the Pirates, despite the presence of a genuine 
star in Ralph Kiner, who led or co-led the National League in home runs 
for seven consecutive seasons (1946 through 1952). In 1946, the long era 
of ownership by the Barney Dreyfuss family came to an end when it sold 
the team to a syndicate that was led by Indianapolis businessman Frank 
McKinney; the group also included entertainer Bing Crosby, Pittsburgh attorney 
Thomas Johnson, and Columbus, Ohio-based real estate tycoon John W. Galbreath. 
The new owners seemingly scored a coup when they purchased veteran slugger 
Hank Greenberg from the Detroit Tigers for the 1947 season. The Hall-of-Fame-bound 
Greenberg, then 36, had led the American League in home runs (44) and runs 
batted in (127) in 1946, his first full season after almost five years 
in military service. But a contentious relationship with the Detroit front 
office ended his 12-year career with the Tigers after a .319 batting average, 
306 homers and 1,528 hits. With Greenberg a fearsome, right-handed power 
hitter, the Pirates' new ownership decided to make Forbes Field a more 
inviting home run destination. They reduced the previously-cavernous dimensions 
of the left field and left-center-field section of the park by 30 feet 
(9.1 m) by moving the bullpens to the base of the old left field wall, 
behind a new fence that was 335 feet (102 m) from home plate down the left-field 
line. The shorter porch was immediately dubbed "Greenberg Gardens" in honor 
of the former Tiger. As events turned out, however, Greenberg's playing 
career was winding down rapidly. He played only 125 games for the 1947 
Pirates, hit 25 home runs (18 at Forbes Field),[7] batted only .249, and 
then retired from the game. Kiner—who, as rookie, had led the National 
League in homers with 23 playing in the old Forbes Field—became the beneficiary 
of the new left-field configuration, which was quickly renamed "Kiner's 
Korner." He slugged 51 home runs in 1947, then followed with seasons of 
40, 54, 47, 42 and 37 blasts to lead the NL, sharing the home run title 
with Johnny Mize (1947–1948) and Hank Sauer (1952). While attendance figures 
at Forbes Field rose to among the top in the NL, the team built around 
Kiner placed in the first division only once – in 1948 – and in 1952 compiled 
one of the worst records in major league history, winning 42 and losing 
112 games (.273) and finishing 54½ games out of first place. The new ownership 
group reorganized during 1950, when Galbreath, Crosby and Johnson bought 
out McKinney's investment, and Galbreath became majority owner. His family 
would control the destiny of the Pirates for the next 35 years. Galbreath's 
first major move, the hiring of Branch Rickey as general manager after 
the 1950 campaign, was initially a great disappointment to Pittsburgh fans. 
Rickey had invented the farm system with the Cardinals and broken the baseball 
color line with the Dodgers, building dynasties with each club. In Pittsburgh, 
though, he purged the roster of its higher-salaried veterans (including 
Kiner in 1953) and flooded the team with young players. Many of those youngsters 
faltered, but those who fulfilled Rickey's faith in them – pitchers Vern 
Law, Bob Friend and Elroy Face, shortstop Dick Groat, second baseman Bill 
Mazeroski, and especially outfielder Roberto Clemente, drafted from Brooklyn 
after his only minor league season (1954) – would form the nucleus of the 
Pirates' 1960 championship club. Moreover, as in St. Louis and Brooklyn, 
Rickey put into place one of baseball's most successful farm and scouting 
systems, keeping the Pirates competitive into the late 1970s. However, 
all this was not evident when Rickey (then 73) retired due to ill health 
in 1955, with the Pirates still struggling to escape the NL basement. "Kiner's 
Korner", meanwhile, was demolished in 1954, restoring Forbes Field to its 
previous, pitching-friendly contour. The 1948 team was the only postwar 
Pirates squad with a winning record until 1958, Danny Murtaugh's first 
full season as manager. Murtaugh is widely credited with inventing the 
concept of the closer by frequently playing Face late in close games. The 
1960 team featured eight All-Stars, but was widely predicted to lose the 
World Series to a powerful New York Yankees team. In one of the most memorable 
World Series in history, the Pirates were defeated by ten or more runs 
in three games, won three close games, then recovered from a 7–4 deficit 
late in Game 7 eventually to win on a walk-off home run by Mazeroski, a 
second baseman better known for defensive wizardry. The 1960 Pirates were 
the only team between 1945 and 2001 to have not succumbed to the so-called 
"Ex-Cubs Factor" in the postseason. They also became the first team to 
win a World Series on a home run, a feat later achieved by the Toronto 
Blue Jays in 1993, although Joe Carter's home run came in Game 6 of the 
1993 Series. Mazeroski's homer remains the only walk-off home run in Game 
7 of a World Series. The 1960s would continue with extremely solid defensive 
play by Bill Mazeroski and the great offensive and defensive abilities 
of Clemente, baseball's first Puerto Rican superstar. Clemente was regarded 
as one of the game's best all-time hitters, and possessed a tremendous 
arm in right field. Although not the first black-Hispanic baseball player 
(an honor belonging to Minnie Miñoso), Clemente's charisma and leadership 
in humanitarian causes made him an icon across the continent. During his 
playing career, Clemente was often overlooked, but today many consider 
him to have been one of the greatest right fielders in baseball history. 
Even with Roberto Clemente, however, the Pirates struggled to post winning 
marks from 1961 to 1964, and Murtaugh was replaced by Harry Walker in 1965. 
With Walker, a renowned batting coach, at the helm, and the hitting of 
Clemente, Matty Alou, Manny Mota and others, the Bucs fielded contending, 
90+ win teams in both 1965 and 1966, with Clemente claiming the National 
League MVP Award in the latter year. However, Pittsburgh had no answer 
for the pitching of the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants, and finished 
third both seasons. In 1967, they fell back to .500, and did not contend 
through the rest of the 1960s. Slugger Willie Stargell became a fixture 
in the Pittsburgh lineup in the late 1960s, and the Pirates returned to 
prominence in 1970. Murtaugh returned as manager and the Pirates' home 
field, Forbes Field, was demolished in favor of the multi-purpose Three 
Rivers Stadium. In 1970, the Pirates won their first of five National League 
East division titles over the next seven years, and won their fourth World 
Series in 1971 behind a .414 Series batting average by Clemente. They also 
thought they had a genuine superstar pitcher (historically rare for the 
Pirates) in Steve Blass, who pitched two masterful games in the World Series 
against Baltimore and had excellent seasons in 1968 and 1972.[8] On September 
1, 1971, the Pirates made Major League Baseball history by fielding the 
first all-black/minority starting lineup: second baseman Rennie Stennett, 
center fielder Gene Clines, right fielder Roberto Clemente, left fielder 
Willie Stargell, catcher Manny Sanguillén, third baseman Dave Cash, first 
baseman Al Oliver, shortstop Jackie Hernández, and pitcher Dock Ellis.[9] 
Manager Danny Murtaugh had never hesitated using minority players in the 
lineup, but even the players took notice when he posted the lineup that 
day. Blass later recalled, "The thing I remember about it, when he was 
interviewed afterwards, Murtaugh said, ‘I put the nine best athletes out 
there. The best nine I put out there tonight happened to be black. No big 
deal. Next question.’"[10] The sports world was stunned and saddened when 
Clemente died in a plane crash on December 31, 1972, while accompanying 
a shipment of relief supplies to the victims of an earthquake in Nicaragua. 
Tom Walker, then-Montreal Expos pitcher and future father of Pirates second 
baseman Neil Walker, offered to join Clemente that day but Clemente insisted 
that he stay home. Thus, Roberto Clemente had an influence on the 2013 
playoff run. He had reached a milestone by rapping his 3,000th career hit, 
a stand-up double off Jon Matlack of the New York Mets on September 30, 
1972, in what would prove to be his last regular-season at-bat. The Baseball 
Hall of Fame waived its usual waiting requirement and inducted Clemente 
immediately. Pittsburgh would erect a statue and name a bridge and park 
near the stadium after him, as well as a street in the Oakland neighborhood 
near the former site of Forbes Field. In 1973, Blass suffered a mysterious 
decline in his pitching abilities, posting a 9.85 ERA. To this day, pitchers 
who suddenly lose the ability to throw strikes are said to have "Steve 
Blass disease."[11] Blass retired soon after; he has since, for almost 
two decades, been one of the Pirates' radio and TV announcers. The Pirates 
made the playoffs in 1974 and 1975, but lost the National League Championship 
Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds, respectively. 
The speedy Omar Moreno and the power-hitting Dave Parker joined Stargell 
in the lineup during this period. After the 1976 season, in which the Bucs 
finished in second place behind the cross-state Philadelphia Phillies, 
Danny Murtaugh died. The Pirates struck a trade with the Oakland Athletics 
in which catcher Manny Sanguillén was sent to Oakland for manager Chuck 
Tanner. The Pirates would finish second to the Phillies once again in 1977, 
with Parker winning a batting title. It was also in 1977 that the Pirates 
began wearing yellow and black uniforms with pillbox caps. Stargell would 
award teammates with "Stargell Stars" on their caps for excellent plays 
on the field. The following year, the Pirates turned the end of the 1978 
season into an impromptu race for the NL East, as they tried to chase down 
the collapsing Phillies, who ultimately won the division, only to fall 
short during the final home stand of the season (ironically against the 
Phillies). Despite this, Parker won another batting title and was named 
National League MVP to go with it. Adopting the popular song "We Are Family" 
by the Philadelphia disco group Sister Sledge as their theme song, the 
1979 Pirates held off the Montreal Expos to claim the pennant. "We Are 
Family" was elevated from theme song to anthem status (and is still nearly 
synonymous with the '79 Pirates), with fans chanting "Fam-a-lee!" from 
the stands. The Pirates faced the Baltimore Orioles again in the World 
Series, which (like 1971) they won in seven games, on October 17, 1979. 
During the 1979 championship season, a Pirate player was designated as 
Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave 
Parker), NL Championship Series MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP 
(Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with 
Keith Hernandez of the Cardinals). After three world titles and six division 
titles since 1948 the Galbreaths began listening to offers to sell the 
franchise. Edward J. Lewis of Oxford Development and Edward J. DeBartolo, 
Sr. made a serious offer to purchase the team in early 1981.[12] Both the 
city of New Orleans, Louisiana and Tampa, Florida put packages together 
to attempt to lure the team out of Pittsburgh. After the 1979 World Series, 
the Pirates entered a period of decline, steadily declining until they 
were regarded as the worst team in baseball during the mid-1980s. After 
the Pittsburgh Drug Trials and a league worst finish in 1985, the Galbreath 
family sold the franchise to the Pittsburgh Associates, a consortium of 
area businesses determined to keep the team from relocating.[13] Jim Leyland 
took over as manager in 1986, and under his guidance the Pirates gradually 
climbed out of the cellar. They featured young and exciting players such 
as the "outfield of dreams" Bobby Bonilla, Barry Bonds, and Andy Van Slyke; 
infielders Jay Bell, Steve Buechele, Sid Bream, and José Lind; catcher 
Mike LaValliere, and pitchers Doug Drabek, John Smiley, and Stan Belinda. 
As a rookie in 1982, Johnny Ray played in every game and was named the 
Rookie of the Year by the Sporting News. In 1988, the young team finished 
85–75 and seemed ready to compete for a pennant. However, the 1989 season 
was a major setback, with injuries depleting the squad and leading to a 
fifth-place finish. Among the low points of the season was a game against 
rival Philadelphia Phillies in Philadelphia on June 8, 1989, where the 
Pirates became the first team in major-league history to score 10 runs 
in the first inning and nevertheless lose the game.[14] Pirates broadcaster 
(and former pitcher) Jim Rooker famously vowed that if the team blew the 
lead, he would walk home from Philadelphia—a vow he fulfilled after the 
season while raising money for charity.[15] The Pirates would win the first 
three NL East titles of the 1990s, but failed to advance to the World Series 
each time. In both 1991 and 1992, they lost closely contested League Championship 
Series to the Atlanta Braves. After the 1992 season, the front office set 
out to rebuild the team, giving up several high-payroll players in favor 
of a younger crew. The Pirates were unable to produce a winning season 
until 2013, accumulating a 20-year losing streak – the longest in any of 
the four major professional North American sports leagues.[16] The closest 
the Pirates had come to fielding a winning team during that period was 
the 1997 team, which finished second in the NL Central despite having a 
losing record and a payroll of $9 million. The 1997 team was eliminated 
from playoff contention during the season's final week. In 2012, they finished 
in 4th place with a 79–83 record and were not eliminated until late September. 
The 2013 team became the first Pirates team since 1992 to secure a winning 
season. In 2001, the Pirates opened a new stadium, PNC Park, featuring 
a simple concept and strategic usage of the Pittsburgh skyline.[17] General 
manager Dave Littlefield was installed July 13, 2001, midway through the 
2001 season, and began overhauling the team to comply with owner Kevin 
McClatchy's dictum to drastically reduce the payroll. Enigmatic but talented 
third baseman Aramis Ramírez was traded to the Chicago Cubs in 2003 for 
a fairly minimal return under pressure to dump his $6 million salary for 
2004, and he proceeded to become a star for the Cubs. Brian Giles was one 
of the National League's best hitters for several years, but he and his 
$9 million salary were also traded in 2003 to the San Diego Padres for 
youngsters Óliver Pérez, Jason Bay, and Cory Stewart. Pirate fans found 
this trade much more palatable in the short run, as Pérez led the majors 
in strikeouts per inning and Bay won the Rookie of the Year Award in 2004, 
while Giles put up a subpar season by his standards. After the 2004 season, 
Jason Kendall went to the Oakland Athletics in a cross-exchange of high-salary 
players. Illustrating the Pirates' rebuilding efforts, at the close of 
the 2005 season, the team fielded the youngest roster in baseball, with 
an average age of 26.6 years. During the course of the season, 14 players 
were called up from its Triple-A affiliate. On September 6, manager Lloyd 
McClendon was fired after 5 losing seasons. On October 11, Jim Tracy was 
hired as the new manager. The 2006 season got off to a slow start with 
the Pirates losing their first six games. The Bucs stood at an abysmal 
30–60 mark by the time they hosted the All Star Game at PNC Park. During 
the second half of the season, however, the Pirates made a successful turnaround 
and finished the second half with a 37–35 record. This is the first time 
the Pirates have finished the second half of the season with a winning 
record since 1992. Third baseman Freddy Sanchez won the National League 
batting title for the 2006 season with an average of .344. The 2007 season 
was a year of transition for the Pirates. Robert Nutting replaced McClatchy 
as majority owner, becoming the sixth majority owner in Pirates history. 
On July 6, 2007, Kevin McClatchy announced he was stepping down as the 
Pirates CEO at the end of the 2007 season.[18] On September 7, 2007, Nutting 
fired general manager Dave Littlefield.[19] The Pittsburgh Pirates began 
to shape their organizational management team late in the 2007 season. 
On September 13, Frank Coonelly, chief labor counsel for Major League Baseball, 
was introduced as the team's new president.[20] On September 25, 2007, 
the Pirates announced the hiring of Neal Huntington, formerly a scout in 
the Cleveland Indians organization, as the team's new general manager.[21] 
On October 5, 2007, Jim Tracy was fired by the Pirates, leaving them with 
another search for a manager. Torey Lovullo had originally been named as 
a leading candidate for the position,[22] but his name was gradually replaced 
by others in the minor league ranks, one being Ottawa Lynx manager John 
Russell, who eventually was named the new manager November 5, 2007. He 
had originally been the third base coach under previous manager Lloyd McClendon 
from 2003 to 2005 until he was fired by the previous General Manager Dave 
Littlefield.[23] As the Pirates once again failed to produce a winning 
record, the team began another round of rebuilding. Prior to the trade 
deadline, the Pirates made several deals that sent several accomplished 
veterans to other franchises. On July 26, the Pirates traded left fielder 
Xavier Nady and pitcher Dámaso Marte to the New York Yankees in return 
for José Tábata, Ross Ohlendorf, Dan McCutchen, and Jeff Karstens. Karstens 
began his career with the Pirates at 2–0 and came within 4 outs of pitching 
the first perfect game in franchise history on August 6, 2008.[24] On July 
31, Jason Bay was traded to the Boston Red Sox in a three-team deal that 
sent Manny Ramírez to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Andy LaRoche and Bryan 
Morris to the Pirates from the Dodgers and Brandon Moss and Craig Hansen 
to the Pirates from the Red Sox. On November 24, the Pirates signed Rinku 
Singh and Dinesh Patel as undrafted free agents, making them the first 
Indian citizens to sign a contract with any American professional sports 
team.[25] Both men are pitchers, who were first spotted in the "Million 
Dollar Arm" contest organized in India by J.B. Bernstein earlier in 2008. 
Trading away players for prospects continued in 2009, as the team's only 
2008 All-Star Nate McLouth was traded to the Atlanta Braves for prospects 
Jeff Locke, Charlie Morton and Gorkys Hernández.[26] On June 30, the team 
dealt Nyjer Morgan and Sean Burnett to the Washington Nationals, as well 
as sending utility player Eric Hinske to the New York Yankees. This upset 
some Pirates players, including Adam LaRoche and Jack Wilson, who questioned 
the direction of the team.[27] LaRoche was later traded to the Red Sox 
in exchange for minor leaguers Hunter Strickland and Argenis Díaz.[28] 
On July 29, Wilson was traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for shortstop 
Ronny Cedeño and Minor League players Jeff Clement, Aaron Pribanic, Brett 
Lorin, and Nathan Adcock. The same day, the Pirates traded Sanchez to the 
San Francisco Giants in exchange for Tim Alderson.[29] On September 7, 
the Pittsburgh Pirates were defeated by the Chicago Cubs 4–2. The loss 
was the Pirates' 82nd of the year, and it clinched for them the longest 
streak of consecutive losing seasons in any North American professional 
sport.[16] On November 14, 2010, after a disastrous 2010 season, which 
saw 105 losses, the Pirates hired a new manager in Clint Hurdle. Hurdle 
was a part of the Colorado Rockies 2007 NL Pennant and was the hitting 
coach for the American League Champion Texas Rangers during the 2010 season. 
Although the losing streak would continue for two more seasons, the Pirates 
began to show signs of success. By 2012 it seemed the Pirates were on pace 
to break the streak, but unfortunately a second late season collapse resulted 
in the 20th consecutive losing season. The team had added free agent pitcher 
Francisco Liriano but his arrival to the team was delayed by a broken non-throwing 
arm. The Pirates entered the 2013 MLB All Star Game with a record of 56-37 
and had sent four all stars (Andrew McCutchen, Jason Grilli, Pedro Álvarez, 
and Jeff Locke). The Pirates finished the season 94-68 and clinched a wild 
card berth. They eventually were eliminated by the NL champion St. Louis 
Cardinals. McCutchen received the NL MVP and Pedro Alvarez was tied for 
the NL Leader in home runs. The 2011 season had a promising start, as the 
Pirates were above .500 at the All-Star Break for the first time since 
1992. The Pirates also sent three players to the 2011 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game with the selections of starting pitcher Kevin Correia, closer 
Joel Hanrahan and center fielder Andrew McCutchen.[30] On July 15, and 
again on July 18, the Pirates moved into first place of the NL Central. 
This marked the first two times that the Pirates were in first place this 
late in the season since 1997.[31] The last day they were in first was 
July 25. The Bucs split four games with the Braves on July 25 to July 28. 
After this they lost 10 games in a row and never recovered. Starting in 
late July rumblings of "America's Team" began to surface, with ESPN television 
picking up two of their games for their nightly baseball telecast. The 
Pirates acquired two former all-stars through the trade market during the 
Trade Deadline on July 31: First baseman Derrek Lee from the Orioles and 
outfielder Ryan Ludwick from the Padres.[32] On July 26, a questionable 
call at home plate led to a 19-inning loss against the Atlanta Braves. 
The Pirates then won only one game from that point to August 8, including 
a season-high 10-game losing streak in that span. Despite a promising season, 
with a loss to the St. Louis Cardinals on September 14, 2011, the team 
lost its 82nd game of the season, ensuring a 19-year losing season streak. 
In 2012, the Pirates aggressively pursued and acquired Yankees pitcher 
A. J. Burnett to bolster their starting pitching staff. During the first 
few months of the season, team pitching held up very well, but the offense 
was sluggish. However, the bats began to pick up in June as many of the 
players began to dramatically improve offensively. By the time July hit, 
the Pirates had soared to first place in the NL Central at the All Star 
break – the first time the Bucs entered the break at first place since 
the "Freak Show" team of 1997. Andrew McCutchen would lead the majors in 
batting average and the "Power of Zoltan" (reference to a character scene 
in the movie Dude, Where's My Car?) began to sweep PNC Park and the city 
of Pittsburgh. The Pirates were 63–47 on August 8, but a stunning disintegration 
left the team scuffling down the stretch, effectively eliminating them 
from the NL Central race and the Wild card race. On September 28, the Pirates 
were no-hit by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Homer Bailey; the loss was their 
81st of the season, ensuring their 20th consecutive non-winning season. 
They lost their 82nd game on September 30, clinching their 20th consecutive 
losing season, extending the longest such streak in North American sports 
history. They are also the only Major League Baseball team to be 16 games 
over .500 after ⅔ of the season complete and finish with a losing record. 
The 82nd loss came 4–3 to the Cincinnati Reds at PNC Park on September 
30, with the Reds scoring twice in the ninth inning off of All-Star closer 
Joel Hanrahan. After two consecutive seasons of late season collapses, 
Huntington and Hurdle were determined to be aggressive in free agency, 
adding players and veteran leadership that would stave off another Pittsburgh 
Pirates collapse in 2013. In the offseason, the team agreed with veteran 
catcher Russell Martin on a two-year, $17 million deal. Martin, while providing 
decent offensive numbers, was considered to be a major defensive upgrade 
over the previous year's platoon of Rod Barajas and Michael McKenry. In 
2012, Barajas and McKenry had combined to throw out 19 of 173 baserunners, 
for a caught stealing percentage of 11%, while Russell Martin held a career 
caught stealing percentage of 30.25% entering the 2013 season. On December 
26, 2012, the Pirates traded established closer Joel Hanrahan and infielder 
Brock Holt to the Boston Red Sox for reliever Mark Melancon, and prospects 
Jerry Sands, Iván DeJesús Jr., and Stolmy Pimentel. With this move, the 
Pirates re-signed setup man Jason Grilli to a two-year deal worth $4.5 
million, to become the new Pirates closer. Melancon, who was under-valued 
after a miserable, injury-riddled 2012 season, replaced Grilli as the Pirates 
setup man. The trade wound up leaning strongly in favor of the Pirates, 
as Grilli and Melancon would anchor the so-called "Shark Tank" bullpen 
as one of the best bullpens in MLB as well as both being selected to the 
All-Star Game, while Hanrahan wound up only playing in nine games for the 
Red Sox before suffering an injury to his pitching arm and requiring Tommy 
John surgery just as his contract was getting ready to expire at the end 
of the season.[33] On February 8, 2013, the Pirates finalized a two-year, 
$12.75 million deal with starting pitcher Francisco Liriano.[34] The deal 
had been delayed two months because Liriano had broken his non-throwing 
arm in December 2012, and had refused to take a physical. Though the Pirates 
made no trades before the July 31 deadline, they would make some moves 
to shore up their lineup for a potential playoff run, acquiring Marlon 
Byrd and John Buck from the New York Mets on August 27, 2013[35] and trading 
with the Minnesota Twins for Justin Morneau on August 31, 2013.[36] On 
September 3, 2013, the Pirates defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 4-3 in Milwaukee 
to win their 81st game of the season, clinching their first non-losing 
season since 1992.[37] Then, following a four-game losing streak, the Pirates 
defeated the Texas Rangers 1-0 on September 9 for their 82nd win, clinching 
their first winning season in 21 years.[38] 14 days later, due to a combination 
of a Pirates win and a Nationals' loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, the 
Pirates headed to postseason play for the first time in twenty-one seasons. 
By finishing the season with a three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds, 
their chief competition for the NL Wild Card, the Pirates hosted and won 
their first home playoff game since 1992 in the National League Wild Card 
Game on October 1, 2013 with a score of 6-2.[39] That victory put the Pirates 
into the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
On October 3, 2013, the Cardinals rode a 7-run inning to a 9-1 win over 
the Pirates.[40] The Pirates evened the series with a 7-1 victory on in 
Game 2 on October 4,[41] tying the series heading into Game 3. The Pirates 
then took a 2-1 Series lead by defeating the Cardinals in dramatic fashion 
at PNC Park 5-3 before dropping the remaining two games to the Cardinals 
by scores of 2-1 and 6-1, thereby being eliminated from further post-season 
play. In 2014, the Pirates made the National League Wild Card game but 
lost at home to the eventual World Series champions, the San Francisco 
Giants by a score of 8-0.[42] Brandon Crawford hit a grand slam while the 
Pirates could not recover and were once again denied a playoff series win. 
In 2015, the Pirates finished with the second best record in baseball at 
98-64, however, despite many injuries to key players, the division rival 
St. Louis Cardinals had the best record in baseball at 100-62, winning 
the NL Central division. The 98-win season was good enough to ensure another 
home Wild Card game, this time hosting the 97-win Chicago Cubs. The eventual 
2015 NL Cy Young winner, Jake Arrieta, pitched dominantly for the Cubs,
