The Batavia Muckdogs are a minor league baseball team, the Short-Season 
Class-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins, based in Batavia, a city in Genesee 
County, New York, United States. Their home field is Dwyer Stadium in the 
city of Batavia. With a city population of less than 16,000, Batavia is 
one of the smallest cities to host a professional baseball team in the 
modern United States.[1] The Muckdogs were founded in 1961 as the Batavia 
Pirates. Another PONY (Pennsylvania-Ontario-New York) League franchise 
played in Batavia as the Batavia Clippers from 1939 to 1953 before relocating, 
eventually becoming the Lowell Spinners. Another NY-Penn League franchise 
played in Batavia from 1957 through 1959 as the Batavia Indians before 
ceasing operations. The current franchise was established in 1961 as an 
expansion franchise playing first as the Batavia Pirates until changing 
their name to the Batavia Trojans in 1966 until 1987. From 1988 through 
the 1997 season the team brought back the historic Batavia Clippers name 
before changing to the Muckdogs in 1998 based on a fan poll that chose 
the nickname and logo. Prior to the current Batavia franchise, professional 
baseball in the city dates back 126 years to 1887 when Batavia played in 
the Western New York League along with teams in nearby LeRoy, Perry and 
Warsaw. The Batavia Giants and Geneva Alhambras had a co-op team in the 
Class-C New York State League that also consisted of teams in Canandaigua, 
Cortland, Lyons, Palmyra, and current NYPL rival Auburn. The history of 
the New York–Penn League originated in Batavia as the league, then known 
as the Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League (PONY League), was formed in 
a local hotel that has since been demolished. Original league cities included 
Batavia (now Lowell, MA), Bradford (now defunct), Hamilton (now defunct), 
Niagara Falls (now Hudson Valley), and Olean (now defunct). The Muckdogs 
logo adopted in 1998 is a dog on a crushed fence in the shape of an "M" 
surrounded by muck with baseballs on either side. The team also has an 
alternate logo of a B with a dog. The Muckdogs have three mascots who make 
appearances throughout the season at Dwyer Stadium. The team's original 
mascot Maxwell T. Chomper, who boasts he is semi-retired while the newest 
addition Homer has taken over game to game duties. The team also features 
a third mascot named Slider.[2] As the Muckdogs, Batavia was affiliated 
with the Philadelphia Phillies from 1998, having been already affiliated 
with the Phillies since 1988, through the 2006 season. Beginning with the 
2007 season, the Phillies chose to move their Short-Season A affiliate 
closer to Philadelphia with the Williamsport Crosscutters. Meanwhile, the 
Muckdogs signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. Prior to the Cardinals and 
Phillies affiliation Batavia was also affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1952–53; 1961–65), Detroit Tigers (1968–71), New York Mets (1972–74), 
and Cleveland Indians (1942–51; 1957–59; 1976–86). The team also fielded 
a co-op team in 1966 featuring players from 12 different organizations, 
most notably Cito Gaston of the Atlanta Braves. In 1975, the team fielded 
another co-op team with players from 8 organizations including Don McCormack 
from the Philadelphia Phillies. 1987 was the final co-op team in Batavia. 
After the 2012 season, the St. Louis Cardinals announced they would move 
their affiliation to the State College Spikes, who they had been affiliated 
with before coming to Batavia. On September 28, 2012, the Muckdogs announced 
they had signed a two-year player development contract with the Miami Marlins 
who were affiliated with the Jamestown Jammers from 2002–2011.[3] Jamestown 
signed an affiliation agreement with the Pittsburgh Pirates who had left 
State College.[4] On March 12, 2008, it was announced the Rochester Red 
Wings would take over operational control running concessions, media, community 
relations and promotions. The team had been operated by the Genesee County 
Baseball Club (G.C.B.C) who remain majority owner though the Red Wings 
gain a share of ownership with each season they operate the franchise. 
In 2010, the Red Wings announced an extension of their operations with 
the Muckdogs.[5] In 2016, the Muckdogs announced that the team was up for 
sale, due to financial losses. The Red Wings first attempted to sell the 
franchise to an ownership group that intended to relocate the franchise 
to Waldorf, Maryland beginning in the 2017 season; after all of the existing 
baseball teams with territorial rights over Maryland rejected the move, 
this sale was abandoned.[6] As of the 2015 season Batavia has played 73 
seasons of professional baseball in its current location amassing 3,145 
wins and 3,434 losses (.478). The teams 3,000th win came in form of a 5–3 
decision on June 23, 2012 against the Jamestown Jammers at Russell Diethrick 
Park in Jamestown, New York. Jamestown was the only other city of the league's 
original six remaining in the circuit, although it does not host the same 
franchise. Relief pitcher Jose Almarante earned the win. Ángel Espada was 
named Muckdogs manager for the 2013 seasons and remained in that position 
through the 2015 season. Jack Tighe holds the All-Time record for wins 
in Batavia with a record of 298 wins and 239 losses in four seasons. Dann 
Bilardello holds the modern era (short-season) record with 126 wins and 
99 losses in three seasons. Gene Baker was the first African-American manager 
in affiliated baseball during the 1961 season with the Batavia Pirates.[7] 
The 1986 Batavia Trojans featured a short-season team record of nine future 
Major Leaguers on the roster including Jim Bruske, Tommy Hinzo, Tom Lampkin, 
Troy Neel, Bruce Egloff, Jeff Shaw, Joe Skalski, and Kevin Wickander while 
affiliated with the Cleveland Indians.[8] Batavia has been no-hit 15 times 
and thrown 5 no-hitters, however they are one of only two teams in league 
history who went on to win a game they had been no hit in when they defeated 
Newark 2–0 on August 3, 1973, for a record of 5–13 overall. Batavia was 
also part of the first ever league dual no-hitter where on August 25, 1952 
Jim Mitchell of the Batavia Clippers and Frank Etchberger of the Bradford 
Phillies each no-hit the others team in opposite ends of a double header. 
The Clippers no-hit effort was not without controversy as it was a change 
by the official scorer that gave Mitchell his no-no. The Bradford paper 
reported the ball hit the glove of an outfielder and rolled to the wall 
where Bradford's Tommy Keane was originally given a double, it was then 
changed to an error after the game. On June 24, 2015 three Batavia pitchers 
(Gabriel Castellanos, Brett Lilek, Steven Farnworth) combined for the teams 
first perfect game in history against the Mahoning Valley Scrappers.[9][10] 
In the team's storied history they have made a total of 19 playoff appearances. 
Batavia has won four league championships including 2008 as the Muckdogs, 
1963 season as the Batavia Pirates and the 1945 & 1946 seasons as the Batavia 
Clippers.[11][12] Batavia has won five division championships since the 
league adapted divisional play starting in the 1977 season, these titles 
include the Pinckney Division in 1995, 2008, and 2010, the Stedler in 1998, 
and the Western Division in 1977. The team also made playoff appearances 
as the Wild Card in 1999 and 2000 where they lost in the semi-finals, as 
well as 1997 when they advanced to the league championship where they were 
defeated by the Pittsfield Mets.[13] During the PONY League seasons from 
1939–1956 there was a league champion and playoff champion format; the 
1945 season saw Batavia finish with a record of 84 wins and 40 losses to 
clinch the league championship by nine games over the Jamestown Falcons. 
The Clippers defeated the Bradford Blue Wings three games to one in the 
first round of the playoffs before defeating the Lockport White Sox four 
games to three in the playoff championship. Batavia had a league best 1.40 
ERA during the season.[14] The 1946 season saw Batavia and Jamestown finish 
tied with a record of 84 wins and 41 losses to claim a share of the league 
championship. Jamestown defeated Batavia in a one-game playoff by a score 
of 6–2. Batavia then defeated the Olean Oilers in the playoffs four games 
to three before defeating Jamestown four games to two in the championship. 
Batavia's Dick Kokos lead the league during the 1946 season in runs with 
118, hits with 166, RBIs with 114, and tied for home runs with 21.[14] 
The 1963 Batavia Pirates were an unlikely Championship team that entered 
the playoffs with 42 wins and 67 losses during the regular season. Facing 
the Jamestown Tigers in the best of three series the Pirates opened with 
a home loss by the score of 4–3 before heading to Jamestown to defeat the 
Tigers by a score of 2–1. During game two pitchers Bob Lee and Bob Baird 
shut down Jamestown as Fred Michalski hit a home run early and Norm Housley 
drove in a run in the seventh that gave Batavia all the runs the pitching 
due would need, the Tigers scored their loan run in the bottom of the seventh. 
In the series finale the Pirates won handily by the score of 7–3 before 
a home crowd of 1,305 at MacArthur Stadium. Byron Brown, who led the league 
with 32 home runs in the regular season, hit a two run home run in the 
first inning and then drove in two more with a single in the fourth. Lefty 
Ron Fiorella was the winning pitcher for the Pirates while Jim Hassett 
also hit a home run during the deciding game. Leading the Pirates for the 
playoffs was José Martínez with 8 hits as Fiorella picked up two wins.[15] 
In 1957 the PONY League adapted the name the New–York Pennsylvania League 
and continued to do a league champion and playoff champion until 1974 when 
it was changed to a first half and second half champion until the 1976 
season. During the 1977 season the league did a first half and second half 
champion within two divisions instead of a league format, Batavia won the 
Western Division in both halves.[16] The following season, 1978, the league 
changed to solely one season division format.[17] Batavia won the Stedler 
Division with a record of 41 wins and 34 losses under manager Al LeBoeuf 
before losing in the semifinals to eventual champion the Watertown Indians.

Staten Island Yankees. The packed house saw local Rochester native Cito 
Culver score 2 runs for the Yankees and also bat another run in. The official 
attendance was 2,445. As teams move to larger markets, and western New 
York area residency dwindling, the Muckdogs find themselves ranking last 
in attendance,[20] though in 2008 a new policy was put forth by the Red 
Wings management to only report through the gate fans and not add on like 
several teams do to pad attendance records. Pitchers Catchers Infielders
