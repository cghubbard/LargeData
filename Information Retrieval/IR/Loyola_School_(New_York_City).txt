Loyola School is a independent Jesuit high school on the Upper East Side 
of New York City, founded in 1900 by the Society of Jesus. Originally a 
Roman Catholic boys school, Loyola became coeducational in 1973, becoming 
the only Jesuit co-ed college preparatory high school in the Tri-State 
Region.[1] With a student enrollment of two hundred, the average class 
size of fifteen students promotes personal attention and individual participation. 
Loyola education fosters lifelong learning and aims to produce graduates 
who are academically excellent, open to growth, religious, loving, and 
committed to doing justice in service to others. The school is located 
two city blocks east of Central Park and Museum Mile on 83rd Street and 
Park Avenue in Manhattan. St. Ignatius Church is in the same complex and 
is used for various school functions. The church is listed as a NYC landmark 
and the complex is listed as a National Historic Place. St. Ignatius Loyola 
School is an elementary school that also shares the complex[2][3] but there 
is no official link between the schools. The Rev. Robert Fulton, S.J., 
(1826–1895), eleventh pastor (from 1880) of St. Lawrence O'Toole (the original 
parish name of St. Ignatius Loyola), purchased the northwest corner of 
Park Avenue and 83rd Street (in the Yorkville neighborhood) adjacent to 
his church. The purchase price was $7,500.00. Upon the church's rebuilding 
and re-dedication, the Society of Jesus strengthened their ties to this 
parish by founding the school, which was encouraged by the Dominicans at 
St. Vincent Ferrer and the Paulist Fathers at St. Paul the Apostle. Ground 
was broken for the new school in February 1899. The school opened to students 
in October 1900 with classes held in the nearby priests' residence. After 
various building material strikes delayed completion, the six-story Renaissance 
Revival style steel-framed school opened on December 17, 1900,[4] and was 
formally dedicated by Michael A. Corrigan, Archbishop of New York, on February 
11, 1901.[5] The New York Herald reviewed the new "Early Renaissance Type" 
building, reporting that "the building cost about $125,000; and the property, 
taken with the lot on which it is located, represents an expenditure of 
over $200,000. The exterior of the building is constructed entirely of 
Ohio sandstone, with cornices, and a flambeau with coat of arms just over 
the entrance.... It is of the most advanced fireproof construction.... 
Altogether the building represents the highest degree of architectural 
excellence as applied to schools."[6] The Latin inscription on the first 
floor chapel bow's blind window panel (with segmental pediment) of the 
Park Avenue facade reads "SANCT IGNATIO / DE LOYOLA / PATRI LEGIFERO / 
SOCIETATIS JESV / QVI VBICVMQVE / GENTIVM / IN SPEM RELLIGIONIS / ET CIVITATIS 
/ ADOLESCENTES MORBIBUS / ET BONIS ARTIBVS / IMBVIT / AEDES HAE / DEDICANTVR" 
which translates: "To Saint Ignatius Loyola / Founder of the Society of 
Jesus / who for the good of Church and State / everywhere / has stored 
the minds of youth / with virtue and learning / these buildings are dedicated."[7] 
The chapel was decorated by Brother Francis C. Schroen, S.J., (1857–1924), 
who had previously been a designer at the Jesuit Georgetown University. 
The stained glass was by Louis C. Tiffany and above Schroen's white marble 
altar was a canopied statue of Our Lady of Lourdes by the New York-sculptor 
Joseph Sibbel.[8] The six-story gymnasium and rectory on 43–63 E 83rd Street 
was built 1953 to designs by architects Eggers & Higgins of 100 E 42nd 
Street, New York City, at a reported cost of $800,000. The five-story extension 
(1954) at 39–41 E 83rd Street was completed by the same architects at a 
reported cost of $290,000.[9] Following Dr. Ross's appointment, the title 
of "headmaster" was retired and replaced with that of "principal."[18]
