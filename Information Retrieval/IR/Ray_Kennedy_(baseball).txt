Raymond Lincoln Kennedy (May 19, 1895 – January 18, 1969) was an American 
professional baseball player, scout and front office executive. He was 
born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Kennedy's professional playing career 
came almost exclusively at the minor league level.[1] A catcher and second 
baseman, he played from 1915 to 1917 and in 1919–27, largely in the original 
Sally League.[1] He made one appearance as a player in Major League Baseball 
as a pinch hitter for the 1916 St. Louis Browns on September 8, and went 
hitless in his only at bat against the Detroit Tigers.[2] He had spent 
most of that season in the Class D Illinois State League.[1] Kennedy was 
the first person to hold the title of general manager in the history of 
the Pittsburgh Pirates, spending one season, 1946, in the post.[3][4] He 
had been hired from the New York Yankees organization, where he had previously 
been secretary and business manager of the Newark Bears, one of the Bombers' 
two top-level farm clubs. However, the Bucs were in the process of being 
sold after 46 years of ownership by the Barney Dreyfuss family. On August 
8, 1946, the team was purchased by a consortium led by Indianapolis businessman 
Frank McKinney, Columbus, Ohio-based real estate developer John W. Galbreath, 
Pittsburgh attorney Thomas Johnson, and entertainer Bing Crosby. The Pirates' 
new owners brought in their own general manager at the end of the season: 
Roy Hamey, who had been president of the Triple-A American Association. 
Ironically, Hamey had previously been Kennedy's peer as the business manager 
of the Yankees' other top farm team, the Kansas City Blues. In the front-office 
transition that followed, Kennedy remained with the Pirates as director 
of minor league clubs from 1947 to 1948. In 1949, Kennedy became minor 
league director of the Detroit Tigers, serving through 1951.[5] In 1955, 
Kennedy was player personnel director of the Kansas City Athletics[6] and 
was working as a scout for the New York Mets at the time of his death,
