The United Shore Professional Baseball League (USPBL) is an independent 
baseball league started in May of 2016.[1] Each team in the USPBL will 
play a full 50-game regular season schedule from May through September, 
with an all-star game and championship game at the conclusion of the regular 
season.[2] The United Shore Professional Baseball League was founded by 
Andy Appleby, a former senior vice president of the Detroit Pistons and 
Palace Sports and Entertainment. The league has three teams based in Metro 
Detroit, with all games being played at Jimmy John's Field in Utica, Michigan.[3] 
The $12 million ballpark has seating for 4,000 and was built on capped 
brownfield that previously served as an unlicensed dump for household waste.[4] 
The league is aimed at 18–25 year olds who either went undrafted out of 
college, or who have been released from prior minor league contracts. The 
pay is expected to range from $600–$800 per month with housing provided 
by host families.[5] It is meant to give players recently graduated from 
college or with limited minor league experience a chance to stay in baseball 
shape and give them an opportunity to be signed to contracts with MLB affiliated 
minor league teams. All league revenue comes primarily from sponsorship 
partners and other advertisements, ticket sales and ballpark concessions. 
The Utica Unicorns won the initial league championship with a 5–0 win over
