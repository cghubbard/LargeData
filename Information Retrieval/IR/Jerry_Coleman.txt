As player As manager Gerald Francis "Jerry" Coleman (September 14, 1924 
– January 5, 2014) was a Major League Baseball (MLB) second baseman for 
the New York Yankees and manager of the San Diego Padres for one year. 
Coleman was named the rookie of the year in 1949 by Associated Press, and 
was an All-Star in 1950 and later that year was named the World Series 
most valuable player. Yankees teams on which he was a player appeared in 
six World Series during his career, winning four times. Coleman served 
as a Marine Corps pilot in WW II and the Korean War, flying combat missions 
with the VMSB-341 Torrid Turtles (WWII) and VMA-323 Death Rattlers (Korea) 
in both wars.[1] He later became a broadcaster, and he was honored in 2005 
by the National Baseball Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick Award for 
his broadcasting contributions.[2] Born in San Jose, California, Coleman 
graduated from Lowell High School,[3] then spent his entire playing career 
with the New York Yankees. He played six years in the Yankees' minor league 
system before reaching the big club in 1949. Coleman hit .275 in his first 
year and led all second basemen in fielding percentage. He was the Associated 
Press' rookie of the year in 1949, and finishing third in balloting by 
Baseball Writers Association of America.[4] Coleman avoided a sophomore 
jinx by earning a selection to the All-Star team in 1950. He then shined 
in the World Series with brilliant defense, earning him the BBWAA's Babe 
Ruth Award as the series's most valuable player.[4] Nicknamed "The Colonel", 
because he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel,[5] Coleman 
was a Marine aviator who postponed his entry into professional baseball 
in World War II and later left baseball to serve in the Korean War. While 
a Marine Corps aviator he flew 120 combat missions (57 during WWII and 
63 in Korea).[1][2] and received numerous honors and medals including two 
Distinguished Flying Crosses.[6] In recent years Coleman received numerous 
honors; including, being inducted into the USMC Sports Hall of Fame,[7] 
for his call to duty. Coleman was the only Major League Baseball player 
to have seen combat in two wars. (While Ted Williams served during both 
WWII and Korea, he flew combat missions only in the Korean war.) [8][9][10] 
Coleman's career declined after he was injured the following season, relegating 
him to a bench role. He was forced to retire after the 1957 season, but 
he left on a good note, hitting .364 in a World Series loss against the 
Milwaukee Braves. He appeared in the World Series six times in his career, 
winning four of them.[11] In 1958, New York Yankees general manager George 
Weiss named Coleman personnel director, which involved Coleman scouting 
minor league players. Roy Hamey terminated Coleman from that position, 
when Harney became the Yankees' general manager.[12] It was only after 
Coleman met with Howard Cosell that Coleman considered becoming a broadcaster.[12] 
In 1960, Coleman began a broadcasting career with CBS television, conducting 
pregame interviews on the network's Game of the Week broadcasts. His broadcasting 
career nearly ended that year; he was in the midst of an interview with 
Cookie Lavagetto when the national anthem began playing. Coleman kept the 
interview going through the anthem, prompting an avalanche of angry letters 
to CBS.[13] In 1963 he began a seven-year run calling Yankees' games on 
WCBS radio and WPIX television. Coleman's WPIX call of ex-teammate Mickey 
Mantle's 500th career home run in 1967 was brief and from the heart: During 
his time broadcasting with the Yankees he lived in Ridgewood, New Jersey, 
which he described as being "19.9 miles from Yankee Stadium, but a million 
miles from New York".[14] After broadcasting for the California Angels 
for two years, in 1972 Coleman became the lead radio announcer for the 
San Diego Padres, a position he held every year until his death in 2014 
except for 1980, when the Padres hired him to manage (predating a trend 
of broadcasters-turned-managers that started in the late 1990s).[15] He 
was known in San Diego for his signature catchphrase, "You can hang a star 
on that one, baby!", which he would deliver after a spectacular play.[16] 
During home games, the phrase would be accompanied by a tinsel star swinging 
from a fishing pole that emanated from his broadcast booth.[17] Coleman's 
other catchphrases included "Oh Doctor!", "And the beat goes on," and "The 
natives are getting restless."[18] He also called national regular-season 
and postseason broadcasts for CBS Radio from the mid-1970s to 1997.[19] 
During an interview in the height of the steroids scandal in 2005, Coleman 
stated, "If I'm emperor, the first time 50 games, the second time 100 games 
and the third strike you're out",[this quote needs a citation] referring 
to how baseball should suspend players for being caught taking steroids. 
After the 2005 World Series, Major League Baseball put a similar policy 
in effect. Coleman was known as the "Master of the Malaprop" for making 
sometimes embarrassing mistakes on the microphone,[20] but he was nonetheless 
popular. In 2005, he was given the Ford C. Frick Award of the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame for broadcasting excellence, and is one of five Frick 
award winners who also played in the Major Leagues (the others are Joe 
Garagiola, Tony Kubek, Tim McCarver and Bob Uecker).[21] He was inducted 
into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 2001.[22] In fall 2007, Coleman 
was inducted to the National Radio Hall of Fame as a sports broadcaster 
for his years as the play-by-play voice of the San Diego Padres.[2] Ted 
Leitner and Andy Masur replaced Coleman for most of the radio broadcasting 
efforts for each Padres game. He did, however, still work middle innings 
as a color analyst. As of the 2010 season, he reduced his broadcast schedule 
down to 20–30 home day games.[23] As of November 2010[update], Coleman 
was the third-oldest active play-by-play announcer, behind only fellow 
Hall of Famers Felo Ramirez and Ralph Kiner.[24] Coleman collaborated on 
his autobiography with longtime New York Times writer Richard Goldstein; 
their book An American Journey: My Life on the Field, In the Air, and On 
the Air was published in 2008. On September 15, 2012, the Padres unveiled 
a Jerry Coleman statue at Petco Park.[25] Coleman's statue is the second 
statue at Petco Park, the other being of Hall of Fame outfielder Tony Gwynn.[12] 
Coleman was the recipient of the following medals:[26] In 2011, Coleman 
was inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame in a ceremony 
at the San Diego Air & Space Museum for his service as a combat pilot in 
WW2 and the Korean Conflict.[27] Although several Major League ballplayers 
flew during WW2, he was the only active member of MLB to do the deed twice, 
forgoing his career to fly in combat in both conflicts.[28] The SDASM restored 
a vintage F4U "Corsair" fighter-bomber in the markings of Coleman's aircraft 
during the Korean Conflict and it is displayed under their SBD "Dauntless" 
dive bomber (which Coleman flew in combat during WW2).[29] Coleman's death 
was reported by the San Diego Padres on January 5, 2014. He died after 
being hospitalized after a fall in his home.[30] He was 89.[2] Coleman 
was interred at Miramar National Cemetery after a private funeral.[31] 
In 2015, a sports facility at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego was
