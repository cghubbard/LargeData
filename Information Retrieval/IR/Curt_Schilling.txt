Curtis Montague "Curt" Schilling (born November 14, 1966) is an American 
former Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher, former video game developer, 
and former baseball color analyst. He helped lead the Philadelphia Phillies 
to the World Series in 1993, and won championships in 2001 with the Arizona 
Diamondbacks and in 2004 and 2007 with the Boston Red Sox. Schilling retired 
with a career postseason record of 11–2, and his .846 postseason winning 
percentage is a major-league record among pitchers with at least ten decisions.[1] 
He is a member of the 3,000-strikeout club and has the highest strikeout-to-walk 
ratio of any of its members. He is tied for third for the most 300-strikeout 
seasons.[2] Of post 19th century pitchers, Schilling has the second highest 
JAWS of any pitcher not in the Hall of Fame (behind only Roger Clemens).[3] 
After retiring, he founded Green Monster Games, which was renamed 38 Studios. 
The company released Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning in February 2012, but 
just three months later, Schilling laid off his entire staff amid severe 
financial troubles. Schilling has been signed by the Howie Carr radio network 
to do a Saturday morning politics and sports show, 9 am to noon Eastern 
and is heard online at curtschillingshow.com[4] Schilling has filled in 
for Howie Carr. Schilling graduated from Shadow Mountain High School in 
Phoenix, Arizona, in 1985, before attending Yavapai College in Prescott, 
Arizona.[5] Schilling began his professional career in the Red Sox farm 
system as a second-round pick in what would be the final January draft 
in MLB. He began his professional career with the Elmira Pioneers, then 
a Red Sox affiliate. After two and a half years in the minor leagues, he 
and Brady Anderson were traded to the Baltimore Orioles in 1988 for Mike 
Boddicker. He debuted in the Major League with the Orioles (1988–1990), 
and then spent one year with the Houston Astros (1991). During the Phillies' 
pennant run in 1993, Schilling went 16–7 with a 4.02 ERA and 186 strikeouts. 
Schilling led the Phillies to an upset against the two-time defending National 
League champion Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship Series. 
Although he received no decisions during his two appearances in the six-game 
series, Schilling's 1.69 ERA and 19 strikeouts (including the first 5 Braves 
hitters of Game 1, an NLCS record) were enough to earn him the 1993 NLCS 
Most Valuable Player Award. The Phillies went on to face the defending 
world champion Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series. After losing Game 
1, he pitched brilliantly in his next start. With the Phillies facing elimination 
the day after losing a bizarre 15–14 contest at home in Veterans Stadium, 
Schilling pitched a five-hit shutout that the Phillies won, 2–0. Schilling 
was named to the NL All-Star team in 1997, 1998 and 1999 and started the 
1999 game. In 1997, he finished 14th in NL MVP voting and fourth in NL 
Cy Young voting. Unhappy with the team's performance, he requested a trade 
to a contender in 2000 and was subsequently dealt to the Arizona Diamondbacks.[6] 
His 101 career victories ranks sixth all-time for Phillies pitchers, 20th 
in ERA (3.35), 23rd in games appeared in (242), sixth in games started 
(226), 34th in complete games (61), 13th in shutouts (14), fourth in strikeouts 
(1554), and eighth in innings pitched (1659.1).[7] Schilling was traded 
to the Diamondbacks on July 26, 2000, for first baseman Travis Lee and 
pitchers Vicente Padilla, Omar Daal, and Nelson Figueroa.[8] With Arizona, 
he went 22–6 with a 2.98 ERA in 2001, leading the majors in wins and innings 
pitched. He also went 4–0 with a 1.12 ERA in the playoffs. In the 2001 
World Series, the Diamondbacks beat the New York Yankees in seven games. 
Schilling shared the 2001 World Series MVP Award with teammate Randy Johnson. 
He and Johnson also shared Sports Illustrated magazine's 2001 "Sportsmen 
of the Year" award. During the World Series Schilling received two other 
honors, as he was presented that year's Roberto Clemente and Branch Rickey 
Awards, the first Arizona Diamondback so honored for either award. In 2002, 
he went 23–7 with a 3.23 ERA. He struck out 316 batters while walking 33 
in 259.1 innings. On April 7, 2002, Schilling threw a one-hit shutout striking 
out 17 against the Milwaukee Brewers. Both years he finished second in 
the Cy Young Award voting to Johnson. Schilling finished the 2003 season 
with an 8–9 record and a 2.95 ERA in 168 innings while striking out 194 
batters. In November 2003, the Diamondbacks traded Schilling to the Boston 
Red Sox in exchange for Jorge de la Rosa, Casey Fossum, Mike Goss, and 
Brandon Lyon. The trade to Boston reunited Schilling with Terry Francona, 
his manager during his final four years with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
On September 16, 2004, Schilling won his 20th game of 2004 for the Red 
Sox, becoming the fifth Boston pitcher to win 20 or more games in his first 
season with the team, and the first since Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley 
in 1978. Schilling ended his regular season with a 21–6 record. On October 
19, 2004, Schilling won Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship 
Series against the New York Yankees. Notably, he won this game playing 
on an injured ankle—the same injuries that contributed to his disastrous 
outing in Game 1 of the ALCS. These injuries were so acute that by the 
end of his Game 6 performance, his white sock was soaked with blood, which 
is now referred to as "the bloody sock". The win forced a Game 7, the Red 
Sox would go on to win game 7 and the ALCS and make their first World Series 
appearance since 1986. Schilling pitched (and won) Game 2 of the 2004 World 
Series for the Red Sox against the St. Louis Cardinals. In both series, 
he had to have the tendon in his right ankle stabilized repeatedly, in 
what has become known as the Schilling Tendon Procedure, after the tendon 
sheath was torn during his Game 1 ALDS appearance against the Anaheim Angels. 
As in Game 6 of the ALCS, Schilling's sock was soaked with blood from the 
sutures used in this medical procedure, but he still managed to pitch seven 
strong innings, giving up one run on four hits and striking out four. This 
second bloody sock was placed in the Baseball Hall of Fame after Boston's 
victory over St. Louis in the World Series. A four-game sweep of the World 
Series erased the Curse of the Bambino. On February 23, 2013, the first 
bloody sock was sold at a live auction at the Fletcher-Sinclair Mansion 
for $92,613 to an anonymous bidder.[9] Schilling was once again runner-up 
in Cy Young voting in 2004, this time to Minnesota Twins hurler Johan Santana, 
who was a unanimous selection, receiving all 28 first-place votes. Schilling 
received 27 of the 28 second-place votes. Later, the entire Red Sox team 
was named Sports Illustrated's 2004 Sportsmen of the Year, making Schilling 
only the second person to have won or shared that award twice. Schilling 
began 2005 on the disabled list due to recurrent ankle injuries. He returned 
in July as Boston's closer. He eventually returned to the starting rotation 
and continued to struggle. The Red Sox made it to the playoffs, but were 
swept by the Chicago White Sox in three games. For the 2006 season, Schilling 
was said to be healthy. He began the season 4–0 with a 1.61 ERA. He finished 
the year with a 15–7 record and 198 strikeouts, with a respectable 3.97 
ERA. On May 27, he earned his 200th career win, the 104th major league 
pitcher to accomplish the feat.[10] On August 30, Schilling collected his 
3,000th strikeout. Schilling has the highest ratio of strikeouts to walks 
of any pitcher with at least 3,000 strikeouts, and is one of four pitchers 
to reach the 3,000-K milestone before reaching 1,000 career walks. The 
other three who accomplished this feat are Fergie Jenkins, Greg Maddux, 
and former Boston Red Sox ace and teammate Pedro Martínez.[citation needed][11] 
In January 2007, Schilling announced on the Dennis and Callahan show that 
after talking with his family, he had changed his mind and did not want 
to retire at the conclusion of the 2007 season.[12] He sought to negotiate 
an extension to his current contract, but Red Sox executives announced 
that they would not negotiate with him until after the season citing Schilling's 
age and physical condition as factors in their decision.[13][14] Schilling 
went on to say he would become a free agent at the end of the season, for 
the first time in his career, and would not negotiate with the Red Sox 
during the 15 days after the end of the World Series when the team has 
exclusive negotiating rights with potential free agents.[15] On a June 
appearance on the Dennis and Callahan Show, Schilling stated he would accept 
a one-year extension to his contract at his current salary if the Red Sox 
offered it to him. Questioned on his statement, Schilling said, "I said 
I wouldn't negotiate a deal during the season, and I'm saying that now. 
But I would accept that offer."[16] On June 7, 2007, Schilling came within 
one out of his first career no-hitter. Schilling gave up a two-out single 
to Oakland's Shannon Stewart, who lined a 95-mph fastball to right field 
for the A's only hit.[17] Schilling followed up his one-hitter with two 
poor starts and was sent back to Boston on June 20 for an MRI on his shoulder 
and was placed on the disabled list. He returned from the disabled list 
on August 6, pitching at least six innings in each of his nine starts following 
the All-Star break. Schilling continued his career postseason success in 
2007, throwing seven shutout innings in a 9–1 victory over the Angels in 
the ALDS, wrapping up a three-game sweep for Boston.[18] However, he did 
not fare as well pitching in Game 2 of the ALCS against Cleveland, surrendering 
nine hits—two of them home runs—and five earned runs in just 4 2⁄3 innings. 
He did start again in the sixth game of the series, pitching seven complete 
innings during which he recorded five strikeouts, surrendering no walks 
with only two earned runs to gain the victory and force a Game 7. He earned 
his third win of the 2007 playoffs in Game 2 of the 2007 World Series leaving 
after 5 1⁄3 innings, striking out four while allowing only four hits. With 
this win, he became only the second pitcher over the age of 40 to start 
and win a World Series game (Kenny Rogers became the first just one year 
prior). As Schilling departed in the 6th inning, fans at Fenway Park gave 
Schilling a standing ovation. Schilling filed for free agency on October 
30, 2007. He said he would seek a one-year deal, and according to ESPN 
First Take and his own blog page 38 Pitches. Schilling later signed a one-year 
deal with the Boston Red Sox for the 2008 season.[19] Schilling missed 
all of the 2008 season because of a shoulder injury. The injury was first 
revealed in February 2008 and the treatment options became a point of contention 
between Schilling and the Red Sox management.[20] On March 13, 2008, the 
Red Sox placed Schilling on the 60-day disabled list as he continued to 
rehabilitate his right shoulder.[21] On June 18, 2008, Curt Schilling left 
the team to be reevaluated after suffering pain when throwing off the mound.[22] 
On June 20, 2008 Schilling stated on WEEI's Dennis and Callahan show that 
he would undergo season-ending surgery and that he had possibly thrown 
the last pitch of his career.[23] On June 23, 2008, Schilling underwent 
biceps tenodesis surgery, during which a small undersurface tear on the 
rotator cuff was discovered and stitched, and a separation of the labrum 
was repaired. According to his surgeon, he could begin throwing in four 
months.[24] On March 23, 2009, Schilling officially announced his retirement 
from professional baseball after 20 seasons. Schilling ended his career 
with a 216–146 record, 3.46 ERA and 3116 strikeouts, 15th-most in MLB history.[25][26] 
Having last pitched in 2007, Schilling became eligible for the 2013 Baseball 
Hall of Fame ballot, but he did not receive sufficient votes for election. 
On August 2, 2013, Schilling was inducted into the Philadelphia Phillies 
Wall of Fame.[27] During the prime of his career, Schilling was capable 
of reaching and sustaining speeds of 94–98 mph on his four-seam fastball. 
Throughout his career, he was characterized by a determination to go deep 
into ballgames, routinely pitching past the sixth and seventh innings. 
He combined his endurance with pinpoint control, especially on his fastball. 
Schilling's "out" pitch was a split-finger fastball, which he generally 
located beneath the strike zone (resulting in many swinging strikeouts). 
He also possessed an above-average changeup, a decent slider, and mixed 
in an occasional curveball, though he mainly alternated between his fastball 
and splitter. Though his velocity decreased in later years (to the 89–93 
range on his fastball), his control remained excellent, and he is currently 
third in career strikeout to walk ratio.[28] Schilling considers his family's 
native Pittsburgh metro area to be home and is a fan of the Pittsburgh 
Steelers.[29][30] Until 2013, Schilling lived in Medfield, Massachusetts, 
in Drew Bledsoe's former home.[31] In late 2013, Schilling's 8,000 square 
foot home in Massachusetts was put on the market with a listing price of 
$3 million. Various personal belongings, including a golf cart, were also 
listed for sale.[32] Schilling is one of just 11 players born in the state 
of Alaska to play Major League Baseball.[33] He is married to Shonda Schilling. 
They have four children: Gehrig (born 1995),[34] Gabriella (born 1997), 
Grant (born 1999), and Garrison (born 2002). Schilling is a born-again 
Christian.[35] On February 5, 2014, Schilling revealed that he had been 
diagnosed with and was being treated for throat cancer. His statement: 
"I've always believed life is about embracing the gifts and rising up to 
meet the challenges. We've been presented with another challenge, as I've 
recently been diagnosed with cancer."[36] On June 25 of that year, Schilling 
announced via Twitter that the cancer was in remission.[37][38] On August 
20, 2014 Schilling announced he was in remission from his battle with oral 
cancer. That same day, he mentioned his cancer was as a result of using 
smokeless tobacco for 30 years.[39] He also used his experiences to warn 
Madison Bumgarner, who is also a long-time smokeless tobacco user (a 'dipper').[40] 
Schilling campaigned for President George W. Bush in 2004, while certain 
members of the ownership of the Red Sox campaigned for the challenger, 
Senator John F. Kerry (D). Schilling said he was encouraged to run for 
Kerry's seat in the U.S. Senate in 2008 as a Republican.[41] However, Schilling 
was quoted in The Boston Globe as saying that he intended to pitch in 2008, 
which would preclude a Senate run.[42] He was called to Capitol Hill to 
testify about steroid use in March 2005, not as a suspected user but rather 
as a vocal opponent. He has said that Jose Canseco's statistics should 
be thrown out due to his admitted use of steroids, and has also said that 
unless he can refute allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs, 
Roger Clemens should be stripped of the four Cy Young Awards he has won 
since 1997.[43] On January 29, 2007, Schilling announced in an interview 
that he would support Sen. John McCain, who became the Republican nominee 
in the 2008 presidential election. In the same interview, he criticized 
then-presidential candidate and Senator Hillary Clinton (D) for her comments 
criticizing the war in Iraq.[44] Schilling also turned up on the campaign 
trail several times stumping for McCain.[45] Schilling was mentioned as 
a possible candidate for U.S. Senate in the special election in Massachusetts 
for the seat left vacant by the deceased Senator Ted Kennedy.[46] However, 
he ruled out a run during his September 24, 2009, appearance on Dennis 
and Callahan, a popular Boston sports radio talk show.[47] In 2009, Schilling 
endorsed Scott Brown for the seat. During the campaign, Martha Coakley, 
the Democratic candidate, referred to Schilling as a Yankee fan.[48] Coakley 
was ridiculed for the comment; critics said it showed she was out of touch 
with the Boston community.[49] Schilling joked about the incident: "I've 
been called a lot of things...But never, and I mean never, could anyone 
ever make the mistake of calling me a Yankee fan. Well, check that, if 
you didn't know what the hell is going on in your own state, maybe you 
could."[50] In a Fox News interview on January 18, 2010, Schilling was 
asked about his own political ambitions. He said that it was not time.[51] 
Schilling is also an opponent of same-sex marriage, but believes that each 
state should decide the issue. Schilling supports Donald Trump in the 2016 
presidential election [52] Schilling has announced that he will challenge 
Senator Elizabeth Warren in the 2018 US Senate election in Massachusetts.[53] 
Schilling has also expressed interest in running for President either in 
2020 if Hillary Clinton is elected in 2016 or in 2024 if Donald Trump is 
elected in 2016 and 2020.[54] Schilling is a supporter of care for amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) sufferers. His organization, Curt's Pitch for ALS, 
allows fans and organizations to sponsor him, donating to the ALS Association 
for every strikeout he throws. He also donated to the charity his $25,000 
winnings in a celebrity version of Jeopardy! that originally aired on November 
9, 2006. In the 2004 playoffs, after the operation on his ankle, Schilling 
wrote "K ALS" (short for "strike out ALS") on his shoe, knowing that the 
cameras would be focusing on his foot numerous times while he was pitching. 
He also does a weekly radio show with WEEI-FM in Boston that raises over 
$100,000 each year for ALS patients and research. Schilling is known for 
being outspoken, and this has resulted in several conflicts with fellow 
players. Schilling was publicly criticized by Phillies teammates Mitch 
Williams, Larry Andersen, and Danny Jackson for his conduct during the 
1993 World Series. Whenever Mitch Williams (a hard-throwing closer with 
a penchant for unpredictability and erratic control) was on the mound, 
CBS television cameras caught Schilling in the dugout hiding his face with 
a towel. Although Schilling said he was nervous in the heat of the World 
Series, others accused him of purposely trying to get more face time on 
television. Schilling has also directed comments toward Yankees third baseman 
Alex Rodriguez, once calling Rodríguez's swat of a tag in game six of the 
ALCS a "bush-league play" on The Jim Rome Show.[55] During a radio show 
appearance on May 8, 2007, Schilling criticized Barry Bonds, stating: "He 
admitted to cheating on his wife, cheating on his taxes and cheating on 
the game." Soon after, Schilling issued an apology on his blog, stating 
"it was absolutely irresponsible and wrong to say what I did,"[56][57] 
without, however, indicating his opinion on the statements' veracity. After 
the 2008 season, Schilling released a blog post blasting former-Red Sox 
teammate Manny Ramirez' departure from the team.[58] While with the Phillies, 
Schilling was a vocal critic of team management, stopping just short of 
calling the front office incompetent. During a game as a Diamondback in 
2003, he damaged a QuesTec camera with a bat. According to Schilling, the 
umpire behind the plate had said "I can't call that pitch a strike, the 
machine won't let me." This led to a fine and a public exchange of insults 
with Major League Baseball executive Sandy Alderson who accused Schilling 
of whining and wanting balls to be called strikes. In response Schilling 
said Alderson was "ignorant to the facts and ignorant about what I said."[59] 
Schilling has a longstanding feud with ESPN and former Arizona Republic 
reporter Pedro Gomez, initially over an article he wrote concerning manager 
Buck Showalter. Gomez then published a column critical of Schilling, the 
same day Schilling was pitching in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series. In 
his column, Gomez stated, "During the past few days, the country ... has 
discovered Schilling's little secret, the one baseball insiders have known 
for years but has rarely surfaced into the mainstream. Schilling is something 
of a con man, someone more intent on polishing his personal image through 
whatever means possible." He is also quoted later as saying Schilling was 
"the consummate table for one." A year later he further incensed Schilling 
by stating that the friendship between Schilling and teammate Randy Johnson 
"was merely cosmetic." In interviews in October 2004[60][61] and February 
2006,[62][63] Schilling said about Gomez: There are a lot of [bad people] 
in that industry, Pedro Gomez, Joel Heyman, to name a few. People with 
so little skill in their profession that they need to speculate, make up, 
fabricate, to write something interesting enough to be printed. What makes 
them bad people? I am sure I cannot nail the exact reason, but I know some. 
Jealousy, bitterness, the need to be 'different,' I am sure there are others, 
but those are the ones I know off hand ... You just kind of have to realize 
that there are people that don't like you and, unfortunately, sometimes 
those people have a voice, disliking me probably matches my dislike for 
him (Gomez), but I have a problem with people who don't have integrity 
and principle, so that stuff happens. You just kind of just have to let 
it go. In 2007, Schilling engaged in another war of words with a writer, 
this time with Boston Globe sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy. Shaughnessy 
in his column and during television appearances has criticized Schilling 
for the condition he showed up in for spring training, referred to him 
as "the Big Blowhard"[64] and mocked Schilling's blog and radio appearances.[65][66] 
Schilling has responded by using the Sons of Sam Horn forum[67] and his 
own blog[68] to point out errors in Shaughnessy's columns. On April 27, 
2007, broadcaster Gary Thorne said that he overheard Red Sox catcher Doug 
Mirabelli say that the blood on the sock used by Schilling in Game 6 of 
the 2004 ALCS was actually paint.[69] Mirabelli accused Thorne of lying 
and a day later, after talking to Mirabelli, Thorne backed off his statement 
saying he misinterpreted what was intended as a joke, "Having talked with 
him today, there's no doubt in my mind that's not what he said, that's 
not what he meant. He explained that it was in the context of the sarcasm 
and the jabbing that goes on in the clubhouse." Schilling responded in 
his blog by saying the following: So Gary Thorne says that Doug told him 
the blood was fake. Which even when he's called out he can't admit he lied. 
Doug never told Gary Thorne anything. Gary Thorne overheard something and 
then misreported what he overheard. Not only did he misreport it, he misinterpreted 
what he misreported.[70] Schilling plays the board wargame Advanced Squad 
Leader. Schilling's disappointment at not being able to attend the ASL 
Oktoberfest (an annual game convention) led him to create his own, The 
ASL Open, which debuted the weekend of January 15, 1993, in Houston, Texas. 
The Open was financed out of his own pocket. Schilling also started his 
own amateur publication entitled Fire for Effect, a bi-monthly featuring 
"some of the ASL hobby's best writers".[71] When his favorite game was 
sold along with Avalon Hill to Hasbro, Schilling joined the small gaming 
company Multi-Man Publishing which maintained ASL and other Avalon Hill 
titles. MMP also started a new, professional publication entitled ASL Journal 
and contributed articles, editorials, and game scenarios.[72] Schilling 
has played EverQuest and EverQuest II and has reviewed two of the game's 
many expansion packs for PC Gamer magazine. Schilling has played World 
of Warcraft[73] and became a regular guest on the World of Warcraft podcast 
The Instance.[74] In 2006 Schilling created Green Monster Games, which 
Schilling stated was not named after the Fenway left field wall.[75] In 
early 2007, the company's name changed to 38 Studios.[76] In January 2008, 
Schilling announced that he would be focusing on an MMORPG project after 
his retirement. Comic book creator Todd McFarlane and fantasy author R.A. 
Salvatore were working with Schilling on the project.[77] The new game 
was developed under the code-name Copernicus. A single-player RPG set in 
the same setting, titled Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, was released by 
his company 38 Studios in February 2012. Executives from 38 Studios introduced 
the game at the Comic-Con 2010 convention in San Diego.[78] In July 2010, 
the Rhode Island Board of Economic Development approved a $75 million guaranteed 
loan to 38 Studios. 38 Studios promised to bring 450 jobs to the state 
by the end of 2012. In May 2012, 38 Studios defaulted on its loan from 
the state of Rhode Island and failed to meet payroll obligations to its 
employees. 38 Studios and its subsidiary, Big Huge Games, then laid off 
their staffs[79] with a mass email.[80] Some of the laid-off employees 
may have second mortgages because the company had not actually sold homes 
for them as part of a relocation package.[81] Some have accused Schilling 
of hypocrisy based on the conflict between his professed views on "big 
government" and the studio's relationship with "big government".[82] On 
November 1, 2012, Schilling was sued by the state in connection with the 
loan. Governor Lincoln Chafee said: "My message to Rhode Islanders is this: 
I know that you work hard for your paychecks, and for your tax dollars 
to be squandered is unacceptable. The Board's legal action was taken to 
rectify a grave injustice put upon the people of Rhode Island."[83] In 
a July 2012 interview, Schilling discussed the downfall of 38 Studios, 
citing the Rhode Island governor and his own optimism as the primary reasons 
for the demise of the company.[84] He has a custom avatar in EverQuest 
II, as the creators of the game have made Schilling a special online character. 
from June 5 to June 7, 2006, fans were able to battle a virtual Curt Schilling 
in the game. Every time the virtual Schilling was defeated, Sony Online 
Entertainment donated $5 towards ALS research.[85] Before the 2007 season, 
Schilling started a blog called 38pitches.com[86] in which he answered 
fan questions, documented his starts, and refuted press coverage about 
him or the team that he believed to be inaccurate. After retiring, he moved 
his blog to the WEEI sports radio website. After a disagreement with the 
station, Schilling removed it from that site. Schilling periodically contributes 
on the ESPN Boston website answering fan questions about the Red Sox or 
baseball in general.[87] Schilling can also be found on the popular micro-blogging 
website Twitter under the handle gehrig38.[88] In November 2014, Schilling 
got into a day-long Twitter argument with baseball writer Keith Law over 
the creation-evolution controversy, where he argued for creationism against 
Law's defense of evolution, after which ESPN decided to suspend Law's Twitter 
account.[89] ESPN commented that "Keith's Twitter suspension had absolutely 
nothing to do with his opinions on the subject", but it remains unclear 
what other motivation is behind the act, since the conversation between 
Schilling and Law reportedly "never really turned hostile", with many reading 
the details feeling that his suspension was "ridiculous".[90] Schilling's 
account was not suspended, and he continued to tweet.[89] Returning to 
Twitter after the ban expired, Law's first tweet "Eppur si muove" ("And 
yet it moves") made clear that Schilling's complaints about his posts contradicting 
his argument were in fact the reason for the suspension.[91] On February 
25, 2015, Schilling posted a congratulatory tweet to his then-17-year-old 
daughter Gabby for her acceptance to college and the school's softball 
team. Some responses to his tweet made crude references to rape, fisting 
and anal sex, among other sexual references. Schilling posted to his blog 
screen captures of some offending tweets, along with the real identities 
of the Twitter handles, whose jobs, schools and relatives he claimed to 
have contacted.[92] At least two of the Twitter users were known to have 
been punished, with one losing his part-time job as a ticket seller for 
the Yankees, and still another being suspended from Brookdale Community 
College.[93] Schilling claimed at least seven others were also penalized 
by their jobs or athletic teams.[94] Schilling was selected as the commencement 
speaker for Worcester Polytechnic Institute's 2010 commencement [95] and 
awarded a Doctorate of Science, honoris causa.[96] Schilling debuted on 
ESPN as a baseball color analyst on April 4, 2010, on the pre-game show 
for the 2010 season opener between the New York Yankees and Boston Red 
Sox. He has written for WEEI.com, 38pitches.com, and WordPress.com. In 
2014 he was named as an analyst for ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball, although 
his subsequent cancer diagnosis prevented him from working the telecasts 
for most of the season. On September 14, 2014, Schilling returned to the
