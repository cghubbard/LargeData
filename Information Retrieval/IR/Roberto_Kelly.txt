Roberto Conrado "Gray" Kelly (born October 1, 1964) is a Panamanian former 
professional baseball outfielder in Major League Baseball. He was signed 
by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1982 and went on to 
play for them (1987–1992 and 2000), the Cincinnati Reds (1993–1994), Atlanta 
Braves (1994), Montreal Expos (1995), Los Angeles Dodgers (1995), Minnesota 
Twins (1996–1997), Seattle Mariners (1997) and Texas Rangers (1998–1999). 
During his playing days in Panama, he was known as La Sombra, Spanish for 
Shadow. After his playing career, he managed the Giants' single-A team, 
the Augusta GreenJackets and later became a coach for the Giants major 
league team.[1] Kelly was a member of four playoff teams in his career, 
having helped the Dodgers win the 1995 NL West Division, the Mariners win 
the 1997 AL West, and the Rangers win the 1998 and 1999 AL Western Division.[2] 
(Kelly played ten games for the 2000 American League East-winning New York 
Yankees, but played his final game on April 18, long before the playoffs.)[3] 
He was a two-time All-Star, having been named to the 1992 American League 
All-Star team as well as the 1993 National League All-Star team. Kelly 
also broke up Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave Stieb's perfect game in 1989 
with a 2-out double in the 9th inning.[4] In 14 seasons, he played in 1,337 
games and had 4,797 at bats, 687 runs, 1,390 hits, 241 doubles, 30 triples, 
124 home runs, 585 RBI, 235 stolen bases, 317 walks, a .290 batting average, 
a .337 on-base percentage and a .430 slugging percentage.[2] On November 
16, 2007, Kelly was hired as the San Francisco Giants' new first base coach 
and hitting instructor. As a manager of the Augusta GreenJackets, he gained 
a reputation for his aggressive approach to baserunning.[1] In February 
2008, he told Giants pitchers that he didn't want them to use the fact 
that they were pitchers as an excuse for poor baserunning.[1] Kelly has 
six sons, including Roberto Kelly Jr., who is a college football player 
at Valparaiso University; Xavier is a state-ranked wrestler in Florida 
and Ryan practices football in Panama. Kelly has three daughters named
