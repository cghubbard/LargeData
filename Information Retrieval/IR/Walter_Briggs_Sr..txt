Walter Owen Briggs Sr. (February 27, 1877 – January 17, 1952) was an American 
entrepreneur and professional sports owner. He was part-owner of the Detroit 
Tigers in Major League Baseball from 1919 to 1935, and then sole owner 
from 1935 to his death in 1952. Briggs also helped found the Detroit Zoo 
in 1928, and personally paid for many of its first exhibits.[1] He was 
also a patron of Eastern Michigan University and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.[2] 
Briggs was born on February 27, 1877 in Ypsilanti, Michigan, to Rodney 
D. Briggs and Ada Warner.[2] He grew up a Detroit Tigers fan. In his early 
youth he worked at the Michigan Central Railroad and later opened Briggs 
Manufacturing Company in 1908, which specialized in the manufacturing of 
automobile bodies for the auto industry and later diversified into plumbing 
fixtures.[3] After the death of Tigers' part-owner Bill Yawkey in 1919, 
surviving partner Frank Navin arranged for Briggs to buy a 25 percent stake 
in the club. He later bought enough stock to become a full partner with 
Navin, though he stayed in the background while Navin was alive. After 
Navin died in 1935, Briggs became the sole owner of the franchise.[4] As 
owner, among Briggs' first actions was completing major renovation and 
expansion plans to Navin Field. He double-decked the grandstand and converted 
the park into a bowl. It reopened in 1938 as Briggs Stadium, with a seating 
capacity of 58,000.[5] The stadium was later renamed Tiger Stadium. Briggs 
was noted for fielding a well-paid team that won two American League pennants 
(1940, 1945) and a World Series championship in 1945 under his ownership.[6] 
He had a reputation for being somewhat prejudiced against African-Americans, 
in part because he refused to sign black players (though he allowed blacks 
to work at his factory)[7] and would not allow black fans to sit in the 
boxes at Briggs Stadium.[citation needed] The Tigers did not field their 
first non-white player until 1958, six years after Briggs' death—making 
them the second-to-last team in the majors to integrate (ahead of only 
the Boston Red Sox). Briggs died at age 74 in Miami Beach, Florida on January 
17, 1952.[1] His son, Walter Briggs Jr., briefly inherited the Tigers before 
being forced by the court to sell them in 1956.[8] His daughter, Jane Briggs 
Hart (1921 – 2015), was an aviator and widow of the late United States 
Senator Philip A. Hart. Janey Hart earned her first pilot's license during 
World War II, and later became the first licensed female helicopter pilot 
in Michigan. In the early 1960s, Hart was chosen to participate in the 
Lovelace Foundation's Woman in Space Program, a privately funded project 
designed to test women pilots for astronaut fitness by subjecting them 
to the same physical tests developed by NASA for astronauts. At the age 
of 40, Hart became one of only 13 women (later dubbed the Mercury 13) to 
qualify. In 2007, Hart was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame. 
Janey Hart was born in Detroit, Michigan, on October 21, 1921, to Walter
