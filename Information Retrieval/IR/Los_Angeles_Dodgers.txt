The Los Angeles Dodgers are an American professional baseball team based 
in Los Angeles, California. The Dodgers compete in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West division. Established 
in 1883 in Brooklyn, New York,[1][2] the team moved to Los Angeles before 
the 1958 season.[3] They played for four seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum before moving to their current home of Dodger Stadium in 1962. 
The Dodgers as a franchise have won six World Series titles and 21 National 
League pennants. 11 NL MVP award winners have played for the Dodgers, winning 
a total of 13 MVP Awards, Eight Cy Young Award winners have pitched for 
the Dodgers, winning a total of twelve Cy Young Awards. The team has also 
produced 16 Rookie of the Year Award winners, including four consecutive 
from 1979 to 1982 and five consecutive from 1992 to 1996. In the 20th century, 
the team, then known as the Robins, won league pennants in 1916 and 1920, 
losing the World Series both times, first to Boston and then Cleveland. 
In the 1930s, the team changed its name to the Dodgers, named after the 
Brooklyn pedestrians who dodged the streetcars in the city.[4] In 1941, 
the Dodgers captured their third National League pennant, only to lose 
again to the New York Yankees. This marked the onset of the Dodgers–Yankees 
rivalry, as the Dodgers would face them in their next six World Series 
appearances. Led by Jackie Robinson, the first black Major League Baseball 
player of the modern era; and three-time National League Most Valuable 
Player Roy Campanella, also signed out of the Negro Leagues, the Dodgers 
captured their first World Series title in 1955 by defeating the Yankees 
for the first time, a story notably described in the 1972 book The Boys 
of Summer. Following the 1957 season the team left Brooklyn. In just their 
second season in Los Angeles, the Dodgers won their second World Series 
title, beating the Chicago White Sox in six games in 1959. Spearheaded 
by the dominant pitching style of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, the Dodgers 
captured three pennants in the 1960s and won two more World Series titles, 
sweeping the Yankees in four games in 1963, and edging the Minnesota Twins 
in seven in 1965. The 1963 sweep was their second victory against the Yankees, 
and their first against them as a Los Angeles team. The Dodgers won four 
more pennants in 1966, 1974, 1977 and 1978, but lost in each World Series 
appearance. They went on to win the World Series again in 1981, thanks 
in part to pitching sensation Fernando Valenzuela. The early 1980s were 
affectionately dubbed "Fernandomania." In 1988, another pitching hero, 
Orel Hershiser, again led them to a World Series victory, aided by one 
of the most memorable home runs of all time, by their injured star outfielder 
Kirk Gibson coming off the bench to pinch hit with two outs in the bottom 
of the ninth inning of game 1, in his only appearance of the series. The 
Dodgers share a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants, the oldest 
rivalry in baseball, dating back to when the two franchises played in New 
York City. Both teams moved west for the 1958 season. The Brooklyn Dodgers 
and Los Angeles Dodgers have collectively appeared in the World Series 
18 times, while the New York Giants and San Francisco Giants have collectively 
appeared 20 times and have been invited 21 times. The Giants have won two 
more World Series (8); the Dodgers have won 21 National League pennants, 
while the Giants hold the record with 23. Although the two franchises have 
enjoyed near equal success, the city rivalries are rather lopsided and 
in both cases, a team's championships have predated to the other's first 
one in that particular location. When the two teams were based in New York, 
the Giants won five World Series championships, and the Dodgers one. After 
the move to California, the Dodgers have won five in Los Angeles, the Giants 
have won three in San Francisco. The Dodgers were originally founded in 
1883 as the Brooklyn Atlantics, taking the name of a defunct team that 
had played in Brooklyn before them. The team joined the American Association 
in 1884 and won the AA championship in 1889 before joining the National 
League in 1890. They promptly won the NL Championship their first year 
in the League. The team was known alternatively as the Bridegrooms[5], 
Grooms, Superbas, Robins, and Trolley Dodgers before officially becoming 
the Dodgers in the 1930s. In Brooklyn, the Dodgers won the NL pennant several 
times (1890, 1899, 1900, 1916, 1920, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955, 
1956) and the World Series in 1955. After moving to Los Angeles, the team 
won National League pennants in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1974, 1977, 1978, 
1981, and 1988, with World Series championships in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981, 
1988. In all, the Dodgers have appeared in 18 World Series: 9 in Brooklyn 
and 9 in Los Angeles. For most of the first half of the 20th century, no 
Major League Baseball team employed an African American player. Jackie 
Robinson became the first African American to play for a Major League Baseball 
team when he played his first major league game on April 15, 1947, as a 
member of the Brooklyn Dodgers. This was mainly due to general manager 
Branch Rickey's efforts. The deeply religious Rickey's motivation appears 
to have been primarily moral, although business considerations were also 
a factor. Rickey was a member of The Methodist Church, the antecedent denomination 
to The United Methodist Church of today, which was a strong advocate for 
social justice and active later in the American Civil Rights Movement.[6] 
This event was the harbinger of the integration of professional sports 
in the United States, the concomitant demise of the Negro Leagues, and 
is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American Civil Rights 
movement. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy runner who sparked 
the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient of the Rookie 
of the Year award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson Award in his 
honor. The Dodgers' willingness to integrate, when most other teams refused 
to, was a key factor in their 1947–1956 success. They won six pennants 
in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP Roy Campanella, 
Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe, Jim Gilliam and Joe Black. Robinson 
would eventually go on to become the first African-American elected to 
the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. Real estate businessman Walter O'Malley 
had acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950, when he bought 
the shares of his co-owners, Branch Rickey and the estate of James L. Smith. 
Before long he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more 
accessible and better arrayed ballpark than Ebbets Field. Beloved as it 
was, Ebbets Field was no longer well-served by its aging infrastructure 
and the Dodgers could no longer sell out the park even in the heat of a 
pennant race, despite largely dominating the National League from 1946 
to 1957. O'Malley wanted to build a new, state of the art stadium in Brooklyn. 
But City Planner Robert Moses and New York politicians refused to grant 
him the eminent domain authority required to build pursuant to O'Malley's 
plans. To put pressure on the city, during the 1955 season, O'Malley announced 
that the team would play seven regular season games and one exhibition 
game at Jersey City's Roosevelt Stadium in 1956.[7] Moses and the City 
considered this an empty threat, and did not believe O'Malley would go 
through with moving the team from New York City. After teams began to travel 
to and from games by air instead of train, it became possible to include 
locations in the far west. Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World 
Series looking to the Washington Senators to move to the West Coast. When 
O'Malley heard that LA was looking for a club, he sent word to the Los 
Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. LA offered him what 
New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, 
and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all revenue streams. 
When the news came out, NYC Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. and Moses made 
an offer to build a ballpark on the World's Fair Grounds in Queens that 
would be shared by the Giants and Dodgers. However, O'Malley was interested 
in his park only under his conditions, and the plans for a new stadium 
in Brooklyn seemed like a pipe dream. O'Malley decided to move the Dodgers 
to California, convincing Giants owner Horace Stoneham to move to San Francisco 
instead of Minneapolis to keep another team on the West Coast to ease approval 
of the moves. There was no turning back: the Dodgers were heading for Hollywood.[7] 
The Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, 1957, 
which the Dodgers won 2–0 over the Pittsburgh Pirates. New York would remain 
a one-team town with the New York Yankees until 1962, when Joan Payson 
founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball back to 
the city. The blue background used by the Dodgers, would be adopted by 
the Mets, honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Dodgers 
blue and Giants orange.[8] The Dodgers were the first Major League Baseball 
team to ever play in Los Angeles. On April 18, 1958, the Dodgers played 
their first LA game, defeating the former New York and now new San Francisco 
Giants, 6–5, before 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Catcher 
Roy Campanella, left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, was 
never able to play in Los Angeles. Construction on Dodger Stadium was completed 
in time for Opening Day 1962. With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque 
setting amid hills and palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon 
of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle. O'Malley was determined 
that there would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by cantilevered 
grandstands that have since been widely imitated. More importantly for 
the team, the stadium's spacious dimensions, along with other factors, 
gave defense an advantage over offense and the Dodgers moved to take advantage 
of this by assembling a team that would excel with its pitching. Since 
moving to Los Angeles, the Dodgers have won nine more National League Championships 
and five World Series rings. The Dodgers' official history reports that 
the term "Trolley Dodgers" was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to 
the complex maze of trolley cars that weaved its way through the borough 
of Brooklyn.[9] In 1892, the city of Brooklyn (Brooklyn was an independent 
city until annexed by New York City in 1898) began replacing its slow-moving, 
horse-drawn trolley lines with the faster, more powerful electric trolley 
lines.[10] Within less than three years, by the end of 1895, electric trolley 
accidents in Brooklyn had resulted in more than 130 deaths and maimed well 
over 500 people.[11] Brooklyn's high-profile, the significant number of 
widely reported accidents, and a trolley strike in early 1895, combined 
to create a strong association in the public's mind between Brooklyn and 
trolley dodging.[10] Sportswriters started using the name "trolley dodgers" 
to refer to the Brooklyn team early in the 1895 season.[12] The name was 
shortened to, on occasion, the "Brooklyn Dodgers" as early as 1898.[13] 
Sportswriters in the early 20th century began referring to the Dodgers 
as the "Bums", in reference to the team's fans and possibly because of 
the "street character" nature of Jack Dawkins, the "Artful Dodger" in Charles 
Dickens' Oliver Twist. Other team names used by the franchise were the 
Atlantics, Grays, Grooms, Bridegrooms, Superbas and Robins. All of these 
nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team, but 
not in any official capacity. The team's legal name was the Brooklyn Base 
Ball Club.[14] However, the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout 
this period, simultaneously with these other nicknames, by fans and sportswriters 
of the day. The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932, 
when the word "Dodgers" appeared on team jerseys.[1] The "conclusive shift" 
came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name 
"Dodgers".[2] Examples of how the many popularized names of the team were 
used are available from newspaper articles before 1932. A New York Times 
article describing a game in 1916 starts out: "Jimmy Callahan, pilot of 
the Pirates, did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining 
the National League pennant", but then goes on to comment: "the only thing 
that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the 
Phillies lost one of the two games played".[15] What is interesting about 
the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and 
baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn 
team as the Robins. A 1918 New York Times article uses the nickname in 
its title: "Buccaneers Take Last From Robins", but the subtitle of the 
article reads: "Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break".[16] 
Another example of the use of the many nicknames is found on the program 
issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series which identifies the matchup 
in the series as "Dodgers vs. Indians" despite the fact that the Robins 
nickname had been in consistent use for around six years.[17] The "Robins" 
nickname was derived from the name of their Hall of Fame manager, Wilbert 
Robinson, who led the team from 1914 to 1931.[18] The Dodgers' uniform 
has remained relatively unchanged since the 1930s. The home jersey is white 
with "Dodgers" written in script across the chest in Dodger Blue. The road 
jersey is grey with "Los Angeles" written in script across the chest in 
Dodger Blue. The word "Dodgers" was first used on the front of the team's 
home jersey in 1933; the uniform was then white with red pinstripes and 
a stylized "B" on the left shoulder.[19] The Dodgers also wore green outlined 
uniforms and green caps throughout the 1937 season but reverted to blue 
the following year. The current design was created in 1939, and has remained 
the same ever since with only cosmetic changes. In 1952, the home uniform 
added a red uniform number under the "Dodgers" script. The road jersey 
also has a red uniform number under the script. When the franchise moved 
from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the city name on the road jersey changed, 
and the stylized "B" was replaced with the interlocking "LA" on the caps 
in 1958. In 1970, the Dodgers removed the city name from the road jerseys 
and had "Dodgers" on both the home and away uniforms. The city script returned 
to the road jerseys in 1999, and the tradition-rich Dodgers flirted with 
an alternate uniform for the first time since 1944 (when all-blue satin 
uniforms were introduced). These 1999 alternate jerseys had a royal blue 
top with the "Dodgers" script in white across the chest, and the red number 
on the front. These were worn with white pants and a new cap with silver 
brim, top button and Dodger logo. These alternates proved unpopular and 
the team abandoned them after only one season. In 2014, the Dodgers introduced 
an alternate road jersey: a grey version with the "Dodgers" script instead 
of the city name. Current logo using "Dodgers" Script Los Angeles Dodgers 
Script on Dodger Blue The Dodgers have been groundbreaking in their signing 
of players from Asia; mainly, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Former owner 
Peter O'Malley began reaching out in 1980 by starting clinics in China 
and South Korea, building baseball fields in two Chinese cities, and in 
1998 becoming the first major league team to open an office in Asia. The 
Dodgers were the second team to start a Japanese player in recent history, 
pitcher Hideo Nomo, the first team to start a South Korean player, pitcher 
Chan Ho Park, and the first Taiwanese player, Chin-Feng Chen. In addition, 
they were the first team to send out three Asian pitchers, from different 
Asian countries, in one game: Park, Hong-Chih Kuo of Taiwan, and Takashi 
Saito of Japan. In the 2008 season, the Dodgers had the most Asian players 
on its roster of any major league team with five. They included Japanese 
pitchers Takashi Saito and Hiroki Kuroda; South Korean pitcher Chan Ho 
Park; and Taiwanese pitcher Hong-Chih Kuo and infielder Chin-Lung Hu. In 
2005, the Dodgers' Hee Seop Choi became the first Asian player to compete 
in the Home Run Derby.[20] For the 2013 season, the Dodgers signed starting 
pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu with a six-year, $36 million contract, after posting 
a bid of nearly $27 million to acquire him from the KBO's Hanhwa Eagles. 
For the 2016 season, the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Kenta Maeda with 
an eight-year, $25 million contract, after posting a bid of $20 million 
to acquire him from the NPB's Hiroshima Toyo Carp. The Dodgers' rivalry 
with the San Francisco Giants dates back to the 19th century, when the 
two teams were based in New York; the rivalry with the New York Yankees 
took place when the Dodgers were based in New York, but was revived with 
their East Coast/West Coast World Series battles in 1963, 1977, 1978, and 
1981. The Dodgers also had a heated rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds during 
the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim and the San Diego Padres dates back to the Angels' and Padres' 
respective inaugural seasons (Angels in 1961, Padres in 1969). Regional 
proximity is behind the rivalries with both the Angels and the Padres. 
The Dodgers–Giants rivalry is one of the longest-standing rivalries in 
American baseball.[21][22] The feud between the Dodgers and the San Francisco 
Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New 
York City, with the Dodgers playing in Brooklyn and the Giants playing 
at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner 
Walter O'Malley moved the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons.[23] 
Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham—who 
was considering moving his team to Minnesota—to preserve the rivalry by 
bringing his team to California as well.[23] New York baseball fans were 
stunned and heartbroken by the move.[23][24] Given that the cities of Los 
Angeles and San Francisco have been bitter rivals in economic, cultural, 
and political arenas for over a century and a half, the new venue in California 
became fertile ground for its transplantation. Each team's ability to endure 
for over a century while moving across an entire continent, as well as 
the rivalry's leap from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have 
led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in sports history.[25][26][27] 
Unlike many other historic baseball match-ups in which one team remains 
dominant for most of their history, the Dodgers–Giants rivalry has exhibited 
a persistent balance in the respective successes of the two teams. While 
the Giants have more wins in franchise history, and lead all NL teams with 
23 National League pennants, the Dodgers are second, having won 21;[28] 
the Giants have won eight World Series titles, while the Dodgers have won 
six. The 2010 World Series was the Giants' first championship since moving 
to California, while the Dodgers' last title came in the 1988 World Series. 
This rivalry refers to a series of games played with the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim. The series takes its name from the massive freeway system in 
the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one 
could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by traveling along 
Interstate 5. The term is akin to Subway Series which refers to meetings 
between New York City baseball teams. The term "Freeway Series" also inspired 
the official name of the regions' NHL rivalry: the Freeway Face-Off The 
Dodgers–Yankees rivalry is one of the most well-known rivalries in Major 
League Baseball.[29] The two teams have met eleven times in the World Series, 
more times than any other pair from the American and National Leagues.[29] 
The initial significance was embodied in the two teams' proximity in New 
York City, when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers 
moved to Los Angeles in 1958, the rivalry retained its significance as 
the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United 
States, and since the 1980s, the two largest cities in the United States. 
Although the rivalry's significance arose from the two teams' numerous 
World Series meetings,[29] the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the 
World Series since 1981.[29] They would not play each other in a non-exhibition 
game until 2004, when they played a three-game interleague series.[29] 
Their last meeting was in September 2016, when the Dodgers won two out 
of three games in New York. The Dodgers have a loyal fanbase, evidenced 
by the fact that the Dodgers were the first MLB team to attract more than 
3 million fans in a season (in 1978), and accomplished that feat six more 
times before any other franchise did it once.[30] The Dodgers drew at least 
3 million fans for 15 consecutive seasons from 1996 to 2010, the longest 
such streak in all of MLB.[30] On July 3, 2007, Dodgers management announced 
that total franchise attendance, dating back to 1901, had reached 175 million, 
a record for all professional sports.[31] In 2007, the Dodgers set a franchise 
record for single-season attendance, attracting over 3.8 million fans.[32] 
In 2009, the Dodgers led MLB in total attendance.[33] The Dodger baseball 
cap is consistently in the top three in sales.[34] During the 2011-2012 
season, Frank McCourt, the owner of the Dodgers at that time, was going 
through a rough divorce with his wife over who should be the owner of the 
Dodger team. Instead, Frank McCourt paid $131 million to his wife as part 
of the divorce settlement.[35] As a result, the team payroll was financially 
low for a big-budget team crippling the Dodgers in the free-agent market. 
Collectively, the team performance waned due to the distracting drama in 
the front office resulting in low attendance numbers.[36] Given the team's 
proximity to Hollywood, numerous celebrities can often be seen attending 
home games at Dodger Stadium. Celebrities such as co-owner Magic Johnson, 
Mary Hart, Larry King, Tiger Woods, Alyssa Milano and Shia LaBeouf are 
known to sit at field box seats behind home plate where they sign autographs 
for fellow Dodger fans. Actor Bryan Cranston is a lifelong Dodger fan. 
The Dodgers set the world record for the largest attendance for a single 
baseball game during an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox on March 
28, 2008 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in honor of the Dodgers 50th 
anniversary, with 115,300 fans in attendance. All proceeds from the game 
benefited the official charity of the Dodgers, ThinkCure! which supports 
cancer research at Children's Hospital Los Angeles and City of Hope. Mainly 
Dodgers fans are from their own location in southern California and also 
parts of southern Nevada. Vin Scully has called Dodgers games since 1950.[37] 
His longtime partners were Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) and Ross Porter (1977–2004).[37] 
In 1976, he was selected by Dodgers fans as the Most Memorable Personality 
(on the field or off) in the team's history. He is also a recipient of 
the Baseball Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters (inducted 
in 1982). Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have 
an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer 
and the other[s] as color commentator), Scully, Doggett and Porter generally 
called games solo, trading with each other inning-by-inning. In the 1980s 
and 1990s, Scully would call the entire radio broadcast except for the 
third and seventh inning, allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast 
an inning. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced 
by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast 
games for the California Angels and Chicago White Sox.[37] Drysdale died 
in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game in Montreal in 
1993. This was a difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter who could not 
mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official 
announcement made.[38] He was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder Rick 
Monday.[37] Porter's tenure ended after the 2004 season, after which the 
format of play-by-play announcers and color commentators was installed, 
led by Monday and newcomer Charley Steiner.[37] Scully, however, continues 
to announce solo. Scully calls roughly 100 games per season (all home games 
and road games in California and Arizona)[39] for both flagship radio station 
KLAC and on television for SportsNet LA. Scully is simulcast for the first 
three innings of each of his appearances, then announces only for the TV 
audience. If Scully is calling the game, Steiner takes over play-by-play 
on radio beginning with the fourth inning, with Monday as color commentator.[39] 
If Scully is not calling the game, Steiner and Orel Hershiser call the 
entire game on television while Monday and Kevin Kennedy do the same on 
radio. In the event the Dodgers are in post-season play, Scully calls the 
first three and last three innings of the radio broadcast alone and Steiner 
and Monday handle the middle innings.[40] The Dodgers also broadcast on 
radio in Spanish, and the play-by-play is voiced by another Frick Award 
winner, Jaime Jarrín, who has been with the Dodgers since 1959. The color 
analyst for some games is former Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, for 
whom Jarrin once translated post-game interviews. The Spanish-language 
radio flagship station is KTNQ. Dave Bancroft Dan Brouthers Roy Campanella

ceremony at Dodger Stadium on June 4, 1972. This was the year in which 
Koufax was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame; Robinson and Campanella 
were already Hall-of-Famers. Alston's number was retired in the year following 
his retirement as the Dodgers manager, six years before he was inducted 
into the Hall of Fame. Gilliam died suddenly in 1978 after a 28-year career 
with the Dodgers organization. The Dodgers retired his number two days 
after his death, prior to Game 1 of the 1978 World Series. He is the only 
non-Hall-of-Famer to have his number retired by the Dodgers. Beginning 
in 1980, the Dodgers have retired the numbers of longtime Dodgers (Snider, 
Reese, Drysdale, Lasorda, and Sutton) during the seasons in which each 
was inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 1997, 50 years after he broke the 
color barrier and 25 years after the Dodgers retired his number, Robinson's 
No.42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball. Robinson is the only 
major league baseball player to have this honor bestowed upon him. Starting 
in the 2007 season, Jackie Robinson Day (April 15, commemorating Opening 
Day of Robinson's rookie season of 1947) has featured many or all players 
and coaches wearing the number 42 as a tribute to Robinson. The Dodgers 
have not issued No.34 since the departure of Fernando Valenzuela in 1991, 
although it has not been officially retired. Pitchers Catchers Infielders

Depth Chart → All MLB rosters Since 1884, the Dodgers have used a total 
of 31 Managers, the most current being Dave Roberts, who was appointed 
following the 2015 postseason, after the departure of Don Mattingly. Over 
the nearly 43 years from 1954 to mid-1996, the Dodgers employed only two 
managers, Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda, both of whom are in the Hall 
of Fame. During this entire time period of extraordinary stability, the 
Dodgers were family owned by Walter O'Malley and then his son Peter O'Malley. 
It was during this era that the Dodgers won 11 of their 21 pennants, and 
all six of their World Series championships. The managers of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers (1958–present) are as follows: From the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles 
from Brooklyn in 1958, the Dodgers employed a handful of well-known public 
address announcers; the most famous of which was John Ramsey, who served 
as the PA voice of the Dodgers from 1958 until his retirement in 1982; 
as well as announcing at other venerable Los Angeles venues, including 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena, and the Forum. Ramsey 
died in 1990. From 1958 to 1982, Doug Moore, a local businessman; Philip 
Petty, an Orange County Superior Court Judge; and Dennis Packer; served 
as back-up voices for John Ramsey for the Dodgers, California Angels, Los 
Angeles Chargers, USC football and Los Angeles Rams. Packer was Ramsey's 
primary backup for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until Ramsey's 
retirement from the Forum in 1978. Thereafter, Packer became the public 
address announcer for the Lakers, Kings, indoor soccer and indoor tennis 
events at the Forum. Nick Nickson, a radio broadcaster for the Los Angeles 
Kings, replaced John Ramsey as the Dodger Stadium public address announcer 
in 1983 and served in that capacity through the 1989 season to work with 
the Kings full-time. Dennis Packer and Pete Arbogast were emulators of 
John Ramsey, using the same stentorian style of announcing Ramsey was famous 
for. Packer and Arbogast shared the stadium announcing chores for the 1994 
FIFA World Cup matches at the Rose Bowl. Arbogast won the Dodgers job on 
the day that Ramsey died on January 25, 1990, by doing a verbatim imitation 
of Ramsey's opening and closing remarks that were standard at each game. 
His replacement, in 1993 was Mike Carlucci, who remained as the Dodgers' 
PA voice until 2003 to concentrate on his voiceover and acting career along 
with his Olympics announcing duties. Through 2014, the Dodgers public address 
announcer was Eric Smith, who also announces for the Los Angeles Clippers 
and USC Trojans.[41] On April 3, 2015 the Dodgers announced that former 
radio broadcaster Todd Leitz would become their new public address announcer. 
Leitz was an anchor and news reporter in Los Angeles at KNX 1070 AM for 
10 years, and a news reporter at KABC 790 for two years.[42] Vin Scully 
is permanently honored in the Hall's "Scribes & Mikemen" exhibit as a result 
of winning the Ford C. Frick Award in 1982. As with all Frick Award recipients, 
he is not officially considered an inducted member of the Hall of Fame. 
Sue Falsone, served as the first female physical therapist in Major League 
baseball, and from 2012 to 2013, was the first female head athletic trainer.
