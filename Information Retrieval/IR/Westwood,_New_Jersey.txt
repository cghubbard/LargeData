Westwood (known as "The Hub of the Pascack Valley"[21]) is a borough in 
Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States 
Census, the borough's population was 10,908,[10][11][12] reflecting a decline 
of 91 (-0.8%) from the 10,999 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in 
turn increased by 553 (+5.3%) from the 10,446 counted in the 1990 Census.[22] 
Westwood is part of the New York metropolitan area.[23] Many of its residents 
regularly commute to New York City for work and leisure, many using public 
transportation.[24][25] Westwood was officially incorporated as a borough 
on May 8, 1894, from portions of Washington Township, early during the 
"Boroughitis" phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 
26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone.[26][27] Isaac D. Bogert 
served as the first mayor of the Borough.[28] In April 1909, Westwood was 
enlarged through the annexation of the "Old Hook" section of the borough 
of Emerson,[29] and on September 24, 1957, portions of the borough were 
exchanged with Emerson.[26] The Lenni-Lenape Native Americans inhabited 
this part of the state and shared it with the transient hunters and trappers 
until the permanent settlers began to enter in mid-18th century.[30] In 
the early 19th century, the area that would later become Westwood was within 
the larger political boundaries of Harrington Township, which had been 
established by royal charter in 1775. In 1840, the western half of Harrington 
Township became Washington Township, with the Hackensack River as the dividing 
line.[26] Washington Township was an agrarian region with isolated farmsteads. 
Early families, including the Hoppers and Ackermans, are buried at the 
Old Hook Cemetery. An 18th-century mill was situated at the dammed stream 
near the intersection of today's Mill Street and First Avenue. This mill 
was on an important east west pathway and was the first on Musquapsink 
Brook.[31] The mill was largely destroyed after a fire set by an arsonist 
and was dismantled in 1910.[32] A brief description of Washington Township 
written in 1844 described it as a township with six stores, four schools 
for 135 students, six grist mills, and 14 saw mills.[33] The first wave 
of concentrated development took place as the result of the coming of the 
Hackensack and New York Railroad in 1870, which followed the route of today's 
Pascack Valley Line. On March 5, 1870, service began between Westwood and 
New York City (via Jersey City and a ferry ride). Several small hotels 
were built near the depot, and in 1872 several houses in the latest European-influenced 
styles began to be built along Centre Avenue.[34] Old maps show that growth 
occurred simultaneously on the land both to the east and west of the tracks. 
The commercial buildings included lumber and coal sheds, stores, and a 
bakery. There was a chapel on the corner of Third and Park Avenues. The 
triangular park that has played an important role as a place of community 
gatherings is also shown on the 1876 map.[35] By the 1880s, Westwood had 
four factories, several distilleries, a new school, a laundry and grocery 
store, and a new Reformed Church. In 1890, following a meeting of interested 
residents, those favoring the incorporation of Westwood as an independent 
borough conducted a petition drive. In 1894, Westwood separated from Washington 
Township and became an independent borough. Elected as the borough's first 
mayor was Isaac D. Bogert.[36] In 1899, a water plant constructed by Cornelius 
S. DeBraun provided service to the houses that had been built along the 
borough's newly laid streets.[34] By the time of the 1905 New Jersey Census, 
there were 234 dwellings housing a population of 1,044.[37] Lincoln High 
School was constructed around the turn of the 20th century, which also 
saw the introduction of electricity, telephones, and automobiles to the 
town. Underwood & Underwood Stereoscope Company opened a plant during the 
first decades of the 20th century, and many congregations established their 
first chapels, which were replaced in later years as the congregations 
grew in numbers and wealth.[34] Following a typical pattern of development 
throughout the 20th century, the results are a mature railroad suburb almost 
covered with housing units, commercial, municipal and ecclesiastical buildings. 
The borough still retains the open space of the triangular park at its 
center.[38] According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had 
a total area of 2.314 square miles (5.992 km2), including 2.266 square

is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. 
The governing body consists of a mayor directly elected by the voters and 
a six-member Borough Council. The Mayor serves a four-year term of office, 
and the Borough Council members serve three-year terms of office on a staggered 
basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year 
cycle.[7] The Borough form of government used by Westwood, the most common 
system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government 
in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding 
at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[51][52] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Westwood is Democrat 
John Birkner Jr., whose term of office ends December 31, 2019. Members 
of the Westwood Borough Council are Council President Robert Bicocchi (R,

unexpired term), Peter A. Grefrath (R, 2018), Christopher Montana (R, 2017) 
and Christopher Owens (R, 2017).[3][53][54][55][56][57] In September 2015, 
the Borough Council selected Beth Dell from a list of three candidates 
nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the vacant seat 
of Robert Miller expiring in December 2016. In announcing his resignation, 
Miller cited commitments to his family and concerns about the impact of 
extended service by elected officials.[58] In March 2014, the borough council 
unanimously selected Christopher Owens to fill the vacancy of John "J" 
Sciara, who had resigned the previous month from a term ending December 
2014.[59] Westwood is located in the 5th Congressional District[60] and 
is part of New Jersey's 39th state legislative district.[11][61][62] New
