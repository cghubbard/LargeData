Robert Earl Wilson (born Earl Lawrence Wilson) (October 2, 1934 – April 
23, 2005) was a professional baseball pitcher. He played all or part of 
eleven seasons in Major League Baseball the Boston Red Sox (1959–60, 1962–66), 
Detroit Tigers (1966–70) and San Diego Padres (1970), primarily as a starting 
pitcher. Wilson batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Ponchatoula, 
Louisiana. In an eleven-season career, Wilson posted a 121-109 record with 
1,452 strikeouts and a 3.69 ERA in 2,051.2 innings pitched. A 6-foot-3, 
215-pound pitcher who relied on sliders and fastballs, Wilson made his 
major league debut with the Red Sox on July 28, 1959, as their first black 
pitcher. Infielder Pumpsie Green had become the first black player on the 
Red Sox, joining them earlier that season, when Boston was the last of 
the 16 major league clubs to break the color barrier. On June 26, 1962, 
at Fenway Park, Wilson no-hit the Los Angeles Angels 2-0 and helped his 
own cause with a home run off Bo Belinsky—himself a no-hit pitcher earlier 
that year, on May 5. (Wes Ferrell in 1931, Jim Tobin in 1944 and Rick Wise 
in 1971 are the only three other no-hit pitchers to homer in the same game; 
the latter of the three hit two home runs in pitching his no-hitter.) Wilson 
also became the first black major leaguer to pitch an American League no-hitter. 
In five-plus seasons, Wilson won 45 games for Boston with a high of 13 
victories in 1963. He was traded to the Detroit Tigers in the 1966 midseason, 
and finished with a combined 18-11 record, a career-high in strikeouts 
with 200, and a 3.07 ERA. His most productive season came in 1967, when 
he won a career-high 22 games, tying Jim Lonborg for the American League 
lead. In the 1968 World Series, when the Tigers defeated the St. Louis 
Cardinals in seven games, Wilson was part of a starting rotation that included 
31-game winner Denny McLain and Mickey Lolich, who won three games in the 
Series. Originally a catcher, Wilson switched to pitching in 1953. According 
to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wilson hit 35 home runs in his career: 33 while 
as a pitcher, two as a pinch hitter, two in one game (1965), and seven 
in a season twice, in 740 at-bats. Only Wes Ferrell (37 HRs), Bob Lemon 
and Warren Spahn (35 each) and Red Ruffing (34) hit more home runs as pitchers, 
according to ESB. Wilson was sent to the San Diego Padres in 1970, and 
he finished his career at the end of the season. After retiring, he founded 
an automotive parts company. Wilson also held a position, in the 1980s 
(and possibly 90s), as a high school physical education teacher and basketball 
coach at Coral Springs High School in Coral Springs, Florida. Wilson died 
from a heart attack at his home in Southfield, Michigan, on April 23, 2005,
