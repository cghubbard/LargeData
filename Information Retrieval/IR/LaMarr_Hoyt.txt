Dewey LaMarr Hoyt, Jr. (born January 1, 1955, in Columbia, South Carolina) 
is a former Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher who won the 1983 
American League Cy Young Award. Originally signed by the New York Yankees 
in the fifth round of the 1973 Major League Baseball draft, Hoyt was traded 
with fellow pitching prospect Bob Polinsky, outfielder Oscar Gamble and 
$200,000 to the Chicago White Sox in a 1977 season-opening deal that sent 
the Yankees shortstop Bucky Dent.[1] A relief pitcher when he made the 
White Sox to stay in 1980, Hoyt was switched to the starting rotation in 
1982 and tied a club record by winning his first nine decisions. The record 
was first set by Lefty Williams in 1917 and equaled by Orval Grove in 1943. 
Hoyt ended up leading the American League with nineteen wins and showed 
devastating control on the mound; he walked a mere 48 batters in 239.2 
innings. Hoyt was even better in 1983, winning the American League Cy Young 
Award.[2] His 24-10 won-lost record, 3.66 earned run average and even better 
control than the previous season, (walking 31 batters in 260.2 innings, 
and leading the league in fewest walks per nine innings for the first of 
three straight seasons), helped the White Sox capture the American League 
West title. He pitched a complete game victory over the Baltimore Orioles 
in the first game of the 1983 American League Championship Series, giving 
up only one run on five hits with no walks.[3] This was the only game the 
ChiSox won in the series. The White Sox faltered in 1984, as Hoyt's record 
fell to 13-18 with a 4.47 ERA. Ironically, he went from winning the most 
games in the American League in 1983 to losing the most games the following 
year. Hoping for a rebound from the former Cy Young Award winner, the San 
Diego Padres traded Ozzie Guill√©n, Tim Lollar, Bill Long and Luis Salazar 
to the White Sox for Hoyt, Kevin Kristan and Todd Simmons during the 1984-1985 
off-season. Guillen would win the American League Rookie of the Year award 
in 1985. Hoyt began his National League career promisingly enough, making 
the NL's All-Star team his first season in the league (though named by 
his own manager Dick Williams over fellow Padre Andy Hawkins who started 
the year 11-0) and winning the game's Most Valuable Player award, giving 
up one run in three innings of work to earn the win. For the season he 
went 16-8 with a 3.47 ERA. Following the 1985 season, he was arrested twice 
within a month (between January and February 1986) on drug-possession charges, 
checking into a rehabilitation program nine days after the second arrest.[4] 
This prevented him from playing most of Spring training, and he logged 
an 8-11 won-loss record with a 5.15 ERA. Hoyt missed a start in July 1986 
after accidentally burning his back hair while attempting to light his 
flatulence.[5] Barely a month after the season ended Hoyt was arrested 
again for drug possession, this time on the U.S.-Mexico border.[6] He was 
sentenced to 45 days in jail on December 16, 1986, and suspended by then-Commissioner 
Peter Ueberroth on February 25, 1987. An arbitrator reduced his suspension 
to sixty days in mid-June and ordered the Padres to reinstate him, but 
the team gave him his unconditional release the following day. The White 
Sox gave him a second chance, signing him after his San Diego release and 
giving him time to get back into shape, but a fourth arrest on drug charges 
in December 1987 ended that.[7] A poor hitter, even by pitchers' standards, 
Hoyt had just ten hits in 110 career at-bats. The only extra base hit of 
his career was an RBI double on July 13, 1986 against Tim Conroy of the
