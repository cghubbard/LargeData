Jesse Niles Tannehill was a dead-ball era left-handed pitcher for the Cincinnati 
Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Highlanders, Boston Red Sox, and the 
Washington Senators. Tannehill was among the best pitchers of his era and 
was one of the best-hitting pitchers of all time. In fact, Tannehill was 
such a good hitter that he was used in the outfield 87 times in his career. 
Tannehill was born on July 14, 1874 in Dayton, Kentucky. He broke into 
the National League at the age of 19 with the Cincinnati Reds; however, 
he struggled in 29 innings and did not reappear in the major leagues until 
three years later. After a partial season with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 
1897, Tannehill, in 1898, set a career high in both innings pitched (326 
2⁄3) and wins (25). Tannehill had several good years with the Pirates until 
his career year in 1901, when he led the National League in ERA at 2.18. 
Tannehill posted an even better ERA in 1902––1.95––but as the league ERA 
had dropped even more precipitously, he did not lead the National League 
in ERA. After six years with the Pirates in the National League, Tannehill 
got involved in a salary dispute with Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss. As 
a result, Tannehill jumped to the startup American League franchise, the 
New York Highlanders. After the season, he was traded by the Highlanders 
to the Boston Americans for Tom L. Hughes. Tannehill still had some good 
years left, however. He was an important part of the Boston Americans championship 
team of 1904, pitched a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox on August 
17, 1904 (his brother Lee went 0 for three for Chicago) and continued to 
be an above average pitcher until 1907. After this, however, Tannehill 
went into precipitous decline, as he was traded to the Washington Senators 
for Case Patten. Tannehill retired from baseball in 1911, with a career 
ERA of 2.79 and 197 career wins. After retiring as a player, Tannehill 
managed the Portsmouth Truckers of the Virginia League in 1914. He then 
served as an umpire in the Ohio State League, International League, and 
Western League, before returning to the Majors as a coach for the Philadelphia 
Phillies in 1920, a stint that lasted one season. In 1923 he managed the 
Topeka Kaws in the Southwestern League. In his later years, Tannehill worked 
in a Cincinnati machine shop and was a frequent visitor to Crosley Field, 
the home of the Cincinnati Reds from 1912 to 1970. He died of a stroke 
at Speers Hospital in Dayton, Campbell County, Kentucky on September 22,
