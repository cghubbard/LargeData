Robert George Hofman (October 5, 1925 – April 5, 1994) was an American 
infielder, catcher and coach in Major League Baseball. Born in St. Louis, 
Missouri, Hofman threw and batted right-handed, and stood 5'11" (180 cm) 
tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). Hofman's seven-year MLB playing career 
(1949; 1952–57) was spent entirely with the New York Giants. After a 19-game 
trial with them in 1949, Hofman made the Giants to stay in 1952 and was 
a member of their 1954 world championship roster. His managers, Leo Durocher 
and Bill Rigney, used Hofman in a utilityman role and as a right-handed 
pinch hitter off the Giant bench. Over the course of his National League 
career, he would appear in 86 games at second base, 49 games at first base, 
45 contests as a third baseman, and 26 as a catcher. As a hitter, he had 
some power, twice (in 1953 and 1955) reaching double figures in home runs. 
Overall, he appeared in 341 games, batting .248 with 32 home runs in 670 
at bats. From 1958 through 1965, Hofman managed in minor league baseball 
with the San Francisco Giants and Kansas City Athletics organizations. 
In 1966, former teammate Alvin Dark (the shortstop for most of Hofman's 
tenure with the Giants) was named manager of the Athletics, and he added 
Hofman to his coaching staff. Hofman would go on to coach in the American 
League for 12 seasons (1966–72; 1974–78) with the Athletics in both Kansas 
City and Oakland, the Washington Senators and Cleveland Indians. He was 
a coach, under Dark, on Oakland's 1974 world championship team. After his 
coaching career, Hofman briefly was Oakland's traveling secretary and, 
during the 1980s, he served as director of scouting and player development 
of the New York Yankees. He compiled a record of 574 victories and 599 
defeats (.489) as a minor league manager. Hofman died of cancer in Chesterfield,
