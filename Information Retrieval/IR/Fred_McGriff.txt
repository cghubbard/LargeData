Frederick Stanley McGriff (born October 31, 1963) is an American former 
professional baseball first baseman, who played for six Major League Baseball 
(MLB) teams from 1986 through 2004. A power-hitting first baseman, he became 
a five-time All-Star and led both leagues in home runs in separate years 
– the American League in 1989 and the National League in 1992. McGriff 
finished his career with 493 home runs, tied with Hall of Fame player Lou 
Gehrig, and only seven homers away from joining the 500 home run club. 
He won a World Series title as a first baseman with the Atlanta Braves 
in 1995. He currently works in the Atlanta Braves' front office as Special 
Assistant to Baseball Operations.[1] McGriff's nickname, "Crime Dog", one 
of the many humorous nicknames created by sports broadcaster Chris Berman,[2] 
is a play on McGruff, a cartoon dog created for American police to raise 
children's awareness on crime prevention. At first, McGriff stated he would 
prefer "Fire Dog" (a reference to a fire in the press-box of Atlanta–Fulton 
County Stadium the day the Braves acquired him from the Padres; symbolically, 
the then-slumping Braves "caught fire" and ended up winning their division), 
but since has stated that he actually is fond of the "Crime Dog" nickname. 
McGriff was a prospect in the New York Yankees minor league system in the 
early 1980s. He was drafted by the Yankees in the 9th round of the 1981 
amateur draft and signed June 11, 1981. In 1982, the Yankees dealt McGriff, 
Dave Collins and Mike Morgan to the Toronto Blue Jays for Dale Murray and 
Tom Dodd. The trade is now considered one of the most one-sided deals in 
baseball history, and one of the worst in Yankees history. However, it 
appeared to make some sense from the Yankees' perspective, since McGriff 
was blocked from first base by Don Mattingly. Nonetheless, the Yankees 
didn't get nearly enough in return. Murray won only three games in three 
years with the Yankees, and was out of baseball by 1986. Dodd was released 
at the end of the season, and apart from a month with the Baltimore Orioles 
in 1986 spent the remainder of his career in the minors. In 2006, Rob Neyer 
wrote that the trade looked particularly lopsided because it was one of 
the few instances that a player of McGriff's stature was traded before 
getting to the majors.[3] McGriff reached the majors full-time in 1987 
and hit 34 home runs the next year, his first of seven consecutive seasons 
with over 30 homers. McGriff emerged as the top power hitter in the American 
League in 1989, leading the league with 36 home runs, including the first 
at Toronto's SkyDome, helping the Blue Jays win the AL East division title. 
His power numbers remained steady in 1990, as McGriff batted .300 and established 
himself as a consistent producer. On December 5, 1990, McGriff was traded 
to the San Diego Padres with Tony Fernández in exchange for Roberto Alomar 
and Joe Carter – two players who would be integral in Toronto's back-to-back 
World Series titles in 1992 and 1993. His numbers remained consistent in 
the National League, hitting .278/.396/.474 for San Diego in 1991. He made 
his first All-Star appearance the following year and led the NL in home 
runs in 1992, three years after he had accomplished the same feat in the 
AL. On July 18, 1993, the Padres, out of contention and seeking to unload 
their high-priced veterans, dealt McGriff to the Atlanta Braves for prospect 
Vince Moore, Donnie Elliott and Melvin Nieves. McGriff hit a home run in 
his first game with the Braves, who acquired him to replace the struggling 
Sid Bream in at first and provide an offensive spark, and was a key player 
in the Braves' 51-19 finish to overtake the San Francisco Giants and claim 
first place in the National League West for a third consecutive season. 
He finished with a career high 37 homers and fourth place in the NL MVP 
voting. In the strike-shortened 1994 season, McGriff was batting .318 and 
had 34 home runs when play ended in August 1994. He won the All-Star Game 
MVP Award that year after hitting the game-tying home run for the National 
League, after the NL trailed 7–5 in the bottom of the ninth inning. McGriff 
was runner-up to Ken Griffey Jr. in the 1994 Home Run Derby. McGriff remained 
with the Braves in 1995 and continued to be a successful cleanup hitter. 
He hit two home runs in the 1995 World Series en route to his only World 
Series championship ring. McGriff hit .295/.365/.494 with a career-best 
107 RBIs on his way to another World Series appearance in 1996. With 22 
home runs in 1997, McGriff appeared to be in decline. He was called out 
on strikes by umpire Eric Gregg on a pitch 3 feet outside thrown by Liván 
Hernández during the 1997 NLCS, which was the last significant event for 
McGriff as a Brave. The team allowed him to be picked up by the expansion 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays after the season. McGriff, playing for his hometown 
of Tampa, batted .278 with 19 home runs in his first season with the Devil 
Rays. His numbers experienced a minor renaissance in 1999 when he hit .310 
with 32 home runs the following season. After another solid season in 2000, 
McGriff got off to a good start in 2001 and was heavily pursued by the 
contending Chicago Cubs around the trade deadline. He waived his no-trade 
clause to allow himself to be dealt to Chicago on July 27, 2001. He hit 
.282 with 12 homers in 49 games with the Cubs, but the team did not reach 
the postseason. McGriff had 30 home runs during a strong 2002 campaign, 
which earned him a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 
2003 season. Twenty-two homers shy of 500 for his career, the forty-year-old 
McGriff only hit 13 with a .249 batting average and spent a significant 
amount of time on the disabled list. During spring training in 2004, the 
Devil Rays re-signed McGriff in hopes of letting the veteran ballplayer 
hit 500 home runs. He ended up with a .181 average and had hit just two 
home runs in his sporadic play from the end of May until mid-July. The 
Devil Rays released McGriff on July 28, 2004, seven home runs shy of 500. 
Despite the fact that McGriff only played in Tampa Bay late in his career, 
he collected 66 win shares as a Devil Ray, the team's all-time record. 
McGriff was released by the Devil Rays and officially declared his retirement 
during spring training of 2005 when he received no calls from any teams 
requesting his services. He retired with 493 home runs, tied with baseball 
legend Lou Gehrig, and became eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2010. He 
received 21.5% of the vote in his first year of eligibility, falling short 
of the 75% requirement for induction.[4] Over the next four elections, 
McGriff's vote percentage ranged from a high of 23.9% (137 votes) in 2012 
to a low of 11.7% (67 votes) in 2014, however as a player who received 
more than 5.0% of votes cast, McGriff remains eligible for induction by 
the Baseball Writer's Association of America. Excluding those players either 
associated with alleged steroid use and those not yet eligible for the 
Hall of Fame, McGriff has the most career home runs of any player not in 
the Hall of Fame. McGriff ended his career having 10 seasons with at least 
30 home runs. He and Gary Sheffield are the only players ever to hit at 
least 30 home runs in one season for 5 different teams, accomplishing the 
feat with Toronto three times, San Diego twice, and Atlanta, Tampa Bay, 
and the Chicago Cubs once each.[5][6][7] McGriff appeared in commercials 
for Tom Emanski's Baseball Fundamentals training videos in 1991. In the 
ad, McGriff deadpans the merits of the videos while wearing a "Baseball 
World" mesh cap perched high atop his head. The commercials ran for over 
a decade on ESPN, making them some of the longest running commercials on 
television. McGriff is the only current retired recipient of the Wampum
