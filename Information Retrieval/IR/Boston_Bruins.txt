               The Boston Bruins are a professional ice hockey team based 
in Boston. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference 
of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team has been in existence since 
1924, and is the league's third-oldest team and is the oldest in the United 
States. It is also an Original Six franchise, along with the Chicago Blackhawks, 
Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Toronto Maple 
Leafs. The Bruins have won six Stanley Cup championships, tied for fourth 
most of all-time with the Blackhawks and tied second-most of any American 
NHL team also with the Blackhawks (behind the Red Wings, who have 11). 
Their home arena is the TD Garden, where they have played since 1995. The 
Bruins began play in the NHL on December 1, 1924. The first facility to 
host them was what was then known as the Boston Arena (today's Matthews 
Arena) — the world's oldest (built 1909–10) indoor ice hockey facility 
still in use for the sport at any level of competition[2][3] — and following 
the Bruins' departure from the Boston Arena, the team played its home games 
at the Boston Garden for 67 seasons, beginning in 1928 and concluding in 
1995. In 1924,[4] at the convincing of Boston grocery tycoon Charles Adams, 
the National Hockey League decided to expand to the United States. Adams 
had fallen in love with hockey while watching the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals 
between the NHL champion Montreal Canadiens and the WCHL champion Calgary 
Tigers. He persuaded the NHL to grant him a franchise for Boston, which 
occurred on November 1, 1924. With the Montreal Maroons, the team was one 
of the NHL's first expansion teams, and the first NHL team to be based 
in the United States. Adams' first act was to hire Art Ross, a former star 
player and innovator, as general manager. Ross was the face of the franchise 
for the next thirty years, including four separate stints as coach. In 
1924, Adams directed Ross to come up with a nickname for the franchise. 
Arthur Ross picked a name by himself. According to him, a "Bruin" (an Old 
English word used for brown bears (from the Dutch "bruin" meaning brown) 
in classic folk-tales) is "a ferocious animal and alliterative with Boston". 
The background of the Bruins' black and gold colorway dates back to their 
founder. Black and gold were the colors of Adams’ grocery chain (First 
National Stores), which made Boston Bruins' uniforms a spot to advertise 
on.[5] On December 1, 1924, the new Bruins team played their first NHL 
game against the Maroons, at Boston Arena, with the Bruins winning the 
game by a 2–1 score. But the team only managed a 6–24–0 record (for last 
place) in its first season. They played three more seasons at the Arena, 
after which the Bruins became the main tenant of the famous Boston Garden,[6] 
while the old Boston Arena facility — the world's oldest existing indoor 
ice hockey venue still used for the sport at any level of competition, 
and the only surviving rink where an Original Six NHL team began their 
career in the league — was eventually taken over by Northeastern University, 
and renamed Matthews Arena when the university renovated it in 1979. In 
their third season, 1926–27, the team markedly improved. Ross took advantage 
of the collapse of the Western Hockey League to purchase several western 
stars, including the team's first great star, a defenseman from Fort Qu'Appelle, 
Saskatchewan named Eddie Shore. The Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Final 
despite finishing only one game above .500, but lost to the Ottawa Senators 
in the first Cup Final to be between exclusively NHL teams. In 1929 the 
Bruins defeated the New York Rangers to win their first Stanley Cup. Standout 
players on the first championship team included Shore, Harry Oliver, Dit 
Clapper, Dutch Gainor and goaltender Tiny Thompson. The 1928–29 season 
was the first played at Boston Garden, which Adams had built after guaranteeing 
his backers $500,000 in gate receipts over the next five years. The season 
after that, 1929–30, the Bruins posted the best-ever regular season winning 
percentage in the NHL (an astonishing .875, winning 38 out of 44 games, 
a record which still stands) and shattered numerous team scoring records, 
but lost to the Montreal Canadiens in the Cup Final. The 1930s Bruins teams 
included Shore, Thompson, Clapper, Babe Siebert and Cooney Weiland. The 
team led the league's standings five times in the decade. In 1939, the 
team changed its uniform colors from brown and yellow to the current black 
and gold, and captured the second Stanley Cup in franchise history. That 
year, Thompson was traded for rookie goaltender Frank Brimsek. Brimsek 
had an award-winning season, capturing the Vezina and Calder Trophies, 
becoming the first rookie named to the NHL First All-Star Team, and earning 
the nickname "Mr. Zero." The team skating in front of Brimsek included 
Bill Cowley, Shore, Clapper and "Sudden Death" Mel Hill (who scored three 
overtime goals in one playoff series), together with the "Kraut Line" of 
center Milt Schmidt, right winger Bobby Bauer and left winger Woody Dumart. 
In 1940 Shore was traded to the struggling New York Americans for his final 
NHL season. In 1941 the Bruins won their third Stanley Cup after losing 
only eight games and finishing first in the regular season. It was their 
last Stanley Cup for 29 years. World War II affected the Bruins more than 
most teams; Brimsek and the "Krauts" all enlisted after the 1940–41 Cup 
win, and lost the most productive years of their careers at war. Cowley, 
assisted by veteran player Clapper and Busher Jackson, was the team's remaining 
star. Even though the NHL had by 1943 been reduced to the six teams that 
would in the modern era be called the "Original Six", talent was depleted 
enough that freak seasons could take place, as in 1944, when Bruin Herb 
Cain would set the then-NHL record for points in a season with 82. But 
the Bruins did not make the playoffs that season, and Cain was out of the 
NHL two seasons later. The stars returned for the 1945–46 season, and Clapper 
led the team back to the Stanley Cup Final as player-coach. He retired 
as a player after the next season, becoming the first player to play twenty 
NHL seasons, but stayed on as coach for two more years. Brimsek proved 
to be not as good as he was before the war, and after 1946 the Bruins lost 
in the first playoff round three straight years, resulting in Clapper's 
resignation. Brimsek was traded to the last-place Chicago Black Hawks in 
1949, followed by the unexpected lifetime ban of promising young star Don 
Gallinger on suspicion of gambling. The only remaining quality young player 
who stayed with the team for any length was forward Johnny Peirson, recognizable 
to fans of a later era as the Bruins' television color commentator in the 
1970s. During the 1948–49 season, the original form of the "spoked-B" logo, 
with a small number "24" to the left of the capital B signifying the calendar 
year in the 20th century in which the Bruins team first played, and a similarly 
small "49" to the right of the "B", for the then-current season's calendar 
year in the 20th century,[7] appeared on their home uniforms—a nod to the 
Boston area's nickname of "The Hub". The following season, the logo was 
modified into the basic "spoked-B" form that was to be used, virtually 
unchanged (except for certain proportions within the logo), through the 
1993–94 season. The 1950s began with Charles Adams' son Weston (who had 
been team president since 1936) facing financial trouble. He was forced 
to accept a buyout offer from Walter A. Brown, the owner of the National 
Basketball Association's Boston Celtics and the Garden, in 1951. Although 
there were some instances of success (such as making the Stanley Cup Final 
in 1953, 1957 and 1958, only to lose to the Montreal Canadiens each time), 
the Bruins mustered only four winning seasons between 1947 and 1967. They 
missed the playoffs eight straight years between 1960 and 1967. In 1954, 
on New Year's Day, Robert Skrak, an assistant to Frank Zamboni, the inventor 
of the best known ice resurfacing machine of the time, demonstrated a very 
early model of the machine at Boston Garden to the team management, and 
as a result, the Bruins ordered one of the then-produced "Model E" resurfacers 
to be used at the Garden, the first known NHL team to acquire one of the 
soon-to-be-ubiquitous "Zambonis" for their own use. The Bruins' Zamboni 
Model E, factory serial number 21—used as late as the 1980s on an emergency 
basis—eventually ended up in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto in 1988 
for preservation.[8] On January 18, 1958, a milestone in NHL history occurred 
as the first black person ever to play in the NHL stepped onto the ice 
for the Bruins, New Brunswick-born left wing Willie O'Ree. He played in 
45 games for the Bruins over the 1957–58 and 1960–61 seasons, scoring six 
goals and ten assists in his NHL career. During this period, the farm system 
of the Bruins was not as expansive or well-developed as most of the other 
five teams. The Bruins sought players not protected by the other teams, 
and in like fashion to the aforementioned signing of Willie O'Ree, the 
team signed Tommy Williams from the 1960 Olympic-gold medal winning American 
national men's hockey team—at the time the only American player in the 
NHL—in 1962. The "Uke Line"—named for the Ukrainian heritage of Johnny 
Bucyk, Vic Stasiuk and Bronco Horvath — came to Boston in 1957 and enjoyed 
four productive offensive seasons, heralding, along with scoring stalwarts 
Don McKenney and Fleming MacKell, the successful era of the late 1950s. 
There followed a long and difficult reconstruction period in the early, 
mid-1960s. Weston Adams repurchased the Bruins in 1964 after Brown's death 
and set about rebuilding the team. Adams signed a defenseman from Parry 
Sound, Ontario, named Bobby Orr, who entered the league in 1966 and became, 
in the eyes of many, the greatest player of all time. He was announced 
that season's winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy for Rookie of the Year 
and named to the Second NHL All-Star Team. When asked about Orr's NHL debut 
game, October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, then-Bruins coach 
Harry Sinden recalled: The Bruins then obtained young forwards Phil Esposito, 
Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield from Chicago in a deal celebrated as one of 
the most one-sided in hockey history. Hodge and Stanfield became key elements 
of the Bruins' success, and Esposito, who centered a line with Hodge and 
Wayne Cashman, became the league's top goal-scorer and the first NHL player 
to break the 100-point mark, setting many goal- and point-scoring records. 
Esposito remains one of four players to win the Art Ross Trophy four consecutive 
seasons (the other three are Jaromir Jagr, Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe). 
With other stars like forwards Bucyk, John McKenzie, Derek Sanderson, and 
Hodge, steady defenders like Dallas Smith and goaltender Gerry Cheevers, 
the "Big Bad Bruins" became one of the league's top teams from the late 
1960s into the 1980s. In 1970, a 29-year Stanley Cup drought came to an 
end in Boston, as the Bruins defeated the St. Louis Blues in four games 
in the Final. Orr scored the game-winning goal in overtime to clinch the 
Stanley Cup. The same season was Orr's most awarded—the third of eight 
consecutive years he won the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the top defenseman 
in the NHL—and he won the Art Ross Trophy, the Conn Smythe Trophy and the 
Hart Memorial Trophy, the only player to ever win four major awards in 
the same season. "No one, absolutely no one, could have finished a goal 
in like manner. For years Orr had been described as someone who was graceful, 
elegant, powerful, without fear—poetry in motion. All these epithets were 
captured and immortalized in the photos of the goal that won the 1970 Stanley 
Cup."[10] The 1970–71 season was, in retrospect, the high-water mark of 
the 1970s for Boston. While Sinden temporarily retired from hockey to enter 
business (he was replaced by ex-Bruin and Canadien defenseman Tom Johnson), 
the Bruins set dozens of offensive scoring records: they had seven of the 
league's top ten scorers—a feat not achieved before or since—set the record 
for wins in a season, and in a league that had never seen a 100-point scorer 
before 1969, the Bruins had four that year. All four (Orr, Esposito, Bucyk 
and Hodge) were named First Team All-Stars, a feat matched in the expansion 
era only by the 1976–77 Canadiens. Boston were favored to repeat as Cup 
champions, but ran into a roadblock in the playoffs. Up 5–1 at one point 
in game two of the quarter-finals against the Canadiens (and rookie goaltender 
Ken Dryden), the Bruins squandered the lead to lose 7–5. The Bruins never 
recovered and lost the series in seven games. While the Bruins were not 
quite as dominant the next season (although only three points behind the 
1971 pace), Esposito and Orr were once again one-two in the scoring standings 
(followed by Bucyk in ninth place) and they regained the Stanley Cup by 
defeating the New York Rangers in six games in the Finals. Rangers blueliner 
Brad Park, who came runner-up to Orr's (then) five-year monopoly on the 
Norris Trophy, said, "Bobby Orr was—didn't make—the difference." The 1972–73 
season saw upheaval at the Bruins. Former head coach Sinden became the 
general manager. Bruins players Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson and Johnny 
McKenzie left to join the upstart World Hockey Association.[11] Coach Tom 
Johnson was fired 52 games into the season, replaced by Bep Guidolin, who 
had once coached Orr. The Adams family, which had owned the team since 
its founding in the 1920s, sold it to Storer Broadcasting. The Bruins' 
season came to a premature end in a first-round loss to the Rangers in 
the 1973 playoffs, losing Esposito to injury in that first round.[12] In 
1974, the Bruins regained their first place standing in the regular season, 
with three 100-point scorers on the team (Esposito, Orr, and Hodge). However 
they lost the 1974 Final in an upset to the Philadelphia Flyers. Don Cherry 
stepped behind the bench as the new coach in 1974–75. The Bruins stocked 
themselves with enforcers and grinders, and remained competitive under 
Cherry's reign, the so-called "Lunch Pail A.C"., behind players such as 
Gregg Sheppard, Terry O'Reilly, Stan Jonathan, and Peter McNab. This would 
also turn out to be Orr's final full season in the league, before his knee 
injuries worsened, as well as the last time Orr and Esposito would finish 
1-2 in regular season scoring. The Bruins placed second in the Adams Division, 
and lost to the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round of the 1975 playoffs, 
losing a best-of-three series, two games to one. Continuing with Cherry's 
rebuilding of the team, the Bruins traded Esposito and Carol Vadnais for 
Brad Park, Jean Ratelle and Joe Zanussi to the Rangers. That trade was 
particularly controversial for both Bruins and Rangers fans, as Esposito 
was one of the most popular Bruins players (though it was known he disagreed 
with Cherry's coaching), while Park and Ratelle were Rangers stalwarts.[13] 
However, Boston ended up getting the better of the trade, as Esposito never 
reached his previous scoring highs with the Rangers, while Ratelle maintained 
his skill level with the Bruins and was a high scorer for several years 
more. Particularly, it was Park who reemerged as one of the league's best 
defencemen and filled the void left by Orr, who had been sidelined by surgery 
at the start of 1975–76 and only managed to play ten games before being 
injured and lost for the rest of the season.[14] The Bruins made the semi-finals 
again, losing to the Flyers. As an impending free agent, contract talks 
with Orr and his agent Alan Eagleson had been tumultuous throughout 1975–76. 
Although insurers would not underwrite Orr and doctors advised he could 
not play much longer, the Bruins still attempted to re-sign Orr and offered 
him a five-year deal at US$925,000, or 18.6 percent ownership of the club 
in 1980. However, Eagleson turned down the offer without informing Orr, 
instead signing him to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1976; Orr was never effective 
— having only played 26 games in Chicago — and retired after many knee 
operations in 1979. Cheevers returned from the WHA in 1977, and the Bruins 
got past the Flyers in the semifinals, but they were swept by the Canadiens 
in the Stanley Cup Finals. The story repeated itself in 1978—with a balanced 
attack that saw Boston have eleven players with 20+ goal seasons, still 
the NHL record—as the Bruins made the Final once more, but lost in six 
games to the Canadiens team that had recorded the best regular season in 
modern history. After that series, Johnny Bucyk retired, holding virtually 
every Bruins' career longevity and scoring mark to that time. The 1979 
semi-final series against the Habs proved to be Cherry's undoing. In the 
deciding seventh game, the Bruins, up by a goal, were called for having 
too many men on the ice in the late stages of the third period. Montreal 
tied the game on the ensuing power play and won in overtime. Never popular 
with Harry Sinden, by then the Bruins' general manager, Cherry was dismissed 
as head coach but was later hired in the same capacity with the Colorado 
Rockies. At Madison Square Garden on December 23, 1979, just after the 
Bruins beat the New York Rangers 4-3, John Kaptain, a Rangers fan from 
New Jersey, stole Stan Jonathan's stick and hit him with it during a post-game 
scrum. When other fans got involved, Terry O'Reilly charged into the stands 
followed by his teammates. During the fight, Bruin defenseman and future 
NBC hockey analyst Mike Milbury famously pulled off Kaptain's shoe and 
hit him with it. O'Reilly, a future team captain, received an eight-game 
suspension for the brawl, while Milbury and McNab were suspended for six 
games and the entire team except for Cheevers was fined $500, while Kaptain 
was sentenced to six months in prison.[15][16] In 2012, TSN named the fight, 
entitled "Milbury and The Shoe", as #4 on its Top 10 Craziest Hockey Moments.[17] 
The 1979 season saw new Head Coach Fred Creighton—himself replaced by the 
newly retired Cheevers the following year. The Bruins trade of Ron Grahame 
to the Los Angeles Kings for a first round pick, that turned out to be 
eighth overall, enabled the Bruins to draft Ray Bourque, one of the greatest 
defensemen of all-time and the face of the Bruins for over two decades.[21] 
The Bruins made the playoffs every year through the 1980s behind stars 
such as Park, Bourque and Rick Middleton—and had the league's best record 
in 1983 behind a Vezina Trophy–winning season from ex-Flyer goaltender 
Pete Peeters—but always fell short of making the Finals. Bourque, Cam Neely 
and Keith Crowder led the Bruins to another Cup Final appearance in 1988 
against the Edmonton Oilers.[22] The Bruins lost in a four-game sweep, 
but a memorable moment in the would-be fourth game ensued, when in the 
second period with the game tied 3–3, a blown fuse put the lights out at 
the Boston Garden. The rest of the game was cancelled and the series shifted 
to Edmonton. The Oilers completed the sweep, 6–3, back at Northlands Coliseum 
in Edmonton in what was originally scheduled as Game Five. The event is 
considered to be the reason the Bruins began work on a new arena. Boston 
returned to the Stanley Cup Final in 1990 (with Neely, Bourque, Craig Janney, 
Bobby Carpenter, and rookie Don Sweeney, and former Oiler goalie Andy Moog 
and Reggie Lemelin splitting goaltending duties), but again lost to the 
Oilers, this time in five games. In the 1987–88 NHL season — when the Bruins 
finally broke the Canadiens' 57-year-long (1930–87) playoff win streak 
against them — through the 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1994 seasons, the Bruins 
began to amass a playoff series winning streak of their own, in defeating 
their Original Six nemesis Montreal Canadiens in the playoffs, getting 
some revenge for a rivalry which had been lopsided in the Canadiens' favour 
in playoff action, with Montreal having won 18 consecutive playoff series 
against the Bruins between 1946 and 1987. In 1991 and 1992, the Bruins 
suffered two consecutive Conference Final losses to the eventual Cup champion, 
the Mario Lemieux–led Pittsburgh Penguins. Starting from the 1992–93 NHL 
season onwards, the Bruins had not gotten past the second round of the 
playoffs until winning the Stanley Cup after the 2011 season. The 1992–93 
season ended disappointingly for several reasons. Despite finishing with 
the second-best regular season record after Pittsburgh, Boston was swept 
in the first-round by the Buffalo Sabres. During the post-season awards 
ceremony, Bruin players finished as runner-up on many of the honors—Bourque 
for the Norris, Oates for the Art Ross and Lady Byng Trophy, Joe Juneau 
(who had broken the NHL record for assists in a season by a left-winger, 
a mark he still holds) for the Calder Trophy, Dave Poulin for the Frank 
J. Selke Trophy, Moog for the William M. Jennings Trophy and coach Brian 
Sutter for the Jack Adams Award. Poulin did win the King Clancy Memorial 
Trophy, while Bourque made the NHL All-Star First Team and Juneau the NHL 
All-Rookie Team. The 1995 season would be the Bruins' last at the Boston 
Garden. The final official match played in the Garden was a 3–0 loss to 
the New Jersey Devils in the 1995 playoffs; the Bruins went on to play 
the final game at the fabled arena on September 28, 1995, in an exhibition 
matchup against the Canadiens. They subsequently moved into the FleetCenter, 
now known as the TD Garden. In the 1996 playoffs, the Bruins lost their 
first-round series to the Florida Panthers in five games. In 1997, Boston 
missed the playoffs for the first time in 30 years (and for the first time 
in the expansion era), having set the North American major professional 
record for most consecutive seasons in the playoffs. The Bruins lost in 
the first round of the 1998 playoffs to the Washington Capitals in six 
games. In 1999, the Bruins defeated the Carolina Hurricanes in six games 
during the first round of the playoffs; nevertheless, they would lose to 
the Sabres in six games in the second round of the playoffs. Historically, 
their most bitter rivals have been the Montreal Canadiens, whom the Bruins 
have played a record 34 times in the playoffs. The Bruins were formerly 
rivals to the now relocated Hartford Whalers. In the 1999–2000 season, 
the Bruins finished in last place in the Northeast Division and failed 
to qualify for the playoffs. During a game between the Bruins and the Vancouver 
Canucks on February 21, 2000, Marty McSorley was ejected for using his 
stick to hit Canucks forward Donald Brashear in the head. McSorely was 
initially suspended for the remaining 23 games of the season. However, 
on October 6, McSorely was convicted of assault using a weapon for his 
attack on Brashear; he was then sentenced to 18 months of probation. As 
a result of the conviction, McSorley's suspension was extended through 
February 21, 2001. After a 3–4–1 start, the Bruins fired head coach Pat 
Burns and went with Mike Keenan for the rest of the way. Despite a 15-point 
improvement from the previous season, the Bruins missed the playoffs in 
2000–01 by just one point, and Keenan was let go. Centerman Jason Allison 
led the Bruins in scoring. The following season, 2001–02, the Bruins improved 
again with another 13 points, winning their first Northeast Division title 
since 1993 with a core built around Joe Thornton, Sergei Samsonov, Brian 
Rolston, Bill Guerin, Mike Knuble and the newly acquired Glen Murray. Their 
regular season success did not translate to the post-season, however, as 
they lost in six games to the underdog eighth-place Montreal Canadiens 
in the first round. The 2002–03 season found the Bruins platooning their 
goaltending staff between Steve Shields and John Grahame for most of the 
season. A mid-season trade brought in veteran Jeff Hackett. In the midst 
of a late-season slump, General Manager Mike O'Connell fired head coach 
Robbie Ftorek with nine games to go and named himself interim coach. The 
Bruins managed to finish seventh in the East, but lost to the eventual 
Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in five games. In 2003–04, the Bruins 
began the season with ex-Toronto Maple Leaf goalie Felix Potvin. Later 
in the season, the Bruins put rookie Andrew Raycroft into the starting 
role. Raycroft eventually won the Calder Trophy that season. The Bruins 
went on to win another division title and appeared to get past the first 
round for the first time in five years with a 3–1 series lead on the rival 
Canadiens. The Canadiens rallied back, however, to win three straight games, 
upsetting the Bruins. The 2004–05 NHL season was wiped out by a lockout, 
and the Bruins had a lot of space within the new salary cap implemented 
for 2005–06. Bruins management eschewed younger free agents in favor of 
older veterans such as Alexei Zhamnov and Brian Leetch. The newcomers were 
oft-injured, and by the end of November, the Bruins team traded their captain 
and franchise player, Joe Thornton (who went on to win the Art Ross and 
Hart Trophies). In exchange, the Bruins received Marco Sturm, Brad Stuart 
and Wayne Primeau from the San Jose Sharks. After losing 10 of 11 games 
before the trade, the Bruins came back with a 3–0 victory over the league-leading 
Ottawa Senators, as rookie goaltender Hannu Toivonen earned his first career 
NHL shutout. When Toivonen went down with an injury in January, journeyman 
goalie Tim Thomas started 16-straight games and brought the Bruins back 
into the playoff run. Two points out of eighth place at the Winter Olympic 
break, the Bruins fired General Manager Mike O'Connell in March and the 
Bruins missed the playoffs for the first time in five years. Peter Chiarelli 
was hired as the new GM of the team. Head coach Mike Sullivan was fired 
and Dave Lewis, former coach of the Detroit Red Wings, was hired to replace 
him. The Bruins signed Zdeno Chara, one of the most coveted defensemen 
in the NHL and a former NHL All-Star, from the Ottawa Senators, and Marc 
Savard, who finished just three points short of a 100-point season in 2005–06 
with the Atlanta Thrashers, to long-term deals. The 2006–07 season ended 
in the team finishing in last place in the division. The Bruins traded 
Brad Stuart and Wayne Primeau to the Calgary Flames for Andrew Ference 
and forward Chuck Kobasew. After the disappointing 2007 season, Lewis was 
fired as coach, and the Bruins announced on June 21, 2007, that former 
Canadiens/Devils head coach Claude Julien had been named as the new head 
coach.[23] The Bruins also unveiled a new logo and a brand new shoulder 
patch closely based on the main jersey logo used until 1932.[24] The 2008 
campaign saw the Bruins regain some respectability, finishing 41–29–12 
and making the playoffs. The season ended on a bright note for the Bruins 
when they forced the Montreal Canadiens to play a seven-game playoff series, 
including a memorable Game 6 in which Boston came back to win 5–4. Their 
performance, despite a 5–0 loss in the seventh game, rekindled interest 
in the team in New England, where the Bruins had for years been heavily 
overshadowed by the Red Sox, Patriots and Celtics, all of whom had recently 
won championships in their respective leagues. Although Bruins center Patrice 
Bergeron was injured with a concussion most of the season, youngsters Milan 
Lucic, David Krejci, Vladimir Sobotka and Petteri Nokelainen showed promise 
in the playoffs. After a slow start to the 2008–09 season, the Bruins won 
17 of their next 20 games, leading many to see them as a revival of the 
"Big Bad Bruins" from the 1970s and 1980s. During the 2009 All-Star Weekend's 
Skills Competition, captain Zdeno Chara fired the NHL's then-fastest measured 
"hardest shot" ever, with a clocked in speed of 105.4 mph (169.7 km/h) 
velocity. (Chara has since broken his own record three times, two of those 
on the same night.) The number of injured players in the season saw many 
call-ups from the Bruins' American Hockey League (AHL) Providence Bruins 
farm team, with rookie defenseman Matt Hunwick and forward Byron Bitz seeing 
success. The Bruins went on to have the best record in the Eastern Conference 
and qualified for the playoffs for the fifth time in nine years, facing 
the Canadiens in the playoffs for the fourth time during that span, defeating 
them in four games before losing in seven games to the Carolina Hurricanes 
in the conference semi-finals. The 2009 summer off-season saw the departure 
of long-time defensive forward P. J. Axelsson from Sweden, who signed a 
multi-year contract[25] with his hometown Frölunda HC team. With Toronto 
Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke threatening an offer sheet and 
Bruins management unable to meet his salary demands, forward Phil Kessel 
was traded to Toronto for a trio of future draft picks. On January 1, 2010, 
the Bruins won the 2010 NHL Winter Classic over the Philadelphia Flyers 
in a 2–1 overtime decision at Fenway Park, thus becoming the first home 
team to win an outdoor classic game. However, following the New Year's 
Day game, the Bruins, hobbled by injuries, would go through a five-week-long 
period of lackluster play, with only two wins and compiling ten regulation 
losses earning them only eight points in the Eastern Conference standings 
in that 15-game long period, before breaking the losing streak in an away 
game against the Canadiens on February 7, with Tuukka Rask shutting out 
the Habs 3–0. The win over the Canadiens was the first of four successive 
victories leading into the break in play for the NHL's participation in 
the 2010 Winter Olympics, and established Tuukka Rask as the number one 
goaltender for the Bruins, as Tim Thomas would only start eight of the 
22 games remaining in the post-Olympic period of the season, with Rask 
winning eight of his post-Olympic starts, including two shutouts. Thomas 
was on the silver medal-winning U.S. team, with Patrice Bergeron on the 
gold medal-winning Canadian team. The importance of former Buffalo Sabres 
forward Daniel Paille's acquisition by the Bruins, and his emergence as 
a penalty-killing forward, was emphasized on April 10, 2010, as Paille, 
Steve Begin and Blake Wheeler combined for the first-ever known trio of 
short handed goals within one penalty kill, in only 1:04 of game time, 
in a home game against the Carolina Hurricanes, helping the Bruins to sixth 
place in the NHL Eastern Conference, and a 2010 NHL playoff opening round 
appearance against the Buffalo Sabres, which they won 4–2. Boston became 
only the third team in NHL history to lose a playoff series after leading 
3–0 when they lost in Game 7 to the Philadelphia Flyers after losing a 
3–0 lead in the second round on May 14, 2010, also losing the services 
of Marco Sturm in the first game and playmaking center David Krejci to 
injury in the third game of the series. On April 13, 2010, the Boston Bruins 
received the second overall draft pick for the 2010 NHL Draft, having received 
it via the trade that sent Phil Kessel to the Toronto Maple Leafs. With 
the pick, the Bruins selected Tyler Seguin on June 25, 2010. In other off-season 
moves, Greg Campbell and Nathan Horton joined the team, and Vladimir Sobotka 
and Dennis Wideman left the Bruins in the 2010 free agency. After the season 
ended on June 16, 2010, Cam Neely was named the new team president of the 
Bruins.[26] On February 15, 2011, the Bruins acquired center Chris Kelly 
from the Ottawa Senators after Marc Savard's attempted comeback ended due 
to another concussion; this one delivered in Colorado by former Bruin Matt 
Hunwick. Ottawa received the Bruins' second-round pick in 2011. Just two 
days later and on the brink of the trade deadline, the Bruins acquired 
defenseman Tomas Kaberle in a trade from the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange 
for prospect Joe Colborne, a first round selection in 2011, and a potential 
second round pick in 2012 (which became official on May 27 when the Bruins 
clinched a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals). Mark Stuart and Blake Wheeler 
were also traded to the Atlanta Thrashers for Rich Peverley and Boris Valabik. 
In the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Bruins became the first team in NHL 
history to win a seven-game series without scoring a power-play goal, as 
they eliminated the Montreal Canadiens in seven games, and also won their 
first playoff series after trailing 2–0. On May 6, the Bruins swept the 
Philadelphia Flyers in four games to advance to the Eastern Conference 
Finals for the first time since 1992. Boston then defeated the Tampa Bay 
Lightning in seven games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the 
first time since 1990 to face the Vancouver Canucks. The Bruins lost the 
first two games of the series in very close contests, 1–0, on a goal with 
less than 19 seconds left in regulation, and then 3–2 in overtime. Game 
3 did not start well for the Bruins either, as they lost Nathan Horton 
to injury at the 5:07 mark of the first period following a late hit by 
Canucks defenseman Aaron Rome that left Horton prone on the ice for nearly 
10 minutes. Despite losing Horton to a devastating hit, the Bruins defeated 
the Canucks, with four goals in each of the second and third periods, twice 
scoring short-handed goals, and going on to win, 8–1. It was the highest 
score by one team, and largest winning margin, in a Finals game since 1996. 
Game 4 saw the Bruins defeating the Canucks in a 4–0 shutout. The home 
team continued to be the winner, with Game 5 in Vancouver going to the 
Canucks in a 1–0 shutout, then Game 6 going to the Bruins, who staved off 
elimination with a 5–2 defeat of the Canucks. The Bruins set a new record 
for the quickest four goals ever in a playoff series game, scoring in only 
4:14 of game time in the first period of Game 6. Game 7, which was played 
in Vancouver on June 15, was the first time the Bruins have ever played 
in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. The Bruins shut out Vancouver 4–0 
after two goals each from Bergeron and Marchand, winning the sixth Stanley 
Cup in franchise history and breaking a 39-year Cup drought. The 2010–11 
Bruins were the first team in NHL history to win a Game 7 three times in 
the same playoff run. The championship also meant that all four Boston 
teams had won their respective championships at least once in the previous 
decade after the Red Sox won two World Series, the Patriots won three Super 
Bowls and the Celtics recaptured an NBA championship. Following the Stanley 
Cup Finals, Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy ranked all seven championships 
during the decade and ranked the Bruins' 2011 Stanley Cup triumph as third, 
behind only the Patriots winning Super Bowl XXXVI (second) and the Red 
Sox winning the 2004 World Series (first, breaking the "Curse of the Bambino".)[27] 
Following their Stanley Cup win, the Bruins lost Mark Recchi to retirement, 
and Michael Ryder and Tomas Kaberle to free agency. The Bruins tweaked 
their roster by adding defenseman Joe Corvo and forward Benoit Pouliot. 
The Bruins' short summer took its toll early, going 3–7–0 in the month 
of October, before responding with a 21–3–1 record to cap off 2011, highlighted 
by a near-perfect November in which the team did not lose in regulation. 
Sophomore forward Tyler Seguin shone the brightest during the streak, eventually 
paving the way for his first All-Star Game selection, joining teammates 
Zdeno Chara and Tim Thomas on Team Chara. On January 23, Thomas caused 
a stir by not attending the Bruins' visit to the White House, saying the 
government had "grown out of control." After an 8–4–1 record to begin 2012, 
the Bruins' inconsistent form resurfaced for much of February and March, 
during which they endured key injuries to Nathan Horton (concussion) and 
Tuukka Rask (groin), and an impotent power play. At the February 27 trading 
deadline they traded for Greg Zanon, Mike Mottau and one-time Bruin Brian 
Rolston, then signed goalie Marty Turco to add goaltending depth. The Bruins 
went on to finish second in the Eastern Conference with 102 points, winning 
the Northeast Division title. They faced the Washington Capitals in the 
first round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs. In a seven-game series which 
all of the games were decided by only one goal, the Bruins came up short 
against rookie goalie Braden Holtby and head coach Dale Hunter's defensive-minded 
game plan. The seventh game saw Joel Ward deflect the series-winning goal 
past Tim Thomas in overtime to give the Capitals the victory and end the 
Bruins' season. During the off-season preceding the lockout, Tim Thomas 
made his decision to sit out the 2012–13 season. General Manager Peter 
Chiarelli confirmed Thomas' decision. Thomas was first suspended for not 
reporting to training camp, then his rights were traded to the New York 
Islanders on February 7. The Bruins decided to go with the goaltending 
pair of Tuukka Rask and Anton Khudobin for the season. Meanwhile, highly 
touted prospect Dougie Hamilton was promoted to the main roster after spending 
a season in the juniors. The Bruins battled the Montreal Canadiens for 
leadership in the Northeast Division all season, before a loss to the Ottawa 
Senators in a make-up game following the Boston Marathon bombing on April 
28 gave the Canadiens the division title. Boston settled for fourth place 
in the Eastern Conference standings with 62 points. On April 2, the Bruins 
acquired former All-Star Jaromir Jagr from the Dallas Stars, after failing 
to acquire Jarome Iginla from the Calgary Flames. Jagr would end up being 
a winger for the Patrice Bergeron–Brad Marchand forward line, as usual 
winger Tyler Seguin was transferred to the third line with Chris Kelly 
and Rich Peverley, to give a more even scoring threat across all four forward 
lines for the Bruins. In the opening round of the 2013 playoffs, the Bruins 
took on the Toronto Maple Leafs. After leading the series 3–1 with a pair 
of wins in Toronto, the Maple Leafs won Games 5 and 6 to force Game 7 in 
Boston. Toronto led 4–1 in the third period of the decider, before the 
Bruins came back late with three goals. A goal from Nathan Horton 9:18 
into the period cut the deficit to two, but the Bruins were unable to cut 
more into the lead until late in the period, when Milan Lucic and Patrice 
Bergeron scored at 18:38 and 19:09 respectively with the goalie pulled 
to tie the game at four. Bergeron would score again in overtime, netting 
the series winner to eliminate the Maple Leafs. Boston's Game 7 win marked 
the first time a team came back from a three-goal deficit in the third 
period to win a playoff game. In the second round, Boston led 3–0 against 
the New York Rangers before winning the series in five games. Boston then 
defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals in a 
four-game sweep to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. In the Final, they 
faced the Chicago Blackhawks, another Original Six team. The Bruins fell 
in six games, with three going into overtime, including an epic Game 1 
in which a third overtime period was needed before it was settled. The 
only game Boston lost by more than one goal was Game 5 in which Chicago 
scored on an empty net in the last 17 seconds. The 2013 Stanley Cup run 
by the Bruins was one that further united the New England region that had 
been rocked by tragedies, such as the Boston Marathon bombing and the Sandy 
Hook Elementary School shooting. Coach Claude Julien said after the deciding 
Game 6, "You know, at the end of the day, I think that's what hurts the 
most is in the back of our minds, although we needed to focus on our team 
and doing what was going to be the best thing for our team to win a Stanley 
Cup, in the back of our minds we wanted to do it for those kind of reasons, 
the City of Boston, what Newtown has been through, that kind of stuff. 
It hit close to home, and the best way we felt we could try and cheer the 
area was to win a Stanley Cup. I think that's what's hard right now for 
the players. We had more reasons than just ourselves to win a Cup." In 
the 2013–14 season, the Bruins won the Presidents' Trophy after finishing 
first in the newly formed Atlantic Division with a record of 54–19–9 for 
117 points. Their regular season success, however, would not translate 
into another Eastern Conference Finals appearance. Despite winning their 
first-round series against the Detroit Red Wings, the team fell to the 
Canadiens in seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals during the 
2014 playoffs. In the 2014–15 season, the Bruins finished with a record 
of 41–27–14 for 96 points, missing out on the playoffs by just two points 
after the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Ottawa Senators clinched the final 
two playoff spots in the East. The Bruins therefore became only the third 
team to miss the playoffs after winning the Presidents' Trophy in the previous 
season. The 96 points they earned that season broke the record for the 
most points earned by a team that did not make the playoffs; the Colorado 
Avalanche finished with 95 points in the 2006–07, which was the previous 
record. On April 15, 2015, Chiarelli was fired by the Boston Bruins. On 
May 20, the Bruins named former player Don Sweeney as the team's new general 
manager for the 2015–16 season. One recent all-time franchise achievement 
the Bruins attained in the 2015–16 season is shared by only their greatest 
rival, the Canadiens – a total of 3,000 wins in the team's existence, achieved 
by the Bruins on January 8, 2016 in a 4–1 road victory against the New 
Jersey Devils.[28] The team was seen as a playoff contender throughout 
the regular season. However, a sub-.500 record on home ice and frequent 
road losses in the final two months of the regular season resulted in a 
three-way battle for the final playoff spot in the East. The Bruins had 
a chance to clinch the final playoff berth with a win over the Ottawa Senators 
on the second-to-last day of the season, but they lost the game. That loss, 
combined with a Flyers' win over the Penguins, knocked the Bruins out of 
playoff contention in favor of the Flyers. For the first time since the 
two seasons following the 2004–05 lockout, the Bruins did not qualify for 
the playoffs in two consecutive seasons. Team founder Charles Adams owned 
the team until 1936, when he transferred his stock his son Weston Adams, 
general manager and minority owner Art Ross and minority owner Ralph Burkard.[29] 
Weston Adams remained majority owner until 1951, when the Boston Garden-Arena 
Corporation purchased controlling interest in the team.[30] Under the Garden-Arena 
Corporation's management, Boston Celtics founder Walter A. Brown ran the 
team from 1951 until his death in 1964. After Brown's death, Weston Adams 
returned to the role of team president. In 1969, he was succeeded by his 
son, Weston Adams, Jr.[31] On December 7, 1973, Storer Broadcasting, owner 
of WSBK-TV, and the Garden-Arena Corporation agreed to a merger which resulted 
in Storer acquiring a 100% interest in the Bruins. Adams remained as team 
president.[32] In August 1975, Storer Broadcasting then sold the team to 
an ownership group headed by Jeremy Jacobs. Jacobs had to promise to keep 
Bobby Orr as a condition of the purchase.[33] The Bruins and Orr reached 
a verbal agreement with Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial 
agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing 
days were over. The agreement was to be checked out as to whether it would 
be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the League would approve it. 
However, Orr's agent, the later-notorious Alan Eagleson, rejected the deal.[34] 
Jacobs represents the club on the NHL's Board of Governors, and serves 
on its Executive Committee, and he has chaired the Finance Committee. At 
the NHL Board of Governors meeting in June 2007, Jacobs was elected chairman 
of the Board, replacing the Calgary Flames' Harley Hotchkiss, who stepped 
down after 12 years in the position. Jacobs has frequently been listed 
by the Sports Business Journal as one of the most influential people in 
sports in its annual poll[35] and by Hockey News.[36] His company owns 
TD Garden and he is partners with John Henry, owner of Major League Baseball's 
Boston Red Sox, in the New England Sports Network (NESN). After taking 
over as owner in 1975, the Bruins have been competitive (making the playoffs 
for 29-straight seasons from 1967–68 to 1995–96, 20 of which were with 
Jacobs as owner) but have won the Stanley Cup only once, in 2011 and only 
in his 36th year as owner. Under previous ownerships, the Bruins had won 
the Stanley Cup five times. Under Jacobs, the Bruins have reached the Stanley 
Cup Final six times (twice against the Bruins' arch-rival Montreal Canadiens 
in 1977 and 1978, twice against the Edmonton Oilers in 1988 and 1990, finally 
winning in 2011 against the Vancouver Canucks, and losing in 2013 to the 
Chicago Blackhawks). Jacobs' management of the team in the past earned 
him spots on ESPN.com's "Page 2" polls of "The Worst Owners in Sports,"[37] 
and No.7 on their 2005 "Greediest Owners In sports" list.[38] Sports Illustrated 
has suggested longtime star defenseman Ray Bourque, who "often drawn the 
ire of the NHLPA for his willingness to re-sign with Boston with minimal 
negotiations over the years" instead of setting the "watermark for defenseman 
salaries", requested and received a trade in 2000 since the team's "hardline 
and spendthrift ways" meant he would have to make the move to get his elusive 
Stanley Cup (Bourque holds the record for most games played before winning 
the Cup). [39] Prior to the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement signed 
in 2005, fans felt team management was not willing to spend to win the 
Stanley Cup.[40] Since 2005, Jacobs' public image has improved as he invested 
in the team and rebuilding the front office to make the team more competitive. 
The Bruins were the second highest ranked team in the NHL in the 2008–09 
season and were the top seeded team in the East. With a complete change 
in management, including now former General Manager Peter Chiarelli — who 
lost his position with the Bruins on April 15, 2015, with the May 20 hiring 
of Don Sweeney — long-time assistant general manager with the team. Sweeney 
will continue to work with current Head Coach Claude Julien, with Cam Neely 
continuing as team president after only four seasons had elapsed since 
the Bruins' most recent Stanley Cup victory in 2011. The current administrators 
in the Bruins front office are: The Bruins previously trained and practiced 
at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center in Allston, MA (built in 1956), then 
moved to the Ristuccia Ice Arena[42] in Wilmington, MA, itself completed 
in 1986, before the quite recent completion of the new Warrior Ice Arena 
in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, where they are currently training. 
When Boston television station WSBK-TV began broadcasting Bruins games 
in 1967, the producers of the games' telecasts wanted a suitable piece 
of music to air for the introduction of each game. Perhaps inspired by 
the Boston Ballet's annual Christmas performance of The Nutcracker had 
become closely identified with Boston, The Ventures' instrumental rock 
version of the Nutcracker's overture, known as "Nutty", itself thought 
to be that group's version of the slightly earlier hit "Nut Rocker", was 
selected as the opening piece of music for Bruins telecasts.[43] The song 
"Nutty" has been identified with the Bruins ever since, and is still sometimes 
played at the TD Garden during Bruins games. On ice, "Paree", a 1920s hit 
tune written by Leo Robin and Jose Padilla, has been played as an organ 
instrumental for decades, typically as the players entered the arena just 
before the start of each period and, for many years, after each Bruins' 
goal. It was introduced by John Kiley, the organist for the Bruins from 
the 1950s through the 1980s, and is still played during Bruins' games.[44] 
"Kernkraft 400 (Sport Chant Stadium Remix)" by Zombie Nation has been played 
for a number of seasons now after every Bruins goal scored on home ice, 
after two short blasts of a Kahlenberg KM-135 replica boat horn. As an 
"influence" from its use by the Bruins, the Zombie Nation number has also 
been used by the Red Sox following a Sox batter's home run at Fenway Park 
during their most recent MLB season. The Patriots use the Bruins recording 
of the horn for every third down at Gillette Stadium. Prior to 2002 when 
the song was used after goals, the team used an organ version of Paree 
by John Kiley followed by Rock and Roll Part 2. Currently "Cochise" by 
Audioslave is played whenever the Bruins enter the ice. "Joker and the 
Thief" by Wolfmother is played before the opening faceoff. Conversely, 
after every Bruins' win at the TD Garden (as with the NESN-covered Boston 
Red Sox when winning a baseball game at Fenway Park), "Dirty Water", by 
The Standells, is played. Quincy punk rock band Dropkick Murphys wrote 
their song "Time to Go" (released in their 2003 album Blackout) as a Bruins 
rally tune, and has performed their own version of The Ventures' song "Nutty" 
at games. Although it did not come with the band's guarantee to help bring 
home a championship, as they did with their song "Tessie" for the Red Sox, 
it is still a part of the team's culture and is played during third period 
TV timeouts. Two other Dropkick Murphys songs which are sometimes played 
at the TD Garden to rally the home crowd are "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" 
and "The Boys Are Back." Blades the Bruin, an anthropomorphic bear serves 
as the Bruins' team mascot. In January and February, Blades travels around 
the greater Boston area to raise money for the Bruins Foundation.[45] For 
a sizable amount of the team's more recent TV and online ads, a different 
anthropomorphic ursine character simply known as "The Bear" appears in 
official Bruins video advertising.[46] This is a partial list of the last 
five seasons completed by the Bruins. For the full season-by-season history,

Following the team's failure to make the 2015 playoffs, Peter Chiarelli 
was fired as General Manager on April 15, 2015, with Don Sweeney hired 
as Chiarelli's replacement on May 20, 2015. The current head coach is Claude 
Julien, who was hired on June 22, 2007, guiding the Bruins to their sixth 
Stanley Cup championship in 2011. Before the Stanley Cup victory, at the 
conclusion of the 2008–09 NHL season, Julien was awarded the Jack Adams 
Award as the best coach in the NHL. More recently, during a six-game roadtrip 
for the Bruins as part of the team's 2015–16 season, on February 13, 2016 
Julien was surprised to learn, after his Bruins team defeated the Minnesota 
Wild in a 4-2 road victory, that he had coached his 500th NHL winning game.[52] 
On March 3, 2016, as the result of Julien's coaching the Bruins to a 4-2 
home ice win against the 2015 Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks, 
Julien's winning game total as the Bruins' head coach rose to 387 wins 
for the Boston team, equalling the total number of Bruins coaching wins 
for Hall of Fame member Art Ross, the Bruins' original coach in 1924, from 
their beginnings that year through four separated periods of coaching ending 
in 1939.[53] Jack Edwards: TV play-by-play Andy Brickley: TV color analyst
