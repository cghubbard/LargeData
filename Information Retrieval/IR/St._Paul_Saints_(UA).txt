The St. Paul Saints,[1][2] also known as the Apostles[3] or the White Caps,[4][5] 
were a replacement Major League Baseball team that represented St. Paul, 
Minnesota in the short-lived Union Association, which existed for the 1884 
season only. The team began the 1884 season in the Northwestern League 
as the Apostles.[6] In September of that year, after compiling a 24-48 
record, the team jumped to the Union Association along with the Milwaukee 
Brewers. The club finished its short stint in the Association with a 2-6-1 
record in nine road games, earning the distinction of being the only major 
league team not to play a single home game.[6] The team was managed by 
Andrew Thompson.[7] They played their home games at Fort Street Grounds. 
Their top-hitting regular was pitcher/outfielder Jim Brown, who had five 
hits in 16 at bats, for a batting average of .312, hit four doubles, and 
a slugging percentage of .562.[8] The team also included Charlie Ganzel, 
their catcher, who went on to play in 786 games in a 14 season career, 
most notably with the Detroit Wolverines and the Boston Beaneaters.[9] 
The 1884 St. Paul Saints (variously known also as the "White Caps" or "Apostles") 
joined the Union Association on September 27, 1884, partway through its 
season after starting the season in the Northwestern League.[10] They finished 
with a 2–6–1 record. After the season the UA folded, as did the Saints.
