The 1924 New York Giants season was the franchise's 42nd season. The team 
finished first in the National League with a record of 93â€“60, winning the 
NL pennant for the fourth consecutive season, a record that still stands, 
as of 2016. They went on to the World Series, losing to the Washington 
Senators in seven games. In the final series of the 1924 season, the Giants 
were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling 
for the pennant with the Robins. Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell offered 
Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to throw the games. Sand rejected the 
bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually led 
to the life-time suspension of O'Connell and Giants coach Cozy Dolan by 
Commissioner Landis, although future-Hall of Famers Frankie Frisch, George 
Kelly, and Ross Youngs were also implicated.[1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
