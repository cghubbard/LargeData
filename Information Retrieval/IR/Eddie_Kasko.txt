Edward Michael Kasko (born June 27, 1932) is a former infielder, manager, 
scout and front office executive in American Major League Baseball. A standout 
defensive player as a shortstop and third baseman, Kasko began his professional 
career in 1949. He played for ten MLB seasons (1957–66) with the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox. He led National 
League third basemen in fielding percentage in 1960 and NL shortstops in 
that category four years later. Kasko was a right-handed batter who stood 
6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 180 pounds (82 kg). He lacked home run 
power but was a good contact hitter. His career batting average was .264 
in 1,077 games and 3,546 at bats. His 935 Major League hits included 146 
doubles and 13 triples, as well as 22 home runs. Selected to the 1961 National 
League All-Star team, he appeared in that year's second all-star classic, 
played July 31 at Fenway Park. In the contest, a 1–1 tie shortened by rain, 
Kasko replaced starter Maury Wills at shortstop in the fourth inning, and 
singled off Don Schwall of the Red Sox in the sixth frame to help the Senior 
Circuit score the tying run. Hall of Fame shortstop Ernie Banks pinch-hit 
for Kasko in the eighth inning and replaced him in the field.[1] Kasko 
appeared in one World Series—also in 1961, with Cincinnati. He started 
all five games at shortstop, led the Reds with seven hits (all singles), 
scored one run, and batted .319. Defensively, he made one error in 27 chances 
in the field and participated in five double plays. But the Reds were defeated 
by the New York Yankees. After the 1966 season, his only campaign with 
Boston, Kasko retired as an active player and managed the Red Sox' Triple-A 
clubs, the Toronto Maple Leafs (1967) and Louisville Colonels (1968–69). 
He succeeded the popular Dick Williams as Red Sox manager in 1970, and 
guided the club through four seasons, with mixed results. The Red Sox finished 
above the .500 mark each season, but only contended in 1972 when they finished 
a half-game out of first place, behind the Detroit Tigers, in the American 
League East Division. The half-game differential was partly due to the 
brief players' strike that spring: between six and eight games were lopped 
off each club's schedule and it was agreed that lost games would not be 
"made up" to resolve pennant races. During Kasko's four-year managerial 
term, he incorporated young players such as Carlton Fisk and Dwight Evans 
into the Red Sox lineup, converted relief pitcher Bill Lee into a successful 
starter, and showed patience with sore-armed veteran Luis Tiant as he returned 
to form as a dominant pitcher. But when the 1973 Red Sox again could not 
measure up to the powerful Baltimore Orioles of the era, Kasko was relieved 
of his managerial duties. His final record with Boston, over four seasons, 
was 345–295 (.539). Kasko remained with the Red Sox for another two decades, 
however, as a scout (1974–77), director of scouting (1977–92) and vice 
president, baseball development (1992–94). He was named to the Boston Red
