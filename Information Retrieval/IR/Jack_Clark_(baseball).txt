Jack Anthony Clark (born November 10, 1955), also known as "Jack the Ripper" 
is a former Major League Baseball player. From 1975 through 1992, Clark 
played for the San Francisco Giants (1975–84), St. Louis Cardinals (1985–87), 
New York Yankees (1988), San Diego Padres (1989–90) and Boston Red Sox 
(1991–92). During his prime, Clark was one of the most feared right-handed 
hitters in the National League, winning the Silver Slugger Award in 1985 
and 1987. A four-time All-Star In an 18-season career, Clark was a .267 
hitter with 340 home runs and 1180 RBI in 1994 games. He also collected 
1118 runs, 332 doubles, 77 stolen bases, and 1826 hits in 6847 at-bats. 
He batted and threw right-handed. Clark began his minor league baseball 
career in 1973 with the Great Falls Giants where he played the outfield 
and third base and had a 0-2 record in 5 games as a pitcher. In 1974, he 
led the league with 117 RBIs with Fresno. The following year, he led the 
league with 23 home runs with Lafayette.[1] Clark started his major league 
career with the San Francisco Giants in 1975 as a right fielder and the 
youngest player in 1975 (19). His 26-game hitting streak in 1978 is the 
longest by a Giants player after 1900.[2] He won the first Willie Mac Award 
in 1980 for his spirit and leadership. Clark frequently complained about 
the cold and windy condition at Candlestick Park, the Giants' home park.[3] 
He had a rift with manager Frank Robinson, and some members of the Giants 
front office thought Clark took too long to recover from injuries.[3] On 
February 1, 1985, Clark was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for shortstop 
José Uribe, pitcher Dave LaPoint, and first basemen-outfielders David Green 
and Gary Rajsich. He switched to first base to reduce risk of injury. His 
three-run home run against the Los Angeles Dodgers in game 6 of the 1985 
NLCS was the pennant-clinching hit for the Cardinals. Clark's fielding, 
never his specialty, played a pivotal role in the 1985 World Series. Umpire 
Don Denkinger's notorious controversial call in Game 6 came from Clark's 
throw to Todd Worrell at first. Clark would later misplay a foul popup 
that, while not ruled an error, should have been caught. Darrell Porter 
later admitted that he called off Clark but hesitated at the last minute 
when he thought Clark had called for the catch, which Clark had not. This 
opened the door for the Kansas City Royals to score two runs in the bottom 
of the 9th to win Game 6, and go on to capture the World Series in Game 
7 the following night. In 1987, despite a rift with St. Louis All-Star 
shortstop Ozzie Smith, Clark had his best season.[3] He hit .286 with 35 
home runs, 106 RBI, and led the league in on-base percentage (.459) and 
slugging percentage (.597). He accomplished all this despite missing 31 
games due to nagging injuries and finished third in the MVP vote. Clark 
again led the Cardinals to the World Series that year, although an ankle 
injury limited him to one at-bat in the postseason. Clark signed a two-year 
contract with the New York Yankees prior to the 1988 season. He was primarily 
a designated hitter (DH), because of the presence of Don Mattingly at first 
base. Clark enjoyed playing for manager Billy Martin, but he didn't get 
along with Martin's successor, Lou Piniella.[3] At the end of the season, 
he requested a trade.[4][5] Clark was traded to the San Diego Padres with 
Pat Clements for Lance McCullers, Jimmy Jones, and Stan Jefferson.[6] Regarding 
his time in the American League, he said, "I hate that damn league. Every 
game lasts 3 1/2 to 4 hours. No wonder the fans are bored over there."[3] 
He played for the Padres for two seasons. In 1990, he feuded with All-Star 
teammate Tony Gwynn, who was widely respected by his peers and known as 
one of the most dedicated players in baseball.[7][8][9] Clark called him 
selfish and stated that Gwynn should be swinging with runners in scoring 
position instead of bunting and protecting his batting average. "No one 
bothers Tony Gwynn because he wins batting titles, but the Padres finish 
fourth or fifth every year", he said.[8][10] Joe Carter, who played for 
the Padres in 1990, said, "It just involved one great guy, and that's Tony 
Gwynn, and anything they want to say about Tony Gwynn is going to be news. 
It got all blown out of proportion."[11] Gwynn countered, "I've been doing 
the same things my whole career, playing the same way. Now, why is it an 
issue? Because Jack Clark says it is."[12] In early 1991, after leaving 
the Pades, Clark called Padres manager Greg Riddoch "a bad, bad man, and 
he's sneaky. He's a snake. Well, not just a snake, but a s-s-s-n-n-n-a-ke."[13] 
Clark said of the San Diego fans: "Everything that they should cheer for 
they'd boo for, and everything they should boo for they'd cheer for ... 
Tony, he's perfect for them. He just plays the whole thing up, and the 
town is so stupid that they can't see."[3] Gwynn responded with his own 
criticism of Clark: "Let's talk about him walking 104 times, being a No. 
4 hitter. Let's talk about his not flying on team flights. Let's talk about 
him getting booted out of games on a called strike three."[14][15] Clark 
returned to the American League in 1991, signing with the Boston Red Sox 
for three years over the Padres' offer of only one.[8] Clark served primarily 
as Boston's DH, hitting 28 home runs his first year with the team. After 
hitting only five home runs in a truncated 1992 season, Clark was waived 
by Boston in February 1993 and was signed by the Montreal Expos during 
1993 spring training. He was released later that year and never made an 
official at bat with the Expos. He retired shortly after. The Frontier 
League introduced a new independent minor league team in the St. Louis 
area in 1999. Clark was named manager of the River City Rascals in their 
inaugural season. Clark served as the Los Angeles Dodgers' hitting coach 
for the 2001–03 seasons. In October 2008, Clark was named manager of the 
Springfield Sliders (Springfield Illinois) of the Central Illinois Collegiate 
League (renamed Prospect League in 2009).[16] It was in Springfield that 
he caught criticism from an article in The State Journal-Register after 
missing ten of the Sliders' 26 home games with no telling how many road 
games he attended.[17] Clark was driven into bankruptcy in 1992 by his 
appetite for luxury cars. According to his bankruptcy filing, he owned 
18 luxury automobiles, including a US$700,000 Ferrari and a Rolls-Royce. 
Clark was trying to pay 17 car notes simultaneously, and whenever he got 
bored with a car he would get rid of it and just buy another one. He ended 
up losing his US$2.4 million home and his drag-racing business because 
of his extravagant spending habits. Despite one of the most publicized 
bankruptcies in baseball, Clark reportedly got back on his feet in the 
late 1990s.[18] Clark was hired as a sports talk host on St. Louis radio 
station WGNU in August 2013, co-hosting "The King and the Ripper" with 
longtime St. Louis radio personality Kevin "the King" Slaten. At least 
twice during the show's first week, Clark accused Los Angeles Angels slugger 
Albert Pujols of using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) while Pujols 
was with the Cardinals. Clark had said that he talked to Pujols' former 
personal trainer and said that "I know for a fact he was" using PEDs.[19] 
Pujols responded by threatening Clark and WGNU with a defamation lawsuit, 
and vehemently denied that he had ever used PEDs. The trainer added that 
he hadn't even talked to Clark in over ten years. InsideSTL Enterprises, 
the company that owns WGNU's weekday airtime through a time brokerage agreement,[20] 
cut ties with Clark and Slaten after only seven shows.[19][21][22] On October 
4, 2013, Pujols filed a lawsuit against Clark.[23] In response on October 
14, Clark challenged Pujols to both take polygraph tests to resolve who 
is telling the truth.[24] However, on February 10, 2014, Clark apologized 
and retracted his accusations against Pujols, saying he had "no knowledge 
whatsoever" that Pujols ever used PEDs. "During a heated discussion on
