Toronto Football Club,[2] commonly referred to as Toronto FC or simply 
TFC, is a Canadian professional soccer club based in Toronto, Ontario. 
The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Eastern 
Conference. The club plays its home matches at BMO Field, located at Exhibition 
Place on Toronto's shoreline. Toronto FC began play in 2007 as an expansion 
team, and was the first Canadian based franchise in the league. The team 
is coached by Greg Vanney and operated by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, 
which also operates the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs, the AHL's Toronto Marlies, 
the NBA's Toronto Raptors (and the NBA Development League's Raptors 905 
by extension) and the USL's Toronto FC II. Toronto FC are five-time Canadian 
Champions, and its most significant achievement to date is reaching the 
semifinals of the 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League. Toronto was awarded 
an expansion team in 2005, with team owner Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment 
Ltd. (MLSE) paying $10 million for the team.[3] The name of the club was 
officially announced on May 11, 2006.[4] The announcement followed an online 
consultation in which the public was invited to vote on the name during 
a limited period. The voting options were "Toronto Northmen," "Inter Toronto 
FC," "Toronto Reds," and "Toronto FC." MLSE's strategy in choosing "Toronto 
FC" following this process was based on two reasons. Firstly, over 40 percent 
of the online vote supported the simplified Toronto FC name during the 
consultation; secondly, MLSE hoped that the fairly generic name would help 
the new club earn a more organic nickname from the Toronto fans rather 
than having one imposed upon the club.[5] The team has been called "TFC" 
and "the Reds" by the media and the club. The "FC" in the team's name became 
the conventional initialism for Football Club.[6] The team has been called 
"TFC" and "the Reds" by the media and the club. Despite a long scoreless 
streak to start the team's history, Toronto FC quickly began to establish 
itself as a club with significant fan support. The club's first win on 
May 12 at BMO Field saw Danny Dichio score in the 24th minute,[7] which 
prompted the sellout crowd to toss promotional plastic seat cushions onto 
the field in celebration. Though TFC would slip to the bottom of the MLS 
standings with a record of 6–17–7, the club built a foundation as the first 
Canadian team in MLS. In the club's second season in 2008, Toronto hosted 
the 2008 MLS All-Star Game. The team finished last in the Eastern Conference 
with a record of 9–13–8, but the enthusiastic fan base continued to fill 
BMO Field to capacity.[8] To determine the Canadian Soccer Association's 
representative in the CONCACAF Champions League, Toronto FC played in the 
inaugural 2008 Canadian Championship competing for the Voyageurs Cup. TFC 
were the favourites to win the championship in its first year, but the 
Montreal Impact prevailed. The last-place New York Red Bulls defeated Toronto 
FC 5–0 in the final 2009 regular season game, leaving TFC one point out 
of the playoffs.[9] Despite bringing in some high-profile talent, the Reds 
could not seem to field a consistent side. Dwayne De Rosario became an 
immediate scoring influence and Amado Guevara was a strong playmaker and 
established MLS veteran, but the Honduran's future at the Canadian club 
seemed murky with looming 2010 FIFA World Cup duties. Rookie goalkeeper 
Stefan Frei quickly replaced Greg Sutton as a regular starter and immediately 
became a fan favourite. TFC only scored 2 goals in the final 15 minutes 
of games all season (last in MLS). During the same 15-minute period they 
gave up 16 goals (most in MLS), thus creating a −14 goal differential during 
the final 15 minutes.[10] In the 2009 Canadian Championship, Toronto FC 
required a four-goal victory over the Montreal Impact in the final game 
of the competition to nullify the Vancouver Whitecaps' +4 goal differential. 
Anything less would result in Vancouver winning the championship. Toronto 
FC went down 1–0 early, but overwhelmed an under-strength Impact side 6–1 
on the back of a hat-trick by De Rosario. Guevara added two, scoring in 
the 69th and 92nd minute. Chad Barrett scored the decisive goal in the 
82nd minute, which gave TFC the lead over Vancouver. The unlikely victory 
was dubbed by fans and media as the Miracle in Montreal.[11] Toronto FC 
subsequently participated in the 2009–10 CONCACAF Champions League, but 
lost 1–0 on aggregate to the Puerto Rico Islanders in the preliminary round 
of the tournament. After failing to qualify on the final day of the 2009 
campaign, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said anything short of a playoff 
spot in 2010 would be unacceptable. With that directive, former director 
of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki[12] and made wholesale changes to the 
roster to reflect the US Hall of Famer’s plan to play a tough, defensive 
style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC played well at the start, going undefeated 
in seven games at one time. The team struggled following the World Cup 
break. Sensing problems in the locker room and to try to salvage the season, 
MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane 
interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach.[13] The players 
responded to Dasovic's more open, flexible style, but it wasn't enough 
as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left 
in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 
season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to 
hold a series of town hall meetings. Toronto FC played C.D. Motagua in 
the preliminary round of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League. TFC won 
1–0 in the first leg on a goal by Chad Barrett, and tied 2–2 in the second 
leg on goals by De Rosario and Barrett, qualifying for the group stage. 
Toronto FC won their first ever group stage match 2–1 against Cruz Azul 
on August 17, 2010.[14] However, the team failed to qualify for the championship 
round after finishing in 3rd place behind group winners Real Salt Lake 
and 2nd place Cruz Azul. On November 3, 2010, MLSE formally announced the 
hiring of former German international and coach Jürgen Klinsmann, and his 
California-based company, SoccerSolutions, to fix the club's game.[15] 
Over the next six months, Klinsmann assessed the club, identifying a playing 
style and recommended a candidate for the director of soccer position.[16] 
On January 6, 2011, the new management team for Toronto FC was announced. 
Aron Winter was hired as Head coach with his compatriot, Bob de Klerk named 
First Assistant coach.[17] Paul Mariner was named as Director of soccer. 
Winter was selected to bring the Ajax culture, possession and 4-3-3 system 
to Toronto FC. Management made wholesale changes to the roster before and 
during the 2011 season, trading numerous players and eventually their captain 
and Toronto native De Rosario. Toronto FC used its remaining two designated 
player slots on two notable European players, signing Torsten Frings and 
Danny Koevermans to 2.5 year contracts. The team went on to set a record 
for most players used in a MLS season with 39. Despite a strong finish 
to the season with only 2 losses in their last 12 games, TFC missed the 
MLS playoffs for a fifth straight year. Nonetheless, they earned a win 
in their final group stage match of 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League at 
Pizza Hut Park against FC Dallas, securing a berth in the knockout stage 
versus LA Galaxy. After a 2–2 draw in Toronto before 47,658 fans at the 
Rogers Centre,[18] Toronto FC defeated the Galaxy 2–1 in Los Angeles to 
reach the CONCACAF Champions League semifinals, the first Canadian team 
to do so.[19] They were defeated by Santos Laguna in their semifinal. On 
June 7, 2012, Aron Winter resigned from the club upon refusing to be reassigned 
from his Head coaching role[20] after the team started the season with 
a nine-game losing streak, setting an MLS record for worst start to a season. 
Under Winter in 2012, the club's league record was 1–9–0 and in all other 
competitions was 3–1–4, including a fourth-straight Canadian Championship. 
He was replaced by Paul Mariner, but TFC continued to struggle finishing 
with a 4–12–8 record in league play under him.[21] Toronto FC also failed 
to advance in the CONCACAF Champions League, finishing second in its group 
with a 2–2–0 record. Overall, they finished the MLS season on a 14-game 
winless streak and ended up in last place, with just 5 wins and 23 points 
(both franchise lows). It was announced Kevin Payne would be leaving D.C. 
United for the general manager position at Toronto FC on November 27, 2012.[22] 
First-time coach Ryan Nelsen replaced Mariner as of January 7, 2013.[23] 
On April 25, 2013, Payne signed the first ever young designated player 
in MLS, Matías Laba.[24] On July 9, Payne controversially traded Luis Silva 
to D.C. United for an undisclosed amount of allocation money.[25] The club 
fired Payne on September 4.[26][27] Following the removal of Payne, recently 
appointed MLSE president Tim Leiweke[28] reasoned that there were philosophical 
differences between the two as to how Toronto FC should move forward into 
2014 and beyond.[29] Leiweke, who brought David Beckham to the LA Galaxy 
in early 2007, quickly revealed that he intended to make TFC more competitive 
with similarly ambitious, blockbuster signings.[30] On September 20, Toronto 
FC announced that the vacant general manager position had been filled by 
Tim Bezbatchenko.[31] Under Bezbatchenko, Toronto FC made several high-profile 
moves during the 2013–14 off season. Among the transfers were MLS veterans 
Justin Morrow and Jackson; Brasileiro star Gilberto, United States international 
Michael Bradley of A.S. Roma, and the return of Toronto FC leading goal 
scorer De Rosario.[32][33] On January 10, 2014, Tottenham Hotspur announced 
they had agreed a deal with the club over the transfer of England international 
Jermain Defoe for a reported fee of £6 million, as well as an Advertising 
Rights Agreement with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd.[34] This would 
see Defoe earn a reported £90,000 a week, making him the highest earner 
in MLS.[35] These moves required the trade of Matias Laba to Vancouver, 
to comply with MLS's maximum of three designated players per team. On February 
7, 2014, Brazil national team keeper Júlio César joined on loan from Queens 
Park Rangers.[36] The team started the year with promise, but much like 
2010, they floundered after the World Cup break. On August 31, Nelsen was 
fired by Bezbatchenko a day after a 0–3 defeat to the New England Revolution 
at BMO field, where Nelsen criticized Bezbatchenko in his post-match press 
conference for putting the players under needless pressure in the media. 
The head coaching position was filled by former American international 
and Chivas USA assistant, Greg Vanney.[37] Although the club won the most 
games in its history, it failed to reach the playoffs for the eighth consecutive 
year. After completing only 11 months of his four-year contract with TFC, 
Defoe joined Premier League club Sunderland. On January 16, 2015, as part 
of a player exchange sending Jozy Altidore in the other direction.[38][39] 
Three days later, the club signed Italian international Sebastian Giovinco 
on an annual salary of $7 million.[40] On September 26, Giovinco scored 
and assisted in a 3–2 win over Chicago, putting him on 35 points for the 
season, breaking Chris Wondolowski's league record.[41] Toronto FC clinched 
a playoff berth on October 14, for the first time in franchise history,[42] 
and Giovinco's totals of 22 goals and 16 assists made him the first TFC 
player to win the MLS Golden Boot.[43] The team were eliminated in the 
knockout round of the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs by a 3–0 loss at 401 Derby 
rivals Montreal Impact.[44] On June 29, 2016, Toronto FC won its fifth 
Canadian Championship, as they beat Vancouver 2–2 on aggregate, winning 
on away goals.[45] Giovinco scored a hat-trick against D.C. United, on 
July 23, 2016, in a 4–1 home win, surpassing De Rosario's previous all-time 
record as Toronto FC's top scorer by two goals to 35 goals.[46] In October 
2016, Toronto FC clinched a playoff spot for the second straight season. 
The team proceeded to defeat the Philadelphia Union at BMO Field in the 
Eastern Conference Knockout Round to record their first-ever playoff win[47] 
and to secure entry into the first Eastern Conference Semifinal in franchise 
history. Toronto FC defeated New York City FC 7–0 on aggregate to reach 
an all Canadian Eastern Conference Finals derby against Montreal Impact.[48] 
Before the 2007 Major League Soccer season, construction was completed 
on a new stadium at Exhibition Place in Toronto at a cost of $62.5 million.[49][50] 
On September 20, 2006, MLS's official website announced that BMO Financial 
Group had officially purchased the naming rights for the new stadium.[51] 
It is the largest soccer-specific stadium in Canada. It is owned by the 
City of Toronto, while MLSE, the team's owner, operates it.[52][53] As 
the National Soccer Stadium, it served as a major venue for the 2007 FIFA 
U-20 World Cup, including hosting the opening and final matches. In 2008, 
it played host to the 2008 MLS All-Star Game. BMO Field has also hosted 
various high-profile teams in international friendlies such as Real Madrid 
in 2009. It was chosen as a neutral venue to host the 2010 MLS Cup in November 
2010. It also holds other sports, such as Rugby Sevens during the 2015 
Pan American Games and beginning in 2016, the Toronto Argonauts Canadian 
Football League team. It will host a Toronto Maple Leafs National Hockey 
League game on January 1, 2017, as the NHL Centennial Classic. Following 
criticism of BMO Field's use of FieldTurf and its rapid deterioration, 
MLSE agreed to a deal with the city to replace it with a natural grass 
surface in time for the 2010 MLS Season. Along with the grass, a heating 
and drainage system was also installed at a cost of $3.5 million to MLSE. 
In March 2012, TFC played its first-ever match in the Rogers Centre, the 
49,982-capacity home of Major League Baseball's Toronto Blue Jays and former 
home of the Argonauts, hosting the LA Galaxy in the home leg of the 2011–12 
CONCACAF Champions League Championship Round.[54] The retractable roof 
stadium was also the venue for a friendly against Liverpool of the English 
Premier League in July of that year.[55] Expansion to the north end that 
cost $2 million and added 1,249 seats was completed for the start of the 
2010 MLS Season.[56] A $120 million renovation to the stadium was officially 
announced September 23, 2014. It includes a second tier of seating that 
would add 8,400 seats, raising the capacity of the stadium to 30,991. New 
suites, washrooms, concourse and a roof would also be added. Construction 
began in September 2014 and would be divided into two phases, with the 
completion of the project set for May 2016.[57] The expansion would accommodate 
a Canadian football field with artificial turf end-zones when the Toronto 
Argonauts move to BMO Field in 2016,[58][59] along with hosting the Grey 
Cup that year. Toronto FC's initial seasons saw TFC fans set the standard 
for MLS fan support,[60] selling out its first three seasons. Referred 
to as the model franchise off the field by MLS commissioner Don Garber, 
the club was credited for starting "MLS 2.0" for their embrace of supporters' 
culture.[61][62] Lack of on-field success caused frustration among the 
fanbase, spurring fan protests against ownership.[63] In response, MLSE 
acknowledged the lack of quality on the on-field product, lowering ticket 
prices in 2013 to 2007 levels.[64] Following a resurgence of interest in 
the club due to the major signings of Jermain Defoe and Michael Bradley, 
the club capped season tickets at 17,000 for the 2014 season.[65] Toronto 
FC's recognized supporters' groups are the Red Patch Boys, U-Sector, Inebriatti, 
Kings in the North, Tribal Rhythm Nation and Original 109.[66] The official 
mascot for Toronto FC is Bitchy the Hawk.[67] Toronto FC's biggest rival, 
Montreal Impact, joined MLS in 2012. In the years leading up to this, they 
emerged as fierce rivals during the Canadian Championship. The proximity 
of the two cities and the fact that Toronto and Montreal are long-standing 
rivals in NHL ice hockey contributes to these meetings being combative. 
Since both teams have joined MLS, the rivalry has intensified and the matches 
have become a Canadian soccer classic, which has also been named the 401 
Derby, named after Ontario Highway 401 linking the two cities.[68] On March 
16, 2013, Toronto FC fans set an MLS record for travelling support with 
3,200 away fans in Montreal to watch TFC lose 2–1, eclipsing their own 
record of 2,400 at Columbus Crew in 2008.[69] Columbus Crew and Toronto 
FC have competed for the Trillium Cup since 2008. Although a manufactured 
rivalry, the meetings have since sparked bitterness. On March 28, 2009, 
approximately 1,700 Toronto FC supporters travelled to Columbus Crew Stadium 
and witnessed a 1–1 draw, during which they lit a number of flares and 
allegedly committed vandalism.[70] Following the game some altercations 
broke out between the two supporter groups. Overwhelmed security called 
police who ended the melees and made arrests, at which time a TFC fan was 
tasered while being subdued.[70] The first rematch back in Columbus Crew 
Stadium following the incident was boycotted by Toronto FC supporters in 
wake of restrictions imposed on them by Crew officials.[70] Toronto FC 
also have a rivalry with Vancouver Whitecaps FC.[71][72][73][74][75] The 
official team colours include red as the primary colour, with black, grey 
and white as secondary colours. The primary kit (jersey, shorts and socks) 
is red with black trim, whereas the secondary kit includes white jerseys 
with a large red stripe below a smaller blue stripe across the chest and 
blue and red trim, white socks with blue trim, and with either red or blue 
shorts (the choice of which is subject to the opponent kit). In its first 
three seasons, Toronto FC's secondary kit colours were light and dark grey. 
The following four seasons saw white secondary kits, whereas in 2014, the 
secondary kits were changed to onyx. As with all MLS teams, the kits are 
produced by Adidas. In 2013 and 2014, a shadow-print maple leaf was featured 
on Toronto FC's primary jerseys.[76][77] Since the club's formation in 
2007, it has been sponsored by the Bank of Montreal (BMO). The sponsorship 
was initially worth $1–1.5 million per season, but in 2010, a new five-year 
deal worth $4 million per season was signed.[78] In February 2016, it was 
announced that BMO had extended its sponsorship agreement through the rest 
of 2016.[79] Toronto FC are operated by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment 
Ltd., who also own and operate the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Toronto Raptors 
and the Toronto Marlies, along with sports ventures like Leafs TV, NBA 
TV Canada and GolTV Canada.[80] The company is also involved in real estate 
and property management, owning such sports venues such as the Air Canada 
Centre and being a partner in the development of Maple Leaf Square. The 
partners of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment are Larry Tanenbaum and rival 
media outlets Rogers Communications and Bell Media; Rogers and Bell own 
each of the primary sports television outlets in Canada (Sportsnet and 
TSN respectively), while Tanenbaum and Bell share ownership of the Toronto 
Argonauts, who share BMO Field with Toronto FC beginning in 2016. Where 
a player has not declared an international allegiance, nation is determined 
by place of birth. Squad correct as of March 1, 2016.[81] As of October 
2015[82][83] Toronto FC II was established in November 2014 and is the 
farm club of Toronto FC. Toronto FC II competes in the United Soccer League, 
the third division of the American and Canadian soccer league system. The 
team serves as a reserve team for TFC and a bridge between the Academy 
and First Team.[84] The team began play in March 2015. Their home stadium 
is the newly constructed 3,500-seat stadium at the Ontario Soccer Centre 
in Vaughan, just north-northwest of Toronto.[85][86] Jason Bent is the 
team's first head coach. Previously, Toronto FC had a one-year partnership 
with the Wilmington Hammerheads of the USL.[87][88][89] TFC Academy is 
the youth academy and development system of Toronto FC that was established 
in 2008.[90][91] The academy consists of multiple teams spanning different 
age groups, from U10 to U19. The academy currently plays in League1 Ontario. 
In June 2012, TFC academy moved to their new KIA Training Ground in Downsview 
Park,[92] located in North York. Built at a cost of $21 million to MLSE, 
the facility has seven pitches: three full-sized grass pitches and four 
artificial turfs with two capable of being bubbled for year-round use. 
The 36,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) facility also contains first team facilities, 
gym, kitchen, and offices.[93] Toronto FC games are exclusively broadcast 
by either the TSN or Sportsnet families of channels. Games that are not 
covered under national broadcast contracts with MLS or other competition 
organizers are divided evenly between the two broadcasters, pursuant to 
agreements between their parent companies (Bell Canada and Rogers Communications 
respectively) in connection to their joint 2011 purchase of MLSE.[94] GolTV 
Canada, acquired by MLSE in 2009, carried several live Toronto FC games 
each season from 2009 to 2012, normally commentated by Wileman. The channel 
continues to carry repeats of TFC games and other ancillary coverage of 
the team. Other previous broadcasters for the 2007 to 2010 seasons included 
The Score and CBC Sports (through CBC Television and Bold). Similar to 
the TV rights, radio broadcasts are divided between Sportsnet 590 and TSN 
Radio 1050; Dan Dunleavy calls the games, while Bob Iarusci joins him as 
colour commentator for home games. MLS Regular Season, MLS Cup Playoffs,

home stadium, BMO Field, was on May 10, 2015, when they hosted the Houston 
Dynamo in front of 30,226.[117] The highest overall attendance for a home 
game was on March 7, 2012, when they hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy in the 
2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinals at the Rogers Centre in
