The Billings Mustangs are a minor league baseball team based in Billings, 
Montana. The Mustangs are the Pioneer League Rookie affiliate of the Major 
League Cincinnati Reds. The team has been a part of the Pioneer League 
since 1948 with a five-year gap between 1964 and 1968, and has been affiliated 
with the Reds since 1974 (after an affiliation with the Kansas City Royals). 
Along with the Elizabethton Twins, the Mustangs affiliation with the Reds 
is the longest-running among all rookie-level teams.[1] The team was officially 
established on November 4, 1947. The Mustangs play at Dehler Park, named 
after Jon Dehler, a Billings businessman who bought the naming right to 
the field in 2007. Prior to the 2008 season the Mustangs played at Cobb 
Field (named after Bob Cobb who was responsible for bringing professional 
baseball to the city of Billings). Cobb Field was demolished in September 
2007 to make way for the new park. The Mustangs won three consecutive Pioneer 
League titles from 1992 and 1994, then won another in 1997. In 2003, Billings 
beat the Provo Angels in the Championship Series 2 games to 0. Provo had 
tied the league record for wins that year with 54. Billings, the last team 
to qualify for the postseason, won game 1 at Provo 8-5 in 11 innings, then, 
Billings won 3-0 on a no-hitter by James Paduch to win the Championship 
in front of a sold-out Cobb Field in Billings. The game was a classic pitchers 
duel between two of the top pitchers in the league (Provo's being 2003 
Pioneer League Pitcher of the Year Abel Moreno). In 2006, Chris Valaika 
set a Pioneer League record with a 32-game hitting streak during the Mustangs 
51-win campaign. Many Major League stars have begun their pro careers in 
Billings. These include George Brett, Reggie Sanders, Paul O'Neill, Trevor 
Hoffman, Keith Lockhart, Danny Tartabull, Ben Broussard, Scott Sullivan, 
Aaron Boone, Adam Dunn, Austin Kearns, and B. J. Ryan. After years of award-winning 
work in the front office, Assistant General Manager Gary Roller was promoted 
to General Manager for the 2005 season. Roller took over for long time 
GM and Mustangs Hall-of-Famer Bob Wilson. Matt Bender, who formerly handled 
the duties of Official Scorer, took over the vacated Assistant General 
Manager position. Dehler Park (and before at Cobb Field) is renowned in 
the Pioneer League for the "Beer Batter." Every game the Mustangs Beer 
Boosters designate one player as the "Beer Batter." If that player gets 
a hit, attendees can buy four beers for $10. Many eager buyers stand at 
the stairs anticipating a hit and the oncoming rush of people. The Billings 
Mustangs changed their logo for the 2006 season. The 2007 season was their 
last at Cobb Field and the Mustangs begin the 2008 season at Dehler Park. 
On September 11, 2014, the Mustangs defeated the Orem Owlz for their first 
Pioneer League Championship since the 2003 season. Pitchers Catchers Infielders
