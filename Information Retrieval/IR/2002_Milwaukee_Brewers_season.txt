The 2002 Milwaukee Brewers season involved the Brewers' finishing 6th in 
the National League Central with a record of 56 wins and 106 losses. On 
May 23, 2002, Shawn Green of the Los Angeles Dodgers hit four home runs 
in one game versus the Brewers. He also had one single and one double for 
a total of 19 total bases.[3] The number broke the previous record of 18 
total bases set by Joe Adcock. The 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game was the 73rd playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars 
of the American League (AL) and National League (NL). The game was held 
on July 9, 2002 at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The game resulted 
in a 7-7 tie. The next year home field advantage in the World Series would 
be awarded to the winning league. The game is commonly referred to as a 
'flop' by sports writers due to the lack of continuation of the game.[2] 
The roster selection for the 2002 game marked the inaugural All-Star Final 
Vote competition (then known as "The All-Star 30th Man" competition). Johnny 
Damon and Andruw Jones represented the American and National Leagues as 
a result of this contest. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G =
