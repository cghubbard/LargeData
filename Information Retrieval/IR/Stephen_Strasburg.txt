Stephen James Strasburg (/ˈstrɑːsbərɡ/;[1][2] born July 20, 1988) is an 
American professional baseball pitcher for the Washington Nationals of 
Major League Baseball (MLB). Strasburg was selected by Washington with 
the first pick in the 2009 MLB Draft, and he made his MLB debut with the 
Nationals in 2010. A talented but unpolished high school baseball player 
at West Hills High School, Strasburg played college baseball for the San 
Diego State Aztecs. There, he became one of the best collegiate pitchers 
in the country. He pitched for the United States national baseball team 
at the 2008 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal. Two years later, 
Strasburg was called the "most-hyped pick in draft history" by ESPN[3] 
and the "most hyped and closely watched pitching prospect in the history 
of baseball" by Sports Illustrated.[4] Strasburg's major league debut on 
June 8, 2010, produced a franchise-record 14 strikeouts. Several months 
into his major league career, Strasburg tore a ligament in his pitching 
elbow. The injury required Tommy John surgery and a year of rehabilitation. 
He rejoined the Nationals on September 6, 2011, but was only able to pitch 
24 innings that year. His 2012 season marked a successful return to form; 
Strasburg was selected to play in the 2012 MLB All-Star Game.[5] Strasburg 
pitches an average fastball of 94.7 mph.[6] Strasburg attended West Hills 
High School in Santee, California. At first, he struggled on the school's 
baseball team, posting a 1–10 win–loss record in his junior year. A twelve-strikeout 
game against El Capitan High School in his senior year, in which Strasburg 
allowed one hit, drew attention from scouts. He finished his senior year 
with a 1.68 earned run average (ERA) and 74 strikeouts in 62 1⁄3 innings 
pitched, with seven complete games. He finished with three varsity letters, 
set school records in ERA and shutouts, and was named his school's 2006 
Scholar-Athlete of the Year. He was also named second-team all-league and 
his team's MVP.[7][8] Despite these achievements, he was not selected in 
that year's Major League Baseball Draft.[9] Strasburg had hoped to attend 
Stanford University but was not accepted there.[8] Although recruited by 
a number of schools across the country, he enrolled at San Diego State 
University, where both of his parents attended school.[7] He played college 
baseball for the San Diego State Aztecs, coached by the late Baseball Hall 
of Fame inductee Tony Gwynn. When he first arrived, he was an unlikely 
candidate to pitch collegiate baseball at all; he was so overweight and 
out of shape that his conditioning coach nicknamed him "Slothburg" and 
encouraged him to quit baseball.[10] He also had a difficult time adjusting 
to college life, moving out of his dormitory and in with his mother after 
five days. He acknowledged, "I wasn't the most mature guy out of high school. 
… The dorm was an overload, too much, too soon."[11] Strasburg responded 
with an intense workout regimen, losing 30 pounds (14 kg) in the process.[9][12] 
He also worked to improve his mental toughness.[11] Coaches tested him 
by placing him in high-pressure situations and telling him he needed to 
get strikeouts.[13] San Diego State used Strasburg as a relief pitcher 
in his freshman year; he began the season pitching in middle relief, before 
becoming the Aztecs' closer.[9][11] He held opponents to a .141 batting 
average against and was named Co-Freshman of the Year for the Mountain 
West Conference.[12] In the summer of 2007, Strasburg also played for the 
Torrington Twisters of the collegiate summer baseball New England Collegiate 
Baseball League (NECBL). He was named to the NECBL First Team as a closer, 
and was also chosen as the Top Pro Prospect and Top Relief Pitcher in the 
NECBL.[14][15] In 2008, as a sophomore, Strasburg was converted to a full-time 
starting pitcher. He went 8–3 with a 1.58 ERA and 134 strikeouts in 98⅓ 
innings.[16] Four of his thirteen starts in 2008 were complete games, two 
of which were shutouts.[17] On April 11 of that year, he struck out a Mountain 
West Conference record 23 batters in a game versus the University of Utah.[18] 
He also gained eight miles per hour on his fastball, regularly working 
in the upper 90s and touching 100 mph.[13] Strasburg finished his junior 
year, the 2009 season, 13–1 with a 1.32 ERA, 59 hits allowed, 16 earned 
runs, 19 walks, and 195 strikeouts in 109 innings pitched.[19] In his final 
home start on May 8, 2009, Strasburg threw his first career no-hitter while 
striking out 17 Air Force Falcons batters.[20] His lone loss came against 
the Virginia Cavaliers in the NCAA Regionals as Virginia advanced toward 
the College World Series, but he still struck out 15 in seven innings during 
the loss.[21] He won the Dick Howser Trophy and the National Pitcher of 
the Year Award.[22] Strasburg was named to the United States national baseball 
team on June 24, 2008.[23] In that role he appeared in the 2008 World University 
Baseball Championship, held in late July. The United States won the gold 
medal in the competition.[24] Strasburg was the lone collegiate player 
selected for the United States national team at the 2008 Summer Olympics 
in Beijing. In his first start at the Olympics, Strasburg one-hit the Netherlands 
over seven innings, striking out five of the first six batters he faced 
and 11 overall. The lone hit Strasburg allowed was a seventh-inning single 
to Sharnol Adriana.[25] With the United States having already secured a 
spot in the semifinals medal round, manager Davey Johnson held Strasburg 
from what would have been his second start on August 20 in order to pitch 
him in the first round of the semifinals against Norge Luis Vera of the 
Cuban national baseball team, on August 22.[26] Vera outdueled Strasburg 
with six innings pitched and only two runs, one earned. Strasburg, meanwhile, 
lasted only four innings while giving up three runs, two earned. Cuba won 
the game 10–2.[27] Strasburg ended up with a 1–1 record, a 1.67 ERA, and 
a bronze medal for the Olympics, as the United States won its following 
contest against Japan 8–4.[28] He won the USA Baseball Richard W. "Dick" 
Case Player of the Year Award in 2008.[29][30] On June 9, 2009, Strasburg 
was drafted number one overall in the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft 
by the Washington Nationals. On August 17, 2009, he signed a record-breaking 
four-year, $15.1 million contract with the Nationals, just 77 seconds before 
the deadline, shattering a dollar-amount record previously held by Mark 
Prior, who signed for $10.5 million in 2001.[31] Strasburg is represented 
by agent Scott Boras.[32] Strasburg made his professional debut on October 
16, 2009, starting for the Phoenix Desert Dogs in the Arizona Fall League 
at Phoenix Municipal Stadium.[33] He was selected to play in the league's 
Rising Stars Showcase, but was unable to participate due to a minor neck 
injury. He also won Pitcher of the Week honors for the week of November 
2, 2009 and led the AFL with four wins.[34][35] Before the 2010 season 
started, Baseball America named Strasburg as the top pitching prospect, 
and the second-best overall prospect behind Jason Heyward.[36] Strasburg 
was assigned to the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League 
for the start of the 2010 season. There was so much anticipation and hype 
surrounding Strasburg that there were about 70 credentialed media members 
in attendance at his April 11, 2010 debut,[37] and ESPN nationally broadcast 
portions of the game.[38] He won his Senators debut against the Altoona 
Curve, allowing four hits and four runs (one earned), while striking out 
eight batters in five innings. During his first home start on April 16, 
he yielded two hits and an unearned run with three strikeouts in 2⅓ innings 
in a loss to the New Britain Rock Cats, one where his innings were limited 
due to a rain delay.[39] Harrisburg set an attendance record in Strasburg's 
home debut with 7,895 fans.[40] He completed his Class AA stint with a 
1.64 ERA while striking out 27 and walking six in 22 innings.[41] On May 
4, 2010, he was promoted to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International 
League. In his first game with the Chiefs, he pitched six scoreless innings, 
striking out six batters while allowing one hit and one walk.[42] That 
game drew 13,766 fans—the highest attendance in the 135-year history of 
baseball in Syracuse.[43] In his second start, Strasburg was removed after 
pitching six no-hit innings.[44] He finished his minor league stint with 
an overall record of 7–2, an ERA of 1.30, 65 strikeouts and 13 walks in 
55⅓ innings, and a walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio of 0.80.[45] 
Strasburg made his major-league debut on June 8, 2010, against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. A Sports Illustrated columnist termed it "the most hyped pitching 
debut the game has ever seen."[46] An ESPN article revealed the colloquial 
name for Strasburg's celebrated debut as "Strasmas".[47] Strasburg picked 
up the win in his debut, pitching seven innings, allowing two earned runs 
and no walks and 14 strikeouts, setting a new team strikeout record.[48] 
Also, he was the first pitcher in history to strike out at least eleven 
batters without issuing any walks in his pro debut, while falling just 
one strikeout short of the all-time record for a pitcher's debut—Karl Spooner 
(1954) and J. R. Richard (1971) both struck out 15, but each took nine 
innings to do it, and each walked three.[49] (Bob Feller also struck out 
15 in his first start, although it wasn't his big league debut).[50] He 
struck out every batter in the Pirates' lineup at least once and struck 
out the last seven batters he faced—also a Nationals record.[51][52] He 
threw 34 of his 94 pitches at 98 miles per hour (158 km/h) or faster, including 
two that reached 100 miles per hour (160 km/h).[53] In Strasburg's second 
and third major league starts he struck out another eight and ten batters, 
respectively, setting a major league record for the most strikeouts in 
a pitcher's first three starts with 32. The previous record holder had 
been Richard, who struck out 29 in his first three starts in 1971.[54] 
Strasburg was also featured in the cover story of Sports Illustrated following 
his second start.[55] His #37 jersey was the top-selling jersey in all 
of baseball for the month of June and became the best-selling Nationals 
jersey of all time in that span.[56] Strasburg was placed on the disabled 
list with an inflamed right shoulder in July 2010.[57] He returned to action 
on August 10, but in his third game back, on August 21, he was removed 
with an apparent injury.[58] On August 27, the Nationals announced that 
Strasburg had a torn ulnar collateral ligament, requiring Tommy John surgery, 
and about 12 to 18 months of rehabilitation.[59] In the 2010 season Strasburg 
pitched in 12 games, all starts, throwing 68 innings, 92 strikeouts and 
compiling a 2.91 ERA. He was named a pitcher on the 2010 Topps Major League 
Rookie All-Star Team.[60] Strasburg made his first rehab start on August 
7, 2011 for the Hagerstown Suns.[61] Strasburg made six rehab starts during 
the 2011 minor league season throwing a total of 20⅓ innings, with 29 strikeouts, 
compiling a 3.49 ERA and a 1–1 record. He then made 5 starts during the 
2011 major league season, his first coming against the Los Angeles Dodgers 
on September 6. That year he threw for 24 innings, struck out 24, compiled 
a 1.50 ERA and a 1–1 record.[62] In April 2012, Strasburg accumulated an 
NL-best 34 strikeouts and second-best 1.13 ERA. He totaled 6 walks and 
did not give up a home run. Consequently, he was named NL Pitcher of the 
Month.[63] On May 20, Strasburg went 2-for-2 as a hitter in a game against 
the Baltimore Orioles and hit his first career home run, a solo shot off 
of Wei-Yin Chen.[64] In his June 13 start against the Toronto Blue Jays, 
Strasburg became the first pitcher of the year to strike out 100 batters.[65] 
On July 1, Strasburg was elected to his first All-Star Game, alongside 
teammates Gio Gonzalez, Ian Desmond, and Bryce Harper.[66] Strasburg ended 
the season 15–6 with a 3.16 ERA, 1.15 WHIP and 197 strikeouts in 159⅓ innings 
pitched. Strasburg hit .277 with a home run, 7 RBI, and three walks, earning 
him a Silver Slugger Award.[67] As part of Strasburg's rehabilitation from 
his Tommy John surgery, and as a precaution due to his low innings total 
in 2011, the Nationals decided to limit the number of innings Strasburg 
would throw in the 2012 season. Although the number was never official, 
rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. 
It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would 
not pitch in the playoffs.[68] Dr. Lewis Yocum, the surgeon who operated 
on Strasburg's elbow, agreed in 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total 
should be limited, although he did not consult with Nationals General Manager 
Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season.[69] Teammate Jordan Zimmermann 
underwent a similar process the year before.[70] Strasburg's high profile 
and the success of the Nationals in the 2012 season made the innings limit 
a topic of national conversation. In addition to baseball writers, a number 
of other figures made their views on the topic known, including football 
broadcasters Troy Aikman and Terry Bradshaw,[71] basketball reporter Stephen 
A. Smith,[72] and even prominent politicians such as Rudy Giuliani[73] 
and Mitch McConnell.[74] Rizzo defended the decision to shut down Strasburg 
and criticized the buzz surrounding it: "It's a good conversational piece, 
it's a good debatable subject. But most of the people that have weighed 
in on this know probably 10 percent of the information that we know, and 
that we've made our opinion based upon."[75] The Nationals announced that 
Strasburg would be scheduled to make his final start on September 12 and 
would be replaced by John Lannan in the Nationals' starting rotation.[75] 
However, after a rough outing on September 8, Davey Johnson announced that 
Strasburg was finished for the 2012 season.[76] Strasburg spent the postseason 
on the physically unable to perform list as the Nationals lost the 2012 
NLDS to the St. Louis Cardinals in 5 games. Strasburg pitched Opening Day 
for the Nationals at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., on April 1, 2013. 
He went seven innings, giving up no runs and three hits and recording three 
strikeouts. Following the first batter of the game, Juan Pierre, he retired 
nineteen straight batters. Strasburg earned the decision, a win, with a 
final score of 2–0.[77] Strasburg served a brief stint on the disabled 
list with a mild lateral strain in June and was re-activated on June 16.[78] 
Strasburg achieved milestones in longevity in 2013. He pitched into the 
8th inning for the first time in his big-league career on May 16, in a 
win against his hometown San Diego Padres, and in subsequent starts on 
May 26 and July 24.[79] On August 11, 2013, Strasburg pitched his first 
career complete game winning, 6–0 over the Philadelphia Phillies.[80] He 
was ejected for the first time in his MLB career on August 17, 2013 by 
umpire Marvin Hudson for intentionally pitching at Braves batter Andrelton 
Simmons in the second inning of a Nationals-Braves game. Prior to the ejection, 
Hudson warned both teams after Strasburg hit Justin Upton with a first-pitch 
fastball following a Braves home run.[81] Strasburg finished the year with 
a 3.00 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, 8 Wins, 9 Losses, and 191 strikeouts over 183 innings 
pitched.[82] Strasburg enjoyed the best season of his career, leading the 
league in strikeouts and finishing 9th in the Cy Young award balloting. 
He posted career-bests in innings pitched and strikeouts. 2015 was a disappointing 
year for Strasburg and the Nationals as injuries limited his production 
to 127 innings, his lowest output since 2011. In the meantime, the Nationals 
failed to make it to the playoffs, in part due to Strasburg's unavailability. 
Despite the setbacks, he was effective in limited action, winning 11 games, 
good for third most wins in the Nationals' pitching staff. On May 9, 2016, 
it was reported that Strasburg had agreed to a 7-year, $175 million extension 
to remain with the Nationals.[83][84] The deal was made official the next 
day on May 10.[85] With the extension, Strasburg became the first National 
to receive an opt-out clause in his contract, which will allow him to elect 
free agency after the 2019 or 2020 seasons if he desires.[86] On June 26, 
2016, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to an upper back strain. 
He returned on July 3 against the Cincinnati Reds, where he took a no-hitter 
through 6.2 innings until being lifted from the game after throwing 109 
pitches. The no-hitter was broken up in the 8th inning, but the Nationals 
still won 12-1.[87] On July 8, Strasburg became the first pitcher since 
1912 to start 12-0.[88] His streak of consecutive wins ran to 16, including 
13 decisions in the 2016 season, before it was snapped by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers on July 21.[89] On August 22, Strasburg was again placed on the 
15-day disabled list due to right elbow soreness.[90] Strasburg's repertoire 
features five pitches: a four-seam fastball, his primary pitch at 95–98 
miles per hour (153–158 km/h), which was recorded as high as 100 mph early 
in his career; a two-seam fastball at 92–96 miles per hour (148–154 km/h); 
a curveball that Strasburg himself refers to as a slurve at 78–85 miles 
per hour (126–137 km/h); a changeup at 86–91 miles per hour (138–146 km/h).[91] 
and a hybrid pitch he began using regularly in the 2016 season that his 
catcher Wilson Ramos describes as a "slider-cutter," which moves laterally 
at 86–92 miles per hour (138–148 km/h).[92][93] Strasburg throws a mix 
of all his pitches to left-handed hitters, but he mostly eliminates the 
changeup when facing right-handed hitters. He is liable to throw his four-seamer 
or slurve to right-handers with two strikes, and adds the changeup in those 
counts against lefties.[94] His velocity was not significantly affected 
by his Tommy John surgery in 2010. He had the fastest four-seam fastball 
among starting pitchers in the 2012 season, averaging 96.5 miles per hour 
(155 km/h).[95] Strasburg has a high strikeout rate of 11.2 per 9 innings 
through his first 251⅓ MLB innings.[96] This corresponds with high swing-and-miss 
rates across all of his pitches, including 54% on his changeup—the highest 
whiff rate among all starting pitchers' changeups since PITCHf/x began 
tracking pitches.[97] Through the 2012 season, Strasburg's career strikeout-to-walk 
ratio of 4.67 would rank second all-time if he had enough innings to qualify.[98] 
Strasburg maintains that his high strikeout rate is not intentional, and 
in fact is a hindrance to maintaining low pitch counts.[99] Strasburg's 
pitching mechanics drew concern early in his career from scouts and coaches. 
The sequence of Strasburg's delivery was believed to place a great deal 
of stress on his arm, placing him at greater risk of elbow and shoulder 
injuries. Indeed, "several pitching coaches quietly predicted Strasburg 
was at risk" before the rupture of his elbow ligament.[100] Independent 
scout Paul Reddick compared his mechanics unfavorably with those of pitching 
legend Greg Maddux, saying Strasburg's motion was inefficient and badly 
synchronized.[101] During the 2014 season, analysts noted a slight adjustment 
in Strasburg's pitching mechanics, as he moved his back foot to rest against 
rather than partially atop the pitching rubber when going into his throwing 
motion. Strasburg explained that he had been reluctant to make the change 
but had come to believe it would improve his development. "I didn’t feel 
comfortable at first. Working at in between starts, it’s just become second 
nature," he told The Washington Post. Strasburg said he had noticed an 
improvement in his balance and timing as a result of the new foot placement.[102] 
Strasburg was born in San Diego, California,[103][104] He credits his maternal 
grandmother with helping him develop his baseball skills as a child. She 
would frequently play catch and even work on pitching with him. He labels 
her as one of his biggest inspirations.[105] He was married on January 
9, 2010, to Rachel Lackey, whom he had met while they were students at 
San Diego State.[106][107] On June 24, 2014, Strasburg stated in an interview 
that he was going to stop chewing tobacco in the wake of his college coach 
Tony Gwynn's death,[108] although he admitted to The Washington Post two
