The 2011 Minnesota Twins season was the 51st season for the franchise in 
Minnesota, and the 111th overall in the American League. The team drew 
3,168,107 fans during the year. The Twins had a poor season, falling from 
first place the year before to last in 2011. Longtime Twins pitcher and 
broadcaster Bert Blyleven was elected to the Hall of Fame on January 5, 
and inducted on July 24. On May 3, on a 42-degree Chicago Tuesday night, 
Francisco Liriano hurled the Twins' fifth no-hitter, closing down the White 
Sox. He struck out two and walked six on 123 pitches, but won 1-0.[1] Liriano's 
gem follows previous no-hitters by Jack Kralick (1962), Dean Chance (1967), 
Scott Erickson (1994) and Eric Milton (1999). To date, the Twins have been 
no-hit four times in their history. The Twins opened their June 21 game 
against the San Francisco Giants and Madison Bumgarner with four singles 
and four doubles.[2] The eight consecutive hits to open a game tied a major 
league record. After Ben Revere collected his second hit of the inning, 
Bumgarner was lifted. Only Michael Cuddyer represented the Twins at the 
All-Star Game. As a reserve outfielder, he was inserted at first base for 
two innings and went 0 for 1.[3] Slugger Jim Thome belted career homers 
number 599 and 600 on August 15.[4] He was just the eighth player in history 
to reach 600. Six days later at Target Field, Thome on the diamond with 
New York's Alex Rodriguez marked the first time since July 17, 1973 that 
two 600-home-run club members squared offâ€”on that date it was Willie Mays 
and Hank Aaron. A Twins first happened on September 6, when Chris Parmelee, 
Joe Benson and Liam Hendriks each made their major league debut in the 
same game. Starting pitcher Hendiks took the loss, striking out 4 but giving 
up four hits and all three Chicago White Sox runs. Parmelee's 2-for-4 night 
topped Benson's 0-for 3.[5] At season's end, closer Joe Nathan finished 
with 260 Minnesota saves, topping Rick Aguilera's club record of 254. Nathan 
signed as a free agent with the Texas Rangers in November. Infielders Outfielders
