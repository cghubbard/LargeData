Thomas Wentworth "Tom" Wills (19 August 1835 – 2 May 1880) was an Australian 
sportsman who is credited with being his country's first cricketer of significance 
and a pioneer of Australian rules football. Born in the British colony 
of New South Wales to a wealthy family descended from convicts, Wills grew 
up in the bush on properties owned by his father, the pastoralist and politician 
Horatio Wills, in what is now the Australian state of Victoria. He befriended 
local Aborigines, learning their language and customs. At the age of 14, 
Wills was sent to England to attend Rugby School, where he became captain 
of its cricket team, and played an early version of rugby football. After 
Rugby, Wills represented the Cambridge University Cricket Club in the annual 
match against Oxford, and played at first-class level for Kent and the 
Marylebone Cricket Club. An athletic all-rounder with devastating bowling 
skills, he was regarded as one of the finest young cricketers in England. 
Returning to Victoria in 1856, Wills achieved Australia-wide stardom as 
a cricketer, captaining the Victorian team to repeated victories in intercolonial 
matches. He played for many clubs, most notably the Melbourne Cricket Club, 
with which he had a fraught and complex relationship. In 1858 he called 
for the formation of a "foot-ball club" with a "code of laws" to keep cricketers 
fit during the off-season. After founding the Melbourne Football Club the 
following year, Wills and three other members codified the first laws of 
Australian rules football. He and his cousin H. C. A. Harrison spearheaded 
the sport as captains, umpires and administrators. In 1861, at the height 
of his fame, Wills joined his father on an eight-month trek into the Queensland 
outback to establish a family property. Two weeks after their arrival, 
Wills' father and 18 others were murdered in the largest massacre of settlers 
by Aborigines in Australian history. Wills survived and returned to Victoria 
in 1864. He continued to play football and cricket, and, in 1866–67, coached 
and captained an Aboriginal XI—the first Australian cricket team to tour 
England. In a career marked by controversy, Wills challenged cricket's 
amateur-professional divide, and was frequently accused of bending rules 
to the point of cheating. Called for throwing in 1872, he mounted a failed 
comeback four years later on the eve of the first Test cricket match, by 
which time his sporting glory belonged to a colonial past that seemed "like 
a distant land".[1] Psychological trauma from the massacre was worsened 
by his alcoholism. Now destitute, Wills was admitted to the Melbourne Hospital 
in 1880, suffering from delirium tremens, but shortly afterwards escaped 
and returned to his home on the city's margins, where he committed suicide 
by stabbing himself in the heart. Wills fell into obscurity after his death, 
but has undergone a revival in Australian culture since the 1990s. He was 
an inaugural inductee into the Australian Football Hall of Fame, and is 
the subject of a statue outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Today he 
is characterised as an archetype of the tragic sports hero, and as a symbol 
of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The 
theory that he incorporated features of an Aboriginal game into Australian 
football has been hotly debated. According to biographer Greg de Moore, 
Wills "stands alone in all his absurdity, his cracked egalitarian heroism 
and his fatal self-destructiveness—the finest cricketer and footballer 
of the age."[2] Tom Wills was born on 19 August 1835 on the Molonglo Plain[a] 
near modern-day Canberra, in what was the British penal colony of New South 
Wales, as the elder child[b] of Horatio and Elizabeth (née McGuire) Wills.[4] 
Tom was a third-generation Australian of convict descent: his mother was 
born to convicts from Ireland, and his paternal grandfather was Edward 
Wills, an English highwayman whose death sentence was commuted to transportation, 
arriving in Botany Bay aboard the "hell ship" Hillsborough in 1799.[5] 
After receiving a conditional pardon in 1803, Edward amassed immense wealth 
through mercantile activity in Sydney with his free wife Sarah (née Harding).[6] 
He died in 1811, five months before Horatio's birth, and Sarah remarried 
to convict George Howe, owner of Australia's first newspaper, The Sydney 
Gazette.[7] During his tenure as the newspaper's editor, Horatio met Elizabeth, 
an orphan from Parramatta. They married in December 1833.[8] Seventeen 
months after his birth, Tom was baptised Thomas Wentworth Wills in St Andrew's, 
Sydney, in honour of statesman William Wentworth.[3] Drawing on Wentworth's 
pro-currency rhetoric and the emancipist cause, Horatio, in his nationalist 
journal The Currency Lad (1832–33), became the first advocate of an Australian 
republic.[9] Horatio took up pastoral pursuits in the mid-1830s and moved 
with his family to the sheep run "Burra Burra" on the Molonglo River.[10] 
Although athletic from an early age, Tom was prone to illness, and at one 
stage in 1839 his parents "almost despaired of his recovery".[11] In November 
1840, in light of Thomas Mitchell's discovery of "Australia Felix", they 
overlanded south to the Grampians in the colony's Port Phillip District 
(now the state of Victoria); and, after establishing a run on Mount William, 
moved a few miles north through the foothills of Mount Ararat, named so 
by Horatio because "like the Ark, we rested there".[12] Horatio went through 
a period of intense religiosity while in the Grampians; at times his diary 
descends into incantation, "perhaps even madness".[13] He implored himself 
and Tom to base their lives upon the New Testament.[14] Living under canvas, 
the Wills family settled on a large property named "Lexington" (near present-day 
Moyston) in an area inhabited by Djab wurrung Aboriginal clans.[15] Tom, 
as an only child, "was thrown much into the companionship of aborigines".[16] 
In an account of corroborees from childhood, his cousin H. C. A. Harrison[c] 
remembered Tom's ability to learn Aboriginal songs, mimic their voice and 
gestures, and "speak their language as fluently as they did themselves, 
much to their delight."[17] It is speculated that Tom may have also played 
Aboriginal sports.[18] Horatio wrote fondly of his son's kinship with Aborigines, 
and allowed local clans to live and hunt on Lexington.[19] However, like 
many frontiersmen in the area, Horatio was implicated in deadly conflict 
with Aborigines, the occurrence of which he blamed on "distant predatory 
tribes".[d] Tom's first sibling, Emily, was born on Christmas Day 1842.[20] 
In 1846 Wills began attendance at William Brickwood's School in Melbourne. 
There he was looked after by Horatio's brother Thomas (Tom's namesake[3]), 
a Victorian separatist and son-in-law of the Wills family's partner in 
the shipping trade, convict Mary Reibey.[21] Tom played in his first cricket 
matches at school, and he came in contact with the Melbourne Cricket Club 
through Brickwood, the club's vice-president.[22] Wills returned to Lexington 
in 1849 where the family had grown to include siblings Cedric, Horace and 
Egbert.[23] Mainly self-educated, Horatio had ambitious plans for the education 
of his children, especially Tom:[14] I now deeply vainly deplore my want 
of a mathematical and classical education. Vain regret! ... But my son! 
May he prove worthy of my experience! May I be spared for him—that he may 
be useful to his country—I never knew a father's care. Wills' father sent 
him to England in February 1850, aged fourteen, to attend Rugby School, 
the most prestigious school in the country.[24] Horatio wanted Tom to study 
law and return to Australia as a "professional man of eminence".[25] He 
arrived in London after a five-month sea voyage. There, during school holidays, 
he stayed with his paternal aunt Sarah, who moved from Sydney after the 
death of her first husband, convict William Redfern.[24] The reforms enacted 
by famed headmaster Thomas Arnold made Rugby the crucible of muscular Christianity, 
a "cult of athleticism" into which Wills was inculcated.[26] Wills took 
up cricket within a week of entering Evans House.[27] At first he bowled 
underhand, but it was considered outdated, so he tried roundarm bowling. 
He clean bowled a batsman with his first ball using this style and declared: 
"I felt I was a bowler."[28] Wills soon topped all of his house's cricket 
statistics.[29] At bat he was a "punisher" with a sound defence; however, 
in an era when graceful stroke-play was expected of gentlemen cricketers, 
he was deemed to have no style at all.[30] In April 1852, aged sixteen, 
Wills joined the Rugby School XI, and on his debut at Lord's a few months 
later, against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), he took a match-high 
12 wickets.[31] That year he formed one half of a bowling attack that established 
Rugby as the greatest public school in English cricket.[31] In a prelude 
to his colonial career, he was accused of throwing by critics in the national 
media.[32] Rugby coach John Lillywhite, himself a key campaigner against 
throwing, defended his protégé. Wills survived the scandal.[33] He won 
fame for his performances and played with the leading cricketers of the 
age, as well as royalty.[34] William Clarke, his hero, invited him to join 
the touring All-England Eleven, but he remained at Rugby.[35] Then in 1855 
he took over as Rugby XI captain, the most revered position within the 
school.[36] "I know that if I [study] too hard I will become quite ill. 
We hardly get any play during school time." Rugby, like other English public 
schools, had evolved its own variant of football.[38] The game in Wills' 
era—a rough and highly defensive struggle involving hundreds of boys—was 
confined to a competition amongst the houses.[39] Spanning the years he 
played, Wills is pivotal to any of the brief match reports in Bell's Life 
in London.[40] His creative play and "eel-like agility" baffled the opposition, 
and his penchant for theatrics endeared him to the crowds.[41] One journalist 
noted his use of "slimy tricks", a possible early reference to his gamesmanship.[41] 
As a "dodger" in the forward line, he was a long and accurate shot at goal 
and served as his house's kicker.[42] Wills also shone in the school's 
annual athletics carnival and his long-distance running ability in Hare 
and Hounds was unparalleled.[43] Wills cut a dashing figure with "impossibly 
wavy" hair and blue, almond-shaped eyes that "[burnt] with a pale light".[44] 
By age 16 at 5'8" he was already taller than his father.[45] In Lillywhite's 
Guide a few years later he measured in at 5'10" and it was written that 
"few athletes can boast of a more muscular and well-developed frame".[46] 
Consumed by sport, Wills, to his father's chagrin, made little progress 
in academics.[47] It was said that he "could not bring himself to study 
for professional work" after "having led a sort of nomadic life when a 
youth in Australia".[48] Suffering from homesickness, he decorated his 
study with objects to remind him of Lexington, including Aboriginal weapons.[49] 
Horatio wrote to remind him of his childhood friends, the Djab wurrung: 
"They told me to send you up to them as soon as you came back."[50] Wills 
was regarded as "one of the most promising cricketers in the kingdom".[51] 
Hailed as Rugby's exemplar sportsman, his status as a cricketer came to 
define him in the eyes of others.[52] In June 1855, nearing his 20th birthday, 
Wills left Rugby, and in a farewell note from his fellow students he was 
simply called "the school bowler".[53] After leaving Rugby, and with a 
steady supply of money from his father, Wills roamed Britain in pursuit 
of cricketing pleasure. He made first-class appearances for the MCC, Kent, 
and various Gentlemen sides, and also fell in with the I Zingari—the "gypsy 
lords of English cricket"—an amateur club known for its exotic costumes 
and hedonistic lifestyle.[54] Against Horatio's wishes, Tom did not continue 
his studies at Cambridge, but did play cricket for the university's team 
(as well as Magdalene College), most notably when rules were passed over 
to allow him to compete against Oxford in the 1856 University Match, Cambridge 
being "one man short".[55] In June, Wills played cricket at Rugby School 
for the last time, representing the MCC alongside Lord Guernsey, the Earl 
of Winterton, and Charles du Cane, governor-to-be of Tasmania.[56] Following 
a month of cricket in Ireland, Wills, at the behest of Horatio, returned 
to England to prepare for his journey home.[57] The last eighteen months 
had exposed Wills to "the richest sporting experience on earth".[58] His 
six years in England charted a way of life—one of drinking, profligate 
spending and playing games—that he would continue to lead until his death.[58] 
Wills returned to Australia aboard the Oneida steamship, arriving in Melbourne 
on 23 December 1856. The minor port city of his youth had risen to world 
renown as the booming financial centre of the Victorian gold rush.[59] 
Horatio, now a member of the Legislative Assembly in the Victorian Parliament, 
was living on "Belle Vue", a farm at Point Henry near Geelong, the Wills' 
family home since 1853.[60] In his first summer back in Melbourne, Wills 
stayed with his extended family, the Harrisons, at their home on Victoria 
Parade, and entered a Collins Street law firm to appease his father, but 
he seems never to have practiced; the few comments he made about law suggest 
it meant little to him.[61] "Tom was no dunce", writes Greg de Moore. He 
was "negotiating a path to greatness."[62] The Australian colonies were 
described as "cricket mad" in the 1850s, and Victorians, in particular, 
were said to live "in an atmosphere of cricket".[63] Intercolonial contests, 
first held in 1851, provided an outlet for the at times intense rivalry 
between Victoria and New South Wales. With his reputation preceding him, 
Wills became the bearer of Victoria's hopes of winning its first match 
against the elder colony.[64] Victorian captain William Hammersley recalled 
the moment Wills first graced the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) for a 
trial match, staged one week after his return:[46] ... the observed of 
all observers, with his Zingari stripe and somewhat flashy get up, fresh 
from Rugby and college, with the polish of the old country upon him. He 
was then a model of muscular Christianity. Wills' batting style amused 
the crowd, but he still top scored with 57 not out.[65] In January, he 
travelled as part of the Victoria cricket team to Sydney to play against 
New South Wales on the Domain. Wills was the leading wicket-taker with 
10 victims. Bowling fast round-arm, the Victorians regarded themselves 
as superior to their opponents, who used an "antiquated" underhand action. 
The latter style proved effective, giving New South Wales a 65-run win.[66] 
Wills spent the rest of the season playing for numerous clubs, most notably 
the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC).[67] Parliament and business came to a 
standstill in Melbourne for the January 1858 intercolonial match between 
Victoria and New South Wales, held at the MCG. Captaining Victoria, Wills 
took 8 wickets, the most of his side, and on the second day, batting in 
the middle order, a ball hit an imperfection in the pitch and knocked him 
unconscious. He recovered, played on for two hours, and won the match at 
day's end with a top score of 49*.[69] The crowd rushed the field and chaired 
Wills off in triumph, and victory celebrations lasted for several days 
throughout the colony.[70] Now a household name and the darling of Melbourne's 
elite, Wills was proclaimed "the greatest cricketer in the land".[71] Although 
Wills enjoyed his lofty amateur status, he liked to socialise with and 
support working class professional cricketers—an egalitarian attitude that 
sometimes led to conflict with sporting officialdom but endeared him to 
the common man.[72] Wills' allegiance to professionals was highlighted 
by an incident in Tasmania in February 1858 when the Launceston Cricket 
Club shunned professional members of his touring Victorian side. Infuriated, 
he spoke out against being "forsaken" in a "strange land". One week later, 
during a game in Hobart, Wills earned the locals' ire as he "[jumped] about 
exultantly" after maiming a Tasmanian batsman with a spell of hostile fast 
bowling.[73] Wills was elected secretary of the MCC during the 1857–58 
season.[74] It was a role in which he proved to be chaotic and disorganised. 
MCC delegates took issue with Wills' "continued non-attendance" at meetings, 
and when the club fell into debt, his poor administrative skills were blamed.[75] 
He acted on year-long threats in mid-1858 and deserted the MCC, leaving 
its records and amenities in a mess; to this day, the only minutes that 
cannot be found are from his secretaryship.[76] A lasting tension existed 
between Wills and the MCC's inner circle. According to Martin Flanagan, 
"It was a relationship which couldn't last as Wills only knew one way—his 
own."[77] Wills was a compulsive writer to the press on cricketing matters 
and in the late 1850s his letters sometimes appeared on a daily basis.[79] 
An agitator like his father, he used language "in the manner of a speaker 
declaiming forcefully from a platform".[80] On 10 July 1858, the Melbourne-based 
Bell's Life in Victoria and Sporting Chronicle published a letter by Wills 
that is regarded as a catalyst for a new style of football, known today 
as Australian rules football.[81] Titled "Winter Practice", it begins:[82] 
Now that cricket has been put aside for some few months to come, and cricketers 
have assumed somewhat of the chrysalis nature (for a time only 'tis true), 
but at length will again burst forth in all their varied hues, rather than 
allow this state of torpor to creep over them, and stifle their new supple 
limbs, why can they not, I say, form a foot-ball club, and form a committee 
of three or more to draw up a code of laws? In endeavouring to bring his 
English sporting experience to Melbourne, Wills made the first public declaration 
of its kind in Australia: that football should be a regular and organised 
activity.[83] He went on to help foster football in Melbourne's schools. 
The local headmasters, his collaborators, were inspired in large part by 
Thomas Hughes' novel Tom Brown's School Days (1857), an account of life 
at Rugby School under the headship of Thomas Arnold.[84] Due to similarities 
between their sporting careers at Rugby, Wills has been called the "real-life 
embodiment" of fictitious hero Tom Brown.[85] Wills' letter was alluded 
to two weeks later in an advertisement posted by his friend, professional 
cricketer and publican Jerry Bryant, for a "scratch match" held adjacent 
to the MCG at the Richmond Paddock. It was the first of several kickabouts 
held that year involving Wills, Bryant and other local cricketers.[86] 
One participant called the affair "football Babel"; a "short code of rules" 
were to be drawn up afterwards, however this does not seem to have occurred.[87] 
Another landmark game, played without fixed rules over three consecutive 
Saturdays and co-umpired by Wills and John Macadam, began on the same site 
on 7 August between forty Scotch College students and a like number from 
Melbourne Grammar.[88] The two schools have since competed annually.[89] 
Wills emerged as the standout figure in accounts of Melbourne football 
in 1858.[90] These early experimental games were more rugby-like than anything 
else—low-scoring, low-to-the-ground "gladiatorial" tussles.[91] The last 
recorded match of the year is the subject of the first known Australian 
football poem, published in Punch. Wills, the only player named, is reified 
as "the Melbourne chief", leading his men to victory against a side from 
South Yarra.[92] Following a scratch match at the start of the 1859 football 
season, the Melbourne Football Club officially came into being on 14 May.[93] 
Three days later, Wills and three other members—journalists Hammersley 
and J. B. Thompson and teacher Thomas H. Smith—met at Bryant's Parade Hotel 
near the MCG to pen the club's rules.[94] Wills heads the list of signatories.[95] 
The men went over the rules of four English schools; Hammersley recalled 
Wills' preference for the Rugby game, but it was found to be confusing 
and too violent.[96] Subsequently, they rejected common features such as 
"hacking" (shin-kicking) and devised a simple code of ten rules suited 
to grown men and Australian conditions.[97] Wills, too, saw the need for 
compromise.[98] He wrote to his brother Horace: "Rugby was not a game for 
us, we wanted a winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the 
ground so we thought differently."[95] Thompson and Hammersley's promotion 
of the new code, together with Wills' star power, encouraged the spread 
of football throughout Victoria. After falling out with the MCC, Wills 
moved freely about the colony, playing for any club of his choosing. He 
joined Richmond, serving as vice-president and raising the standard of 
its play to make it the premier Victorian club.[99] His presence greatly 
distorted the outcome of and betting on games, and his lack of loyalty 
to any one club was regarded with contempt by the MCC.[100] Wills was reappointed 
captain of Victoria for the January 1859 intercolonial against New South 
Wales, held at the Domain. He broke his right middle finger on day one 
while attempting a catch. Undeterred, Wills top scored in the first innings 
with 15* and took 5/24 and 6/25, carrying Victoria to an upset win.[101] 
He resigned from the intercolonial match committee in protest of Thompson 
assailing him for not practicing ahead of the next match against New South 
Wales. During a follow-up practice match, players struggled in the day's 
heat, and ignoring calls to retire, Wills suffered a near-fatal sunstroke. 
Hammersley wrote that Wills felt obliged to perform for the large crowd 
that had gathered to watch him.[102] Over 25,000 people attended the MCG 
in February 1860 to see Victoria, captained by Wills, play New South Wales. 
Wills bowled unchanged in both innings, taking 6/23 and 3/16, and top scored 
with 20*. Victoria won by 69 runs.[103] The Melbourne media gave Wills 
the sobriquet "Great Gun of the Colony".[104] The Victorian Cricketers' 
Guide called him the ideal all-rounder.[105] The Sydney press, championing 
Wills as a native New South Welshman, agreed:[106] Tall, muscular, and 
slender, Mr. Wills seems moulded by nature to excel in every branch of 
the noble game, ... on the field we find him the admiration of the ground, 
while in the combination of his successes, [his teammates] recognise with 
pride the still more arduous duties of an unwearied and most discreet captain. 
"I think the ground should be free to all, so that the captain of each 
side could dispose of his forces in any position he likes; and when this 
is done, and the ball is carried on from one end of the ground to the other, 
by a succession of good, well-directed kicks, to the hands of those that 
the ball was intended for, ... it has a very pretty effect, and is the 
result of some skill." Wills remained an influential figure in Australian 
football from 1859 to 1860.[108] While he fought for the adoption of many 
Rugby School customs—such as a free kick for marking, the use of an oval-shaped 
ball, and (unsuccessfully) a crossbar—he improvised on the field and devised 
innovative tactics and strategies, pushing the game in new directions. 
His exploitation of the code's lack of an offside law in 1860 has been 
cited as the point at which "the full potential of the sport started to 
be realised".[109] At Wills' invitation, his cousin Harrison joined the 
footballing scene in 1859, quickly becoming a leading player and captain.[110] 
He looked up to Wills, terming him "the beau-ideal of an athlete"—high 
praise given that Harrison was the champion runner of Victoria.[111] Their 
presence in Geelong fuelled a local craze for football and ensured the 
Geelong Football Club's supremacy in the early 1860s.[112] In an era when 
players moved freely amongst clubs, Wills still represented Melbourne, 
and was the first captain and secretary of the Richmond Football Club (no 
connection with the AFL club) in 1860.[113] The code underwent revisions 
around this time, principally in response to the on-field actions of dominant 
players. "And there were none more dominant than Wills and Harrison", writes 
James Coventry.[114] With plans underway for the first tour of Australia 
by an English cricket team, Wills announced his retirement from sport. 
At the beckoning of his father, Wills agreed to leave Victoria to found 
a new family property, Cullin-la-ringo, on the Nogoa River in outback Queensland.[115] 
He prepared for six months in country Victoria where learnt the crafts 
of a squatter.[116] In his will, Horatio—showing a "deep understanding" 
of Tom's personality—wrote that his son would be removed from the station 
and receive a diminished inheritance in the event of "misconducting himself" 
as manager.[117] In January 1861, Tom, Horatio and a party of employees 
and their families travelled by steamer to Brisbane, disembarked in Moreton 
Bay, and then, with livestock and supplies, set out on an eight-month trek 
through Queensland's rugged interior.[116] Food was scarce and Tom hunted 
native game to fend off starvation.[118] They suffered many other hardships 
and even death when, in Toowoomba, one of Horatio's men drowned.[118] On 
the Darling Downs over 10,000 sheep were collected.[119] The size of the 
Wills party attracted the attention of local Aborigines, and the two groups 
engaged in games of mimicry.[120] Wary of entering the region's frontier 
war, Horatio maintained a conciliatory attitude to the Aborigines.[121] 
The party reached Cullin-la-ringo, situated on Kairi Aboriginal land, in 
early October, and proceeded to set up camp.[122] On the afternoon of 17 
October, two weeks after their arrival, Horatio and eighteen of his party 
were murdered in the deadliest massacre of settlers by Aborigines in Australian 
history.[123] Tom was away from the property at the time, having been sent 
with two stockmen to collect supplies left en route to Cullin-la-Ringo. 
He returned several days later to a scene of devastation.[120] Despairing 
and in shock, Wills first wrote to Harrison in Melbourne: "... all our 
party except I have been slaughtered by the black's ... I am in a great 
fix no men."[124] Police, native police and vigilante groups from neighbouring 
stations swiftly tracked down and killed at least 70 local Aborigines; 
the total may have been 300.[125] Wills took refuge near Cullin-la-ringo, 
and though he desired to avenge his father's death, there is no evidence 
that he joined the reprisal raids.[126] Conflicting reports reached the 
outside world and for a time it was feared that Tom had died.[127] In the 
press, Horatio was accused of ignoring warnings and allowing Aborigines 
to encroach on his property.[128] The retribution was also called excessive.[129] 
Tom vehemently defended his father against any perceived criticism.[128] 
Privately, in his letter to Harrison, he admitted, "if we had used common 
precaution all would have been well".[130] It was later revealed that, 
prior to leaving the camp, Tom advised Horatio to be watchful of the local 
Aborigines, but according to Hammersley, "the old man prided himself on 
being able to manage the blacks ... and said they would never harm him."[131] 
The Queensland press, still in the wake of the massacre, suggested that 
Wills, "now a Queenslander", be approached to captain the colony's cricket 
team.[132] Different reasons were put forward at the time to account for 
the Wills tragedy.[133] For many colonists, it confirmed the popular belief 
that Aborigines were bloodthirsty savages.[134] Tom never articulated his 
version of events in writing, but Cedric Wills wrote years later that it 
was an act of revenge for an attack made on local Aborigines by squatter 
Jesse Gregson. He quoted Tom as saying, "If the truth is ever known, you 
will find that it was through Gregson shooting those blacks; that was the 
cause of the murder."[130] In the years following the massacre, Wills experienced 
flashbacks, nightmares and an irritable heart—features of what is now known 
as post-traumatic stress disorder. Having immersed himself in the drinking 
culture of colonial sport, he increased his alcohol consumption in a likely 
attempt to blot out memories and alleviate sleep disturbance.[135] Wills' 
sister Emily wrote of him two months after the massacre: "He says he never 
felt so changed in the whole course of his life".[136] Wills vowed to stay 
on Cullin-la-ringo and fulfill his father's agrarian dream—words that, 
according to de Moore, "enshrined and imprisoned" Tom as the new head of 
the family.[137] Hypervigilant, he slept only three hours a night with 
a rifle beside his bed and watched for signs of another attack.[138] He 
began to rebuild the station pending the arrival of his uncle, William 
Roope, who took control of Cullin-la-ringo in December 1861, but soon left 
as a result of Wills acting "exceedingly ill" to him.[139] Wills struggled 
to cope with the harsh conditions and isolation of the outback. He went 
blind for weeks after contracting "sandy blight". He went to Sydney in 
January 1863 to captain Victoria against New South Wales on the Domain. 
The match turned into a riot when the crowd invaded the field during a 
dispute over the Victorian umpire's impartiality. Wills, leading his men 
from the Domain, was struck in the face by a stone, and professionals George 
Marshall and William Greaves fled the city, reducing the Victorian side 
to nine players. Wills took 8 wickets and top scored in both innings (25* 
and 17*), but Victoria lost by 84 runs. The Melbourne media castigated 
Wills for allowing the game to continue and called him a traitor when evidence 
surfaced that he agreed to play for New South Wales in the weeks prior 
to the match. He denied all accusations and wrote in an angry letter to 
The Sydney Morning Herald: "I for one do not think that Victoria will ever 
send an Eleven up here again."[140] Back in Victoria, he became engaged 
to Julie Anderson, a farmer's daughter from Skipton and friend of the Wills 
family. Her name does not appear in any of Wills' surviving letters; he 
rarely mentioned the women he courted, let alone his feelings towards them.[141] 
Wills stayed in Geelong for the start of the 1863 football season, breaking 
his promise of an early return to Cullin-la-ringo, much to the dismay of 
his mother and the holding's trustees.[142] Wills finally returned to Queensland 
in May and was sworn in as a Justice of the Peace upon arrival in Brisbane.[143] 
Over the next few months, he reported at least three murders of local settlers 
by Aborigines, including that of a shepherd on Cullin-la-ringo.[144] He 
accosted government officials over the lack of protection against Aboriginal 
attacks and scorned "Brisbane saints" for sympathising with the plight 
of Aborigines in the Nogoa region.[145] With the cricket season approaching, 
Wills agreed to captain Queensland against New South Wales, and then left 
the station to lead a Victoria XXII at the MCG against George Parr's All-England 
Eleven.[146] In awe of his cross-continental dash to play cricket, the 
English thought it a madman's journey.[147] Wills arrived on the final 
day of the match to a thunderous reception, and joined the visitors on 
their Victorian tour.[148] During the 1863–64 season, Wills' engagement 
to Anderson broke off, possibly due to his womanising,[149] and it was 
revealed that he had been squandering family finances on alcohol while 
claiming it as station expenditure. The trustees demanded that he stay 
in Victoria to answer for the property's runaway debt.[150] In response, 
Wills joined Parr's XI on a month-long tour New Zealand. He captained local 
teams against the English and filled the same role for Victoria at the 
tour's end in Melbourne.[151] He faced the trustees soon after. His mother 
struggled to condemn him but ultimately approved his dismissal from Cullin-la-ringo, 
thus fulfilling the premonition in Horatio's will.[152] Wills stayed at 
the family home in Geelong. Always a black sheep of sorts, he now became 
increasingly estranged from his mother and sister Emily.[153] Family letters 
from mid-1864 reveal that Wills had a "wife"—a "bad woman" according to 
Emily. It is likely a reference to the already-married Sarah Barbor (née 
Duff). Born in Dublin, she is a mysterious figure, but is known to have 
remained Wills' lifelong partner. The de facto nature of their relationship, 
and even Barbor's existence, were probably kept secret from Wills' mother 
for a number of years.[154] Throughout the 1865 football season, Wills 
played for and often captained Melbourne and Geelong, two of the game's 
most powerful clubs. At the end of a winter beset with public brawls over 
which team "owned" him, Wills moved to Geelong for the remainder of his 
career, prompting Bell's Life in Victoria to report that Melbourne had 
lost "the finest leader of men on the football field".[155] The following 
year, when the running bounce and other rules were formalised at a meeting 
of club delegates under Harrison's chairmanship, Wills was not present; 
his move to Geelong had rendered him peripheral to the process of rule-making 
in Melbourne.[156] Intercolonials between Victoria and New South Wales 
resumed at the MCG on Boxing Day 1865, nearly three years since the Sydney 
riot. Sam Cosstick, William Caffyn and other Victorian professionals defected 
to the rival colony due to pay disputes with the MCC. Wills, leading the 
weakened Victorian side to an against-the-odds win, took 6 wickets and 
contributed 58—the first half century in Australian first-class cricket—to 
285, a record intercolonial total.[157] Cheating allegations against Wills 
failed to endanger his status as a folk hero and "a source of eternal hope" 
for Victoria.[158] In May 1866, the MCC's minute book featured an unusual 
request: Roland Newbury, the club's pavilion keeper, wanted "use of the 
ground for two days ... for purpose of a match with the native black eleven".[159] 
It was the first intimation of a cricket match between the MCC and an Aboriginal 
team from Victoria's Western District.[160] The motive behind the match, 
scheduled for late December, was a financial one, and in August, Wills 
agreed to coach the Aborigines. Wills' reasons for accepting the role remain 
a mystery, but his need for money was likely a factor.[161] This was to 
mark the beginning of his transition from amateur to professional sportsman.[162] 
Wills travelled inland in November to Edenhope and Harrow to convene the 
players from local pastoral properties, where they worked as station hands.[163] 
One of their employers, William Hayman, acted as the team's manager and 
"protector".[164] They were mostly Jardwadjali men who shared common vocabulary 
with the neighbouring Djab wurrung people, which enabled Wills to use the 
Aboriginal language he learnt as a child.[165] From their training ground 
at Lake Wallace, Wills, in a "tactical strike", boasted to the Melbourne 
press of the Aborigines' powers, especially the batsmanship of Mullagh,[e] 
spurring an anxious MCC to strengthen its ranks with players from outside 
the club.[166] Public sympathy was with the Aborigines when they arrived 
in Melbourne and over 10,000 spectators attended the MCG on Boxing Day 
to witness the match.[167] Wills captained the team in a losing struggle 
and afterwards spoke defiantly against the MCC's "treachery".[168] It is 
unknown what Wills and the Aborigines made of the broader social and political 
dimensions of the enterprise.[169] Some of Wills' contemporaries were shocked 
that he would associate with Aborigines in the shadow of his father's death.[170] 
Others, such as this writer in The Empire, called him a hero:[171] Although 
you may not be fully aware of the fact, allow me to tell you that you have 
rendered a greater service to the aboriginal races of this country and 
to humanity, than any man who has hitherto attempted to uphold the title 
of the blacks to rank amongst men. While Melburnians were enthralled by 
the Aborigines, the annual intercolonial between Victoria and New South 
Wales—usually the season highlight—failed to excite public interest, and 
Victoria's loss in Sydney was put down to Wills' absence.[172] The Aboriginal 
team embarked on a tour of Victoria, improving as it went. After an easy 
win in Geelong, Wills, without warning his mother, took the players to 
meet her at "Belle Vue".[173] Back in Melbourne in mid-January, two of 
the Aborigines, Bullocky and Cuzens, joined Wills in representing Victoria 
against a Tasmanian XVI.[174] The team's successes provoked a public discourse 
over past mistreatment of Aboriginal people and future relations between 
the races.[175] Wills' role took on a symbolic significance. His status 
as a 'native' (a native-born Australian) was used to identify him with 
his 'native' teammates, and he was also noted for speaking in "their own 
lingo".[176] Jellico, the "team jester", joked: "[Wills] too much along 
of us. He speak nothing now but blackfellow talk."[177] They went to Sydney 
in February to begin a planned tour of the colonies and overseas.[178] 
Aware of the tour's lucrative potential, Englishman Charles Lawrence, captain 
of New South Wales, invited the team to stay at his hotel on Manly Beach.[179] 
The first match against his club at the Albert Ground in Redfern came to 
a dramatic halt when Wills was arrested and briefly gaoled for a breach 
of contract.[180] He and W. E. B. Gurnett, the tour promoter, had been 
vying to take over as manager.[181] Wills had correctly suspected Gurnett 
of being a con artist, for he embezzled the funds, leaving the team stranded 
and broke.[182] With any hope of a trip abroad dashed, Lawrence set up 
a "benefit" match, and by the end of the tour's New South Wales leg, had 
usurped Wills as captain.[183] No longer feted by the media, they returned 
to Victoria in May, and Wills was playing football soon after reaching 
Geelong.[184] It has been said that he exercised a "bad influence" upon 
the Aborigines with his drinking habit.[185] Four players died on tour; 
one death, that of Watty, was officially linked to alcohol.[186] The surviving 
members formed part of the Aboriginal team which Lawrence took to England 
in 1868, ten years before the first Australian XI classed as representative 
went overseas.[187] Wills resented Lawrence for reviving the team without 
him; his exclusion has been called the tragedy of his sporting career.[188] 
Without career prospects outside of sport, Wills joined the MCC as a professional 
at the start of the 1867–68 season; however, he was not openly referred 
to as such. Instead, the club devised the title of 'tutor' in order that 
he maintain the prestige of his amateur background.[189] Played on the 
MCG, the December 1867 intercolonial between Victoria and New South Wales 
ended in a sound victory for the former, principally due to Wills' nine-wicket 
haul and Richard Wardill's century.[190] Wills had been Victoria's preferred 
captain for over a decade. Writing in his sports column, Hammersley claimed 
that, as a paid cricketer, Wills lacked "moral ascendancy" over amateurs.[191] 
When he lost the captaincy to Wardill, an amateur, on the eve of the March 
1869 match against New South Wales, he refused to play under him, or, indeed, 
anyone else. The Victorians condemned Wills and resolved to go on without 
him, after which he retracted his decision not to play. This was the last 
intercolonial played on the Domain and Victoria recovered from Wardill's 
diamond duck to win by 78 runs. Wills scalped 7 wickets in a single innings.[191] 
Wills announced in early 1869 that he would not play for Victoria again, 
even if the colony wanted him.[192] He planned to leave for Cullin-la-ringo, 
but his mother, still "very dissatisfied" with him, requested that he stay 
away from the property.[193] The MCC took him back and he continued to 
act as a tutor with the club.[194] Members of the recently returned Aboriginal 
XI, Mullagh and Cuzens, joined him as paid bowlers.[195] Barred from having 
Wills in matches against the MCC, Geelong was allowed to field an extra 
five men to make up for his loss.[194] Wills' appearance had deteriorated; 
gaining weight, balding and generally unkempt, with "an alcoholic blush 
of his cheeks", he looked older than his years.[196] Describing his body 
as "stiff" during a cricket match in 1870, he hinted, for the first time, 
that his talent was fading.[197] For Mr. Wills to no-ball Mr. Wardill for 
throwing is like Satan reproving sin. Hardly a year had passed since Wills' 
return to Australia in 1856 without public comment on his suspect bowling 
action.[199] As the most famous and outspoken colonial bowler to be accused 
of throwing, Wills became a "convenient caricature" of the cheat in cricket.[200] 
For years his amateur status and "transcendent skill" had protected him, 
as had the collusion of Victorian newspapers, clubs and spectators, but 
now an ageing professional, the campaign against his throwing gathered 
strength. In February 1870, Wills captained Victoria to a 265-run win over 
New South Wales at the MCG. The match featured Twopenny, an Aboriginal 
paceman who was said to have been recruited by opposing captain Lawrence 
as a foil to Wills' "chucks".[201] Comparing the two, the Melbourne press 
surmised: "Undoubtedly Wills throws sometimes, but there is some decency 
about it, some disguise."[202] In March, Victoria trounced a Tasmanian 
XVI in Launceston under Wills' leadership, though not without criticism 
of his bowling action.[203] The accusations of throwing were growing louder, 
and one-time ally Hammersley emerged as Wills' most vocal critic.[204] 
In the face of a looming crisis in his career, Wills admitted to throwing 
in his 1870–71 Australian Cricketers' Guide, and in so doing taunted his 
enemies to stop him.[205] "If I cannot hit your wicket or make you give 
a chance soon, I'll hit you and hurt you if I can. I'll frighten you out." 
Wills was cast as a villain for inciting a "plague" of throwing, especially 
among younger bowlers.[207] Hammersley claimed that an ageing Wills resorted 
to throwing to maintain pace, and he was criticised for introducing a type 
of bouncer designed to injure and intimidate batsmen.[206] Nonetheless, 
he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against 
New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score 
of 39* was offset by his on-field drunkenness and a reluctance to bowl 
for fear of being called. Victoria won by 48 runs.[208] Not long after, 
amidst rumours of a conspiracy against him, Wills was no-balled for throwing 
for the first time in a club match.[209] A series of superb club cricket 
performances removed any doubt that Wills would play for Victoria in the 
next intercolonial against New South Wales, scheduled for March 1872 on 
the MCG.[210] Before the game, representatives from both colonies met and 
signed a bilateral agreement designed to call Wills. When he opened the 
bowling, Wills became the first cricketer to be called for throwing in 
a senior Australian match. He was called two more times in two overs, and 
did not bowl again.[211] He was again no-balled when a Victorian side lost 
under his captaincy to a combined XIII from New South Wales, Tasmania and 
South Australia late in 1872.[212] Hammersley had seemingly triumphed in 
his campaign to have Wills ejected from intercolonial cricket.[213] In 
an exchange of personal attacks in the press, Wills implied that Hammersley 
was an architect of the no-ball plot, and protested that he and other English 
colonists were out to oppress native-born Australians.[214] Hammersley 
closed:[213] You are played out now, the cricketing machine is rusty and 
useless, all respect for it is gone. You will never be captain of a Victorian 
Eleven again, ... Eschew colonial beer, and take the pledge, and in time 
your failings may be forgotten, and only your talents as a cricketer remembered. 
Farewell, Tommy Wills. W. G. Grace, the Victorian era's most famous cricketer, 
brought an English team to Australia in 1873–74. Wills was desperate to 
play for Victoria against Grace and rival cricketing factions fought over 
his possible inclusion. Hammersley, a selector, ensured his omission.[216] 
Wills toured with the team, playing for country sides.[217] Irked by Wills' 
constant presence, Grace remarked that he seemed to regard himself as a 
representative of the whole of Australia.[218] It was assumed that, on 
his homeward journey, Grace would play a final match in the South Australian 
capital of Adelaide, but he bypassed the city when Kadina, a remote mining 
town in the Copper Triangle, offered him more money. Wills coached the 
locals.[219] Played in an open, rock-strewn plain of baked earth, the game 
was deemed a farce. Wills made a pair and Grace later wrote derisively 
of the "old Rugbeian" as a has-been.[220] Grace neglected to mention that 
Wills bowled him, ending with 6/28.[221] In Geelong, Wills was still idolised, 
though he seemed discontented, seeking any chance to earn money through 
cricket in the major cities.[222] He maintained an interest in the development 
of football, what he called "the king of games".[223] He continued to suggest 
rule changes, such as the push in the back rule to curb injuries, and, 
as captain of Geelong, had shaped the sport's playing style.[224] Utilising 
the young squad's speed and skill, Wills devised an innovative game plan—what 
he called "scientific football"—based on passing and running into open 
space.[225] He pioneered another tactical manoeuvre in Ballarat by controversially 
ordering his players to flood the backline to prevent the home side from 
scoring. He and his men incited the crowd further by wasting time and deliberately 
kicking the ball out of bounds.[226] A few years later, in a rare act of 
diplomacy, Wills quelled tensions after a rival club used his "unchivalrous 
tactics" against Geelong.[227] He played his last football game in 1874.[228] 
In his 1874–75 Australian Cricketers' Guide, Wills argued that a new captain 
was needed to restore Victoria's glory. "No one reading his words could 
mistake its intent—what Victoria needed was Tom Wills", writes de Moore.[229] 
For the first time in years, selectors considered Wills for the next intercolonial 
against New South Wales. Noting his faded skills and past transgressions, 
the Melbourne press lamented, "there is some sentimental notion afloat 
that as a captain he is peerless."[230] Pessimism gave way to hope as Wills 
promised a win, and in February 1876 he led the Victoria XI onto the Albert 
Ground. He went for 0 and 4 and failed to pick up a wicket despite bowling 
the most overs of his side. The media blamed him for Victoria's 195-run 
loss.[231] In turn, he blamed his teammates.[232] By 1877, Wills' cricket 
career "had become a series of petty disputes in petty games" of "ever-deteriorating 
standards."[233] In a brief postscript to one of several rejected applications 
for employment at the MCC, Wills gave voice to professionals "left in the 
cold". It has been interpreted as "an unmistakable backhander for the club. 
To see Wills simply as a beggar would be to misunderstand him."[234] Following 
his retirement as a footballer, Wills turned to umpiring and committee 
work, and despite his continued slide into debt, donated money and trophies 
for football competitions.[235] He served as Geelong's vice-president from 
1873 to 1876, and was one of three delegates appointed by the club after 
the 1877 formation of the Victorian Football Association (VFA), but was 
dropped soon after for unknown reasons.[236] During the 1878 VFA season, 
he acted as central umpire, and defended his adjudication of a June match 
between Carlton and Albert Park in what would be his last public letter.[237] 
That year, Wills, broke and hounded by creditors, began selling land in 
Geelong to help clear his debt, and moved with Barbor to South Melbourne.[238] 
Wills held no positions of power at the South Melbourne Cricket Club and 
only occasionally appeared in local team lists.[239] He convinced the club 
to open its ground to football in winter.[240] Other clubs followed, and 
football adapted to an oval-shaped field.[241] By now, the sport had spread 
throughout Australasia, and Melbourne matches were attracting the world's 
largest football crowds yet seen.[242] In late 1878, the MCC rejected Wills' 
last overture to the club, and his dwindling income from cricket was "finally 
asphyxiated".[243] From February 1879 onwards, Wills lived with Barbor 
in Heidelberg, a small village on the outskirts of Melbourne. He rarely 
left it for the rest of his life.[244] His alcoholism worsened, as did 
Barbor's, also a heavy drinker.[245] He coached the local cricket team, 
and, on 13 March 1880, played for the side in his last recorded game. His 
"chucks" were still noted.[246] In his last surviving letters, sent two 
days later to his brothers on Cullin-la-ringo, he wrote that he was "out 
of the world" in Heidelberg, and fantasised about escaping to Tasmania. 
Begging for money to help pay off debts, he promised, "I will not trouble 
any of you again".[247] Isolated and disowned by most of his family, Wills 
had become, in the words of cricket historian David Frith, "a complete 
and dangerous and apparently incurable alcoholic".[248] Contrary to legend, 
Wills was never housed in a lunatic asylum.[249] He started to show signs 
of delirium tremens in late April, including paranoid delusions, and Barbor, 
fearing that a calamity was at hand, admitted him to the Melbourne Hospital 
on 1 May to be kept under restraint. Wills absconded soon after, returned 
home and the next day committed suicide by stabbing a pair of scissors 
into his heart three times.[250] The inquest, on 3 May, presided over by 
coroner Richard Youl, found that Wills "killed himself when of unsound 
mind from excessive drinking".[251] Wills was buried the next day in an 
unmarked grave in Heidelberg Cemetery at a private funeral attended by 
only six people: his brother Egbert, sister Emily and cousin Harrison; 
Harrison's sister Adela and her son Amos; and cricketer Verney Cameron.[252] 
His death certificate declared that his parents were unknown.[253] When 
asked by a journalist about her late son, Elizabeth Wills is reported to 
have denied that Tom ever existed.[f] Wills struck his contemporaries as 
peculiar and at times narcissistic, with a prickly temperament, but also 
kind, charismatic and companionable.[254] Often embroiled in controversy, 
he seemed to lack an understanding of how his words and actions could repeatedly 
get him into trouble.[255] His obsession with sport was such that he showed 
little interest in anything else.[46] Through his research, journalist 
Martin Flanagan concluded that Wills was "utterly bereft of insight into 
himself",[256] and football historian Gillian Hibbins described Wills as 
"an overbearing and undisciplined young man who tended to blame others 
for his troubles and was more interested in winning a game than in respecting 
sporting rules."[257] Wills' family and peers, though angered by his misbehaviour, 
frequently forgave him.[258] It is unlikely that he sought popular favour, 
but his strong egalitarian streak helped solidify his folk hero status.[259] 
This affection for him, coupled with an understanding of his waywardness, 
found expression in the public motto: "With all thy faults I love thee 
still, Tommy Wills".[260] As a young adult back in Australia, Wills developed 
a peculiar stream of consciousness style of writing that sometimes defied 
syntax and grammar.[261] His letters are laced with puns, oblique classical 
and Shakespearean allusions, and droll asides, such as this one about Melbourne 
in a letter to his brother Cedric: "Everything is dull here, but people 
are kept alive by people getting shot at in the streets".[262] The overall 
effect is one of "a mind full of energy and histrionic ideas without a 
centre".[263] He could be dismissive, triumphant and brazen all within 
a single sentence. Whatever his inner world was, he rarely let it be known. 
Lines of argument or considered opinion were not developed. His stream 
of thought was in rapid flux and a string of defiant jabs. To give emphasis 
he underlined his words with a flourish. His punctuation was idiosyncratic. 
Language was breathless and explosive and he revelled in presenting himself 
and his motives as mysterious. Unlike his provocative written language, 
Wills spoke in a breezy and laconic manner.[264] In one of his borderline 
"thought disordered" letters, it is evident that at times he entered a 
state of depersonalisation: "I do not know what I am standing on ... when 
anyone speaks to me I cannot for the life of me make out what they are 
talking about—everything seems so curious."[265] In 1884, Hammersley compared 
Wills' incipient madness and fiery glare to that of Adam Lindsay Gordon,[g] 
the Australian bush poet.[266] Wills' mental instability is a source for 
speculation: epilepsy has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed 
mental state, and a variant of bipolar illness may account for his disjointed 
thinking and flowery, confused writings.[267] In 1923, the MCC discovered 
Tom's old cricket cap and put it on display in the Block Arcade, prompting 
Horace Wills to reflect: "My brother was the nicest man I ever met. Though 
his nature was care-free, amounting almost to wildness, he had the sweetest 
temper I have seen in a man, and was essentially a sportsman."[268] 'Great' 
athletes seem to be anointed every day; far rarer are those entitled to 
be considered 'original'. Tom Wills is such a figure in every respect. 
Wills was recognised as the best all-round cricketer of his era in Australia 
and compared favourably to Test cricket's early greats.[271] "The picture 
of the athlete" in his prime, "full to overflowing with animal vigor", 
Wills seemed indestructible.[272] Match reports refer to him as a Greek 
god, a Colossus, "and many other things besides a cricketer".[273] Intensely 
competitive, his win-at-all-costs mentality, his intimidation of opponents, 
and his breaking of rules undermined the amateur ideal of friendly competition.[274] 
A natural leader, he emboldened his men with his supreme confidence. Even 
in the face of probable defeat, he never despaired the fortunes of his 
side.[275] On the off-chance that he sought another player's opinion, he 
invariably followed his own mind,[276] and his resources at any critical 
juncture in a match were said to be always clever, and sometimes unique.[277] 
"As a judge of the game he never had a superior", wrote Britain's The Sportsman. 
The rarity of Wills' genius was compared to William Shakespeare's.[278] 
Wills saw himself principally as a bowler. He varied his pace and style 
considerably, going through a repertoire that included "sparklers, rippers, 
fizzers, trimmers and shooters", and was quick to work out a batsman's 
weak points.[67] Noted for his deceptive slow deliveries, dropping mid-flight 
and big on break, Wills' fast round arm balls sometimes reared head-high 
from the pitch, terrorising his opponent. English batsman Sir David Serjeant 
said that Wills was the only bowler he ever feared.[279] He was known to 
carefully study an umpire before deciding whether to throw.[280] A trickster, 
he would ask the umpire to watch his feet lest he go over the crease, and 
then "let go a throw for all he was worth".[281] His most flagrant throws 
were likened to that of a baseball pitcher.[282] As a batsman, Wills was 
"peculiarly ugly" with a dogged defence and a capacity for explosive hitting. 
His characteristic shots—cuts and to the leg side—ensured the primacy of 
defence.[283] He explained his stonewalling thus: "The ball can't get through 
the bat."[284] An outstanding fieldsman anywhere, Wills excelled in the 
slips and ran out batsmen with deadly accurate throwing.[285] Wills was 
a "tear away" Australian rules footballer whose "pluck and skill", it was 
said, only George O'Mullane matched.[286] The longest drop kick in Victoria, 
he was an elusive dodger, as at Rugby, and excelled in different positions, 
moving from a follower and goal-scorer in the ruck to full back.[287] Of 
the early footballers, Wills was appraised as the greatest, most astute 
captain, and is credited with opening up the game to new tactics and skills 
and a more free-flowing style of play.[288] In July 1860—in what the press 
called a "coup de main", and what has since been recognised as a "tactical 
leap" that foreshadowed modern football—Wills breached the era's notional 
offside line by positioning his Richmond men down the field from defence 
to attack. By a series of short kick passes towards goal, they succeeded 
in scoring.[289] That same month, captaining Melbourne to victory, he pioneered 
a rudimentary form of flooding; and in another win for the club, exploited 
the low player turnout by instructing his men to dart with the ball in 
open spaces.[290] Historian Bernard Whimpress called Wills an innovator 
who "would fit easily into today's game".[291] Historian Geoffrey Blainey 
writes: "How many of the tricks and stratagems of the early years came 
from this clever tactician we will never know."[292] Australia's first 
celebrity sportsman, Wills began to fade from public consciousness within 
his own lifetime.[46] His dark reputation and suicide, and his links to 
convictism and frontier violence—sources of cultural cringe—have been posited 
as reasons for his descent into obscurity.[269] Academic Barry Judd called 
him "a ghost inhabiting the margins of written history".[295] Coinciding 
with a revival of interest in Australia's colonial past, Wills has risen 
"almost to a vogue", and is seen as a forerunner of today's self-destructive 
star athletes, some of those qualities that alienated his peers "being 
less shocking to a generation that likes its heroes flawed".[269] The subject 
of works in the arts, his story has been likened to bushranger Ned Kelly's 
as an epic and quintessentially Australian narrative.[296] After several 
attempts by different authors since the 1930s, a definitive biography was 
published in 2008, Greg de Moore's Tom Wills: First Wild Man of Australian 
Sport.[297] Wills' unmarked gravesite was restored in 1980 with a headstone 
erected by the MCC and by public subscription.[294] He was inducted into 
the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1989[298] and was made an inaugural 
member of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996. The Tom Wills Room 
in the MCG's Great Southern Stand serves as a venue for corporate functions.[299] 
A statue outside the MCG, sculpted by Louis Laumen and erected in 2001, 
depicts Wills umpiring the famous 1858 football match between Melbourne 
Grammar and Scotch College.[300] The AFL commemorated the 150th anniversary 
of the match by staging the Tom Wills Round during the 2008 AFL Season. 
The two schools played in a curtain raiser at the MCG ahead of the round 
opener between Melbourne and Geelong.[301] That same year, Victoria's busiest 
freeway interchange, the Monash–EastLink interchange in Dandenong North, 
was named the Tom Wills Interchange.[302] Tom Wills Oval, inaugurated in 
2013 at Sydney Olympic Park, serves as the training base for the Greater 
Western Sydney Giants of the AFL.[303] Since the 1980s, it has been suggested 
that Wills played or observed an Aboriginal football game, Marngrook,[h] 
as a child growing up in the Grampians among the Djab wurrung, and incorporated 
features of this game into early Australian football.[305] The theory has 
provoked intense debate, amounting to a controversy dubbed "football's 
history wars".[306] In her essay "A Seductive Myth", published in the AFL's 
The Australian Game of Football Since 1858 (2008), Hibbins calls the proposed 
link an "emotional belief" lacking "any intellectual credibility".[307] 
She points out that neither Wills nor any of his fellow football founders 
mention Aboriginal games in existing documents, and states that there is 
no evidence of Marngrook being played in the vicinity where Wills grew 
up.[307] Since then, among the personal papers of ethnographer Alfred William 
Howitt, an interview has been found with a Mukjarrawaint man who recalls 
playing Marngrook in the Grampians.[306] Also, in his first-hand account 
of Aboriginal games, James Dawson, an Aboriginal rights activist, records 
the Djab wurrung word for football as "Min'gorm".[308] De Moore therefore 
argues that Marngrook was likely played around where Wills lived as a boy, 
"or, at the very least, that the local Aboriginal people knew of such a 
game". That Wills knew of Marngrook, he adds, is speculative at best.[309] 
Proponents of a link point to the games' similarities, such as drop punting 
the ball and leaping, catching feats.[306] Academics Jenny Hocking and 
Nell Reidy write that Wills, in adapting football to Melbourne's parklands, 
wanted a game that kept the players off the ground and the ball in the 
air. "It is here", they argue, "in the interstices between rugby and Australian 
football, that the influence of [Marngrook] can be seen most clearly".[306] 
Skeptics counter that until the 1870s, Australian football was aligned 
with rugby-style roots, and bore little resemblance to Marngrook.[310] 
According to de Moore, Wills was "almost solely influenced" by Rugby School 
football, with local conditions also having an effect.[309] Flanagan promoted 
the Marngrook theory in his novel The Call (1996), an historical imagining 
into Wills' life,[296] and argued in an essay addressed to Wills that he 
must have known Aboriginal games as it was in his nature to play: "There's 
two things about you everybody seems to have agreed on—you'd drink with 
anyone and you'd play with anyone."[311] He quotes Lawton Wills Cooke, 
a Wills family descendent, who said there was a story in the family's oral 
history about Tom playing Marngrook as a boy.[312] This claim was disputed 
by family historian T. S. Wills Cooke.[313] Despite its contentious nature, 
the theory has entered football folklore, and in Moyston, the self-proclaimed 
"Birthplace of Australian Football",[314] stands an AFL-endorsed monument, 
unveiled by historian Col Hutchinson, commemorating Wills' childhood in 
the area playing Marngrook.[315] The role of Wills and others in pioneering 
Australian football went largely unrecognised in their lifetimes as the 
sport had yet to develop a historical perspective.[316] By 1908, the year 
of football's jubilee celebrations, Wills' surviving cousin Harrison was 
proclaimed "the father of football" on account of his substantial reputation 
on and off the field.[317] Wills was the next most often recalled pioneer 
during this period,[318] and it was Harrison who said that his cousin initiated 
the sport when he "recommended that we Australians should work out a game 
of our own."[319] It has been said that, due to his suicide, Wills was 
written out of the game's history, or at the very least downplayed as a 
significant figure.[316] One sportswriter opined in the 1980s that Wills 
had "received very little credit due to him in originating the game ... 
somehow he is forgotten today."[320] More recent histiography has elevated 
Wills to a position of pre-eminence.[316] Hibbins questions the significance 
of Wills' off-field contributions, such as his 1858 letter.[321] Echoing 
Hibbins' arguments, Roy Hay writes that Wills, while the sport's "catalyst", 
was "much more interested in playing and performing than in organising."[322] 
British historian Tony Collins even compared Wills to William Webb Ellis 
and Abner Doubleday, the apocryphal inventors of rugby and baseball respectively.[323] 
In response to Collins' suggestion that Wills "quickly faded from the footballing 
scene", ABC journalist James Coventry drew attention to his seventeen-year 
playing career (by far the longest of the pioneers), the influence he wielded 
as captain-coach of various clubs for much of that time, and his administrative 
work. He concludes that Collins and other scholars have "perversely" devalued 
Wills' real contributions "in their rush to discredit [the Marngrook theory]".[324] 
Blainey said of Wills: "It is far too much to say that he founded the game, 
but it would be too little to say that he was simply one among many founders."[325] 
a. ^ Tom Wills' birthplace is a matter of some conjecture as there is a 
dearth of reliable archival information on the subject, and the precise 
whereabouts of his parents are difficult to pinpoint during the period 
around 1835.[326] Molonglo is given as his birthplace in an 1869 biographical 
piece in which William Hammersley, the author, states that Wills had furnished 
him with notes.[327] A common alternative is Parramatta.[326] When Victorians 
claimed Wills as one of theirs, he liked to boast that he was a "Sydney 
man"—a reference to the colony of his birth.[328] b. ^ Tom had eight siblings: 
Emily Spencer Wills (1842–1925), Cedric Spencer Wills (1844–1914), Horace 
Spencer Wills (1847–1928), Egbert Spencer Wills (1849–1931), Elizabeth 
Spencer Wills (1852–1930), Eugenie Spencer Wills (1854–1937), Minna Spencer 
Wills (1856–1943) and Hortense Sarah Spencer Wills (1861–1907).[329] c. 
^ Tom Wills and H. C. A. Harrison shared Sarah Howe as a grandmother.[330] 
Harrison was born ten months after Wills in New South Wales and as a young 
boy overlanded to the Port Phillip District, where he often visited the 
Wills family at Lexington.[331] They became brothers-in-law in 1864 when 
Harrison married Emily Wills.[332] d. ^ George Augustus Robinson, the Chief 
Protector of Aborigines in the Port Philip District, listed Horatio as 
having murdered several Aboriginal men and women. The closest Horatio came 
to admitting that he had killed Aborigines was in a letter to Governor 
Charles La Trobe: "... we shall be compelled in self defence to measures 
that may involve us in unpleasant consequences".[333] e. ^ The Aborigines 
went by sobriquets given to them by their white employers in the Western 
District.[334] Named after the station where he worked, Mullagh's real 
name was Unaarrimin.[335] f. ^ This story was related in the following 
piece of Wills family oral history: "Elizabeth Wills refused to attend 
[the funeral] nor would she acknowledge Tom after his death as she was 
very religious and considered [suicide] a great sin. ... A reporter asked 
Elizabeth about her son. 'Which son?' she asked. 'Thomas' said the reporter. 
'I have no son called Thomas' was the old lady's reply".[336] g. ^ Gordon 
suffered a demise similar to that of Wills, committing suicide in 1870.[266] 
He describes Wills as a daring sportsman in his 1865 long poem "Ye Wearie 
Wayfarer".[337] h. ^ Each Indigenous language group played its own variant 
of football and with its own name.[306] "Marngrook", from the Gunditjmara 
language, is used as a generic term for Aboriginal football.[338] Books
