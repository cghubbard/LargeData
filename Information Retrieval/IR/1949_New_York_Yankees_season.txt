The 1949 New York Yankees season was the team's 47th season in New York, 
and its 49th season overall. The team finished with a record of 97–57, 
winning their 16th pennant, finishing 1 game ahead of the Boston Red Sox. 
New York was managed by Casey Stengel. The Yankees played their home games 
at Yankee Stadium. In the World Series, they defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers 
in 5 games. The 1949 Yankees team was seen as "underdogs" who came from 
behind to catch and surprise the powerful Red Sox on the last two days 
of the season, a face off that fueled the beginning of the modern Yankees 
– Red Sox rivalry. The Red Sox needed just one win in two games and were 
to pitch Mel Parnell in the first game. After trailing 4–0, the Yankees 
came back to beat Parnell 5–4, as Johnny Lindell hit an eighth-inning, 
game-winning, home run and Joe Page had a great relief appearance for New 
York.[3][4] And so it came down to the last game of the season. It was 
Ellis Kinder facing Vic Raschi. The Yankees led 1–0 after seven innings, 
having scored in the first. In the eighth inning, manager Joe McCarthy 
lifted Kinder for a pinch hitter who did not come through. Then he brought 
in Mel Parnell in relief, and Parnell yielded a homer to Tommy Henrich 
and a single to Yogi Berra. Parnell was replaced by Tex Hughson, who had 
been on the disabled list and said his arm still hurt. But he came on and, 
with the bases loaded, Jerry Coleman hit a soft liner that Al Zarilla in 
right field tried to make a shoestring catch, but he missed and it went 
for a triple and three runs. In the ninth inning the Red Sox rallied for 
three runs but still fell short.[5] The post-season proved to be a bit 
easier, as the Yankees defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers four games to one. 
In 1949, Boston Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey and Yankees GM Larry MacPhail 
verbally agreed to trade DiMaggio for Ted Williams, but MacPhail refused 
to include Yogi Berra.[6] Phil Rizzuto moved from eighth to first in the 
batting lineup and finished the season second in voting for the American 
League MVP Award. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters
