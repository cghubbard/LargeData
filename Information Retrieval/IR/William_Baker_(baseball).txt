William Frazer Baker (1866 – December 4, 1930) was the owner of the Philadelphia 
Phillies of the National League from 1913 through 1930. Baker was appointed 
New York City Police Commissioner in July 1909 by Mayor George B. McClellan, 
Jr. [1] During his brief tenure he was accused of interfering in gambling 
investigations.[2] He resigned his position in October 1910.[3] In January 
1913, Baker was part of a group led by his nephew, William Locke, that 
purchased the club.[4] Baker was elected team president in October 1913, 
following the death of Locke earlier in the year.[5] He was at the helm 
two years later when the Phillies played in the 1915 World Series. Baker 
was known for being extremely tight-fisted. For most of his tenure as owner, 
the Phillies had only one scout, and used a flock of sheep to trim the 
grass at Baker Bowl, which was named for him. He was so tight-fisted that 
he sold star pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander to the Chicago Cubs in 
1917 rather than increase his salary. Within a year, the Phillies had fallen 
to last place—the first of 15 straight years (and 29 out of 30) without 
a winning record. He died of a heart attack on December 4, 1930 while attending 
a league meeting in Montreal[6] and was succeeded as Phillies owner by
