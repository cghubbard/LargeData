Few in The 1998 Atlanta Braves season marked the franchise's 33rd season 
in Atlanta. They went on to win their seventh consecutive division title, 
taking the National League East title by 18 games over the second place 
New York Mets. The team featured six all stars: shortstop Walt Weiss and 
third baseman Chipper Jones were voted as starters, while first baseman 
Andr√©s Galarraga, catcher Javy Lopez, and pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg 
Maddux were selected as reserves. Jones and Lopez each hit over 30 home 
runs as Galaragga (acquired from Colorado) led the club in home runs and 
RBI. Galaragga finished as an MVP candidate. The 1998 Braves beat the Chicago 
Cubsand Sammy Sosa three games to none in the National League Division 
Series. In the next round Atlanta then lost to the San Diego Padres in 
the National League Championship Series four games to two. Despite winning 
two games after losing the first three, Atlanta's comeback bid came short 
by being eliminated in game 6. San Diego's winning over Atlanta was seen 
as one of the biggest upsets in postseason history. This team has earned 
a few historic accolades. ESPN writer David Schoenfield lists them as one 
of the top teams in MLB history to not win a World Series[1] ESPN columnist 
Jeff Merron also writes that the pitching staff of Maddux, Glavine, John 
Smoltz, Denny Neagle, and Kevin Millwood was the greatest of all time. 
Especially to not win a championship.[2] The quintet posted a cumulative 
2.97 E.R.A. and amassed 88 wins (almost 18 wins per starter), equaling 
the win total of the 2nd place Mets. Glavine, the lone 20 game winner in 
the National League for that year, won the Cy Young Award. [1] [2] [3]
