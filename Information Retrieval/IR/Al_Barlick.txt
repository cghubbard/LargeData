Albert Joseph "Al" Barlick (April 2, 1915 – December 27, 1995) was an American 
umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the National League for 28 
seasons (1940–43, 1946–55, 1958–71). Barlick missed two seasons (1944-45) 
due to service in the United States Coast Guard and two seasons (1956-57) 
due to heart problems. He umpired seven World Series and seven All-Star 
Games. Barlick was known for a strong voice and for booming strike calls. 
After he left active umpiring in 1971, Barlick became an umpire scout and 
supervisor. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989. Barlick 
was born in Springfield, Illinois. His father, an Austrian immigrant, worked 
for 50 years at a Peabody coal mine.[1] Barlick dropped out of high school 
after two years to support his family. He joined the Civilian Conservation 
Corps, and spent six months in Washington and six months in Wisconsin. 
When Barlick's brother died, he returned to the coal mine to assist his 
father. Barlick said that he did not play much baseball as a youngster, 
but that he often watched the game. During a coal mine strike, a 19-year-old 
Barlick was offered a dollar to umpire his first game.[2] He played outfield 
in semipro baseball, but he was described as "mediocre."[3] In August 1936, 
the Class-D Northeast Arkansas League was in need of a replacement umpire, 
and hired Barlick for the last 4 weeks of the season.[1] In 1937, Barlick 
was hired by the Class-B Piedmont League, moved to the Eastern League in 
1939, and was promoted to the International League later that season. Late 
in the 1940 season, NL umpire Bill Klem was unable to work due to an ankle 
injury, so Barlick was hired as a replacement.[3] He made his debut in 
a doubleheader at Shibe Park on September 8. Barlick was offered a contract 
for the 1941 season, and was 26 years old at the start of the season, making 
him one of the youngest MLB umpires in history. Before the 1941 season, 
Klem had strongly endorsed Barlick, saying, "He's going to be the greatest 
umpire in baseball history. He has a love of his work, a pride in it and 
the physical qualifications. Young? Certainly. But there's something wrong 
with an umpire who serves a long time in the minors."[3] Barlick made his 
first ejection on July 27 of that year, when Brooklyn Dodgers catcher Herman 
Franks objected to Barlick's strike zone.[1] Barlick was selected as an 
umpire for the 1942 All-Star Game at the Polo Grounds. Barlick joined the 
Coast Guard in November 1943, during World War II. He spent most of the 
next two years assigned to an 83-foot cutter based at the Coast Guard Academy 
in New London, Connecticut. He was discharged in 1945, having earned the 
rank of Seaman, First Class.[1] Barlick returned to umpiring in 1946, when 
he umpired his first World Series.[1] Klem repeated his endorsement of 
Barlick that year. "There's a fellow who's going to be one of the great 
all-time umpires. He's got everything and knows how to handle himself. 
Before I saw him, I predicted he'd be a great umpire just from what I heard 
about him."[4] In 1947, Barlick was the first base umpire during Jackie 
Robinson's MLB debut. In 1949, Barlick was again chosen as an umpire for 
the 1949 All-Star Game. He began the game at home plate, although when 
it became time for the umpires to rotate, as was customary during All-Star 
games, Barlick left the game, leaving the right field line uncovered; no 
reason was given for his departure.[1] In August 1949, Barlick ruled a 
forfeit at Shibe Park in a game between the Philadelphia Phillies and New 
York Giants. Fans had become irate over a call made by Barlick's crew member 
George Barr and they littered the field with fruit, soda bottles and paper. 
The ruling constituted the first major league forfeit since 1942.[5] Before 
the 1956 season, Barlick was hospitalized in Illinois for treatment of 
a heart problem. League president Warren Giles characterized the issue 
as a minor heart ailment, but newspaper reports held that Barlick would 
not be ready for opening day that year.[6] After he sat out the entire 
1956 season, a March 1957 article reported that the heart issue would probably 
cause him to miss that season as well.[7] He returned to the field for 
the 1958 season.[8] In 1961, the Sporting News polled managers and coaches 
to determine the best umpires in the major leagues. Barlick was voted as 
the most respected umpire in the National League, as well as the best caller 
of balls and strikes, best on the bases, best knowledge of rules, best 
at being in the right position and most serious-minded.[1] Barlick stated 
that the poll was a disgrace due to the lack of qualifications of the writers 
and the nature of the categories, which included "most sarcastic", "hardest 
to talk to", "biggest grandstander", and "worst pop-off".[9] In 1963, the 
league instructed umpires to crack down on balks by pitchers. A few weeks 
after ejecting pitcher Bob Shaw due to an argument about balks, Barlick 
called Fred Fleig, the secretary of the National League, and said, “I'm 
fed up with the whole thing and I am going to quit and go home.”[10] On 
June 17, 1963, Giles announced that there had been a "misunderstanding" 
and that Barlick would relax at his home for a few days before rejoining 
his umpire crew.[10] After the 1963 season, Barlick took a job as a public 
relations representative at Springfield's Water, Light and Power Department. 
However, he returned as an umpire for the 1964 season. Barlick's crew worked 
the first game at the Houston Astrodome in 1965.[1] In 1966, Barlick missed 
nine games after his mother, Louise, died in Springfield. He missed the 
last two weeks of the 1966 season due to high blood pressure. After the 
1968 season, Barlick accompanied the St. Louis Cardinals on a five-week 
tour of Japan. In 1969, Barlick was the crew chief for the first-ever National 
League Championship Series.[1] In 1970, he umpired the final game at Forbes 
Field, as well as the first game at Riverfront Stadium. In 1971, Barlick 
was awarded the Umpire of the Year Award at the Al Somers Umpire School, 
which was based on a poll of other MLB umpires. He stated that the award 
was "very special," and that it was "a true, honorable, sincere award because 
it is given to an umpire by umpires." The 1971 season was Barlick's final 
year of umpiring, and he skipped the final series of the season at the 
advice of his fellow umpires.[1] Barlick retired with seven All-Star Game 
appearances (1942, 1949, 1952, 1955, 1959, 1966, 1970), as well as seven 
World Series (1946, 1950, 1951, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1967).[11] Barlick had 
been known for his very loud calls behind home plate.[12] Subsequent MLB 
officials, including Dusty Boggess and Dutch Rennert, said that they tried 
to imitate him when they became umpires.[13][14] After retiring from umpiring, 
Barlick was hired by the league to supervise and scout umpires, a job he 
held for 22 years. Barlick scouted many umpires who wound up having long 
careers, and was, according to Bruce Froemming, “very proud of the staff 
he built.”[1] Sportswriter Jerome Holtzman wrote that Barlick was outspoken 
when defending the league's umpires to NL president Warren Giles and baseball 
commissioner Ford Frick.[15] When the umpires went on strike at the conclusion 
of the 1984 regular season, Barlick and fellow supervisor Ed Vargo were 
located in the dugouts during the playoffs to assist the replacement umpires 
with questions over rules.[16] In 1989, he was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. Manager Leo Durocher and umpire 
Bill McGowan were also considered by the committee that year, but the group 
could only vote in one non-player per year.[15] Barlick had been under 
consideration by the committee for several years before his election.[17] 
In his induction speech, Barlick said, "My dreams are fulfilled far beyond 
my expectations."[18] Barlick wore uniform number 1 when the NL adopted 
them for its umpires in 1970; however, the league retired number 3 in Barlick's 
honor after his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989. On December 
27, 1995, Barlick collapsed at his home. He was taken to Memorial Medical 
Center in Springfield, where he died. A wife, Jennie, and two children
