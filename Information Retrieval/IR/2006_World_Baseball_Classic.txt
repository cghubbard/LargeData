The 2006 World Baseball Classic was the inaugural tournament between national 
baseball teams that included players from Major League Baseball. It was 
held from March 3 to 20 in stadiums that are in and around Tokyo, Japan; 
San Juan, Puerto Rico; Lake Buena Vista, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Scottsdale, 
Arizona; Anaheim, California; and San Diego, California. The first two 
rounds had a round-robin format, which led to two teams being eliminated 
on run difference tiebreakers: in the first round, Canada was eliminated 
despite its 2–1 record, due to a blowout loss to Mexico as well as failing 
to run up the score on South Africa; and in the second round, eventual 
champion Japan advanced despite its 1–2 record, due to a blowout win over 
Mexico and losing more narrowly to South Korea than did the United States. 
The higher-seeded teams generally advanced to the second round, including 
Puerto Rico and Venezuela, as well as the teams mentioned elsewhere in 
this summary. Although South Korea defeated Japan twice in the earlier 
rounds, they were matched against each other again in the semifinals as 
the two teams emerging from the same second round pool, and Japan won that 
game to advance to the final against Cuba (which had defeated the Dominican 
Republic in the other semifinal). Japan defeated Cuba 10–6 to be crowned 
the first champion of the World Baseball Classic. Daisuke Matsuzaka, a 
NPB veteran who was little-known outside Japan at the time, was crowned 
the Most Valuable Player of the tournament. The following year he made 
his debut with the Boston Red Sox. The first World Baseball Classic featured 
16 teams in a round-robin. Each team played the other three teams in their 
pool once. Teams were ranked by winning percentage in the first round, 
with the top two teams in each pool advancing to the second round, where 
the teams from Pools A and B (in Pool 1) and the teams from Pools C and 
D (in Pool 2) competed against each other in another round-robin. Teams 
were ranked by winning percentage in the second round, without regard to 
the results of the first round, with the top two teams from each pool entered 
a four-team single-elimination bracket, with the pool winners and runners-up 
from each pool facing each other in the semifinals. The winners of the 
semifinals then met to determine the World Baseball Classic Champions. 
In the final, the team with the higher winning percentage of games in the 
tournament were to be the home team. If the teams competing in the final 
had identical winning percentages in the tournament, then World Baseball 
Classic, Inc. (WBCI) would conduct a coin flip or draw to determine the 
home team. In the first two rounds, ties were to be broken in the following 
order of priority: In the final standings, ties were to be broken in the 
following order of priority: These standings and tiebreaking procedures 
are based on International Baseball Federation (IBAF) rules. Each participating 
national federation initially submitted a 45-man provisional roster. Final 
rosters of 28 players, which also must include a minimum of 13 pitchers 
and two catchers, were later submitted. If a player on the submitted roster 
was unable to play, usually due to injury, he could be substituted at any 
time before the start of the tournament. Seven stadiums were used during 
the tournament: The teams selected for the inaugural World Baseball Classic 
were chosen because they were judged to be the "best baseball-playing nations 
in the world and provide global representation for the event."[1] There 
was no official qualifying competition. NOTE: Tiebreaker notes: HTH − Head-to-head.

0.8 innings pitched per game ** Martí is tied with 10 others with a 0.00 
ERA but he pitched the most innings with 12.2 There were several rule changes 
from normal major league play. Pitchers were held to a pitch count of 65 
pitches in the first round, 80 pitches in the second round, and 95 in the 
championship round. (Netherlands pitcher Shairon Martis used exactly 65 
pitches to throw the only no-hitter of the tournament, a 10–0 win over 
Panama that was stopped by the mercy rule [see below].) If a pitcher reached 
his maximum pitch count in the middle of an at-bat, he could continue to 
pitch to that batter, but was required to be replaced once that at-bat 
ended. A 30–pitch outing needed to be followed by one day off, and a 50–pitch 
outing by four days off. No one would be allowed to pitch on three consecutive 
days. A mercy rule came into effect when one team led by either fifteen 
runs after five innings, or ten runs after seven innings in the first two 
rounds. In addition, ties could be called after fourteen innings of play. 
The designated hitter rule was in place for all games. South Korea completed 
the first two rounds undefeated (6-0) but was still forced to play Japan, 
a team it had already beaten twice, in the semifinal round. South Korea 
lost the match and subsequently was placed 3rd, despite the fact that South 
Korea's final standings were 6-1, with the most wins. Other international 
sporting competitions, such as the FIFA World Cup, are formatted so as 
to make it impossible that teams play each other three times. They can 
only face twice at most – in round robin group play and then again for 
the championship or 3rd-place match. In addition, the regional grouping 
of teams was called into question, for the groups were perceived to be 
unevenly distributed, and the four-team pool system and subsequent three-way 
tiebreakers were widely seen as awkward. Tournament organizers were unable 
to reach an agreement with the MLB umpires' union and so the Classic was 
overseen by umpires from the minor leagues. American umpire Bob Davidson 
made controversial calls at critical moments in two different games that 
benefited the American team. The Chinese Taipei team was originally listed 
as "Taiwan" and bearing the ROC national flag, but following pressure from 
the People's Republic of China the listing was later changed to Chinese 
Taipei with the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag. The World Anti-Doping Agency 
criticized IBAF's drug testing program and threatened to withdraw sanction 
of the event.[2] South Korean pitcher Myung-hwan Park tested positive for 
a banned substance during the event, and he was subsequently kicked out 
of the WBC.[2]. Venezuelan pitcher Freddy García tested positive for marijuana. 
In an effort to enforce the United States government's embargo on Cuba, 
the Cuban team was initially denied a license to play in the United States.[3] 
Puerto Rico threatened to pull out as hosts,[4] IBAF said they would rescind 
its sanctioning of the tournament,[5] and the IOC suggested that such a 
development would influence the ability of American cities to successfully 
bid to host future Olympic Games.[6] As a result, financing was restructured 
and the U.S. government withdrew its opposition.[7] A number of Major League 
Baseball players chose not to participate, some backing out at the last 
minute. Without players such as Barry Bonds, Vladimir Guerrero (who pulled 
out because three cousins died in a car accident right before World Baseball 
Classic), Manny Ramírez, Hideki Matsui, and José Vidro, some[who?] questioned 
whether the event would be credible.[citation needed] Cuba barred players 
such as Orlando Hernández, his half-brother Liván Hernández, and José Contreras, 
from its team as Cubans who had previously defected.[citation needed] Additionally, 
Italy utilized a roster of players made up almost entirely of second-generation 
Italian Americans such as Mike Piazza. Many members of the United States 
press were skeptical of the Classic since its inception. The event proved 
to be quite popular, however, providing many memorable moments including 
a first round game between Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. Attendance 
was higher than expected at several sites, including the 18,000-seat Hiram 
Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, which was sold out for every Puerto Rico game 
in the first two rounds. Though international ratings figures are not yet 
available, viewership is expected to be high, ESPN spokeswoman Diane Lamb 
said. In addition, there were 4,000 media credentials issued — more than 
the World Series — which bodes well for the stated goal of internationalizing 
the sport. Sports Illustrated writer Tom Verducci reported that "more merchandise 
was sold in the first round than organizers projected for the entire 17-day 
event." [3] He also reported that, at one point, jerseys for the Venezuelan 
team were selling at the rate of one every six seconds. The U.S. television 
ratings on ESPN were stronger than initially expected, drawing in more 
than one million television sets for some games, more than almost any other 
ESPN program in the month of March. This occurred despite less than stellar 
airing times for the games. Most were not aired live but taped, and sometimes 
with innings cut, as the WBC was organized well after ESPN had committed 
to much of its programming. Outside the U.S. the tournament was very successful. 
In Latin America, a first-round game between the United States and Mexico, 
was the third-most-watched game in the history of ESPN Dos, one of the 
three Spanish-language channels of ESPN in Latin America. The total earnings 
of the World Baseball Classic is divided into net profit (53%) and prize
