The Miami metropolitan area is the metropolitan area including Miami and 
nearby communities.[1][2][3][4] The U.S. Office of Management and Budget 
designates the area as the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL Metropolitan 
Statistical Area, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) used for statistical 
purposes by the United States Census Bureau and other entities.[5] The 
OMB defines the MSA as comprising Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties—Florida's 
three most populous counties—with principal cities including Miami, Fort 
Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, West Palm Beach, and Boca Raton. It is part 
of the wider South Florida region. With 6,012,331 inhabitants as of 2015, 
the Miami metropolitan area is the most populous in Florida and second 
largest in the Southeastern United States behind Greater Washington[6] 
and the eighth-most populous in the United States. Besides its association 
with the South Florida region, is also partially synonymous with an area 
known collectively as the "Gold Coast". Because the population of South 
Florida is largely confined to a strip of land between the Atlantic Ocean 
and the Everglades, the Miami urbanized area (that is, the area of contiguous 
urban development) is about 110 miles (180 km) long (north to south), but 
never more than 20 miles (32 km) wide, and in some areas only 5 miles (8.0 km) 
wide (east to west). The MSA is longer than any other urbanized area in 
the United States except for the New York metropolitan area.[7] It was 
the eighth most densely populated urbanized area in the United States in 
the 2000 census.[8] As of the 2000 census, the urbanized area had a land 
area of 1,116 square miles (2,890 km2), with a population of 4,919,036, 
for a population density of 4,407.4 per square mile (1,701.7 per square 
kilometer). Miami and Hialeah (the second largest city in the metropolitan 
area) had population densities of more than 10,000 per square mile (more 
than 3,800 per square kilometer).[9][10] The Miami Urbanized Area was the 
fifth largest urbanized area in the United States in the 2000 census. The 
Miami metro area also includes several urban clusters (UCs) as of the 2000 
Census which are not part of the Miami Urbanized Area. These are the Belle 
Glade UC, population 24,218, area 20,717,433 square meters and population 
density of 3027.6 per square mile; Key Biscayne UC, population 10,513, 
area 4,924,214 square meters and population density of 5529.5 per square 
mile; Redland UC, population 3,936, area 10,586,212 square meters and population 
density of 963.0 per square mile; and West Jupiter UC, population 8,998, 
area 24,737,176 square meters and population density of 942.1 per square 
mile.[11] In 2006, the area had an estimated 5,463,857 persons, of which 
1,671,398 live in unincorporated areas.[12][13][14] Considering that the 
area has an urban population of 4,919,036, only 544,821 residents live 
outside of the urban area, meaning that at least 1,126,577 persons live 
in urban unincorporated areas, but the number is actually higher. The Miami 
metropolitan area consists of three distinct metropolitan divisions, subdividing 
the region into three divisions according to the region's three counties: 
Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and Palm Beach County. The following 
is a list of the twenty largest cities in the Miami metropolitan area as 
ranked by population.[15][16][17] The Miami area is a very diverse community 
with a large proportion of foreign-born residents, in large part due to 
its proximity to Latin America and the Caribbean. Another large factor 
are residents who were former snowbirds from the Northeast and, to a lesser 
extent, countries such as Canada. Politically speaking, the region is heavily 
Democratic. Broward County is the second most reliably Democratic county 
in the state,[19][20] behind only Gadsden County. Palm Beach County, like 
Broward, is largely Democratic as well, especially amongst its Jewish community,[21] 
while the rest of Florida tends to follow Southern politics and vote more 
Republican, with the exception of certain parts of Florida where Southern 
culture is not as influential. With a majority Hispanic population in Miami-Dade, 
Republican votes are mainly by older generations of Cuban Americans most 
of whom had fled to the United States to escape the Communist reign of 
Fidel Castro, but Miami-Dade County still remains very Democratic when 
compared with most of Florida's other counties.[22][23][24] As of the 2005 
American Community Survey,[25][26] 5,334,685 people lived in the metropolis. 
The Miami area has a very large Jewish community; 10.2% of the population 
was Jewish in the 2000 Census.[citation needed] There is also a sizable 
Muslim community numbering at 70,000. Population: As of the 2010 U.S. Census, 
there were 5,564,635 people. 2.8 million (52%) were females and 2.6 million 
(48%) were males. The median age was 38.6 years. 24% of the population 
were under 18 years and 15% were 65 years and older. There were 2,097,626 
households, and 1,378,108 families residing in the Miami metropolitan area. 
Ethnicity: The racial makeup of population of the Miami area [5,334,685] 
as of 2010:[27] As of the 2000 U.S. Census there were about 21,663 ethnic 
Chinese living in Broward, Dade, and Palm Beach counties. That year Davie 
had about 537 ethnic Chinese. A Chinese language arts class is held at 
the Pine Island Park Multipurpose Center in Davie, serving students ages 
6 to 16. There are two yearly sessions, each spanning 13 weeks. About 130 
students attended as of 2005, making it the largest Chinese education program 
in the Miami area.[28] National origin and language: Of the people living 
in the Miami metro area in 2005, 63% were born in the United States (including 
30% who were born in Florida) and 37% were foreign born. Among people at 
least five years old living in the region in 2005, 52% spoke English at 
home while 48% spoke some other language at home. Of those speaking a language 
other than English at home, 78% spoke Spanish and 22% spoke some other 
language (mainly Haitian Creole, but also French, German, Hebrew, Italian, 
Portuguese, Russian or Yiddish). Geographic mobility: In 2005, 83% of the 
people at least one year old living in the Miami metro area were living 
in the same residence one year earlier; 12% had moved during the past year 
from another residence in the same county, 2% from another county in the 
same state, 2% from another state, and 1% from abroad. Households and families: 
There were 2,338,450 households, The average household size was 2.6 people. 
Families made up 65% of the households in the Miami area. This figure includes 
both married-couple families (45%) and other families (20%). Nonfamily 
households made up 35% of all households in Miami. Most of the nonfamily 
households were people living alone, but some consisted of people living 
in households in which no one was related to the householder. In and around 
Miami-Dade County and Broward County, a unique dialect, commonly called 
the "Miami dialect", is widely spoken. The dialect developed among second- 
or third-generation Hispanics, including Cuban-Americans, whose first language 
was English (though some non-Hispanic white, black, and other races who 
were born and raised in Miami-Dade tend to adopt it as well.)[29] It is 
based on a fairly standard American accent but with some changes very similar 
to dialects in the Mid-Atlantic (especially the New York area dialect, 
Northern New Jersey English, and New York Latino English.) Unlike Virginia 
Piedmont, Coastal Southern American, and Northeast American dialects and 
Florida Cracker dialect (see section below), "Miami accent" is rhotic; 
it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish 
(wherein rhythm is syllable-timed).[30] However, this is a native dialect 
of English, not learner English or interlanguage; it is possible to differentiate 
this variety from an interlanguage spoken by second-language speakers in 
that "Miami accent" does not generally display the following features: 
there is no addition of /ɛ/ before initial consonant clusters with /s/, 
speakers do not confuse of /dʒ/ with /j/, (e.g., Yale with jail), and /r/ 
and /rr/ are pronounced as alveolar approximant [ɹ] instead of alveolar 
tap [ɾ] or alveolar trill [r] in Spanish.[31][32][33][34] Education: In 
2005, 83% of people 25 years and over had at least graduated from high 
school and 30% had a bachelor's degree or higher. Among people 16 to 19 
years old, 7% were dropouts; they were not enrolled in school and had not 
graduated from high school. The total school enrollment in Miami Metro 
Area was 1.4 million in 2005. Nursery school and kindergarten enrollment 
was 170,000 and elementary or high school enrollment was 879,000 children. 
College or graduate school enrollment was 354,000. Occupations and Type 
of Employer: Among the most common occupations were: 32% were management, 
professional, and related occupations, 30% were sales and office occupations, 
18% were service occupations, 11% were construction, extraction, maintenance 
and repair occupations, and 9% were production, transportation, and material 
moving occupations. 81% of the people employed were Private wage and salary 
workers; 12% were Federal, state, or local government workers; and 7% were 
Self-employed in own not incorporated business workers. Income: The median 
income of households in the Miami area was $43,091. 78% of the households 
received earnings and 13% received retirement income other than Social 
Security. 30% of the households received Social Security. The average income 
from Social Security was $13. These income sources are not mutually exclusive; 
that is, some households received income from more than one source. Industries: 
In 2005, for the employed population 16 years and older, the leading industries 
in the Miami area were Educational services, health care and social assistance, 
which accounted for 18%, and Professional, scientific, and management, 
and administrative and waste management services, which accounted for 13% 
of the population. Traveling to Work: 79% of Miami area workers drove to 
work alone in 2005, 10% carpooled, 4% took public transportation, and 4% 
used other means. The remaining 3% worked at home. Among those who commuted 
to work, it took them on average 28.5 minutes to get to work. Poverty and 
Participation in Government Programs: In 2005, 14% of people were in poverty. 
19% of related children under 18 were below the poverty level, compared 
with 14% of people 65 years old and over. 11% of all families, and 26% 
of families with a female householder and no husband present had incomes 
below the poverty level. Changes in house prices for the area are publicly 
tracked on a regular basis using the Case–Shiller index; the statistic 
is published by Standard & Poor's and is also a component of S&P's 10-city 
composite index of the value of the residential real estate market. Housing 
characteristics: As of 2005, the Miami area had a total of 2.3 million 
housing units, 13% of which were vacant. Of the total housing units, 52% 
were in single-unit structures, 45% were in multi-unit structures, and 
3% were mobile homes. 25% of the housing units were built since 1990. Occupied 
housing unit characteristics: In 2005, the Miami area had 2.0 million occupied 
housing units – 1.3 million (66%) owner occupied and 688,000 (34%) renter 
occupied. Housing costs: In 2010, housing costs in the Miami area typically 
represented 40% of household income, compared to 34% nationwide.[35] Property 
tax increase: In March 2009, Miami area lawmakers passed a 5–10% hike in 
property tax millage rates throughout the metropolitan area to fund the 
construction of new schools and to fund understaffed schools and educational 
institutions, resulting in an increase in residents' property tax bills 
beginning in the 2009 tax year. In Florida, each county is also a school 
district. Each district is headed by an elected school board. A professional 
superintendent manages the day-to-day operations of each district, who 
is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the School Board. The Miami-Dade 
County Public School District is currently the 4th-largest public school 
district in the nation. The School District of Palm Beach County is the 
4th-largest in Florida and the 11th-largest in the United States. Broward 
County Public School District is the 6th-largest in the United States. 
Some colleges and universities in Greater Miami include: In 2005, 82% of 
people 25 years and over had at least graduated from high school and 28% 
had a bachelor's degree or higher. Among people 16 to 19 years old, 7% 
were dropouts; they were not enrolled in school and had not graduated from 
high school. The total school enrollment in the Miami metro area was 1.4 
million in 2005. Nursery school and kindergarten enrollment was 170,000 
and elementary or high school enrollment was 879,000. College or graduate 
school enrollment was 354,000. The Miami metropolitan area is served by 
five interstate highways operated by the Florida Department of Transportation 
(FDOT) in conjunction with local agencies. Interstate 95 (I-95) runs north 
to south along the coast, ending just south of Downtown Miami at South 
Dixie Highway (US 1). I-75 runs east to west, turning south in western 
Broward County and connecting suburban north Miami-Dade to Naples on the 
Southwest Coast via Alligator Alley, which transverses the Florida Everglades 
before turning north. I-595 connects the Broward coast and downtown Fort 
Lauderdale to I-75 and Alligator Alley. In Miami, I-195 and I-395 relay 
the main I-95 route east to Biscayne Boulevard (US 1) and Miami Beach across 
Biscayne Bay via the Julia Tuttle and MacArthur causeways. In greater Miami, 
the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority and Florida's Turnpike Enterprise (FTE) 
maintain eight state expressways in conjunction with FDOT. The Airport 
Expressway (SR 112) and the Dolphin Expressway (SR 836) relay western Miami-Dade 
suburbs to the eastern urban coast at I-95, and to Miami Beach via I-195 
and I-395 at the Airport and Midtown interchanges. The Gratigny Parkway 
(SR 924) connects northern Miami suburbs to the southern end of I-75. The 
Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) is the primary beltway road of urban Miami, 
relaying I-95 and Florida's Turnpike (SR 91) at the Golden Glades Interchange 
near northeastern North Miami Beach to the southern inland suburbs of Kendall 
and Pinecrest. The Don Shula Expressway (SR 874) and the Homestead Extension 
of Florida's Turnpike (SR 821) form the southernmost end of the beltway, 
connecting the Palmetto Expressway to the bedroom communities of Homestead 
and Florida City. The Snapper Creek Expressway (SR 878) relays the Don 
Shula Expressway to South Dixie Highway (US 1). The urban bypass expressway 
in greater Fort Lauderdale is the Sawgrass Expressway (SR 869), connecting 
the northern Broward County coast at I-95 and Deerfield Beach to I-595 
and I-75 at Alligator Alley in Sunrise. The metropolitan area is served 
by three major commercial airports. These airports combine to make the 
fourth largest domestic origin and destination market in the United States, 
after New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.[36] The following smaller 
general aviation airports are also in the metro area: The metropolis also 
has four seaports, the largest and most important being the Port of Miami. 
Others in the area include Port Everglades, Port of Palm Beach and the 
Miami River Port. On August 21, 2012, PortMiami and the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers signed the Partnership Agreement (PPA) construction agreement 
that will allow the Deep Dredge project to go out for bid. The Deep Dredge 
will deepen the Port's existing channels to minus 50/52 feet to prepare 
for the Panama Canal expansion, now scheduled for completion in early 2015. 
PortMiami's deeper channel will provide ships with an economically efficient, 
reliable and safe navigational route into the Port. PortMiami will be the 
only U.S. Port south of Norfolk, Virginia to be at the minus 50 foot depth 
in sync with the opening of the expanded Canal. Deep Dredge is expected 
to create more than 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs in Florida 
and allow the Port to meet its goal to double its cargo traffic over the 
next decade. Miami-Dade Transit (MDT) is the largest public transit agency 
in Florida, operating rapid transit, people movers, and an intercity bus 
system. Metrorail is Florida's only rapid transit, currently with 23 stations 
on a 24.4-mile (39.3 km) track. The Downtown Miami people mover, Metromover, 
operates 20 stations and three lines on a 4.4-mile (7.1 km) track through 
the Downtown neighborhoods of the Omni, the central Downtown, and Brickell. 
Metrobus serves the entirety of Miami-Dade County, also serving Monroe 
County as far south as Marathon, and Broward County as far north as downtown 
Fort Lauderdale. In Broward County, Broward County Transit runs public 
buses, as does Palm Tran in Palm Beach County. Additionally, the South 
Florida Regional Transportation Authority operates Tri-Rail, a commuter 
rail train that connects the three of the primary cities of South Florida 
(Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach), and most intermediate points. 
South Florida has a tropical climate, the only major metropolitan area 
in the 48 contiguous states that falls under that category. More specifically, 
it generally has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification, 
Am).[37] The South Florida metropolis sees most of its rain in the summer 
(wet season) and is quite dry in winter (dry season). The wet season, which 
is hot and humid, lasts from May to October, when daily thunderstorms and 
passing weak tropical lows bring downpours during the late afternoon. The 
dry season often starts in late October and runs through late April. During 
the height of the dry season from February through April, south Florida 
is often very dry, and often brush fires and water restrictions are an 
issue. At times cold fronts can make it all the way down to south Florida 
and provide some modest rainfall in the dry season. The hurricane season 
largely coincides with the wet season.[38] In addition to its sea-level 
elevation, coastal location and position just above the Tropic of Cancer, 
the area owes its warm, humid climate to the Gulf Stream, which moderates 
climate year-round. A typical summer day does not see temperatures below 
75 °F (24 °C). Temperatures in the high 80s to low 90s (30–35 °C) accompanied 
by high humidity are often relieved by afternoon thunderstorms or a sea 
breeze that develops off the Atlantic Ocean, which then allow lower temperatures, 
although conditions still remain very muggy. During winter, dry air often 
dominates as dew points are often very low. Average daily highs across 
South Florida in winter are around 75 - 77 F, though daily highs in the 
low 80's are not uncommon. Minimum temperatures during the winter season 
are generally in the mid 50s to around 60 °F (10–15 °C), occasionally dipping 
into the upper 40s (7–9 °C) and rarely below 40 °F (5 °C). On average coastal 
South Florida is frost free, although there can be a frost inland a few 
times each decade. Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 through 
November 30, although hurricanes can develop outside that period. The most 
likely time for South Florida to be hit is during the peak of the Cape 
Verde season, mid-August through the end of September.[39] Due to its location 
between two major bodies of water known for tropical activity, South Florida 
is also statistically the most likely major area to be struck by a hurricane 
in the world, trailed closely by Nassau, Bahamas, and Havana, Cuba. Many 
hurricanes have affected the metropolis, including Betsy in 1965, Andrew 
in 1992, Irene in 1999, and Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma in 2005. In addition, 
a tropical depression in October 2000 passed over the city, causing record 
rainfall and flooding. Locally, the storm is credited as the No Name Storm 
of 2000, though the depression went on to become Tropical Storm Leslie 
upon entering the Atlantic Ocean. The Miami area is home to four major 
professional sports teams: The Miami area is also host to minor league 
sports, college sports, and other sports: The metropolis is governed by 
the 3 counties in the area. In total there are 107 municipalities or incorporated 
places in the metropolis. Each one of the municipalities has its own city, 
town or village government, although there is no distinction between the 
3 names. Much of the land in the metropolis is unincorporated, which means 
it does not belong to any municipality, and therefore is governed directly 
by the county it is located in. The Miami metropolitan area contains all 
or part of nine Congressional districts: the 18th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 
24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th districts.[40] The Cook Partisan Voting Index 
lists four as being Republican-leaning: the 18th, 25th, 26th, and 27th, 
with the 25th being the most Republican-leaning at R+5, and five as being 
Democratic-leaning: the 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, with the 24th 
being the most Democratic-leaning at D+34, making it the ninth-most Democratic-leaning 
district in the nation.[41] Greater Miami is served by several English-language 
and two major Spanish-language daily newspapers. The Miami Herald, headquartered 
in Downtown Miami, is Miami's primary newspaper with over a million readers. 
It also has news bureaus in Broward County, Monroe County, and Nassau, 
Bahamas. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel circulates primarily in Broward 
and southern Palm Beach counties and also has a news bureau in Havana, 
Cuba. The Palm Beach Post serves mainly Palm Beach County, especially the 
central and northern regions, and the Treasure Coast. The Boca Raton News 
publishes five days a week and circulates in southern Palm Beach County.[42] 
El Nuevo Herald, a subsidiary of the Miami Herald, and Diario Las Americas,[43] 
are Spanish-language daily papers that circulate mainly in Miami-Dade County. 
La Palma and El Sentinel are weekly Spanish newspapers published by the 
Palm Beach Post and Sun-Sentinel, respectively, and circulate in the same 
areas as their English-language counterparts. Greater Miami is split into 
two separate television/radio markets: The Miami-Fort Lauderdale market 
serves Miami-Dade, Broward and the Florida Keys. The West Palm Beach market 
serves Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast region. Miami-Fort Lauderdale 
is the 12th largest radio market and the 17th-largest television market 
in the U.S. television stations serving the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area 
include WAMI-TV (TeleFutura), WBFS-TV (MyNetworkTV), WSFL-TV (The CW), 
WFOR-TV (CBS), WHFT-TV (TBN), WLTV (Univision), WPLG (ABC), WPXM (ION), 
WSCV (Telemundo), WSVN (FOX), WTVJ (NBC), WLRN-TV (PBS), and WPBT (also 
PBS), the latter television station being the only channel to serve the 
entire metropolitan area. In addition to the Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, 
West Palm Beach has its own. It is the 49th largest radio market and the 
38th-largest television market in the U.S. Television stations serving 
the West Palm Beach area include WPTV (NBC), WPEC (CBS), WPBF (ABC), WFLX 
(FOX), WTVX (The CW), WXEL (PBS), WTCN (MyNetworkTV), and WPXP (ION). The 
West Palm Beach market shares use of WSCV and WLTV for Telemundo and Univision 
respectively. Also, both markets cross over and tend to be available interchangeably 
between both areas. http://www.exquisitemiamiproperties.com/ Coordinates:
