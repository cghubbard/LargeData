Fernando Rodney (born March 18, 1977) is a Dominican professional baseball 
pitcher who is currently a free agent. He previously played for the Detroit 
Tigers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Tampa Bay Rays, Seattle Mariners, 
Chicago Cubs, and San Diego Padres. Rodney is a three-time MLB All-Star. 
He won the MLB Delivery Man of the Year Award and American League Comeback 
Player of the Year Award in 2012. He throws a fastball between 96-99 mph 
(topping out at 100 mph), and a palmball in the low 80s. Rodney is the 
cousin of Alfredo Fígaro.[1][2] Rodney was signed by the Detroit Tigers 
as an amateur free agent in 1997. He spent 1999–2003 in the minor leagues, 
moving from the Gulf Coast League to the International League. Rodney underwent 
Tommy John surgery following the 2003 season (which he spent in the minor 
leagues). He spent the 2004 season recovering and failed to make the Tigers 
opening day roster after 2005 spring training. Rodney made his Major League 
debut 2002 at the age of 25 and split his time between the Triple-A Toledo 
Mud Hens and the Tigers from 2002–2005. In 2005, Rodney became the Tigers 
closer after Troy Percival went down with an arm injury and his replacement, 
Kyle Farnsworth, was traded at mid-season to the Atlanta Braves. He was 
called up from Toledo after Farnsworth was traded, then settled into the 
closer role, earning nine saves in 39 total appearances, during which he 
racked up a 2.86 earned run average. When the Tigers signed closer Todd 
Jones during the 2006 off-season, Rodney was reinserted into a middle relief/setup 
role. Rodney embraced the role as the Tigers proceeded to have their most 
successful season in recent history. On July 3, 2006, at McAfee Coliseum 
in Oakland, California, Justin Verlander, Joel Zumaya, and Rodney each 
threw multiple fastballs clocked in at over 100 mph, becoming the first 
time in MLB history that three pitchers on the same team had done so during 
one game. Rodney was part of the 2006 World Series roster, the first trip 
of Rodney's career to the MLB postseason tournament finals. The Tigers 
would end up losing the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. Rodney 
started 2008 on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis. He re-joined 
the big league club in mid-June. On July 27, Rodney was announced as the 
Tigers' new closer, replacing Todd Jones. Following the 2009 season, the 
Tigers offered arbitration to Rodney, which he rejected to pursue a multi-year 
deal.[3] He was expected to be one of the more valuable closers on the 
market because as a "Type B" free agent, he would only cost teams a supplementary 
draft pick. His 1.40 ground ball-to-fly ball ratio ranked first that year 
among free-agent closers.[4] Originally, the Baltimore Orioles and Philadelphia 
Phillies were rumored to be interested in signing Rodney. The Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim were also reported to be in serious discussions with 
his agent.[5] On December 24, 2009, Rodney signed a two-year, $11 million 
contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[6] Although he closed 
for the Detroit Tigers in 2009, "Rodney is expected to share setup duties 
with Scot Shields and Kevin Jepsen and close on a fill-in basis when Brian 
Fuentes is down", the LA Times reported.[7] Rodney states, "I think I'm 
a different pitcher in save situations", referring to his lower ERA in 
save situations. He filled in April for Angels' closer Brian Fuentes when 
he went on the disabled list with a strained back.[8] Three days after 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim traded Brian Fuentes on August 27, 2010 
to the Minnesota Twins,[9] it was officially announced that Rodney would 
be the new closer by manager Mike Scioscia.[10] On April 5, 2011, Rodney 
was replaced by Jordan Walden as the full-time closer. In late September 
2011, Rodney became frustrated after a lack of relief appearances and asked 
Angels general manager Tony Reagins for a trade.[11] Rodney signed a $1.75 
million deal with the Tampa Bay Rays for the 2012 season. While Kyle Farnsworth 
was on the 60-day disabled list, Rodney performed in the closer role and 
maintained that role after Farnsworth returned from his injury. He was 
selected on July 6 to participate in his first ever All-Star Game.[12] 
On that date, he had converted 24 of 25 save opportunities. At the end 
of the 2012 season, Rodney had converted 48 saves, the second most that 
season behind Jim Johnson of the Baltimore Orioles. His 0.60 earned run 
average for the season was the lowest by a qualifying relief pitcher in 
major league history.[13] On October 19, 2012, Rodney was named the AL 
Comeback Player of the Year and the Delivery Man of the Year[14] During 
his time with the Rays, Rodney appeared to shoot an arrow to high center 
field after converting a save as his celebration move. He is also known 
for wearing his cap tilted. On February 6, 2014, Rodney signed a 2-year, 
$14 million contract with the Seattle Mariners.[15] After leading the American 
League in saves in the first half of the season, Rodney was named as a 
late addition to the AL All-Star team, taking the spot of David Price (who 
had pitched the Sunday before the game and thus could not pitch in the 
actual All-Star Game). Rodney finished the 2014 season with a franchise 
record 48 saves, beating Kazuhiro Sasaki with 45 saves. The Mariners designated 
Rodney for assignment on August 22, 2015.[16] Rodney was traded to the 
Chicago Cubs for cash considerations on August 27, 2015.[16] He wore jersey 
#57, the first time in his career in which he wore a number other than 
56. His Cubs debut came on August 28 at Dodger Stadium, where he already 
blew a save during the season. He pitched a scoreless eighth despite hitting 
a batter and throwing a wild pitch. On February 4, 2016, Rodney signed 
a one-year, $2 million contract with the San Diego Padres.[17] On April 
11, 2016, Rodney pitched a scoreless ninth inning to record his first save 
as a Padre in a win over the Philadelphia Phillies. On June 30, 2016, Rodney 
was traded to the Miami Marlins for Chris Paddack.[18] Rodney is known 
for celebrating a save by pretending to shoot a bow and arrow toward the 
sky.[19][20] He started the routine after an April 16, 2012 save for the 
Tampa Bay Rays.[21] In a July 20, 2014 game against his former team, the 
Los Angeles Angels, Rodney did the routine after making the third out to 
end the eighth inning. However, this time he mimicked shooting the arrow 
at the Angels dugout. In the ninth inning after walking Mike Trout on five 
pitches, Angels player Albert Pujols hit a double, scoring Trout, and mimicked 
shooting a bow and arrow from second base towards Trout. Trout then "shot 
an arrow" back at Pujols. The Angels went on to win 6-5 with a walk-off 
hit by Grant Green the same inning.[22] Mariners broadcaster Dave Sims 
began calling "shoot that arrow in the sky!" when Rodney recorded a save.
