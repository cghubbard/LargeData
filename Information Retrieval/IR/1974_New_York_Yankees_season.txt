WPIX The 1974 New York Yankees season was the 72nd season for the team 
in New York and its 74th overall dating from its origins in Baltimore. 
The team finished with a record of 89-73, finishing 2 games behind the 
Baltimore Orioles. New York was managed by Bill Virdon. The Yankees played 
at Shea Stadium due to the ongoing renovation of Yankee Stadium. The off-season 
became controversial when George Steinbrenner and Gabe Paul sought to hire 
former Oakland Athletics manager Dick Williams, who had resigned immediately 
after leading the team to its second straight World Series title. However, 
because Williams was still under contract to Oakland, A's owner Charlie 
Finley sought to block the move, the subsequent legal wrangling prevented 
the Yankees from hiring him. On the first anniversary of the team's ownership 
change, the Yankees hired former Pittsburgh Pirates manager Bill Virdon 
to lead the team on the field. Mickey Mantle and former teammate Whitey 
Ford were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame together in 1974, Mantle 
in his first year of eligibility, Ford in his second. Ford's number 16 
was retired as well. Although Ford wore number 19 in his rookie season, 
following his return from the army in 1953, he wore number 16 for the remainder 
of his career. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Infielders
