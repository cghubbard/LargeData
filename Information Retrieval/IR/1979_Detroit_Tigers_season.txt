The 1979 Detroit Tigers finished in fifth place in the American League 
East with a record of 85-76, 18 games behind the Orioles. They outscored 
their opponents 770 to 738. The Tigers drew 1,630,929 fans to Tiger Stadium 
in 1979, ranking 7th of the 14 teams in the American League. This season 
is most notable for the Tigers' involvement in Disco Demolition Night, 
of which they were the visiting team to the Chicago White Sox and declared 
winners by forfeit. Sparky Anderson was hired as manager in mid-June and 
would continue manage the Tigers through the end of the 1995 season. [1]
