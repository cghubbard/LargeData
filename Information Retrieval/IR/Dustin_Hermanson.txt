Dustin Michael Hermanson (born December 21, 1972) is an American former 
right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. Hermanson played 
college baseball for Kent State, where he was a finalist for the Golden 
Spikes Award in 1994. He was selected in the first round of the 1994 Major 
League Baseball Draft with the third overall selection by the San Diego 
Padres. He then played for the Padres for two seasons before joining the 
Montreal Expos. After four seasons with the Expos, he moved around the 
majors, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Red Sox, San Francisco Giants, and 
Chicago White Sox. He served as the closer for the White Sox during most 
of their 2005 championship season, saving 34 games before being replaced 
by rookie Bobby Jenks in late September when he injured his back. Hermanson 
had a 2.04 ERA at the time of his injury. On October 30, 2006, the White 
Sox declined a 2007 option for $3.65 million on Hermanson. He received 
a $500,000 payout. He signed a minor league deal with a spring training 
invitation with the Reds on March 1, 2007, but was released on April 1.
