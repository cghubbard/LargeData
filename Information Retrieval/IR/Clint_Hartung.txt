Clint Hartung (August 10, 1922 – July 8, 2010) was a right-handed pitcher 
and right fielder in Major League Baseball who played with the New York 
Giants from 1947 to 1952. Clinton Clarence Hartung was born in Hondo, Texas, 
on August 10, 1922.[1] His high school team won a state baseball championship 
in 1939.[1] Originally signed for the Minneapolis Millers,[citation needed] 
Hartung played for the Eau Claire Bears of the Northern League for two 
months in 1942, hitting .358 and winning three games as a pitcher. He was 
then drafted into the Army Air Forces, where he spent the duration of World 
War II playing on military teams such as the Hickam Field Bombers; for 
the latter he went 25-0 as a pitcher and batted .567.[1] A year before 
his demobilization, the Giants signed him for $35,000, a very high sum, 
and expectations were proportionally high: Sportswriter Tom Meany later 
said of him, "Rather than stop at the Polo Grounds they should have taken 
him straight to Cooperstown."[2] In 1947 he finally debuted in the major 
leagues, but his performance under these conditions quickly proved less 
stellar. His first season he only managed 9–7 pitching and .306 hitting. 
In 1948 his stats declined to 8-8 and .179; his pitching never recovered, 
and 1950 was his last year in that job for the Giants, while his hitting 
did recover somewhat but he never achieved anything like his earlier numbers. 
As with some other phenoms, he was noted for doing much better in spring 
training than he would in the regular season. His fielding was never good, 
and reportedly he was unable to hit curveballs.[citation needed] After 
1950, he was relieved of his duties as a pitcher and was switched to the 
outfield—a very rare position shift in the major leagues. Hartung was the 
11th player in history whose first homer in the majors was as a pitcher 
to later hit a home run as a position player; the previous player to do 
so was Babe Ruth, but the next was not until Rick Ankiel repeated the feat 
in the 2000s.[3][4] He was at least present, though passively, as the pinch 
runner at third base in the 1951 play known as the Shot Heard 'Round the 
World. By 1954 he was back in the minor leagues, playing for the next two 
years for Cincinnati Redlegs' farm teams the Havana Sugar Kings of the 
International League and the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association. 
He also played for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. He played 
for the Plymouth (Oil Company) Oilers, a nationally known semi-pro team 
in Sinton, Texas, for several years after leaving the minor leagues, including 
the summer of 1956, the same year Don Larsen pitched his perfect World 
Series game against the Dodgers. The baseball statistical reference by 
Bill James commemorates Hartung with its "Clint Hartung Award", for the 
most overhyped rookie of each decade (and honors him with one for the 1940s),[5] 
and baseball-themed musician Terry Cashman wrote a song called "The Hondo 
Hurricane". Hartung died at his home in Sinton, Texas July 8, 2010.[1]
