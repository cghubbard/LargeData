Harl Vestin Maggert (February 13, 1883 – January 7, 1963) was a Major League 
Baseball outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Athletics. 
He was also a star in the Pacific Coast League before being suspended in 
1920 for fixing games. Born in Cromwell, Indiana, Maggert began his professional 
baseball career in 1906. He was drafted by the Pirates after the season 
and played in three games for them. He went back down to the minor leagues 
in 1908. In 1911, he hit .314 in the Pacific Coast League[1] and made the 
Athletics roster in 1912. He hit decently but left the A's after just one 
season. From 1913–1917, Maggert was the leadoff hitter for the PCL's Los 
Angeles Angels. He led the league in runs scored in 1913, 1914, and 1915, 
with over 125 all three times. He also paced the circuit in triples twice.[2] 
Maggert played for the San Francisco Seals in 1918 and the Salt Lake City 
Bees in 1919 and 1920. In 1919, he led the league in runs scored for the 
fourth time. In 1920, Maggert had the best season of his entire career. 
He was hitting .370 and on his way to the batting title – until he was 
suspended in midseason.[3] In late July 1920, Vernon Tigers first baseman 
Babe Borton handed Maggert $300, which aroused suspicion. Borton had previously 
offered the money to one of Maggert's teammates. In the ensuing investigation, 
it was discovered that Maggert and other Salt Lake City players had thrown 
games during the previous season so that Borton's Tigers could win the 
pennant.[3] Maggert was soon released by the Bees. In December, he and 
Borton were both cleared of all criminal charges in court.[4] However, 
Maggert, Borton, Gene Dale, and Bill Rumler were expelled from the Pacific 
Coast League.[3][5] Maggert never played in organized baseball again. Over 
the next few years, Maggert played in "outlaw" baseball leagues along with 
other suspended players, such as the Black Sox.[6] Maggert died in 1963
