Ernest "Ernie" Banks (January 31, 1931 – January 23, 2015), nicknamed "Mr. 
Cub" and "Mr. Sunshine", was an American professional baseball player who 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop and first baseman 
for the Chicago Cubs between 1953 and 1971. He was inducted into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977, and was named to the Major League Baseball 
All-Century Team in 1999. Banks is regarded by some as one of the greatest 
players of all time.[1][2][3] He began playing professional baseball in 
1950 with the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro leagues. He served in the 
U.S. military for two years, played for the Monarchs again, and began his 
major league career in September 1953. The following year, Banks was the 
National League Rookie of the Year runner-up. Beginning in 1955, Banks 
was a National League (NL) All-Star for 11 seasons,[4] playing in 13 of 
the 15 All-Star Games held during those seasons.[a] Banks was the Cubs' 
main attraction in the late 1950s, the National League Most Valuable Player 
in 1958 and 1959, and the Cubs' first Gold Glove winner in 1960. In 1962, 
Banks became a regular first baseman for the Cubs. In the mid-1960s, Cubs 
manager Leo Durocher became frustrated with Banks, saying the slugger's 
performance was faltering. Durocher said he was unable to remove Banks 
from the lineup due to the star's popularity among Cubs fans. Between 1967 
and 1971, he was a player-coach. In 1969, through a Chicago Sun-Times fan 
poll, Cubs fans voted him the greatest Cub ever. In 1970, Banks hit his 
500th career home run at Wrigley Field. He retired from playing in 1971, 
was a coach for the Cubs in 1972, and in 1982 was the team's first player 
to have his uniform number retired. Banks was active in the Chicago community 
during and after his tenure with the Cubs. He founded a charitable organization, 
became the first black Ford Motor Company dealer in the United States, 
and made an unsuccessful bid for a local political office. In 2013, Banks 
was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contribution to sports. 
Banks lived in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas. Banks was born in Dallas, 
Texas, to Eddie and Essie Banks on January 31, 1931;[5] he was the second 
of twelve children.[6] His father, who had worked in construction and was 
a warehouse loader for a grocery chain, played baseball for black, semi-professional 
teams in Texas.[5] As a child, Banks was not very interested in baseball, 
preferring swimming, basketball and football. His father bought Ernest 
a baseball glove for less than three dollars at a five and dime store and 
motivated Banks with nickels and dimes to play catch.[7] Banks's mother 
encouraged him to follow one of his grandfathers into a career as a minister.[8] 
Banks graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1950.[9] He lettered 
in basketball, football and track.[10] Banks' school did not have a baseball 
team; he played fastpitch softball for a church team during the summer. 
He was also a member of the Amarillo Colts, a semi-professional baseball 
team.[11] History professor Timothy Gilfoyle wrote that Banks' talent for 
baseball was discovered by Bill Blair, a family friend who scouted for 
the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League.[5] Other sources 
say Banks was noticed by Cool Papa Bell of the Monarchs.[12][13] In 1951, 
Banks was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in Germany during the Korean 
War.[14] He served as a flag bearer in the 45th Anti-Aircraft Artillery 
Battalion at Fort Bliss, where he played with the Harlem Globetrotters 
on a part-time basis.[5] In 1953, he was discharged from the army and joined 
the Monarchs for the remainder of that season, achieving a .347 batting 
average.[12][15] Banks later said, "Playing for the Kansas City Monarchs 
was like my school, my learning, my world. It was my whole life."[13] Banks 
signed with the Chicago Cubs in late 1953, making his major league debut 
on September 17 at age 22 and playing in 10 games at Wrigley Field. He 
was the Cubs' first black player; he became one of several former Negro 
league players who joined MLB teams without playing in the minor leagues.[12] 
Larry Moffi and Jonathan Kronstadt wrote that he "just was not the crusading 
type. He was so grateful to be playing baseball for a living, he did not 
have time to change the world, and if that meant some people called him 
an Uncle Tom, well, so be it."[16] During his first game for the Cubs, 
Banks received a visit from Jackie Robinson that influenced his quiet presence 
in baseball. Robinson told Banks, "Ernie, I'm glad to see you're up here 
so now just listen and learn ... For years, I didn't talk and learned a 
lot about people".[17] Later, when Banks felt like becoming more vocal, 
he discussed the issue with teammate Billy Williams, who advised him to 
remain quiet. Williams drew the analogy of fish that are caught once they 
open their mouths. Banks said, "I kept my mouth shut but tried to make 
a difference. My whole life, I've just wanted to make people better".[17] 
In 1954, Banks' double play partner during his official rookie season was 
Gene Baker, the Cubs' second black player. Banks and Baker roomed together 
on road trips and became the first all-black double-play combination in 
major league history.[18] When Steve Bilko played first base, Cubs announcer 
Bert Wilson referred to the Banks-Baker-Bilko double play combination as 
"Bingo to Bango to Bilko".[19] Banks hit 19 home runs and finished second 
to Wally Moon in Rookie of the Year voting.[20] Banks participated in a 
trend toward lighter baseball bats after he accidentally picked up a teammate's 
bat and liked that it was easy to generate bat speed.[7] In 1955, Banks 
hit 44 home runs, had 117 RBI and batted .295. He played and was the starting 
NL shortstop in his first of 13 All-Star Games that season.[20] His home 
run total was a single-season record among shortstops.[21] He also set 
a thirty-year record of five single-season grand slam home runs.[22] Banks 
finished third in 1955 in the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, 
behind Roy Campanella and Duke Snider.[23] The Cubs finished with a 72–81 
win-loss record, winning 29 of 77 road games.[24] In 1956, Banks missed 
18 games due to a hand infection, breaking his run of 424 consecutive games 
played.[25] He finished the season with 28 home runs, 85 RBIs, and a .297 
batting average. He made the All-Star selection as a reserve player but 
did not play in the game. In 1957, Banks finished the season with 43 home 
runs, 102 RBI, and a .285 batting average.[20] In 1958 and 1959, Banks 
became the first NL player to be awarded back-to-back MVP Awards, leading 
the league in RBI in both those seasons (with 129 and 143, respectively) 
. Banks hit a major-league-leading 47 home runs in 1958, while batting 
.313, third best in the NL. The following year, he hit .304 with 45 home 
runs.[26] In 1959, the Cubs came the closest to a winning season since 
Banks' arrival, finishing with a 74–80 record.[27] In 1960, Banks hit a 
major league and NL-leading 41 HR, had 117 RBI, and led the NL in games 
played for the sixth time in seven years.[20] He was also the first Cubs 
player to receive an annual NL Gold Glove award (for shortstop). On the 
eve of the 1960 World Series, Joe Reichler, a writer for the Associated 
Press, reported that the Milwaukee Braves were prepared to pay cash and 
trade pitchers Joey Jay, Carlton Willey and Don Nottebart, outfielder Billy 
Bruton, shortstop Johnny Logan and first baseman Frank Torre in exchange 
for Banks from the Cubs.[28] In 1961, Banks experienced problems with a 
knee injury he had acquired while in the army. After 717 consecutive games, 
he removed himself from the Cubs lineup for at least four games, ending 
his pursuit of the record for playing in the most consecutive NL games 
of 895 games set by Stan Musial.[29] In May, the Cubs announced that Jerry 
Kindall would replace Banks at shortstop and that Banks would move to left 
field.[30] Banks later said, "Only a duck out of water could have shared 
my loneliness in left field".[31] Banks credited center fielder Richie 
Ashburn with helping him learn to play left field; in 23 games Banks committed 
only one error. In June, he was moved to first base, learning that position 
from former first baseman and Cubs coach Charlie Grimm.[32] He was not 
selected to be an All-Star for the first of two All-Star games that season 
since 1959, when MLB started having two All-Star Games per season through 
1962,[33] but was selected as a reserve player. Banks was a pinch hitter 
in the second All-Star game. The Cubs began playing under the College of 
Coaches in 1961, a system in which decisions were made by a group of 12 
coaches rather than by one manager.[34] By the 1962 season, Banks hoped 
to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he 
would remain at first base indefinitely.[35] In May 1962, Banks was hit 
in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was 
taken off the field unconscious.[36] He sustained a concussion, spent two 
nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and 
a double on Tuesday.[37] In May 1963, Banks set a single-game record of 
22 putouts by a first baseman.[38] However, he caught mumps that year and 
finished the season with 18 home runs, 64 RBI, and a .227 batting average. 
Despite Banks' struggles that season, the Cubs had their first winning 
record since the 1940s. Banks, following his doctor's orders, avoided his 
usual off-season participation in handball and basketball, and began the 
1964 season weighing seven pounds (3.2 kg) more than the previous year. 
In February, Cubs second baseman Ken Hubbs was killed in an airplane crash.[39] 
Banks finished the season with 23 home runs, 95 RBI, and a .264 batting 
average.[20] The Cubs finished in eighth place in 1964, losing over $315,000.[40] 
In 1965, Banks hit 28 home runs, had 107 RBI, a .265 batting average, and 
played and started at first base in the All-Star Game. On September 2, 
he hit his 400th home run.[20][41] The Cubs finished the season with a 
baseball operations deficit of $1.2 million, though this was largely offset 
by television and radio revenue, and the rental of Wrigley Field to the 
Chicago Bears football team.[42] The Cubs hired Leo Durocher as manager 
in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed interest in the team's fan base.[43] 
Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place 
with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career.[44] 
From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability 
to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says: 
 ... [Banks] was a great player in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn't 
my time. Even more unfortunately, there was not a thing I could do about 
it. He couldn't run, he couldn't field; toward the end, he couldn't even 
hit. There are some players who instinctively do the right thing on the 
base paths. Ernie had an unfailing instinct for doing the wrong thing. 
But I had to play him. Had to play the man or there would have been a revolution 
in the street."[45] Banks said of Durocher, "I wish there had been someone 
around like him early in my career ... He's made me go for that little 
extra needed to win".[46] Durocher served as Cubs manager until mid-1972, 
the season after Banks retired.[20][47] In his memoir Mr. Cub, published 
around the time that Banks retired, Banks said too much had been made of 
the racial implications in his relationship with Durocher;; he said: My 
philosophy about race relations is that I'm the man and I'll set my own 
patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man 
as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because 
you are black you will never be treated fairly, and that you should voice 
your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't 
convince a fool against his will ... If a man doesn't like me because I'm 
black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him 
change my life.[48] The Cubs appointed Banks a player-coach for the 1967 
season. Banks competed with John Boccabella for a starting position at 
first base.[49] Shortly after, Durocher named Banks the outright starter 
at first base.[50] Banks hit 23 home runs and drove in 95 runs, and went 
to the All-Star Game that year.[20] After the 1967 season, an article in 
Ebony said Banks was not thought to have made more than $65,000 (equal 
to $462,071 today) in any season. He had received a pay increase from $33,000 
to $50,000 between his MVP seasons in 1958 and 1959, but Ebony said several 
MLB players were making $100,000 at the time.[6] Banks won the Lou Gehrig 
Memorial Award in 1968, an honor recognizing playing ability and personal 
character.[51] The 37-year-old Banks hit 32 home runs, had 83 RBI, and 
finished that season with a .246 batting average.[20] In 1969, he came 
the closest to helping the Cubs win the National League pennant; the Cubs 
fell from first place after holding an 8 1⁄2 game lead in August.[52] Banks 
made his 11th and final All-Star season appearance as a pinch hitter; it 
was his 14th All-Star Game appearance that season.[b][20][53][54] Banks 
hit his 500th home run on May 12, 1970, at Chicago's Wrigley Field.[41] 
On December 1, 1971, Banks retired as a player but continued to coach for 
the Cubs until 1973. He was an instructor in the minor leagues for the 
next three seasons and also worked in the Cubs' front office.[55] Banks 
finished his career with 512 home runs; his 277 home runs as a shortstop 
were a career record at the time of his retirement. (Cal Ripken, Jr now 
holds the record for most home runs as a shortstop with 345.[56]) Banks 
holds Cubs records for games played (2,528), at-bats (9,421), extra-base 
hits (1,009) and total bases (4,706).[57] Banks also excelled as an infielder; 
he won a National League Gold Glove Award for shortstop in 1960. He led 
the NL in putouts five times and was the NL leader in fielding percentage 
as shortstop three times, and once as first baseman.[20] Banks holds the 
major league record for most games played without a postseason appearance 
(2,528).[58] In his memoir, citing his fondness for the Cubs and owner 
Philip K. Wrigley, Banks said he did not regret signing with the Cubs rather 
than one of the more successful baseball franchises.[59] Banks' popularity 
and positive attitude led to the nicknames "Mr. Cub" and "Mr. Sunshine".[60][61] 
Banks was known for his catchphrase, "It's a beautiful day for a ballgame ... Let's 
play two!", expressing his wish to play a doubleheader every day out of 
his love of baseball.[60] In 1953, after returning from military service 
in Germany, Banks married his first wife Mollye Ector. He proposed to her 
in a letter from Germany.[62] Although he filed for divorce two years later, 
the couple briefly reconciled in early 1959.[63] By that summer, they agreed 
on a divorce settlement that would pay $65,000 to Ector in lieu of alimony.[64] 
Shortly thereafter, Banks eloped with Eloyce Johnson. The couple had twin 
sons within a year and a daughter four years after that.[65] Ector filed 
suit against Banks in 1963 for failure to make payments on a life insurance 
policy agreed upon in their divorce settlement.[66] Banks was a lifelong 
Republican – and he also once stated that "I'm not goin' anywhere I'm not 
wanted" – prompting critics to claim that he was "soft" on Jim Crow; he 
ran for alderman in Chicago in 1963.[67] He lost the election and later 
said, "People knew me only as a baseball player. They didn't think I qualified 
as a government official and no matter what I did I couldn't change my 
image ... What I learned, was that it was going to be hard for me to disengage 
myself from my baseball life and I would have to compensate for it after 
my playing days were over."[68] In 1966, Banks worked for Seaway National 
Bank in the off-season and enrolled in a banking correspondence course.[6] 
He bought into several business ventures, including a gas station, during 
his playing career.[6] Though he had been paid modestly in comparison to 
other baseball stars, Banks had taken the advice of Wrigley and invested 
much of his earnings. He later spent time working for an insurance company 
and for New World Van Lines. Banks began building assets that would be 
worth an estimated $4 million by the time he was 55 years old.[48] Banks 
and Bob Nelson became the first black owners of a U.S. Ford Motor Company 
dealership in 1967. Nelson had been the first non-white commissioned officer 
in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II; he operated an 
import car dealership before the venture with Banks.[69] Banks was appointed 
to the board of directors of the Chicago Transit Authority in 1969.[70] 
On a trip to Europe, Banks visited the Pope, who presented him with a medal 
that became a proud possession.[6] Banks was divorced from Eloyce in 1981. 
She received several valuable items from his playing career as part of 
their divorce settlement, including his 500th home run ball. She sold the 
items not long after the divorce.[71] He remarried in 1984.[72] In 1993, 
his third wife Marjorie was part of a group that met with MLB executives 
to discuss race relations in baseball after allegations of racial slurs 
surfaced against Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott.[73] Banks married 
Liz Ellzey in 1997 and Hank Aaron served as his best man.[74] In late 2008, 
Banks and Ellzey adopted an infant daughter.[75] Banks's nephew, Bob Johnson, 
was a major league catcher and first baseman for the Texas Rangers between 
1981 and 1983.[76] His great nephew, Acie Law, is a professional basketball 
player who attended Texas A&M University before playing in the National 
Basketball Association (NBA).[77] Banks was voted into the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1977, his first year of eligibility.[79] He received votes 
on 321 of the 383 ballots.[20] Though several players were selected through 
the Veterans Committee and the Special Committee on the Negro Leagues that 
year, Banks was the only player elected by the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America. He was inducted on August 8 of that year. During his induction 
speech, Banks said, "We've got the setting – sunshine, fresh air, the team 
behind us. So let's play two!"[80] The Cubs retired Banks' uniform number 
14 in 1982.[57] He was the first player to have his number retired by the 
team.[81] At the time of the ceremony, Banks was employed as the Cubs' 
corporate sales representative.[82] The team did not retire any more numbers 
for another five years, when Billy Williams received the honor. Through 
the 2014 season, only six former Cubs, along with Brooklyn Dodger Jackie 
Robinson, have had their numbers retired by the organization.[83] Banks 
served as a team ambassador after his retirement, though author Phil Rogers 
says the team had never placed Banks in a position of authority or significant 
influence.[84] In 1983, shortly after Wrigley sold the team to the Tribune 
Company, Banks and the Cubs briefly severed ties. Rogers wrote that after 
the sale, Banks was viewed as "something of a crazy uncle who hung around 
the house for no apparent reason",[84] and that team officials anonymously 
told the press that Banks had been fired because he was unreliable. Soon 
Banks and the Cubs reconciled and he resumed making appearances on behalf 
of the team.[84] In 1984, when the Cubs won the NL East division, the club 
named Banks an honorary team member.[85] At the 1990 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game, the first one held at Wrigley Field since Banks' playing 
days, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch to starting catcher Mike 
Scioscia.[86] Banks was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century 
Team in 1999.[87] In the same year, the Society for American Baseball Research 
listed him 27th on a list of the 100 greatest baseball players.[88] In 
June 2006, Crain's Chicago Business said Banks was part of a group looking 
into buying the Chicago Cubs in case the Tribune Company decided to sell 
the club.[89] Banks established a charity, the Live Above & Beyond Foundation, 
which assists youth and the elderly with issues including self-esteem and 
healthcare.[90] In 2008, Banks released a charity wine called Ernie Banks 
512 Chardonnay, the proceeds of which were donated to his foundation.[91] 
Banks was an ordained minister; he presided at the wedding of MLB pitcher 
Sean Marshall.[92] On March 31, 2008, a statue of Banks ("Mr. Cub") was 
unveiled in front of Wrigley Field.[93] That year, Eddie Vedder released 
a song called "All The Way", which Banks had asked Vedder to write about 
the Cubs as a birthday gift.[94] In 2009, Banks was named a Library of 
Congress Living Legend, a designation that recognizes those "who have made 
significant contributions to America's diverse cultural, scientific and 
social heritage".[95] In 2013, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom[96] 
with 15 other people, including Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. During 
the ceremony, he presented President Obama with a bat that had belonged 
to Jackie Robinson.[97] Banks remained close to the Cubs team and made 
frequent appearances at their spring training grounds, HoHoKam Stadium 
in Arizona. Author Harry Strong wrote in 2013 that "the Chicago Cubs do 
not have a mascot, but they hardly need one when the face of the franchise 
is still so visible".[98] Ernie Banks was inducted as a Laureate of The 
Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's 
highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1970 in the area of Sports.[99] 
Banks died of a heart attack at a Chicago hospital on January 23, 2015, 
eight days before his 84th birthday.[100] Following a public visitation, 
a memorial service was held at the Fourth Presbyterian Church. Several 
well-known people spoke at the service, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel 
and baseball personalities Joe Torre and Billy Williams. After the service, 
a procession moved from Downtown Chicago past Wrigley Field.[101] In the 
weeks after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks' estate and the 
disposition of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth said that he had 
amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all 
of Banks' assets to his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been 
diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will.[102] A Chicago 
funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the 
bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. 
In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the funeral 
home costs.[103] Banks was buried in Graceland Cemetery, just a few blocks
