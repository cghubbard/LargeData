The Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, typically known as the Oakland Coliseum 
for short, is a multi-purpose stadium in Oakland, California, United States, 
which is home to both the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB) 
and the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). It opened 
in 1966 and is the only remaining stadium in the United States that is 
shared by professional football and baseball teams. The Coliseum was also 
home to some games of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer in 
2008–2009 and hosted games at the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The Coliseum 
has 6,300 club seats, 2,700 of which are available for Athletics games, 
143 luxury suites, 125 of which are available for Athletics games, and 
a variable seating capacity of 35,067 for baseball, 56,057 for football 
and 63,132 for soccer. In seating capacity, Oakland Coliseum is the smallest 
NFL stadium, and the 2nd smallest MLB stadium. The Oakland–Alameda County 
Coliseum complex consists of the stadium and the neighboring Oracle Arena. 
The Coliseum features an underground design where the playing surface is 
actually below ground level (21 feet/6 meters below sea level). Consequently, 
fans entering the stadium find themselves walking on to the main concourse 
of the stadium at the top of the first level of seats. This, combined with 
the hill that was built around the stadium to create the upper concourse, 
means that only the third deck is visible from outside the park. This gives 
the Coliseum the illusion of being a short stadium from the outside. In 
its baseball configuration, the Coliseum has the most foul territory of 
any major league ballpark in Major League Baseball. Thus, many balls that 
would reach the seats in other ballparks can be caught for outs at the 
Coliseum. The distance to the backstop was initially 90 feet (27 m), but 
was reduced to 60 feet (18 m) in 1969. From 1968 through 1981 and in 1995, 
two football configurations were used at the stadium. During Raider preseason 
games and all regular season games played while the baseball season was 
still going on, the field was set up from home plate to center field (east/west). 
Seats that were down the foul lines for baseball games became the sideline 
seats for football games, which started up to 120 feet away from the field 
(most football-only stadiums have sideline seats that start around 60 feet 
away). Once the A's season ended, the orientation was switched to north/south: 
i.e. the football field ran from the left field line to the right field 
line; seats were moved from behind first and third base to create corners 
for the end zone to fit into (these seats were then placed to fill in the 
space that was normally behind home plate and near the foul poles for baseball 
games). Temporary football bleachers were then added in front of the baseball 
bleachers to form the sideline on the east (visitors') side, and the baseball 
bleachers were not sold. Raiders season ticket holders would thus have 
two season ticket locations in different parts of the stadium that roughly 
corresponded to the same location in relation to the field. Since stadium 
expansion in 1996, the field has run north/south throughout the season. 
Business and political leaders in Oakland had long been in competition 
with neighbor San Francisco, as well as other cities in the West, and worked 
for Oakland and its suburbs (the greater East Bay) to be recognized nationally 
as a viable metropolitan area with its own identity and reputation, distinct 
and separate from that of San Francisco. Professional sports was seen as 
a primary way for the East Bay to gain such recognition. As a result, the 
desire for a major-league caliber stadium in the city of Oakland intensified 
during the 1950s and 1960s.[citation needed] By 1960, a non-profit corporation 
was formed to oversee the financing and development of the facility (rather 
than city or county government issuing taxpayer-backed bonds for construction). 
Local real estate developer Robert T. Nahas headed this group (which included 
other prominent East Bay business leaders such as former US Senator William 
Knowland and Edgar F. Kaiser), which later became the governing board of 
the Coliseum upon completion. It was Nahas' idea that the Coliseum be privately 
financed with ownership transferring to the city and county upon retirement 
of the construction financing.[9] Robert T. Nahas served 20 years as President 
of the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Board. On the death of Nahas, the 
San Francisco Chronicle's Rick DelVecchio quoted Jack Maltester, a former 
San Leandro mayor and Coliseum board member, "If not for Bob Nahas, there 
would be no Coliseum, it's really that simple." Nahas had to be a diplomat 
dealing with the egos of Raiders owner Al Davis, Athletics owner Charles 
O. Finley, and Warriors owner Franklin Mieuli. Preliminary architectural 
plans were unveiled in November 1960, and the following month a site was 
chosen west of the Elmhurst district of East Oakland alongside the then-recently 
completed Nimitz Freeway. A downtown site adjacent to Lake Merritt and 
the Oakland Auditorium (which itself, many years later, would be renamed 
the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center) was also originally considered.[9] 
The Port of Oakland played a key role in the East Oakland site selection; 
The Port swapped 157 acres (64 ha) at the head of San Leandro Bay to the 
East Bay Regional Park District, in exchange for 105 acres (42 ha) of park 
land across the freeway, which the Port in turn donated to the City of 
Oakland as the site for the Coliseum sports complex.[10] The Oakland Raiders 
of the American Football League moved to Frank Youell Field, a makeshift 
stadium near downtown Oakland, in 1962, and the Coliseum was already being 
heralded in the local media as the Raiders' future permanent home. Baseball 
was also a major factor in the planning of the Coliseum. As early as 1961, 
the American League publicly indicated that it wished to include Oakland 
in its West Coast expansion plans. In 1963, American League president Joe 
Cronin suggested that Coliseum officials model some aspects of the new 
ballpark after then-new Dodger Stadium, which impressed him,[11] though 
these expansion plans seemed to fade by the middle of the decade. After 
approval from the city of Oakland as well as Alameda County by 1962, $25 
million in financing was arranged. Plans were drawn for a stadium, an indoor 
arena, and an exhibition hall in between them. The architect of record 
was the San Francisco office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (with Myron 
Goldsmith the principal design architect[12]) and the general contractor 
was Guy F. Atkinson Company. Preliminary site preparation began in the 
summer of 1961. Construction began in the spring of 1962. The construction 
schedule was delayed for two years due to various legal issues and cost 
overruns; the original design of the Coliseum had to be modified slightly 
in order to stay on budget.[13] (For details on the indoor arena, now known 
as Oracle Arena, refer to that facility's article.) In 1965, it was rumored 
that the Cleveland Indians might leave Cleveland for a West Coast city 
(such as Oakland), but the Indians ended up remaining in Cleveland. Charlie 
Finley, owner of the Kansas City A's, unhappy in Kansas City, impressed 
by Oakland's new stadium and personally convinced to consider Oakland by 
Nahas,[14] eventually got permission after several unsuccessful attempts 
and amid considerable controversy, to relocate his American League franchise 
to the stadium for the 1968 season (for details on the controversy, see 
the separate articles for the A's and the Kansas City Royals, the expansion 
franchise created to replace the A's in Kansas City). The Raiders played 
their first game at the stadium on September 18, 1966. In 1968, the Kansas 
City Athletics moved to Oakland and began play at the stadium. The Athletics' 
first game was played on April 17, 1968. The stadium complex cost $25.5 
million to build and rests on 120 acres (49 ha) of land. On April 17, 1968, 
Boog Powell hit the first major league home run in the history of the Coliseum.[15] 
On May 8 of that year, Catfish Hunter pitched the ninth perfect game in 
Major League history at the Coliseum.[16] The Coliseum hosted the 1967 
and 1969 AFL championship games. From 1970 to 1972 the stadium hosted 3 
college football benefit games featuring Bay Area schools versus historically 
black colleges. The Coliseum hosted the 1971 East–West Shrine Game on January 
2, 1971. In 1972, the Athletics won their first of 3 straight World Series 
championships and their first since their years in Philadelphia. Commencing 
in 1973, the stadium hosted an annual Day on the Green concert series, 
presented by Bill Graham and his company Bill Graham Presents, which continued 
on into the early 1990s. Marvin Gaye made his official return to live performing 
and touring at the Coliseum on January 4, 1974 and the Coliseum was the 
basis for his 1 million-selling live album, Marvin Gaye Live! At the time, 
music industry executives cited the tour as a "heralded event" as Gaye 
made a comeback to live touring nearly 4 years after the death of his late 
singing partner Tammi Terrell. Led Zeppelin played what turned out to be 
their final North American concerts with twin shows during their 1977 North 
American Tour. After their first show on July 23, members of Led Zeppelin's 
entourage were arrested after a member of promoter Bill Graham's staff 
was physically assaulted during the performance. Parliament-Funkadelic 
recorded half the album Live: P-Funk Earth Tour at the Oakland Coliseum 
in January 1977. The album was released in April of that year. The awkwardness 
of the baseball-football conversion, as well as the low seating capacity 
(around 54,000 for football) and that the prime seating on the east side 
consisted of temporary bleachers led the Raiders to explore other stadium 
options. One such option was Memorial Stadium on the UC Berkeley campus. 
Several preseason games were played there in the early 1970s along with 
one regular season game in 1973 (a 12-7 victory over the Miami Dolphins 
during September while the A's regular season was going on). However, in 
response to traffic and parking issues associated with these games (while 
Cal games drew a large number of students who live on or near campus and 
walk to the games, Raiders games attracted fans from a larger geographic 
area who were used to tailgating at the Coliseum and were more likely to 
drive to games), the City of Berkeley passed a Professional Sports Events 
License Tax in which the city collected 10% of all gate receipts, making 
the staging of professional games inside the city cost-prohibitive. The 
Raiders were granted an injunction from the city collecting the tax, arguing 
that the tax was a regulatory measure rather than a revenue measure, and 
was therefore an improper regulation on land held in trust by the Regents 
of the University of California. However, the grant of the injunction was 
reversed by the California Court of Appeals, who found it to be a revenue 
measure, despite the fact that the city had made the measure immediately 
effective "due to danger to the public peace, health, and safety of the 
City of Berkeley as a result of the holding of professional sports events 
there".[17] The stadium was not well maintained for most of the late 1970s. 
Its condition was most noticeable during baseball season, when crowds for 
A's games twice numbered fewer than 1,000. On April 17, 1979, only 653 
fans attended the game versus the Seattle Mariners.[18] During this time, 
it was popularly known as the "Oakland Mausoleum". In 1980, the Raiders 
won Super Bowl XV. Two years later, the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, leaving 
the A's as the only remaining tenants of Oakland Coliseum. Only days later, 
Finley agreed to sell the A's to Marvin Davis, who planned to move the 
A's to Denver. However, city and county officials were not about to lose 
Oakland's status as a major-league city in its own right, and refused to 
let the A's out of their lease. Finley was forced to sell the team to the 
owners of San Francisco-based Levi Strauss & Co.. After the 1986 Major 
League Baseball season, the original scoreboards were replaced. A new American 
Sign and Indicator scoreboard and message center was installed behind the 
left-field bleachers, while the original right-field scoreboard was replaced 
with a manually operated out-of-town scoreboard. Between the centerfield 
flagpoles, a new Diamond Vision videoscreen was installed. The 1987 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game was held at the stadium. From 1988 to 1990, 
the venue saw 3 more World Series. In 1989, the Athletics won their 4th 
Series since moving to Oakland, sweeping the San Francisco Giants in the 
earthquake-interrupted "Battle of the Bay" Series. The stadium played host 
to Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! Benefit Concert on September 
23, 1988. The show was headlined by Sting and Peter Gabriel and also featured 
Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, Tracy Chapman, Youssou N'Dour, Roy 
Orbison and Joan Baez. In the 1990s, several major concerts were held, 
but these were not "Days on the Green", by definition, because they occurred 
at night. Richard Marx shot the video for "Take This Heart" on the baseball 
field of the Coliseum. Metallica and Guns N' Roses brought the Guns N' 
Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour to the Coliseum on September 24, 1992, with 
Body Count as their opening act. The stadium was the location for the 1994 
Disney movie Angels in the Outfield. Although Angel Stadium of Anaheim 
(known as Anaheim Stadium at the time) was where the Angels actually played, 
it was damaged in the 1994 Southern California earthquake. Anaheim Stadium 
was used for views from the outside and aerial views, while the Coliseum 
was used for interior shots. In July 1995, the Raiders agreed to return 
to Oakland provided that Oakland Coliseum underwent renovations. In November 
1995, those renovations commenced and continued through the next summer 
until the beginning of the 1996 football season (more info below). The 
new layout also had the somewhat peculiar effect of creating an inward 
jog in the outfield fence, in left-center and right-center. There are now 
three distance markers instead of one, at various points of the power alleys, 
as indicated in the dimensions grid. The Raiders return also heralded the 
creation of the "Black Hole", a highly recognizable group of fans who occupy 
one end zone seating during football games. Along with the since-demolished 
Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, the stadium features the unusual configuration 
of laying the football field on a line from first to third base rather 
than laying it from home plate to center field, or parallel to one of the 
foul lines, as with most multipurpose facilities. Thus, a seat behind home 
plate for baseball is behind the 50-yard line for football. With the Miami 
Marlins opening their own ballpark in 2012, the stadium became the last 
remaining venue in the United States that hosts both a Major League Baseball 
and a National Football League team.[19] On April 2, 2006, the broadcast 
booth was renamed in honor of the late Bill King, a legendary Bay Area 
sportscaster who was the play-by-play voice of the A's, Raiders and Warriors 
for 44 years. On September 8, 2006, the stadium played host to The Gigantour, 
featuring performances by Megadeth, Lamb of God, Opeth, Arch Enemy, Overkill, 
Into Eternity, Sanctity and The SmashUp.[20] In November 2007, the San 
Jose Earthquakes, of Major League Soccer, announced they would be playing 
their "big draw" games, such as those featuring David Beckham and the Los 
Angeles Galaxy, at the stadium instead of their then-home Buck Shaw Stadium 
(capacity roughly over 10,000) in Santa Clara.[21] Since then the Quakes 
moved to their new home of Avaya Stadium and play their bigger games in 
nearby Stanford Stadium. Midway through the decade, the stadium established 
a "no re-entry" policy. Each ticket can only be used once, after which 
a second ticket must be purchased in order to re-enter the Coliseum. On 
May 9, 2010, almost 42 years to the day of Catfish Hunter's perfect game, 
Dallas Braden pitched the 19th perfect game in Major League history at 
the Coliseum. A commemorative graphic was placed on the baseball outfield 
wall next to Rickey Henderson's retired number on May 17, their next home 
game. U2 performed during their 360° Tour on June 7, 2011, with Lenny Kravitz 
and Moonalice as their opening acts. The show was originally scheduled 
to take place on June 16, 2010, but was postponed, due to Bono's emergency 
back surgery.[22] The stadium has hosted an AMA Supercross Championship 
round since 2011.[23] As part of a new 10-year lease signed by the Athletics 
with the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority in 2014, the Oakland 
Coliseum had a new $10 million scoreboard system (two large outfield scoreboards, 
36 feet tall and 145 feet wide, and two ribbon scoreboards) installed for 
the start of the 2015 MLB season. Also part of the new lease, the Coliseum 
Authority agreed to pay $1 million a year, with 5% annual increases, into 
a fund to maintain the stadium.[24] For more than its first three decades 
(1966–1998) the stadium was known as Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum.[25] 
In September 1997, UMAX Technologies agreed to acquire the naming rights 
to the stadium. However, following a dispute, a court decision reinstated 
the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum name. In 1998, Network Associates agreed 
to pay US$5.8 million over 5 years for the naming rights and the stadium 
became known as Network Associates Coliseum, or, alternately in marketing 
and media usage as, "the Net".[26] In 2003, Network Associates renewed 
the contract for an additional five years at a cost of $6 million. In mid-2004, 
Network Associates was renamed McAfee, restoring its name from before its 
1997 merger with Network General, and the stadium was renamed McAfee Coliseum 
accordingly. In 2008, McAfee was offered a renewal of the naming contract, 
but it was declined. On September 19, 2008, the name reverted to the pre-1997 
name of Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum. The stadium retained its original 
name until April 27, 2011, when it was renamed Overstock.com Coliseum via 
a 6-year, $7.2 million naming rights deal with online retailer Overstock.com. 
On June 6, 2011, the Coliseum was renamed O.co Coliseum, after Overstock.com's 
marketing name.[27] However, due to a contract dispute with the Athletics 
regarding the Overstock/O.co naming rights deal, the A's referred to the 
stadium as the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum in all official team communications 
and on team websites.[28] On April 2, 2016, Overstock.com opted out of 
the final year on their naming rights deal, and the stadium was re-branded 
from O.co Coliseum to Oakland Alameda Coliseum.[29][30][31] On August 12, 
2005, the A's new owner Lewis Wolff made the A's first official proposal 
for a new ballpark in Oakland to the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority. 
The new stadium would have been located across 66th Avenue from the Coliseum 
in what is currently an industrial area north of the Coliseum. The park 
would have held 35,000 fans, making it the smallest park in the major leagues. 
Plans for the Oakland location fell through in early 2006 when several 
of the owners of the land proposed for the new ballpark made known their 
wish not to sell. Throughout 2006, the Athletics continued to search for 
a ballpark site within their designated territory of Alameda County. Late 
in 2006, rumors began to circulate regarding a 143-acre (58 ha) parcel 
of land in Fremont, California being the new site. These rumors were confirmed 
by the Fremont city council on November 8 of that year. Wolff met with 
the council that day to present his plan to move the A's to Fremont into 
a soon to be built ballpark named Cisco Field. Wolff and Cisco Systems 
conducted a press conference at the San Jose-based headquarters of Cisco 
Systems on November 14, 2006 to confirm the deal, and showcase some details 
of the future plan. However, on February 24, 2009, after delays and increased 
public opposition, the Athletics officially ended their search for a stadium 
site in Fremont.[32] Speculation was raised as to whether or not the Athletics 
franchise would remain in Northern California in the long term as a result 
of the termination of the Cisco Field plan. In 2010, two building sites 
have become leading candidates for a new Athletics' home: a site in downtown 
San Jose located near SAP Center (home of the NHL's San Jose Sharks) and 
a proposed stadium near Jack London Square in Oakland at a site referred 
to as Victory Court.[33] Under any such replacement proposals, the Oakland 
Raiders would presumably continue to play football in the Coliseum, although 
there have been recent proposals for the Raiders to play at Levi's Stadium, 
the home of the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara as well as rumors regarding 
the Raiders' possible return to Los Angeles.[34][35][36] In 2013, the Oakland 
Raiders have proposed a 50,000-seat stadium in the same spot of their current 
stadium. It would cost $800 million, with $300 million coming from the 
Raiders, $200 million coming from the NFL's stadium loan program, and the 
final $300 million coming from the city.[37] On July 22, 2014, the Athletics 
signed a 10-year lease to stay in Oakland and at the Coliseum. The deal 
requires that the team looks into a new stadium, but only in the city limits, 
making it more difficult for the Raiders taking the stadium down. On July 
29, 2014, Raiders owner Mark Davis met with officials with the city of 
San Antonio to discuss moving the Raiders to the city in time for the 2015 
season; they would temporarily play home games at the Alamodome until a 
new permanent stadium is built. On August 6, 2014, the A's have begun talks 
with an architect to build a baseball-only stadium at the Coliseum site, 
according to Wolff.[38] On September 3, 2014, the city of Oakland claimed 
it had reached a tentative deal to build a new football stadium in Oakland, 
which would result in the Coliseum being demolished. The claim was met 
with silence from the Raiders, who continued to explore San Antonio, and 
opposition from Alameda County.[39] On February 19, 2015, the Raiders and 
the San Diego Chargers announced plans for a privately financed $1.7 billion 
stadium that the two teams would build in Carson, California if they were 
to move to the Los Angeles market.[40] Both teams stated that they would 
continue to attempt to get stadiums built in their respective cities.[41] 
On April 22, 2015, the Carson City Council bypassed the option to put the 
stadium to public vote and approved the plan 3–0.[42] The council voted 
without having clarified several issues, including who would finance the 
stadium, how the required three-way land swap would be performed, and how 
it would raise enough revenue if only one team moved in as tenant.[43] 
On October 5, 2015, the United States Supreme Court rejected San Jose's 
bid on the Athletics.[44] In January 2016, Mark Davis met with Las Vegas 
Sands owner Sheldon Adelson about building a domed stadium on the UNLV 
campus for the Raiders and the UNLV Rebels.[45] In recent years, the Coliseum 
has been criticized as being one of the "worst stadiums in baseball".[46] 
Problems cited include the large amount of foul territory and the addition 
of Mount Davis. The former allows for more foul-outs while the latter has 
been criticized for "ruining" the ambience of the original configuration. 
One feature of the 1996 expansion was the addition of over 10,000 seats 
in the upper deck that now spans the outfield in the baseball configuration. 
The effect of these new stands, comprising sections 335–355, was to completely 
enclose the stadium, eliminating the view of the bucolic Oakland hills 
that had been the stadium's backdrop for 30 years. The stands are very 
narrow and steeply pitched, bringing the back row of its uppermost tier 
to a height rarely seen in modern stadiums. Due to the stands' height and 
the loss of the Oakland hills view, A's fans have derisively nicknamed 
the structure "Mount Davis", after late Raiders owner Al Davis. It has 
been criticized as an area which has made the Oakland Coliseum look ever 
more like a football stadium, and not at all one for baseball.[47] From 
1997 through 2004, the A's left the section open, but it was rarely filled 
except for fireworks nights and the postseason. The A's did not count the 
area in the listed capacity for baseball; hence, even though the "official" 
baseball capacity was 43,662 (48,219 with standing room), the "actual" 
capacity was 55,945[2] (approximately 60,000 with standing room). In 2006, 
the Athletics covered the entire third deck with a tarp, reducing capacity 
to 34,077—the smallest capacity in the majors. For the 2008 season, Sections 
316–318 of the 3rd deck behind home plate were re-opened as the A's introduced 
their own all-you-can-eat seating area, similar to the right-field bleachers 
at Dodger Stadium. This has increased the Coliseum's capacity for baseball 
to 35,067.[48] For the 2009 season, seats were $35 and only sold on a single 
game basis; all-you-can-eat seating was offered for every game in 2008, 
but for 2009 the section was only open for weekend games (Friday-Sunday) 
and all games against the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, and San Francisco 
Giants. For 2010, the A's discontinued all-you-can-eat, instead rebranding 
the area as the "Value Deck". Prices for these seats have decreased to 
a starting price of $12 and are sold for every game (individual game prices 
vary due to the implementation of Dynamic Pricing as of 2012). To help 
compensate for the loss of all-you-can-eat, the A's have introduced Jumbo-Tickets 
that have stored stadium credit for food & merchandise ($10 on Plaza Club 
tickets & $6 for Value Deck tickets).[49] Even if the game is otherwise 
sold out, the A's will not sell any seats in the area that remains covered 
except if they make the World Series. The A's say that closing off the 
upper deck will create a "more intimate environment" for baseball. This 
has drawn criticism from fans, the Oakland City Council, and sports marketing 
analysts baffled at owner Lew Wolff's decision, with some stating that 
this is cover for a possible move to San Jose (see Cisco Field). There 
are 20,878 seats covered up by the tarp which would otherwise be usable 
for baseball.[2] However, in the 2013 ALDS, the tarp was removed from the 
original third deck, though Mount Davis remained covered. The attendance 
for the first game of the ALDS was 48,401, the highest since 2004.[50] 
On February 2013, the Oakland Raiders announced that they would cover 11,000 
seats in the Mount Davis section with a tarp to avoid blackouts. This reduces 
capacity to 53,250, by far the smallest in the NFL (league rules require 
a minimum capacity of 50,000, and no other stadium seats fewer than 61,000). 
Under NFL rules, the tarps have to stay in place throughout the season, 
even if the Raiders make the playoffs.[51] However, if the Raiders ever 
host the AFC Championship Game, the Coliseum can easily be expanded to 
full capacity; the Arizona Cardinals were allowed to expand University 
of Phoenix Stadium to 72,000 seats when they hosted the 2008-09 NFC Championship 
Game. On June 16, 2013 following the game against the Seattle Mariners, 
the Coliseum experienced a severe sewage backup. This led to pipes leaking 
out puddles of sewage into the showers, offices, visitor training room 
and storage areas on the clubhouse level of the stadium, all of which are 
3 feet (1 m) below sea level. After the game, the A's and Mariners were 
forced to share the Oakland Raiders locker room, located on the stadium's 
second floor. According to Coliseum officials, the stadium's aging plumbing 
system was overtaxed after a six-game homestand that drew close to baseball 
capacity crowds totaling 171,756 fans.[52] This was not the first time 
sewage problems cropped up at the stadium. For instance, on one occasion 
the Angels complained about E. coli in the visiting team's training room 
after a backup. Backups occur even when no events are taking place there.[53] 
For instance, Wolff wanted to go to dinner on June 12, 2013 (while the 
A's were on the road) at one of the Coliseum's restaurants, only to find 
out that food service had been halted due to a sewage leak in the kitchen.[54]
