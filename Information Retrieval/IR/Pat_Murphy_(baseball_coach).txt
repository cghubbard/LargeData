As coach As interim manager Patrick T. Murphy (born November 28, 1958) 
is an American baseball coach and manager. He is currently the bench coach 
for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball. He previously served 
as the interim manager of the San Diego Padres and as the head coach for 
the college baseball teams representing Arizona State University and the 
University of Notre Dame. Murphy played baseball at Florida Atlantic University 
where he played catcher and infield and pitched. He was honored on FAU's 
20th Anniversary Team as a pitcher and utility player and in 2008 was inducted 
into the school's Baseball Hall of Fame. Murphy signed a professional baseball 
contract with the San Francisco Giants in 1982 and had a four-year career 
with the Giants, San Diego Padres and two independent clubs before beginning 
his coaching career. Murphy was hired by the University of Notre Dame as 
the head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team on July 11, 
1987.[1] Murphy guided the Fighting Irish to a 318–116–1 (.732) record 
in South Bend, including consecutive trips to NCAA regional finals in 1992, 
1993 and 1994. Murphy was hired by Arizona State University as the head 
coach of the Arizona State Sun Devils baseball team in 1995. The Sun Devils 
won the Pac-10 Conference championship in 2000 and consecutive Pac-10 championships 
in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Twice in that same decade, Murphy had teams finish 
in the Top 3 in the country; a feat matched by only ten other schools. 
Murphy's ASU teams were consistently present in the national Top 25, including 
a streak of 100 consecutive weeks in the polls that lasted from 2000 until 
the middle of 2005. Murphy led the Sun Devils to the postseason for nine 
straight seasons and 11 of 12. His teams set an NCAA record of not being 
shut out in 506 consecutive games between 1995 and 2004, shattering the 
previous streak of 349.[2] Murphy is the youngest collegiate coach to reach 
500 career victories.[when?][citation needed] In 1998, he won Baseball 
America's Coach of the Year award and was Pac-10 Coach of the Year four 
times (2000, 2007, 2008 and 2009). He led ASU to the College World Series 
four times (1998, 2005, 2007, 2009). On November 20, 2009; Murphy resigned 
while the Arizona State baseball program was under investigation. It was 
initially reported that the resignation was his own decision. However, 
in December 2009, The Arizona Republic reported that on the day of his 
resignation, Murphy had been given an ultimatum--resign or be fired.[3] 
The NCAA's investigation found Murphy innocent of violations regarding 
student-athlete employment and recruiting, reprimanding him solely for 
treating investigators with a "cavalier attitude". The Arizona State Athletics 
Department was faulted for Lack of Institutional Control, however, subsequently 
resulting in the baseball program being sanctioned and banned from postseason 
play in the 2012 season, as the ASU Athletic Department was a repeat offender.[4] 
Murphy's career record at ASU was 629–284–1. In February 2010, Murphy was 
hired by the San Diego Padres as Special Assistant to Baseball Operations.[5] 
Murphy skippered the Padres' Northwest League affiliate, the Eugene Emeralds, 
as their manager for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, as the Emeralds had consecutive 
league-best overall season records.[6] While in Eugene, Coach Murphy compiled 
a 93–47 record (.664 pct). Murphy managed the Tucson Padres of the Class 
AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 2013 and the El Paso Chihuahuas of the 
PCL in 2014 and 2015. In 2015, the Milwaukee Brewers wanted to hire Murphy 
as a major league coach on Craig Counsell's coaching staff; Murphy coached 
Counsell at Notre Dame. The Padres refused to allow him to join the Brewers, 
even though it would constitute a promotion.[7] On June 16, 2015, Murphy 
was appointed the interim manager of the San Diego Padres after then-manager 
Bud Black was fired.[8] Immediately after the 2015 season, the Padres announced 
that Murphy would not return as manager.[9] In late October of 2015, Murphy 
was hired as bench coach for the Milwaukee Brewers as part of manager Craig 
Counsell's makeover of the team's coaching staff.       National champion
