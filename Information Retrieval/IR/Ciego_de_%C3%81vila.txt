Ciego de Ávila (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsjeɣo ðe ˈaβila]) is a city in 
the central part of Cuba and the capital of Ciego de Ávila Province. The 
city has a population of about 86,100. Ciego de Ávila lies on the Carretera 
Central highway and on a major railroad. Its port, Júcaro, lies 24 km (15 mi) 
south-southwest on the coast of the Gulf of Ana Maria in the Caribbean 
Sea. The city is located about 460 km (290 mi) east of Havana and 110 km 
(68 mi) west of the city of Camagüey. It was part of the Camagüey Province 
until 1976, when Fidel Castro's government made Ciego de Ávila the capital 
of the newly created Ciego de Ávila Province. By 1945, the municipality 
was divided into the barrios of Angel Castillo, Ceballos, Guanales, Jagüeyal, 
Jicotea, José Miguel Gómez, Júcaro, La Ceiba, Majagua, Norte, San Nicolás 
and Sur. After the new political and administrative division of Cuba in 
1976, it was divided into four municipalities (Majagua, Ciego de Ávila, 
Baragua, and Venezuela).[1] The city of Ciego de Ávila was founded by 1840, 
having at the time 263 inhabitants. In 1877, its municipal government was 
created and the city became independent of the city of Morón. Ciego de 
Ávila gained importance when the Spanish army built a fortified military 
line, known as Trocha de Júcaro a Morón, to impede the pass of insurrectionist 
forces to the western part of the island during the 1st War of Independence 
(1868–1878). This "trocha", which made this region famous, was thought 
to be strong enough to stop the Cuban forces, but was not able to stop 
the pass of General Máximo Gómez and several hundred men. Many of the old 
Spanish colonial buildings in Ciego de Ávila (such as the Teatro Principal) 
were commissioned under Angela Hernández, viuda de Jiménez, a rich socialite 
who battled to create a cultural mecca in her hometown. In 2004, the municipality 
of Ciego de Ávila had a population of 135,736.[3] With a total area of 
445 km2 (172 sq mi),[2] it has a population density of 305.0/km2 (790/sq mi). 
Its present radio station, Radio Surco (previously Radio Cuba) was founded
