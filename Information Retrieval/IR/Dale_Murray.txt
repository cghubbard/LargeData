Dale Albert Murray (born February 2, 1950) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher. He was drafted by the Montreal Expos out of Blinn College in Brenham, 
Texas in the eighteenth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, 
and developed into one of the top relief pitchers in the National League 
in the mid 70s.[1] Murray was used primarily in relief in Montreal's farm 
system. After going 11–5 with a 2.42 earned run average and eight saves 
in 1972 for the Eastern League's Quebec Carnavals, the Expos experimented 
with Murray as a starter. His record fell to 8–13 with a 4.26 ERA in 1973 
for triple A Peninsula, and the idea was abandoned. He made his major league 
debut in 1974 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching three innings, 
and giving up one earned run.[2] Though he started the season with the 
Memphis Blues of the International League, he emerged as the top pitcher 
in Montreal's bullpen by the end of the season, earning ten saves in the 
month of September while giving up just one earned run in 33 innings pitched. 
For the season, he was 1–1 with a 1.03 ERA. The Montreal Expos won just 
75 games to finish fifth in the National League East in 1975. Murray led 
the team with fifteen wins, and had ten saves, giving him a hand in one-third 
of the team's victories. He made a National League leading 81 relief appearances 
for the Expos in 1976. Following the season, Murray and Woodie Fryman were 
dealt to the World Series Champion Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Tony 
Pérez and Will McEnaney.[3] 1977 was a typical season for Cincinnati's 
offense. George Foster had an MVP season, leading the major leagues with 
52 home runs and 149 runs batted in. Perennial All-Star Johnny Bench also 
drove in over 100 runs, while Joe Morgan scored over 100 runs. Pete Rose 
batted over .300, as did Pérez's replacement at first base, Dan Driessen. 
Unfortunately, the wheels fell off the "Big Red Machine's" pitching staff. 
The Reds ended the season with a 4.21 team ERA – third highest in the NL. 
The Los Angeles Dodgers, meanwhile, had a league leading 3.22 staff ERA 
to take the division by ten games over the Reds. Murray finished with a 
7–2 record and 4.94 ERA his first season in Cincinnati. With the starting 
rotation depleted, he made his one and only career start on July 28 against 
the Chicago Cubs. He pitched a little over an inning, giving up six earned 
runs.[4] A month into the 1978 season, he was dealt to the New York Mets 
for Ken Henderson. Murray was tagged for five earned runs against the Philadelphia 
Phillies to take the loss in his first game as a Met.[5] From there, Murray 
turned things around, going 8–4 with a 3.20 ERA the rest of the way for 
the last place club. In August 1979, Murray's contract was sold to the 
Montreal Expos. Despite not finishing the season in New York, he led the 
Mets' bullpen with 58 appearances. The Expos were in a tight division race 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates when they purchased Murray's contract from 
the Mets just before the 1979 post-season roster deadline. Murray pitched 
well upon his return to Montreal, going 1–2 with a 2.70 ERA, however, the 
lone home run he gave up was an extra innings shot by Willie Stargell, 
which gave the Pirates a two-game lead in the division that they maintained 
for the rest of the season.[6] Murray split the 1980 season between the 
Expos and their triple A farm team, the Denver Bears. On August 28, roughly 
a year after purchasing his contract, the Expos released Murray with a 
0–1 record and 6.14 ERA at the major league level. In January 1981, Murray 
signed a minor league contract with an invitation to Spring training with 
the Toronto Blue Jays.[7] He began the season in triple A, but after tearing 
up the International League with a 1.85 ERA and sixteen saves for the Syracuse 
Chiefs, he earned a September call-up to the big league club. He was just 
as effective with the Jays, going 1–0 with a 1.17 ERA. Murray went 8–7 
with a 3.16 ERA and a team leading eleven saves for the Blue Jays in 1982. 
His eleven saves were also a his highest season total since 1976. Following 
the season, he was dealt to the New York Yankees with Tom Dodd for Dave 
Collins, Fred McGriff and Mike Morgan. Third baseman Graig Nettles was 
also supposed to be included in the deal, but when the Jays refused to 
give him a hefty bonus, the Yankees included cash in the deal to compensate.[8] 
Murray went 3–6 with a 4.58 ERA in his first two seasons as a Yankee. After 
giving up three earned runs with just two innings pitched in April 1985, 
the Yanks released him. He signed with the Texas Rangers shortly afterwards, 
but made just one appearance with the club. After finishing out the season 
with their triple A affiliate, the Oklahoma City 89ers, Murray retired. 
Murray made only 79 plate appearances in his career, and had a career .077 
batting average. His only career RBI came as a member of the Expos on September 
1, 1975. His two out single drove in the deciding run in the Expos' 6–5
