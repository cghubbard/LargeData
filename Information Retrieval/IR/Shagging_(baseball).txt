In baseball, shagging is the act of catching fly balls in the outfield 
outside the context of an actual baseball game.[1] This is most commonly 
done by pitchers during batting practice before a game,[2] where they assist 
their hitting teammates by catching or picking up their batted baseballs 
and throwing them back to the pitching area in the infield. Batboys also 
help shagging baseballs, and it is reportedly considered a great honor 
among batboys to be asked to do this.[3] This pre-game activity is widely 
disliked by pitchers,[4][5] who argue that it does not benefit them at 
all, since it drains their energy[5] and actually increases the risk of 
stiffness in the lower back and leg as a result of prolonged standing.[6] 
In response to these claims, several teams have exempted pitchers from 
having to shag fly balls. In the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league, 
teams pay groups specifically assembled to shag fly balls in place of pitchers,[5] 
and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim recruit local firefighters in Arizona 
to do the job when the team plays in the Cactus League during spring training.[6] 
Although shagging baseballs is not considered to be dangerous,[7][8] several 
freak injuries have occurred as a result of engaging in it. In 1943, just 
one season after collecting his 3,000 hit, Paul Waner accidentally gashed 
his foot while shagging a fly ball in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
his former team.[9] This was probably due to Waner being nearsighted and 
his refusal to wear glasses;[10] thus, he "played the outfield by ear."[9] 
Nearly four decades later, Jerry Reuss was handed the honor of pitching 
on Opening Day in 1981, but suffered an injury to his calf while shagging 
baseballs for his teammates. He was replaced by unheralded rookie Fernando 
Valenzuela, who went on to win his next 8 consecutive decisions.[11] Other 
players who have suffered serious injuries due to shagging baseballs include 
Mark Fidrych and Brendan Donnelly. Fidrych suffered a left knee injury 
after tearing cartilage in 1977 spring training,[12] starting a downward 
spiral in his career.[13] Donnelly ended up breaking his nose while shagging 
baseballs, resulting in him losing half of his blood and necessitating 
three operations.[14] Mariano Rivera, the all-time leader in saves, suffered 
arguably the most well-known injury from shagging baseballs on May 3, 2012. 
While helping out in pre-game batting practice, Rivera attempted to catch 
a fly ball from Jayson Nix when he twisted his knee on the warning track 
of Kauffman Stadium and fell to the ground. An MRI scan revealed he had 
torn his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and part of his meniscus.[15] 
This prematurely ended his season[16] and led to fears that this could 
potentially be a career-ending injury.[15][17] Rivera was able to come 
back and pitch for the 2013 season, his final season in the major leagues 
before retiring.[18] Despite the seriousness of Rivera's injuries, pitchers 
from across Major League Baseball (MLB) who engaged in shagging fly balls 
during batting practice said they would not drop the activity or modify 
their training routine. These included James Shields[19] and J. J. Putz,[20] 
along with 2012 Cy Young Award winners[21] R.A. Dickey[22] and David Price.[19] 
Furthermore, several MLB managers at the time—namely Dale Sveum,[23] Joe 
Maddon,[19] Jim Leyland and Terry Collins[22]—confirmed they would not
