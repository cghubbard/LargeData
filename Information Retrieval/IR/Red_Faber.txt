Urban Clarence "Red" Faber (September 6, 1888 – September 25, 1976) was 
an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1914 through 
1933, playing his entire career for the Chicago White Sox. He was a member 
of the 1919 team but was not involved in the Black Sox scandal because 
he missed the World Series due to injury and illness. Faber won 254 games 
over his 20-year career, a total which ranked 17th-highest in history upon 
his retirement. At the time of his retirement, he was the last legal spitballer 
in the American League; another legal spitballer, Burleigh Grimes, would 
later be traded to the AL and appear in 10 games for the Yankees in 1934.[1] 
He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964. Faber was born 
on a farm near Cascade, Iowa, on September 6, 1888. He was of Luxembourgish 
ancestry. While Faber was a child, his father managed a tavern and later 
ran the Hotel Faber in Cascade. His father became one of the wealthiest 
citizens in Cascade. As a teenager, Faber attended college prep academies 
in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin and Dubuque, Iowa. By the age of 16, Faber 
was receiving $2 to pitch Sunday games with a local baseball team in Dubuque.[2] 
In 1909, Faber pitched a season for St. Joseph's College, later known as 
Loras College. In a game against St. Ambrose University that year, he set 
a school record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game (24).[3] Former Dubuque 
minor league owner Clarence "Pants" Rowland encouraged Faber to sign with 
the Class B Dubuque Miners of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League.[2] Faber 
started well in the minor leagues. He pitched 15 games for Dubuque in 1909 
and returned to the team in 1910, registering an 18-19 win-loss record 
and a 2.37 earned run average (ERA) in 44 games. He threw a perfect game 
for the Dubs against the Davenport Prodigals in September of that season.[4] 
He also spent time with minor league clubs in Pueblo and Des Moines. He 
broke into the major leagues in 1914, starting 19 games and relieving in 
another 21; he posted a 2.68 ERA while winning 10 games and saving a league-leading 
four games. Through the 1910s, he would vary between starting and relieving 
for a team which enjoyed a wealth of pitching talent. In his 1915 season, 
he won 24 games to tie for second in the American League behind Walter 
Johnson, and he led the league with 50 appearances. In one game that season, 
he pitched a three-hitter with only 67 pitches. In 1917 he had a record 
of 16–13, and at one point started – and won – three games in two days. 
He saved his best work for the World Series against the New York Giants. 
After winning Game 2 in Chicago but losing Game 4 on the road, he came 
into Game 5 (at home) in relief and picked up the win as the Sox came back 
from a 5-2 deficit in the seventh inning to win 8-5. Faber came back two 
days later to go the distance in the clinching Game 6 at the Polo Grounds, 
picking up his third win of the Series by a 4–2 score. As a consequence, 
he holds the all-time American League record for pitching decisions in 
a single World Series with four, a record which stands to this day. His 
pitching was better than his baserunning—in one game he tried to steal 
third base when it was already occupied. Faber said that he saw the lead 
runner rounding third base on the previous play and he thought that the 
runner had scored a run. When the pitcher slowly entered his windup, Faber 
ran toward third base.[5] However, in one game against Boston, he stole 
home, a rare feat for a pitcher. After spending most of 1918 in the United 
States Navy due to World War I, he returned in 1919 only to develop arm 
trouble.[6] He had lost a significant amount of weight during the war.[7] 
He finished the year with a 3.83 ERA – the only time in his first nine 
seasons he posted a mark over 3.00. Those problems, along with a case of 
the flu possibly related to the Spanish Flu pandemic, prevented him from 
playing in the scandal-torn World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Years 
later, catcher Ray Schalk said that had Faber been available, there probably 
would never have been a fix (presumably because Faber would have gotten 
some of the starts that went to Eddie Cicotte and/or Lefty Williams).[8] 
Faber enjoyed the greatest success of his career in the early 1920s. The 
live-ball era was beginning, but he was among the pitchers who made the 
most successful transition. The spitball was phased out after the 1920 
season, with Faber one of the 17 pitchers permitted to use it for the remainder 
of their careers. He took advantage of Comiskey Park's spacious dimensions, 
surrendering only 91 home runs—barely one homer per month—from 1920 to 
1931. He was one of only six pitchers to win 100 or more games in both 
the "dead ball" (through 1920) and live ball eras. Faber finished the 1920 
season with 23 wins and led the league in games started. During the summer 
of 1921, Faber and several other players had to leave a road trip in Washington 
after receiving subpoenas for the Black Sox trial in Chicago. Faber made 
the trip but was not asked to testify and he returned to the White Sox 
without missing a start.[9] In 1921 and 1922, he posted win totals of 25 
and 21, respectively, leading the league in ERA (1921–1922), innings (1922) 
and complete games (1921–1922). He was also among the league leaders in 
strikeouts each year, while pitching at least 25 complete games and over 
300 innings. In the wake of the Black Sox scandal, winning on a consistent 
basis became increasingly difficult. After being one of the top teams in 
the league with a powerful offense in the late 1910s, the White Sox had 
only two winning seasons in his last 13 years, never finishing above fifth 
place. In the 1921 season, he earned a 25-15 win-loss record for the post-scandal 
team that limped to a 62-92 finish; from 1921 to 1929 his record was 126-103. 
In 1927, Ty Cobb had a 21-game hitting streak which was broken when he 
faced Faber.[10] Despite the widespread hitting of the era, he did not 
post an ERA over 3.88 until he was 41. Perhaps his last great performance 
was a one-hitter at age 40 in 1929. In his last few seasons, Faber returned 
to relief pitching, coming out of the bullpen 96 times between 1931 and 
1933.[11] Faber announced his retirement before the 1934 season. He had 
pitched 20 consecutive years for the White Sox.[12] He ended his career 
at age 45 with a 254-213 career record, a 3.15 ERA and 1471 strikeouts. 
He holds the White Sox franchise record for most games pitched, and held 
the team records for career wins, starts, complete games and innings until 
they were later broken by Ted Lyons. After retiring as a player, Faber 
entered auto sales and real estate. He returned as a White Sox coach for 
three seasons.[11] In 1947, Faber married Frances (Fran) Knudtzon, who 
was nearly 30 years younger than he was. Faber said that he was too old 
for Fran, but she insisted that they should get married. The marriage was 
not popular among Faber's Catholic family; Fran was Lutheran and a divorcee, 
and the couple had married quickly. However, some of his family members 
became more accepting of Fran.[13] They had a son the next year, Urban 
C. Faber II, nicknamed "Pepper". When Pepper was 14, he suffered a broken 
neck in a near-fatal swimming accident, causing long-term health problems.[11] 
Faber helped to found Baseball Anonymous, a charitable organization that 
assisted former baseball players who had run into financial or physical 
problems, and he later worked on a Cook County highway surveying team until 
he was nearly 80. Faber was a longtime smoker and had suffered two heart 
attacks in the 1960s. He began to suffer from increasing heart and lung 
issues and died in Chicago in 1976. He was interred in Acacia Park Cemetery,
