In baseball, the dead-ball era was the period between around 1900 (though 
some date it to the beginning of baseball) and the emergence of Babe Ruth 
as a power hitter in 1919. That year, Ruth hit a then-league record 29 
home runs, a spectacular feat at that time. This era was characterized 
by low-scoring games and a lack of home runs. The lowest league run average 
in history was in 1908, when teams averaged only a combined 3.4 runs per 
game. During the dead-ball era, baseball was much more of a strategy-driven 
game, using a style of play now known as small ball or inside baseball. 
It relied much more on stolen bases and hit-and-run types of plays than 
on home runs.[1] These strategies emphasized speed, perhaps by necessity. 
Teams played in spacious ball parks that limited hitting for power, and, 
compared to modern baseballs, the ball used then was "dead" both by design 
and from overuse. Low-power hits like the Baltimore Chop, developed in 
the 1890s by the Baltimore Orioles, were used to get on base.[2] Once on 
base, a runner would often steal or be bunted over to second base and move 
to third base or score on a hit-and-run play. In no other era have teams 
stolen as many bases as in the dead-ball era. On 13 occasions between 1900 
and 1920, the league leader in home runs had fewer than 10 home runs for 
the season, as opposed to just 4 where the league leaders had 20 or more 
homers. Meanwhile, there were 20 instances where the league leader in triples 
had 20 or more. Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Owen "Chief" Wilson set a 
record of 36 triples in 1912, a little-known record that is likely one 
of baseball's unbreakable records, as is that of the 309 career triples 
of Sam Crawford set during this time.[3] Despite their speed, teams struggled 
to score during the dead-ball era. Major league cumulative batting averages 
ranged between .239 and .279 in the National League and between .239 and 
.283 in the American League. The lack of power in the game also meant lower 
slugging averages and on-base percentages, as pitchers could challenge 
hitters more without the threat of the long ball. The nadir of the dead-ball 
era was around 1907 and 1908, with a league-wide batting average of .239, 
slugging average of .306, and ERA under 2.40. In the latter year, the Chicago 
White Sox hit three home runs for the entire season, yet they finished 
88–64, just a couple of games from winning the pennant.[4] "This should 
prove that leather is mightier than wood".[5] Some players and fans complained 
about the low-scoring games, and baseball sought to remedy the situation. 
In 1909, Ben Shibe invented the cork-centered ball, which the Reach Company—official 
ball supplier to the American League (AL)—began marketing.[6] Spalding, 
who supplied the National League (NL), followed with its own cork-center 
ball. The change in the ball dramatically affected play in both leagues.[6] 
In 1910, the American League batting average was .243; in 1911, it rose 
to .273. The National League saw a jump in the league batting average from 
.256 in 1910 to .272 in 1912. 1911 happened to be the best season of Ty 
Cobb’s career; Cobb batted .420 with 248 hits. Joe Jackson hit .408 in 
1911, and the next year Cobb batted .410. These were the only .400 averages 
between 1902 and 1919. In 1913, however, pitchers started to regain control, 
helped by a serendipitous invention by minor league pitcher Russ Ford. 
Ford accidentally scuffed a baseball against a concrete wall, and after 
he threw it, noticed the pitch quickly dived as it reached the batter. 
The emery pitch was born. Soon pitchers not only had the dominating spitball; 
they had another pitch in their arsenal to control the batter, aided by 
the fact that the same ball was used throughout the game and almost never 
replaced. As play continued, the ball became increasingly scuffed. This 
made it harder to hit as it moved more during the pitch, and more difficult 
to see as it became dirtier. By 1914 run scoring was essentially back to 
the pre-1911 years and remained so until 1919.[7] Such a lack of power 
in the game led to one of the more unusual player nicknames in history. 
Frank Baker, one of the best players of the dead-ball era, earned the nickname 
of "Home Run" Baker merely for hitting two home runs in the 1911 World 
Series. Although Baker led the American League in home runs four times 
(1911–1914), his highest home run season was 1913, when he hit 12 home 
runs,[8] and he finished with 96 home runs for his career. The best homerun 
hitter of the dead-ball era was Philadelphia Phillies outfielder "Cactus" 
Gavvy Cravath. Cravath led the National League in home runs six times, 
with a high total of 24 for the pennant-winning Phillies in 1915 and seasons 
of 19 home runs each in 1913 and 1914. Cravath, however, was aided by batting 
in the Baker Bowl, a notoriously hitter-friendly park with only a short 
280-foot (85 m) distance from the plate to the right field wall. The following 
factors contributed to the dramatic decline in runs scored during the dead-ball 
era: The foul strike rule was a major rule change that, in just a few years, 
sent baseball from a high-scoring game to a game where scoring any runs 
was a struggle. Prior to this rule, foul balls did not count as strikes. 
Thus, a batter could foul off a countless number of pitches with no strikes 
counted against him—except for bunt attempts. This gave the batter an enormous 
advantage. In 1901, the National League adopted the foul strike rule, and 
the American League followed suit in 1903.[9] Before 1921, it was common 
for a baseball to be in play for over 100 pitches. Players used the same 
ball until it started to unravel. Early baseball leagues were very cost-conscious, 
so fans had to throw back balls that had been hit into the stands. The 
longer the ball was in play, the softer it became—and hitting a heavily 
used, softer ball for distance is much more difficult than hitting a new, 
harder one. The ball itself was softer to begin with, probably making home 
runs less likely. The ball was also hard to hit because pitchers could 
manipulate it before a pitch. For example, the spitball pitch was permitted 
in baseball until 1921. Pitchers often marked the ball, scuffed it, spat 
on it—anything they could to influence the ball's motion. This made the 
ball "dance" and curve much more than it does now, making it more difficult 
to hit. Tobacco juice was often added to the ball as well, which discolored 
it. This made the ball difficult to see, especially since baseball parks 
did not have lights until the late 1930s. This made both hitting and fielding 
more difficult. Many ballparks were large by modern standards, such as 
the West Side Grounds of the Chicago Cubs, which was 560 feet to the center 
field fence, and the Huntington Avenue Grounds of the Boston Red Sox, which 
was 635 feet to the center field fence. The dimensions of Braves Field 
prompted Ty Cobb to say that no one would ever hit the ball out of it. 
The dead-ball era ended suddenly. By 1921, offenses were scoring 40% more 
runs and hitting four times as many home runs as they had in 1918. The 
abruptness of this change causes widespread debate among baseball historians, 
with no consensus on its cause.[10][11] Six popular theories have been
