                    The San Jose Sharks are a professional ice hockey team 
based in San Jose, California. They are members of the Pacific Division 
of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). They play 
their home games at the SAP Center, known locally as the Shark Tank.[3] 
The Sharks were founded in 1991 and were the first NHL franchise based 
in the San Francisco Bay Area since the California Golden Seals relocated 
to Cleveland in 1976. They have won six division titles and one conference 
championship. The Oakland Coliseum Arena was home to the California Golden 
Seals of the NHL from 1967 to 1976. Gordon and George Gund III became minority 
owners of the Seals in 1974, and were instrumental in their move to Cleveland 
in 1976 and a 1978 merger with the Minnesota North Stars, which they purchased 
that year. They had long wanted to bring hockey back to the Bay Area, and 
asked the NHL for permission to move the North Stars there in the late 
1980s, but the League vetoed the proposed move. Meanwhile, a group led 
by former Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin was pushing the NHL to 
bring a team to San Jose, where a new arena was being built. Eventually, 
the League struck a compromise: the Gunds would sell their share of the 
North Stars to Baldwin's group, with the Gunds receiving an expansion team 
in the Bay Area to begin play in the 1991–92 season and being allowed to 
take a certain number of players from the North Stars to their new club.[4] 
In return, the North Stars would be allowed to participate as an equal 
partner in an expansion draft with the new Bay Area team. On May 5, 1990, 
the Gunds officially sold their share of the North Stars to Baldwin and 
were awarded a new team for the Bay Area, based in San Jose. Over 5,000 
potential names were submitted by mail for the new team. While the first-place 
finisher was "Blades," the Gunds were concerned about the name's potentially 
negative association with weapons, and went with the runner-up, "Sharks."[5] 
The name was said to have been inspired by the large number of sharks living 
in the Pacific Ocean. Seven varieties live there, and one area of water 
near the Bay Area is known as the "red triangle" because of its shark population. 
The team's first marketing head, Matt Levine, said of the new name, "Sharks 
are relentless, determined, swift, agile, bright and fearless. We plan 
to build an organization that has all those qualities."[6] For their first 
two seasons, the Sharks played at the Cow Palace in Daly City, just outside 
San Francisco, a facility that the NHL and the Seals had rejected in 1967. 
Pat Falloon was their first draft choice, and led the team in points during 
their first season. George Kingston was their first coach during their 
first two seasons.[7] Though the 1991–92 roster consisted primarily of 
NHL journeymen, minor leaguers and rookies, the Sharks had at least one 
notable player when they acquired 14-year veteran and former Norris Trophy-winning 
defenseman Doug Wilson from the Chicago Blackhawks on September 6, 1991. 
Wilson was named the team's first captain and All-Star representative in 
the inaugural season. However, the Sharks' first two seasons saw the typical 
struggles for an expansion team. The 71 losses in 1992–93 is an NHL record, 
and they also suffered a 17-game losing streak, while winning just 11 games 
and earning a mere 24 points in the standings. Kingston was fired following 
the end of the 1992–93 season.[7] Despite the Sharks' futility in the standings, 
the team led the NHL's merchandise sales with $150 million, accounting 
for 27% of the League's total and behind only National Basketball Association 
champions Chicago Bulls among all North American leagues.[8] Several team 
"firsts" happened in the 1992–93 season. On November 17, 1992, San Jose 
goaltender Arturs Irbe recorded the first shutout in team history, defeating 
the Los Angeles Kings 6–0. On December 3, against the Hartford Whalers 
at the Cow Palace, right winger Rob Gaudreau scored the first hat-trick 
in franchise history; he also scored the team's second ever hat-trick nine 
days later against the Quebec Nordiques. The early era also saw the birth 
of the San Jose Sharks long-time mascot, S. J. Sharkie. On January 28, 
1992, at a game vs. the New York Rangers, the then-unnamed mascot emerged 
from a Zamboni during an intermission. A "Name the Mascot" contest began 
that night, with the winning name of "S. J. Sharkie" being announced on 
April 15, 1992.[9] For their third season, 1993–94, the Sharks moved to 
their current home, the San Jose Arena (now the SAP Center at San Jose).[10] 
Under Head Coach Kevin Constantine, the Sharks pulled off the biggest turnaround 
in NHL history, finishing with a 33–35–16 record, making the playoffs with 
82 points — an NHL record 58-point jump from the previous season.[11] They 
were seeded eighth in the Western Conference playoffs and faced the Detroit 
Red Wings, the top-seeded Western Conference team and a favorite to win 
the Stanley Cup. In one of the biggest upsets in Stanley Cup playoff history, 
the underdog Sharks shocked the Red Wings in seven games. In Game 7 at 
Joe Louis Arena, Jamie Baker scored the game-winning goal in the third 
period after goaltender Chris Osgood was out of position and the Sharks 
won 3–2.[12] In the second round, the Sharks had a 3–2 series lead over 
the Toronto Maple Leafs, but lost the final two games in Toronto, including 
an overtime loss in Game 6. In 1994–95, the Sharks earned their second-straight 
playoff berth and again reached the second round. Ray Whitney scored a 
goal in double overtime of Game 7 of the Conference Quarter-finals against 
the Calgary Flames. Key Sharks players included goaltender Arturs Irbe, 
defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh and forwards Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov. 
Despite their success against Calgary, round two would prove to be a disaster 
for the Sharks, when they lost in a four-game sweep to Detroit (in a rematch 
of the previous year) without even holding a single lead in all four games. 
However, the 1995 season also saw the only rainout in the history of the 
NHL, when the Guadalupe River flooded its banks in March 1995, making it 
impossible for anyone to get into the San Jose Arena for a game between 
the Sharks and the Red Wings.[13] In 1995–96, the Sharks finished last 
in the Pacific Division and failed to make the playoffs. The team also 
underwent major changes: during the season they traded Ozolinsh and Larionov; 
Irbe, who had suffered an off-ice injury, was released at the end of the 
season. The team began rebuilding, acquiring forward Owen Nolan from the 
Colorado Avalanche, as well as several other players. Constantine was fired 
midway through the season and replaced by interim coach Jim Wiley. The 
next season was no better under Al Sims, with the Sharks again finishing 
last and winning only 27 games. Their standing would help them draft Patrick 
Marleau in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. The Sharks returned to the playoffs 
in 1997–98, with goalie Mike Vernon, whom they acquired from the Red Wings, 
and new head coach Darryl Sutter. For the next two years, the Sharks made 
the playoffs, yet never advanced past the first round. In 1999, San Jose 
acquired former Toronto and Montreal star Vincent Damphousse. San Jose's 
luck changed in the 1999–2000 season, when the Sharks finished with their 
first-ever winning record. In an upset on par with the one they had pulled 
on Detroit six years earlier, the Sharks managed to eliminate the St. Louis 
Blues, who had finished first overall in the league that year, in seven 
games. However, the Sharks were defeated in the second round of the playoffs 
by the Dallas Stars. It was their second time losing to Dallas. In 2000–01, 
Kazakh goaltender Evgeni Nabokov won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the 
League's best rookie. The team also acquired Finnish star forward Teemu 
Selanne from the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. In the 2001 playoffs, the St. 
Louis Blues eliminated the Sharks in six games in the first round, avenging 
their 2000 defeat by San Jose. The team's breakout year was 2001–02. Veteran 
Adam Graves was acquired for Mikael Samuelsson, and the Sharks won their 
first Pacific Division title. They then defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in 
the first round of the 2002 playoffs, but fell to the Colorado Avalanche 
in the second round. Following the 2001–02 season, the Gunds sold the Sharks 
to a group of local investors headed by team president Greg Jamison. With 
starting goaltender Nabokov and defenseman Mike Rathje in contract disputes 
with General Manager Dean Lombardi and the retirement of veteran defenseman 
Gary Suter, the team got off to a terrible start. Kyle McLaren was acquired 
in a three-way trade with the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins. Dan 
McGillis was acquired in exchange for long-time Shark Marcus Ragnarsson, 
but the team could not turn itself around. Sutter was fired and replaced 
by Ron Wilson midway through that season. Near the 2003 NHL trade deadline, 
captain Owen Nolan was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, signaling a new 
era in Sharks history. In addition, the newly acquired McGillis was traded 
to Boston, Bryan Marchment went to Colorado, and American Hockey League 
(AHL) star Shawn Heins and forward Matt Bradley were moved to Pittsburgh. 
The Sharks acquired Alyn McCauley and Wayne Primeau during this season. 
Reportedly, due to having just acquired the team as well as the team's 
bad start, the ownership group wanted GM Dean Lombardi to move high-priced 
players on the roster. Lombardi failed to do so, and as a result, lost 
his job. During that debacle year for San Jose, there were some bright 
spots. Jim Fahey led all rookie defensemen in the NHL in points, despite 
playing in only 43 games. 2003–04, under new General Manager Doug Wilson 
and Head Coach Ron Wilson saw another turnaround for the team, resulting 
in the team's best season to that point. An injection of youth, with players 
like Christian Ehrhoff and out-of-college signing Tom Preissing, and the 
influx of energy from Alexander Korolyuk jump-started San Jose. Doug Wilson 
acquired Nils Ekman, and a line of Ekman, McCauley and Korolyuk provided 
strong play for San Jose, with all three players enjoying career years. 
Midway through the season, key forward Marco Sturm suffered a broken leg/ankle 
injury. In response, San Jose acquired Curtis Brown. They posted the third-best 
record in the NHL with 104 points (31 more than the previous season, and 
the first time the team had earned 100 points), won the Pacific Division 
championship and were seeded second in the Western Conference. In the 2004 
playoffs, the Sharks defeated the St. Louis Blues in the Western Conference 
Quarter-finals and the Colorado Avalanche in the Conference Semi-finals. 
The San Jose Sharks, for the first time, progressed to the Conference Finals. 
However, they fell to the Calgary Flames, with ex-coach Daryl Sutter behind 
the Flames' bench and former Sharks goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff in net. 
During that season, San Jose, without a captain following Nolan's trade, 
utilized a rotating captaincy. When the job eventually fell to Patrick 
Marleau, he kept the captaincy. During the off-season, forward Vincent 
Damphousse was lost to the Colorado Avalanche (but never played a game 
for them, as he announced his retirement during the 2004–05 lockout). The 
Sharks started the 2005–06 season slowly, dropping to last place in the 
Pacific Division. The team lost Alexander Korolyuk. After a 10-game losing 
streak, the Sharks traded Brad Stuart, Wayne Primeau and Marco Sturm to 
the Boston Bruins in exchange for star player Joe Thornton. The trade re-energized 
the team, and with Nabokov sharing starting duties with backup goaltender 
Vesa Toskala, the Sharks rallied back from their early season slump to 
clinch the fifth seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, the Sharks 
defeated the Nashville Predators in the Conference Quarter-finals before 
falling to the Edmonton Oilers in the Conference Semi-finals. Joe Thornton 
was awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's Most Valuable Player, 
as well as the Art Ross Trophy for leading the League in points, with 125. 
Jonathan Cheechoo was awarded the Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy for scoring 
the most goals during the regular season, with a total of 56. The Sharks 
entered the 2006–07 season as the youngest team in average age, as well 
as the biggest team in average weight, and they raced out to a 20–7–0 start, 
the best in franchise history. A concern made by fans and members of the 
media was the lack of a left winger to play on a line with the duo of Thornton 
and Cheechoo. Wilson seemingly addressed this issue by acquiring 25-year-old 
20-goal-scorer Mark Bell from the Chicago Blackhawks. Despite scoring a 
goal in his first two games with San Jose, Bell was widely considered a 
flop in San Jose. Off-ice issues, including being cited for drunk driving 
and an alleged hit-and-run[14] contributed to his on-ice play. By the end 
of the season, Bell was consistently either a healthy scratch or a fourth-liner. 
Two significant trades were made at the trade deadline for defenseman Craig 
Rivet and winger Bill Guerin. The trades coincided with Nabokov putting 
together a string of outstanding performances. The Sharks finished the 
regular season with the best record in franchise history at 51–26–5. In 
the Conference Quarter-finals, the Sharks defeated the Nashville Predators 
for the second year in a row. In the Western Conference Semifinals, the 
Sharks were defeated for the second time by the Detroit Red Wings. In that 
off-season, San Jose lost defenseman Scott Hannan to the Colorado Avalanche, 
but managed to re-sign pending free agent Craig Rivet. They also added 
former League star Jeremy Roenick to the roster. Roenick had considered 
retirement but decided to give it one last try with San Jose. San Jose 
effectively made Nabokov their number one goaltender by trading Vesa Toskala 
and Mark Bell to the Toronto Maple Leafs. In advance of the 2007–08 season, 
the Sharks updated their logos and jerseys to adjust to the new Rbk EDGE 
jersey.[15] The Sharks rode on a very hot streak in the month of March. 
They were aided by the trade-deadline acquisition of Brian Campbell, for 
whom they gave up Steve Bernier. Going the entire month without a regulation 
loss, the Sharks captured their third Pacific Division title with a franchise-record 
108 points. San Jose started the 2008 playoffs beating the Calgary Flames 
four games to three in San Jose's first-ever Game 7 on home ice. San Jose 
eventually lost to the Dallas Stars in the Western Conference Semi-finals. 
Game 6 required four overtime periods, and was the longest game in the 
team's history. This was the Sharks third playoff loss to Dallas. The Ron 
Wilson era officially came to an end on May 12 when the Sharks fired him, 
citing the San Jose's disappointing second round losses in the previous 
three seasons.[16] Wilson ended his tenure in San Jose with an overall 
record of 206–134–45 in 385 regular-season games and a 28–24 record in 
52 post-season games. He moved on to be hired as head coach of the Toronto 
Maple Leafs, along with assistant coaches who were also two former Sharks, 
Tim Hunter and Rob Zettler, to make up the Toronto coaching staff. On June 
11, 2008, the San Jose Sharks named former Detroit Red Wings Assistant 
Coach Todd McLellan as their new head coach for the 2008–09 season. Todd 
Richards, Trent Yawney and Jay Woodcroft were named assistant coaches, 
while Brett Heimlich was named staff assistant. During the off-season, 
San Jose's major headlines included signing defenseman Rob Blake, acquiring 
defensemen Dan Boyle and Brad Lukowich, as well as trading defenseman Craig 
Rivet to the Buffalo Sabres. Midway through the season, San Jose added 
playoff warrior Claude Lemieux to their roster. Lemieux, 43 years old, 
was rejoining the NHL after a five-year absence. At the trade deadline, 
San Jose acquired checking-line winger Travis Moen and the injured defenseman 
Kent Huskins from the Anaheim Ducks. The Sharks finished the regular season 
as Presidents' Trophy champions with 53 wins and 117 points, both franchise 
records. Despite their successful regular season, the Sharks were eliminated 
by the eighth-seeded Anaheim Ducks in six games in the first round of the 
playoffs. The team was heavily criticized[by whom?] for once again failing 
to succeed in the post-season. General Manager Doug Wilson promised that 
the team would undergo significant changes in the off-season. In the 2009 
off-season, Wilson held to his word with many major moves. The first was 
Christian Ehrhoff and Brad Lukowich to the Vancouver Canucks. It was widely 
believed[by whom?] that San Jose made this trade so it could free up salary 
cap space to make a second trade: Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo 
were sent to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Dany Heatley and a draft 
pick. Assistant Coach Todd Richards left and was replaced by Matt Shaw. 
Aside from the trades, several contracts were not renewed, including those 
of Mike Grier, Marcel Goc, Tomas Plihal and Alexei Semenov. San Jose also 
signed forward Scott Nichol and added grit to the team by signing Joe Callahan, 
Jed Ortmeyer and Manny Malhotra, plus Benn Ferriero. Jeremy Roenick and 
Claude Lemieux both announced their retirements from the NHL. Another major 
move by San Jose was stripping Patrick Marleau of the captaincy and assigning 
it to the newly re-signed Rob Blake. One reason for the move was that Marleau 
was named captain by Wilson and McLellan wanted to name his own. Dan Boyle 
and Joe Thornton were named the alternates. On February 7, 2010, San Jose 
acquired Niclas Wallin from the Carolina Hurricanes. On February 12, 2010, 
San Jose traded Jody Shelley to the New York Rangers for a draft pick.[17] 
The Sharks finished the regular season leading the Western Conference with 
113 points and being the second team in the League after the Washington 
Capitals. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, the Sharks eliminated 
the Colorado Avalanche. In the Conference Semi-finals, the Sharks defeated 
the Detroit Red Wings. The eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago 
Blackhawks, beat the Sharks in the Conference Finals with a four-game sweep. 
On June 23, 2010, Wilson announced that they would not offer an unrestricted 
free agent contract to long-time goaltender Evgeni Nabokov after playing 
ten seasons with the team. Due to the cap issue, the Sharks had to choose 
between former captain Patrick Marleau and Nabokov. On July 1, 2010, the 
Sharks signed goalie Antero Niittymaki from the Tampa Bay Lightning.[18] 
On September 2, 2010, the Sharks signed former member of the Chicago Blackhawks 
and Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Antti Niemi to a one-year contract.[19] 
Niemi was the goaltender who helped the Blackhawks defeat the Sharks in 
the Western Conference Finals the season before.[20] On March 1, 2011, 
Niemi signed a four-year contract extension with San Jose worth $15.2 million.[20] 
On March 31, 2011, the Sharks clinched their 13th (and seventh consecutive) 
playoff berth in franchise history with a 6–0 victory over the Dallas Stars. 
Five days later, they clinched their sixth Pacific Division championship. 
Entering the 2011 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference, 
the Sharks opened their playoff run with the franchise's first-ever playoff 
series against division and state rivals Los Angeles. After winning Game 
1, 3–2 in overtime on a Joe Pavelski goal, the Sharks dropped the second 
game of the series 4–0, heading to Staples Center with the series tied 
at one apiece. The Kings took another 4–0 lead in Game 3 but five second-period 
goals by the Sharks capped with a Devin Setoguchi overtime winner gave 
the Sharks a 6–5 victory and tied them for the second-biggest comeback 
in Stanley Cup playoff history. They would go on to win Game 4, lose Game 
5 and finally win the series in its sixth game, with captain Joe Thornton 
scoring the series winner in the third overtime game of the series. The 
Sharks advanced to the Western Conference Semi-finals to face the third-seed 
Detroit Red Wings, whom they had defeated in five games during the previous 
post-season's second round. Just like the year prior, the Sharks won the 
first three games of the series and lost the fourth but instead of replicating 
the previous year's success in Game 5, the Sharks dropped two more games 
as the Red Wings became the eighth team in NHL history to force a Game 
7 after losing the first three games of a series. However, they would not 
become the 4th team in history to pull off the comeback as the Sharks prevailed, 
3–2, with the game-winning goal scored by former captain Patrick Marleau 
who had endured media criticism from former teammate and now NBC Sports 
Network television personality Jeremy Roenick for his lackluster play in 
Game 5 of the series against the Red Wings. The Sharks advanced to their 
third Western Conference Finals series, their first playoff meeting with 
the Vancouver Canucks. San Jose dropped the first two games of the series 
at Rogers Arena in Vancouver but rebounded with a 4–3 victory thanks to 
two first-period goals by Marleau in Game 3. However, they lost the fourth 
game of the series and eventually were eliminated from the playoffs after 
a Game 5 in Vancouver that featured a game-tying goal by the Canucks' Ryan 
Kesler with 18.3 seconds remaining in the third period as well as a quirky 
bounce off a side stanchion that allowed Kevin Bieksa to score the overtime 
goal that advanced Vancouver to their third Stanley Cup Finals and left 
the Sharks knocked out in Round 3 for the second consecutive post-season. 
The first major move made by San Jose in the 2011 off-season was to trade 
popular winger (and former first-round pick) Devin Setoguchi, the Sharks' 
2010 first-round pick Charlie Coyle and a first-round pick in the 2011 
NHL Draft to the Minnesota Wild for All-Star defenseman Brent Burns and 
a second-round pick in the 2012 Draft.[21][22] This came after Setoguchi 
had signed a three-year, nine million-dollar contract extension with the 
Sharks. The Sharks continued their off-season retool by orchestrating a 
second transaction with the Wild, shipping Dany Heatley to Minnesota in 
exchange for Martin Havlat,[23] both to relieve cap space as Heatley was 
slated to carry a cap hit $2.5 million greater than Havlat's for the duration 
of their respective contracts and to acquire a player in Havlat with a 
history of playoff production at the expense of Heatley, whose post-season 
numbers with the Sharks had been far less than stellar — the forward had 
managed to score just five goals in 32 playoff games in two years with 
San Jose. The Sharks finished the 2011–12 season with a 43–29–10 record, 
good for 96 points and the seventh seed in the Stanley Cup playoffs. However, 
after winning Game 1 of their first round series with the St. Louis Blues 
in overtime, they lost the final four games of the series, marking the 
second time they lost in the Quarter-finals under Todd McLellan. Despite 
the underachievement[according to whom?] of the previous year, it was announced 
that McLellan would remain on the bench for a fifth season. Prior to the 
lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Hockey Hall of Fame player and coach 
Larry Robinson was added to McLellan's coaching staff to assist with San 
Jose's penalty-killing unit, which was 29th in the NHL during the previous 
season. Assistant Coach Jim Johnson was also added to bring a defensive 
style to the play of the Sharks. Brett Heimlich was also promoted to the 
role of video coordinator to assist the new coaching staff. Along with 
the two coaches, veteran defenseman Brad Stuart was re-acquired in order 
to bolster the Sharks' blue line, and on January 12, he played in his first 
game at HP Pavilion in over seven years. In the first round of the 2013 
playoffs, the Sharks swept the Vancouver Canucks, their first series-sweep 
in franchise history.[24] The Sharks would subsequently fall 4–3 to the 
defending Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings in the second round of 
the playoffs. Prior to the 2013–14 season, the Sharks unveiled new uniforms, 
which included a lower amount of orange, along with adding lacing to the 
jerseys.[25] In addition to the new uniforms, prior to the start of the 
season, Brett Heimlich took on the additional role of statistical analyst 
for the coaching staff. The Sharks started the season 8–0–1, and were the 
last team in the NHL to stay undefeated in regulation[26] until October 
25, when the Sharks lost to the Boston Bruins.[27] In the first round of 
the 2014 playoffs, the Sharks lost to the Kings in seven games after winning 
the first three games (only the fourth time in the 97-year history of the 
NHL where a team lost a best-of-seven series after winning their first 
three games). After the loss, GM Doug Wilson described the Sharks' playoff 
failures "like Charlie Brown trying to kick a football." On August 20, 
2014, head coach Todd McLellan announced that the team would go into training 
camp for the 2014–15 season without having a captain, and that all players 
(including former captains Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau) would have 
the opportunity to compete for the captaincy.[28] No captain was named 
during the season. The Sharks hosted the 2015 NHL Stadium Series against 
the Kings at Levi's Stadium in February 2015, losing the game 2-1. Earlier 
in the season, the Sharks were in playoff contention, but they would ultimately 
lose games to key Western Conference opponents as the season went on. Despite 
posting a record of 40-33-9, the Sharks finished fifth in the Pacific Division 
and missed the playoffs for the first time in ten years. On April 20, 2015, 
the team announced that they had agreed to "part ways" with McLellan, Johnson 
and Woodcroft, as well as Video Coordinator Heimlich.[29] On May 28, 2015, 
the team named Peter DeBoer as their new head coach.[30] During the off-season, 
the Sharks let John Scott and Scott Hannan leave as free agents.[31] They 
traded goalie Antti Niemi to the Dallas Stars for a 7th round 2015 draft 
pick.[32] Then, they acquired forward Joel Ward,[33] goalie Martin Jones,[34] 
and defenseman Paul Martin.[35] They also named forward Joe Pavelski the 
team's captain. Nearly a year after Peter DeBoer's arrival and a shaky 
start, the Sharks surged in the second half of the season to return to 
the playoffs, finishing with 98 points and third in the Pacific divison. 
They defeated the Kings in 5 games, defeated the Nashville Predators in 
7 games, and went on to defeat the St. Louis Blues 5–2 in game 6 to win 
the Western Conference championship. This marked the first time in franchise 
history that the Sharks have advanced to play in the Stanley Cup Final.[36][37] 
The Sharks ultimately lost the Stanley Cup Finals in the best-of-seven 
series against the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games.[38] The Sharks' best-known 
tradition is their pre-game entrance scene. At the beginning of each Sharks 
home game, the lights go down and a 17-foot open shark mouth is lowered 
from the rafters. As the mouth is lowered the eyes flash red and fog pours 
out. Then, a live view of the locker room tunnel with Sharks players is 
shown on the scoreboard and the goalie leads the team out of the locker 
room, through the mouth, and onto the ice.[39] The Sharks currently use 
"Seek & Destroy" by Metallica as their entrance song. Previous entrance 
songs include Metallica's version of "Breadfan" and "Get Ready for This" 
by 2 Unlimited. The latter song is the current team's goal song in 2016.[40] 
Any time the Sharks go on the power play, the Jaws theme song is played 
while the fans do "The Chomp," extending their arms in front and moving 
them up and down to form a chomping jaw. This is a partial list of the 
last five seasons completed by the Sharks. For the full season-by-season
