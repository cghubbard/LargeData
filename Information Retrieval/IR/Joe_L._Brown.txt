Joe LeRoy Brown (September 1, 1918 – August 15, 2010) was an American front 
office executive in Major League Baseball. Brown served as the general 
manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates from November 1, 1955, through the end 
of the 1976 season. Under his administration, the Pirates recovered from 
four consecutive last-place finishes in the National League to world championships 
in 1960 and 1971. Led by the great Baseball Hall of Fame players Roberto 
Clemente and Willie Stargell, the Bucs were perennial contenders in the 
National League (and, after 1969, the National League East Division). Brown 
was a native of New York, but grew up in Southern California. The son of 
actor-comedian Joe E. Brown (Some Like It Hot), he inherited his father's 
passion for baseball. Brown first met Branch Rickey, his predecessor in 
Pittsburgh, when Brown was 16 years of age, in 1935. He entered minor league 
baseball after his graduation from UCLA in 1939 as a front-office official 
with the Lubbock Hubbers of the Class D West Texas–New Mexico League. He 
served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, then joined 
the Hollywood Stars of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1946. Brown 
entered the Pittsburgh organization in 1950 as business manager of their 
Waco Pirates farm team in the Class B Big State League, then their New 
Orleans Pelicans club in the Double-A Southern Association. He joined the 
Pittsburgh front office in 1955, reunited with Rickey, who was in his final 
season as general manager. When Rickey, 73, retired to become the club's 
board chairman at the close of the 1955 campaign, Brown was the unanimous 
choice of that board (which also included part-owner Bing Crosby, the entertainer) 
to succeed him. Brown's first order of business was to find a successor 
to fired skipper Fred Haney. While his first choice, Bobby Bragan, was 
a misfire, Brown struck gold in August 1957 when he replaced Bragan with 
Danny Murtaugh, a former Pirate second baseman then in his second season 
as a coach. Under Murtaugh, the Bucs became contenders in 1958, and won 
the 1960 and 1971 World Series. Although he twice was compelled to step 
down for health reasons, Murtaugh would serve four separate terms as Brown's 
field manager (1957–64; 1967; 1970–71; 1973–76), and compile a 1,115–950 
(.540) record. Two months after Brown's and Murtaugh's joint retirement 
after the 1976 campaign, Murtaugh suffered a fatal stroke at age 59. Brown 
maintained and built upon the strong scouting and player development system 
created during Rickey's term as the Bucs' general manager. He also swung 
multiple shrewd trades, acquiring players such as Harvey Haddix, Smoky 
Burgess, Bill Virdon, Don Hoak, Hal Smith and Vinegar Bend Mizell, who 
would play key roles in Pittsburgh's 1960 championship. His 1971 club was 
almost exclusively produced from the Pirates' strong farm system, which 
mined talent from the Caribbean and Latin America. Brown would frequently 
accompany fabled scout Howie Haak on Haak's trips to Latin America. After 
almost a decade of semi-retirement (he remained a Southern California-based 
scout for the Bucs) Brown was called back into harness in 1985 to serve 
as acting general manager as the Pirates, rocked by a drug scandal, poor 
play and falling attendance, were sold by the John W. Galbreath family 
to a local consortium. He died on August 15, 2010, in Albuquerque, New
