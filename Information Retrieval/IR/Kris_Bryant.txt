Kristopher Lee "Kris" Bryant (born January 4, 1992) is an American professional 
baseball third baseman and outfielder for the Chicago Cubs of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He attended the University of San Diego, where he played 
college baseball for the San Diego Toreros baseball team. Bryant won the 
Dick Howser Trophy and Golden Spikes Award as the best amateur baseball 
player in 2013. The Cubs selected him with the second pick in the 2013 
Major League Baseball Draft. Prior to the 2015 season, he was ranked as 
the number one prospect in baseball by Baseball America. While drafted 
as a third baseman, he has also played outfield and first base for the 
Cubs. Bryant won the NL Rookie of the Year Award in 2015. Bryant attended 
Bonanza High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. Playing for the school's varsity 
baseball team all four years, he recorded a .418 batting average, a .958 
slugging percentage (SLG), 103 hits and 47 career home runs. He also played 
American Legion Baseball.[1] He was named to the USA Today All-USA baseball 
first-team.[2] The Toronto Blue Jays selected Bryant in the 18th round 
of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft. He did not sign, and enrolled 
at the University of San Diego, to play college baseball for the San Diego 
Toreros baseball team.[3] As a freshman at the University of San Diego 
in 2011, Bryant had a .365 batting average, a .482 on-base percentage (OBP), 
and a .599 SLG, with nine home runs. He was named a freshman All-American[4] 
and the West Coast Conference Co-Freshman of the Year and Co-Player of 
the Year, sharing both honors with Marco Gonzales.[2][5] As a sophomore 
in 2012, he was named a first-team All-American by Baseball America.[6] 
That summer, Bryant was selected by USA Baseball to play for the United 
States collegiate national team.[7] In the 2013 season as a junior, Bryant 
hit 31 home runs to lead the nation. It is the most home runs hit by a 
college player since the NCAA switched to a BBCOR composite bat in 2011. 
It broke the previous record of 30 set by Victor Roache in 2011[8][9] and 
amounted to more home runs than 223 of 296 Division I teams hit that season.[10] 
Bryant won the Golden Spikes Award[11] and the Dick Howser Trophy, which 
are both awarded to the top collegiate player in the nation.[12][13] He 
was also named a Louisville Slugger First Team All-American and the College 
Baseball News National Player of the Year.[14] Bryant was considered to 
be one of the best available players in the 2013 Major League Baseball 
Draft,[2][15][16] and was scouted by the Houston Astros, who had the first 
overall pick.[17] After the Astros selected Mark Appel with the first overall 
selection, the Chicago Cubs chose Bryant with the second overall selection.[18] 
Many baseball executives and scouts agree that Bryant was the safest pick 
in the draft. He was also rated as the best hitter in the draft because 
of his easy power from foul pole to foul pole and ability to make contact 
on inside fastballs as well as down-and-away curveballs.[19] Bryant agreed 
to a $6.7 million signing bonus with the Cubs two days prior to the signing 
deadline.[20] Bryant began his professional career with the Boise Hawks 
of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League batting .354 with 4 home runs. 
He was promoted to the Daytona Cubs of the Class A-Advanced Florida State 
League on August 12.[21] He hit .333 with five home runs for Daytona, and 
helped them win the Class A-Advanced championship. After the season he 
played in Arizona Fall League (AFL). He was named co-player of the week, 
along with Mitch Haniger, in the first week of the fall league season.[22] 
He was named the MVP of the AFL after hitting .364/.457/.727 with six home 
runs in 20 games.[23] Bryant started 2014 with the Double-A Tennessee Smokies. 
In June, he won the 2013 Southern League Home Run Derby and participated 
in the All-Star game.[24] On June 18, 2014, Bryant was promoted to the 
Triple-A Iowa Cubs after batting .355 with 22 home runs and 58 RBI in 68 
games with Tennessee.[25] In Keith Law's midseason top prospect update 
in July 2014, Bryant was ranked as the best prospect in baseball.[26] At 
the end of the regular season, Bryant was named the USA Today Minor League 
Player of the Year and Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year 
and also won the Joe Bauman Home Run Award[27][28] Baseball America named 
him the # 1 prospect in 2015.[29] Bryant was invited to spring training 
by the Cubs in 2015. In 40 at-bats, he hit 9 home runs, which led all players. 
He had a .425 with a .477 on-base percentage and a 1.175 slugging percentage.[30] 
Despite his performance, the Cubs elected to send Bryant back down to their 
Triple-A affiliate, the Iowa Cubs. Media members assumed that service time 
rules in baseball played a major influence on the team's decision; if Bryant 
played 12 days in the minors before being promoted to the majors the Cubs 
would receive another year of club control. The MLBPA issued a statement 
saying, "Today is a bad day for baseball".[31] In seven games with the 
Iowa Cubs, Bryant hit three home runs and batted .321.[30] On April 17, 
2015, Bryant was called up to the majors by the Cubs.[32][33] He made his 
debut that day at Wrigley Field, going 0–4 with three strikeouts and grounded 
into a fielder's choice, but showed good defense in the 5–4 loss against 
the San Diego Padres. Following the game, manager Joe Maddon remarked, 
"We did bring him up for his glove." [34] The next day at Wrigley, Bryant 
recorded his first hit, an RBI blooper into center field off San Diego's 
Tyson Ross. Bryant's patience showed in this game as he recorded three 
walks with no strikeouts, and tallied his first error and stolen base. 
His hustle played a key role in the team's victory in the 11th inning, 
as he ran out an infield single to set up the eventual walk off hit from 
teammate Starlin Castro.[35] Despite zero home runs in the month of April, 
Bryant batted for a .318 average, a .455 on-base percentage, and earned 
10 walks and RBI.[36] Beginning the month of May with a 20-game home run 
drought, Bryant hit his first major league home run on May 9, 2015, a three 
run shot, off of Milwaukee Brewers's Kyle Lohse. His second home run came 
at Wrigley Field; the first ball hit into the newly opened left field bleachers.[37] 
Bryant finished the month of May with a .265 batting average, seven home 
runs, 22 RBI, and 16 walks, and was awarded the NL Rookie of the Month 
for May.[38] Bryant's first grand slam came on June 17 in the ninth inning 
of a 17–0 win against the Cleveland Indians.[39] In a July 4 game against 
the Miami Marlins, Bryant hit both a two-run homer and his second grand 
slam of the season off Jarred Cosart. This made him the second Cubs rookie 
to hit two grand slams since Billy Williams in 1961.[40] Bryant was selected 
as an injury replacement selection for Giancarlo Stanton on the National 
League roster of the All-Star game in Cincinnati, Ohio. He also participated 
in the Home Run Derby.[41] On July 25, Bryant flied out at the warning 
track for the last out of Cole Hamels' no-hitter.[42] On July 27, Bryant 
hit his first career walk-off home run, a two-run homer in a 9–8 win over 
the Colorado Rockies.[43] On September 6, Bryant hit a 495-foot (151 m) 
home run, the longest of the 2015 MLB season. With the homer, Bryant tied 
Williams (1961) and Geovany Soto (2008), for the Cubs' franchise single-season 
RBI record for rookies with 86. On September 11, he established the record 
by driving in a run with a double.[44] On September 22, Bryant passed Williams 
for the most home runs by a Cubs rookie, with 26.[45] In 151 games of his 
first season in the Majors, Bryant batted .275 with 26 home runs, 31 doubles, 
and 99 RBI. The 99 RBI were the most for a rookie since Albert Pujols' 
130 in 2001. Bryant struck out 199 times which led the National League 
and set a new rookie record. According to sales on Major League Baseball's 
official website, Bryant had the best-selling jersey in all of baseball 
during the regular season.[46] With the Cubs finishing the season 97-65, 
the team clinched a Wild Card spot and it was their first berth in 7 years. 
Despite a hitless game in the 2015 MLB Wild Card Game, the Cubs shut out 
the Pittsburgh Pirates 4–0 advancing the Cubs to the National League Division 
Series, where in game three Bryant hit a two-run home run against the rival 
St. Louis Cardinals to help the Cubs to an 8–6 win.[47] The Cubs won the 
series in 4 games, but lost to the Mets in the 2015 NLCS. Bryant was named 
the Baseball America Rookie of the Year for the 2015 season making him 
the first in history to win the Baseball America college, minor league, 
and rookie of the year awards in successive seasons.[48] He was voted the 
"Esurance MLB Awards" Best Rookie – by fans, the media, former players, 
team front-office personnel, and the Society for American Baseball Research 
(SABR).[49] Bryant was awarded the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award 
for the National League, becoming the first Cub to earn it since Soto in 
2008.[50] Further, he was the unanimous winner from the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America (BBWAA) of the Jackie Robinson National League Rookie 
of the Year Award, becoming the 11th National Leaguer to win by a unanimous 
vote, and the 20th player overall.[51] On December 7, 2015, it was reported 
that Bryant had filed a grievance against the Cubs for delaying his call-up 
to the majors for the purpose of delaying his free agency.[52] Bryant became 
acknowledged as one of the most versatile defensive players in baseball 
in 2016. While his primary position is at third base, he has played at 
least one inning at five additional defensive positions in the 2016 season; 
at first base, left field, right field, center field, and shortstop. On 
June 27, 2016, against Cincinnati, Bryant became the first MLB player in 
modern history to hit three home runs and two doubles in the same game; 
he was 5-for-5 overall.[53] After leading the National League with 25 home 
runs in the first half of the season, he was selected to his second consecutive 
All-Star Game, and first as the starting third baseman. He hit a first-inning 
home run off Chris Sale, his first career home run in an All-Star Game.[54] 
In the opening game of a late August series against the National League 
West-division leading Los Angeles Dodgers, Bryant hit an eighth-inning 
home run to tie the game and a winning two-run homer in the 10th for 6−4 
victory.[55] From the All-Star Break to the start of September, Bryant 
had a batting average of .346. He became increasingly mentioned as a top 
MVP candidate which, if he wins, will make the first time a player wins 
the College Player of the Year, Minor League Player of the Year, Rookie 
of the Year and then Most Valuable Player of the Year in consecutive seasons. 
In August, as the Cubs went 22−6, Bryant batted .383, 1.220 OPS, 10 home 
runs, 22 RBI, and 29 runs scored. He was named the National League Player 
of the Month for August, his first Player of the Month award.[56] He finished 
the regular season with the most plate appearances for the year with 603 
and most hits with 176. Bryant recorded hits in all four games against 
the San Francisco Giants in the 2016 National League Division Series. In 
Game 4 with the Cubs down 5-2, Bryant singled to start a four-run rally 
in the top of the 9th, scoring on a double by Ben Zobrist, as the Cubs 
advanced to the National League Championship Series.[57] The Cubs eventually 
made it to the World Series, and came back from a 3-games-to-1 deficit 
by defeating the Cleveland Indians to secure their first championship after 
a 108-year long drought.[58] Bryant was named his high school's salutatorian, 
but allowed a classmate to take the role instead when he found out how 
badly she wanted it.[14] In college, he majored in biology before switching 
to finance.[2] His father, Mike, played in minor league baseball for the 
Boston Red Sox organization.[2][59] Mike owned a patio furniture store, 
but sold it in order to get a job that permitted him to coach his son.[60] 
He and fellow baseball players Bryce Harper and Joey Gallo grew up as acquaintances 
in the Las Vegas area, and began playing baseball with each other when 
they were nine. Bryant and Harper's friendly competition was displayed 
in the May 2015 series against the Washington Nationals at Wrigley Field, 
when they greeted each other for the first time in the Major Leagues.[61]
