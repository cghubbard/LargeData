As Player As Coach William James "Gates" Brown (May 2, 1939 – September 
27, 2013) was an American Major League Baseball left fielder who spent 
his entire career with the Detroit Tigers (1963–1975). He batted left-handed 
and threw right-handed. Born in Crestline, Ohio, he served time at the 
Ohio State Reformatory for burglary from 1958 to 1959.[1] He was encouraged 
by a prison guard who also coached the reformatory's baseball team to join 
the squad as a catcher. The coach contacted several major-league teams 
after being impressed by Brown's batting ability. Tigers scouts Frank Skaff 
and Pat Mullin convinced their ballclub to help Brown get paroled a year 
early and sign him for US $7,000. He chose to join the Tigers despite interest 
from other teams such as the Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Indians. He 
explained, "The primary reasons I signed with Detroit is because they didn't 
have any black players and eventually I figured they would, plus, I had 
been told about the short right porch at Tiger Stadium."[2][3] In a 13 
season career, Brown was a .257 hitter with 84 home runs and 322 runs batted 
in in 1,051 games played. Brown divided his major league career as an outfielder, 
first baseman, pinch hitter and designated hitter. He is best remembered 
for his contribution to the 1968 World Series champion Detroit Tigers. 
In his pinch hitting at bats in the 1968 season, Brown hit for a .450 batting 
average, the eighth highest single season batting average for a pinch hitter 
(minimum 30 at bats) in major league history. Brown holds the American 
League record for the most pinch-hit at bats in a career, with 414.[4] 
On June 19, 1963, coming off the bench, Brown became the American League's 
11th player to hit a home run in his first at bat. A popular figure among 
Tigers fans, Brown may not have had the defensive skills to make the everyday 
lineup but he has been considered one of the premier pinch hitters in MLB 
history. In his career, Brown collected 107 pinch hits, including 16 pinch 
homers, and also led twice the AL in pinch hits (1968 and 1974). His most 
productive season came in 1964, when he posted career-highs in home runs 
(15), RBIs (54), runs (65), hits (116), doubles (22), triples (6), stolen 
bases (11) and at bats (426) in 123 games. While 1968 was called the year 
of the pitcher for most of baseball, overall batting being only .230 for 
the year, the potent Tigers attack scored 671 runs. That year was the batting 
high-water mark for Gates Brown who, with remarkable regularity, came off 
the bench with clutch hits to spark dramatic ninth inning comeback victories. 
Brown's timely hitting was crucial in sealing the Tigers' trip to the World 
Championship. Starting in only 17 games that season, Brown appeared in 
49 more as a pinch hitter, banging out a torrid .370 (34 for 92) with a 
.442 on-base percentage and a .685 slugging average. On August 7, 1968, 
Brown made history. He wasn't in the starting lineup, so he decided to 
grab two hot dogs from the clubhouse. He was ordered by manager Mayo Smith 
to pinch hit. He stuffed the hot dogs in his jersey to hide them from his 
manager. "I always wanted to get a hit every time I went to the plate. 
But this was one time I didn't want to get a hit. I'll be damned if I didn't 
smack one in the gap and I had to slide into second—head first, no less. 
I was safe with a double. But when I stood up, I had mustard and ketchup 
and smashed hot dogs and buns all over me. "The fielders took one look 
at me, turned their backs and damned near busted a gut laughing at me. 
My teammates in the dugout went crazy." After fining Brown $100, Smith 
said, "What the hell were you doing eating on the bench in the first place?" 
Brown: "I decided to tell him the truth. I said, 'I was hungry. Besides, 
where else can you eat a hot dog and have the best seat in the house'"[5] 
From 1971 to 1973 Brown hit 33 home runs with 110 RBIs in 571 at-bats, 
including a .338 average in 1971 (66 for 195). He retired at the end of 
the 1975 season. In 1978, Brown returned to the Tigers as their hitting 
coach, a position he would hold through the championship season of 1984, 
before giving way to Vada Pinson. Brown died of a heart attack on September 
27, 2013 at a nursing home, aged 74. He had been in failing health for
