The Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) is a collegiate 
athletic conference consisting mostly of historically black colleges and 
universities (HBCUs), with all but one member located in the southern United 
States. Formed in 1913, the SIAC is a member of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (NCAA) and competes in Division II. Only two charter 
members are still part of the conference--Clark Atlanta University (formerly 
Clark College) and Tuskegee University (one other charter member, Morehouse, 
briefly left before returning). Before 2014, all members had been southern 
HBCUs, but the SIAC's two newest members include its only non-HBCU, Spring 
Hill College (joining in 2014), and its only member outside the South, 
Central State University of Ohio (joining in 2015). The U.S. Army's 24th 
Infantry Division teams competed as members of the SIAC from 1930 until 
1935. The SIAC leads all Division II conferences (nationwide) in football 
attendance.[1]  Full member (all sports)   Full member (non-football)
