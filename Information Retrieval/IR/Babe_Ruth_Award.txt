The Babe Ruth Award is given annually to the Major League Baseball (MLB) 
player with the best performance in the postseason. The award, created 
in honor of Babe Ruth, was first awarded in 1949 to the MVP of the World 
Series, one year after Ruth's death. The award was created by the New York 
City chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). It 
continued to be awarded exclusively for performances in the World Series 
until 2007, when the New York chapter of the BBWAA changed the award to 
cover the entire postseason.[1][2] Though it is older than the World Series 
Most Valuable Player Award, which was not created until 1955, the Babe 
Ruth Award is considered less prestigious, as it is not sanctioned by MLB 
and is awarded several weeks after the World Series.[2][3][4] MLB expanded 
its postseason to include the League Championship Series (LCS) in 1969, 
the League Division Series (LDS) in 1995, and the Wild Card round in 2012. 
The Wild Card round is a one-game playoff, the LDS follows a best-of-five 
playoff format, and the LCS and World Series follow a best-of-seven playoff 
format.[4][5] The most recent World Series champions are the Kansas City 
Royals, who won in 2015. Wade Davis is the most recent recipient of the 
Babe Ruth Award.[6] Ruth was a noted slugger who batted .326 with 15 home 
runs and three wins in three games started as a pitcher during World Series 
play.[7] However, the Babe Ruth Award does not only go to sluggers or pitchers. 
Dick Green won the award for the 1974 World Series, in which he batted 
0-for-13, but helped the Oakland Athletics win the series with his defense.[8][9] 
Joe Page of the New York Yankees was the first winner of the Babe Ruth 
Award, and Jonathan Papelbon of the Boston Red Sox was the first winner 
since the award criteria changed to cover the entire postseason. In all, 
members of the Yankees have won the award sixteen times. Luis Tiant is 
the only winner of the Babe Ruth Award to play for the World Series-losing 
team. Two players, Sandy Koufax and Jack Morris, have won the award twice.[10]
