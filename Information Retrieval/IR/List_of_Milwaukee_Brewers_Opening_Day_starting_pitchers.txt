The Milwaukee Brewers are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team based in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin. They play in the National League Central division. The first 
game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and 
being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to 
the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[1] though 
there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not 
start on Opening Day.[2] The Brewers played their inaugural season in 1969 
as the Seattle Pilots, playing home games at Sick's Stadium. The team moved 
to Milwaukee in 1970, and played their home games at Milwaukee County Stadium 
until 2000. The team's current home, Miller Park, has been the Brewers' 
home field since the start of the 2001 season.[3] The Pilots/Brewers played 
their first 29 seasons in the American League, and switched leagues at 
the start of the 1998 season.[4] The Brewers have used 28 different Opening 
Day starting pitchers in their 47 seasons. The 28 starters have a combined 
Opening Day record of 15 wins, 17 losses and 15 no decisions. No decisions 
are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after 
the starting pitcher has left the game or if the starting pitcher pitches 
fewer than five innings. Of the 15 no decisions, the Brewers went on to 
win eight and lose six of those games (one ended in a tie), for a team 
record on Opening Day of 23–23–1.[5][6] The Pilots' first Opening Day starting 
pitcher was Marty Pattin, who received the win in a 4–3 victory against 
the California Angels.[7] After the team's move to Milwaukee in 1970, Lew 
Krausse Jr. was charged with the loss in a game at Milwaukee County Stadium 
vs. the Angels.[8] Ben Sheets holds the club record for most Opening Day 
starts with six, from 2002 through 2005 and again in both 2007 and 2008.[5] 
Sheets has a 3–0 record as a starter on Opening Day, the franchise's best 
record.[9] Marty Pattin and Mike Caldwell also have perfect records; both 
won each of their two starts. The Brewers' 17 Opening Day losses by starters 
are distributed among 16 different pitchers, each having lost one game, 
excluding Yovani Gallardo, who has lost two.[5][6][10] Steve Woodard received 
an unusual no-decision in 2000, when the team's Opening Day game against 
the Cincinnati Reds was called in the sixth inning due to rain, with the 
score tied at 3.[11] This was the first Opening Day tie game since 1965.[12] 
The Brewers advanced to the playoffs in 1981, 1982, 2008, and 2011.[13] 
The franchise's first playoff experience was in the strike-shortened 1981 
season.[14] In a special format created for that season, the Brewers were 
the second-half champion and lost the AL Division Series to the first-half 
champion, the New York Yankees, in five games.[15] Mike Caldwell had started 
and won on Opening Day that season, but the team's playoff opener had Moose 
Haas start and lose a 5–3 game to the Yankees.[16] The Brewers' lost the 
1982 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games; Pete Vuckovich 
was the Opening Day starter and winner that season and Mike Caldwell was 
the starting pitcher in the team's first World Series appearance, a 10–0 
win.[17] In the 2008 season, Ben Sheets was the Opening Starter in a no-decision; 
Yovani Gallardo started and lost the first game of the 2008 National League 
Division Series, which was won by the Philadelphia Phillies in four games.[18] 
Overall, the Brewers' Opening Day starting pitchers have a record of 3 wins 
and 2 losses at Milwaukee County Stadium and 2 wins and 3 losses at Miller 
Park. The Brewers' Opening Day starting pitchers' combined home record 
is 5 wins and 5 losses, and their away record is 10 wins and 11 losses.[5][6][10]
