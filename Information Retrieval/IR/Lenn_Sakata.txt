Lenn Haruki Sakata (Japanese: 坂田春樹 born June 8, 1954) is a former professional 
baseball player who played in the Major Leagues primarily as a utility 
player from 1977 to 1987 and was a member of the Baltimore Orioles 1983 
World Series Championship team. He was the second Asian American to play 
Major League Baseball.[1] He is Yonsei (fourth-generation American of Japanese 
ancestry).[2] Sakata graduated from Kalani High School in 1971. Sakata 
played college baseball for the Gonzaga Bulldogs of Gonzaga University 
in Spokane, Washington.[3] Sakata began 1981 as a reserve and missed time 
in May due to a sprained ankle. In September, he took over the shortstop 
position, replacing longtime Oriole shortstop Mark Belanger.[4][5] Sakata 
was humble about this, saying, "I never looked at myself as the next Mark 
Belanger. It would have been pointless and arrogant for anybody to feel 
that way." He was the starting shortstop for the Orioles when Cal Ripken, 
Jr., began his consecutive games played streak. When manager Earl Weaver 
decided to shift Ripken to short at the beginning of July, 1982, he moved 
Sakata to third, keeping Sakata in the lineup.[6] Sakata was the catcher 
(a position he did not usually play) when Tippy Martinez picked three Toronto 
Blue Jays off first base in the tenth inning of the August 24, 1983 game 
at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. The Orioles had replaced their starting 
catcher and his backup while rallying to tie the game in the ninth inning. 
Three consecutive Blue Jays hitters reached first base and each one, thinking 
it would be easy to steal a base on Sakata, took a big lead. Martinez picked 
off all three base runners. Sakata hit a walk-off home run in the bottom 
of the tenth to win the game.[7] After his playing career ended, Sakata 
began coaching in the minor league system. He has served as manager of 
the Modesto A's (1989), San Jose Giants (1999, 2001, 2004–2007), Bakersfield 
Blaze (2000), and Fresno Grizzlies (2002). On May 31, 2007 Sakata notched 
his 527th victory as a California League manager, setting the record for 
lifetime wins.[8] Sakata became the farm team manager of the Chiba Lotte 
Marines in Japan in 2008.[7] He returned to American baseball in 2011, 
becoming the hitting coach for Asheville Tourists (Low-A). After managing 
the Modesto Nuts from 2012-2013, Sakata rejoined the San Jose Giants in 
2014 and was succeeded on January 10, 2015 by Russ Morman taking over as 
manager beginning the 2015 season.[9] Sakata was selected by CNN Sports 
Illustrated as one of the 50 greatest sports figures in Hawai'i history[10] 
and is a member of the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame located in the Bishop 
Museum. Sakata owns a small chain of high-end independent grocery stores 
in the Fresno, California area. Rosenfeld, Harvey (1995). Iron Man: The
