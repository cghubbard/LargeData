Bobby Dean Howry (born August 4, 1973) is a former Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher. Howry attended, and played baseball at Deer Valley High 
School in Arizona, then he attended McNeese State University and was drafted 
by the San Francisco Giants in the fifth round of the 1994 Major League 
Baseball Draft. During the 1997 season, Howry was one of six prospects 
(along with Keith Foulke, Lorenzo Barceló, Mike Caruso, Ken Vining, and 
Brian Manning) traded to the White Sox in exchange for Wilson Alvarez, 
Danny Darwin, and Roberto Hernández in what became known as the White Flag 
Trade.[1] He made his major league debut with the Chicago White Sox in 
1998 and served as the team's closer, saving 28 games in 1999 until being 
replaced by Keith Foulke in early May 2000. He was dealt to the Boston 
Red Sox in 2002, but suffered right elbow problems that forced him to be 
put on the 60-day disabled list in late 2003. Howry successfully recovered 
from right elbow surgery and made a comeback with the Cleveland Indians 
in 2004. In a year and a half with the Indians, Howry posted an 11-6 record 
with 87 strikeouts and a 2.61 ERA. In late 2005, Howry signed a three-year, 
$12 million deal with the Chicago Cubs, where he filled in for an injured 
Ryan Dempster during the 2007 playoff run, earning eight saves with a 3.32 
ERA, and was one of the Cubs' primary relievers in 2008, sometimes serving 
as setup man to All-Star closer Kerry Wood. He is one of four pitchers 
who have pitched in at least 70 games each of the four seasons from 2004–08, 
the others being Scott Schoeneweis (who has done so for five seasons), 
Chad Qualls, and Dan Wheeler.[2] After the Cubs declined arbitration, Howry 
signed a $2.75 million, one-year contract with the San Francisco Giants 
on December 3, 2008.[3] On December 28, 2009, Howry signed a one-year deal 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks with a club option for 2011.[4] On May 17, 
2010, he was released by the Arizona Diamondbacks to make room for recently 
acquired Saul Rivera.[5] On May 21, Howry re-signed with the Cubs. [6] 
On July 30, 2010, the Cubs released Howry. During his brief return to the 
Cubs in 2010, he was 0-3 with a 5.66 ERA in 24 relief appearances. Howry 
was released to make room for pitcher Carlos Zambrano, who was returning 
to the team from suspension.[7] On February 27, 2011, Howry retired.[8]
