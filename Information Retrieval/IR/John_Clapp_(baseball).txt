As player As manager John Edgar Clapp (July 17, 1851 – December 18, 1904), 
nicknamed "Honest John", was a professional baseball player-manager whose 
career spanned 12 seasons, 11 of which were spent with the Major League 
Baseball (MLB) Middletown Mansfields (1872), Philadelphia Athletics (1873–75), 
St. Louis Brown Stockings (1876–77), Indianapolis Blues (1878), Buffalo 
Bisons (1879), Cincinnati Reds (1880), Cleveland Blues (1881), and New 
York Gothams (1883). Clapp, who predominately played as a catcher, also 
played as an outfielder. Over his career, Clapp compiled a career batting 
average of .283 with 459 runs scored, 713 hits, 92 doubles, 35 triples, 
7 home runs, and 834 runs batted in (RBI). Over 1,188 games played, Clapp 
struck out 51 times. Although the majority of his career was spent in the 
major leagues, Clapp also played two seasons of minor league baseball. 
He made his MLB debut at the age of 21 and was listed as standing 5 feet 
7 inches (170 cm) and weighing 194 pounds (88 kg).[1] His brother, Aaron 
Clapp, also played one season of MLB for the Troy Trojans. John Edgar Clapp 
was born on July 17, 1851, in Ithaca, New York.[2] In 1872, Clapp began 
his professional career with the Middletown Mansfields of the National 
Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NA). Over 19 games played, 
Clapp batted .278 with one home run and a team-high 30 runs scored while 
managing the team to a 5–19 record.[3] After the team folded, Clapp joined 
the Philadelphia Athletics. His single home run tied him for the team-lead 
along with Wes Fisler, Cherokee Fisher, and Tim Murnane.[4] Next season, 
in 1874, Clapp led the NA in at bats per home run (55); his on-base percentage 
(.732) was a career-high, while the Athletics finished the season 33–22, 
third in the NA, under manager Dick McBride.[5] In his final year with 
the club, Clapp batted .264 with 77 hits and 39 RBI. His putout total was 
second in the NA among catchers. In 1876, Clapp joined the St. Louis Brown 
Stockings of the National League (NL). He finished the year tied for the 
team lead in games played (64) and hits (91),[6] while he led the NL in 
putouts as a catcher, with 333.[7] Next season, Clapp batted a career high 
.318, while his on-base percentage and on-base plus slugging percentages 
were the second highest in his career. In the field, Clapp committed 40 
errors as a catcher, second highest in the NL to Lew Brown's 49.[8] After 
leaving the team, Clapp joined the Indianapolis Blues, where he served 
as a player-manager for the 1878 season. Playing primarily in the outfield, 
Clapp was tied for the MLB lead in games played along with Indianapolis 
teammates Silver Flint, Russ McKelvy, Orator Shafer, and Ned Williamson.[9] 
After his one-year stint with the Blues, Clapp joined the Buffalo Bisons. 
Playing in 70 games, Clapp managed the team to a 46–32 record, placing 
the Bisons third in the NL.[10] On June 25 of that year, Clapp ended a 
streak of 212 consecutive games played, serving primarily as a catcher.[11] 
In 1880, now playing and managing for the Cincinnati Reds, Clapp played 
in a total of 80 games, a career high, while leading the team to a 21–59 
record.[12] He played for the Cleveland Blues in 1881, when he earned the 
nickname "Honest": in May, a Chicago bookmaker named James S. Woodruff 
offered Clapp $5,000 ($122,810.34 in 2011) to allow a passed ball with 
runners on base, and also wanted to be informed which games to bet on when 
the moves would take place.[13] Clapp reported him to the Chicago police, 
which led to Woodruff's arrest.[14] In 1882, after leading the NL in walks, 
Clapp made his minor-league debut for the New York Metropolitans of the 
League Alliance. In 1883, his last MLB season, Clapp played for and managed 
the New York Gothams for their inaugural season.[15] Clapp, then 34, spent 
his final professional season with the St. Paul Apostles, where he batted 
.180 with 11 hits and a double.[16] After retiring from baseball, Clapp 
served as a night sergeant in his hometown of Ithaca, New York.[14] He 
died at midnight on December 18, 1904, of apoplexy.[17] Clapp was interred
