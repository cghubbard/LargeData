USA Today is an internationally distributed American daily middle-market 
newspaper that serves as the flagship publication of its owner, the Gannett 
Company. Founded by Al Neuharth on September 15, 1982, it operates from 
Gannett's corporate headquarters on Jones Branch Drive in McLean, Virginia, 
United States.[2] It is printed at 37 sites across the United States and 
at five additional sites internationally. Its dynamic design influenced 
the style of local, regional and national newspapers worldwide, through 
its use of concise reports, colorized images, informational graphics, and 
its inclusion of pop culture stories, among other distinct features.[3][4] 
With a weekly circulation of 1,021,638 and an approximate daily reach of 
seven million readers as of 2016[update],[5] USA Today shares the position 
of having the widest circulation of any newspaper in the United States 
with The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.[6] USA Today is distributed 
in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, with an international 
edition distributed in Canada, Asia and the Pacific Islands, and Europe. 
The development of USA Today commenced on February 29, 1980, when company 
staff employed for a task force known as "Project NN" met with Gannett 
Company chairman Al Neuharth in Cocoa Beach, Florida to develop a national 
newspaper. Early, regional prototypes included East Bay Today, an Oakland, 
California-based publication first published in the late 1970s to serve 
as the morning edition of the Oakland Tribune, an afternoon newspaper which 
Gannett owned at the time.[7] On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first 
prototypes of the proposed publication; the copies, which displayed two 
proposed design layouts, were mailed to various newsmakers and prominent 
leaders in journalism for review and input.[4][8] The Gannett Company's 
Board of Directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, which 
would be titled USA Today, on December 5, 1981; with the launch, Neuharth 
was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities 
to his existing position as Gannett's chief executive officer.[8][9] Gannett 
formally announced the launch of the paper on April 20, 1982. USA Today 
began publishing on September 15, 1982, initially launching in the Baltimore 
and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas for an initial newsstand price 
of 25¢ (equivalent to 61¢ today). After selling out its first issue, Gannett 
gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, eventually reaching 
an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies, double the amount of copy sales 
that Gannett projected that USA Today would accrue by the end of 1982. 
The design was unique in its incorporation of colorized graphics and photographs; 
initially, only its front news section pages were rendered in four-color, 
while the remaining pages were displayed in a spot color format. The paper's 
overall content style and elevated use of graphics – the result of the 
concept developed by Neuharth, in contribution with staff graphics designers 
George Rorick, Sam Ward, Suzy Parker, John Sherlock and Web Bryant – was 
derided by critics, who referred to it as "McPaper" or "television you 
can wrap fish in," because it opted to incorporate more concise, shorter-form 
nuggets of information akin to the style of television news rather than 
in-depth stories in many of its sections like traditional newspapers, which 
many in the newspaper industry considered to be a dumbing down of the news.[8][9][10] 
On July 2, 1984, the newspaper switched from a largely black-and-white 
to a color publication, featuring full color photography and graphics in 
all four sections. The following week on July 10, USA Today launched an 
international edition intended primarily for U.S. readers abroad; this 
was followed four months later on October 8 with the rollout of the first 
via satellite publication of its international version in Singapore. On 
April 8, 1985, the paper published its first special bonus section, a 12-page 
section called "Baseball '85," which previewed the 1985 Major League Baseball 
season.[8] By the fourth quarter of 1985, USA Today had become the second 
largest newspaper in the United States, reaching a daily circulation of 
1.4 million copies; total daily readership of the paper by 1987 (according 
to Simmons Market Research Bureau statistics) had reached 5.5 million, 
the largest of any daily newspaper in the U.S. On May 6, 1986, USA Today 
began printing production of its international edition in Switzerland. 
USA Today operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, 
accumulating a total deficit of $233 million after taxes, according to 
figures released by Gannett in July 1987; the newspaper began turning its 
first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett corporate revenue 
projections.[8] On January 29, 1988, USA Today published the largest edition 
in its history, a 78-page weekend edition featuring a section previewing 
Super Bowl XXII; the edition included 44.38 pages of advertising and sold 
2,114,055 copies, setting a single-day circulation record for an American 
newspaper (a record that the paper would beat nearly nine months later 
on September 2, when its Labor Day weekend edition sold 2,257,734 copies). 
On April 15, USA Today launched a third international printing site, based 
in Hong Kong. The international edition set circulation and advertising 
sales records during August 1988, when the publication provided extensive 
coverage of that year's Summer Olympics, selling more than 60,000 copies 
and 100 pages of advertising.[8] By July 1991, Simmons Market Research 
Bureau estimated that USA Today had a total daily readership of nearly 
6.6 million readers, an all-time high for the paper at the time and the 
largest readership of any daily newspaper in the United States. On September 
1 of that year, USA Today launched a fourth printsite for its international 
edition in London to publish and distribute that version of the paper to 
the United Kingdom and the British Isles.[8] The international edition's 
format was changed beginning with the April 1, 1994 issue to release each 
issue on Monday through Fridays, rather than from Tuesday through Saturday, 
in order to accommodate business travelers; on February 1, 1995, USA Today 
opened its first editorial bureau outside of the United States at its Hong 
Kong publishing facility; additional editorial bureaus were launched in 
London and Moscow in 1996.[8] On April 17, 1995, USA Today launched its 
website, www.usatoday.com, as part of the USA Today Information Network 
to provide real-time news coverage; the site would eventually expand to 
include a spin-off website that launched in June 2002, USATODAY.com Travel, 
providing travel information and booking tools. On August 28, 1995, a fifth 
international publishing site was launched in Frankfurt, Germany, to print 
and distribute the international edition throughout most of Europe.[8] 
On October 4, 1999, USA Today began running advertisements on its front 
page for the first time.[8] On February 8, 2000, Gannett launched USA Today 
Live, a broadcast and Internet initiative designed to provide coverage 
from the newspaper to broadcast television stations nationwide for use 
in their local newscasts and their websites; the venture would also provide 
integration with the USA Today website, which transitioned from a text-based 
format to feature audio and video clips of news content. The paper launched 
a sixth printing site for its international edition on May 15, 2000, in 
Milan, Italy, followed on July 10 by the launch of an international printing 
facility in Charleroi, Belgium.[8] 2001 saw additional expansion of the 
newspaper, with the launch of two interactive units: on June 19, USA Today 
and Gannett Newspapers launched the USA Today Careers Network (now Careers.com), 
a website featuring localized employment listings, then on July 18, the 
USA Today News Center was launched as an interactive television news service 
developed through a joint venture with the On Command Corporation that 
was distributed to hotels around the United States. On September 12 of 
that year, the newspaper set an all-time single day circulation record, 
selling 3,638,600 copies for its edition covering the terrorist attacks 
that damaged the World Trade Center and The Pentagon and a hijacking attempt 
tied to the two events that resulted in the crash of United Airlines Flight 
93 outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. That November, USA Today migrated 
its operations from Gannett's previous corporate headquarters in Arlington, 
Virginia to the company's new headquarters in nearby McLean.[8] On December 
12, 2005, Gannett announced that it would combine the separate newsroom 
operations of USA Today's online and print entities, with USAToday.com's 
vice president and editor-in-chief Kinsey Wilson being promoted to co-executive 
editor, alongside existing executive editor John Hillkirk.[8] In 2010, 
USA Today launched the USA Today API for sharing data with partners of 
all types.[11] On August 27, 2010, USA Today announced that would undergo 
a reorganization of its newsroom, announcing the layoffs of 130 staffers. 
In addition, it also announced that the paper would shift its focus away 
from print and place more emphasis on its digital platforms (including 
USAToday.com and its related mobile applications) and launch of a new publication 
called USA Today Sports. On January 24, 2011, to reverse a revenue slide, 
the paper introduced a tweaked format that modified the appearance of its 
front section pages, which included a larger logo at the top of each page; 
coloring tweaks to section front pages; a new sans-serif font, called Prelo, 
for certain headlines of main stories (replacing the Gulliver typeface 
that had been implemented for story headers in April 2000); an updated 
"Newsline" feature featuring larger, "newsier" headline entry points; and 
the increasing and decreasing of mastheads and white space to present a 
cleaner style.[12][13] On September 14, 2012, USA Today underwent the first 
major redesign in its history, in commemoration for the 30th anniversary 
of the paper's first edition.[14] Developed in conjunction with brand design 
firm Wolff Olins, the print edition of USA Today added a page covering 
technology stories and expanded travel coverage within the Life section 
and increased the number of color pages included in each edition, while 
retaining longtime elements.[15] The "globe" logo used since the paper's 
inception was replaced with a new logo featuring a large circle rendered 
in colors corresponding to each of the sections, serving as an infographic 
that changes with news stories, containing images representing that day's 
top stories.[15][16] The paper's website was also extensively overhauled 
using a new, in-house content management system known as Presto and a design 
created by Fantasy Interactive, that incorporates flipboard-style navigation 
to switch between individual stories (which obscure most of the main and 
section pages), clickable video advertising and a responsive design layout. 
The site was designed to be more interactive, provide optimizations for 
mobile and touchscreen devices, provide "high impact" advertising units, 
and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate USA Today content to the 
websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, 
Gannett migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto 
platform and the USA Today site design throughout 2013 and 2014 (although 
archive content accessible through search engines remains available through 
the pre-relaunch design).[17][18] On October 6, 2013, Gannett test launched 
a daily "butterfly" edition of USA Today for distribution as an insert 
in four of its newspapers – The Indianapolis Star, the Rochester Democrat 
& Chronicle, the Fort Myers-based News-Press and the Appleton, Wisconsin-based 
Post-Crescent. The launch of the syndicated insert caused USA Today to 
restructure its operations to allow seven-day-a-week production to accommodate 
the packaging of its national and international news content and enterprise 
stories (comprising about 10 pages for the weekday and Saturday editions, 
and up to 22 pages for the Sunday edition) into the pilot insert. Gannett 
later announced on December 11, that it would formally launch the condensed 
daily edition of USA Today in 31 additional local newspapers nationwide 
through April 2014 (with the Palm Springs, California-based Desert Sun 
and the Lafayette, Louisiana-based Advertiser being the first newspapers 
outside of the pilot program participants to add the supplement on December 
15), citing "positive feedback" to the feature from readers and advertisers 
of the initial four papers. Gannett was given permission from the Alliance 
for Audited Media to count the circulation figures from the syndicated 
local insert with the total circulation count for the flagship national 
edition of USA Today.[19][20] On January 4, 2014, USA Today acquired the 
book and film review website, Reviewed.com.[8] In the first quarter of 
2014, Gannett launched a condensed USA Today insert into 31 other newspapers 
in its network, thereby increasing the number of inserts to 35, in an effort 
to shore up USA Today's circulation after it regained its position as the 
highest circulated weekdaily newspaper in the United States in October 
2013.[21] On September 3, 2014, USA Today announced that it would lay off 
roughly 70 employees in a restructuring of its newsroom and business operations.[22] 
In October 2014, USA Today and OpenWager Inc. entered into a partnership 
to release a Bingo app called USA TODAY Bingo Cruise.[23] On December 3, 
2015, Gannett formally launched the USA Today Network, a national digital 
newsgathering service providing shared content between USA Today and the 
company's 92 local newspapers throughout the United States as well as pooling 
advertising services on both a hyperlocal and national reach. The Louisville 
Courier-Journal had earlier soft-launched the service as part of a pilot 
program started on November 17, coinciding with an imaging rebrand for 
the Louisville, Kentucky-based newspaper; Gannett's other local newspaper 
properties, as well as those it acquired through its merger with the Journal 
Media Group, began identifying themselves as part of the USA Today Network 
(foregoing use of the Gannett name outside of requisite ownership references) 
gradually integrated into the USA Today Network through early January 2016.[24][25][26] 
USA Today is known for synthesizing news down to easy-to-read-and-comprehend 
stories. In the main edition circulated in the United States and some Canadian 
cities, each edition consists of four sections: News (the oft-labeled "front 
page" section), Money, Sports, and Life. Since March 1998, the Friday edition 
of Life has been separated into two distinct sections: the regular Life 
focusing on entertainment (subtitled Weekend; section E), which features 
television reviews and listings, a DVD column, film reviews and trends, 
and a travel supplement called Destinations & Diversions (section D). The 
international edition of the paper features two sections: News and Money 
in one; with Sports and Life in the other. Atypical of most daily newspapers, 
the paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition serves 
as the weekend edition (although USA Today has published special Saturday 
and Sunday editions in the past, the first being published on January 19, 
1991, when it released a Saturday "Extra" edition updating coverage of 
the Gulf War from the previous day; the paper published special seven-day-a-week 
editions for the first time on July 19, 1996, when it published special 
editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of Atlanta and surrounding 
areas for the two-week duration of the Summer Olympics).[8] USA Today prints 
each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the 
exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires 
a jump (readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the 
story, usually the next page of that section). On certain days, the news 
or sports section will take up two paper sections, and there will be a 
second cover story within the second section. Each section is denoted by 
a certain color to differentiate sections beyond lettering and is seen 
in a box the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors 
are blue for News (section A), green for Money (section B), red for Sports 
(section C), and purple for Life (section D); in the paper's early years, 
the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot 
color, as the presses used at USA Today' printing facilities did not yet 
accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections.[27] 
Orange is used for bonus sections (section E or above), which are published 
occasionally such as for business travel trends and the Olympics; other 
bonus sections for sports (such as for the PGA Tour preview, NCAA Basketball 
Tournaments, Memorial Day auto races (Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600), 
NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl) previously used the orange color, 
but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections. To increase 
their ties to USA Today, Gannett incorporated the USA Today coloring scheme 
into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the 
company began phasing in across its television station group – which were 
spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company 
Tegna – in late 2012 (the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown 
graphic used on most stations – outside of those that Gannett acquired 
in 2014 from London Broadcasting, which began implementing the package 
in late 2015 – that persists throughout its stations' newscasts, as well 
as bumpers for individual story topics). Gannett's television stations 
began to a new on-air appearance that uses a color-coding system identical 
to that of the paper.[28] In many ways, USA Today is set up to break the 
typical newspaper layout. Some examples of that divergence from tradition 
include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers (front-page 
paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages[29]), sometimes using sentence-length 
blurbs to describe stories inside; the lead reefer is the cover page feature 
"Newsline," which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured 
in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, 
USA Today cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the 
entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps for the continental 
United States, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, and temperature 
lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world (temperatures for 
individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are 
suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as "t" for thunderstorms, 
referencing the expected weather conditions); the colorized forecast map, 
originally created by staff designer George Rorick (who left USA Today 
for a similar position at The Detroit News in 1986), was copied by newspapers 
around the world, breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome 
contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges.[10][30] National 
precipitation maps for the next three days (previously five days until 
the 2012 redesign), and four-day forecasts and Air Quality Indexes for 
36 major U.S. cities (originally 16 cities prior to 1999) – with individual 
cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given 
area on the forecast map – are also featured. Weather data is provided 
by AccuWeather, which has served as the forecast provider for USA Today 
for most of the paper's existence (with an exception from January 2002 
to September 2012, when The Weather Channel provided data through a long-term 
multimedia content agreement with Gannett).[31][32][33][34][35] In the 
bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is "Weather Focus", a graphic 
which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather 
Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event. On Mondays, the 
Money section uses its back page for "Market Trends," a feature that launched 
in June 2002 and presents an unusual graphic depicting the performance 
of various industry groups as a function of quarterly, monthly, and weekly 
movements against the S&P 500. On days featuring bonus sections or business 
holidays, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, 
while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common 
during quiet weeks. Advertising coverage is seen in the Monday Money section, 
which often includes a review of a current television ad, and after Super 
Bowl Sunday, a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results 
of the Ad Track live survey. Stock tables for individual stock exchanges 
(comprising one subsection for companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange, 
and another for companies trading on NASDAQ and the American Stock Exchange) 
and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the 
myriad of electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with 
most newspapers. Book coverage, including reviews and a national sales 
chart (the latter of which debuted on October 28, 1994), is seen on Thursdays 
in Life, with the official full A.C. Nielsen television ratings chart printed 
on Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on release. The paper also publishes 
the Mediabase survey for several genres of music, based on radio airplay 
spins on Tuesdays, along with their own chart of the top ten singles in 
general on Wednesdays. Because of the same limitations cited for its nationalized 
forecasts, the television page in Life – which provides prime time and 
late night listings (running from 8:00 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Eastern Time) 
– incorporates a boilerplate "Local news" or "Local programming" descriptions 
to denote time periods in which the five major English language broadcast 
networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW) cede airtime to allow their affiliates 
to carry syndicated programs or local newscasts; the television page has 
never been accompanied by a weekly listings supplement with broader scheduling 
information similar to those featured in local newspapers. Like most national 
papers, USA Today does not carry comic strips. One of the staples of the 
News section is "Across the USA," a state-by-state roundup of headlines. 
The summaries consist of paragraph-length Associated Press reports highlighting 
one story of note in each state, the District of Columbia, and one U.S. 
territory. Similarly, the "For the Record" page of the Sports section (which 
features sports scores for both the previous four days of league play and 
individual non-league events, seasonal league statistics and wagering lines 
for the current day's games) also features a rundown of winning numbers 
from the previous deadline date for all participating state lotteries and 
individual multi-state lotteries. Some traditions have been retained, however. 
The lead story still appears on the upper-right hand of the front page. 
Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News 
section. Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section. 
But USA Today is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized 
on sight, even in a mix of other newspapers, such as at a newsstand. The 
overall design and layout of USA Today has been described as neo-Victorian.[36] 
Also, in most of the sections' front pages, on the lower left hand corner, 
are "USA Today Snapshots", which give statistics of various lifestyle interests 
according to the section it is in (for example, a snapshot in "Life" could 
show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based 
upon the type of mood they are in at the time). These "Snapshots" are shown 
through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that 
roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter (using the example above, 
the graph's bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one). 
These are usually loosely based on research by a national institute (with 
the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph). 
The newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called Open 
Air, which launched on March 7, 2008 and appears several times a year. 
Various other advertorials appear throughout the year, mainly on Fridays. 
The opinion section prints USA Today editorials, columns by guest writers 
and members of the Editorial Board of Contributors,[37] letters to the 
editor, and editorial cartoons. One unique feature of the USA Today editorial 
page is the publication of opposing points of view; alongside the editorial 
board's piece on the day's topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer, 
often an expert in the field. The opinion pieces featured in each edition 
are decided by the Board of Contributors, which are separate from the paper's 
news staff.[38] As of 2010[update], the editorial page editor was Brian 
Gallagher, who has worked for the newspaper since its founding in 1982. 
Other members of the Editorial Board included deputy editorial page editor 
Bill Sternberg, executive forum editor John Siniff, op-ed/forum page editor 
Glen Nishimura, operations editor Thuan Le Elston, letters editor Michelle 
Poblete, web content editor Eileen Rivers, and editorial writers Dan Carney, 
George Hager, and Saundra Torry.[39] The newspaper's website calls this 
group "demographically and ideologically diverse."[38] USA Today has traditionally 
maintained a policy not to endorse candidates for the United States Presidency 
or any other state or federal political office, which it has refrained 
from doing since its inception. Since 1984, its political editorials during 
the Presidential election cycle has focused instead on providing opinion 
on major issues relevant to the campaign based on the differing concerns 
of voters, the vast amount of information on ongoing Presidential campaigns, 
and the Board of Contributors' aim to provide a fair viewpoint through 
the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions 
of bias. However, the board re-evaluates its non-endorsement policy through 
an independent process during each four-year election cycle, with any decision 
to circumvent the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than 
two of the editorial board's members dissent or hold differing opinions.[40] 
The editorial board broke from this stance for the first time on September 
29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of 
Republican nominee Donald Trump, calling him "unfit for the presidency" 
due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric (particularly that aimed at military 
veterans, immigrants, and various ethnic and religious groups); his temperament 
and lack of financial transparency; his "checkered" business record; his 
use of false and hyperbolic statements; the inconsistency of his viewpoints 
and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy; and, based on 
comments he has made during his campaign and criticisms by both Democrats 
and Republicans on these views, the potential risks to national security 
and constitutional ethics under a Trump administration, asking voters to 
"resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue".[41] The board noted that 
the piece was not a "qualified endorsement" of Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton, for whom the board was unable to reach a consensus for endorsing 
(some editorial board members expressed that Clinton's public service record 
would help her "serve the nation ably as its president," while others had 
"serious reservations about [her] sense of entitlement, [...] lack of candor 
and [...] extreme carelessness in handling classified information"), instead 
advising voters to decide whether to vote for Clinton, Libertarian nominee 
Gary Johnson, Green Party nominee Jill Stein or a write-in candidate; or 
focus on Senate, House and other down-ballot political races.[42][43][44] 
In May 2012, Larry Kramer – a 40-year media industry veteran and former 
president of CBS Digital Media – was appointed president and publisher 
of USA Today, replacing David Hunke, who had been publisher of the newspaper 
since 2009.[45] Kramer was tasked with developing a new strategy for the 
paper as it sought to increase revenue from its digital operations.[46] 
In July 2012, Kramer hired David Callaway – whom the former had hired as 
lead editor of MarketWatch in 1999, two years after Kramer founded the 
website during his tenure at CBS News – as the paper's editor-in-chief. 
Callaway had previously worked at Bloomberg covering the banking, investment-banking 
and asset-management businesses throughout Europe and at the Boston Herald, 
where he co-wrote a daily financial column on "comings and goings in the 
Boston business district".[47] Conservative activist Peter Gemma has written 
more than 100 op-ed pieces for USA Today.[48] USA Weekend is a defunct 
sister publication that launched in 1953 as Family Weekly, a national weekend 
newsmagazine supplement intended for the Sunday editions of various U.S. 
newspapers; it adopted its final title following Gannett's purchase of 
the magazine in 1985.[49] The magazine – which was distributed to approximately 
800 newspapers nationwide at its peak with most Gannett-owned local newspapers 
carrying it by default within their Sunday editions – focused primarily 
on social issues, entertainment, health, food and travel.[49][50] On December 
5, 2014, Gannett announced that it would cease publishing USA Weekend after 
the December 26–28 edition, citing increasing operational costs and reduced 
advertising revenue, with most of its participating newspapers choosing 
to replace it with competing Sunday magazine Parade.[51][52][53][54] USA 
Today Sports Weekly is a weekly magazine that covers news and statistics 
from Major League Baseball, minor league and NCAA baseball, the National 
Football League (NFL) and NASCAR. It was first published on April 5, 1991 
as USA Today Baseball Weekly, a tabloid-sized baseball-focused publication 
released on Wednesdays, on a weekly basis during the baseball season and 
bi-weekly during the off-season; the magazine expanded its sports coverage 
on September 4, 2002, when it adopted its current title after added stories 
about the NFL. Sports Weekly added coverage of NASCAR on February 15, 2006, 
lasting only during that year's race season; and added coverage of NCAA 
college football on August 8, 2007. The editorial operations of Sports 
Weekly originally operated autonomously from USA Today, before being integrated 
with the newspaper's sports department in late 2005. The Big Lead is a 
sports blog operated by USA Today that was launched in February 2006 by 
original owner Fantasy Sports Ventures (co-founded by Jason McIntyre and 
David Lessa), which was purchased by the Gannett Company – which, beginning 
in April 2008, had maintained a strategic content and marketing partnership 
with the former company – in January 2012.[55] The site – which is usually 
updated on a routine basis of 10 to 15 times per day between 8:00 a.m. 
and 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time – mainly covers sports, but also provides news 
and commentary on other news topics, ranging from politics to pop culture.[56] 
In 1987, Gannett and producer Grant Tinker began developing a newsmagazine 
series for first-run syndication that attempted to bring the breezy style 
of USA Today to television.[57] The result was USA Today: The Television 
Show (later retitled USA Today on TV, then shortened to simply USA Today), 
which premiered on September 12, 1988.[58] Correspondents on the program 
included Edie Magnus, Robin Young, Boyd Matson, Kenneth Walker, Dale Harimoto, 
Ann Abernathy, Bill Macatee and Beth Ruyak. As with the newspaper itself, 
the show was divided into four "sections" corresponding to the different 
parts of the paper: News (focusing on the major headlines of the day), 
Money (focusing on financial news and consumer reports), Sports (focusing 
on sports news and scores) and Life (focusing on entertainment and lifestyle-related 
stories). The series was plagued by low ratings and negative reviews from 
critics throughout its run. The program also suffered from being scheduled 
in undesirable timeslots in certain markets; this was a particular case 
in New York City, the country's largest media market, where CBS owned-and-operated 
station WCBS-TV (channel 2) aired the program in a pre-dawn early morning 
slot, before the program moved to NBC O&O WNBC five months into its run 
in a 9:30 a.m. slot, where it did not fare any better despite being placed 
in a more palatable time period[59] (in contrast, CITY-TV in Toronto, Ontario, 
Canada [now the flagship station of the City television network], ran it 
at 5:00 p.m.).[60]) These setbacks led to the cancellation of the TV version 
of USA Today in November 1989 after one-and-a-half seasons; the final edition 
aired on January 7, 1990.[61] Gannett announced plans to develop a USA 
Today-branded weekly half-hour television program, to have been titled 
"Sports Page", as part of a renewed initiative to extend the brand into 
television; this program, which was tapped for a fall 2004 debut, ultimately 
never launched.[8] VRtually There is a weekly virtual reality news program 
produced by the USA Today Network, which debuted on October 20, 2016. The 
program, which is available on the USA Today mobile app and on YouTube 
(which maintains content exclusivity through the program's dedicated channel 
for 60 days after each broadcast), showcases three original segments outlining 
news stories through a first-person perspective, recorded and produced 
by journalists from USA Today and its co-owned local newspapers. The program 
also incorporates "cubemercials," long-form advertisements created by Gannett's 
in-house creative studio GET Creative, which are designed to allow consumer 
engagenent in fully immersive experiences through virtual reality.[62]
