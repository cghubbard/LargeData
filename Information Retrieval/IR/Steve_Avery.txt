Steven Thomas Avery (born April 14, 1970) is an American former left-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB), perhaps best known for his time 
with the Atlanta Braves in the early to mid 1990s. He also pitched for 
the Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds and Detroit Tigers in his career. Avery 
was the third overall selection by Atlanta in the 1988 amateur draft.[1] 
He made his first career start on June 13, 1990 against the Cincinnati 
Reds at Riverfront Stadium, giving up eight runs in 2 1⁄3 innings.[2] He 
finished his rookie year with a record of 3–11 in 21 starts with a 5.64 
ERA. The pitching staff of Avery, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, and Pete Smith, 
were dubbed Atlanta's "Young Guns".[3] The 1991 season was a good year 
for both Avery and the Braves. The team went from worst to first in the 
NL West while Avery compiled a record of 18–8 with a 3.38 ERA. He gave 
the Braves their first win of the season, a 7–5 victory over the defending 
World Champion Cincinnati Reds. In the heat of a September pennant race 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the 21-year-old Avery beat them twice, 9–1 
at home on September 15,[4] and 3–0 on the road on September 20,[5] pitching 
a complete game both times. Avery's last win of the regular season was 
a stellar performance against the Houston Astros. On October 4, Avery threw 
a no-hitter for 6 2⁄3 innings until Luis Gonzalez broke it up with a single.[6] 
Avery's amazing season continued with one of the greatest postseason performances 
of all-time. He shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates for 16 2⁄3 innings over 
two games and accumulated two 1–0 wins. His performance earned him MVP 
honors for the 1991 NLCS. In the 1991 World Series, Avery earned no decisions 
in two starts but pitched effectively in both Game Three and Game Six. 
In 1992, Avery lowered his ERA to 3.20, but his record fell off to 11–11, 
mostly due to the Braves inability to score runs when he pitched. However, 
his playoff success continued when he took the mound against the Pirates 
in the 1992 NLCS. He extended his mastery over the Pittsburgh offense to 
22 1⁄3 shutout innings before giving up five runs in the seventh inning 
of a Braves rout in Game Two. After lasting only 1⁄3 of an inning and giving 
up four runs in his second start in Game Five, Avery kept the Pirates at 
bay in the crucial middle innings of Game Seven in relief of John Smoltz. 
Avery's clutch performance kept the game close enough for Francisco Cabrera 
to perform his heroics in the ninth inning. Avery started Game Three of 
the 1992 World Series and was the losing pitcher in the first World Series 
game ever played outside the United States. He pitched effectively but 
lost, 3–2, to the Toronto Blue Jays. In Game Six, he was pulled after giving 
up a home run to Candy Maldonado in the fourth inning. Avery appeared on 
his way to another loss, but a Braves rally extended the game into the 
eleventh inning before the Blue Jays prevailed, winning their first World 
Series and saddling the hard-luck Braves with their second consecutive 
World Series defeat. In 1993, Avery had the best season of his career. 
He was selected to the All-Star team and had a record of 16–4 entering 
the September 12, 1993 game against the San Diego Padres. Avery lost and 
suffered an injury to a muscle under his pitching armpit.[7] Many blame 
Avery's injury on his heavy workload as a young pitcher; he had started 
135 major league games before reaching the age of 24. Avery was never again 
the same pitcher, although he ended the year 18–6 with a 2.94 ERA. Avery 
was outpitched early in Game One of the 1993 NLCS by Curt Schilling of 
the Philadelphia Phillies. A late rally tied the game and got Avery off 
the hook, but the Braves still lost. In his second matchup with Schilling, 
the Braves again got Avery off the hook for the loss, but again ultimately 
lost the game in extra innings, 4–3. Avery's career went rapidly downhill 
after his injury. His record after September 12, 1993, was 44–50 after 
compiling a 47–22 record from the beginning of 1991 until the injury. However, 
Avery showed occasional flashes of his previous brilliance. After struggling 
throughout 1995, Avery started Game Four of the 1995 NLCS with the Braves 
up three games to none over the Reds. He pitched an outstanding game and 
won, 6–0, sending Atlanta into the World Series. In Game Four of the 1995 
World Series, he was the surprise starter over ace Greg Maddux, and he 
was also the winner, 5–2, pitching six innings and giving up one run. Avery 
missed two months with injury in 1996 and finished with a 7–10 record. 
His only appearance in the 1996 World Series was in the top of the 10th 
inning of Game Four, a game that saw the Braves blow a 6–0 lead to the 
New York Yankees en route to an 8–6 loss in the game that turned not only 
the series, but the decade of the 1990s in baseball dominance. Pitching 
2⁄3 innings, Avery earned the loss, giving up a hit, a run, and three walks, 
the last of which (to Wade Boggs) forced in the go-ahead run. Atlanta manager 
Bobby Cox earned some criticism at the time owing to his decision to have 
Avery intentionally walk Bernie Williams to load the bases for Boggs.[8] 
With his career in a sudden and premature decline, Avery was granted free 
agency and signed with the Boston Red Sox on January 22, 1997. He pitched 
two years for the Red Sox, going 16–14 over two seasons as the number two 
starter behind Pedro Martínez.[9] He signed a one-year contract with the 
Reds for the 1999 season. He was 6–7 when he was lost for the rest of the 
year in July to a torn labrum.[10] He signed with the Braves during spring 
training in 2000 and again during spring training in 2001, but failed to 
make the club each time. In 2003, Avery made a brief comeback with the 
Detroit Tigers team that threatened to break the 120-loss record of the 
1962 New York Mets. He made 19 relief appearances, including the final 
appearance of his career on July 20, 2003, at U.S. Cellular Field against 
the Chicago White Sox. His final pitch was a double play caused when Paul 
Konerko lined to Avery and he threw Magglio Ordóñez out before he was able 
to get back to first base.[11] In an eleven-season career, Avery posted 
a 96–83 record with 980 strikeouts and a 4.19 ERA in 1554 2⁄3 innings pitched.
