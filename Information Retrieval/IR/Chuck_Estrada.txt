Charles Leonard Estrada (born February 15, 1938 in San Luis Obispo, California) 
is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major 
League Baseball as a pitcher from 1960 to 1967, playing for the Baltimore 
Orioles, Chicago Cubs, and New York Mets. After his retirement from the 
major leagues, Estrada served as pitching coach in the majors. After completing 
high school, Estrada was signed by the Milwaukee Braves as an amateur free 
agent on September 27, 1956. Prior to the start of the 1958 season, Estrada 
was sent from the Braves to the Baltimore Orioles in an unknown transaction.[1] 
Chuck made his major league debut with the Orioles two seasons later, on 
April 21, 1960, in front of a crowd of 9,377 at Memorial Stadium.[2] Estrada 
came in relief for starting pitcher Steve Barber in the 5th inning, and 
pitched two innings of one-hit ball with five strikeouts.[2] Estrada spent 
the beginning of the 1960 season coming in relief, but he later joined 
the young Orioles starting pitching rotation, which also featured Steve 
Barber, Milt Pappas, Jerry Walker and Jack Fisher. Estrada's rookie season 
was perhaps the best season of his career. He pitched in a total of thirty-six 
games, and started twenty-five of them. He tied with Jim Perry for the 
American League lead with 18 wins that season. Only four other pitchers 
since 1900 had led their respective league without winning more than twenty 
games in the season.[3] Estrada also was on top of the American League 
in hits allowed per nine innings, and finished with a twelve complete games, 
144 strikeouts and a 3.58 earned run average.[1] The All-Star Estrada finished 
second in the 1960 Rookie of the Year voting, falling distantly behind 
Orioles teammate Ron Hansen.[4] He placed 12th in the American League Most 
Valuable Player Award voting,[4] but he did win the year's TSN Pitcher 
of the Year Award.[5] Estrada also was on the Topps All-Star Rookie Roster 
under the category of right-handed pitcher. Estrada had another successful 
season in 1961, pitching in thirty three games for the Orioles. He had 
a 15-9 record, a 3.69 earned run average and 160 strikeouts in 212 innings 
of work. He again led the league in hits allowed per nine innings. However, 
Estrada again showed signs of wild pitching, as he issued a league-high 
132 walks, thirty-one higher than that of his rookie season. He again placed 
second in the league by hitting ten batters in the season, finishing only 
one lower than the leader, Jim Kaat, of the Minnesota Twins. The next season 
was disastrous for Estrada, as he led the league with seventeen losses. 
He only collected nine wins on the season, and his ERA ballooned to 3.83. 
He had 121 walks in 223.3 innings, finishing a close second behind Los 
Angeles Angels rookie southpaw Bo Belinsky. Estrada's woes did not end, 
though. The following season, Estrada pitched in only eight games during 
the season. On June 8, 1963, Estrada suffered an elbow injury with bone 
chips and a spur in his right elbow, and was done for the season.[6] The 
following season, Estrada came in as a relief/starting pitcher for the 
Orioles. It seemed the elbow injury had affected Estrada's pitching. He 
pitched only 54.7 innings that season, but he posted a 3-2 record with 
a 5.27 ERA. Estrada did not pitch the following season, and he was sent 
to the California Angels by the Orioles as part of a conditional deal two 
months prior to the start of the 1966 season.[1] Just weeks into the 1966 
season, he was returned by the Angels to the Orioles.[1] A day later, he 
was sent packing again, this time to the Chicago Cubs.[7] The Cubs gave 
Estrada a shot as a starting pitcher on June 14, 1966, but he pitched less 
than an inning, giving up three hits and four earned runs and also hitting 
a batter.[8] The Cubs then sent him to the bullpen and used him in relief 
for the remainder of the 1966 season. His stats only worsened, as he pitched 
a career-worst 7.30 ERA in only 12.3 innings of work. The 28-year-old Estrada 
was released by the Cubs on November 30, 1966.[7] That same day, he was 
picked up by the New York Mets as a free agent.[7] The first game Estrada 
pitched as a Met was on April 13, 1967. Estrada came in the sixth inning 
to relieve Tom Seaver on his major league debut, and Estrada pitched two 
innings of hitless ball. He picked up the win in the first start of Tom 
Seaver's Hall-of-Fame career.[9] However, the rest of the season did not 
fare as nicely. In 22 innings of work, Estrada gave up 28 hits, walked 
17 batters, and had a 9.41 ERA. So ended Estrada's major league baseball 
career as a player. After retiring from the majors, Estrada found employment 
in the majors again, but this time as a pitching coach.[6] He served as 
pitching coach for the Texas Rangers (1973),[10][11] San Diego Padres (1978â€“1981),[7]
