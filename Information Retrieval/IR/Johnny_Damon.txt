Johnny David Damon (born November 5, 1973) is a retired American professional 
baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1995 
to 2012. In his MLB career, Damon played for the Kansas City Royals (1995–2000), 
Oakland Athletics (2001), Boston Red Sox (2002–05), New York Yankees (2006–09), 
Detroit Tigers (2010), Tampa Bay Rays (2011) and Cleveland Indians (2012). 
Damon also played for the Thailand national baseball team and was a member 
of the squad for the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifiers. Damon was 
born in Fort Riley, an Army base in Kansas.[1] His mother, Yome, was a 
Thai immigrant to America, and his father, Jimmy, is an American of Croatian 
and Irish descent.[2] They met while his father, a staff sergeant in the 
United States Army, was stationed in Thailand. Damon spent much of his 
infancy as an "army brat", moving to several bases from Okinawa, Japan, 
to West Germany before his father left the army and settled the family 
in the Orlando area while Damon was still a pre-schooler.[3] Damon was 
a quiet child, largely on account of a fluency disorder. "My thoughts just 
raced ahead of my tongue", says Damon of his problem then.[when?] "I'd 
sing songs as therapy, and I got better, but I still just kept quiet most 
of the time."[4] He played in South Orange Little League as a child. Damon 
attended Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando when during his senior year 
in 1992, he was rated the top high school prospect in the country by Baseball 
America, was named to USA Today's High School All-America team, and was 
the Florida Gatorade Player of the Year. Damon also played football in 
high school, once getting hit by Warren Sapp and sustaining the first concussion 
in his life.[5] Damon was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the first 
round (35th overall) of the 1992 amateur draft. He made his Major League 
debut on August 12, 1995 after playing the previous season with the minor 
league Wichita Wranglers. He played for the Royals from 1995 to 2000. He 
scored 104 runs in 1998 and 101 runs in 1999. One of his best seasons came 
in 2000 when he led the American League in runs with 136 and stolen bases 
with 46, as he was second in hits (214), at bats (655), and plate appearances 
(741). Damon spent 2001 with the Oakland Athletics. In a three-way trade 
involving the A's, Royals, and Tampa Bay Devil Rays, the A's received Damon 
along with pitcher Cory Lidle from the Devil Rays and second baseman Mark 
Ellis from the Royals. He was third in the league in at bats (644) and 
seventh in runs (108). On December 21, 2001, Damon signed a four-year, 
$31 million contract with the Boston Red Sox.[6] In 2002, he led the league 
in triples (11) and was third in infield hits (25), becoming the first 
player selected by the fans in the inaugural American League All-Star Final 
Vote.[7] On June 27, 2003, Damon became only the second major leaguer since 
1900 to record three base hits in an inning, when he did so against the 
Florida Marlins.[8] Also, Damon suffered a head-on collision with Damian 
Jackson. He had a concussion, while Jackson walked off the field fine. 
In 2004, Damon was second in the league in runs (123) and began to re-establish 
himself among the premier lead-off hitters and center fielders in the game. 
In arguably his best season in the Major Leagues, Damon batted .304 with 
20 home runs and 94 RBIs and showed improved patience at the plate. According 
to his autobiography, he was only the fourth leadoff batter in the history 
of Major League Baseball to drive in more than 90 runs in a season. In 
Game 7 of the 2004 ALCS, Damon hit two home runs, one of which was a grand 
slam, to lead the Red Sox to victory over the Yankees. In the 2004 World 
Series, he also hit a home run as the Red Sox won the series against the 
St. Louis Cardinals in a four-game sweep. Through his four-year career 
with the Red Sox (2002–2005), Damon appeared in 597 games (590 in center 
field and seven as a designated hitter)[9] and hit 56 home runs.[10] Of 
his 2,476 at bats, 2,259 were as leadoff hitter. Damon batted second in 
the lineup for 156 at-bats in 2002, accounting for nearly all of the rest 
except for occasional pinch hit. He started two games as the third hitter 
in 2004, and in 2005, he had 624 at-bats, and all but three as the lead-off 
hitter. He also earned his second All-Star selection, starting as the American 
League's center fielder.[11] He led the AL with 35 infield hits,[12] and 
matched the 35 doubles he'd hit in 2004.[10] On December 20, 2005, Damon 
signed a four-year, $52 million contract with the New York Yankees.[6] 
The Red Sox stood firm on a three-year contract and chose not to negotiate 
against a five-year deal proposed by agent Scott Boras. Damon's signing 
with the Yankees led to his being subsequently vilified by many Red Sox 
fans because of his previously professed loyalty to the city and Red Sox 
organization, including his now infamous statement in May 2005, where he 
claimed, "There's no way I can go play for the Yankees, but I know they're 
going to come after me hard. It's definitely not the most important thing 
to go out there for the top dollar, which the Yankees are going to offer 
me. It's not what I need."[13] As the Yankees have a strict dress code 
for players forbidding both long hair and facial hair beyond neat mustaches, 
Damon had his shoulder-length "cave man" hair cut and beard shaved on December 
22. Damon, who had a clean-cut appearance until his third season with the 
Red Sox, had been planning on cutting his hair and shaving his beard off 
even if he didn't sign with the Yankees, but waited until after he signed 
with them in order to prevent speculation.[14][15][16] The following season, 
in a pivotal five game series in August between the Yankees and Red Sox 
at Fenway Park, Damon went 3-for-6 in each of the first three games, including 
a doubleheader on August 18, and a game on August 19. Damon hit two home 
runs, drove in eight runs, and scored eight runs in the first three games 
as the Yankees won by a combined score of 39–20 and dealt a severe blow 
to the Red Sox 2006 play-off aspirations. In 2006, Damon finished 3rd in 
runs (115) and 9th in stolen bases (25) in the AL, while hitting 24 home 
runs, his career high. He also tied his mark of 35 doubles from the previous 
two seasons.[10] He was only one of 4 players in the major leagues to hit 
at least 24 home runs and steal at least 24 bases. On June 7, 2008, Damon 
went 6 for 6 in the Yankees 12–11 win over the Kansas City Royals, including 
a walk-off ground-rule double, which had bounced over the wall. He is the 
first Yankee to have six hits in a 9 inning game since Myril Hoag accomplished 
the feat in 1934.[17] Damon said in a post-game on-field interview that 
this was his first walk-off as a Yankee. The Yankees placed Damon on the 
15-day disabled list for the first time in his MLB career on July 6, 2008 
with a bruised AC joint in his left shoulder. The injury occurred a day 
earlier when Damon collided with the outfield wall in an attempt to catch 
a triple. At that time, Damon was one of only three active major league 
ballplayers who had played at least 10 years in the majors without going 
on the disabled list. He returned to active duty, and hit 27 doubles for 
the season.[10] Damon hit 53 home runs in his three complete seasons with 
the Yankees.[10] On July 27, 2009, Damon hit his 200th career home run 
against the Tampa Bay Rays' Brian Shouse. For the 2009 season, he batted 
.282, and tied for the lead among American League left fielders in errors 
(with 5), while he was 4th in the league in runs scored (107).[1] Johnny 
Damon hit a home run in Games 3 and 4 of the 2009 ALCS, defeating the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 6 games. When the Yankees went on to play 
the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2009 World Series, Damon got credit for 
stealing two bases in one play when the Phillies defense was shifted against 
batter Mark Teixeira. Damon got his second championship ring as the Yankees 
would eventually defeat the Phillies in 6 games. Damon, after winning his 
second World Series, entered free agency after the 2009 season despite 
expressing his desire to return to the Yankees.[18] He insisted that the 
Yankees not even make him an offer, however, unless they pay him at least 
the $13 million he earned for the past four years.[18] As a result of his 
contract demands, the Yankees signed 1B/DH Nick Johnson to a one-year/5.5MM 
deal, despite Damon lowering his salary demands at the last minute.[19] 
The Yankees then signed outfielder Randy Winn to a one-year $2 million[20] 
deal which essentially closed the door on Damon's return to the Bronx.[21] 
On February 22, 2010, Damon agreed to a one-year, $8 million deal with 
the Detroit Tigers. On April 14, 2010, he recorded his 1,000th career RBI 
against the Kansas City Royals. On May 1, he hit a walk-off home run against 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim pitcher Scot Shields at Comerica Park to 
win the game 3–2. On July 6, Damon recorded his 2,500th career hit off 
Jake Arrieta of the Baltimore Orioles, and hit a walk-off home run off 
David Hernandez, giving the Tigers a 7–5 win. For the season, he batted 
.271,[22] and became a free agent at the end of the season. On January 
21, 2011, Damon agreed to a one-year, $5.25 million deal with the Tampa 
Bay Rays. The Rays also signed his former Boston Red Sox teammate Manny 
Ramirez in a package deal suggested by agent Scott Boras.[23][24] Also 
reunited with Damon was former Red Sox player Kelly Shoppach. Manager Joe 
Maddon said he expected the 37-year-old Damon to often be replaced by Sam 
Fuld during the season late in games that the Rays are leading.[25] After 
Ramirez's abrupt retirement, this would be moot as Damon primarily would 
play as the designated hitter. On April 16, 2011, Damon had the game-winning 
hit for the fifth consecutive game for the Rays, two of which were walk-off 
hits. On June 29, 2011 Damon tied Ted Williams for 71st on the all-time 
hit list with 2,654 hits. The hit came at Tropicana Field in the bottom 
of the 6th inning. On July 2, 2011, Damon went 4-for-4 and his first-inning 
single moved him past Ted Williams on the all-time hit list. He would finish 
the season 57th all-time with 2,723 career hits. In Game 1 of the ALDS, 
Damon hit a 2-run home run in the 2nd inning off Texas Rangers starting 
pitcher C. J. Wilson to give his team an early 2–0 lead. The Rays won the 
game 9–0, however they eventually lost the best-of-five divisional series 
3–1.[26] On April 12, 2012, Damon signed a one-year minor league contract 
with the Cleveland Indians for $1.25 million (and an additional $1.4 million 
in incentives).[27] On May 1, Damon was called up to Cleveland.[28] He 
made his debut on May 2, batting leadoff against the Chicago White Sox.[29] 
He finished the game 0–3 with a walk.[30] Indians manager Manny Acta dropped 
Damon to seventh in the batting lineup after going 4–29 in the leadoff 
position, including 2 hits in his last 18 at-bats.[31] On June 26, in a 
game against the Yankees, Damon became the 52nd player in MLB history to 
amass 2,750 career hits. Heading into the All-Star break, Damon had 35 
hits in 163 official at-bats and was hitting .215 in 50 games.[32] On July 
20, Damon tied a season-high with three hits versus the Baltimore Orioles.[33] 
Damon was designated for assignment on August 3, 2012.[34] He was released 
by the Indians, along with pitchers Derek Lowe and Jeremy Accardo, on August 
9.[35] Damon hoped to be signed for 2013, and offered the Yankees the opportunity 
to sign him to a contract for the league's minimum salary as a replacement 
for the injured Curtis Granderson, also expressing a willingness to be 
released once Granderson returned. The Yankees indicated that they were 
not interested in signing Damon. Damon remained unsigned for all of 2013, 
and did not play.[36] In late 2013 and early 2014 Damon indicated a desire 
to keep playing, in part to have the opportunity to attain 3,000 hits. 
(He needed 231 to reach that goal.) He told members of the media that he 
has stayed in good physical condition and hoped to receive invitations 
to spring training.[37][38] Damon did not receive any offers prior to the 
start of the 2014 season. In a May 2014 interview while in Boston to celebrate 
the 10th anniversary of the Red Sox 2004 World Series championship, Damon 
indicated that he has no plans to officially announce his retirement, even 
though he acknowledged that he will likely not play in the major leagues 
again. He also stated that he still wants to play, has continued to stay 
in good physical condition, and could play if given the opportunity, saying 
"I feel like if a team calls me, I can be ready. If I play tonight, I'll 
hit a homer."[39] On June 22, 2014, he played in his first New York Yankees 
Old-Timers' Day. A July 2014 press report indicated that Damon still hopes 
to play again in the major leagues. According to the story, in June Damon 
completed an impromptu session with a batting practice pitcher for the 
Philadelphia Phillies, who was impressed enough to suggest that the Phillies 
should consider signing him.[40] On August 4, 2014 Damon gave an interview 
with the WEEI-FM radio show "Middays with MFB" and indicated that while 
he wants to still play, no teams have expressed an interest, and "those 
days are over".[41] According to press accounts in December 2014, Damon 
hoped to play in 2015, and his agent told a reporter "If you ask Johnny, 
he'd love to come back."[42] In 2005, Damon wrote Idiot: Beating "The Curse" 
and Enjoying the Game of Life with Peter Golenbock. Damon contributed backing 
vocals to Dropkick Murphys' 2004 single "Tessie." Damon hosted WWE Raw 
on December 21, 2009.[43] Damon participated in the Celebrity Apprentice 
competition in the spring of 2014 in New York City. The shows that he filmed 
were part of the 2015 season of the show. He was eliminated from the show 
on the episode which aired on February 2, 2015.[44] Damon has also appeared 
on the Animal Planet show Tanked. Damon married his high school sweetheart, 
Angela Vannice, in 1992 when he was 19. They had twins (Jackson and Madelyn) 
together in 1999[45] before divorcing in 2002. In 2004, Damon married Michelle 
Mangan, who gave birth to their first daughter, Devon Rose, in 2007.[46] 
Damon and Mangan welcomed their second daughter, Danica Rayne, in 2008.[47] 
Mangan gave birth to twin girls in June 2012 Dasha and Daliah. In April 
2015 they welcomed their 5th daughter Dreanna Michelle.[48] Damon and Michelle 
are expecting a 6th child, the boy is going to be named Dash, as revealed 
in the Tanked episode on April 22, 2016.[49] Damon and his family reside 
in Windermere, Florida. While with the Yankees, Damon and his wife lived 
in Cresskill, New Jersey.[50] He is active with the Wounded Warrior Project, 
which works to raise awareness and enlist the public's aid for the needs 
of severely injured service men and women. Damon has appeared on MTV Cribs 
where he gave a tour of his home near Orlando, Florida. Damon was one of 
the victims of the $8 billion fraud perpetrated by convicted wealth manager
