Earl Moore (July 29, 1879 – November 28, 1961) was a professional baseball 
pitcher who had a 14-year career in Major League Baseball. Moore's sidearm 
throwing style earned him the nickname "crossfire". His contract was purchased 
by the Cleveland Blues from Dayton, Ohio for $1000. On May 9, 1901, he 
pitched the American League's first no-hitter, only to lose the game in 
the tenth inning. He was also the first pitcher in the 20th century to 
lose a no-hit game. In 1903, he led the league with a 1.77 ERA, going 19–9. 
He was traded to the New York Highlanders in 1907, and then to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in 1908. He won a career-high 22 games for the Phillies in 1910, 
leading the league in strikeouts. He lost 19 games the following year. 
In 1913, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs. His career record was 161–154
