Manuel Arístides "Manny" Ramírez Onelcida (born May 30, 1972) is a Dominican-American 
professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for parts of 19 seasons. He played with the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red 
Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, and Tampa Bay Rays before 
playing one season in the Chinese Professional Baseball League. Ramirez 
is recognized for having had great batting skill and power. He was a nine-time 
Silver Slugger and was one of 25 players to hit 500 career home runs. His 
21 grand slams are third all-time, and his 29 postseason home runs are 
the most in MLB history. He appeared in 12 All-Star Games, with a streak 
of eleven consecutive games beginning in 1998 that included every season 
that he played with the Red Sox.[1] Ramirez was born in Santo Domingo, 
Dominican Republic. When he was 13 years old, he moved to New York City 
with his parents, Onelcida and Aristides. He attended George Washington 
High School and became a baseball standout. He was drafted by the Cleveland 
Indians in the first round of the 1991 MLB draft, 13th overall. He made 
his MLB debut on September 2, 1993. In 1994, Ramirez became a major league 
regular, and finished second in voting for the Rookie of the Year Award. 
By 1995, he had become an All-Star. He was with the Indians in playoff 
appearances in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999; this included an appearance 
in the 1995 and 1997 World Series. In 1999, Ramirez set the Indians' single-season 
RBIs record with 165 RBIs. After the 2000 season, Ramirez signed with the 
Boston Red Sox. During his time in Boston, Ramirez and teammate David Ortiz 
became one of the best offensive tandems in baseball history. Ramirez led 
the Red Sox to World Series Championships in 2004 and 2007 before being 
traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008 as part of a three team deal 
that also involved the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 2009 Ramirez was suspended 
50 games for violating baseball's drug policy by taking human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG), a women's fertility drug that is often taken after 
steroids.[2] In the spring of 2011, Ramirez was informed by MLB of another 
violation of its drug policy,[3] which would result in a 100-game suspension.[4] 
He chose to retire on April 8 rather than face a 100-game suspension.[4][5] 
However, in September 2011, Ramirez wished to be reinstated and agreed 
in December with the league to a reduced 50-game suspension. Though he 
played at various points in the Oakland Athletics, Texas Rangers, and Chicago 
Cubs systems, as well as internationally, Ramirez did not appear in another 
Major League game. Known as a complete hitter who could hit for both power 
and average, and widely regarded as one of the best right handed hitters 
of his generation, Ramirez finished his career with a lifetime .312 batting 
average, 555 home runs (15th all time), and 1831 RBI (18th all time). Ramirez 
was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and spent thirteen years 
living there. As a child, Ramirez was obsessed with baseball. When he was 
eight years old, his grandmother got him a Dodgers uniform with the number 
30 on the back, which he considers to be one of his most prized possessions.[6] 
In 1985, he moved to the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City 
with his parents.[6] He would often play ball at the nearby Snake Hill, 
the same place Lou Gehrig played during his childhood.[6] Despite living 
just a short distance from Yankee Stadium, Ramirez rooted for the Toronto 
Blue Jays and would watch games when the Blue Jays were in town.[6] Ramirez 
attended George Washington High School from 1987 to 1991, leaving at the 
age of 19 without graduating.[7] During his time on the team, GWHS was 
seeing a large increase in the number of immigrants. This was apparent, 
as GWHS's baseball team was composed entirely of Dominicans.[8] As a youth, 
Ramirez preferred to not be the center of attention and was often very 
modest.[8] During his time at GWHS, he led his team to three straight division 
championships.[6] He was a three-time all-city selection in baseball, and 
as a high school senior was named New York City Public School Player of 
the Year in 1991, hitting for a .650 batting average with 14 home runs 
in 22 games.[8] He was inducted into the New York City Public School Athletic 
Hall of Fame in 1999.[9] The Cleveland Indians selected Ramirez with the 
13th pick of the 1991 draft and assigned him to the Rookie-level Burlington 
Indians for his professional debut.[10] He was named the Appalachian League 
MVP and was selected by Baseball America as short-season Player of the 
Year while slugging 19 homers and driving in 63 runs in 59 games, while 
leading the league in slugging and total bases.[10] With the Single-A Kinston 
Indians in 1992, Ramirez battled injuries but still hit .278 with 13 homers 
and 63 RBIs in 81 games and was named as the number three prospect and 
the "Most Exciting Player in the Carolina League" by Baseball America.[10][11] 
In 1993, Ramirez was named "Minor League Player of the Year" by Baseball 
America while hitting .333 with 31 homers and 115 RBIs in 129 combined 
games with the Double-A Canton–Akron Indians and Triple-A Charlotte Knights.[10][11] 
Ramirez made his major league debut on September 2, 1993 against the Minnesota 
Twins, going hitless in four at bats as the designated hitter. The following 
day, when the Indians took on the New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 
4 with his first two home runs, with many of his family and friends in 
attendance at Yankee Stadium.[1][12] His first career home run was hit 
against Mélido Pérez.[13] However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit 
off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats 
as left fielder Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the 
seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning 
to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill 
in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats. 
In 1994, his first full season in the majors, Ramirez had a strong start 
to the season, hitting six home runs during the month of April.[6] Despite 
a weak start to May, he rebounded in the latter half of the month, finishing 
the month with a .300 batting average.[6] During the season, the Indians 
were chasing the Chicago White Sox for first place in the American League 
Central (AL Central) division all the way until the end of the season. 
However, the team fell short of qualifying for the playoffs and their season 
ended in August due to the 1994 MLB strike.[6] Ramirez finished second 
in the Rookie of the Year award voting after batting .269 with 17 home 
runs and 60 RBIs in 91 games.[1] Ramirez's breakout season came in 1995, 
when he batted .308 with 31 home runs and 107 RBIs. In July, he was selected 
to his first All-Star Game and won his first career Silver Slugger Award 
following the season.[1] That year, the Indians reached the postseason, 
and Ramirez hit two home runs in the 1995 American League Championship 
Series against the Mariners, which the Indians won in six games. The Indians 
then took on the Atlanta Braves in the World Series, and Ramirez batted 
.222 with one home run in the Indians' six-game loss.[1] In December 1995, 
Ramirez agreed to a $10.15 million, four-year contract.[14] Ramirez continued 
to hit well in 1996, batting .309 with 33 home runs and 112 RBIs. The Indians 
again reached the playoffs, and Ramirez batted .375 with 2 home runs in 
the Indians' loss to the Orioles in the 1996 American League Division Series.[1] 
In 1997, Ramirez's contact continued to improve, though his power dipped 
slightly, as he hit .328 with 26 home runs and 88 RBIs. This year, the 
Indians again reached the World Series, and Ramirez batted .154 with two 
home runs as the Indians lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games.[1] 
In 1998, Ramirez experienced a great increase in power, on his way to becoming 
one of the great run producers in the game. He batted .294 with 45 home 
runs and 145 RBIs, and was selected to his second All-Star Game, where 
he recorded a sacrifice fly and RBI.[15] Ramirez batted .357 with 2 home 
runs during the ALDS versus the Red Sox, which the Indians won in four 
games. In the ALCS against the Yankees, Ramirez batted .333 with two home 
runs, but the Indians lost in six games.[1] Following the season, Ramirez 
came in sixth place in AL MVP voting.[16] Ramirez began 1999 on a hot streak, 
hitting .337 with 7 home runs in the month of April. Ramirez's hot hitting 
continued all season, as he batted .364 in May and reached the All-Star 
break with 25 home runs and 96 RBIs.[17] At the time, it was the third 
highest single season total for RBI by the All-Star Break in MLB history, 
behind only Hank Greenberg (103 in 1935) and Juan González (101 in 1998). 
On September 30, 1999, Ramirez broke the Indians' single-season RBI record 
(previously 162 by Hal Trosky in 1936) by hitting a 3-run home run, giving 
Ramirez 164.[18] He finished 1999 with 165 RBIs, the highest total by any 
player since Jimmie Foxx (1938), and batted an eye popping .383 against 
left handed pitchers. He also batted .383 with runners in scoring position, 
and .377 with men on base.[1] That season, he finished third in the voting 
for the AL MVP award.[19] However, he struggled in the 1999 postseason, 
going 1-for-18 as the Indians were eliminated by the Boston Red Sox in 
5 games in the 1999 American League Division Series. In 2000, Ramirez was 
limited to 118 games due to injuries, but recorded a career-high .351 batting 
average, along with 38 home runs and 122 RBIs.[1] His return is believed 
to have started a major comeback that led the Indians to a final record 
of 90–72 and cut the number of games they were behind the leader of the 
AL Central, the Chicago White Sox, from 11.5 games down to 7.5 games in 
just a month.[20] Because of his return, Roberto Alomar, Omar Vizquel, 
and Kenny Lofton all started getting better pitches to hit, which also 
significantly increased their batting averages.[20] Despite the comeback, 
the Indians failed to make the postseason, finishing 5 games behind the 
White Sox in the AL Central.[21] With free agency looming, Ramirez homered 
in what would be his final game and at-bat in an Indians uniform, on October 
1 against Toronto in front of the home fans at Jacobs Field. In November 
2000, the Indians offered Ramirez a seven-year, $119 million contract. 
While this would have made Ramirez the highest-paid player in baseball, 
the deal was rejected by Ramirez and his agent, Jeff Moorad, who were seeking 
a ten-year, $200 million contract.[22] Ramirez was reportedly pursued by 
the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners, but in December agreed to an 
eight-year, $160 million deal with the Boston Red Sox, with $20 million 
options for 2009 and 2010, pushing the total value of the contract to $200 million 
for 10 years.[23] Ramirez immediately delivered for the Red Sox, hitting 
.408 in April 2001. He had another sterling first half, amassing a .335 
batting average with 26 home runs and 84 RBI at the 2001 All-Star break. 
However, he missed some time battling hamstring injuries and struggled 
down the stretch, finishing at .306 with 41 home runs and 125 RBI. On June 
23, Ramirez hit two monstrous home runs against the Toronto Blue Jays at 
Fenway Park, with the second one hitting the very top of the light tower 
in left field. Its length was officially listed at 501 feet,[24] second-longest 
by a Red Sox player in Fenway Park's history, just short of Ted Williams' 
1946 record of 502 feet.[25] He also launched a prodigious home run in 
an away game on June 3 against the Blue Jays into the fifth deck at the 
SkyDome, which still stands as the longest home run in that ballpark's 
history at 491 feet. However, despite his efforts, the Red Sox did not 
qualify for the MLB postseason in 2001. Ramirez only played in 120 games 
in 2002 due to a hamstring injury that put him on the disabled list (DL) 
from mid-May to the end of June.[6] Despite this, Ramirez won the AL batting 
title, hitting .349 (including .438 against lefties), and his .647 slugging 
percentage was second in the league behind Jim Thome's .677. Like clockwork, 
Ramirez again reached the 30 home run and 100 RBI plateaus, posting 33 
and 107 respectively. He hit his 300th career home run on August 26 against 
the Angels' Ramón Ortiz. It was the first of two home runs on the night 
for Ramirez, as he went 5-for-5 overall. However, the Red Sox again failed 
to qualify for the MLB postseason in 2002. In 2003, Ramirez again posted 
strong offensive numbers, finishing with a .325 average, 37 home runs, 
and 104 RBI. The second half surge of fellow Dominican slugger David Ortiz 
gave the Red Sox a formidable one-two punch in the middle of the lineup 
with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with 
pharyngitis,[6] but got into hot water as he was spotted in a bar in the 
hotel where he lived with a close friend, Yankees infielder Enrique Wilson, 
despite being supposedly too ill to play in the series against the rival 
Yankees. Boston manager Grady Little benched Ramirez for one game as a 
result.[26] Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, 
qualifying for the MLB postseason for the first time with Ramirez. In the 
decisive fifth game of their Division Series matchup against the Oakland 
Athletics, Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three-run 
homer off Barry Zito that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. 
In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early 
in the game, Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez had hit Yankees outfielder 
Karim Garcia up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard 
slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman Todd Walker had exacerbated 
the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens threw 
a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking 
the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play 
in the ALCS against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell 
to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on Aaron Boone's infamous extra-inning, 
walk-off home run.[27] During the offseason that followed, the new Red 
Sox ownership (led by John W. Henry) and management tried to rid themselves 
of Ramirez's massive contract, despite his high level of production to 
date. Believed to be necessary in pursuit of a trade for Texas Rangers 
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, the team put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers, 
thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of 
his contract. However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to 
claim Ramirez due to the high cost,[28] and Rodriguez was acquired by the 
Yankees instead, rather ironically as a replacement for Boone after the 
latter had blown out his knee playing offseason basketball. Also noteworthy 
from 2003 (though it would not be revealed until 2009), according to the 
New York Times, Ramirez tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs 
that season from the "survey" drug test, in which MLB players were tested 
to see if drugs were being used. Players faced no penalties or sanctions 
for testing positive.[29] Ramirez was one of 104 players to have allegedly 
tested positive. In 2004, Ramirez led the AL in home runs (43), slugging 
percentage (.613) and OPS (1.009); he finished second in errors committed 
as a left fielder (7), third in RBIs (130), fourth in doubles (44) and 
total bases (348), sixth in on-base percentage (.397), eighth in walks 
(82), tenth in runs (108), and posted a .308 batting average.[1] He also 
led the AL in salary, at $22.5 million.[1] In addition, Ramirez and teammate 
David Ortiz became the first pair of AL teammates to hit 40 home runs, 
have 100 RBIs, and bat .300 since the Yankees' Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig 
in 1931.[30] Together they hit back-to-back home runs six times, tying 
the major league single-season mark set by the Detroit Tigers' Hank Greenberg 
and Rudy York and later matched by the Chicago White Sox's Frank Thomas 
and Magglio Ordóñez.[30] In the 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, 
Ramirez hit a two-run home run off Roger Clemens in the top of the first 
inning, giving his teammates a 3–0 lead.[31] Ramirez, Derek Jeter (with 
a single), Ichiro Suzuki (with a double) and Iván Rodríguez (with a triple) 
became the first All-Star quartet to hit for the cycle during the same 
inning.[31] The Red Sox again qualified for the postseason, and Ramirez 
continued his hot hitting. He hit .385 in the 2004 ALDS, leading the Red 
Sox to a sweep over the Anaheim Angels, and setting up a rematch in the 
2004 American League Championship Series against the Yankees. Despite not 
driving in a run in the ALCS, Ramirez hit .300 as the Red Sox completed 
a historic comeback from down 3 games to 0 to win in seven against the 
Yankees, setting up a showdown with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 
World Series. Ramirez proceeded to hit .412 with a home run and 4 RBI in 
a 4-game sweep of the Cardinals, as the Red Sox won their first title since 
1918. The home run came in the first inning of Game 3, off Cardinals starter 
Jeff Suppan, continuing a streak where the Red Sox scored in the first 
inning of each game in the series. Ramirez's 2004 season was capped off 
by being named World Series MVP.[31] On May 15, 2005, Ramirez hit his 400th 
home run off Gil Meche of the Seattle Mariners. On July 5, Ramirez hit 
his 20th career grand slam — and his third of the season — off Chris Young 
of the Texas Rangers. On defense, however, he tied for the lead among all 
major league left fielders in errors, with 7.[32] He posted his highest 
single season RBI total as a Red Sox in 2005, driving in 144 runs to go 
along with his 45 homers, but he batted "only" .292, his first time under 
.300 since 1998. Along with teammate David Ortiz, who drove in 148 runs, 
the duo combined to drive in an outstanding 292 runs. Ortiz would finish 
second, and Ramirez fourth, in MVP voting to winner Alex Rodriguez. Off 
the field, the season was one of much conflict for Ramirez.[33] Persistent 
trade rumors (generally involving the New York Mets) dogged him all season.[33] 
After the Red Sox were eliminated in the first round of that year's playoffs 
by the eventual World Series champion Chicago White Sox, Ramirez once again 
expressed a wish to be traded.[34] This included a threat to not show up 
for spring training if his latest demand was not met by Red Sox GM Theo 
Epstein.[34] Toward this end, in December 2005, Ramirez put his Ritz-Carlton 
condominium up for sale.[35] Trade rumors circulated with Ramirez possibly 
going to the Baltimore Orioles or the New York Mets, but no deal was reached. 
By January 5, 2006, Ramirez changed his mind, stating that he was dropping 
the demand.[36] His agents, in turn, insisted their client was still open 
to a trade.[37] But no deal materialized. On June 10, 2006, Ramirez became 
the 31st player in history to hit 450 home runs, with a solo home run off 
Francisco Cordero of the Texas Rangers.[citation needed] Three weeks later, 
on July 1, he collected his 2000th hit.[38] Beginning in mid-July, he had 
a 28-game hitting streak, including 12 multi-hit games, 8 HR, and 28 RBIs. 
He reached 100 RBI for the 9th consecutive season on August 20 in a series 
against the Yankees, but missed 28 games from mid-August on with soreness 
in his right knee.[39] Ramirez finished at .321 with 35 home runs and 102 
RBI. He also drew a career high 100 walks in 2006, the only time in his 
career he reached that mark. However, the Red Sox missed the playoffs for 
the first time since the 2002 season. On April 22, 2007, Ramirez was the 
first of four Red Sox batters to homer in consecutive at bats in a game 
against the New York Yankees pitcher Chase Wright, tying a league record 
when J.D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek followed Ramirez with longballs 
of their own.[40][40] On April 29, Ramirez became the fifth player to hit 
50 career home runs against the Yankees.[41] Ramirez finished 2007 with 
a .296 batting average, 20 home runs, and 88 RBIs, ending his streak of 
30 home run and 100 RBI seasons at 9.[1] His season was cut short when 
he strained his left oblique in late August during a Yankees series, but 
he did return to the lineup for the final homestand of the season.[6] In 
2007, he had the highest fielding percentage (.990) among left fielders 
in the AL,[42] tied for second in the major leagues; he was ranked sixth-highest 
in range factor of all AL left fielders, 1.72,[43] 16th in both leagues, 
but had the lowest zone rating among MLB left fielders with 100+ games 
(.713).[44] He made two errors during the 2007 season in left field,[45] 
and tied for fifth overall in the major leagues in assists from left field.[45] 
In the postseason, Ramirez hit a walk-off three-run home run in Game 2 
of the American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim.[46] In the fourth inning of the series' final game, Ramirez combined 
with teammate David Ortiz to hit back-to-back home runs off pitcher Jered 
Weaver.[46] The home run tied him with Bernie Williams for first place 
all-time in postseason home runs with 22.[47] The Red Sox advanced to the 
2007 American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians 
where, on October 13, Ramirez hit his 23rd postseason home run, passing 
Williams for the most all-time.[48] He helped the Red Sox to reach and 
win the 2007 World Series, where they swept the Colorado Rockies, by batting 
a combined .348 with 4 home runs and 16 RBI in the postseason.[49] Ramirez 
earned his second World Series ring, as the Red Sox earned their seventh 
title. 2008 opened with the Ramirez and the Red Sox defending their crown, 
and with Ramirez himself stating he wanted "to play six more years and 
then retire as a member of the Red Sox."[50] Ramirez played in his 2,000th 
game on May 26, 2008 against Seattle. On May 31, 2008, Ramirez hit his 
500th home run, against Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chad Bradford at Camden 
Yards in the seventh inning on the first pitch. He became the 24th player 
in MLB history to do so.[51] He joined two other Boston legends, Jimmie 
Foxx and Ted Williams, to have joined the exclusive home run club as a 
member of the Red Sox.[51] A heated altercation between Ramirez and teammate 
Kevin Youkilis took place on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against 
the Tampa Bay Rays.[52] The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry 
that Ramirez has been slow to join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the 
game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to 
what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike 
zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his 
helmet in frustration after making an out.[53][54] Before the fifth inning, 
Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis.[55] Ramirez 
and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, 
coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling 
at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse 
by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.[55] Later in the season, 
during a series with the Houston Astros, Ramirez had a physical altercation 
with elderly Red Sox traveling secretary Jack McCormick. The two were arguing 
over McCormick's inability to fill Ramirez's large game-day request for 
16 tickets to the game in Houston. Ramirez pushed the 64-year-old McCormick 
to the ground[53][56] after telling him "Just do your job." The two were 
quickly separated and Ramirez later offered a public apology but did not 
apologize to McCormick in person until 2014.[57] The matter was dealt with 
internally, and Ramirez was fined $10,000–15,000.[58] On July 25, after 
sitting out one game against the Seattle Mariners with a sore knee, Ramirez 
was slated to start against the Yankees. Several minutes before the game, 
however, he informed manager Terry Francona, through a bench coach, that 
he would not be playing. During the series Ramirez was directed to an area 
hospital for MRIs on both his knees; the results showed no damage.[59] 
When back in action, Ramirez frequently failed to run out ground balls. 
Assuming that this was due to his displeasure about his contract situation 
(Ramirez could become a free agent at season's end, but the Red Sox held 
2 years of team options they had not yet exercised), many Red Sox fans 
and reporters, including Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe, called for 
Ramirez to be traded.[60] Despite all these distractions, Ramirez did continue 
to hit solidly when on the field, as he batted .299 with 20 home runs and 
68 RBI through the first 100 games of the season. On July 31, 2008, Ramirez 
was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-way deal. The Boston Red 
Sox acquired outfielder Jason Bay and minor league infielder Josh Wilson, 
and the Pittsburgh Pirates got infielder Andy LaRoche and pitching prospect 
Bryan Morris from the Dodgers and outfielder Brandon Moss and pitcher Craig 
Hansen from the Red Sox.[61] Ramirez had always worn uniform number 24, 
but the Dodgers retired that number in honor of Hall of Fame manager Walter 
Alston. Ramirez instead chose to wear number 99 with the Dodgers.[62] Ramirez 
was named the NL Player of the Month for August 2008, touching off "Mannywood" 
in Los Angeles.[63] He hit .415 (44-for-106) with seven doubles, nine home 
runs, 25 RBIs and 21 runs scored during the month.[63] He finished the 
season with the Dodgers by batting .396 with 17 home runs and 53 RBI in 
just 53 games.[64] His combined totals were a .332 batting average, 37 
home runs, and 121 RBI.[65] Among all major leaguers, he finished third 
in batting average, second in slugging percentage, and third in OPS.[65] 
With Ramirez in the lineup, the Dodgers won the NL West, then swept the 
Chicago Cubs in the Division Series before losing in the NLCS to the eventual 
World Series winner Philadelphia Phillies in five games. During the playoffs, 
Ramirez hit .520 with 4 home runs, 2 doubles, 11 walks and 10 RBIs.[65] 
Ramirez was fourth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, with 138 points, 
behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, and Ryan Braun;[66] this was remarkable 
for someone who played less than half a season in the NL. After the Dodgers 
lost in the playoffs, Ramirez, a free agent to be, was asked about his 
future. "Gas is up, and so am I", was his reply, indicating that he expected 
to be valued highly in the free agent market. After long and contentious 
negotiations that dragged into the start of spring training, Ramirez signed 
a two-year $45 million contract with the Dodgers on March 4.[67] On May 
7, 2009, Ramirez was suspended 50 games for violating the Joint Drug Prevention 
and Treatment Program established by MLB and the MLB Players Association 
in 2004.[68] In the announcement by MLB, Ramirez was suspended for unspecified 
violation of the agreement section 8.G.2. Shortly afterward, Ramirez stated 
that a physician had unknowingly prescribed a banned medication.[69] After 
consulting with the players association, Ramirez waived his right to challenge 
the suspension.[68] According to an ESPN report, the drug used by Ramirez 
was human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a women's fertility drug typically 
used by steroid users to restart their body's natural testosterone production 
as they come off a steroid cycle. It is similar to Clomid, the drug Jason 
Giambi and others used as clients of BALCO. Testing revealed artificial 
testosterone, too.[70] As a condition for returning from the suspension, 
Ramirez was subject to three additional drug tests per year in addition 
to the minimum of two per player.[29] At the time of his suspension, Ramirez 
was batting .348 with 6 home runs and 20 RBI. During his suspension, Ramirez 
was allowed to work out at the Dodgers' facilities and he trained with 
Dodger coach Manny Mota.[71] To get back into shape he was allowed a short 
rehab stint in the minor leagues.[72] Ramirez played two games with the 
AAA Albuquerque Isotopes, where his appearance led to record crowds for 
the Isotopes.[73] He played several games with the Single-A Inland Empire 
66ers, homering in his first at-bat with the 66ers.[74] Ramirez returned 
from his suspension and reclaimed his starting role with the Dodgers on 
July 3 against the San Diego Padres.[75] On July 7, Ramirez was ejected 
by homeplate umpire John Hirschbeck after throwing his elbow guard in the 
air after being called out on strikes. Instead of causing conflict, Ramirez 
walked into the dugout where he remained the rest of the game. On July 
21, Ramirez hit his 537th career home run, passing Mickey Mantle for 15th 
place on the all-time home run list.[76] On July 30, The New York Times 
reported that Ramirez tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during 
Major League Baseball's 2003 survey testing.[77] Ramirez, a member of the 
Boston Red Sox at the time, was among 104 major league players to test 
positive.[29][77] Ramirez finished 2009 with a .290 batting average, 19 
home runs, and 63 RBI in 104 games. He added a home run and 4 RBI in the 
2009 MLB postseason, but the Dodgers were again eliminated by the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the NLCS. On April 10, 2010, Ramirez recorded his 2,500th career 
base hit with an infield single against the Florida Marlins.[78] On April 
18 against the San Francisco Giants, Ramirez hit his 548th career home 
run to tie Mike Schmidt for the 14th place on the all-time home run list.[79] 
He hit his 549th to pass Schmidt on May 28 against the Colorado Rockies.[80] 
On June 19, he hit a home run in his second game back at Fenway Park. In 
2010, Ramirez had three separate stints on the disabled list.[81] When 
he returned from the third trip on August 21, he apparently had lost his 
starting job to Scott Podsednik.[82] As a pinch hitter, he was ejected 
on August 29 by home plate umpire Gary Cederstrom one pitch into his at-bat 
for arguing a strike call. That appearance was his final one in a Dodger 
uniform.[83] He batted .311 with 8 homers and 40 RBI in only 66 games as 
a Dodger in 2010 before being placed on waivers. After being placed on 
waivers by the Dodgers, Ramirez was claimed by the Chicago White Sox. The 
Dodgers awarded Ramirez to the White Sox on August 30, receiving no prospects, 
but with the White Sox assuming the $3.8 million remaining on Ramirez's 
salary.[84] At the time, the White Sox hoped the pickup would bolster their 
offense for a playoff push. However, Ramirez hit .261 with just one home 
run and two RBI in his 24 games with the White Sox. He became a free agent 
at the conclusion of the season, which ended with the White Sox finishing 
88-74, 6 games out of first place in the AL Central, and missing the postseason. 
On January 21, 2011, Ramirez agreed to a one-year, $2 million deal with 
the Tampa Bay Rays, who also signed his former Red Sox teammate Johnny 
Damon in a package deal suggested by agent Scott Boras.[85][86][87] The 
signing initially looked like a bargain as Ramirez was among the better 
hitters in spring training, hitting .311 with 3 home runs and 10 RBI. However, 
the 38-year-old Ramirez abruptly retired on April 8, 2011, after batting 
.059 (1-for-17) in his first five games with no home runs and a single 
RBI.[88] Ramirez reportedly tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing 
drug in spring training. His first sample, or A sample, was retested and 
again returned a positive result. Ramirez filed a notice to appeal, and 
his second sample, or B sample, was tested under observation by Ramirez' 
representatives. When the B sample also tested positive, he dropped the 
appeal and told MLB that he would immediately retire.[29] MLB issued a 
statement that Ramirez had been informed of an issue under the Joint Drug 
Prevention and Treatment program, and chose to retire rather than continue 
with the appeal process.[4][89] Ramirez was facing a 100-game suspension, 
which would still apply if Ramirez decided to return to MLB in the future.[90] 
Neither Ramirez nor the MLB Players Association issued a statement about 
the sudden retirement. Ramirez apparently did not personally inform the 
Rays about his decision. The team announced that they had been informed 
of his retirement by the MLB Commissioner's Office.[29] In September 2011, 
reports surfaced that Ramirez was planning on playing in the Dominican 
Winter League for the Cibao Eagles. In a statement, the team said that 
Ramirez hoped to motivate other MLB stars to play in the country.[91] However, 
the MLB Commissioner's Office issued a statement that since the Dominican 
League is affiliated with MLB, Ramirez would not be eligible to play without 
first serving his mandated suspension.[92] Upon hearing that his plans 
to play in the winter league would not work, Ramirez decided that he was 
willing to serve his 100-game suspension for the second violation of the 
drug policy, and to request reinstatement with MLB. He stated that he was 
not prepared for retirement, that he would be available for any MLB team, 
and if none showed interest, then he would "play in Japan or some other 
place."[93] On December 4, it was announced that Ramirez had formally filed 
papers with the league to be reinstated to baseball and that an agreement 
had been reached between MLB and the Players Association that Ramirez would 
need only to serve a 50-game suspension instead of the original 100.[94] 
On February 20, 2012, Ramirez signed a minor league contract with the Oakland 
Athletics.[95] The deal called for a $500,000 salary if he made the MLB 
roster.[95] However, he needed to serve his 50-game suspension before he 
could play for the team.[96] He was eligible to play on May 30, 2012.[95] 
With the Sacramento River Cats he hit .302 in 17 games, but had no homers 
and only a .349 slugging percentage.[1] On June 15, Ramirez requested and 
was given his outright release by the Athletics.[97] Ramirez played in 
the Dominican Professional Baseball League during the 2012–13 offseason, 
registering a .793 OPS for the Águilas Cibaeñas. He signed with the newly 
renamed EDA Rhinos of the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan 
for the 2013 season.[98][99][100] He made his debut on March 27 against 
Brother Elephants.[101] In 49 games, Ramirez batted .352 with eight home 
runs and 43 RBIs, placing him in the top three in all categories. On June 
19, 2013, Ramirez opted out of his contract with the Rhinos, stating that 
he wanted to be closer to his family.[102] Ramirez signed a minor league 
deal on July 3, 2013 with the Texas Rangers. He was assigned to the Round 
Rock Express of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL).[103] After noticing 
a decrease in Ramirez' bat speed, which resulted in a lack of power,[104] 
the Rangers released Ramirez on August 13.[105] Ramirez signed a minor 
league deal with the Chicago Cubs on May 25, 2014, to serve as a player-coach 
for the Iowa Cubs, Chicago's Class AAA affiliate in the PCL.[106] Ramirez 
hit a two-run home run in his first Iowa home game at Principal Park on 
June 30, 2014.[107] Cubs prospects Arismendy Alcántara and Javier Báez 
credited Ramirez for his help with their swings.[108] Baez also viewed 
Ramirez as a good mentor because of how Ramirez comforted him after the 
loss of his uncle.[109] On August 23, Ramirez sustained a knee injury. 
A week later, Iowa manager Marty Pevey announced that Ramirez was going 
to Arizona for an MRI. With only four games left in Iowa's season, Pevey 
said that Ramirez was no longer going to coach and play for the team. Pevey 
said that he was uncertain as to what Ramirez would do next season, as 
he thought that Ramirez disliked the travel associated with Class AAA baseball.[110] 
On February 24, 2015, the Cubs announced that Ramirez was hired as a batting 
consultant, and that he would split time between Chicago and AAA Iowa.[111] 
On May 11, 2004, Ramirez missed a Red Sox game to become an American citizen.[112] 
He entered the next game running onto the field to a standing ovation while 
carrying a small American flag held in his hand.[112] He planted the flag 
in the left outfield corner of the field, in the shadow of the Green Monster, 
where it remained for the entire game.[112] Ramirez has three sons. Manny 
Ramirez, Jr. (born 1995) is his son from a previous relationship,[113] 
while he had Manuelito "Manny" Ramirez (born 2003)[113] and Lucas Ramirez 
(born February 2006)[113] with his wife Juliana.[113] As of August 2015[update], 
he and his family reside in Weston, Florida.[113] Ramirez has often attracted 
attention on and off the field for his quirky behavior and attitude.[114] 
These incidents are colloquially known as "Manny Moments" or more commonly, 
"Manny Being Manny".[114][115] Instances of this behavior include inducing 
his Red Sox teammates, including Ellis Burks, to drink alcohol which he 
had spiked with Viagra,[116] wearing Oakley THUMP while playing the outfield,[117] 
disappearing through a door in the Green Monster to use the bathroom, diving 
to intercept a throw from teammate Johnny Damon in the outfield which had 
been intended for the infield, selling his barbecue grill on eBay, and 
high fiving a fan after a catch at the outfield wall before throwing the 
ball back to the infield to complete a double play.[118] The first known 
documented usage of the phrase "Manny Being Manny" is attributed to then-Indians 
manager Mike Hargrove, quoted in a 1995 Newsday article.[119] Ramirez also 
built a reputation, despite his quirky behavior, of being someone who was 
a tireless worker at his hitting. He was known for long batting practice 
and tee sessions as well as constantly reviewing video of his swings and 
of opposing pitchers. However, while in the batters box during games, he 
kept his approach extremely simple, relying on the muscle memory and pitch 
recognition from his training regimen. He was known, at times, to verbally 
simplify his approach in the batters box to merely "seeing the ball".[50]
