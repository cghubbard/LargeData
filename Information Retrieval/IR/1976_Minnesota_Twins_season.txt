The 1976 Minnesota Twins finished 85-77, third in the American League West. 
Only 715,394 fans attended Twins games, the lowest total in the American 
League. It was the third year in a row that the Twins attracted the fewest 
number of fans in the AL. In June and July, Larry Hisle and Lyman Bostock 
became the third and fourth Twins to hit for the cycle. Hisle cycled on 
June 4 in an 8-6 win over Baltimore, going double, triple, single, home 
run. He is the only Twin that took an extra inning (homering in the tenth) 
to accomplish the feat, as he'd grounded out in his first at-bat. Six weeks 
later Bostock became the second Twin to cycle during a season, a first 
for the club. Two Twins made the All-Star Game: first baseman Rod Carew 
and catcher Butch Wynegar. On July 24, Lyman Bostock, batting fourth, went 
four-for-four (3B-HR-2B-1B) to become the fourth Twin to hit for the cycle. 
He had four RBI and scored four runs in the 17-2 win over Chicago.[5] Steve 
Luebber is the Minnesota pitcher to come closest to a no-hitter without 
achieving it. On August 7, he was one out away before losing his bid when 
Texas Ranger Roy Howell singled. Luebber then lost the shutout when Mike 
Hargrove singled Howell home. The Twins won the game, 3-1.[6] For the first 
time in four years, Carew did not win the AL batting title, finishing third 
with a .331 batting average. Carew did have 200 hits and 90 RBI. Larry 
Hisle hit 14 home runs and collected 96 RBI. Dan Ford added 20 HR and 86 
RBI. The Twins set a season-record low with just 81 homers. Reliever Bill 
Campbell led the Twins pitchers with 17 wins, all in relief. He also led 
the team in saves (20) and appearances (78). His earned run average of 
3.01 was second only to reliever Tom Burgmeier's 2.50; Burgy added 8 relief 
wins and a save. The Twins needed the relief help because the starting 
pitching was terrible, with only Dave Goltz (14-14) managing double digit 
wins. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Infielders Coaches
