The 1969 Baltimore Orioles season was a season in American baseball. In 
the first season after the American League was split into two divisions, 
the Orioles won the first-ever American League East title, finishing first 
with a record of 109 wins and 53 losses, 19 games ahead of the runner-up 
Detroit Tigers. After the regular season, the Orioles went on to the inaugural 
American League Championship Series, where they faced the Minnesota Twins. 
They swept the Twins in the 1969 ALCS, but lost the World Series to the 
upstart National League champion New York Mets in five games. The team 
was managed by Earl Weaver, and played their home games at Memorial Stadium. 
The Baltimore Orioles held Spring training at Miami Stadium in Miami for 
the 11th season. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Infielders
