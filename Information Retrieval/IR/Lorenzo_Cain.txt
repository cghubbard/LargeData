Lorenzo Lamar Cain (born April 13, 1986) is an American professional baseball 
center fielder for the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
The Milwaukee Brewers drafted him in the 17th round of the 2004 MLB draft 
from Tallahassee Community College in Florida. In 2010, Cain made his MLB 
debut, and, following the season, the Brewers traded him to Kansas City 
with three other players for pitcher Zack Greinke. Four years later, he 
placed in the top 10 in the American League in batting average (.301) and 
stolen bases (28). Known for his defensive acrobatics, he has won two Wilson 
Defensive Player of the Year Awards for outfielders and one Fielding Bible 
Award. Further, he won the 2014 American League Championship Series Most 
Valuable Player Award due in part to his defensive play. Cain's father 
died when Lorenzo was four years old. His mother, Patricia, raised him 
and his brother, and still works at a printing plant in Madison, Florida.[1] 
In contrast to most professional ballplayers, Cain did not start playing 
baseball until his sophomore year in Florida's Madison County High School. 
He only did so, he said, when he was not chosen for the school basketball 
team. At the time, Cain didn't even have a baseball glove.[1] Cain finished 
third in the voting for the 2015 American League Most Valuable Player, 
finishing behind winner Josh Donaldson and Mike Trout. Cain was drafted 
by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 17th round of the 2004 amateur draft out 
of Tallahassee Community College.[2] He began his career in 2005, playing 
for their Rookie League Helena Brewers and AZL Brewers. In 2006, he was 
promoted to the Class A West Virginia Power, where he was named to the 
South Atlantic League's mid and post-season All-Star teams.[3] Cain was 
promoted to their Class A-Advanced Brevard County Manatees in 2007. Beginning 
the 2008 season in Brevard County, Cain was called up to the Triple-A Nashville 
Sounds on June 10 to replace outfielder Hernán Iribarren, who was recalled 
by Milwaukee. Cain was called up to the Brewers when pitcher Doug Davis 
was placed on the disabled list on July 16, 2010. He made his major league 
debut against the Atlanta Braves that evening as a pinch-hitter. He was 
robbed of a hit in his first at-bat due to a diving catch by Braves left 
fielder Matt Diaz. Two days later, in his next at bat in that same series, 
he got his first major league hit. He then replaced CF Carlos Gómez for 
the rest of the game and finished the game 2 for 2 with two singles. On 
December 18, 2010, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals with Alcides 
Escobar, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake Odorizzi for Zack Greinke and Yuniesky 
Betancourt.[4] Cain was sent down to KC's AAA ball club,the Omaha Storm 
Chasers, before the start of the 2011 MLB season. On February 18, 2012 
the Royals announced they had signed Cain to a one-year contract for the 
2012 season. No financial terms of the deal were released.[5] Cain began 
2013 as the starting center fielder, with Jarrod Dyson as the backup. Around 
late June, Dyson started getting more starts. On August 10, Cain was placed 
on the disabled list with a strained left oblique,[6] When he returned 
on September 4, Cain had 14 more starts on the season, 7 in right and 7 
in center field. In 115 games (106 starts), Cain hit .251/.310/.348 with 
4 HR, 46 RBI and 14 SB. In the 2014 season, Cain finished the regular season 
hitting .301/.339/.412 with five HR (one inside the park), four triples, 
29 doubles, 28 SB, 46 RBI, and 55 runs in 133 games. Both his batting average 
and stolen base total placed eighth in the AL. He notched twice as many 
infield hits as he had the year before – this as a result of the work he 
had done with Al Hobson, track coach at Kansas City Kansas Community College 
to improve his base-running sprint speed.[7] The Royals made the playoffs 
for the first time since winning the 1985 World Series. In the Division 
Series, Cain's defensive play in center field – featuring four spectacular 
catches in two games – was widely credited with helping the Royals sweep 
the highly favored Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[8][9] In Game 2 of the 
American League Championship Series (ALCS) against the Baltimore Orioles, 
Cain added to his postseason highlight reel with yet another stunning, 
extra-base hit-stealing grab, this one of a J. J. Hardy line drive to right 
center field in the 6th inning to preserve a 4–4 tie.[10] At the plate, 
he went 4-for-5, tying George Brett's franchise record for most hits in 
a postseason game, and drove in a 9th-inning run that helped seal the Royals' 
6-4 victory over the Orioles, their sixth consecutive win in the 2014 postseason.[11] 
Cain ultimately ended up winning the ALCS Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) 
award for his efforts at the plate as well as in the field. He finished 
with a .533 batting average, eight hits, five runs, and numerous spectacular 
defensive plays which helped the Royals to sweep the Orioles and move on 
to the World Series.[12] His defensive prowess continued in the World Series 
against the San Francisco Giants, where he made a catch at the wall in 
Game 1. Cain made two more spectacular diving catches in Game 3 to help 
preserve a 3-2 victory for the Royals. In the crucial Game 6, in which 
the Royals face elimination, Cain went 2-for-3, with a single, double, 
and two walks, driving in three runs while making another running catch 
in Kansas City's 10-0 rout of the Giants to force a Game 7. However, the 
Giants won Game 7 and the World Series. During a game against the Chicago 
White Sox on April 23, 2015, Cain was one of five players ejected for being 
involved in a bench-clearing brawl.[13] On April 25, 2015, Cain was suspended 
2 games.[14] He had the option to appeal but dropped it on May 3, 2015, 
so the suspension would take effect.[15] In 2015, Cain was named to his 
first All Star team and helped lead the Royals to the 2015 AL Central Division 
title. He finished the regular season with career highs in batting average 
(.307), home runs (16), runs scored (101), and RBIs (72).[16] Cain's three-RBI 
performance in game 5 of the World Series helped the Royals take a 7-2 
win and clinch the championship over the New York Mets.[17] Cain and his 
wife Jenny have two sons, Cameron, born October 2014, and Jayden, born
