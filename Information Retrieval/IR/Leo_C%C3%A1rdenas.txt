Leonardo Lazaro Cárdenas Alfonso (born December 17, 1938) was a right-handed 
batting Major League Baseball player. Nicknamed "Mr. Automatic" and "Chico", 
he was a five-time all-star and one of the best fielding shortstops of 
his era.[1] Cárdenas was born in Matanzas, Cuba, one of 15 children of 
Rafael and Roberta Cardenas.[2] He came to the U.S. in 1956 at age 16 (although 
he claimed to be 17, the minimum age to be signed by a Major League team) 
and received a $500 signing bonus.[3] He was among the last of the Cuban 
players to make it out of Cuba before the borders were sealed. He batted 
.316 for the Arizona–Mexico League's Tucson Cowboys in 1956, and signed 
with the Cincinnati Reds the following season. While playing for the Havana 
Sugar Kings in the International League in 1959, Cárdenas was inadvertently 
shot by raucous Fidel Castro supporters firing off rifles in the grandstand 
in celebration of the 26th of July Movement.[4] The Havana team was moved 
to Jersey City the following July and renamed the Jerseys. Cárdenas was 
called up to the Reds in 1960 to fill in for an injured Roy McMillan. He 
made his Major League debut on July 25, 1960, starting and batting eighth 
and playing shortstop in a 6–5 Reds win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley 
Field. After grounding into a double play and later lining out, he notched 
his first career hit with a seventh-inning run-scoring single off Cubs 
pitcher Bob Anderson.[5] For the season, he batted .232 with one home run 
and 12 runs batted in. After the season, McMillan was dealt to the Milwaukee 
Braves for pitchers Joey Jay and Juan Pizarro.[6] Reds Manager Fred Hutchinson's 
original plan heading into the 1961 season was to platoon Cárdenas and 
utility infielder Eddie Kasko at short, with Cárdenas being the better 
fielder and Kasko being the better hitter.[7] Cárdenas, however, surprised 
his boss with a .308 batting average. He also clubbed five home runs to 
Kasko's two in 271 fewer at-bats. He was awarded the full-time starting 
shortstop job in 1962, and responded with a .294 average, 10 home runs 
and 60 RBIs. He remained the Reds' starting shortstop for seven seasons, 
earning All-Star nods in 1964, 1965 and 1968, and being elected to start 
in 1966.[8] He had eight RBIs and belted four home runs in a doubleheader 
against the Chicago Cubs on June 5, 1966[9] on his way to setting a club 
record for home runs by a shortstop with 20 (later broken by Barry Larkin).[10] 
Following the 1968 season, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins for pitcher 
Jim Merritt.[11] The Twins had something of a revolving door at short in 
1968 with Jackie Hernández, Rick Renick, Ron Clark and Cesar Tovar all 
manning the position at one point or another. Bringing in Cárdenas for 
1969 solidified the Twins at their weakest position, and helped turn around 
the team's fortune. They went from 79–83 and seventh place in the American 
League to 97–65 and winning the American League West the first year of 
divisional play. For his part, Cárdenas batted .280 with 10 home runs and 
70 RBIs at the bottom of the Twins' batting order. He tied an AL record 
for assists by a shortstop with 570. Cárdenas was batting .285 with 11 
home runs and 46 RBIs at the 1971 All-Star break to be named to his only 
AL All-Star team; however, he did not appear in the game.[12] He ended 
the season with 18 home runs and 75 RBIs and a stellar .985 fielding percentage 
to receive the Calvin R. Griffith Award given each season to the Twins' 
Most Valuable Player. His 1971 fielding percentage was the highest recorded 
in the American League since records began in 1901. At the 1971 Winter 
meetings, the California Angels acquired Cárdenas for relief pitcher Dave 
LaRoche. The acquisition marked former All-Star shortstop Jim Fregosi as 
trade bait.[13] He would go to the New York Mets for Nolan Ryan a week 
later. At 33 years old, Cárdenas was clearly on the decline by the time 
he joined the Angels. He batted only .143 in the month of June, and ended 
the season with a .223 average, six home runs and 42 RBIs. During Spring 
training 1973, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Tommy McCraw 
and minor leaguer Bob Marcano to make room for Bobby Valentine at short, 
whom they had recently acquired from the Los Angeles Dodgers.[14] Cárdenas 
found himself in more of a back-up role for the first time in his career 
with the Indians. He made his first major league appearance at third on 
August 16, and committed an error.[15] Following his only season in Cleveland, 
he was dealt to the Texas Rangers in a controversial deal for catcher Ken 
Suarez. Suarez had just filed for arbitration a week before the February 
12, 1974 trade. He filed a formal grievance against the Rangers claiming 
that he was traded in retaliation.[16] He never appeared in a game with 
the Indians, retiring instead. Cárdenas, meanwhile, appeared in 34 games 
for the Rangers, 21 of which were at third base. He spent one more season 
with the Rangers as a third baseman before retiring. Cárdenas led NL shortstops 
in fielding percentage in 1963 (.972) and 1966 (.980), and the AL in 1971 
(.985). He won his only Gold Glove award in 1965. The five time All Star 
also appeared in back to back Champion Series with the Minnesota Twins 
in 1969 & 1970 and the World Series against the New York Yankees in 1961. 
During his career he powered six home runs off of Hall of Fame pitcher 
Juan Marichal. He led the NL in intentional walks in 1965 & 1966 (25 & 
18, respectively). He was voted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 
1981. Despite having come to the United States in 1956, and twice being 
married to American women, Cárdenas never got around to applying for American 
citizenship.[17] He has eight children.[18] In 1998, Cárdenas was sentenced 
to three months in jail and five years' probation for felony assault after 
breaking out the windows of a car that his wife and a male co-worker were 
sitting in, and breaking the man's arm with a bat.[19] Cárdenas lives in 
Cincinnati and makes regular appearances at the Reds Hall of Fame, Great
