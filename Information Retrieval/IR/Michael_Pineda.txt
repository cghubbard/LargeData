Michael Francisco Pineda Paulino (born January 18, 1989) is a Dominican 
professional baseball starting pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He signed as an international free agent with the 
Seattle Mariners in 2005, and made his MLB debut for the Mariners in 2011. 
In his rookie season, Pineda was named an All-Star and finished fifth in 
balloting for American League Rookie of the Year. After his rookie season, 
he was traded to the Yankees. Pineda signed with the Seattle Mariners of 
Major League Baseball (MLB) at age 16 on December 12, 2005.[1] He made 
his professional debut with the Mariners of the Rookie-level Dominican 
Summer League (DSL) in 2006, pitching to a 2–1 win–loss record with a 0.44 
earned run average (ERA), allowing only one earned run all season. In 2007, 
he had a 6–1 record with a 2.29 ERA in regular action for the DSL Mariners. 
Pineda pitched for the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Class-A Midwest 
League in 2008 and had an 8–6 record with a 1.95 ERA. Opponents had a batting 
average of .216 against Pineda. He led the Seattle farm system in ERA, 
opponent average and strikeouts (128). Baseball America rated Pineda as 
the Mariners' tenth best prospect[2] while the Mariners organization named 
him their Minor League Pitcher of the Year.[3] Wisconsin pitching coach 
Jaime Navarro became Pineda's mentor.[4] Pineda battled injuries during 
the 2009 season, missing most of the year due to elbow strain.[5] He was 
4–2 with a 2.84 ERA for the High Desert Mavericks of the Class A-Advanced 
California League while healthy and threw three shutout innings for the 
Mariners of the Rookie-level Arizona League. He struck out 52 in 47 1⁄3 
innings pitched (IP) for the year. Before the 2010 season, Baseball America 
ranked Pineda as the Mariners' sixth best prospect.[6] Back in good health 
in 2010, Pineda was 8–1 with a 2.22 ERA for the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx 
of the Class-AA Southern League with 78 strikeouts and 17 walks in 77 IP 
and 3–3 with a 4.76 ERA for the Tacoma Rainiers of the Class-AAA Pacific 
Coast League with 76 strikeouts and 17 walks in 62 1⁄3 IP. The Mariners 
front office ended his season when he reached 140 IP as a precaution against 
injury.[7] The Mariners again named Pineda their Minor League Pitcher of 
the Year in 2010, and he was a finalist for the USA Today Minor League 
Player of the Year.[8][9] Baseball America rated Pineda as the second best 
prospect in the Mariners' system before the 2011 season.[10] Baseball America 
also rated him the sixteenth best prospect in all of baseball.[11] Pineda 
made the Mariners' starting rotation out of spring training 2011 as the 
number five starter, the third youngest player on a 2011 American League 
opening day roster after Chris Sale and Tim Collins.[9] He made his MLB 
debut on April 5, giving up three runs in six innings in a loss.[12] Pineda 
pitched 7 1⁄3 innings, allowed two runs, struck out seven batters, and 
earned his first MLB win on April 12, 2011.[13] Pineda struck out a career 
high nine batters against the Detroit Tigers on April 28, including the 
first four batters he faced.[14] He ended his first month in the majors 
with a 4–1 record and a 2.01 ERA. He was named American League Rookie of 
the Month for April 2011, pitching at least six innings in his first five 
starts, giving up only 22 hits and 12 walks over 31 1⁄3 innings, while 
striking out 30 opposing batters.[15] Pineda was selected to the All-Star 
Game on July 10 as a replacement for Justin Verlander, who was ineligible 
to pitch in the All-Star Game due to having pitched the day before the 
All-Star break.[16] He was 8–6 at that point, but with a 3.03 ERA and 113 
strikeouts in 113 innings, against only 36 walks. In the All-Star Game, 
Pineda pitched one perfect inning, striking out Scott Rolen and Rickie 
Weeks.[17] Pineda finished the 2011 season with a 9–10 record and a 3.74 
ERA.[18] He recorded no wins in his final seven starts over the last two 
months of the year, and the Mariners cut back on his work load as a precaution 
against an arm injury.[18] In 28 starts, he struck out 173 hitters while 
walking just 55 over 171 innings.[19] Pineda struck out 24.9% of all batters 
faced, which was the third highest strikeout percentage in MLB.[20] He 
also finished fifth in voting for American League Rookie of the Year Award, 
behind Jeremy Hellickson, Mark Trumbo, Eric Hosmer, and Iván Nova, and 
ahead of teammate Dustin Ackley, who finished sixth.[21] After the season, 
Keith Law ranked Pineda as the 20th best player under the age of 25.[22] 
The Mariners traded Pineda to the New York Yankees with José Campos, for 
Jesús Montero and Héctor Noesí on January 13, 2012.[9][18] The Yankees 
needed a top-tier starting pitcher to pair with CC Sabathia, and the Mariners 
felt they could afford to part with Pineda because of their depth of top-tier 
pitching prospects, including Danny Hultzen, James Paxton, and Taijuan 
Walker.[23] Pineda was placed on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis 
in his right shoulder at the culmination of spring training, causing him 
to miss the start of the 2012 season.[24] During his rehabilitation, he 
suffered an anterior labral tear in his right shoulder. He underwent arthroscopic 
surgery on May 1, 2012, and was ruled out for the 2012 season.[25][26] 
Pineda began the 2013 season on the 60-day DL as he was still recovering 
from the shoulder surgery.[27] He was activated from the disabled list 
on July 8, 2013, and optioned to the minor leagues, where he pitched for 
the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League.[28] 
In six games pitched for the RailRiders, Pineda had a 1–1 record and a 
3.86 ERA.[29] Pineda competed for a spot in the Yankees' starting rotation 
during spring training in 2014.[30] He was named the Yankees' fifth starter 
towards the end of spring training.[31] He made his first start for the 
Yankees on April 5, 2014.[32] On April 10, 2014, during a start against 
the Boston Red Sox, Boston broadcasters noticed a substance that appeared 
to be pine tar on the palm of Pineda's pitching hand in the early innings 
of the game. Midway through Pineda's outing, the substance was wiped from 
his hand only to be added to his wrist. The umpires of the game were never 
notified and no action was taken against Pineda, who told reporters after 
the game that the substance on his hand was dirt. On April 23, 2014, during 
Pineda's next game against the Red Sox, Red Sox manager John Farrell notified 
the umpires about pine tar on Pineda's neck, and he was ejected from the 
game in the second inning.[33] Pineda was suspended for 10 games for the 
incident.[34] He had a 1.83 ERA in 19 2⁄3 innings pitched across his first 
four starts.[35] While pitching in a simulated game during the suspension, 
Pineda developed a strain in his teres major muscle, which was expected 
to require three to four weeks to heal.[36] Following inflammation experienced 
in late May, Pineda's return was pushed back to August.[35] The Yankees 
activated Pineda to start on August 13.[37] Pineda finished the season 
with a 5–5 record and a 1.89 ERA in 76 1⁄3 innings.[38][39] On May 10, 
2015, in a win against the Baltimore Orioles, Pineda struck out a career-high 
16 batters over seven innings while also walking none, shattering his previous 
career-high of 10 strikeouts in a single game. He also became the first 
pitcher since Johan Santana in 2007 with 16 strikeouts and no walks in 
a single game.[40] Pineda went on the disabled list on July 30 due to a 
strained flexor muscle in his right forearm.[41] He finished the season 
with a 12–10 record and a 4.37 ERA in 160 2⁄3 innings across 27 games started.[39][42] 
Pineda is listed at 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) and 265 pounds (120 kg).[18] 
Baseball America rated Pineda as having the best fastball and control in 
the Mariners' system in 2010,[6] while rating him as having the best fastball 
and slider in the Mariners season in 2011.[11] Pineda's fastball in 2011 
averaged 94.7 miles per hour (152.4 km/h), the highest among MLB rookies 
with at least 100 innings pitched,[1] ranking fourth in the American League 
behind Alexi Ogando, Justin Verlander, and David Price.[19] Pineda also 
throws a changeup.[43] Since his shoulder surgery, his fastball is in the 
92-93 mph range, topping out around 96-97.[44] Pineda's family lives in 
the Dominican Republic.[4] While pitching for the Mariners in 2011, he 
roomed with Navarro, who had become the Mariners' bullpen coach.[45] He 
makes an effort to conduct his interviews in English, without the use of 
a translator,[4] though he still receives some assistance from Yankees' 
teammate Dellin Betances.[46] On August 20, 2012, Pineda was charged with 
driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol while on injury rehab in Tampa, 
Florida.[47] On February 20, 2013. Pineda pleaded no contest to driving 
under the influence and must serve 50 hours community service, up to one
