As player As manager Donald Henry Heffner (February 8, 1911 – August 1, 
1989) was an American second baseman, coach and manager in Major League 
Baseball. Born in Rouzerville, Pennsylvania, Heffner entered baseball in 
1929. After all or parts of four seasons with the then-minor league Baltimore 
Orioles, Heffner joined the New York Yankees for the 1934 season. He spent 
four seasons with the Yanks as a part-time player before a trade to the 
St. Louis Browns afforded him more playing time. He appeared in more than 
100 games in 1938–41 with St. Louis before reverting to a reserve role, 
and finished his playing career with the Philadelphia Athletics and Detroit 
Tigers in 1943–44. In 743 games over all or parts of 11 American League 
seasons (1934–44), Heffner batted .241 with six home runs and 610 hits. 
In 1947, he began his managing career in the Browns’ farm system, and he 
promptly won consecutive pennants in his first two seasons. He returned 
to the Major Leagues as a coach with the Athletics, now based in Kansas 
City, in 1958–60 and the Tigers in 1961. Heffner then spent two successful 
seasons managing the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, winning 
the 1962 league championship, before becoming third-base coach of the New 
York Mets in 1964–65. In October 1965, he succeeded Dick Sisler as manager 
of the Cincinnati Reds. Heffner was hired by longtime associate Bill DeWitt, 
the Reds’ owner and general manager who was the front office boss of the 
Browns during Heffner's playing days. The Reds were a first division finisher 
in 1965 and hopes were high for a pennant run the following year—especially 
after DeWitt added front-line starting pitcher Milt Pappas in a blockbuster 
trade with Baltimore involving former National League most valuable player 
Frank Robinson. But while the Orioles roared to the AL pennant and world 
championship in 1966, the Reds never got untracked under Heffner, who tried 
to convert all-star second baseman Pete Rose into a third baseman, only 
to draw the popular star's wrath. (Oddly, Rose would later willingly become 
a third baseman for Sparky Anderson). With Cincinnati in eighth place in 
the National League with a record of 37–46 (.446) on July 13, Heffner was 
released in favor of Dave Bristol. Heffner never again managed in the Major 
Leagues, although he spent 1967–68 as a California Angels coach and 1969 
as manager of the Denver Bears of the American Association. He died at 
age 78 in Pasadena, California. His interment was located at Mountain View
