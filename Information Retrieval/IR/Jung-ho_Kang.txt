On December 22, 2014, it was announced that the Pittsburgh Pirates had

2015, Kang signed a four-year, $11 million, contract with the Pirates, 
with an option for a fifth year.[12][13] In spring training, Kang competed 
with Jordy Mercer for the starting shortstop job.[12][13] In his first 
spring training game of the 2015 season, Kang hit a solo home run in the 
third inning, helping the Pirates to a 6–0 win over the Toronto Blue Jays.[14] 
On April 4, 2015, Kang recorded his first Major League hit off Kyle Lohse 
of the Milwaukee Brewers, a flare just past the outstretched glove of shortstop 
Jean Segura.[15] On April 21, Kang recorded his first RBI against the Chicago 
Cubs with a bases-clearing RBI double that gave the Pirates a 8-5 lead.[16] 
On May 4, Kang hit his first home run off St. Louis Cardinals closer Trevor 
Rosenthal. The solo home run tied the game, 1-1, in the 9th inning.[17] 
On May 9, 2015, during a 7–5 win over the Cardinals, the Pirates became 
the first MLB team to turn a 4–5–4 triple play. The play occurred when 
the Cardinals' Yadier Molina lined out to second baseman Neil Walker. Walker 
threw to Kang at third base to double off Jhonny Peralta for the second 
out. Kang then threw the ball back to Walker, who was standing on second 
base, for the final out after Jason Heyward froze between second and third.[18] 
On September 17, 2015, during a game against the Chicago Cubs, Kang was 
covering second base in a double play attempt. Baserunner Chris Coghlan 
attempted break up the double play by sliding into Kang. Coghlan collided 
with Kang's left knee, fracturing his leg and tearing his MCL. Kang was 
placed on the 60-day disabled list and would miss the remainder of the
