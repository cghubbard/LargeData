Carlos Alberto Zambrano (born June 1, 1981), nicknamed "Big Z" or "El Toro", 
is a former Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) from 2001 to 2012 for the Chicago Cubs and Miami 
Marlins. Zambrano, who stands 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and weighs 275 pounds 
(125 kg), was signed by the Cubs as a free agent in 1997 and made his debut 
in 2001. After being used in both starting and relief duties, he enjoyed 
his first full season as a starter in 2003, finishing with a 13–11 record, 
168 strikeouts and a 3.11 ERA. Zambrano is known as one of the best hitting 
pitchers of recent times.[1] He was a switch-hitter with a career .238 
batting average with 24 home runs, 71 RBIs and a slugging percentage of 
.396. The 23 home runs are the most ever by a Cubs pitcher. He also tied 
with Ferguson Jenkins for the club record for home runs by a pitcher in 
a single season, hitting six in 2006. Zambrano was called on to pinch hit 
20 times in his career and won a Silver Slugger Award three times for his 
hitting.[2][3] Zambrano was the only National League pitcher to win at 
least 13 games in each year from 2003 to 2008. In 2006, he became the first 
player from Venezuela to lead the National League in wins. Zambrano had 
six pitches. His most-used pitch was a heavy sinker at 88–92 mph designed 
to get ground balls. His next-most used pitch was a cutter (88–91), followed 
by a splitter (80–85). He also threw a four-seam fastball (90–91), slider 
(79–82), and curveball (high 60s–low 70s). The only major variation in 
his approach to right-handers and left-handers was that he threw the splitter 
much more to lefties. That pitch was a favorite with two strikes against 
lefties, while he threw the cutter most often in those counts against righties.[4] 
The combative Zambrano was known for being highly emotive on the mound, 
often antagonizing opponents and teammates alike. He behaved especially 
poorly when he did not pitch well, often blaming others. He incurred lengthy 
team suspensions in June 2010[5] and August 2011 after unleashing tirades 
in the wake of bad pitching performances. In another incident, he was suspended 
six games and fined $3,000 by Major League Baseball for arguing with umpire 
Mark Carlson and firing a ball into the outfield.[6] In other instances, 
he quarreled—and physically fought—with teammates for what Zambrano considered 
their poor effort or performance.[7][8] Zambrano was called up to the Cubs 
and pitched in his first game on August 20, 2001, starting against the 
Milwaukee Brewers at Wrigley Field in the second game of a double header. 
Zambrano started the game well, retiring nine of the first ten batters 
faced. He ran into difficulties in the fourth inning, and was removed before 
getting any outs in the fifth. He was charged with seven earned runs, walked 
four batters, and threw just 74 pitches.[9] One month later, on September 
20, Zambrano earned his first big-league victory by finishing out the fifth 
inning against the Houston Astros. Zambrano pitched just two-thirds of 
an inning in relief of Juan Cruz, and was just 20 years old.[10] He played 
6 games making 1 start with a 1-2 record and a 15.26 ERA. Zambrano did 
not have any additional starts in the season, and the Cubs finished in 
third place with an 88–74 record. Zambrano started the 2002 season at the 
Triple-A Iowa Cubs, but was quickly called up to the big leagues where 
he was dispatched to the bullpen and pitched in sixteen games during the 
first three months of the season. On July 1, 2002, Zambrano started against 
the Florida Marlins, taking a struggling Jason Bere's spot in the rotation. 
Zambrano logged sixteen starts for the Cubs, recording four wins and eight 
losses. At times he showed immense potential, including eight innings of 
shutout ball against the Milwaukee Brewers on September 4.[11] Zambrano 
did struggle with control, logging 63 walks in just over a hundred innings 
of work. Overall, he finished the season with a 4-8 record and a 3.66 ERA 
in 32 games (16 starts). The Cubs posted a disappointing 67–95 record for 
the season, finishing in fifth place. Zambrano maintained his position 
in the Cubs starting rotation in 2003 and started 32 games with a 3.11 
ERA and 13 wins in the fourth spot in the rotation, behind Mark Prior, 
Kerry Wood, and Matt Clement. The Cubs won the National League Central 
division, and were one win away from going to the World Series before being 
defeated by the Florida Marlins. The following year, Zambrano improved 
his statistics by lowering his ERA to 2.75 and increasing his strikeout 
total to 188. His record was the best on the Cubs staff that year, compiling 
a 16–8 record. On August 22, 2003, Zambrano started against Curt Schilling 
and the Arizona Diamondbacks. While Schilling pitched a strong game and 
recorded 14 strikeouts, it was Zambrano that received the attention as 
he took a no-hitter into the eighth inning. Zambrano got the first two 
batters out before Shea Hillenbrand broke up the no-hitter with an infield 
single down the third-base line. The play was very close at first, with 
TV replays indicating that the call may have been blown by first base umpire 
Bill Miller. Zambrano retired the next three batters (which would have 
been the final three outs) before giving up two more hits in the game.[12] 
The previous no-hitter for the Cubs was thrown in 1972 by Milt Pappas. 
Zambrano got his first post-season start on October 1 in Atlanta against 
the Braves in game two of the NLDS. He pitched 5.2 innings, giving up eleven 
hits and three runs. The last hit by Rafael Furcal bounced off of Zambrano's 
leg, and he was removed from the game as a precaution.[13] The Cubs did 
come back to tie the game in the eighth inning, with Zambrano getting a 
no-decision. The Cubs won the series 3–2, with Zambrano seeing no additional 
action. Zambrano was the starter in the first game of the NLCS at Wrigley 
Field on October 7. While the Cubs spotted him a first inning 4–0 lead, 
he was unable to hold it, giving up five earned runs in six innings, including 
three home runs in the top of the third inning. The Cubs did come back, 
with a dramatic two-run home run by Sammy Sosa in the bottom of the ninth 
to tie the game, but the Marlins won the game in 11 innings 9–8.[14] Zambrano 
got his third chance for a post-season victory as the starter in the fifth 
game in Miami. Once again, Zambrano wasn't sharp, giving up four walks, 
five hits, and two earned runs in just five innings, along with the loss. 
Josh Beckett for the Marlins had a magnificent outing, throwing a two-hitter 
sending the series back to Chicago.[15] The Cubs would end up losing the 
series to the eventual-World Series champ Marlins after a deciding 7 games. 
On May 7, Zambrano produced another fantastic start, permitting only 2 
hits against the Colorado Rockies. Zambrano retired the first 14 batters 
he faced until giving up a single to Matt Holliday. Only 97 pitches were 
thrown on the afternoon for the victory, with Colorado managing to hit 
just four of them out of the infield on a breezy, cold day at Wrigley.[16] 
Zambrano continued his brilliance in his next start against the Dodgers, 
stringing together an additional eight innings without giving up an earned 
run.[17] Through his first fourteen starts of the season, Zambrano had 
posted an 8–2 record, with quality starts in twelve of the games. His early 
season performance also earned him his first trip to the All-Star game 
where he pitched one inning in relief.[18] Some of his most memorable starts 
have been against the rival St. Louis Cardinals. The first was on May 2 
when he threw seven shutout innings, and Zambrano registered 12 strikeouts 
before being lifted in the 8th inning for a pinch hitter. The Cubs eventually 
lost, 1–0. The next was on July 19, where he and Jim Edmonds built upon 
the rivalry between two Midwestern teams. In the first inning, Edmonds 
was hit by a pitch to load the bases. In the fourth inning, Edmonds connected 
for a home run, and watched the ball go over the fence from home plate. 
An agitated Zambrano yelled at Edmonds as he crossed the plate, but the 
night was far from over. In his next at bat in the sixth inning, Zambrano 
struck Edmonds out on three pitches, and wagged his finger at Edmonds on 
his way to the dugout. In the eighth inning with the score tied, Scott 
Rolen hit a two-out, two-run home run to break a 3–3 tie. Edmonds was the 
next batter, whom Zambrano immediately hit with a pitch and was ejected 
from the game. Zambrano indicated that it was not intentional, but Rolen 
and manager Tony La Russa did not agree.[19] Zambrano was awarded the NL 
Pitcher of the Month for September.[20] In his five starts during the month, 
Zambrano posted a 4–0 record over 35 2⁄3 innings, giving up only four earned 
runs. It wasn't enough for the Cubs as they finished with a late season 
losing streak, and missed the playoffs. In 2004, Zambrano led his team 
in ERA (2.75, fourth in the league), won 16 games (tied with teammate Greg 
Maddux), collected 188 strikeouts, and led the league in hit batsmen (20). 
He was also selected as an All-Star for the first time in his career. With 
injuries to key starters, and Zambrano's improving game, Zambrano was named 
the opening day starter for the Cubs. Zambrano was cautious about the opportunity, 
but was less cautious about arguing balls and strikes with home plate umpire 
Dale Scott after being pulled in the fifth inning and was eventually ejected.[21] 
Two starts later, Zambrano gave up one hit but left in the eighth inning 
after throwing 111 pitches. He had cramps at the beginning of the game 
that concerned some Cubs fans still wondering about the other starters.[22] 
Continuing to build on the rivalry with the Cardinals, Zambrano turned 
in good performances once again in 2005. The first was on April 20, facing 
Jeff Suppan in St. Louis. Zambrano gained the victory pitching within one 
out of a complete game and had his first career triple.[23] He returned 
to St. Louis again on July 22 to face ace Chris Carpenter. Zambrano turned 
in another excellent performance, striking out 12 and giving up only three 
hits over nine complete innings.[24] St. Louis picked up the victory in 
extra innings on a David Eckstein squeeze play. The Cardinals made the 
trip to Chicago on August 12, starting Jason Marquis against Zambrano. 
Once again Zambrano gained the victory, this time pitching six shutout 
innings before leaving with tightness in his back[25] A final start against 
the rivals was completed on September 18 as a rematch with Carpenter, with 
similar results as Zambrano pitched a complete game, giving up two earned 
runs and gaining the victory, his third of the season against the Cardinals. 
The final results for the four games: three victories, no defeats, four 
earned runs, and averaging over eight innings a start. Zambrano witnessed 
a strange injury surface early in the season that was first diagnosed as 
"tennis elbow"[26] but was later traced to his use of the internet to stay 
in contact with relatives in Venezuela.[27] On August 7, in just the fourth 
meeting of pitchers with the same last name since 2000, Víctor Zambrano 
of the New York Mets outdueled[peacock term] Carlos Zambrano in front of 
an attendance of 40,321 fans at Shea Stadium, pitching the New York Mets 
to a 6–1 win and a sweep of the three-game series. Both Zambranos entered 
with 42 career wins, the second time in Major League history that opposing 
starters with the same last name came in with matching victory totals, 
according to the Elias Sports Bureau.[citation needed] The other was on 
June 15, 1944, when Red Barrett of the Boston Braves and Dick Barrett of 
the Philadelphia Phillies each had 19 career wins. Like the Barretts, Víctor 
and Zambrano obviously share a double feat, but the similarities do not 
end there. The Zambranos were born in Venezuela, both throw with their 
right arm, both switch hit, and both wear No. 38. Beside this, it was the 
fourth time in modern Major League history that starting pitchers with 
a last name beginning with Z faced each other, according to ESPN. Víctor 
and Carlos Zambrano have both faced Barry Zito of the San Francisco Giants. 
Zambrano had an excellent[peacock term] year hitting, with a .300 batting 
average and one home run. Zambrano finished the season sixth in the National 
League in strikeouts (202), tenth in earned run average (3.26), and third 
in winning percentage (70%, with a record of 14-6), seventh in WHIP (1.15), 
tenth in strikeouts per nine innings (8.14), and ninth in innings pitched 
(223 1⁄3). For the second consecutive season, Zambrano was named the Cubs 
opening day starter, and with similar results from the previous year. In 
his first start of 2006, Zambrano was wild, issuing five walks, and five 
earned runs without getting through the fifth inning. The Cubs did score 
runs posting 16 in the victory.[28] After a poor opening game, the Cubs 
did not give Zambrano much offensive support in his next six starts, providing 
less than two runs a game. This led to Zambrano going winless until May 
10, even though he pitched four quality starts in his first seven. On June 
5, Zambrano made another bid for a no-hitter against the Astros in Houston. 
Zambrano had a perfect game go one out into the eighth inning before Preston 
Wilson hit a single. In addition to an excellent pitching performance, 
Zambrano hit a three-run home run in the second inning, his first of the 
season. Zambrano went to his second All-Star Game during the 2006 season. 
He was slated to pitch two innings in the game, however, he had to sit 
out the game after suffering a minor injury when he was accidentally hit 
by White Sox third base coach Joey Cora's fungo bat during pre-game warmups. 
Zambrano peaked during the month of July, posting a perfect 6–0 record 
for the month, the first time a Cubs pitcher had recorded as many victories 
since 1979 when Rick Reuschel recorded seven in a month. He also was a 
star at the plate, hitting two home runs during the six games. Included 
in the month was a two-hit, ten strikeout, eight inning, 123 pitch performance 
against the Astros. Zambrano finished out the month with a 6–3 victory 
over the arch-rival Cardinals, where he bested Chris Carpenter. While the 
Cubs were far out of contention for a playoff spot, Zambrano continued 
with a positive attitude.[30] Zambrano was rewarded with his second National 
League Pitcher of the Month award for his July efforts. Wildness did impact 
Zambrano's ability to throw complete games based on the number of pitches 
required to get deep into the game. On August 14, he shut out the Astros 
through eight innings on just four hits, but he also gave up seven walks, 
hit a batter, and recorded a wild pitch. He also needed 121 pitches to 
get through eight innings, and was replaced by closer Ryan Dempster in 
the ninth to finish the game.[31] In his 30th start of the season on September 
4, Zambrano suffered a setback leaving the game early in the second inning 
with lower back stiffness, but an MRI indicated no significant disc injuries. 
Zambrano gave up four hits and four walks before leaving in the shortest 
start in his career.[32] Zambrano avoided a trip to the disabled list, 
but was skipped in his next two starts. He pitched again on September 17 
against the Reds. Cub fans were relieved to see him pitch seven scoreless 
innings, and not showing any signs of the injury from his previous outing.[33] 
He finished the 2006 season with a 16-7 record, 210 strikeouts, a 3.41 
ERA, and an MLB-leading 115 walks.[34] Despite the Cubs finishing with 
the worst record in the National League, 2006 was a transformative year 
for Zambrano, as he thrived[peacock term] under the pressure of assuming 
the number-one role in the Cubs' rotation as the former aces apparent, 
Mark Prior and Kerry Wood, were incapacitated for the vast majority of 
the season. Based on his tenure with the MLB, Zambrano was eligible for 
free agency at the end of the 2007 season. Originally, Zambrano indicated 
that he needed to have a new contract signed before the start of the season, 
but it appeared that a deal was almost in place, so his agent extended 
the deadline to go into the season. The contract was close to being done, 
but then the sale of the team was announced, and all talks were put on 
hold. Zambrano ultimately signed a five-year, US$91.5 million contract 
on August 17, 2007.[35][36] After his last start of the 2006 season where 
the Cubs dropped to 30 games below .500, Zambrano identified the need for 
quality pitching to be added before the next season.[37] The Cubs management 
added Ted Lilly and Jason Marquis in the off-season as part of a $300 million 
spending spree. After the acquisitions, Zambrano speculated on the fortunes 
for the 2007 season, declaring that he was to win the Cy Young Award and 
the Cubs would win the World Series.[38] Zambrano and the Cubs start to 
the season was anything but predicted. In Zambrano's first five starts, 
only one was a quality start with Zambrano posting a 6.91 ERA with 19 walks 
and 7 home runs allowed in just 28.1 innings. The Cubs did not fare much 
better, posting a 10–14 record in April. After a difficult game against 
Cincinnati where they blew a big early lead, Cubs manager Lou Piniella 
began to show a little frustration on the inconsistency being shown early 
in the season by Big-Z and the team.[39] One of the causes for his statistics 
being less than in previous years is Zambrano' difficulties in the first 
inning. After giving up three first-inning runs in a loss on May 10, Zambrano 
described the challenge as being related to bad luck and control.[40] Zambrano 
made some changes in his delivery with Cubs pitching coach Larry Rothschild 
and turned in a stellar performance in New York yielding only one run while 
providing eight strong innings. In his next start, Zambrano faced the cross-town 
rival White Sox at Wrigley. Zambrano did not get much support as Alfonso 
Soriano misplayed a foul ball in the second inning, extending the inning 
by an out which cost two runs, and Neal Cotts in the bullpen gave up a 
grand-slam in the seventh inning with two outs which charged back three 
addition runs. The official statistics looked poor as he was charged with 
seven earned runs, however it wasn't as poor of an outing as the box score 
recorded.[42] Zambrano continued to improve his performance in his following 
performance in Los Angeles against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He indicated 
his control issues were improving, and got ahead of hitters early in the 
count. On June 1, 2007, Michael Barrett and Cubs pitcher Zambrano got into 
an altercation in the Cubs dugout. The dispute stemmed from a passed ball 
and errant throw (on the same play) by Barrett in the previous half inning 
that allowed a run to score and contributed to the unraveling of Zambrano 
who ended up allowing six earned runs on thirteen hits in five innings. 
Shortly after the controversy, he went on to win his next two starts. Zambrano 
came close to pitching a no hitter on June 16. However, he fell short of 
his goal in the eighth inning, when an infield single broke up the no-hitter. 
Zambrano would later lose the game 1–0 on a solo home run by the Padres' 
Russell Branyan.[44] He finished July with 5–1 record, which was the best 
in the league. He became the first pitcher to win fourteen games in 2007, 
and won the "National League Pitcher of the Month" in July.[45] After winning 
the award, Zambrano began to struggle throughout August. He started the 
month by earning a no decision on August 3, after leaving the game early 
due to dehydration.[46] He recorded his one thousandth strike-out during 
his subsequent start, but proceeded to lose the game.[47] Zambrano went 
winless in August, despite signing a rich multi-year contract with the 
Cubs.[48] He started September by failing to win a game against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. Zambrano, who only lasted four innings, was booed by Wrigley 
Field's audience as he left the field.[48] In a post game interview, he 
retaliated at fans by stating, "I thought these were the greatest fans 
in baseball, but they showed me today that they only care about themselves. 
That's not fair, when you are struggling, you want to feel like you have 
their support. I don't accept their reaction".[48] He apologized for making 
the remarks the following day.[49] Despite failing to win the Cy Young 
Award as he predicted, Zambrano rebounded from a winless August with a 
4–2 record in the final month of the season while solidifying his season 
ERA below 4.00 courtesy of consecutive scoreless outings in his final two 
starts. He finished the regular season with a career-high in both games 
started and wins, with a record of 18–13 in 34 starts while living up to 
his expectations as the staff's workhorse by pitching at least 200 innings 
for the fifth consecutive season. He also led the NL with walks issued, 
totaling 101 walks. Zambrano started Game 1 of the 2007 NLDS against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks but left after only six innings and 85 pitches because 
Cubs manager Lou Piniella planned to bring the right-hander back on three 
days’ rest in Game 4.[50] It was a failed tactic, as the Cubs lost in three 
games, with Piniella's Game 1 move to be "questioned for years".[51] Zambrano 
started the 2008 season by compiling a 12–4 record with a 2.76 ERA through 
July 27. At the plate, he had a batting average of .354 thru September 
14. Zambrano also had a four-hit game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on 
May 23, making him the first Cubs pitcher since Lew Burdette in 1964 to 
accomplish this feat. On June 21, the Cubs placed Zambrano on the 15-day 
disabled list (retroactive to June 19), because of a right shoulder strain. 
In his return off the DL on July 4, Zambrano pitched six shutout innings 
and recorded the victory in the Cubs' 2–1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
On July 7, Zambrano was one of seven Chicago Cubs players announced as 
participants of the 2008 MLB All-Star Game. On July 19 he set the club 
record for home runs by a pitcher, when he hit a seventh inning homer in 
Houston off Wandy Rodríguez. On August 26, Zambrano set two records for 
hitting proficiency by a pitcher. His fourth-inning RBI single gave him 
a 13-start hitting streak, breaking Johnny Sain's record of 12, and also 
marked the 8th straight start in which he had an RBI, breaking the record 
of 7 set by Wes Ferrell.[52] (Note, however, that the hitting streak was 
not accrued over 13 consecutive starts, as the designated hitter rule was 
in effect in an interleague game during the streak.) Both streaks would 
end in his next start. In his first start back after missing two starts 
due to rotator cuff tendinitis, Zambrano pitched a no-hitter on September 
14 against the Houston Astros. The game was moved to Miller Park in Milwaukee 
because of damage in Houston due to Hurricane Ike making it the first neutral 
site no-hitter.[53] Zambrano only allowed two base-runners as he walked 
Michael Bourn in the 4th inning and hit Hunter Pence in the 5th inning. 
It was the first no-hitter by a Cubs pitcher since Milt Pappas did so September 
2, 1972 breaking the longest drought of any team to have already had a 
no-hitter. Zambrano gave up one walk and threw 10 strikeouts over 110 pitches 
in his 14th win for the season and his 95th all time.[54] On May 27, 2009, 
Zambrano was ejected in the seventh inning of a game against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates after an argument with umpire Mark Carlson on a call of safe at 
home plate. With the Cubs up, 2–1, and Nyjer Morgan representing the tying 
run at third base, Zambrano's pitch got away from Cubs catcher Geovany 
Soto. While Soto chased after the ball, Zambrano raced Morgan to the plate 
and tried to apply the tag, but Carlson called Morgan safe, contending 
that Morgan's left hand got past Zambrano. After a brief argument, Zambrano 
appeared to bump Carlson and was ejected. Zambrano then threw a ball into 
left field, hurled his glove into the dugout and repeatedly struck a recently 
installed Gatorade dispenser in the dugout with a baseball bat while Cubs 
manager Lou Piniella tried to calm him down. Zambrano was suspended six 
games without pay and fined $3,000 by Major League Baseball.[55][56] Zambrano 
ran into trouble again when he missed the team's flight to Atlanta.[57] 
The issue was resolved internally, within the Cubs organization. During 
his next start, Zambrano struck-out seven batters, and hit the game-winning 
home run en route to his 100th career win.[58] After the game, reporters 
began to inquire if Zambrano could possibly win 300 games during his career. 
He replied that he tentatively plans to retire when his contract with the 
Cubs expires, claiming, "I want to help this team and do everything possible 
to win with this team. After five years, or four years, or whatever it 
is, that's it. I just don't want to play. I want to stay at home and see 
my daughters grow up and be with my family more."[59] Zambrano's opening 
day start was his sixth consecutive one, a Cubs record. However, he gave 
up eight runs in one and one third innings, including a 3-run home run 
to Jason Heyward in his first career at-bat. He was charged with the loss 
as the Cubs lost the game, 16–5. Zambrano bounced back in his next start 
against the Cincinnati Reds, however. Zambrano pitched 7 strong innings, 
giving up three earned runs, six hits, and striking out nine batters en 
route to his first victory of the season. On April 21, 2010, The Cubs moved 
Zambrano to the bullpen.[60] On May 30, 2010, the Cubs decided to move 
Zambrano back to the rotation. He made his first start on June 4 against 
the Astros. In his first four starts after returning to the rotation, Zambrano 
was 2–2 with a 3.09 ERA. On June 25, 2010, Zambrano had a meltdown against 
the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field, giving up four runs in the 
first inning. He then proceeded to mount a furious tirade in the Cubs dugout. 
Cameras showed Zambrano appearing to yell at Derrek Lee, whom the pitcher 
apparently blamed for failing to field a sharply-hit ball off the bat of 
Juan Pierre, resulting in a lead-off double. The Cubs coaching staff had 
to separate the two players and manager Lou Piniella opted not to send 
Zambrano back to the mound in the second inning. Cubs GM Jim Hendry announced 
that Zambrano would be suspended indefinitely for his behavior in the game. 
The next day, Lou Piniella announced that when Zambrano returned, he would 
be moved back to the bullpen. It was later confirmed that Zambrano would 
undergo anger management before returning with the team.[61] The Cubs then 
returned Zambrano to the rotation for the second time where he did not 
give up more than two runs in any start since his return from the bullpen 
on August 9. Over that time, he allowed only 11 total runs (9 earned) in 
50 innings, and pulled his ERA down to 3.75. On August 30, 2010 against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates, Zambrano improved to 3–0 since his return to the 
pitching rotation, striking out seven. Additionally, he recorded his 21st 
career home run with a two run shot, increasing his club record for home 
runs by a pitcher.[62] On September 15 at Busch Stadium, he once again 
faced Cardinal's ace Chris Carpenter and out-dueled him throwing 104 pitches 
over six innings giving up just 2 runs (1 earned). He has now won 5 consecutive 
starts and 6 decisions overall since returning to the rotation. Zambrano 
pitched for the first time with his mother present against the San Diego 
Padres at San Diego on Monday, September 27, 2010. He gave up no runs over 
7 innings and won the game. His record now sits at 10–6 with a 3.36 ERA. 
Zambrano is now 7–0 in 9 starts with an ERA of 1.07 (seven earned runs 
in 59 innings) since his return to the rotation on Aug. 14.[63] Zambrano 
finished the season 11–6 with an ERA of 3.33. He was 11–5 with an ERA of 
3.19 in 20 starts and pitched 113 innings in those starts. He was 0–1 with 
a 4.32 ERA in 16 bullpen appearances spanning 16 and two-thirds innings. 
For the entire season Zambrano gave up just 7 home runs. Zambrano lost 
the role as the Chicago Cubs opening day starter to Ryan Dempster, but 
did record a quality start in his first outing as the Cubs number 2 starter 
going 6-plus innings and giving up three runs. He also experienced some 
cramps in this game, which led to a premature exit even though he had thrown 
99 pitches.[64] In his 4th start of the year, Zambrano dueled the San Diego 
Padres Tim Stauffer and pitched 8 scoreless innings at Wrigley Field. He 
displayed better than average control, giving up just one walk and striking 
out 10 with 3 hits. He received a no-decision for his efforts as the Cubs 
were unable to score while he was on the mound. The Cubs eventually won 
the game in the 10th inning on Tyler Colvin's game-winning single.[65] 
Zambrano's 10-game overall win streak came to an end on Sunday, April 24 
after a rough first inning against the Dodgers lead to 5 runs. Zambrano 
finished the game, giving up 6 runs on 8 hits in just 5 innings—his shortest 
outing of the season.[66] Zambrano faced the Dodgers again on May 4, this 
time at Dodger Stadium. He pitched well; going 8 innings, allowing one 
run on 5 hits, and receiving the win. On the heels of a road win against 
the Arizona Diamondbacks, Zambrano's road winning streak stood at 10.[67] 
Another win against the Los Angeles Dodgers extended the streak to 11, 
but Zambrano was tagged for a loss against the Cincinnati Reds on May 16. 
On August 6, 2011, again against the Reds, Zambrano hit his 23rd career 
home run, making him tied for ninth on the list of MLB's all-time leading 
home run-hitting pitchers. On August 12, 2011, Zambrano surrendered five 
home runs to the Atlanta Braves. In frustration, he aggressively threw 
two inside pitches at Braves third baseman Chipper Jones; he was subsequently 
ejected from the game by home plate umpire Tim Timmons. Zambrano then cleaned 
out his locker from the visitors' clubhouse and told the team personnel 
that he was retiring.[68] The next day on August 13, the Cubs suspended 
Zambrano for 30 days, preventing him from performing or attending any activity 
with the club, as well as having his pay suspended for a period of 30 days.[69] 
Zambrano later apologized to the Cubs and their fans, saying he wanted 
to "remain a Cub for life" and that his comments about retiring were said 
out of frustration. He appealed for a shorter suspension through the MLBPA.[70] 
On September 2, the club announced that he would not pitch for the remainder 
of the 2011 season.[71] Cub teammates did not express sympathy for his 
plight, with veteran pitcher Ryan Dempster remarking, "He's made his bed. 
Let him sleep in it."[72] As Zambrano spent the rest of the 2011 season 
on the restricted list, he finished the year 9–7 with a 4.82 ERA in 24 
starts. On January 5, 2012, the Cubs traded Zambrano to the Miami Marlins 
in return for pitcher Chris Volstad. [73][74] His first start as a member 
of the Marlins was against the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched six innings 
with six strikeouts, allowed four hits, including a home run in a no decision. 
In that same game, Zambrano also got his first base hit as a Marlin.[citation

win as a Marlin against the Houston Astros. He pitched a complete game 
shutout with nine strikeouts, a walk, and only three hits.[75] On May 15, 
2013, Zambrano signed a one-year minor league contract with the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[76] Despite a highly successful AAA stint, he was released on 
July 25. On September 5, 2014, he officially announced his retirement from
