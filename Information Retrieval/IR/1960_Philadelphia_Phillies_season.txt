The 1960 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 78th in franchise history. 
The team finished in eighth place in the National League with a record 
of 59–95, 36 games behind the NL and World Series Champion Pittsburgh Pirates. 
Manager Eddie Sawyer abruptly resigned after the season opener. The Phillies 
hired Gene Mauch as his replacement, but coach Andy Cohen managed one game 
before Mauch could join the team from the Minneapolis Millers, leading 
the Phillies to a 5–4 win in ten innings over the Milwaukee Braves.[6] 
This was the only game Cohen ever managed in the major leagues, leaving 
him with a perfect record as a manager.[7] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos
