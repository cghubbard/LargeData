Endy de Jesus Chávez (/ˈtʃɑːvɛz/; born February 7, 1978) is a Venezuelan 
professional baseball outfielder who is currently a member of the Bridgeport 
Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball; an independent 
Minor League. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas 
City Royals, Montreal Expos, Washington Nationals, Philadelphia Phillies, 
New York Mets, Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers and Baltimore Orioles. Chávez 
who bats and throws left-handed is arguably best known for a catch in Game 
7 of the 2006 NLCS.[1] Chávez made his Minor League Baseball debut in 1996 
with the Mets, a rookie-level affiliate of the New York Mets. In his first 
season with the team, he hit .354 in 48 games. He played the next four 
years in the Mets organization with the Kingsport Mets, Gulf Coast Mets, 
Capital City Bombers, and St. Lucie Mets.[2] On December 11, 2000, Chávez 
was claimed by the Kansas City Royals in the 2000 Rule 5 draft.[3] On March 
30, 2001, Chávez was returned to the Mets and then traded to the Royals 
for minor league outfielder Michael Curry. He played for the AA Wichita 
Wranglers and the AAA Omaha Royals before making his major league debut 
with the Royals on May 29, 2001. In the winter of 2001, Chávez was waived 
by the Royals and then claimed and waived by both the Mets and Detroit 
Tigers before being claimed by the Montreal Expos[4] where he played in 
309 games over three years (2002–05) while splitting time at AAA Ottawa 
and Edmonton. Playing full-time for the Expos in 2003 and 2004, Chávez 
batted first in the lineup and started in center field, stealing 18 bases 
in 2003 and 32 in 2004. On October 3, 2004 Chávez recorded the final out 
in Montreal Expos history in their 8–1 loss to the Mets at Shea Stadium. 
In 2005 Chávez played in only seven games in the majors for the now re-located 
Washington Nationals before being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for 
fellow outfielder Marlon Byrd. During his tenure in Washington, Chávez 
was given the mocking nickname of "Inning Endy" by Nationals fansites due 
to his tendency to swing away rather than work the count to his favor which 
often resulted in groundouts and popups to end the Nationals innings.[5][6] 
Chávez spent the rest of the 2005 season with the Philadelphia Phillies 
and appeared in 91 games with 107 at bats and hit only .215. At the end 
of the season, Chávez became a free agent for the first time and signed 
one year, $500,000 contract with the Mets signed on December 23, 2005. 
During spring training, Mets manager Willie Randolph worked with Chávez 
to improve his hitting. Chávez's speed and his modified batting style sparked 
a 90-point jump in his batting average over the previous season (hitting 
.306 in 353 at bats) as the Mets fourth outfielder (often as an injury 
replacement for regular left fielder Cliff Floyd). His improved hitting 
and excellent defensive skills contributed to the Mets winning the National 
League East. Chávez's signature moment came at Shea Stadium in Game 7 of 
the 2006 National League Championship Series. In the top of the sixth inning, 
with the game tied 1–1, Cardinals third baseman Scott Rolen hit a pitch 
off Mets starter Óliver Pérez. Leaping over the 8-foot (2.4 m)-high left 
field wall, Chávez caught the ball with the tip of his glove to rob Rolen 
of a two-run home run. Chávez then threw to cutoff man second baseman José 
Valentín, who threw to Carlos Delgado at first base to double off Cardinals 
center fielder Jim Edmonds for an inning-ending double play. The catch 
was named the top post-season moment in the 5th annual This Year in Baseball 
Awards. On July 13, 2007, American International Group (the company whose 
left field advertisement was where Chávez made the catch) sponsored a special 
Bobblehead Doll day to commemorate the catch. The Left Field entrance gate 
of the Mets' current ballpark, Citi Field, features a metal silhouette 
of a baseball player making a leaping catch similar to the one Chávez made 
in the 2006 NLCS. Chávez's playing time decreased dramatically in 2007 
when he only saw time in 71 games, primarily splitting time with regular 
left fielder Moisés Alou, due to left hamstring issues which landed him 
on the disabled list twice. That winter, he reinjured the hamstring and 
injured his right ankle while playing winter ball in Venezuela for Navegantes 
del Magallanes.[7] In 2008, Chávez again saw time as the Mets' fourth outfielder 
and hit .267 in 270 at-bats. On September 28, the final day of the 2008 
regular season and the final game at Shea Stadium, the Mets played the 
Florida Marlins. With an NL wildcard spot at stake for the Mets, Chávez 
made another terrific catch in the outfield during the top of the seventh 
inning. After a ball was hit to left field by Jorge Cantú, Chávez made 
the catch for the final out of the inning. Despite his defensive play, 
the Mets lost to the Marlins 4-2 and failed to qualify for post-season 
play. On December 11, Chávez was involved in a three-team, 12-player trade 
in which he was sent, along with pitcher Aaron Heilman and several minor 
leaguers, to the Seattle Mariners.[8] On June 19, 2009, while trying to 
catch a pop-up, Chávez collided with shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt and 
suffered a torn ACL in his right knee which ended his 2009 season.[9] On 
February 15, 2010, Chávez agreed to a minor league free agent contract 
with the Texas Rangers and spent time with the Rangers' Rookie League team, 
the AA Frisco and AAA Oklahoma City while coming back from his ACL injury. 
In 2011, he batted .301 with 5 home runs in 256 at-bats[10] and helped 
the Rangers to the 2011 post season. Chávez did not get an at-bat in either 
the playoffs or the Rangers' World Series defeat. On December 18, 2011, 
Chavez signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles.[11] 
Chávez again saw major time on the disabled list (suffering intercostal 
muscle hamstring injuries) appeared in only 64 games, batting .203 with 
12 RBIs and two home runs.[3] On August 4, he was designated for assignment 
to make room for Nate McLouth and spent the rest of the season with AAA 
Norfolk. On December 31, 2012 Chavez signed a minor league contract with 
the Kansas City Royals,[12] but was released on March 22, 2013. On March 
24, Chavez signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners and 
appeared in 97 games for the Mariners hitting .267.[13] On March 8, 2016, 
Chavez signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish, in the Atlantic League.[14] 
Chavez was very successful in his first season with the Bluefish, batting
