Curtis Benton Welch (February 11, 1862 â€“ August 29, 1896) was a Major League 
Baseball center fielder for the Toledo Blue Stockings, St. Louis Browns, 
Philadelphia Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati Reds, and Louisville 
Colonels. Welch started his professional baseball career in 1883 with Toledo 
of the Northwestern League and stayed with the club when it moved to the 
American Association the following year. In 1885, he joined the St. Louis 
Browns (today's Cardinals). Welch scored the series-winning run in extra 
innings of game 6 of the 1886 World Series in a close play at the plate 
famous among baseball fans of his generation as the "$15,000 slide."[1] 
After three seasons with St. Louis, Welch went to Philadelphia and had 
a career-high .282 batting average in 1888. He played for the Athletics 
until 1890 and then had short stints with the Orioles, Reds, and Colonels.[2] 
His major league career ended in 1893, and he spent the next two seasons 
with the Eastern League's Syracuse Stars.[3] Welch led the AA in hit by 
pitches in 1888, 1890, and 1891, and he ranked third in stolen bases in 
1886 and 1888.[2] He was regarded as one of the best defensive center fielders 
of the 19th century.[1] In the 2010 book The New Bill James Historical 
Baseball Abstract, Bill James ranked Welch as the 83rd greatest center 
fielder of all-time.[4] Welch's career was damaged by his drinking, and
