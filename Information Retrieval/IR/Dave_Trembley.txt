As Manager As coach David Michael Trembley (born October 31, 1951 in Carthage, 
New York) is an American professional baseball executive who served as 
director of player development of the Atlanta Braves in 2015. Trembley 
has been the bench coach for the Houston Astros, and a manager of the Baltimore 
Orioles.[1] Before managing the Orioles Trembley was a minor league manager 
for twenty seasons compiling a 1369–1413 record. He won two league titles 
and earned Manager of the Year awards in three leagues. In December 2001, 
Baseball America selected him as one of minor league baseball's top five 
managers of the previous 20 years. He served as a coach in the inaugural 
Futures Game in 1999 and also served as manager for the Southern League 
and Double-A All-Star Games that season. Trembley has worked for the Baltimore 
Orioles, Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Diego Padres and Atlanta 
Braves. Trembley taught and coached baseball for three years (1977–79) 
at Daniel Murphy High School in Los Angeles and was the head baseball coach 
for five years (1980–84) at Antelope Valley College in Los Angeles County, 
where he also was a physical education instructor. He began his career 
in professional baseball as a Los Angeles-area scout for the Chicago Cubs 
in 1984. The next season, he became an instructor in the Cubs minor league 
system until June, when he was named to coach at their Wytheville club 
in the Appalachian League. Trembley left the Cubs organization to embark 
on his managing career with the unaffiliated Kinston Eagles franchise of 
the Class A Carolina League in 1986. It began a stretch in which he would 
manage in the minors in 20 of the ensuing 21 years (the lone exception 
being the 1990 season).[2] He joined the Pirates organization in 1987, 
and skippered their AA Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League for three 
seasons, capturing an EL title and being named the loop's Manager of the 
Year. He was named the Minor League Manager of the Year by Baseball America 
in 1987. At the end of the 1989 season, he managed the Eastern League All-Star 
Team that toured the Soviet Union Diamond Diplomacy Tour. In 1990 he served 
as Director of the day-to-day operation of Pittsburgh's minor league complex 
and spring training facility at Bradenton, Florida. Trembley was hired 
by the San Diego Padres in 1991, and managed their Class A South Atlantic 
League affiliate Charleston (SC) Rainbows in 1991 and 1992. He spent the 
1993 season guiding the AA Wichita Wranglers before rejoining the Cubs 
organization, where he managed nine years (1994–2002) at three different 
levels. Trembley earned his second league title and Manager of the Year 
honor in 1995 when he led Class A Daytona to the Florida State League title, 
and also was named Manager of the Year in the Southern League in 1999 after 
guiding the Class AA West Tenn Diamond Jaxx to first-place finishes in 
each half of the split-season. Trembley joined the Baltimore Orioles organization 
when he was named manager of the Bowie Baysox on January 27, 2003.[3] His 
hiring was part of the Orioles' plan to improve its underachieving farm 
system with an emphasis on fundamentals and discipline.[4] Taking over 
a ballclub that had ended its previous three seasons in or below fifth 
place in the Eastern League's Southern Division, he led the Baysox to fourth 
at 69–72 in 2003.[5] The 13½-game improvement earned him the organization's 
Cal Ripken, Sr. Player Development Award. The only Orioles affiliate to 
post a winning record in 2004,[6] the Baysox finished above .500 for the 
first time since 1997 at 73–69.[7] Trembley achieved his 1,200th victory 
as a minor-league manager during that campaign in a win over the Binghamton 
Mets on July 9.He managed the Eastern League All Star Team that season 
{2004}.[8] He moved up to the Ottawa Lynx in a similar capacity, replacing 
Tim Leiper on December 2, 2004.[6] Trembley managed the Orioles' AAA team 
at Ottawa Lynx in 2005 and 2006 combining to go 143–144.[2] He was promoted 
to Baltimore when he was named its bullpen coach on February 14, 2007. 
He succeeded Rick Dempsey who joined the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network as 
the primary studio analyst for Orioles game telecasts.[9] In addition to 
his tenure in organized Minor League Baseball, Trembley also managed one 
winter at Navajoa in the Mexican Pacific League, and coached third base 
for two years for Magallanes in the Venezuelan Winter League. He managed 
16 seasons in the Florida and Arizona Instructional League. Trembley was 
named interim manager of the Orioles following Sam Perlozzo's dismissal 
on June 18, 2007.[10] He inherited a 29–40 ballclub that was mired in last 
place in the American League (AL) East and in the midst of an eight-game 
losing streak. As a result of a 29–25 stretch, he had the interim tag removed 
from his title as his contract was extended through the 2008 season on 
August 22.[11] Later that same night, the Orioles began a nine-game losing 
streak by surrendering the most runs ever in an AL contest in a 30–3 defeat 
to the Texas Rangers in the first game of a twi-night doubleheader at Camden 
Yards.[12] The team avoided last place in the AL East despite losing 28 
of its last 39 contests.[13] The Orioles exercised their option on Trembley's 
contract through the 2009 season on September 5, 2008,[14] even though 
they were in last place at 63–76. They finished at the bottom of the division 
this time by dropping 17 of its final 22 games, including ten in a row.[15] 
His contract was similarly extended again a year later on October 2, 2009 
despite another last-place finish, a worse record and a 24–50 performance 
after the All-Star break.[16][17] The moves were made because the team 
was in a rebuilding phase, and it was hoped that his emphasis on fundamentals 
would help the development of its young players.[18] With the Orioles still 
stuck in last place in the AL East with a major-league-worst 15–39 record 
and an eight-game losing streak, Trembley was fired on June 4, 2010 and 
replaced by third-base coach Juan Samuel. The ballclub's 2–16 start was 
the second worst in franchise history. They were also stricken by a rash 
of injuries and the lowest run production in the majors a third into the 
campaign. Trembley had become a target for increasing criticism from fans 
who felt his disciplinary approach was too soft and that he mishandled 
the bullpen. Details of the latter included overworking his relief pitchers 
and putting them in situations to fail.[18] His tenure lasted just under 
three years with a 187–283 record.[19] His .398 win percentage was the 
second-lowest in club history behind Jimmy Dykes' .351 mark in 1954, the 
franchise's first season in Baltimore.[20] On October 19, 2012, Trembley 
was announced to be a member of the 2013 Houston Astros coaching staff.[21] 
Later that year, it was announced Trembley would be the third base coach. 
He was the field co-ordinator for the Atlanta Braves during the 2011 and 
2012 seasons. Trembley was relieved of his duties as the Houston Astros 
bench coach on September 1, 2014,[22][23] and rejoined the Braves as director 
of player development in October.[24] Trembley has a bachelor's degree 
in physical education and a master's degree in education, both from the 
State University of New York at Brockport. He also did graduate work in 
sports psychology at Penn State. In the offseason, Trembley, his wife, 
Patti, and their son, Kevin, live in Daytona Beach Shores, Florida. He 
was inducted into the Lancaster JetHawks Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008, 
Antelope Valley College Sports Hall of Fame in 2009, and the Florida State 
League Hall of Fame in 2012.Inducted into the State University of New York
