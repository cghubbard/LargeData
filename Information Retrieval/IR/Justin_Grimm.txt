Justin Scott Grimm (born August 16, 1988) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball. He previously played 
for the Texas Rangers. Grimm attended Virginia High School in Bristol, 
Virginia, where he played for the school's baseball team. He was projected 
as a third- or fourth-round pick out of high school in the 2007 Major League 
Baseball draft, but he fell to the 13th round where he was drafted by the 
Boston Red Sox.[1][2] He fell in large part due to his commitment to the 
University of Georgia. He opted against pro baseball, enrolling at the 
University of Georgia where he played college baseball for the Georgia 
Bulldogs from 2008 to 2010. In his freshman year he pitched 31 innings 
with a 10.91 ERA. His sophomore year was considerably better as he pitched 
78 innings with a 4.15 ERA. In his third and final year at Georgia, he 
posted a 5.49 ERA in 77 innings.[2] Grimm was drafted by the Texas Rangers 
in the fifth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft out of the University 
of Georgia.[3] Grimm made his MLB debut on June 16, 2012, against the Houston 
Astros. He won his debut, pitching six innings, striking out seven, walking 
none, and throwing 88 pitches for 56 strikes.[4] Grimm was the first pitcher 
to have seven strikeouts and no walks in a debut since Stephen Strasburg's 
debut on June 8, 2010.[5] On May 2, 2013, Grimm was named American League 
Rookie of the Month for April. During April, Grimm held a 2–0 record with 
a 1.59 ERA in 3 starts, striking out 15 and holding opponents to a .239 
batting average in 17.0 innings.[6] In the first half of the 2013 season, 
Grimm went into the All-Star Break with a 7–7 record and a 6.37 ERA. His 
final three Rangers' appearances saw him go 0-2 and pitch 11.1 innings, 
giving up 23 hits, 6 walks, and 15 runs.[7] The Rangers traded Grimm to 
the Chicago Cubs on July 22, 2013, with Mike Olt, C. J. Edwards, and Neil 
Ramirez, in exchange for Matt Garza.[8] He was optioned to the Triple-A 
Iowa Cubs on July 23 and lost his first start for Iowa, giving up 7 earned 
runs in two innings including six straight hits to start the second inning.[9] 
When major league rosters expanded in September, Grimm was recalled to 
the Cubs. Grimm finished the season in the Cubs' bullpen, working 9 innings 
and posting a 2.00 ERA. Going into 2014 spring training, it was announced 
that Grimm would move to the Cubs' bullpen due to the considerable depth 
within the Cubs' starting rotation. At the end of spring training, Grimm 
made the Cubs' opening-day roster as a relief pitcher. On August 29, 2014, 
Grimm became the 68th pitcher in Major League history to strike out four 
batters in a single inning.[10] Grimm finished the 2014 season with a 5–2 
record, a 3.78 ERA and 70 strikeouts over 69 innings pitched, working primarily
