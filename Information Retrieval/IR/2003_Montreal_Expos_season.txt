The 2003 Montreal Expos season was a season in baseball, and the 35th season 
for the Expos in Montreal. It involved the Expos attempting to win the 
NL East. On August 28, 2003, the Expos led the NL Wild Card, tied for first 
place with the Marlins, Astros, Phillies, and Cardinals, but faded away 
in the stretch and failed to make the postseason. On August 30, 2002, MLB 
signed a collective bargaining agreement with the players association, 
which prohibited contraction through the end of the agreement in 2006.[2] 
Ultimately, the Expos finished 8 games behind the Wild Card (and World 
Series Champion) Florida Marlins. Although their attendance increased from 
7,935 per game in 2001[3] to 10,031 in 2002,[4] MLB decided that the Expos 
would play 22 of their home games at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, 
Puerto Rico in 2003. Despite being a considerably smaller facility (it 
seats approximately 19,000) than Montreal's Olympic Stadium, attendance 
in San Juan's Hiram Bithorn Stadium averaged 14,222, compared with 12,081 
in Montreal.[5] The Puerto Rican baseball fans embraced "Los Expos" (particularly 
Puerto Rican players José Vidro, Javier Vázquez and Wil Cordero, and other 
Latin players like Vladimir Guerrero and Liván Hernández) as their home 
team (as well as the Latin players from other teams), all the while hoping 
the team would make a permanent move to Puerto Rico. Thanks in part to 
the San Juan games, the Expos were able to draw over a million fans at 
home in 2003 for the first time since 1997.[5] The Expos' season in Puerto 
Rico was chronicled in the MLB-produced DVD Boricua Beisbol – Passion of
