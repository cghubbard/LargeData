The Auburn Doubledays are a minor league baseball team in Auburn, New York, 
USA, that is owned and operated by Auburn Community Baseball. They are 
a member of the Short-Season Class A New York–Penn League and have been 
a farm team of the Houston Astros (1982–2000), the Toronto Blue Jays (2001–2010), 
and Washington Nationals (from 2011).[2] The Doubledays are the most recent 
name of the Auburn entry in the New York-Penn League that dates back to 
1958. From 1982–1995, the team operated as the Auburn Astros. The Doubledays 
play home games at Leo Pinckney Field at Falcon Park. The "new" Falcon 
Park opened in June 1995, replacing the original Falcon Park which was 
built in 1927 on the same site. Falcon Park seats 2,800 fans. In 2008, 
new blue box seats were installed. The team and its mascot are named after 
Abner Doubleday, the Civil War general and Auburn native apocryphally credited 
with inventing the game of baseball. Abner wears number 96 in honor of 
the birth of the team in 1996. Baseball in Auburn dates back to at least 
1958. The current franchise began operations in 1982. In 1958, the team 
was founded as the Auburn Yankees, as an affiliate of the New York Yankees. 
The Yankees affiliation lasted until 1961 and the club included future 
major league All-Stars; Jim Bouton, Joe Pepitone and Mel Stottlemyre. The 
team then became affiliated with the New York Mets, as the Auburn Mets. 
With a roster that included Billy Wynne, Don Shaw, Tug McGraw, and Jerry 
Koosman; the club won the league championship three times, in 1962, 1964 
and 1966.[3] In 1967 the club changed affiliation again to the Auburn Twins, 
and were affiliated with the Minnesota Twins. The Twins won league title 
in 1967 and 1970. In 1972, the team was renamed the Auburn Phillies and 
were associated with the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1973, under manager 
Harry Lloyd, the team won its only League Championship. Future major leaguers 
Luis Aguayo, Randy Lerch, Dickie Noles, Lonnie Smith and Ozzie Virgil, 
among numerous others, played for the team. Managers of note included Mike 
Compton and Ruben Amaro. In 1978 the team became the Auburn Sunsets and 
were co-operated by the Phillies and Houston Astros. Managed by Dick Rockwell, 
the team went 32-40, finishing third in the league's Yawkey Division.[4] 
The team featured future Major League Baseball players Carmelo Castillo 
and Alejandro Sanchez and future Major League general manager Dave Littlefield.[5] 
In 1979 the club became known as the Auburn Red Stars. The team featured 
future Major League Baseball player Doug Frobel.[5] The Red Stars operated 
under a co-operative agreement. The Red Stars received players from about 
seven different major league organizations, led by the Detroit Tigers, 
with seven players, and Cleveland Indians, with five. In 1980 the Red Stars 
changed their name to the Auburn Americans. The team once again operated 
as a co-op and received 17 players from the Cleveland Indians and several 
from the Los Angeles Dodgers. The squad featured future Major League Baseball 
player Jack Fimple and finished fourth in the NY-Penn League's West Division 
with a 29-45 record.[6][7] Auburn returned to play in the New York-Penn 
League in 1982 with the Auburn Astros. In 1991, with John H. Graham as 
general manager,[8] the team set the all-time attendance record at Falcon 
Park. At the end of the 1995 season, the team was renamed the Auburn Doubledays, 
the name under which it has operated from 1996 to the present. In 1998 
the Doubledays and the Oneonta Yankees were named Co-Champions of the NY 
Penn League after Central New York was hit with a torrential rain storm 
and the fields at both parks were deemed unplayable. The Doubledays won 
the Pinckney Division title for six straight years in 2002, 2003, 2004, 
2005, 2006 and 2007, but failed to win the league championship for the 
first five of those years. After losing in the first round of the playoffs 
for the first three years of their streak, they advanced to the New York–Penn 
League Championship series before being swept by the Staten Island Yankees. 
In 2003, the Doubledays led all of baseball in winning percentage (.757). 
The Doubledays finally won the NY Penn League title in 2007, sweeping the 
Brooklyn Cyclones in the League Championship series. The final game featured 
a stellar pitching performance by Brett Cecil and a home run by J.P. Arencibia.[9] 
This was the first league championship for the city of Auburn since 1973.
