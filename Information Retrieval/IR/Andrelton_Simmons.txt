Andrelton A. Simmons (born September 4, 1989) is a Curaçaoan professional 
baseball shortstop for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He stands 6'2" and weighs 195 lbs. He previously played 
in MLB for the Atlanta Braves. Drawing considerable attention for his defensive 
abilities, Simmons has won a National League Rawlings Platinum Glove Award, 
two Rawlings Gold Glove Awards for shortstops, a Wilson MLB Overall Defensive 
Player of the Year Award and three Fielding Bible Awards. Simmons played 
youth baseball alongside fellow Curaçao natives Kenley Jansen and Didi 
Gregorius; he also played basketball and soccer.[1] Due to his slight build, 
Simmons did not draw much attention from MLB scouts until attending Western 
Oklahoma State College in Altus, Oklahoma. As a freshman at Western Oklahoma 
State, Simmons hit .472 with seven home runs and 40 RBIs, leading his team 
to the 2010 NJCAA Division II College World Series.[2] Simmons was drafted 
by the Atlanta Braves in the second round of the 2010 Major League Baseball 
Draft out of Western Oklahoma State College.[3] Prior to the 2012 season, 
Simmons was the Braves' fourth best prospect according to Baseball America.[4] 
He was ranked 92nd in all of baseball.[5] During spring training he competed 
with Tyler Pastornicky for the Braves starting shortstop job.[6][7] On 
May 30, 2012, the Braves called Simmons up,[8] and he made his Major League 
debut on June 2 against the Washington Nationals.[9] He got his first Major 
League hit, a double, on June 3.[10] Simmons was named National League 
Rookie of the Month for June 2012 after hitting .333 with six doubles, 
three home runs and 14 RBIs in June 25 games. He led all NL rookies in 
batting average and on-base percentage.[11] Simmons also won praise for 
his outstanding defense, and is considered as arguably the best defensive 
shortstop in the game.[12][13] On July 8, 2012, during a game against the 
Philadelphia Phillies, Simmons suffered a non-displaced fracture of the 
fifth metacarpal on his right hand while sliding head-first into second 
base.[14] On July 9, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list.[15] In 
2013, Simmons played for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the World Baseball 
Classic.[16] On June 4, 2013, Simmons hit his first walk-off hit.[17] He 
finished the 2013 season with the highest Defensive Runs Saved ever recorded 
in a year[18] and received the Gold Glove,[19] the Fielding Bible,[20] 
and the Rawlings Platinum Glove Award[21] for his defensive work that season. 
On February 20, 2014, the Atlanta Braves signed Simmons to a seven-year 
deal worth $58 million.[22][23] At the end of the year, Simmons and then-teammate 
Jason Heyward won the Gold Glove[24] and Fielding Bible[25] for their respective 
positions. On November 12, 2015, Simmons, along with catcher Jose Briceno, 
was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for Erick Aybar, Sean Newcomb 
and Chris Ellis.[26] In a May 9, 2016, game against the Tampa Bay Rays, 
Simmons tore the ulnar collateral ligament of his left thumb and was placed
