Suburban/Urban, 1,050 acres (4.2 km2) (Old Westbury campus)[4][8] New York 
Institute of Technology (also known as NYIT) is a private, independent, 
nonprofit, non-sectarian, coeducational research university. Founded in 
1910, NYIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and focuses 
on the instruction and research of technical arts and applied sciences.[12] 
The university has three New York campuses: one in Old Westbury, Nassau 
County, Long Island; one in Central Islip, Suffolk County, Long Island; 
and one near Columbus Circle in Manhattan. As well, it has a cybersecurity 
research center in Port Washington, New York. NYIT also has campuses in 
Arkansas, United Arab Emirates, China and Canada. NYIT has five schools 
and two colleges, all with an emphasis on technology and applied scientific 
research. NYIT offers 100 degree programs, including undergraduate, graduate, 
and professional degrees, in 50 fields of study, including architecture 
and design; arts and sciences; education; engineering and computing sciences; 
health professions; management; and osteopathic medicine.[13] NYIT is the 
birthplace of entirely 3D CGI films.[14][15][16][17] NYIT enrolls 9,500 
students across its campuses in New York State. U.S. News & World Report 
lists NYIT as a "selective" university and consistently ranks it in the 
"top 50" among U.S. universities in the North.[1][18] In 1910, NYIT’s predecessor, 
New York Technical Institute, was licensed by the New York State Board 
of Regents. In 1955, NYIT opened under a provisional charter granted by 
the New York State Board of Regents to NYIT. Its first campus opened at 
500 Pacific Street in the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.[19] The founders 
of NYIT, and in particular, Alexander Schure,[20] started NYIT with the 
mission of offering career-oriented professional education, providing all 
qualified students access to opportunity, and supporting applications-oriented 
research Schure later served as NYIT's first president.[20] [21] In the 
higher education community at the time, a debate arose around the concern 
that humanities studies would be overshadowed by too much emphasis on science 
and engineering. NYIT's goal was to create a balance between science/engineering 
and a liberal arts education, and ever since, it has been focusing on this 
model to prepare students for current and future careers. By the 1958–1959 
academic year, the university had 300 students, and the time had come to 
expand its physical operations. In April 1958, the college purchased the 
Pythian Temple at 135–145 W. 70th St. in Manhattan for its main center. 
The building, adjacent to the planned Lincoln Center for the Performing 
Arts, was an ornate 12-story structure with a columned entranceway. Built 
in 1929 at a cost of $2 million, it included among its features a 1,200-seat 
auditorium. In 1958, NYIT sponsored the first National Technology Awards, 
created by Frederick Pittera, an organizer of international fairs and a 
member of the NYIT Board of Trustees, to help raise funds for the NYIT 
science and technology laboratories. The awards, held at the Waldorf-Astoria 
Hotel, were attended by several hundred guests, with entertainment provided 
by the U.S. Air Force Band. 36th President of the United States Lyndon 
Johnson was the keynote speaker. His speech was broadcast nationally by 
the ABC Radio Network. Among the honorees were Dr. Wernher von Braun and 
Major General Bernard Schriever, Commanding General of the Ballistic Air 
Command. Photos, press clippings, and audio tapes of the event are on view 
at the Lyndon Johnson Library at Austin, Texas. In 1959, NYIT introduced 
“teaching machines” for student instruction in physics, electronics, and 
mathematics.[21] NYIT also pioneered the use of mainframes as a teaching 
tool, having received its first, donated by the CIT Financial Corporation, 
in 1965. The curriculum was successful enough that NYIT received two grants 
totaling approximately $3 million from the federal government – one to 
develop a system of individualized learning through the use of computers; 
the other to develop a computer-based course in general physics for midshipmen 
at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.[22] NYIT was a pioneer 
in 3-D computer animation. Before Pixar and Lucasfilm, there was New York 
Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab.[23] In 1974, New York Institute 
of Technology Computer Graphics Lab was established and attracted the likes 
of: Pixar Animation Studios President Edwin Catmull and co-founder Alvy 
Ray Smith; Walt Disney Feature Animation Chief Scientist Lance Williams; 
DreamWorks animator Hank Grebe; and Netscape and Silicon Graphics founder 
James H. Clark.[24] Researchers at the New York Institute of Technology 
Computer Graphics Lab created the tools that made entirely 3D CGI films 
possible.[14] NYIT CG Lab was regarded as the top computer animation research 
and development group in the world during the late 70s and early 80s.[25][26] 
In 1995, the NYIT School of Engineering took first place in the U.S. Department 
of Energy’s Clean Air Road Rally. The student engineering team spent three 
years designing and building the high-performance hybrid electric car that 
beat 43 other vehicles.[27] In 1998, NYIT opened its first international 
program in China. In 1999, Bill Gates spoke at NYIT and received NYIT's 
Presidential Medal.[28][29][30] In 2002, NYIT installed the fastest broadband 
network on the East Coast.[31] From 2000 to 2015, NYIT invested approximately 
$1 billion in initiatives to enhance the quality of the university, including 
campus infrastructure, a larger faculty, new endowed chairs and professorships. 
The money came from federal grants, New York state grants, and National 
Science Foundation grants, as well as university funding and contributions 
from alumni, corporations and foundations.[34] For example, in 2002, federal 
government awarded NYIT $0.3 million for a new cyber security lab,[28] 
in 2009, NYIT received a multimillion-dollar donation from Lumeta Corporation,[35] 
in 2011, NYIT received a $0.16 million grant from the Verizon Foundation,[36] 
in 2013, NYIT received $1.4 million in state and federal grants for a portion 
of the costs required for constructing NYIT's new $4 million Entrepreneurship 
Technology Innovation Center,[37][38] in 2014, NYIT received a $0.23 million 
National Science Foundation grant to purchase a sputtering machine, used 
in the electronics and medical fields to create thin film sensors,[37] 
and in 2015, NYIT received from New York State a grant of $0.4 million 
for a portion of the costs required to renovate a 5,300-square-foot facility 
to house three new laboratories on its Old Westbury campus.[39] Some of 
the steps that NYIT took in the 2015–2016 academic year, in implementing 
the strategic plan, include: New York Institute of Technology's Old Westbury, 
New York, campus is seated on 1,050 acres (425 ha). It encompasses numerous 
contiguous former estates situated in the beautiful wooded hillsides of 
Old Westbury, New York. Some of these estates were formerly owned by members 
of the Rockefeller family.[45] Opened in 1965, the campus is largest in 
size, but in student population. It has many buildings including a sports 
complex, administrative and academic buildings, a 100-seat "smart" auditorium,[46] 
several dining halls, a bookstore, as well as NYIT's de Seversky Mansion, 
a party and event venue on Long Island, and one of the largest houses in 
the United States.[47] It was developed on and around the nucleus of the 
former C. V. Whitney estate and includes several former North Shore estates. 
Original buildings have been reconstructed for educational use while retaining 
the charm of traditional exteriors. To preserve the natural beauty of the 
landscape, other buildings are clustered in low, modern structures surrounded 
by trees and open vistas. Classroom buildings and parking areas are connected 
by walkways through woods and meadows untouched by construction. Plazas 
connect classroom buildings and act as outdoor rooms for students and faculty. 
Concerts, lectures, and informal recreational events are frequently scheduled 
on campus.[48] Athletic facilities at NYIT's Old Westbury campus include 
the 1,000-seat President's Stadium, the President's Field, the 500-seat 
Recreation Hall arena, the NYIT Softball Complex and the NYIT Tennis Complex 
consisting of six courts. Many notable people, including Patch Adams, spoke 
at NYIT's Riland Auditorium on its Old Westbury campus.[49] The Old Westbury 
campus is mainly a commuter campus, although residential students have 
dormitory options.[50] Old Westbury campus is also home to the New York 
Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine, the only osteopathic 
medical school on Long Island, which was formerly named New York College 
of Osteopathic Medicine, or NYCOM. In 2008, NYIT installed a 3-D motion 
capture lab for its Fine Arts program in Old Westbury. The system allows 
the university to use Hollywood technology to teach the next generation 
of computer animators. Between 2009 and 2013, NYIT's Old Westbury campus 
has undergone a number of significant improvements, including renovation 
of the 3,000 sf. Student Activities Center, creation of a Life Sciences 
biomedical research laboratory, renovation of Engineering Materials lab, 
creation of a Nursing Simulation lab and creation of an 8,000 sf. Entrepreneurship 
and Technology Innovation Center, among others.[51] In 2014, NYIT announced 
a $93 million plan to erect seven new buildings on its Old Westbury campus, 
including four, four-story residence halls.[52][53] In 2015, NYIT received 
from New York State a grant for a portion of the costs required to renovate 
a 5,300-square-foot facility to house three new laboratories on its Old 
Westbury campus.[39] According to Bloomberg/Businessweek, in 2011, Old 
Westbury is the second "richest" town in the United States, trailing behind 
only Palm Beach, Florida.[54] The magazine previously dubbed the town "New 
York's wealthiest suburb."[55] The Manhattan campus is located between 
60th and 62nd streets on Broadway, adjacent to Columbus Circle, across 
the street from Central Park and within walking distance of Lincoln Center 
for the Performing Arts. Its central location is accessible via subway 
and bus routes and is close to concert halls, theaters, museums, and libraries. 
It is served by public transit buses and the A,B,C,D, and 1 Subway trains, 
which are accessed at the 59th Street/Columbus Circle station. NYIT's free 
weekday shuttles between the Long Island Railroad (LIRR) stations in Manhasset 
and Hicksville and NYIT's Old Westbury campus are available to all NYIT 
students, faculty, and staff.[56] While it offers a full range of classes 
in all of NYIT's major schools, the majority of students enroll in programs 
that concentrate in media, communications, business, computer science, 
and engineering. The campus comprises five buildings (excluding the residence 
halls):[57] The Student Activity Building, 1849 Broadway, has a student 
lounge, recreation areas, food services, a bookstore, and the offices of 
the Student Government Association as well as other clubs and student organizations. 
The Office of Student Activities is located on the second floor. The NYIT 
Auditorium on Broadway has a seating capacity of 268. The offices of Counseling 
and Wellness Services, Disability Services, Campus Life, Career Services, 
Student Employment, and Housing and Residential Life, are located at 26 
West 61st Street. In 2014, NYIT opened a simulated trading floor, equipped 
with the latest technologies, including hardware, software, databases and 
datafeeds, on the fifth floor of the 26 W. 61st Street building.[58][59] 
The Student Solutions Center (Enrollment Services, Bursar, Financial Aid, 
and Registrar) and International Education are located in the New Technology 
Building, 16 West 61st Street.[48] NYIT Manhattan campus is home to student 
clubs and organizations such as Students Working to Achieve Greatness, 
Phi Iota Alpha,[60] the Allied Health Life Science Organization, Bear Hug 
Club, Student Nurses Association, Dance Club, American Medical Student 
Association, Student Programming Association, Society of Hosteurs, and 
American Institute for Architecture Students. Residential students have 
three dormitory options for the Manhattan campus: Riverside Terrace Residence 
Hall, the 20th Street Residence Hall, and the Anderson Residence Hall, 
all of which are supervised by full-time staff.[61] NYIT Auditorium on 
Broadway hosts events, including the Lumen Prize Exhibition,[62] and the 
SAG-AFTRA Foundation’s Conversation Series, bringing in celebrities such 
as Carey Mulligan, Gloria Steinem, Meryl Streep, Mark Ruffalo and Leslee 
Udwin, among others, to NYIT's campus in Manhattan.[63][64][65] NYIT Auditorium 
on Broadway has 3-D screening capabilities.[37] Recruiters from major companies 
such as Google visit the Manhattan campus regularly for luncheons with 
students and information sessions.[66] Located in the heart of Suffolk 
County on Long Island amid a bustling, developing suburb, the sprawling 
grounds of NYIT's Central Islip campus feature Georgian-style brick buildings 
in a wooded setting. The 600 acres (240 ha) Central Islip, New York, campus 
contains its own residence halls with student lounges and laundry facilities, 
dining hall, classroom buildings, library, a medical facility, coffee house, 
a gourmet restaurant that is part of NYIT's culinary arts program, and 
fitness facilities including a bowling alley, tennis courts, swimming pool, 
clubhouse, athletic fields,a health care facility, gymnasium, two fitness 
centers and a nine-hole golf course.[9] NYIT bought most of the modern 
buildings of the now-defunct Central Islip Psychiatric Center, and incorporated 
them in its Central Islip campus after remodeling and renovating them. 
This campus is home to NYIT’s Vocational Independence Program; no undergraduate 
or graduate courses are held there.[67] This site is also home to the family 
health care center of NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine, and the Technology 
Based Learning Systems research center of NYIT. NYIT medical students acquire 
real-world experience at the NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine health 
care center, where more than 3,500 patients from the local community are 
treated each year.[48] In March 2014, NYIT announced plans to open an osteopathic 
medical school site in Jonesboro, Arkansas, by acquiring and renovating 
a building belonging to Arkansas State University-Jonesboro, for approximately 
$13 million.[68][69] The distinctive three-story yellow brick building, 
the Wilson Hall at Arkansas State University, once housed Arkansas State 
University's library, auditorium (complete with balcony seating), and administrative 
offices as well as the laboratories, kitchens, studios, sewing rooms, classrooms 
and offices that served all departments of the arts and sciences.[70][71] 
In April 2015, Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation awarded 
initial approval for the osteopathic medical school site in Jonesboro, 
Arkansas.[72] Renovations have already started at the 86,000-square-foot 
Wilson Hall to prepare for the new site. NYIT started hiring faculty members 
for the new site.[73] In December 2015, NYIT’s College of Osteopathic Medicine 
received final approval from Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation 
to recruit students, open a second location on the campus of Arkansas State 
University in August 2016 and become the first osteopathic medical school 
in Arkansas.[69][74] NYIT formerly had research centers in Florida.[75][76] 
In 2011, NYIT’s College of Osteopathic Medicine opened a Family Health 
Care Center in Central Islip, New York, and in 2014, NYIT’s College of 
Osteopathic Medicine opened another Family Health Care Center in Uniondale, 
New York.[28] NYIT opened a 10,000 square feet cybersecurity center in 
Port Washington, New York in 2015.[44] NYIT partners with the Nederlander 
Organization, one of the largest operators of legitimate theatres and music 
venues in the United States, for NYIT's theater-related education programs.[77] 
NYIT’s College of Osteopathic Medicine has clinical affiliations with the 
following hospitals: In addition to its United States locations, NYIT has 
campuses in the following countries: NYIT-Abu Dhabi campus lies in the 
Center of Excellence for Applied Research and Training (CERT) Technology 
Park, home to international companies such as Intel, Honeywell and Lucent 
Technologies.[78] It is a modern university facility adjacent to Abu Dhabi 
Men's College. The classrooms feature technologies such as smartboards 
and high-tech computers. NYIT-Abu Dhabi has a library collection, catering 
services and parking facilities. At NYIT-Abu Dhabi, students can participate 
in extra- and co-curricular activities. Notable people who spoke at NYIT-Abu 
Dhabi include U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings.[79] NYIT-Nanjing 
was established in collaboration with Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 
NYIT-Nanjing students have access to Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications 
residence halls, dining facilities, and activities.[80] NYIT's campus is 
separate but joined with the campus of Nanjing University of Posts and 
Telecommunications. The courses are taught in English, and students get 
the equivalent of an American degree without the expense of traveling abroad. 
Graduates have an option to earn 'parallel degrees' from NYIT and NUPT 
or, if they choose, just the NYIT degree. Students can study solely in 
Nanjing or can opt to take some of their courses at NYIT campuses in New 
York. Enrollment at NYIT-Nanjing is projected to eventually reach 6,000.[81] 
Faculty of International Media of Communication University of China (commonly 
referred to as ICUC) is a Ministry of Education in China-approved Media 
Technology Center that NYIT launched with the Communication University 
of China in Beijing in 2015. It is the first China-foreign, cooperatively-run 
institution in media approved by the Ministry of Education. It offers dual-degree 
graduate and undergraduate programs. Students are taught first by Beijing-based 
NYIT and Communication University of China faculty members and then have 
the option to complete their studies at NYIT's New York campuses. The campus 
includes NYIT-designed digital laboratories and a distance-learning, video-presence 
classroom connected to NYIT's New York campuses. NYIT students in Beijing 
are able to remotely operate equipment in NYIT's high-tech Home for Innovation, 
Visualization, and Exploration (HIVE) Center in New York with its motion 
capture, 3-D, and visualization tools. The interconnectivity of the New 
York and Beijing programs enables students and faculty members to collaborate 
on creative projects and reviews. The NYIT-CUC programs are highly selective, 
and students chosen from throughout China had to meet both NYIT and CUC 
admissions standards, including the ability to take their courses in English. 
The curriculum and requirements of each program are identical to NYIT courses 
and programs offered in New York.[82] NYIT has sites and programs in Nanchang, 
Shanghai, and Shenzhen.[83] NYIT-Vancouver is located in downtown Vancouver, 
in the heart of the financial district and close to many cultural venues.[84] 
NYIT-Manama offered undergraduate and graduate degrees until 2014 in fields 
including business, computer graphics, engineering, and interior design.[85] 
NYIT-Amman offered until 2013 undergraduate and graduate degrees in fields 
including business, computer graphics, engineering, and information technology.[86] 
NYIT's undergraduate and graduate programs are divided into seven schools 
and colleges. Collaboration among the schools and colleges is frequent, 
as mandated by a number of interdisciplinary degree programs and research 
centers.[13] NYIT comprises the following academic schools and colleges:[13] 
Ellis College of NYIT was created as an online division of NYIT operating 
under NYIT missions to provide career-oriented professional education and 
access to opportunity. In the fall of 2008, NYIT phased out its Ellis College 
branch.[87] Even though the New York Institute of Technology is a private 
institution, it receives funds from the New York State.[88] NYIT receives 
funding from a variety of sources including endowment, tuition, fees, grants, 
donations and alumni contributions, as well as proceeds from NYIT de Seversky 
Mansion,[89] among others. In 2014, the institute annual revenue amounted 
to over $0.3 billion.[90] In 2015, NYIT was ranked 14th in New York State 
by average professor salaries.[91] 95% of faculty at NYIT hold their doctorate 
or other terminal degree.[92] NYIT holds full accreditation in over 50 
academic areas. Nationally, fewer than 100 colleges and universities match 
this achievement.[93][94][95][96] As the liberal arts and sciences college 
of NYIT, NYIT's College of Art and Sciences is committed to serving not 
only the students who pursue their degrees in this College, but all NYIT 
undergraduates who depend on CAS for developing foundational academic skills 
and completing general education and other critical pieces of their education. 
As of 2015, the College of Arts and Sciences at NYIT offers 28 undergraduate 
and five graduate degree programs in departments including Behavioral Sciences, 
Communication Arts, Fine Arts, Interdisciplinary Studies, English and Speech, 
Mathematics, Physics, Social Sciences, Urban Administration and Life Sciences.[97][98] 
The College of Arts and Sciences is home to NYIT's undergraduate Core Curriculum.[99] 
In 2016, the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security 
designated NYIT as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense 
Education.[100] Since fall 2010, all undergraduates at NYIT are required 
to complete the Core Curriculum. NYIT’s core curriculum was created to 
provide undergraduate students with an outcomes-oriented education that 
will prepare them for today’s workforce.[101][102] The student body consists 
of more than 12,000 graduate and undergraduate students (fall 2013) and 
around 1,000 academic faculty (fall 2013). The student body at NYIT is 
60% male and 40% female.[7] NYIT New York includes four libraries:[103] 
Access to the collection of books, periodicals and jourmals is open to 
registered NYIT students and alumni. On site use of special collections 
is also available to visiting students and researchers. NYIT collections 
include more than 100,000 books, 200 databases, 13,000 ebooks, and videos.[103]

The Office of Sponsored Programs and Research works with faculty members 
to apply for funding to support research programs. Each year, NYIT receives 
well over $20 million in research support from external sources. To date, 
NYIT has received funding from public, private, and government agencies, 
including among others: In 1968, Federal government awarded $3 million 
in grants to NYIT for computer research.[28] Researchers at the New York 
Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab created the tools that made 
entirely 3D CGI films possible.[14] Among NYIT CG Lab's innovations was 
an eight-bit paint system to ease computer animation.[152] NYIT CG Lab 
was regarded as the top computer animation research and development group 
in the world during the late 70s and early 80s.[25][26] In 1978, the digital 
noise reducer invented by William E. Glenn, earned NYIT its first television 
Emmy award. Glenn directed NYIT's former Science and Technology Research 
Center in Florida, where he also developed his invention. The digital noise 
reducer received a patent in 3-D technology in 1979.[76] In 1995, the School 
of Engineering took first place in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Clean 
Air Road Rally. The student engineering team spent three years designing 
and building the high-performance hybrid electric car that beat out 43 
other vehicles.[27] In 2007, NYIT received $500,000 in federal funding 
to develop a "green print" initiative to research alternative fuel technology 
and determine its carbon footprint. In 2008, NYIT received a grant from 
the U.S. Department of Energy to study the relationship between electric 
vehicles and renewable energy charging stations. For $250,000, NYIT was 
able to install two solar carports (one at its Old Westbury campus and 
one at its Central Islip campus), convert two Toyota Priuses to plug-ins 
with extra battery capacity, and install data collection technology.[153] 
Each carport spans 4 parking spots, provides level 1 charging (110 volt) 
at each parking spot, and supports a 10 kW solar array.[154] Congressman 
Steve Israel helped to secure the federal grant and spoke at the ribbon 
cutting ceremony for the Central Islip carport. According to the relevant 
official press release, he said: [155] NYIT's research on electric vehicles, 
solar energy, and their resulting environmental and grid impacts continues 
in partnership with the Long Island Power Authority and the Electric Power 
Research Institute.[156] The study currently has NYIT Students participate 
in car-share program where they are able to drive the plug-in Priuses between 
their homes and the school campus. The school plans to expand participation 
to faculty members as well.[157] Also in 2008, NYIT was awarded a $130,000 
research contract by United Space Alliance to help NASA scientists design 
the crew module of the Orion spacecraft using 3-D motion capture technology. 
In 2009, U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration awarded a $1 
million grant to NYIT.[28] In 2010, NYIT and the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space 
Museum announced a new partnership to incorporate project-based learning

Development Corporation has provided seed funding for the initiative, which 
is supported by the Long Island Regional Economic Development Council. 
An Advisory Board made up of members of industry, government, and the venture 
capital community, has agreed to help NYIT create the Center and work on 
its three focus areas create a high-tech teaching and research environment.[172] 
NYIT has few formal traditions, compared to many other universities, but 
has a rich culture of informal traditions and jargon. There are a few "big 
events" such as Commencement (graduation), but many smaller, decentralized 
activities sponsored by departments, labs, living groups, student activities, 
and ad hoc groups of NYIT community members united by common interests.[173] 
The Office of Residence Life and Off-Campus Housing at New York Institute 
of Technology creates a positive living-learning experience for students 
living in residence halls and independently in housing off-campus.[174] 
NYIT’s Student Government Association (SGA) is the official voice of the 
student body. The SGA advocates on behalf of student interests—academic, 
cultural, and social. It is charged with working with the college’s faculty 
and administration to improve campus life. In addition, the SGA oversees 
the budgeting process for student clubs and organizations and supports 
a variety of campus-wide events.[175][176] LI News Tonight is a nightly 
television newscast produced on the Old Westbury campus as both a community 
service to Nassau and Suffolk counties and an internship opportunity where 
students can learn about careers in television news. For more than 25 years, 
college interns have covered breaking news and feature events alongside 
reporters and photographers from professional news stations, with their 
work appearing that evening on a nightly TV newscast aired on a Long Island 
cable station. Globesville is NYIT’s student-run web channel. It is an 
online network of students that uses the power of social media to integrate
