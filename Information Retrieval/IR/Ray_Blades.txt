As Player As Manager As Coach Francis Raymond Blades (August 6, 1896 – 
May 18, 1979) was an American left fielder, manager, coach and scout in 
Major League Baseball. A native of McLeansboro, Illinois, Blades was first 
scouted as a baseball player as a teenager in 1913. Branch Rickey, then 
the manager of the St. Louis Browns, spotted Blades during a sandlot game 
for the St. Louis city championship. Seven years would pass, however, before 
Rickey would sign Blades to a contract; by that time, 1920, however, Rickey 
was working for the Browns’ National League rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Blades threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) tall 
and weighed 163 pounds (74 kg). After apprenticing in the minor leagues, 
Blades reached the Cardinals in 1922. Hampered by a severe knee injury, 
he appeared in over 100 games only three times – from 1924 to 1926 – but 
he hung on as a spare outfielder for ten major league seasons (1922–28; 
1930–32), all with the Cardinals, and batted .301 lifetime. In his finest 
season, 1925, he hit .342 in 462 at-bats. He appeared in three World Series 
(1928, 1930 and 1931). Beginning a transition to a management career, he 
was a playing coach for the Cardinals from 1930–32. Blades was known as 
a ferocious competitor with a terrible temper, and he carried that reputation 
with him as a manager in the Cardinals’ farm system. He managed at the 
top level of the St. Louis organization with the Rochester Red Wings and 
Columbus Red Birds from 1933–38 and was named skipper of the Cardinals 
in 1939. Upon his appointment, he prohibited alcohol drinking among his 
players. In his first season, the Cards responded to Blades’ tough regimen, 
winning 92 games and improving from sixth to second place in the National 
League. But the Cardinals slumped in the early weeks of 1940, winning only 
14 of their first 38 games and plunging back into sixth place. On June 
7, Blades was fired and ultimately replaced by Billy Southworth. He then 
coached in the National League for the Cincinnati Reds (1942), Brooklyn 
Dodgers (1947–48) and Chicago Cubs (1953–56), in addition to a one-year 
return to the Cardinals (1951). He managed again in minor league baseball, 
spending two non-consecutive years (1941; 1943) as skipper of the New Orleans 
Pelicans and three seasons (1944–46) at the helm of the St. Paul Saints, 
which then was one of the Dodgers' two top-level farm teams. He also worked 
in Brooklyn's farm system as a managerial consultant (1949–50) and scouted 
for the Cubs from 1957 into the early 1960s. After 1940, Blades never managed 
again full-time in the big leagues, although during his tenure with Brooklyn 
he and a fellow coach, Clyde Sukeforth, famously turned down the job as 
acting manager of the 1947 Dodgers after the suspension of Leo Durocher 
for the season. Rickey, by then president of the Dodgers, ultimately turned 
to Burt Shotton, one of the team's scouts, and under Shotton Brooklyn won 
the 1947 NL pennant. During the following year, 1948, Blades served as 
interim Dodger pilot for a single game in July, when Durocher left Brooklyn 
for the New York Giants job, and Shotton succeeded him a second time. Blades’ 
final record as a manager was 107–85 (.557). Ray Blades died in Lincoln,
