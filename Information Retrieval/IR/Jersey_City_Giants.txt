The Jersey City Giants was the name of a high-level American minor league 
baseball franchise that played in Jersey City, New Jersey, as the top farm 
system affiliate of the New York Giants from 1937 through 1950. The Jersey 
City club played in the International League (Class AA 1912–1945 and Class 
AAA since 1946). They were commonly referred to as the Little Giants. Jersey 
City hosted numerous minor league teams before and since the Giants, including 
1½ seasons (from July 13, 1960 through the end of 1961) as the home of 
the relocated Havana Sugar Kings International League franchise; that club, 
a Cincinnati Reds affiliate, was nicknamed the Jersey City Jerseys and 
included many Cuban players who had taken the field in Havana. The city's 
earliest IL team, which played from 1912–1933 (except for a four-year hiatus 
during the Federal League period and the outbreak of World War I), was 
called the Skeeters. But the Jersey Giants were a notable team because 
they sent a number of star players (including Sal Maglie, Whitey Lockman 
and Monte Irvin) across the river to their Major-League namesake. In addition, 
the baseball color line was broken in Jersey City's Roosevelt Stadium when 
Jackie Robinson of the Montreal Royals made his organized baseball debut 
there as a visitor on April 18, 1946. Robinson made a spectacular playing 
debut with four hits in five at-bats, including a home run in a game that 
ended with a 14-1 win for the Royals. A decade later, in 1956–1957, Roosevelt 
Stadium would host select Dodger home games as owner Walter O'Malley parried 
with public officials over a new stadium in Brooklyn. The Dodgers (and 
the MLB Giants) ultimately abandoned New York for California in 1958. Although 
they won league titles in 1939 and 1947, the Jersey Giants usually struggled 
to reach .500. And, like their neighbors, the Newark Bears, they found 
it impossible to compete when the three New York MLB teams began mass radio 
and television broadcasts of their games. Jersey City's attendance plunged 
from 337,000 in 1947 to 63,000 in 1950. The franchise moved to Ottawa, 
Ontario, in 1951 and became the Ottawa Giants. Today, the team is known
