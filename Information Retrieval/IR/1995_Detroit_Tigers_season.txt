The 1995 Detroit Tigers finished in fourth place in the American League 
Eastern Division with a record of 60–84 (.417). This was manager Sparky 
Anderson's final year. The pitching continued to be a liability; they were 
outscored by their opponents 844–654. Only the Minnesota Twins allowed 
more runs in the American League. Despite their inconsistencies, the Tigers 
found themselves just three games out of first place after beating Kansas 
City, 4–2 on July 9. However, when play resumed after the All-Star break, 
the Tigers went into perpetual free-fall, winning 23 of 74 games. The Tigers 
drew 1,180,979 fans to Tiger Stadium in 1995, ranking 11th of the 14 teams 
in the American League. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
