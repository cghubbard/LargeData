The Cincinnati Reds' 1981 season consisted of the Reds finishing with an 
overall record of 66-42 the National League West, putting them in first 
place. However, due to a split-season format, caused by a mid-season players' 
strike, they failed to make the MLB Playoffs that year. The Reds finished 
the first half of the season in second place with a record of 35-21, just 
one-half game behind the eventual World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers, and 
one-and-a-half games behind the Houston Astros in the second half, in which 
the Reds were 31-21, good for second place, again. The Reds were managed 
by John McNamara and played their home games at Riverfront Stadium. Infielders
