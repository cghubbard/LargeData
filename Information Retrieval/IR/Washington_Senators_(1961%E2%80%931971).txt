The Texas Rangers are an American professional baseball team based in Arlington, 
Texas, located in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The Rangers franchise 
is currently a member of the West division of the American League (AL) 
in Major League Baseball (MLB). Since 1994, the Rangers have played in 
Globe Life Park in Arlington in Arlington, Texas. The team's name is borrowed 
from the famous law enforcement agency of the same name. The franchise 
was established in 1961 as the Washington Senators, an expansion team awarded 
to Washington, D.C., after the city's first American League ballclub, the 
original Washington Senators, moved to Minnesota and became the Twins. 
After the 1971 season, the new Senators moved to Arlington, Texas, and 
debuted as the Rangers the following spring. The Texas Rangers Baseball 
Club has made seven appearances in the MLB postseason, six following division 
championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, and 2015 and as a wild card 
team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for 
the first time, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. Texas then brought home their 
first American League pennant after beating the New York Yankees in six 
games. In the 2010 World Series, the franchise's first, the Rangers fell 
to the San Francisco Giants in five games. They repeated as American League 
champions the following year, then lost the 2011 World Series to the St. 
Louis Cardinals in seven games. When the original Washington Senators moved 
to Minnesota in 1960 as the Twins, Major League Baseball decided to expand 
a year earlier than planned to stave off the twin threats of competition 
from the proposed Continental League and loss of its exemption from the 
Sherman Antitrust Act. At the winter meetings that year, it awarded a new 
team to Los Angeles (the Angels, now the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim) 
as well as a new team in the nation's capital. This new team adopted the 
old Senators name, but was (and still is) considered an expansion team 
since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators 
and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in 
an expansion draft. The team played the 1961 season at old Griffith Stadium 
before moving to District of Columbia Stadium (now the Robert F. Kennedy 
Memorial Stadium). For most of their existence, the new Senators were the 
definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's 
struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators--"Washington: 
first in war, first in peace and still last in the American League." Frank 
Howard, known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished 
player, winning two home run titles. Ownership changed hands several times 
during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor 
decision-making and planning. Owner Elwood Richard Quesada once wondered 
why he should have to pay his players because he believed they didn't belong 
in the majors. He later agreed to a 10-year lease at D.C. Stadium — a move 
that would come back to haunt the Senators. In 1963, Quesada sold his stake 
in the club and resigned. Washington stockbrokers James Johnston and James 
Lemon owned the team briefly, suffering massive financial losses. Johnson 
died in 1967 and Lemon sold the team a year later to hotel and trucking 
executive Bob Short, who outbid a group headed by Bob Hope. Short named 
himself general manager and hired Hall of Famer Ted Williams as manager. 
Although Williams had never coached or managed at any level of baseball, 
he seemed to light a spark under the once-moribund Senators. Williams kept 
them in contention for most of the season; their 86–76 record would be 
their only winning season in Washington. The success though was brief, 
as Short borrowed most of the $9.4 million he had used to pay for the team. 
As the Senators general manager, Short was forced to make many questionable 
trades to lower the debt and acquire amounts of the much-needed revenue. 
As a result, the team rapidly fell back into the American League's cellar 
position. Fans kept their distance from the Senators while the Baltimore 
Orioles, 45 miles (72 km) to the northeast, won four American League pennants 
and two World Series from the 1966 season through the 1971 season. By the 
end of the 1970 season, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was 
willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (in comparison, the New York 
Yankees were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not proceed to renew 
the stadium lease and would move the team elsewhere. When that season ended, 
Short dealt his best starting pitcher and the left side of his infield 
to the Detroit Tigers for erstwhile 30-game-winner Denny McLain, who had 
spent most of the 1970 campaign suspended because of gambling allegations. 
The deal—alleged by onetime Senators broadcaster Shelby Whitfield to have 
been made in order to secure the Tigers' vote in favor of the Senators' 
eventual move to Texas—turned Detroit back into contenders, while McLain 
was a monumental bust, losing an embarrassing league-worst of 22 games. 
Short was especially receptive to an offer brought up by Arlington, Texas 
mayor Tom Vandergriff, who had been trying to obtain a Major League sports 
team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, Charles 
O. Finley, the owner of the Kansas City Athletics, sought to relocate his 
baseball team to Dallas, Texas, but the idea was rebuffed and ultimately 
declined by the other A.L. team owners. Arlington's hole card was Turnpike 
Stadium, a 10,000-seat park which had been built in 1965 to house the AA 
Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs of the Texas League. However, it had been built 
to Major League specifications and also located in a natural bowl, meaning 
only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate 
Major League crowds. After Vandergriff offered a multimillion-dollar down 
payment, Short decided to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 
1971, by a vote of 10 to 2 (the Orioles' Jerold Hoffberger and John Allyn 
of the Chicago White Sox registered the dissenting votes), American League 
owners granted approval to move the franchise to Arlington, Texas for the 
1972 season.[4] Senators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the 
club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without 
paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance 
of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading "SHORT 
STINKS". With the Senators leading 7–5 and two outs in the top of the ninth 
inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. 
One man grabbed first base and ran off with it. With no security in sight 
and only three bases, umpire crew chief Jim Honochick forfeited the game 
to the New York Yankees.[5][6] It would be 33 years before major league 
baseball returned to the nation's capital, in the form of the National 
League's Washington Nationals, which had previously been known as the Montreal 
Expos. During the off-season, improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, 
which reopened as Arlington Stadium for the 1972 season. Meanwhile, ownership 
announced that the franchise would be renamed the Texas Rangers. The team 
played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1–0 loss at the California Angels. 
The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels 5–1 for the club's first 
victory. After the season Ted Williams retired as manager; he had made 
no secret of his displeasure with the franchise's new location. Whitey 
Herzog was named the new manager, but he was replaced before the end of 
the 1973 season by Billy Martin. In 1974, the Rangers began to come into 
their own as a team. Under the ownership of Brad Corbett, they finished 
the season second in the American League West with an 84–76 record, behind 
the eventual World Series champion Oakland Athletics. The 1974 Rangers 
are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 
100-loss seasons. Mike Hargrove was awarded A.L. Rookie of the Year, Billy 
Martin was named Manager of the Year, Jeff Burroughs won American League 
MVP, and Ferguson Jenkins was named the Comeback Player of the Year after 
winning 25 games, a club record to this day. However, after a 44–51 start 
in 1975, Martin was fired as the Rangers' manager and was replaced by Frank 
Lucchesi. After excellent seasons between 1977–79, the Rangers came very 
close to clinching a playoff spot in the first half of 1981. But when Texas 
lost its last game before the players' strike began, the Oakland A's won 
the A.L. West in the first half by a half-game. After 1981, the Rangers 
would not post a winning record for another five seasons. During this stretch, 
the Rangers made one of their most unpopular trades ever, sending multi-Gold 
Glove catcher and fan favorite Jim Sundberg to the Milwaukee Brewers for 
future Brewers' manager Ned Yost. The Rangers faced an attendance problem 
for a few years after moving their team to Texas, in part due to the team's 
inconsistent performance and in part due to the oppressive heat and humidity 
that can encompass the area in the summer. Until the Florida Marlins arrived 
in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the Majors, 
with temperatures frequently topping around 100° throughout the months 
of summer. In part because of this, the Rangers began playing most of even 
their weekend games between May and September at night—a tradition that 
continues to this day. They usually get a waiver from ESPN to play Sunday 
night games. Bobby Valentine became steward over an influx of splendid 
talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was 
a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for 
the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting 
of many stellar young rookies such as Rubén Sierra, Pete Incaviglia, Mitch 
Williams, Bobby Witt, and Edwin Correa, the Rangers finished the season 
2nd place with an 87–75 record, just five games behind the division champion 
California Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over 
the 1985 season, which resulted in yet another last-place finish in the 
West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher Nolan Ryan prior to the 1989 
season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th strikeout, 300th win, and sixth 
and seventh no-hitters with the Rangers. Coupled with powerful batters 
like Juan González, Rubén Sierra, Julio Franco, and Rafael Palmeiro and 
a pitching staff that also included Charlie Hough, Bobby Witt, Kevin Brown, 
and Kenny Rogers, fans held really high expectations for the Rangers' upcoming 
season. However, the team never posted a finish higher than second place 
and Valentine was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season. In April 
1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon Eddie Chiles, sold the team to an investment 
group headed by George W. Bush. After hearing that Chiles planned to sell 
the team, Bush headed a group of investors (including Frank L. Morsani 
and the Mack family) that bought the team for $89 million.[7] While his 
own equity in the team was a small one ($500,000), he was named Managing 
General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment 
to $600,000 the following year.[8] During his tenure, the Rangers and the 
City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a 
new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington 
residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 
1991 on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named Globe Life 
Park in Arlington). The city, through the Arlington Sports Facilities Development 
Authority, also controversially authorized the seizure of 13 acres (53,000 m2) 
of land through eminent domain for the Rangers future development. Landowners 
filed lawsuits over the acquisition and eventually won settlements of $22.2 
million which the Rangers failed to pay. Bush left his position with the 
Rangers when he was elected Governor of Texas in 1994. Although Bush no 
longer has any ownership stake in the Rangers, he remains a fan of the 
team to this day and regularly attends the team's home games.[9] In 1993, 
Kevin Kennedy took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for 
two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into 
mid-September. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the A.L. 
West prior to the players' strike. On July 28 Kenny Rogers pitched the 
12th perfect game in Major League history. The strike prematurely ended 
what could have been the Rangers' first division championship when commissioner 
Bud Selig canceled the remainder of the season and the playoffs. The year 
1995 saw the beginnings of promise for the Rangers. With a brand new ballpark 
that hosted its first All-Star Game that year, Johnny Oates was hired as 
the Rangers' manager. Oates and company promptly helped to bring home the 
1996 A.L. Western Division Championship, the first division championship 
in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise 
came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the New York Yankees, 3 games to 
1. Oates was named A.L. Manager of the Year and Juan González was named 
A.L. MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters with Iván Rodríguez, 
Will Clark, Mark McLemore, Dean Palmer, Rusty Greer, Juan González, and 
Mickey Tettleton but continued to struggle with pitching – a common stereotype 
of Rangers teams – despite having Rick Helling, and Aaron Sele on their 
roster. Oates led the team to consecutive A.L. West championships in 1998 
and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, 
losing all 6 in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team 
that won 3 World Championships in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams 
in the first round. The 1999 team would be the last playoff-bound team 
for over a decade, as the Rangers took a step backwards at the beginning 
of the new millennium. En route to a second straight last-place finish, 
Oates resigned his position 28 games into the 2001 season. The Rangers 
finished the decade going 1–9 in the postseason, without a single home 
win. In 1998, venture capital billionaire Tom Hicks bought the team for 
$250 million. Hicks also agreed to pay the $22.2 million awarded in settlements 
in relation to the 1991 eminent domain litigation concerning the Ballpark 
in Arlington.[10] Prior to the 2001 season, star free agent shortstop Alex 
Rodriguez was signed by the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in baseball 
history: a 10-year, $252 million contract. The move was controversial and 
is frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought that owner Tom Hicks 
was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources 
to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching 
talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone 
of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance 
was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle and manager Jerry Narron 
was fired following the 2002 season. He was replaced by seasoned manager 
Buck Showalter. The 2003 season signified the fourth straight last-place 
finish, and after a post-season fallout between Rodriguez and club management, 
the reigning A.L. MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to 
the New York Yankees for second baseman Alfonso Soriano and infielder prospect 
Joaquin Arias. Prior to the 2004 season, little hope was held out for the 
Rangers to improve on their losing ways. However, the Rangers battled with 
the Anaheim Angels and Oakland Athletics for first place in the A.L. West 
for much of the season. Mark Teixeira, Alfonso Soriano, Michael Young, 
and Hank Blalock became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, 
with Young, Blalock, and Soriano being named to the 2004 All-Star Game. 
Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2 for 3 with a three-run 
home run. Late in September, the Oakland A's visited Arlington for a 3-game 
series. After taking the first two games of the series, the Rangers trailed 
4–2, in the bottom of the ninth. A loss would have dropped them to four 
games behind the Athletics. A home run by Hank Blalock and a dramatic two-out, 
two-run double by David Dellucci (known amongst fans as the "Dellucci Double") 
gave the Rangers a 5–4 win, one of the most memorable in club history. 
It also allowed the Rangers to sweep the first-place Athletics and leave 
them just two games behind with 10 to play. Unfortunately, the Rangers 
ended up losing six of the final ten games and another turnaround season 
came up short. The club finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, 
a mere 3 games out of first place. In 2005 the Rangers again struggled 
to find consistency amid controversy and injuries, notwithstanding that 
the team swept an entire homestand for the first time in its history. Frank 
Francisco and Carlos Almanzar, two key members of the bullpen, were sidelined 
for Tommy John surgery. Kenny Rogers, the team's ace pitcher, received 
a 20-game suspension from commissioner Bud Selig for attacking a cameraman 
at Ameriquest Field prior to a game. Management later placed opening day 
starter Ryan Drese on waivers, where he was claimed by the Washington Nationals. 
After Drese's release and Rogers' suspension, the Rangers' performance 
on the mound faltered, and a disastrous 1–12 August road trip all but sealed 
the squad's fate. On October 4, 2005, the Rangers announced that John Hart 
would step down as general manager and that Jon Daniels was being promoted 
from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and 
one month, would become the youngest general manager in Major League history. 
Daniels and the Rangers front office were very active in the 2005–2006 
offseason. Alfonso Soriano, who had often been mentioned in trade speculation, 
was finally dealt to the Nationals for outfielders Brad Wilkerson and Terrmel 
Sledge. The Rangers then began making moves to acquire pitching talent. 
The Rangers gained enigmatic starter Vicente Padilla from the Philadelphia 
Phillies in exchange for Ricardo Rodríguez and acquired San Diego Padres 
pitchers Adam Eaton and Akinori Otsuka in exchange for Chris Young, Adrian 
Gonzalez, and Sledge. Finally, they signed free agent starter Kevin Millwood 
to a five-year contract worth $60 million. The Rangers 2006 season ended 
with a disappointing 80–82 record and a third-place finish in the West. 
Though the club showed strength in the early going, the team proved unable 
to keep pace with the surging Oakland Athletics in the second half and 
fell out of contention in September. To some extent the Rangers were the 
victims of bad luck, as their win-loss record was worse than their +51 
run differential for the season would normally indicate. However, the element 
that the club continued to lack was a solid pitching staff, whose combined 
ERA ranked 9th in the A.L. at the season's end. The Rangers were represented 
in the 2006 All-Star game by center fielder Gary Matthews, Jr. and shortstop 
Michael Young, who was named the MVP for his game-winning two-run triple 
in the ninth inning. Significant player moves in-season included a July 
28 deal acquiring outfielders Carlos Lee and Nelson Cruz from the Milwaukee 
Brewers in exchange for Kevin Mench, Francisco Cordero, and Laynce Nix. 
On October 4 after two attempts to replicate the success of the 2004 team, 
the Rangers dismissed Buck Showalter as manager with three years left on 
his contract. A month later, the team announced that Oakland Athletics 
third base coach Ron Washington had accepted their offer to manage the 
team.[11] A change at manager would be the first of several moves to strengthen 
the team in yet another busy off-season. Gary Matthews, Jr., Mark DeRosa, 
Carlos Lee, and Adam Eaton all signed with other clubs as free agents. 
Vicente Padilla accepted a three-year, $33 million offer with an option 
for a fourth year at $12 million.[12] The Rangers also signed 1B/OF Frank 
Catalanotto to a multi-year deal. The Rangers later added reliever Éric 
Gagné and veteran outfielders Kenny Lofton and Sammy Sosa on short-term 
deals. In a sign that GM Jon Daniels was looking for results in 2007, the 
Rangers' top pitching prospect John Danks was traded to the Chicago White 
Sox along with reliever Nick Masset for 23-year-old starter Brandon McCarthy.[13] 
The Danks trade caused quite a stir amongst fans, many of which had followed 
the minor league careers of the highly touted "DVD" trio of pitchers that 
included Danks, Edinson Vólquez, and Thomas Diamond. All three pitchers 
would eventually reach the majors, with varying degrees of success, while 
McCarthy's career became marred by injury. The Rangers previously negotiated 
a 30-year, $75 million stadium naming rights agreement with Ameriquest 
Mortgage Company in 2004, renaming the Ballpark "Ameriquest Field". Under 
the Ameriquest moniker, the Ballpark featured a replica of the Liberty 
Bell in the stands above the Diamond Club (representing Ameriquest's logo) 
that rang after home runs. In 2007, though, the Rangers announced the termination 
of the agreement with Ameriquest, and changed the name to Rangers Ballpark 
in Arlington. Club president Jeff Cogen cited that the team was more concerned 
about getting their name back on the ballpark than Ameriquest's public 
financial troubles. "It's all about the brand", Cogen said. The Rangers 
lost a reported $2.5 million per year from the lack of naming rights but 
regained advertising space given over to Ameriquest in the naming rights 
deal.[14] Regardless of Cogen's comments, Ameriquest dissolved within months 
after the naming rights were terminated, and the company ended most business 
operations in September 2007. The Rangers struggled offensively early in 
the season, despite playing in a notoriously hitter-friendly park. On June 
20, Sammy Sosa hit his 600th career home run against the Chicago Cubs at 
the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Hank Blalock, the starting 3rd baseman 
who had been enjoying a good season, was placed on the 60-day disabled 
list on the May 19 due to thoracic outlet syndrome, and Mark Teixeira followed 
him onto the disabled list on June 9 (for the first time in his career) 
with a strained left quadriceps muscle. With a record of 46–59 at the July 
31 trade deadline, the team traded Mark Teixeira and Ron Mahay to the Atlanta 
Braves in a deal that would eventually bring 5 prospects to the Rangers 
organization, including four of Atlanta's top prospects Jarrod Saltalamacchia, 
Elvis Andrus, Matt Harrison, and Neftalí Feliz. The team also traded closer 
Éric Gagné to the Boston Red Sox for left-hander Kason Gabbard and Minor 
League outfielders David Murphy and Engel Beltre. These moves were the 
beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on 
the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, 
more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the 
farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and 
the Far East. The objective of Daniels' plan was to field a legitimately 
competitive team by the 2010 season. The 2007 season remains notable in 
the minds of baseball fans for two inexplicable oddities. On August 19 
at the Metrodome, the Minnesota Twins logged 19 strikeouts against the 
Rangers, one short of the Major League record. Three days later, the 22nd, 
in the first game of a doubleheader at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the 
Rangers' bats came alive with a modern record for runs by one team, defeating 
the Baltimore Orioles 30–3. Their 27-run margin of victory is also a modern-day 
MLB record. Wes Littleton gained probably the easiest save in Major League 
history: entering the game in the bottom of the seventh, with his team 
already ahead 14–3, he pitched three innings to finish the game, and gave 
up just two hits and a walk. The Rangers began the 2008 season red hot, 
headlined by newcomer Josh Hamilton who looked to be a threat to win the 
Triple Crown, before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star 
festivities at Yankee Stadium, Hamilton crushed a first round home run 
record in the 2008 Home Run Derby with 28. Hamilton hit another four in 
the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home 
runs, but lost to the Twins' Justin Morneau. Four Rangers played in the 
All Star Game: Josh Hamilton, Ian Kinsler, Milton Bradley, and Michael 
Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning 
run via a sac fly. The Rangers would finish the season with yet another 
sub-.500 record (79–83), yet ended the season second in the West, the club's 
best finish since 1999. The off-season saw perennial All-Star shortstop 
Michael Young ask for a trade when the team told him he would be moving 
to third base to make room for rookie Elvis Andrus.[15] After speaking 
with club president Nolan Ryan and his agent, Young later rescinded his 
trade request, and agreed to move to third base.[16] The offseason also 
saw the departure of mercurial outfielder/DH Milton Bradley to free agency. 
The 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first 
time since 2004. Despite injuries to Josh Hamilton and Ian Kinsler, the 
Rangers held first place in their division for long stretches of the summer 
before fading after September 1, losing the division to the Los Angeles 
Angels. The Rangers finished the season at 87–75, their first winning season 
since 2004 and good enough for second place in the A.L. West. Michael Young 
responded to his move to third base by posting one his best offensive seasons 
ever while committing just nine errors and earning a sixth straight All-Star 
appearance.[17] Josh Hamilton and Nelson Cruz were also named 2009 A.L. 
All-Stars. Several young stars with the club broke out including the debuts 
of highly rated rookies Elvis Andrus, Derek Holland, and Neftalí Feliz. 
Second baseman Ian Kinsler hit for the cycle in April, while having a 30–30 
season in home runs and stolen bases. Starting pitcher Scott Feldman posted 
a fantastic season as well in 2009, finishing 3rd in the A.L in wins with 
17. While the 2009 season was strong on the field, club owner Tom Hicks 
became the focus of several reports indicating serious financial problems 
with his holding group, Hicks Sports Group, which also owned the Dallas 
Stars, the Frisco Roughriders (the Rangers AA-farm club), 1/2 of Liverpool 
F.C. (sold in mid-October 2010 to New England Sports Ventures, owners of 
the Boston Red Sox), and the Mesquite Championship Rodeo (later sold by 
HSG). HSG was reported to have gone into default on a $525 million loan.[18] 
In April 2009, Hicks announced he would be willing to sell a minority interest 
in the team. Only one month later, Hicks announced he would be willing 
to sell majority control of the Rangers.[19] In July 2009, it was reported 
that Hicks borrowed money from Major League Baseball to meet the team's 
payroll.[20] After the 2009 season, Hicks began scouting prospective buyers 
and in December entered into exclusive negotiating rights for sale of the 
Rangers with a consortium headed by Pittsburgh sports lawyer Chuck Greenberg 
and Rangers team president Nolan Ryan. On January 22, 2010, Hicks Sports 
Group officially reached a formal agreement to sell the Texas Rangers to 
the group headed by Greenberg and Ryan (later called Rangers Baseball Express) 
for approximately $570 million.[21] Under the provisions of the deal, former 
owner Hicks stayed on as a limited minority partner, but was not allowed 
to retain a seat on the board of governors. Co-lead investors Dallas businessmen 
Ray Davis and Bob R. Simpson were named co-chairmen.[21] Hicks also sold 
much of the land surrounding Rangers Ballpark to Rangers Baseball Express 
in a separate deal. The deal was subject to approval by the other MLB owners 
(a 3/4 vote is required) and completed by April 1. However, one of HSG's 
principal lenders (Monarch Alternative Capital) opposed the sale on grounds 
that the proceeds would not fully repay the defaulted HSG notes.[22] On 
April 21, Major League Baseball issued a statement declaring the Rangers' 
sale to be under the control of the Commissioner to expedite the process.[23][24] 
Because of public comments made by Hicks deemed detrimental to the process, 
MLB also stripped Hicks of any responsibility regarding the sale of the 
team.[25] On May 13, MLB threatened to seize control of the rest of the 
team's operations if a deal was not completed by the deadline set by the 
Commissioner.[26] As the stalemate between HSG and its creditors continued, 
on May 24, 2010 the Texas Rangers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[27][28] 
As of that date, the Rangers and HSG had an estimated debt of $575 million.[28] 
Much of the unsecured debt was owed in back salary. Officially, New York 
Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez topped the list of unsecured creditors 
with an estimated $24.9 million owed by the Rangers.[28] Additionally, 
the Rangers also owed Baltimore Orioles pitcher Kevin Millwood $12.9 million, 
and then current Rangers third baseman Michael Young $3.9 million.[28] 
At a press conference, the Greenberg-Ryan group proposed to buy the team 
for $575 million.[28] The sale would repay all the team's creditors, including 
players owed back salary.[28] After several attempts to resolve the deal 
fell through, the bankruptcy court ordered a public auction to be held 
on August 4. The Greenberg/Ryan bid would be the opening bid, and other 
offers (subject to MLB approval) would have to be submitted by the prior 
day in order to be considered. At the auction, only one other MLB-approved 
group submitted an offer – Radical Baseball LLC, a group formed by Houston 
businessman Jim Crane (who was previously unsuccessful in buying the Houston 
Astros, and ultimately bought that team in 2011) and Dallas Mavericks owner 
Mark Cuban (who was previously unsuccessful in buying the Chicago Cubs). 
The auction lasted until the early morning of August 5, with the winning 
bid submitted by Greenberg/Ryan. The bankruptcy court approved the bid 
later that morning and the bankruptcy case closed. The sale to the Greenberg/Ryan 
was approved by all 30 MLB owners at the owners meeting in Minneapolis 
on Thursday August 12. "I'll be the managing partner and CEO. If you like 
what's going on or you don't like what's going on, I take responsibility 
for that. When it comes to baseball, I'm not going to interject my opinions. 
If Nolan and [Jon Daniels] want to discuss something with me, they can, 
but I have complete faith and trust in the decisions that they make. I'll 
be as involved as they wish me to be, but with complete faith and confidence 
in them. What I'm going to focus on, particularly since the baseball side 
is in great shape, is the business side. How do we connect with the community? 
How do we create a higher tempo of energy in the front office? How can 
we do a better job of filling the stands and make an impact on people's 
lives? If we succeed on the business side and continue on path on the baseball 
side and combine it with a dynamic market like this is, we can be and should 
be one of the powerhouse franchises in baseball.[29] " The new ownership 
group, which included Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan, was called Rangers 
Baseball Express, LLC and had Greenberg serving as managing general partner 
and Ryan as club president.[30] Davis and Simpson were named co-chairmen.[31] 
In March 2011 Greenberg resigned as Chief Executive and Managing General 
Partner and sold his interest in the Club following a "falling out" with 
his partners.[32] Following Greenberg's resignation, Nolan Ryan was named 
Chief Executive Officer in addition to his continuing role as Team President.[31] 
Ryan was subsequently designated the Controlling Owner of the Club by a 
unanimous vote of the 30 owners of Major League Baseball on May 12, 2011.[32] 
Co-Chairmen Simpson and Davis stated they would not be involved in day-to-day 
operations.[33] Offseason moves made by the Rangers sent Kevin Millwood 
to the Baltimore Orioles and acquired free agents Rich Harden, Colby Lewis, 
and Vladimir Guerrero. With the new influx of talent and success in 2009, 
the Rangers entered the season expecting to compete for the division and 
achieve the front office's goals of 2007. During the offseason, Texas Rangers' 
team President Nolan Ryan spoke about the Rangers' chances in the upcoming 
season saying, "My expectations today are that we're going to be extremely 
competitive and if we don't win our division, I'll be disappointed."[34] 
After stumbling out of the gates with a sub-.500 start in April, the Rangers 
took the division lead with a franchise-best month of June, going 21–6. 
The Rangers would never relinquish first place after an 11-game winning 
streak. On July 9, the club dealt one of its top prospects, Justin Smoak, 
with two other minor leaguers to the Seattle Mariners for former Cy Young 
Award winner Cliff Lee and Mark Lowe. The Rangers also made moves to acquire 
veterans Bengie Molina, Jorge Cantú, Cristian Guzmán, and Jeff Francoeur. 
In the 2010 All-Star Game, the team was represented by Lee, Guerrero, Ian 
Kinsler, Josh Hamilton, Elvis Andrus, and Neftalí Feliz. After the All-Star 
Game, came the debut of the claw and antler hand gestures, which gained 
much popularity, especially after the release of various apparel and souvenir 
options for the fans. Foam claws and helmets with deer antlers became quite 
commonplace in the ballpark as the Rangers played further into the fall. 
The Rangers won the A.L. West on September 25, advancing to the postseason 
for the first time since 1999.[35] After winning the AL West with a 90–72 
record, the Rangers entered the playoffs for the first time since 1999, 
and faced the Tampa Bay Rays for the first round, which ultimately resulted 
in a 3–2 series victory and marked the first postseason series victory 
in the 50-year history of the Rangers/Washington Senators franchise. Facing 
the Rangers in the American League Championship Series were the defending 
World Champion New York Yankees, the team the Rangers failed against three 
separate times in the 1990s. In the playoffs, the Rangers record against 
the Yankees was 1–9. In a 6-game series, the Texas Rangers came out victorious, 
winning the first pennant in franchise history in front of an ecstatic 
home crowd.[36] Josh Hamilton was awarded ALCS MVP after setting a series 
record for intentional walks. The Texas Rangers faced the San Francisco 
Giants in the 2010 World Series. The Rangers offense struggled against 
the Giants' young pitching and eventually lost the Series 4–1, the lone 
win coming in Arlington on October 30. For the first time, the Rangers 
ended their season in the month of November. The Rangers successfully defended 
their AL West Division title in 2011, making the club's second straight 
division title and postseason appearance and fifth division title and postseason 
appearance overall. The Rangers set records for best record (96–66 with 
a .592 winning percentage) and home attendance (2,946,949). On October 
15, they went back to the World Series after beating the Detroit Tigers 
15–5 in Game 6 of the ALCS.[37] The series featured Nelson Cruz hitting 
6 home runs, the most home runs by one player in a playoff series in MLB 
history. In game 2 Cruz also became the first player in postseason history 
to win a game with a walk-off grand slam as the Rangers defeated the Tigers 
7–3 in 11 innings. However, they would proceed to lose the World Series 
to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games, after twice being one strike 
away from the championship in game 6. Game 7 is notable for the controversy 
surrounding the manager Ron Washington's pre-game clubhouse speech.[38] 
The Rangers lost C. J. Wilson to the rival Angels in the offseason, but 
managed to gain the services of Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish. They also 
added Joe Nathan to fill the closer role vacated by Neftalí Feliz, who 
was shifted to full-time starter. The Rangers dominated the American League 
standings for much of the season, despite losing Feliz and Colby Lewis 
to the 60-day DL. Darvish quickly flourished in the starting rotation, 
finishing with a 16–9 record and a 3.90 ERA. Josh Hamilton also had a spectacular 
season, finishing with 43 home runs, four of which came in a single game 
against the Baltimore Orioles on May 8. However the Rangers floundered 
in September, culminating in a sweep by the Oakland Athletics in the final 
series. Before the last series of the regular season, the Rangers faced 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on September 29, 2012. The game was postponed 
due to a rain delay and the game was held off until the next day. The Texas 
Rangers then lost to the Angels 5–4 for the first game and won 8–7 in the 
second game later that night, which guaranteed them a spot in the first 
ever American League wild-card playoff game. As a result of their 93–69 
record, finishing second in the AL West behind the Oakland A's, the Texas 
Rangers settled for the Wild Card playoff slot. In the new Wild Card Game, 
the Rangers' woes continued, as they lost 5–1 to the Orioles. The Rangers 
finished the season in second place in the American League West with a 
91-72 record, 5 1/2 games behind the Oakland Athletics. On September 30, 
2013, the Rangers faced the Tampa Bay Rays in a 163rd play-in 2013 American 
League Wild Card tie-breaker game, to determine the second participant 
in the 2013 American League Wild Card Game against the Cleveland Indians. 
The 163rd game was determined to be an extension of the regular season 
and not considered to be part of the 2013 Major League Baseball Postseason. 
The Rangers lost to the Rays 5-2 in the tie-breaker and were eliminated 
from playoff contention for the first time since 2009. On October 17, 2013, 
Nolan Ryan announced that he was stepping down as Rangers CEO effective 
October 31, 2013.[39] Injuries took a major toll on the Rangers in 2014.[40][41] 
The lone bright spot was Adrián Beltré, who despite spending some time 
injured, was the most consistent offensive player on the team.[42][43] 
On September 4, 2014, the Rangers became the first MLB team officially 
eliminated from 2014 postseason contention when a 10–2 loss at home to 
the Seattle Mariners dropped their record to 53–87.[44][45] The following 
day, manager Ron Washington resigned, citing personal issues.[46] The 2015 
season started off on a bad note with the Ranger's Ace pitcher Yu Darvish 
having to undergo Tommy John surgery due to a torn UCL before the season 
began. According to most experts, the Rangers were not expected to place 
any better than fourth or fifth in the American League West. However, even 
though the Rangers started the season with an 8-16 record, they were able 
to surpass the .500 mark on a few different occasions throughout the year. 
Surprisingly, in 2015 the Rangers were one of the best road teams in all 
of baseball with a road record of 45-36. Only the Chicago Cubs had a better 
road record with 48-33. With the acquisition of Cole Hamels, the Rangers 
would retain a winning record after August 3. The Rangers would overtake 
the Houston Astros and clinch the American League West title on the final 
day of the season with a record of 88-74. It was the Rangers' 6th division 
title and 7th postseason appearance in franchise history. Hamels' positive 
effect on the Rangers was compared to that of the Toronto Blue Jays' David 
Price, another ace starting pitcher who helped spearhead a run to the postseason 
after blending in seamlessly with a struggling team who acquired him at 
the trade deadline.[1] The Rangers lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in five 
games in the Division Series after squandering a 2-0 series lead. Through 
the 2016 season, the Rangers have won 4,277 games and lost 4,649 over their 
history, equating to a .479 lifetime winning percentage. After the 2011 
World Series and the 2012 season, the team is 19–25 in individual playoff 
games, and 4–6 overall for postseason series. Nellie Fox Ted Williams Bert

Rangers Captain is the mascot for the Texas Rangers. Introduced in 2002, 
he is a palomino-style horse, dressed in the team's uniform. He wears the 
uniform number "72" in honor of 1972, the year the Rangers relocated to 
Arlington. The mascot also has multiple uniforms to match each of the variants 
the team has. Rangers Captain's chosen uniform for the game matches the 
uniform choice made by the team for that particular game. Captain's outfits 
sometimes match a theme the team is promoting; on Apr 24, 2010, he was 
dressed up like Elvis as part of an Elvis Presley themed night. The Texas 
Rangers Hall of Fame was created in 2003 to honor the careers of former 
Texas Rangers players, managers, executives and broadcasters. There are 
currently 20 members. The Hall is located in Globe Life Park in Arlington, 
behind right field.[47] The Hall's two levels contain 13,000 square feet, 
a 235-seat theater, and various plaques, photos, and memorabilia. It can 
accommodate up to 600 people.[48] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders

Eric Nadel is the primary play-by-play announcer. He has called games for 
the club since 1979 beginning on television broadcasts, then moving exclusively 
to radio beginning in 1985. He became the primary announcer after the late 
Mark Holtz moved to television. Currently, Nadel provides play-by-play 
in the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th innings, and color commentary for 
the other innings. On December 11, 2013, he was awarded the 2014 Ford C. 
Frick Award by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum for excellence 
in broadcasting.[50] Matt Hicks now shares the broadcast booth with Nadel. 
He joined the broadcast in 2012 after Steve Busby moved from radio to television 
to replace Dave Barnett. Hicks provides play-by-play in the 3rd, 4th, and 
7th innings, and color commentary for the other innings. Jared Sandler 
hosts the pre-game and post-game shows, and also fills in whenever Nadel 
or Hicks have a day off. For the Spanish radio affiliates, Eleno Ornelas 
is the play-by-play announcer, and former Rangers pitcher José Guzmán is 
the color analyst. Former major leaguer Steve Busby is the primary television 
play-by-play announcer. Since 1982 on both TV and radio, Busby has had 
various stints in various positions on Rangers broadcasts from play-by-play 
to color commentary to pre-game and post-game analysis. In June 2012, Busby 
moved back to his current role after Dave Barnett left his position as 
game announcer following an episode in which he experienced speech difficulties. 
Beginning in 2016, Dave Raymond will substitute for Busby on select games. 
Tom Grieve is the primary color analyst. A former Rangers player and general 
manager, Grieve has been in the TV booth since 1995 following the end of 
his tenure as GM. Another former Ranger, Mark McLemore, substitutes for 
Grieve and has been doing so more often in recent seasons. McLemore often 
joins the booth for an inning during home games. He and former Ranger Iván 
Rodríguez are among the pre-game and post-game analysts used on Fox Sports 
Southwest (FSSW). FSSW pre-game and post-game shows are hosted by a rotation 
among Dana Larson, John Rhadigan, Ric Renner, and Erin Hartigan. In-game 
reporters include Jim Knox, Rhadigan, Hartigan, and Rangers employee Emily 
Jones (formerly of FSSW). Due to the Rangers having to play many of their 
Sunday home games at night, the team has been featured frequently on ESPN's 
Sunday Night Baseball during the summer months. Rangers games can also 
be seen on MLB on Fox and TBS. The Texas Rangers Six Shooters is an interactive 
dance squad for the Texas Rangers that perform various duties at Rangers 
home games.[citation needed] The women dance, tumble, and interact with
