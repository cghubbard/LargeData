Samuel Leever (December 23, 1871 – May 19, 1953), nicknamed "The Goshen 
Schoolmaster", was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. 
He spent his entire career with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in Goshen, 
Ohio, Leever came into baseball after an earlier career as a schoolteacher.[1] 
He won 25 games in 1903 to help the Pirates win their third consecutive 
National League pennant, but lost both his starts in the World Series as 
the heavily favored Pirates were upset by Boston. He later went 8–1 for 
the 1909 Pirates, when they won their first World Series title. His lifetime 
ERA was 2.47 with a 194–100 record, 847 strikeouts, 39 shutouts, 241 complete 
games, 587 walks, and only 29 home runs allowed in 2660.2 innings. Leever
