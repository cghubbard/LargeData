Stephen Wayne "Steve" Yeager (born November 24, 1948) is an American right-handed 
former professional baseball catcher. Yeager spent 14 of the 15 seasons 
of his Major League Baseball career, from 1972 through 1985, with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. His last year, 1986, he played for the Seattle Mariners. 
As of 2012, Yeager was the Los Angeles Dodgers' Major League catching coach. 
Yeager was born in Huntington, West Virginia.[1] He attended Meadowdale 
High School in Dayton, Ohio.[1] He is a cousin of the test pilot Chuck 
Yeager.[2] Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley was the best man at his wedding.[1] 
Yeager is Jewish, having converted to Judaism when his career was over.[3] 
Yeager hit two grand slams in a single game while playing for Meadowdale 
High School (Ohio) in Dayton, Ohio. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers 
on June 6, 1967, in the 4th round of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft. 
After one game with the rookie level Ogden Spikers of the Pioneer League, 
Yeager was sent to the Dodgers' Single-A affiliate, the Dubuque Packers 
of the Midwest League. The following season, in 1968, Yeager played 59 
games for the Single-A Daytona Beach Dodgers of the Florida State League. 
In 1969, he played 22 games for the Bakersfield Blaze, the Dodgers' Single-A 
affiliate in the California League, where he threw out 26 runners from 
behind the plate. Yeager was promoted to Double-A before the end of the 
1969 season, playing in 1 game for the Albuquerque Dodgers of the Texas 
League. He spent the next two-and-2/3 seasons with the Double-A franchise. 
In 162 games played over the 1970 and 1971 seasons, he hit .276, with 77 
RBIs in 490 at bats. He threw out 84 runners, second in the league that 
year, and was named to the Texas League All-Star team as a catcher in 1971. 
With the Dukes becoming the new Pacific Coast League Triple-A affiliate 
for the Dodgers in 1972, Yeager was promoted while remaining in Albuquerque 
for another season. With the Triple-A Dukes, he played 82 games, batting 
.280 with 45 RBIs in 257 at bats. Yeager made his Major League debut with 
the Dodgers on August 2, 1972. He started 34 games that season, backed 
up Joe Ferguson in 1973, and split time with Ferguson for the pennant-winning 
1974 club. Thereafter, Yeager was the starting catcher for the Dodgers 
and became an integral part of the Dodgers' success in the 1970s and early 
1980s. Yeager helped the Dodgers to the World Series in 1974, 1977, 1978, 
and 1981. In the '81 Series against the New York Yankees, he shared the 
World Series Most Valuable Player award with teammates Pedro Guerrero and 
Ron Cey. Yeager, who was backing up Mike Scioscia by that time, did not 
have overwhelming stats for the Series, as he went 4-for-14 (.286), but 
three of his hits were a double and two home runs. One of the homers, off 
Ron Guidry, turned out to be the game-winner in Game 5. Yeager injured 
his knee in 1982 and broke his wrist the next year, which severely limited 
his playing time. He was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Ed Vande Berg 
following the 1985 season and retired after hitting only .208 in 1986. 
While with the Dodgers, Yeager caught Jerry Reuss' no-hitter on June 27, 
1980.[4] Lou Brock called Yeager "the best-throwing catcher in the game." 
His specialty was defense and his command of the game on the field. In 
one nationally-televised game, he made a putout to second base – and the 
radar gun in place to record pitches caught his throw to second (from a 
crouch) at 98 mph. He was very good at managing the game from his position 
and was even more highly regarded for his abilities with young pitchers. 
In 1974, he had 806 putouts, the most in the National League. This compensated 
for his overall subpar offense, as illustrated by arguably his best offensive 
year occurring in 1974 when he batted .266 in fewer than 100 games. Despite 
this reputation, Yeager was still somewhat of a clutch hitter as he had 
an average of .321 when hitting with the bases loaded during his career, 
as well as hitting 4 home runs in 21 World Series games. He also had success 
hitting off pitcher Ken Forsch. While never hitting more than two home 
runs off any other pitcher, he managed to hit 5 against Forsch in his career. 
With the Dodgers, whenever knuckleballer Charlie Hough pitched, Yeager 
would use a special enlarged catcher's mitt and would hold it in a cupped 
style, palm facing upward, instead of the normal upright "target" position. 
In 1976, Yeager was injured when teammate Bill Russell's bat shattered 
and a large, jagged piece hit Yeager, who was in the on-deck circle. The 
wood hit him in the neck and pierced his esophagus, necessitating surgery. 
After the incident, Dodger trainer Bill Buhler invented and patented device 
hangs from the catcher's mask to protect the throat. It was soon worn by 
most catchers around the Majors and other leagues. In 1999, Yeager was 
the hitting coach for the Dodgers’ Single-A San Bernardino Stampede, which 
won the California League championship.He managed the Long Beach Breakers 
in the independent (now-defunct) Western Baseball League in 2001. The team 
won the league championship in their inaugural season that year, beating 
the Chico Heat 3 games to 2. He was the Jacksonville Suns hitting coach 
in 2004, when the team won the championship, and in 2005-06 he was the 
hitting instructor/coach for the Dodgers AAA farm club, the Las Vegas 51s. 
He later became the A Dodgers affiliate Inland Empire 66'ers and became 
the hitting coach in 2007. Yeager was instrumental in the conversion of 
Russell Martin from third base to behind the plate. In 2007, he became 
the manager for the Long Beach Armada of the independent Golden Baseball
