Charles Culbertson Robertson (January 31, 1896 – August 23, 1984) was an 
American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball 
as a pitcher. Robertson was born in Dexter, Texas,[1] grew up in Nocona, 
Texas, and graduated from Nocona High School in 1915. Charles attended 
Austin College[1] from 1917 until 1919. He began his career with the Chicago 
White Sox in 1919 at the age of 23. Robertson was an average player for 
most of his career, having a career record of 49–80[1] and never winning 
more than he lost during a single season. His main pitch throughout his 
career was a slow curveball which he often threw on the first pitch to 
a batter on any side of the plate, followed by a fastball up in the zone. 
On April 30, 1922, in just his fourth career start,[1] he pitched the fifth 
perfect game in baseball history against the Detroit Tigers at Navin Field 
(later known as Tiger Stadium) in Detroit. He became the first pitcher 
in major league history to throw a perfect game on the road. The Detroit 
lineup featured such Hall of Famers as Ty Cobb and Harry Heilmann, who 
both complained that he was doctoring the ball throughout the game.[1] 
A spectacular diving catch by Johnny Mostil on a liner to left by Bobby 
Veach in the second inning preserved the historic feat.[1] The Tigers submitted 
several game balls to American League President Ban Johnson after the game 
to check for irregularities,[1] but Johnson dismissed the charge. No pitcher 
would equal the feat after Robertson for another 34 years, until Don Larsen 
in the 1956 World Series; the next regular season perfect game would not 
come until Jim Bunning's perfect game in 1964.[1] After the victory, he 
suffered arm troubles for the rest of his career. He pitched one season 
for the St. Louis Browns and two years with the Boston Braves and retired 
in 1928.[1] He died in Fort Worth, Texas at age 88. Robertson was a contestant 
on What's My Line? on October 14, 1956. His occupation at the time of his 
television appearance was a buyer and seller of pecans. Italics denotes post-season perfect game
