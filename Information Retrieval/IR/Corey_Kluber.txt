on July 31, 2010, in the three-team trade between the Padres, Indians, 
and St. Louis Cardinals that sent Jake Westbrook to the Cardinals and Ryan

The Indians assigned Kluber to the Akron Aeros of the Class AA Eastern

in 2011, pitching to a 7–11 win–loss record and a 5.56 ERA.[4] He was called 
up to the Indians on September 1, 2011, and made his major league debut 
that day. Kluber was brought up from Columbus in August 2012 to replace 
starting pitcher Josh Tomlin in the Indians' rotation. Tomlin was moved 
to the bullpen.[9] Kluber began the 2013 season with Columbus, but received 
a promotion when Brett Myers suffered an elbow injury.[4] On June 16, 2013, 
Kluber threw eight shutout innings in a 2–0 victory over the Washington 
Nationals.[10] He won the American League Player of the Week Award for
