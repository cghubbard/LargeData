The 1962 New York Mets season was the first regular season for the Mets, 
as the National League returned to New York City for the first time since 
1957. They went 40–120 and finished tenth and last in the National League, 
60 1⁄2 games behind the NL Champion San Francisco Giants, who once called 
New York home. The Mets' 120 losses are the most by any MLB team in one 
season since 1899; since then, the 2003 Detroit Tigers have come the closest 
to matching this mark, at 43-119. The team lost its first game 11–4 to 
the St. Louis Cardinals on April 11, and went on to lose its first nine 
games. After a 12–19 record on May 20 after sweeping a doubleheader, the 
Mets lost their next 17 games. They also lost 11 straight from July 15 
to July 26, and 13 straight from August 9 to August 21. Their longest winning 
streak of the season was three.[1] The Mets were managed by Casey Stengel 
and played their home games at the Polo Grounds, which was their temporary 
home while Shea Stadium was being built in Queens. They are rather infamous 
for their futility, and were one of the worst teams in Major League Baseball 
history. The pitching staff allowed the most runs (948) in the majors. 
Despite the futility of the team, fans came out in droves. Their attendance 
of 922,530 was good enough for 6th in the National League that year. The 
season was chronicled in Jimmy Breslin's humorous best-selling book Can't 
Anybody Here Play This Game? The title came from a remark made by Manager 
Casey Stengel expressing his frustration over the team's ineptitude. The 
first game in franchise history was played on the road, at Busch Stadium, 
St. Louis, on Wednesday night, April 11, 1962. The Mets fell behind 5–0 
early, then narrowed the deficit to one run, but ultimately lost to the 
St. Louis Cardinals, 11–4. Former Brooklyn Dodgers Gil Hodges and Charlie 
Neal homered for the Mets, whose home opener at New York's Polo Grounds 
would wait until their second-ever official game, on Friday, April 13, 
1962. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At
