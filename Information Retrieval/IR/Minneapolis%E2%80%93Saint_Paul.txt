Minnesota Minneapolis–Saint Paul is a major metropolitan area built around 
the Mississippi, Minnesota and St. Croix rivers. The area is commonly known 
as the Twin Cities for its two largest cities, Minneapolis, the city with 
the largest population in Minnesota, and Saint Paul, the state capital. 
It is an example of twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity. 
Minnesotans often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro 
area collectively) as The Cities. There are several different definitions 
of the region. Many refer to the Twin Cities as the seven-county region 
which is governed under the Metropolitan Council regional governmental 
agency and planning organization. The United States Office of Management 
and Budget officially designates 16 counties as the Minneapolis-St. Paul–Bloomington 
MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area, the 16th largest in the United States. 
The entire region known as the Minneapolis-St. Paul MN-WI Combined Statistical 
Area, has a population of 3,866,768, the 14th largest, according to 2015 
Census estimates. Despite the Twin moniker, both cities are independent 
municipalities with defined borders and are quite distinct from each other. 
Minneapolis is somewhat younger with modern skyscrapers, while Saint Paul 
has been likened to a European city with quaint neighborhoods and a vast 
collection of well-preserved late-Victorian architecture.[1] Minneapolis 
was influenced by its early Scandinavian and Lutheran heritage and hosts 
the largest Somali population in North America. St. Paul was influenced 
by its early French, Irish and German Catholic roots and currently hosts 
a thriving Hmong population.[2] The Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area 
includes a total of 16 counties, of which 14 are located in Minnesota and 
two in Wisconsin. Note: Counties that are bolded are under jurisdiction 
of the Metropolitan Council. Numbers in parentheses are 2013 census estimates. 
Counties that are italicized were added to the metropolitan area when the 
Office of Management and Budget revised its delineations of metropolitan 
statistical areas in 2013.[3][4] There are approximately 218 incorporated 
municipalities located within the Twin Cities metropolitan region. This 
includes census-designated places along with villages in Wisconsin, but 
excludes unincorporated towns in Wisconsin, known as civil townships in 
other states. Estimates are as of 2013 for cities with 25,000 or more inhabitants. 
Places with over 100,000 inhabitants (2015 estimates) Places with 50,000 
to 99,999 inhabitants Places with 25,000 to 49,999 inhabitants Places with 
10,000 to 24,999 inhabitants Places with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants 
The Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN-WI Combined Statistical Area is made up of 
19 counties in Minnesota and two counties in Wisconsin. The statistical 
area includes two metropolitan areas and three micropolitan areas. As of 
the 2010 Census, the CSA had a population of 3,684,928 (though a July 1, 
2012 estimate placed the population at 3,691,918).[5] The CSA definition 
encompasses 11,132.44 sq mi (28,832.9 km2) of area. Minneapolis and St. 
Paul have competed since they were founded, resulting in some duplication 
of effort.[6] After St. Paul completed its elaborate Cathedral in 1915, 
Minneapolis quickly followed up with the equally ornate Basilica of St. 
Mary in 1926. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the rivalry became 
so intense that an architect practicing in one city was often refused business 
in the other. The 1890 United States Census even led to the two cities 
arresting and/or kidnapping each other's census takers, in an attempt to 
keep either city from outgrowing the other.[7][8][9] The rivalry could 
occasionally erupt into inter-city violence, as happened at a 1923 game 
between the Minneapolis Millers and the St. Paul Saints, both baseball 
teams of the American Association. In the 1950s, both cities competed for 
a major league baseball franchise (which resulted in two rival stadiums 
being built), and there was a brief period in the mid-1960s where the two 
cities could not agree on a common calendar for daylight saving time, resulting 
in a period of a few weeks where people in Minneapolis were one hour "behind" 
anyone living or traveling in St. Paul. The cities' mutual antagonism was 
largely healed by the end of the 1960s, aided by the simultaneous arrival 
in 1961 of the Minnesota Twins of the American League and the Minnesota 
Vikings of the National Football League, both of which identified themselves 
with the state as a whole (the former explicitly named for both Twin Cities) 
and not with either of the major cities (unlike the earlier Minneapolis 
Lakers). Since 1961, it has been common practice for any major sports team 
based in the Twin Cities to be named for Minnesota as a whole. In terms 
of development, the two cities remain distinct in their progress, with 
Minneapolis absorbing new and avant-garde architecture while St. Paul continues 
to carefully integrate new buildings into the context of classical and 
Victorian styles.[6] There are numerous lakes in the region, and cities 
in the area have some very extensive park systems for recreation. Organized 
recreation includes the Great River Energy bicycle festival, the Twin Cities 
Marathon, and the U.S. pond hockey championships. Some studies have shown 
that area residents take advantage of this, and are among the most physically 
fit in the country, though others have disputed that. Nonetheless, medicine 
is a major industry in the region and the southeasterly city of Rochester, 
as the University of Minnesota has joined other colleges and hospitals 
in doing significant research, and major medical device manufacturers started 
in the region (the most prominent is Medtronic). Technical innovators have 
brought important advances in computing, including the Cray line of supercomputers. 
It is common for residents of the Twin Cities area to own or share cabins 
and other properties along lakes and forested areas in the central and 
northern regions of the state, and weekend trips "up North" happen through 
the warmer months. Ice fishing is also a major pastime in the winter, although 
each year some overambitious fishermen find themselves in dangerous situations 
when they venture out onto the ice too early or too late. Hunting, snowmobiling, 
ATV riding and numerous other outdoor activities are also popular. This 
connectedness with the outdoors also brings a strong sense of environmentalism 
to many Minnesotans. In 2011 and 2012, the American College of Sports Medicine 
named Minneapolis–Saint Paul the healthiest metropolitan area in America.[10][11] 
Approximately 93.2% of the metropolitan area's population was native to 
the United States. Approximately 92.6% were born in the U.S. while 0.6% 
were born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, or born abroad to American 
parents. The rest of the population (6.8%) were foreign-born. The highest 
percentages of immigrants came from Asia (38.2%), Latin America (25.4%), 
and Africa (20.1%); smaller percentages of newcomers came from Europe (13.1%), 
other parts of North America (3.0%), and Oceania (0.2%).[citation needed] 
Minneapolis–Saint Paul is also a major center for religion in the state, 
especially Christianity. The state headquarters of the missionary efforts 
of four churches are found here: the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint 
Paul and Minneapolis, the Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota, the Presbyterian 
Synod of Lakes and Prairies, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints (LDS Church). The Presbyterian and LDS churches both have missions 
in Saint Paul, Minneapolis and Bloomington. The headquarters of the former 
American Lutheran Church (ALC), Evangelical Lutheran Church, Lutheran Free 
Church and the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church were located in Minneapolis; 
the headquarters of Augsburg Fortress publishing house still is. The Minneapolis 
Area Synod and the Saint Paul Area Synod are the first and third largest 
synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), respectively. 
The Evangelical Free Church of America has its headquarters in Bloomington, 
and the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations is headquartered in 
Plymouth, along with its seminary and a Bible School. The Twin Cities are 
home to several synagogues serving the Jewish population, which is concentrated 
in the western Minneapolis suburbs of Golden Valley, St. Louis Park, Plymouth 
and Minnetonka. There is also a Hindu temple located in the Twin Cities 
suburb of Maple Grove. A recent influx of immigrants from Laos and Northern 
Africa has brought many more religions to the area. There are several Islamic 
Masjids in the area. There is a temple for the religion of Eckankar in 
the suburb of Chanhassen known as the Temple of Eck. In addition, many 
Hmong and Tibetan Buddhist peoples live in Saint Paul; a Hmong Buddhist 
temple opened in suburban Roseville in 1995. The LDS St. Paul Minnesota 
Temple opened in Oakdale, a suburb east of Saint Paul, in 2000. There are 
several very strong Unitarian Universalist communities such as the First 
Unitarian Society of Minneapolis, as well as several Pagan and Buddhist 
groups. The cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis have been called Paganistan 
due to the large numbers of Pagans living there.[12] There are an estimated 
20,000 Pagans living in the Twin Cities area.[13] The Old Belief Society 
opened a temple in North East Minneapolis in 2010. Minneapolis is where 
the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association started and was home for more 
than fifty years. The following table shows the professional sports teams 
in the Minneapolis—Saint Paul MSA: The Twin Cities is one of thirteen American 
metropolitan areas to have teams in all four major sports — MLB, NFL, NBA 
and NHL. To avoid favoring either of the Twin Cities, most teams based 
in the area use only the word Minnesota in their name, rather than Minneapolis 
or St. Paul. In 1992, Minneapolis hosted Super Bowl XXVI. It was the farthest 
north that a Super Bowl has ever been played. The NFL picked Minneapolis 
to host Super Bowl LII in 2018. The Twin Cities host three nationally competing 
Roller Derby leagues: The Minnesota RollerGirls of the Women's Flat Track 
Derby Association Division 1, the North Star Roller Girls of WFTDA Division 
2, and Minnesota Men's Roller Derby, a league of the Men's Roller Derby 
Association. MNRG and NSRG possess four home teams each: the Dagger Dolls, 
Garda Belts, Rockits, and Atomic Bombshells of MNRG and the Banger Sisters, 
Delta Delta Di, Kilmore Girls and Violent Femmes of NSRG, as well as two 
traveling teams each. MMRD possesses three home teams: The Gentlemen's 
Club, Destruction Workers, and Thunderjacks, and two traveling teams. The 
annual Twin Cities Marathon is held in the fall with a course running through 
Minneapolis and St. Paul. Minneapolis was the birthplace of Rollerblade 
and is a center for inline skating, as well as home to the most golfers 
per capita of any city in the U.S.[14] Additionally, water skiing got its 
start on Lake Pepin,[15] a short distance southeast of the metropolitan 
area. Some other sports teams gained their names from being in Minnesota 
before relocating. The Los Angeles Lakers get their name from once being 
based in Minneapolis, the City of Lakes. The Dallas Stars also derived 
their present name from their tenure as a Minnesota team, the Minnesota 
North Stars. The Republican National Committee held their national nominating 
convention at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul in 2008. Prior, both cities 
had combined to submit bids to host both the 2008 Democratic National Convention 
and the 2008 Republican National Convention. They competed against Denver 
and New York to host the Democratic Convention, and against New York, Cleveland 
and Tampa to host the Republican Convention. Previously, Minneapolis was 
host to the 1892 Republican National Convention. The Minneapolis–Saint 
Paul area is home to 16 of Minnesota's 17 Fortune 500 headquarters - UnitedHealth 
Group, Target, Best Buy, Supervalu, CHS, 3M, US Bancorp, General Mills, 
Land O'Lakes, Xcel Energy, Ameriprise Financial, CH Robinson Worldwide, 
Mosaic, Thrivent Financial, Ecolab, and St. Jude Medical. Large private 
companies include Cargill, Carlson, Andersen, Holiday Stationstores. Foreign 
companies with U.S. headquarters in the Twin Cities include Aimia, Allianz, 
Canadian Pacific, Coloplast, Medtronic, Pearson VUE, Pentair and RBC. The 
area has the second largest economy in the Midwest, behind only Chicago.[16][17] 
The metro area continues to grow at a rapid pace. Currently, the Twin Cities 
is the second largest medical device manufacture center in North America.[18] 
In August 2013, Minneapolis–Saint Paul appeared on Forbes magazine's list 
of Best Places for Business and Careers.[19] CNBC ranked Minnesota as the 
top state for business in 2015. The first European settlement in the region 
was near what is now known as the town of Stillwater, Minnesota. The city 
is approximately 20 miles (30 km) from downtown Saint Paul and lies on 
the western bank of the St. Croix River, which forms the border of central 
Minnesota and Wisconsin. Another settlement that began fueling early interest 
in the area was the outpost at Fort Snelling, which was constructed from 
1820 to 1825 at the confluence of the Minnesota River and the Mississippi 
River. Fort Snelling held jurisdiction over the land south of Saint Anthony 
Falls, thus a town known as Saint Anthony grew just north of the river. 
For several years, the only European resident to live on the south bank 
of the river was Colonel John H. Stevens, who operated a ferry service 
across the river. As soon as the land area controlled by Fort Snelling 
was reduced, new settlers began flocking across to the new village of Minneapolis. 
The town grew quickly, and Minneapolis and Saint Anthony eventually merged. 
On the eastern side of the Mississippi, a few villages such as Pig's Eye 
and Lambert's Landing developed and would soon grow to become Saint Paul. 
Natural geography played a role in the settlement and development of the 
two cities. The Mississippi River Valley in this area is defined by a series 
of stone bluffs that line both sides of the river. Saint Paul grew up around 
Lambert's Landing, the last place to unload boats coming upriver at an 
easily accessible point, some seven miles (11 km) downstream from Saint 
Anthony Falls, the geographic feature that, due to the value of its immense 
water power for industry, defined the location of Minneapolis and its prominence 
as the Mill City. The falls can be seen today from the Mill City Museum, 
housed in the former Washburn "A" Mill, which was among the world's largest 
mills in its time. The oldest farms in the state are located in Washington 
County, the eastern most county on the Minnesota side of the metropolitan 
area. Joseph Haskell was Minnesota's first farmer, harvesting the first 
crops in the state in 1840 on what is now part of Afton Township on Trading 
Post Trail.[20] The Grand Excursion, a trip into the Upper Midwest sponsored 
by the Rock Island Railroad, brought more than a thousand curious travelers 
into the area by rail and steamboat in 1854. The next year, in 1855, Henry 
Wadsworth Longfellow published The Song of Hiawatha, an epic poem based 
on the Ojibwe legends of Hiawatha. A number of natural area landmarks were 
included in the story, such as Lake Minnetonka and Minnehaha Falls. Tourists 
inspired by the coverage of the Grand Excursion in eastern newspapers and 
those who read Longfellow's story flocked to the area in the following 
decades. At one time, the region also had numerous passenger rail services, 
including both interurban streetcar systems and interstate rail. Due to 
the width of the river at points further south, the Minneapolis–Saint Paul 
area was briefly one of the few places where the Mississippi could be crossed 
by railroad. A great amount of commercial rail traffic also ran through 
the area, often carrying grain to be processed at mills in Minneapolis 
or delivering other goods to Saint Paul to be transported along the Mississippi. 
Saint Paul had long been at the head of navigation on the river, prior 
to a new lock and dam facility being added upriver in Minneapolis. Passenger 
travel hit its peak in 1888 with nearly eight million traversing to and 
from the Saint Paul Union Depot. This amounted to approximately 150 trains 
daily. Before long, other rail crossings were built farther south and travel 
through the region began to decline. In an effort by the rail companies 
to combat the rise of the automobile, some of the earliest streamliners 
ran from Chicago to Minneapolis/Saint Paul and eventually served distant 
points in the Pacific Northwest. Today, the only vestige of this interstate 
service comes by Amtrak's Empire Builder train, running once daily in each 
direction. It is the railroad's busiest long-distance train and is named 
after James J. Hill, a railroad tycoon who settled on Summit Avenue in 
Saint Paul at what is now known as the James J. Hill House. Like many Northern 
cities that grew up with the Industrial Revolution, Minneapolis and St. 
Paul experienced shifts in their economic base as heavy industry declined, 
especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Along with the economic decline of the 
60s and 70s came population decline in the central city areas, white flight 
to suburbs,[21] and, in the summer of 1967, race riots on Minneapolis's 
North Side.[22] By the 1980s and 1990s, however, Minneapolis and St. Paul 
were frequently cited as former Rust Belt cities that had made successful 
transitions to service, high-technology, finance, and information economies.[23] 
Along with much of Minnesota, the Twin Cities area was shaped by water 
and ice over the course of millions of years. The land of the area sits 
on top of thick layers of sandstone and limestone laid down as seas encroached 
upon and receded from the region. Erosion caused natural caves to develop, 
which were expanded into mines when white settlers came to the area. In 
the time of Prohibition, at least one speakeasy was built into these hidden 
spaces—eventually refurbished as the Wabasha Street Caves in Saint Paul. 
Lakes across the area were formed and altered by the movement of glaciers. 
This left many bodies of water in the region, and unusual shapes may appear. 
For example, Lake Minnetonka out toward the western side of the Twin Cities 
consists of a complex arrangement of channels and large bays. Elevations 
in the metropolitan area range from 1,376 feet (419 m) above sea level 
in the northwest metro to 666 feet (203 m) at the edge of the Mississippi 
River in the southeast. Because it is comparatively easy to dig through 
limestone and there are many natural and man-made open spaces, it has often 
been proposed that the area should examine the idea of building subways 
for public transportation. In theory, it could be less expensive in the 
Twin Cities than in many other places, but the cost would still be much 
greater than surface projects. Owing to its northerly latitude and inland 
location, the Twin Cities experience the coldest climate of any major metropolitan 
area in the United States.[24] However, due to its southern location in 
the state and aided further by the urban heat island, the Twin Cities is 
one of the warmest locations in Minnesota.[25] The average annual temperature 
at the Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport is 45.4 °F (7.4 °C); 
3.5 °F (−15.8 °C) colder than Winona, Minnesota, and 8.8 °F (−12.9 °C) 
warmer than Roseau, Minnesota.[26] Monthly average daily high temperatures 
range from 21.9 °F (−5.6 °C) in January to 83.3 °F (28.5 °C) in July; the 
average daily minimum temperatures for the two months are 4.3 °F (−15.4 °C) 
and 63.0 °F (17.2 °C) respectively.[27] Minimum temperatures of 0 °F (−18 °C) 
or lower are seen on an average of 29.7 days per year, and 76.2 days do 
not have a maximum temperature exceeding the freezing point. Temperatures 
above 90 °F (32 °C) occur an average of 15 times per year. High temperatures 
above 100 °F (38 °C) have been common in recent years; the last occurring 
on July 6, 2012. The lowest temperature ever reported at the Minneapolis–St. 
Paul International Airport was −34 °F (−37 °C) on January 22, 1936; the 
highest, 108 °F (42 °C), was reported on July 14 of the same year.[28] 
Early settlement records at Fort Snelling show temperatures as low as −42 °F 
(−41 °C). Recent records include −40 °F (−40 °C) at Vadnais Lake on February 
2, 1996 (National Climatic Data Center) Precipitation averages 29.41 inches 
(74.7 cm) per year, and is most plentiful in June (4.34 inches (11.0 cm)) 
and February (0.79 inches (2.0 cm)) the least so. The greatest one-day 
rainfall amount was 9.15 inches (23.2 cm), reported on July 23, 1987. The 
city's record for lowest annual precipitation was set in 1910, when 11.54 
inches (29.3 cm) fell throughout the year; coincidentally, the opposite 
record was set the following year, which observed a total 40.15 inches 
(1,020 mm).[29] At an average of 56.3 inches (1,430 mm) per year, snowfall 
is generally abundant (though some recent years have proved an exception).[30] 
The Twin Cities area takes the brunt of many types of extreme weather, 
including high-speed straight-line winds, tornadoes, flash floods, drought, 
heat, bitter cold, and blizzards. The costliest weather disaster in Twin 
Cities history was a derecho event on May 15, 1998. Hail and Wind damage 
exceeded $950 million, much of it in the Twin Cities.[31] Other memorable 
Twin Cities weather-related events include the tornado outbreak on May 
6, 1965, the Armistice Day Blizzard on November 11, 1940, and the Halloween 
Blizzard of 1991. In 2014, Minnesota experienced temperatures below those 
in areas of Mars when a polar vortex dropped temperatures as low as −40 °F 
(−40 °C) in Brimson and Babbitt with a windchill as low as −63 °F (−53 °C) 
in Grand Marais.[32] A normal growing season in the metro extends from 
late April or early May through the month of October.[33] The USDA places 
the area in the 4a plant hardiness zone.[34] The four tallest buildings 
in the area are located in downtown Minneapolis. The first skyscraper built 
west of the Mississippi in 1929 was the Foshay Tower. Today there is some 
contention over exactly which building is the tallest—most Minnesotans 
would immediately think of the IDS Center if queried on the point, although 
most sources seem to agree that Capella Tower is slightly taller. But in 
early 2005, it was found that the IDS Center is taller by a 16-foot (5 m) 
washroom garage on top, which brings its total height to 792 feet (241 
m). Capella Tower and the Wells Fargo Center only differ in height by a 
foot or two, a rather negligible amount. Buildings have gone up and been 
torn down rapidly across the region. Some city blocks have been demolished 
six or seven times since the mid-19th century, and will undoubtedly reach 
an eighth or ninth cycle in short order.[35] No single architectural style 
dominates the region. Instead, the cities have a mish-mash of different 
designs, although structures from a few eras stand out. There were once 
a great many stone buildings constructed in the Richardsonian Romanesque 
style (or at least Romanesque-inspired variants). Minneapolis City Hall 
is one prominent example of this, though buildings of all types—including 
personal residences such as the James J. Hill House—were similarly designed.[36] 
A few decades later, Art Deco brought several structures that survive today, 
including St. Paul City Hall, the Foshay Tower, and the Minneapolis Post 
Office. The style of buildings in the two cities varies greatly. In Minneapolis, 
the trend has been buildings with sleek lines and modern glass facades 
while St. Paul tends to follow a more traditional style of buildings so 
as to better accompany its older structures. St. Paul and Minneapolis in 
particular went through some massive urban renewal projects in the post-World 
War II era, so a vast number of buildings are now lost to history. Some 
of the larger and harder to demolish structures have survived.[35] In fact, 
the area might be signified more by bridges than buildings. A series of 
reinforced concrete arch spans crossing the Mississippi River were built 
in the 1920s and 1930s. They still carry daily traffic, but remain pleasing 
to the eye despite their age (a number have undergone major repair work, 
but retain the original design). Several of the bridges are listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places. They include the 10th Avenue Bridge, 
Intercity Bridge (Ford Parkway), Robert Street Bridge, and the longest, 
the 4119 ft (1255 m) Mendota Bridge next to Fort Snelling. The area is 
also noted for having the first known permanent crossing of the Mississippi. 
That structure is long gone, but a series of Hennepin Avenue Bridges have 
been built since then at the site. Both downtowns have extensive networks 
of enclosed pedestrian bridges known as skyways. Several prominent buildings 
in Minneapolis have helped modernize the city. These include the Walker 
Art Center, Central Public Library, Weisman Art Museum and the Guthrie 
Theater. Opened in April 2005, the new Walker Art Center, nearly double 
in size, includes increased indoor and outdoor facilities. The Walker is 
recognized internationally as a singular model of a multidisciplinary arts 
organization and as a national leader for its innovative approaches to 
audience engagement. The Guthrie received a large amount of media coverage 
for its opening in June, 2006. The design is the work of architect Jean 
Nouvel and is a 285,000 square foot (26,500 m²) facility that houses three 
theaters: (1) the theater's signature thrust stage, seating 1,100, (2) 
a 700-seat proscenium stage, and (3) a black-box studio with flexible seating. 
In 2002 the National Trust for Historic Preservation put the old Guthrie 
building on its list of the most endangered historic properties in the 
United States in response to plans announced by the Walker Art Center to 
expand on the land occupied by the theater. However, the original Guthrie 
building was torn down in 2006. These building projects have rejuvenated 
the downtown area. In the 20th century, the Twin Cities area expanded outward 
significantly. Automobiles made it possible for suburbs to grow greatly. 
The area now has a number of freeways to transport people by car. The area 
incorporates a large number of traffic cameras and ramp meters to monitor 
and manage traffic congestion. There is some use of high-occupancy vehicle 
(carpool) lanes, though it is not as pervasive as in other regions. When 
the roads do become congested, buses are allowed to drive on road shoulders 
to bypass traffic jams. Interstate 94 comes into the area from the east 
and heads northwest from Minneapolis. Two spur routes form the I-494/I-694 
loop, and I-394 continues west when I-94 turns north. Additionally, Interstate 
35 splits in Burnsville in the southern part of the Twin Cities region, 
bringing I-35E into St. Paul and I-35W into Minneapolis. They join together 
again to the north in Columbus, just south of Forest Lake and continue 
to the highway's terminus in Duluth. This is one of only two examples of 
an Interstate highway splitting off into branches and then rejoining into 
one again; the other split occurs in Dallas-Fort Worth, where I-35 splits 
into I-35E for motorists going to Dallas and I-35W for traffic heading 
into Fort Worth. On Wednesday, August 1, 2007, a large portion of the I-35W 
Mississippi River bridge near University Avenue in the city of Minneapolis 
collapsed into the Mississippi River around 6:05pm CDT.[37][38] A replacement 
bridge opened on Thursday, September 18, 2008. [39] The main airport in 
the region is Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport (MSP), which is 
a major hub for Delta Air Lines. The airport is also the main hub and operating 
base for Sun Country Airlines. A number of other smaller airports are also 
in the area, a number of which are owned and operated by the Metropolitan 
Airports Commission (the same organization operates the main MSP airport). 
Some people even commute by air to the Twin Cities from the northern part 
of the state. Metro Transit, by far the biggest bus service provider in 
the area, owes its existence to the old streetcar lines that ran in the 
area. Metro Transit provides about 95% of the public transit rides in the 
region with nearly 900 buses, although some suburbs have other bus services. 
The University of Minnesota, Twin Cities operates a free bus system between 
its campuses. This system includes the Campus Connector Bus Rapid Transit 
line which travels between the Minneapolis and St. Paul Campuses by a dedicated 
bus line, and throughout the two campuses on normal access roads. The METRO 
Blue Line LRT (light rail) began operations in June 2004, connecting downtown 
Minneapolis, Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and the Mall of 
America in Bloomington. It was followed by the METRO Red Line BRT (bus 
rapid transitway) in 2013 connecting the Mall of America with Lakeville 
along Cedar Avenue through the southern suburbs. The METRO Green Line LRT 
connecting downtown Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota campus and 
downtown St. Paul along University Avenue opened in June 2014.[40] All 
three lines are operated by Metro Transit. Additionally, the Northstar 
Line commuter rail line connecting Minneapolis with Big Lake opened in 
November 2009; the line may be extended to St. Cloud as ridership numbers 
warrant. In many ways the light rail of today is a return to the streetcars 
that existed in the past, it is being used as a stepping-stone to other 
projects. A variety of rail services are currently being pondered by state 
and local governments, including neighborhood streetcar systems, intercity 
light rail service, and commuter rail options out to exurban regions. In 
addition, Minnesota is one of several states in the Midwest examining the 
idea of setting up high-speed rail service using Chicago as a regional 
hub.[41] The Minneapolis–St. Paul area has been criticized for inadequate 
public transportation.[42] Compared to many other cities its size, the 
public transportation system in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area is less robust. 
As the metropolitan area has grown, the roads and highways have been updated 
and widened, but traffic volume is growing faster than the projects needed 
to widen them, and public transportation has not expanded enough to commensurate 
with the population. The Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area is ranked 
as the fifth worst for congestion growth of similar-sized U.S. metropolitan 
areas.[42][dead link] Additional lines and spurs are needed to upgrade 
public transportation in the Twin Cities.[43] Plans are underway for Green 
Line extension connecting downtown Minneapolis to the southwest suburb 
of Eden Prairie. A northwest LRT (Blue Line extension) along Bottineau 
Boulevard is being planned from downtown Minneapolis to Brooklyn Park. 
The METRO Orange Line BRT will open in 2019, connecting downtown Minneapolis 
with Lakeville to the south along I-35W. The Twin Cities have two major 
daily newspapers: the Star Tribune and the Saint Paul Pioneer Press. Additionally, 
the Minnesota Daily serves the University of Minnesota's Twin Cities campus 
and surrounding neighborhoods. There is one general-interest neighborhood 
weekly newspaper still in the cities: The East Side Review, devoted to 
the 90,000 residents in the eastern third of St. Paul. Other weekly papers 
are devoted to specific audiences/demographics including City Pages. The 
region is currently ranked as the 15th largest television market according 
to Nielson Media Research. Twin Cities PBS operates both KTCA and KTCI. 
Hubbard Broadcasting built by Stanley E. Hubbard owns KSTP and has a second 
TV station, KSTC, which is not affiliated with any network. Diversified 
from radio, KSTP-TV became the first television channel to air in the region 
with a show reaching 3,000 television sets in 1948, and the 17th station 
to broadcast in the U.S.[44] KMSP and WFTC have now merged as well, and 
KARE currently has a marketing agreement with KPXM-TV. The only station 
with its main studios in Minneapolis is WCCO, while St. Paul is host to 
KSTP/KSTC, KTCA/KTCI, and WUCW. KARE has a sprawling broadcasting complex 
in west suburban Golden Valley. KMSP is located in southwest suburban Eden 
Prairie. Other stations are located in the suburbs. For much of the last 
two decades, WCCO and KARE have shared in having the most popular evening 
newscasts of the area channels. On the other end, KSTP has struggled to 
maintain ratings on its news programs. KMSP has had a 9 o'clock newscast 
since at least the early 1990s when it was an independent channel. Communities 
in the region have their own Public, educational, and government access 
(PEG) cable television channels. One channel, the Metro Cable Network, 
is available on channel 6 on cable systems across the seven-county region. 
Several television programs originating in the Twin Cities have been aired 
nationally on terrestrial and cable TV networks. KTCA created the science 
program Newton's Apple and distributes a children's program today. A few 
unusual comedic shows also originated in the area. In the 1980s, KTMA (predecessor 
to KMWB) created a number of low-budget shows, including cult classic Mystery 
Science Theater 3000. The short-lived Let's Bowl started on KARE, and PBS 
series Mental Engineering originated on the St. Paul cable access network. 
The radio market in the Twin Cities is considered to be somewhat smaller 
than for TV, ranked 16th. For decades, WCCO radio was the most well-known 
and most popular broadcaster in the region, with an all-day talk format. 
WCCO was eventually pushed out of the top spot by KQRS-FM, a classic rock 
station with a popular morning show. KSTP also has some fairly popular 
radio stations, with pop music format on FM and ESPN Radio on AM. KSTP-AM 
and FM are owned by Hubbard Broadcasting. In 1985, Hubbard – valued at 
$400 million – was one of the larger corporate media companies in the United 
States; in 2005, valued at US $1.2 billion, Hubbard is a fairly small major-market 
media operation. The Twin Cities have a peculiar mix of commercial and 
non-commercial radio. The city's market is dominated by Clear Channel Communications 
which operates seven stations but two small independent stations are award 
winners—KUOM operated by the University of Minnesota and KFAI public access 
radio in Cedar Riverside.[45] Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) is also a major 
force in the state and across the country, best known across the U.S. for 
the variety show A Prairie Home Companion. Doing business under the name 
American Public Media, the company is the second largest producer of national 
public radio content, behind National Public Radio (of which MPR is an 
affiliate). The Current is an affiliate of MPR, as well, and it is member 
supported. The station gives the audience a taste of the local music scene 
and it is widely popular among indie listeners. The Twin Cities is also 
home to many independent media organizations, including The UpTake, MinnPost 
and Twin Cities Daily Planet. The United States Navy currently has one 
ship named for the region, the USS Minneapolis–Saint Paul, a Los Angeles-class 
submarine launched in 1983. Previously, two sets of two ships each had 
carried the names USS Minneapolis and USS Saint Paul. Coordinates: 44°57′N
