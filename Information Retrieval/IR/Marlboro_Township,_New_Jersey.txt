Marlboro Township is a township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United 
States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the township had a population 
of 40,191,[9][10][11] reflecting an increase of 5,449 (+16.3%) from the 
33,423 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 6,707 
(+25.1%) from the 26,716 counted in the 1990 Census.[20] Marlboro Township 
was formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 17, 1848, 
from portions of Freehold Township.[21] The township was named for the 
marl beds found in the area.[22] While there is some debate on this, the 
Lenni Lenape Native Americans were the first known organized inhabitants 
of this area, having settled here about one thousand years ago and forming 
an agricultural society, occupying small villages that dotted what was 
to become Marlboro Township.[23] In 1600, the Delaware / Lenape Native 
American population in the surrounding area may have numbered as many as 
20,000.[24][25] Several wars, at least 14 separate epidemics (yellow fever, 
small pox, influenza, encephalitis lethargica, etc.) and disastrous over-harvesting 
of the animal populations reduced their population to around 4,000 by the 
year 1700. Since the Lenape people, like all Native Americans, had no immunity 
to European diseases, when the populations contacted the epidemics, they 
frequently proved fatal.[26] Some Lenape starved to death as a result of 
animal over-harvesting, while others were forced to trade their land for 
goods such as clothing and food. They were eventually moved to reservations 
set up by the US Government. They were first moved to the only Indian Reservation 
in New Jersey, the Brotherton Reservation in Burlington County, New Jersey 
(1758-1802).[27] Those who remained survived through attempting to adapt 
to the dominant culture, becoming farmers and tradesmen.[28] As the Lenni 
Lenape population declined, and the European population increased, the 
history of the area was increasingly defined by the new European inhabitants 
and the Lenape Native American tribes played an increasingly secondary 
role. After the Dutch arrival to the region in the 1620s, the Lenape were 
successful in restricting Dutch settlement to Pavonia in present-day Jersey 
City along the Hudson until the 1660s and the Swedish settlement to New 
Sweden (1655 - The Dutch defeat the Swedes on the Delaware). The Dutch 
finally established a garrison at Bergen, allowing settlement of areas 
within the province of New Netherland. Within a period of 112 years, 1497–1609, 
four European explorers claimed this land for their sponsors: John Cabot, 
1497, for England; Giovanni de Verrazano, 1524, for France; Estevan Gomez, 
1525, for Spain, Henry Hudson, 1609, for Holland. Then for 50 years, 1614–1664, 
the Monmouth County area came under the influence of the Dutch, but it 
was not settled until English rule in 1664. The initial European proprietors 
of the area purchased the land from the Lenni Lenape leader or Sakamaker.[29] 
The chief of the Unami, or Turtle clan, was traditionally the great chief 
of all the Lenni Lenape. One of the sons of the leader, was Weequehela[30] 
who negotiated the sale of several of the initial tracts of land to the 
first farmers.[31] An early deed refers to "the chief sachems or leaders 
of Toponemus." Their main village was near Wickatunk in Marlboro Township.[32] 
On April 2, 1664, the English appointed Richard Nicolls to serve as the 
Deputy Governor of New York and New Jersey. One year later, April 8, 1665, 
Nicolls issued "The Monmouth Patent" to twelve men who had come from Western 
Long Island and New England seeking permanent stability for religious and 
civil freedom as well as the prospect of improving their estates. Nicolls 
was unaware that in June, 1664, James had given a lease and release for 
New Jersey to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, thus invalidating 
the grant to the Monmouth Patentees.[33] The rule at the time was that 
land should be purchased from the Patent. However, in the time between 
1685 and the early 18th century, the patent was ignored and land was gradually 
purchased from the Lenni Lenape causing confusion and disputes over ownership. 
Following the initial sale of land, the history of the township starts 
about 1685, when the land was first settled by European farmers from Scotland, 
England and the Netherlands. The Scottish exiles[34] and early Dutch settlers 
lived on isolated clearings carved out of the forest.[35] The lingua franca 
or common language spoken in the area was likely, overwhelmingly Dutch. 
However, this was one of many languages spoken with the culture very steeped 
in New Netherlander. The official documentation at the time is frequently 
found to be in the Dutch language. The documents of the time also suggest 
that money transactions used the British shilling.[36] The English and 
Scotch settlers were Quakers. After initial European contact, the Lenape 
population sharply declined. The first settlers of the area were led by 
missionary George Keith. They were Quakers. The Quakers established a town 
called "Topanemus" and nearby a meetinghouse and a cemetery on what is 
now Topanemus Road[37] and held the first meeting on October 10, 1702.[38] 
The first leader of the church was Rev. George Keith who received a large 
grant of land[39] in the area due to his position as Surveyor-General.[40] 
Among the first listed communicants of the new church were Garret and Jan 
Schenck.[41] The church later changed its affiliation to the Episcopal 
faith and became St. Peter's Episcopal Church which is now located in Freehold.[42] 
The old burial ground still remains on Topanemus Road. In 1692 those of 
the Presbyterian Faith built a church and burial ground on what is now 
Gordons Corner Road. The church eventually moved to Tennent where it became 
known as the Old Tennent Church and played a role in the American Revolutionary 
War. The old Scots Cemetery still remains at its original site. The township 
of Marlboro is named for the prevalence of marl,[43] which was first discovered 
in the area east of the village in 1768. The "Marl Pits" are clearly reflected 
on maps from 1889 shown as a dirt road off of Hudson Street heading towards 
the current location of the township soccer fields.[44] Farmers used marl 
to improve the soil in the days before commercial fertilizers and there 
was a heavy demand for it. Marlboro Township's first industry was the export 
of the material, used primarily as fertilizer. In 1853, the Marl was harvested 
and transported to other parts of the state and to the Keyport docks via 
the Freehold Marl Company Railroad (now the Henry Hudson Trail).[45][46] 
The marl was then sent to New York and other parts of the country via ship.[47] 
Prior to the finding of Marl, the area was known as 'Bucktown' for John 
Buck who owned a tavern in the area.[48] Marlboro Township was the scene 
of a number of skirmishes during the American Revolutionary War, in particular 
following the Battle of Monmouth in 1778. During the war, the Pleasant 
Valley section was often raided by the British for food supplies and livestock.[47] 
The area was referred to as the "Hornet's Nest" because of the intensity 
of attacks on the British by local militia.[49] Beacon Hill (of present-day 
Beacon Hill Road) was one of three Monmouth County sites where beacons 
were placed to warn the residents and the Continental forces if the enemy 
should approach from the bay.[50][51] There was also considerable activity 
in the Montrose area of the Township as British troops, retreating from 
the Battle of Monmouth, tried to wind their way to ships lying off Sandy 
Hook.[52] Under the direction and influence of John W. Herbert,[53] Marlboro 
was established as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on 
February 17, 1848, formed from portions of Freehold Township.[21] The township's 
name was originally "Marlborough," but was subsequently changed to "Marlboro."[54] 
It is unknown when the name was officially changed, with maps and other 
documents in the decades after the township's establishment referring variously 
to "Marlboro"[55] or "Marlborough".[56][57] The first elected freeholder 
was John W. Herbert. Marlboro was rural and composed mostly of dairy farms, 
potato, tomato and other farms laced with small hamlets with modest inns 
or taverns. Before World War II Marlboro Township was actually the nation's 
largest grower of potatoes and also known for a large tomato and egg industry.[58] 
During World War II, egg farms significantly expanded to accommodate military 
demand. Following World War II, the state began to significantly build 
and improve the area transportation infrastructure. As the infrastructure 
improved, the population started to increase. The 50s and 60s saw Marlboro 
starting to significantly grow. Housing developments started to replace 
the farm and rural nature as the community expanded. After the early 1970s, 
Marlboro became a growing suburb for people working in New York and in 
large nearby corporations. During the 1980s and early 1990s most of the 
new housing developments featured four- or five-bedroom houses, but later 
the trend shifted toward larger estate homes. The building effort became 
so advanced that Marlboro Township placed restrictions for building around 
wetlands; called the Stream Corridor Preservation Restrictions to mitigate 
construction and habitat contamination. The year 2000 saw continued growth 
of the housing trend toward larger homes. Towards the end of the decade, 
housing growth declined due to the Great Recession. The Marlboro township 
center has historically been considered an area around the intersection 
of Main Street (Route 79) and School Road.[59] In the late 19th century 
the intersection held a hotel [currently fire department parking lot], 
general store [was on the lot of the current fire department building], 
and Post Office [was on the lot of a current Chinese Restaurant]. Behind 
the current small mini-mart on the corner of this intersection, you can 
still see one of the original barns from the early 19th century. The township 
of Marlboro has erected signs in front of historically significant buildings 
to explain their historical significant status. Multiple signs can be seen 
along Main Street and on some other streets in the town center area. However, 
Marlboro no longer has any official town center and can be considered an 
example of suburban sprawl. Efforts are underway to create an official 
"Village Center" and multiple proposals have come forward in recent discussions.[60] 
Current vision statements suggest the creation of a pedestrian-friendly, 
mixed use Village Center, with an emphasis on walkability and traffic calming.[61] 
In 2000, Marlboro became the first municipality in New Jersey, and one 
of the first areas in the U.S., to ban cell phone use while driving, a 
ban that took effect in March 2001. The restriction established made use 
of a cell phone a primary offense, allowing a police officer can stop a 
motorist for phone use.[62] Opened in 1931, Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital 
was located on 400 acres (1.6 km2) in the eastern part of the township. 
It was opened with much fanfare as a "state of the art" psychiatric facility. 
It was closed 67 years later on June 30, 1998, as part of a three-year 
deinstitutionalization plan in which some the state's largest facilities 
were being shut down, with Marlboro's 800 patients being shifted to smaller 
facilities and group homes.[63][64] The land that the hospital was placed 
on was known as the "Big Woods Settlement". It was largely farm land but 
there was a large distillery on the property which was torn down to make 
room for the hospital.[55] Additionally, due to the long residential stays 
at the hospital, a cemetery was also located near the hospital for the 
residents who died while in residence and were unclaimed. There is currently 
a large fence around the hospital and the hospital was completely demolished 
in 2015. Most of the land was handed over to the Monmouth County Park system 
park and some of the ground will be the final linkage of the Henry Hudson 
Trail. The park system had developed the Big Brook Park and continues to 
expand and work on the park to provide services to the Monmouth County 
residents. In June 2009, Marlboro Township Municipal Utilities Authority 
(MTMUA) deployed a 900 kW solar power array from Sharp that will enable 
the MTMUA to meet nearly 40% of its electricity needs with emissions-free 
solar-generated power. This is considered one of the largest of its kind 
in the East. This solar energy system will reduce New Jersey CO2 emissions 
by more than 4,200,000 lb (1,900,000 kg) annually; SO2 emissions by 28,000 lb 
(13,000 kg); and NO2 emissions by 18,000 lb (8,200 kg)., as well as eliminating 
significant amounts of mercury.[65] Additionally, Marlboro has been recognized 
as a Cool City by the Sierra Club. Marlboro is the 10th Monmouth County 
municipality to be named a Cool City.[66] Marlboro had an airport, Preston 
Airfield, which opened in 1954 and was in operation for almost 50 years. 
The airport was opened by Rhea Preston on his farm and consisted of two 
runways, one was 2,400 feet (730 m) as well as airplane hangars. It obtained 
a paved runway before 1972. Exact records are not known as to when it changed 
its name to Marlboro Airport. It is believed to be somewhere between 1975 
and 1979. In 1979, the airport was described as having a single runway 
2,200 feet (670 m) long. In 2000, the airport was purchased by Marlboro 
Holdings LLC owned by Anthony Spalliero who closed it with the intent to 
redevelop the airport into housing.[67] To foster the case for redevelopment, 
Spalliero donated land holdings he had near the airport to the township 
Board of Education, which was used to develop the Marlboro Early Learning 
Center, a school specialized for kindergarten classes. Following a $100,000 
pay-off[68] to former Mayor Matthew Scannapieco the planning board used 
the distance to the new school as justification to close the airfield[69] 
citing a reference to a fatal plane crash in 1997.[70] Part of the airport 
has now been developed into Marlboro Memorial Cemetery which now borders 
the defunct airfield.[71] Starting in 1989, Joseph Januszkiewicz started 
reporting visions of the Virgin Mary near the blue spruce trees in his 
yard at exactly 9:28pm.[72] The visions started to appear six months after 
he returned from a pilgrimage to Medjugorje in Yugoslavia. Since that time 
as many as 8,000 pilgrims gathered on the first Sundays of June, July, 
August and September to pray, meditate and share in the vision.[73] On 
September 7, 1992, Bishop John C. Reiss gave Januszkiewicz permission to 
release his messages. In 1993, Catholic Diocese of Trenton ruled that nothing 
"truly miraculous" was happening at the Januszkiewicz home. Pictures were 
taken in November 2004 of a mist that showed up at the location of the 
vision, though by April 2005, Januszkiewicz claimed that the visions had 
stopped and he reports there have been no sightings since.[74] This church 
was built in 1878. It is located on Route 520, in the Bradeveldt section 
of Marlboro. The significance of this building was its use by the congregation 
of St. Gabriel. Organized in 1871 the congregation constructed this Victorian 
Gothic church in 1878. Although a new church and rectory were constructed 
on Route 79 in 1972, and a parish center in the 1980s, this building has 
remained in continuous use. Frequently used for weddings and other similar 
events.[75] The house was built in 1828. It is located on North Main Street 
in Marlboro, directly next to the fire house. Its significance was the 
home of Addison Hobart, a businessman, teacher, postmaster, and Commissioner 
of Deeds. Garrett Hobart, his son, lived in this house and later entered 
politics, ultimately becoming Vice President of the United States in 1896 
under William McKinley. Garrett Hobart died in 1899. The house is currently 
used as an art studio.[76] The building was built, circa 1904. Its location 
is: Sisters of the Good Shepherd, Pleasant Valley Road. The significance 
of the building was a "Rest Hill," an assemblage of many old farmsteads, 
was purchased for a vacation home by magazine publisher Peter Collier. 
His son, Robert, was an aviation enthusiast who purchased the first Wright 
Brothers biplane and housed it at the estate. The porch is a replica of 
Mt. Vernon. Robert's widow, Sarah Van Alen, donated the estate in 1927 
to the Sisters of the Good Shepherd.[77] Discovered in 1997 and located 
near one of the Big Brook tributaries, The Marlboro Tree, a massive black 
willow tree has been certified by the New Jersey Forest Service as a "State 
Champion" tree, signifying that it is the largest known tree of its species 
in the State of New Jersey, and the largest tree of any kind in Marlboro 
Township. It is about 152 years old and measures 76 feet (23 m) high and 
19' 8" in circumference. Five grown people must hold hands to fully encircle 
the tree.[78] On the National Register of Historic Places since August 
2001, is Old Scots Burial Grounds, which was established around 1705.[79] 
Under active study, archaeologist Gerard Scharfenberger is working to excavate 
the foundation of the original Old Scots Meeting House as well as any unmarked 
graves on the property. This is the original location where the congregation 
of the Old Tennent Presbyterian Church once met.[80] It is also part of 
the site where the Battle of Monmouth was fought.[81] John Boyd, the first 
Presbyterian minister trained in the New World, was buried here in 1708. 
The cemetery dates back to the 1600’s. Many of the area founding fathers 
from Freehold, Bayshore, Matawan, and Marlboro are buried there. Other, 
important people in the founding of Monmouth County such as John Reid, 
John Anderson, and Thomas Warne as well as 4 of Matawan’s original 24 founders 
are buried there. Topanemus Cemetery developed out of the need for a cemetery 
for the Topanemus settlement which was an original settlement for the Marlboro 
Area. The cemetery is believed to be the oldest in Monmouth County, apart 
from some individual sequestered family burial plots. The Cemetery is known 
to contain many historically significant and/or famous people of the time. 
There are believed to be 112 known graves in the cemetery.[82] Originally 
built in 1832, Robertsville Elementary School was once a one-room schoolhouse 
that was built on the corner of Tennent and Union Hill Roads. It was remodeled/rebuilt 
in 1912 and used for special education purposes at that time. This building 
is still standing today. The current Robertsville School was constructed 
in 1968 down the road from the original schoolhouse. It is believed to 
have been named after Matthew Roberts, a prominent businessman in the day.[83] 
In addition to the school use, it was also used for weekly Methodist services 
by the congregation that evolved into the Robertsville Bible Church.[citation 
needed] A memorial was constructed in memory of the 14 township residents 
killed as the result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Located 
near the Marlboro Recreation Center, the memorial consists of a circle 
of flowering dogwoods, surrounding benches and a memorial fountain on the 
township municipal grounds.[84] The memorial was badly damaged and is currently 
being renovated after a serious motor vehicle accident in 2009. The Battle 
of Monmouth as well as a number of skirmishes were fought near Marlboro 
Township during the American Revolutionary War. Many area placards and 
signs can be found on the local roads to identify specific local events 
from the battle. The Marlboro Township area farms were often raided by 
the British for food supplies and local livestock taken from area farmers. 
Following defeat in this battle, the British retreated from the area to 
their ships in the bay. A local state park, Monmouth Battlefield State 
Park, nearby in Freehold Township and Manalapan Township provides local 
reference to this historic event. Liberty Hall also went by the name of 
Alfred Hardy & Son Blacksmith Shop, was a small brick building located 
on Route 79 in the small section of Morganville. The building was reportedly 
built around 1880. The building name could faintly be seen in scripted 
letters painted over the door of the building. The blacksmith shop operated 
into the early 20th century and was one of the last blacksmith operations 
in the area. Following the blacksmith shop closing, the building housed 
a machine shop until 1942 when a small defense contractor, Lavoie Laboratories 
bought it to produce radio gear for the military.[85] In 1966, Lavoie sold 
it to Entron Industries, a manufacturer of missile circuitry that occupied 
the building until the mid-1970s. The building was torn down in June 2012 
after being in disrepair and abandoned.[86] There is now a Townhouse development 
on the site. This church was known as the Freehold-Middletown Dutch Congregation 
(now Old Brick Church.) The Dutch residents who attended this church names 
appear in the early records and grave stones dating from 1709 (early records 
were written in the Dutch language.) In the beginning when services began, 
circa 1699, the preachers would come across the bay in small boats from 
Long Island to provide the service to the people of the parish.[32] Built 
circa 1740 and once owned by the Ely family, the Federal style house resembles 
a steamboat with a rounded north end. The smokehouse and ice house remain 
intact. During the early 19th century, the house served as an inn.[87] 
The house is one of a few of this style left in the country. Being the 
second highest point in the county, Col. Asher Holmes was ordered to construct 
three beacons as part of 23 statewide warning beacons. Used to signal local 
militia of British invasion, each pyramid of logs was 18 feet (5.5 m) high 
and 20 feet (6.1 m) wide. When filled with brush and lit, the fires could 
be seen through the area. It was one of three Monmouth County sites where 
beacons were placed to warn the residents and the Continental forces if 
the enemy should approach by the bay.[88] According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 30.471 square miles (78.921 km2), 
including 30.361 square miles (78.636 km2) of land and 0.110 square miles 
(0.285 km2) of water (0.36%).[1][2] The New Jersey Geological Survey map 
suggests the land is mostly made up of cretaceous soil consisting of sand, 
silt and clay.[89] Morganville (2010 Census population of 5,040[90]) and 
Robertsville (2010 population of 11,297[91]) are census-designated places 
and unincorporated communities located within Marlboro Township.[92][93] 
Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the township include Beacon Hill, Bradevelt, Claytons 
Corner, Henningers Mills, Herberts Corner, Hillsdale, Marlboro (also known 
as Marlboro Village[citation needed]), Monmouth Heights, Montrose, Mount 
Pleasant, Pleasant Valley, Smocks Corner, Spring Valley and Wickatunk.[94] 
The township borders Aberdeen Township, Colts Neck Township, Freehold Township, 
Holmdel Township, Manalapan Township and Matawan in Monmouth County, and 
Old Bridge Township in Middlesex County.[95] Marlboro Township is located 
close to the Atlantic Ocean. Due to the Marlboro Township's location on 
the Eastern Seaboard, the following weather features are noted:[96] According 
to the Köppen climate classification, Marlboro Township is considered to 
be in the Cfa zone. Marlboro Township has a humid sub-tropical climate 
placing it in Zone 7B on the USDA hardiness scale. This extends from Monmouth 
County, NJ to Northern Georgia. Because of its sheltered location and proximity 
to the Atlantic Ocean, some Palm trees can survive with minimal winter 
protection. Also, many Southern Magnolias, Crepe Myrtles, Musa Basjoo (Hardy 
Japanese Banana plants), native bamboo, native opuntia cactus, and bald 
cypress can be seen throughout commercial and private landscapes. Marlboro 
has experienced steady growth since 1940, with the largest population swell 
occurred during the 1960s and 1970s and a noticeable increase of 10,414 
people from 1980-1990. The pace of the growth has slowed in the last decade.[61]

The median age was 41.7 years. For every 100 females there were 95.8 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.7 males.[9] The Census 
Bureau's 2006-2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted 
dollars) median household income was $130,400 (with a margin of error of 
+/- $6,434) and the median family income was $145,302 (+/- $7,377). Males

for females. The per capita income for the township was $50,480 (+/- $2,265). 
About 1.2% of families and 1.6% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 1.7% of those under age 18 and 2.2% of those age 65 or 
over.[110] As of the 2000 United States Census[17] there were 36,398 people, 
11,478 households, and 10,169 families residing in the township. The population

The number of violent crimes recorded by the FBI in 2003 was 15. The number 
of murders and homicides was 5. The violent crime rate was reported to 
be very low, at 0.4 per 1,000 people.[111] The median home cost in Marlboro 
Township was $446,890. Home prices decreased by 8.18% in 2010. Compared 
to the rest of the country, Marlboro Township's cost of living is 57% higher 
than the U.S. average.[112] As part of its obligation under the Mount Laurel 
doctrine, the Council on Affordable Housing requires Marlboro Township 
to provide 1,673 low / moderate income housing units.[113] The first two 
rounds of New Jersey's affordable housing regulations ran from 1987 to 
1999. Under a Regional Contribution Agreement (RCA), Marlboro Township 
signed an agreement in June 2008 that would have Trenton build or rehabilitate 
332 housing units, with Marlboro Township paying $25,000 per unit, a total 
of $8.3 million to Trenton for taking on the responsibility for these units.[114] 
Under proposed legislation, municipalities may lose the ability to use 
these RCAs to pay other communities to accept their New Jersey COAH fair 
housing obligations, which would mean that Marlboro Township is now required 
to build the balance of housing. When the New Jersey Council on Affordable 
Housing requested plans to complete this obligation, Marlboro generated 
the largest number of objectors to an affordable housing plan in the history 
of New Jersey.[113] Numerous appeals followed and in October 2010, the 
Appellate Division struck down portions of the 2007 regulations, invalidated 
the growth share methodology and directed COAH to develop new regulations. 
The NJ supreme court granted all petitions for certification in October 
2010 and is set to hear the appeals. In June 2011, the Governor issued 
a reorganization plan which eliminated the 12-member COAH, though state 
courts overturned the governor's plan.[61] Marlboro Township has a number 
of retirement communities, which include: Marlboro has a township-sponsored 
recreation program, with activities for all ages including active soccer 
and basketball[117] leagues for boys and girls; in addition Little League 
baseball / softball and Pop Warner football / cheerleading, and a growing 
amateur wrestling program. In the summer, the Township holds free outdoor 
concerts by notable popular music artists. In recent years performers have 
included Jay and the Americans, Bill Haley's Comets, Lesley Gore, Little 
Anthony & The Imperials, Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge, The Platters, 
The Trammps, and The Tokens. In 2007, Marlboro introduced monthly indoor 
concerts at the recreation center. These shows feature many upcoming artists 
as well as local talent. Artists have included Marlboro's own Bedlight 
For Blue Eyes and Sound The Alarm. Marlboro is also home to the Marlboro 
Players, a private theater group that holds open auditions for background 
roles. Formed in 1975, the group presented its first performance, Don't 
Drink the Water, in the following spring.[118] For walkers and bicyclists, 
two segments of the Henry Hudson Trail have substantial stretches within 
the township.[119] The Recreation Commission maintains several parks and 
facilities for public use. However, some ball fields require permits for 
usage. The following is a list of recreation facilities: Marlboro has an 
off-leash dog park located at the township municipal complex on Wyncrest 
Road.[125] Open to the public, Big Brook transects the border of Colts 
Neck and Marlboro, New Jersey. The stream cuts through sediments that were 
deposited during the Late Cretaceous period. Reportedly, prolific finds 
of fossils, such as shark teeth, and other deposits of Cretaceous marine 
fossils, including belemnites are frequently found.[126] This is a particularly 
fossiliferous site, with finds including fish teeth, crab and crustacean 
claws, shark teeth, rarely dinosaur teeth, dinosaur bone fragments (and 
on a very rare occasion a complete bone), megalodonyx (prehistoric sloth) 
teeth and bone fragments.[127] The area is regarded as one of the top three 
dinosaur fossil sites in the state. Multiple dinosaur finds have been found 
in this area.[128] In 2009, a leg section from a duckbilled dinosaur called 
a hadrosaur was found.[129][130] The first dinosaur discovery in North 
America was made in 1858 in this area.[131] Several bones from a Mastodon 
were found in 2009 by an individual fossil hunting.[132] The deposits of 
marl which gave the township its name have played a major role in preserving 
the fossils found in the area.[133] The fossil beds can be accessed from 
the bridge on Monmouth Road in Marlboro.[134] Some areas of Monmouth County 
Big Brook Park allow bow hunting access with a permit.[135] Bella Vista 
Country Club has an 18-hole course over 5,923 yards with a par of 70. It 
is considered a Private Non-Equity club.[136] The Henry Hudson Trail goes 
through parts of Marlboro. In September 2009, the Monmouth County Park 
System closed a section of the Henry Hudson Trail Southern Extension going 
through Marlboro Township (Aberdeen Township to Freehold) for 18 months 
while a portion of the path that runs through the Imperial Oil superfund 
clean-up site was remediated.[137] Marlboro Township offers a summer camp 
program for grade school children. The program is a six-week program [with 
an optional 7th week consisting of aqua-week]. It is run by the Marlboro 
Township Recreation & Parks Commission. The township has attempted to preserve 
the areas known as F&F properties, Stattel's Farm and McCarron Farm (also 
known as Golden Dale Farm) from future development. The last two farms 
are currently working farms and while the township has purchased the development 
rights on the property, their fate remains unknown.[138] The development 
rights of F&F property were purchased for $869,329 to keep the 79-acre 
(320,000 m2) site as open space. Open space funding is paid for by a number 
of sources. State and local sources account for most of the funding. Marlboro 
obtains the funding from a special tax assessment. The town collects $600,000 
annually from a local open space tax assessment of 2 cents per $100 of 
assessed valuation.[139] Marlboro Township is located near some major East 
Coast recreation attractions. One of the most notable of these attractions 
is the Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson Township. The Jersey Shore 
is also another close feature which is located south by taking Route 18 
or by taking County Route 520 east. The Freehold Raceway Mall is a super-regional 
mall anchored by J.C. Penney, Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Nordstrom and Sears. 
For horse racing, the Freehold Raceway is the oldest half-mile racetrack 
in the United States, it offers harness racing. The Manasquan Reservoir 
is 30 minutes south on Route 9 and offers nature and exercise related activities 
such as fishing, non-powered water sports, bird watching, jogging, biking, 
and paths for dog walking. The reservoir also has a regionally known Environmental 
Center offering nature exhibits where people can go see the local wildlife 
found at the park and region. The Township of Marlboro has multiple departments 
which handle emergency services. In addition to the offices below, other 
departments can be reached through a countywide directory maintained by 
the Township of Marlboro.[140] The following are the emergency service 
departments in Marlboro Township: The police department was established 
in May 1962. At that time, there was one police officer who served the 
township. The Marlboro Township Police Department is composed of over 67 
full-time police officers.[141] The current Chief of Police is Bruce E. 
Hall who started in this position in February 2009 following Police Chief 
Robert C. Holmes Sr. retiring suddenly on New Year's Eve 2008.[142] The 
Fire Prevention Bureau enforces the New Jersey Uniform Fire Code in all 
buildings, structures and premises, Condo development residential buildings 
and other owner-occupied residential buildings. The Fire Prevention Bureau 
does not enforce codes in residential units with fewer than three dwelling 
units.[143] Marlboro Township has four volunteer fire companies and two 
volunteer first aid squads:[144] SWIFT911 is a high speed notification 
program with the capability of delivering recorded warnings to the entire 
community or targeted areas, via telephone, email, text or pager. Messages 
can be transmitted through the Marlboro Township Police Department or Office 
of the Mayor and the system can contact up to four telephone numbers until 
reaching the designated party. Emergency and Non-emergency messages are 
also able to reach TTY (teletypewriter) phones used by those who are deaf 
or hard of hearing.[151] Marlboro Township is governed within the Faulkner 
Act under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government.[7] The Mayor 
is elected directly and the Marlboro Township Council is made up of five 
members, with all elected positions chosen at-large in partisan voting 
to serve four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with a municipal 
election conducted in odd-numbered years as part of the November general 
election. Three council seats come up for vote together and two other council 
seats come up for election together with the mayoral seat two years later. 
At a reorganization meeting held in January after each election, the Council 
selects a President and Vice-President from among its members. As the township's 
legislative body, the council sets policies, approves budgets, determines 
municipal tax rates, and passes resolutions and ordinances to govern the 
township. The Council also appoints citizen volunteers to certain advisory 
boards and the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Council may investigate 
the conduct of any department, officer or agency of the municipal government. 
They have full power of subpoena as permitted by statute. As of 2016[update], 
the Mayor of Marlboro Township is Democrat Jonathan Hornik, whose term 
of office ends December 31, 2019.[3] Members of the Marlboro Township Council 
are Council President Carol Mazzola (2017), Council Vice President Randi 
Marder (2019), Jeff Cantor (2017), Scott Metzger (2017) and Michael Scalea 
(2019).[152][153][154][155][156] In January 2015, the Township Council 
selected Mike Scalea from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican 
municipal committee to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2015 of 
Frank LaRocca, who resigned earlier that month to take a seat as a municipal 
judge.[157] The following individuals have served as Mayor since the Faulkner 
Act system was adopted in 1952: Political issues in Marlboro include land 
development and loss of open space, growth of population leading to the 
need for additional public schools and higher property taxes, and recurring 
instances of political corruption. Former three-term mayor Matthew Scannapieco 
was arrested by the FBI and subsequently pleaded guilty to taking $245,000 
in bribes from land developer Anthony Spalliero, in exchange for favorable 
rulings and sexual favors.[162][163] The same investigation has also resulted 
in charges against several other township officials as well as a Monmouth 
County Freeholder. Marlboro Township is located in the 6th Congressional 
District[164] and is part of New Jersey's 13th state legislative district.[10][165][166] 
Prior to the 2011 reapportionment following the 2010 Census, Marlboro Township 
had been in the 12th state legislative district.[167] Prior to the 2010 
Census, Marlboro Township had been split between the 6th Congressional 
District and the 12th Congressional District, a change made by the New 
Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based 
on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[167] New Jersey's 
Sixth Congressional District is represented by Frank Pallone (D, Long Branch).[168] 
New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, 
Newark, term ends 2021)[169] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[170][171] 
For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 13th Legislative 
District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate 
by Joseph M. Kyrillos (R, Middletown Township) and in the General Assembly 
by Amy Handlin (R, Middletown Township) and Declan O'Scanlon (R, Little 
Silver).[172] The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham 
Township).[173] The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, 
Monmouth Beach).[174] Monmouth County is governed by a Board of Chosen 
Freeholders consisting of five members who are elected at-large to serve 
three year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two 
seats up for election each year as part of the November general election. 
At an annual reorganization meeting held in the beginning of January, the 
board selects one of its members to serve as Director and another as Deputy 
Director.[175] As of 2014[update], Monmouth County's Freeholders are Freeholder 
Director Lillian G. Burry (R, Colts Neck Township; term ends December 31, 
2014),[176] Freeholder Deputy Director Gary J. Rich, Sr. (R, Spring Lake; 
2014),[177] Thomas A. Arnone (R, Neptune City; 2016),[178] John P. Curley 
(R, Middletown Township; 2015)[179] and Serena DiMaso (R, Holmdel Township; 
2016).[180][181] Constitutional officers elected on a countywide basis 
are County Clerk M. Claire French (Wall Township),[182] Sheriff Shaun Golden 
(Farmingdale)[183] and Surrogate Rosemarie D. Peters (Middletown Township).[184] 
As of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 26,633 registered voters in 
Marlboro Township, of which 7,125 (26.8%) were registered as Democrats, 
4,299 (16.1%) were registered as Republicans and 15,202 (57.1%) were registered 
as Unaffiliated. There were 7 voters registered to other parties.[185] 
In the 2012 presidential election, Republican Mitt Romney received 53.5% 
of the vote (9,915 cast), ahead of Democrat Barack Obama with 45.6% (8,450 
votes), and other candidates with 0.8% (154 votes), among the 18,636 ballots

The Marlboro Township Public School District serves students in pre-Kindergarten 
through eighth grade. The district is composed of eight school facilities: 
one pre-school, five elementary schools and two middle schools. As of the 
2011-12 school year, the district's eight schools had an enrollment of 
4,587 students and 419.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher 
ratio of 10.93:1.[193] Schools in the district (with 2011-12 enrollment 
data from the National Center for Education Statistics[194]) are David 
C. Abbott Early Learning Center[195] for kindergarten and preschool special 
education (422 students), five elementary schools for grades 1-5: Frank 
Defino Central Elementary School[196] (558), Frank J. Dugan Elementary 
School[197] (626), Asher Holmes Elementary School[198] (542), Marlboro 
Elementary School[199] (473) and Robertsville Elementary School[200] (470); 
both Marlboro Memorial Middle School home of the Monarch Lions[201] (NA) 
and Marlboro Middle School home of the Hawks[202] (NA) for grades 6-8.[203][204] 
Marlboro Township has a public high school, Marlboro High School (opened 
1968), home of the Mustangs, which is part of the Freehold Regional High 
School District serving ninth through twelfth grades, with some Marlboro 
students attending Colts Neck High School.[205] The district also serves 
students from Colts Neck Township, Englishtown, Farmingdale, Freehold Borough, 
Freehold Township, Howell Township and Manalapan Township.[206] Many Marlboro 
students attend the various Learning Centers and Academies available at 
other district high schools and students from other municipalities in the 
district attend Marlboro High School's Business Learning Center.[207] The 
High Point Schools are a group of private special education elementary 
and adolescent schools located on a 10-acre (40,000 m2) campus in the Morganville 
section of the township. The schools have been providing educational and 
therapeutic services for students ages 5 – 21 who have emotional, behavioral 
and learning difficulties for 45 years. The staff-to-student ratio is 1:3.[208] 
Among other private schools serving Marlboro children is the Solomon Schechter 
Day School of Greater Monmouth County, a Pre-K to Grade 8 Jewish Day School, 
which is a member of the Solomon Schechter Day School Association, the 
educational arm of the United Synagogue of America.[209] Shalom Torah Academy 
in Morganville is an independent Jewish day school that serves students 
from the age of two through eighth grade.[210] The Marlboro Free Public 
Library is open six days a week (closed Sundays). There are meeting rooms 
for groups to gather and hold meetings or parties. The children's department 
is large and well-lit, with a diverse selection of books. There is no additional 
charge for movie rentals.[213] Marlboro Township has two Little Free Library 
locations at opposite sides of the town. The first is in Morganville subdivision 
and the second is toward the town center, close to the town hall. As of 
May 2010[update], the township had a total of 229.71 miles (369.68 km) 
of roadways, of which 201.56 miles (324.38 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
11.05 miles (17.78 km) by Monmouth County and 17.10 miles (27.52 km) by 
the New Jersey Department of Transportation.[214] The car is the most common 
mode of transportation in Marlboro Township. The main public thoroughfares 
in Marlboro Township are U.S. Route 9, Route 18, County Route 520 and Route 
79. These routes provide access to major highways including the Garden 
State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. Taxi services are also available 
through a number of local private companies. There are multiple public 
transportation options available, including bus, rail, air and ferry service. 
NJ Transit provides bus service to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal 
in Midtown Manhattan on the 131, 135 and 139 routes; on the 64 and 67 and 
from both Jersey City and Newark.[215] The Matawan train station is a heavily 
used train station on New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line, providing 
service to New York Pennsylvania Station via Secaucus Junction, with a 
transfer available for trains to Newark Liberty International Airport. 
However, both options provide significant problems in terms of lack of 
available parking, which may require waiting periods of more than a year 
for a permit and private parking options are very expensive.[47] Ferry 
service is available through the SeaStreak service in Highlands, a trip 
that involves about a 45-minute drive on secondary roads from Marlboro 
Township to reach the departing terminal. SeaStreak offers ferry service 
to New York City with trips to Pier 11 (on the East River at Wall Street) 
and East 35th Street in Manhattan.[216] Following the closure of the Marlboro 
Airport, Monmouth Executive Airport in Farmingdale, Old Bridge Airport 
and Mar Bar L Farms municipal airport supply short-distance flights to 
surrounding areas and are now the closest air transportation services. 
The closest major airport is Newark Liberty International Airport, which 
is 33.1 miles (53.3 km) (about 42 minutes drive) from the center of Marlboro 
Township. Marlboro Township is served by CentraState Healthcare System 
in Freehold Township, a 282-bed medical facility serving central Monmouth 
County. The next closest hospitals Raritan Bay Medical Center Old Bridge 
Division, located in Old Bridge Township and Bayshore Community Hospital, 
located in Holmdel Township. The closest major university hospitals are 
Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick and Jersey Shore 
University Medical Center in Neptune Township. The NJDEP lists 39 known 
locations of underground storage tank contamination in Marlboro Township.[217] 
Located off Tyler Lane and Spring Valley Road on the Old Bridge Township 
border, the area of Burnt Fly Bog in Marlboro Township is listed as a Superfund 
clean-up site. It is a rural area covering approximately 1,700 acres (6.9 km2), 
most of it in Marlboro Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. During the 
1950s and early 1960s, many unlined lagoons were used for storage of waste 
oil. As a result, at least 60 acres (240,000 m2) of the bog have been contaminated. 
In addition to the current contaminated area, the site still consists of: 
four lagoons; an approximately 13,000-cubic-yard mound of sludge; and an 
undetermined number of exposed and buried drums. The site is a ground water 
discharge area for the Englishtown Aquifer. In this bog, ground water, 
surface water, and air are contaminated by oil and various organic chemicals. 
Contaminants known to be present include ethylbenzene, methylene chloride, 
tetrachloroethylene, toluene, base neutral acids, metals, PAHs, PCBs, unknown 
liquid waste, and VOCs.[218] A number of studies have been mounted starting 
in 1981. At that time the EPA awarded a Cooperative Agreement and funds 
to New Jersey under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Early in 
1982, EPA used CERCLA funds to install a 900-foot (270 m) fence and repair 
a 6-foot (1.8 m) section of a dike. In 1983, the state completed (1) a 
field investigation to study the ground water, (2) a feasibility study 
for removal of contaminated soil and drums, and (3) a feasibility study 
for closing the site. EPA and the state continue negotiating agreements 
for further cleanup activities.[219] Up to the year 2003, 33,600 cubic 
yards or sedimentation, sludge and soil have been removed for disposal 
and incineration.[220] The area was then back filled with top soil. In 
June 2011 a 5-year review of the site was published. At that time the remediation 
status was complete as of date: 9/21/2004. Finally a fence has been installed 
around the entire site to restrict access and protect human health but 
has been breached in several locations. The downstream area was cleaned 
up to residential levels. It was recommended that the NJDEP continued monitoring 
off Site groundwater for five years. The final suggestion was "Since hazardous 
substances, pollutants or contaminants remain at the Site which do not 
allow for unlimited use or unrestricted exposure, in accordance with 40 
CFR 300.430 (f) (4) (ii), the remedial action for the Site shall be reviewed 
no less often than every five years. EPA will conduct another five-year 
review prior to June 2016."[221] This 15-acre (61,000 m2) part of land 
was owned by Imperial Oil Co./Champion Chemicals. The site was added to 
the National Priorities List of Superfund sites in 1983.[222] The site 
consists of six production, storage, and maintenance buildings and 56 above-ground 
storage tanks. Known contamination includes PCBs, arsenic, lead and total 
petroleum hydrocarbons. A number of companies may have been responsible 
for waste oil discharges and arsenical pesticides released to a nearby 
stream as industrial operations date back to 1912. The area is protected 
by a fence that completely encloses it. This site is being addressed through 
Federal and State actions. Mayor Hornik of Marlboro Township, described 
the polluted site as "one of the worst in the country."[223] In 1991, EPA 
excavated and disposed of an on-site waste filter clay pile. In 1997, EPA 
posted warning signs on the Henry Hudson Trail which is located near the 
site and the tarp covering the remaining waste filter clay pile was replaced 
to prevent human contact and limit the migration of the contamination. 
Arsenic and metals continued to be found in soils in the vicinity of this 
site.[224] In April 2002, EPA excavated and disposed of a 25-foot (7.6 m) 
by 25-foot (7.6 m) area of soil containing a tar-like material discovered 
outside of the fenced area. The presence of elevated levels of PCBs and 
lead in this material may have presented a physical contact threat to trespassers. 
In April 2004, 18,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil were removed from 
Birch Swamp Brook and adjacent properties. In August 2007, EPA arranged 
for 24-hour security at the site, given that Imperial Oil declared bankruptcy 
and ceased operations at the site during July 2007.[225] The EPA announced 
in 2009 the start-up of remediation activities for contaminated soils at 
the site now called "Operable Unit 3" (OU3). Marlboro Township has benefited 
from the $10–$25 million in stimulus funding to pay for the cost of this 
cleanup.[226] On May 3, 2012, the EPA held a press conference. The spokesman 
"Enck said a $50 million effort over 25 years has cleaned the property, 
removing 4,600 gallons of oil that pooled on the land, along with 30 million 
gallons of ground water and 180,000 cubic yards of soil." A total of $17 
million for the clean-up came from the federal Superfund program, with 
$33 million from the American Resource and Recovery Act.[227][228] Marlboro 
Middle School contamination issue was an issue which was handled by the 
state and local level. It was not a Superfund site. This field was an Angus 
bull farm prior to being donated to the town for school construction. During 
the soccer fields improvement program, tests were conducted at the soccer 
complex which showed elevated levels of unspecified contaminants. The Mayor 
closed the fields as soon as the test results came in. The township then 
applied for and received a grant to help with the remediation work. Marlboro 
received money from the Hazardous Discharge Site Remediation Fund to conduct 
soil remediation at the soccer fields.[229] This property clean-up is being 
handled through the NJEDA and is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. 
The site is located at the northeastern intersection of Route 79 and Beacon 
Hill Road. There were a total of 10 buildings on the site along with wooded 
areas. Investigations found the presence of a variety of unspecified environmental 
contaminants associated with the construction of rocket launcher parts. 
In addition, investigations included possible groundwater contamination 
on the property. There are no current known plans for clean-up, however, 
public hearings have been held to start the process of clean-up and redevelopment 
of the area.[230] Marlboro township was given a total of $200,000 in two 
different grants to complete remedial investigation of the site by the 
NJEDA.[231] The mayor has suggested it may take up to $5 million to clean 
up the land.[232] After a number of public hearings,[233] on July 14, 2011, 
a resolution was put forth authorizing the execution of the redevelopment 
agreement between The Township Of Marlboro And K-Land Corporation For The 
Property Known As Tax Block 132, Lot 18 (the Entron Industries site).[234] 
The developer suggested an investment of $100 million to clean up and develop 
the site.[235] The site is currently under redevelopment. K-land and Marlboro 
reached an agreement for the development of the Property to include 365 
residential units, thirty-three percent of which would be set aside as 
affordable units.[236] The Redeveloper created "Camelot at Marlboro".[237] 
This housing development has been completed and the property has been restored. 
The Arky property is a non-Superfund clean-up site with focus by the New 
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, located at 217 Route 520 
in Marlboro Township. This 22-acre (89,000 m2) site was an automobile junkyard. 
Contamination consisted of volatile organic compounds in the groundwater 
and soil contamination of metals, trichloroethylene (TCE), methyl tert-butyl 
ether (MTBE), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).[238] Initial clean-up 
consisted of removal of the contaminated soil. Also found were buried drums 
of unknown product. There were 22 drums removed. In 1998, NJDEP conducted 
a second drum removal action. They excavated 70 buried drums and removed 
some of the contaminated soil around the drums. The drums of hazardous 
wastes had been crushed and buried prior to 1987. To further monitor the 
property, NJDEP has installed additional monitor wells near the site to 
collect ground water samples. Investigations are continuing to determine 
if additional contamination is present on the site which would require 
clean-up actions.[239] This 77-acre (310,000 m2) property[240] was purchased 
by Marlboro Township under P.B. 938-05[241] for recreational uses, including 
walking-jogging trails, a playground area and a picnic grove area.[242] 
The property is located at Pleasant Valley and Conover roads. Clean-up 
is being handled through the NJEDA and is not considered a Superfund clean-up 
site. In 2004, Schoor DePalma[243] addressed the contaminated soil on the 
property. The soil on this property had widespread hazardous levels of 
arsenic, lead, pesticides and petroleum related contamination; consistent 
with farming related operations.[242] Additionally, the property contains 
a pond that is polluted with arsenic.[244] After clean-up, deep monitoring 
wells were created. In 2007, Birdsall Engineering investigated arsenic 
and pesticide contamination on the property. Two isolated hot spots were 
found with high levels of pesticides. The clean-up work was funded by the 
state farmland preservation program.[245] In 2008, Marlboro Township received 
state funds for continued clean-up and monitoring by the NJEDA.[246] This 
property is on the border of the land that formerly housed the Marlboro 
State Psychiatric Hospital. This presents its own possibilities, should 
the Township of Marlboro purchase the hospital property.[247] This site 
is being addressed through state and local department and funds and is 
not a superfund clean-up site. In 1997, the Monmouth County Park System 
bought 378 acres (1.53 km2) of the closed Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital 
land. The intent is to create a regional park, similar to Holmdel Park.[248] 
It is also expected to be home to part of the Henry Hudson Trail.[249] 
The plans for the property have not been completed, in part due to potential 
environmental contamination.[250] Preliminary environmental studies by 
Birdsall Engineering found asbestos and oil contamination on the grounds.[251] 
The land is contaminated with arsenic, reportedly a byproduct of farming.[252] 
In an attempt to further classify the contamination, the Luis Berger Group 
has done further testing on this site. They are reporting that the arsenic 
found on the site is "actually a naturally occurring condition in local 
and regional soil in this area". Additionally they reported that the site 
contamination found in the prior study was caused by a number of factors, 
including a former septic system (Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital discharged 
the effluent from the hospital into Big Brook[253]), pesticide mixing building, 
fuel oil underground storage tank, and construction debris. This evaluation 
made the following recommendations to the NJDEP: The site of the closed 
Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital has on-site contamination—it is not considered 
a Superfund clean-up site. Mayor Jonathan Hornik estimates it could cost 
more than $11 million to clean up. Mayor Jonathan Hornik stated that the 
state clearly has the responsibility for cleaning up the site. He however, 
stated that in the interest of getting it done, the township may have to 
show some flexibility in helping the state defray the costs.[254] In addition 
to the contamination on the site, the old buildings from the hospital are 
now in a state of decay and are being demolished. This site is being addressed 
through state and local funds and is not considered a Superfund clean-up 
site. The property is contaminated with an undisclosed substance. To clean 
up the contamination, 1,708 cubic yards of soil was removed. The site is 
located on Prescott Drive, Block 233 Lot 13.[255] Marlboro has two sister 
cities: Marlboro's first sister city, Nanto was formerly known as Jōhana 
(Nanto was formed after the merger of the towns of Fukuno, Inami and Jōhana). 
It was officially Marlboro's sister city in August 1991 as part of an agreement 
signed by mayor Saul Hornik with Johana's mayor.[256] Marlboro's second 
sister city, Wujiang[257] is an urban city in Jiangsu Province of southeast 
China. It has been regarded for "The Land of Rice and Fish" and "The Capital 
of Silk". It is recently known for being the "Capital of Electronics". 
Wujiang officially became a sister city with Marlboro in December 2011.[258]
