Claude Preston "Lefty" Williams (March 9, 1893 â€“ November 4, 1959) was 
an American pitcher in Major League Baseball. He is probably best known 
for his involvement in the 1919 World Series fix, known as the Black Sox 
scandal. Williams was born in Aurora, Missouri, to William and Mary Williams.[1] 
He began his major league career on September 17, 1913, with the Detroit 
Tigers. His breakthrough season came in 1915, while with the Salt Lake 
City Bees of the Pacific Coast League. That year, he pitched 418.2 innings, 
leading the league in wins (33) and strikeouts (294), while featuring mostly 
his mid-90s fastball and swooping curve. His contract was then purchased 
by the Chicago White Sox.[1] With the White Sox, Williams settled into 
the starting rotation and helped the team win the pennant in 1917, going 
17-8. After spending 1918 working in Navy shipyards, he came back strong 
in 1919 with his greatest performance, going 23-11 with a 2.64 earned run 
average. The White Sox again won the American League pennant. However, 
before that year's World Series, he got caught up in the Black Sox scandal 
when teammate Chick Gandil offered him $10,000 to lose his starts. Williams 
only received $5,000, half of what he was promised, but that was still 
almost double his 1919 salary of $2,600. In the series, Williams went 0-3, 
with an earned run average of 6.63. His three losses were a World Series 
record.[1] That was tied in the 1981 Series when George Frazier lost three 
games. Eight Men Out author Eliot Asinof wrote that Williams eventually 
turned against the fix as he prepared for his final Series start; Asinof 
later admitted that this particular anecdote was made-up.[1] In 1920, Williams 
went 22-14, but was caught up in the indictments handed down that autumn. 
Though acquitted by a jury, Williams and the seven other "Black Sox" were 
banned from organized baseball by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. 
Afterwards, Williams barnstormed and played in outlaw leagues for a few 
years,[2] and he played briefly for the Fort Bayard Veterans team in New 
Mexico which was part of the Copper League or Cactus League. He supposedly 
took to drinking heavily. It was reported that the between-inning "nips" 
made him an intimidating pitcher to the batters. Williams spent his later 
years in Laguna Beach, California, operating a garden nursery business. 
Williams would be portrayed by actor James Read in the 1988 film Eight
