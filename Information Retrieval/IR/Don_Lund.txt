Donald Andrew Lund (May 18, 1923 – December 10, 2013) was a backup outfielder 
in Major League Baseball who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers (1945, 1947, 
1948), St. Louis Browns (1948) and Detroit Tigers (1949–1954). He batted 
and threw right-handed. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Lund graduated from 
Detroit Southeastern High School and then attended the University of Michigan 
where he lettered in baseball, football and basketball.[1] He was signed 
out of the University of Michigan by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1945. Although 
drafted in the 1st round of the NFL draft in 1945 by the Chicago Bears 
as a running back, Lund felt baseball would be the better career choice. 
Used mainly as a reserve, he played part of three seasons with the Dodgers 
and St. Louis Browns between 1945 and 1948. His most productive season 
came in 1953 as the regular right fielder for the Detroit Tigers, when 
he posted career-highs in batting average (.257), home runs (nine), runs 
batted in (47), hits (108), at-bats (421), doubles (21), triples (four), 
and games played (131). On June 18, 1953, Lund made the final put-out in 
right field when Boston scored an MLB record 17 runs against the Tigers 
in one inning. He played his last season in 1954 as a backup for teenager 
rookie Al Kaline. In a seven-season career, Lund was a .240 hitter with 
15 home runs and 86 RBI in 281 games.[2] Following his major league career, 
Lund served as head baseball coach at the University of Michigan. Under 
his leadership, the Wolverines won the College World Series championship 
in 1962.[3] He also coached for the Tigers and was director of their farm 
system from 1963 through 1970.[4] Lund was inducted into the Michigan Hall 
of Honor in 1984 for his significant contributions as a football, baseball, 
and basketball player and baseball coach as well.[5] Lund was inducted 
into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.[6] In 2009, James Robert 
Irwin wrote a book about the life of Don Lund, "Playing Ball with Legends: 
The Story and the Stories of Don Lund." He died on December 10, 2013 at
