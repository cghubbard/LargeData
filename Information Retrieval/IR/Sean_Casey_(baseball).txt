Sean Thomas Casey (born July 2, 1974),[1] nicknamed "The Mayor," is a former 
Major League Baseball first baseman for the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati 
Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates, Detroit Tigers, and Boston Red Sox. Casey was 
selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game three times during 
his career.[2][3] He is currently a broadcaster and commentator for the 
MLB Network.[4] Casey attended Upper St. Clair High School in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, and graduated from the University of Richmond, where he was 
a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. His .461 batting average 
in 1995 led all Division I players.[5] He was drafted in 1995 in the second 
round by the Cleveland Indians and was traded to the Cincinnati Reds before 
the 1998 season. On April 3, 1998, Casey was hit in the eye with a ball 
thrown by teammate Damian Jackson during batting practice, resulting in 
a fractured eye orbit, and subsequent surgery.[6] Casey had his best year 
in 1999 hitting .332 with 25 home runs and 99 runs batted in (RBIs) and 
103 runs scored in 151 games. In 1999, he won the Hutch Award. During his 
tenure in Cincinnati, and later in Pittsburgh and Detroit, Sean Casey was 
regarded as approachable and friendly, and his nickname, "the Mayor," comes 
from his reputation for chatting casually with every runner who makes it 
to first base, and from his very public charity work. It was frequently 
expanded to "the Mayor of Riverfront" when the Reds played at Riverfront 
Stadium. On May 16, 2007, Casey was voted in 2007 as "the friendliest player 
in baseball" by fellow players in a Sports Illustrated poll.[7] He garnered 
46% of the vote with the second place vote being split between Jim Thome 
and Mike Sweeney with only 7% each. Casey is also regarded as among the 
slowest-running players in the game, grounding into 27 double plays in 
the 2005 season. This tied him with A. J. Pierzynski for the record of 
most grounding in double plays by a National League left hander in a season.[8] 
Sean Casey was signed to the Reds through the 2006 season. However, he 
was traded December 6, 2005, to his hometown Pittsburgh Pirates for left-handed 
pitcher Dave Williams. During an injury plagued 2006 season, Casey hit 
.296 with three home runs and 29 RBIs in 59 games for the Pirates. On July 
31, 2006, Casey was traded to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitcher 
Brian Rogers. During the 2006 American League Championship Series against 
the Oakland Athletics he partially tore his left calf muscle in Game 1.[9] 
After coming back from his torn calf in Game 2 of the World Series, he 
became the hottest hitter for the Tigers, belting two home runs and batting 
.432 in five games. His .432 batting average was one of the best in Tigers 
postseason history.[10] He has been active in Big Brothers and Make-A-Wish 
Foundation, as well as the "Casey's Crew" program, where he provided free 
high-priced tickets to disadvantaged youth.[11] Casey credits his Christian 
upbringing in Pittsburgh's affluent Upper St. Clair suburb for his generosity.[12] 
After being told by Dave Dombrowski and Jim Leyland that he would not be 
re-signed, Casey still praised Mike Ilitch, Dombrowski, and Jim Leyland 
for giving him the opportunity to come play for Detroit. Casey said "They 
let me know. I've had a great time with this team, the greatest year and 
a half of my career. It was great. But I understand the situation."[13] 
On February 5, 2008, the Boston Red Sox announced they had signed Casey 
to a one-year deal.[14] On April 9, 2008, Red Sox third baseman Mike Lowell 
injured his thumb and was then placed on the DL, first baseman Kevin Youkilis 
was moved to third, and Casey stepped in as the starting first baseman[15] 
and exploded by making some good defensive plays and hitting .318 with 
five RBIs in his first seven games despite missing games in Japan due to 
Southern League Neck. He was on the disabled list from April 26 through 
12 May, and returned as a significant part-time player, finishing the regular 
season with a .773 OPS on 199 at-bats in 69 games. Casey was suspended 
by the MLB for three games after his actions in the Coco Crispâ€“James Shields 
brawl.[16] Casey announced his retirement on January 25, 2009, at the age 
of 34, having played 12 seasons of Major League Baseball. He currently 
serves as a baseball analyst for MLB Network.[17] On July 3, 2009, he sat 
in for Red Sox color commentator Jerry Remy, calling the first game for 
his old team. On January 14, 2011, the Reds announced that Casey would 
do color commentary for 15 telecasts on Fox Sports Ohio during the 2011 
season.[18] On June 23, 2012, Casey was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds 
Hall of Fame and Museum. With Conan O'Brien, Casey is a founder of Labels 
Are For Jars,[21] an innovative anti-hunger organization based in Lawrence, 
Massachusetts. In a May 16, 2007, Sports Illustrated Player's Poll,[22] 
Casey won the distinction of being considered the "friendliest player in 
baseball", after winning 46% of the votes. 464 MLB players participated 
in the survey. Hal McCoy, a Cincinnati Reds beat writer for 35 years, has 
said, "There's no debate, and there never will be a debate. Sean Casey 
is the nicest guy in professional baseball. Ever." On August 26, 2008, 
Sean Casey was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. 
On January 29, 2009, Casey was inducted into the Kinston Professional Baseball 
Hall of Fame. Casey was inducted to the Cincinnati Reds Baseball Hall of 
Fame (along with Dan Driessen and John Reilly) on June 23, 2012. In 2014,
