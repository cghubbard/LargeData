Joseph Anthony Foy (February 21, 1943 â€“ October 12, 1989) was a Major League 
Baseball third baseman. Born in New York City, Foy was signed as an amateur 
free agent by the Minnesota Twins in 1962, but was selected in that year's 
minor league draft by the Boston Red Sox. Playing for the Toronto Maple 
Leafs in the International League in 1965, Foy was voted the league's Most 
Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year. He also won the league's batting 
title, hitting .302. His first year in the majors, with Boston in 1966, 
was arguably his best season. Foy batted a solid .262, drew the second-most 
walks in the American League (91), had a .364 on-base percentage, good 
for eighth in the junior circuit; he also scored 97 runs, fifth in the 
league. As pitching became more dominant in the late 1960s, Foy's numbers 
dropped considerably. In 1967, while receiving over 100 fewer at-bats, 
Foy batted a slightly worse .251/.325/.426 (his walk total halved), although 
the league did drop by 4 batting points, 2 on-base points, and 18 slugging 
points. On a positive note, Foy set a career-high for home runs with 16. 
In 1968, the infamous "Year Of The Pitcher" (when Carl Yastrzemski led 
the league with a .301 batting average, and the American League batted 
just .230), Foy did well at the plate. While his raw stats (.225/.336/.326) 
seemed unimpressive, his on-base percentage was 39 points above the league 
average, and his slugging and batting averages were roughly the same as 
the league average. He stole 26 bases that year and drew 84 walks. The 
Red Sox left Foy unprotected in the 1968 expansion draft. The Kansas City 
Royals selected him with the fourth pick. He had a fine season in 1969. 
While the league still only batted .246/.321/.369, Foy's numbers were .262/.354/.370. 
He also had 71 runs batted in, his career-high. Then, in a move considered 
by some to be one of the best trades in Royals history, Kansas City traded 
Foy to the third baseman-hungry Mets for Amos Otis and Bob Johnson. Otis 
developed into an All-Star, and an occasional MVP candidate. The Royals 
then traded Johnson the following year, after a 200 strikeout season, to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates for shortstop Fred Patek, who became another cornerstone 
of their rising franchise. Foy posted a career-best .373 OBP while hitting 
.236/.373/.329 with 6 home runs and 37 RBI in 322 at-bats with New York. 
His best day as a Met, and perhaps of his entire career, came on July 19, 
1970 when he went 5-for-5 with a double, two home runs, and five runs batted 
in as the Mets beat the Giants, 7-6, in 10 innings at San Francisco. Although 
his averages were not that far off from his career average, Foy was considered 
a disappointment to Mets fans. Additionally, according to Mets pitcher 
Jerry Koosman, Foy fell under the influence of his old friends in the Bronx. 
In the first game of one doubleheader, Koosman and others thought he was 
high on some kind of drug (eventually confirmed to be marijuana), especially 
when he walked in front of manager Gil Hodges in the dugout during a pitch 
and started cheering. Still, Hodges started him at third base in the second 
game. The first batter hit a hard ground ball by Foy. He never even saw 
it, but even after it went by him, he kept punching his glove and yelling, 
"Hit it to me, hit it to me." Koosman and others all wanted Foy out right 
then, but according to Koosman, Hodges left Foy in the game just a little 
longer to show that he didn't fit on the team. After the season, the Mets 
left him off the roster, and the Washington Senators drafted him in the 
Rule 5 draft.[1] Foy was only an average batter with the Senators batting 
.234/.363/.297 in 128 at-bats. He was sent to the minors in May. After 
batting .191 in 15 games,[1] he was released on July 16, 1971 and never 
played another professional game. Foy died of a heart attack on October
