As player As manager Charles Columbus "Count" Campau (October 17, 1863 
– April 3, 1938) was an American professional baseball player whose career 
spanned the years 1885 to 1905. He played two seasons in Major League Baseball 
as an outfielder for the Detroit Wolverines in 1888 and St. Louis Browns 
in 1890 and two games for the Washington Senators in July 1894. He was 
the American Association's home run leader in 1890 and was also the Browns' 
manager for 41 games that season. Campau was also a player and sometimes 
a manager in minor league baseball for 19 years, including stints with 
the New Orleans Pelicans (1887, 1892–94, 1903), Kansas City Blues (1888, 
1896, 1898), Detroit Tigers/Wolverines (1889–90, 1894–95), Seattle Yannigans/Rainmakers 
(1896), Grand Rapids Bob-o-links (1897), Rochester Bronchos (1899–1900), 
and Binghamton Bingoes (1901, 1903–05). Although minor league records from 
the 1880s and 1890s are incomplete, Campau is known to have tallied at 
least 2,115 hits, 1,305 runs, 597 stolen bases, 157 triples, and 125 home 
runs in his minor league career.[1] Charles Columbus Campau was born in 
Detroit in 1863.[2] He was a descendant of the French-Canadian Campau family 
that was among the founders of the City of Detroit.[3] Like other members 
of his family, Campau was educated at Notre Dame (in the 19th century, 
Notre Dame included primary as well as college education).[3] Campau stated 
that he first played baseball while attending Notre Dame in 1875, at which 
time he would have been 11 years old.[4] After leaving Notre Dame, Campau 
helped Detroit's Cass Club team win several Michigan championships.[4] 
Campau's success as a baseball player is largely attributed to two talents: 
power and speed. He is probably most referenced in baseball's record books 
for having won the American Association's home run championship in 1890. 
Although minor records from the 1880s and 1890s are incomplete, he hit 
at least 135 home runs in his professional baseball career, including a 
high of 20 home runs in 1894.[1][2] This he accomplished during a deadball 
era before the home run became a major offensive weapon in baseball. His 
power was surprising, too, given his slight build at 5 feet, 11 inches, 
and 160 pounds.[2] In its obituary of Campau, the 1939 Spalding Guide wrote 
that, despite his slight build, Campau "seemed to get extraordinary power 
from his wrists and arms".[5] Although less well reported, Campau also 
played the game with exceptional speed. While records were not kept for 
stolen bases during some of his minor league seasons, Campau is known to 
have stolen at least 660 bases during his career, including 100 stolen 
bases in 1887.[1][2] According to at least one account, Campau and two 
other players held the world record for the fastest time, 14 seconds, in 
rounding the bases on a baseball diamond.[6] In 1891, Campau began competing 
for money in foot races against other players and never lost a race.[4] 
In a race against Tom Messitt, Campau won with a time of 11 seconds.[7] 
The best evidence of Campau's speed and base-running intelligence may lie 
in a 1906 historical account by sportswriter Revere Rodgers. In an article 
on remarkable incidents in baseball history, Rodgers wrote that Campau 
once scored a home run on an infield pop-up.[8] According to Rodgers, Campau 
hit a high pop fly about 10 feet (3.0 m) in front of home plate. The pitcher 
and catcher converged on the ball, but in what was described by Rodgers 
as "an Alphonse and Gaston act", no one took control. Campau saw their 
confusion and rounded first base. The ball fell between them, took a "sudden 
twist", and rolled into foul territory. Campau kept running and crossed 
home plate one foot ahead of the player with the ball.[8] Campau began 
his professional baseball career with the Erie, Pennsylvania team in the 
Interstate League. Campau later recalled that he had caught "western fever" 
and planned to travel west, but he remained in Detroit until Al Buckenberger, 
a prominent Detroit baseball man, secured a post as the manager in Erie 
and advised Campau to head east with him. Campau joined Buckenberger in 
Erie for the 1884 season and helped lead Erie to the Interstate League 
pennant.[4][9] In 1885, Buckenberger was hired as the manager of an independent 
baseball team in Guelph, Ontario, and Campau followed him there. The following 
year, Camapu played for a team in London, Ontario that won the Canadian 
championship in 1886.[4] In 1887, Campau signed with Charlie Morton, who 
had managed the Detroit Wolverines in 1885 and was in 1887 the manager 
of the Savannah, Georgia team in the Southern League. Campau joined Morton 
in Savannah, but the team disbanded in June 1887.[4] Before the collapse, 
Campau appeared in 29 games for Savannah and compiled a .379 batting average 
with five doubles, six triples, three home runs, and 17 stolen bases.[1] 
After the Savannah team collapsed, Campau joined the New Orleans Pelicans 
mid-season. In 84 games with New Orleans in the second half of the 1887 
season, Campau compiled a .398 batting average and .626 slugging percentage 
with 19 doubles, 12 triples, 14 home runs and 83 stolen bases. Combining 
his season totals from Savannah and New Orleans, Campau stole 100 bases 
and had 59 extra base hits (17 of them home runs).[1] With Campau's help, 
New Orleans won the Southern Association pennant. Campau's best game in 
New Orleans was on June 7, 1887, when he hit three home runs in one game.[3] 
He later recalled his favorable treatment by the fans in New Orleans: "I 
will say that my luck commenced from this city. I was kindly treated by 
the people. I had the pleasant experience of having $90 thrown to me from 
the grand stand for making three home runs."[4] After his outstanding performance 
in Savannah and New Orleans, Campau had an opportunity to sign with Philadelphia, 
but he later recalled that he did not think he was "strong enough" and 
accepted an offer from Jim Manning, manager of the Kansas City team in 
the Class A Western Association.[4] Campau appeared in 42 games for Kansas 
City, compiling a .227 batting average but showed great speed with seven 
triples and 17 stolen bases.[1] Kansas City released Campau in June 1888, 
and he then signed with the Detroit Wolverines, a team that had won the 
National League pennant in 1887 but had lost its star right fielder, Sam 
Thompson, to injury. Campau made his major league debut on July 7, 1888, 
and appeared in 70 games in the outfield for Detroit. Campau proved to 
be a capable defensive replacement, compiling a .933 fielding percentage 
(16 points higher that the National League average) and contributing 10 
outfield assists and 3 double plays.[2] At the plate, Campau's major league 
debut was less auspicious as he compiled a .203 batting average. His speed 
continued to help his cause, as he stole 27 bases and had three triples 
and a home run.[2] His 27 stolen bases led the team, and he was the recipient 
of a prize from a local business as the team's leading base-runner.[10] 
Campau later expressed his gratitude to Detroit first baseman Dan Brouthers 
who he recalled was "like a father to me" in Campau's first major league 
season.[4] At the end of the 1888 season, the Detroit Wolverines left the 
National League, and most of the players were sold to other clubs. A new 
Detroit Wolverines team was formed for the 1889 as part of the International 
League. Campau joined the new Detroit club, appeared in 111 games in left 
field and stole 69 bases.[1] The 1889 Detroit club was, according to Campau, 
"one of the greatest minor league teams gathered" and "won the flag so 
easy that fans stopped going out to see the games."[4] Campau began the 
1890 season in Detroit. He appeared in 39 games, primarily in right field, 
and compiled a .310 batting average with three home runs.[1] After beginning 
the 1890 season with Detroit, Campau returned to the major leagues with 
the St. Louis Browns of the American Association. He appeared in 75 games 
for the Browns, all but one in the outfield. Campau led the league with 
nine home runs and was among the league leaders with a .513 slugging percentage 
(2nd), .322 batting average (9th), 12 triples (8th), and 75 RBIs (9th). 
He also stole 36 bases, contributing to his having the best sabermetric 
power-speed number in the league.[2] During the month of July, Campau established 
a major league record (still intact) with 15 consecutive multi-hit games. 
In July 1890, Campau was named player-manager. In late July, team owner 
Chris von der Ahe praised Campau as "the best captain I have ever had", 
"a general on the field and a gentleman off of it."[11] Camapu compiled 
a 27-14 record as the team's manager but was stripped of the title in late 
August.[3] According to an account published at the time in the Sporting 
Life, Campau took seriously his responsibility to look after the players 
while they were off the field. He stayed up late, watching over the club, 
and fined several players heavily for violations of the rules. The fines 
caused dissent, and ultimately Campau's "resignation was asked for, more 
to make peace in the family than anything else."[12] At least one baseball 
writer perceived the unfairness of von der Ahe's removing Campau for enforcing 
rules established by von der Ahe: "There is gratitude for you. Von der 
Ahe tells his manager to do certain things and because he does it he is 
humiliated by being removed and a more 'agreeable' man put in his place. 
I know Charley Campau, and a bigger-hearted or more honorable man never 
lived."[13] Shortly after being removed as manager, Campau hit an inside-the-park 
grand slam against the first-place Louisville Colonels that prompted a 
tremendous show of support from the St. Louis crowd. When Campau stepped 
to the plate a fan called out for a home run, and Campau smiled and complied. 
A fan threw a cigar to Campau, and "then the fun commenced."[12] The crowd 
of 13,000 showed their appreciation as it "rained cigars steadily for ten 
minutes. Long ones, short ones, thin ones, thick ones, good ones and bad 
ones were all mixed up on the grass together." Campau joked that he would 
pack them away and start a store of his own.[12] After the season ended, 
St. Louis team owner von der Ahe released Campau in an attempt to cut costs, 
leading the Sporting Life to write: "The St. Louis Club has released that 
excellent player, Count Campau, to reduce expenses. Von der Ahe can't reach 
first place now, and is cutting off his highest salaried men. With Fuller, 
McCarthy and others missing next year, he'll regret letting such a man 
as Campau go."[14] Three weeks later, Campau announced that he had secured 
a job as a brakeman with the Michigan Central Railroad.[15] Campau returned 
to the minor leagues in 1891. He spent the season as player/manager of 
the Troy Trojans in the Eastern Association.[4] In 122 games for Troy, 
Campau hit .236 with 18 doubles, 10 triples, three home runs and 45 stolen 
bases.[1] Although he had already shown great speed (100 stolen bases in 
1887), Campau wrote that it was while playing at Troy that he "developed 
as a fast runner", often competing in foot races against other players. 
Campau recalled that he won all his races and backed himself in bets on 
the races.[4] In 1892, he signed with Gus Schmelz to play for the Columbus 
Reds and won the Western League championship.[4] In 46 games for Columbus, 
he hit .262 with eight doubles, seven triples, two home runs and 35 RBIs.[1] 
In November 1892, Campau entered the fray in the debate over moving the 
pitcher's box. Campau sided with those advocating moving the pitcher back 
by five feet. Campau argued that batting averages had suffered and that 
moving the pitcher back would "electrify" the crowds and "enliven" the 
game with more hitting.[16] Campau's side prevailed, and the pitcher's 
box was moved back for the 1893 season. In 1893, Campau was back in New 
Orleans with the Pelicans. In 96 games, he hit .337 and scored 98 runs.[1] 
In 1894, Campau returned to his hometown of Detroit, this time playing 
for the Detroit Tigers in the Western League.[2] He also appeared in two 
games in the major leagues in July 1894 season for the Washington Senators,[2] 
but spent most of the 1894 season with the Detroit club. He remained in 
Detroit for two seasons and had one of the best seasons of his career in 
1895. That year, he hit .359, scored 115 runs and had 40 doubles, seven 
triples, 13 home runs and 44 stolen bases.[1] In 1896, Campau moved to 
the west coast as the player/manager of the Seattle Yannigans/Rainmakers 
in the New Pacific League. In 32 games at Seattle, Campau had career highs 
in batting average (.403) and slugging percentage (.887) with 55 runs, 
13 home runs and 19 stolen bases.[1] The league folded before the season 
ended, and Campau was the league leader in slugging percentage, runs and 
home runs.[3] Campau returned in 1897 to the Western League with the Grand 
Rapids Bob-o-links. He batted .303 in 130 games, scored 109 runs, and had 
26 doubles, 10 triples, 12 home runs and 25 stolen bases.[1] In 1898, Campau 
was reunited with Gus Schmelz, who was then managing the Minneapolis Millers. 
He was released by Minneapolis in June and immediately signed with Charles 
Comiskey, owner of the St. Paul Apostles. He played only two months at 
St. Paul before he was released and then signed by the Kansas City Blues. 
Kansas City won the Western League championship that year. Campau's fielding 
error in the second game of the three-game championship series nearly cost 
Kansas City the championship. Campau later recalled that the costly error 
occurred when the sun was directly in his eyes in right field, and he had 
not even seen the ball until it was past him.[4] In 1899, Campau was reunited 
with his first manager, Al Buckenberger. Buckenberger had taken over as 
manager of the Rochester Bronchos and persuaded Campau to play for him. 
Campau played the 1899 and 1900 seasons in Rochester, appearing in 243 
games, scoring 164 runs and stealing 61 bases.[1] In 1901, Campau became 
a player/manager for the Binghamton, New York team in the New York State 
League. In 1902, he led Binghamton to a disputed pennant. At the end of 
the season, Binghamton was ahead in a tight pennant race, but the Albany 
team played and won an extra, unscheduled game and thereupon claimed it 
had won the pennant.[17] With the exception of 64 games with the New Orleans 
club in 1903, Campau spent the rest of his career at Binghamton, finally 
retiring after the 1905 season.[1] His brief excursion to New Orleans in 
1903, however, resulted in a lawsuit by the Binghamton team seeking to 
enjoin him from playing for the Pelicans. He was lured to sign with New 
Orleans with a promise of part ownership of the club.[18] The Binghamton 
team alleged that, although there was not a signed contract, it had personal 
letters from Campau agreeing to manage the team in 1903.[19] In the end, 
Campau played nine games for New Orleans in 1903 and returned to Binghamton 
for the 1904 and 1905 seasons.[1] In December 1905, after his playing career 
ended, Campau signed to become an umpire in the Eastern League.[20] He 
was released by the Eastern League and hired by the Southern League. In 
August 1906, he was attacked by "an angry army of fans" during a game in 
Memphis, Tennessee. Three fans were arrested, but then released "when no 
one appeared to prosecute them". Campau initially announced he would be 
tendering his resignation shortly after his escape, but reconsidered and 
reported for his umpiring assignment the next day.[21] It is unknown how 
many more games Campau umpired, but his umpiring career ended in 1906.[3] 
After his baseball career ended, Campau became involved in the horse racing 
business. Between 1906 and 1910, he handled the finances of horse racing 
tracks in Texas, Havana, Seattle, Jacksonville, Florida, and Salt Lake 
City.[6] He later moved to New Orleans, where he worked as a "clerk of 
scales and placing judge" at local race tracks.[3] Campau died in New Orleans
