The Intermediate League World Series is a baseball tournament for children 
aged 11 to 13 years old that began in 2013. It is patterned after the Little 
League World Series, which was named for the World Series in Major League 
Baseball. Currently the tournament is held in Livermore, California. The 
Intermediate division is the second of five Little League divisions by 
development. The pitching mound is 50 feet from home plate, and the base 
paths are 70 feet apart. This allows for a transition between the smaller 
field dimensions of Little League (46/60), and the standard field dimensions 
of the advanced leagues (60.5/90).[1] Unlike the Little League World Series 
— which has sixteen regions (eight in the U.S. and eight international) 
— the Intermediate League World Series has only ten regions, plus a host 
team. The regional champions are divided into Pool A (U.S.) and Pool B 
(International). The teams advance to the semi-finals via a modified double 
elimination format; the semifinal and final are single elimination. Teams 
that lose their first two games face off in classification games. Pool 
A (U.S.) consists of five regions + the host team Pool B (International)
