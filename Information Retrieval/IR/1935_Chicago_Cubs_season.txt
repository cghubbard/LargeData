The 1935 Chicago Cubs season was the 64th season for the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 60th in the National League and the 20th at Wrigley Field. The season 
saw the Cubs finish with 100 wins for the first time in 25 years; they 
would not win 100 games in another season until 2016. The Cubs won their 
14th National League pennant in team history and faced the Detroit Tigers 
in the World Series, but lost in six games. The 1935 season is largely 
remembered for the Cubs' 21-game winning streak. The streak began on September 
4 with the Cubs 2.5 games out of first place. They would not lose again 
until September 28. The streak propelled the Cubs to the National League 
pennant. The 21-game winning streak tied the franchise and major league 
record set in 1880 when they were known as the Chicago White Stockings. 
Gabby Hartnett was the first National League catcher to win the MVP Award.[1]
