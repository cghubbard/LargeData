Charles Everett Tilson (born December 2, 1992) is an American professional 
baseball center fielder for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Tilson attended New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois.[1] 
He played both baseball and football.[2] As a senior, he was the Illinois 
Gatorade Baseball Player of the Year.[3][4] The St. Louis Cardinals selected 
Tilson in the second round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft.[5][6][7] 
He signed with the Cardinals rather than play college baseball at the University 
of Illinois.[8][9] Tilson made his professional debut that season with 
the Gulf Coast Cardinals and also played for the Johnson City Cardinals. 
He missed the 2012 due to an injury to his shoulder.[10] He returned in 
2013 to play in 109 games for the Peoria Chiefs and Palm Beach Cardinals.[11] 
He batted .302/.352/.388 with four home runs. Tilson returned to Palm Beach 
in 2014. In July he was promoted to the Double-A Springfield Cardinals.[12][13] 
In 120 games, he hit .289/.333/.389 with seven home runs. Tilson started 
the 2015 season with the Springfield Cardinals of the Texas League. He 
was a mid-season All-Star selection with a .288 average, seven doubles, 
four triples with 11 RBI and 36 run scored. Further, he had hit streaks 
of eight and 12 games.[14] The Cardinals added him to their 40-man roster 
after the season.[15] On July 31, 2016, the Cardinals traded Tilson to 
the Chicago White Sox for relief pitcher Zach Duke.[16] He made his MLB 
debut against the Detroit Tigers on August 2, and got his first major league 
hit, single, in his first MLB at bat against Aníbal Sánchez.[17] He strained 
his left hamstring during the game, and went on the disabled list.[18]
