Richard Allen Bosman (born February 17, 1944) is an American former Major 
League Baseball right-handed pitcher. He pitched for the Washington Senators 
(1966–71), Texas Rangers (1972–73), Cleveland Indians (1973–75) and Oakland 
Athletics (1975–76).[1] Bosman started the final game for the expansion 
Senators and the first game for the Texas Rangers. He is the only pitcher 
in Major League history to miss a perfect game due to his own fielding 
error.[2] Bosman was originally signed as an amateur free agent by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates in 1963. Following that season, he was drafted from 
the Pirates by the San Francisco Giants, and then a year later was drafted 
again by the Senators.[3] After another season in the minors, he made his 
major league debut on June 1, 1966. Bosman pitched for the Senators, and 
later the Rangers, for eight seasons. In 1969 he compiled a 14-5 mark and 
led the league in earned run average (2.19). He reached a career-high 16 
victories in 1970, one of which was a one-hit, 1-0 shutout against Minnesota 
on August 14. César Tovar gave him the Twins only hit, a single.[4] Early 
in the 1973 season, Bosman was traded by the Rangers, along with outfielder 
Ted Ford, to the Indians for pitcher Steve Dunning. On July 19, 1974, Bosman 
no-hit the defending World Series Champion Oakland Athletics, a team that 
would go on to win the 1974 World Series to three-peat after winning the 
World Series in 1972 and 1973. He missed a rare perfect game due only to 
his own throwing error in the fourth inning, which gave the A's their lone 
baserunner in a 4-0 Indians victory.[5] The following season, Bosman would 
be traded to the very team he no-hit, as he was traded by the Indians along 
with Jim Perry to the A's in exchange for Blue Moon Odom. During the 1975 
season, Bosman won 11 games to help Oakland to a division title. He remained 
with Oakland in 1976, but was released by the A's in spring training of 
1977, bringing his baseball career to an end. Bosman compiled 82 wins, 
757 strikeouts, and a 3.67 earned run average.[1][6] After retiring, he 
has served as a pitching coach for the Chicago White Sox (1986–87), Rochester 
Red Wings (1988–91), Baltimore Orioles (1992–94), Texas Rangers (1995–2000), 
and he has been a coach in the Tampa Bay Rays' system since 2002. His sister,
