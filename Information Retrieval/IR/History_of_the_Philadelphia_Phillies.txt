The history of the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball's National 
League is a long and varied one. The Phillies are based in Philadelphia, 
and are a member of the National League East division. Since 2004, the 
team's home has been Citizens Bank Park in the South Philadelphia section 
of the city. The franchise has won two World Series championships (against 
Kansas City in 1980, Tampa Bay in 2008), and seven National League pennants. 
After replacing the Worcesters in 1883, the franchise made its first post-season 
appearance in 1915, losing to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. The 
Phillies franchise also has the second-longest streak of consecutive losing 
seasons in American professional sports, sixteen straight from 1933 to 
1948;[1] the record stood until 2009, when it was broken by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. After another National League pennant in 1950, the Phillies did 
not return to the post-season until 1976, beginning a period of extended 
success for the franchise. Compared to the team's early days, the Phillies 
have recently been more successful than not, with two such periods: the 
first from 1975 to 1983, when they won five East Division championships 
as well as the first-half championship in the strike-shortened 1981 season,[2] 
and the second starting in 2001, with a winning percentage of .534 in those 
eight seasons, finishing above .500 in all but one, and making the playoffs 
from 2007 through 2011. In its 127-season history, the franchise has employed 
51 managers and 10 general managers (GMs).[3][4] Dallas Green and Charlie 
Manuel are the only Phillies managers to win a World Series: Green in 1980, 
and Manuel in 2008. Manuel is also the only Phillies manager to win two 
pennants,[5] and on the last day of the 2011 regular season, surpassed 
Gene Mauch's 644-win record as the winningest manager in franchise history, 
taking two fewer seasons than Mauch to accomplish that feat. The longest-tenured 
general manager is Paul Owens, with 11 years of service to the team as 
the general manager, from 1972 to 1983.[4] Owens also served as the team 
manager in 1972, and from 1983 to 1984.[3] After this time, he served as 
a team executive until 2003, and was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball 
Wall of Fame in recognition of his services.[6] The manager with the highest 
winning percentage over a full season or more was Arthur Irwin, whose .575 winning 
percentage is fourth on the all-time wins list for Phillies managers.[3] 
In 1883, sporting goods manufacturer Al Reach (a pioneering professional 
baseball player) and attorney John Rogers won an expansion National League 
franchise for Philadelphia, one of what are now known as the "Classic Eight" 
of the National League. They were awarded a spot in the league to replace 
the Worcester Brown Stockings, a franchise that had folded in 1882. The 
new team was nicknamed the "Quakers", and immediately compiled a .173 winning 
percentage, which is still the worst in franchise history. Although many 
sources (including the Phillies themselves) claim that Reach and Rogers 
bought the Brown Stockings and moved them to Philadelphia, all available 
evidence suggests this is not the case. Significantly, no players from 
Worcester[7] ended up with the 1883 Quakers.[8] In 1884, Harry Wright, 
the former manager of baseball's first openly professional team, the Cincinnati 
Red Stockings, was recruited as manager in hopes of reversing the team's 
fortunes. Also in 1884, the team changed its name to the "Philadelphias", 
as it was common for baseball teams in that era to be named after their 
cities (for instance, the "Bostons" and "New Yorks"). However, as "Philadelphias" 
was somewhat hard to fit in newspaper headlines, some writers still continued 
to call them the "Quakers" while others began shortening the name to "Phillies."[9] 
At some point in the 1880s, the team accepted the shorter nickname "Phillies" 
as an official nickname. "Quakers" continued to be used interchangeably 
with "Phillies" until 1890, when the team officially became known as the 
"Phillies." This name is one of the longest continually used nicknames 
in professional sports by a team in the same city.[10] In 1887, they began 
play at the stadium eventually known as Baker Bowl. Despite a general improvement 
from their dismal beginnings, they never seriously contended for the title. 
The standout players of franchise in the era were Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, 
and Ed Delahanty, who in 1896 set the major-league record (since tied by 
several others) with 4 home runs in a single game. Due to growing disagreements 
about the direction of the team, Reach sold his interest to Rogers in 1899.[9] 
With the birth of the more lucrative American League in 1901, the Phillies 
saw many of their better players defect to the upstart, including a number 
of players who ended up playing for their crosstown rivals, the Athletics, 
owned by former Phillies minority owner Benjamin Shibe. While their former 
teammates throve (the AL's first five batting champions were former Phillies), 
the remaining squad fared dismally, finishing 46 games out of first place 
in 1902—the first of three straight years finishing either seventh or eighth. 
To add tragedy to folly, a balcony collapsed during a game at the Baker 
Bowl in 1903, killing twelve and injuring hundreds. Rogers was forced to 
sell the Phillies to avoid being ruined by an avalanche of lawsuits.[9] 
The Phillies won their first pennant in 1915 thanks to the pitching of 
Grover Cleveland Alexander and the batting prowess of Gavvy Cravath, who 
set the major-league single-season record for home runs with 24. However, 
by 1917 Alexander had been traded away when owner William Baker refused 
to increase his salary. Baker was known for running the Phillies very cheaply; 
for instance, during much of his tenure there was only one scout in the 
entire organization. The effect of the Alexander trade was immediate. In 
1918, only three years after winning the pennant, the Phillies finished 
sixth, thirteen games under .500. It was the start of one of the longest 
streaks of futility in baseball history. From 1918 to 1948, the Phillies 
had only one winning record (78–76 in 1932), only finished higher than 
sixth twice, and were never a serious factor past June. During this stretch, 
they finished last a total of 17 times and next to last seven times. This 
saddled the franchise with a reputation for failure that dogged it for 
many years. For instance, a 1962 cartoon in a baseball magazine depicted 
a ballplayer arriving at a French Foreign Legion outpost, explaining, "I 
was released by the Phillies!" The team's primary stars during the 1920s 
and 1930s were outfielders Cy Williams, Lefty O'Doul, and Chuck Klein, 
who captured the vaunted Triple Crown in 1933. Unfortunately, Philadelphia's 
cozy Baker Bowl proved to be a fertile hitting ground for Phillies opponents 
as well, and in 1930, the team surrendered 1199 runs, a major-league record 
still standing today. Baker died in 1930. He left half his estate to his 
wife and the other half to longtime team secretary Mae Mallen. Five years 
earlier, Mallen had married leather goods and shoe dealer Gerald Nugent. 
With the support of Baker's widow, Nugent became team president. Baker's 
widow died in 1932, leaving Nugent in complete control.[9] Unlike Baker, 
Nugent badly wanted to build a winning team. However, he didn't have the 
financial means to do so. He was forced to trade what little talent the 
team had to make ends meet, and often had to use some creative financial 
methods to even field a team at all.[11] One problem was Baker Bowl. Once 
considered one of the finest parks in baseball, it was not well maintained 
from the 1910s onward. For instance, until 1925 the Phillies used a flock 
of sheep to trim the grass. Fans were often showered with rust whenever 
one of Klein's home runs hit girders. The entire right field grandstand 
collapsed in 1926, forcing the Phillies to move to the A's Shibe Park (five 
blocks west on Lehigh Avenue from Baker Bowl) for 1927. For several years—particularly 
after Nugent took control of the team—the Phillies tried to move to Shibe 
Park on a permanent basis as tenants of the A's. However, Baker Bowl's 
owner, Charles W. Murphy, refused to let the Phillies out of their lease 
at first. He finally relented in 1938, and only then because the city threatened 
to condemn the dilapidated park. Despite the move, attendance rarely topped 
3,000 a game. The nadir came in 1941, when the Phillies finished with a 
ghastly 43–111 record, setting a franchise record for losses in a season. 
A year later, they needed an advance from the league just to go to spring 
training. Nugent realized he didn't have enough money to operate the team 
in 1943, and put it up for sale. He found a willing buyer in minor-league 
executive Bill Veeck, who had the intention of stocking it with Negro League 
stars. Unfortunately for Veeck, when Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis, an ardent segregationist, found out about it, he pressured National 
League president Ford Frick to have the league take over the Phillies. 
The story was initially challenged by a 1998 article in the Society for 
American Baseball Research's The National Pastime, arguing that Philadelphia's 
black press made no mention of a sale to Veeck.[11] However, in 2006, Jules 
Tygiel published an article in the 2006 edition of Baseball Research Journal 
which proved Veeck indeed planned to buy the Phillies.[12] He expanded 
on it in an appendix, entitled "Did Bill Veeck Lie About His Plan to Purchase 
the ’43 Phillies?," published in Paul Dickson's biography, Bill Veeck: 
Baseball's Greatest Maverick.[13] Joseph Thomas Moore wrote in his biography 
of Doby, "Bill Veeck planned to buy the Philadelphia Phillies with the 
as yet unannounced intention of breaking that color line."[14] A week later, 
the league sold the Phillies to a wealthy lumber broker named William B. 
Cox. Nugent had begun phasing out "Phillies" in favor of "Phils" during 
the 1942 season, but Cox almost immediately restored "Phillies" to the 
team's jerseys.[15] For the first time in decades, the Phillies had an 
owner who was not only committed to building a winner, but had the financial 
resources to do so. He immediately poured some of his wealth into the team 
payroll. He also devoted significant resources to player development, including 
the farm system, for the first time in the history of the franchise. His 
efforts had an immediate impact. By July, they had won only four fewer 
games than they had in the previous season, and ultimately managed to get 
out of the National League cellar for the first time in five years in 1943. 
Although they were still a long way from contention, the Phillies' long-suffering 
fans appreciated what Cox was trying to do; attendance rose for the first 
time in nearly 30 years. However, Cox was a very hands-on owner. When manager 
Bucky Harris objected to Cox's interference, Cox fired him. Harris was 
still simmering the next day, and dropped a bombshell to the Philadelphia 
press in his hotel room: he had evidence that Cox was placing bets on his 
own team. Cox initially claimed that the bets were made by his business 
associates. However, he eventually admitted to placing several small bets, 
not knowing it was against the rules. This made no difference to Landis, 
who banned Cox from baseball for life. Author Rich Westcott was quoted 
by Sports Illustrated as saying Cox knew "next to nothing about baseball. 
Otherwise, why would he have bet on the Phillies?"[16] Soon afterward, 
Cox sold controlling interest in the Phillies to DuPont heir Robert R.M. 
Carpenter, who turned control over to his son, Bob, Jr. Carpenter's first 
act was to try to change the team's name (and more importantly, its image 
as a chronic loser) to the "Blue Jays" after a city-wide vote on a new 
nickname. In announcing the change, Carpenter said "he had always admired 
the blue jay and its scrappy qualities."[17] However, "Phillies" continued 
to appear on the team's jerseys, with a blue jay appearing on the sleeves. 
The student council of Johns Hopkins University, whose varsity teams are 
also known as the Blue Jays, vehemently protested Carpenter's decision,[18] 
claiming that the change dishonored their school due to the Phillies' losing 
history. The nickname was officially dropped on January 10, 1950.[19] On 
May 16, 1953, Curt Simmons pitched an almost-perfect game, when he retired 
27 consecutive batters, after the Milwaukee Braves' leadoff batter reached 
base in the first inning on a single.[20] A year later, on May 13, 1954, 
Robin Roberts likewise pitched an almost-perfect game, when he retired 
27 consecutive batters, after the Cincinnati Reds' leadoff batter hit a 
home run in the first inning.[20] Like Cox, Bob Carpenter, Jr. wasn't afraid 
to spend the money it took to build a contender. He immediately started 
signing young players and invested even more money in the farm system. 
The Phillies quickly developed a solid core of young players, known as 
the "Whiz Kids", that included future Hall of Famers Richie Ashburn and 
Robin Roberts. This coincided with the final collapse of the A's. Philadelphia 
had been an "A's town" for most of the first half of the 20th century. 
Even though the A's had fielded teams as bad or worse than the Phillies 
for most of the time since the 1930s, the A's continued to trounce the 
Phillies at the gate. However, a series of poor baseball and business decisions 
on the A's part allowed the Phillies to win the hearts of Philadelphia's 
long-suffering fans. Things started coming together for the Phillies in 
1949, when they rocketed up the standings to third place with an 81–73 
record. Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between 
Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies' first appearance in 
the first division in 31 years. It was also a fitting tribute to Bob Carpenter, 
Sr., who had died in June and left Bob, Jr. in full control of the team. 
Although the Phillies led the National League standings for most of the 
1950 season, a late-season tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting 
pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose 
the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies 
hung onto a one-game lead when Dick Sisler's dramatic tenth-inning, three-run 
home run against the Dodgers clinched the Phils' first pennant in 35 years. 
In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and recipients 
of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight 
games. Nonetheless, this appearance cemented the Phillies' status as the 
city's favorite team. In 1954, the Athletics moved to Kansas City, and 
sold Shibe Park (renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953) to the Phillies. 
Carpenter didn't want to buy it, believing it would cost the Phillies more 
in the long run to own the park than it would renting it from the Athletics. 
For the past 16.5 years, the Phillies had paid the A's ten cents' rent 
for every person that came through the turnstiles at their games. However, 
no other facility in the Delaware Valley was suitable even for temporary 
use, so Carpenter reluctantly bought the park.[21] Many thought that the 
Whiz Kids, with a young core of talented players, would be a force in the 
league for years to come.[22][23] However, it was not to be, as the team 
finished with a 73–81 record in 1951, and (except for 2nd-place tie in 
1964) did not finish higher than third place again until 1975.[24] Their 
lack of success was partly blamed on Carpenter's unwillingness to integrate 
his team after winning a pennant with an all-white team. The Phillies were 
the last National League team to sign a black player, a full 10 years after 
Jackie Robinson made his debut for the Brooklyn Dodgers.[25] Their competitive 
futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies 
lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900. 
In 1947, when Robinson was signed to the Brooklyn Dodgers, Phillies general 
manager Herb Pennock called Dodgers team president Branch Rickey and told 
him not to "bring that nigger here with the rest of the team."[26] When 
the Dodgers arrived with Robinson in the lineup, Philadelphia players stood 
on the top step of the dugout and pointed bats at him while making shooting 
noises. Earlier in the season, when the Phillies had visited Ebbets Field, 
the Phillies players, led by their manager, Ben Chapman, directed so much 
verbal abuse at Robinson that it served to rally the Dodgers around their 
teammate and defend him against further attacks.[27] Between 1953 and 1962, 
the Phillies finished at least 18 games out of first place every year, 
hitting a low point in 1961 when they lost 107 games and finished 46 games 
out of first. During the 1963 season, the Phillies began to climb back 
to respectability. Throughout the 1964 season, they seemed destined to 
make it to the World Series, with excellent performances from players such 
as rookie third baseman Dick Allen, starters Jim Bunning (obtained from 
the Detroit Tigers at the start of the season to shore up the pitching 
staff) and Chris Short, and star right fielder Johnny Callison. On Father's 
Day, Bunning pitched a perfect game against the New York Mets, the first 
in Phillies history.[28] TV Guide went to press with a World Series preview 
that featured a photo of Connie Mack Stadium. However, with a 6 1⁄2-game 
lead on the Cincinnati Reds with 12 games remaining in the season, Philadelphia 
collapsed in a 10-game losing streak (the first seven played at home). 
The crucial series came when the now second-place Phillies traveled to 
St. Louis to play the Cardinals after their losing home stand. They dropped 
the first game of the series to Bob Gibson by a 5–1 score, their eighth 
loss in a row, dropping them to third place. The Cardinals would sweep 
the three-game set and assume first place for good. The Phillies still 
had a chance to force an unprecedented three-way tie for first after the 
Cardinals dropped the first two games of their last season series to the 
New York Mets. However, the Cardinals won their last game of the season, 
leaving the Phillies tied with the Reds for second place—just one game 
out of first. The "Phold of '64" is frequently mentioned as the worst collapse 
in sports history.[29] By the late 1950s, Carpenter decided that the Phillies 
needed a new home. As mentioned above, he never wanted to buy Connie Mack 
Stadium in the first place, and was now convinced there was no way he could 
make money playing there. The stadium didn't have nearly enough parking, 
and the neighborhood around it had already gone to seed. To that end, he 
sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking 
a million-dollar loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. The Phillies 
remained at the old stadium until 1970. In the last game played there, 
the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2–1. The Phillies 
opened the new Veterans Stadium in 1971, with hopes of a new beginning. 
In their first season there, pitcher Rick Wise hurled a no-hitter. On September 
18, 1971, Wise pitched another near-perfect game, in which he gave up a 
home run to the Chicago Cubs' leadoff batter in the second inning, but 
then did not allow another baserunner until the 12th inning, with two outs. 
He had been perfect for 10 2⁄3 retiring 32 consecutive batters—the record 
for most consecutive outs in a game by a winning pitcher.[20] That same 
season, Harry Kalas joined the Phillies broadcasting team. In 1972, the 
Phillies were the worst team in baseball, but newly acquired Steve Carlton 
won nearly half their games (27 of 59 team wins). In that same year, Bob 
Carpenter retired and passed the team ownership to his son Ruly. By 1974, 
the Phillies began their quest for a championship that would be theirs 
6 years later. That year second baseman Dave Cash coined the phrase "Yes 
We Can" for the Phils. Indeed, for a while, it looked as if they could. 
They led the division for 51 days; however, in August and September, the 
Phillies went 25–32 and it was "No They Couldn't". The Phillies achieved 
some success in the mid-1970s. With such players as Carlton, third baseman 
Mike Schmidt, shortstop Larry Bowa, and outfielder Greg Luzinski, the Phillies 
won three straight division titles (1976–78). However, they fell short 
in the NLCS, against the Reds in 1976 and the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. 
In 1979, the Phillies acquired Pete Rose, the spark that would put them 
over the top. The Phils won the NL East in 1980, but to win the league 
championship, they would have to defeat the Astros. In a memorable NLCS, 
with 4 of the 5 games needing extra innings, they fell behind 2–1 but battled 
back to squeeze past the Houston Astros on a tenth-inning game-winning 
hit by center fielder Garry Maddox, and the city celebrated its first pennant 
in 30 years. The entire series saw only one home run hit, a game-winning 
two-run home run by Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski in the Phillies' opening 
3–1 win in Game 1 at Philadelphia. Facing Kansas City in the 1980 World 
Series, the Phillies won their first world championship in 6 games, thanks 
to the timely hitting of Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose. Schmidt, who was the 
NL MVP for the 1980 season, also won the World Series MVP finals award 
on the strength of his 8 for 21 hitting (.381 average), including game-winning 
hits in Game 2 and the clinching Game 6. Thus, the Phillies became the 
last of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues from 1901 to 1960 to 
win a World Series. By comparison, the other 15 teams had each appeared 
in at least three World Series and won it at least once. During the early 
1980s, when baseball was becoming more drug-conscious, several Philadelphia 
players admitted to having used amphetamines from time to time. A memorable 
Philadelphia Daily News headline dubbed the team "The Pillies". The team 
made the playoffs in the strike-shortened 1981 season losing to Montreal 
in the special pre-LCS playoff series. After the 1981 season Ruly Carpenter, 
dissatisfied with changes in baseball's labor environment, sold the team 
to a group of investors led by team executives Bill Giles and David Montgomery 
for $32.5 million—a handsome return on his grandfather's $400,000 investment 
38 years earlier. In 1983, the "Wheeze Kids"[30] won their fourth pennant, 
but lost the 1983 World Series to Baltimore in 5 games. The 1983 season 
was the Phillies' centennial year. On September 28, they defeated the Chicago 
Cubs, 13–6, at Wrigley Field. This victory gave the Phillies the National 
League East Division championship. It was also the 7,000th win in team 
history. The Phillies struggled for most of the rest of the 1980s and early 
1990s. Aside from a distant second-place finish in 1986 ( 21 1⁄2 games 
behind the Mets), they were not a serious factor in a pennant race for 
the rest of the decade. During this stretch, the 1984 team was the only 
other one that even managed to get to the .500 mark. During this time, 
the Phillies often struggled to attract more than 25,000 people to Veterans 
Stadium, the biggest in the National League at the time (at over 62,000 
people). Even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment. 
One factor in the Phillies' decline was the acquisition of Iván DeJesús 
from the Cubs in return for Bowa and a young prospect named Ryne Sandberg. 
Although the trade is now reckoned as one of the most lopsided trades in 
baseball history, it may have made some sense at the time from the Phillies' 
perspective. Although Sandberg had clearly earned a spot in the majors 
(he'd hit .290 in the minors for two years in a row), the Phillies didn't 
think they had a position for him. He'd seen time in the minors at shortstop, 
second base, third base and center field—spots held by Bowa, Manny Trillo, 
Schmidt and Maddox, respectively. Nonetheless, the Phillies didn't get 
nearly enough in return. DeJesus only batted .249 in three years with the 
Phillies, and was out of baseball by 1988. Meanwhile, Sandberg went on 
to a Hall of Fame career. On August 15, 1990, Terry Mulholland lost a perfect 
game in the seventh inning when a San Francisco Giants' batter reached 
base on a throwing error. The next batter grounded into a double play. 
Thus, Mulholland faced the perfect-game maximum of 27 batters, but did 
not qualify for a perfect game. He was credited, however, with a no-hitter.[31] 
The 1992 season would end with the Phillies at the bottom of the barrel, 
at last place in the National League East. However, their fortunes were 
about to change. The 1993 Phillies were led by stars such as Darren Daulton, 
John Kruk, Lenny Dykstra, and Curt Schilling. The team was often described 
as "shaggy", "unkempt", and "dirty." This team was known as a bunch of 
throw back, whatever it takes kind of players. The previous year, noting 
the presence of the clean-cut Dale Murphy, Kruk himself described the team 
as "24 morons and one Mormon" or a bunch of idiots and Murph. Their character 
endeared them to fans, and attendance reached a record high the following 
season. As a play on the legendary 1927 New York Yankees' Murderers' Row, 
the team's dirty, mullet-wearing look was dubbed "Macho Row." To the surprise 
of their city and the nation, the Phillies powered their way to a 97–65 
record and an East division title, all thanks to a big April in which the 
Fightin's went 17–5. The Phillies' major contributors on offense were OF 
Lenny Dykstra, 1B John Kruk, SS Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team 
in batting average, hitting .324), and OF Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit 
over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners 
Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at 
least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen 
and closer Mitch "Wild Thing" Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 
ERA. The Phillies beat the Atlanta Braves (the two-time defending National 
League champions) in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four 
games to two, to earn the fifth pennant in franchise history. They faced 
the defending world champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series. 
Philadelphia lost the Series in six games, with Toronto's Joe Carter hitting 
a walk-off three-run home run off of Mitch Williams in Game 6, to win a 
second consecutive championship for the Blue Jays. Following that loss, 
Williams was the subject of death threats and other hostile reaction from 
some irate Phillies' fans; he left for the Astros. With the 1994 players' 
strike, most of the Phillies' fan base was greatly offended, and afterward, 
the team had little success either on the field or at the gate for a decade. 
Both were negatively affected by the realignment of the Atlanta Braves 
into the National League East in 1994, as the Braves won the division every 
year until 2006, often by wide margins. Despite the relative lack of success, 
many current baseball stars rose to prominence during this era in Phillies 
history, including Scott Rolen, Bobby Abreu, Randy Wolf, Plácido Polanco, 
and perhaps most notably Schilling. In addition, the nucleus of the 2008 
World Series-winning club (Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, Jimmy Rollins, Brett 
Myers, and Cole Hamels) was developed during this era. Former Phillie Larry 
Bowa was hired as manager for the 2001 season, and led the Phillies to 
an 86–76 record, their first winning season since the 1993 World Series 
year. They spent most of the first half of the season in first place, and 
traded first place with the Braves for most of the second half. In the 
end, they finished two games out of first, the Braves' tightest division 
race in years. Bowa was named National League Manager of the Year. The 
Phillies continued to contend for the next few years under Bowa, with the 
only blemish being an 80–81 season in 2002. The following year, in their 
last season at Veterans Stadium, the Phillies were expected to contend 
for the World Series after adding such players as Jim Thome, Kevin Millwood, 
and David Bell to go along with the emerging nucleus of Rollins, Burrell, 
Wolf, and Vicente Padilla. However, Burrell and Bell slumped miserably 
at the plate, and the Phillies' inconsistent bullpen led to the team finishing 
86–76 and in third place behind the Braves and eventual World Series-winning 
Florida Marlins. The opening of the new Citizens Bank Park brought fans 
new hope, and the team was expected to win the NL East. However, they finished 
a distant second, and Bowa was fired with two games to go in the season. 
Charlie Manuel took over as manager for 2005, and kept the Phillies in 
contention throughout the season; they were only eliminated from wild card 
contention on the next-to-last day. However, it was not enough to save 
the job of general manager Ed Wade; he was fired after his eighth season. 
Soon after, the Phillies hired Pat Gillick, who, ironically, was the general 
manager of the 1992 and 1993 Toronto Blue Jays' Championship teams. Despite 
another late-season disappointment, 2005 saw the Phillies core shift away 
from veterans such as Thome, Polanco, Abreu, and Wolf to younger home-grown 
stars such as Rollins, Utley, Brett Myers and Ryan Howard. Continuing what 
he had begun in the off-season, Gillick engaged in a flurry of trades in 
an effort to transform the character of the team and to obtain financial 
flexibility for what he termed "retooling." On July 26, 2006, the Phillies 
traded backup catcher Sal Fasano to the New York Yankees for minor league 
infielder Hector Made. Two days later, the Phillies traded third baseman 
David Bell, who was due to become a free agent during the off-season, to 
the Milwaukee Brewers for minor league pitcher Wilfredo Laureano. Gillick 
did not stop there, making a deadline deal that sent outfielder Bobby Abreu 
and pitcher Cory Lidle to the Yankees in exchange for Matt Smith, C.J. 
Henry, Carlos Monastrios, and Jesus Sanchez. The team responded well to 
the changes. All-Star second baseman Chase Utley was free to bat third, 
and Ryan Howard batted cleanup; more importantly, they assumed a team leadership 
role along with shortstop Jimmy Rollins. On August 18, Gillick acquired 
veteran left-hander Jamie Moyer, a native of the Philadelphia suburb of 
Souderton, Pennsylvania, for the starting rotation. Immediately afterwards, 
and following a win over the Washington Nationals on August 29, the Phillies' 
record stood at 66–65, trailing the San Diego Padres by a mere half game 
in the wild-card race. By September 24, the Phillies had captured and lost 
the wild-card lead and were tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers. With identical 
82–74 records, both teams took to the road for the final six games, the 
Phillies to Washington and Florida, the Dodgers to Colorado and San Francisco. 
On September 30, both the Dodgers and Padres won their respective games 
and as a result, the Phillies were eliminated from playoff contention while 
two games behind with only one left to play. Ryan Howard was named the 
National League's Most Valuable Player, narrowly edging the St. Louis Cardinals' 
Albert Pujols to claim the top honor in the National League. The special 
assistant to the general manager and long-time Phils coach, John Vukovich, 
died of brain cancer on March 8, 2007, and was honored on August 10, 2007 
by the Phillies organization, which installed a plaque bearing Vukovich's 
name and accomplishments on the "Wall of Fame" in the Ashburn Alley outfield 
concourse at Citizens Bank Park. For the 2007 season, the Phillies wore 
a black circular patch on their right uniform sleeves bearing the letters 
"VUK" in white. The Phillies began the 2007 season with a 5–3 home loss 
on April 2 to the Atlanta Braves after 10 innings. After the first fifteen 
games, the Phillies limped to a 4–11 record, but then found a five-game 
winning streak to put them back into contention in the National League 
East. After 40 games, the Phillies finally reached the .500 mark at 20–20. 
Heading into the All-Star break, the Phillies split their win/loss record 
at 44–44, hampered by the loss of starting pitchers Freddy García and Jon 
Lieber due to injuries that sidelined them for the remainder of the season. 
They found a bright spot in young pitcher Kyle Kendrick, who rose from 
the Phillies' AA team in Reading, Pennsylvania to the Phils starting rotation 
in 2007. Three Phillies were named to the 2007 All Star Game in San Francisco. 
Chase Utley was the starting second baseman for the National League squad 
and center fielder Aaron Rowand was named as a backup (his first All Star 
appearance). Starting pitcher Cole Hamels also appeared in his first All 
Star Game. On July 15, 2007, the Phillies lost their 10,000th game, 10–2 
to the St. Louis Cardinals on a nationally televised ESPN game.[32] The 
Phillies became the first North American professional sports franchise 
to lose 10,000 games. On September 21, Jimmy Rollins became the first player 
in major league history to collect 200 hits, 15 triples, 25 home runs, 
and 25 stolen bases in the same season. Rollins also became the 4th player 
to have at least 20 home runs, 20 triples, 20 doubles, and 20 stolen bases 
in a season on September 30, securing the feat on the last day of the season 
with a sixth inning RBI triple. On September 12, the Phillies were seven 
games behind the New York Mets in the National League East, and it appeared 
as if their division hopes were dashed. However, the Mets suffered an epic 
collapse on the likes of the "Phold of 1964", going 4–11 over the next 
fifteen games while the Phillies parried with a strong 12–3 record. The 
Phillies had defeated the Mets in eight consecutive encounters (between 
July 1, 2007 and September 16, 2007) and ultimately overtook the Mets by 
one game on September 28. The Phillies fell back into a first-place tie 
the following day with a Mets win and a Phillies loss, with only one game 
remaining in the regular season to decide the champion of the National 
League Eastern Division. The Mets would lose their final game of the season. 
Only minutes later, the Phillies defeated the Washington Nationals, clinching 
the division for the Phillies for the first time in 14 years. The Phillies 
won the final game behind 44-year-old Jamie Moyer, who in 1980 had skipped 
a day of high school to attend that year's Phillies championship parade 
down Philadelphia's Broad Street. After their historic comeback, they were 
swept in three games by the Colorado Rockies after losing 2–1 in Game 3 
on October 6, 2007. It was the first time since 1976 that the Phils were 
swept in a postseason series. On November 20, 2007, Jimmy Rollins was named 
National League MVP, edging out Colorado Rockies left fielder Matt Holliday 
by 17 votes, making it one of the closest contests since the voting format 
was adopted in 1938. Along with Ryan Howard's 2006 win, they became the 
first baseball club with back-to-back MVP winners since the San Francisco 
Giants's Jeff Kent and Barry Bonds in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Even 
though their sweep from the playoffs was a disappointment, the Phillies 
started on their quest for October baseball in 2008 by trading OF Michael 
Bourn, RHP Geoff Geary, and 3B Michael Costanzo (since traded to the Baltimore 
Orioles) to the Houston Astros for RHP Brad Lidge and IF Eric Bruntlett. 
They also re-signed LHP J. C. Romero to a three-year deal, in addition 
to bringing back manager Charlie Manuel and the rest of the coaching staff. 
The Phillies signed OF Geoff Jenkins to a two-year deal, to be the left-handed 
part of a platoon with right-handed OF Jayson Werth. They also signed OF 
So Taguchi to a one-year deal, as a pinch hitter/backup outfielder. With 
these new outfielders coming into town, the Phillies sold OF Chris Roberson 
to the Baltimore Orioles. Most recently, the Phillies acquired free-agent 
3B Pedro Feliz, formerly of the San Francisco Giants, inking him to a two-year 
contract worth $8.5 million.[33] These additions relegated IF/OF Greg Dobbs 
to a utility role, where he excelled in the previous season as the team's 
primary left-handed pinch hitter. On February 21, 2008 an arbitrator ruled 
in Ryan Howard's favor, giving him a $10 million salary for the 2008 season. 
Major League Baseball's website also named the Phillies as the favorites 
for the National League East championship for 2008.[34] Meanwhile, in the 
wake of the 2007 season and Carlos Beltrán's calling out of the 2008 Phillies' 
team, the Mets–Phillies rivalry now stood as one of the most intense in 
baseball. Though the Phillies were named in some sources as the favorites 
to repeat as division champions, they did not get off to the blazing April 
start that many had hoped for. Still, they managed their first winning 
opening month since 2003, and only their fourth since their last World 
Series appearance. With a batting average of .360 and his MLB-leading 11 
home runs, Chase Utley paced the team's offense, followed closely by a 
resurgent Pat Burrell and his 25 runs batted in. Though team speed was 
hampered by the loss of Shane Victorino and Jimmy Rollins to the disabled 
list, the latter for the first time in his career, the Phillies still pushed 
forward to a 15–13 record. The pitching rotation was led by ace Cole Hamels, 
who led the team in wins (3), ERA (2.70), and innings pitched ( 43 1⁄3). 
Reliever J. C. Romero and new closer Brad Lidge both went the entire month 
without sacrificing a single run, over 12 1⁄2 and 11 innings respectively. 
Though several fill-in players, including Brad Harman and T.J. Bohn, substituted 
nicely during Victorino's and Rollins' absence, perhaps none was more valuable 
to the team during the month of May than Jayson Werth. Expected to be primarily 
a platoon player coming into the season, Werth showed flashes of the form 
that once made him such a highly regarded prospect with the Dodgers. While 
Utley's bat cooled, Werth had a game with three home runs[35] and stole 
four bases in the month. Unfortunately, as Rollins and Victorino returned, 
Werth was lost to the disabled list. Ryan Howard broke out of his early-season 
slump, hitting .245 in May, nearly an 80-point increase from his average 
in April, and slugging ten home runs. Hometown pitcher Jamie Moyer also 
became the sixth pitcher in Major League Baseball history to defeat all 
30 teams in the league on May 26, in a 20–5 Phillies win over Colorado.[36] 
June was a tale of two halves for the Phillies, as they ended May and started 
June with a strong run of offense and excellent pitching. From May 26 to 
June 13, the Phillies posted a 14–4 record, starting their run with a 15–6 
win over the Astros and ending with a 20–2 win over the Cardinals. However, 
the offense took a downturn as the Phillies pitchers began to sacrifice 
more runs in the latter part of the month. The Phillies went 3–11 over 
the remainder of June, with the pitchers allowing an average of 4.79 runs 
per game, to the offense's 3.36 runs scored per game. This was punctuated 
by a season-high 6-game losing streak. The poor records coincided with 
the Phillies' stretch of interleague play for 2008, as they were swept 
by the Angels, and lost their series with the Red Sox, A's, and Rangers, 
in addition to dropping two NL series against the Cardinals and Marlins. 
While Hamels and Kyle Kendrick each managed to post a 3–1 record in the 
rotation, the other starters (Moyer, Adam Eaton, and Brett Myers) were 
not so lucky. Myers' poor performance received arguably the most scrutiny, 
based on management's decision to move him back to the rotation from the 
bullpen after the 2007 season.[37] Myers would eventually accept a demotion 
to AAA Lehigh Valley to work on his confidence and mechanics. July began 
with the announcement that Chase Utley and Brad Lidge would represent the 
team at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game,[38] with Utley garnering 
the most votes of all National League players.[39] The Phillies went 8–4 
in July before the All-Star break, compiling a four-game win streak, a 
four-game losing streak, and winning four of their last five. In a move 
to bolster their starting rotation in preparation for the pennant race, 
the Phillies traded three minor league players, including second baseman 
Adrian Cardenas, pitcher Josh Outman, and outfielder Matthew Spencer to 
the Athletics for starting pitcher Joe Blanton on July 17.[40] On September 
27, the Phillies clinched the National League East for the second year 
in a row, once again helped by a late September slump from the New York 
Mets. The Phillies redeemed their previous year's playoff performance by 
winning the NLDS three games to one against the Brewers, and they defeated 
the Dodgers in Los Angeles as well, 4–1. As the National League champions, 
the Phillies advanced to the 2008 World Series to play the Tampa Bay Rays. 
After a power outage by the offense in which they went 1 for 33 with runners 
in scoring position and the first-ever suspended postseason game in World 
Series history in game five, the Phillies rode their pitching rotation 
to a 4–1 victory in the Fall Classic; Hamels was named the series MVP for 
both the NLCS and the World Series. The Phillies posted a second consecutive 
winning April to open the season with an 11–9 record, but the month was 
marred by the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Kalas.[41] After opening 
the month of May against the rival New York Mets, the Phillies met President 
Barack Obama to celebrate their World Series victory the previous season, 
and had two rookie pitchers win consecutive starts for the first time since 
2007. Starting pitcher Jamie Moyer earned his 250th career win during the 
month, while first baseman Ryan Howard and outfielder Raúl Ibáñez became 
the first Phillies teammates to hit 10 home runs in the same month. Echoing 
their strong run in the middle of the 2008 season, the Phillies compiled 
a 16–4 record in late May and early June, which was countered by weakness 
during interleague play in late June. After the team's largest victory 
of the season (22–1 over the Cincinnati Reds) in early July, five Phillies—Howard, 
Ibáñez, second baseman Chase Utley, and outfielders Shane Victorino and 
Jayson Werth—were selected to the All-Star team. July was the team's best 
showing of the season, as they compiled their first 20-win month since 
the 2001 season. The Phillies traded for starting pitcher Cliff Lee at 
the end of the month to bolster their starting rotation, who won his first 
five starts with the team, and signed free-agent pitcher Pedro Martínez. 
In August, Eric Bruntlett turned the first game-ending unassisted triple 
play in National League history, and only the second unassisted triple 
play in team history. The following month, the team clinched its third 
consecutive division championship on September 30, becoming the first Phillies 
team to make a third straight playoff appearance since the 1976–1978 Phillies. 
Philadelphia defeated the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division 
Series (NLDS), 3–1, and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League 
Championship Series (NLCS) for the second consecutive year, 4–1. Howard 
was named the most valuable player of the NLCS. The Phillies were defeated 
by the Yankees in the World Series, four games to two. On December 7, 2009, 
Baseball America named the Phillies as its Organization of the Year.[42] 
On December 9, Chase Utley was named by Sports Illustrated as the second 
baseman on its MLB All-Decade Team. On December 22, Sports Illustrated 
named retired general manager Pat Gillick as number 7 on its list of the 
Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade (in all sports).[43] After the 2010 
season, Jayson Werth left the Phillies to pursue a more-lucrative contract 
with the Washington Nationals. One of the highlights of the season occurred 
on May 29, when Roy Halladay pitched a perfect game, the second in franchise 
history. The Phillies finished with a 97–65 record, the best record in 
major league baseball. In the NLDS, they swept the Cincinnati Reds, 3–0. 
In Game 1, Halladay's first career postseason start, he hurled a no-hitter, 
giving up only one walk. It was only the second postseason no-hitter in 
Major League Baseball history, and the first since Don Larsen's perfect 
game in the 1956 World Series. The Phillies lost the 2010 National League 
Championship Series, 4 games to 2, at the hands of the San Francisco Giants, 
who went on to win their first World Series title since 1954, defeating 
the Texas Rangers. Halladay was named the National League's Cy Young Award 
winner. In 2011, the Phillies amassed a starting pitching rotation that 
ESPN referred to as the "best rotation in major league history."[44] This 
rotation included Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt, Cliff Lee, Cole Hamels and 
Joe Blanton. Blanton was sidelined with injury and was replaced with Vance 
Worley, a AAA pitcher from the Lehigh Valley IronPigs who amassed an 11–3 
record in the 2011 season. The Phillies won 14 consecutive games when Worley 
started, including games where he did not receive the decision. On August 
16, after a two-day delay because of inclement weather, the Phillies, led 
by Steve Carlton and Jimmy Rollins, and hosted by Phillies public address 
announcer Dan Baker, unveiled a 7 feet (210 cm) tall bronze statue of Hall 
of Fame announcer Harry Kalas in the left field side of the Ashburn Alley 
outfield concourse at Citizens Bank Park, between the Harry the K's restaurant 
and the center field statue of Kalas' best friend, Richie Ashburn. Privately 
commissioned and funded entirely by donations by fans, this statue shows 
Kalas standing cross-legged on top of a home plate, with a microphone in 
his right hand, which is also on top of a baseball bat, which Kalas is 
leaning upon. A bronze plaque embedded in the concrete walkway at the foot 
of the statue carries the originally planned August 14 unveiling date. 
The Phillies amassed a 102–60 record, the best in franchise history, and 
the best regular-season record in MLB in 2011. The previous record of 101–61 
was set in both 1976 and 1977. Immediately after the Phillies clinched 
their division championship in mid-September, while playing several bench 
players and shuffling their batting order, they suffered an 8-game losing 
streak, becoming the first team in MLB history to lose 8 straight after 
winning their division and winning 98 games in a season. The Phillies eliminated 
the Atlanta Braves from wild card contention on the last day of the regular 
season, sweeping a 3-game series against the Braves in Atlanta, erasing 
an 8 1⁄2 game lead that the Braves held in the wild card lead as of September 
1, 2011. The St. Louis Cardinals caught and surpassed the Braves on the 
last game of the season, and faced the Phillies in the 2011 National League 
Division Series, which was tied at 2 games apiece as of October 6, 2011. 
The Phillies lost the deciding Game 5 at Citizens Bank Park the next night. 
The Cardinals went on to win their eleventh World Series title (most in 
the National League), defeating the Texas Rangers. In the 2011–2012 off-season, 
the Phillies re-signed Jim Thome and signed closer Jonathan Papelbon and 
Laynce Nix, as well as obtaining Ty Wigginton via a trade with the Colorado 
Rockies. During the season, the Phillies put up a sub-par performance during 
the early and middle months of the season, and fell into last place for 
much of the season. The Phillies traded away Shane Victorino, Joe Blanton 
and Hunter Pence during August, as team management did not see the possibility 
of reaching the post-season. In August, not long after the trades, the 
Phillies caught fire, and finished with an 81–81 record, after being 14 
games below .500 at mid-season. The Phillies finished in 3rd place in the 
NL East, 17 games behind the Washington Nationals and 13 games behind the 
Atlanta Braves, who went on to win one of the wild card spots. The Phillies
