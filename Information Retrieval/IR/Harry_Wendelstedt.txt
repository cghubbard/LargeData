Harry Hunter Wendelstedt, Jr. (July 27, 1938 – March 9, 2012) was an umpire 
in Major League Baseball who worked in the National League from 1966 to 
1998. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He umpired in the World Series 
in 1973, 1980, 1986, 1991 and 1995, serving as crew chief in 1980 and 1995. 
He also officiated in seven National League Championship Series (1970, 
1972, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1988, 1990) and four All-Star games (1968, 1976, 
1983, 1992), calling balls and strikes in 1976. He umpired in the National 
League Division Series in 1995, 1996 and 1997. He wore uniform number 21. 
Wendelstedt called balls and strikes in five no-hitters, tying an NL record 
held by Bill Klem. As a home plate umpire, Wendelstedt was known for keeping 
a wide strike zone. When a batter struck out swinging, he flailed his right 
arm straight up in the air. When a batter struck out looking, he applied 
the notorious "chainsaw" move. On May 31, 1968, Wendelstedt made a famous 
call that preserved Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale's consecutive 
shutouts and scoreless innings streaks. Giants catcher Dick Dietz came 
to the plate in the top of the 9th inning with the bases loaded and no 
outs. On a 2–2 count, Drysdale hit Dietz on the elbow, apparently forcing 
in a run that would have ended the streaks. However, Wendelstedt ruled 
that Dietz made no attempt to avoid being struck by the pitch, and called 
him back. Drysdale retired Dietz on a short fly ball and got out of the 
inning without yielding a run, earning his fifth (of six) consecutive shutouts. 
On October 8, 1988, in Game 3 of the 1988 NLCS, Wendelstedt famously ejected 
Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Jay Howell from the game for having pine tar 
in his glove. Mets manager Davey Johnson asked the umpires to check Howell, 
and was ejected by Wendelstedt, the crew chief, after pine tar was found 
in his glove. Howell was later suspended for the rest of the series. Wendelstedt's 
son, Harry Hunter Wendelstedt III, followed in his father's footsteps and 
is a current major league umpire. The younger Wendelstedt goes by his middle 
name of "Hunter" professionally. To honor his father, Hunter also wears 
uniform number 21. In 1977, Wendelstedt took over control of the Al Somers 
Umpire School from its founder (who had trained Wendelstedt), renaming 
it the Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School. He ran the school until his death 
and it continues to bear his name. His son Hunter now leads the school, 
located in Ormond Beach, Florida.[1] Harry Wendelstedt died at the age 
of 73 on March 9, 2012 after suffering from brain cancer for several years.[2][3][4]
