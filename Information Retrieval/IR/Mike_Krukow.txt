Michael Edward Krukow (born January 21, 1952) is a former starting pitcher 
in Major League Baseball. He is currently a television color commentator 
for the San Francisco Giants. Krukow attended San Gabriel High School in 
San Gabriel, California, where he played as a catcher. He was drafted as 
a catcher by the California Angels in the 32nd round of the 1970 Major 
League Baseball Draft but did not sign.[1] Krukow played college baseball 
for the Cal Poly Mustangs in San Luis Obispo, California. Though his collegiate 
eligibility was cut short, he still holds the school record for career 
earned run average at 1.94 and is tied for most shutouts in a season with 
5. Krukow was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 8th round of the 1973 
draft. Krukow played Major League baseball for the Chicago Cubs (1976–1981), 
the Philadelphia Phillies (1982) and the San Francisco Giants (1983–1989). 
He batted and threw right-handed. Krukow had a solid career in the major 
leagues. In 1982, after six years with the Cubs, he was dealt to Philadelphia 
for pitchers Dickie Noles and Dan Larson and outfielder Keith Moreland. 
The right-handed starter was second only to Steve Carlton in wins, posting 
a 13-11 record and an impressive 3.12 ERA, but despite this success, the 
Phillies sent Krukow, Mark Davis and Charlie Penigar to the San Francisco 
Giants in December 1982 in a trade for Joe Morgan and reliever Al Holland. 
The trade helped Philadelphia win the National League pennant in 1983, 
but it also gave San Francisco two arms that would become a big part of 
the Giants' success in the late 1980s. Although known as a starter, Krukow 
earned his only career save on August 31, 1984, pitching to just one batter 
(the Phillies' Sixto Lezcano), inducing a game-ending groundout, therefore 
preserving a 6–5 Giant victory.[2] Krukow's best season was in 1986, posting 
a record of 20-9 with a 3.05 ERA pitching for the San Francisco Giants. 
Krukow finished third in that year's NL Cy Young Award voting behind Mike 
Scott and Fernando Valenzuela. Krukow was selected to the National League 
All-Star team that season. He was awarded the Willie Mac Award in both 
1985 and 1986 honoring his spirit and leadership. In 1987, Krukow helped 
lead the Giants to their first division championship in 16 years. On June 
30, 1989, Krukow underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn rotator 
cuff in his pitching shoulder after spending parts of three seasons on 
the disabled list for what was believed to be bursitis. He retired in March 
1990.[3] In his 14-season career, Krukow posted a 124-117 record with 1,478 
strikeouts and a 3.90 ERA in 2190.1 innings pitched. Barry Bonds was 3 
for 11 lifetime against Krukow, with 1 home run and 3 strikeouts. After 
his playing career, Krukow became a radio and television sportscaster. 
Krukow began broadcasting as an occasional color analyst for KNBR radio 
in 1990 and became a full-time broadcaster in 1994. He is a seven-time 
Emmy award winner.[4] "Kruk," who was named as the starting right-handed 
pitcher to the 1980s Giants All- Decade Team in a vote by Bay Area media 
in 1999, is noted for his deep knowledge of the game and tremendous sense 
of humor.[5] He is known for his detailed scouting reports on umpires' 
strike zones.[citation needed] He is often teased by his broadcasting colleagues 
throughout the major leagues for having "majestic hair".[citation needed] 
Part of the San Francisco Giants broadcasting team, Krukow is half of the 
duo dubbed "Kruk and Kuip," (pronounced "Kruke" and "Kipe") along with 
partner Duane Kuiper, a former Giants teammate. Krukow and Kuiper tape 
a game-day commentary ("Kruk and Kuip on baseball") for KNBR radio as part 
of the Giants' pre-game radio coverage. Notably, although Krukow was a 
pitcher and Kuiper was a position player, Krukow has five career home runs, 
four more than Kuiper (who managed only one in his career despite having 
over 3,000 at-bats). Krukow has a few "Kruktionary" catchphrases, including: 
"Grab some pine, meat"; "Just another, ha ha ha ha, laugher!" (after a 
nail-biter win); and "I wanna get that!", the last of which is associated 
with a product endorsement.[6] Krukow and Kuiper can be heard as the commentators 
in Electronic Arts video games MVP Baseball 2003, 2004 and 2005. They include 
Krukow's familiar "grab some pine, meat" quote.[citation needed] Until 
the summer of 2014, Krukow and his wife Jennifer resided in San Luis Obispo, 
California, but they moved to Reno, Nevada to be closer to their grandchildren.[7] 
They have five adult children, Jarek, Baker, Tessa, Chase and Weston.[4] 
He is a talented musician, and proficient in the guitar, the mandolin, 
the banjo, and the ukulele.[8] In his spare time he enjoys reading, bicycling, 
golfing and drinking Coronas on the beach. He is good friends with Duane 
Kuiper. In July 2014, Krukow revealed he was suffering from inclusion body 
myositis (IBM). His condition was known to the Giants and many of his fellow 
broadcasters, but he kept the condition a secret from the general public 
until then.[7][8] Krukow first noticed that he was having problems about 
10 years earlier, when he had lost about 100 yards (90 m) off his golf 
drive.[7] According to sportswriter Steve Fainaru, Krukow "blew it off... 
for years", but "secretly feared he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
Lou Gehrig's disease".[7] Finally, in 2011, he saw the Giants' team neurologist, 
who referred him to a neuromuscular specialist who in turn diagnosed him 
with IBM.[7] The disease, which mainly affects the quadriceps and hand 
muscles, is not life-threatening, but now requires him to use a cane; eventually, 
Krukow will have to use a walker and/or a scooter.[8] Because of increasing 
hand weakness that limits his ability to play stringed instruments, he 
has recently taken up the drums, which require a different set of muscular 
movements.[7] Krukow plans to continue broadcasting for the foreseeable
