Lee Elmer Handley (July 13, 1913 – April 8, 1970) was a second baseman/third 
baseman who played in Major League Baseball between 1936 and 1947. Nicknamed 
"Jeep", Handley batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Clarion, 
Iowa. His younger brother, Gene, also played in the Major Leagues from 
1946 to 1947. Listed at 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m), 160 lb., Handley was a flashy 
infielder and a disciplined hitter as well. He reached the majors in 1936 
with the Cincinnati Reds, spending one year with them before moving to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates (1937–41, 1944–46) and Philadelphia Phillies (1947). 
He was a rookie Pirate regular at second base in 1937, and a full- or part-time 
third baseman from 1938 through 1941. His most productive season came in 
1938, when he posted career-numbers in games played (139), runs (91), hits 
(153), doubles (25), home runs (6) and runs batted in (51). He also was 
considered in the Most Valuable Player vote. In 1939 Handley hit a career-high 
average of .285 and tied for the National League lead in stolen bases (17), 
despite suffering a serious beaning that kept him out of the lineup for 
52 games. He also was hurt in an automobile accident before the 1942 season, 
but returned in 1945 to hit .298 in 98 games. In a 10-season career, Handley 
was a .269 hitter with 15 home runs and 297 RBI in 968 games, including 
a solid 1.31 walk-to-strikeout ratio (267-to-204). An alumnus of Bradley 
University, Handley died of an apparent heart attack in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
