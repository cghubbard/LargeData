MLB record Carlos Joaquín Ruiz (born January 22, 1979) is a Panamanian 
professional baseball catcher for the Seattle Mariners of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He previously played in MLB for the Philadelphia Phillies 
and Los Angeles Dodgers. His nicknames include Chooch, Bad Dude and Señor 
Octubre. He grew up in David, Chiriquí, Panama, and resolved to play Major 
League Baseball after his father and grandmother both died within two weeks 
of each other when he was seven years old. He made his way through the 
Phillies farm system from 1998 until 2006, playing at each level of Minor 
League Baseball, until finally making his debut with the Phillies in 2006, 
fulfilling his childhood dream. He battled adversity in his progression 
through the system, including feeling homesick, a position change and the 
language barrier (he spoke Spanish, while most teammates and team officials 
spoke English). He spent his first full season in the major leagues in 
2007 and has remained there since. In 2008, for his strong postseason performance, 
including a walk-off hit, during the Phillies playoff run that concluded 
with victory in the 2008 World Series, he earned the nickname "Señor Octubre" 
(Mr. October). Despite being one of the quietest players on the team, he 
was subsequently called the "heart and soul" of the Phillies; he serves 
as a constant source of encouragement and rebuke alike to his teammates. 
Over the following seasons, he was a part of the core group of players 
that led the Phillies to five consecutive playoff appearances from 2007 
until 2011. He had his best season in 2012, holding a batting average of 
over .300, earning his first appearance in the Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game, and finishing in the top 30 of the National League Most Valuable 
Player voting. In 2013, he began the season with a 25-game suspension for 
using Adderall, and subsequently spent time on the disabled list, ultimately 
playing in fewer than 100 games for the first time in his MLB career. Ruiz 
is the only player in the National League to catch four no-hitters, and 
one of only two catchers in Major League Baseball, the other being Jason 
Varitek. Ruiz grew up in David, Panama, and was the oldest of three sons. 
His father was a police officer and his mother was an elementary school 
teacher. When he was seven years old, his father Joaquin was patrolling 
in his police jeep when a tire blew out, causing the vehicle to flip, throwing 
Joaquin into a ditch, and then crushing him when it fell on top of him. 
Just weeks before, his grandmother died of cancer. As a result, Ruiz became 
"the new father", starting work shortly thereafter as a laborer on a coffee 
farm to supplement the family income, and by age 10 was earning about US$3 
per day. He also promised his widowed mother that he would make it to Major 
League Baseball to support the family.[1] Subsequently, he began attending 
college to earn a degree in physical education, but dropped out shortly 
after he began to attend the Phillies baseball academy.[2] Ruiz's upbringing 
contributed to his approach to the game. His mother insisted that he excel 
academically, and would not allow him to play baseball unless he did well 
in school. Baseball was his first love, and he was responsible for organizing 
the community's games: "Ruiz's natural leadership skills flourished. As 
a boy, Ruiz, who had chosen to play with baseballs instead of toy cars 
even as a toddler, was always the one in his neighborhood to organize pickup 
baseball games. It was he who brought the balls and bats, and it was he 
who picked the teams and ordered everyone to their positions. He had an 
acute understanding of the game. Ruiz was made to lead, and playing catcher 
eventually suited him perfectly." In 1998, Ruiz followed his dream of playing 
professional baseball first by attending the Phillies Baseball Academy 
in La Vega, Dominican Republic, where he played catcher for the first time, 
moving from his initial position of second base.[a] Though he was ready 
to quit because "he looked and felt like a 10-year-old among the tall, 
athletic prospects surrounding him", his uncle convinced him in a phone 
conversation to stick with it.[1] The Phillies signed him as an amateur 
free agent on December 4, 1998 for US$8,000,[3] and he made his professional 
debut in 1999 with the Dominican Summer League (DSL) team DSL Phillies, 
with whom he compiled a .305 batting average, 4 home runs, and 35 runs 
batted in (RBIs) in 60 games. Prior to the 2000 season, Ruiz met Mick Billmeyer, 
the Phillies' minor league catching coordinator, who served as his mentor. 
Billmeyer sought to learn Spanish while Ruiz sought to learn English, and 
the two bonded as Billmeyer helped mold Ruiz into an eventual top prospect 
and ultimately a starting catcher.[2] In 2000, he came to America, progressing 
to play in the Gulf Coast League (GCL) for the GCL Phillies, and hitting 
.277 in 38 games. He earned another promotion in 2001, playing for the 
Lakewood BlueClaws of Class A Minor League Baseball. In 2001, his performance 
was similar in quality to his first two seasons, and he was promoted to 
the Clearwater Threshers of Class A-Advanced, with whom he played over 
parts of the next two seasons. He struggled at the plate in 2002, compiling 
just a .213 batting average in 92 games, but hit .315 in 15 games in 2003, 
and that year earned another promotion.[4] In 2004, Ruiz spent the entire 
season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, posting a .284 batting average 
and hitting 17 home runs, the latter of which was second among catchers 
in the Eastern League. In addition to his strong offensive numbers, he 
threw out 25 of 76 attempted base stealers (32.9%).[4] Off the field, it 
was in 2004 that Ruiz first gained the original form of his nickname "Chooch". 
Though a quiet individual, Ruiz frequently muttered "chucha" (a word equivalent 
to the f-bomb in Panama) under his breath, and teammate Anderson Machado 
thus began to address Ruiz as "chucha", which was later shortened to "Chooch", 
and the nickname's usage snowballed from there.[1] His strong performance 
earned him another promotion in 2005 when he played for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Red Barons, and posted a better batting average but fewer home runs than 
in Reading: .300, 4 home runs, 40 RBIs in 100 games. Before the 2006 season, 
he played for his native Panama in the first World Baseball Classic. His 
final season in the minor leagues was 2006. During 100 games, he hit .307 
with 16 home runs and 69 RBIs, earning International League all-star accolades. 
He moved back and forth between Triple-A and the major league Phillies 
all year long, making his MLB debut on May 6, 2006.[4] Ruiz was first brought 
up to the major league level when Phillies' starting catcher Mike Lieberthal 
went on the disabled list (DL) in May 2006,[5] and Ruiz debuted on May 
6.[4] When Lieberthal returned, Ruiz was sent back to the minors. When 
Lieberthal went once again on the DL in June, the Phillies used Sal Fasano 
and Chris Coste rather than recalling Ruiz.[6] He was recalled on July 
4, when he hit his first major league home run off San Diego Padres' pitcher 
Clay Hensley. He was optioned back to the minor leagues once more before 
his recall on August 31—essentially a September callup.[4] Overall, with 
the big league club, he hit .261 with 3 home runs and 10 RBIs.[7] Ruiz 
permanently joined the Phillies' roster on opening day 2007, after eight 
seasons in the minor leagues. He ultimately "grabbed hold of the top job 
[as starting catcher] and never let go".[3] The Phillies signed Rod Barajas 
before the season because of concerns about Ruiz's ability to catch, hit, 
and generally hold up over a full season at the major league level, as 
seasons there are longer than in the minor leagues.[8] During the season, 
he honed his confidence and earned the trust of the Phillies' pitching 
staff, including veteran Jamie Moyer, who commented, "I see a real assuredness 
to his body language. He's not cocky or brash. He just seems very confident 
in what's going on."[3] On June 26, Ruiz stole home on the front end of 
a double steal in an 11–4 home win over the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the 
first Phillie to steal home since Scott Rolen in 1997.[4] He eventually 
played 115 games over the season, and from then on was the Phillies' regular 
starting catcher.[3] Statistically, he committed only two errors, which 
tied for second-best among MLB catchers with at least 100 games played. 
He had 27 multi-hit games, hit 6 home runs and 51 RBIs with a .259 batting 
average.[4][7] At the conclusion of the season, he was named to the Topps 
All-Star Rookie Team.[9] Ruiz entered the 2008 season focused predominantly 
on defense, specifically helping the pitcher: "... Ruiz invests himself 
in the pitcher's performance. He and the pitcher succeed or fail together... 
Everything starts with pitching. 'Hitting is nice, but working with the 
pitcher is my No. 1 job. ... I want to feel like we are one person.'" Ruiz 
struggled to hit consistently throughout the season, specifically in the 
first half; from the beginning of the year until July 11, he hit .206 with 
2 home runs and 20 RBIs. Nevertheless, due to his rapport with the pitching 
staff (pitchers' ERA when throwing to him (catcher's ERA) was 3.56, the 
best for any catcher in the National League (NL)), and a vote of confidence 
from manager Charlie Manuel, he was secure in his position.[10] In late 
July, he had a multi-hit game against the New York Mets, which may have 
helped him break out of his slump.[11] Ultimately, during the regular season, 
he hit .219 with 4 home runs and 31 RBIs.[7] Despite his struggles at the 
plate during the regular season, Ruiz was an integral part of the Phillies' 
postseason success.[12] After the Phillies clinched the 2008 National League 
Championship Series, he commented that the glory of winning a crucial baseball 
game that clinched the series, which he had witnessed while growing up 
in Panama on television, "happened to me", noting the aura of the moment, 
and that it culminated and validated the hard work he had put in over the 
years.[13] Subsequently, in game 3 of the 2008 World Series, Ruiz tapped 
a ground ball up the third-base line for a walk-off infield single, the 
first in MLB history.[12] Ruiz noted, "I heard them cheering. And that's 
when I knew, 'Okay it's over' ... I'll take a win."[14] The Phillies eventually 
won the World Series for the first time since 1980, doing so in five games, 
the last of which began on October 27 and ended on October 29 after it 
was suspended part-way through due to rain.[15][16] For his performance 
in the playoffs, he earned the nickname "Señor Octubre" (Mr. October in 
Spanish).[1] Initially, Ruiz elected not to play in the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic, but after receiving a call from Martín Torrijos, the President 
of Panama, he agreed to play for the Panamanian team.[17] Early in the 
season, he suffered a muscle strain in his right oblique, which lost him 
playing time while on the disabled list.[4] Also early in the season, there 
was debate as to who should be the Phillies starting catcher, Ruiz or Chris 
Coste. Rob Neyer summarized the debate and ultimately endorsed Ruiz when 
he wrote, "It's Ruiz who has established himself as the superior hitter, 
almost solely because we expect him to draw more walks than Coste. Yes, 
Coste does have superior stats as a major leaguer ... But he is 36, and 
with a couple of exceptions he's not fared all that well in the high minors. 
Meanwhile, Ruis [sic] is six years younger and he's been relatively impressive 
in the high minors." Ultimately, Ruiz was the regular starter. He finished 
the season on a hot streak; over the last 24 games, he hit .355 with 9 
doubles, 1 home run, 11 RBIs, and .446 on-base percentage (OBP).[4] In 
late September, he missed a week of games with inflammation in his left 
wrist.[19] Despite his missed time, he started 100 games and set career 
highs in home runs (9) and base on balls (47), as well as posting a .255 
batting average and 43 RBIs.[4] Moreover, he walked more times than he 
struck out, a rare feat among modern major league hitters.[20] In the postseason, 
he led the team with a .341 batting average, and recorded a .491 OBP, having 
reached base in each of the Phillies' 15 games,[4] which perpetuated the 
usage of his nickname "Señor Octubre". Marcus Hayes of The Philadelphia 
Daily News wrote that Ruiz is "... the Phillies' Senor Octubre, a No. 8 
hitter who hits like John Buck in the regular season, then turns into Johnny 
Bench come autumn."[21] In 2010, Ruiz had a season filled with "indelible 
moments".[22] He was catcher for Roy Halladay's perfect game on May 29, 
2010 against the Florida Marlins and Halladay's no-hitter against the Cincinnati 
Reds in the first game of the National League Divisional Series on October 
6, 2010,[23] the first time a catcher had caught two no-hitters in one 
season since 1972.[24] On May 4, he hit a walk-off home run, the second 
of his career, to lead the Phillies over the St. Louis Cardinals.[25] Ruiz 
spent time on the DL in late June and early July with a concussion, but 
according to manager Charlie Manuel returned with a more efficient swing 
that allowed him to hit better against power pitchers.[22] He led the team 
with a .302 batting average and a .400 on-base percentage. Both statistics 
also led National League catchers,[4] and he even received a few votes 
for NL most valuable player.[26] During the 2010 postseason,[b] he did 
not perform as well as in past years—in nine games, he hit .192 with two 
home runs and four RBIs.[27] Fans voted Ruiz the "X-Factor Player of the 
Year" in MLB's This Year in Baseball Awards.[28] He also received the Pride 
of Philadelphia Award from the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame. Halladay 
called Ruiz a "rock" behind the plate, and presented him with a replica 
of his Cy Young Award.[29] Ruiz returned for the Phillies' 2011 season 
as their everyday starting catcher, and started 113 games, of which the 
Phillies won 70 (.619 winning percentage).[30] In May, he spent time on 
the DL with inflammation in his lower back.[30] Over the Phillies' final 
36 games, he posted a .342 batting average.[30] Overall, he finished with 
the best catcher's ERA in the major leagues (3.06), a .283 batting average, 
6 home runs, and 40 RBIs.[7][30] His batting average was second on the 
team trailing only Hunter Pence.[31] Ruiz began the 2012 season strongly, 
and throughout the season was a bright spot on an otherwise disappointing 
team.[32] Through June 27, he led the Major Leagues with a .364 average. 
This contributed to a stellar first half of the season earned him his first 
placement on the National League All-Star team. He was a reserve, though 
some analysts, including ESPN's John Kruk, felt his numbers warranted a 
starting nod, which ultimately went to the San Francisco Giants' Buster 
Posey through the fan voting.[33][34] Shortly after the announcement that 
he was an all-star, a piece in The Philadelphia Daily News entitled "The 
evolution of Carlos Ruiz" summarized his career: "Ruiz, though, was never 
a major prospect. He was a reserve catcher before he was a starting catcher. 
He was a bottom-of-the-order hitter before he was a middle-of-the-order 
hitter. And now, for the first time in his career, Carlos Ruiz is an All-Star."[35] 
After the all-star break, he spent over a month on the disabled list with 
plantar fasciitis, hindering his statistical totals, which at the time 
of his injury were among the best in the National League.[30] He led all 
NL catchers in doubles, en route to posting a .325 batting average with 
16 home runs and 68 RBIs, all of which were career highs.[30] He finished 
28th in MVP voting, the third consecutive season he had received votes.[7] 
On November 27, 2012, Ruiz was suspended for 25 games without pay by the 
MLB for testing positive for an amphetamine called Adderall. The suspension 
of Ruiz was effective at the start of the 2013 season.[36] Adderall is 
a drug prescribed for treating ADHD, described as a "central nervous system 
stimulant used to increase the attention span and decrease distractibility."[37] 
He made his 2013 season debut on April 28 against the New York Mets at 
Citi Field.[38] On May 20, he was placed on the DL with a Grade 2 strained 
hamstring.[39] He came back with a four-hit game, which tied his career 
high, against the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 18,[30] and hit .288 over 
the final two months of the season, commensurate with his past performance.[40] 
In the 2013 season, Ruiz compiled a .268 batting average, five home runs, 
and 37 RBIs in 92 games, his lowest major league total since 2006.[30] 
After the season, Ruiz became a free agent. He re-signed on November 21, 
2013 to a three-year contract worth US$26,000,000 plus a club option for 
a fourth season, giving the Phillies have an option to bring Ruiz back 
for a fourth season, at their discretion.[41] Though one writer suggested 
his 2013 year might just have been an "aberration",[42] most thought the 
Phillies overpaid to keep Ruiz, who turned 35 during the subsequent offseason.[43][44][45] 
Before the 2014 season, he received an exemption from MLB to use Adderall, 
an exemption given to nine percent of MLB players despite only four percent 
of the American population diagnosed with the condition.[46] After a slow 
start, Ruiz earned NL player of the week accolades in late April after 
he hit .500 during a Phillies' road trip.[47] He sustained a concussion 
on June 26 that forced him to go on the disabled list; he began a rehabilitation 
assignment on July 17 with the Clearwater Threshers.[48] On September 1, 
Ruiz was behind the plate for the combined no-hitter thrown by Cole Hamels, 
Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon in a 7-0 victory over the 
Atlanta Braves. It was the third no-hitter caught by Ruiz in his career, 
which ties him for second in Major League history behind Jason Varitek, 
who caught four.[49] In 2014, Ruiz played 110 games batting .252 with six 
home runs and 31 RBI, and overall, had "a fine season ... [that] shouldn’t 
get lost amid the many negatives."[50] On October 1, 2014, Ruiz underwent 
a minor arthroscopic shoulder surgery.[51] Cognizant of his increasing 
age and the wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's 
workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the 
regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen 
sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher.[52] 
On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the 
second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters 
when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs.[53] Overall, Ruiz lost 
his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many 
aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, 
including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst 
in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made 
several uncharacteristic errors.[54][55] The Phillies traded Ruiz to the 
Los Angeles Dodgers on August 25, 2016, with cash considerations for A. 
J. Ellis, Tommy Bergjans, and a player to be named later.[56] The player 
to be named later turned out to be Joey Curletta.[57] He backed up Yasmani 
Grandal with the Dodgers in September, appearing in 14 games and hitting 
.278.[7] He was also two for four as a pinch hitter with a three run home 
run in the 2016 National League Division Series.[7] Following the 2016 
season, Ruiz was traded to the Mariners for pitcher Vidal Nuño.[58] Offensively, 
Ruiz developed from a "bottom-of-the-order hitter", to a patient hitter 
inclined to work the count, and finally to a hitter with solid gap-to-gap 
power.[35][60][61] Ruiz has strong plate discipline that helps him draw 
walks and avoid strikeouts; he has almost as many walks as strikeouts over 
the course of his career, a rarity in the modern era of baseball.[20] However, 
as his career progressed and he hit more towards the middle of the lineup, 
he has taken a more aggressive approach at the plate, and consequently 
he has struck out more often, but his home run totals have also increased.[7][60] 
In 2014, his versatility and production at the plate encouraged his manager, 
Ryne Sandberg, to utilize him in various spots ranging from second through 
seventh in the batting order.[62] At the prime of his career, he was among 
the best hitting catchers in MLB.[2] Entering 2014, Ruiz had stolen only 
16 bases over his first eight seasons;[7] he had never been particularly 
fast, which initially caused his conversion from infielder to catcher,[2] 
but because of his "hustle" on the basepaths, he won the Major League Baseball 
Players Alumni Association Heart and Hustle Award in 2012.[63] When catching, 
Ruiz seeks to become "one" with the day's pitcher; he takes their successes 
and failures personally, refusing to blame pitchers, and accepts equal 
responsibility.[1] Phillies pitchers trust Ruiz and his ability to call 
games, and this ability's improvement has coincided with his increased 
proficiency in English.[2] Cole Hamels attributes Ruiz's prowess in calling 
games to astute preparation, commenting, "I think he's very aware of what 
the hitter is trying to do in each count. He gives you a good target. It's 
almost like he understands what you're thinking and he's speaking to you 
without saying anything. ... If a catcher can help you, it makes your job 
so much easier and he can do that so well."[64] Ruiz realizes the importance 
of his role with the Phillies, opining, "It's the catcher's job to bring 
energy and happiness to the game."[1] Ruiz has a good throwing arm that 
has improved over the years;[2][65] over the course of his career he has 
thrown out 29% of attempted base stealers, which is exactly the average 
percentage of hitters thrown out by catchers.[7] A Sports Illustrated piece 
featuring Ruiz published in July 2011 encapsulated Ruiz's role as "heart 
and soul" of the team: The most silent and timid Phillie might even become—by 
consensus of teammates and in the words of closer Brad Lidge—"the heart 
and soul of this team." The player who was the runaway winner in a team 
poll asking Phillies whom—if they were Batman—they'd choose as their Robin, 
proving that his effect extends far beyond his superhero pitching staff. 
The player who circulated in the clubhouse asking them how their families 
were doing, and how their hearts and minds and bodies felt. The man who 
went to each player in the dugout as each game was about to start to exchange 
a new touch: knuckles yesterday, low-fives today, fist pounds to their 
hearts tomorrow, so hard that they'd yearn for his chest protector. The 
one who tore into them when they were lax and verbalized what team leaders 
Chase Utley and Halladay kept tight under wraps. The one taking charge 
as if he has been here forever and yet still asking questions as if he 
has just been called up. The most endearing player to the sold-out crowds 
at Citizens Bank Park every night, even when his average dips to .255, 
as it has this season, crossing a cultural moat that Hispanic players often 
can't—the Phillie whom bartender Tubby Kushner impersonates every game 
he attends, from uniform down to the shin guards, chest protector, mask 
and, yes, even cup—because fans feel like he's their little secret, their 
little golden nugget. He is a favorite among Phillies fans, and crossed 
"a cultural moat that Hispanic players often can't" to endear himself to 
not only the fan base, but also his teammates.[1][66] Before games, he 
humorously imitates teammates to help keep the team loose and relaxed, 
furthering his role as a leader.[1] Overall, Ruiz "is a man who refuses 
to conceal his emotions", positive or negative, and serves as a constant
