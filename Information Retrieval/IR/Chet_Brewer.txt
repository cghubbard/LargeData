Chester Arthur "Chet" Brewer (January 14, 1907 â€“ March 26, 1990) was an 
American right-handed pitcher in baseball's Negro Leagues. Born in Leavenworth, 
Kansas, he played for the Kansas City Monarchs, and from 1957 to 1974 he 
scouted for the Pittsburgh Pirates.[2] Brewer toiled on the mounds of black 
baseball for twenty-four years with an assortment of teams throughout the 
world, including China, Japan, the Philippines, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, 
Panama, Puerto Rico, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and in forty-four of the forty-eight 
continental United States. While with the Kansas City Monarchs, he was 
a part of legendary starting rotations including Satchel Paige and Bullet 
Rogan. Brewer had a lively fastball and a devastating overhand "drop ball," 
which was especially tough on left-handed hitters. He also threw a scuffed 
baseball, known as an "emery ball" (learned from Emory Osborne and Ted 
"Double Duty" Radcliffe.[3]) when such practice was legal.[4] Brewer's 
career covered a wide experiential range, including playing against major 
leaguers in exhibition games. In 1934 he pitched against an all-star team 
that included Jimmie Foxx and Heinie Manush, and later was manager of the 
Kansas City Royals, who played in the California Winter League against 
Bob Feller and other major leaguers.[3] In 1945, he managed the Kansas 
City Royals of the California Winter League, coaching among other players 
a young Jackie Robinson, already destined for the Brooklyn Dodgers' organization.[5]
