Joseph Wilbur "Billy Joe" Adcock (October 30, 1927 – May 3, 1999) was a 
major league baseball player and manager in the Major and Minor Leagues. 
He was best known as a first baseman and right-handed slugger with the 
powerful Milwaukee Braves teams of the 1950s, whose career included numerous 
home run feats. A sure-handed defensive player, he also retired with the 
third highest career fielding percentage by a first baseman (.994). His 
nickname "Billy Joe" was modeled after Vanderbilt University basketball 
star "Billy Joe Adcock" and was popularized by Vin Scully. Born in Coushatta, 
the seat of Red River Parish in northwestern Louisiana, Adcock attended 
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he played on the baseball 
team; before college, he had never played a game of baseball in his life.[1] 
He was signed by the Cincinnati Reds, but Ted Kluszewski had firm hold 
of the team's first base slot. Adcock played in left field from 1950 to 
1952, but was unhappy and demanded a trade, which he received. His first 
season with the Braves was capped by a mammoth home run into the center 
field bleachers at the Polo Grounds on April 29, 1953, a feat that had 
never been done before and would only be accomplished twice more, by Hank 
Aaron and Lou Brock. On July 31, 1954, Adcock accomplished the rare feat 
of homering four times in a single game, against the Brooklyn Dodgers at 
Ebbets Field. He also hit a double off the top of the wall to set a record 
for most total bases in a game (18)[2][3] that stood for 48 years, until 
broken by Shawn Green in 2002.[4] Another notable home run was the blast 
that ended the epic duel between Lew Burdette and Harvey Haddix on May 
26, 1959, in which Haddix took a perfect game into the 13th inning. Adcock 
did not get credit for a home run, however, because Aaron – who was on 
first base – saw Félix Mantilla, the runner ahead of him, score the winning 
run and thought the hit had only been a double and walked back to the dugout, 
causing Adcock to be called out for passing him on the base paths. (Eventually, 
the ruling was that instead of a 3-run home run for a 3–0 Braves victory, 
Adcock got a double and 1 RBI, and the Braves won 1–0.)[5] Adcock was often 
overshadowed both by his own teammates Aaron and Eddie Mathews, and by 
the other slugging first basemen in the league, Kluszewski and Gil Hodges, 
but he did make one All-Star team (1960) and was regularly among the league 
leaders in home runs. In 1956, he finished second in the National League 
in home runs, runs batted in, and slugging average. After concluding his 
playing career with the Cleveland Indians (1963) and Los Angeles/California 
Angels (1964–66), Adcock managed the Cleveland Indians for one year (1967), 
with the team registering its worst percentage finish in 21 years (.463, 
vs. .442 in 1946), finishing eighth in a 10-team league. Following the 
season he was replaced as Cleveland manager by Alvin Dark.[6] Adcock managed 
two more years in the minor leagues before settling down at his 288-acre 
(1.2 km2) ranch in Coushatta to raise horses. He died in Coushatta at age
