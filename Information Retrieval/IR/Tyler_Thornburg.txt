Tyler Michael Thornburg (born September 29, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He made his MLB debut on June 19, 2012. Prior to beginning his professional 
career, he played college baseball for the Charleston Southern Buccaneers. 
When Thornburg was a 12-year-old, he played as an outfielder in little 
league baseball for the Sandy Springs All-Stars, which won the Georgia 
state championship,[1] and reached the 2001 Southeast Regional final of 
the Little League World Series by pitching Sandy Springs past Vienna (VA) 
American 1-0.[2] Thornburg attended Riverwood High School, where he played 
for the school's baseball team.[3] He then enrolled in Charleston Southern 
University, where he played college baseball for the Charleston Southern 
Buccaneers, a member of the Big South Conference within the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association's Division I. With the Buccaneers, Thornburg played 
as a pitcher and outfielder.[4] In 2010, he was twice named the Big South 
Conference's pitcher of the week.[5] In the summer of 2008, he played collegiate 
summer baseball for the Winchester Royals of the Valley Baseball League, 
winning the league's Most Valuable Player award.[6] He played for the Brewster 
Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League in the summer of 2009.[7] The 
Brewers drafted Thornburg in the third round, with the 96th overall selection, 
of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft.[4] He signed with the Brewers 
and pitched that year for the Helena Brewers in the Rookie-level Pioneer 
League. Thornburg began the 2011 season Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the 
Class A Midwest League, receiving a promotion to the Brevard County Manatees 
of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL).[8] Thornburg had a 
7–0 win–loss record and 1.50 earned run average (ERA) with Wisconsin,[9][10] 
and represented the Timber Rattlers in the Midwest League All-Star Game.[11] 
He was named FSL pitcher of the week in his first week after the promotion.[12] 
Thornburg participated in the 2011 All-Star Futures Game.[13] MLB.com ranked 
Thornburg as the Brewers' fourth best prospect heading into the 2012 season.[14] 
The Brewers assigned Thornburg to the Huntsville Stars of the Class AA 
Southern League.[15] He had an 8–1 record with a 3.00 ERA in 13 games started, 
and was named the Brewers' minor league pitcher of the month for May 2012.[16] 
He was also selected to appear in the Southern League All-Star Game.[17] 
Instead of making an All-Star Game appearance, the Brewers promoted Thornburg 
to the major leagues to make his debut for the Brewers on June 19, 2012 
against the Toronto Blue Jays. He was called up to make an emergency start, 
for the injured Shaun Marcum.[17] In his debut, Thorburg allowed back-to-back-to-back 
home runs to Colby Rasmus, José Bautista, and Edwin Encarnación [18] He 
also collected his first major-league hit with a double to left center 
in his first major-league at bat.[19] He was assigned to the Nashville 
Sounds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League after the game.[20] Thornburg 
appeared in 3 games with the Brewers during spring training in 2013, but 
was cut on March 11 and assigned to Nashville. Thornburg was the Sounds' 
Opening Day starter, pitching 5 innings and giving up 1 run, earning a 
no-decision. On June 5, Thornburg was recalled, replacing the injured Marco 
Estrada.[21] At the time, Thornburg was 0-7 with a 6.75 ERA in 12 starts. 
He made his 2013 major league debut that day against Oakland, pitching 
2 scoreless innings of relief in the 6-1 loss. He recorded his first win 
in his next appearance, pitching 2 scoreless innings against Philadelphia 
on June 8. After the game, Thornburg was optioned back to Nashville, when 
Jim Henderson was activated off the disabled list. Thornburg made 3 more 
starts with Nashville before being recalled on June 29, replacing Caleb 
Gindl. He spent the rest of the season with Milwaukee, and pitched in 16 
games (7 starts). In 18 games (7 starts) with the Brewers, Thornburg went 
3-1 with a 2.03 ERA, striking out 48 in 66.2 innings. In 2014, Thornburg 
began the season in the Brewers' bullpen before suffering a season-ending 
elbow injury. Thornburg spent most of the 2015 season in AAA regaining 
his arm strength. Prior to the 2016 season, the Brewers decided to make 
Thornburg a full-time reliever rather than the swing man role he had occupied 
up to that point in his career.[22] Thornburg became the Brewers' setup-man 
and displayed career-best fastball velocity, reaching as high as 96 mph 
with his heater. He set the Brewers franchise record for consecutive innings 
without allowing a baserunner for a relief pitcher.[23] Thornburg has a 
91-96 MPH fastball. Due to his velocity, size, over-the-top delivery, and 
repertoire, he has drawn favorable comparisons to Tim Lincecum.[2] He throws 
two off-speed pitches, including a strong power curveball in the upper-70s, 
and a sinking change-up in the low-80s.[24] As a late-inning reliever/closer, 
Thornburg's fastball is consistently thrown around 94-97 MPH. His curveball
