The Topeka Golden Giants, also known as Goldsby's Golden Giants, was a 
minor league baseball team located in Topeka, Kansas. The team, which lasted 
for just one season, played in the Western League. The Golden Giants posted 
a 90-25 record (.783) in their one season of operation, winning the Western 
League title by 15 games over the second-place Lincoln Tree-Planters.[1][2] 
On April 10, 1887, the Golden Giants also won an exhibition game from the 
defending World Series champions, the St. Louis Browns (the present-day 
Cardinals), by a score of 12-9.[3] The Western League of that era is classified 
as a minor league circuit, but the Golden Giants' players were mostly major 
leaguers. The roster included the player-manager Walt Goldsby, an outfielder 
who played in the majors in 1886 and returned to the majors for the 1888 
season (with the Baltimore Orioles). First baseman Dan Stearns led the 
league in hits, and Jimmy Macullar led the league in batting average. Both 
Stearns and Macullar had previously played for the Baltimore Orioles through 
1885, and had also teamed up on the championship 1882 Cincinnati Red Stockings. 
A number of other players had major league experience including: outfielder 
Bug Holliday, who led the league in home runs; pitcher Tom Sullivan, who 
led the league in wins with 36; Jim Conway; Perry Werden; Joe Gunson; Joe
