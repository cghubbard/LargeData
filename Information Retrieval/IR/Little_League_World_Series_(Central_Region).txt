The Central Region was a region that competed in the Little League World 
Series between 1957 and 2000 until it was split into the Midwest and Great 
Lakes regions in 2001. The Central Region only produced one World Champion, 
in 1959, when Hamtramck, Michigan defeated Auburn, California 12-0 in the 
Final. The Central Region was inaugurated in 1957 (named the North Division 
from 1957–1973)) when the LLWS first gave out Series berths to Regional 
winners.[1] The Region consisted of teams from the Dakotas, Illinois, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Ohio, 
and Wisconsin. In 2000, Kentucky replaced Oklahoma in the region. Little 
League Baseball expanded the LLWS to sixteen teams for the 2001 Little 
League World Series. The Central Region was split into the Midwest region 
– the Dakotas, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, and Nebraska – and the 
Great Lakes region – Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin.
