Kennesaw State University fields 17 varsity athletics teams which are called 
the Owls. After spending ten years in Division II's Peach Belt Conference, 
the university fully transitioned to Division I status in the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association at the beginning of the 2009–10 season. 
All of Kennesaw State's sports teams compete in the Atlantic Sun Conference, 
except for the football team, which is an associate member of the Big South 
Conference. The school mascot is Scrappy the Owl. Kennesaw State's athletic 
department was founded in 1983, and initially offered nine sports: women’s 
basketball, men’s soccer, men’s & women’s cross country, and men’s & women’s 
track and field. The program first began competition in the Georgia Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference, part of the NAIA. In just 23 years, the school has 
transitioned to a full NCAA Division I program. A member of the Atlantic 
Sun Conference, Kennesaw State sponsors teams in eight men's and ten women's 
NCAA sanctioned sports:[2] Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate 
Sports In their short history, the Owls have had 32 players who have been 
drafted by MLB teams. Five of their alumni have reached the Major Leagues, 
including Jason Jones of the Texas Rangers, Chad Jenkins of the Toronto 
Blue Jays, Brett Campbell of the Washington Nationals, and Willie Harris, 
who earned a World Series ring with the Chicago White Sox in 2005, of the 
Cincinnati Reds.[citation needed] In 2014, Max Pentecost won the Johnny 
Bench Award as the best catcher in NCAA's Division I.[3] In 2009, six Kennesaw 
State players were selected in the MLB Draft. Chad Jenkins was selected 
by the Toronto Blue Jays with their first round pick (20th overall). Kyle 
Heckathorn was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers with their supplemental 
first round pick at 47th overall. Jace Whitmer (Oakland Athletics), Kenny 
Faulk (Detroit Tigers), Tyler Stubblefield (Atlanta Braves), and Justin 
Edwards (Cincinnati Reds) were also selected by MLB teams. Kennesaw State's 
baseball team began play in 1984 as an NAIA program. Jim Nash was the team's 
first head coach, and led them to a 30-20 record. In 1985, the Owls hired 
John Barrett to act as head coach. In his only year, he took the team all 
the way to the NCAA District 25 Tournament with a 31-24 record. The following 
year, the Owls again hired a new coach, this time tabbing Chip Reese to 
lead the way. Coach Reese was with the Owls for 5 season (1986-1990). During 
his tenure with the Owls, they competed in the NCAA District 25 Tournament 
four times, and carried an overall record of 145-126-2. Steve Givens was 
the next Owls head coach in 1991, and in his only season the team went 
35-25 and made yet another appearance in the NAIA District 25 Tournament. 
Starting in 1992, the Owls gained some head coaching stability with the 
hiring of Mike Sansing. The Owls experienced an immediate improvement when 
Sansing was hired, and finished the 1992 season with a record of 39-19, 
and an appearance in the NAIA Tournament. The first major success for the 
program came in 1994, when the Owls completed the regular season with a 
then school-high record of 48 wins. They then proceeded to go undefeated 
throughout the entire postseason (12-0), beating Southeastern Oklahoma 
State University in the NAIA World Series final. In the year following 
their NAIA Championship, the Owls moved up to Division II, and joined the 
Peach Belt Conference. The Owls adjusted to the competition, and won their 
conference with a 19-4 record (43-14 overall). The Owls also made it to 
the NCAA South Atlantic Regional after winning the Peach Belt Tournament 
with a 5-0 record. After their success in 1995, they followed it in 1996. 
Instead of getting stalled during the NCAA South Atlantic Regional again, 
the Owls beat Columbus State three game to one, and moved on to the NCAA 
Division II World Series in Montgomery, AL. During the World Series, Kennesaw 
State defeated Southern Colorado 9-3, Adelphi 8-7, Delta State 3-1, and 
finally, defeated St. Joseph's 4-0 in the championship game. Following 
their 1996 National Championship, Kennesaw had additional postseason appearances 
from 1997-2005. From 1997-1999, the Owls made three straight appearances 
in the Division II World Series, losing each time in the finals or semi-finals. 
During the 2000-2005 seasons, Kennesaw State racked up 238-112 record, 
and made the postseason five more times, with an appearance in the Division 
II World Series in 2003. The program transitioned to Division I in 2006. 
They began play in the Atlantic Sun conference, and during the mandatory 
four-year reclassification period, the Owls notched 116 wins, two second 
place conference finishes and had eight players selected in the Major League 
Baseball Draft. In the 2011 campaign, the Owls had a big win when they 
defeated No. 8 Georgia Tech at Stillwell Stadium in front of 1,142 fans. 
In 2012, the Owls had their most successful postseason campaign in Division 
I, making it all the way to the A-Sun Championship game against Belmont 
where they lost 10-4. In the 2013 season, the Owls made it to the Atlantic 
Sun Championship again and were defeated by East Tennessee State University 
7-2. The 2014 season has been the best season for KSU baseball, by far. 
The Owls won their first A-Sun Championship in 2014 by beating Lipscomb 
7-1. They then proceeded to their first NCAA Regional and won in Tallahassee. 
The Owls moved on to the Super Regional, but lost to Louisville in two 
games. Beginning in the 1985-86 season, the Kennesaw State Owls basketball 
teams began play as an NAIA team, competing in the GIAC conference. The 
Owls were led by head coach Phil Zenoni during their tenure in NAIA, where 
they compiled a 145-122 record. The Kennesaw State Owls basketball teams 
currently play NCAA Division I basketball in the Atlantic Sun Conference. 
The team was formed in the Convocation Center on the campus of KSU. The 
teams previously played in the Spec Landrum Center, which served as the 
home floor when the men won the NCAA Division II National Championship 
in 2004. On April 20, 2011 Kennesaw State University officials named Lewis 
Preston as the Owls new Head Men’s Basketball Coach. Preston, an assistant 
to Penn State’s Ed DeChellis for the past three years, also served as an 
assistant to Florida’s Billy Donovan when the Gators won the National Championship 
in 2007 and was a member of Mike Brey’s staff at Notre Dame. Preston took 
a leave of absence in January 2014 citing personal and medial reasons.[4] 
Preston was replaced by Jimmy Lallathin on an interim basis for the remainder 
of the 2013-14 season. In March 2014 Lallathin was promoted to permanent 
head coach.[5] After going 10-22 in his only season in charge of the program, 
Lallathin was reassigned within the athletics department and eventually 
removed as head coach as the result of an internal investigation. On April 
26, 2015 Kennesaw State reached an agreement with former National Coach 
of the Year and Boston College head man, Al Skinner to be their sixth head 
coach in program history.[6] Skinner led the Owls to an 11-20 record in 
his first season but went 7-7 in conference for the first .500 conference 
record in Kennesaw State Division I history. [7] The Lady Owls have now 
been coached by Nitra Perry for four years, to date in the 2015-16 season. 
Perry began coaching in the 2012-13 season. Interestingly, the Lady Owls 
had their worst year in 2013-14, before having their most Division I wins 
in 2014-15. Kennesaw State's men's cross country team is currently coached 
by Stan Sims. In the 2009 season, the Owls finished first in five of their 
eight meets, including a first-place finish in their conference at the 
A-Sun Cross Country Championship. The men ended the 2009 season finishing 
eighth at the NCAA South Region Championship. The women's team finished 
first in four of their seven meets in the 2009 season. The women finished 
second in their conference at the A-Sun Cross Country Championship. The 
Cross Country team was also featured in an article of the September, 2010 
issue of Running Times magazine. In the 2010 season, the team made it, 
for the second straight year since being eligible for postseason competition, 
to the NCAA South Regional where they finished ninth.[8] The Kennesaw State 
men’s golf team opened its fall season in 2011 with the first round of 
the Carpet Capital Collegiate Classic to finish in 12th place.[9] Kennesaw 
State started women's soccer in 2002. In their first year of competition 
the school finished 18-0-1 and earned a trip to the national tournament. 
The following year Kennesaw State won the Division II National Championship. 
2004 was the start of the transition to Division I and during the 2006 
season, the Owls won the Atlantic Sun Conference regular season title. 
After winning their second straight A-Sun title in 2007, the Owls made 
their first appearance in the NCAA Women's Soccer Championships, falling 
to Florida State, 3-0, in the first round. On November 5, 2009 the KSU 
Owls defeated Jacksonville in overtime. This win put the Owls in the finals 
versus Belmont on November 7, 2009. In the finals, Jade Dempster found 
the net with a penalty-kick goal in the 87th minute lifting Kennesaw State 
to its second Atlantic Sun Women’s Soccer Championship in three seasons 
with a 2–1 victory against Belmont. The Owls earn the conference’s automatic 
bid to the 2009 NCAA tournament. The Owls opened a new home in 2010. KSU 
and the Atlanta Beat of Women's Professional Soccer entered into a public-private 
partnership to build the new Kennesaw State University Soccer Stadium, 
now known as Fifth Third Bank Stadium, near the KSU campus. Both the Owls 
and the Beat play all their home games in the facility, which opened on 
May 2, 2010.[10] The stadium was host to the 2011 NCAA Women's College 
Cup.[11] The softball program was founded in the Fall of 1983 by Gary Wiseman, 
with the intent to compete in both Slowpitch and Fastpitch. The program 
instead began as Slowpitch only, and lasted that way until 1990. The Lady 
Owls began intercollegiate softball in 1985, with head coach Medra Ashmore 
leading the way. She led the Owls to a 75-24 record in her two-year tenure, 
and also captured the NAIA District 25 Championship in 1986. In 1987, Scott 
Whitlock, a man who would become one of the all-time winningest coaches 
in NCAA history, began coaching the Lady Owls. In his first year with the 
Owls, Whitlock guided the team to a 36-5 record, and captured the Georgia 
Conference Championship. Whitlock had much of the same success in NAIA 
competition in 1989 and 1990 as well, leading the Owls to a 40-4 record 
in 1989 (winning the Georgia Conference Championship for the second year 
in a row), and a 33-2 record in 1990, where they captured their second 
NAIA District 25 Championship. Following the 1990 season, the Owls made 
a seamless transition from competing in Slowpitch to Fastpitch. They went 
on to a 41-11 record in 1991 and made an appearance in the NAIA World Series 
that year. The following three years (1992-1994), the Owls dominated their 
conference again, with records of 46-8 (1992), 41-6 (1993), and 48-4 (1994). 
In their four years as a fastpitch NAIA program, the Owls appeared in the 
NAIA National Tournament every year, and also won the NAIA Tri-District 
10 Tournament all four years as well. The team joined the Peach Belt Conference 
in 1993, but did not keep a conference record and still competed in the 
NAIA postseason in the 1993-94 season. In 1995, the Lady Owls jumped from 
NAIA to NCAA Division II, where they competed in the Peach Belt Conference. 
In their first year of competition at the Division II level, the Owls posted 
a 53-5 record, en route to winning the NCAA Division II National Championship. 
They followed this performance in 1996, going 49-8, and won back to back 
NCAA Division II Championships. From 1997-2005, the Owls made seven more 
appearances in the NCAA Division II World Series (1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 
2002, 2004, 2005) and finishing as the runner up in 2000. With all of their 
success in Division II, the Owls moved up to the NCAA's highest classification 
starting with the 2006 season and began competing in the Atlantic Sun Conference. 
In their first year of Division I play, the Owls went 38–17 and tied for 
second in the Atlantic Sun. The following year (2007), they went 44–20 
and captured the regular season Atlantic Sun Championship. From 2008–2011, 
the Owls have combined to go 112–100, and have produced a winning record 
in every season except 2009. The Kennesaw State track men's track team 
won the Indoor & Outdoor Conference Championships in 2008 and 2010. Formerly 
an assistant for Kansas State, Andy Eggerth was named the new head coach 
of Kennesaw State Track and Field in fall of 2010 and was named A-Sun Coach 
of the Year for 2011. In the 2010 season, the volleyball team won nine 
out of 10 Atlantic Sun Conference matches, finished in second in the A-Sun, 
and had four student-athletes receive All-Conference Honors. Head Coach 
Karen Weatherington was named A-Sun Coach of the Year. The Owls flew into 
the A-Sun Championships, where a bye moved the Owls into the semifinals 
for the first time in program history.[12] Kennesaw State University President 
Daniel S. Papp and KSU Director of Athletics Vaughn Williams announced 
the addition of women’s lacrosse as the university’s 17th NCAA Division 
I championship sport, with intercollegiate competition beginning in the 
spring of 2013. The Kennesaw State Owls women’s lacrosse program will compete 
in the Atlantic Sun Conference, which will be sponsoring the sport for 
the first time beginning in 2013. The Owls have been members of the conference 
since the fall of 2005, with all 16 of Kennesaw State’s existing varsity 
sports competing for A-Sun championships. The addition of women's lacrosse 
at KSU fulfills a commitment made to the Atlantic Sun Conference when Kennesaw 
State joined the A-Sun in 2005, at which time KSU officials agreed to add 
a new sport to the Athletic Department’s offerings. At the university’s 
request, the A-Sun has granted KSU several delays, however now it is time 
for the university to begin launching the new sport.[13] Kennesaw State 
has considered adding a football team at various points in its history. 
Future plans for the school include a football stadium. The school has 
concluded a feasibility survey which affirmed it would be possible to have 
Division I football. On November 9, 2007, a survey was administered by 
Student Government with 77.6 percent of respondents voting in favor of 
starting a football program. Participation in the survey was supposed to 
be restricted to enrolled students only; however, due to a design flaw, 
anyone could take the survey an unlimited number of times.[14] Kennesaw 
State convened a football committee in late 2009, consisting of students, 
faculty, staff, alumni, business and community leaders, as well as friends 
and benefactors of KSU. The group, led by former University of Georgia 
football coach and athletic director Vince Dooley,[15] provided a final 
report of its recommendations to KSU President Daniel Papp in September 
2010.[16] The results of the report were released in a September 15, 2010 
press conference, featuring Papp and Dooley, at the KSU Convocation Center.[17] 
It was announced that the school would plan to launch a football program 
at the FCS level in 2014, with the team playing home games at KSU Soccer 
Stadium.[15] As of July 1, 2015, the KSU football program competes as members 
of the Big South Conference since the Atlantic Sun does not sponsor football. 
As a Division II school, Kennesaw State won five national championships 
in four sports: Baseball (1996), Men's Basketball (2004), Women's Soccer 
(2003) and Softball (1995, 1996). As a Division I NCAA school, Kennesaw 
State was the 2012 runner-up in the Atlantic Sun Baseball Championship.
