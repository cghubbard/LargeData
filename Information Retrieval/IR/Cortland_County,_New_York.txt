Cortland County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of 
the 2010 census, the population of Cortland County was 49,336.[1] The county 
seat is Cortland.[2] The county is named after Pierre Van Cortlandt, president 
of the convention at Kingston that wrote the first New York State Constitution 
in 1777, and first lieutenant governor of the state. Cortland County comprises 
the Cortland, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included 
in the Ithaca-Cortland, NY Combined Statistical Area. The Cortland apple 
is named for the county. Located in the glaciated Appalachian Plateau area 
of Central New York, midway between Syracuse and Binghamton, this predominantly 
rural county is the southeastern gateway to the Finger Lakes Region. Scattered 
archaeological evidence indicates the Iroquois also known as the Haudenosaunee 
controlled the area beginning about AD 1500. What was to become Cortland 
County remained within Indian territory until the American Revolution. 
It became part of the Military Tract, when, in 1781, more than 1¼ million 
acres (5,100 km²) were set aside by the State's Legislature to compensate 
two regiments formed to protect the State's western section from the English 
and their Iroquois allies, at the close of the Revolution. To encourage 
settlement in the upstate isolated wilderness, the State constructed a 
road from Oxford through Cortland County to Cayuga Lake in 1792-94. This, 
and construction of privately financed roads, were the major impetus to 
settlement. When counties were established in New York in 1683, the present 
Cortland County was part of Albany County, which encompassed the northern 
part of New York and all of the present State of Vermont, as well as indeterminate 
territory to west. On March 12, 1772, present day Cortland County became 
part of Tryon County, named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New 
York. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary 
War, the name of the county was changed to honor General Richard Montgomery, 
who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture 
the city of Quebec, thus replacing the name of the locally unpopular British 
governor. Present day Cortland County became part of Herkimer County in 
1791, then became a part of Onondaga County when it split from Herkimer 
in 1794. Cortland County was formed by the splitting of Onondaga County 
in 1808. Eastern New Yorkers and New Englanders, wanting new land to farm, 
welcomed the opening of this frontier. The first white settlement in the 
county was made in 1791 by Amos Todd, Joseph Beebe and Rhoda Todd Beebe, 
emigrants from Connecticut who paddled up the Tioughnioga River from Windsor, 
to live near the head of navigation in the Town of Homer. Following them 
came a flood of settlers who, in 1808, petitioned the State Legislature 
for county status. Thus, Cortland County was created from the southern 
half of Onondaga County as part of the Boston Ten Towns on April 8, 1808, 
and was named in honor of the Pierre Van Cortlandt family - Pierre, Sr. 
having been the first lieutenant governor of the state. The 76th New York 
Volunteer Infantry was one of the most famous of the New York units in 
the Civil War. It was raised in 1861 primarily from Cortland County and 
the surrounding areas (about a third of the men were from the Cherry Valley 
area). The 76th was in most of the major battles the Army of the Potomac 
fought from Second Bull Run through Petersburg, at which time the three-year 
enlistment of most of the men ran out and the 300 or so men remaining from 
the 1,100 who left Cortland either returned home or transferred to other 
units. At the Battle of Gettysburg, the 76th New York was one of the first 
infantry regiments on the field, holding down the extreme right of the 
Union line on the first day. The regiment took huge casualties in that 
battle - nearly one-third of its strength - including its commander Major 
Andrew J. Grover, the first infantry officer killed in the battle. The 
Cortland Baking Company (COBAKCO) was the first bakery east of the Mississippi 
River to make enriched breads, wrap loaves in cellophane and sell pre-sliced 
white, wheat and rye bread. They invented the phrase "the greatest thing 
since sliced bread". (ref-cortlandtourism.com) Today, Cortland county is 
noted for the production of CNC milling machines; hospitality supplies; 
medical instruments and components; textiles; electrical components; plastic 
consumer goods; components for NASA and a variety of other goods and services. 
International exporting is an integral part of many of the corporations 
in the area. The county's present reflects its past. Agri-business flourishes 
yet, consistent with the pattern elsewhere in New York State, the number 
of farms has declined while farm size and yield have increased. Continued 
growth in the service and light industry sectors is contributing to the 
growing strength of the Central New York region and the Southern Tier region. 
The loss of many of its local businesses has led to the current economic 
decline of the region. Cornell University, Syracuse University, State University 
of New York Binghamton and Ithaca College are all within an easy 45 minute 
drive of the City of Cortland. The State University College at Cortland 
and Tompkins Cortland Community College are located in the county. Cortland
