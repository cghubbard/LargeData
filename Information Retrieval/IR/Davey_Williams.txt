David Carlous Williams (November 2, 1927 – August 17, 2009) Williams graduated 
from Sunset High School in Dallas, Texas in 1945. He was an All-Star second 
baseman who played his entire career for the New York Giants of the National 
League. Listed at 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m), 160 lb., Williams batted and threw 
right-handed. He was born in Dallas, Texas. Williams entered the majors 
with the Giants in 1949, playing for them in part of that season and from 
1951 through 1955. His most productive season came in 1952, when he posted 
career-numbers in home runs (13), runs (70), RBI (48) and extrabases (42), 
while hitting a .254 batting average in 138 games. In 1953, he hit a career-high 
.297, earned a selection on the NL All-Star team, and was a member of the 
1954 World Series champions. In a six-season career, Williams was a .252 
hitter (450-for-1785) with 32 home runs and 163 RBI in 517 games, including 
235 runs, 163 RBI, 61 doubles, 10 triples and six stolen bases. A good 
contact, free swinger hitter, he collected 164 walks and 144 strikeouts 
in 1993 appearances at the plate. At second base, he recorded a .978 fielding 
percentage (52 errors in 2323 chances). Williams's playing career was cut 
short when he was never able to fully recover after injuring his back in 
a collision with Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers, as Williams covered 
first base on Robinson bunt. Robinson later said that his intended target 
on the play had actually been Giant pitcher Sal Maglie. Maglie had angered 
the Dodgers by throwing several pitches high and inside on Dodger hitters, 
so Robinson had bunted specifically looking for the opportunity to crash 
into Maglie on the play. However, Maglie didn't cover first base as Robinson 
had expected, so instead, it was Williams who took the brunt of Robinson's 
charge. Following his playing career, Williams coached for the Giants in 
the 1956 and 1957 seasons. Williams died in his home town of Dallas, Texas,
