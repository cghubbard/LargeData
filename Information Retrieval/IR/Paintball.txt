Paintball is a game developed in the 1980s in which players eliminate opponents 
from play by hitting them with dye-filled, breakable, oil and gelatin paintballs, 
or pellets, usually shot from a carbon dioxide or compressed air (Nitrogen) 
powered “paintball marker”. The game is regularly played at a sporting 
level with organized competition involving major tournaments, professional 
teams, and players.[2][3] Paintball technology is also used by military 
forces, law enforcement, para-military and security organizations to supplement 
military training, as well as playing a role in riot response, and non-lethal 
suppression of dangerous suspects. Games can be played on indoor or outdoor 
fields of varying sizes. A game field is scattered with natural or artificial 
terrain, which players use for tactical cover. Game types in paintball 
vary, but can include capture the flag, elimination, ammunition limits, 
defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing objects 
of interest hidden in the playing area. Depending on the variant played, 
games can last from seconds to hours, or even days in scenario play. The 
legality of paintball varies among countries and regions. In most areas 
where regulated play is offered, players are required to wear protective 
masks, and game rules are strictly enforced. The paintball equipment used 
may depend on the game type, for example: woodsball, speedball, or scenario; 
on how much money one is willing to spend on equipment; and personal preference. 
However, almost every player will utilize three basic pieces of equipment: 
Additional equipment, commonly seen among frequent players, tournament 
participants, and professional players include: Paintball is played with 
a potentially limitless variety of rules and variations, which are specified 
before the game begins. The most basic game rule is that players must attempt 
to accomplish a goal without being shot and marked with a paintball. A 
variety of different rules govern the legality of a hit, ranging from "anything 
counts" (hits cause elimination whether the paintball broke and left a 
mark or not) to the most common variation: the paintball must break and 
leave a mark the size of a US quarter or larger. Eliminated players are 
expected to leave the field of play; eliminations may also earn the opposing 
team points.[8][9] Depending on the agreed upon game rules, the player 
may return to the field and continue playing, or is eliminated from the 
game completely. The particular goal of the game is determined before play 
begins; examples include capture the flag[10] or Elimination.[11] Paintball 
has spawned popular variants, including woodsball, which is played in the 
natural environment and spans across a large area.[12] Conversely, the 
variant of speedball is played on a smaller field and has a very fast pace 
with games as brief as two minutes fifteen seconds in the (NSL) or lasting 
up to twenty minutes in the PSP (Paintball Sports Promotions).[13] Another 
variant is scenario paintball, in which players attempt to recreate historical, 
or fictional settings; the largest being Oklahoma D-Day's World War II 
re-enactment.[citation needed] Woodsball or "Bushball", is a term developed 
late in the history of the game to refer to what was the original form 
of the game: teams competing in a wooded or natural environment, in which 
varying amounts of stealth and concealment tactics can offer an advantage. 
The term is commonly used as a synonym for specialized scenario-based play, 
but it technically refers to virtually any form of paintball played in 
fields primarily composed of natural terrain and cover such as trees and 
berms, instead of manmade obstacles. Woodsball may sometimes feature large 
teams, in competition to obtain various goals and objectives. Large-scale 
Woodsball games are commonly referred to as "Big Games" or "Scenario Games". 
Popular examples of the scenario format are Cousin's Big Game in Coram, 
New York (on Long Island), Hell Survivor's Monster Game (just outside Pinckney, 
Michigan), Invasion of Normandy at Skirmish U.S.A in Pennsylvania, and 
Oklahoma D-Day 9in Wyandotte, Oklahoma), events which draws in 2,000 to 
4,500 players and last for two days, up to a week. Another variant of the 
Big Game is the "Attack and Defend" format where large numbers of attackers 
try to overrun a fixed, but a well-defended objective, such as a compound 
or large building. MilSim ("Military Simulation") is a mode of play designed 
to create an experience closer to military reality, where the attainment 
of specific objectives is the most important aspect of the game. MilSim 
addresses the logistics of combat, mission planning and execution, and 
dealing with limited resources and ammunition. Players are typically eliminated 
from the game when struck by paint. For aesthetic reasons, MilSim often 
uses airsoft guns rather than paintball guns, as their prominent hoppers 
appear unrealistic, however Airsoft pellets, being smaller caliber and 
fired at higher velocity, have an increased risk of player injury if the 
scenario involves high rates of fire or close range. Magazine-fed markers 
in standard .68 caliber or First Strike (which is more accurate) paintball 
specs but with styling approximating powder firearms have been developed 
for MilSim games.[14] Speedball is played in an open field that could be 
compared to a soccer field, it is flat with a minimum of natural obstacles, 
and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The 
first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked 
into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into 
a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles 
for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles 
made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout 
and some "give" to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable 
fabric "bunkers" were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous 
fields, such as "snake" and "can" bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles 
both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions 
with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field 
or to set up temporary fields. Tournaments such as the PSP hold different 
events throughout the summer months all over the United States. Speedball 
games were originally started as a way to make the game safer for players 
who might trip on uneven woodland terrain. Speedball is generally a fast-paced 
game where many more balls are used than in woodsball style games. The 
Markers used are usually more "High Tech" in a sense that they are controlled 
by an electronic board and have very high rates of fire(upwards to 20 ball 
per second). Regulated games are overseen by referees or marshals, who 
patrol the course to ensure enforcement of the rules and the safety of 
the players.[15] If a player is marked with paint, they will call them 
out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken 
ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this 
rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only – such as 
the head and torso only.[16] There are game rules that can be enforced 
depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the fairness of the game 
or eliminate cheating. Player and team strategy varies depending on the 
size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level 
of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute 
the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between 
starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that 
runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around 
the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much 
of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first 
to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating 
one or more opponents to reduce the number of directions each player has 
to watch for incoming paint. The more territory a team has behind them, 
the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position 
to get a good shot at one or more opponents, and because the field is of 
finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has. A key element of 
intermediate and advanced strategy is the concept of "firing lanes". These 
are clear lines of sight between obstacles on the field and thus potentially 
between opposing players on the field behind them. A lane is "occupied" 
if at least one player of the opposing team can fire along it, and it's 
"active" if any player is firing along it, friend or foe. Occupied and 
active lanes hinder player movement as the player risks getting hit and 
eliminated. Open fields with sparse cover often have long open lanes between 
most or all bunkers on the field, most of which will be occupied if not 
active and so players have to keep track of which lanes to and from their 
bunker become occupied by the other team, so the player can make sure the 
bunker is between himself and the opponent(s). This becomes harder the 
more occupied firing lanes there are; when most available firing lanes 
on the field are occupied, each team has to create cover in at least one 
direction using suppressing fire (rounds sent to the opponent's location 
designed to keep their head down more than to eliminate them). Speedball, 
which tends to use small open fields with relatively few obstacles, requires 
each player to use hundreds of paintballs in the course of a game keeping 
their opponents pinned down, or else they'll be pinned themselves. Conversely, 
if most firing lanes on the field are clear, players on each team have 
greater mobility and the use of covering fire to pin an opponent is less 
useful as the player can stay behind cover while moving long distances, 
so players tend to fire less and move more to gain clear shots. Urban scenarios 
and woodsball fields tend to be larger and with more cover, shortening 
firing lanes and requiring players to move more to get good shots against 
their opponent. Typically, strategy is limited for casual walk-on style 
paintball play. Some teamwork will be seen at the beginning of the games 
with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players 
between bunkers and assigning defenders that will stay back and cover attackers 
that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups 
of players sticking together or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated 
sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned 
team tactics and strategy is seen throughout each game from the opening 
to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics 
they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates will 
be trying to do in various situations during the game. Paintball is played 
at both commercial venues, which require paid admission, and private land; 
both of which may include multiple fields of varying size and layout. Fields 
can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain,[23] and may 
also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or 
urban area, and may involve a historical context. The world's largest paintball 
company, some have around 37 paintball centers globally and provides movie 
themed fields complete with movie-quality props and structures.[24][25][26] 
Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may 
include an assortment of various inflatable bunkers; these fields are less 
prone to cause injury as the bunkers are little more than air bags, which 
can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable 
fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed 
of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, 
shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe. The use of plastic 
pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy 
reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was 
the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common 
features in inflatable fields, such as "can" and "snake" bunkers, were 
derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational 
fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability 
and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise 
developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers. 
Commercial venues may provide amenities such as bathrooms, picnic areas, 
lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may 
have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance 
standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players 
are instructed in proper play to ensure participants' safety. Some fields 
are "BYOP" (Bring Your Own Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated 
retail stores or online and use it at their field. However, most fields 
are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue 
or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue 
reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball 
park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited 
and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun 
failures or personal injury to targeted players.[27][28][29] Other times, 
FPO policies are in keeping with municipal laws for wastewater and runoff; 
paintballs contain food dyes, and some formulations have metallic flakes 
and/or cornstarch to make them more visible, all of which can pose problems 
in water reservoirs and treatment plants. So, fields that must wash paintball 
paint into municipal wastewater facilities, or that have substantial rain 
runoff into bodies of water that are used as sources of drinking water, 
are generally required by the municipality to restrict players to only 
certain paint formulations; the easiest way to achieve this is to sell 
only approved paint and require that field paint be used.[30] Playing on 
a non-established field is sometimes referred to as renegade or gonzo play 
or outlaw ball (with the players nicknamed renegade ballers or outlaws).[31] 
Though less expensive and less structured than play at a commercial facility, 
the lack of safety protocols, instruction, and oversight can lead to higher 
incidence of injuries. The first organized paintball game in record was 
held by Charles Gaines and friends in New Hampshire in 1981, with the first 
paintball field opening approximately a year later in Sutton, NH[32] In 
1983 the first National Survival Game (NSG) national championship was held, 
with a $14,000 cash award for the winning team.[33] As of 2010[update], 
tournaments are largely organized by paintball leagues. A Speedball league 
is an organization that provides a regulated competition for Speedball 
players to compete. Leagues can be of various sizes (for example, regional, 
national or international) and offer organized tournaments and or games 
for professional, semi-professional, and amateur teams, sometimes with 
financial prizes. The first British national league was the British Paintball 
League created in 1989 by Gary Morhall, Richard Hart and Derek Wildermuth 
in Essex England.[34][35][36][37] As of 2015, the major leagues in the 
United States are the National Speedball League (NSL) and the National 
X-ball League (NXL).[37][38] Internationally, the Paintball Asia League 
Series (PALS) in Asia, the Millennium Series in western Europe,[39] the 
Centurio series in Eastern Europe, and the National Collegiate Paintball 
Association in the US and Canada (A league was also created for high school 
and college players, the NCPA.*Not recognized by the NCAA*).[40] They are 
supplemented by various regional and local leagues spread worldwide. Within 
these leagues it is narrowed down further to divisions. There are 6 divisions 
from division 5 to division 1 besides various professional leagues. The 
nature and timing of paintball events are specified by the league running 
the tournament, with the league also defining match rules – such as number 
of players per team (anywhere from 3-7 players per team), or acceptable 
equipment for use. The number of matches in a tournament is largely defined 
by the number of available teams playing. However, the NSL offers non-tournament 
game play where a more traditional game day format has been adopted. Two 
teams face off at a set time and play only one game per game day in the 
season as beginners play a 24-minute game and Amateur and Professional 
play a 32-minute game, both requiring 90 minutes to resolve. A match in 
a tournament is refereed by a judge, whose authority and decisions are 
final. Tournament rules can vary as specified by the league, but may include 
for example – not allowing players to use devices to communicate with other 
persons during a game, or not allowing players to unduly alter the layout 
of terrain on the field. In contrast to a casual game designed for fun, 
a tournament is much stricter and violations of rules may result in penalties 
for the players or entire teams.[41] Though tournament paintball was originally 
played in the woods, speedball became the standard competitive format in 
the 1990s.[37][42] The smaller fields made use of artificial terrain such 
as bunkers, allowing symmetrical fields that eliminate terrain advantages 
for either team; woodsball fields having no such guarantee.[43] Most recently, 
fields using inflatable bunkers, tethered to the ground with stakes, have 
become standard for most tournament formats; the soft, yielding bunkers 
reduce the occurrence of injuries, the bunkers deflate to store in a compact 
space and anchor to the ground with tent stakes, allowing for temporary 
fields to be set up and torn down with less impact on the ground underneath, 
and the arrangement of bunkers can be easily re-configured to maintain 
novelty of play or to simulate a predetermined field layout for an upcoming 
event.[44] A professional paintball team is one that plays paintball with 
the financial, equipment or other kind of support of one or more sponsors, 
often in return for advertising rights. Professional teams can have different 
names in different leagues due to franchising and sponsorship issues. In 
the past, unlawful groups and terrorists have been accused of using paintball 
for tactical training purposes in connection with the following incidents: 
Mohamed Mahmood Alessa and Carlos "Omar" Eduardo Almonte, two men arrested 
in June 2010 as they were bound for Somalia, and charged with terrorism 
and conspiring to kill, maim, and kidnap people outside the U.S., had simulated 
combat at an outdoor paintball facility in West Milford, New Jersey, according 
to the complaint against them.[45][46][47][48] Similarly, 11 men, convicted 
in 2003–04 of composing the Virginia Jihad Network, engaged in paintball 
training in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, to simulate guerrilla operations 
and develop combat skills to prepare for jihad, according to prosecutors.[46][47][49][50][51][52] 
In 2006, Ali Asad Chandia of the Virginia Jihad Network was sentenced to 
15 years in prison aiding the Pakistani terrorist organization, Lashkar-e-Taiba, 
including arringing a shipment of 50,000 paintballs from the U.S. to Pakistan.[53] 
In addition, two of the 2005 London 7/7 bombers were filmed while training 
in June 2005 at a paintball center in Tonbridge, Kent.[54] Also, the suspects 
in the 2006 Toronto Terrorism case played paintball to prepare for their 
attack.[55][56] In 2007, paintball training was engaged in by five terrorists 
to prepare for an attack aimed at killing American soldiers in Fort Dix, 
New Jersey; they were later convicted.[57][58] The rate of injury to paintball 
participants has been estimated as 45 injuries per 100,000 participants 
per year.[59] Research published by the Minnesota Paintball Association 
has argued that paintball is one of the statistically safest sports to 
participate in, with 20 injuries per 100,000 players annually,[60] and 
these injuries tend to be incidental to outdoor physical activity (e.g. 
trip-and-fall). A 2003 study of the 24 patients with modern sports eye 
injuries presenting to the eye emergency department of Porto São João Hospital 
between April 1992 and March 2002 included five paintball eye injuries.[61] 
Furthermore, a one-year study undertaken by the Eye Emergency Department, 
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston has shown that most sports 
eye injuries are caused by basketball, baseball, hockey, and racquetball.[62] 
Another analysis concluded that eye injuries incurred from paintball were 
in settings where protective equipment such as masks were not enforced, 
or were removed by the player.[63] Eye injuries can occur when protective 
equipment is not properly used and such injuries often cause devastating 
visual loss.[64][65] For safety, most regulated paintball fields strictly 
enforce a 'masks-on' policy, and most eject players who consistently disobey. 
Regardless, paintball has received criticism due to incidents of injury. 
In Canada in 2007, an eleven-year-old boy lifted his mask and was shot 
point blank in the eye by an adult playing on the same field,[66] leading 
to calls by the Montreal Children's Hospital to restrict the minimum age 
of paintball participants to 16 years. In Australia, the sport attracted 
criticism when a 39-year-old man playing at a registered field in Victoria 
died of a suspected heart attack, after being struck in the chest.[2][67] 
Additionally, the use of paintball markers outside a regulated environment 
has caused concern. In the United States in 1998, 14-year-old Jorel Lynn 
Travis was shot with a paintball gun while standing outside a Fort Collins, 
Colorado ice cream parlor – blinding her in one eye.[68] In 2001, a series 
of pre-meditated and racially motivated drive-by shootings targeted Alaska 
Natives in Anchorage, Alaska, using a paintball marker. In Ottawa, Canada 
in 2007, Ashley Roos was shot in the eye and blinded with a paintball gun 
while waiting for a bus.[69][70][71] In 2014 in the UK, one company advertised 
and hired a Human Bullet Tester.[72][73] Paintball has been considered 
an inappropriate game, that promotes violence, by the Parliament of the 
Province of Buenos Aires. The approved law 14.492 (December 2012) regulates 
its use: it is totally forbidden for children under 16 years old, but can 
be played with written authorization by the parents, or responsible person 
in charge, of youths between 16 and 18 years old. Originally, the initiative 
had proposed the total prohibition for players under 21 years old. The 
penalties are also established by law, as 30 days of communitarian work 
or other modalities. Paintballing in Australia is controlled by the police 
in each state, with differing minimum age requirements. Players under 18 
are required to have a guardian sign a consent form. The minimum ages are 
12 for South Australia and Western Australia, 15 for Queensland, 16 for 
New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. Previously 
the minimum age for Victoria was 18, but legislation has recently been 
introduced to lower the legal age for paintball to 16.[74] Both major parties 
in Victoria have supported the changes.[75] Paintball has been recently 
legalized in Tasmania as of 4 November 2016 .[2] To own a paintball marker 
privately in Australia (outside Tasmania and the Northern Territory) one 
must hold a valid firearms license endorsed for paintball use. In the Northern 
Territory they are considered a Class C firearm and private ownership is 
illegal. In Western Australia they are considered a Category E(5) miscellaneous 
weapon.[76] In New South Wales,[77] South Australia,[78] the Australian 
Capital Territory[79] and Queensland[80] they are considered Class A firearms 
for the purposes of licensing and storage. In Victoria they are now classified 
as a Category P firearm.[81] Operators must adhere to legislation on gun 
storage, safety training and field sizes; private owners have to secure 
their markers according to state law on storage, as by law paintball markers 
are considered firearms in Australia. As in Australia, paintballing in 
the Republic of Cyprus is controlled by police, i.e. all paintball markers 
must be registered and licensed, the field must be in certain standards 
that is inspected by police in order to obtain the license for a paintball 
field. The process of buying one's own paintball marker is just as complicated, 
the buyer must have completed military service, have a clean police record 
and be over the age of 18 years. Minimum age for paintball is 14 years 
old with parents consent, from 16 and up no parental consent is required. 
It is required that all players must wear protective mask as well and neck 
and chest protection. Paintball markers are not allowed to exceed 290 fps 
velocity and a maximum of 12bit/s firing rate.[82] In Germany, paintball 
is restricted to players over 18 years of age.[83] Paintball markers are 
classified as weapons that do not require a license or permit; they are 
legal to buy and use, but restricted to adults. Markers are limited to 
a kinetic energy of 7.5 J.[84] Tampering with the marker to increase muzzle 
velocity above 214 fps can lead to confiscation/destruction of the marker 
and a fine. All Paintball markers sold officially in Germany must be certified 
by the government "Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt" (PTB) (Federal 
Physical and Technical Institute) to operate within these limits and must 
have a registered serial number and an official stamp on the firing mechanism. 
In May 2009, reacting to the Winnenden school shooting, German lawmakers 
announced plans to ban games such as paintball as they allegedly trivialised 
and encouraged violence[85][86] but the plans were retracted a few days 
later. Most Indoor-Paintball-Areas in Germany have a strict "No-Mil-Sim"-Policy, 
meaning that no camouflage clothing or real-life looking markers are allowed.[87] 
Paintballing is widely accepted as a recreational pastime in Ireland and 
is not directly subject to any governing regulations. In Northern Ireland 
all paintballs guns are classified as firearms and as such all gun owners 
needs to obtain a license from the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland). 
There is also a minimum age where all players need to be 16 or older. Paintball 
is governed by the local Gardaí in the Republic of Ireland. A Firearms 
licence is required for both personal and site use. Weapon storage guidelines 
and security must also be strictly adhered to. Paintball markers are classified 
as Airguns under New Zealand law, and as such are legal for persons 18 
and over to possess (those between the ages of 16 and 18 require a firearms 
license). Following the Arms (Military Style Semi-automatic Firearms and 
Import Controls) Amendment Act 2012 (Which came into effect on December 
1, 2013),[88] fully automatic Paintball guns are legal to purchase and 
use, although a permit to procure from the New Zealand Police is required 
in order to legally import them into the country.[89] Military replicas 
require a permit for import. The United Kingdom Paintball Sport Federation 
(UKPSF) is the UK's independent, non profit, governing body for paintball.[90] 
They are an independent organisation which ensure the safety and quality 
of paintball venues and events in the UK. UKPSF accreditation ensures the 
venue meets the basic health and safety criteria of the UKPSF and has full 
public liability insurance. The UKPSF hopes to send an application to the 
UK Sports council to make paintball a recognised sport in the UK.[citation 
needed] UKPSF are recognised by the Home Office for legal consultation 
The United Kingdom Paintball Association (UKPBA) a non-profit making body 
dedicated to the promotion and protection of the sport of paintball in 
the UK. The UKPBA was established in 1989, a division of Delta Force, and 
considers itself to have a fair claim to be considered the governing body 
of paintball in the UK. Due to association with Delta Force the UKPBA lists 
a high membership by signing up every player at Delta Force sites, this 
covers a majority of once only players and does not include regular players 
such as scenario, walkons or tournament players. Laws pertaining to paintball 
markers in the United Kingdom classify them as a type of air weapon, although 
some could be considered to be "imitation firearms."[91] Owners do not 
require a license unless the marker fires above 90 m/s (300 ft/s). Only 
approved paintballs can be used, and the marker must not be fully automatic. 
The minimum age to be in possession of a marker is seventeen, except in 
target shooting clubs or galleries, or on private property so long as projectiles 
are not fired beyond the premises. It is prohibited to be in possession 
of a paintball marker in public places. The minimum age for a commercial 
venue is generally 10, although facilities exist with lower-powered guns 
for children of a younger age. In the United States, eight states define 
explicit legislation for paintball guns. In Pennsylvania, paintball markers 
have transport requirements, cannot be used against anyone not participating 
in a paintball activity, and cannot be used for property damage.[citation 
needed] New Hampshire and Rhode Island require players be at least eighteen 
years of age to own a marker, with students in New Hampshire faced with 
the possibility of expulsion from school for possessing a marker.[citation 
needed] In Illinois, owners must be over the age of twelve and can only 
use their markers in private land or on safely constructed target ranges.[citation 
needed] Virginia is one of two states that permit its towns to adopt ordinances 
on paintball guns, allowing its local authorities to do so.[92] Delaware 
on the other hand only authorizes Wilmington to do so, but does allow paintball 
to be played on farms as it is considered an agritourism activity. Florida 
and Texas limit government liability if a government entity allows paintball 
on its property.[93] In virtually all jurisdictions, the use of a paintball 
marker in a manner other than its intended purpose and/or outside the confines 
of a sanctioned game or field can result in criminal charges such as disturbing 
the peace, disorderly conduct, vandalism, criminal mischief or even aggravated 
assault. Despite stiff legislation, paintball is growing in popularity 
as a competitive sport, with several leagues and tournaments across the 
country. There are paintball fields in every state except Tasmania that 
allows paintball marker ownership.[94] In Victoria the Paintball Association 
of Victoria runs a number of events including scenario, 3v3 and 5v5 competitions.[95] 
The sports of paintball has newly been introduced in Bangladesh in 2005. 
Though the game is not widespread and popular in the country, some number 
of the educated group of the population are being acquainted with paint-balling. 
It is expected that the paint balling will address of the pastime need 
of the city-dwellers. Currently a Team is working to launch paintball in 
the Dhaka city, the name of that Team is "Paintball Bangladesh" , as they 
have declared in their Facebook page that they are about to launch this 
sports, very soon. they also have a website www.paintballbangladesh.com 
there Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/pballbd [96] [97] Certain 
paintball fields opened in the Eastern Townships and in the Laurentians. 
In the beginning it was mostly fields with regular open fields with barricades 
of wood, old tires and barrels, and very basic infrastructure. Harry Kruger 
has operated a paintball venue known as "Capture the Flag" in Alberta since 
the late 1980s. In 1995 Bigfoot Paintball opened in St. Alphonse-Rodriguez 
in the region of Lanaudière. After only a few years it became more and 
more prominent in Québec.[citation needed] In 2013, paintball has become 
relatively mainstream in Canada, with multiple commercial indoor paintball 
facilities located in most large cities across Canada, as well as a variety 
of outdoor style commercial paintball fields located in the countryside 
around the cities. There are about ten fields in Cyprus, the most recognized 
of them being the Lapatsa Paintball Ranch in Nicosia, DNA-Paintball in 
Paphos, and Paintball Cyprus in Limassol. The Republic of Cyprus has a 
number of ongoing paintball leagues, including CRL (Cyprus Rec-ball League) 
and CSL (Cyprus Speedball League). Each league has tournaments every month 
for the duration of the season which is usually about 7–9 months.[98] In 
Denmark paintball is a very popular sport. There are around 25 paintball 
outdoor and indoor fields in Denmark. The largest indoor paintball center 
in Europe is in Copenhagen.[99] India also now has almost all cities equipped 
with paintball center and youth is liking this adventure sport even now 
corporates also lands into this as a recreation theme sports, Events happening 
and there are Couple of organization in Mumbai also Like Urban Games, MyUrbanGames 
and Headrush is leading Paintball organizer in India. In India, paintball 
dates back to 2005 when TPCI (The Paintball Co.) joined with PALS (Paintball 
Asia League Series) which governs sport in the Asian Circuit and introduced 
this sport to the country by starting the first commercial paintball park 
on the outskirts of the national capital at Damdama Lake in Gurgaon, Haryana. 
Tto cut down the cost of this expensive sport and adapt it to suit harsh 
Indian weather conditions, lot of innovative adaptations have been made 
since 2005. To promote the sport, PALS & TPCI joined with the Sports Authority 
of India in 2007 and trained several unemployed youth, who run more than 
200 paintball fields across India today. Today India not only manufactures 
paintballs and other accessories, but also manufacturers professional markers 
that are exported across the globe. Since 2007 TPCI has been organizing 
a national-level league tournament every year with sponsorship from the 
government and various leading industrial and corporate houses. India's 
second league, the National Paintball League, was formed in 2010 by one 
of the senior employees of TPCI to concentrate on promoting the sport in 
southern India. The Sports Authority of India is yet to issue standard 
rules to regulate this sport. However, several mishaps have been reported 
at paintball fields generally because of ill-trained staff, use of fake 
or low quality equipment, and dilution of the international quality standards. 
NPCI & PALS are in talks with the Sports Authority of India to regulate 
the rise of uncertified paintball parks and introduce a comprehensive training, 
certification and audit process. With the growth of outsourcing and offshoring 
of IT companies, especially in New Delhi and Bangalore, paintball as a 
sport is being used as a tool for corporate training. There has been a 
sharp increase in the woodsball, speedball and scenario gaming arenas and 
is growing at a fast pace. Many semi-urban Indian cities have built indoor 
and outdoor paintball fields in recent years. Bangalore hosts the Paintball 
Indian open every year in which teams come from all over the world to compete 
for the championship. In Iran, paintball is a very popular recreation. 
Nearly every city has one or more paintball fields, and every province 
has one or more teams that play at the national paintball league. Iran 
itself has a national team.[100] Hezbollah, the militant group and political 
party based in Lebanon, has trained with paintball.[101] Paintball is a 
very popular sport in Malaysia. The Malaysian paintball community is considered 
the largest in Asia. The Paintball Asia League Series (PALS) is headquartered 
in Petaling Jaya near the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. They organize tournaments 
and events around the Asian region. There are also the Malaysian Paintball 
Official Circuit (MPOC), Malaysian National Paintball League (MY-NPL), 
the Malaysian Super Sevens Series, World Paintball Players League (WPPL), 
the Malaysian Ultimate Woodsball League (UWL Malaysia), and Tactical Paintball 
Championship (TPC). The Paintball World Cup Asia is also held annually 
in Langkawi island.[102] Several woodsball and scenario big games are also 
held throughout the year such as the International Scenario Paintball Games 
(ISPG) and by Paintball Warfare Group Malaysia (PWG-Malaysia). There are 
many commercial paintball fields operating in almost every major city across 
the country, with most of them concentrated around the Klang Valley region. 
However, in December 2013, the Royal Malaysian Police stated that all paintball 
markers must be owned with a licence and owners must hand in their markers. 
Some paintball organizations have stated that this will be "a big blow" 
to paintball in the country while others stated that this will not affect 
the sport at all. In South Africa, organised paintball has been played 
since the late 1980s. The only legal enforcement regarding paintball is 
the concealment of paintball (and airsoft) guns in public areas.[103] There 
are no license requirements or age limitations in place, but with the threat 
of the implementation of the "Dangerous Weapons Act", this could change.[when?] 
South Africa has seen a steady growth of the sport of paintball since its 
introduction. Recreational bushball is the most popular form throughout 
the country, but the last couple of years[when?] have seen a big increase 
in the popularity of speedball. The South African Paintball League has 
been in existence since 2002 During 2013 South Africa was invited to send 
a representative paintball team to the first ever Paintball World Cup held 
in Paris, France. The South African team got officially ranked 13th in 
the world. Popular tournaments such as The Tippmann Challenge, D-Day and 
the Navy Festival SWAT Challenge, see hundreds of players from around the 
entire country participate. The first ever public paintball performance 
in South Africa was held at the Swartkop Airshow during 2013. More than 
80 paintball players took part a in a simulated a counter terrorist raid 
on a weapons dealer. Currently, the biggest national speedball league in 
South Africa is the SARPL (South African Regional Paintball League)[104] 
with over 500 members and hosting both a 3-man and 5-man series events 
in 5 provinces (including Gauteng, Kwazulu Natal, Eastern Cape, Western 
Cape and the Free State). The league hosts around 31 events per year on 
a regional and national level with the national finals that takes place 
at Oviston, Lake Gariep beginning December of each year starting at the 
end of 2013. The SARPL currently play PSP Race-to-2 format and use the 
PSP rule set as well as using APPA[105] system for player classification. 
Paintball is a very niche yet extremely competitive sport in Thailand. 
Thai paintball teams are considered to be one of the strongest, if not 
the strongest in Asia. Thai teams have taken home the Division 1 Paintball 
Asia League Series (PALS) World Cup and series titles in year 2012, 2014, 
and 2015. In 2014, Thai teams made the history books by taking victories 
in all Divisions 1, 2, and 3 at the PALS World Cup at Langkawi Island, 
Malaysia. This trend continued into 2015, with Thai teams taking victories 
in Divisions 1 and 2 during the PALS World Cup 2015. Along with winning 
the PALS World Cup titles in 2014 and 2015, all respective teams also took 
the overall series titles for their respective divisions in 2014 and 2015. 
Thai paintball continues to grow at a slow pace, thus allowing the community
