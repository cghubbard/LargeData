Qualcomm Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in San Diego, California, United 
States. The stadium opened in 1967 as San Diego Stadium and was later known 
for many years as Jack Murphy Stadium. Since 1997, the stadium's naming 
rights have been owned by Qualcomm, a San Diego-based telecommunications 
equipment company. It is the current home of the San Diego Chargers of 
the National Football League (NFL) and the San Diego State Aztecs football 
team from San Diego State University. Two college football bowl games, 
the Holiday Bowl and Poinsettia Bowl, are held in the stadium every December. 
The San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB) played home games at 
the stadium from their founding in 1969 through the 2003 season, after 
which they moved to Petco Park. The stadium has hosted three Super Bowl 
games: Super Bowl XXII in 1988, Super Bowl XXXII in 1998, and Super Bowl 
XXXVII in 2003. It has also hosted the 1978 and 1992 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Games, as well as games of the 1996 and 1998 National League Division 
Series, the 1984 and 1998 National League Championship Series, and the 
1984 and 1998 World Series. It is the only stadium ever to host both the 
Super Bowl and the World Series in the same year (1998) and is one of three 
stadiums to host the World Series, MLB All-Star Game, and Super Bowl, along 
with the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis and Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum. Qualcomm Stadium is located immediately northwest of the interchange 
of Interstate 8 and Interstate 15. The neighborhood surrounding the stadium 
is known as Mission Valley, in reference to the Mission San Diego de Alcalá, 
which is located to the east, and its placement in the valley of the San 
Diego River. The stadium is served by the Qualcomm Stadium station of the 
San Diego Trolley, accessible via the Green Line running toward Downtown 
San Diego to the west, and Santee to the east. In the early 1960s, local 
sportswriter Jack Murphy, the brother of New York Mets broadcaster Bob 
Murphy, began to build up support for a multi-purpose stadium for San Diego. 
In November 1965, a $27 million bond was passed allowing construction to 
begin on a stadium, which was designed in the Brutalist style.[4] Construction 
on the stadium began one month later. When completed, the facility was 
named San Diego Stadium. The Chargers (then a member of the American Football 
League) played the first game ever at the stadium on August 20, 1967. San 
Diego Stadium had a capacity of around 50,000; the three-tier grandstand 
was in the shape of a horseshoe, with the east end low (consisting of only 
one tier, partially topped by a large scoreboard). The Chargers were the 
main tenant of the stadium until 1968, when the AAA Pacific Coast League 
San Diego Padres baseball team played its last season in the stadium, following 
their move from the minor league sized Westgate Park. Due to expansion 
of Major League Baseball, this team was replaced by the current San Diego 
Padres major-league team beginning in the 1969 season. (The Padres moved 
out of Qualcomm Stadium following the 2003 season.) The original scoreboard, 
a black-and-white scoreboard created by All American Scoreboards, was replaced 
in 1978 by one manufactured by American Sign and Indicator, which was the 
first full-color outdoor scoreboard ever built.[5] This was replaced in 
1987 by a White Way Sign scoreboard, in which the video screen is surrounded 
almost entirely by three messageboards. The original video board was replaced 
in 1996 by a Sony JumboTron, with a second JumboTron installed behind the 
opposite end zone (third base in the stadium's baseball configuration). 
After Jack Murphy's passing in September 1980, San Diego Stadium was renamed 
San Diego–Jack Murphy Stadium by a 6–2 vote of the San Diego City Council 
on January 6, 1981.[4][6] In 1983, over 9,000 bleachers were added to the 
lower deck on the open end of the stadium raising the capacity to 59,022. 
The most substantial addition was completed in 1997, when the stadium was 
fully enclosed, with the exception of where the scoreboard is located. 
Nearly 11,000 seats were added in readiness for Super Bowl XXXII in 1998, 
bringing the capacity to 70,561. Also in 1997, the facility was renamed 
Qualcomm Stadium after Qualcomm Corporation paid $18 million for the naming 
rights.[4] The naming rights will belong to Qualcomm until 2017. In order 
to continue to honor Murphy, the city named the stadium site Jack Murphy 
Field.[7] However, as part of the naming agreement Jack Murphy Field was 
not allowed to be used alongside Qualcomm Stadium.[8] Some San Diegans, 
however, still refer to the stadium as "Jack Murphy" or simply "The Murph". 
Before his death in 2004, Bob Murphy still referred to it as Jack Murphy 
Stadium during New York Mets broadcasts, even after it was renamed. The 
stadium was temporarily renamed "Snapdragon Stadium" for 10 days in December 
2011 as a marketing tie in for Qualcomm's Snapdragon brand.[9] The legality 
of the temporary name change was challenged at the time, since it was agreed 
to unilaterally by San Diego's mayor, without approval from the City Council 
and against the advice of the City Attorney.[10] The stadium was the first 
of the square-circle "octorad" style, which was thought to be an improvement 
over the other cookie cutter stadiums of the time for hosting both football 
and baseball (the second and last of this style was the since-imploded 
Veterans Stadium). Despite the theoretical improvements of this style, 
most of the seats were still very far away from the action on the field, 
especially during baseball games. It is one of the few "cookie-cutter" 
stadiums to still remain active, along with Robert F. Kennedy Memorial 
Stadium. In order to accommodate the dimensions of both football and baseball 
fields, the stadium was constructed with half of the lower (Field Level) 
level seating built of permanent concrete (in the southern quadrant of 
the stadium), and the other half of portable modular construction using 
aluminum or steel framing. When the stadium was configured for baseball, 
the portable sections would be placed in the western quadrant of the stadium 
along the third base-left field side. Open bullpens were located along 
both foul lines just beyond the ends of the Field-level seats. In the football 
configuration, the portable seating sections are placed in the northern 
quadrant of the stadium (covering what is used as left field in the baseball 
configuration) to allow for the football field to be laid out east–west 
(along the first base/right field foul line, with the western end zone 
placed in the area occupied by the portable seating sections in the baseball 
configuration, and the eastern end zone along the right-center field wall). 
Doorways are cut in the walls of the stadium in order to allow access to 
these seats from the tunnel below the Plaza level in both configurations 
(in baseball configuration, the football doors could be seen above the 
left field inner wall; in football configuration, the baseball doors are 
visible above the west end zone, opposite the scoreboard). These doors 
are rolling metal overhead doors, with the field side painted to match 
the surrounding walls facing the field. From their inception in 1969 until 
the end of 2003, when they moved into Petco Park in the downtown area, 
the National League's San Diego Padres called the stadium home. The baseball 
field dimensions had varied slightly over the years. In 1969, the distance 
from home plate to the left and right field wall was 330 feet (100 m), 
the distance to the left- and right-center field power alleys was 375 feet 
(114 m), and the distance from home plate to the center field was 420 feet 
(130 m). A 19-foot (5.8 m) wall, whose top was the rim of the Plaza level, 
surrounded the outfield, making home runs difficult to hit. Later, an eight-foot 
fence was erected, cutting the distances to 327, 368 and 405 feet (123 m), 
respectively. In 1996 a note of asymmetry was introduced when a 19-foot 
(5.8 m) high scoreboard displaying out-of-town scores was erected along 
the right-field wall near the foul pole and deemed to be in play, and so 
the distances to right field and right-center field were 330 feet (100 m) 
and 370 feet (110 m), respectively, while the remaining dimensions remained 
the same. Orel Hershiser broke Don Drysdale's scoreless inning streak at 
Jack Murphy Stadium on September 28, 1988 as the Los Angeles Dodgers played 
the San Diego Padres. Rickey Henderson collected his 3000th major league 
base hit here on October 7, 2001 as a Padre, in what was also the last 
major league game for Tony Gwynn, the eight-time National League batting 
champion and Hall of Famer who played his entire career with San Diego. 
It was also before a Padres game here where comedian Roseanne Barr gave 
her infamous rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" in 1990.[22] The San 
Diego Chargers teams that played football here in the 1970s and 1980s featured 
a high-scoring offense led by quarterback Dan Fouts and featuring running 
back Chuck Muncie, tight end Kellen Winslow, receiver Charlie Joiner and 
placekicker Rolf Benirschke; however, the first Chargers team to advance 
to the Super Bowl (in 1994, Super Bowl XXIX) featured a strong defense 
anchored by linebacker Junior Seau and an unspectacular but efficient offense 
led by quarterback Stan Humphries and running back Natrone Means. The stadium 
played host to the 1980 AFC Championship Game, which the "Bolts" would 
lose to their AFC West and in-state rival, the Oakland Raiders, 34–27. 
The Chargers also hosted Wild Card and Divisional Playoff games here in 
1980, 1992, 1994, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, going 5-5 in all 
playoff games held at the stadium. The Chargers are unbeaten at Qualcomm 
(and at home in franchise history) against the Detroit Lions (5–0) and 
Jacksonville Jaguars (3–0), but winless here against the Atlanta Falcons 
(0–6), Carolina Panthers (0–3), and Green Bay Packers (0–6). Since its 
inception, the stadium, which is approximately five miles from campus, 
has been the home of San Diego State University Aztecs football. Before 
the building of the stadium, they had played their games at Balboa Stadium 
and their small, on-campus stadium, the Aztec Bowl (which is now the site 
of Viejas Arena, the home of the university's basketball teams). Traditionally, 
the team, clad in all-black uniforms and red helmets, has played its home 
games at night, a tradition started during the days of former head coach 
Don Coryell before the stadium was even opened. There have been attempts 
in the past to change from "The Look", but all have led to poor play by 
the Aztecs and a return to the traditional look. Following the 1978 college 
football season, the stadium began hosting the Holiday Bowl, an annual 
bowl game held before New Year's Day. It originally hosted the Western 
Athletic Conference champion (at the time, the hometown Aztecs had just 
joined this conference) against a nationally ranked opponent. The game 
has traditionally been a high-scoring affair, and prior to 2009 no team 
had ever managed to score less than ten points (which occurred in the 2006 
game, when the Texas A&M Aggies lost 45-10 to the California Golden Bears) 
and only ⅓ of the games have had a team even score less than 20 points. 
In the 2009 game, Arizona failed to score against Nebraska. The 1984 game 
is well known for it being the culmination of BYU's championship season, 
the last championship not won by a member of the current College Football 
Playoff alliance. On December 22, 2005, a second bowl game came to San 
Diego when the inaugural San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl 
was played at Qualcomm, with Navy beating Colorado State. Qualcomm Stadium 
has been a venue for many international soccer matches. The stadium has 
hosted FIFA tournaments, including the CONCACAF Gold Cup, and the U.S. 
Cup (an international invitational), as well as many international friendly 
matches involving the Mexico National Team.[23] The most recent international 
friendly at Qualcomm set an all-time attendance record for the sport in 
the region. The match between Mexico and Argentina which was held on 4 
June 2008 drew 68,498 spectators.[24] The stadium has also hosted several 
international friendlies featuring teams such as Real Madrid, Chivas, Portsmouth 
F.C. and Club América. In addition, Qualcomm Stadium was part of the 18-stadium 
United States 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, but the United States did 
not win either bid for the World Cup. The San Diego Sockers of the North 
American Soccer League played at the stadium from 1978 to 1983. Qualcomm 
Stadium was the venue of Soccer Bowl '82 of the North American Soccer League 
and Major League Soccer's 1999 All-Star Game.[25] In October 1967, just 
weeks after the stadium opened, it hosted a SCCA event organized by San 
Diego Region. The event was not held in the stadium itself, but on a temporary 
course mapped out through the stadium's parking lot. In July 1968, the 
Region organized a SCCA National for the car park, now called the San Diego 
Stadium International Raceway, but the combination of a very small crowd 
and complaints about the noise ensured that the experiment was not repeated.[26] 
CIF San Diego Section Finals for high school football are held at Qualcomm 
Stadium. These usually take place on a Friday in early December, and four 
games are played (with eight teams representing four separate divisions, 
which are determined by the enrollment sizes of the individual schools). 
Qualcomm Stadium has also hosted rugby matches. In October 1980, the USA 
played New Zealand in a rugby match televised on ESPN. With 14,000 fans 
in attendance, this game at the time was the largest crowd ever to watch 
an international rugby game in the US.[27] Old Mission Beach Athletic Club 
RFC play rugby union at the adjacent mini-stadium, so-called Little Q. 
Qualcomm Stadium was home to a round of the AMA Supercross Championship 
each year, usually in early February, from 1980 to 2014.[28][29] The stadium 
also hosted a round of Monster Jam, also ran and operated by Feld Entertainment. 
In 2015, both events were moved to Petco Park.[28] ESPN held their inaugural 
Moto X World Championships at Qualcomm in April 2008,[30] and has previously 
used the stadium parking lot and surrounding streets as a venue in the 
X Games Street Luge competition. Concerts on the Green is a sports field 
converted into a music and entertainment venue, located on the southwest 
corner of the stadium parking lot. The field was originally used as a practice 
venue for the San Diego Chargers. After the team moved to Chargers Park 
about a mile north of the stadium, the area was used primarily for rugby. 
AEG leased the area and retrofit it into an open-air amphitheater for concerts 
and other entertainment shows. The venue had the capability to hold 12,500, 
making it the second biggest entertainment venue in the Greater San Diego 
area; only Cricket Wireless Amphitheatre seats more. Many concerts have 
also been held inside the stadium over the years, by famous artists of 
many different genres. Metallica and Guns N' Roses brought their co-headlining 
Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour to the stadium on September 30, 1992, 
with Body Count as their opening act. Billy Graham hosted a crusade at 
the stadium in early May 2003. American Idol (season 7) held auditions 
there in July 2007; a total of 30 people who auditioned there made it to 
the next round. During the Cedar Fire in October 2003 and the October 2007 
California wildfires, the stadium served as an evacuation site for those 
living in affected areas. (This was similar to the use of the Houston Astrodome 
and the New Orleans Superdome during Hurricane Katrina.) The Cedar Fire 
forced the Chargers to move a contest with the Miami Dolphins to Arizona 
State University's Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. In the 1980s and 
early 1990s, the San Diego County Council of the Boy Scouts of America 
used the stadium's concourse areas (between the rear of the grandstands 
and the freestanding wall which contains the entrance gates) as well as 
portions of the parking lots as the site of its annual Scout Fair. The 
San Diego County Council has since merged with the council representing 
Imperial County to form the Desert Pacific Council. In a January 30, 2009 
episode of Monk, Qualcomm Stadium was known as Summit Stadium in the episode 
Mr. Monk Makes the Playoffs with the fictitious San Francisco Condors as 
the home team. On May 4 and 18, 2013, the stadium was used as a race course 
by the Stadium Super Trucks.[31] On May 12, 2016, Beyoncé performed at 
the stadium as part of The Formation World Tour. On October 8, 2017, Coldplay 
will perform at the stadium as part of their A Head Full of Dreams Tour. 
The Little Q is a sports field, used primarily for rugby located adjacent 
to Qualcomm Stadium; the Little Q is home to San Diego's Super League rugby 
team OMBAC and the College Premier Division San Diego State University 
Aztec rugby team. In 1983 rock radio station (and still current) KGB 101.5 
FM hosted the KGB Skyshow 8 with Uriah Heep, Eddie Money, Mötley Crüe and 
Def Leppard finishing the show. Also, in 1982 the rock band The Who made 
an appearance in their "Farewell Tour" here. Big SoCal Euro is a gathering 
of European car enthusiasts. It attracts over three thousand car lovers 
every year. Not only is Big SoCal Euro one of the largest all European 
car gatherings, it is one of the oldest events of it's kind, established 
in 2002. It has been held at Qualcomm Stadium since 2007. The event was 
founded by Lon Mok of SoCalEuro.com With the departure of the Padres following 
the 2003 season and even beforehand, there has been much talk of replacing 
the increasingly obsolete (by NFL standards) stadium with a more modern, 
football-only one. Also, the NFL has demanded a new stadium to host another 
Super Bowl. There have been many problems with this project, the most obvious 
one being the city's inability to fund such a stadium.[32] The team and 
city have both attempted to bring business partners in on the proposed 
$800 million project, which would be located in downtown San Diego's East 
Village[33] and include upgrades to the area and infrastructure, but all 
efforts have failed so far. The Chargers had a clause in their contract, 
to the effect that if they paid off all debts to the city and county for 
the upgrades to the current stadium by 2007, then the team could pull out 
of its lease in 2008; however, the clause has not, as yet, been activated. 
On February 19, 2015, the Chargers and the Oakland Raiders announced that 
they would build a privately financed $1.7 billion stadium in Carson, California 
if they were to move to the Los Angeles market.[34] Both teams stated that 
they would continue to attempt to get stadiums built in their respective 
cities.[35] On April 22, 2015, the Carson City Council bypassed the option 
to put the stadium to public vote and approved the plan 3-0.[36] The council 
voted without having clarified several issues, including who would finance 
the stadium, how the required three-way land swap would be performed, and 
how it would raise enough revenue if only one team moved in as tenant.[37] 
On January 4, 2016, the Rams, Raiders, and the Chargers all filed for relocation 
to Los Angeles and days later on January 12, 2016, NFL owners voted to 
approve the Rams relocation from St. Louis to the Greater Los Angeles Area 
and the Inglewood Stadium 30-2, with the Chargers given a one-year option 
to join (the Raiders also have this option should the Chargers option to 
join the Rams not be exercised before January 15, 2017 ). On January 29, 
2016, Dean Spanos announced that the Chargers will stay in San Diego for 
the 2016 NFL season after the Chargers agreed to share a stadium with the 
Rams. On February 23, 2016, the Chargers announced that their stadium efforts 
will be focused on East Village in Downtown San Diego 1 month later on 
March 30, 2016, details of the intitative and the stadium proposal were 
unveiled to the media. On April 21, 2016, renderings of the downtown stadium 
were unveiled and on April 23, 2016, signature gathering for the Chargers 
downtown stadium began and on June 10, 2016, the Chargers intitative gathered 
110,786 signatures were enough to put the proposal on ballot. On July 12, 
2016, City Clerk Liz Malland announced the Chargers stadium intitative 
had enough valid signatures to be put to a vote on November and on July 
18, 2016, the San Diego City Council voted 8-0 to put the Chargers stadium 
plan and the Citizens on the November ballot. However, despair vigorous 
campaigning and millions of dollars spent, voters overwhelmingly rejected 
the ballot plan 57%-43%, placing serious doubt about the future of the
