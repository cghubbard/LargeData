Martin John Krug (10 September 1888 â€“ 27 June 1966) was a Koblenz, Germany-born 
major league infielder with the Boston Red Sox (1912) and Chicago Cubs 
(1922). He was a backup shortstop for the 1912 World Series champion Red 
Sox, but had little opportunity to play behind starter Heinie Wagner.[1]
