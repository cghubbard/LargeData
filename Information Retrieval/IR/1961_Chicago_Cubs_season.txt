The 1961 Chicago Cubs season was the 90th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 86th in the National League and the 46th at Wrigley Field. In the first 
season under their College of Coaches, the Cubs finished seventh in the 
National League with a record of 64–90, 29 games behind the Cincinnati 
Reds. This season marked the introduction of the so-called "College of 
Coaches", a system instituted by owner Philip K. Wrigley after input from 
El Tappe. Under this system, the Cubs would have no single manager, but 
instead would have a rotating series of eight coaches, with one managing 
the team while others served as either assistant coaches or minor league 
field personnel. Four different men served as manager during 1961: Tappe, 
who served the most games in the position and had a record of 42–54; Harry 
Craft, who had a record of 7–9; Vedie Himsl, who had a record of 10–21; 
and Lou Klein, who was brought on board in midseason and had a record of 
5–6. Other coaches in the system during the season were Charlie Grimm – 
the team's manager in 1960 – Bobby Adams, Dick Cole, Ripper Collins, Goldie 
Holt, Fred Martin and Verlon Walker. The team improved to 64–90, four games 
better than their 1960 record, although none of the four managers posted 
a winning record individually. The experiment would be carried over into 
the 1962 season. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos = Position;
