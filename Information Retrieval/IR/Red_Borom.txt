Edward "Red" Jones Borom (October 30, 1915 – January 7, 2011) was a Major 
League Baseball player who played two seasons and won a World Series ring 
with the Detroit Tigers in 1945. Born in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Borom 
was 28 years old before he made it to the big leagues. He only played one 
full season in the major leagues, and that season was spent with the 1945 
World Series champion Detroit Tigers. Borom also played professional and 
semi-pro baseball for over 15 years from the mid-1930s into the 1950s. 
Borom served in the U.S. Army briefly in 1943, but was released because 
of migraine headaches. "Two days after getting home, I got a call from 
Jack Zeller, general manager of Detroit ... Four days after getting out 
of the service, I was in training camp with Detroit in Evansville, Indiana. 
I realized it was wartime, but there were some good players still in the 
majors."[1] In 1945, Borom played the entire season with Detroit. Playing 
in place of injured second baseman Eddie Mayo, Borom batted over .300 during 
the September pennant drive. Borom played in 55 games for the Tigers in 
1945, batting .269 with a .307 on-base percentage. He played in two games 
of the 1945 World Series. Describing his appearance in the World Series, 
Borom said: "I hit a ground ball up the middle, off the glove of pitcher 
Hank Borowy. The shortstop, Roy Hughes, threw me out on an extremely close 
play. I thought I had a base hit."[2] Borom also pinch-ran for catcher 
Bob Swift in game three. When asked about his biggest thrill in baseball, 
Borom responded: "When Hank Greenberg hit the bases-loaded home run against 
the Browns [in September 1945] and we were behind 3–2 at the time. I was 
the runner on third, and when I saw the ball headed for the seats and knew 
we were in the World Series. Nothing could surpass that."[1] In 1946, as 
veteran players returned from World War II, Borom did not make Detroit's 
roster. Borom played several more years of minor league and semipro ball. 
Borom was involved with two NBC tournament titlists – Wichita's Boeing 
Bombers in 1942 as player and Sinton, Texas, in 1951 as manager.[3] Reflecting 
on his career, Red observed, "I guess a career that looked like it was 
headed nowhere for so long turned out pretty well." Borom was inducted 
into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978 and the Kansas Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1996.[3] After retiring from baseball, Borom worked 25 years 
for a freight company in Dallas. He died on January 7, 2011, in Dallas 
as one of the oldest living former Major Leaguers. He attended Society 
for American Baseball Research meetings in the DFW area (Hall-Ruggles Chapter)
