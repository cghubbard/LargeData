Robert William Patrick Broeg (March 18, 1918 â€“ October 28, 2005) was an 
American sportswriter. Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, he officially 
covered the St. Louis Cardinals for forty years. He graduated from Cleveland 
High School (Class of '36) and the University of Missouri before entering 
the United States Marines. He served in Washington as a result of an eye 
injury suffered at birth. After the war, Broeg joined the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 
He was privy to many important events in baseball history. Broeg was partially 
responsible for the famous picture of Eddie Gaedel at the plate in 1951. 
He told the photographer to stay at the game until Gaedel came to the plate 
and the picture was taken. Later, he helped Bob Gibson win the 1967 World 
Series. Gibson was unable to get breakfast at the Cardinals' hotel in Boston, 
so Broeg delivered a ham and egg sandwich to the star right-hander. Gibson 
pitched a complete game and carried his team to victory. Among other things, 
Broeg is known for coining the nickname "Stan the Man" for Cardinal baseball 
player Stan Musial, championing the Hall of Fame causes of Cardinals Red 
Schoendienst, Enos Slaughter and Chick Hafey and helping to devise, and 
successfully push for the first pension plan for veteran major-league players. 
Broeg was named to the Board of Directors of the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 1972, a position he held for 28 years. He was also a longtime member 
of the Committee on Baseball Veterans. His knowledge was reported to be 
encyclopedic, even into his 80s. He penned his last column in 2004. The 
St. Louis chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research is named 
for Bob Broeg. He was awarded the J. G. Taylor Spink Award in 1979. He 
was elected to the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame 
in 1997. Broeg said he wished his epitaph to read, "Hopefully, he was fair, 
as in just, not as in mediocre." Appropriately, Bob Broeg died five hours
