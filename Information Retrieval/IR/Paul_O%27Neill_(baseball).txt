Paul Andrew O'Neill (born February 25, 1963) is a retired right fielder 
and Major League Baseball player who won five World Series while playing 
for the Cincinnati Reds (1985–1992) and New York Yankees (1993–2001).[1] 
In a 17-year career, O'Neill compiled 281 home runs, 1,269 runs batted 
in, 2,107 hits, and a lifetime batting average of .288. O'Neill won the 
American League batting title in 1994 with a .359 average and was a five-time 
All-Star in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998.[2] O'Neill is the only player 
to have played on the winning team in three perfect games. He was in right 
field for the Reds for Tom Browning's perfect game in 1988. He caught the 
final out (a fly ball) in the Yankees' David Wells' perfect game in 1998, 
and he made a diving catch in right field and doubled to help the Yankees 
win David Cone's perfect game in 1999.[3] A native of Columbus, Ohio,[4] 
O'Neill attended Brookhaven High School. O'Neill and his family were fans 
of the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball. On a visit to the Reds' 
Crosley Field shortly before it closed, six-year-old Paul had his picture 
taken wearing a Reds batting helmet and holding a toy bat. Over his shoulder 
could be seen Roberto Clemente of the opposing Pittsburgh Pirates. Like 
Clemente, O'Neill would become a right fielder and wear uniform number 
21. His older sister is Molly O'Neill, a noted chef and cookbook author 
who was a food writer for The New York Times in 2000.[5] He was also an 
outstanding high school basketball player earning all-state honors in his 
senior year 1981 and Central District Player of the Year. O'Neill was drafted 
by the Reds in the fourth round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft.[6] 
O'Neill made his major-league debut on September 3, 1985 and singled in 
his first at-bat. For the rest of the 1985 season, O'Neill played in five 
games with four hits and one RBI.[7] He spent most of the 1986 season in 
the minors. He played only in three games with the Major League team during 
1986 and did not get a hit in the majors that year. O'Neill split his time 
between the minors and the Major League team in 1987. He appeared in 84 
games for the Reds that year, batting .256 with seven home runs and 28 
RBI.[7] In 1988, his first full season with the Reds, O'Neill played 145 
games, batting .252 with 16 home runs and 73 RBI. In a 1989 game against 
the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium, O'Neill fielded a base hit, 
couldn't hold on to the ball, and kicked it, left-footed, back to the infield, 
to prevent baserunner Steve Jeltz from scoring. Jeltz would score anyway 
on a passed ball, but the incident is remembered as one of the all-time 
baseball "bloopers." A broadcaster quipped: "The Cincinnati Bengals are 
on the phone!" O'Neill played 117 games in 1989 batting .276 with 15 home 
runs and 74 RBI.[7] In 1990, O'Neill played in 145 games batting .270 with 
16 home runs and 78 RBI. O'Neill batted .277 during the 1990 postseason 
with a home run and 5 RBI as the Reds won the World Series over the Oakland 
Athletics. O'Neill clashed with Reds manager Lou Piniella, who wanted O'Neill 
to change his swing to hit more home runs.[8] In response to the clash, 
O'Neill improved greatly in 1991 by playing 152 games with a career high 
of 28 home runs. He batted .256 with 91 RBI as well. In his final season 
as a member of the Reds, O'Neill played in 148 games batting .246 with 
14 home runs and 66 RBI.[7] On November 3, 1992, the Reds traded O'Neill 
to the Yankees for Roberto Kelly.[9] He was immediately inserted into the 
lineup as the #3 hitter, replacing team Captain Don Mattingly. He would 
maintain that spot in the lineup regularly for the rest of his career. 
In his first season as a Yankee, O'Neill played 141 games batting .311 
with 20 home runs and 75 RBI.[7] During the lockout-shortened 1994 season, 
O'Neill played 103 games with a .359 batting average, 21 home runs, and 
83 RBI which led him to be selected to his second All-Star game. O'Neill 
won the batting title, and the Yankees led the East division by six and 
a half games when the players' lockout ended the season.[10] In 1995, O'Neill 
played in 127 games batting .300 with 22 home runs, 96 RBI, and an MLB-leading 
25 double plays committed. He led the Yankees to the postseason for the 
first time since 1981, but they lost to the Seattle Mariners in the division 
series despite winning the first 2 games.[11] On April 30, 1996, O'Neill 
hit a long home run to Eutaw Street off of Arthur Rhodes while playing 
at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. O'Neill famously was his own worst critic, 
seemingly never satisfied with his own performance and known for his emotion 
on the field; when disappointed with his performance or angry with an umpire's 
decision he would attack water coolers or toss bats on the field.[12] His 
tirades were both praised and criticized by the media and fans. O'Neill 
was involved in a brawl with Seattle catcher John Marzano. O'Neill had 
complained to the umpire that the previous pitch was high and inside. Marzano 
then hit the much bigger Paul O'Neill with a haymaker. The two grappled, 
and the benches cleared. During the 1996 season, O'Neill played in 150 
games batting .302, 19 home runs, 91 RBI, and a career-high 102 walks. 
He ended Game 5 of the 1996 World Series by robbing former Yankee teammate 
Luis Polonia of the Atlanta Braves of an extra-base hit, preserving a 1–0 
victory for the Yankees. The Yankees would then win the series, which was 
their first World Series pennant since 1978. In 1997, O'Neill played in 
149 games batting .324 with 21 home runs and 117 RBI. He led the Yankees 
into the postseason again but lost the division series to the Cleveland 
Indians.[7] In 1998, O'Neill played in 152 games batting .317 with 24 home 
runs and 116 RBI. He led the AL by grounding into 22 double plays. O'Neill 
led the Yankees into the World Series where they won against the San Diego 
Padres in a 4-game sweep and helped the team win a record 125 games.[13] 
In 1999, O'Neill played in 153 games batting .285 with 19 home runs and 
110 RBI. O'Neill played Game 4 of the 1999 World Series just hours after 
his father died. The Yankees eventually won the game and swept the Braves 
to win their 25th World Series Championship.[14] In 2000, O'Neill played 
in 142 games batting .283 with 18 home runs and 100 RBI. He led the Yankees 
into the postseason again, who won the World Series over the New York Mets.[15] 
In 2001, O'Neill played in 137 games batting .267 with 21 home runs and 
70 RBI. In Game 5 of the 2001 World Series, O'Neill received a sendoff 
from New York fans. While standing in right field in the 9th inning with 
the Yankees down 2–0, the entire stadium chanted his name. When the inning 
ended, O'Neill was still being cheered. With tears in his eyes, he tipped 
his cap, and another roar went up from the crowd at Yankee Stadium. The 
Yankees won the game 3–2, but lost the series 4 games to 3.[16] O'Neill 
was fondly remembered by Yankee fans as the "heart and soul" of the team's 
dynasty in the 1990s. Yankee owner George Steinbrenner also labeled him 
as a "Warrior."[17] He was given this nickname due to his passion and love 
for the game. Since his retirement after the 2001 World Series, his number 
21 has only been worn once, when relief pitcher LaTroy Hawkins briefly 
wore the number to start the 2008 season but, on April 16, 2008, Hawkins 
switched to number 22 in response to the criticism he received by many 
Yankee fans, all the more suggesting that number 21 may one day be retired 
for O'Neill.[18] The Yankees honored O'Neill with a plaque in Monument 
Park on August 9, 2014.[19] In 1995, while still a player for the Yankees, 
O'Neill was featured in a cameo role on the NBC sitcom Seinfeld. In the 
episode entitled "The Wink", O'Neill is approached by Cosmo Kramer in the 
Yankees' locker room and is told by Kramer that he must hit two home runs 
in the same game so that Kramer can retrieve a birthday card signed by 
all the Yankees from a little boy who wasn't supposed to get it in the 
first place. O'Neill replies that this is very difficult and that he is 
not usually a home run hitter; he then asks Kramer, "How'd you get in here 
anyways?" In the ensuing game, O'Neill hits a home run and later appears 
to have hit a second; the apparent inside-the-park home run is scored a 
triple due to the other team's error, so the little boy Kramer is trying 
to appease is not satisfied. Kramer manages to get the Yankee-signed birthday 
card back from the boy, but he has now promised the boy that O'Neill will 
catch a fly ball in his hat during the next game. (Interestingly, such 
an act would be illegal under Major League Baseball rules).[20] Starting 
after his retirement from baseball in 2001, O'Neill now serves as an analyst 
on the New York Yankees Pre-Game Show and the New York Yankees Post-Game 
Show, as well as a color commentator for the YES Network.[1] O'Neill returned 
to Ohio to live with his family. On July 7, 2009, O'Neill was inducted 
into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame[21] (18 W. 33rd St. inside 
Foley's NY Pub & Restaurant) in New York City along with longtime Los Angeles 
Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley, broadcaster Vin Scully, former player Steve 
Garvey, umpire Jim Joyce, and blind sports reporter Ed Lucas. In October 
2013, O'Neill was said to be interested in leaving his broadcasting career 
in favor of managing his former team, the Cincinnati Reds.[22] O'Neill 
and his wife, Nevalee, were neighbors in Columbus. They have three children, 
and live in Montgomery, Ohio.[4] After retiring from his playing career, 
O'Neill authored a book entitled Me and My Dad: A Baseball Memoir. The 
book discusses his relationship with his father, who instilled in him a 
love for the game of baseball.[4] O'Neill endorsed Donald Trump for President 
of the United States at a press conference in Jupiter, Florida, according
