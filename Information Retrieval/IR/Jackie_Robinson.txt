Negro leagues Major League Baseball Jack Roosevelt "Jackie" Robinson (January 
31, 1919 – October 24, 1972) was an American professional baseball second 
baseman who became the first African American to play in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) in the modern era.[1] Robinson broke the baseball color line when 
the Brooklyn Dodgers started him at first base on April 15, 1947. The Dodgers, 
by signing Robinson, heralded the end of racial segregation in professional 
baseball that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues since the 
1880s.[2] Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.[3] 
Robinson had an exceptional 10-year baseball career. He was the recipient 
of the inaugural MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, was an All-Star 
for six consecutive seasons from 1949 through 1954, and won the National 
League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949—the first black player so honored.[4][5] 
Robinson played in six World Series and contributed to the Dodgers' 1955 
World Series championship. In 1997, MLB "universally" retired his uniform 
number, 42, across all major league teams; he was the first pro athlete 
in any sport to be so honored. MLB also adopted a new annual tradition, 
"Jackie Robinson Day", for the first time on April 15, 2004, on which every 
player on every team wears No. 42. Robinson's character, his use of nonviolence, 
and his unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation 
which then marked many other aspects of American life. He influenced the 
culture of and contributed significantly to the Civil Rights Movement.[6][7] 
Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB, and the first 
black vice president of a major American corporation, Chock full o'Nuts. 
In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned 
financial institution based in Harlem, New York. In recognition of his 
achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the 
Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Medal of Freedom. Robinson was 
born on January 31, 1919, into a family of sharecroppers in Cairo, Georgia. 
He was the youngest of five children born to Mallie (McGriff) and Jerry 
Robinson, after siblings Edgar, Frank, Matthew (nicknamed "Mack"), and 
Willa Mae.[8][9][10] His middle name was in honor of former President Theodore 
Roosevelt, who died 25 days before Robinson was born.[11][12] After Robinson's 
father left the family in 1920, they moved to Pasadena, California.[13][14][15] 
The extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing 
two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson's mother worked 
various odd jobs to support the family.[16] Growing up in relative poverty 
in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were 
excluded from many recreational opportunities.[17] As a result, Robinson 
joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him 
to abandon it.[17][18][19] In 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington 
Junior High School and enrolled at John Muir High School (Muir Tech).[20] 
Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson's older brothers Mack (himself 
an accomplished athlete and silver medalist at the 1936 Summer Olympics)[19] 
and Frank inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports.[21][22] At 
Muir Tech, Robinson played several sports at the varsity level and lettered 
in four of them: football, basketball, track, and baseball.[15] He played 
shortstop and catcher on the baseball team, quarterback on the football 
team, and guard on the basketball team. With the track and field squad, 
he won awards in the broad jump. He was also a member of the tennis team.[23] 
In 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual 
Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the Pomona 
annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future Hall of 
Famers Ted Williams and Bob Lemon.[24] In late January 1937, the Pasadena 
Star-News newspaper reported that Robinson "for two years has been the 
outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball 
and tennis."[25] After Muir, Robinson attended Pasadena Junior College 
(PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, 
football, baseball, and track.[26] On the football team, he played quarterback 
and safety. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, 
and he broke school broad-jump records held by his brother Mack.[15] As 
at Muir High School, most of Jackie's teammates were white.[24] While playing 
football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from 
which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military.[27][28] 
In 1938, he was elected to the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball 
and selected as the region's Most Valuable Player.[22][29] That year, Robinson 
was one of 10 students named to the school's Order of the Mast and Dagger 
(Omicron Mu Delta), awarded to students performing "outstanding service 
to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of 
recognition."[30] Also while at PJC, he was elected to the Lancers, a student-run 
police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities.[31] 
An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures 
he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly 
in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing 
the detention of a black friend by police.[32] Robinson received a two-year 
suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between 
Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the 
face of racial antagonism.[33] Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank 
Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed 
in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic 
career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where 
he could remain closer to Frank's family.[22][34] After graduating from 
PJC in spring 1939,[35] Robinson enrolled at UCLA, where he became the 
school's first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, 
basketball, football, and track.[36][37] He was one of four black players 
on the 1939 UCLA Bruins football team; the others were Woody Strode, Kenny 
Washington, and Ray Bartlett. Washington, Strode, and Robinson made up 
three of the team's four backfield players.[38] At a time when only a few 
black students played mainstream college football, this made UCLA college 
football's most integrated team.[39][40] In track and field, Robinson won 
the 1940 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships in the long jump, jumping 
24 ft 10 1⁄4 in (7.58 m).[41] Belying his future career, baseball was Robinson's 
"worst sport" at UCLA; he hit .097 in his only season, although in his 
first game he went 4-for-4 and twice stole home.[42] While a senior at 
UCLA, Robinson met his future wife, Rachel Isum (born 1922), a UCLA freshman 
who was familiar with Robinson's athletic career at PJC.[43] In the spring 
semester of 1941, despite his mother's and Isum's reservations, Robinson 
left college just shy of graduation.[44] He took a job as an assistant 
athletic director with the government's National Youth Administration (NYA) 
in Atascadero, California.[45][46][47] After the government ceased NYA 
operations, Robinson traveled to Honolulu in fall 1941 to play football 
for the semi-professional, racially integrated Honolulu Bears.[45][47] 
After a short season, Robinson returned to California in December 1941 
to pursue a career as running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the 
Pacific Coast Football League.[48] By that time, however, the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place, drawing the United States into 
World War II and ending Robinson's nascent football career.[45] In 1942, 
Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in 
Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several 
other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School 
(OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 
guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral, few black applicants 
were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership.[49] 
As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed 
for several months.[50] After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe 
Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then 
an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War),[51] the men were accepted 
into OCS.[45][50][52] The experience led to a personal friendship between 
Robinson and Louis.[53][54] Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned 
as a second lieutenant in January 1943.[37] Shortly afterward, Robinson 
and Isum were formally engaged.[50] After receiving his commission, Robinson 
was reassigned to Fort Hood, Texas, where he joined the 761st "Black Panthers" 
Tank Battalion. While at Fort Hood, Robinson often used his weekend leave 
to visit the Rev. Karl Downs, President of Sam Huston College (now Huston-Tillotson 
University) in nearby Austin, Texas; Downs had been Robinson's pastor at 
Scott United Methodist Church while Robinson attended PJC.[32][55] An event 
on July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's military career.[56] While awaiting 
results of hospital tests on the ankle he had injured in junior college, 
Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the 
Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered 
Robinson to move to the back of the bus.[57][58][59] Robinson refused. 
The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned 
the military police, who took Robinson into custody.[57][60] When Robinson 
later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning 
by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed.[57][61] 
After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize 
the legal action,[62] Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where 
the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, 
including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson 
did not drink.[57][63] By the time of the court-martial in August 1944, 
the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination 
during questioning.[57] Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of 
nine officers.[57] The experiences Robinson was subjected to during the 
court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was 
subjected to racist attacks.[64] Although his former unit, the 761st Tank 
Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War 
II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed 
overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.[65] After his acquittal, he 
was transferred to Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, where he served as a coach 
for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in November 1944.[66] 
While there, Robinson met a former player for the Kansas City Monarchs 
of the Negro American League, who encouraged Robinson to write the Monarchs 
and ask for a tryout.[67] Robinson took the former player's advice and 
wrote to Monarchs' co-owner Thomas Baird.[68] After his discharge, Robinson 
briefly returned to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs.[48] 
Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl 
Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then 
of the Southwestern Athletic Conference.[69] The job included coaching 
the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season.[55] As it was a fledgling 
program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even 
resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games.[69][70] 
Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected 
as a disciplinarian coach,[55] and drew the admiration of, among others, 
Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of 
the Harlem Globetrotters.[71] In early 1945, while Robinson was at Sam 
Huston College, the Kansas City Monarchs sent him a written offer to play 
professional baseball in the Negro leagues.[55][72] Robinson accepted a 
contract for $400 per month.[45][73] Although he played well for the Monarchs, 
Robinson was frustrated with the experience. He had grown used to a structured 
playing environment in college, and the Negro leagues' disorganization 
and embrace of gambling interests appalled him.[74][75] The hectic travel 
schedule also placed a burden on his relationship with Isum, with whom 
he could now communicate only by letter.[76] In all, Robinson played 47 
games at shortstop for the Monarchs, hitting .387 with five home runs, 
and registering 13 stolen bases.[77] He also appeared in the 1945 Negro 
League All-Star Game, going hitless in five at-bats.[78] During the season, 
Robinson pursued potential major-league interests. The Boston Red Sox held 
a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson and other black players on April 16.[79] 
The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist 
sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick.[80] 
Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial 
epithets.[81] Robinson left the tryout humiliated,[79] and more than fourteen 
years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team 
to integrate its roster.[82] Other teams, however, had more serious interest 
in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, Branch Rickey, club president 
and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues 
for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster. Rickey selected Robinson 
from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible 
assignment to Brooklyn's International League farm club, the Montreal Royals.[83] 
Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could 
withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him.[7][84] 
In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945,[85] Rickey asked Robinson 
if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting 
angrily—a concern given Robinson's prior arguments with law enforcement 
officials at PJC and in the military.[45] Robinson was aghast: "Are you 
looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?"[84][86] Rickey replied 
that he needed a Negro player "with guts enough not to fight back."[84][86] 
After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to "turn the other cheek" to 
racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, 
equal to $7,900 today.[87][88] Rickey did not offer compensation to the 
Monarchs, instead believing all Negro league players were free agents due 
to the contracts' not containing a reserve clause.[89] Among those Rickey 
discussed prospects with was Wendell Smith, writer for the black weekly 
Pittsburgh Courier, who according to Cleveland Indians owner and team president 
Bill Veeck "influenced Rickey to take Jack Robinson, for which he's never 
completely gotten credit."[90] Although he required Robinson to keep the 
arrangement a secret for the time being, Rickey committed to formally signing 
Robinson before November 1, 1945.[91] On October 23, it was publicly announced 
that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season.[45][88][92] 
On the same day, with representatives of the Royals and Dodgers present, 
Robinson formally signed his contract with the Royals.[93] In what was 
later referred to as "The Noble Experiment",[45][94] Robinson was the first 
black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s.[95] 
He was not necessarily the best player in the Negro leagues,[96] and black 
talents Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson were upset when Robinson was selected 
first.[97] Larry Doby, who broke the color line in the American League 
the same year as Robinson, said, "One of the things that was disappointing 
and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack 
was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think that's one of 
the reasons why Josh died so early – he was heartbroken."[98] Rickey's 
offer allowed Robinson to leave behind the Monarchs and their grueling 
bus rides, and he went home to Pasadena. That September, he signed with 
Chet Brewer's Kansas City Royals, a post-season barnstorming team in the 
California Winter League.[99] Later that off-season, he briefly toured 
South America with another barnstorming team, while his fiancée Isum pursued 
nursing opportunities in New York City.[100] On February 10, 1946, Robinson 
and Isum were married by their old friend, the Rev. Karl Downs.[45][101][102] 
In 1946, Robinson arrived at Daytona Beach, Florida, for spring training 
with the Montreal Royals of the Class AAA International League (the designation 
of "AAA" for the highest level of minor league baseball was first used 
in the 1946 season). Clay Hopper, the manager of the Royals, asked Rickey 
to assign Robinson to any other Dodger affiliate, but Rickey refused.[103] 
Robinson's presence was controversial in racially charged Florida. As he 
was not allowed to stay with his teammates at the team hotel, he lodged 
instead at the home of a local black politician.[104][105] Since the Dodgers 
organization did not own a spring training facility (the Dodger-controlled 
spring training compound in Vero Beach known as "Dodgertown" did not open 
until spring 1948),[106] scheduling was subject to the whim of area localities, 
several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or Johnny Wright, 
another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers' organization 
in January. In Sanford, Florida, the police chief threatened to cancel 
games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there; as 
a result, Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach.[107][108] In Jacksonville, 
the stadium was padlocked shut without warning on game day, by order of 
the city's Parks and Public Property director.[109][110] In DeLand, a scheduled 
day game was called off, ostensibly because of faulty electrical lighting.[111][112] 
After much lobbying of local officials by Rickey himself, the Royals were 
allowed to host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach.[113][114] Robinson 
made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 
17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers. 
Robinson thus became the first black player to openly play for a minor 
league team against a major league team since the de facto baseball color 
line had been implemented in the 1880s.[2] Later in spring training, after 
some less-than-stellar performances, Robinson was shifted from shortstop 
to second base, allowing him to make shorter throws to first base.[63] 
Robinson's performance soon rebounded. On April 18, 1946, Roosevelt Stadium 
hosted the Jersey City Giants' season opener against the Montreal Royals, 
marking the professional debut of the Royals' Jackie Robinson and the first 
time the color barrier had been broken in a game between two minor league 
clubs.[115] Pitching against Robinson was Warren Sandel who had played 
against him when they both lived in California. During Robinson's first 
at bat, the Jersey City catcher, Dick Bouknight, demanded that Sandel throw 
at Robinson, but Sandel refused. Although Sandel induced Robinson to ground 
out at his first at bat, in his five trips to the plate, Robinson ended 
up with four hits, including his first hit, a three-run home run, in the 
game's third inning.[116] He also scored four runs, drove in three, and 
stole two bases in the Royals' 14–1 victory.[117] Robinson proceeded to 
lead the International League that season with a .349 batting average and 
.985 fielding percentage,[21] and he was named the league's Most Valuable 
Player.[118] Although he often faced hostility while on road trips (the 
Royals were forced to cancel a Southern exhibition tour, for example),[63] 
the Montreal fan base enthusiastically supported Robinson.[119][120] Whether 
fans supported or opposed it, Robinson's presence on the field was a boon 
to attendance; more than one million people went to games involving Robinson 
in 1946, an amazing figure by International League standards.[121] In the 
fall of 1946, following the baseball season, Robinson returned home to 
California and briefly played professional basketball for the short-lived 
Los Angeles Red Devils.[122][123] The following year, six days before the 
start of the 1947 season, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. 
With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played 
his initial major league season as a first baseman.[84] On April 15, 1947, 
Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 
28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more 
than 14,000 black patrons.[124] Although he failed to get a base hit, he 
walked and scored a run in the Dodgers' 5–3 victory.[124] Robinson became 
the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball color 
line.[125] Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came 
to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.[97] Robinson's promotion 
met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and 
white major league players.[121][126] However, racial tension existed in 
the Dodger clubhouse.[127] Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit 
out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when 
Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed 
the team, "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes 
like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. 
What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use 
the money, I will see that you are all traded."[128] Robinson was also 
derided by opposing teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened 
to strike if Robinson played, but also to spread the walkout across the 
entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' 
team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the New York Herald Tribune's 
Rutherford "Rud" Rennie. The reporter, concerned about projecting Hyland's 
anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his Tribune colleague and editor, 
Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected 
Hyland.[129][130][131] The Woodward article made national headlines. After 
the threat was exposed, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball 
Commissioner Happy Chandler let it be known that any striking players would 
be suspended. "You will find that the friends that you think you have in 
the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts," threatened 
Chandler. "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will 
encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if 
it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States 
of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another."[131][132][133][134] 
Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports 
Reporting.[131] New York Times columnist Red Smith turned to the Cardinals' 
1947 racial strike in 1977, as a spate of commemorative articles appeared 
on the 30th anniversary of Robinson's signing with the Dodgers. Smith remembered 
his old Herald Tribune colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike 
conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, "…if Rud Rennie and Stanley 
Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the New York Herald Tribune."[135] 
Robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents 
(particularly the Cardinals). At one time, he received a seven-inch gash 
in his leg from Enos Slaughter.[136] On April 22, 1947, during a game between 
the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies, Phillies players and manager 
Ben Chapman called Robinson a "nigger" from their dugout and yelled that 
he should "go back to the cotton fields".[137][138] Rickey later recalled 
that Chapman "did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers. When he poured 
out that string of unconscionable abuse, he solidified and united thirty 
men."[139] Robinson did, however, receive significant encouragement from 
several major league players. Robinson named Lee "Jeep" Handley, who played 
for the Phillies at the time, as the first opposing player to wish him 
well.[140] Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinson's defense 
with the famous line, "You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not 
one of them."[141] In 1948, Reese put his arm around Robinson in response 
to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Cincinnati.[142] 
A statue by sculptor William Behrends, unveiled at KeySpan Park on November 
1, 2005, commemorates this event by representing Reese with his arm around 
Robinson.[143] Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg, who had to deal with 
racial epithets during his career, also encouraged Robinson. Following 
an incident where Greenberg collided with Robinson at first base, he "whispered 
a few words into Robinson's ear", which Robinson later characterized as 
"words of encouragement."[144] Greenberg had advised him to overcome his 
critics by defeating them in games.[144] Robinson also talked frequently 
with Larry Doby, who endured his own hardships since becoming the first 
black player in the American League with the Cleveland Indians, as the 
two spoke to one another via telephone throughout the season.[145] Robinson 
finished the season having played in 151 games for the Dodgers, with a 
batting average of .297, an on-base percentage of .383, and a .427 slugging 
percentage. He had 175 hits (scoring 125 runs) including 31 doubles, 5 
triples, and 12 home runs, driving in 48 runs for the year. Robinson led 
the league in sacrifice hits, with 28, and in stolen bases, with 29.[146] 
His cumulative performance earned him the inaugural Major League Baseball 
Rookie of the Year Award (separate National and American League Rookie 
of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).[147] Following Stanky's 
trade to the Boston Braves in March 1948, Robinson took over second base, 
where he logged a .980 fielding percentage that year (second in the National 
League at the position, fractionally behind Stanky).[148] Robinson had 
a batting average of .296 and 22 stolen bases for the season.[149] In a 
12–7 win against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 29, 1948, he hit for 
the cycle—a home run, a triple, a double, and a single in the same game.[150] 
The Dodgers briefly moved into first place in the National League in late 
August 1948, but they ultimately finished third as the Braves went on to 
win the league title and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the World Series.[151] 
Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 as a number of other black players 
entered the major leagues. Larry Doby (who broke the color barrier in the 
American League on July 5, 1947, just 11 weeks after Robinson) and Satchel 
Paige played for the Cleveland Indians, and the Dodgers had three other 
black players besides Robinson.[148] In February 1948, he signed a $12,500 
contract (equal to $123,321 today) with the Dodgers; while a significant 
amount, this was less than Robinson made in the off-season from a vaudeville 
tour, where he answered pre-set baseball questions, and a speaking tour 
of the South. Between the tours, he underwent surgery on his right ankle. 
Because of his off-season activities, Robinson reported to training camp 
30 pounds (14 kg) overweight. He lost the weight during training camp, 
but dieting left him weak at the plate.[152] In 1948, Wendell Smith's book, 
Jackie Robinson: My Own Story, was released.[153] In the spring of 1949, 
Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to 
the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours 
at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field.[154] Sisler 
taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier 
to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball.[154] Robinson also noted 
that "Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until 
the last fraction of a second".[154] The tutelage helped Robinson raise 
his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949.[154] In addition 
to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was 
second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 
124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored.[84] For the performance Robinson 
earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League.[84] Baseball 
fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star 
Game—the first All-Star Game to include black players.[155][156] That year, 
a song about Robinson by Buddy Johnson, "Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit 
That Ball?", reached number 13 on the charts; Count Basie recorded a famous 
version.[157] Ultimately, the Dodgers won the National League pennant, 
but lost in five games to the New York Yankees in the 1949 World Series.[148] 
Summer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for Robinson. In July, he was 
called to testify before the United States House of Representatives' Committee 
on Un-American Activities (HUAC) concerning statements made that April 
by black athlete and actor Paul Robeson. Robinson was reluctant to testify, 
but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively affect his 
career if he declined.[158] In 1950, Robinson led the National League in 
double plays made by a second baseman with 133.[150] His salary that year 
was the highest any Dodger had been paid to that point: $35,000[159] ($344,820 
in 2016 dollars[160]). He finished the year with 99 runs scored, a .328 
batting average, and 12 stolen bases.[149] The year saw the release of 
a film biography of Robinson's life, The Jackie Robinson Story, in which 
Robinson played himself,[161] and actress Ruby Dee played Rachael "Rae" 
(Isum) Robinson.[162] The project had been previously delayed when the 
film's producers refused to accede to demands of two Hollywood studios 
that the movie include scenes of Robinson being tutored in baseball by 
a white man.[163] The New York Times wrote that Robinson, "doing that rare 
thing of playing himself in the picture's leading role, displays a calm 
assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star."[164] 
Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not sit well with Dodgers co-owner 
Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as "Rickey's prima donna".[165] 
In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. 
Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being 
re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter 
financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the 
franchise.[166] Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and 
wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, 
stating, "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be 
placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it."[167][168][169] 
Before the 1951 season, O'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of 
manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson's playing 
career. O'Malley was quoted in the Montreal Standard as saying, "Jackie 
told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial 
post"—although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally 
offered.[170][171] During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League 
in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row, 
with 137.[150] He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant. 
During the last game of the regular season, in the 13th inning, he had 
a hit to tie the game, and then won the game with a home run in the 14th. 
This forced a best-of-three playoff series against the crosstown rival 
New York Giants.[172] Despite Robinson's regular-season heroics, the Dodgers 
lost the pennant on Bobby Thomson's famous home run, known as the Shot 
Heard 'Round the World, on October 3, 1951. Overcoming his dejection, Robinson 
dutifully observed Thomson's feet to ensure he touched all the bases. Dodgers 
sportscaster Vin Scully later noted that the incident showed "how much 
of a competitor Robinson was."[173] He finished the season with 106 runs 
scored, a batting average of .335, and 25 stolen bases.[149] Robinson had 
what was an average year for him in 1952.[174] He finished the year with 
104 runs, a .308 batting average, and 24 stolen bases.[149] He did, however, 
record a career-high on-base percentage of .436.[149] The Dodgers improved 
on their performance from the year before, winning the National League 
pennant before losing the 1952 World Series to the New York Yankees in 
seven games. That year, on the television show Youth Wants to Know, Robinson 
challenged the Yankees' general manager, George Weiss, on the racial record 
of his team, which had yet to sign a black player.[175] Sportswriter Dick 
Young, whom Robinson had described as a "bigot", said, "If there was one 
flaw in Jackie, it was the common one. He believed that everything unpleasant 
that happened to him happened because of his blackness."[176] The 1952 
season was the last year Robinson was an everyday starter at second base. 
Afterward, Robinson played variously at first, second, and third bases, 
shortstop, and in the outfield, with Jim Gilliam, another black player, 
taking over everyday second base duties.[149] Robinson's interests began 
to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team. He had hoped 
to gain experience by managing in the Puerto Rican Winter League, but according 
to the New York Post, Commissioner Happy Chandler denied the request.[177] 
In 1953, Robinson had 109 runs, a .329 batting average, and 17 steals,[149] 
leading the Dodgers to another National League pennant (and another World 
Series loss to the Yankees, this time in six games). Robinson's continued 
success spawned a string of death threats.[178] He was not dissuaded, however, 
from addressing racial issues publicly. That year, he served as editor 
for Our Sports magazine, a periodical focusing on Negro sports issues; 
contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation 
by Robinson's old friend Joe Louis.[179][180] Robinson also openly criticized 
segregated hotels and restaurants that served the Dodger organization; 
a number of these establishments integrated as a result, including the 
five-star Chase Park Hotel in St. Louis.[136][181] In 1954, Robinson had 
62 runs, a .311 batting average, and 7 steals. His best day at the plate 
was on June 17, when he hit two home runs and two doubles.[149][150] The 
following autumn, Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers beat 
the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series. Although the team enjoyed 
ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson's individual career. 
He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases. The Dodgers tried Robinson in the 
outfield and as a third baseman, both because of his diminishing abilities 
and because Gilliam was established at second base.[182] Robinson, then 
37 years old, missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series.[173] 
Robinson missed the game because manager Walter Alston decided to play 
Gilliam at second and Don Hoak at third base. That season, the Dodgers' 
Don Newcombe became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty 
games in a year.[183] In 1956, Robinson had 61 runs, a .275 batting average, 
and 12 steals.[149] By then, he had begun to exhibit the effects of diabetes, 
and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional 
baseball.[177] After the season, Robinson was traded by the Dodgers to 
the arch-rival New York Giants for Dick Littlefield and $35,000 cash (equal 
to $305,147 today). The trade, however, was never completed; unbeknownst 
to the Dodgers, Robinson had already agreed with the president of Chock 
full o'Nuts to quit baseball and become an executive with the company.[184] 
Since Robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to Look 
magazine two years previously,[184] his retirement decision was revealed 
through the magazine, instead of through the Dodgers organization.[185] 
Robinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years 
of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line.[125] 
After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country 
toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration 
to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman's 
desegregation of the military in 1948.[186] Robinson's breaking of the 
baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader 
changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply 
a political matter. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that he was "a legend 
and a symbol in his own time", and that he "challenged the dark skies of 
intolerance and frustration."[187] According to historian Doris Kearns 
Goodwin, Robinson's "efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights 
revolution in America ... [His] accomplishments allowed black and white 
Americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative 
of everyone's abilities."[188] Beginning his major league career at the 
relatively advanced age of twenty-eight, he played only ten seasons from 
1947 to 1956, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers.[189] During his career, 
the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in 
six All-Star Games.[5] In 1999, he was posthumously named to the Major 
League Baseball All-Century Team.[190] Robinson's career is generally considered 
to mark the beginning of the post–"long ball" era in baseball, in which 
a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies 
that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning.[191] 
Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified 
the new era. He scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons (averaging 
more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953), had a .311 career batting average, 
a .409 career on-base percentage, a .474 slugging percentage, and substantially 
more walks than strikeouts (740 to 291).[149][189][192] Robinson was one 
of only two players during the span of 1947–56 to accumulate at least 125 
steals while registering a slugging percentage over .425 (Minnie Miñoso 
was the other).[193] He accumulated 197 stolen bases in total,[149] including 
19 steals of home. None of the latter were double steals (in which a player 
stealing home is assisted by a player stealing another base at the same 
time).[194] Robinson has been referred to by author David Falkner as "the 
father of modern base-stealing".[195] "I'm not concerned with your liking 
or disliking me ... all I ask is that you respect me as a human being." 
Historical statistical analysis indicates Robinson was an outstanding fielder 
throughout his ten years in the major leagues and at virtually every position 
he played.[196] After playing his rookie season at first base,[84] Robinson 
spent most of his career as a second baseman.[197] He led the league in 
fielding among second basemen in 1950 and 1951.[198][199] Toward the end 
of his career, he played about 2,000 innings at third base and about 1,175 
innings in the outfield, excelling at both.[196] Assessing himself, Robinson 
said, "I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me ... all I ask 
is that you respect me as a human being."[141] Regarding Robinson's qualities 
on the field, Leo Durocher said, "Ya want a guy that comes to play. This 
guy didn't just come to play. He come to beat ya. He come to stuff the 
goddamn bat right up your ass."[200] Robinson portrayed himself in the 
1950 motion picture The Jackie Robinson Story.[201] Other portrayals include: 
Robinson was also the subject of a 2016 PBS documentary, Jackie Robinson, 
which was directed by Ken Burns and features Jamie Foxx doing voice-over 
as Robinson.[216] Robinson retired from baseball at age 37 on January 5, 
1957.[217] Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, 
his doctors diagnosed him with diabetes, a disease that also afflicted 
his brothers.[218] Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, 
the state of medicine at the time could not prevent the continued deterioration 
of Robinson's physical condition from the disease.[219] In his first year 
of eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962,[65] Robinson encouraged 
voters to consider only his on-field qualifications, rather than his cultural 
impact on the game.[220] He was elected on the first ballot, becoming the 
first black player inducted into the Cooperstown museum.[21] In 1965, Robinson 
served as an analyst for ABC's Major League Baseball Game of the Week telecasts, 
the first black person to do so.[221] In 1966, Robinson was hired as general 
manager for the short-lived Brooklyn Dodgers of the Continental Football 
League.[222][223] In 1972, he served as a part-time commentator on Montreal 
Expos telecasts.[224] On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired his uniform 
number, 42, alongside those of Roy Campanella (39) and Sandy Koufax (32).[225] 
From 1957 to 1964, Robinson was the vice president for personnel at Chock 
full o'Nuts; he was the first black person to serve as vice president of 
a major American corporation.[21][226] Robinson always considered his business 
career as advancing the cause of black people in commerce and industry.[227] 
Robinson also chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People's (NAACP) million-dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957, and served 
on the organization's board until 1967.[226] In 1964, he helped found, 
with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin, Freedom National Bank—a black-owned 
and operated commercial bank based in Harlem.[226] He also served as the 
bank's first Chairman of the Board.[228] In 1970, Robinson established 
the Jackie Robinson Construction Company to build housing for low-income 
families.[226][229] Robinson was active in politics throughout his post-baseball 
life. He identified himself as a political independent,[230][231] although 
he held conservative opinions on several issues, including the Vietnam 
War (he once wrote to Martin Luther King, Jr. to defend the Johnson Administration's 
military policy).[232] After supporting Richard Nixon in his 1960 presidential 
race against John F. Kennedy, Robinson later praised Kennedy effusively 
for his stance on civil rights.[233] Robinson was angered by conservative 
Republican opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, though a higher 
percentage of Democrats voted against it in both the House and Senate. 
He became one of six national directors for Nelson Rockefeller's unsuccessful 
campaign to be nominated as the Republican candidate for the 1964 presidential 
election.[226] After the party nominated Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona 
instead, Robinson left the party's convention commenting that he now had 
"a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler's 
Germany".[234] He later became special assistant for community affairs 
when Rockefeller was re-elected governor of New York in 1966.[226] Switching 
his allegiance to the Democrats, he subsequently supported Hubert Humphrey 
against Nixon in 1968.[185] Protesting the major leagues' ongoing lack 
of minority managers and central office personnel, Robinson turned down 
an invitation to appear in an old-timers' game at Yankee Stadium in 1969.[236] 
He made his final public appearance on October 15, 1972, throwing the ceremonial 
first pitch before Game 2 of the World Series. He gratefully accepted a 
plaque honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of his MLB debut, but also 
commented, "I'm going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud when 
I look at that third base coaching line one day and see a black face managing 
in baseball."[237] This wish was fulfilled only after Robinson's death: 
following the 1974 season, the Cleveland Indians gave their managerial 
post to Frank Robinson (no relation), a Hall of Fame-bound player who would 
go on to manage three other teams. Despite the success of these two Robinsons 
and other black players, the number of African-American players in Major 
League Baseball has declined since the 1970s.[238][239] After Robinson's 
retirement from baseball, his wife Rachel Robinson pursued a career in 
academic nursing. She became an assistant professor at the Yale School 
of Nursing and director of nursing at the Connecticut Mental Health Center.[240] 
She also served on the board of the Freedom National Bank until it closed 
in 1990.[241] She and Jackie had three children: Jackie Robinson Jr. (born 
November 18, 1946, died 1971, the year before Jackie), Sharon Robinson 
(born January 13, 1950), and David Robinson (born May 14, 1952).[242] Robinson's 
eldest son, Jackie Robinson Jr., had emotional trouble during his childhood 
and entered special education at an early age.[243] He enrolled in the 
Army in search of a disciplined environment, served in the Vietnam War, 
and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965.[244] After his discharge, 
he struggled with drug problems. Robinson Jr. eventually completed the 
treatment program at Daytop Village in Seymour, Connecticut, and became 
a counselor at the institution.[245] On June 17, 1971, at the age of 24, 
he was killed in an automobile accident.[246][247] The experience with 
his son's drug addiction turned Robinson Sr. into an avid anti-drug crusader 
toward the end of his life.[248] Robinson did not long outlive his son. 
Complications of heart disease and diabetes weakened Robinson and made 
him almost blind by middle age. On October 24, 1972, nine days after his 
appearance at the World Series, Robinson died of a heart attack in his 
home at 95 Cascade Road in North Stamford, Connecticut.[84][246] Robinson's 
funeral service on October 27, 1972, at Upper Manhattan's Riverside Church 
adjacent to Grant's Tomb in Morningside Heights, attracted 2,500 mourners.[249][250] 
Many of his former teammates and other famous baseball players served as 
pallbearers, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave the eulogy.[249] Tens of thousands 
of people lined the subsequent procession route to Robinson's interment 
site at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where he is buried 
next to his son Jackie and mother-in-law Zellee Isum.[249] Twenty-five 
years after Robinson's death, the Interboro Parkway was renamed the Jackie 
Robinson Parkway in his memory. This parkway bisects the cemetery in close 
proximity to Robinson's gravesite.[251] After Robinson's death, his widow 
founded the Jackie Robinson Foundation, of which she remains an officer 
as of 2015.[252] On April 15, 2008, she announced that in 2010 the foundation 
will be opening a museum devoted to Jackie in Lower Manhattan.[253] Robinson's 
daughter, Sharon, became a midwife, educator, director of educational programming 
for MLB, and the author of two books about her father.[254] His youngest 
son, David, who has six children, is a coffee grower and social activist 
in Tanzania.[255][256] According to a poll conducted in 1947, Robinson 
was the second most popular man in the country, behind Bing Crosby.[257] 
In 1999, he was named by Time on its list of the 100 most influential people 
of the 20th century.[258] Also in 1999, he ranked number 44 on the Sporting 
News list of Baseball's 100 Greatest Players[259] and was elected to the 
Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the top vote-getter among second 
basemen.[260] Baseball writer Bill James, in The New Bill James Historical 
Baseball Abstract, ranked Robinson as the 32nd greatest player of all time 
strictly on the basis of his performance on the field, noting that he was 
one of the top players in the league throughout his career.[261] Robinson 
was among the 25 charter members of UCLA's Athletics Hall of Fame in 1984.[42] 
In 2002, Molefi Kete Asante included Robinson on his list of 100 Greatest 
African Americans.[262] Robinson has also been honored by the United States 
Postal Service on three separate postage stamps, in 1982, 1999, and 2000.[263] 
The City of Pasadena has recognized Robinson in several ways. Brookside 
Park, situated next to the Rose Bowl, features a baseball diamond and stadium 
named Jackie Robinson Field.[264] The city's Human Services Department 
operates the Jackie Robinson Center, a community outreach center that provides 
health services.[265] In 1997, a $325,000 bronze sculpture (equal to $479,887 
today) by artists Ralph Helmick, Stu Schecter, and John Outterbridge depicting 
oversized nine-foot busts of Robinson and his brother Mack was erected 
at Garfield Avenue, across from the main entrance of Pasadena City Hall; 
a granite footprint lists multiple donors to the commission project, which 
was organized by the Robinson Memorial Foundation and supported by members 
of the Robinson family.[266][267] Major League Baseball has honored Robinson 
many times since his death. In 1987, both the National and American League 
Rookie of the Year Awards were renamed the "Jackie Robinson Award" in honor 
of the first recipient (Robinson's Major League Rookie of the Year Award 
in 1947 encompassed both leagues).[268][269] On April 15, 1997, Robinson's 
jersey number, 42, was retired throughout Major League Baseball, the first 
time any jersey number had been retired throughout one of the four major 
American sports leagues. Under the terms of the retirement, a grandfather 
clause allowed the handful of players who wore number 42 to continue doing 
so in tribute to Robinson, until such time as they subsequently changed 
teams or jersey numbers.[270] This affected players such as the Mets' Butch 
Huskey and Boston's Mo Vaughn. The Yankees' Mariano Rivera, who retired 
at the end of the 2013 season,[271][272] was the last player in Major League 
Baseball to wear jersey number 42 on a regular basis. Since 1997, only 
Wayne Gretzky's number 99, retired by the NHL in 2000, has been retired 
league-wide.[273] There have also been calls for MLB to retire number 21 
league-wide in honor of Roberto Clemente, a sentiment opposed by the Robinson 
family.[274] The Hispanics Across America advocacy group wants Clemente's 
number set aside the way the late Robinson's No. 42 was in 1997, but Sharon 
Robinson maintained the position that such an honor should remain in place 
for Jackie Robinson only. As an exception to the retired-number policy, 
MLB in 2007 began honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 
42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, which is now an annual observance. 
For the 60th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, MLB invited 
players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. The gesture 
was originally the idea of outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., who sought Rachel 
Robinson's permission to wear the number.[275] After receiving her permission, 
Commissioner Bud Selig not only allowed Griffey to wear the number, but 
also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same.[276] 
Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire 
rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia 
Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates.[277] 
The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all 
members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays 
wore Robinson's number 42.[278][279] On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a 
new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his 
off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics.[220] 
In 2009, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, and umpires) 
wore number 42 on April 15.[280] At the November 2006 groundbreaking for 
a new ballpark for the New York Mets, Citi Field, it was announced that 
the main entrance, modeled on the one in Brooklyn's old Ebbets Field, would 
be called the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. The rotunda was dedicated at the 
opening of Citi Field on April 16, 2009.[281] It honors Robinson with large 
quotations spanning the inner curve of the facade and features a large 
freestanding statue of his number, 42, which has become an attraction in 
itself. Mets owner Fred Wilpon announced that, in conjunction with Citigroup 
and the Jackie Robinson Foundation, the Mets will create a Jackie Robinson 
Museum and Learning Center, located at the headquarters of the Jackie Robinson 
Foundation at One Hudson Square, along Canal Street in lower Manhattan. 
Along with the museum, scholarships will be awarded to "young people who 
live by and embody Jackie's ideals." The museum hopes to open by 2015.[282][283][284] 
Since 2004, the Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year 
has been presented the "Jackie Robinson Award".[285] Robinson has also 
been recognized outside of baseball. In December 1956, the NAACP recognized 
him with the Spingarn Medal, which it awards annually for the highest achievement 
by an African-American.[226] President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded 
Robinson the Presidential Medal of Freedom on March 26, 1984,[286] and 
on March 2, 2005, President George W. Bush gave Robinson's widow the Congressional 
Gold Medal, the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress; Robinson was 
only the second baseball player to receive the award, after Roberto Clemente.[287] 
On August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife, 
Maria Shriver, announced that Robinson was inducted into the California 
Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the 
Arts in Sacramento.[288] A number of buildings have been named in Robinson's 
honor. The UCLA Bruins baseball team plays in Jackie Robinson Stadium,[289] 
which, because of the efforts of Jackie's brother Mack, features a memorial 
statue of Robinson by sculptor Richard H. Ellis.[290] The stadium also 
unveiled a new mural of Robinson by Mike Sullivan on April 14, 2013. City 
Island Ballpark in Daytona Beach, Florida was renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark 
in 1990 and a statue of Robinson with two children stands in front of the 
ballpark. His wife Rachel was present for the dedication on September 15. 
1990.[291][292] A number of facilities at Pasadena City College (successor 
to PJC) are named in Robinson's honor, including Robinson Field, a football/soccer/track 
facility named jointly for Robinson and his brother Mack.[293] The New 
York Public School system has named a middle school after Robinson,[294] 
and Dorsey High School plays at a Los Angeles football stadium named after 
him.[295] In 1976, his home in Brooklyn, the Jackie Robinson House, was 
declared a National Historic Landmark.[296] Brooklyn residents want to 
turn his home into a city landmark.[297] Robinson also has an asteroid 
named after him, 4319 Jackierobinson.[298] In 1997, the United States Mint 
issued a Jackie Robinson commemorative silver dollar, and five dollar gold 
coin.[299] That same year, New York City renamed the Interboro Parkway 
in his honor. In 2011, the U.S. placed a plaque at Robinson's Montreal 
home to honor the ending of segregation in baseball.[300] The house, on 
8232 avenue de Gaspé near Jarry Park, was Robinson's residence when he 
played for the Montreal Royals during 1946. In a letter read during the 
ceremony, Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow, wrote: "I remember Montreal 
and that house very well and have always had warm feeling for that great 
city. Before Jack and I moved to Montreal, we had just been through some 
very rough treatment in the racially biased South during spring training 
in Florida. In the end, Montreal was the perfect place for him to get his 
start. We never had a threatening or unpleasant experience there. The people 
were so welcoming and saw Jack as a player and as a man."[301] On November 
22, 2014, UCLA announced that it would officially retire the number 42 
across all university sports, effective immediately. While Robinson wore 
several different numbers during his UCLA career, the school chose 42 because 
it had become indelibly identified with him.[302] The only sport this did 
not affect was men's basketball, which had previously retired the number 
for Walt Hazzard (although Kevin Love was actually the last player in that 
sport to wear 42, with Hazzard's blessing).[303][304][305][306] In a move 
paralleling that of MLB when it retired the number, UCLA allowed three 
athletes (in women's soccer, softball, and football) who were already wearing 
42 to continue to do so for the remainder of their UCLA careers. The school 
also announced it would prominently display the number at all of its athletic
