The 1962 Minnesota Twins improved to 91–71, finishing second in the American 
League, five games short of the World Champion New York Yankees. 1,433,116 
fans attended Twins games, the second highest total in the American League. 
Statistically, many members of the Twins had seasons in which they led 
the American League. Harmon Killebrew hit 48 home runs and drove in 126, 
leading the AL in both categories. Bob Allison hit 29 home runs, drove 
in 102 runs, and led the Twins in runs scored with 102. Camilo Pascual 
became the Twins' first 20-game winner and led the AL with 206 strikeouts. 
On July 18, at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota, two Twins 
made major league history by hitting grand slam home runs in the same inning. 
In the first inning -- off Cleveland Indians pitcher Barry Latman -- Bob 
Allison homered to clear the loaded bases. Indians pitcher Jim Perry subsequently 
replaced Latman, and Harmon Killebrew greeted him by driving in Bill Tuttle, 
Vic Power and Rich Rollins. Minnesota scored eleven runs in their half 
of the first inning. Four Twins made the All-Star Game. The selections 
were third baseman Rich Rollins, catcher Earl Battey and pitchers Jim Kaat 
and Camilo Pascual. On August 26, Jack Kralick threw the first no-hitter 
in Minnesota Twins history. The Twins beat the Kansas City Athletics by 
a score of 1–0.[3] First baseman Vic Power won his fifth Gold Glove, catcher 
Earl Battey won his 3rd, and Jim Kaat won his first. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
