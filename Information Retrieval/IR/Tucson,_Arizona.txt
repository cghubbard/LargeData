Tucson (/ˈtuːsɒn/ /tuːˈsɒn/) is a city and the county seat of Pima County, 
Arizona, United States,[5] and home to the University of Arizona. The 2010 
United States Census put the population at 520,116,[2] while the 2015 estimated 
population of the entire Tucson metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was 
980,263.[6] The Tucson MSA forms part of the larger Tucson-Nogales combined 
statistical area (CSA), with a total population of 1,010,025 as of the 
2010 Census. Tucson is the second-largest populated city in Arizona behind 
Phoenix, both of which anchor the Arizona Sun Corridor. The city is [5] 
located 108 miles (174 km) southeast of Phoenix and 60 mi (97 km) north 
of the U.S.–Mexico border. Tucson is the 33rd largest city and the 59th 
largest metropolitan area in the United States. Roughly 150 Tucson companies 
are involved in the design and manufacture of optics and optoelectronics 
systems, earning Tucson the nickname Optics Valley. Major incorporated 
suburbs of Tucson include Oro Valley and Marana northwest of the city, 
Sahuarita[7] south of the city, and South Tucson in an enclave south of 
downtown. Communities in the vicinity of Tucson (some within or overlapping 
the city limits) include Casas Adobes, Catalina Foothills, Flowing Wells, 
Midvale Park, Tanque Verde, Tortolita, and Vail. Towns outside the Tucson 
metro area include Benson to the southeast, Catalina and Oracle to the 
north, and Green Valley to the south. The Spanish name of the city, Tucsón 
[tukˈson], is derived from the O'odham Cuk Ṣon [tʃʊk ʂɔːn], meaning "(at 
the) base of the black [hill]", a reference to a basalt-covered hill now 
known as Sentinel Peak, also known as "A" Mountain.[8] Tucson is sometimes 
referred to as "The Old Pueblo". Tucson was probably first visited by Paleo-Indians, 
known to have been in southern Arizona about 12,000 years ago. Recent archaeological 
excavations near the Santa Cruz River have located a village site dating 
from 2100 BC.[citation needed] The floodplain of the Santa Cruz River was 
extensively farmed during the Early Agricultural Period, circa 1200 BC 
to AD 150. These people constructed irrigation canals and grew corn, beans, 
and other crops while gathering wild plants and hunting. The Early Ceramic 
period occupation of Tucson saw the first extensive use of pottery vessels 
for cooking and storage. The groups designated as the Hohokam lived in 
the area from AD 600 to 1450 and are known for their vast irrigation canal 
systems and their red-on-brown pottery.[citation needed] Jesuit missionary 
Eusebio Francisco Kino visited the Santa Cruz River valley in 1692, and 
founded the Mission San Xavier del Bac in 1700 about 7 mi (11 km) upstream 
from the site of the settlement of Tucson. A separate Convento settlement 
was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what 
is now "A" mountain. Hugo O'Conor, the founding father of the city of Tucson, 
Arizona authorized the construction of a military fort in that location, 
Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón, on August 20, 1775 (near the present downtown 
Pima County Courthouse). During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks 
such as the Second Battle of Tucson were repeatedly mounted by Apaches. 
Eventually the town came to be called "Tucson" and became a part of Sonora 
after Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821. Tucson was captured 
by Philip St. George Cooke with the Mormon Battalion during the Mexican–American 
War, but soon returned to Mexican control as Cooke continued his mission 
westward establishing Cooke's Wagon Road to California. Tucson was not 
included in the Mexican Cession and Cooke's road through Tucson became 
one of the important routes into California during the California Gold 
Rush. Arizona, south of the Gila River, was legally bought from Mexico 
in the Gadsden Purchase on June 8, 1854. Tucson became a part of the United 
States of America, although the American military did not formally take 
over control until March 1856. In 1857 Tucson became a stage station on 
the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line and in 1858 became 3rd division headquarters 
of the Butterfield Overland Mail until the line shut down in March 1861. 
The Overland Mail Corporation attempted to continue running, however following 
the Bascom Affair, devastating Apache attacks on the stations and coaches 
ended operations in August 1861.[citation needed] From August 1861 to mid-1862, 
Tucson was the western capital of the Confederate Arizona Territory, the 
eastern capital being Mesilla. In 1862 the California Column drove the 
Confederate forces out of Arizona. Tucson and all of what is now Arizona 
were part of New Mexico Territory until 1863, when they became part of 
the new Arizona Territory. From 1867 to 1877, Tucson was the capital of 
the Arizona Territory. Tucson was incorporated in 1877, making it the oldest 
incorporated city in Arizona. From 1877 to 1878, the area suffered a rash 
of stagecoach robberies. Most notable, however, were the two holdups committed 
by masked road-agent William Whitney Brazelton.[9] Brazelton held up two 
stages in the summer of 1878 near Point of Mountain Station approximately 
17 mi (27 km) northwest of Tucson. John Clum, of Tombstone, Arizona fame 
was one of the passengers. Brazelton was eventually tracked down and killed 
on Monday August 19, 1878, in a mesquite bosque along the Santa Cruz River 
3 miles (5 km) south of Tucson by Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell 
and his citizen's posse. Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery 
not only in the Tucson area, but also in the Prescott region and Silver 
City, New Mexico area as well. Brazelton's crimes prompted John J. Valentine, 
Sr. of Wells, Fargo & Co. to send special agent and future Pima County 
sheriff Bob Paul to investigate.[9] Fort Lowell, then east of Tucson, was 
established to help protect settlers from Apache attacks. In 1882, Frank 
Stilwell was implicated in the murder of Morgan Earp by Cowboy Pete Spence's 
wife, Marietta, at the coroner's inquest on Morgan Earp's shooting. The 
coroner's jury concluded that Spence, Stilwell, Frederick Bode, and Florentino 
"Indian Charlie" Cruz were the prime suspects in the assassination of Morgan 
Earp.[10] :250 Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp gathered a few trusted friends 
and accompanied Virgil Earp and his family as they traveled to Benson for 
a train ride to California. They found Stilwell lying in wait for Virgil 
in the Tucson station and killed him on the tracks.[11][12] After killing 
Stilwell, Wyatt deputized others and rode on a vendetta, killing three 
more cowboys over the next few days before leaving the state. In 1885, 
the University of Arizona, was founded as a land-grant college on over-grazed 
ranch land between Tucson and Fort Lowell. In 1890, Asians made up 4.2% 
of the city's population.[13] By 1900, 7,531 people lived in the city. 
The population increased gradually to 13,913 in 1910. At about this time, 
the U.S. Veterans Administration had begun construction on the present 
Veterans Hospital. Many veterans who had been gassed in World War I and 
were in need of respiratory therapy began coming to Tucson after the war, 
due to the clean dry air. Over the following years the city continued to 
grow, with the population increasing to 20,292 in 1920 and 36,818 in 1940. 
In 2006 the population of Pima County, in which Tucson is located, passed 
one million while the City of Tucson's population was 535,000. In 1912, 
when Arizona statehood became reality, the total number of different flags 
that had flown over Tucson now numbered five: American, Spanish, Mexican, 
Confederate, and the State of Arizona. [14] During the territorial and 
early statehood periods, Tucson was Arizona's largest city and commercial 
center, while Phoenix was the seat of state government (beginning in 1889) 
and agriculture. The establishment of Tucson Municipal Airport increased 
its prominence. Between 1910 and 1920, Phoenix surpassed Tucson in population, 
and has continued to outpace Tucson in growth. In recent years, both Tucson 
and Phoenix have experienced some of the highest growth rates in the United 
States. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2010, the City 
of Tucson has a land area of 226.71 square miles (587.2 km2). The city's 
elevation is 2,643 ft (806 m) above sea level (as measured at the Tucson 
International Airport).[15] Tucson is situated on an alluvial plain in 
the Sonoran desert, surrounded by five minor ranges of mountains: the Santa 
Catalina Mountains and the Tortolita Mountains to the north, the Santa 
Rita Mountains to the south, the Rincon Mountains to the east, and the 
Tucson Mountains to the west. The high point of the Santa Catalina Mountains 
is 9,157 ft (2,791 m) Mount Lemmon, the southernmost ski destination in 
the continental U.S., while the Tucson Mountains include 4,687 ft (1,429 m) 
Wasson Peak. The highest point in the area is Mount Wrightson, found in 
the Santa Rita Mountains at 9,453 ft (2,881 m) above sea level. Tucson 
is located 118 mi (190 km) southeast of Phoenix and 60 mi (97 km) north 
of the United States - Mexico border. The 2010 United States Census puts 
the city's population at 520,116 with a metropolitan area population at 
980,263. In 2009, Tucson ranked as the 32nd largest city and 52nd largest 
metropolitan area in the United States. A major city in the Arizona Sun 
Corridor, Tucson is the largest city in southern Arizona, the second largest 
in the state after Phoenix. It is also the largest city in the area of 
the Gadsden Purchase. As of 2015, The Greater Tucson Metro area has exceeded 
a population of 1 million. The city is located on the Santa Cruz River, 
formerly a perennial river but now a dry river bed for much of the year 
that floods during significant seasonal rains. Interstate 10, which runs 
southeast to northwest through town, connects Tucson to Phoenix to the 
northwest on the way to its western terminus in Santa Monica, California, 
and to Las Cruces, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas toward its eastern terminus 
in Jacksonville, Florida. I-19 runs south from Tucson toward Nogales and 
the U.S.-Mexico border. I-19 is the only Interstate highway that uses "kilometer 
posts" instead of "mileposts", although the speed limits are marked in 
miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour. Similar to many other cities 
in the Western U.S., Tucson was developed on a grid plan starting in the 
late 19th century, with the city center at Stone Avenue and Broadway Boulevard. 
While this intersection was initially near the geographic center of Tucson, 
that center has shifted as the city has expanded far to the east, development 
to the west being effectively blocked by the Tucson Mountains. An expansive 
city covering substantial area, Tucson has many distinct neighborhoods. 
Tucson's earliest neighborhoods, some of which are now covered by the Tucson 
Convention Center, or TCC, include: Other historical neighborhoods near 
downtown include: At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, downtown 
Tucson underwent a revitalization effort by city planners and the business 
community. The primary project was Rio Nuevo, a large retail and community 
center that has been stalled in planning for more than ten years.[21][22] 
Downtown is generally regarded as the area bordered by 17th Street to the 
south, I-10 to the west, and 6th Street to the north, and Toole Avenue 
and the Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific) railroad tracks, site 
of the historic train depot[23] and "Locomotive #1673", built in 1900. 
Downtown is divided into the Presidio District, the Barrio Viejo, and the 
Congress Street Arts and Entertainment District.[24] Some authorities include 
the 4th Avenue shopping district, which is set just northeast of the rest 
of downtown and connected by an underpass beneath the UPRR tracks. Attractions 
downtown include the Hotel Congress designed in 1919, the Art Deco Fox 
Theatre designed in 1929, the Rialto Theatre opened in 1920, and St. Augustine 
Cathedral completed in 1896.[25] Included on the National Register of Historic 
Places is the old Pima County Courthouse, designed by Roy Place in 1928.[26] 
The El Charro Café, Tucson's oldest restaurant, also operates its main 
location downtown.[27] As one of the oldest parts of town, Central Tucson 
is anchored by the Broadway Village shopping center designed by local architect 
Josias Joesler at the intersection of Broadway Boulevard and Country Club 
Road. The 4th Avenue Shopping District between downtown and the university 
and the Lost Barrio just East of downtown, also have many unique and popular 
stores. Local retail business in Central Tucson is densely concentrated 
along Fourth Avenue and the Main Gate Square on University Boulevard near 
the UA campus. The El Con Mall is also located in the eastern part of midtown. 
The University of Arizona, chartered in 1885, is located in midtown and 
includes Arizona Stadium and McKale Center (named for J.F. "Pop" McKale).[28] 
Historic Tucson High School (designed by Roy Place in 1924) featured in 
the 1987 film Can't Buy Me Love, the Arizona Inn (built in 1930), and the 
Tucson Botanical Gardens are also located in Central Tucson. Tucson's largest 
park, Reid Park, is located in midtown and includes Reid Park Zoo and Hi 
Corbett Field. Speedway Boulevard, a major east-west arterial road in central 
Tucson, was named the "ugliest street in America" by Life magazine in the 
early 1970s, quoting Tucson Mayor James Corbett. Despite this, Speedway 
Boulevard was awarded "Street of the Year" by Arizona Highways in the late 
1990s. According to David Leighton, historical writer for the Arizona Daily 
Star newspaper, Speedway Boulevard derives its name from an old horse racetrack, 
known as "The Harlem River Speedway," more commonly called "The Speedway," 
in New York City. The street was called "The Speedway," from 1904 to about 
1906 before the word "The" was taken out.[29] Central Tucson is bicycle-friendly. 
To the east of the University of Arizona, Third Street is bike-only except 
for local traffic and passes by the historic homes of the Sam Hughes neighborhood. 
To the west, E. University Boulevard leads to the Fourth Avenue Shopping 
District. To the North, N. Mountain Avenue has a full bike-only lane for 
half of the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to the Rillito River Park bike and walk 
multi-use path. To the south, N. Highland Avenue leads to the Barraza-Aviation 
Parkway bicycle path.[30] South Tucson is actually the name of an independent, 
incorporated town of 1 sq mi (2.6 km2), completely surrounded by the city 
of Tucson, sitting just south of downtown. South Tucson has a colorful, 
dynamic history. It was first incorporated in 1936, and later reincorporated 
in 1940. The population consists of about 83% Mexican-American and 10% 
Native American residents. South Tucson is widely known for its many Mexican 
restaurants and the architectural styles which include bright outdoor murals, 
many of which have been painted over due to city policy.[31][32][33] The 
South side of the city of Tucson is generally considered to be the area 
of approximately 25 sq mi (65 km2) north of Los Reales Road,[34] south 
of 22nd Street, east of I-19, west of Davis Monthan Air Force Base and 
southwest of Aviation Parkway. The Tucson International Airport and Tucson 
Electric Park are located here.[citation needed] A combination of urban 
and suburban development, the West Side is generally defined as the area 
west of I-10. Western Tucson encompasses the banks of the Santa Cruz River 
and the foothills of the Tucson Mountains, and includes the International 
Wildlife Museum, Sentinel Peak, and the Marriott Starr Pass Resort & Spa, 
located in the wealthy enclave known as Starr Pass.[35] Moving past the 
Tucson Mountains, travelers find themselves in the area commonly referred 
to as "west of" Tucson or "Old West Tucson".[36] A large undulating plain 
extending south into the Altar Valley, rural residential development predominates, 
but here you will also find major attractions including Saguaro National 
Park West, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, and the Old Tucson Studios 
movie set/theme park. On Sentinel Peak (also known as "'A' Mountain"), 
just west of downtown, there is a giant "A" in honor of the University 
of Arizona. Starting in about 1916, a yearly tradition developed for freshmen 
to whitewash the "A", which was visible for miles. However, at the beginning 
of the Iraq War, anti-war activists painted it black. This was followed 
by a paint scuffle where the "A" was painted various colors until the city 
council intervened. It is now red, white and blue except when it is white 
or another color decided by a biennial election. Because of the three-color 
paint scheme often used, the shape of the A can be vague and indistinguishable 
from the rest of the peak. The top of Sentinel Peak, which is accessible 
by road, offers an outstanding scenic view of the city looking eastward. 
A parking lot located near the summit of Sentinel Peak was formerly a popular 
place to watch sunsets or view the city lights at night. North Tucson includes 
the urban neighborhoods of Amphitheater and Flowing Wells. Usually considered 
the area north of Fort Lowell Road, North Tucson includes some of Tucson's 
primary commercial zones (Tucson Mall and the Oracle Road Corridor). Many 
of the city's most upscale boutiques, restaurants, and art galleries are 
also located on the north side, including St. Philip's Plaza. The Plaza 
is directly adjacent to the historic St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal 
Church (built in 1936). Also on the north side is the suburban community 
of Catalina Foothills, located in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains 
just north of the city limits. This community includes among the area's 
most expensive homes, sometimes multimillion-dollar estates. The Foothills 
area is generally defined as north of River Road, east of Oracle Road, 
and west of Sabino Creek. Some of the Tucson area's major resorts are located 
in the Catalina Foothills, including the Hacienda Del Sol, Westin La Paloma 
Resort, Loews Ventana Canyon Resort and Canyon Ranch Resort. La Encantada, 
an upscale outdoor shopping mall, is also in the Foothills. The DeGrazia 
Gallery of the Sun is located near the intersection of Swan Road and Skyline 
Drive. Built by artist Ted DeGrazia starting in 1951, the 10-acre (40,000 m2) 
property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and features 
an eclectic chapel, an art gallery, and a free museum. The expansive area 
northwest of the city limits is diverse, ranging from the rural communities 
of Catalina and parts of the town of Marana, the small suburb of Picture 
Rocks, the affluent town of Oro Valley in the western foothills of the 
Santa Catalina Mountains, and residential areas in the northeastern foothills 
of the Tucson Mountains. Continental Ranch (Marana), Dove Mountain (Marana), 
and Rancho Vistoso (Oro Valley) are all masterplanned communities located 
in the Northwest, where thousands of residents live. The community of Casas 
Adobes is also on the Northwest Side, with the distinction of being Tucson's 
first suburb, established in the late 1940s. Casas Adobes is centered on 
the historic Casas Adobes Plaza (built in 1948). Casas Adobes is also home 
to Tohono Chul Park (a nature preserve) near the intersection of North 
Oracle Road and West Ina Road. The attempted assassination of Representative 
Gabrielle Giffords, and the murders of chief judge for the U.S. District 
Court for Arizona, John Roll and five other people on January 8, 2011, 
occurred at the La Toscana Village in Casas Adobes. The Foothills Mall 
is also located on the northwest side in Casas Adobes. Many of the Tucson 
area's golf courses and resorts are located in this area, including the 
Hilton El Conquistador Golf & Tennis Resort in Oro Valley, the Omni Tucson 
National Resort & Spa, and Westward Look Resort. The Ritz Carlton at Dove 
Mountain, the second Ritz Carlton Resort in Arizona, which also includes 
a golf course, opened in the foothills of the Tortolita Mountains in northeast 
Marana in 2009. Catalina State Park and Tortolita Mountain Park are also 
located in the Northwest area. East Tucson is relatively new compared to 
other parts of the city, developed between the 1950s and the 1970s,[citation 
needed] with developments such as Desert Palms Park. It is generally classified 
as the area of the city east of Swan Road, with above-average real estate 
values relative to the rest of the city. The area includes urban and suburban 
development near the Rincon Mountains. East Tucson includes Saguaro National 
Park East. Tucson's "Restaurant Row" is also located on the east side, 
along with a significant corporate and financial presence. Restaurant Row 
is sandwiched by three of Tucson's storied Neighborhoods: Harold Bell Wright 
Estates,[37] named after the famous author's ranch which occupied some 
of that area prior to the depression; the Tucson Country Club (the third 
to bear the name Tucson Country Club),[38] and the Dorado Country Club. 
Tucson's largest office building is 5151 East Broadway in east Tucson, 
completed in 1975. The first phases of Williams Centre, a mixed-use, master-planned 
development on Broadway near Craycroft Road,[39] were opened in 1987. Park 
Place, a recently renovated shopping center, is also located along Broadway 
(west of Wilmot Road). Near the intersection of Craycroft and Ft. Lowell 
Roads are the remnants of the Historic Fort Lowell. This area has become 
one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In 1891, the Fort was abandoned and 
much of the interior was stripped of their useful components and it quickly 
fell into ruin. In 1900, three of the officer buildings were purchased 
for use as a sanitarium. The sanitarium was then sold to Harvey Adkins 
in 1928. The Bolsius family Pete, Nan and Charles Bolsius purchased and 
renovated surviving adobe buildings of the Fort – transforming them into 
spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples. Their woodwork, 
plaster treatment and sense of proportion drew on their Dutch heritage 
and New Mexican experience. Other artists and academics throughout the 
middle of the 20th century, including: Win Ellis, Jack Maul, Madame Cheruy, 
Giorgio Belloli, Charels Bode, Veronica Hughart, Edward and Rosamond Spicer, 
Hazel Larson Archer and Ruth Brown, renovated adobes, built homes and lived 
in the area. The artist colony attracted writers and poets including beat 
generation Alan Harrington and Jack Kerouac whose visit is documented in 
his iconic book On the Road. This rural pocket in the middle of the city 
is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Each year in February 
the neighborhood celebrates its history in the City Landmark it owns and 
restored the San Pedro Chapel. Situated between the Santa Catalina Mountains 
and the Rincon Mountains near Redington Pass northeast of the city limits 
is the affluent community of Tanque Verde. The Arizona National Golf Club, 
Forty-Niners Country Club, and the historic Tanque Verde Guest Ranch are 
also in northeast Tucson. Southeast Tucson continues to experience rapid 
residential development. The area includes Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. 
The area is considered to be south of Golf Links Road. It is the home of 
Santa Rita High School, Chuck Ford Park (Lakeside Park), Lakeside Lake, 
Lincoln Park (upper and lower), The Lakecrest Neighborhoods, and Pima Community 
College East Campus. The Atterbury Wash with its access to excellent bird 
watching is also located in the Southeast Tucson area. The suburban community 
of Rita Ranch houses many of the military families from Davis-Monthan, 
and is near the southeastern-most expansion of the current city limits. 
Close by Rita Ranch and also within the city limits lies Civano, a planned 
development meant to showcase ecologically sound building practices and 
lifestyles. Mount Lemmon, the highest peak of the Santa Catalina Mountains, 
reaches an elevation of 9,157 feet (2,791 m) above sea level. The mountain 
is named after 19th century botanist Sara Lemmon. She was the first documented 
European woman to ascend to the peak, accompanied by her husband and by 
local rancher Emmerson Oliver Stratton.[40][41][42] The Lemmons botanized 
extensively along the way, including collecting the plant Tagetes lemmonii 
which is now called the Mount Lemmon marigold. Catalina Highway stretches 
25 miles (40 km) and the entire mountain range is one of Tucson's most 
popular vacation spots for cycling, hiking, rock climbing, camping, birding, 
and wintertime snowboarding and skiing. Near the top of Mt. Lemmon is the 
town of Summerhaven. In Summerhaven, visitors will find log houses and 
cabins, a general store, and various shops, as well as numerous hiking 
trails. Near Summerhaven is the road to Ski Valley which hosts a ski lift, 
several runs, a giftshop, and nearby restaurant. Mt. Lemmon Sky Center, 
which is located at a Steward Observatory site known as 'Sky Island', sits 
9,152 feet (2,790 m) in altitude on the summit of Mt. Lemmon. As one of 
the Southwestern United States's 27 unique Sky Islands,[43] this science 
learning facility is open to the public.[44] Tucson has hot summers and 
temperate winters. Tucson is almost always cooler and wetter than Phoenix 
because of its higher elevation. Tucson has a desert climate (Köppen BWh), 
with two major seasons, summer and winter; plus three minor seasons: fall, 
spring, and the North American Monsoon. Tucson averages 11.8 inches (299.7 mm) 
of precipitation per year, more than most other locations with desert climates, 
but it still qualifies as desert due to its high evapotranspiration; in 
other words, it experiences a high net loss of water.[45] A similar scenario 
is seen in Alice Springs, Australia, which averages 11 inches (279.4 mm) 
a year, but has a desert climate. The most obvious difference of climate 
from most other inhabited regions is the hot and sunny climate. This difference 
is a major contributing factor to a rate of skin cancer that is at least 
three times higher than in more northerly regions.[46] The media reports 
heat-related deaths increasing among illegal immigrants in and around Tucson. 
Heatstroke-related deaths have been recorded since 1999 in the Pima County 
Area.[47] Summer is characterized by daytime temperatures that exceed 100 °F 
(38 °C) and overnight temperatures between 66 and 85 °F (19 and 29 °C). 
Early summer is characterized by low humidity and clear skies; mid-summer 
and late summer are characterized by higher humidity, cloudy skies and 
frequent rain. The monsoon can begin any time from mid-June to late July, 
with an average start date around July 3. It typically continues through 
August and sometimes into September.[48] During the monsoon, the humidity 
is much higher than the rest of the year. It begins with clouds building 
up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms 
and rainfall, which can cause flash floods. The evening sky at this time 
of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of 
the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, 
usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have 
"feet of water" scales painted on their supports to discourage fording 
by automobiles during a rainstorm.[49] Arizona traffic code Title 28-910, 
the so-called "Stupid Motorist Law", was instituted in 1995 to discourage 
people from entering flooded roadways. If the road is flooded and a barricade 
is in place, motorists who drive around the barricade can be charged up 
to $2000 for costs involved in rescuing them.[50] Despite all warnings 
and precautions, however, three Tucson drivers have drowned between 2004 
and 2010. The weather in the fall is much like that during spring: dry, 
with cool nights and warm, hot days. Temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C) 
are possible into early October. Temperatures decline at the quickest rate 
in October and November, and are normally the coolest in late December 
and early January. Winters in Tucson are mild relative to other parts of 
the United States. Daytime highs in the winter range between 64 and 75 °F 
(18 and 24 °C), with overnight lows between 30 and 44 °F (−1 and 7 °C). 
Tucson typically averages one hard freeze per winter season, with temperatures 
dipping to the mid or low-20s (−7 to −4 °C), but this is typically limited 
to only a very few nights. Although rare, snow has been known to fall in 
Tucson, usually a light dusting that melts within a day. The most recent 
snowfall was on February 20, 2013 when 2.0 inches of snow blanketed the 
city, the largest snowfall since 1987. Early spring is characterized by 
gradually rising temperatures and several weeks of vivid wildflower blooms 
beginning in late February and into March. During this time of year the 
diurnal temperature variation normally attains its maximum, often surpassing 
30 °F (17 °C). At the University of Arizona, where records have been kept 
since 1894, the record maximum temperature was 115 °F (46 °C) on June 19, 
1960, and July 28, 1995, and the record minimum temperature was 6 °F (−14 °C) 
on January 7, 1913. There are an average of 150.1 days annually with highs 
of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher and an average of 26.4 days with lows reaching 
or below the freezing mark. Average annual precipitation is 11.15 in (283 mm). 
There is an average of 49 days with measurable precipitation. The wettest 
year was 1905 with 24.17 in (614 mm) and the driest year was 1924 with 
5.07 in (129 mm). The most precipitation in one month was 7.56 in (192 mm) 
in July 1984. The most precipitation in 24 hours was 4.16 in (106 mm) on 
October 1, 1983. Annual snowfall averages 0.7 in (1.8 cm). The most snow 
in one year was 7.2 in (18 cm) in 1987. The most snow in one month was 
6.0 in (15 cm) in January 1898 and March 1922.[51] At the airport, where 
records have been kept since 1930, the record maximum temperature was 117 °F 
(47 °C) on June 26, 1990, and the record minimum temperature was 16 °F 
(−9 °C) on January 4, 1949. There is an average of 145.0 days annually 
with highs of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher and an average of 16.9 days with 
lows reaching or below the freezing mark. Measurable precipitation falls 
on an average of 53 days. The wettest year was 1983 with 21.86 in (555 mm) 
of precipitation, and the driest year was 1953 with 5.34 in (136 mm). The 
most rainfall in one month was 7.93 in (201 mm) in August 1955. The most 
rainfall in 24 hours was 3.93 in (100 mm) on July 29, 1958. Snow at the 
airport averages only 1.1 in (2.8 cm) annually. The most snow received 
in one year was 8.3 in (21 cm) and the most snow in one month was 6.8 in 
(17 cm) in December 1971.[52] According to the 2010 American Census Bureau, 
the racial composition of Tucson was as follows: As of the census of 2010, 
there were 520,116 people, 229,762 households, and 112,455 families residing 
in the city. The population density was 2,500.1 inhabitants per square 
mile (965.3/km²). There were 209,609 housing units at an average density 
of 1,076.7 per square mile (415.7/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 
69.7% White (down from 94.8% in 1970[60]), 5.0% Black or African-American, 
2.7% Native American, 2.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 16.9% from other 
races, and 3.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race 
were 41.6% of the population.[61] Non-Hispanic Whites were 47.2% of the 
population in 2010,[61] down from 72.8% in 1970.[60] There were 192,891 
households out of which 29.0% had children under the age of 18 living with 
them, 39.7% were married couples living together, 13.8% had a female householder 
with no husband present, and 41.7% were non-families. 32.3% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 9.3% had someone living alone who was 65 
years of age or older. The average household size was 2.42 and the average 
family size was 3.12. In the inner-city, the population has 24.6% under 
the age of 18, 13.8% from 18 to 24, 30.5% from 25 to 44, 19.2% from 45 
to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 
32 years. For every 100 females there were 96.0 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 93.3 males. The median income for a household 
in the city was $30,981, and the median income for a family was $37,344. 
Males had a median income of $28,548 versus $23,086 for females. The per 
capita income for the city was $16,322. About 13.7% of families and 18.4% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 23.6% of those 
under age 18 and 11.0% of those age 65 or over.[62] Much of Tucson's economic 
development has been centered on the development of the University of Arizona, 
which is currently the second largest employer in the city. Davis-Monthan 
Air Force Base, located on the southeastern edge of the city, also provides 
many jobs for Tucson residents. Its presence, as well as the presence of 
the US Army Intelligence Center (Fort Huachuca, the largest employer in 
the region in nearby Sierra Vista), has led to the development of a significant 
number of high-tech industries, including government contractors, in the 
area. The city of Tucson is also a major hub for the Union Pacific Railroad's 
Sunset Route that links the Los Angeles ports with the South/Southeast 
regions of the country. The City of Tucson, Pima County, the State of Arizona, 
and the private sector have all made commitments to create a growing, healthy 
economy[citation needed] with advanced technology industry sectors as its 
foundation. Raytheon Missile Systems (formerly Hughes Aircraft Co.),[63] 
Texas Instruments, IBM, Intuit Inc., Universal Avionics, Honeywell Aerospace, 
Sunquest Information Systems, Sanofi-Aventis, Ventana Medical Systems, 
Inc., and Bombardier Aerospace all have a significant presence in Tucson. 
Roughly 150 Tucson companies are involved in the design and manufacture 
of optics and optoelectronics systems, earning Tucson the nickname "Optics 
Valley".[64] Tourism is another major industry in Tucson, bringing in $2 
billion per year and over 3.5 million visitors annually due to Tucson's 
numerous resorts, hotels, and attractions.[65] One of the major annual 
attractions is the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show, and its associated shows, 
all held generally in the first two weeks of February. These associated 
shows (such as gems, jewelry, beads, fossils) are held throughout the city, 
with 43 different shows in 2010. This makes Tucson's the largest such exposition 
in the world. In addition to vacationers, a significant number of winter 
residents, or "snowbirds", are attracted by Tucson's mild winters and contribute 
to the local economy. Snowbirds often purchase second homes in Tucson and 
nearby areas, contributing significantly to the property tax base. There 
are also a number of middle-class and upper-class Sonorans and Sinaloans 
who travel from Mexico to Tucson to purchase goods that are not readily 
available in Mexico.[citation needed] Nonprofits based in Tucson include 
the Muscular Dystrophy Association. According to Tucson's 2013 Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report,[66] the top employers in the city are: The Tucson 
Gem & Mineral Show is one of the largest gem and mineral shows in the world 
and has been held for over 50 years. The Show is only one part of the gem, 
mineral, fossil, and bead gathering held all around Tucson in over 45 different 
sites.[67] The various shows run from late-January to mid-February with 
the official Show lasting two weeks in February. Since 2009, the Tucson 
Festival of Books has been held annually over a two-day period in March 
at the University of Arizona. By 2010 it had become the fourth largest 
book festival in the United States, with 450 authors and 80,000 attendees.[68] 
In addition to readings and lectures, it features a science fair, varied 
entertainment, food, and exhibitors ranging from local retailers and publishers 
to regional and national nonprofit organizations.[69] In 2011, the Festival 
began presenting a Founder's Award; recipients include Elmore Leonard and 
R.L. Stine.[70] For the past 25 years, the Tucson Folk Festival has taken 
place the first Saturday and Sunday of May in downtown Tucson's El Presidio 
Park. In addition to nationally known headline acts each evening, the Festival 
highlights over 100 local and regional musicians on five stages is one 
of the largest free festivals in the country. All stages are within easy 
walking distance. Organized by the Tucson Kitchen Musicians Association,[71] 
volunteers make this festival possible. KXCI 91.3-FM, Arizona's only community 
radio station, is a major partner, broadcasting from the Plaza Stage throughout 
the weekend. In addition, there are numerous workshops, events for children, 
sing-alongs, and a popular singer/songwriter contest. Musicians typically 
play 30-minute sets, supported by professional audio staff volunteers. 
A variety of food and crafts are available at the festival, as well as 
local micro-brews. All proceeds from sales go to fund future festivals. 
There are two Fourth Avenue Street Fairs, in December and late March/early 
April, staged between 9th Street and University Boulevard, that feature 
arts and crafts booths, food vendors and street performers. The fairs began 
in 1970 when Fourth Avenue, which at the time had half a dozen thrift shops, 
several New Age bookshops and the Food Conspiracy Co-Op, was a gathering 
place for hippies, and a few merchants put tables in front of their stores 
to attract customers before the holidays. These days, the street fair has 
grown into a large corporate event, with most tables owned by outside merchants. 
It hosts mostly traveling craftsmen selling various arts such as pottery, 
paintings, wood working, metal decorations, candles, and many others. Another 
popular event held in February, which is early spring in Tucson, is the 
Fiesta de los Vaqueros, or rodeo week, founded by winter visitor, Leighton 
Kramer.[72] While at its heart the Fiesta is a sporting event, it includes 
what is billed as "the world's largest non-mechanized parade".[73] The 
Rodeo Parade is a popular event as most schools give two rodeo days off 
instead of Presidents Day. The exception to this is Presidio High (a non-public 
charter school), which doesn't get either. Western wear is seen throughout 
the city as corporate dress codes are cast aside during the Fiesta. The 
Fiesta de los Vaqueros marks the beginning of the rodeo season in the United 
States. Every October for the past 30 years, Tucson Meet Yourself[74] has 
presented the faces of Tucson's many ethnic groups. For one weekend, dancing, 
singing, artwork, and food from more than 30 different ethnicities are 
featured in the downtown area. All performers are from Tucson and the surrounding 
area, in keeping with the idea of "meeting yourself." Since 2012, during 
the first two weekends of October, the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation 
hosts Tucson Modernism Week,[75] celebrating tucson's unique Post WWII, 
Mid-century modern Heritage. The event includes more than 30 programs including 
tours, lectures, exhibits, films and parties. The events are located in 
mid-century modern buildings and neighborhoods throughout the city and 
has highlighted the work of significant architects and designers who contributed 
to the development and history of southern Arizona including: Architect 
Arthur Brown, Fashion Designer Dolores Gonzales, Architect Bob Swaim, Architect 
Anne Rysdale, Textile Designers Harwood and Sophie Steiger, Architect Nick 
Sakellar, Architectural Designer Tom Gist, Furniture Designer Max Gottschalk, 
Architect, Ned Nelson, Landscape Architect Guy Green, Architect Juan Worner 
Baz and many others. The All Souls Procession, held in early November, 
is one of the largest festivals in Tucson. Modeled on the Mexican holiday 
Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), it combines aspects of many different 
cultural traditions.[76] The first All Souls Procession was organized by 
local artist Susan Kay Johnson in 1990 and involved 35 participants; by 
2013, participation was estimated at 50,000.[77][78] The Procession, held 
at sundown, consists of a non-motorized parade through downtown Tucson 
featuring many floats, sculptures, and memorials, in which the community 
is encouraged to participate. The parade is followed by performances on 
an outdoor stage, culminating in the burning of an urn in which written 
prayers have been collected from participants and spectators.[78][79] The 
event is organized and funded by the non-profit arts organization Many 
Mouths One Stomach, with the assistance of many volunteers and donations 
from the public and local businesses.[78] Cultural and other attractions 
include: Shops in Summerhaven on Mount Lemmon offer such items as jewelry 
and other gifts, pizza, and fresh-fruit pies. The legacy of the Aspen Fire 
can be seen in charred trees, rebuilt homes, and melted beads incorporated 
into a sidewalk. Fourth Avenue, located near the University of Arizona, 
is home to many shops, restaurants, and bars, and hosts the annual 4th 
Avenue Street Fair every December and March. University Boulevard, leading 
directly to the UA Main Gate, is also the center of numerous bars, retail 
shops, and restaurants most commonly frequented by the large student population 
of the UA. El Tiradito is a religious shrine in the downtown area. The 
Shrine dates back to the early days of Tucson. It is based on a love story 
of revenge and murder. People stop by the Shrine to light a candle for 
someone in need, a place for people to go give hope. The Biosphere 2 is 
a 3.14-acre educational facility, designed to mimic a tropical or sub-tropical 
climate-controlled environment.[83] The accomplished and awarded writers 
(poets, novelists, dramatists, nonfiction writers) who have lived in Tucson 
include Edward Abbey, Erskine Caldwell, Barbara Kingsolver and David Foster 
Wallace. Some were associated with the University of Arizona, but many 
were independent writers who chose to make Tucson their home. The city 
is particularly active in publishing and presenting contemporary innovative 
poetry in various ways. Examples are the Chax Press, a publisher of poetry 
books in trade and book arts editions, and the University of Arizona Poetry 
Center, which has a sizable poetry library and presents readings, conferences, 
and workshops. Theater groups include the Arizona Theatre Company, which 
performs in the Temple of Music and Art, and Arizona Onstage Productions, 
a not-for-profit theater company devoted to musical theater. Broadway in 
Tucson presents the touring reproductions of many Broadway-style events. 
The Gaslight Theater produces musical melodrama parodies in the old Jerry 
Lewis Theater and has been in Tucson since 1977.[84] Musical organizations 
include the Tucson Symphony Orchestra (founded in 1929) and Arizona Opera 
(founded as the Tucson Opera Company in 1971). Tucson is considered an 
influential center for Mariachi music and is home to a large number of 
Mariachi musicians and singers.[85] The Tucson International Mariachi Conference, 
hosted annually since 1982, involves several hundred mariachi bands and 
folklorica dance troops during a three-day festival in April.[86] The Norteño 
Festival and Street Fair in the enclave city of South Tucson is held annually 
at the end of summer. Prominent musical artists based in Tucson have included 
Linda Ronstadt, The Dusty Chaps, Howe Gelb, Bob Log III, Calexico, Giant 
Sand, Hipster Daddy-O and the Handgrenades, The Bled and Tucson's official 
troubadour Ted Ramirez. The Tucson Area Music Awards, or TAMMIES, are an 
annual event.[87] Tucson is well known for its Sonoran-style Mexican food.[88] 
But since the turn of the century, ethnic restaurants and fine dining choices 
have proliferated.[89][90] In 2015 the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated Tucson a "world city of gastronomy".[91][92] 
The Sonoran hot dog is very popular in Tucson. This is a hot dog wrapped 
in bacon and grilled, served on a bolillo-style hot dog bun, and topped 
with pinto beans, onions, tomatoes, and a variety of additional condiments, 
often including mayonnaise, mustard, and jalapeño salsa.[93][94][95] Tucson 
is commonly known as "The Old Pueblo". While the exact origin of this nickname 
is uncertain, it is commonly traced back to Mayor R. N. "Bob" Leatherwood. 
When rail service was established to the city on March 20, 1880, Leatherwood 
celebrated the fact by sending telegrams to various leaders, including 
the President of the United States and the Pope, announcing that the "ancient 
and honorable pueblo" of Tucson was now connected by rail to the outside 
world. The term became popular with newspaper writers who often abbreviated 
it as "A. and H. Pueblo". This in turn transformed into the current form 
of "The Old Pueblo".[96] In the early 1980s, city leaders ran a contest 
searching for a new nickname. The winning entry was the "Sunshine Factory".[97] 
The new nickname never gained popular acceptance, allowing the old name 
to remain in common use.[98] Tucson was dubbed "Optics Valley" in 1992 
when Business Week ran a cover story on the Arizona Optics Industry Association.[99] 
The University of Arizona Wildcats sports teams, most notably the men's 
basketball and women's softball teams have strong local interest. The men's 
basketball team, formerly coached by Hall of Fame head coach Lute Olson 
and currently coached by Sean Miller, has made 25 straight NCAA Tournaments 
and won the 1997 National Championship. Arizona's Softball team has reached 
the NCAA National Championship game 12 times and has won 8 times, most 
recently in 2007. The men's baseball team has won NCAA National Championships 
in 1976, 1980, 1986 and 2012. The university's swim teams have gained international 
recognition, with swimmers coming from as far as Japan and Africa to train 
with the coach Frank Busch who has also worked with the U.S. Olympic swim 
team for a number of years. Both men's and women's swim teams won the 2008 
NCAA National Championships.[100] The Tucson Padres played at Kino Veterans 
Memorial Stadium from 2011 to 2013. They served as the AAA affiliate of 
the San Diego Padres. The team, formerly known as the Portland Beavers, 
was temporarily relocated to Tucson from Portland while awaiting the building 
of a new stadium in Escondido.[101][102] Legal issues derailed the plans 
to build the Escondido stadium, so they moved to El Paso, Texas for the 
2014 season. Previously, the Tucson Sidewinders, a triple-A affiliate of 
the Arizona Diamondbacks, won the Pacific Coast League championship and 
unofficial AAA championship in 2006. The Sidewinders played in Tucson Electric 
Park and were in the Pacific Conference South of the PCL. The Sidewinders 
were sold in 2007 and moved to Reno, Nevada after the 2008 season. They 
now compete as the Reno Aces. The Portland Pirates of the American Hockey 
League relocated to Tucson following the 2015-2016 season to become the 
Tucson Roadrunners. They play in the AHL's Pacific division, and are affiliated 
with the Arizona Coyotes. Tucson is also host to the Desert Diamond Cup, 
the largest pre-season Major League Soccer (MLS) tournament in the country. 
As many as 10 MLS soccer clubs train in Tucson every winter. Tucson is 
also host to FC Tucson, an amateur-level soccer club. The United States 
Handball Association Hall of Fame is located in Tucson.[103] The Tucson 
Monsoon, a full-contact women's football team, is a member of the Independent 
Women's Football League where they have played since their inception in 
2006.[104] In 2009, the Arizona She-Devils also played women's football 
in Tucson as an expansion team of the Women's Football Alliance.[105] Tracks 
include Tucson Raceway Park and Rillito Downs. Tucson Raceway Park hosts 
NASCAR-sanctioned auto racing events and is one of only two asphalt short 
tracks in Arizona. Rillito Downs is an in-town destination on weekends 
in January and February each year. This historic track held the first organized 
quarter horse races in the world, and they are still racing there. The 
racetrack is threatened by development. The Moltacqua racetrack, was another 
historic horse racetrack located on what is now Sabino Canyon Road and 
Vactor Ranch Trail, but it no longer exists.[106] The city has more than 
120 parks, including Reid Park Zoo. There are five public golf courses 
located in Tucson. Several scenic parks and points of interest are also 
located nearby, including the Tucson Botanical Gardens, Tohono Chul Park, 
Saguaro National Park, Sabino Canyon, and Biosphere 2 (just north of the 
city, in the town of Oracle). Mt. Lemmon, 25 miles (40 km) north (by road) 
and over 6,700 feet (2,000 m) above Tucson, is located in the Coronado 
National Forest. Outdoor activities in the summer include hiking, birding, 
rock climbing, picnicking, camping, sky rides at Ski Valley, fishing and 
touring. In the winter, skiing and/or sledding is sometimes available at 
the southernmost ski resort in the continental United States. Summerhaven, 
a community near the top of Mt. Lemmon, is also a popular destination. 
The League of American Bicyclists gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle 
friendliness in late April 2007. Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling 
event in the United States. The ride called "El Tour de Tucson" happens 
in November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving. El Tour de Tucson produced 
and promoted by Perimeter Bicycling has as many as 10,000 participants 
from all over the world, annually. Tucson is one of only nine cities in 
the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from 
the League of American Bicyclists. The city is known for its winter cycling 
opportunities. Both road and mountain biking are popular in and around 
Tucson with trail areas including Starr Pass and Fantasy Island. Pima County 
supported John Kerry 53% to 47% in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election,[107] 
and Barack Obama 54% to 46% in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election.[108] 
In the latter year, Pima was the only county to vote against Arizona's 
gay marriage ban.[109] In general, Tucson and Pima County support the Democratic 
Party, as opposed the state's largest metropolitan area, Phoenix, which 
usually supports the Republican Party. Congressional redistricting in 2013, 
following the publication of the 2010 Census, divided the Tucson area into 
three Federal Congressional districts (the first, second and third of Arizona). 
The city center is in the 3rd District, represented by Raul Grijalva, a 
Democrat, since 2003, while the more affluent residential areas to the 
south and east are in the 2nd District, represented by Republican Martha 
McSally since 2015, and the exurbs north and west between Tucson and Phoenix 
in the 3rd District are represented by Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick since 2008.[110] 
The United States Postal Service operates post offices in Tucson. The Tucson 
Main Post Office is located at 1501 South Cherrybell Stravenue.[111] Tucson 
follows the "weak mayor" model of the council-manager form of local government. 
The 6-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares 
executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently 
of the council. An appointed city manager is responsible for the day-to-day 
operations of the city. Both the council members and the mayor serve four-year 
terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards 
via a ward-level primary held in September. The top vote-earners from each 
party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. 
In other words, on election day the whole city votes on all the council 
races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 
4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 
2011), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2013). 
Tucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial publicly financed 
campaigns. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible 
to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council 
candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral 
candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33¢ 
for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding 
figures for mayor are 64¢ per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In 
return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio 
of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that 
candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. 
Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this 
system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas. Mayor 
Jonathan Rothschild (D) was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding 
Robert E. Walkup (R), who took office in 1999.[112] Walkup was preceded 
by George Miller (D), 1991–1999; Tom Volgy (D), 1987–1991; Lew Murphy (R), 
1971–1987; and Jim Corbett (D), 1967–1971. Primarily, students of the Tucson 
area attend public schools in the Tucson Unified School District (TUSD). 
TUSD has the second highest enrollment of any school district in Arizona, 
behind Mesa Unified School District in the Phoenix metropolitan area. There 
are also many publicly funded charter schools with a specialized curriculum.[117] 
In 1956, Tucson High School had the largest enrollment of any secondary 
school in the United States, with a total of more than 6,800 students.[118] 
The facility operated on a two-shift basis while construction went on for 
two other high schools that opened within a year to educate children in 
the rapidly booming Tucson population. Tucson has one daily newspaper, 
the morning Arizona Daily Star. Wick Communications publishes the daily 
legal paper The Daily Territorial, while Boulder, Colo.-based 10/13 Communications 
publishes Tucson Weekly (an "alternative" publication), Inside Tucson Business 
and the Explorer. TucsonSentinel.com is a nonprofit independent online 
news organization. Tucson Lifestyle Magazine, Lovin' Life News, DesertLeaf, 
and Zócalo Magazine are monthly publications covering arts, architecture, 
decor, fashion, entertainment, business, history, and other events. The 
Arizona Daily Wildcat is the University of Arizona's student newspaper, 
and the Aztec News is the Pima Community College student newspaper. The 
New Vision is the newspaper for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson, and 
the Arizona Jewish Post is the newspaper of the Jewish Federation of Southern 
Arizona. The Tucson metro area is served by many local television stations 
and is the 68th largest designated market area (DMA) in the U.S. with 433,310 
homes (0.39% of the total U.S.). It is limited to the three counties of 
southeastern Arizona (Pima, Santa Cruz, and Cochise)[119] The major television 
networks serving Tucson are: KVOA 4 (NBC), KGUN 9 (ABC), KMSB-TV 11 (Fox), 
KOLD-TV 13 (CBS), KTTU 18 (My Network TV) and KWBA 58 (The CW). KUAT-TV 
6 is a PBS affiliate run by the University of Arizona (as is sister station 
KUAS 27). Tucson's primary electrical power source is a coal and natural 
gas power-plant managed by Tucson Electric Power that is situated within 
the city limits on the south-western boundary of Davis-Monthan Air-force 
base adjacent to Interstate-10. The air pollution generated has raised 
some concerns as the Sundt operating station has been online since 1962 
and is exempt from many pollution standards and controls due to its age.[120] 
Solar has been gaining ground in Tucson with its ideal over 300 days of 
sunshine climate. Federal, state, and even local utility credits and incentives 
have also enticed residents to equip homes with solar systems. Davis-Monthan 
AFB has a 3.3 Megawatt (MW) ground-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) array 
and a 2.7 MW rooftop-mounted PV array, both of which are located in the 
Base Housing area. The base will soon have the largest solar-generating 
capacity in the United States Department of Defense after awarding a contract 
on September 10, 2010, to SunEdison to construct a 14.5 MW PV field on 
the northwestern side of the base.[121] Global Solar Energy, which is located 
at the University of Arizona's science and technology park, is one of the 
planet's largest CIGS solar fields at 750 kilowatts.[122][123][124] Perhaps 
the biggest sustainability problem in Tucson, with its high desert climate, 
is potable water supply. The state manages all water in Arizona through 
its Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR). The primary consumer 
of water is Agriculture (including golf courses), which consumes about 
69% of all water. Municipal (which includes residential use) accounts for 
about 25% of use.[125] Energy consumption and availability is another sustainability 
issue. However, with over 300 days of full sun a year, Tucson has demonstrated 
its potential to be an ideal solar energy producer. Tucson and Pima County 
adopted Dark Sky ordinances to control light pollution in support of the 
region's astronomical observatories in 1972.[126] Last amended in 2012,[127] 
the City of Tucson/Pima County Outdoor Lighting Code establishes maximum 
illumination levels, shielding requirements, and limits on signage in "continuing 
support of astronomical activity and minimizing wasted energy, while not 
compromising the safety, security, and well-being of persons engaged in 
outdoor nighttime activities."[128] Less than 100 years ago, the Santa 
Cruz River flowed nearly year-round through Tucson. This supply of water 
has slowly disappeared, causing Tucson to seek alternative sources. In 
1881, water was pumped from a well on the banks of the Santa Cruz River 
and flowed by gravity through pipes into the distribution system.[129] 
Tucson currently draws water from two main sources: Central Arizona Project 
(CAP) water and groundwater. In 1992, Tucson Water delivered CAP water 
to some customers that was referred to as being unacceptable due to discoloration, 
bad odor and flavor, as well as problems it caused some customers' plumbing 
and appliances. Tucson's city water currently consists of CAP water mixed 
with groundwater. In an effort to conserve water, Tucson is recharging 
groundwater supplies by running part of its share of CAP water into various 
open portions of local rivers to seep into their aquifer.[130] Additional 
study is scheduled to determine the amount of water that is lost through 
evaporation from the open areas, especially during the summer. The City 
of Tucson already provides reclaimed water to its inhabitants, but it is 
only used for "applications such as irrigation, dust control, and industrial 
uses."[131] These resources have been in place for more than 27 years, 
and deliver to over 900 locations.[132] To prevent further loss of groundwater, 
Tucson has been involved in water conservation and groundwater preservation 
efforts, shifting away from its reliance on a series of Tucson area wells 
in favor of conservation, consumption-based pricing for residential and 
commercial water use, and new wells in the more sustainable Avra Valley 
aquifer, northwest of the city. An allocation from the Central Arizona 
Project Aqueduct (CAP), which passes more than 300 mi (480 km) across the 
desert from the Colorado River, has been incorporated into the city's water 
supply, annually providing over 20 million gallons of "recharged" water 
which is pumped into the ground to replenish water pumped out.[133] Since 
2001, CAP water has allowed the city to remove or turn off over 80 wells.[134] 
Tucson's Sun Tran bus system serves greater Tucson with standard, express, 
regional shuttle, and on-demand shuttle bus service. It was awarded Best 
Transit System in 1988 and 2005.[135] A 3.9-mile streetcar line, Sun Link, 
connects the University of Arizona campus with 4th Avenue, downtown, and 
the Mercado District west of Interstate 10 and the Santa Cruz River. Ten-minute 
headway passenger service began July 25, 2014.[136] The streetcar utilizes 
Sun Tran's card payment and transfer system, connecting with the University 
of Arizona's CatTran shuttles, Amtrak, and Greyhound intercity bus service. 
Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Tucson 
three times weekly in both directions, operating its Sunset Limited between 
Los Angeles, California and New Orleans, Louisiana and Texas Eagle service 
between Los Angeles and Chicago, Illinois. Tucson International Airport 
(IATA: TUS, ICAO: KTUS), is located 6 mi (9.7 km) south of the city's center. 
TIA is the second largest commercial airport in Arizona, providing nonstop 
flights to 15 destinations throughout the United States.[137] In addition 
to passenger and freight service, TIA supports the 162d Fighter Wing's 
fleet of seventy F-16s stationed at the Tucson Air National Guard Base.[138] 
There are two interstate highways in the metropolitan area. Interstate 
10 runs southeast from Phoenix through Marana, passes west of downtown, 
and continues east toward El Paso. Interstate 19 leaves the I-10 south 
of downtown and heads south to the Mexican border. State Highway 210 is 
a shorter freeway that links downtown with Davis-Monthan Air Force Base 
and Tucson's southeast side. Tucson does not have a beltway system. Cycling 
is popular in Tucson due to its flat terrain and dry climate. Tucson and 
Pima County maintain an extensive network of marked bike routes, signal 
crossings, on-street bike lanes, mountain-biking trails, and dedicated 
shared-use paths. The Loop is a network of seven linear parks comprising 
over 100 mi (160 km) of paved, vehicle-free trails that encircles the majority 
of the city with links to Marana and Oro Valley.[139][140] The Tucson-Pima 
County Bicycle Advisory Committee (TPCBAC) serves in an advisory capacity 
to local governments on issues relating to bicycle recreation, transportation, 
and safety. Tucson was awarded a gold rating for bicycle-friendliness by 
the League of American Bicyclists in 2006.[141] Tucson has eight sister
