Edward Jack Roebuck (born July 3, 1931 in East Millsboro, Fayette County, 
Pennsylvania, USA) is a former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. 
He pitched in 11 seasons (1955–58; 1960–66) with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Washington Senators and Philadelphia Phillies. A right-hander, 
he appeared in the World Series with the Dodgers in 1955 and 1956. Roebuck 
had a very high winning percentage as a pitcher, compiling a mark of 52 
wins and 31 defeats (.615) during his career, with seasons of 8–2 (1957), 
8–3 (1960) and 10–2 (1962) for the Dodgers. In 1962, he was the Dodgers' 
most successful bullpen ace, helping them to a first-place tie with their 
archrival, the San Francisco Giants, after the full slate of 162 games. 
But Los Angeles dropped the league playoffs, two games to one. Roebuck 
was also known as one of the game's finest fungo hitters, who endeavored 
to hit fungo home runs from home plate in every MLB stadium.[1] After his 
playing career ended, Roebuck was a scout for a number of teams, including 
the Dodgers, Phillies, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates
