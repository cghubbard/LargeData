The 1961 Boston Red Sox season involved the Red Sox finishing sixth in 
the American League with a record of 76 wins and 86 losses, 33 games behind 
the AL and World Series Champion New York Yankees. Future Hall of Famer 
Carl Yastrzemski made his major league debut on Opening Day, April 11. 
He was considered the heir apparent to Ted Williams,[1] who had retired 
at the end of 1960. On June 30, Wilbur Wood made his major league baseball 
debut with the Red Sox. In a game against the Cleveland Indians, Wood pitched 
4 innings, allowed 3 hits, and 2 earned runs. He had 3 strikeouts and allowed 
1 walk.[2] On October 1, in a game against the New York Yankees, Red Sox 
pitcher Tracy Stallard gave up Roger Maris' 61st home run of the season, 
breaking Babe Ruth's record for most home runs in a season. [1] [2] [3]
