In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 40–40 club is the group of batters 
who have collected 40 home runs and 40 stolen bases in a single season. 
Jose Canseco was the first to achieve this, doing so in 1988 after having 
predicted the feat in April of that year.[1][2] The most recent player 
to reach the milestone is Alfonso Soriano, achieving the feat during the 
2006 season. In total, only four players have reached the 40–40 club in 
MLB history and none have done so more than once. Of these, three were 
right-handed batters and one was left-handed. Two players—Barry Bonds and 
Alex Rodriguez—are also members of the 500 home run club.[3] Jose Canseco 
is the only player to have won the MVP Award in the same year as his 40–40 
season.[4] Alfonso Soriano collected 41 doubles alongside achieving 40–40.[5][6] 
Rodriguez is the only non-outfielder to attain 40–40.[a] Becoming a member 
of the 40–40 club is an elusive achievement in modern American baseball, 
as players who possess the power to hit 40 home runs and the speed to steal 
40 bases in a season are rare. Generally a player with the strength to 
hit 40 home runs will not have nearly the speed necessary to steal 40 bases, 
and vice versa. This remains true even as statistical trends change in 
baseball — stolen base totals in the 1980s were unusually high, but very 
few players reached 40 home runs; home run totals were extremely high in 
the late 1990s, but stolen bases became more rare as the steal was a sparingly 
used tactic. Bonds achieved the feat when his body was lean and quick, 
before his body grew thicker.[8] Due to the relative modernity of the 40–40 
club, no eligible club members have been elected to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame. Eligibility requires that a player has "been retired five seasons" 
or deceased for at least six months,[9] disqualifying active players. As 
of the 2015 season only Rodriguez remains active. Bonds remains on the 
Hall of Fame Ballot, and Soriano will be eligible for the Hall of Fame 
in 2020. Soriano is the only member that has not been linked to the use 
of performance-enhancing drugs;[10] he joined the club in 2006 after MLB 
started its drug-test program.[11] Bonds and Canseco were named in the 
Mitchell Report,[12][13] while Rodriguez admitted in 2009 to using steroids.[14][15] 
Soriano is also the only player to achieve the feat while playing at home. 
After stealing a base in an October 2, 2015 game for the NC Dinos, first 
baseman Eric Thames became the first player to join the Korea Baseball 
Organization's 40–40 club.[16] The first player to approach the mark was 
Ken Williams in 1922, with 39 home runs and 37 stolen bases, thus making 
him the first player to reach the 30–30 club. It would take another 30 
years for another player to come close to 40–40, as Willie Mays did in 
1956 with 36 home runs and 40 stolen bases. Bobby Bonds hit his 38th home 
run of the season on September 9, 1973, but came up one home run shy of 
becoming the founding member of the club after hitting just one home run 
in the Giants' final 21 games. When Canseco predicted he would reach 40–40 
in 1988, he mistakenly assumed "five or six players must have done it."[20] 
After Canseco became the first member of the club, Hall of Famer Mickey 
Mantle was quoted as saying, "Hell, If I'd known 40–40 was going to be 
a big deal, I'd have done it every year!"[21] Mantle never stole more than 
21 bases in a single season and achieved 21 stolen bases only once in his 
career.[22] In recent years, the 40–40 club has come close to gaining two 
new members in the same season. In 2002, both Vladimir Guerrero of the 
Montreal Expos and Alfonso Soriano of the New York Yankees were only one 
home run short of reaching 40–40 after achieving 39 and 40 stolen bases, 
respectively.[23] In 2004, Carlos Beltrán was two home runs shy as he hit 
38 and collected 43 steals, splitting the season between the Kansas City 
Royals and Houston Astros. In 2011, Matt Kemp came up one home run shy, 
as he hit 39 and stole 40 bases. Kemp accomplished this even though his 
team played in only 161 games that season, as the Dodgers had the second 
game of a doubleheader on September 8 against the Nationals cancelled and
