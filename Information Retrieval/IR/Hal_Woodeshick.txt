Harold Joseph Woodeshick (August 24, 1932 – June 14, 2009) was an American 
left-handed pitcher who spent eleven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
with the Detroit Tigers (1956, 1961), Cleveland Indians (1958), both American 
League Washington Senators (1959–61), Houston Colt .45s/Astros (1962–65) 
and St. Louis Cardinals (1965–67). He was the first-ever closer in Colt 
.45s/Astros history. He was also a member of the Cardinals' 1967 World 
Series Championship team. He was nicknamed The Switchman for his ability 
to "turn out the lights" on opposing batters.[1] Born on August 24, 1932 
in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Woodeshick signed with the Philadelphia 
Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1950.[2] His time with them consisted 
of only one inning pitched for the Carbondale Pioneers, the Phillies' North 
Atlantic League team. He split his 1951 campaign with a pair of independent 
minor league clubs: the Duluth Dukes of the Northern League (three games) 
and the Youngstown A's of the Middle Atlantic League (two innings). He 
joined the New York Giants organization in 1952, winning 13 decisions that 
year with the Kingsport Cherokees of the Appalachian League and 14 in 1955 
with the Danville Leafs of the Carolina League.[3] He served in the United 
States Army during the two years between those seasons. He was selected 
by Detroit in the minor league draft on November 27, 1955.[2] A 12-game 
winner with the Charleston Senators in 1956,[3] he made his major league 
debut later that year on September 14 in a 5–1 defeat to the eventual World 
Series Champion New York Yankees at Briggs Stadium. He picked up the loss 
after surrendering four runs in three innings as the starter.[4] His only 
other appearance with the Tigers came ten days later on September 24 in 
another start at home which resulted in him yielding four runs again and 
earning his second straight loss. This time his outing lasted 2⅓ innings 
in the Chicago White Sox's 14–11 triumph.[5] He returned to the minors 
in 1957, dividing his time between Charleston and the Augusta Tigers.[3] 
He was traded with Jay Porter to Cleveland for Hank Aguirre and Jim Hegan 
on February 18, 1958. Woodeshick split the 1958 campaign between the Indians 
and its top farm team in San Diego where he won ten contests, and began 
the next one with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was dealt to the Washington 
Senators along with Hal Naragon for Ed Fitz Gerald on May 25, 1959. After 
that franchise moved west and became the Minnesota Twins, he was picked 
in the 1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft by the second Washington 
Senators on December 14, 1960. He returned to the Detroit Tigers just under 
six months later on June 5, 1961 in exchange for Chuck Cottier. Woodeshick 
was also loaned to the Charleston (WV) Marlins for part of the 1961 season.[2][3] 
He once reflected on the nomadic nature of the early years of his baseball 
career, saying, "People talk about pressure now, but pressure was driving 
a wife and child across the country with no contract, a bad back, and not 
knowing whether you're going to have a job next year."[1] Woodeshick was 
on the Houston Colt .45s roster for the expansion team's inaugural Opening 
Day in 1962. His contract had been purchased on October 12, 1961 from the 
Denver Bears, the Tigers' American Association affiliate at the time. General 
manager Paul Richards, who had previously managed the Baltimore Orioles, 
was impressed with several of his qualities such as his six-foot-four-inch 
(1.93 meters) height, work ethic and an ability to throw an effective sinker. 
The most important one was Woodeshick having his best performances against 
Richards' old ballclub.[1] In the fifteen games he pitched versus the Orioles, 
he was 4–1 with a 1.80 earned run average (ERA).[6] The acquisition was 
a big risk because Woodeshick was prone to wildness with his pitches and 
had problems with his fielding. He spent most of his first Colt .45s spring 
training working with Richards and pitching coach Cot Deal to correct his 
inability to make accurate throws to the first baseman after cleanly fielding 
ground balls. The solution was for Woodeshick to jog toward the first baseman 
and lob an overhand soft toss to him.[7] Under Richards' tutelage, he improved 
his curveball and learned how to throw the slip pitch.[1] Woodeshick started 
in 26 of his 31 appearances in 1962.[2] In the Colt .45s' second-ever regular 
season contest on April 11, its first at night, he pitched eight innings 
and endured a one-hour rain delay in the fourth to earn a 2–0 victory over 
the Chicago Cubs.[8] He finished the campaign with a 5–16 record due to 
a pair of nagging injuries. A slow-healing throat infection had left him 
out of playing shape at midseason. By the time he was released at year's 
end, his back pain was so debilitating that his wife had to drive him back 
to their Pennsylvania home. After two spinal taps failed to provide a cure, 
his problem was remedied by a chiropractor who prescribed an exercise regimen.[1] 
He returned to the Colt .45s as its first-ever legitimate closer in 1963, 
winning eleven games with a team-leading ten saves and a 1.97 ERA. His 
success was based largely on having picked up the slider from Rusty Staub.[7] 
Woodeshick pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Ray Culp for the 
National League in the 1963 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, striking 
out Joe Pepitone in the sixth and Bob Allison and Harmon Killebrew in the 
seventh. The only two baserunners he allowed were Zoilo Versalles (walk) 
and Brooks Robinson (single), both in the sixth.[9] His best year in the 
majors was 1964 when he led the senior circuit in saves with 23.[2] A trade 
deadline deal on June 15, 1965 sent him, along with Chuck Taylor, to the 
Cardinals for Mike Cuellar and Ron Taylor.[2] Used exclusively out of the 
bullpen, Woodeshick led the team in saves with 15 in 1965. He was replaced 
as the closer by Joe Hoerner the following year.[10] As a member of the 
1967 World Series Champions, Woodeshick's only appearance in the Fall Classic 
was a scoreless bottom half of the eighth inning in relief of Ray Washburn 
in Game Six. After getting both George Thomas and Joe Foy each to ground 
out, he surrendered a single to Mike Andrews, who was retired when the 
next batter, Carl Yastrzemski, hit into a fielder's choice.[11] Woodeshick's 
professional baseball career ended when he was released by the Cardinals 
on October 20, 1967, only eight days after The Series concluded.[12] In 
11 major league seasons he had a 44–62 win-loss record, 427 games, 62 games 
started, 7 complete games, 1 shutout, 197 games finished, 61 saves, 847.1 
innings pitched, 816 hits allowed, 400 runs allowed (335 earned), 40 home 
runs allowed, 389 walks allowed (61 intentional), 484 strikeouts, 35 hit 
batsmen, 55 wild pitches, 3,717 batters faced, 5 balks and a 3.56 ERA.[2]
