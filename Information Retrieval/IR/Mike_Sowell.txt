Mike Sowell is a sports historian and the author of three baseball books, 
including The Pitch That Killed about Ray Chapman and Carl Mays. Named 
a Notable Book of the Year by The New York Times in 1989,[citation needed] 
and winner of the CASEY Award for best baseball book of 1989,[1] The Pitch 
That Killed tells the story of the only on-field fatality in major league 
baseball history, when the Yankees' Mays beaned the Indians' Chapman in 
the final weeks of the 1920 American League pennant race.[2] Sowell also 
wrote about baseball tragedies in his other books. One Pitch Away, about 
the 1986 baseball postseason and the key players involved, featured Donnie 
Moore, the Angels pitcher whose suicide two years later was linked to his 
role in the 1986 ALCS, and Bill Buckner, whose 20-year career was tainted 
by missing a ground ball in Game 6 of the World Series.[3] July 2, 1903 
explored the mysterious death of Hall-of-Famer Ed Delahanty, who died after 
being swept over Niagara Falls.[4] In addition to his books and articles 
on baseball history, Sowell wrote the text for Cardtoons, a set of baseball 
parody cards that led to a lawsuit with the Major League Baseball Players 
Association.[5][6] In Cardtoons v. MLBPA, the court ruled in 1996 that 
the cards parodying the players and their greed were protected by the First 
Amendment.[7][8] Sowell, a former sportswriter for the Tulsa Tribune,[2] 
is now a journalism professor at Oklahoma State University.[9] He was inducted
