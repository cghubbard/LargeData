Charles L. "Chuck" Thompson (June 10, 1921–March 6, 2005) was an American 
sportscaster best known for his broadcasts of Major League Baseball's Baltimore 
Orioles and the National Football League's Baltimore Colts. He was well-recognized 
for his resonant voice, crisply descriptive style of play-by-play, and 
signature on-air exclamations "Go to war, Miss Agnes!" and "Ain't the beer 
cold!". Thompson was born in Palmer, Massachusetts and moved with his family 
to Reading, Pennsylvania in 1927. He began his broadcasting career in 1939 
at WRAW-AM in Reading, working there until 1942. After spending only a 
month at WKBN-AM in Youngstown, Ohio that same year, he joined WIBG-AM 
in Philadelphia as an on-air announcer. His career was interrupted in October, 
1943 when he was conscripted into the United States Army. Promoted to the 
rank of sergeant, he was sent to Europe aboard the Queen Mary in January, 
1945 and ended up fighting in the Battle of the Bulge. After an honorable 
discharge in August, 1945, he returned to WIBG. For three years starting 
in 1946, he, along with Byrum Saam and Claude Haring, called all the home 
games of both Philadelphia professional baseball teams, the Athletics and 
Phillies.[1] He also called Temple University football during this period. 
In 1949, Thompson was hired by the Gunther Brewing Company to be WITH-AM's 
play-by-play voice for both the International League Orioles and the Colts, 
at the time a member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Despite 
being laid off following the 1951 IL season because the brewery felt no 
need for a salaried announcer, he joined WITH in order for him to continue 
doing the broadcasts. When the American League's St. Louis Browns moved 
to Baltimore, Maryland and were rechristened the Orioles in 1954, his previous 
connections with Gunther prevented him from becoming a broadcaster for 
the franchise. The National Brewing Company had purchased the team's broadcast 
rights and hired Ernie Harwell as the lead voice, but still wanted Thompson 
to be part of the coverage. He agreed to work with Harwell on Orioles broadcasts 
on WCBM-AM and WMAR-TV in 1955. Two years later he joined Bob Wolff to 
call Washington Senators games on WWDC-AM and WTOP-TV, succeeding Arch 
McDonald as a result of National Brewing becoming the team's new sponsor. 
Thompson returned to broadcast Orioles games on both radio and television 
(WBAL-AM and WJZ-TV from 1962–1978, WFBR-AM from 1979–1982, and WMAR-TV 
from 1979–1987), and would continue to do so until his first retirement 
after the 1987 season. The prime of his career was the seventeen years 
he shared the broadcast booth with Bill O'Donnell, beginning in 1966. During 
that span, the pair would describe two World Series Championships, five 
American League Pennants, six A.L. Eastern Division titles and only one 
losing season. Others who worked with Thompson on Orioles broadcasts included 
Frank Messer (1964–1967), Jim Karvellas (1968–1969), John Gordon (1970–1972), 
Brooks Robinson (1978–1987), and Tom Marr (1979–1982). Thompson was also 
the narrator of the official 1966 World Series highlight film jointly produced 
by both major leagues. Besides his baseball-related achievements, Thompson 
also called Colts football for many years, first on CBS television in the 
1950s and '60s, and then alongside Vince Bagli on WCBM Radio from 1973 
until the team's relocation to Indianapolis in 1984. From 1964–1969 he 
narrated the Colts' season review films produced by NFL Films, making on-camera 
appearances in the first two. The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters 
Association named Thompson as Maryland Sportscaster of the Year for eight 
consecutive years from 1959 to 1966. Thompson was also the host of WBAL-TV's 
Duckpins and Dollars from 1962–1974. Thompson's national television debut 
was in 1954 when he succeeded Ray Scott as the voice of the NFL's Saturday 
night Game of the Week on the DuMont Television Network, as well as that 
year's NFL Championship Game. Four years later, he teamed with Chris Schenkel 
to call the telecast of the legendary 1958 Championship Game on NBC. The 
announcers flipped a coin to determine play-by-play assignments for the 
two halves. Schenkel won the toss and chose the second half. Thompson ended 
up broadcasting the first-ever sudden-victory overtime in professional 
football history. Thompson also called the 1959 and 1964 Championship Games 
for NBC and CBS, respectively, and regular-season NFL games for the Mutual 
radio network. In 1988, he was among several veteran announcers who called 
some September NFL telecasts for NBC while many of the network's regular 
broadcasters were working that year's Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. 
Thompson also did baseball work for NBC, beginning with the Game of the 
Week in 1959 and 1960. He, along with Curt Gowdy, covered the Memorial 
Stadium legs of the World Series in 1966, 1970 and 1971, and conducted 
the victorious post-Series clubhouse interviews in 1966 and 1970. He is 
particularly remembered for his flawed but endearing call of Bill Mazeroski's 
championship-clinching home run to end the 1960 World Series, for which 
he was the play-by-play announcer for NBC Radio.(Audio) This event was 
replayed in full on an MLB radio special some years ago, during one of 
the players' strikes. The pitcher was actually Ralph Terry; Art Ditmar 
was warming up in the bullpen, and besides that error, Thompson just got 
caught up in the moment: In 1985, Thompson's Ditmar-Terry flub became a 
commercial hit, featured as an audio-over in a nostalgia-immersed Budweiser 
TV ad during that year's World Series. A libel lawsuit subsequently filed 
by Ditmar against Anheuser-Busch and its advertising agency for the commercial 
was ultimately rejected by a United States District Court.[2] Thompson 
came out of retirement in 1991 to work part-time on Orioles games for WBAL-AM 
when Jon Miller was away broadcasting ESPN Sunday Night Baseball. Failing 
eyesight caused by macular degeneration forced him to retire for good in 
2000. He received the Ford C. Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame and Museum in 1993. In January 2009, the American Sportscasters 
Association ranked Thompson 34th on its list of Top 50 Sportscasters of 
All Time.[3] Thompson, who lived in Lutherville, Maryland, at the time, 
died at Greater Baltimore Medical Center on March 6, 2005, after suffering 
a stroke. "Go to war, Miss Agnes!" was picked up from a golfing friend 
who never swore and whose putting failed to improve even after reading 
a book about it. Thompson explained the details in Curt Smith's Voices 
of The Game: Thompson phased out the expression when the Vietnam War was 
protracted. "Ain't the beer cold!" became the title of Thompson's autobiography,
