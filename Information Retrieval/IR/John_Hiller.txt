John Frederick Hiller (born April 8, 1943) is a former left-handed relief 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Detroit 
Tigers. After suffering a heart attack in 1971, he returned to the team 
and recorded 38 saves in 1973 – a major league record until 1983, and a 
team record until 2000. He also set an American League record by winning 
17 games in relief in 1974. His 125 career saves ranked fourth in AL history 
and were the seventh most among all left-handers when he retired, and stood 
as a team record until 1993. His 545 career games pitched ranked ninth 
among AL left-handers at the end of his career, and remain the franchise 
record. Hiller grew up in Scarborough, Ontario, and after signing with 
the Tigers in 1962, he broke in with the team in 1965, but didn't see substantial 
play until 1967 when he appeared in 23 games. He pitched in 39 games for 
the 1968 pennant winners, posting a 9–6 record with 2 saves and a 2.39 
earned run average. It was during this season that he acquired the nickname 
"Ratso". He and some of his teammates went to see the movie Midnight Cowboy. 
The character "Ratso" Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman, had a limp, as did 
Hiller at the time.[1] He had two unsuccessful relief appearances in the 
1968 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, pitching the last two 
innings in the 7–3 Game 3 loss and facing five batters without recording 
an out in Game 4, a 10–1 loss. He allowed six hits and three walks, posting 
a 13.50 ERA, but the Tigers recovered to win the Series in seven games. 
After his January 11, 1971 heart attack, he had a lengthy recovery and 
was invited to 1972 spring training, but was left off the roster and designated 
as a coach when the year began, starting the season as a batting practice 
pitcher. He rejoined the team in July, and had a 2.03 ERA in 24 games with 
3 saves; his sole win came in a pivotal start, beating the Milwaukee Brewers 
5–1 in the last weekend as the Tigers drove to the Eastern Division title. 
He pitched in three games in the 1972 American League Championship Series 
against the Oakland Athletics, winning Game 4 when Detroit scored three 
times in the bottom of the 10th inning to win 4–3. 1973 marked a full return, 
as Hiller posted a 1.44 ERA and an Adjusted ERA+ of 285—the highest in 
Detroit Tigers history and one of the highest in baseball history. (See 
Detroit Tigers award winners and league leaders) Hiller also broke Clay 
Carroll's record of 37 saves, set the previous year with the Cincinnati 
Reds; he also led the league with 65 appearances. Hiller became the first 
Tiger to lead the AL in saves since Al Benton in 1940, and the first to 
lead the league in games since Harry Coveleski in 1915. His saves record 
would stand for ten years until Dan Quisenberry saved 45 games with the 
1983 Kansas City Royals; Dave Righetti would be the first left-hander to 
top his total, with 46 in 1986 for the New York Yankees, and Todd Jones 
broke his club record with 42 in 2000. He won baseball's Hutch Award – 
given for fighting spirit and competitive desire – in 1973 after having 
recovered from his heart attack, as well as the AL Fireman of the Year 
Award and Comeback Player of the Year Award. Hiller was also the last man 
to throw a pitch in the "original" Yankee Stadium, getting New York Yankee 
Mike Hegan to fly out to center field in an 8–5 Detroit win. In 1974, Hiller 
set an AL record with 17 relief wins, topping Dick Radatz' total of 16 
with the 1964 Boston Red Sox; Bill Campbell tied the record with the 1976 
Minnesota Twins, though it has not been broken. Hiller also made the AL 
All-Star team for the only time in 1974, and early in the year broke Terry 
Fox's team record of 55 career saves. In 1979, Hiller passed Mickey Lolich 
to become Detroit's top left-hander with 509 career games. He retired from 
baseball after appearing in 11 games in 1980 and breaking Hooks Dauss' 
franchise record of 538 games pitched. He ended his career with a record 
of 87–76, a 2.83 ERA and 1036 strikeouts in 1242 innings pitched. His saves 
total then ranked behind only Sparky Lyle (231), Hoyt Wilhelm (154) and 
Rollie Fingers (136) in AL history. His Tigers record of 125 career saves 
was broken by Mike Henneman in 1993. Hiller went into the insurance business 
and owned his own pet store for a year in Duluth, Minnesota after leaving 
baseball. He currently lives in Michigan's Upper Peninsula with his wife 
Lynette and dog Ollie. He was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1985, and into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. During 
the 1977 season, Hiller was pitching for the Tigers in a game against the 
Seattle Mariners, who at the time were a first-year expansion team playing 
their home games in the Seattle Kingdome. The Kingdome had huge speakers 
hanging from its roof, in which a batted ball could very easily hit. Hiller 
gave up what appeared to be a game-winning home run to former teammate 
Willie Horton, but the ball hit one of the speakers and bounded back onto 
the field. In his post-game interview, Hiller was quoted as saying, "If 
a ball hits one of those (speakers) and saves a game for a pitcher, he 
ought to go to church the next day. I guess you know where I'll be tomorrow!"
