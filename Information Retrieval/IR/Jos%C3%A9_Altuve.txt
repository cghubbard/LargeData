José Carlos Altuve (Spanish pronunciation: [alˈtuβe]; born May 6, 1990) 
is a Venezuelan professional baseball second baseman for the Houston Astros 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). Altuve made his major league debut in July 
2011. As of 2014, he is the shortest active MLB player at 5 feet 6 inches 
(1.68 m). Altuve has been selected to four All-Star Games, making his first 
All-Star Game start in 2015. In 2014, he became the first player in over 
80 years to reach 130 hits and 40 stolen bases before the All-Star Game. 
That same season he became the first Astro to win the batting title after 
hitting .341. Altuve attended a tryout at the Houston Astros' facility 
in Venezuela. He was cut as the Astros felt he was too short. With the 
encouragement of his father, Altuve returned to the next tryout session, 
and was eventually given an evaluation.[1] The Astros signed Altuve before 
the 2007 season as an undrafted free agent for a $15,000 signing bonus.[2] 
After a strong 2007 season in the Venezuelan Summer League in which he 
hit .343, he came to the United States in 2008 and hit .284 in 40 games 
for the Greeneville Astros in the Rookie-level Appalachian League. He returned 
to Greeneville in '09 and hit .324 with 21 steals in just 45 games, earning 
him a spot on the league all-star team, team MVP honors,[3] and a promotion 
to the Tri-City ValleyCats of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League 
for which he played in 21 games. He began 2010 with the Lexington Legends 
of the Class A South Atlantic League, hitting .308 with 39 steals and 11 
home runs and earning a spot on the league all-star team, then moved up 
to the Lancaster JetHawks in the Class A-Advanced California League and 
hit .276. Returning to Lancaster for 2011, he hit .408 with 19 steals in 
52 games. After being promoted to the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class 
AA Texas League, he hit .361, giving him an overall line of .389 with 24 
steals, 26 walks, and 40 strikeouts in 357 minor league at-bats that year. 
He was named the second baseman on Baseball America's 2011 Minor League 
All Star Team as well as the Houston Astros Minor League Player of the 
Year. Altuve was called up to the major league club in mid-summer, bypassing 
Class AAA level. The Astros promoted Altuve to the majors for the first 
time on July 19, 2011.[4] He represented the Astros at the 2011 All-Star 
Futures Game.[5] He was named the second baseman on Baseball America's 
2011 Minor League All Star team.[6] On July 27, 2011, Altuve tied Russ 
Johnson for the Astros record for most consecutive games with a hit to 
start a career with 7.[7] On August 20, 2011, Altuve hit an inside-the-park 
home run, his first major league home-run. He became the first Astros player 
since Adam Everett in 2003 to hit an inside-the-park home run, the first 
Astros player to get his first major league home run on an inside-the-park 
home run since pitcher Butch Henry in 1992, and the first Astros player 
to lead off a game with an inside-the-park home run since Bill Doran in 
1987.[8] He batted .346 over his first 21 games before slumping a bit and 
ended the year with a .276 average. He also hit two home runs, stole seven 
bases and posted a .358 slugging percentage in 221 at-bats. Altuve returned 
to Venezuela to play for Navegantes del Magallanes in the Venezuelan Winter 
League, hitting .339 with a .381 on-base percentage and a .455 slugging 
percentage. Altuve finished 2011 with 898 plate appearances (391 in the 
minors, 234 in the majors, and 273 in Venezuela). Altuve had 82 hits in 
winter league, bringing his cumulative year-end count to 282.[9] On May 
1, Altuve faced New York Mets reliever Jon Rauch, who at 6 feet 11 inches 
(2.11 m) is the tallest player in major league history. The 18-inch (460 mm) 
height differential is believed to be the biggest between pitcher and batter 
with exception of a 1951 publicity stunt in which a 3-foot-7-inch (1.09 m) 
Eddie Gaedel had one at-bat for the St. Louis Browns.[10] Altuve was the 
Astros' representative at the 2012 MLB All Star Game.[11] On July 13, 2013, 
Altuve signed a four-year, $12.5 million extension that includes two club 
options for 2018 and 2019 worth $6 and $6.5 million respectively. The deal 
also included a $750,000 bonus to be received in 2013. At the time of the 
extension, Altuve was hitting .280 with 21 SB, 15 2B and 28 RBI.[12] On 
June 29, 2014, Altuve stole two bases in a game against the Detroit Tigers. 
This made him the first MLB player since Ray Chapman in 1917 to steal two 
or more bases in four consecutive games.[13] In 2014, Altuve became the 
first MLB player since 1933 to have 130 hits and 40 stolen bases before 
the All-Star Break.[14] Altuve was named an All-Star in 2014. Coupled with 
his 2012 All-Star nod in the Astros' final season as a National League 
team, Altuve is the only player in Major League history to represent both 
the American and National Leagues in the All-Star Game while still being 
a member of the same team.[15] On September 16, Altuve hit a single up 
the middle to break Craig Biggio's franchise single season hit record of 
210 hits. The Astros had 11 games remaining in the season at the time that 
Altuve broke the record.[16] In 158 games, Altuve had 225 hits and a .341 
batting average, both of which led the major leagues. His 56 stolen bases 
led the American League. He also had 47 doubles, 7 home runs, and 59 RBI. 
He became the first Astros player to win a batting title.[17] After the 
2014 season, Altuve traveled to Japan to participate in the 2014 Major 
League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.[18] He was named the GIBBY/This 
Year in Baseball Award winner as the Breakout Everyday Player of the Year.[19] 
Altuve was voted as the AL's starting second baseman for the 2015 MLB All-Star 
Game.[20] On September 11, 2015, Altuve hit his 800th career hit, surpassing 
Craig Biggio for the fastest Astro player to reach 800 hits.[21] In the 
final game of the season, Altuve went 3 for 5 to hit the 200 hit mark for 
the second season in a row, becoming the first player in Astros history 
to achieve two 200 hit seasons in a row. This also makes Altuve the first 
player from Venezuela with multiple 200 hits seasons. Altuve finished the 
season with a .313 batting average, third best in the majors, and 15 HRs, 
a career high. He finished leading the American League in stolen bases 
for the second consecutive year. He also led the American league in fielding 
percentage (.993) for second base. With the Astros entering the American 
League wild card, Altuve went to the playoffs for the first time in his 
career. Altuve was awarded his first career Gold Glove Award for second 
base on November 10.[22] He also received his second consecutive Silver 
Slugger Award. In 2016, Altuve was an All-Star selection for the fourth 
time of his career, and second consecutive start. In 161 games, Altuve 
had an MLB-leading 216 hits, an AL-leading .338 batting average, 30 stolen 
bases. He also found a power surge with a career high 42 doubles, 24 home 
runs, and 96 RBI. This marked his second batting title, the last being 
in 2014. At the end of the season, he was named The Sporting News Player 
of the Year,[23] and the MLBPA Players Choice Awards for Major League Player 
of the Year, AL Most Outstanding Player, and Majestic Always Game Award.[24] 
Originally listed at 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), Altuve is now listed at 
his correct height of 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m), making him the shortest 
active player in Major League Baseball,[25] and the shortest since Freddie 
Patek retired following the 1981 season.[26] Inspired by broadcasters debating 
how many "Altuves" a particular home run traveled, Bryan Trostel created 
a simple web-based calculator to calculate distance in Official Standard 
Listed Altuves (OSLA). To match Altuve's listed height, one OSLA = 5.417 
feet. Altuve himself has been receptive of the idea, saying "It's funny, 
man... When they told me how many 'Altuves' was a home run, I just laughed."[27] 
Trostel, who published his calculator at How Many Altuves, has expanded 
it to include speed (Altuves per second) as well as cubic and squared Altuves 
for volume and area. On Nov. 1, 2016, Altuve and his wife Nina welcomed
