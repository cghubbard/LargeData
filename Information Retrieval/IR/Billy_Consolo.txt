William Angelo Consolo (August 18, 1934 – March 27, 2008) was an American 
shortstop and coach in Major League Baseball who played for five different 
teams between 1953 and 1962, most notably the Boston Red Sox and Washington 
Senators/Minnesota Twins. Primarily used in a reserve role, he enjoyed 
his best season with the 1957 Red Sox, batting .270 in 68 games. He later 
served as a coach for the Detroit Tigers for 14 seasons from 1979 to 1992 
and again in 1995[1] under manager Sparky Anderson, including the Tigers' 
1984 World Series title. Listed at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 180 lb., he batted 
and threw right-handed. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Consolo grew up in Los 
Angeles, graduating from Dorsey High School. While in high school, Consolo 
(along with longtime friend Sparky Anderson) played on the school's baseball 
team. Consolo also ran track at Dorsey and was named the Los Angeles High 
School Baseball city player of the year in 1951 and 1952.[1] Consolo also 
played (along with Anderson) for the Crenshaw Post 715 American Legion 
team, winning the American Legion Baseball national title in 1951,[2] winning 
the championship at Briggs Stadium, the stadium where he coached the Detroit 
Tigers.[3] Consolo went directly to the Red Sox from high school after 
signing in 1953 (bonus baby). Consolo joined the Red Sox at age 18; Sparky 
Anderson said that he was the finest athlete he's seen at that age.[3] 
Consolo played for the Red Sox during six and half years. Consolo was traded 
to the Washington Senators on June 11, 1959 in a four-player deal that 
sent relief pitcher Murray Wall and Consolo to the Senators for relief 
pitcher Dick Hyde and infielder Herb Plews.[4] The Twins later traded Consolo 
to the Milwaukee Braves on June 1, 1961 for Billy Martin and some cash.[5] 
In addition to the Senators/Twins (1959–61), Consolo played for the Philadelphia 
Phillies, Los Angeles Angels and Kansas City Athletics in his final 1962 
season. His 1957 average of .270 was 41 points better than he hit in any 
other year. In a 10-season career, Consolo was a .221 hitter (260 for 1178) 
with nine home runs and 83 runs batted in in 603 games, including 158 runs, 
31 doubles, 11 triples, nine stolen bases, and a .315 on-base percentage. 
After his playing days ended in 1962, Consolo returned to Los Angeles and 
like his father before him he became a barber at the old Statler Hilton 
Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.[1] He also worked at Los Angeles Pierce
