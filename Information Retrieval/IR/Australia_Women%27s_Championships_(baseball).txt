The Australian Women's Championships is an annual event run by the Australian 
Baseball Federation. The Championship includes the women's Queensland Rams, 
Western Australia Heat, Victoria Aces, New South Wales Patriots as well 
as Victorian Provincial, a New South Wales Country team and Australian 
Capital Territory. The tournament for the first 10 years was dominated 
by Victoria, winning nine and only rivalled by New South Wales, who have 
won two tournaments. This is mainly due to the strong women's baseball 
competition in Victoria, which includes 22 teams over three divisions, 
perhaps the largest local women's baseball competition in the world.[1] 
In 2010, the Western Australia Heat went the tournament undefeated, defeating 
New South Wales in the final 7-6. This was the first final without Victoria 
competing in it and the first time Western Australia won the tournament.
