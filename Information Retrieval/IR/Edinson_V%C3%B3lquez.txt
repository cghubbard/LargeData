Edinson Vólquez [VOHL-kess[1]] (born July 3, 1983) is a Dominican professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Texas Rangers, Cincinnati Reds, San Diego Padres, Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Kansas City Royals. Vólquez signed with 
the Rangers in 2001 under the name of Julio Reyes. He went by Edison Vólquez 
after 2003, before adding an n to his first name in 2007. Volquez grew 
up in the Dominican Republic and started playing baseball when he was 9 
or 10 with the support of his parents. "It was good for me because my mom 
and dad always took care of me... The only thing I did was go to school 
and play baseball." [2] Vólquez was signed as an amateur free agent by 
the Texas Rangers in the Dominican Republic in 2001. Together with John 
Danks and Thomas Diamond, Vólquez was one third of the "DVD" trio of Rangers 
pitching prospects.[3][4] After spending four years in the Rangers' minor 
league system, Vólquez made his Major League debut on August 30, 2005 in 
a start against the Chicago White Sox. He lost all three Major League games 
he started that season, as well as one of the three games in which he appeared 
as a reliever, and posted a 14.21 ERA. He spent the first five months of 
the 2006 season at Triple-A Oklahoma until he was recalled to the majors 
in September. This time, he fared better, winning one of his eight starts 
and posting a 7.29 ERA. The Rangers were dissatisfied with the results 
shown by one of their top pitching prospects, so in 2007 they tried an 
unconventional tactic. Vólquez was demoted to the Rangers' A-League affiliate, 
the Bakersfield Blaze, to work on his control. As Vólquez progressed, he 
was slowly promoted up through the minor league system until he reached 
the big leagues in September. This tactic had been used by Mark Connor, 
the Rangers' pitching coach, once before. Vólquez showed much improvement 
in his big league performance that season, posting a 2-1 record and 4.50 
ERA in six starts. Vólquez later said about the time in the minors, "At 
the time, I didn't understand, because if I play in the Big Leagues, why 
do I have to go all the way back to Single-A?... It made me better. It 
made me a better person."[2] On December 21, 2007, the Rangers traded Vólquez 
to the Cincinnati Reds, along with Daniel Ray Herrera, in a deal for Josh 
Hamilton. Vólquez made his Reds' debut on April 6, 2008 in a game against 
the Philadelphia Phillies in Cincinnati. In 5⅓ innings of work, he allowed 
only five hits, one earned run and two walks while striking out eight batters 
in an 8–2 victory. Vólquez started 2008 with a 7–1 record and a 1.33 ERA 
in nine starts, and allowed no more than one earned run in all but one 
of these starts (in which he allowed two). He became the only Reds pitcher 
to accomplish this since 1912. On May 18, 2008, Vólquez participated in 
a pitching matchup with the Cleveland Indians' Cliff Lee, who at that point 
led the American League with an ERA of 0.67. It was the third time in MLB 
history that the ERA leaders of each league had faced each other. Vólquez 
won the contest by a score of 6–4, improving to 7–1. Lee's loss, his first 
of the season, left him with a 6–1 record. Vólquez was selected to represent 
the National League in the 2008 MLB All-Star Game.[5] By the All-Star Break, 
Vólquez had a 12–3 record with a 2.29 ERA and 126 strikeouts. Vólquez finished 
the season with a 17–6 record and an earned run average of 3.21, 8th-best 
in the National League.[6] Vólquez threw changeups 31.9% of the time in 
2008, more than any other starter.[7] After the season, the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America put Vólquez on the ballot for National League Rookie 
of the Year Award voting, an award for which he was not eligible. He subsequently 
received three second place votes for the award, which went to Geovany 
Soto.[8] Volquez did not follow up his 2008 All-Star campaign with the 
same success. In 2009 with Cincinnati, Volquez posted a 4–2 record with 
a 4.35 ERA through June 1. He was placed on the 15-day DL with elbow pain 
on June 2, and then eventually moved to the 60-day DL in preparation for 
Tommy John surgery, which ended his season.[9] On April 20, 2010, he received 
a 50-game suspension for use of performance-enhancing drugs.[10] Volquez 
made his 2010 debut with the Reds on July 17, 2010 vs the Colorado Rockies 
with an 8-1 win. Volquez held the Rockies to one earned run and three hits 
in six innings with 9 strikeouts and 2 base on balls. However, his next 
several starts were unimpressive, and for the second time in his career, 
he was demoted straight to single-A (the Dayton Dragons). He was recalled 
on September 7 and finished the season with a 4-3 record and 4.31 ERA over 
62.2 innings. He started Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series 
against the Philadelphia Phillies and lost, allowing four earned over 1.2 
innings with Roy Halladay throwing a no hitter.[11] Vólquez was the Reds' 
Opening Day starter in 2011 and finished the season 5-7 with a 5.71 ERA 
in 20 starts for Cincinnati. He also spent time in the minor leagues, going 
4-2 with a 2.37 ERA for Triple-A Louisville.[12] On December 17, 2011, 
Vólquez, Yonder Alonso, Yasmani Grandal, and Brad Boxberger were traded 
by the Reds to the San Diego Padres for Mat Latos.[13] Volquez was the 
Padres' Opening Day starter for the 2012 season, losing 5–3 to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers.[14] Vólquez, along with Clayton Richard, was a mainstay 
of the Padres 2012 rotation, making 32 starts and pitching 182 2⁄3 innings. 
His highlight game of the season came on July 19 when he pitched a one-hit 
shutout at home against the Houston Astros.[15] Vólquez finished the season 
11-11 with a 4.14 ERA. He collected 174 strikeouts, but issued a league-leading 
105 walks. Vólquez was again the Padres' Opening Day starter in 2013. On 
June 2, Vólquez hit his first career home run, a 3-run homer off Toronto 
Blue Jays pitcher Ramón Ortiz.[16] Despite his home run, the Padres lost 
the game 7-4. The Padres designated Vólquez for assignment on August 24, 
a day after he gave up six runs while only recording two outs in a start 
against the Chicago Cubs.[17] At the time, Volquez led the NL with 95 earned 
runs. He was released three days later.[18] In 27 starts for the Padres 
in 2013, Volquez went 9-10 with a 6.01 ERA. On August 30, 2013, Vólquez 
signed an agreement with the Los Angeles Dodgers on a Major League contract.[19][20] 
Vólquez appeared for the Dodgers that night, pitching one scoreless inning 
in relief against the his former team, the Padres. He joined the Dodgers 
rotation soon after and made 5 starts in September for them. He was 0-2 
with a 4.18 ERA for the Dodgers in 2013. After the 2013 season, Vólquez 
signed a one-year deal worth $5 million with the Pittsburgh Pirates.[21] 
Volquez experienced a career rebirth with the Pirates, going 13-7 with 
a 3.04 ERA and 140 strikeouts in 32 games (31 starts). On October 1, 2014. 
Volquez started the 2014 National League Wild Card Game for the Pirates 
against the San Francisco Giants. Volquez would not come through however, 
giving up 5 ERs, including a grand slam to Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford, 
in 5 innings pitched. The Pirates would go on to lose 8-0, eliminating 
them from the playoffs in the process. The Wild Card Game would prove to 
be Volquez's last game as a Pirate, as he became a free agent after the 
2014 season. On December 29, 2014, the Kansas City Royals announced that 
they had signed Volquez to a 2-year, $20 million contract.[22] During a 
game against the Chicago White Sox on April 23, 2015, Volquez was ejected 
for his role in the brawl.[23] Two days later, he was suspended five games.[24] 
He had the option to appeal the suspension but dropped it on April 27, 
2015, which made the suspension apply effective immediately.[25] Volquez 
started Game 1 of the 2015 World Series, giving up three runs in six innings 
and receiving a no-decision. The Royals would go on to win, 5-4, in 14 
innings. Volquez pitched the game unaware that his father had died.[26] 
Vólquez got the nod to start in game 5 against Matt Harvey, where he gave 
up 2 earned runs on only 2 hits in 7 innings with a no-decision. The Royals 
again forced the game into extra innings before defeating the Mets to win 
the World Series. On June 24, 2016, Volquez witnessed one of the worst 
starts of his career as he allowed 12 runs (11 earned) in the first inning. 
He only lasted one inning as the Royals lost to the Houston Astros 4-13.[27][28] 
On November 4, Vólquez declined his option to remain with the Royals and 
became a free agent.[29] Vólquez pitched in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. 
He took the loss in the opening game for the Dominican Republic against 
the Netherlands, giving up three runs (unearned), two hits, two walks and 
three strikeouts in three innings pitched.[30] Vólquez again pitched for 
the eventual champion Dominican Republic in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, 
starting the first game in each of the three tournament rounds. He allowed 
5 runs in 10 1⁄3 innings and picked up the win in the semifinal game against 
the Netherlands.[31] Vólquez throws 4 pitches: a low to mid-90s fastball, 
a two-seam fastball that clocks also in the low to mid-90s, a mid-80s changeup 
and a high-70s curveball. Throughout his career, Vólquez has struggled 
with command of his pitches. Vólquez still makes a home in the Dominican 
Republic, where he spends four months during the off-season.[2] Vólquez's 
father died on October 27, 2015, the same day he started Game 1 of the 
World Series. His wife requested that he not be informed mid-game of his 
father's death, so he had no knowledge of his death during his start.[32] 
After pitching six innings, Vólquez exited the game and learned about the 
death in the clubhouse surrounded by his family.[33] When he was signed 
by the Rangers in 2001 at age 17, he went by the name Julio Reyes but his 
name was revealed to be Edison Vólquez after an immigration crackdown in 
2003. In 2007, he asked the Rangers to add an "n" to his name after checking
