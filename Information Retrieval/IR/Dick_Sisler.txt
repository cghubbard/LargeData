As player As manager Richard Alan Sisler (November 2, 1920 – November 20, 
1998) was an American player, coach and manager in Major League Baseball. 
A native of St. Louis, Missouri, he was the son of Hall of Fame first baseman 
and two-time .400 hitter George Sisler. Younger brother Dave Sisler was 
a relief pitcher in the 1950s and 1960s with four MLB teams, and older 
brother George Jr. was a longtime executive in minor league baseball. Sisler 
attended Colgate University. Listed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and 
205 pounds (93 kg), he batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was 
a journeyman left fielder and first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals 
(1946–47; 1952–53), Philadelphia Phillies (1948–51) and Cincinnati Reds 
(1952). In an eight-season career, he hit .276 with 55 home runs and 360 
RBI in 799 games. He made the National League All-Star team in 1950. On 
the closing day of the 1950 season, at Ebbets Field, Sisler hit a tenth-inning, 
opposite-field three-run home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers that would 
lead to the "Whiz Kids" Phillies winning their first National League pennant 
in 35 years. Had Philadelphia lost, the Phillies and Dodgers would have 
finished in a flatfooted tie for the NL championship and a best-of-three 
playoff would have resulted. The home run made Sisler world-famous; Ernest 
Hemingway feted him in his novel The Old Man and the Sea. Recording a conversation 
between an aging Cuban fisherman and his young apprentice discussing the 
1950 big-league season, Hemingway quotes the older man as saying: "In the 
other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia, I must take Brooklyn. 
But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives in the old park. 
There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever 
seen."[1] His father, George Sr., was a scout for Brooklyn in 1950. When 
asked after the pennant-winning game how he felt when his son beat his 
current team, the Dodgers, George replied, "I felt awful and terrific at 
the same time."[2] After managing in the minor leagues with the Double-A 
Nashville Vols and Triple-A Seattle Rainiers, Sisler became a coach for 
Cincinnati in 1961, serving under manager Fred Hutchinson. In August 1964, 
he was promoted to acting manager when Hutchinson, suffering from terminal 
cancer, was forced to give up the reins. He led the Reds to a 32–21 record, 
and the team finished in a second-place tie (with the Phillies), one game 
behind the Cardinals. After his formal appointment as manager in October 
1964, he brought the Reds home fourth in 1965 with an 89–73 mark before 
being fired at season's end.[3] He then returned to the major league coaching 
ranks with the Cardinals, San Diego Padres and New York Mets. In his late 
sixties, he was still working with young players as an instructor in the 
Cardinal farm system. He died Nov. 20, 1998, at the age of 78 in Nashville,
