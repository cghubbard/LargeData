The Appalachian League of Professional Baseball is a Rookie-class minor 
league baseball league that began play in 1911. It operated as a Class 
D league (1911-1914), (1921-1925), (1937-1955) and (1957-1962) before becoming 
a Rookie league in 1963. Teams are located in the Appalachian regions of 
Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia and Tennessee. The league's season 
starts in June, after major league teams have signed players that they 
selected in the annual amateur draft, and ends in September. Along with 
the Pioneer League, it forms the second-lowest rung on the minor league 
ladder. Although classified as a Rookie league, the level of play is slightly 
higher than that of the two "complex" Rookie leagues, the Gulf Coast League 
and Arizona League. Unlike these two leagues, Appalachian League games 
charge admission and sell concessions. The original Appalachian League 
only existed for four seasons from 1911-1914 and all teams were independent 
with no MLB affiliation. The teams that were a part of this were: Asheville 
Moonshiners, Bristol Boosters, Cleveland Counts, Johnson City Soldiers, 
Knoxville Appalachians, and Morristown Jobbers.[1] The second Appalachian 
League existed for five seasons from 1921-1925, and again only had independent 
teams. These teams were the Bristol State-Liners, the Cleveland Manufacturers, 
the Greeneville Burley Cats, the second iteration of the Johnson City Soldiers, 
the Kingsport Indians, and the Knoxville Pioneers. 1921 was the first appearance 
of 2 locations which have present-day teams in the Appalachian League â€“ 
Kingsport, Tennessee, with the present-day Kingsport Mets; and Greeneville, 
Tennessee, with the present-day Greeneville Astros.[2] The third Appalachian 
league was shifted to D-level minor league, the lowest level in the pre 
- 1963 MLB. It started in 1937 and had four teams - the Elizabethton Betsy 
Red Sox, the third iteration of the Johnson City Soldiers, the Newport
