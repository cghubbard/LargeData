Edward Isaih Poole (September 7, 1874 – March 11, 1919) was a pitcher in 
Major League Baseball. He played from 1900 to 1904 with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, and Brooklyn Superbas. Poole stood at 5 ft 10 in 
(1.78 m) and weighed 175 lbs.[1] Poole was born in Canton, Ohio. He started 
his professional baseball career in 1897 and played in the Interstate League 
for four seasons. In 1900, he went 20–15 for the Wheeling Stogies. He also 
played in the infield and outfield when he didn't pitch and batted .257.[2] 
Poole was then acquired by the Pirates and made his Major League debut 
in October of that year.[1] In 1901, Poole pitched sparingly for Pittsburgh, 
making 10 starts and going 5–4.[1] The Pirates won their first National 
League pennant. In April 1902, Poole was traded to Cincinnati and immediately 
had his greatest success in the Major Leagues. He made 16 starts for the 
Reds and completed all 16, while going 12–4 with a 2.15 earned run average.[1] 
In 1903, Poole suffered from a sore arm early in the season.[3] His record 
dropped to 7–13, and his ERA went up to 3.28.[1] He was sold to Brooklyn 
in 1904, but the reasons for the trade apparently had nothing to do with 
his pitching. According to the Reds' president, Garry Herrmann, Poole had 
a habit of reading books in the dugout. "One day, when we were playing 
in Cincinnati, I noticed that Poole was deeply engrossed in a book while 
sitting on the players' bench in uniform ... The next day and the next 
I noticed that Poole had the same book, and then I began to grow suspicious. 
Inquiry developed the fact that instead of a rule book he had a novel, 
which he was reading daily. That settled his chances for remaining with 
the Reds, and when Brooklyn asked for him we parted with him willingly. 
Novels and baseball don't mix when a game is being played on the field." 
– Garry Herrmann[4] Poole's troubles did not end in Cincinnati. Playing 
baseball on Sunday was not allowed in New York at the time, but Brooklyn 
Superbas owner Charles Ebbets tried to circumvent the law. For a game played 
on Sunday, April 24, Poole had the misfortune of being the starting pitcher. 
Just as the game got underway, policemen marched onto the field and arrested 
him, along with two other players.[5] Poole had to go to court and was 
eventually fined for violating the blue laws.[6] He then pitched again 
on Sunday, May 29, and was arrested for the second time. That case went 
to trial and became known as The People of New York v. Poole.[7] Poole 
started off 8–14 for Brooklyn that season, and he pitched the last Major 
League game of his career on July 27. He spent the rest of the year hunting 
rabbits and quail near his home in Canton.[8] Poole returned to baseball 
the following season and played in the minor leagues from 1905 to 1908. 
In 1905, he pitched a career-high 298 innings and won a career-high 21 
games for the Providence Clamdiggers of the Eastern League. He then won 
14 and 17 games the next two seasons but just 4 in 1908, after which his 
career ended.[2] Poole later became a merchant.[9] He died of diabetes 
mellitus in 1919 in Malvern, Ohio, and was interred in Bethlehem Cemetery
