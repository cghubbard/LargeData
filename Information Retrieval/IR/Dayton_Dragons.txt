The Dayton Dragons are a Class A minor league baseball team playing in 
the Midwest League based in Dayton, Ohio. The Dragons are affiliated with 
the Cincinnati Reds. Their home stadium is Fifth Third Field. In 2011, 
they broke the record for most consecutive sellouts by a professional sports 
team, selling out their 815th consecutive game, breaking the record formerly 
held by the Portland Trail Blazers.[2][3] The Dragons came to Dayton in 
2000. They were previously a franchise based in Rockford, Illinois, and 
were called the Rockford Expos (1988–1992), Rockford Royals (1993–1994), 
Rockford Cubbies (1995–1998), and Rockford Reds (1999). The team's home 
park is Fifth Third Field in Dayton. During its first season the Dragons 
set a class A baseball attendance record of 581,853. Dayton broke that 
record in 2003 when 590,382 fans—ranking seventh in all of minor league 
baseball—went through the turnstiles, and again in 2004 with 593,663 paying 
fans.[4] The Dragons average 8,375 fans per game, or 116% of capacity. 
The Dragons have been the top Class A team in attendance every year of 
their existence, and have set and re-broken the record for Class A attendance 
three times.[5] On April 17, 2007, the Dragons enjoyed their 500th consecutive 
sellout.[6] On July 9, 2011, the Dragons officially set a new record of 
815 consecutive sellout games.[7] The sellout streak is the longest across 
all professional sports in the US, passing the previous record set by the 
Portland Trail Blazers from 1977–1995.[8][9] On May 10, 2014, the streak 
of consecutive sellouts reached 1,000 games. According to the official 
team website, every game in the team's 15-year existence has been a sellout.[10] 
The Dragons continued their sellout streak throughout 2015 and finished 
the season with their 1,121st straight sold-out game.[11] In Summer of 
2014 founding ownership group Mandalay Baseball Properties sold the team 
to Palisades Arcadia Baseball LLC.[12] Sixty-seven Dragons players have 
gone on to play in MLB since the team's move to Dayton in 2000. The following
