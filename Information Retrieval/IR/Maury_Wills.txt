As player As manager Maurice Morning "Maury" Wills (born October 2, 1932) 
is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) primarily for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 
1959 through 1966 and the latter part of 1969 through 1972 as a shortstop 
and switch-hitter; he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1967 and 1968, 
and the Montreal Expos the first part of 1969. Wills was an essential component 
of the Dodgers' championship teams in the mid-1960s, and is credited for 
reviving the stolen base as part of baseball strategy.[1] Wills was an 
All-Star for five seasons and seven All-Star Games[2], and was the first 
MLB All-Star Game Most Valuable Player in 1962. He also was the National 
League Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1962, and a Gold Glove winner in 1961 
and 1962. In a fourteen-year career, Wills batted .281 with 20 home runs, 
458 runs batted in, 2,134 hits, 1,067 runs, 177 doubles, 71 triples, and 
586 stolen bases in 1,942 games. Since 2009, Wills is a member of the Los 
Angeles Dodgers organization serving as a representative of the Dodgers 
Legend Bureau. In 2014, Wills appeared for the first time as a candidate 
on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot[3] 
for possible Hall of Fame consideration in 2015 which required 12 votes. 
Wills missed getting elected by 3 votes.[4] All the other candidates on 
the ballot also missed being elected. The Committee meets and votes on 
ten selected candidates from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years.[5] 
Wills was born in Washington, D.C. Maurice, or Sonny as he was called at 
Cardozo Senior High School in Washington, first showed up as an All City 
Pitcher in the local Washington Daily News. He played on Sal Hall's undefeated 
'48 Cardozo football team that never had any points scored against them. 
In the '49–'50 school year, three-sport standout Sonny Wills, was named 
an All City football quarterback, basketball player, and baseball pitcher. 
On May 8, 1950, in a game against Phelps, Wills threw a one-hitter and 
struck out seventeen. Wills began his major league career in 1959 and played 
in 83 games for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In Will's first-full season in 
1960, he hit .295 and led the league with 50 stolen bases, being the first 
National League player to steal 50 bases since Max Carey stole 51 in 1923. 
In 1962, Wills stole 104 bases to set a new MLB stolen base record, breaking 
the old modern era mark of 96, set by Ty Cobb in 1915.[6] Wills also stole 
more bases than all of the other teams that year, the highest total being 
the Washington Senators' 99. Wills success in base stealing that year led 
to another remarkable statistic, he was caught stealing just 13 times all 
season. He hit .299 for the season, led the NL with 10 triples and 179 
singles, and was selected the NL Most Valuable Player over Willie Mays 
(Mays hit .304 with 49 home runs and 141 runs batten in) by seven points. 
Not until Barry Larkin in 1995 would another shortstop win a National League 
Most Valuable Player Award. Late in that record-setting 1962 season, San 
Francisco Giants Manager Alvin Dark ordered grounds crews to water down 
the base paths, turning them into mud to hinder Wills' base-stealing attempts. 
Wills played a full 162 game schedule, plus all three games of the best 
of three regular season playoff series with the Giants, giving him a total 
of 165 games played, a MLB record that still stands for most games played 
in a single season. Will's 104 steals remained a Major League record for 
switch-hitters until 1985, when Vince Coleman eclipsed the mark with 110. 
While playing for the Dodgers, Wills was a Gold Glove Award winner in 1961 
and 1962, and was named a NL All-Star five times (5 seasons); selected 
seven times for the All-Star Game (2 games were played in 1961 and 1962). 
Although Chicago White Sox shortstop Luis Aparicio had been stealing 50+ 
bases in the American League for several years prior to Wills' insurgence, 
Wills brought new prominence to the tactic.[citation needed] Perhaps this 
was due to greater media exposure in Los Angeles, or to the Dodgers' greater 
success, or to their extreme reliance on a low-scoring strategy that emphasized 
pitching, defense, and Wills' speed to compensate for their lack of productive 
hitters. Wills was a significant distraction to the pitcher even if he 
didn't try to steal, because he was a constant threat to do so.[citation 
needed] The fans at Dodger Stadium would chant, "Go! Go! Go, Maury, Go!" 
any time he got on base.[citation needed] While not the fastest runner 
in the major leagues, Wills accelerated with remarkable speed. He also 
studied pitchers relentlessly, watching their pick-off moves even when 
not on base. And when driven back to the bag, his fierce competitiveness 
made him determined to steal. Once when on first base against New York 
Mets pitcher Roger Craig, Wills drew twelve consecutive throws from Craig 
to the Mets first baseman. On Craig's next pitch to the plate, Wills stole 
second. In the wake of his record-breaking season, Wills' stolen base totals 
dropped precipitously. Though he continued to frighten pitchers once on 
base, he stole only 40 bases in 1963 and 53 bases in 1964. In 1965, Wills 
set out on a pace to break his own record. By the time of the All-Star 
Game in July, he was 19 games ahead of his 1962 pace. However, Wills at 
age 32, began to slow in the second half. The punishment of sliding led 
him to bandage his legs before every game, and he ended the 65 season with 
94 stolen bases which continues to be the second highest in National League 
history. Following the 1966 season, in which he dropped to 38 stolen bases 
and was caught stealing 24 times, the Dodgers traded Wills to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[7] Despite his age, Wills batted .302 in 1967. The following year, 
at age 36, he stole 52 bases. He was traded to Montreal and then back to 
the Dodgers in 1969, ending his career with the Dodgers club in 1972. After 
retiring, Wills spent time as a baseball analyst at NBC from 1973 through 
1977. He also managed in the Mexican Pacific League—a winter league—for 
four seasons, during which time he led the Naranjeros de Hermosillo to 
the 1970–71 season league championship.[8] Wills let it be known he felt 
qualified to pilot a big-league club. In his book, How To Steal A Pennant, 
Wills claimed he could take any last-place club and make them champions 
within four years. The San Francisco Giants allegedly offered him a one-year 
deal, but Wills turned them down. Finally, in 1980, the Seattle Mariners 
fired Darrell Johnson and gave Wills the reins. Wills' tenure was an unmitigated 
disaster. Baseball writer Rob Neyer, in his Big Book of Baseball Blunders 
criticized Wills for "the variety and frequency of [his] mistakes" as manager, 
calling them "unparalleled." In a short interview appearing in the June 
5, 2006 issue of Newsweek, Neyer said, "It wasn't just that Wills couldn't 
do the in-game stuff. Wills's inability to communicate with his players 
really sets him apart. He said he was going to make his second baseman, 
Julio Cruz, his permanent shortstop. Twenty-four hours later he was back 
at second base. As far as a guy who put in some real time (as a manager), 
I don't think there's been anyone close to Wills." According to the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer's Steve Rudman, Wills made a number of gaffes. He called 
for a relief pitcher although there was nobody warming up in the bullpen, 
held up another game for 10 minutes while looking for a pinch-hitter and 
even left a spring-training game in the sixth inning to fly to California. 
The most celebrated incident of Wills' tenure as manager occurred on April 
25, 1981. He ordered the Mariners' grounds crew to make the batter's boxes 
one foot longer than regulation. The extra foot was in the direction of 
the mound. However, Oakland Athletics manager Billy Martin noticed something 
was amiss and asked plate umpire Bill Kunkel to investigate. Under questioning 
from Kunkel, the Mariners' head groundskeeper admitted Wills had ordered 
the change. Wills claimed he was trying to help his players stay in the 
box. However, Martin suspected that given the large number of breaking-ball 
pitchers on the A's staff, Wills wanted to give his players an advantage. 
The American League suspended Wills for two games and fined him $500. American 
League umpiring supervisor Dick Butler likened Wills' actions to setting 
the bases 88 feet apart instead of 90 feet.[9] After leading Seattle to 
a 20-38 mark to end the 1980 season, new owner George Argyros fired Wills 
on May 6, 1981 with the M's deep in last place at 6-18. This gave him a 
career record of 26-56 for a winning percentage of .317, one of the worst 
ever for a non-interim manager. Years later, Wills admitted he probably 
should have gotten some seasoning as a minor-league manager prior to being 
hired in Seattle. The Maury Wills Museum is in Fargo, North Dakota at Newman 
Outdoor Field, home of the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks. Wills was a coach on 
the team from 1996 to 1997 and currently serves as a radio color commentator 
for the RedHawks on KVOX-AM "740 The Fan" with play-by-play announcer Scott 
Miller. In his autobiography, "On the Run: The Never Dull and Often Shocking 
Life of Maury Wills", Wills claimed to have had a love affair with actress 
Doris Day. Day denied this in her autobiography Doris Day: Her Own Story, 
where she said it was probably advanced by the Dodgers organization for 
publicity purposes. Wills was well known as an abuser of alcohol and cocaine 
until getting sober in 1989;[10] in December 1983, Wills was arrested for 
cocaine possession after his former girlfriend, Judy Aldrich, had reported 
her car had been stolen. During a search of the car, police found a vial 
allegedly containing .06 grams of cocaine and a water pipe. The charge 
was dismissed three months later on the grounds of insufficient evidence.[11] 
The Dodgers organization paid for a drug treatment program, but Wills walked 
out and continued to use drugs until he began a relationship with Angela 
George, who encouraged him to begin a vitamin therapy program. The two 
later married.[12] In his New Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James 
is highly critical of Wills as a person, but still ranked him as the #19 
shortstop of all time. Maury Wills is the father of former major leaguer 
Bump Wills, who played for the Texas Rangers and Chicago Cubs for six seasons. 
The two had a falling out following the publication of Maury's autobiography 
in 1991, involving a salacious anecdote, but now occasionally speak.[13] 
In 2009, Wills was honored by the city of Washington, D.C. and Cardozo 
Senior High School with the naming of the former Banneker Recreation Field 
in his honor.[14] The field was completely renovated and serves as Cardozo's 
home diamond. While Wills had broken Cobb's single season stolen base record 
in 1962, the National League had increased its number of games played per 
team that year from 154 to 162. Wills' 97th stolen base had occurred after 
his team had played its 154th game; as a result, Commissioner Ford Frick 
ruled that Wills' 104-steal season and Cobb's 96-steal season of 1915 were 
separate records, just as he had the year before (the American League had 
also increased its number of games played per team to 162) after Roger 
Maris had broken Babe Ruth's single season home run record. Both stolen 
base records would be broken in 1974 by Lou Brock's 118 steals; Brock had 
broken Cobb's stolen base record by stealing his 97th base before his St.
