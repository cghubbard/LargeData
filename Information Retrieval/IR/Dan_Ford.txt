Darnell Glenn Ford (born May 19, 1952) is a former professional baseball 
player. Nicknamed "Disco Dan", he played in the Major Leagues primarily 
as an outfielder from 1975 to 1985 for the Minnesota Twins, California 
Angels, and Baltimore Orioles. In 1,153 career games, Ford had a batting 
average of .270, 121 home runs and 566 runs batted in. Ford was picked 
18th overall in the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft by the Oakland Athletics. 
He spent four years in the minor league system for the Athletics before 
he was traded on October 23, 1974 to the Twins with Dennis Myers for Pat 
Bourque.[1] For the next four seasons, Ford was a regular in the Twins' 
lineup. In his second season, he hit the first home run at the rebuilt 
Yankee Stadium on April 15, 1976.[2] On August 10, 1979, Ford hit for the 
cycle for the Angels against the Seattle Mariners. On December 4, 1978, 
Ford was traded to the Angels for Danny Goodwin and Ron Jackson.[1] Three 
seasons later, he was traded to the Orioles for Doug DeCinces and Jeff 
Schneider. The Orioles had tried to trade for Ford previously, but were 
unable to after the Angels originally picked him up.[3] Early in the Orioles' 
1983 championship season, on May 19, Ford had homered in the eighth inning 
at Baltimore against Richard Dotson, as the only hit in a 1-0 defeat of 
the Chicago White Sox, whom the Orioles would eventually face in the 1983 
American League Championship Series.[4] Ford later hit a home run off Philadelphia 
Phillies' Steve Carlton for the Orioles in Game 3 of the 1983 World Series.
