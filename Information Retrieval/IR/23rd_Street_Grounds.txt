23rd Street Grounds, also known as State Street Grounds and 23rd Street 
Park, and sometimes spelled out as Twenty-third Street Grounds, was a ballpark 
in Chicago. In it, the Chicago White Stockings played baseball from 1874 
to 1877, the first two years in the National Association and the latter 
two in the National League. 23rd Street first hosted baseball in 1872â€“1873,

fire, it did not field a team). Seven games were even relocated to Chicago 
by professional teams in other major cities. The Cleveland and Troy clubs 
played two and four home games here, respectively, in 1872, when they were 
struggling economically (both went out of business). The Boston Red Stockings 
played one in 1873 when they were flourishing. The grounds was on a block 
bounded by 23rd Street, State Street, 22nd Street (now Cermak Road) and 
what is now Federal Street. No illustration is known to survive, but contemporary 
newspaper descriptions imply that the diamond was in the north end of the 
block; a line drawn from home plate through the pitcher's mound and second

J. Lowry's book on American baseball venues. The final game played at this 
park was on Saturday, October 6th, 1877. Chicago defeated Louisville 4-0 
behind a shutout effort from hurler Laurie Reis. The final home run at
