The 1999 Major League Baseball season ended with the New York Yankees defeating 
the Atlanta Braves in Game 4 of the World Series. The previous record of 
most home runs hit in a season, set at 5,064 in 1998,[1] was broken once 
again as the American League and National League combined to hit 5,528 
home runs.[2] Moreover, it was the first season in 61 years to feature 
a team that scored 1,000 runs in a season, as the Cleveland Indians led 
the Majors with 1,009 runs scored.[3] Only 193 shutouts were recorded in 
2,427 regular-season games.[4] 1American League Triple Crown Pitching Winner
