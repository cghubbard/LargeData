The 21st century is the current century of the Anno Domini era or the Common 
Era, in accordance with the Gregorian calendar. It began on January 1, 
2001 and will end on December 31, 2100.[1][2] It is the first century of 
the 3rd millennium. It is distinct from the time span known as the 2000s, 
which began on January 1, 2000 and will end on December 31, 2099. The first 
years of the 21st century have thus far been marked by the rise of a global 
economy and Third World consumerism, mistrust in government, deepening 
global concern over terrorism and an increase in the power of private enterprise.[3][4][5] 
The long term effects of increased globalization are not known, but there 
are many who are concerned about its implications.[6] The Arab Spring of 
the early 2010s led to mixed outcomes in the Arab world.[7] The Digital 
Revolution which began around the 1980s also continues into the present.[8] 
The Millennials (born c. 1981-2000), having been born before the turn of 
the century, give way to the rise of Generation Y & Generation Z in Western 
countries.[9] In contemporary history, the 21st century essentially began 
in 1991 (the end of Short Twentieth Century) with the United States as 
the sole superpower in the absence of the Soviet Union, while China began 
its rise and the BRICS countries aimed to create more balance in the global 
political and economic spectrum.[10][11] The completion of the Human Genome 
Project in 2003 marks the continual rise of life sciences, making mankind's 
long-held dreams, such as curing cancer, more realistic.[12] By the 2010s, 
gene therapy, first performed somatically in late 1990 and heritably in 
1996, showed promise but remains an experimental and emerging technology. 
Assistive reproductive technology developed in the 1980s, such as polar 
body biopsy and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, has allowed for the 
selection of genetic traits, and, along with the advent of ultrasound, 
has increased the number of boys and decreased the number of girls in many 
countries, most notably in China and India but also in other Asian and 
eastern Europe countries.[13] This began in the late 1980s in China and 
India and after the fall of communism in the Balkans and Caucasus regions, 
concurrent with both the advent of capitalism in those countries and the 
widespread availability of reproductive technology.[13] While digital telecommunications 
technology became widely used by most of the world, concerns about stress 
from the overuse of mobile phones, the Internet, and related technologies 
remain controversial.[14] By 2013, about 80% of the world's population 
used mobile phones.[15] An estimated 33% owned personal computers in 2010,[16] 
and 46% used the Internet by 2016, compared to about 1% in 1996.[17] The 
distribution of modern technology is not equal - in 2012 it was estimated 
that 1.5 billion people, or about 20% of the world's population still lacked 
access to electric power, with many more having only intermittent or poor 
access.[18] The International Energy Agency estimates that 83% of the global 
population has access to electricity as of 2013 with the percentage projected 
to increase to 88% by 2030.[19][20] There is a debate among experts and 
the general public on how to pronounce specific years of the 21st century 
in English. Regarding this, academics suggested that since former years 
such as 1805 and 1905 were commonly pronounced as "eighteen oh" or "nineteen 
oh" five, the year 2005 should naturally have been pronounced as "twenty 
oh-five".[22] A less common variation would have been "twenty nought-five". 
Generally, the early years of the 21st century were pronounced as "two-thousand 
(and) five", with a change taking place in 2010, where pronunciations often 
shift between the early-year standard of "two-thousand and ten" and the 
common approach used in the late 20th century of "twenty-ten". The Vancouver 
Olympics, which took place in 2010, was being officially referred to by 
Vancouver 2010 as "the twenty-ten Olympics". The latest timeframes for 
change are usually placed at 2020.[22] According to The Stanley Kubrick 
Archives, in the press release for his film 2001: A Space Odyssey, film 
director Stanley Kubrick included specific instructions for journalists 
to refer to the movie as "two thousand and one" instead of the commonplace 
pronunciation of "twenty-oh-one". Kubrick said he did this in the hope 
that if the film became popular, it would influence the pronunciation of 
that year.[23] Genocide still remains a problem in this century with the 
concern of the war in Darfur and the growing concern in Sri Lanka. Low 
estimates on the deaths in Darfur stand around 200,000 deaths with 2.5 
million in displacement, there has been much outcry against the perpetrators, 
the Sudanese government, and the very weak international response. Also 
controversies from past genocides remain commonplace in the minds of victims 
and average people alike. Some territories have gained independence during 
the 21st century. This is a list of sovereign states that have gained independence 
in the 21st century and have been recognized by the UN. These territories 
have declared independence and secured relative autonomy but they have 
only been recognized by some UN member states: These territories were annexed 
from a sovereign country, the action have only been recognized by some 
UN member states: As the century began, the generations which had experienced 
the crises of the mid and late 20th century (the Great Depression, World 
War II and the Cold War) as adults, were retiring from leadership positions 
and public life. Taking their places were members of the postwar "Boom" 
generations, whose formative experiences were the social upheavals (and, 
in the Western world, relative prosperity) of the 1960s and 1970s.[citation

of AIDS made the disease less of a deadly threat to those with access to 
treatment. A cure was still not found in the '00s despite expectations.[citation

legal in some countries. In 2001 the Netherlands became the first nation 
in the world to legalize this type of marriage. The 2000s decade saw significant 
change surrounding this social issue and the change has continued into 
the 2010s.[citation needed] By 2001 most Western countries had removed 
the remaining racial language in their laws.[citation needed] As of 2009, 
SIL Ethnologue catalogued 6,909 living human languages.[31] The exact number 
of known living languages will vary from 5,000 to 10,000, depending generally 
on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular on 
how one classifies dialects. Estimates vary depending on many factors but 
the general consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages 
currently spoken, and that between 50-90% of those will have become extinct 
by the year 2100.[32] The top 20 languages spoken by more than 50 million 
speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many 
of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with 
fewer than 10,000 speakers.[32] The Oxford Hair Foundation has predicted 
that people with the red hair gene will be either extremely rare or extinct 
by the year 2100. The University of Rochester Medical Center's David Pearce 
claims that people with the red hair gene constitute about 4 percent of 
6.4 billion people in the world and therefore disputes the claim.[33] 2000s 
2010s At the start of the 21st century sports were very popular. The IOC's 
Modern Olympic Games was the most viewed sporting event. Association football 
is the most popular sport worldwide with the FIFA World Cup the most viewed 
football event. Other sports such as rugby, cricket, baseball, basketball, 
ice hockey, tennis, and golf were popular globally. In cricket the emergence 
of the Twenty20 format as well as the creation of the Indian Premier League 
led to changes in the nature of the sport. American swimmer Michael Phelps 
won an Olympic record setting 8 Gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

during the 21st century had evolved from the same types of entertainment 
which emerged around the middle of the 20th century. Sports, films, music, 
TV series' and books remained popular into the early 21st century but new 
forms of entertainment including social networking and internet accessed 
videos became popular. Video games had emerged from a childhood pastime 
in the late 20th century to an fully grown adult pastime by the beginning 
of the 21st century. The most popular mediums of entertainment in the first 
decade at least were via televisions, the internet, CDs, DVDs and paper. 
Digital information begins to complete its succession over analog information 
and storage techniques. . There are several points-of-view pertaining to 
the following items, all of which should be considered accordingly. Issues 
that have been frequently discussed and debated so far in this century 
include: The United Nations lists global issues on its agenda and lists 
a set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to attempt to address some
