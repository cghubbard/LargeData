As player As coach David "Dave" Martinez (born September 26, 1964) is an 
American professional baseball coach and former outfielder. He is the bench 
coach for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in 
MLB for the Cubs, Montreal Expos, Cincinnati Reds, San Francisco Giants, 
Chicago White Sox, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Texas Rangers, Toronto Blue Jays, 
and Atlanta Braves from 1986 to 2001. Martinez had a .276 career batting 
average, 1,599 hits, 91 home runs, 795 runs scored, and 580 runs batted 
in. Martinez became the bench coach for the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008, during 
which time he became a candidate for several managerial positions in MLB. 
After Rays' manager Joe Maddon became manager of the Cubs after the 2014 
season, Martinez joined the Cubs as their bench coach. Martinez was born 
in Brooklyn, New York, to Puerto Rican parents.[1] He lived at East 93rd 
Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. At age 13, his family moved to 
Orlando, Florida, on the recommendation of an uncle.[1][2] Martinez attended 
Lake Howell High School in Winter Park, Florida. He played on the school's 
baseball team, which won the Five Star Conference championship in 1981.[2] 
He then enrolled at Valencia Community College, where he played college 
baseball.[3] The Chicago Cubs selected Martinez in the January phase of 
the 1983 Major League Baseball draft.[4][5] After he signed, he played 
for the Geneva Cubs of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League[6] 
and the Quad Cities Cubs of the Class A Midwest League.[7] He began the 
1984 season with Quad Cities,[8] and in 1985, he received a promotion to 
the Winston-Salem Spirits of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League.[9] Martinez 
led the Carolina League with a .342 batting average; the second-place finishers, 
Keith Miller and John Wilson, batted .302.[10] Martinez began the 1986 
season with the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA American Association.[11] The 
Cubs promoted Martinez to the major leagues for the first time on June 
15, 1986,[12] and he served as an injury replacement for Bob Dernier.[13] 
He had a .119 batting average (8-for-67) before he was optioned back to 
the minor leagues in August.[14] Martinez made the Cubs major league roster 
in 1987,[15] splitting time in center field with Dernier.[16] He batted 
.292 in 142 games.[17] Martinez struggled in the 1988 season, batting .230 
in mid-June.[18] On July 14, 1988, Martinez was traded to the Montreal 
Expos in exchange for Mitch Webster.[19][20] He finished 1988 with a .255 
batting average and 23 stolen bases.[21] Martinez was pegged as a platoon 
player in Montreal, as he batted against right-handed pitchers and sat 
against left-handed pitchers. The Expos also had outfielders Otis Nixon, 
Marquis Grissom and Larry Walker on their roster.[2] He played 126 games 
in 1989, hitting .274.[21] In 1990, Martinez lost the competition for the 
center field job to Grissom. However, Grissom was injured,[22] and Martinez 
platooned with Nixon in center field. Martinez batted .279 with 11 home 
runs in 118 games in 1990.[23] He batted .295 in 1991.[24] After the 1991 
season, the Expos traded Martinez with Willie Greene and Scott Ruskin to 
the Cincinnati Reds for Bill Risley and John Wetteland. He was sought out 
as a replacement for Eric Davis for the Reds.[24] He competed with Reggie 
Sanders for the starting job during spring training.[25][26] Martinez played 
for Cincinnati in 1992, but as Sanders established himself as the Reds' 
starting center fielder, Martinez declared for free agency after the season. 
He signed with the San Francisco Giants on a two-year contract for the 
1993 and 1994 seasons. He suffered a torn hamstring in 1993[27] and was 
limited to 91 games. He hit .241, his lowest average in several seasons.[21] 
The Giants waived Martinez in October 1994 after he was held to a .247 
average, 4 home runs and 27 runs batted in (RBI).[28] Martinez signed a 
one-year, $500,000 contract with the Chicago White Sox for the 1995 season. 
He received limited playing time under manager Gene Lamont. When Lamont 
was replaced by Terry Bevington, Martinez saw an increase in playing time.[29] 
He signed a two-year $1.425 million contract for the 1996 and 1997 seasons.[30] 
He spent the 1996 season as a backup behind Darren Lewis, Tony Phillips, 
and Danny Tartabull, along with fellow backup Lyle Mouton.[31] In 1997, 
Martinez batted, .286 and set career highs with 12 home runs and 55 RBI. 
He then signed a two-year contract with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays 
worth $3.5 million with an option for a third season at $1.75 million.[32][33][34] 
In addition his desire to play in Florida, he was enticed by the Rays' 
additions of Fred McGriff, Wilson Álvarez, and Roberto Hernández.[2] In 
1998, he recorded the first hit in Tampa history.[5] His contract option 
for the 2000 season vested when he recorded his 500th at bat of the 1999 
season.[35] After batting .260 in his first 29 games of the 2000 season, 
the Devil Rays, who needed to improve their pitching staff, traded Martinez 
to the Cubs for Mark Guthrie and cash.[36] On June 9, 2000, the Cubs traded 
Martinez to the Texas Rangers in a three team trade that sent Chuck Smith 
from the Florida Marlins to the Rangers and Brant Brown from the Marlins 
to the Cubs.[37] On August 4, 2000, the Rangers traded Martinez to the 
Toronto Blue Jays for a player to be named later.[38][39] The Blue Jays 
sent Peter Munro to the Rangers to complete the trade.[40] By playing for 
four MLB teams in one season, Martinez tied the record. Since 1901, the 
previous players to play for four MLB teams in a season were Frank Huelsman 
(1904), Willis Hudlin (1940), Paul Lehner (1951), Wes Covington (1961), 
Mike Kilkenny (1972), and Dave Kingman (1977). Dan Miceli (2003) and José 
Bautista (2004) later achieved the feat.[41] With Toronto, he filled in 
for the injured Raúl Mondesí as the Blue Jays contended for the American 
League wild card.[42] Between the four teams, he had a .274 batting average, 
five home runs, and 47 runs batted in (RBIs) in 132 games.[43] Martinez 
signed with the Atlanta Braves on a two-year contract covering the 2001 
and 2002 seasons, valued at approximately $3 million.[44] He batted .328 
in the first half of the 2001 season, but only .233 in the second half. 
Late in the year, he was diagnosed with chronic tendinitis in the patella. 
He appeared in the MLB postseason for the only time in his career, as he 
played in the 2001 National League Division Series, as the Braves defeated 
the Houston Astros, and the 2001 National League Championship Series, where 
the Braves lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Martinez returned to the Braves 
in 2002, but missed the entire season after he injured his right knee during 
spring training.[45] He announced his retirement. In 1,919 games played, 
Martinez had a .276 career batting average, 1,599 hits, 91 home runs, 795 
runs scored, and 580 RBI.[46] Martinez worked for the Tampa Bay Rays as 
a spring training instructor in 2006 and 2007.[4][47][48] On October 11, 
2007, he was hired by the Tampa Bay Rays to be their bench coach. As the 
Rays' bench coach, Martinez was in charge of defensive positioning, and 
worked with the Rays' players on bunting and baserunning.[5] Martinez interviewed 
for managerial positions with Toronto in the 2010 offseason[49] and the 
Cleveland Indians.[5] During the 2011 offseason, Martinez interviewed for 
White Sox' managerial position.[50][51] The White Sox hired Robin Ventura. 
After the 2012 season, Martinez was considered for the Astros' managerial 
position, which went to Bo Porter.[52] During the 2013 offseason, Martinez 
interviewed for Cubs' managerial position,[53] which went to Rick Renteria, 
and the Washington Nationals' managerial position,[54] which went to Matt 
Williams. Rays' manager Joe Maddon opted out of his contract with Tampa 
Bay after the 2014 season. The Rays sought feedback from their players 
on who should manage the team. Evan Longoria, Alex Cobb, and Ben Zobrist 
endorsed Martinez.[55] Martinez interviewed for the position, but was not 
among the Rays' three finalists.[56] Martinez announced his intention to 
leave the Rays.[57] On December 4, he was hired to serve as the bench coach 
for the Cubs under Maddon.[58] In 2016, Martinez was part of the Cubs' 
coaching staff that led the team to winning the 2016 World Series, breaking 
a 108-year long drought.[59] Martinez resides in Safety Harbor, Florida, 
a suburb of Tampa Bay,[2] with his wife, Lisa, and their four children: 
David, Jagger, Dalton, and Angelica.[38][60] Lisa is originally from Chicago; 
they met while Martinez was in his first stint with the Cubs.[61] Jagger 
attended the University of Tampa, where he played for the school's soccer
