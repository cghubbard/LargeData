The 1924 Philadelphia Phillies season saw the Phillies climb out of last 
place and into seventh and home attendance improving to over 299,000. Cy 
Williams led the team in home runs with 24. On August 21, 1924, the Phillies 
were traveling from games in St. Louis to Cincinnati when the Baltimore 
and Ohio Railroad train on which they were traveling turned over in the 
train yards in Mitchell, Indiana. Phillies players and personnel were unharmed 
but the engineer and fireman were killed in the accident.[2] In the season's 
final series against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, Phillies 
shortstop Heinie Sand was offered $500 by Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell 
to throw the games. The Giants were battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn 
Robins. Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art 
Fletcher. It eventually led to the life-time suspension of O'Connell and 
Giants coach Cozy Dolan by Commissioner Landis, although future-Hall of 
Famers Frankie Frisch, George Kelly, and Ross Youngs were also implicated.[3]
