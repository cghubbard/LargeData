Carthage College is a four-year private liberal arts college affiliated 
with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Situated in Kenosha, Wisconsin 
midway between Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the campus is 
an 80-acre arboretum on the shore of Lake Michigan and is home to 2,600 
full-time and 400 part-time students. Carthage awards bachelor's degrees 
with majors in more than 40 subject areas, as well as the Master of Education 
degree. The Carthage faculty comprises nearly 150 scholars, 90 percent 
of whom hold the doctorate or other terminal degree.[2] Gregory S. Woodward 
is the president of Carthage, the 22nd in its history. Carthage College 
was founded in 1847 by Lutheran pioneers in education in the small town 
of Hillsboro, Illinois as The Literary and Theological Institute of the 
Lutheran Church in the Far West. The name was soon shortened to Hillsboro 
College. With a two-person faculty and 79 students, Hillsboro promised 
“a course of study designed to be thorough and practical, and to embrace 
all the branches of learning, usually pursued in the best academies and 
colleges.”[3] In 1852, the college moved to Springfield, Illinois and assumed 
the name of Illinois State University.[4] During this period, Abraham Lincoln 
served briefly on the Board of Trustees from 1860 to 1861,[5] while his 
son Robert Todd Lincoln was a student in Illinois State University’s preparatory 
department from 1853 to 1859.[6] Illinois State University’s enrollment 
dwindled during the Civil War, and in 1870 the college moved again, this 
time to the rural, west-central city of Carthage, Illinois, where the college 
acquired its current name.[7] The Great Depression and World War II lowered 
enrollment to 131 students in 1943,[8] but enrollment increased again after 
the war as a result of the G.I. Bill. After years of financial challenges, 
shifts in Lutheran synodical support, and searches for a suitable location, 
Carthage’s Board of Trustees voted unanimously in 1957 to open a campus 
in Kenosha, Wisconsin.[9] The lakeshore campus was dedicated on Oct. 14, 
1962.[10] By 1962, the college launched an era of growth. The next decade 
brought a period of continuous expansion. Enrollment increased fivefold, 
endowment tripled, and physical assets increased 600 percent. In Fall 1995, 
Carthage enrolled 1,527 full-time students, setting a new record. Intensive 
national searches have built a teaching-oriented faculty holding Ph.D.s 
from major graduate programs across the country. Since 2001, the College 
has invested more than $130 million in new construction, major renovations 
and technological acquisition. In 2001, the Hedberg Library opened its 
doors, adjoining the H.F. Johnson Center for the Fine Arts.[11] The library 
won Wisconsin Library of the Year in 2004.[12] The library also won the 
Highsmith Award in 2007 for Family Fun Night, a program for community members 
that encourages learning for children from 2-13.[13] The former Ruthrauff 
Library was renovated into the A. W. Clausen Center for World Business, 
opening in 2004. The Tarble Athletic and Recreation Center opened in 2001, 
and the former Physical Education Center was rebuilt and renamed the Tarble 
Arena, opening in 2009. In Fall 2011, a new student union opened on the 
site of the former W. F. Seidemann Natatorium. It houses a new press box, 
new bleachers, a new and larger bookstore, new dining options, a campus 
"living room", a new dining room, a 200-seat theatre, an art gallery, and 
a gaming area. In April 2012 the student center was formally dedicated 
and named the Campbell Student Union in honor of retiring President F. 
Gregory Campbell and his wife, Barbara, for their 25 years of service to 
Carthage. President Campbell retired in August 2012. The Oaks, a new student 
residence village overlooking Lake Michigan, opened in 2012, containing 
six villas with semi-private suites and a media lounge on each floor. In 
Fall 2015, a new science center opened in the newly renovated David A. 
Straz Jr. Center for the Natural and Social Sciences.[14][15] Originally 
built in 1962, the former Science Hall was renovated and renamed in honor 
of David A. Straz, Jr., in 1995.[16] The latest $45 million expansion added 
a new planetarium, twelve new science labs, new classrooms, faculty offices, 
and student gathering and exhibition spaces. Carthage offers a Bachelor 
of Arts in more than 40 areas of study and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing.[17] 
Carthage also partners with master’s level institutions to offer dual-degree 
programs in engineering, occupational therapy and pharmacy. The academic 
calendar spans two 14-week semesters, separated by a month-long January 
term. The college has been accredited by the North Central Association 
of Colleges and Schools since 1916.[18] In fall 2014, Carthage had enrollment 
of 2,856 undergraduate students and 92 graduate students. The student body 
is 54 percent female and 46 percent male.[19] All Carthage students are 
required to take Western Heritage, a year-long course sequence in which 
they read, discuss, and write about major Western texts. The reading list 
includes works by Plato, Thomas Jefferson, and W.E.B. DuBois, in addition 
to the Bible.[20] All students must complete a senior thesis. This capstone 
project can take the form of a research project, music recital, art exhibit, 
or some other original demonstration of scholarship or creativity.[21] 
During January Term, known on campus as “J-Term,” participating students 
select one class and attend it daily. In addition to on-campus courses, 
many students travel with faculty on study tours in either January or the 
summer months. Destinations in 2016 included Cuba, Nicaragua, and World 
War II battle sites in Europe. All students must complete two J-Term courses, 
including one during their freshman year.[22] The Institute for International 
Education placed Carthage no. 4 among baccalaureate institutions for student 
participation in short-term study abroad in 2013-14.[23] In The Princeton 
Review's 2016 rankings, Carthage was among 159 schools listed as a Best 
Midwestern College.[24] From 2008 through 2016, 17 students from the college 
won Fulbright fellowships.[25] In 2016, the college was named a top Fulbright 
producer.[26] The college has a student-to-faculty ratio of 13 to 1. In 
fall 2014, the college employed 157 full-time professors and 167 part-time 
faculty members.[27] In 2014, the college launched the Carthage in Chicago 
program. Participating students spend a semester in Chicago, securing an 
internship or pursuing a major academic project while living and taking 
classes in the city. Housing and classroom space are located at HI-Chicago.[28] 
Adult students can pursue a bachelor's degree in accounting, criminal justice, 
management, or marketing. Classes meet one evening per week for seven weeks.[29] 
Available graduate degrees include the Master of Education, with 13 areas 
of concentration, and a Master of Social Work offered at Carthage in partnership 
with Loyola University Chicago.[30] For decades, the Old Main Bell sat 
in the tower at the top of Old Main, the first building on the campus in 
Carthage, Illinois. After athletic victories, students would race down 
Evergreen Walk to ring the bell. When Carthage moved from Illinois to Wisconsin 
in the 1960s, the Tau Sigma Chi fraternity helped move the victory bell 
to Kenosha.[31] In 2004, the victory bell found a new home in the scoreboard 
on Art Keller Field.[32] Kissing Rock has been a part of Carthage since 
1913. Dennis Swaney and other members of the Class of 1913 found the 2 
½-ton chunk of granite in a farmer’s field and moved the stone to the campus.[33] 
Stationed prominently at the entrance to Evergreen Walk, the rock quickly 
became part of Carthage life.[34] One tradition recounts that any woman 
sitting on the rock was obligated to kiss the man who found her there and 
countless marriage proposals have been made and accepted near it. Members 
of the Beta Phi Epsilon fraternity moved Kissing Rock to the Kenosha campus 
in the mid-1960s.[35] It now sits facing Lake Michigan between Lentz and 
Tarble Halls. Today, Kissing Rock is a multifaceted symbol of the Carthage 
spirit. Students paint the Rock to promote their organizations and causes, 
publicize upcoming events, and celebrate. Kissing Rock has served as a 
memorial to beloved alumni, an expression of protest against injustice, 
a tribute after 9/11, and more.[36] The Christmas Festival has been a part 
of Carthage’s holiday season since 1974.[37] Every year at the start of 
December, Carthage hosts a musical celebration of the birth of Christ for 
the community. The event highlights student vocal and instrumental ensembles, 
as well as performances by students in Carthage’s Theatre Department.[38] 
Carthage claims a long-standing commitment to educating the whole person 
by nourishing the intellectual, spiritual, emotional, social, and physical 
dimensions of students' lives. The College's stated mission is to offer: 
Carthage offers 24 NCAA Division III sports. About a third of Carthage 
students are involved in varsity intercollegiate athletics, and another 
third participate in the many intramural and club sports offered. Club 
sports include men's bowling, women's bowling and co-ed ice hockey. The 
men's baseball team has averaged over 35 wins per season from 1990 to 2010, 
with an overall record of 702-237.[39] They have been invited to the NCAA 
Division III World Series several times, finishing third in 2009. Since 
1990, Carthage has claimed eight outright CCIW divisional titles, one divisional-title 
tie, nine conference crowns, 16 NCAA regional berths, including nine-straight 
from 1992 to 2000, six regional titles, third-place finishes in both the 
1993 and 1994 NCAA Division III baseball championships and fourth place 
in both 1995 and 1997. For his efforts, Coach Augie Schmidt has been named 
American Baseball Coaches Association/Diamond Sports NCAA Division III 
Central Regional "Coach Of The Year" nine times (1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 
1997, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2009), won the ABCA/Louisville Slugger Conference 
Award seven times from 1993 to 1999, and has been named CCIW "Baseball 
Coach of the Year" on 10 occasions (1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1999, 
2002, 2003, 2007 and 2009). In 2004, the Redmen football team set a school 
record for most wins in a season, going 11-2.[40] That season was also 
the first time the Redmen made the NCAA Division III playoffs since the 
school joined the NCAA in 1976. Carthage went on to win their first two 
games of the playoffs defeating Alma College and Wooster College. The Redmen 
then lost to Division III powerhouse Mount Union College.[41] The Redmen 
finished the 2004 season ranked 5th in the nation.[42] Mike Yeager became 
the head coach beginning with the 2012 season.[43] In 2005, the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that Carthage, along with 
several other colleges, would be ineligible to host NCAA-sanctioned playoffs 
and tournaments because their nickname, "Redmen", was perceived as an offensive 
reference to Native Americans. A decision was made to rename the Carthage 
men's teams the "Red Men". This is in accordance with the circa 1920 origin 
of the name—the team's red uniform jersey—while removing any possible controversial 
connotations.[44] In conjunction with the rearticulation of the name, a 
new logo for the team replaced the traditional feathered Carthage C. It 
includes a torch, a shield, and a C. Carthage College was a member of the 
Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1912 to 1941. After competing 
as an independent for five years, the school became a founding member of 
the College Conference of Illinois, now known as the College Conference 
of Illinois and Wisconsin, in 1946, a membership it has maintained to this 
time. In men's volleyball, Carthage became a founding member of the single-sport 
Continental Volleyball Conference (CVC) in 2011. In 2014, the CVC amicably 
split along regional lines, with Carthage and the CVC's other Midwestern 
members forming the Midwest Collegiate Volleyball League. In women's water 
polo, Carthage is a member of the single-sport Collegiate Water Polo Association 
(CWPA) Division III Conference since the team's inception in 2010. Carthage 
has had 22 presidents since its founding. Coordinates: 42°37′25″N 87°49′12″W﻿
