Columbia /kəˈlʌmbiə/ is a city in and the county seat of Boone County, 
Missouri, United States.[9] Founded in 1820 as the county seat and home 
to the University of Missouri, it had a 2015 estimated population of 119,108, 
and it is the principal city of the Columbia Metropolitan Area, the state's 
fourth most populous metropolitan area. As a midwestern college town, the 
city has a reputation for progressive politics, public art, and powerful 
journalism. The tripartite establishment of Stephens College (1833), the 
University of Missouri (1839), and Columbia College (1851) has long made 
the city a center of education, culture, and athletic competition. These 
three schools surround Downtown Columbia on the east, south, and north; 
at the center is the Avenue of the Columns, which connects Francis Quadrangle 
and Jesse Hall to the Boone County Courthouse and the City Hall. Originally 
an agricultural town, the cultivation of the mind is Columbia's chief economic 
concern today. Never a major center of manufacturing, the city also depends 
on healthcare, insurance, and technology businesses. Several companies, 
such as Shelter Insurance, Carfax, and Slackers CDs and Games, were founded 
in the city. Cultural institutions include the State Historical Society 
of Missouri, the Museum of Art and Archaeology, and the annual True/False 
Film Festival. The Missouri Tigers, the state's only major athletic program, 
play football at Faurot Field and basketball at Mizzou Arena as members 
of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The city is built upon the forested 
hills and rolling prairies of Mid-Missouri, near the Missouri River valley, 
where the Ozark Mountains begin to transform into plains and savanna; limestone 
forms bluffs and glades while rain carves caves and springs which water 
the Hinkson, Roche Perche, and Petite Bonne Femme creeks. Surrounding the 
city, Rock Bridge Memorial State Park, Mark Twain National Forest, and 
Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge all form a greenbelt preserving 
sensitive and rare environments. The first humans were nomadic hunters 
who entered the area at least twelve thousand years ago. Later, woodland 
tribes lived in villages along waterways and built mounds in high places. 
The Osage and Missouria nations were expelled by the exploration of French 
traders and the rapid settlement of American pioneers. The latter arrived 
by the Boone's Lick Trail and hailed from the slave-owning culture of the 
Upland South, especially Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, giving Boonslick 
the name "Little Dixie" during the American Civil War. German, Irish, and 
other European immigrants soon joined. The modern populace is unusually 
diverse, over eight percent foreign-born. While White and Black remain 
the largest ethnicities, Asians are now the third-largest group. Today's 
Columbians are remarkably highly educated and culturally midwestern,[citation 
needed] though traces of their Southern past remain. The city has been 
called the "Athens of Missouri" or a reference to its classic beauty and 
educational emphasis, but is more commonly called "CoMo". The Columbia 
area was once part of the Mississippian culture and home to the Mound Builders. 
When European explorers arrived, the area was populated by the Osage and 
Missouri Indians.[7] In 1678, La Salle claimed all of Missouri for France. 
The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed by the area on the Missouri River 
in early June 1804. In 1806, two sons of Daniel Boone established a salt 
lick 40 miles (64 km) northwest of Columbia. giving the area its early 
name: Boonslick. The Boone's Lick Trail wound from St. Charles to the lick 
in present-day Howard County. In 1818, a group of settlers, incorporated 
under the Smithton Land Company, purchased over 2,000 acres (8.1 km2) and 
established the village of Smithton less than a mile from current day downtown 
Columbia.[10] In 1821, the settlers moved, because of lack of water, across 
the Flat Branch to the plateau between the Flat Branch and Hinkson creeks 
in what is now the downtown district. They renamed the settlement Columbia—a 
poetic personification of the United States.[7] The roots of Columbia's 
three economic foundations—education, medicine, and insurance—can be traced 
back to incorporation in 1821.[10][11] Original plans for the town set 
aside land for a state university. In 1833, Columbia Baptist Female College 
opened, which later became Stephens College. Columbia College (distinct 
from today's), later to become the University of Missouri, was founded 
in 1839. When the state legislature decided to establish a state university, 
Columbia raised three times as much money as any other competing city[12] 
and James S. Rollins donated the land that is today the Francis Quadrangle.[12] 
Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia such as Christian 
Female College, the first college for women west of the Mississippi, which 
later became the current Columbia College. The city benefited from being 
a stagecoach stop of the Santa Fe and Oregon trails, and later from the 
Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. In 1822 the first hospital was set up by 
William Jewell. In 1830, the first newspaper began; in 1832, the first 
theater in the state was opened; and in 1835, the state's first agricultural 
fair was held. By 1839, the population (13,000) and wealth of Boone County 
was exceeded in Missouri only by that of St. Louis County, which at that 
time included the City of St. Louis.[13] Columbia's infrastructure was 
relatively untouched by the Civil War. Missouri, as a slave state, had 
Southern sympathies, but remained in the Union. The majority of the city 
was pro-Union,[10] however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone 
County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. 
Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union 
troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence 
of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though 
several major battles occurred nearby at Boonville and Centralia. After 
the Civil War, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern; 
a black man, George Burke, was lynched in 1889.[14] In 1963, Columbia become 
home to the headquarters of both the University of Missouri System, which 
today serves over 71,000 students,[15] and the Columbia College system, 
which today serves about 25,000 students.[16] The insurance industry also 
became important to the local economy as several companies established 
headquarters in Columbia, including Shelter Insurance, Missouri Employers 
Mutual, and Columbia Insurance Group. State Farm Insurance has a regional 
office in Columbia. In addition, the now defunct Silvey Insurance was once 
a large local employer. Columbia became a transportation crossroads when 
U.S. Route 63 and U.S. Route 40 (which became present-day Interstate 70) 
were routed through the city. Soon after the city opened the Columbia Regional 
Airport. The latter 20th century saw tremendous growth, and by 2000 the 
population was nearly 85,000 in the city proper.[8] In early 2006, Columbia 
embarked on a plan[17] to manage the continued growth as the city passed 
100,000 population. The city continues to grow, especially east around 
the newly opened Battle High School. The downtown district has maintained 
its status as a cultural center and is undergoing significant development 
in both residential and commercial sectors.[18] The University of Missouri, 
which has tremendous economic impact on the city, experienced record enrollment 
in 2006[19] and is undertaking significant construction. Columbia, located 
in northern mid-Missouri, is 120 miles (190 km) away from both St. Louis 
and Kansas City, and 29 miles (47 km) north of the state capital Jefferson 
City.[20] The city is near the Missouri River[21] between the Ozark Plateau 
and the Northern Plains.[22] Trees are mainly oak, maple, and hickory;[23] 
common understory trees include eastern redbud, serviceberry, and flowering 
dogwood. Riparian areas are forested with mainly American sycamore. Much 
of the residential area of the city is planted with large native shade 
trees. In Autumn, the changing color of the trees is notable. Most species 
here are typical of the Eastern Woodland. According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 63.5 square miles (164.46 km2), 
of which, 63.08 square miles (163.38 km2) is land and 0.42 square miles 
(1.09 km2) is water.[24] The city generally slopes from the highest point 
in the Northeast to the lowest point in the Southwest towards the Missouri 
River. Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, 
and Flat Branch Creek. Along these and other creeks in the area can be 
found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in Rock Bridge 
State Park just south of the city. These creeks are largely responsible 
for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to the 
Ozarks while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri. 
Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout 
town. Large mammals found in the city includes urbanized coyotes[25] and 
numerous whitetail deer.[26] Eastern gray squirrel,[27] and other rodents 
are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum[28] 
and raccoon. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the Canada 
goose, mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the great egret and 
great blue heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally 
be seen on the MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found 
by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating 
birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern 
U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North 
America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas 
of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife. 
Frogs are commonly found in the springtime, especially after extensive 
wet periods. Common species include the American toad and species of chorus 
frogs, commonly called "spring peepers" that are found in nearly every 
pond. Some years have outbreaks of cicadas or ladybugs. Mosquitos and houseflies 
are common insect nuisances; because of this, windows are nearly universally 
fitted with screens, and "screened-in" porches are common in homes of the 
area. Columbia has a climate marked by sharp seasonal contrasts in temperature, 
falling between a humid continental and humid subtropical climate (Köppen 
Dfa/Cfa, respectively), and is located in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 6a.[29] 
The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 29.7 °F (−1.3 °C) in 
January to 77.3 °F (25.2 °C) in July, while the high reaches or exceeds 
90 °F (32 °C) on an average 32 days per year, 100 °F (38 °C) on 2.0 days, 
while 4.0 nights of sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows can be expected.[30] Precipitation 
tends to be greatest and most frequent in the latter half of spring, when 
severe weather is also most common. Snow averages 18.0 inches (46 cm) per 
season, mostly from December to March, with occasional November accumulation 
and falls in April being rarer; historically seasonal snow accumulation 
has ranged from 3.4 in (8.6 cm) in 2005–06 to 54.9 in (139 cm) in 1977–78.[30] 
Extreme temperatures have ranged from −26 °F (−32 °C) on February 12, 1899 
to 113 °F (45 °C) on July 12 and 14, 1954. Readings of −10 °F (−23 °C) 
or 105 °F (41 °C) are uncommon, the last occurrences being January 7, 2014 
and July 31, 2012.[30] Columbia's most commonly recognizable architectural 
attributes reside downtown and within the university campuses. Widely used 
icons of the city are the University of Missouri's Jesse Hall and the neo-gothic 
Memorial Union. The David R. Francis Quadrangle is an example of Thomas 
Jefferson's academic village concept. There are four historic districts 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places within the city: Downtown 
Columbia, East Campus Neighborhood, Francis Quadrangle, and North Ninth 
Street Historic District.[34] The downtown skyline is relatively low and 
is dominated by the 10-story Tiger Hotel, and the 15-story Paquin Tower. 
Downtown Columbia is an area of approximately one square mile surrounded 
by the University of Missouri on the south, Stephens College to the east 
and Columbia College on the north. The area serves as Columbia's financial 
and business district and is the topic of a large initiative to draw tourism, 
which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture, 
and Bohemian characteristics.[35] The city's historic residential core 
lies in a ring around downtown, extending especially to the west along 
Broadway, and south into the East Campus neighborhoods. The city government 
recognizes 63 neighborhood associations.[36] The city's most dense commercial 
areas are primarily located along Interstate 70, U.S. Route 63, Stadium 
Boulevard, Grindstone Parkway, and the downtown area. As of the census[5] 
of 2010, there were 108,500 people, 43,065 households, and 21,418 families 
residing in the city. The population density was 1,720.0 inhabitants per

18 living with them, 38.2% were married couples living together, 10.3% 
had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.7% were non-families. 
33.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.5% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.26 and the average family size was 2.92.[39] In the city the population 
was spread out with 19.7% under the age of 18, 26.7% from 18 to 24, 28.7% 
from 25 to 44, 16.2% from 45 to 64, and 8.6% who were 65 years of age or 
older. The median age was 27 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.8

$26,694 for females. The per capita income for the city was $19,507. About 
9.4% of families and 19.2% of the population were below the poverty line, 
including 14.8% of those under age 18 and 5.2% of those age 65 or over.[39] 
Columbia's economy is historically dominated by education, healthcare, 
and the insurance industry.[10] Jobs in government are also common, either 
in Columbia or a half-hour south in Jefferson City.[40] Commutes into the 
city are also common and in 2000, the city had a day time population of 
106,487—a 26% increase over the census population of the same year.[41] 
The Columbia Regional Airport and the Missouri River Port of Rocheport 
connect the region with trade and transportation. The University of Missouri 
is by far the city's largest employer.[40] The economy of Columbia's metro 
area is slightly larger than that of the Bahamas.[42] With a Gross Metropolitan 
Product of $5.84 billion in 2004, Columbia's economy makes up 2.9% of the 
Gross State Product of Missouri.[43] Insurance corporations headquartered 
in Columbia include Shelter Insurance, and the Columbia Insurance Group. 
Other organizations include MFA Incorporated, the Missouri State High School 
Activities Association, and MFA Oil. Companies such as Socket, Datastorm 
Technologies, Inc. (no longer existent), Slackers CDs and Games, Carfax,[44] 
and MBS Textbook Exchange were founded in Columbia. According to Columbia's 
2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[45][46] the top employers in 
the city are: The Missouri Theatre Center for the Arts and Jesse Auditorium 
are Columbia's largest fine arts venues. Ragtag Cinema annually hosts the 
well-known True/False Film Festival. In 2008, filmmaker Todd Sklar completed 
Box Elder, which was filmed entirely in and around Columbia and the University 
of Missouri. The University of Missouri's Museum of Art and Archaeology 
displays 14,000 works of art and archaeological objects in five galleries 
for no charge to the public.[47] Libraries include the Columbia Public 
Library, the University of Missouri Libraries, with over three million 
volumes in Ellis Library, and the State Historical Society of Missouri. 
The "We Always Swing" Jazz Series[48] and the Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival[49] 
bring some of the country's finest Jazz and Blues to Columbia and Central 
Missouri. One of the last remaining traditional arcades in the country, 
Gunther's Games,[50] is a popular destination for gamers. Columbia has 
a flourishing and progressive music scene thanks in large part to many 
acts that come out of the university.[51] The indie band White Rabbits 
was formed while the members were students at the University of Missouri 
before moving to Brooklyn to record and gain a higher profile.[52] Musical 
artists from Columbia have been compiled by Painfully Midwestern Records 
with the ComoMusic Anthology series, and the "Das Kompilation" release. 
Although the hip genre continues to give Columbia some music recognition, 
it is their progressive psychedelic-heavy metal music scene that has garnered 
some attention lately. There are also local punk and hip-hop scenes that 
are gaining momentum locally. Country music singer-songwriter Brett James 
is also a native of Columbia.[53] The song "Whiskey Bottle," by Uncle Tupelo, 
is rumored to be about the city of Columbia as it makes specific reference 
to a sign which used to be displayed on a Columbia tackle shop sign which 
read, "Liquor, Guns, and Ammo." The sign is now displayed at the downtown 
location of Shakespeare's Pizza. The University of Missouri's sports teams, 
the Missouri Tigers, play a significant role in the city's sports culture. 
Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium capacity 71,168, is host to both home 
football games and concerts. The Hearnes Center and Mizzou Arena are two 
other large sport and event venues, the latter being the home arena for 
Mizzou's basketball team. Taylor Stadium is host to their baseball team 
and was the regional host for the 2007 NCAA Baseball Championship.[54] 
Columbia College has several men and women collegiate sports teams as well. 
In 2007, Columbia hosted the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics 
Volleyball National Championship, which the Lady Cougars participated in.[55] 
Columbia also hosts the Show-Me State Games, a non-profit program of the 
Missouri Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Health. They are the 
largest state games in the United States.[56][57] These games consist of 
26—28,000 Missouri amateur athletes (35,000 total[57]) of all ages and 
ability levels who compete in the Olympic-style sports festival during 
July and August every year. It recently made ESPN's list of "101 Things 
All Sports Fans Must Experience Before They Die".[58] Situated midway between 
St. Louis and Kansas City, Columbians will often have allegiances to the 
professional sports teams housed there, such as the St. Louis Cardinals, 
the Kansas City Royals, the Kansas City Chiefs, and the St. Louis Blues.[59] 
The NRA Bianchi Cup is held in Columbia every year. It is among the most 
lucrative of all the shooting sports championships. The city has two daily 
newspapers: the Columbia Missourian in the morning and the Columbia Daily 
Tribune in the afternoon. The Missourian is directed by professional editors 
and staffed by Missouri School of Journalism students who do reporting, 
design, copy editing, information graphics, photography and multimedia. 
The Missourian publishes the weekly city magazine, Vox.[60] With a daily 
circulation of nearly 20,000, the Daily Tribune is the most widely read 
newspaper in central Missouri. The University of Missouri has the independent 
but official student newspaper called The Maneater, which is printed bi-weekly. 
The now-defunct Prysms Weekly was also published in Columbia. In Fall 2009, 
KCOU News launched full operations out of KCOU 88.1 FM on the MU Campus. 
The entirely student-run news organization airs a daily newscast, "The 
Pulse", weekdays from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. The city has 14 radio stations 
and 4 television channels.[61] The City of Columbia's current government 
was established by a home rule charter adopted by voters on November 11, 
1974, which established a Council-manager government that invested power 
in the City Council. The City Council is made up of seven members – six 
elected by each of Columbia's six wards, plus an at-large council member, 
the Mayor, who is elected by all city voters. The mayor currently receives 
a $9,000 annual stipend and the six remaining council members receive a 
$6,000 annual stipend. They are elected to staggered three-year terms. 
The Mayor, in addition to being a voting member of the City Council, is 
recognized as the head of city government for ceremonial purposes. Chief 
executive authority is invested in a city manager, who oversees the day-to-day 
operations of government.[62] Columbia is the county seat of Boone County, 
and the county court and government center are located there. The city 
is located in Missouri's 4th congressional district. The 19th Missouri 
State Senate district covers all of Boone County. There are five Missouri 
House of Representatives districts (9, 21, 23, 24, 25) in the city. Columbia 
is home to a plethora of attorneys and serves as a legal hub and testing 
grounds for many new laws and grassroot efforts. The principal law enforcement 
agency is the Columbia Police Department, with the Columbia Fire Department 
providing fire protection. The University of Missouri Police Department 
patrols areas on and around the MU campus and has jurisdiction throughout 
the city and Boone County. The Public Service Joint Communications Center 
coordinates efforts between the two organizations as well as the Boone 
County Fire Protection District which operates Urban Search and Rescue 
Missouri Task Force 1. The population generally supports progressive causes 
such as the extensive city recycling programs and the decriminalization 
of cannabis[63][64] both for medical and recreational use at the municipal 
level (though the scope of latter of the two cannabis ordinances has since 
been restricted).[65] The city is also one of only four in the state to 
offer medical benefits to same-sex partners of city employees.[66] The 
new health plan also extends health benefits to unmarried heterosexual 
domestic partners of city employees. On October 10, 2006, the City Council 
approved an ordinance to prohibit smoking in public places, including restaurants 
and bars. The ordinance was passed with protest, and several amendments 
to the ordinance reflect this.[67] Today's Columbians are unusually highly 
educated; over half of citizens possess at least a bachelor's degree,[68] 
while over a quarter hold a graduate degree,[69] making it the thirteenth 
most highly educated municipality in the United States.[69] Columbia and 
much of the surrounding area lies within The Columbia Public School District. 
The district enrolls over 17,000 students[70] and had a revenue of nearly 
$200 million for the 2007–2008 school year.[71] It is above the state average 
in attendance percentage and in graduation rate.[72] The city operates 
four public high schools which cover grades 9–12: David H. Hickman High 
School, Rock Bridge High School, Muriel Battle High School, and Frederick 
Douglass High School. Rock Bridge is one of two Missouri high schools to 
receive a silver medal by U.S. News & World Report, putting it in the top 
3% of all high schools in the nation.[73] Hickman has been on Newsweek 
magazine's list of top 1,300 schools in the country for the past three 
years and has more named presidential scholars than any other public high 
school in the United States.[73] There are also several private high schools 
including: Christian Fellowship School, Columbia Independent School, Heritage 
Academy, Christian Chapel Academy, and the newly constructed Father Augustine 
Tolton Regional Catholic High School.[74] The city has three institutions 
of higher education: the University of Missouri, Stephens College, and 
Columbia College all of which surround Downtown Columbia. The city is the 
headquarters of the University of Missouri System, which also operates 
campuses in St. Louis, Kansas City, and Rolla. The University of Missouri 
was founded in 1839 as the first state university west of the Mississippi 
River. Stephens College prepares students to become leaders and innovators 
in a rapidly changing world, and engages lifelong learners in an educational 
experience characterized by intellectual rigor, creative expression and 
professional practice as well as offering innovative, career-focused programs 
sound in the liberal arts with focuses on creative arts and sciences. Columbia 
College offers day and evening classes on its Columbia Campus, extension 
courses through its 34 nationwide campuses, and ties with U.S. military 
bases (including Guantanamo Bay, Cuba), and online courses.[75] The Columbia 
Transit provides public bus and para-transit service, and is owned and 
operated by the city. In 2008, 1,414,400 passengers boarded along the system's 
six fixed routes and nine University of Missouri shuttle routes, and 27,000 
boarded the Para-transit service.[76] The system is constantly experiencing 
growth in service and technology. A $3.5 million[77] project to renovate 
and expand the Wabash Station, a rail depot built in 1910 and converted 
into the city's transit center in the mid-1980s, was completed in summer 
of 2007.[78] In 2007, a Transit Master Plan was created to address the 
future transit needs of the city and county with a comprehensive plan to 
add infrastructure in three key phases.[79] The five to 15-year plan intends 
to add service along the southwest, southeast and northeast sections of 
Columbia and develop alternative transportation models for Boone County. 
Fares are $1.50 for adults, and $.75 for children 5–11, for students with 
valid I.D, for handicapped/Medicare recipients, and for senior citizens 
age 65 and up. Columbia Transit offers FASTPass electronic fare cards and 
issues electronic transfers for accuracy and convenience. Para-transit 
fares are $2.00 for a one-way trip, and the service area includes all of 
Columbia. Buses operate Monday through Saturday, from 6:25am to 6:25pm 
Monday-Wednesday, 6:25am to 10:25pm Thursday and Friday, and from 1:00am 
to 7:30pm on Saturday. Buses do not operate on Sunday. The city's former 
mayor, Darwin Hindman, is largely in favor of a non-motorized transportation 
system,[80] and can often be seen riding his bicycle around the city.[81] 
Columbia is also known for its MKT Trail, a spur of the Katy Trail State 
Park, which allows foot and bike traffic across the city, and, conceivably, 
the state. It consists of a soft gravel surface, excellent for running 
and biking. Columbia also is preparing to embark on construction of several 
new bike paths and street bike lanes thanks to a $25 million grant from 
the federal government.[82] The city is also served by American Airlines 
at the Columbia Regional Airport, the only commercial airport in mid-Missouri. 
I-70 (concurrent with US 40) and US 63 are the two main freeways used for 
travel to and from Columbia. Within the city, there are also three state 
highways: Routes 763 (Rangeline St & College Ave), 163 (Providence Rd), 
and 740 (Stadium Blvd). Rail service is provided by the city-owned Columbia 
Terminal (COLT) Railroad, which runs from the north side of Columbia to 
Centralia and a connection to the Norfolk Southern Railway. Health care
