Cedric Montgomery Durst (August 23, 1896 – February 16, 1971) was an outfielder 
in Major League Baseball who played between 1922 and 1930 for the St. Louis 
Browns (1922–23, 1926), New York Yankees (1927–30) and Boston Red Sox (1930). 
Listed at 5' 11", 160 lb., Durst batted and threw left-handed. He was born 
in Austin, Texas. Though he was always regarded as a fine defensive player, 
Durst was a weak hitter almost every year in his major league career. He 
played in parts of three seasons with the Browns before joining the Yankees. 
While in New York, Durst was a member of the 1927 and 1928 World Champion 
Yankees, playing exclusively as a reserve outfielder for Earle Combs (CF), 
Bob Meusel (LF) and Babe Ruth (RF). During the 1930 midseason, he was sent 
by New York to the Red Sox in exchange for Red Ruffing.[1] The 1930 season 
proved to be Durst's last year in the majors.[2] In a seven-season career, 
Durst was a .244 hitter (269-for-1103) with 15 home runs and 122 RBI in 
481 games, including 146 runs, 39 doubles, 17 triples, and seven stolen 
bases. In five postseason games, he hit .333 (3-for-9) with one home run, 
two RBI and three runs. After his major league career was over, Durst played 
and managed in the minor leagues for two more decades. After drawing his 
release from the Red Sox, he played regularly for the St. Paul Saints (American 
Association) in 1931 and 1932, and with the Hollywood Stars and San Diego 
Padres in the Pacific Coast League for six more seasons. The best of his 
PCL seasons was 1933, when he played 180 games for Hollywood, batting .318 
with 14 home runs. During the 1936 season at San Diego, his roommate was 
future superstar Ted Williams. Durst managed the Padres from 1939 to 1943.[3][4] 
After leaving baseball, Durst worked as a guard at Convair aircraft in 
San Diego, eventually becoming chief of Convair's police force.[4] Cedric
