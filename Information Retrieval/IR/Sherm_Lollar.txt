John Sherman Lollar, Jr., (August 23, 1924 – September 24, 1977) was an 
American Major League Baseball (MLB) catcher and coach.[1] He played a 
total of 18 seasons for the Cleveland Indians (1946), New York Yankees 
(1947–1948), St. Louis Browns (1949–1951), and the Chicago White Sox (1952–1963).[1] 
Although Lollar was often overshadowed by his contemporary, New York Yankees 
catcher Yogi Berra, he was considered to be one of the best catchers in 
the major leagues during the 1950s.[2][3] Lollar was an American League 
All-Star for seven seasons. In 1957, he received the first Rawlings Gold 
Glove Award for the catcher position in Major League Baseball. He was a 
coach in the major leagues and managed at the minor league level after 
his MLB playing career ended. He was selected to be a member of the Chicago 
White Sox All-Century Team on September 30, 2000.[4] Lollar was born in 
Durham, Arkansas in the rural Ozark mountains.[1] He was a batboy for the 
Fayetteville, Arkansas Class D minor league team in the Arkansas–Missouri 
League in the 1930s.[2] In 1943 Lollar was signed as an 18-year-old by 
the Baltimore Orioles, which then was a minor league franchise in the International 
League.[5][6] In 1945 he hit 34 home runs and led the International League 
with a .364 batting average, winning the league's Most Valuable Player 
award.[2][7] Baltimore had a working agreement with the Cleveland Indians 
and sold Lollar to the Indians after the 1945 season. Lollar made his major 
league debut on April 20, 1946. He was a backup catcher for the Cleveland 
Indians behind catchers Frankie Hayes and then Jim Hegan. He asked to be 
sent back to the minor league and his wish was granted.[2] He was traded 
to the New York Yankees after the 1946 season, and competed with Yogi Berra 
in 1947 for the Yankees catcher position.[6] Both Lollar and Berra were 
considered excellent hitting prospects but defensive liabilities, although 
both eventually would become outstanding receivers. He started two games 
in the 1947 World Series for the Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers and 
went 3 for 4 with two doubles.[8] Yankee coach and Hall of Fame catching 
great, Bill Dickey, advised the Yankees that Berra's left-hand bat was 
more suited to the dimensions of Yankee Stadium (301'-457'-461'-407'-296' 
LF-LCF-CF-RCF-RF) than Lollar's right-hand bat. During the 1948 season, 
he received a hand injury due to a foul tip, resulting in limited action 
for the rest of the 1948 season. He was traded to the St. Louis Browns 
and replaced Les Moss as their starting catcher for the 1949 season.[2][6] 
In 1950, Lollar was hitting .314 in mid-July and earned his first of seven 
All-Star selections (9 games).[9][10] He ended the season hitting .280 
with a career-high .391 on-base percentage.[1] In 1951, he hit .252 for 
the season and was traded in November to the White Sox. In 1952, Lollar 
took over the season's regular catching job for the White Sox from cather 
Phil Masi.[6] His defensive skills improved under the tutelage of manager 
and former major league catcher Paul Richards.[11] Lollar, whom Richards 
called "a manager on the field", was a quiet workhorse who led by example 
and was an excellent handler of pitchers.[3][12] In 1954, after allowing 
a stolen base to Al Smith on May 25, he threw out all 18 would-be base 
stealers during the remainder of the year. He became a mainstay behind 
the plate for the Go-Go White Sox teams of the 1950s and early 1960s, which 
included future Hall of Fame members Luis Aparicio, Nellie Fox, George 
Kell, Hoyt Wilhelm, and Early Wynn. Described as a dangerous hitter with 
power in Who's Who in Baseball History,[13] Lollar played most of his career 
in cavernous Comiskey Park, whose dimensions were 352'-415'-352' LF-CF-RF. 
He tied a major League record on April 23, 1955 when he got hits twice 
in two different innings of the same game.[14][15] Lollar never struck 
out more than 50 times in a season and walked more than he struck out in 
each of the 15 seasons he played after becoming an every day player.[16] 
His career on-base percentage was higher than Berra's (.357 versus .348).[17] 
He hit a career-high .293 with 28 doubles in 1956. The White Sox finished 
in third place for five consecutive seasons until 1957, when the Sox held 
first place until late June, before finishing the season in second place 
behind the Yankees.[3][18] Lollar won the first Gold Glove Award for catcher 
in 1957, which initially had one recipient per position for both leagues.[19] 
That year he caught Bob Keegan's no-hitter on August 20.[20] In 1958, the 
White Sox would battle back from being in last place on June 14 to once 
again finish the season in second place behind the Yankees.[21] Lollar 
led the team with 20 home runs and 84 runs batted in.[22] In 1959, the 
White Sox won their first American League pennant since the Black Sox scandal 
in 1919, finishing the regular season five games ahead of the Cleveland 
Indians.[23] Lollar helped guide the White Sox pitching staff to the lowest 
earned run average in the American League.[24] He also led the team once 
again with a career-high 22 home runs and 84 runs batted in and winning 
his third consecutive Gold Glove Award.[1][19] He had 5 hits and 5 runs 
batted in, including a home run, in the 1959 World Series, as the White 
Sox were defeated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in a six-game series.[25] 
Lollar remained the White Sox starting catcher through the 1962 season. 
In 1962, he fractured his thumb on June 20 when he was hit by a pitch by 
Ted Sadowski of the Minnesota Twins. He did not return until July 25, and 
appeared in only 84 total games during the season. Lollar retired from 
playing at the end of the 1963 season at the age of 38.[1] In The Case 
for Those Overlooked by the Baseball Hall of Fame, published in 1992, Lollar 
was named as one of 32 former major league players considered worthy of 
Hall of Fame consideration. Seven of the book's players have since been 
enshrined in the Hall of Fame: Richie Ashburn, Orlando Cepeda, Larry Doby, 
Nellie Fox, Bill Mazeroski, Hal Newhouser, and Ron Santo.[26] Lollar is 
one of 36 catchers who are portrayed in Thomas Owens’ Great Catchers.[27] 
Golden Era (1947–1972) Lollar is currently eligible to be identified as 
a Golden Era ballot candidate in November 2017 by the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America's-appointed Historical Overview Committee (screening 
committee of 10-12 BBWAA members). If he gets on the Golden Era ballot 
list of 10 candidates, he's eligible for consideration for election to 
the Hall of Fame in December 2017 by the 16-member Golden Era Committee, 
under the Hall of Fame's, Golden Era rules for election for players.[28] 
In an eighteen-year major league career, Lollar played in 1,752 games, 
accumulating 1,415 hits in 5,351 at bats for a .264 career batting average 
along with 155 home runs, 808 runs batted in and a .357 on-base percentage.[1] 
A seven-time All-Star, Lollar led American League catchers in fielding 
percentage four times over his career.[29] In 1961, he committed only one 
error over the entire season.[1] At the time of his retirement in 1963, 
Lollar's .992 career fielding percentage was the highest for a catcher 
in major league history.[30] During his career, Lollar threw out 46.18% 
of the base runners who tried steal a base on him, ranking him 5th on the 
all-time list.[31] He caught 110 shutouts during his career, ranking him 
21st all-time among major league catchers.[32] At the time of his retirement, 
he ranked 9th all-time in home runs by catchers.[33] Lollar was hired as 
the bullpen coach for the Baltimore Orioles on November 27, 1963.[34] He 
remained in that capacity through the 1966 World Series Championship season 
and up until the announcement on September 28, 1967 that he would not be 
retained for the 1968 season.[35] He subsequently was a coach for the Oakland 
Athletics in 1969 and managed the Athletics' minor league affiliates the 
Iowa Oaks and the Tucson Toros in the 1970s.[36] Lollar eventually was 
the proprietor of a bowling alley in Springfield, Missouri, where he died
