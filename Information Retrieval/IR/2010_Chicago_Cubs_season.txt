The 2010 Chicago Cubs season was the 139th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 135th in the National League and the 95th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished fifth in the National League Central with a record of 75â€“87. In 
December 2009, Florida Governor Charlie Crist met with Cubs president Crane 
Kenney, chairman Tom Ricketts and other team officials about possibly moving 
the Cubs' spring training and minor league facilities from Mesa to Naples.[1] 
In January 2010, however, the city of Mesa approved an agreement that would 
have the Cubs remain in that city for spring training through 2035, with 
the city building a new $84 million stadium and training facility. The 
agreement would take effect pending financing legislation and subsequent 
voter referendum in November 2010.[2] Infielders Outfielders Coaching Staff
