Joseph Benjamin Pignatano (born August 4, 1929), nicknamed "Piggy", is 
a retired American professional baseball player and coach. The former catcher 
appeared in 307 games played in the Major Leagues during all or part of 
six seasons (1957–62) for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers (1957–60), 
Kansas City Athletics (1961), San Francisco Giants (1962) and New York 
Mets (1962). He threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) 
tall and weighed 180 pounds (82 kg). He is a native and lifelong resident 
of Brooklyn, New York. He signed with his hometown Dodgers in 1948, and 
spent almost seven full seasons (interrupted by two years of military service) 
in their farm system before three brief auditions with the 1957 big-league 
team. On Tuesday, September 24, 1957, Pignatano was behind the plate during 
the final five innings of the Brooklyn Dodgers' last home game, played 
at Ebbets Field against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He relieved starting catcher 
(and future Baseball Hall of Famer) Roy Campanella in the top of the fifth 
inning with the Dodgers leading 2–0 and helped guide pitcher Danny McDevitt 
to a complete game shutout victory.[1] The Dodgers played their final three 
games in 1957 on the road against the Philadelphia Phillies, then moved 
to Los Angeles during the off-season. In January 1958, Campanella was tragically 
paralyzed in a car accident, and John Roseboro succeeded him as the Dodgers' 
starting catcher. Pignatano was Roseboro's backup in both 1958–59 and the 
third-string Dodger receiver in 1960. He hit a career-high nine home runs 
in 1958 and played a key role in the Dodgers' late-season 1959 pennant 
drive, which ended in a flat-footed tie between the Dodgers and Milwaukee 
Braves. In the flag-clinching Game 2 of the National League playoff series, 
Pignatano entered the contest as a pinch runner for Norm Larker in the 
ninth inning, then took over as catcher in the tenth, replacing Roseboro. 
In the 12th, with two out and Gil Hodges on base, Pignatano singled off 
Bob Rush to keep the inning alive and send Hodges to second. The next hitter, 
Carl Furillo, delivered the game- and pennant-winning run on an infield 
hit and an error by Braves' shortstop Félix Mantilla.[2] Pignatano then 
appeared in one inning as a defensive replacement (in Game 5) of the 1959 
World Series[3] and earned a world championship ring when the Dodgers prevailed 
over the Chicago White Sox in six games. Pignatano was a semi-regular for 
the 1961 Athletics, splitting the catching duties with Haywood Sullivan, 
but offensive struggles limited his MLB playing time. He hit above .240 
only once (with the 1961 A's) and batted .234 lifetime with 161 hits, 25 
doubles, four triples and 16 home runs. His career OPS was .683. In his 
last MLB at bat, for the 1962 Mets on September 30, he bounced into a 4–3–6 
triple play.[4][5] After his 15-year professional playing career ended 
in 1964, Pignatano was a coach for the Washington Senators (1965–67), New 
York Mets (1968–81) and Atlanta Braves (1982–84), working under Hodges 
from 1965–71 and earning a second World Series ring with the 1969 "Miracle 
Mets." During his years as the Mets' bullpen coach, Pignatano cultivated 
a vegetable garden in the bullpen.[6] He's also related to two other former
