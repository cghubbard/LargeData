The Cincinnati Reds were leading the National League Central division by 
a half game before a strike ended the 1994 Major League Baseball season. 
By Friday, August 12, the Reds had compiled a 66-48 record through 114 
games (although they had actually played 115 games, since their April 6 
game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Riverfront Stadium ended after 
the top of the 6th inning due to poor weather[6]). They were leading the 
NL Central Division by just half a game over the Houston Astros. Prior 
to the Strike, they had scored 609 runs (5.30 per game) and had allowed 
490 runs (4.26 per game).[7] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G
