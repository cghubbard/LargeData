are a minor league baseball team of the Midwest League, and the Class A 
affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. The team is located in Appleton, Wisconsin, 
and are named for the timber rattlesnake, which is indigenous to the area.[2] 
The team plays its home games at Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities 
Stadium, which opened in 1995 and seats 5,170 fans (plus grass seating).[3] 
The Timber Rattlers have won nine league championships, most recently in 
2012. World Series-winning Managers Earl Weaver and Jack McKeon were Managers 
at Appleton. Baseball Hall of Fame members Pat Gillick, Earl Weaver, and 
Goose Gossage played for Appleton. Five future Cy Young Award winners and 
three Most Valuable Player recipients were on Appleton/Wisconsin rosters.[4] 
The team began play as the Appleton Foxes in the Three-I League in 1958, 
five years after Appleton's previous minor league franchise, the Papermakers, 
folded along with the rest of the Wisconsin State League. The Papermakers 
had played in the Wisconsin–Illinois League (1909–1914) before starting 
the franchise again decades later in the Wisconsin State League (1940–1953). 
The Foxes joined the Midwest League (MWL) in 1962 after the Three-I League 
disbanded, and continue play in the MWL today.[4] The Foxes played at Appleton's 
Goodland Field and League Park before moving to their current home at Fox 
Cities Stadium, a larger, more modern ballpark on Appleton's northwest 
side in the town of Grand Chute. With the move, the Foxes took the new 
name of Wisconsin Timber Rattlers in an effort to attract fans outside 
the immediate Appleton/Fox Cities area. The franchise set its all-time 
attendance record of 253,240 in 2009, the first year of their affiliation 
with the Milwaukee Brewers.[3] The Timber Rattlers are a non-stock club 
governed by Appleton Baseball Club, Inc., which is community-owned.[3] 
Appleton Baseball Club has a 12-person board of directors.[3] It has 168 active 
shareholders and 347 shares as of September 2008.[3] Three Timber Rattlers 
franchise alumni have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: [5]
