Yutaka Enatsu (江夏 豊, Enatsu Yutaka?, born May 15, 1948 in Nara Prefecture, 
raised in Amagasaki, Hyōgo Prefecture) is a former Japanese pitcher regarded 
as one of the best Japanese strikeout pitchers of all-time. In 1968, he 
recorded 401 strikeouts, which is still the world record. Enatsu was a 
bit player in the Black Mist Scandal which embroiled Japanese baseball 
from 1969–1971. In November 1970 he received a stern warning from the Central 
League president due to "involvement with persons in baseball gambling." 
He recorded 9 consecutive strikeouts in one of the 1971 All-Star games,[1][2] 
and 15 consecutive strikeouts in three of the All-Star games between 1970 
and 1971. His consecutive strikeouts were broken up by Katsuya Nomura. 
The two records are still unbroken. A starting pitcher for the first part 
of his career, in 1977 he became a relief specialist, altogether accumulating 
193 saves. While playing with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in 1979, Enatsu was 
the Central League MVP, as he compiled a 9-5 record with a 2.67 ERA and 
117 strikeouts in 104-2/3 innings. That year the Carp won the Central League 
pennant and the Japan Series. In 1981, now with the Nippon Ham Fighters, 
Enatsu was the Pacific League MVP, garnering 25 saves and a 2.82 ERA, as 
the Fighters won the Pacific League pennant. In 1985, he attempted to play 
in Major League Baseball, but generated little interest because at 36 years 
old, he was near the end of his career. Enatsu is a major shadow-figure 
in Yoko Ogawa's novel The Housekeeper and the Professor (Hakase no ai shita
