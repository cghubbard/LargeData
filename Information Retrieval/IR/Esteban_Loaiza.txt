Esteban Antonio Loaiza [lo-EYE-sa] (born December 31, 1971) is a Mexican 
semi-retired baseball pitcher. He played for several teams and was the 
American League's starting pitcher in the 70th anniversary 2003 All-Star 
Game in Chicago. At a press conference in April 2016 Esteban Loaiza released 
to return to baseball in the Semi-Professional League Clemente Grijalva,in 
State of Sinaloa in Mexico leaving so his retirement, his debut will be 
in the team also former MLB RHP Luis Ayala in the team "Academy Chikote 
Ayala" He married Jenni Rivera in 2010, and made several appearances on 
her family's reality television show, I Love Jenni. In October 2012, Rivera 
filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences". On December 9, 
2012, Rivera died in a plane crash before the divorce was finalized. A 
graduate of Mar Vista High School in Imperial Beach, California, Loaiza 
was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an undrafted free agent on March 
21, 1991. With the Gulf Coast Pirates in the Rookie leagues he started 
five games in 1991, finishing with a 5–1 record and a 2.26 ERA. He moved 
through the Pirates farm system with stops at Augusta (class A – 1992), 
Salem (class A – 1993) and Carolina (class AA – 1993-1994). He also played 
for the Mexico City Red Devils of the Mexican Summer League during the 
1993 season. He has played with the Mexicali Aguilas of the Liga Mexicana 
Del Pacifico. Loaiza moved to a big league club in 1995, making his major 
league debut on April 29, 1995, for the Pirates against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. He worked 4 2⁄3 innings in the game, giving up five hits and 
one unearned run to achieve the first major league win of his career. He 
finished his rookie season with an 8–9 record and a 5.16 ERA in 31 starts. 
He began the 1996 season back in the minors with the Triple-A Calgary Cannons, 
but was recalled to the majors on June 7. The Pirates traded him to the 
Texas Rangers on July 17, 1998, for Todd Van Poppel and Warren Morris. 
He spent the next two seasons with Texas, pitching both as a starter and 
a reliever for the Rangers. Traded again, to the Toronto Blue Jays by the 
Rangers on July 19, 2000 for Michael Young and Darwin Cubillán, he pitched 
with the Blue Jays through 2002. After signing with the Chicago White Sox 
as a free agent, Loaiza enjoyed a career season in 2003, leading American 
League pitchers in strikeouts (207), and was second in wins (21) and strikeouts 
per nine innings (8.23); third in ERA (2.90), and sixth in innings pitched 
(226.3). Considered for the Cy Young Award, Loaiza finished second behind 
Roy Halladay, ahead of Pedro Martínez and Tim Hudson. He was an All-Star 
selection both in 2003 and 2004. Loaiza's 21 wins in 2003 are tied for 
the most ever in a season for a Mexican pitcher; Fernando Valenzuela won 
21 games in 1986. In 2004, Loaiza was elected to the All-Star game as a 
member of the White Sox. Soon after his appearance in the All-Star game, 
he was traded to the New York Yankees mid-season for José Contreras.[1][2] 
He did not perform well in New York and was moved to the bullpen during 
the regular season. During the ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, he pitched 
well in two relief outings despite recording the loss in Game 5. Following 
the 2004 season, he signed a one-year deal with the Washington Nationals 
as a free agent. He went 12–10 with a 3.77 ERA for the Nationals in 2005. 
Just prior to the 2006 season, Loaiza signed a three-year, $21.4 million 
contract with the Oakland Athletics.[3] He had a disastrous start to his 
Oakland career, which led many fans to question his acquisition. Loaiza 
went 0–3 in April with an 8.35 ERA and opponents batted .385 against him. 
His early season troubles reached a nadir on April 29 when he gave up 10 
runs in two innings to the Kansas City Royals, who had the worst record 
in baseball at the time; the game was not official since it was later rained 
out, or his statistics would have been even worse. Loaiza's poor performance 
was at least partly due to injury, as he seemed to have very little velocity 
on his fastball early in the season (throwing it at as little as 82–83 mph)[4] 
and was placed on the disabled list with back and shoulder problems on 
May 2. When he returned on June 8, he was inconsistent, but appeared to 
be much healthier, due to his ability to demonstrate a much harder 95 mph 
fastball.[5] On June 25, 2006, Loaiza pitched his first complete game in 
over two years in a 10–4 victory over the San Francisco Giants. Loaiza 
finished the 2006 regular season with a 4.89 ERA and a record of 11 wins 
and 9 losses.[6] His injuries may have played a role in his sub-par ERA 
for that season. During the 2007 regular season, Loaiza spent a large amount 
of time on the disabled list due to spasms in his right trapezius. The 
A's activated him and moved him back to the 25-man roster on August 22, 
2007. On August 29, 2007, the Los Angeles Dodgers claimed Loaiza off waivers 
from the Athletics. Instead of trading for Loaiza, the Dodgers purchased 
the remainder of his contract.[7] He made an impressive debut for the Dodgers, 
working seven innings and getting the win in an 11–4 victory over the Chicago 
Cubs, but struggled during the rest of the season, losing his last four 
decisions. Going into the 2008 season, he had fully recovered from his 
injuries and regained his spot as the fifth starter in the Dodgers rotation. 
Loaiza struggled at the beginning of the season, and as a result lost his 
starting position to lefty Hong-Chih Kuo. After a stint on the DL, Loaiza 
was designated for assignment on May 24 and subsequently released. On June 
4, 2008, Loaiza was signed by the Chicago White Sox.[8] After 3 relief 
appearances and 6 weeks on the disabled list, he was released.[9] On June 
14, 2006, Loaiza was arrested after being pulled over by police who clocked 
his Ferrari at 120 mph on a California freeway near San Lorenzo. He subsequently 
failed a sobriety test. He appeared in court on July 14, 2006. After the 
incident, GM Billy Beane banned alcohol in both the home and visitor clubhouse, 
citing liability issues.[10] Loaiza was married to Mexican-American singer 
Jenni Rivera. The divorce papers were filed on Monday, October 1, 2012. 
The statement, released by Rivera's representatives, stated that the divorce 
was due to "irreconcilable differences on behalf of both parties derived 
from private circumstances that occurred during the lapse of their two-year 
marriage." Rivera died on December 9, 2012 when her private plane crashed,
