Charles Arthur "Dazzy" Vance (March 4, 1891 – February 16, 1961) was an 
American professional baseball player.[1] He played as a pitcher for five 
different franchises in Major League Baseball (MLB) in a career that spanned 
twenty years. Known for his impressive fastball, Vance was the only pitcher 
to lead the National League in strikeouts seven consecutive seasons.[2] 
He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.[2] Born in Orient, 
Iowa, Vance spent most of his childhood in Nebraska. He played semipro 
baseball there, then signed on with a minor league baseball team out of 
Red Cloud, Nebraska, a member of the Nebraska State League, in 1912. After 
pitching for two other Nebraska State League teams in 1913 and 1914, Vance 
made a brief major league debut with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1915 and 
appeared with the New York Yankees that year as well.[3] However, it took 
several years before he established himself as a major league player.[4] 
Vance was discovered to have an arm injury in 1916 and was given medical 
treatment. He continued to work on his pitching in the minor leagues, appearing 
with teams in Columbus, Ohio; Toledo, Ohio; Memphis, Tennessee; Rochester, 
New York; and Sacramento, California. He only reappeared in the major leagues 
once for the Yankees, pitching two games in 1918. Vance said that he was 
suddenly able to throw hard again in 1921 while pitching for a team in 
New Orleans, Louisiana; he struck out 163 batters and finished the season 
with a 21-11 win-loss record.[3] His contract was purchased by the Brooklyn 
Robins from the New Orleans Pelicans in 1922.[5] The Robins wanted to acquire 
catcher Hank DeBerry, but the Pelicans refused to complete the deal unless 
Vance was included in the transaction.[4][5] DeBerry became Vance's personal 
catcher during his tenure with Brooklyn.[6] In 1922, Vance produced an 
18–12 record with a 3.70 earned run average (ERA) and a league-leading 
134 strikeouts.[1] His best individual season came in 1924, when he led 
the National League in wins (28), strikeouts (262) and ERA (2.16) (see 
Triple Crown) en route to winning the National League Most Valuable Player 
Award.[1] He set the then-National League record for strikeouts in a nine-inning 
game when he fanned 15 Chicago Cubs in a game on August 23, 1924.[7] (He 
struck-out 17 batters in a 10-inning game in 1925.) On September 24, 1924, 
Vance struck out three batters on nine pitches in the second inning of 
a 6–5 win over the Chicago Cubs. Vance became the fifth National League 
pitcher and the seventh pitcher in MLB history to accomplish the nine-strike/three-strikeout 
half-inning. He finished the season with 262 strikeouts, more than any 
two National League pitchers combined (Burleigh Grimes with 135 and Dolf 
Luque with 86 were second and third respectively). That season, Vance had 
one out of every 13 strikeouts in the entire National League. Vance pitched 
a no-hitter in 1925. Vance was involved in one of the most famous flubs 
in baseball history, the "three men on third" incident during the 1926 
season. With Vance on second and Chick Fewster on first, Babe Herman hit 
a long ball and began racing around the bases. As Herman rounded second, 
the third base coach yelled at him to go back, since Fewster had not yet 
passed third. Vance, having rounded third, misunderstood and reversed course, 
returning to third. Fewster arrived at third. Herman ignored the instruction 
and also arrived at third. The third baseman tagged out Herman and Fewster; 
Vance was declared safe by rule.[8] Vance's play began to decline in the 
early 1930s and he bounced to the St. Louis Cardinals (becoming a member 
of the team known as the Gashouse Gang), Cincinnati Reds and back to the 
Dodgers. Commenting for a 1934 newspaper article, Vance said that he did 
not recommend baseball as a career to young men. He pointed out that very 
few people could make a good living out of a baseball career, especially 
during a time when increasing major league salaries were attracting many 
college-educated men who would have previously chosen other work.[9] He 
retired after the 1935 season. Vance led the league in ERA three times, 
wins twice, and established a National League record by leading the league 
in strikeouts in seven consecutive years (1922–1928). He retired with a 
197–140 record, 2045 strikeouts and a 3.24 ERA – remarkable numbers considering 
he only saw 33 innings of big league play during his twenties. Vance enjoyed 
hunting and fishing when he retired to Homosassa Springs, Florida,[10] 
where he had lived since the 1920s.[3] In 1938, Vance became ill with pneumonia. 
The illness worsened and kept him hospitalized for several months.[11] 
Vance recovered and became a frequent guest at Brooklyn old-timers games.[12] 
He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955. He learned of his 
election when a highway patrolman got his attention on a local highway 
and told him that a photographer was at his house.[12] A Dazzy Vance Day 
celebration was held in Brooklyn. Biographer John Skipper characterized 
his Hall of Fame induction as "subdued" compared to the celebration in 
Brooklyn.[10] Vance died of a heart attack in 1961 in Homosassa Springs. 
His obituary in The Sporting News said that he had been under a doctor's 
care but that he was active and thought to be in relatively good health 
when he died. His survivors included his wife Edyth and a daughter.[3] 
In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 
100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. Vance is mentioned in the poem 
"Line-Up for Yesterday" by Ogden Nash: V is for Vance, The Dodgers' own
