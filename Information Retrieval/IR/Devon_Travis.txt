and 52 RBI in 100 games played.[5] On November 12, 2014, Travis was traded 
to the Toronto Blue Jays for outfielder Anthony Gose.[11] In early 2015 
he was named the 6th best second base prospect in baseball,[12] as well 
as the number 9 prospect in the Blue Jays' organization by MLB.[13] After 
a strong performance in spring training, Travis was announced as the Blue 
Jays' starting second baseman on March 31, 2015.[14] Travis debuted on 
April 6 and recorded his first career hit, a solo home run off Chasen Shreve 
of the New York Yankees. He also recorded 2 walks and scored 2 runs as 
the Blue Jays won 6–1.[15] On April 12, Travis hit a 3-run double to help 
the Blue Jays win 10–7 against the Baltimore Orioles. The hit was initially 
ruled an error on Travis Snider, however the call was changed on April 
16, and Travis was credited with a hit and 3 RBIs.[16] Travis was named 
the Blue Jays Player of the Month for April on May 1.[17] In a 10–7 loss 
to the Cleveland Indians on May 3, Travis hit his first career grand slam.[18] 
On May 4, Travis was announced as the winner of the American League Rookie 
of the Month for April. He batted .325/.393/.625 with 6 home runs, 17 runs 
scored, and 19 RBIs.[19][20] After missing 5 consecutive games with a left

point in May, he had batted .185 in 14 games.[21] He was activated off 
the disabled list on June 26.[22] Travis re-injured his shoulder on July

he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list.[24] The Blue Jays shut 
down Travis for the remainder of the season on September 17, and announced 
that he would undergo an exploratory surgery on his shoulder.[25] He finished 
2015 with a .304 batting average, 8 home runs, and 35 RBI.[2] On November 
18, it was announced that Travis had undergone another surgery on his left 
shoulder, in an attempt to correct a condition called os acromiale which 
was discovered during the 2015 regular season, and would require 16–20 
weeks to recover from the procedure.[26] Two screws were inserted into 
his shoulder, in an attempt to stabilize the extra bone in his shoulder.[27] 
In late April 2016, Travis began taking part in extended spring training

run to give the Blue Jays an early 1–0 lead. In the ninth inning, he hit 
another solo home run off Kelvin Herrera to lift Toronto to a 4–3 victory.[31] 
On August 8, Travis hit his first career triple, which came as part of 
a four-hit game against the Tampa Bay Rays.[32] Following a game on August 
31, the Blue Jays optioned Travis to the Rookie-Advanced Bluefield Blue 
Jays. The move was made to allow Josh Thole to be re-signed and have postseason 
eligibility. As the Bluefield season would end on September 1, Travis could 
be immediately recalled by Toronto afterward, bypassing the ten-day waiting 
period.[33] Travis was recalled by the Blue Jays on September 2.[34] He 
finished the season hitting .300 with 11 home runs and 50 RBI in 101 games.[2]
