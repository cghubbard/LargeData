Jesús Manuel Marcano Trillo (born December 25, 1950), also nicknamed 'Indio', 
is a Venezuelan former second baseman who played in Major League Baseball 
from 1973 through 1989.[1] In a 17-season career, he played for the Oakland 
Athletics (1973–1974), Chicago Cubs (1975–1978, 1986–1988), Philadelphia 
Phillies (1979–1982), Cleveland Indians (1983), Montreal Expos (1983), 
San Francisco Giants (1984–1985) and the Cincinnati Reds (1989).[1] He 
was known as one of the best fielding second basemen of his era with a 
strong throwing arm.[2] Originally signed as a catcher by the Philadelphia 
Phillies in 1968, Trillo was converted into a third baseman by his first 
minor league manager, Dallas Green.[2][3] In 1969, he was selected by the 
Oakland Athletics from the Phillies in the Rule 5 draft. Trillo was converted 
into a second baseman in 1973 while playing for the Athletics' Triple A 
team, the Tucson Toros.[2] He made his Major League debut with Oakland 
on June 28, 1973 and stayed with the club as the Athletics won the American 
League Western Division pennant by six games over the Kansas City Royals, 
then defeated the Baltimore Orioles in the 1973 American League Championship 
Series.[4][5] Trillo had a minor role in a controversial incident during 
the 1973 World Series against the New York Mets. Athletics' second baseman 
Mike Andrews committed two errors in a four-run twelfth inning of Game 
2, leading to a Mets' victory.[6] Athletics team owner Charlie Finley attempted 
to have Andrews waived onto the disabled list in order to activate Trillo 
into the line up.[2] Eventually, commissioner Bowie Kuhn ruled the move 
illegal and, forced Finley to reinstate Andrews for Game 4.[2] In April 
1974, Trillo played 12 games for the Athletics before being sent back to 
the minor league Tucson Toros.[1] He was eventually brought back to the 
major leagues in September. He appeared in one game of the 1974 American 
League Championship Series against the Baltimore Orioles, but didn't make 
any further appearances as the Athletics defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in the 1974 World Series.[7] On October 23, 1974, Trillo was traded along 
with Darold Knowles and Bob Locker to the Chicago Cubs for Billy Williams.[8]Trillo 
would finish third in the 1975 National League Rookie of the Year Award 
balloting.[9] With the Cubs, Trillo developed a reputation for being one 
of the best fielding second basemen in baseball, earning his first All-Star 
selection in 1977.[1][10] Together with Cubs' shortstop Iván DeJesús, he 
formed one of the best double play combinations in baseball.[11] He remained 
with the Cubs for four seasons before being traded to the Philadelphia 
Phillies on February 23, 1979 as part of an eight-player trade.[12] Later 
that season, Trillo was reunited with his former minor league manager, 
Dallas Green, who had replaced Danny Ozark as the Phillies' manager. Trillo 
would win his first Gold Glove Award in 1979.[13] Trillo was an integral 
member of the 1980 world champion Phillies, adding solid defense, while 
hitting for over a .300 batting average until the middle of September, 
finishing the season with a career-high .292 average.[14][15][16] He won 
the 1980 Silver Slugger Award for second basemen which, is awarded annually 
to the best offensive player at each position.[17] In the 1980 National 
League Championship Series against the Houston Astros, he posted a .381 
batting average with four runs batted in, and teamed up with Bake McBride 
in the decisive Game 5 to relay a throw to home plate, cutting off Luis 
Pujols attempting to score from first base on a double by Craig Reynolds.[18][19][20] 
Trillo's performance earned him the League Championship Series Most Valuable 
Player Award.[21] In the 1980 World Series against the Kansas City Royals, 
Trillo once again made his mark in Game 5 by making another relay throw 
to cut off Darrell Porter trying to score in the sixth inning.[22] He then 
hit a single with two outs in the ninth inning to drive home the winning 
run.[22] The Phillies went on to win Game 6 and claimed the first world 
championship in the team's history.[20][23] 1981 would be another good 
year for Trillo as he was selected as a reserve for the National League 
All-Star team, and won his second Gold Glove Award and his second consecutive 
Silver Slugger Award. He was voted to be the starting second baseman for 
the National League in the 1982 All-Star Game and, set a since-broken major 
league record for consecutive errorless chances at second base (479), falling 
two games short of Joe Morgan's record 91-game errorless streak.[24][25][26] 
On December 9, 1982, Trillo was traded to the Cleveland Indians in a multi-player 
deal.[12] In 1983, he made his second consecutive start as the All-Star 
second baseman, this time for the American League.[1] Trillo would also 
win his third and final Gold Glove Award in 1983.[1] He would spend the 
next six seasons with several teams, serving as a utility player before 
ending his career in 1989 with the Cincinnati Reds.[1] In a 17-year career, 
Trillo played in 1,780 games, accumulating 1,562 hits in 5,950 at bats 
for a .263 career batting average along with 61 home runs and 571 runs 
batted in.[1] He ended his career with a .981 fielding percentage.[1] A 
four-time All-Star, Trillo was a three-time Gold Glove winner and a two-time 
Silver Slugger Award winner.[1][27][28] He led National League second basemen 
four times in assists, three times in range factor and twice in putouts.[1] 
In 2007, Trillo was inducted into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame
