Derrill Burnham "Del" Pratt (January 10, 1888 â€“ September 30, 1977) was 
a star running back for the University of Alabama before becoming a professional 
baseball player. Pratt signed with the St. Louis Browns in 1912. He was 
a utility player, playing second base, shortstop, third base and the outfield. 
In his rookie season, Pratt batted .302 for the Browns. In 1916 he led 
the American League with 103 RBIs. In 1917, the Browns were struggling. 
Owner Phil Ball accused some of the players of intentionally playing poorly 
so that they could be traded. Ball said, "Every $1000 I lose on the Browns 
this season will cost the ballplayers $100. Salaries will be cut next season." 
Pratt was offended. He and teammate Doc Lavan sued Ball for slander. The 
Sporting News went so far as to call Pratt the Browns' Trotsky. The suit 
was eventually settled in 1918, and Pratt was traded to the New York Yankees. 
After the 1920 season, the Yankees traded Pratt to the Boston Red Sox for 
Waite Hoyt, but he decided to retire. He was hired as the University of 
Michigan baseball coach to replace Carl Lundgren (with a recommendation 
from Branch Rickey) and served as an assistant football coach and freshman 
basketball coach.[1] He began preparing the 1921 team, but the Red Sox 
coaxed him out of retirement before the first game of the season. Upon 
his return to the Sox in 1921, Pratt batted over .300. He ended his career 
with the Detroit Tigers. His career batting average was .292 over twelve 
seasons, with an on-base percentage of .345. He had a total of 968 RBIs
