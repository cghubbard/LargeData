The Washington Nationals are an American professional baseball franchise 
based in Washington, D.C. They are members of the National League (NL) 
East Division in Major League Baseball (MLB). The team began playing in 
1969 as an expansion team in Montreal, Quebec, then known as the Montreal 
Expos. There have been 16 different managers in their franchise's history. 
In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager (or more formally, 
the field manager). The Nationals are the only NL team to have never been 
in a World Series.[1][2] The team has played their home games at the Nationals 
Park since 2008.[3] The Nationals are owned by Ted Lerner, with Mike Rizzo 
as their general manager.[4] The Expos' first manager was Gene Mauch, who 
managed for sixÂ seasons.[5] Felipe Alou is the franchise's all-time leader 
in regular season games managed (1,408) and regular season game wins (691). 
Jim Fanning is the only Expos manager to have gone into the post-season. 
Buck Rodgers and Alou are the only managers to have won the NL Manager 
of the Year Award with the Expos, in 1987 and 1994 respectively.[6] Karl 
Kuehl, Jim Fanning, and Tom Runnells have all spent their entire MLB managing 
careers with the Expos/Nationals.[7][8][9] After Manny Acta was fired during 
the 2009 season, Jim Riggleman, the bench coach, was named interim manager 
to replace him, and was promoted to the position full-time for the 2010 
season.[10] After Riggleman resigned during the 2011 season, the team hired 
veteran manager Davey Johnson, who had previously served as an advisor 
to Rizzo. Johnson led the team to the 2012 National League East title and 
the franchise's first playoff berth since moving to Washington. The team's 
most recent manager was former Arizona Diamondbacks third base coach Matt 
Williams, who replaced Johnson after his retirement following the 2013 
season.[11][12] Note: Statistics are correct as of the end of the 2015
