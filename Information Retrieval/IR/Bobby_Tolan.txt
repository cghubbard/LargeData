Robert Tolan (born November 19, 1945) is a former center and right fielder 
in Major League Baseball. Tolan, who batted and threw left-handed, played 
for the St. Louis Cardinals (1965–68), Cincinnati Reds (1969–73), San Diego 
Padres (1974–75, 1979), Philadelphia Phillies (1976–77) and Pittsburgh 
Pirates (1977). He also played one season in Japan for the Nankai Hawks 
(1978). Tolan was a reserve outfielder during his years with the Cardinals, 
with whom he won a World Series title in 1967. He also played on the 1968 
National League champions; however, the Redbirds lost to the Detroit Tigers 
in the World Series in seven games, after leading three games to one. The 
day after the final game of this Series Tolan was traded to the Cincinnati 
Reds along with reliever Wayne Granger for veteran outfielder Vada Pinson. 
As their center fielder, often batting second behind Pete Rose and in front 
of Alex Johnson in the Reds lineup, Tolan in 1969 hit .305 and established 
career highs in home runs and runs batted in (21 and 93 respectively). 
In this, the first year both leagues were split into two divisions, the 
Reds finished third in the National League West, four games behind the 
division-winning Atlanta Braves. The "Big Red Machine", which also featured 
future Hall of Famers Johnny Bench and Tony Pérez (and would later feature 
a third, Joe Morgan), was just beginning to take shape. In 1970, Tolan 
batted a career high .316 with 16 home runs and 80 RBIs, and led the National 
League in stolen bases with 57 (the only time former Cardinal teammate 
Lou Brock did not lead the National League in steals between 1966 and 1974) 
for a Reds team that won the National League West title for their first 
postseason berth since the 1961 World Series. The Reds swept the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the NLCS in three games; in the second game, Tolan scored all 
three runs in a 3-1 victory, including hitting a fifth-inning home run 
off starter Luke Walker. However, the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Reds 
in the World Series in five games. Tolan went 4-for-19 in the Series, including 
a home run off Mike Cuellar in Game Two. Tolan missed the 1971 season after 
rupturing his Achilles tendon playing basketball, which violated a specific 
clause in his contract barring him from that activity. He came back in 
1972, winning both the Comeback Player of the Year award and the Hutch 
Award after batting .283 with 82 RBIs and 42 stolen bases. Tolan became 
only the second player to win both the Hutch Award and his league's Comeback 
Player of the Year Award (Tony Conigliaro was the first) and the first 
to do so during the same season. His Reds again defeated the Pirates in 
the NLCS (this time with the winning run scoring on a wild pitch by Bob 
Moose, after the Reds entered the ninth inning trailing by a run) to win 
the pennant; however, they were defeated by the Oakland Athletics in the 
World Series in seven games. 1973 was a disastrous year for Tolan, one 
in which his batting average plummeted to .206. He became a malcontent 
and had several squabbles with Reds management, who were still unhappy 
with his 1971 basketball injury. Tolan also went AWOL for two days in August 
and broke team rules by growing a beard. On September 27, the team suspended 
Tolan for the remainder of the season. The Reds won yet another division 
title but the suspension forced Tolan to miss the NLCS, which the Reds 
lost to the New York Mets. At the end of the season the Reds traded Tolan 
to the Padres for pitcher Clay Kirby. After the trade the Major League 
Baseball Players Association filed a grievance on Tolan's behalf. During 
the 1974 season, in which he batted .266 in 95 games, he learned that he 
had won his grievance. Tolan demanded that the Reds publicly apologize 
to him because his name had been slandered but never got the apology. Tolan 
was released by the Padres after batting .255 in 1975. He signed with the 
Philadelphia Phillies as a free agent, and in 1976 batted .261 as a part-time 
outfielder. The Phillies won the National League East title to earn their 
first post-season appearance since the "Whiz Kids" were swept by the New 
York Yankees in the 1950 World Series. However, Tolan's former team, the 
Reds, defeated the Phillies in the NLCS. Tolan played professionally in 
Japan in 1978. He was also a coach for the Padres from 1980–1983. During 
the strike of 1981, Tolan was dispatched to Walla Walla, Washington, where 
he was Tony Gwynn's first hitting coach. [1] Tolan also was player-manager 
of the St. Petersburg Pelicans, a team in the Senior Professional Baseball 
Association, in the two years of the league's operation, 1989–1990. In 
his major league career, Tolan batted .265 with 86 home runs and 497 runs 
batted in, in 1,282 games played. Tolan is married to Marian Trahan and 
they have a son Robert (Robbie) Tolan who plays professional baseball in 
the Washington Nationals organization. On December 31, 2008, Robbie was 
shot by a Bellaire, Texas policeman allegedly investigating reports of 
a stolen car after a confrontation in the Tolan driveway. The younger Tolan 
was unarmed and driving his own vehicle. The bullet lodged in Tolan's liver; 
the injury may have ended his professional baseball career. An investigation 
into the shooting is on-going.[1][2] Tolan's cousin, Eddie Tolan, was a
