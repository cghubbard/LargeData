As player As coach So Taguchi (田口 壮, Taguchi Sō?, born July 2, 1969) is 
a Japanese former outfielder. After ten seasons with the Orix BlueWave 
of Nippon Professional Baseball, he played eight years in Major League 
Baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago 
Cubs, followed by a final two years in Japan with the Orix Buffaloes. Taguchi 
is the first Japanese National League player to win a World Series. Taguchi 
is also the first Japanese player to win two World Series with different 
teams – with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006 and the Philadelphia Phillies 
in 2008. Taguchi was born and raised in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo, Japan. He graduated 
from Kwansei Gakuin University in his hometown, with a Bachelor of Arts 
in Business Administration. He was a teammate of Ichiro Suzuki when the 
two played for the Orix BlueWave in the Pacific League of NPB. Although 
he was drafted by the BlueWave as an infielder, he was moved to the outfield 
later in his career. He was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as a free 
agent in 2002 at the age of 33, a year in which he rose through the minor 
league system, playing for the New Haven Ravens and the Memphis Redbirds, 
compiling a .262 batting average, with 6 home runs and 51 RBI. He eventually 
earned a call-up on September 7, and recorded the first hit of his major 
league career in the second inning against the Chicago Cubs. Taguchi became 
the first (and to date only) Japanese-born player in Cardinal history. 
He originally requested to wear the number 6, but he couldn't because it 
was retired for Stan Musial, nor could he turn 6 upside down because 9 
is retired for Enos Slaughter. He could not wear the number he had at the 
Olympics because 1 was retired for Ozzie Smith. He was also unable to double 
6 as Rick Ankiel was on the roster that year. Finally, he decided to wear 
99. Taguchi got another brief call-up in 2003, then got more playing time 
with the Cardinals in 2004, appearing in 109 games. He was included on 
the '04 Cardinals postseason roster, and appeared in two games of the 2004 
World Series, which the Cardinals lost to the Boston Red Sox in a four-game 
sweep. In 2005, injuries to outfielders Larry Walker and Reggie Sanders 
opened up manager Tony La Russa's lineup card, and Taguchi became an everyday 
player. He responded with his best season, batting .288 in 396 at-bats 
with eight home runs and fifty-three RBI, and contributing with his stellar 
defense at all three outfield positions as the Cardinals won 100 games 
and had the best record in the National League. Cardinal radio announcer 
Mike Shannon took to calling Taguchi "the So-man" and praising his hard 
work and extreme personal courtesy. By habit Taguchi would even give a 
little bow to the umpire whenever he stepped up to the plate. His modest 
and happy demeanor, as well as shyness due to struggling with English in 
interviews early on, endeared him to St. Louis fans. In 2006, Taguchi's 
playing time declined somewhat, his at-bat total falling to 316 from 396 
the year before. However, Taguchi would make the playoff roster for the 
Cardinals for the third year in a row, and have a heroic postseason moment: 
on October 13, 2006, he hit the go-ahead home run off Billy Wagner in the 
top of the 9th inning of Game 2 of the NLCS. The home run gave the Cardinals 
a 7–6 lead in a game they would win 9-6.[1] Taguchi played in four of five 
games of the 2006 World Series for the Cardinals, hitting .182, and won 
a World Series ring as the Cardinals defeated the Detroit Tigers four games 
to one. Taguchi agreed to a one-year deal worth $925,000 with the St. Louis 
Cardinals for the 2007 season. Taguchi returned to the Cardinals in 2007 
and had another solid season, batting .290 as a part-time player, with 
307 at-bats in 130 games. He was one of manager Tony La Russa's most valuable 
pinch-hitters; of 46 games in 2007 where he's shown to have had just 1 
AB, Taguchi picked up 15 hits. Taguchi played 617 innings in the field, 
with 41 starts (and 22 other appearances) in center (where Jim Edmonds 
was banged up) and 21 starts (20 other) in left (where the Cardinals hadn't 
settled on one player until 2008 and Skip Schumaker). Taguchi played sparingly 
in right field (2 starts, 6 other) and part of a game at 2B.[2] After the 
2007 season ended, the Cardinals declined Taguchi's option for 2008, then 
decided to forgo arbitration and release Taguchi on December 5, 2007, after 
Taguchi's agent had requested his release earlier in the week.[3][4] On 
December 23, 2007, Taguchi was signed to a one-year deal by the Philadelphia 
Phillies with an option for 2009.[5] Taguchi's numbers fell off sharply, 
his batting average dropping from .290 in 2007 to .220 in 2008, and he 
got only 91 at-bats for the whole season. However, he was included on Philadelphia's 
postseason roster and won his second championship ring when the Phillies 
won the 2008 World Series. (Taguchi was 0-for-4 pinch-hitting in the NLCS 
and did not appear in the World Series.) Shortly after winning the World 
Series, the Phillies decided to decline Taguchi's option and make him a 
free agent.[6] Taguchi agreed to a minor league contract with the Chicago 
Cubs for the 2009 season, and was invited to spring training.[7][8] Taguchi 
was signed in part to provide a Japanese teammate for Cub outfielder Kosuke 
Fukudome. Taguchi did not make the Cubs roster and was optioned to Triple-A. 
After spending most of the season in the minors, Taguchi, who hit .248 
with four home runs and 24 RBI in 85 games in the minors, was called up 
to the Cubs on September 16, 2009, replacing the injured Sam Fuld.[9] He 
appeared in 12 games and got 3 hits in 11 at-bats. In January 2010 Taguchi's 
old team, the Orix BlueWave (since merged with the Kintetsu Buffaloes to 
form the Orix Buffaloes), announced that they had signed Taguchi to return 
and play for them in 2010.[10] On July 31, 2012, Taguchi announced his 
retirement on his official blog.[11][12] In September 2012 Taguchi embarked 
on a new career as a baseball commentator.[13] By 2013, Taguchi was employed 
by Japanese broadcaster NHK to announce Major League Baseball games.[14] 
Taguchi learned English from his wife, Emiko, a former television reporter 
who speaks it fluently. He also practiced by watching films such as Finding 
Nemo and Monsters, Inc. [15] They have one son, Kan, born December 24,
