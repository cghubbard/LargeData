A rundown, informally known as a pickle or the hotbox, is a situation in 
the game of baseball that occurs when the baserunner is stranded between 
two bases and is in jeopardy of being tagged out. When the base runner 
attempts to advance to the next base, he is cut off by the defensive player 
who has a live ball and attempts to return to his previous base before 
being tagged out. As he is doing this, the defenseman throws the ball past 
the base runner to the previous base, forcing him to reverse directions 
again. This is repeated until the runner is put out or reaches a base safely. 
A rundown can be escaped if a fielder makes an error, the runner gets around 
the fielder with the ball without running out of the baseline, a fielder 
throws the ball elsewhere (e.g., toward home plate if another runner is 
trying to score), or the runner manages to get by the fielder without the 
ball while there is no other fielder to cover the runner's destination 
base. The word rundown in sports broadcasting has overtaken the word pickle 
throughout the years. Pickle is more so used to describe the children's 
yard game where two fielders must tag the runner before the runner reaches 
a base or objective, which, although a fundamental part of baseball, is 
a game in and of itself. The use of the term "pickle" originated with the 
phrase "in a pickle", which means to be in a pickling (difficult or troubling)
