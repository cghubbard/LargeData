would be their final World Series win in New York. It was the first time 
the Cleveland Indians had been swept in a World Series. The only highlight 
for the Indians was that they kept the Yankees from winning their sixth 
straight series. The last time the Yankees had not won the series or pennant 
beforehand was 1948, when, again, the Indians kept them out (although that 
year, they won the Series). It was also the only World Series from 1949 
to 1958 which did not feature the Yankees. September 29, 1954 at the Polo
