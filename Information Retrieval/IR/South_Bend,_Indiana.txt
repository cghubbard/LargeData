South Bend is a city in and the county seat of St. Joseph County, Indiana, 
United States,[5] on the St. Joseph River near its southernmost bend, from 
which it derives its name. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total 
of 101,168 residents; its Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population 
of 318,586 and Combined Statistical Area of 721,296.[6] It is the fourth-largest 
city in Indiana, serving as the economic and cultural hub of Northern Indiana. 
The highly ranked University of Notre Dame is located just to the north 
in unincorporated Notre Dame, Indiana and is an integral contributor to 
the region's economy. The area was originally settled in the early 19th 
century by fur traders[7] and was established as a city in 1865. The St. 
Joseph River shaped South Bend's economy through the mid-20th century. 
River access assisted heavy industrial development such as that of the 
Studebaker Corporation, the Oliver Chilled Plow Company, and other large 
corporations. The population of South Bend declined after 1960, when it 
had a peak population of 132,445. This was chiefly due to migration to 
suburban areas as well as the demise of Studebaker and other heavy industry. 
Today, the largest industries in South Bend are health care, education, 
small business, and tourism. Remaining large corporations include Crowe 
Horwath, Honeywell, and AM General. Recently, the city population has started 
to grow for the first time in nearly fifty years.[8] The old Studebaker 
plant and surrounding area, now called Ignition Park, is being redeveloped 
as a technology center to attract new industry.[9] The city has also been 
featured in national news coverage for Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has achieved 
recognition for his various economic development projects within the city, 
his position as the youngest mayor to be elected in a city of more than 
100,000 residents, and his essay in which he came out as the first openly 
gay executive in the state of Indiana.[10][11] The St. Joseph Valley was 
long occupied by Native Americans. One of the earliest known groups to 
occupy what would later become northern Indiana was the Miami tribe. Later, 
the Potawatomi moved into the region, utilizing the rich food and natural 
resources found along the river. The Potawatomi occupied this region of 
Indiana until most of them were forcibly removed in the 1840s. The South 
Bend area was so popular because its portage was the shortest overland 
route from the St. Joseph River to the Kankakee River.[12] This route was 
used for centuries, first by the Native Americans, then by French explorers, 
missionaries and traders.[13] The French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, 
Sieur de La Salle, the first white European to set foot in what is now 
South Bend,[14] used this portage between the St. Joseph River and the 
Kankakee River in December 1679. The first permanent white settlers of 
South Bend were fur traders who established trading posts in the area. 
In 1820, Pierre Frieschutz Navarre arrived, representing the American Fur 
Company (AFC) of John Jacob Astor. He settled near what is now downtown 
South Bend.[15] Alexis Coquillard, another agent of the AFC,[15][16] established 
a trading post known as the Big St. Joseph Station.[17] In 1827, Lathrop 
Minor Taylor established a post for Samuel Hanna and Company, in whose 
records the name St. Joseph's, Indiana was used.[16] By 1829, the town 
was growing, with Coquillard and Taylor emerging as leaders. They applied 
for a post office. Taylor was appointed postmaster, and the post office 
was designated as Southold, Allen County, Indiana.[15] The following year, 
the name was changed to South Bend, probably to ease confusion, as several 
other communities were named Southold at the time. In 1831, South Bend 
was laid out as the county seat and as one of the four original townships 
of St. Joseph County with 128 residents.[18] Soon after, design began on 
what would become the town of South Bend.[15] The town was formally established 
in 1835 and rapidly grew. In 1856, attorney Andrew Anderson founded May 
Oberfell Lorber, the oldest business in St. Joseph County.[19] He compiled 
a complete index of South Bend's real estate records.[20] In 1841, Schuyler 
Colfax was appointed St. Joseph County deputy auditor. Colfax purchased 
the South Bend Free Press and then turned it into the pro-Whig newspaper, 
the St. Joseph Valley Register. He was a member of the state constitutional 
convention of 1850 where he opposed the barring of African American migration 
to Indiana. He joined the Republican party, like many Whigs of his day, 
and was elected to Congress in 1855 and became Speaker of the House in 
1863 under Abraham Lincoln. In 1868, he was elected Vice President under 
Ulysses S. Grant. Colfax returned to South Bend after his stint in Washington 
and was buried in the City Cemetery.[21] During the late 1830s through 
the 1850s, much of South Bend's development centered on the industrial 
complex of factories located on the two races (man-made canals along the 
St. Joseph River in South Bend). Several dams were created, and factories 
were built on each side of the river. On October 4, 1851, the first steam 
locomotive entered South Bend.[15] This led to a general shift of businesses 
from the river toward the railroad. In 1852, Henry Studebaker set up Studebaker 
wagon shop, later becoming the world's largest wagon builder and the only 
one to later succeed as an automobile manufacturer. The Singer Sewing Company 
and the Oliver Chilled Plow Company were among other companies that made 
manufacturing the driving force in the South Bend economy until the mid-20th 
century.[15] Another important economic act was the dredging of the Kankakee 
River in 1884 to create farmland.[22] During this time period there was 
a great immigration of Europeans, such as Polish, Hungarian, Irish, German, 
Italian, and Swedish people to South Bend because the rise of area factories.[23] 
South Bend benefited from its location on the Michigan Road, the main north–south 
artery of northern Indiana in the 19th century.[15] Another significant 
development occurred near South Bend in 1842, when Father Edward Sorin 
founded the University of Notre Dame just north of the town.[24] It became 
a major factor in the area's economy and culture.[25] On May 22, 1865, 
South Bend was incorporated as a city, and its first elections were held 
on June 5, 1865, with William G.George elected as its first mayor[16] Olivet 
AME was founded in South Bend in March 1870, making it the first African-American 
church in the city.[26] Olivet AME is still an active African Methodist 
Episcopal Church, and celebrated its 145th anniversary in 2015.[27] A sergeant 
from South Bend fired the first American shells against Germany in World 
War I.[28] In 1923, the African-American owner of a soda fountain received 
a letter signed KKK threatening to kill an African-American man held in 
the city's jail and harm the rest of the city's African-American population. 
Within a few days over a thousand African-Americans fled the city.[29] 
In 1924, the Ku Klux Klan held a conference and planned a parade from its 
local headquarters at 230 S. Michigan St. In preparation, Klan members 
were posted around town to direct traffic. Notre Dame students, well aware 
of the anti-Catholic nature of the Klan, did not take kindly to this state 
of affairs, and before noon all of the Klansmen-cum-traffic directors had 
been "unmasked and unrobed." Notre Dame students continued the fight, with 
several hundred gathering outside of the Klan headquarters, throwing rocks 
and smashing windows in protest. Local police as well as Notre Dame officials 
eventually managed to convince them to return to campus.[30][31][32] Apparently 
even legendary football coach Knute Rockne became involved in the struggle 
to calm down the students.[33] Other industries developed in South Bend 
in the early 20th century, including Birdsell Manufacturing Company, the 
Bendix Corporation, Honeywell, AlliedSignal, South Bend Lathe Works, the 
O'Brien Paint Corp., the South Bend Toy Company, South Bend Range, South 
Bend Bait Company, and South Bend Watch Company. Workers at the Bendix 
Corporation actually staged the first sit-in strike in American history 
in 1936.[34] Fast development led to the creation of electric rail transportation 
throughout the area and, in 1925, the South Shore interurban streetcar 
service was established from downtown South Bend to downtown Chicago.[35] 
South Bend was the first community in the United States to have an electrified 
trolley system (even though it was a few years before it was usable and 
profitable). On June 30, 1934, the Merchants National Bank in South Bend 
was the last bank to be robbed by the notorious "Dillinger gang".[36] In 
1949, legendary percussionist Lionel Hampton was informed that his concert 
at South Bend's Palais du Royale would be a blacks only event; he threatened 
to call for a boycott of the venue, and the affair proceeded as an integrated 
evening, which newspapers said led to all attendees breaking out in "paroxysms 
of ecstasy."[37] By 1950, more than half of all employment was in the manufacturing 
sector.[38] Due to economic difficulties, Studebaker closed its automotive 
manufacturing plants in South Bend in December 1963.[39] A general decline 
in manufacturing soon followed as industry was being restructured nationwide. 
By the year 2000, manufacturing was only 16 percent of the local economy. 
Due to the severe loss of jobs, the city's population decreased by nearly 
30,000 people during that period.[38] In 1984, South Bend community leaders 
began seeking a minor-league baseball team for the city. A stadium was 
constructed in 1986 and a 10-year player-development contract was signed 
with the Chicago White Sox. The team would be known as the South Bend White 
Sox. In 1994, the team's name was changed to the South Bend Silver Hawks.[40] 
The Silver Hawks changed their name to The South Bend Cubs in 2015. They 
are a Class A minor league affiliate of the Chicago Cubs in the Midwest 
League. In 2015, the City of South Bend celebrated its 150th birthday. 
The celebration, lasting a year long, culminated with a celebration along 
the St. Joseph River with the lighting of the first River Lights. Mayor 
Pete Buttigieg welcomed the coming of the next 150 years of South Bend's 
heritage accompanied by five previous South Bend mayors: Steve Luecke, 
Joe Kernan, Roger Parent, Peter Nemeth and Jerry Miller.[41] As of 2015, 
the city began seeing modest population growth of 286 for the first time 
in nearly fifty years.[8] The old Studebaker plant in South Bend is currently 
a new tech center, as the city is trying to attract the new industry. The 
area where the plants were abandoned is now called Ignition Park and is 
attracting new businesses.[9] South Bend is located at 41°40′21″N 86°15′19″W﻿ 
/ ﻿41.67250°N 86.25528°W﻿ / 41.67250; -86.25528 (41.672597, −86.255157),[42] 
5 mi (8.0 km) from the Michigan border and approximately equidistant from 
Illinois and Ohio. The city is 93 mi (150 km) from Chicago. The nearest 
shore of Lake Michigan is 20 mi (32 km) away. According to the 2010 census, 
South Bend has a total area of 41.877 square miles (108.46 km2), of which 
41.46 square miles (107.38 km2) (or 99%) is land and 0.417 square miles 
(1.08 km2) (or 1%) is water.[1] The St. Joseph River flows from the east 
end of the city turning north near the city center, giving South Bend its 
name at the bend in the river. South Bend is located on the North-South 
continental divide, and the river flows northwest into Lake Michigan.[43] 
The downtown area is located in the north-central part of the city along 
the St. Joseph River. Notre Dame, Indiana, is directly adjacent to the 
north. The city extends further north on the west side, mainly with manufacturing 
and distribution facilities near the South Bend International Airport. 
Mishawaka, Indiana, is adjacent to South Bend's east side. South Bend has 
a humid continental climate, with a Köppen climate classification of Dfa. 
Lake Michigan exerts a great influence on the climate of South Bend, including 
lake effect snow in winter and a tendency to moderate temperatures year 
round.[44] June through August are the warmest months, with average temperatures 
above 69 °F (21 °C). Normally, 42 days with thunderstorms occur each year.[44] 
The snowiest month is usually January, with snow fall normally recorded 
from October through April.[45] On average, South Bend receives 81.8 inches 
(208 cm) of snow per year.[44] Spring and fall can be mild and overcast, 
but also severely stormy at times with 293 partly cloudy to cloudy days 
each year.[46] As of the census[3] of 2010, there were 101,168 people,

- 0.9%. South Bend's location on the St. Joseph River led to an industrial-based 
economy in the late 19th century and early-to-mid-20th century. In 1923, 
industrialist and entrepreneur Vincent H. Bendix selected South Bend as 
the site of his new manufacturing plant for automotive parts.[51] He chose 
South Bend primarily because it was on a rail line midway between Chicago 
and Detroit, the two automotive manufacturing centers of the United States 
at the time.[51] Eventually, the Bendix corporation built a vast manufacturing 
complex on its South Bend acreage served by the major railroads, including 
a huge shipping and receiving building where railroad cars could enter 
at one end, unload, and depart at the opposite end. By the end of World 
War II, manufacturing began to diminish.[52] The Studebaker plant, which 
had at one time employed 45,000 citizens, closed in 1963; its engine block 
plant shuttered the following year. Parts of the Bendix factory complex 
were later acquired and subdivided between Honeywell Corporation and Bosch 
Corporation respectively. Honeywell Aerospace continues to manufacture 
aviation products at its former Bendix facility. In 2010, Bosch announced 
that it would cease all operations at its Bendix plant location in South 
Bend by the end of 2011.[53] Bosch vacated the building entirely in October 
2012. Curtis Products of South Bend moved into the building in May 2013. 
Since the 1960s, education, health care, and small business have come to 
the forefront of South Bend's economy, though the city has never regained 
the level of prosperity it enjoyed before that time. Nearby University 
of Notre Dame is a large contributor to the local economy. The university 
is the largest employer in St. Joseph County, employing 5,590 people.[25] 
Health care is another major contributor to the South Bend economy. In 
2012, Memorial Health System announced that it was merging with Elkhart 
General Hospital, located in Elkhart County, to form Beacon Health System.[54] 
Beacon is the second largest employer in the city, employing 3,450 people. 
Other notable businesses include Honeywell, Bosch, and PEI Genesis. AM 
General, Crowe Horwath, Martin's Super Markets, and Schurz Communications 
all have corporate headquarters in South Bend. According to the 2013 Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report,[55] the city's top employers are: Efforts are 
under way to spur economic growth in South Bend. The St. Joe Valley Metronet 
is a 50-mile dark, fiber optic network that encircles South Bend and Mishawaka 
that allows for strong telecommunications connectivity.[57] The South Bend 
Metronet, named Zing, is bringing more high-tech firms to the city and 
surrounding area. This telecommunications network has allowed for the advent 
of various data centers in South Bend, which serves as a hub between Chicago, 
Indianapolis, Detroit, and Cincinnati. The City of South Bend recently 
announced it will provide free wireless internet access via the Metronet 
in the city's downtown and East Bank areas.[58] The Union Station Technology 
Center was bought from the city in 1979 and is currently Northern Indiana's 
largest data center.[59] It is also home to enFocus, a fellowship program 
that began in 2012 which employs local graduates who work on local projects 
with a focus on innovation and social entrepreneurship.[60] There are currently 
plans to extend the data center into a fully operating high tech data hub 
in the old Studebaker "Ivy Tower" assembly plant next door, creating what 
will be called the Renaissance District.[61] This project is set to break 
ground in 2015 and could take more than a decade to fully complete. Innovation 
Park and Ignition Park, dual-certified technology parks, have already attracted 
technology businesses to South Bend. Located across the street from the 
University of Notre Dame, Innovation Park was completed in 2009 and houses 
innovative researchers from companies and the university.[62] Ignition 
Park, located just south of the downtown area, is planned to become home 
to 3 million square feet of high tech space on 140 acres of land previously 
owned by the Studebaker Corporation.[63] The first tenant, Data Realty, 
moved into the location in the fall of 2012.[64] The second building in 
the new park will be used as a research and testing facility for massive 
turbo machinery as part of a partnership between the city, General Electric, 
Great Lakes Capital, Indiana Michigan Power, University of Notre Dame, 
and the state of Indiana.[65] This project began construction in 2015 and 
is expected to have an economic impact of $15 million annually. Redevelopment 
is underway for some of the abandoned industrial facilities, with the abandoned 
Oliver Corporation buildings being the most recent example of reclaimed 
property.[66] The city also faced programs with large swaths of vacant 
housing after the decline of the manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 
homes were vacant or abandoned.[67] However, the city created the Vacant 
and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take 
care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, 
repairing, or some other satisfactory means.[68] As of June 2015, 828 homes 
have been demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners. The Smart Street 
Initiative, a 20-year plan to make the city safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, 
and motorists, began in 2013 with the conversion of one-way streets to 
two-way streets.[69] The hope is to bring more businesses to the area, 
create shorter travel routes, and a reduce in speeding. This phase of the 
project is expected to be completed in 2016. The other part of the initiative 
is the West Side Main Streets Plan, which is a revitalization plan for 
the Lincoln Way West and Western Avenue corridor focusing on guiding business 
owners, residents, and developers to improve the street front by offering 
a reimbursement on exterior improvements from the city and the Urban Enterprise 
Association.[70] In 2012, Kiplinger's Personal Finance ranked South Bend 
eighth in the "Ten Best Cities for Cheapskates".[71] South Bend was also 
ranked among the 40 hottest real estate markets for business by Expansion 
Management magazine,[72] and Smart+Connected Communities Institute featured 
South Bend as one of the top ten cities worldwide that is reinventing themselves 
through technology.[73] South Bend was influenced by a large influx of 
Polish Catholic immigrants in the late 19th century.[74] Dyngus Day is 
widely celebrated on the Monday after Easter and is the beginning of the 
city elections campaign season.[75] Fat Tuesday is also celebrated in South 
Bend, with paczkis being a staple food product in the city for the day.[76] 
The city and surrounding county have 23 Catholic churches, 11 Catholic 
schools and three Catholic universities (the University of Notre Dame, 
Holy Cross College, and Saint Mary's College, all located in the adjacent 
city of Notre Dame).[77] The city has several annual festivals. The South 
Bend International Festival began ten years ago as the South Bend Reggae 
Festival and now features local and international musical artists who perform 
in African, Latino, and American cultural styles. Proceeds from the festival 
are given to the Pangani Foundation of South Bend, which provides medical 
supplies to hospitals in Malawi.[78] WBYT FM - B100 (Country Station) hosts 
an Annual All Day Country Concert, with over 37,000 free tickets in early 
September. The World Pulse Festival, broadcast by LeSEA Broadcasting network, 
is held annually in South Bend. It is hosted by Pulse FM, a local Christian 
music radio station. The event is an annual Contemporary Christian music 
festival, attracting more than 50,000 visitors each year.[79] In 2013, 
a new annual festival began in South Bend called South by South Bend, named 
after the famous South By Southwest of Austin, TX. The festival is a celebration 
of the local music scene, with local bands and artists performing on the 
park grounds and other public venues around the city.[80] The goals of 
the festival include strengthening the bond between the communities of 
South Bend and Notre Dame, supporting local artistic expression, and promoting 
local business.[81] In 2015, the festival was renamed Sounds by South Bend, 
to avoid confusion with the Austin festival and more accurately represent 
the purpose of the event.[82] The South Bend Museum of Art is located in 
Century Center in downtown South Bend. The museum was opened to the public 
in March 1996, and features a variety of artists from South Bend and the 
Michiana region. Currently, over 850 works are featured in the permanent 
collection. The museum also offers several classes and workshops for adults 
and children.[83] The History Museum is the public name of the Northern 
Indiana Historical Society, the second-oldest historical society in Indiana, 
which was established in 1867 to collect and interpret the history of the 
northern Indiana region by St. Joseph County's leading citizens. The Oliver 
Mansion (also known by its original name, Copshaholm) is one of the central 
features of the museum. The 38-room mansion was built in 1895 and is currently 
listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The home was built 
by Joseph Doty Oliver, the son of James Oliver, the founder of the Oliver 
Farm Equipment Company, once the largest plow manufacturer in the United 
States.[84] In addition to the Oliver Mansion and the Workers Home (a 1920s 
Polish-American family home), and museum includes areas dedicated to the 
history of the St. Joseph River Valley, the University of Notre Dame, the 
All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, and the Kidsfirst Children's 
Museum.[84] The Studebaker National Museum holds a large collection of 
wagons and automobiles from the 150-year history of the Studebaker Corporation.[85] 
The museum began as a collection of wagons and automobiles produced by 
Studebaker, including the presidential carriages of Lincoln, McKinley, 
Harrison, and Grant. The company donated the collection to the city of 
South Bend in 1966. The collection was housed in various locations from 
Century Center to its current location in downtown South Bend, adjacent 
to The History Museum. The two museums share one campus, and together form 
The Museums at Washington and Chapin.[86] The former South Bend mansion 
of Clement Studebaker, named Tippecanoe Place, is now a restaurant. The 
Morris Performing Arts Center, built in 1922, included the Palace Theater, 
a venue for vaudeville. The theatre's heyday was in 1940 with the premiere 
of Knute Rockne, All American, starring Ronald Reagan. A crowd estimated 
at 24,000 gathered outside. The theater was scheduled for demolition in 
1959, when E. M. Morris purchased the facility and sold it to the city 
for one dollar, after which it was renamed the Morris Civic Auditorium. 
A total renovation was completed in 2000. The Morris Performing Arts Center 
also includes the Palais Royale Ballroom, on which restoration was recently 
completed.[87] The center houses the Broadway Theater League and the South 
Bend Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's Shanghai-born conductor, Tsung 
Yeh, was the first conductor ever to hold music directorships of both a 
western symphony orchestra and a major Chinese orchestra.[88] Marian High 
School holds its graduation ceremony at the theater. South Bend is also 
home to The South Bend Hot Patooties, a group that performs a shadowcast 
of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.[89] The group has performed at various 
South Bend venues including the State Theater, Legends of Notre Dame, The 
Potawatomi Conservatories, and the historic Birdsell Mansion.[90] The South 
Bend Civic Theatre, founded in 1957, was for many years located at The 
Firehouse, 701 Portage Avenue. In 2007, a new theatre opened at 403 North 
Main Street, in what was formerly the Scottish Rite Building. The new facility 
includes a 209-seat main-stage auditorium and a 90-seat "black-box" studio 
theatre.[91] The South Bend Civic Theatre produces more than a dozen plays 
per year, including several productions in its Family Series. The Fischoff 
National Chamber Music Association, sponsor of the world's largest chamber 
music competition, was founded in South Bend in 1973. The annual Fischoff 
National Chamber Music Competition is held on the campus of the University 
of Notre Dame. Schuyler Colfax, the 17th Vice President of the United States, 
is interred in South Bend City Cemetery.[92] The city is home to the South 
Bend Cubs, a Class A Minor League Baseball team, which plays at Four Winds 
Field at Coveleski Stadium in downtown South Bend. In 2014, the franchise 
changed its name and logo to the South Bend Cubs[93] and became affiliated 
with the Chicago Cubs; prior to this, it had been known as the South Bend 
Silver Hawks and affiliated with the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2005, the 
franchise nearly moved to Marion, Illinois, but a group of investors, led 
by former Indiana Governor and South Bend Mayor Joe Kernan, bought the 
Silver Hawks in order to ensure the team stayed in South Bend.[8] The Ballpark 
Synagogue is a 1901 synagogue building on the grounds of the ballpark, 
which serves as the team's Fan store. It is the Nation's only Ballpark 
Synagogue and it is available for weddings and other events.[94] The stadium 
is also used for multiple community events. In 2015, the South Bend Cubs 
broke their previous ticket sales record, with a total of 347,678 tickets 
sold.[95] The city also hosts the South Bend Roller Girls,[96] the city's 
non-profit flat-track roller derby league. Founded in March 2010, the league 
has worked to support fundraising for local charities, such as the Salvation 
Army's Adopt-A-Family program, the American Cancer Society's Making Strides 
Against Breast Cancer, and the St. Joe County Humane Society. The South 
Bend Roller Girls traveling/competitive team, The Studebreakers, is named 
after the historic Studebaker Corporation. The team is a member of the 
Women's Flat Track Derby Association. South Bend is home to the first artificial 
whitewater center in North America, the East Race Waterway, which is adjacent 
to Century Center. The East Race Waterway is one of only four operating 
artificial whitewater facilities in the United States, the others being 
Dickerson Whitewater Course (in Dickerson, Maryland), U.S. National Whitewater 
Center (in Charlotte, North Carolina), Adventure Sports Center International 
(in McHenry, Maryland), and Riversports Rapids (in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma). 
The East Race Waterway is one of only six such facilities to have ever 
been operated in the US, the others being the four aforementioned courses 
and the now-defunct Ocoee Whitewater Center (in Ducktown, Tennessee). Prior 
to the opening of Riversports Rapids, the East Race had long been the only 
such US facility not located in an East Coast state. During World War II, 
the South Bend Blue Sox All-American Girls Professional Baseball League 
team was formed in the city. The team participated in all the league's 
seasons from 1943 to 1954.[97] High-school sports are also a big draw in 
South Bend. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish provide much of the sports action 
for the South Bend locale. Football Saturdays have become a major event 
for the city, attracting fans who come to watch the game and have tailgate 
parties.[25] Notre Dame basketball games are also popular, along with other 
university sports. The College Football Hall of Fame was moved from Kings 
Mills, Ohio, to downtown South Bend in 1995, though the Hall of Fame relocated 
to Atlanta, Georgia in 2014.[98] The Blackthorn Golf Course in South Bend 
is home to the Four Winds Invitational of the Symetra Tour.[99] Along with 
Notre Dame, South Bend was the site of the VII Special Olympics Summer 
World Games in 1987. Notre Dame also hosted the 1983 AAU Junior Olympics. 
The Potawatomi Zoo opened in 1902 and is the oldest in the state. It was 
originally founded in Leeper Park and was moved to its current location 
in Potawatomi Park in 1912.[100] It features more than 400 animals in its 
23 acres (93,000 m2). The zoo is run by the South Bend Parks and Recreation 
Department.[101] Along with the zoo, the South Bend Parks and Recreation 
department operates over 50 parks, golf courses, and recreational areas 
throughout the city.[102] Notable parks include Rum Village Park, which 
has a disc golf course, mountain bike trails, hiking trails, and a nature 
center,[103] and Potawatomi Park, which has the region's largest Universally 
Accessible Playground and an outdoors Performance Arts Pavilion and viewing 
area.[104] Near the Potawatomi Zoo are the Potawatomi Greenhouses and the 
Ella Morris and Muessel-Ellison Botanical Conservatories. The greenhouses 
were originally constructed in the 1920s, with the conservatories added 
in the 1960s.[105] In 2007, the greenhouses and conservatories were in 
danger of closing due to increased operating costs, but a campaign by the 
Botanical Society of South Bend was able to raise funds to keep the facilities 
operating.[106] The city is home to the East Race Waterway, which is used 
for boating and water sports (see above).[106] While developing the 2006 
City Plan, the city's 20-year comprehensive plan, citizens said the encouragement 
of bicycling as a form of alternative transportation was a top priority. 
In 2010, South Bend became one of 303 communities in the United States 
to be recognized as a "Bicycle-Friendly Community" by the League of American 
Bicyclists due to the city's "remarkable commitments to bicycling.[107] 
The city has developed a long-term plan for building a 116-mile South Bend 
Bikeway network. As of late 2014, 66.8 miles of bicycle routes have been 
established: 17.4 miles of multipurpose paths separated from streets, 17.0 
miles of striped bike lanes, and 32.4 other designated on-street routes.[108] 
The area is also served by the St. Joseph County Parks Dept, which maintains 
eight different parks and recreation areas. The Parks department serves 
the metro area and is headed by a permanent staff (Director- Evie Kirkwood) 
and an appointed Board (Larry Catanzarite - President) South Bend government 
follows the mayor-council representative model of municipal government 
and, along with the St. Joseph county government, occupies the County-City 
Building in downtown South Bend. The government of South Bend is led by 
the office of the mayor, who is elected to a four-year term and acts as 
chief executive for the city government. The current mayor is Pete Buttigieg. 
The legislative branch of the South Bend government is the Common Council. 
The council is composed of nine members, each elected to a four-year term. 
South Bend is divided into six districts, with each district electing one 
council member. The final three members are elected at-large. Under Indiana 
law, the council may pass resolutions and ordinances.Resolutions relate 
to internal council procedures, while ordinances address municipal codes.[109] 
The final elected member of the South Bend government is the City Clerk, 
who is responsible for maintaining official city records and providing 
general clerical assistance to the City Council.[110] Michael A. Dvorak 
is the Prosecuting Attorney for the 60th Judicial Circuit, which consists 
of St. Joseph County. He was first elected in 2002.[citation needed] South 
Bend is represented in the Indiana House of Representatives by B. Patrick 
Bauer, David L. Niezgodski, and Ryan Dvorak, and in the Indiana State Senate 
by John Broden. All members of the Indiana General Assembly representing 
South Bend are Democrats. South Bend is part of Indiana's 2nd Congressional 
District, represented by Republican Jackie Walorski. The Democratic Party 
is very successful in South Bend. Every South Bend mayor since 1972 has 
been a Democrat.[111] As of July 2015, all but one City Council member 
are Democrats.[112] On March 26, 2012, South Bend passed the Human Rights 
Ordinance, outlawing discrimination in employment, housing, or other areas 
against citizens based on "race, religion, color, sex, disability, national 
origin, ancestry, sexual orientation or gender identity, or familial status."[113] 
It is one of only 6 cities in Indiana to offer legal protections for citizens 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity.[114] The protections are 
enforced by the city's Human Rights Commission, which oversees investigation 
and legal recourse in cases of discrimination.[115] In July 2014, South 
Bend Common Council member Henry Davis Jr. was arrested on an OWI charge.[116] 
Davis was previously subject to a formal complaint about a Facebook post 
involving bestiality.[117] On June 16, 2015, incumbent Mayor Pete Buttigieg 
announced in a South Bend Tribune editorial that he is gay, becoming the 
first openly-gay executive in the state of Indiana.[118][119] The police 
force in South Bend has undergone many changes and expansions in its history, 
starting in 1831 when the first constables were appointed. Law enforcement 
was reorganized and renamed multiple times throughout its history, until 
the department became officially known as the South Bend Police Department 
in 1903.[120] The current Chief of Police is Scott Ruszkowski.[121] The 
South Bend area is home to several institutions of higher learning, the 
most famous of which is the University of Notre Dame. Located to the north 
of South Bend in Notre Dame, Indiana, the University of Notre Dame was 
founded in 1842 by Father Edward Sorin, a French priest, before South Bend 
was incorporated as a city in 1865. It has been an intrinsic part of the 
South Bend area and continues to have a great effect on South Bend's culture 
and economy. Saint Mary's College and Holy Cross College are also located 
in nearby Notre Dame, IN. Indiana University South Bend is the third-largest 
campus in the Indiana University system. Its total enrollment during the

South Bend's location around the St. Joseph River has influenced the development 
of its streets. While city streets mainly follow a grid layout, road development 
also adapted to the river's path. South Bend is connected to state and 
national highway systems by State Roads 2, 23, and 933; U.S. Route 20 and 
31; and Interstate 80 and 90, the Indiana Toll Road. Original routes of 
both the Lincoln Highway and the Dixie Highway also pass through South 
Bend. The headquarters for the Lincoln Highway Association are in South 
Bend.[131] For transportation around the South Bend metro area, the St. 
Joseph Valley Parkway, constructed between 1960 and 1990, connects Benton 
Harbor, Michigan, to South Bend, Mishawaka, and Elkhart, Indiana. While 
segments are designated as U.S. 20, U.S. 31, and State Road 331, it is 
simply referred to locally as "the bypass".[132] The Indiana Toll Road 
(Interstates 80 and 90) passes through northern South Bend. Public transportation 
in South Bend is controlled by TRANSPO (South Bend Public Transportation 
Corporation). TRANSPO operates bus routes between stations located in South 
Bend and Mishawaka and provides services to the towns of Osceola and Roseland, 
from Monday through Saturday.[133] In 2006, the TRANSPO fleet switched 
to bio-diesel fuel. In 2015, TRANSPO added 16 new buses powered by compressed 
natural gas. The TRANSPO facility is also the first LEED Platinum transit 
facility in the country.[134] South Bend serves as the transportation hub 
for Michiana. The South Bend International Airport lies off of U.S. 31 
and the Indiana Toll Road in the northwest corner of South Bend. The airport 
connects South Bend to larger hubs including Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, 
Las Vegas, Minneapolis, New York City, Orlando, Phoenix, and St. Petersburg, 
Florida. In April 2014, the airport changed its name from "South Bend Regional 
Airport" to the current "South Bend International" after receiving International 
designation from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.[135] Final design 
plans are being approved for a Federal Inspection Station and General Aviation 
Facility.[136] Construction is expected to begin in the fall of 2015. The 
South Shore Line, an electric commuter railroad, connects the South Bend 
International Airport to Millennium Station in downtown Chicago. Due to 
increased ridership since 2005 between Chicago and South Bend, more cars 
are being added. Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service 
to South Bend Station via two trains, the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago, 
New York City, and Boston, and the Capitol Limited to Chicago and Washington, 
D.C. A bus line connects Notre Dame and the South Bend airport to Chicago's 
O'Hare and Midway airports, with several northwest Indiana stops.[137] 
Electricity in South Bend is provided by Indiana Michigan Power, a subsidiary 
of American Electric Power.[139] Natural gas is supplied by the Northern 
Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO).[140] The South Bend Water Works 
delivers water to residents of South Bend. The water is collected from 
32 deep wells and runs through 545 miles (877 km) of water main to be distributed 
to South Bend residents.[141] In 2008, in order to increase the efficiency 
of its sewer system, South Bend began the installation of an array of intelligent 
sensors and valves allowing it to become the first city to migrate its 
sewer system management to the cloud. When a section of the system is under 
heavy use, this system can divert flow to other, less busy, sections. Via 
more efficient sewage management this system has helped to save the city 
an estimated 100 million dollars in new sewage pipes.[142] South Bend has 
recently engaged in a partnership with the University of Notre Dame to 
revitalize the Bowman Creek ecosystem. Bowman Creek is a tributary of the 
St. Joseph River in South Bend, Indiana that has recently suffered from 
contamination. The Bowman Creek initiative included partners from local 
high schools, colleges, and business leaders focused on improvements to 
both the creek and the neighborhoods. The vision for the collaboration 
is to institute a unique water quality monitoring system, similar to South 
Bend's combined sewer overflow system.[143] South Bend has three sister
