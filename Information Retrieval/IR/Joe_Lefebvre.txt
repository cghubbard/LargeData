Joseph Henry Lefebvre (born February 22, 1956) is a former American professional 
baseball player and coach. He played all or part of six seasons in Major 
League Baseball with the New York Yankees (1980), San Diego Padres (1981–83) 
and Philadelphia Phillies (1983–84 and 1986), primarily as an outfielder. 
He currently serves as senior advisor for scouting for the San Francisco 
Giants.[1] Lefebvre attended Concord High School and Eckerd College, playing 
with future Giants general manager Brian Sabean at both schools.[2] Lefebvre 
was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 3rd round of the 1977 draft 
on the advice of scout Andy Michael. He began his professional career with 
the Fort Lauderdale Yankees, and by the end of 1977 he had already been 
promoted to the Double-A West Haven Yankees. He continued to play for West 
Haven in 1978, batting .266 with 19 home runs while splitting time between 
the outfield and third base. Lefebvre returned to West Haven in 1979, where 
he produced a breakout season. He led the Eastern League champion Yankees 
in all three triple crown categories, batting .292 with 21 home runs and 
107 RBI.[3] In 1980, he was promoted to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers, 
and was called up to the majors in mid-May. The Yankees had lost regular 
center fielder Ruppert Jones to injury, and Lefebvre was summoned from 
the minor leagues to replace him. Right fielder Bobby Brown was moved to 
center, and Lefebvre was installed in right. In his first major league 
game, he hit a home run off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave Stieb. Lefebvre 
continued to start on and off for the next few weeks, playing both right 
and left field, sharing time in the outfield with Reggie Jackson and Bobby 
Murcer. Although he hit well, batting .261 with 8 home runs in 38 games, 
he was returned to the minor leagues when Jones was activated. He returned 
in mid-August, but was used mostly as a defensive replacement down the 
stretch for the American League East champions. His only appearance in 
the ALCS was in the 9th inning of game 3, when he went out to left field 
to replace Lou Piniella, who had been pinch-hit for by Jim Spencer.[4] 
Lefebvre looked to have a good chance at breaking camp with the Yankees 
in 1981, but with just a few days left in spring training he was traded 
to the San Diego Padres along with Ruppert Jones and two pitchers for John 
Pacella and Jerry Mumphrey, who was tabbed as the Yankees' new starting 
center fielder. Instead of playing in New York, Lefebvre wound up being 
the Padres' starting right fielder. Although he often sat against left-handed 
pitchers in favor of Dave Edwards, Lefebvre played in 86 games, batting 
.256 with 8 home runs and 31 RBI. Prior to the 1982 season, the Padres 
traded shortstop Ozzie Smith and pitcher Steve Mura to the St. Louis Cardinals 
for shortstop Garry Templeton and outfielder Sixto Lezcano. Although Smith-for-Templeton 
made the headlines, it was the acquisition of Lezcano, who would be the 
Padres' regular right fielder, that was significant for Lefebvre, as it 
meant he would be relegated to backup duty. He did not take well to the 
role, as he batted just .157 in 47 games through mid-July, and he was briefly 
sent back to the minor leagues. He batted .344 in eight games, and was 
quickly back in the majors. He spent most of September as the Padres' starting 
third baseman, but he still wound up having what turned out to be his worst 
year, batting just .238 with 4 home runs in 102 games. 1983 started much 
the same for Lefebvre, backing up the outfield of Jones, Lezcano, and Gene 
Richards. During the first few weeks of the season, he was used mostly 
as either a pinch hitter and defensive replacement, starting just two of 
the team's first 38 games.[5] On May 22, the Padres traded him to the Philadelphia 
Phillies for left-handed reliever Sid Monge. The Phillies used Lefebvre 
as something of a super-sub after his acquisition, as he started a number 
of games in both corner outfield positions and at third base, backing up 
Gary Matthews, Von Hayes, and Mike Schmidt. In August, he supplanted Hayes 
as the starting right fielder, and he finished with his best season statistically, 
batting .306 with a career-high 39 RBI along with 8 home runs, as the Phillies 
won the National League East. Against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, 
however, he found himself on the bench behind a familiar face: Sixto Lezcano, 
who had been acquired from the Padres on August 31. The Phillies faced 
left-handed starters, Jerry Reuss and Fernando Valenzuela, in three of 
the four games, and Lefebvre wound up batting just three times in the series, 
driving in one run with a sacrifice fly. A similar situation developed 
in the World Series, as the Baltimore Orioles sent southpaws Scott McGregor 
and Mike Flanagan to the mound in three of the five games. Lefebvre started 
twice, delivering an RBI double in Game 4, as the Phillies lost in five 
games. Lefebvre began the 1984 season as part of a right field platoon 
with Lezcano, getting the lion's share of the playing time as a left-handed 
hitter. He was batting .250 on June 17 when he tore up his knee in a game 
against the Chicago Cubs.[6] After playing briefly for the Reading Phillies 
later in the year, he missed the entire 1985 season, then played just 14 
games for the Phillies in 1986. He retired on May 28, 1986.[6] In 6 seasons 
he played in 447 games and had 1,091 at bats, 139 runs, 281 hits, 52 doubles, 
13 triples, 31 home runs, 130 RBI, 11 stolen bases, 139 walks, .258 batting 
average, .344 on-base percentage, .414 slugging percentage, 452 total bases, 
8 sacrifice hits, 7 sacrifice flies and 22 intentional walks. In 1987, 
Lefebvre was given a coaching job in the Phillies' organization. He remained 
with the Phillies for three seasons, then in 1990 he was brought to the 
Yankees by old friend Sabean, who was working as the team's scouting director. 
He stayed with the Yankees organization from 1990 to 1995, where he served 
as both coach and roving hitting instructor. By 1993, Sabean had moved 
on to the Giants, and in 1996 Lefebvre joined him in their organization, 
where he was hired as hitting coach for the Phoenix Firebirds. From 1997 
to 2001, he served as the team's minor league hitting coordinator, and 
in 2002 he joined the Giants' major league staff as their first base coach 
under manager Dusty Baker.[7] In 2003, he was named the hitting coach under 
Felipe Alou.[7] In November 2007, he moved into the Giants front office 
as a senior advisor for player personnel.[8] He was named to his current 
position of senior scouting advisor in 2011. On August 20, 2011, it was 
announced that Lefebvre would additionally serve as assistant to current 
Giants hitting coach Hensley Meulens.[9] In 2015, Lefebvre stepped down 
as hitting coach and returned to his previous role of senior advisor for
