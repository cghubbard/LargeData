Trevor Vaughan Gott (born August 26, 1992) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He previously played for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Gott 
was born in Lexington, Kentucky. He was a pitcher on the Southeast Lexington 
team that went to the Cal Ripken 12-and-Under World Series in 2005. During 
one game in that series, he struck out nine batters in three innings.[1] 
Gott attended Tates Creek High School. In 2010, a writer with The State 
Journal referred to him as "one of the best pitchers in the state."[2] 
Gott played college baseball at the University of Kentucky for the Wildcats 
from 2011 to 2013. After his freshman year, he pitched in the Cape Cod 
Baseball League, where he was the winner of the Russell Ford Award as the 
leagues reliever of the year.[3][4] As a sophomore in 2012, Gott set the 
Kentucky record for saves in a season with nine.[5] Before the start of 
the 2013 season, Gott had recovered from a minor bout of bursitis and he 
was on the preseason watch list for the NCBWA Stopper of the Year Award.[6] 
That year he broke his own single-season save record, finishing with 12, 
and he also set the school's all-time saves record with 20.[7][8] In early 
2013, Baseball America named Gott as the second-best draft prospect from 
the University of Kentucky behind Corey Littrell.[9] Gott was drafted by 
the San Diego Padres in the sixth round of the 2013 Major League Baseball 
Draft.[10] He signed with the Padres and made his professional debut with 
the Eugene Emeralds.[11] After making four appearances with Eugene, he 
was promoted to the Fort Wayne TinCaps.[12] Gott started 2014 with the 
Lake Elsinore Storm and was named a California League All-Star.[13] He 
was promoted to the Double-A San Antonio Missions in July.[14] On July 
19, 2014, Gott, along with Huston Street, was traded to the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim for Taylor Lindsey, R. J. Alvarez, José Rondón and Elliot 
Morris.[15][16] The Angels sent him to the Arkansas Travelers, where he 
finished the season. He made his MLB debut on June 14, 2015. He later became 
a big part of the Angels' bullpen, when closer Houston Street and Joe Smith 
were both out on injuries. On December 10, 2015, Gott, along with Michael 
Brady, was traded to the Washington Nationals in exchange for Yunel Escobar.[17] 
Gott spent most of the 2016 season in Triple A with the Syracuse Chiefs 
and was called up in September when the rosters were expanded to 40 men.
