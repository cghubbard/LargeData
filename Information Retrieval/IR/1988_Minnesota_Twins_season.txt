The 1988 Minnesota Twins finished a 91-71, second in the AL West. 3,030,672 
fans attended Twins games, at the time, establishing a new major league 
record. Pitcher Allan Anderson had his most successful season in 1988, 
winning the American League ERA title at 2.45 and compiling a record of 
16-9 in 30 starts. Five Twins made the All-Star Game, third baseman Gary 
Gaetti, outfielder Kirby Puckett, catcher Tim Laudner, starting pitcher 
Frank Viola, and relief pitcher Jeff Reardon. On September 16, Puckett 
got his 1000th hit, becoming just the fifth major leaguer to achieve that 
total before completing his fifth year. On September 17, reliever Reardon 
collected his 40th save of the season. With 41 saves as a 1985 Montreal 
Expo, he became the only major league player to reach 40 saves in each 
league. Frank Viola became the first Twins player since Jim Perry in 1970 
to win the AL Cy Young Award. Kirby Puckett hit .356 with 24 HR, drove 
in 121 runs and scored 109. Puckett led the AL with 234 hits, 163 singles, 
and 358 total bases. Puckett's 234 hits were the most by a right-handed 
batter since Joe Medwick had 237 hits in 1937. Kent Hrbek hit .312 with 
25 HR and 76 RBI. Gary Gaetti hit .301 with 28 HR and 88 RBI. The Twins 
had two solid starting pitchers: Frank Viola (24-7), and Allan Anderson 
(16-9). Frank Viola led the AL with 24 wins. Allan Anderson led the AL 
with a 2.45 ERA. Reliever Jeff Reardon had 42 saves. Bert Blyleven (10-17, 
5.43 ERA) led the AL with 17 losses, 125 earned runs allowed, and 16 hit 
batsmen. Third baseman Gary Gaetti and center fielder Kirby Puckett each 
won their third Gold Glove Award. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
