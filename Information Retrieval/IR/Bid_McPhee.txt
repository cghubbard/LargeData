John Alexander "Bid" McPhee (November 1, 1859 – January 3, 1943) was an 
American 19th-century Major League Baseball second baseman. He played 18 
seasons in the majors, from 1882 until 1899, all for the Cincinnati Reds 
franchise. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000. Known more 
for his fielding than his hitting, McPhee was the last second baseman to 
play without a glove.[1] Born in Massena, New York, McPhee broke into professional 
baseball in 1877 as a catcher with the Davenport Brown Stockings of the 
Northwestern League.[2] He played for Davenport for three seasons, shifting 
to second base during the 1879 season.[2] After not playing baseball in 
1880, he joined an independent team in Akron, Ohio in 1881.[2] Before the 
1882 season, he signed a contract to play for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, 
a team in the newly formed American Association.[3] Making his major league 
debut on May 2, 1882, the 22-year-old McPhee had a batting average of just 
.228, but he led the league in several fielding categories, including putouts 
and fielding percentage.[3] With McPhee in the lineup for 78 out of their 
80 games, the Red Stockings won the inaugural AA championship. McPhee was 
the only starting second baseman Cincinnati would have for the first eighteen 
seasons of its existence, accompanying the team to the National League 
in 1890, when they became the Cincinnati Reds. In last two seasons of his 
career, he was the oldest player in the major leagues.[3] Over 18 years, 
McPhee batted .271, hit 53 home runs, hit 188 triples, scored 1678 runs, 
had 1067 RBI, and stole 568 bases. He had ten 100-plus seasons in runs 
scored and regularly led the league in many defensive categories despite 
playing without a glove for the first 14 years of his career. Without the 
benefit of the padding provided by fielding gloves, McPhee toughened his 
hands by soaking them in salt water. Shortly after retiring as a player 
in 1899, McPhee rejoined the Reds as a manager. At the team's helm for 
1901 and part of 1902, he posted 79 wins and 124 losses for a .389 winning 
percentage. McPhee died in 1943. He was cremated and his ashes were interred 
in the mausoleum at Cypress View Memorial Gardens in San Diego. McPhee 
was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000, more than one hundred 
years after he played in his last Major League game. He is the only Hall 
of Famer to spend significant time in the American Association. He is one 
of three Baseball Hall of Famers, along with Johnny Bench and Barry Larkin, 
who played their entire career in Cincinnati. McPhee is also the only Hall 
of Famer who played on the 1882 pennant winning Cincinnati Red Stockings 
team. Two years after his induction into the Hall of Fame, McPhee was inducted
