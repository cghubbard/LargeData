The Columbia University Lions are the collective athletic teams and their 
members from Columbia University, an Ivy League institution in New York 
City, United States. The current director of athletics is Peter Pilling. 
The eight-institution athletic league to which Columbia University belongs, 
the Ivy League, also includes Brown University, Cornell University, Dartmouth 
College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, 
and Yale University. The Ivy League conference sponsors championships in 
33 men's and women's sports and averages 35 varsity teams at each of its 
eight universities. The League provides intercollegiate athletic opportunities 
for more men and women than any other conference in the United States. 
All eight Ivy schools are listed in the top 20 NCAA Division I schools 
in number of sports offered for both men and women. Columbia University 
was founded in 1754 and currently fields 31 co-ed, men’s, and women’s teams. 
Women's teams are cooperatively organized with the affiliated Barnard College.[2] 
All Columbia teams compete at the Division I level in the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (NCAA). The school's football team competes at the 
NCAA Division I FCS level. In 1910, the school adopted the lion mascot 
as a reference to the institution's royal past.[3][4] The University was 
originally named King's College since its charter in 1754 by King George 
II of England. The lion is the animal depicted on the English coat of arms. 
Only after the American Revolution was King's finally renamed Columbia 
University. Intercollegiate sports at Columbia date to the foundation of 
the baseball team in 1867.[5][6] Men's association football (i.e. soccer) 
followed in 1870, and men's crew in 1873. Men's Crew was one of Columbia's 
best early sports, and in 1878 the Columbia College Boat Club was the first 
foreign crew to win a race at the Henley Royal Regatta—considered to be 
Columbia's greatest athletic achievement.[7] The third ever men's intercollegiate 
soccer match was played between Columbia and Rutgers University, with Rutgers 
winning 6 to 3. Columbia joined the American football movement soon after 
Harvard and Yale played their first game in 1875—in 1876, Columbia, Harvard, 
and Princeton University formed the Intercollegiate Football Association.[8] 
In addition, the Lions' wrestling team is the nation's oldest. The Columbia 
football team won the Rose Bowl in 1934, upsetting Stanford University 
7-0. Columbia also hosted the first televised sporting event: on May 17, 
1939, the fledgling NBC network filmed the baseball double-header of the 
Light Blue versus the Princeton University Tigers at Columbia's Baker Field 
at the northernmost point in Manhattan.[9] Columbia was one of the first 
schools to take up the game; Columbia's 1870 contest with Rutgers was the 
fourth intercollegiate football game ever played.[10] The Lions compete 
in the Ivy League, which is part of the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision 
(formerly known as Division I-AA). The football program unfortunately is 
best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 
and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for 
the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. The streak was broken on October 
8, 1988, with a 16-13 victory over archrival Princeton. That was the Lions' 
first victory at Wien Stadium (which was already four years old, having 
been opened during the streak).[11] Even before the streak, the Lions had 
long been regarded as one of the worst football teams in the country. The 
program was much more successful in the first half of the 20th century, 
and was at times a national power. The 1915 squad went undefeated and untied.[12] 
The 1933 edition of the Lions won an unofficial national championship by 
upsetting the top-ranked Stanford Indians 7-0 in the Rose Bowl on New Years 
Day 1934. Lou Little, who coached the team from 1930 to 1956, is in the 
College Football Hall of Fame. Pro Football Hall of Famer Sid Luckman played 
his college ball at Columbia, graduating in 1938. Luckman is also in the 
College Football Hall of Fame.[13] Other Lions to have success in the NFL 
include offensive lineman George Starke, the Washington Redskins' "Head 
Hog," during the 1970s and 1980s, quarterback John Witkowski in the 1980s, 
and defensive lineman Marcellus Wiley in the 1990s. Perhaps the most famous 
personality associated with Lions football was a running back who had limited 
success on the field: the writer Jack Kerouac left school and went on the 
road after one injury-marred season at Columbia. Another Lions back who 
became legendary for his accomplishments off the gridiron was baseball 
great Lou Gehrig, who was a two-sport star at Columbia. Norries Wilson 
is the first African-American head coach in the history of Ivy League football. 
He served as the Lions' head coach from 2005 to 2011. Former Penn Quakers 
football coach Al Bagnoli became Columbia's head coach on February 23, 
2015. Columbia and Cornell play for the Empire Cup, emblematic for Ivy 
League supremacy in New York State. Beginning in 2018 the will play each 
other in their season finale. Beat Dartmouth 9-7 in Homecoming 2016, on 
October 22, 2016. Lou Gehrig played college baseball at Columbia (he joined 
the New York Yankees in 1923, after his sophomore season) as well as Hall 
of Fame inductee Eddie Collins. In 1939 the first live televised sporting 
event in the United States, was a Columbia vs Princeton baseball game, 
broadcast from Baker Field in New York City.[14][15] Other Columbia Lions 
who have gone on to play in Major League Baseball include Gene Larkin and 
Fernando Perez. The team plays at Hal Robertson Field at Phillip Satow 
Stadium, located at the northern tip of Manhattan. Columbia was one of 
the first schools to take up basketball. The Lions' rivalry with the Yale 
Bulldogs is the longest continuous rivalry in NCAA college basketball (tied 
with the Yale-Princeton rivalry): the two teams have played each other 
for 108 seasons in a row, going back to the 1901-1902 season. The Lions 
were retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA Tournament 1904 and 1905 
national champions by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll, and as the 1904, 1905, 
and 1910 national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation.[16] During 
the years just before the Ivy League formally became a sports conference, 
the Lions made it to "March Madness" on two occasions. In 1948, they were 
one of eight teams in the tournament, losing in the East regional semifinal 
to the eventual champion Kentucky. The 1951 team went undefeated in the 
regular season and were one of the 16 teams invited to the championship. 
The Lions lost 79-71 to eventual semi-finalist Illinois for a final record 
of 21-1 (best record in the nation that year with win-loss percentage of 
.956)[17] The 1951 team is, however, sadly best known for the tragic story 
of its brilliant but troubled star forward Jack Molinas, who eventually 
ended up in prison for crimes related his longtime involvement with gambling 
and who was murdered in 1975 in what appeared to be an organized-crime 
related assassination. Molinas still holds several school scoring records. 
In 1957 Chet Forte was a consensus All-American and UPI player of the year 
for NCAA Division I; he averaged 28.9 points (fifth in the nation.) He 
is even more famous for his later work as a producer for ABC Sports, especially 
on the program Monday Night Football.[17] The 1957 team had 2,016 rebounds, 
fourth highest in NCAA Division I history, even though they played only 
24 games.[17] The Lions have only won the official Ivy League championship 
once, in 1968, when they reached the "Sweet Sixteen" in the NCAA national 
tournament. Two members of the 1968 team went on to play professional basketball: 
Jim McMillian and Dave Newmark. (NFL great George Starke was also a member 
of the Lions' basketball team in that era.) Jack Rohan was voted Coach 
of the Year in 1968. The Lions had a powerful squad in the late 1970s, 
even though they never won the Ivy League championship or made it to post-season 
play. In 1979, the diminutive point guard Alton Byrd won the Frances Pomeroy 
Naismith Award, given to the best player under 6 feet in height.[17] Byrd 
never made it to the NBA, but he moved on to a legendary career in European 
pro basketball. Until the 1980s, the women's basketball team (like the 
other women's teams) was known as the Barnard Bears, playing under the 
aegis of Columbia's affiliated undergraduate women's college, Barnard College. 
When Columbia College went co-ed in 1983, the schools formed the Columbia-Barnard 
Athletic Consortium, and today all Barnard athletes compete on Columbia 
teams. The women's basketball team joined the Ivy League in 1986-1987, 
and for many years were a perennial cellar dweller, reaching their low 
point in 1994-1995, when they went 0-26. They had never finished higher 
than fourth in the league standings in their first 23 seasons. In 2009-2010, 
however, they finished third, putting together a 9-5 record in the Ivy 
League, and, at 18-10 overall, their first winning season. Columbia's soccer 
program traces its origins to the same Columbia-Rutgers game that the gridiron 
football program counts as its first contest. (The 1870 Columbia-Rutgers 
game was played by a set of rules which combined elements of present-day 
soccer and rugby.) The Lions soccer team has a long history of success, 
spanning three centuries, highlighted by national collegiate championships 
in 1909 and 1910 (Intercollegiate Soccer Football League), and a second-place 
finish in the 1983 NCAA championship.[18][19] Dieter Ficken was named NSCAA 
Coach of the Year in 1983 after the Lions' 1-0 double-overtime finals loss 
to seven-time champion Indiana University.[19] 18 Lions players have been 
first-team all-Americans, and Amr Aly earned the 1984 Hermann Trophy national 
player of the year award. The women's team was the 2006 Ivy League champions. 
Columbia's first intercollegiate regatta dates back to 1873, when it raced 
a six-oared shell in Springfield, Massachusetts.[26] The next year, Columbia 
won the intercollegiate title at Saratoga.[26] Historical note: 1976 - 
First & only female varsity athlete at Columbia (before Columbia College 
began admitting women): Annemarie McCoy competed against the Lions' opponents.[50] 
Thanks to Title IX, all Columbia University students (including those women 
from The School of Engineering and Applied Science) were eligible for Columbia 
athletic programs—and so McCoy was able to stay afloat with her teammates. 
Dating back to 1903, wrestling has a history at Columbia. Since 2011, Carl 
Fronhofer has been head coach of the Lion Wrestling team which currently 
competes in the EIWA Conference. There has been 19 EIWA Conference Champions 
and 5 NCAA All-Americans, most recently to Matt Palmer who placed 8th in 
05' & 07' and Steve Santos who placed 3rd in 13' at the NCAA Wrestling 
Championships.[54] The Blue Gym (or University Gym) is located within the 
Dodge Physical Fitness Center on campus which is home to the Columbia Lion 
Wrestling team. As of March 27, 2016, Columbia has 15 NCAA team national
