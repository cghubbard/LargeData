Oceanside is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the 
south part of the town of Hempstead, Nassau County, New York. The population 
was 32,109 at the 2010 census.[1] Originally known as South Bay, the English 
government established a township there in 1674 called Christian Hook, 
basing the name on the predominant religious affiliation of colonists in 
the area. Land development proceeded rapidly, and oyster sales took their 
place as a dominant force, with the local business "Mott's Landing" becoming 
a favorite place to buy oysters. In the nineteenth century, the town residents 
decided that "Oceanville" sounded better than "Christian Hook": it was 
"Oceanville Oysters" that sold, and in 1864, the new name became official. 
However, there was already an Oceanville in New York, so "Ocean Side," 
as two words, was adopted as the town's name in 1890 (this despite it not 
actually fronting the Atlantic Ocean, which is located a few miles to the 
south. It is separated from the ocean by Reynolds Channel and other marsh 
islands, as well as the Long Beach Barrier Island). The Oceanside Fire 
Department [2] was established in 1902. Columbia Engine Co. #1, an old 
firehouse, still exists, and is located at the southwest corner of the 
triangle where Lincoln Avenue meets Long Beach Road. In the 1900s, the 
town began rapidly expanding south, building over swamps and marshes and 
dramatically increasing the size of the town from a small port to a large 
hamlet. In 1918, the name was condensed to "Oceanside". Nathan's Famous 
opened its second restaurant on June 4, 1959, on Long Beach Road in Oceanside, 
taking over the site of the once-popular Roadside Rest, which had opened 
several decades before and had offered live entertainment and dancing on 
a large dance floor as well as Nathan's-type frankfurters and locally caught 
seafood.[3] There was a large Nathan's building with play areas and a big 
open dining room that had a stage. Shows were family events. The building 
was razed in 1976, and a strip mall was built in its place. A modern Nathan's 
franchise subsequently opened on a small section of the original property, 
at the corner of Long Beach Road and Windsor Parkway. In 2016, Nathan's 
moved to a smaller location on Long Beach Road.[3] Oceanside, New York, 
was a part of the post-World War II housing boom, with even more land being 
built over with houses and as a result, the town began to resemble Levittown. 
More schools were built as well as massive houses and a public park on 
the swampland. Because of this, Oceanside became more vulnerable to floods 
and natural disasters. This was proven in 2012, when Oceanside saw its 
worst natural disaster when Hurricane Sandy hit the area. The storm completely 
flooded the southern portion of the town with areas a far north as Nathan's 
reporting waves of water Rushing down streets.[4] Sandy also knocked out 
power for nearly two weeks after a substation in the nearby town of Island 
Park exploded. Oceanside was one of the many towns upset with the slow 
response from the Long Island Power Authority and held a rally because 
of it.[5] To this day,[when?] Oceanside still has many who are dealing 
with the consequences of Sandy, and some have begun leaving, with the value 
of houses remaining high. Flooding in low-lying areas would be much more 
common. In 2014, after years of speculation and lack of business, Nathan's 
announced it was moving to a smaller location on the corner of Long Beach 
Road and Merle Avenue (near the former Chwatsky's). This move was greeted 
with controversy as many feared that the traffic from deliveries would 
interfere with the traffic headed to the school during weekdays.[6] Eventually, 
the Town of Hempstead approved this move and The original building was 
officially closed on January 4, 2015. The third Nathan's opened in early 
2015, and was built as a throwback to both the first and second locations 
as well as having a contemporary feel to the interior.[7] In 2016, a massive 
blizzard slammed into the island and dumped nearly 2 feet of snow, and 
flooded many of the towns around it and some portions of the town closest 
to the channel.[8] Oceanside is located at 40°38′11″N 73°38′15″W﻿ / ﻿40.63639°N 
73.63750°W﻿ / 40.63639; -73.63750 (40.636286, -73.637404).[9] The Town 
was built over swampland spanning from the early 1900s to the late 1970s. 
Most of the town before this, was a small sea port near the more established 
villages of Rockville Centre, Baldwin, and East Rockaway. The area of the 
town increased exponentially and its population would boom to nearly 30,000 
people by the end of the 1990s. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the community has a total area of 5.4 square miles (14 km2), of which 5.0 
square miles (13 km2) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2), or 7.38%, 
is water. Long Beach Road, Oceanside Road, Lawson Boulevard and, Atlantic 
Avenue are some of the main roads in Oceanside. Other roads such as Brower 
Avenue and Waukena Avenue, which were built as residential streets, also 
carry major traffic. Sunrise Highway is located along the Northern border 
of the town with RVC and Baldwin. Merrick Road briefly passes through near 
South Nassau Communities Hospital The Long Beach Branch of the Long Island 
Rail Road passes through the west side of Oceanside, with the Oceanside 
station being at Weidner Avenue and Lawson Boulevard. In the northern part 
of Oceanside, many commuters use either the nearby Rockville Centre Station 
or the Baldwin Station on the Babylon Branch. The Nassau Inter-County Express 
Passes through Oceanside via the n4,n15, and n36 routes. Until 2012, the 
n16 also cut through Oceanside, but saw its route shortened due to Budget 
Cuts.[10] There is presently no bus headed for the Oceanside LIRR nor are 
there plans for this.[11] The Bus however, offers service about 0.8 Miles 
away at the East Rockaway station via the n36. As of the 2010 census[12]

of Oceanside and Foxhurst Roads. It only had one room and an attic. The 
structure still stood as of 1960, but was moved and is now a private dwelling. 
The land where the school once stood is now known as the Schoolhouse Green, 
where many school events are held. Oceanside schools have adopted numerical 
names, 1 through 9. School #1 was razed in 1981. Today, Schools #2-5, 8 
and 9E are elementary schools, School #6 is a kindergarten center, School 
#7 is a high school, and #9M serves as the middle school. School #9 bears 
the name of Walter Boardman. Presently, Phyllis Harrington is the superintendent 
of the Oceanside School District. She replaced Dr. Herb Brown, who retired 
at the end of 2012-2013 school year.[15] Nearby colleges include Adelphi 
University, Nassau Community College, Molloy College, Hofstra University, 
New York Institute of Technology, and C.W. Post College. All of Oceanside 
is in New York's 4th congressional district, which is represented by Congresswoman
