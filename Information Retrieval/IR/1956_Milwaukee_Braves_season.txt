The 1956 Milwaukee Braves season was a season in American baseball. The 
Braves finished in second place in the National League, just one game behind 
the Brooklyn Dodgers in the league standings, and one game ahead of the 
Cincinnati Reds. For the 1956 baseball season, the Braves' first manager 
was Charlie Grimm, but the team got off to a mediocre start with a 24–22 
record. At that point, the owners of the Braves dismissed Haney and replaced 
him with Fred Haney, who led the Braves to a 68–40 record for the rest 
of the baseball season. Finishing with an overall 92–62 record, the Braves 
nearly caught up with the Dodgers, who finished the season at 93–61. Haney 
went on to manage the Braves to the World Series in 1957 and 1958, and 
then to a tie atop the National League standings in 1959, tied with the 
Los Angeles Dodgers. In individual performance statistics, outfielder Hank 
Aaron led the league in hits with 200, in batting average at .328, and 
in doubles with 34. His 106 runs scored led the Braves. First baseman Joe 
Adcock led the Braves with 38 home runs and 103 runs batted in. The Braves' 
other hitting star was their third baseman, Eddie Mathews, who played in 
151 games, hit 37 home runs, scored 103 runs, and batted in 95 runs. The 
pitching leaders for the Braves were their "big three" starting pitchers 
(listed with their won-loss records): Warren Spahn (20–11), Lew Burdette 
(19–10), and Bob Buhl (18–8). Spahn also recorded three saves among the 
four games in which he was used as a relief pitcher. Outfielder Bobby Thomson 
also had his best season, out of three, with the Braves, with 142 games 
played, 20 home runs, and 74 runs batted in, but just a .235 batting average. 
Then, the next season, Thomson was traded back to the New York Giants.
