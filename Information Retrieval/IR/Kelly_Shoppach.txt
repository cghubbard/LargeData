League, Shoppach appeared in a career-best 101 games behind the plate for 
Pawtucket and threw out 35 of 101 potential base stealers (34.7 percent)

On January 27, 2006, Shoppach was traded from the Red Sox to the Cleveland 
Indians, along with third base prospect Andy Marte, pitcher Guillermo Mota, 
a player to be named later, and cash considerations. The Indians in turn 
sent outfielder Coco Crisp, catcher Josh Bard, and pitcher David Riske 
to the Red Sox.[4] The Indians received minor league pitcher Randy Newsom 
from the Red Sox to complete the trade.[5] He did better in 2006 after 
the trade. He went 27 for 110.[3] On June 26, 2007, Shoppach hit a pinch-hit 
3-run walk off home run to defeat the Oakland Athletics 8–5. On July 30, 
2008, Shoppach became the second American League player in history, and 
eighth player overall in Major League Baseball, to record five extra-base 
hits in a game. He had three doubles and two home runs (including a game-tying 
HR in the ninth inning) against the Detroit Tigers. He came to bat twice 
in extra innings with a chance to get a sixth extra-base hit, but he was 
intentionally walked in the 10th and struck out in the 12th inning. The 
Indians lost, 14–12, in 13 innings. On April 16, 2009, Shoppach drove in 
the first-ever run at the new Yankee Stadium, his fourth-inning double 
driving in Ben Francisco. On December 1, 2009, Shoppach was traded from 
the Cleveland Indians to the Tampa Bay Rays for pitcher Mitch Talbot.[6] 
On July 26, 2010, Shoppach caught a no hitter thrown by Matt Garza of the 
Tampa Bay Rays. In the 2011 offseason the Rays signed former Red Sox teammates 
Manny Ramirez and Johnny Damon. On September 30, 2011, Shoppach, in the 
first game of the 2011 American League Division Series against the Texas 
Rangers, hit two home runs, accounting for 5 RBIs. On December 13, 2011 
Shoppach signed a 1-year, $1.35 million contract with the Red Sox with 
up to $400K in incentives. He began serving as the backup to Jarrod Saltalamacchia, 
replacing retired Red Sox Captain Jason Varitek and allowing prospect Ryan 
Lavarnway to return to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox to further his minor league 
development.[7] On August 14, 2012, Shoppach was traded from the Red Sox 
to the New York Mets for a player to be named later,[8] later identified
