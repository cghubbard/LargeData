Keith Theodore Olbermann (/ˈoʊlbərmən/; born January 27, 1959) is an American 
sports and political commentator and writer. He is currently the host of 
GQ's political webshow The Closer with Keith Olbermann. Olbermann spent 
the first twenty years of his career in sports journalism. He was a sports 
correspondent for CNN and for local TV and radio stations in the 1980s, 
winning the Best Sportscaster award from the California Associated Press 
three times. He co-hosted ESPN's SportsCenter from 1992 to 1997. From 1998 
to 2001, he was a producer and anchor for Fox Sports Net and a host for 
Fox Sports' coverage of Major League Baseball. From March 2003 to January 
2011, Olbermann hosted the weeknight political commentary program Countdown 
with Keith Olbermann, on MSNBC. He received attention for his pointed criticism 
of right-wing and conservative politicians and public figures.[3][4][5][6][7] 
Though he has frequently been described as a "liberal", he has resisted 
being labelled politically, stating, "I'm not a liberal. I'm an American."[8] 
From 2011 to March 30, 2012, he was the chief news officer of the Current 
TV network and the host of a Current TV program also called Countdown with 
Keith Olbermann.[9][10] From July 2013 until July 2015, he hosted a late-afternoon 
show on ESPN2 and TSN2 called Olbermann[11] as well as TBS's Major League 
Baseball postseason coverage. On September 12, 2016, GQ announced that 
Olbermann would become a special correspondent for the magazine. Olbermann 
hosts a web series for GQ.com titled The Closer with Keith Olbermann which 
covers the 2016 US Presidential Election and other political issues.[12] 
Olbermann was born January 27, 1959, in New York City, to Marie Katherine 
(née Charbonier),[13] a preschool teacher, and Theodore Olbermann, a commercial 
architect.[6] He is of German ancestry.[14] He has one younger sister, 
Jenna, who was born in 1968.[15] Olbermann grew up in a Unitarian household[16] 
in the town of Hastings-on-Hudson[17] in Westchester County, and attended 
Hackley School[6][7] in nearby Tarrytown. Olbermann became a devoted fan 
of baseball at a young age, a love he inherited from his mother, who was 
a lifelong New York Yankees fan.[13] As a teenager, he often wrote about 
baseball card-collecting and appeared in many sports card-collecting periodicals 
of the mid 1970s. He is also referenced in Sports Collectors Bible, a 1979 
book by Bert Sugar, which is considered one of the important early books 
for trading card collectors.[18] While at Hackley, Olbermann began his 
broadcasting career as a play-by-play announcer for WHTR. After graduating 
from Hackley in 1975, Olbermann enrolled at Cornell University at the age 
of 16.[19] At college, Olbermann served as sports director for WVBR, a 
student-run commercial radio station in Ithaca.[19] Olbermann graduated 
from Cornell University's School of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1979 
with a BS in communication.[20][21][22] Olbermann began his professional 
career at UPI and the RKO Radio Network before joining then-nascent CNN 
in 1981. Among the early stories he covered was the 1980 Winter Olympics 
at Lake Placid, including the "Miracle on Ice."[19] In the early-to-mid 
1980s, he was a sportscaster on the old WNEW 1130-AM radio station in New 
York City. In 1984, Olbermann briefly worked as a sports anchor at WCVB-TV 
in Boston before heading to Los Angeles to work at KTLA and KCBS. His work 
there earned him 11 Golden Mike Awards, and he was named best sportscaster 
by the California Associated Press three times.[23] In 1992, Olbermann 
joined ESPN's SportsCenter, a position he held until 1997 with the exception 
of a period from 1993–1994 when he was at ESPN2. He joined ESPN2 as their 
"marquee" personality to help launch the network.[24][25] He often co-hosted 
SportsCenter's 11 PM show with Dan Patrick, the two becoming a popular 
anchor team. In 1995, Olbermann won a Cable ACE award for Best Sportscaster.[20] 
Olbermann later co-authored a book with Patrick called The Big Show about 
their experiences working at SportsCenter; he also said that the short-lived 
ABC dramedy Sports Night was based on his time on SportsCenter with Patrick, 
ABC having been co-owned with ESPN since 1985 (ESPN now produces all sports 
coverage on ABC, which is branded ESPN on ABC).[26] In his last year with 
KCBS before moving east to work for ESPN, Olbermann's salary was $475,000 
but started at "just over $150,000" with ESPN.[27] He made $350,000 at 
the end of his tenure at ESPN.[28] Early in 1997, Olbermann was suspended 
for two weeks after he made an unauthorized appearance on The Daily Show 
on Comedy Central with then host and former ESPN colleague Craig Kilborn. 
At one point in the show, he referred to Bristol, Connecticut (ESPN's headquarters), 
as a "'Godforsaken place."[28] Later that year, Olbermann abruptly left 
ESPN under a cloud of controversy, apparently burning his bridges with 
the network's management;[29] this began a long and drawn-out feud between 
Olbermann and ESPN. Between 1997 and 2007, incidents between the two sides 
included Olbermann's publishing an essay on Salon.com in November 2002 
titled "Mea Culpa" in which he stated: "I couldn't handle the pressure 
of working in daily long-form television, and what was worse, I didn't 
know I couldn't handle it."[30] The essay told of an instance when his 
former bosses remarked he had "too much backbone", a claim that is literally 
true, as Olbermann has six lumbar vertebrae instead of the normal five.[30] 
In 2004, Olbermann was not included in ESPN's guest lineup for its 25th 
anniversary SportsCenter "Reunion Week", which saw Craig Kilborn and Charley 
Steiner return to the SportsCenter set. In 2007, ten years after Olbermann's 
departure, in an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, he said: 
"If you burn a bridge, you can possibly build a new bridge, but if there's 
no river any more, that's a lot of trouble." During the same interview, 
Olbermann stated that he had recently learned that as a result of ESPN's 
agreeing to let him return to the airwaves on ESPN Radio, he was banned 
from ESPN's main (Bristol, Connecticut) campus.[31] In 1998, Olbermann 
joined Fox Sports Net as anchor and executive producer for The Keith Olbermann 
Evening News, a sportscast similar to SportsCenter that aired weekly on 
Sunday evenings. While at Fox, he hosted the 2000 World Series as well 
as Fox Broadcasting's baseball Game of the Week. In May and July 1999, 
Olbermann also guest-starred ten times on Hollywood Squares.[32] According 
to Olbermann, he was demoted by Fox when he asked for a slight reduction 
in duties for health reasons, and then was fired from Fox in 2001 after 
reporting on rumors that Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox, 
was planning on selling the Los Angeles Dodgers.[33] Olbermann characterized 
the demotion as "blackmail."[34] When asked about Olbermann, Murdoch said: 
"I fired him...He's crazy."[35][36] In 2004, Olbermann remarked, "Fox Sports 
was an infant trying to stand [in comparison to ESPN], but on the broadcast 
side there was no comparison—ESPN was the bush leagues."[19] After Olbermann 
left Fox Sports in 2001, he provided twice-daily sports commentary on the 
ABC Radio Network, reviving the "Speaking of Sports" and "Speaking of Everything" 
segments begun by Howard Cosell.[37] In 2005, Olbermann made a return to 
ESPN Radio when he began co-hosting an hour of the syndicated Dan Patrick 
Show on ESPN Radio, a tenure that lasted until Patrick left ESPN on August 
17, 2007.[38] Olbermann and Patrick referred to this segment as "The Big 
Show", just as their book was known. Patrick often introduced Olbermann 
with the tagline "saving the democracy", a nod to his work on Countdown. 
On April 16, 2007, Olbermann was named co-host of Football Night in America, 
NBC's NFL pre-game show that precedes their Sunday Night NFL game, a position 
which reunited him in 2008 with his former SportsCenter co-anchor Dan Patrick. 
Olbermann left the show prior to the start of the 2010 season.[39] Shortly 
before rejoining ESPN, Olbermann signed a contract with TBS to host the 
studio show portions of its coverage of the Division Series and National 
League Championship Series. He replaced Matt Winer, who had been in this 
role since his departure from ESPN to join the Turner Sports family, and 
was originally supposed to host the show with TBS' Dennis Eckersley. Instead, 
Eckersley was sent to join Don Orsillo and Buck Martinez to call the Detroit-Oakland 
series. TBS later hired Dirk Hayhurst, Pedro Martínez, and Mark DeRosa 
to provide analysis. Tom Verducci also joined the studio crew, as he was 
replaced by Rachel Nichols as a field reporter.[40] It was announced on 
July 17, 2013, Olbermann will host his own one-hour nightly show on ESPN2. 
The two-year contract allows him to deviate from the topic of sports, into 
realms such as "pop culture and current events,"[41] as well as politics 
(a right Olbermann claims he doesn't intend to exercise).[42] Olbermann 
was suspended by ESPN in 2015 for the week following Penn State University's 
annual philanthropy THON due to a Twitter exchange he had with Penn State 
supporters.[43] In the Twitter exchange, Olbermann stated, "PSU students 
are pitiful." Later, prior to apologizing, Olbermann stated, "I'd like 
to thank the students and alums of Penn State for proving my point about 
the mediocrity of their education and ethics." [44][45][46][47] Olbermann 
apologized on his program upon his return March 2 but noted, "I'm much 
more sorry about batting practice [i.e. trolling or cyber bullying]. So 
for me, batting practice ends."[48] In July 2015, ESPN announced that this 
would be Olbermann's last month with the network. ESPN said that it was 
a "business decision to move in another direction".[49] In 2016, Olbermann 
wrote an article for Bill Simmons' company "The Ringer" after Muhammad 
Ali's death.[50] In 1997, Olbermann left ESPN to host a primetime show 
on MSNBC, The Big Show with Keith Olbermann (ESPN objected to the use of 
the title).[28] The news-driven program, with substantial discussion, relied 
on Olbermann to carry the 8 to 9 PM hour.[28] The show typically covered 
three or four topics in a one-hour broadcast. Olbermann also hosted two 
Sunday editions of NBC Nightly News and once co-anchored a Saturday edition 
of the Today show.[51][52] During that period, Olbermann along with Hannah 
Storm, also co-hosted NBC Sports' pre-game coverage of the MLB 1997 World 
Series. Olbermann became frustrated as his show was consumed by the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal. In 1998, he stated that his work at MSNBC would "make 
me ashamed, make me depressed, make me cry."[29] Olbermann left MSNBC for 
Fox Sports Net shortly thereafter. After leaving Fox Sports in 2001, Olbermann 
returned once more to news journalism. In 2003, his network won an Edward 
R. Murrow Award for writing on the "Keith Olbermann Speaking of Everything" 
show. In addition, Olbermann wrote a weekly column for Salon.com from July 
2002 until early 2003,[53] worked for CNN as a freelance reporter,[19] 
and was a fill-in for newscaster Paul Harvey.[54][55] Olbermann revived 
his association with MSNBC in 2003 briefly as a substitute host on Nachman 
and as an anchor for the network's coverage of the war in Iraq. Olbermann's 
own show, Countdown, debuted on March 31, 2003, in the 8 p.m. ET time slot 
previously held by programs hosted by Phil Donahue and, briefly, Lester 
Holt. Countdown's format, per its name, involved Olbermann ranking the 
five biggest news stories of the day or sometimes "stories my producers 
force me to cover", as Olbermann put it. This was done in numerically reverse 
order, counting down with the first story shown being ranked fifth but 
apparently the most important. The first few stories shown were typically 
oriented toward government, politics, and world events; the segments ranked 
numbers two and one were typically of a lighter fare than the preceding 
segments. These lighter stories sometimes involved celebrities, sports, 
and, regularly and somewhere in the middle, the bizarre, in a segment he 
called "Oddball." Opinions on each were offered by Olbermann and guests 
interviewed during the segment. Olbermann had been criticized for only 
having guests that agree with his perspective. Former Los Angeles Times 
television critic Howard Rosenberg stated that "Countdown is more or less 
an echo chamber in which Olbermann and like-minded bobbleheads nod at each 
other."[56] On October 13, 2004, Olbermann launched Bloggermann, his Countdown 
blog, hosted on MSNBC.com.[57] Olbermann used the open format of the blog 
to expand on facts or ideas alluded to in the broadcast, to offer personal 
musings and reactions. However, in February 2007, Olbermann launched a 
new blog, The News Hole. In a technique similar to that of former CBS News 
anchor Walter Cronkite in connection to the Iran Hostage Crisis,[58] for 
the last six years of the program, Olbermann closed every show by announcing 
the number of days passed since President George W. Bush had declared the 
end of "major combat operations" in Iraq under a banner that read "Mission 
Accomplished" (May 1, 2003). Olbermann would then crumple up his notes, 
throwing them at the camera and saying "Good night and good luck", echoing 
another former CBS newsman, Edward R. Murrow. (Yet Olbermann himself discounted 
this gesture to his hero as "presumptuous" and a "feeble tribute.")[59] 
On February 16, 2007, MSNBC reported that Olbermann had signed a four-year 
extension on his contract with MSNBC for Countdown which also provided 
for his hosting of two Countdown specials a year to be aired on NBC as 
well as for his occasional contribution of essays on NBC's Nightly News 
with Brian Williams.[60] Olbermann co-anchored, with Chris Matthews, MSNBC's 
coverage of the death of fellow NBC News employee Tim Russert on June 13, 
2008.[61] He presented a tribute, along with several fellow journalists, 
in honor of Russert.[62] During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Olbermann 
co-anchored MSNBC's coverage with Chris Matthews until September 7, 2008, 
when they were replaced by David Gregory after complaints from both outside 
and inside of NBC that they were making partisan statements.[63] This apparent 
conflict of interest had been an issue as early as May 2007, when Giuliani 
campaign officials complained about his serving in dual roles, as both 
a host and a commentator.[64] Despite this, Countdown was broadcast both 
before and after each of the presidential and vice-presidential debates, 
and Olbermann and Matthews joined Gregory on MSNBC's Election Day coverage.[65] 
Olbermann and Matthews also led MSNBC's coverage of the inauguration of 
President Barack Obama.[66][67] In November 2008, it was announced that 
Olbermann had signed a four-year contract extension worth an estimated 
$30 million.[68] Since beginning Countdown's "Worst Person in the World" 
segment in July 2005, Olbermann repeatedly awarded Bill O'Reilly, host 
of The O'Reilly Factor on Fox News Channel, the dubious honor.[3] The feud 
between the anchors originated with Olbermann's extensive coverage of a 
2004 sexual harassment suit brought against O'Reilly by former Fox News 
Channel producer Andrea Mackris during which Olbermann asked Countdown 
viewers to fund the purchase of lurid audio tapes allegedly held by Mackris.[69][70] 
In 2008 O'Reilly decided to avoid mentioning Olbermann's name on the air, 
and once cut off a caller who mentioned Olbermann.[71] O'Reilly has also 
criticized MSNBC's news commentary and political coverage without ever 
specifically mentioning Olbermann.[3][72][73] The rivalry continued when 
in 2006 at Television Critics' Association in California, Olbermann donned 
a mask of O'Reilly and made a Nazi salute, leading to a letter of protest 
from the Anti-Defamation League.[74][75][76] In an article on "perhaps 
the fiercest media feud of the decade", the New York Times' Brian Stelter 
noted that in early June 2009 the "combat" between the two hosts seemed 
to have abruptly ended as a result of instructions filtered down to Olbermann 
and O'Reilly from the chief executives of their respective networks.[77] 
On the edition of August 3, 2009 of Countdown, Olbermann asserted that 
he had made statements to Stelter before the article was published denying 
that he was a party to such a deal, or that there was such a deal between 
NBC and Fox News, or that any NBC executive had asked him to change Countdown's 
content. Olbermann maintained that he had stopped joking about O'Reilly 
because of O'Reilly's attacks of George Tiller, and soon resumed his criticism 
of O'Reilly.[78] On October 28, 2010, days before the 2010 U.S. elections, 
Olbermann donated $2,400 each to three Democratic candidates for Congress: 
Kentucky Senate candidate Jack Conway, and Arizona Democratic Representatives 
Raul Grijalva and Gabrielle Giffords.[79] Grijalva had appeared on Olbermann's 
show immediately before Olbermann mailed the donations. In response, on 
November 5, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended him indefinitely without 
pay for violating a network policy which required employees to obtain approval 
from management before making political contributions.[80][81] An online 
petition calling for his reinstatement received over 250,000 signatures;[82] 
two days after the suspension began, Griffin announced that Olbermann would 
return to the air on November 9.[82] On January 21, 2011, Olbermann announced 
his departure from MSNBC and that the episode would be the final episode 
of Countdown.[83][84] MSNBC issued a statement that it had ended its contract 
with Olbermann, with no further explanation. Additional reporting in the 
days immediately following suggested that the negotiations for the end 
of Olbermann's tenure at MSNBC had begun soon after the end of his suspension.[85] 
On February 8, 2011, it was announced that Olbermann had taken the position 
of chief news officer for the Al Gore/Joel Hyatt–owned public affairs channel 
Current TV and would begin hosting a one-hour prime time program on the 
network at 8 PM Eastern – the same time slot that Countdown had been on 
MSNBC.[86][87] On April 26, 2011 it was announced that Olbermann's new 
show would debut on June 20 and would be named Countdown with Keith Olbermann.[88] 
Olbermann was also heavily involved in the development of the rest of the 
network's news programming.[89] The deal also included an equity stake 
in Current TV.[90] During the interim between shows, Olbermann launched 
an "official not-for-profit" blog called FOKNewsChannel.com, "FOK" being 
an abbreviation for "Friends of Keith". The blog featured political commentaries 
by Olbermann—including viral video versions of Countdown's "Special Comment" 
and "Worst Person" segments, as well as photographs of his outings at professional 
baseball games.[91] On May 29, 2011, the FOKNewsChannel.com domain redirected 
to the Current website promoting the June 20 launch.[92] Olbermann was 
fired from Current TV on March 30, 2012. In a statement from Current TV, 
they stated that "Current was [...] founded on the values of respect, openness, 
collegiality, and loyalty to our viewers. Unfortunately these values are 
no longer reflected in our relationship with Keith Olbermann and we have 
ended it." Olbermann released his own statement, apologizing for "the failure 
of Current TV" and "that the claims against me implied in Current's statement 
are untrue and will be proved so in the legal actions I will be filing 
against them presently."[93] The two parties sued each other over Olbermann's 
firing. On March 12, 2013, it was announced that Olbermann settled his 
$50 million legal claim. In a joint statement, Olbermann and Current TV 
said: "The parties are pleased to announce that a settlement has occurred, 
and that the terms are confidential. Nothing more will be disclosed regarding 
the settlement."[94] His show was replaced by a show hosted by Eliot Spitzer.[95] 
Olbermann has twice been a guest on This Week as a roundtable participant 
since departing Current  – on Sunday, April 22, 2012, and again on Sunday, 
July 1, 2012. On September 12, 2016, GQ magazine announced that Olbermann 
start hosting a web series, covering the 2016 US Presidential Election. 
The series, titled The Closer with Keith Olbermann, airs twice weekly on 
GQ.com.[12] Olbermann has made several acting appearances either as himself 
or simply as a sports/newscaster, most notably as Tom Jumbo-Grumbo (a blue 
whale newscaster on the MSNBSea network) in several episodes of BoJack 
Horseman.[96][97][98] Although it began as a traditional newscast, Countdown 
with Keith Olbermann eventually adopted an opinion-oriented format. In 
a Countdown interview with Al Franken on October 25, 2005, Olbermann noted 
that in 2003, after having Janeane Garofalo and Franken on his show, a 
vice president of MSNBC had questioned him on inviting "liberals" on consecutive 
nights, contrasting that occurrence to the apparent ideological latitude 
he enjoyed at the time of the second Franken interview.[99] In January 
2007 The Washington Post's Howard Kurtz wrote that Olbermann was "position[ing] 
his program as an increasingly liberal alternative to The O'Reilly Factor."[100] 
Much of the program featured harsh criticism of prominent Republicans and 
right-leaning figures, including those who worked for or supported the 
George W. Bush Administration, 2008 Republican presidential nominee Senator 
John McCain and running mate Governor Sarah Palin,[63][101] and rival news 
commentator Bill O'Reilly, whom Olbermann has routinely dubbed the "Worst 
Person in the World".[4] During the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, Olbermann 
frequently chastised presidential aspirant Hillary Clinton for her campaign 
tactics against her principal opponent, Senator Barack Obama, and made 
her the subject of two of his "special comments".[102][103] Olbermann has 
also posted on the liberal blog Daily Kos.[104] In November 2007, British 
newspaper The Daily Telegraph placed Olbermann at #67 on their Top 100 
list of most influential US liberals. It said that he used his MSNBC show 
to promote "an increasingly strident liberal agenda." It added that he 
would be "a force on the Left for some time to come."[105] Avoiding ideological 
self-labeling, Olbermann described his reporting in 2006 to Salon.com, 
"I don't think in these issues that I'm a liberal; I think that I'm an 
American. I think I'm acting almost as a historian on these particular 
things".[4] Before the 2010 Massachusetts special election, Olbermann called 
Republican candidate Scott Brown "an irresponsible, homophobic, racist, 
reactionary, ex-nude model, Tea Bagging supporter of violence against women, 
and against politicians with whom he disagrees".[106] This was criticized 
by his colleague Joe Scarborough, who called the comments "reckless" and 
"sad".[107] Yael T. Abouhalkah of the Kansas City Star said that Olbermann 
"crossed the line in a major way with his comments".[108] The next night, 
Olbermann chose to "double down", as The Huffington Post's Danny Shea described 
it,[109] on his criticism of Brown by adding the word "sexist" to his original 
description of the Republican candidate. Jon Stewart criticized Olbermann 
about this attack on his show, The Daily Show, by noting that it was "the 
harshest description of anyone I've ever heard uttered on MSNBC". Following 
Stewart's critique, Olbermann apologized by noting, "I have been a little 
over the top lately. Point taken. Sorry."[109] He has accused the Tea Party 
movement of being racist due to what he views as a lack of racial diversity 
at the events, using photos that show overwhelmingly Caucasian crowds attending 
the rallies. In response, the Dallas Tea Party invited Olbermann to attend 
one of their events and also criticized his network for a lack of racial 
diversity, pointing out that an online banner of MSNBC personalities that 
appears on the website shows only white personalities. Olbermann declined 
the invitation, citing his father's prolonged ill health and hospitalization 
and stated that the network has minority anchors, contributors and guests.[110] 
In Olbermann's "Special Comment" segment on July 3, 2007, he called President 
George W. Bush's commutation of Lewis "Scooter" Libby's prison sentence 
the "last straw" and called for the resignation of Bush and Vice President 
Dick Cheney.[111] On his February 14, 2008 "Special Comments" segment, 
Olbermann castigated Bush for threatening to veto an extension of the Protect 
America Act unless it provided full immunity from lawsuits to telecom companies.[112] 
During the same commentary, Olbermann called Bush a fascist.[112] In a 
special comment on May 14, 2008, Olbermann criticized Bush for announcing 
that he had stopped playing golf in honor of American soldiers who died 
in the Iraq war. He stated that Bush never should have started the war 
in the first place, and he accused Bush of dishonesty and war crimes.[6] 
In June 2006, Olbermann began dating current NBC News reporter Katy Tur.[7][113] 
According to Mediaite, the couple broke up in 2009 after three years of 
living together.[114] Olbermann suffers from a mild case of coeliac disease,[115] 
as well as restless legs syndrome.[6] In August 1980, he also suffered 
a head injury while leaping onto a New York City Subway train.[116] This 
head injury permanently upset his equilibrium, resulting in his avoidance 
of driving.[6] Along with Bob Costas, he supports the Multiple Myeloma 
Research Foundation as an honorary board member.[117] Olbermann's father, 
Theodore, died on March 13, 2010 of complications from colon surgery the 
previous September. His mother had died several months before.[118] Olbermann 
had cited the need to spend time with his father for taking a leave of 
absence shortly before his father's death, occasionally recording segments 
to air at the beginning of the shows which Lawrence O'Donnell guest hosted 
in his absence, giving his views on the state of the American health care 
system and updating viewers on his father's condition.[119] Olbermann is 
a dedicated baseball fan and historian of the sport, with membership in 
the Society for American Baseball Research.[120] In 1973, when he was only 
14 years old, The Card Memorabilia Associates (TCMA) published his book 
The Major League Coaches: 1921–1973. The September issue of Beckett Sports 
Collectibles Vintage included a T206 card that depicted Olbermann in a 
1905-era New York Giants uniform.[121] He argues that New York Giants baseball 
player Fred Merkle has been unduly criticized for his infamous baserunning 
mistake.[122][a] He contributed the foreword to More Than Merkle (ISBN 
0-8032-1056-6), a book requesting amnesty for "Merkle's Boner". Olbermann 
was also one of the founders of the first experts' fantasy baseball league, 
the USA Today Baseball Weekly League of Alternative Baseball Reality, and 
he gave the league its nickname "LABR".[123] Olbermann wrote the foreword 
to the 2009 Baseball Prospectus Annual.[124] In March 2009, Olbermann began 
a baseball-related blog entitled Baseball Nerd. He has also written a series
