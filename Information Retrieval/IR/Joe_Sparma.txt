Joseph Blase Sparma (February 4, 1942 – May 14, 1986) was a quarterback 
in collegiate football (1961–1962) and a pitcher in Major League Baseball 
(1964–1970). Born in Massillon, Ohio, Sparma attended Ohio State University 
and played quarterback on the 1961 and 1962 football teams coached by Woody 
Hayes. Sparma and his leading receiver, Paul Warfield, led the 1961 Buckeyes 
to an 8-0-1 season and a Big Ten Conference championship[1][2] Sparma accounted 
for 474 yards in the Buckeyes' 1961 50-20 victory over the Michigan Wolverines. 
Sparma quit the team after three years due to differences with Hayes and 
opted to pursue a career in Major League Baseball.[3] Sparma received a 
$32,000 bonus to sign with the Detroit Tigers in 1963. He played six seasons 
with Detroit, from 1964-1969. In 1965, Sparma was in his first full season 
with the Tigers, when he was assigned to be the starting pitcher against 
the Yankees on "Mickey Mantle Day" in New York. When Mantle came to bat 
for the first time in the game, Sparma walked off the mound, approached 
Mantle, and said: "You know, I've never had a chance to meet you in person, 
and I've always admired you." Sparma and Mantle shook hands, and Sparma 
went back to the mound and struck Mantle out. Mantle turned to Detroit's 
catcher Bill Freehan and said: "They have a day for me and your manager's 
got to put some hard-throwing kid out there. Couldn't he have put in some 
soft-tossing left-hander for me to hit off of, so I could look like a hero 
in front of all those people?" (Bill Freehan, "Behind the Mask" (1970), 
pp. 7–8) Sparma's best season was 1967, when he posted a record of 16-9 
with 11 complete games, five shutouts, and a 3.76 ERA. In 1968, Sparma 
lost his spot in the rotation after a run-in with manager Mayo Smith.[3] 
Sparma was pulled from a game and told Detroit sportswriter Joe Falls that 
Smith "had no respect for him; didn't like him, didn't trust him, etc., 
etc." When Falls asked Smith for a response, Smith said he "didn't want 
to get into a spitting contest with a skunk." (Joe Falls, Joe Falls 50 
Years of Sports Writing (Sports Publishing 1997), p. 159.) Smith refused 
to start Sparma for several weeks afterward. When Sparma finally got another 
start on September 17, he pitched a one-run, complete game win against 
the Yankees to clinch the Tigers' first pennant since 1945.[3] The Sparma-Smith 
feud continued, and Sparma pitched only 1/3 of an inning in the 1968 World 
Series, giving up two earned runs for a 54.00 ERA in postseason play. On 
May 31, 1969, Sparma lost a no-hitter against the Seattle Pilots when Don 
Mincher doubled with one out in the ninth inning.[4] During the 1969 season, 
Sparma roomed with Freehan, as Freehan kept a diary that was published 
in 1970. In the book, Freehan wrote that Sparma and Smith were usually 
not even on speaking terms as Sparma remained in Smith's doghouse. Freehan 
also wrote memorably of Sparma's talent for ESP: "My roomie's got an ESP 
thing. Every now and then, he'll wake up on a morning he's supposed to 
pitch and say, 'I've got a good feeling. I know we're going to win.' Joe 
doesn't get this feeling too often, but every time he does -- every single 
time -- we win." (Freehan, "Behind the Mask," p. 104) Sparma had that "good 
feeling" on June 13, 1969, before he shut out the Royals, 6-0. On another 
occasion, Sparma told teammate Dick McAuliffe of a premonition: "Mac, I 
know you're going to have a good day today. Something just tells me you're 
going to go three for five." McAuliffe went 3-for-4 in his first 4 at-bats 
and struck out in his 5th at bat. When he came back to the dugout, McAuliffe 
blamed Sparma for jinxing him on the 5th at bat. In his book, Freehan wrote 
that McAuliffe was "actually angry" at Sparma. "He could've at least thanked 
Joe for the three hits." (Freehan, "Behind the Mask," p. 106) Toward the 
end of the 1969 season, Sparma got into a fight in the bullpen with Fred 
Lasher. On December 3, 1969, Sparma was traded to the Montreal Expos. Sparma 
pitched only 27 innings for the Expos in 1970, compiling a record of 0-4. 
Sparma pitched his last major league game on May 12, 1970. In 183 career 
games, he had a 52-52 record with a 3.94 ERA. Sparma died in Columbus, 
Ohio at age 44 in 1986, after suffering a heart attack and undergoing heart
