The St. John's Red Storm is the nickname used for the 16 varsity athletic 
programs of St. John's University, in the U.S. state of New York. St. John's 
16 NCAA Division I teams compete in the Big East Conference, with the exception 
of the fencing team, which compete in the ECAC. On December 15, 2012, St. 
John's and the other six Catholic, non-FBS schools (the so-called "Catholic 
7") announced that they were departing the former Big East for a new conference.[3] 
The "Catholic 7", after purchasing the "Big East" name from the FBS schools 
and adding Butler, Creighton, and Xavier, will operate as a new Big East 
Conference beginning in July 2013.[4][5] The athletic program fields sixteen 
intercollegiate teams: basketball, soccer, baseball, lacrosse, tennis, 
golf, and fencing for men and basketball, soccer, softball, volleyball, 
tennis, track and field, cross country, golf, and fencing for women. In 
2002, the university eliminated five men's athletic teams and one women's 
team in order to comply with Title IX rules prohibiting activities that 
receive federal assistance from discriminating on the basis of gender.[6] 
Prior to the 1994–1995 school year, the university's nickname was the St. 
John's Redmen, which referenced the red uniforms worn by its teams in competition. 
The name was interpreted as a Native American reference in the 1960s, and 
the university did have a mascot (adorned in Native American dress), which 
eventually led to the team's name change to the Red Storm. The change happened 
at a time when there was mounting pressure on colleges and universities 
to adopt names more sensitive to Native American culture.[7][8] The Redmen 
name still remains popular among fans, however, as does "Johnnies". On 
September 18, 2009 the new mascot, which was voted on by students, was 
revealed; Johnny Thunderbird. St. John's is the 7th most winningest program 
in college basketball history (1686 wins),[9] St. John's boasts the 7th-most 
NCAA tournament appearances (27), two Wooden Award winners as national 
player of the year, 11 consensus All-Americans, 6 members of the College 
Basketball Hall of Fame, and has sent 59 players to the NBA. However, St. 
John's currently holds the NCAA Division I record for most NCAA Men's Division 
I Basketball Championship appearances without a championship.[citation

World's Most Famous Arena", while their early non-conference games are 
held at Carnesecca Arena on the St. John's campus in Queens.[9] St. John's 
University holds the second best winning percentage for a New York City 
school in the NCAA basketball tournament (second to City College of New 
York - which won the 1950 NCAA Div 1 Championship[10]) St. John's has the 
most NIT appearances with 27, the most championship wins with 6, although 
they were stripped of one due to an NCAA infraction.[11] The 1910–11 St. 
John's team finished the season with a 14–0 record[12] and was retroactively 
named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta 
Power Poll.[13][14] In 2008, St. John's celebrated its 100th year of college 
basketball. On February 21, 2011 the men's basketball team was voted into 
the top 25 in the AP and ESPN Coaches poll. This was the first time the 
team had been ranked since the end of the season in 2000. On September 
19, 2011, three recruits from St. John' s 2011 class were ruled ineligible 
for the fall semester. The players will attempt to regain their eligibility 
in the spring.[15] The women's basketball team is coached by Joe Tartamella, 
who became the head coach in 2012. St. John’s won the 1996 NCAA Men's Division 
I Soccer Championship, made four appearances in the NCAA College Cup (1996, 
2001, 2003 and 2008) and reached sixteen NCAA post-season tournaments, 
including fifteen straight from 1992 to 2006. The Red Storm also reached 
ten consecutive NCAA Tournament Rounds of sixteen from 1996 to 2005. Under 
Coach Masur, the Red Storm have also won seven Big East Tournament titles, 
six regular season crowns and has qualified for eighteen consecutive Big 
East tournaments. Their home games are hosted at Belson Stadium, a state 
of the art 2,168 seat stadium on the university campus, which sells out 
often.[9] In 2006, the men's soccer team became the first American soccer 
team to be invited to play in Vietnam. The team played against several 
Vietnam Football Federation squads as well as participating in community 
service.[16] The St. John's baseball team, currently coached by Ed Blankmeyer, 
has been to the College World Series six times, recorded 34 NCAA appearances, 
8 Big East Championships and have sent 70 players on to professional baseball 
careers. The team plays at the 3,500-seat Jack Kaiser Stadium, dedicated 
in 2007 to the Hall of Fame Coach and former St. John's Athletic Director. 
The stadium is one of the largest college baseball stadiums in the northeast, 
and is a featured venue on the EA Sports MVP NCAA Baseball video game.[citation 
needed] The stadium was conceived out of a deal between the university 
and the Giuliani administration. The administration wanted to find a location 
for a single-A team that would be affiliated with the New York Mets. Expressing 
concern about quality of life issues and the spending of public money for 
a private religious institution, surrounding neighborhood civic groups 
and local politicians protested the plan. In order to placate their concerns, 
however, the Mets offered to open it up to the communities for local high 
school games and youth programs.[17] This stadium was built despite large 
protests by community residents as well as State Senator Frank Padavan[17] 
(while also using city financing)[18] The Red Storm played the first ever 
game at the Mets' new ballpark, Citi Field on March 29, 2009. Big East

also attained national prominence including Olympians Keeth Smart and Ivan 
Lee. In 2001, St. John's won the NCAA Fencing Championship. The team has 
ranked in the top five each of the last 10 years, and finished 2nd in the 
NCAA during 1995, 2000, 2002, 2007 and 2010 seasons. In addition to team

team in 2002. St. John’s has won 2 NCAA team national championships.[19] 
In spring 2009, St. John's allowed its students to vote on what the new 
official Red Storm mascot would be. At a soccer game in fall 2009, members 
of the Athletics Department announced that a Thunderbird had received the 
majority of votes and would become the new mascot. After a vote, the new 
mascot was named Johnny Thunderbird. He can be seen at many of the school's
