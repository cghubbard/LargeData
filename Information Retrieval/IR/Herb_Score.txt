Herbert Jude Score (June 7, 1933 – November 11, 2008) was an American Major 
League Baseball (MLB) pitcher and announcer. He pitched for the Cleveland 
Indians and Chicago White Sox from 1955 through 1962. He was television 
and radio broadcaster for the Cleveland Indians from 1964–1997. Score was 
inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame in 2006. Herb Score was 
born in Rosedale New York in 1933. At 3, he was run over by a truck and 
later had rheumatic fever. As a teenager, he starting playing basketball 
and baseball at Holy Name of Mary School until he moved with his family 
to Lake Worth, Florida. In 1952, he threw six no-hitters for the Lake Worth 
Community High School baseball team, when the school won its only state 
baseball championship.[1] On June 7, 1952, his 19th birthday, he signed 
a baseball contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was sent to Indianapolis 
of the American Association where he made 10 pitching starts. In 1953, 
he moved to Cleveland's Class A affiliate, Reading (Pennsylvania) of the 
Eastern League. There he met and became lifetime friends with future outfielder 
Rocky Colavito from the Bronx, New York. For the 1954 season, both were 
promoted to Triple-A Indianapolis. Score was named The Sporting News Minor 
League Player of the Year and began to be referred to as "left-handed Bob 
Feller".[2] In 1955, Score came up to the Major Leagues (with Colavito) 
as a rookie with the Cleveland Indians at the age of 21. He quickly became 
one of the top power pitchers in the American League, no small feat on 
a team that still included Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and other top pitchers, 
going 16–10 with a 2.85 Earned run average (ERA) in his first year.[3] 
He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine on May 30, 1955.[2] 
Score struck out 245 batters in 1955, a Major League rookie record that 
stood until 1984, when it was topped by Dwight Gooden (Score, Gooden, Grover 
Cleveland Alexander, Don Sutton, Gary Nolan, Kerry Wood, Mark Langston, 
and Hideo Nomo were the only eight rookie pitchers to top 200 strikeouts 
in the 20th century). It was the first time in MLB history a regular starting 
pitcher averaged over one strikeout per inning.[4] In 1956, Score improved 
on his rookie campaign, going 20–9 with a 2.53 ERA and 263 strikeouts, 
while reducing the number of walks from 154 to 129, and allowed only 5.85 
hits/9 innings,[3] which would stand as a franchise record until it was 
broken by Luis Tiant's 5.30 in 1968. On May 7, 1957, during the first inning 
of a night game against the New York Yankees at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, 
Score threw a low fastball to Gil McDougald with Jim Hegan catching. McDougald 
lined the pitch to the mound and struck Score in the face, breaking Score's 
facial bones and injuring his eye. The ball caromed to third baseman Al 
Smith, who threw McDougald out before rushing to the pitching mound to 
Score's aid. McDougald, seeing Score hit by the baseball and then lying 
down and injured, also ran immediately to the pitching mound, instead of 
first base, to help Score. McDougald reportedly vowed to retire if Score 
permanently lost his sight in one eye as a result of the accident. Score 
eventually recovered his 20/20 vision, though he missed the rest of the 
season. He returned early in the 1958 season.[2] Though many believe Score 
feared being hit by another batted ball, and thus changed his pitching 
motion, Score himself rejected that theory. Score would tell Cleveland 
sportswriter Terry Pluto (for The Curse of Rocky Colavito) that, in 1958, 
after pitching and winning a few games and feeling better than he'd felt 
in a long time, he tore a tendon in his arm while pitching on a damp night 
against the Washington Senators and sat out the rest of the season. In 
1959, he'd shifted his pitching motion in a bid to avoid another, similar 
injury. "The reason my motion changed", Score told Pluto, "was because 
I hurt my elbow, and I overcompensated for it and ended up with some bad 
habits." As a result of the changes Score made in his pitching delivery, 
his velocity dropped and he incurred further injuries. Score pitched the 
full 1959 season, going 9–11 with a 4.71 ERA and 147 strikeouts.[3] In 
the book The Greatest Team Of All Time (Bob Adams, Inc, publisher. 1994), 
Mickey Mantle picked Herb Score as the toughest American League left-handed 
pitcher he faced (before the injury). Yogi Berra picked Herb for his "Greatest 
Team Of All Time". Score was traded to the Chicago White Sox on April 18, 
1960[5] and pitched parts of the following three seasons before retiring. 
He finished with a major league career record of 55–46, 3.36 ERA, and 837 
strikeouts over eight seasons in 858 1⁄3 innings pitched.[3] Score retired 
from playing baseball in 1962. Beginning in 1964, he was employed as a 
television and radio play-by-play announcer with the Cleveland Indians 
for the next 34 years, first on television from 1964–1967, and then on 
radio from 1968–1997, the longest career for an Indians play-by-play announcer. 
Score was revered by the Indians fans for his announcing style, including 
a low voice and a low-key style, as well as a habit of occasionally mispronouncing 
the names of players on opposing teams. Score's final Major League Baseball 
game as an announcer was Game 7 of the 1997 World Series.[6] On October 
8, 1998, while driving to Florida after being inducted into the Broadcasters 
Hall of Fame the night before, Score was severely injured in a traffic 
accident.[7] Score pulled into the path of a westbound tractor-trailer 
truck near New Philadelphia, Ohio, and his car was struck in the passenger 
side.[8] He suffered trauma to his brain, chest and lungs. The orbital 
bone around one of his eyes was fractured, as were three ribs and his sternum. 
He spent over a month in the intensive care unit, and was released from 
MetroHealth Hospital in mid-December.[9][10] He was cited for failure to 
stop at a stop sign.[11][12] He went through a difficult recovery, but 
managed to throw out the first pitch at the Indians' Opening Day on April 
12, 1999.[13] He suffered a stroke in 2002, and died on November 11, 2008 
at his home in Rocky River, Ohio, after a lengthy illness.[14][15] He is 
interred at Lakewood Park Cemetery in Rocky River. The Indians wore a patch
