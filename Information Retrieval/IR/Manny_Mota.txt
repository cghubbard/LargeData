As player As coach Manuel Rafael Mota Geronimo, more commonly known as 
Manny Mota (born February 18, 1938), is a Dominican former Major League 
Baseball outfielder who played for the San Francisco Giants, Pittsburgh 
Pirates and Montreal Expos, as well as being a pinch hitting specialist 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was a coach for the Dodgers from 1980 
through 2013. His 34 consecutive seasons as a Dodgers coach was the longest 
in team history and the second-longest such streak in MLB history behind 
Nick Altrock, who spent 42 straight seasons listed as a coach for the old 
Washington Senators. Mota is currently a minor league hitting instructor 
and Spanish language television broadcaster for the Dodgers. At the age 
of 19, Mota signed as an amateur free agent with the New York Giants on 
February 21, 1957. He began his minor league career that season with the 
Class-D Michigan City White Caps of the Midwest League, where he hit .314 
in 126 games. In 1958, he was promoted to the Class-B Danville Leafs of 
the Carolina League, where he hit .301 in 103 games. Mota began 1959 with 
the Class A Springfield Giants of the Eastern League and was later promoted 
to the AAA Phoenix Giants of the Pacific Coast League. In 86 games combined, 
he hit .304. In 1960, he played in 141 games for the AA Rio Grande Valley 
Giants of the Texas League, hitting .307. In 1961, with the AAA Tacoma 
Giants, he hit .289 in 142 games. After beginning 1962 with the El Paso 
Sun Kings, Mota made his Major League debut on April 16, 1962 for the now 
San Francisco Giants against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and he hit a flyball 
to centerfield in his first at-bat. His first hit was an RBI single off 
Jim Brosnan of the Cincinnati Reds on April 21, 1962. He had 13 hits in 
74 at-bats for a .176 batting average in 47 games for the Giants. On November 
30, 1962, the Giants traded him to the Houston Colt .45's (with Dick LeMay) 
for infielder Joey Amalfitano. Before he ever appeared in an official game 
with Houston, he was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates for outfielder Howie 
Goss and cash on April 4, 1963, and he quickly established himself as one 
of the league's premiere hitters. In six years with the Pirates, Mota appeared 
in 642 games and hit .297. His first career home run was hit off Chris 
Short of the Philadelphia Phillies on May 26, 1964. On October 14, 1968, 
Mota was the second player selected in the expansion draft by the Montreal 
Expos. In 31 games, he hit .315. On June 11, 1969 Mota was traded to the 
Los Angeles Dodgers (along with Maury Wills) for Ron Fairly and Paul Popovich.[1] 
Once in L.A., Mota became the number one pinch hitter there and hit over 
.300 during the next five seasons. On May 16, 1970, Mota hit the only batted 
ball in major league history to cause a fatality.[2] In the bottom of the 
third against the Giants at Dodger Stadium, Mota fouled one off of Gaylord 
Perry along the first base line. The ball struck 14-year-old Alan Fish 
in the left temple. Four days later, Fish died of an inoperable head injury.[3] 
In 1973, Mota was selected to the National League All-Star team after leading 
the league in batting average. From 1974 through 1979, Mota was continuously 
called upon for late inning heroics, where he averaged 10 pinch hits for 
6 straight seasons. The Dodgers appeared in the 1974, 1977, and 1978 World 
Series. In 1979, he established his place in the record books by becoming 
the all-time leader in Pinch Hits. He had a compact swing and often half-swung 
just to push the ball beyond the reach of the first baseman for a hit. 
In 1981, Manny appeared in his fourth World Series, this time mostly as 
a coach but only to be activated later in the year for the stretch drive. 
Mota retired as a player from the Dodgers the following year. He left a 
career holding the all-time major league record for career pinch-hits (150), 
which has since been broken by Mark Sweeney and Lenny Harris, and an overall 
lifetime batting average of .304 and a .297 pinch-hitting average. His 
.315 batting average is second best (1,800 or more at bats) in Los Angeles 
Dodgers history, trailing only Mike Piazza. Mota served as a player-coach 
for the Dodgers during his final seasons as a player, and remained as a 
coach after retiring as a player. Mota again participated in a World Series 
as a coach for the Dodgers in 1988, making this a total of five World Series 
appearances. Mota remained a Dodger coach until he hung up his uniform 
in 2013, though he remained part of the Dodgers organization. In the off-season, 
Mota and his wife Margarita reside in the Dominican Republic, where they 
run the Manny Mota International Foundation. Established over 30 years 
ago, this humanitarian organization provides needed resources and other 
assistance to disadvantaged youth and their families in both the Dominican 
Republic and the United States. Mota was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage 
Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on August 23, 2003, in pregame on field ceremony 
at Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles. Mota worked as a color commentator on the 
Fox Sports en Espanol television broadcast of the 2007 World Series and 
worked as a Spanish language broadcaster for the Dodgers on select PrimeTicket 
broadcasts. He retired as a full-time coach after the 2013 season and became 
a full-time broadcaster on the Spanish-language feeds of SportsNet LA. 
As one of the all-time great pinch hitters and a Los Angeles staple in 
the 1970s, Mota was referenced in a joke in the movie Airplane! As we hear 
Ted Striker's inner-dialogue echo in his mind, it resembles a stadium public 
address and we hear him think "Pinch hitting for Pedro Borbón... Manny 
Mota... Mota... Mota..." Mota and Borbon never actually played on the same 
team. Two of Mota's sons, Andy and José, also played in the Major Leagues. 
Manny's youngest son, Tony, played extensively through the Minor Leagues 
and has also coached for the Dodgers organization. Manny, and his wife, 
Margarita, recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Mota's nephew, 
Santiago Taveras, is an educator and former deputy chancellor in New York 
City, and is the current principal of DeWitt Clinton High School in the
