NPB Karl Derrick "Tuffy" Rhodes (born August 21, 1968) is a retired American 
professional baseball player. He played six years in Major League Baseball 
in the US, and thirteen years in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in 
Japan. Rhodes is the all-time NPB home run leader among foreign-born players, 
and he is tied for 11th overall with 464 home runs in Japan. He held Japan's 
single-season home run record from 2001 to 2013. Rhodes was born in Cincinnati, 
Ohio. He acquired the nickname "Tuffy" as a child because of his serious 
approach to baseball. Rhodes attended Western Hills High School in Cincinnati.[1] 
Prior to Japan, he was a center fielder playing for the Houston Astros, 
Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox from 1990-1995. In his major league career, 
Rhodes batted .224, with 13 home runs and 44 runs batted in, 74 runs scored 
and 14 stolen bases in 225 games played. In 1993, he hit an extra-inning 
home run to win the American Association championship for the Iowa Cubs. 
His only season of more than 250 at bats came with the 1994 Cubs. In that 
season, Rhodes became the first National League player to hit three home 
runs on opening day when he connected off Dwight Gooden at Wrigley Field. 
Granted free agency after the 1995 season, Rhodes signed with the Kintetsu 
Buffaloes in the Pacific League of NPB. In the 2001 season, he hit his 
55th homer to tie Sadaharu Oh's Japanese League single season home run 
record, set in 1964. For the rest of the season, opposing pitchers intentionally 
walked Rhodes to prevent him from breaking Oh's record. (The current record 
is 60, set by Wladimir Balentien in 2013.) The following year, Alex Cabrera 
tied the record. Over 8 seasons with the Buffaloes, Rhodes hit 288 home 
runs for the team. After Kintetsu refused to sign him to a multi-year contract, 
Rhodes signed a two-year deal with the Yomiuri Giants of the Japanese Central 
League in 2004. A successful first year was followed by a difficult second 
year. He left the team halfway through the 2005 season due to injury, and 
was released in the off-season. In 2006, he tried to return to the major 
leagues with the Cincinnati Reds but was released by the team in spring 
training. He shortly thereafter retired from baseball. After spending the 
rest of 2006 with his family, however, he returned to Japan in 2007, signing 
a one-year contract with the Orix Buffaloes. Although Rhodes is not Japanese, 
his long career in NPB earned him free agency, in which he was treated 
as a "Japanese Player" and was not bound to the restrictions of foreign 
players. Only three other non-Japanese players (Tai-Yuan Kuo, Alex Ram√≠rez, 
and Alex Cabrera) have achieved such a classification in NPB history. Rhodes 
began the 2007 season with a bang by hitting a home run in his first game, 
and connecting for two more in the next game on two consecutive at bats. 
According to manager Terry Collins, Rhodes still had an 'explosive' bat.[2] 
While the Buffaloes struggled to a last-place finish in 2007, and also 
not having any protection to speak of in the lineup, Rhodes' comeback was 
a spectacular one, batting .291 and hitting 42 home runs to go with 96 
runs batted in. The next season, teamed with fellow gaijin slugger Alex 
Cabrera, Rhodes hit 40 home runs and drove in 118 runs despite his average 
dropping to .277. Combined, Cabrera and Rhodes, who earned the nickname 
"Caburo" late in the season, slammed 76 home runs and drove in 222 runs. 
Rhodes' 118 RBI also led the league as the Buffaloes made an improbable 
run to the playoffs, finishing second in the Pacific League and making 
their first playoff appearance since their 1996 Japan Series victory. However, 
the success did not last as the Buffaloes were swept in the short first-round 
of the Pacific League Climax Series by Yu Darvish and the more experienced 
Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. Rhodes played for one more season with Orix
