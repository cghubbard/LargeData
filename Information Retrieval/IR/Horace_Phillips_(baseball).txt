Horace B. Phillips (May 14, 1853 â€“ February 26, 1896) was an American manager 
in Major League Baseball for eight seasons, from 1879 to 1889. He managed 
one season for the Troy Trojans, one season for the Columbus Buckeyes and 
six seasons for the Pittsburg Alleghenys. He was born in Salem, Ohio.[1] 
On June 6, 1882, Phillips was arrested in Philadelphia for not paying a 
hotel bill from 1882. He claimed that A. J. Reach was put in charge of 
paying it, but he eventually paid the bill himself and was released.[2] 
Shortly after his time in Pittsburgh, Phillips was institutionalized for 
mental illness in the Kirkbride's Asylum in Philadelphia, then later in 
a private hospital in Merchantville, New Jersey. His wife divorced him
