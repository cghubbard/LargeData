Taylor Heath Jungmann (born December 18, 1989) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Prior to playing professionally, he played college baseball for the Texas 
Longhorns, where he was a consensus All-American and won the Dick Howser 
Trophy. Jungmann attended Rogers High School in Rogers, Texas. Rogers' 
baseball team won the Texas 2A State Championship in 2007. He transferred 
to Georgetown High School in Georgetown, Texas, where he played his senior 
year in 2008.[1] After graduating from high school, Jungmann enrolled at 
the University of Texas at Austin, where he participated in college baseball 
for the Texas Longhorns. In 2009, Jungmann pitched a complete game against 
the Louisiana State Tigers in the best-of-three final round of the 2009 
College World Series.[2] In 2011, he won the Dick Howser Trophy as the 
best collegiate baseball player.[3][4] He finished his career with the 
Longhorns with a 32–9 win–loss record, a 1.85 earned run average (ERA), 
and 356 strikeouts in 45 games started.[1] The Milwaukee Brewers selected 
Jungmann in the first round, with the 12th overall selection, of the 2011 
Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft.[5][6] He signed with the Brewers, receiving 
a $2.525 million signing bonus.[7] Jungmann pitched for the Brevard County 
Manatees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2012, where he 
had a 3.53 ERA, and for the Huntsville Stars of the Class AA Southern League 
in 2013, where he pitched to a 4.33 ERA.[1] In 2014, Jungmann began the 
season with Huntsville,[8] and was named a Southern League All-Star.[9] 
He also played for the Nashville Sounds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast 
League (PCL).[10] He finished the season with a 12–10 win–loss record, 
a 3.57 ERA, and 147 strikeouts in 153 2⁄3 innings. The Brewers added him 
to their 40-man roster to protect him from being chosen in the Rule 5 draft 
on November 20, 2014.[11] Jungmann began the 2015 season with the Colorado 
Springs Sky Sox of the PCL. The Brewers promoted Jungmann to the major 
leagues to make his MLB debut on June 9.[12] On July 11, 2015, Jungmann 
became the first Brewers pitcher in franchise history to throw a complete 
game at Dodger Stadium. Jungmann brandishes a four pitch repertoire. At 
6-foot-6, his four-seam fastball is thrown around 92-94 MPH and on a downward 
plane, inducing many ground balls. He also features a sinker in the upper-80s, 
also to induce ground balls, as well as to mask the velocity of his four-seamer. 
His curveball is likely his best pitch, frequently causing many swings-and-misses. 
Sitting in the upper-70s, the curveball has a hard, late break as it reaches 
the batter, and his mechanics are consistent across all of his pitches, 
making any off-speed offerings more deceptive. His curveball has been referred 
to by some as a slurve, due to its late break and decent velocity. He also 
features a changeup in the lower-80s with good sinking movement, though 
he doesn't throw it very often. Despite relying heavily on inducing ground 
balls, his pitches have enough velocity, movement, and deceptiveness to
