Ernest Gilbert Broglio (/ˈbroʊlioʊ/; born August 27, 1935) is a former 
right-handed pitcher in American Major League Baseball from 1959 to 1966. 
Broglio signed with the independent Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League 
after he attended West Contra Costa Junior College. He was acquired by 
the New York Giants in 1956. After two seasons in the Giants’ minor league 
system—when he won 17 games each year—Broglio was traded to the St. Louis 
Cardinals in October 1958. Although he led the National League in wins 
with 21 for the 1960 Cardinals and won 18 for the 1963 Redbirds, Broglio 
is best remembered as the "other player" in the ultimately lopsided trade 
that sent future Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Lou Brock from the Chicago 
Cubs to the Cardinals on June 15, 1964. His career in the majors came to 
an end two years later in the 1966 season. Ernie Broglio was the second 
child born in Berkeley, California to his parents Anna and Joseph Broglio. 
After ten years, in 1945, his family moved to El Cerito. With his dad working 
seven days a week, carrying out two jobs, Ernie was self-motivated to play 
baseball and played on the varsity high school teams for baseball and basketball 
as an eighth grader.[1] At the age of 17, Ernie graduated from El Cerrito 
High School and was drafted by the Oakland Oaks.[2] In 1953, at the age 
of 17, Broglio held an ERA of 6.89 in 11 games with 2 wins and 4 loses 
in his first year on the Oakland Oaks roster, but improved throughout his 
years in the minor leagues to have a 2.51 ERA in 1957 with the Dallas Eagles.[2] 
In his minor league career, Ernie was part of many trades between organizations, 
playing for the Oakland Oaks, Modesto Reds, Stockton Ports, Dallas Eagles, 
and Phoenix Giants.[2] On October 8, 1958, he was involved in a transaction 
involving five players from the Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals. In 
the Cardinal organization, Broglio went on an exhibition tour that led 
to his promotion into the major leagues.[1] On April 11, 1959, Broglio 
made his major league debut for the St. Louis Cardinals, at the age of 
23. After four appearances, he had a 9.00 ERA with an 0–2 record, and did 
not get his first win until his match-up against Philadelphia on June 16 
which brought his record to 1–5.[1] Broglio ended his first season with 
a record of 7–12 with an ERA of 4.72 over 181.1 innings pitched and 35 
appearances.[3] Not projected to be a part of the Cardinals' starting rotation 
in the 1961 season, Broglio made his first appearance in relief on the 
second game of the season pitching six innings against the Giants. After 
this performance, he alternated between relief innings and starts that 
brought him to a 9–4 record with a 2.86 ERA, and got him into the starting 
rotation for the next eighteen appearances.[1] The final half of the season 
resulted in a 2.74 ERA and a 21–9 record.[3] Broglio led the league along 
with Warren Spahn in wins and win percentage, with both players having 
a winning percentage of (.700) and 21 wins. He also had the second best 
ERA in the league, and was ranked third in the Cy Young Award voting for 
the season.[3] In addition, Broglio received The National League Sophomore 
of the Year Award that season. This award is not well known due to Major 
League Baseball discontinuing the award in 1962 due to the lack of interest. 
The award was given to the player who performed the best during their second 
full season, avoiding what some baseball fans would call the sophomore 
"jinx" or sophomore slump for hitters.[4] Broglio had arm problems over 
the remaining years of his career with the Cardinals which contributed 
to the general management's decision to involve Broglio in a five-player 
trade with the Chicago Cubs that resulted in the Cardinals obtaining Lou 
Brock.[5] When Ernie Broglio was traded to the Cubs for Lou Brock, it was 
seen as a heist for the Cubs.[6] Broglio had won 18 games the year before 
and was considered a top-flight starting pitcher.[3] Brock—one of the fastest 
men in the game with surprising power as a hitter—had been a disappointment 
in Chicago. But Brock would bat .348 for the rest of the ’64 season, leading 
the Cardinals to a world championship.[6] He then would play another 15 
years, appear in two more World Series (1967–68), and set the career stolen 
base record (938, since broken by Rickey Henderson).[7] The Cardinals organization 
knew that Broglio's arm would not last much longer, having had twenty cortisone 
shots in his shoulder in the 1961 season.[5] Broglio's performance with 
the Cubs was what led a majority of baseball fans to view the transaction 
between the Cardinals and Cubs to be a lopsided trade. He had a record 
of 1–6 his first year with the Cubs in 1965 and a 2–6 record in 1966 which 
made the organization send him down to the minor leagues.[3] ESPN ranked 
this to be the number one, worst mid season trade in baseball history.[6] 
In an eight-year career, Broglio made 259 appearances, accumulating 849 
strikeouts in 1337.1 innings pitched, and he ended his career with a 3.74 
earned run average. Broglio's final record in the major leagues accounted
