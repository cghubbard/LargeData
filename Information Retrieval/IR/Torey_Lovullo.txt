As player As coach As manager Salvatore Anthony "Torey" Lovullo (born July 
25, 1965) is an American professional baseball infielder who is currently 
the manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
In his playing days he was listed at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and 185 
pounds (84 kg) and was a switch hitter who threw right-handed. Lovullo 
served as the first base coach for the Toronto Blue Jays from 2011 to 2012, 
as well as the bench coach for the Boston Red Sox from 2013 until 2016. 
He also served as Boston's interim manager for the final seven weeks of 
the 2015 season when his boss, John Farrell, stepped aside for successful 
treatment for lymphoma. Lovullo compiled a win-loss record of 28–20 (.583) 
from August 14, 2015, through the final day of the season, October 4.[1] 
A native of Santa Monica, California, he is an alumnus of the University 
of California, Los Angeles; his father, Sam, was a producer on the television 
show Hee Haw. Lovullo was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the fifth round 
of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft and made his Major League debut 
with the Tigers on September 10, 1988. He also played in the Majors for 
the New York Yankees, California Angels, Seattle Mariners, Oakland Athletics 
and Cleveland Indians, and appeared in his final big-league game on October 
3, 1999, for the Philadelphia Phillies. After his MLB career ended, Lovullo 
spent one season in Japan as a member of the Yakult Swallows in 2000. His 
managing career included service in the Indians' and Red Sox' organizations. 
Lovullo first reached the Major Leagues for a brief trial in September 
1988, his second professional season. Replacing Tom Brookens at third base 
in the late innings of a 9–4 Tiger loss to the Yankees at Yankee Stadium 
on September 10, he handled no chances in the field, but singled off Rick 
Rhoden in his first big-league at bat. Lovullo would play one full season 
and parts of seven others in the Majors. In his only full campaign, 1993 
with the Angels, he appeared in 116 games played, and collected 92 hits, 
batting a career-high .251. He was the Angels' most-used second baseman, 
starting in 79 of the team's 162 games. He was a teammate that season of 
pitcher John Farrell, and formed an association that would influence Lovullo's 
managerial and coaching career. Altogether, Lovullo appeared in 303 MLB 
games, including 133 at second base, and 67 each at first base and third 
base. He batted .224 in 737 at bats, collecting 165 total hits, including 
15 home runs, 60 runs batted in, 35 doubles and one triple. In Japan in 
1999 he played in only 29 games and batted .197 with one home run and two 
runs batted in. Lovullo's long minor playing career —1,433 games with 1,193 
hits, and a batting average of .267[2] — included extended stays with the 
Toledo Mud Hens, Columbus Clippers and Buffalo Bisons; he would later return 
to manage in both Buffalo and Columbus. Lovullo's off-field career began 
in the Cleveland organization in 2001 as a minor league infield coach.[3] 
After Farrell joined the Indians' front office as director of player development 
that November, Lovullo became the manager of the 2002 Columbus (Georgia) 
RedStixx of the Class A South Atlantic League, and guided them to the finals 
of the SAL playoffs. He then moved up to the High Class A Kinston Indians 
(2003–04) and the Double-A Akron Aeros (2005), which he piloted to an 84–58 
win-loss record and the Eastern League championship. His 2005 success led 
to his first MLB managerial audition, when he was invited to interview 
for the vacant managerial job for the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to the 
2006 season. When the Dodgers settled on Grady Little for their manager 
position, Lovullo resumed managing in the Indians' organization as skipper 
of the Buffalo Bisons, the Tribe's Triple-A affiliate. During Lovullo's 
playing career, he had spent all or parts of three seasons (1995; 1997–98) 
as a player for the Bisons and won two championships: one in the American 
Association and one in the International League. In 2003, he also had received 
the highest honor awarded to an alumnus of Buffalo baseball, as he was 
inducted into the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame, alongside his teammate 
from the 1997 and 1998 championship squads, Jeff Manto. In three campaigns 
(2006–08) as the Bisons' manager, he led the club to two winning records, 
and compiled a mark of 214–212. He also interviewed for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates' managerial vacancy after the 2007 season. In 2009, the Indians 
changed their Triple-A affiliation from Buffalo to the Columbus (Ohio) 
Clippers of the International League. Lovullo had played for the Clippers 
in 1991–92 when the team was the Yankees' top farm club. The Clippers were 
the International League champions in both seasons Lovullo played in Columbus, 
winning back-to-back Governors' Cup trophies. In 2009, his only season 
as the Clippers' manager, the team compiled a 57–85 (.401) record, but 
Lovullo was recruited by the Boston Red Sox to take over their Triple-A 
team, the Pawtucket Red Sox, for 2010.[4] It was his first season in the 
Boston organization, although both Farrell (as pitching coach) and another 
former Cleveland farm system official, Mike Hazen (as director of player 
development), were playing key roles with the Red Sox. Lovullo's 2010 PawSox 
finished 66–78 (.458) and out of the playoffs, fourth in the Northern Division 
of the International League. During his minor league managing career, Lovullo 
was named "Manager of the Year" in both the Carolina League (2004) and 
the Eastern League (2005). For the latter season, he also was named Double-A 
Manager of the Year by Baseball America.[3] His nine-year (2002–10) win-loss 
record as a manager is 661–609 (.520). At the close of the 2010 season, 
Farrell, then considered a top Major League managerial candidate, was hired 
as the pilot of the Toronto Blue Jays for 2011. He named Lovullo to his 
Toronto coaching staff on November 8, 2010, to replace Omar Malavé as the 
club's first-base coach,[5] and he served two seasons in that capacity. 
After the 2012 season, the Red Sox began negotiations with the Blue Jays 
to release Farrell from his contract so that he could return to Boston 
as manager for 2013. Ultimately, the Red Sox acquired the rights to Farrell 
in an October 21 trade for infielder Mike Avilés. Upon being named the 
Red Sox' manager, Farrell hired Lovullo on October 26, 2012, as his bench 
coach.[6] After the Red Sox won the 2013 World Series, Lovullo was mentioned 
as a potential candidate to succeed Dale Sveum as manager of the Chicago 
Cubs for 2014,[7] but he returned as Boston's bench coach.[8] Then, upon 
the close of the 2014 season, Lovullo interviewed for managerial openings 
with the Texas Rangers[9] and Minnesota Twins,[10] but was a runner-up 
in each case. The 2016 season was Lovullo's fourth consecutive season with 
the Red Sox, and his sixth straight overall as an aide to Farrell. On August 
11, 2015, Farrell underwent hernia surgery, leaving Lovullo in charge of 
the team. Three days later, Farrell announced that during the surgery, 
it was found that he had stage 1 lymphoma.[11] The Red Sox named Lovullo 
manager for the balance of the season while Farrell underwent chemotherapy.[12] 
The Red Sox showed a significant improvement in performance under Lovullo, 
scoring 37 runs in their first 2 games after he took over, and recording 
a .636 winning percentage through the end of September, compared with a 
.439 winning percentage on the season under Farrell.[13] A high point came 
near the end of the season when the Red Sox posted a six-game winning streak 
and moved up to third place in the AL East. However, the team lost their 
last four games and ultimately finished at the bottom of their division 
for the second year in a row. On October 1, 2015, it was reported that, 
if healthy, Farrell would return to his position as Red Sox manager at 
the beginning of the 2016 season,[14] leaving Lovullo's position with the 
organization uncertain after his performance as interim manager.[15] It 
was announced that Lovullo would resume his bench coach duties for the 
2016 season on October 4, 2015, with Farrell returning as manager. Lovullo 
was also given a two-year contract extension in exchange for forgoing his 
right to pursue managerial job offerings.[1] Mike Hazen, who had worked 
with Lovullo with both the Indians and Red Sox, was named the new general 
manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks on October 16, 2016. Almost three weeks 
later, on November 4, Hazen appointed Lovullo to replace Chip Hale as the 
Diamondbacks' manager for the 2017 season.[16] Hazen hired Lovullo over
