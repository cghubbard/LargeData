Santiago Casilla (born July 25, 1980[1]) is a Dominican professional baseball 
relief pitcher who is a free agent. He stands 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighs 
210 pounds (95 kg). He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the 
Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants. Casilla throws four pitches: 
a fastball, slider, curveball, and a changeup. He bats and throws right 
handed. Casilla was originally signed by the Oakland A's on January 31, 
2000, as an amateur free agent, and pitched from then through 2005 under 
the name of Jairo Garcia. During spring training in 2006 he revealed his 
real name to be Santiago Casilla, and that he had used false documents 
which listed him as three years younger than his actual age when he first 
signed in 2000.[2] Casilla pitched small parts of 2004, 2005, and 2006 
for the Athletics as a reliever. In 2007, Casilla was recalled by the Athletics 
from Triple-A after going 2–1 with a 4.13 ERA with 29 strikeouts in 24 
innings. He stepped into a bullpen that had Huston Street, Justin Duchscherer, 
and Kiko Calero on the disabled list. Casilla started off well, going 2–1 
with 2 saves and a 0.45 ERA in his first 16 games. But he wound up finishing 
the season with a 3–1 record and a 4.44 ERA in 46 games.[3] He pitched 
in the A's bullpen in the 2008 and 2009 seasons with mixed success. At 
the end of 2009, he was granted free agency by the A's and signed a minor 
league contract with the San Francisco Giants for 2010. He made his Giants 
debut on May 21, 2010 against his former team in Oakland and remained with 
the team for the remainder of the season until they won the World Series. 
He returned to the Giants for 2011 as a member of the bullpen and took 
over as its closer after Brian Wilson went on the disabled list in August.[4] 
Casilla picked up his first career base hit, a bases loaded, two out RBI 
ground ball single between Diamondbacks first baseman Paul Goldschmidt 
and Aaron Hill on September 14, 2012. Casilla was the winning pitcher in 
Game 4 of the 2012 World Series as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers. 
On December 17, 2012, Casilla re-signed with the Giants for 3 years at 
$15 million. On May 28, 2013, Casilla underwent knee surgery to remove 
a cyst and was placed on the 15-day DL. On May 17, 2015, in a 9-8 win over 
the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park, Casilla entered the bottom 
on the ninth inning and struck out three batters on nine pitches, thus 
recording an immaculate save. Casilla is the third San Francisco Giant 
in franchise history to pitch an immaculate inning, joining Trevor Wilson 
and Orel Hershiser. On April 25, 2016, Casilla successfully logged his 
100th save, closing 1 & 1/3 innings against the San Diego Padres.[5] As 
of September 17, 2016, he has a league-leading 9 blown saves in 2016. Casilla 
works with a prototypical power pitcher repertoire, chiefly throwing a 
low to mid-90s two-seam fastball and a hard-breaking slider. He also occasionally 
mixes in a curveball and changeup. However, at times, he struggles with
