Amherst College (i/ˈæmərst/[5] AM-ərst) is a private liberal arts college 
located in Amherst, Massachusetts, United States. Founded in 1821 as an 
attempt to relocate Williams College by its president, Zephaniah Swift 
Moore, Amherst is the third oldest institution of higher education in Massachusetts.[6] 
The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named 
after Lord Jeffery Amherst. Amherst was established as a men's college 
and became coeducational in 1975. Amherst is an exclusively undergraduate 
four-year institution and enrolled 1,795 students in the fall of 2015.[3][7] 
Students choose courses from 38 major programs in an open curriculum.[8] 
Students are not required to study a core curriculum or fulfill any distribution 
requirements and may even design their own unique interdisciplinary major.[9] 
Freshmen may take advanced courses, and seniors may take introductory ones. 
For the class of 2020, Amherst received 8,397 applications and accepted 
1,149 yielding a 13.7% acceptance rate.[10] Amherst was ranked as the second 
best liberal arts college in the country by U.S. News & World Report,[11] 
and 12th out of all U.S. colleges and universities by Forbes[12] in their 
2016 rankings. Amherst competes in the New England Small College Athletic 
Conference. Amherst has historically had close relationships and rivalries 
with Williams College and Wesleyan University which form the Little Three 
colleges. The college is a member of the Five College Consortium, which 
allows its students to attend classes at four other Pioneer Valley institutions. 
These include Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Hampshire College, 
and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Founded in 1821, Amherst College 
developed out of the secondary school Amherst Academy. The college was 
originally suggested as an alternative to Williams College, which was struggling 
to stay open. Although Williams remained open, Amherst was formed and diverged 
from its Williams roots into an individual institution.[13] In 1812, funds 
were raised in Amherst for a secondary school, Amherst Academy; it opened 
December 1814.[14] The academy incorporated in 1816.[15] The institution 
was named after the town, which in turn had been named after Jeffery, Lord 
Amherst, a veteran from the Seven Years' War and later commanding general 
of the British forces in North America. On November 18, 1817, a project 
was adopted at the Academy to raise funds for the free instruction of "indigent 
young men of promising talents and hopeful piety, who shall manifest a 
desire to obtain a liberal education with a sole view to the Christian 
ministry."[16] This required a substantial investment from benefactors.[13] 
During the fundraising for the project, it became clear that without larger 
designs, it would be impossible to raise sufficient funds. This led the 
committee overseeing the project to conclude that a new institution should 
be created. On August 18, 1818, the Amherst Academy board of trustees accepted 
this conclusion and began building a new college.[13] Moore, then President 
of Williams College, however, still believed that Williamstown was an unsuitable 
location for a college, and with the advent of Amherst College was elected 
its first president on May 8, 1821. At its opening, Amherst had forty-seven 
students. Fifteen of these had followed Moore from Williams College. Those 
fifteen represented about one-third of the whole number at Amherst, and 
about one-fifth of the whole number in the three classes to which they 
belonged in Williams College. President Moore died on June 29, 1823, and 
was replaced with a Williams College trustee, Heman Humphrey. Williams 
alumni are fond of an apocryphal story ascribing the removal of books from 
the Williams College library to Amherst College, but there is no contemporaneous 
evidence to verify the story. In 1995, Williams president Harry C. Payne 
declared the story false, but many still nurture the legend.[16] Amherst 
grew quickly, and for two years in the mid-1830s it was the second largest 
college in the United States, second only to Yale. In 1835, Amherst attempted 
to create a course of study parallel to the classical liberal arts education. 
This parallel course focused less on Greek and Latin, instead focusing 
on English, French, Spanish, chemistry, economics, etc. The parallel course 
did not take hold, however, until the next century.[16] Amherst was founded 
as a non-sectarian institution "for the classical education of indigent 
young men of piety and talents for the Christian ministry." (Tyler, A History 
of Amherst College) One of the hallmarks of the new college was its Charity 
Fund, an early form of financial aid that paid the tuition of poorer students.[17] 
Although officially non-denominational, the initial Amherst was widely 
seen as a religiously conservative institution with a strong connection 
to Calvinism, and as a result, there was considerable debate in the Massachusetts 
government over whether the new college should receive an official charter 
from the state, and a charter was not granted until February 21, 1825.[17] 
As a result of the official charter being granted four years after the 
official founding of the college, the Amherst seal lists a date of 1825. 
A tradition of religious conservatism persisted at Amherst until the mid-nineteenth 
century; students who consumed alcohol or played cards were subject to 
expulsion, and there were a number of religious revivals at Amherst where 
mobs of righteous students would herd less religious students into the 
chapel and berate them for lack of piety.[17] Towards the end of the nineteenth 
century, however, the college began a transition towards secularism, culminating 
in the demolishing of the college church in 1949.[18] Academic hoods in 
the United States are traditionally lined with the official colors of the 
school, in theory so watchers can tell where the hood wearer earned his 
or her degree. Amherst's hoods are purple (Williams' official color) with 
a white stripe or chevron, said to signify that Amherst was born of Williams. 
Amherst records one of the first uses of Latin honors of any American college, 
dating back to 1881.[19] The college was an all-male school until the late 
1960s, when a few female students from nearby schools in the Five-College 
Consortium attended on an experimental basis. In October 1974, the faculty 
voted in favor of coeducation and in November 1974 the board of trustees 
voted to admit female students starting in the 1975-1976 school year. In 
1975, nine women who were already attending classes as part of an inter-college 
exchange program were admitted as transfer students. In June 1976, they 
became the first female graduates of the college.[20] The college established 
the Black Studies Department in 1969. In 1973, it launched the nation's 
first undergraduate neuroscience program. In 1983, it established a Department 
of Asian Languages and Literatures, which was later to become the Department 
of Asian Languages and Civilizations.[21] In 1984, on-campus fraternities 
were abolished. The former fraternity buildings, which were owned by the 
college, were converted into residence halls.[21] The Department of Women's 
and Gender Studies, which later became the Department of Sexuality, Women's, 
and Gender Studies, was established in 1987 and the Department of Law, 
Jurisprudence, and Social Thought in 1993.[21] Since the inception of the 
U.S. News & World Report rankings, Amherst College has been ranked ten 
times as the first overall among 266 liberal arts colleges in the United 
States,[25] and in 2016 ranked second, behind Williams.[11] In 2016, Forbes 
ranked Amherst College as the 12th best college or university in the United 
States.[12] Kiplinger's Personal Finance places Amherst 11th in its 2016 
ranking of best value liberal arts colleges in the United States.[26] Amherst 
College ranked second overall in 2012, according to the National Collegiate 
Scouting Association's annual report, which ranks colleges based on student-athlete 
graduation rates, academic strength, and athletic prowess.[27] Amherst 
ranked as having the second-highest graduation rate of any institution 
in the United States, second only to Harvard according to a 2009 American 
Enterprise Institute Study.[28] Amherst ranked 3rd in the 2016 Washington 
Monthly rankings, which focus on key research outputs, the quality level 
and total dollar amount of scientific (natural and social sciences) grants 
won, the number of graduates going on to earn Ph.D. degrees, and certain 
types of public service. According to The Princeton Review, Amherst ranks 
in the top 20 among all colleges and universities in the nation for "Students 
Satisfied With Financial Aid," "School Runs Like Butter," and "Top 10 Best 
Value Private Schools."[29] Amherst also participates in the University 
and College Accountability Network (U-CAN) developed by the National Association 
of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU). Amherst’s sustainability 
efforts earned it an overall grade of “A-” on the College Sustainability 
Report Card 2010 published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.[30] 
Amherst has been dubbed one of the "most selective" liberal arts colleges 
in the United States;[36] the Carnegie Foundation classifies Amherst as 
one of the "more selective" institutions whose first-year students’ test 
scores places these institutions in roughly the top fifth of baccalaureate 
institutions.[37] For the class first enrolled in Fall 2015, Amherst received 
8,568 applications and accepted 1,210 for a 14% acceptance rate.[3] Of 
the 477 enrolling, 53% were women.[3] In terms of class rank, 86% of enrolled 
freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school classes; 96% ranked in 
the top quarter.[3] The middle 50% range of SAT scores of enrolled freshmen 
was 680-780 for critical reading, 680-780 for math, and 680-770 for writing;[3] 
the middle 50% range of the ACT Composite score was 31-34.[3] Amherst's 
comprehensive tuition, room, and board fee for the 2012–13 academic year 
is $55,510. Once miscellaneous expenses are factored in the total cost 
to attend for the 2012–13 academic year amounts to $60,809–$63,259.[38] 
Despite its high cost of attendance, Amherst College meets the full demonstrated 
need of every admitted student.[39] Sixty percent of current students receive 
scholarship aid, and the average financial aid package award amounts to 
$41,150; the average net price of attendance is $13,809 per year. College 
expenditures exceed $85,000 per student each year.[40] In July 2007, Amherst 
announced that grants would replace loans in all financial aid packages 
beginning in the 2008-09 academic year. Amherst had already been the first 
school to eliminate loans for low-income students, and with this announcement 
it joined Princeton University, Cornell University and Davidson College, 
then the only colleges to completely eliminate loans from need-based financial 
aid packages. Increased rates of admission of highly qualified lower income 
students has resulted in greater equality of opportunity at Amherst than 
is usual at elite American colleges.[41] In the 2008-2009 academic year, 
Amherst College also extended its need-blind admission policy to international 
applicants.[42] Amherst College offers 36 fields of study (with 850 courses)[43] 
in the sciences, arts, humanities, mathematics and computer sciences, social 
sciences, foreign languages, classics, and several interdisciplinary fields 
(including premedical studies[44][45]) and provides an unusually open curriculum. 
Students are not required to study a core curriculum or fulfill any distribution 
requirements and may even design their own unique interdisciplinary major.[9] 
Freshmen may take advanced courses, and seniors may take introductory ones. 
Thirty-five percent of Amherst students in the class of 2007 were double 
majors.[46] Amherst College has been the first college to have undergraduate 
departments in the interdisciplinary fields of American Studies; Law, Jurisprudence 
and Social Thought; and Neuroscience[47][48] and has helped to pioneer 
other interdisciplinary programs, including Asian Languages and Civilizations.[49] 
The Amherst library is named for long-time faculty member, poet Robert 
Frost.[50] Amherst College has been recognized for its commitment to quality 
teaching with professor-student interaction. The student-faculty ratio 
is 8:1 and 90% of classes have fewer than 30 students.[51] Notable faculty 
members include, among others, modern literature and poetry critic William 
H. Pritchard, Beowulf translator Howell Chickering, Jewish and Latino studies 
scholar Ilan Stavans, novelist and legal scholar Lawrence Douglas, physicist 
Arthur Zajonc, Pulitzer Prize-winning Nikita Khrushchev biographer William 
Taubman, African art specialist Rowland Abiodun, Natural Law expert Hadley 
Arkes, Mathematician Daniel Velleman, Biblical scholar Susan Niditch, law 
and society expert Austin Sarat, and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Lewis 
Spratlan, professor emeritus of the music faculty.[52] The writings of 
Amherst College political science Professor Hadley Arkes about homosexuality 
led to a dispute in 2013 over whether a college seeking to create a diverse, 
respectful academic community should speak out when a faculty member disparages 
community members or should instead remain silent as a way to protect academic 
freedom.[53] The issue arose when a group of alumni petitioned the college 
trustees and President Biddy Martin to “dissociate the institution” from 
Arkes’s “divisive and destructive” views,[54] focusing particularly on 
his May 2013 comparison of homosexuality to bestiality, pedophilia and 
necrophilia.[55][56] The alumni said, “Amherst College cannot credibly 
maintain its professed commitment to be an inclusive community as long 
as it chooses to remain silent while a sitting professor disparages members 
of its community in media of worldwide circulation and accessibility.”[54] 
Martin disagreed, citing past debates over the college’s position on Vietnam 
War and apartheid in South Africa—issues on which the college initially 
remained silent but eventually took a public position. In such times, she 
said, colleges should “avoid taking institutional positions on controversial 
political matters, except in extraordinary circumstances” and should simultaneously 
both “protect their communities from discrimination and disrespect” and 
“cherish a diversity of viewpoints.”[57] Amherst is a member of the Five 
Colleges consortium, which allows its students to attend classes at four 
other Pioneer Valley institutions. These include Mount Holyoke College, 
Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
In addition to the 850 courses available on campus, Amherst students have 
an additional 5,300 classes to consider through the Consortium (without 
paying additional tuition) and access to 8 million library volumes. The 
Five Colleges are geographically close to one another and are linked by 
buses that run between the campuses.[58] The Five Colleges share resources 
and develop common academic programs. Museums10 is a consortium of local 
art, history and science museums. The Five College Dance Department is 
one of the largest in the nation.[59] The joint Astronomy department shares 
use of the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory, which contributed 
to work that won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics.[60] The Five College 
Coastal and Marine Sciences Program offers an interdisciplinary curriculum 
to undergraduates in the Five Colleges.[61] Amherst College is reducing 
its energy consumption through a computerized monitoring system for lighting 
and the use of an efficient cogeneration facility. The cogeneration facility 
features a gas turbine that generates electricity in addition to steam 
for heating the campus.[62] Amherst also operates a composting program, 
in which a portion of the food waste from dining halls is sent to a farmer 
in Vermont.[62] Amherst claims its athletics program as the oldest in the 
nation,[63] pointing to its compulsory physical fitness regimen put in 
place in 1860 (the mandate that all students participate in sports or pursue 
physical education has been discontinued).[64] One-third of the student 
body participates in sports at the intercollegiate level, and eighty percent 
participate in intramural and club sports teams.[63] The school participates 
in the NCAA's Division III, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and 
the New England Small College Athletic Conference, which includes Bates, 
Bowdoin, Colby, Connecticut College, Hamilton, Middlebury, Trinity, Tufts, 
Wesleyan, and Williams College.[65] Amherst is also one of the "Little 
Three," along with Williams and Wesleyan. A Little Three champion is informally 
recognized by most teams based on the head-to-head records of the three 
schools, but three-way competitions are held in some of the sports. Amherst 
has placed in the top ten of the NACDA Director's Cup in the NCAA Division 
III in seven of the last ten years, including fourth in 2007 and 2008 and 
third in 2009.[66] On May 3, 2009, Williams College and Amherst alumni 
played a game of vintage baseball at Wahconah Park according to 1859 rules 
to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the first college baseball game 
played on July 2, 1859, between the two schools.[67] Amherst fields several 
club athletic teams, including rugby union, water polo, ultimate, equestrian, 
mountain biking, crew, fencing, sailing and skiing. Intramural sports include 
soccer, tennis, golf, basketball, volleyball and softball. The sport of 
Ultimate was started and named at Amherst College in the mid-1960s by Jared 
Kass '69.[68][69] Amherst's resources, faculty, and academic life allow 
the college to enroll students with a range of talents, interests, and 
commitments. Students represent all fifty states, the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico, and fifty countries. Ninety-seven percent of students live 
on campus. Ninety-seven percent of Amherst freshmen return for their sophomore 
year; ninety-six percent graduate, among the highest retention and graduation 
rates in the country. There are more than 140 student groups at Amherst.[70] 
Students pursue their interests through student-led organizations funded 
by the student government, including a variety of cultural and religious 
groups, publications, fine and performing arts and political advocacy and 
service groups. Groups include a medieval sword-fighting club, a knitting 
club, and a club devoted to random acts of kindness, among others.[71] 
Community service groups and opportunities (locally—through the Center 
for Community Engagement, nationally, and internationally) have been a 
priority at Amherst and for former President Anthony Marx, who helped start 
a secondary school for black students in apartheid South Africa.[72] One 
of the longstanding traditions at the college involves the Sabrina Statue. 
Even year and odd year classes battle for possession of the historic statue, 
often engaging in elaborate pranks in the process.[73] In 2012, President 
Biddy Martin begin a community-wide review of the sexual misconduct and 
disciplinary policies at the College.[74][75] This review was sparked by 
several factors, including a fraternity's T-shirt design that critics alleged 
was misogynist[76] and allegations of inappropriate handling of a case 
of sexual assault in an essay by Angie Epifano published in The Amherst 
Student.[77] In January 2013, a college committee published a report noting 
Amherst's rate of sexual assault as similar to other colleges and universities, 
and making recommendations to address the problem.[78] After a complaint 
was filed by Epifano and an anonymous former student in November 2013,[79] 
the US Department of Education opened an investigation into the college's 
handling of sexual violence and potential violations of Title IX. In May 
2014, the Department of Education announced a list of 55 colleges and universities 
(including Amherst) currently under investigation.[80] A report from Amherst 
College stated that 2009 to 2011, Amherst reported 35 instances of "forcible 
sex offenses", a term that encompasses rape, attempted rape, and lesser 
forms of sexual contact.[81] In December 2015, a lawsuit against Amherst 
College was filed alleging that "teaching assistants [...] were encouraged 
to sleep with and socialize with students to boost enrollment in the Spanish 
department."[82][83][84][85] The original unofficial mascot of Amherst 
College, Lord Jeffrey Amherst, concerned many members of the Amherst community,[86] 
who sought to separate the school from the passive condoning of the wrongs 
committed by Lord Jeffrey Amherst, in particular, his advocating the use 
of biological warfare against Native Americans.[87] In May 2014, after 
a wild moose found its way onto the Amherst College campus and into the 
backyard of the house of the college president,[88] students organized 
a Facebook campaign to change the mascot of the school to a moose.[citation 
needed] The page grew rapidly in popularity, receiving over 900 "likes" 
in under two weeks,[citation needed] and inspiring both a Twitter and Tumblr 
account for the newly proposed mascot. On May 25, at the Commencement ceremony 
for the class of 2014, the moose mascot was mentioned by Biddy Martin in 
her address, and the Dining Hall served Moose Tracks ice cream in front 
of an ice sculpture of a moose.[89] In February 2015, discussion of a mascot 
change continued when the editorial board of the Amherst Student, the college's 
official student-run newspaper, came out in favor of "the moose-scot".[90] 
In November 2015 the student body and the faculty overwhelmingly voted 
to vacate the mascot; the decision to drop the mascot was made official 
on January 26, 2016 after student anti-racism protests on campus.[91][92] 
Although a relatively small college, Amherst has many accomplished alumni, 
including Nobel, Crafoord Prize and Lasker Award laureates, MacArthur Fellowship 
and Pulitzer Prize winners, National Medal of Science and National Book 
Award recipients, and Academy, Tony, Grammy Award and Emmy Award winners; 
a U.S. President, the current Sovereign Prince of Monaco, two Prime Ministers 
of Greece, as well as Uhuru Kenyatta, the fourth President of Kenya, a 
Chief Justice of the United States, three Speakers of the U.S. House of 
Representatives, a U.S. Poet Laureate, the legal architect of Brown v Board 
of Education.[93] and the inventor of the blood bank; leaders in science, 
religion, politics, the Peace Corps, medicine, law, education, communications, 
and business; and acclaimed actors, architects, artists, astronauts, engineers, 
human rights activists, inventors, musicians, philanthropists, and writers. 
There are approximately 20,000 living alumni, of which about 60% make a 
gift to Amherst each year—one of the highest alumni participation rates 
of any college in the country.[94] Coordinates: 42°22′15″N 72°31′01″W﻿
