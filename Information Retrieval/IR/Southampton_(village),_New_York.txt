Southampton is a village in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The 
village is named after the Earl of Southampton. The Village of Southampton 
is in the southeast part of the county in the Town of Southampton, and 
is colloquially known as Southampton, despite being part of the Town of 
Southampton. The population was 3,109 at the 2010 census.[1] Southampton 
is the oldest and largest of the communities that constitute the Hamptons. 
It is also arguably the commercial center of the southern "fork" of Long 
Island, serves as the home base for several region-wide businesses and 
has the area's only hospital. It is part of the summer colony known as 
The Hamptons, and is generally considered one of the area's two most prestigious 
communities. In addition to its status at the top town among the Hamptons 
villages and hamlets, Southampton Village is also viewed as a center of 
Old Money, a place defined by residents with significant inherited wealth 
and long standing social traditions. Southampton Village is part of the 
famed Palm Beach - Upper East Side - Southampton axis, referring to several 
other communities renowned for their extreme wealth, international fame 
and socially reserved atmospheres and the residents who travel between 
these communities and often have homes in or near each of these areas.[2] 
A large number of wealthy and influential people have homes in the "estate 
section" of the village, the area immediately north of the Atlantic ocean 
front. Southampton has historically been home to prominent residents including 
members of the Ford, Du Pont, Eisenhower, Vanderbilt and Morgan families.[3] 
Today, the village is itself home to approximately half of the billionaires 
who have residences in the eight hamlets and villages that constitute the 
Hamptons. [4] The presence of this group provides Southampton with its 
reputation for affluence and exclusivity. Southampton Village also has 
a very large year round population. Southampton Village has historically 
been the most populated community in the Hamptons. It is also the most 
diverse of the villages and hamlets that constitute the Hamptons. Southampton 
Village has the largest communities of African Americans, Hispanics and 
Asians (in percentage terms and in absolute numbers) in the Hamptons.[5] 
The incorporated Village of Southampton is headed by Mayor Mark Epley. 
This area is policed by the Southampton Village Police Department. Southampton, 
settled in 1640 and incorporated as a village in 1894, historically began 
with a small group of English Puritans who set sail from Lynn, Massachusetts, 
and landed on June 12, 1640, at what is now known as Conscience Point. 
It is the oldest English settlement in the state of New York and is named 
after the English Earl of Southampton. The Shinnecock tribe welcomed the 
arrival of the white settlers in 1640 and not only gave them land to live 
on, "Olde Towne", but also shared with the settlers their knowledge of 
planting corn and fertilizing it with fish, growing crops, digging clams 
and scallops from nearby bays and trapping game. During the 18th and 19th 
centuries, fishing, farming (especially potatoes and the local sweet corn) 
and duck raising were the predominant industries. The early settlers, with 
the help of a resident Shinnecock Indian guide, were led over an old woodland 
trail that is now North Sea Road to an ideal spot for their first settlement. 
There, at the head of what today is Old Town Pond, they constructed their 
first homes. The Shinnecock Reservation, established in 1701, is the oldest 
Native American reservation in the United States. A property called the 
Halsey House was a homestead by pioneer Thomas Halsey in 1640. A rare "first 
period" house was built in 1660 when Main Street, in the pioneer hamlet 
of Southampton, was first laid out. Its owner, Thomas Halsey, was one of 
the original families who bought property from the Shinnecocks in 1640. 
It is one of the oldest English-type frame houses in the state. Summer 
Colony Dr. Theodore Gaillard Thomas, a New York City physician is regarded 
at the founder of the resort community, also termed the Summer Colony, 
of Southampton. He convinced a number of his wealthy clients about the 
beauty and potential restorative nature of the rural environment of Southampton. 
His efforts to develop this resort community began in 1863. He proved very 
successful at establishing what grew into a very prominent and affluent 
community of summer residents. Dr. Thomas and his friends ultimately established 
many of the leading institutions in Southampton including the St. Andrews 
Dune Church, the Shinnecock Golf Club, the Meadow Club, the Southampton 
Beach Club and The Parrish Art Museum (now located in Water Mill, NY).[6] 
Over time, several of the other villages and hamlets in what has become 
called the Hamptons increasingly became a haven for affluent summer season 
vacationers. Southampton Village, which hosted the earliest summer community 
of socially prominent residents and was arguably the center for upper class 
Americans, grew larger and faster than the others. Southampton has served 
as home to members of the Ford, Du Pont, Morgan, Atterbury, Woolworth and 
Eisenhower families.[7] Current Status Southampton Village is today regarded 
as one of the premier summer resort areas in the country.[8] The community 
of summer residents occupy the top echelon of American social, political 
and financial circles. Accordingly, real estate is very expensive in the 
village. The Estate Area, which contains the majority of the homes for 
the very affluent residents, lies directly north of the Atlantic oceanfront 
and extends to Hill Street. Particular streets of note in the area include 
Ox Pasture Road, Halsey Neck Lane, Coopers Neck Lane, First Neck Lane and 
South Main Street. The homes around Lake Agawam, referred to by Dr. Thomas 
as "the very center of our Summer Colony" are particularly noteworthy for 
their architectural pedigree and historical provenance. The oceanfront 
lanes - Gin Lane and Meadow Lane - are generally the most expensive roads 
in the village. Meadow Lane in particular has been called Billionaire Lane, 
and cited as having among the most expensive residential real estate in 
the country.[9][10] Other areas in the village house the relatively large 
population of year round residents. These neighborhoods extend from Hill 
Street northwards to Route 27, east to the hamlet of Water Mill, and west 
to the area of Tuckahoe in Southampton Town. The Shinnecock Indian Reservation 
borders the village on its southwestern border. The Shinnecock Golf Club 
course, the oldest and one of the most prestigious golf courses in the 
country, borders the village on its northwest corner. The Art Village, 
a summer art school started by William Merritt Chase and funded by early 
residents of the Southampton Summer Colony, is still in existence, though 
now it is entirely private residences; no arts education is conducted in 
the Art Village any more. There are several working farms and agricultural 
preserves in the village.[11] Most of those properties are located in the 
Estate Section, particularly in the Wickapogue Road Historic District. 
Southampton Village boasts well regarded ocean beaches including Cooper's 
Beach, which was voted #3 in a recent national poll. In 2010 it was listed 
as America's top beach according to the annual list of the best American 
beaches compiled by Dr. Stephen Leatherman, AKA Dr. Beach.[12] Southampton
