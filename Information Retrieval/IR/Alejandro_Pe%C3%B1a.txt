Alejandro Peña Vásquez [ah-leh-hahn'-dro / pen'-nya / vahs'-kes] (born 
June 25, 1959), is a former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. Listed 
at 6' 1" [1.85 m], 200 lb. [91 k], he batted and threw right-handed. Peña 
made his Major League debut on August 13, 1981 (in time to be included 
on the roster for the 1981 National League Championship Series, but did 
not appear in the 1981 World Series) and made his last appearance on April 
13, 1996, while pitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1981–1989), New York 
Mets (1990–1991), Atlanta Braves (1991–1992; 1995), Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1994), Boston Red Sox (1995) and Florida Marlins (1995; 1996). Peña is 
currently the pitching coach for the Dominican Summer League Dodgers club. 
Peña is best known for his late season success with the Atlanta Braves 
in 1991. Acquired from the Mets at the end of August (he needed to be on 
Atlanta's roster on August 31 to pitch in the playoffs), Pena went 13-for-13 
in save opportunities, including saving Games 2 and 6 for Steve Avery in 
the 1991 NLCS. He blew a save in Game 3 of the 1991 World Series, but the 
Braves later won that game. He was on the mound for the final pitch of 
that classic series, giving up the base hit to Gene Larkin that won the 
title for the Minnesota Twins. Peña was the losing pitcher of Game 7. On 
September 11, 1991, Peña teamed with fellow Braves pitchers Kent Mercker 
and Mark Wohlers for a combined no-hitter against the San Diego Padres; 
Peña pitched the final inning of the 1–0 victory for a save. In 1992 he 
was hampered by tendinitis in his pitching elbow which caused the Braves 
to leave him off the World Series Roster and caused him to miss the 1993 
season. In 1995 he was reacquired by the Braves for their World Series 
run and was the winning pitcher of record for the first two games of their
