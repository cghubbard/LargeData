NBC Sports' acquisition of the exclusive media rights for the 2004 and 
2008 Summer Olympics, and the 2006 Winter Olympics. The agreements marked 
the first time that the same network had been awarded the rights to five 
consecutive Olympics.[10][13][14] In 2003, Ebersol led NBC to acquire the 
exclusive U.S. media rights to the 2010 Winter Games and the 2012 Summer
