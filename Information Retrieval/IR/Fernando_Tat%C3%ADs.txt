Fernando Tatís, Jr. (born January 1, 1975) is a Dominican former professional 
baseball third baseman. Over his 11-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, 
he played for the Texas Rangers, St. Louis Cardinals, Montreal Expos, Baltimore 
Orioles, and the New York Mets. Tatis holds the Major League record for 
RBIs in an inning, a feat that he achieved by hitting two grand slam home 
runs in one inning during a game on April 23, 1999, becoming the only player 
in Major League history to do so. At 17 years old, Tatís was signed as 
an amateur free agent by Omar Minaya and the Texas Rangers on August 25, 
1992. He played his first game in Major League Baseball with the Rangers, 
at third base, almost five years later on July 26, 1997, and went on to 
play 60 games with the Rangers in his rookie season. At the trade deadline 
on July 31, 1998, the Rangers traded Tatís along with Darren Oliver and 
Mark Little to the St. Louis Cardinals for Royce Clayton and Todd Stottlemyre. 
Tatís had the best season of his career in 1999 with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
He hit 34 home runs with 107 RBIs and 21 stolen bases, with a .298 batting 
average. On April 23, 1999, Tatís made baseball history when he hit two 
grand slams in one inning. As of 2016, he is still the only batter to accomplish 
this. Tatís hit both of his grand slams against the pitcher Chan Ho Park 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers. With his home run feat, Tatís also set a Major 
League record with eight runs batted in during a single inning. After playing 
in only 96 games for the Cardinals in 2000 because of an injury, Tatís 
was traded to the Montreal Expos along with Britt Reames for Dustin Hermanson 
and Steve Kline. Tatís played in just 208 games out of a possible 486 over 
three seasons with the Expos because of an assortment of physical injuries. 
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays invited Tatís to spring training in 2004, but 
he did not make the team and was released. Tatís next did not play pro 
baseball for two seasons and resided in the Dominican Republic. The Baltimore 
Orioles signed Tatís to a minor-league contract on November 25, 2005. Tatís 
returned to baseball in order to raise money to build a church.[1] He played 
most of the season for the AAA baseball, the Ottawa Lynx, eventually playing 
in 28 games for the Orioles after being called up on July 21, 2006.[2] 
In 2007, Tatís was invited to spring training with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
After being assigned to minor-league baseball camp, Tatís was granted his 
request to be released from his contract on March 14. Just nine days later, 
he signed a minor-league contract with the New York Mets, and spent the 
2007 season with its AAA affiliate, the New Orleans Zephyrs. On May 11, 
2008, Tatís was called up from the Zephyrs to replace Ángel Pagán. Tatís 
had started to play the outfield in the minor leagues in order to become 
a more diversified player.[3] On May 28, Tatís hit a "walk-off" double 
against Justin Miller to defeat the Florida Marlins in the bottom of the 
12th inning. This was Tatís's first career "walk-off" hit. Tatís played 
most of his time with the Mets in left field and right field because of 
injuries to the usual starters Moisés Alou and Ryan Church.[4] On September 
16, 2008, Tatís separated his shoulder after diving for a fly ball in a 
game against the Washington Nationals. The Mets team physician diagnosed 
the injury as being a Grade III separation, but Tatís missed the rest of 
the 2008 regular season. Despite missing the end of the season, on October 
23, 2008, Tatís received the Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year 
Award for the National League. Tatís was named to the Dominican Republic 
national baseball team for the 2009 World Baseball Classic as a replacement 
for Alex Rodriguez, who was injured. Tatís played intermittently for the 
Mets in 2009 and 2010. His last Major League game was on July 4, 2010. 
For his career, he batted .265 with 113 home runs and 448 RBIs. On October 
5, 2014, Tatís announced his retirement from professional baseball. Fernando, 
Jr.'s father, Fernando, Sr., was also a professional baseball player. He 
reached as high as Class AA in the Houston Astros system before retiring 
in 1978 and moving on to coaching and scouting Houston's minor leaguers. 
The elder Tatís disappeared from Fernando's life when he was four years 
old. The two were not reunited until 1997 when Tatís, Jr. was a rookie 
with the Texas Rangers. Rangers general manager Omar Minaya, who Tatís 
described as a father figure, helped to discover Tatís, Sr. residing in 
Sarasota, Florida.[5] Tatís' son, also named Fernando Tatís, Jr., is a 
shortstop prospect recently signed to the White Sox organization. He was 
traded to the San Diego Padres along with another player in exchange for
