Yokohama Stadium (横浜スタジアム, Yokohama Sutajiamu?) is a stadium in Naka Ward, 
Yokohama, Japan. It opened in 1978 and holds 30,000 people. It is primarily 
used for baseball and is the home field of the Yokohama DeNA BayStars. 
The stadium is unique, because it features dirt around the bases and pitcher's 
mound, but with dirt colored turf infield and base paths. The entire green 
portion of the field is now turf. The stadium is one of only three venues 
in Japan, with an American look (an all-grass outfield and infield, with 
dirt base paths), the others are Kobe Sports Park Baseball Stadium in Kobe 
and Mazda Stadium in Hiroshima. It hosted an Australian Rules Football 
match and drew the second largest crowd, for such an event, outside of 
Australia. Carlos Santana and Masayoshi Takanaka performed at the stadium 
on August 2, 1981. Japanese concert souvenir tour program for Santana/Takanaka, 
for their "Summer Live Super Session" tour of Japan. Michael Jackson performed 
at the stadium during his Bad World Tour in five sold out concerts, more 
than any other artist in Yokohama, for a total audience of 190,000 fans 
(about 38,000 people per concert) on September 25, 26, and 27, 1987 and 
October 3–4, 1987 and one of the concerts was recorded and released as 
VHS titled Michael Jackson Live in Japan. Tina Turner played 4 concerts 
for the first time at the stadium on March 1988 during Break Every Rule 
Tour. Madonna performed, on three consecutive nights, during her Blond 
Ambition World Tour on April 25–27, 1990. Her show on the 27th was filmed
