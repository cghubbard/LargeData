Harry M. Steinfeldt (September 29, 1877 â€“ August 17, 1914) was an American 
professional baseball player. A third baseman, Steinfeldt played in Major 
League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds, Chicago Cubs, and Boston Rustlers. 
He batted and threw right-handed. Steinfeldt was the starting third baseman 
for the Cubs in the final game of the 1908 World Series, the team's last 
championship until their victory in 2016. He was the fourth infielder on 
a team that gained fame for a double-play combination of "Tinker to Evers 
to Chance." Steinfeldt was born in St. Louis, Missouri on September 29, 
1877, to German immigrants. His family moved to Fort Worth, Texas, when 
he was five years old. He initially pursued a theatrical career.[1] While 
touring Texas in a minstrel show, Steinfeldt played baseball in a town 
where his show was performing.[1] His success at baseball led him to sign 
his first professional contract, debuting in minor league baseball with 
the Houston Magnolias/Mudcats of the Class B Texas-Southern League in 1895. 
The next year, he played for the Galveston Sandcrabs and Fort Worth Panthers 
of the Class C Texas Association. In 1897, Steinfeldt played for the Detroit 
Tigers of the Class A Western League.[1] In October 1897, the Cincinnati 
Reds of the National League (NL) purchased Steinfeldt from Detroit. Debuting 
in the major leagues for the Reds in 1898, he filled in for Bid McPhee, 
Tommy Corcoran, and Charlie Irwin as a utility infielder. When the Reds 
released Irwin during the 1901 season, Steinfeldt became the Reds' starting 
third baseman.[1] He led the NL in doubles in 1903 with 32.[2] On October 
24, 1905, the Reds traded Steinfeldt with Jimmy Sebring to the Chicago 
Cubs for Jake Weimer.[3] He led the NL in hits in 1906 with 176 and tied 
with Jim Nealon for most runs batted in (RBIs) with 83. His .327 batting 
average finished second, behind Honus Wagner (.339).[4] Steinfeldt set 
a major league record with three sacrifice flies in a game in 1909. Ernie 
Banks tied the record in 1961.[5] Steinfeldt is the only member of the 
Cubs' infield, which also included Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, and Frank 
Chance, who was left out of Franklin Pierce Adams' famous poem "Baseball's 
Sad Lexicon".[6] On April 5, 1911, the St. Paul Saints of the American 
Association purchased Steinfeldt from the Cubs.[7] On May 25, 1911, St 
Paul traded Steinfeldt to the Boston Rustlers for Art Butler and Josh Clarke.[8] 
Steinfeldt fell ill in July 1911, leaving the team.[9] It was later identified 
as a nervous breakdown.[1] The Rustlers released Steinfeldt after the season. 
In 1912, Steinfeldt returned to minor league baseball. He managed the Cincinnati 
Pippins of the United States Baseball League, but the league folded in 
midseason.[1] He also played for the Louisville Colonels of the American 
Association, but was released in May.[10] In June, he became the manager 
of the Meriden Metropolitans of the Cotton States League.[11] Steinfeldt 
died in Bellevue, Kentucky after a long illness, at the age of 36, and 
is interred at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.[12] The death certificate 
of the 37-year-old indicates that he died of a cerebral hemorrhage.[13]
