June 30, 2016 Busch Stadium, St Louis. MO The Cardinals–Royals rivalry 
is a Major League Baseball (MLB) interleague rivalry between the St. Louis 
Cardinals of the National League (NL) Central division and the Kansas City 
Royals of the American League (AL) Central division. The rivalry between 
the two clubs is also known as the Show-Me Series or the I-70 Series, due 
to the fact that the two cities are both located in the U.S. state of Missouri 
(whose nickname is the "Show Me State") and are also connected by Interstate 
70. Both teams played against each other for the first time in the 1985 
World Series, which the Royals won 4-3 in seven games. Owing to their geographical 
proximity, these two teams face each other every regular season in interleague 
play. The Cardinals are one of Major League Baseball's oldest teams, having 
played in the National League in St. Louis since they were formed in 1882 
as the Brown Stockings. The Royals joined the majors in 1969 as one of 
the American League's first expansion teams. Until major league baseball 
introduced interleague play in 1997, the only opportunity for the Cardinals 
and the Royals to meet was in the 1985 World Series. The two teams had 
gone through several periods of prolonged success (and several notable 
droughts) leading up to the World Series. The Cardinals fell on hard times 
in the 1970s after winning the 1964 and the 1967 World Series and appearing 
in the 1968 World Series. The Kansas City Royals had become one of the 
best teams in baseball by the late 1970s, reaching the American League 
playoffs six times from 1976 to 1984, including the 1980 World Series. 
After several down years, the Cardinals emerged as a pennant contender 
in the early 1980s, winning the 1982 World Series. The first official meeting 
between the Cardinals and Royals was in the 1985 World Series. This marked 
only the second time in baseball history that two teams from the state 
of Missouri met in the World Series. The first time was in 1944, when the 
Cardinals played against the St. Louis Browns. That series also marked 
the last time to date that a World Series was held entirely in one ballpark, 
as the Cardinals and Browns shared Sportsman's Park at the time. The Cardinals 
won the National League East division by three games over the New York 
Mets and then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2 in the National League 
Championship Series. The Royals won the American League West division by 
one game over the California Angels and then defeated the Toronto Blue 
Jays 4-3 in the American League Championship Series. The Royals lost the 
first two games of the World Series at their home stadium and were on the 
verge of elimination, down 1-0 in the bottom of the ninth in game six, 
when umpire Don Denkinger made a controversial call, ruling runner Jorge 
Orta safe at first. Orta was later thrown out at third on a botched sacrifice 
attempt and did not score. The Royals would go on to win the game 2-1 in 
the bottom of the ninth following the put-out of Orta (the only out recorded 
in the inning). The Royals then went on to win game seven the following 
day 11-0 for their first World Series title. The Royals became the first 
team ever to win the World Series after dropping games 1 and 2 at home. 
The Royals did not return to the MLB postseason for 29 years, winning one 
of the American League wild cards in 2014 and advancing to the 2014 World 
Series. The following season, they claimed their first title since 1985 
by winning the 2015 World Series. Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog had been 
the Royals' manager from 1975 to 1979. He led Kansas City to the franchise's 
first three playoff appearances – in 1976, 1977, and 1978 – before getting 
fired just shortly after the Royals were eliminated from the playoffs in 
1979. The introduction of interleague play to major league baseball in 
1997 allowed the I-70 Series to be revived in non-exhibition games. The 
teams have played every year since 1997, with several changes in format 
– variously playing 3-game, 4-game and 6-game season series. Through the 
2015 season, the Cardinals lead the interleague series, 50–36.[1] The first 
few seasons of the series were nearly even, with the Cardinals holding 
a slight advantage with a 14–13 record through the 2003 season. The Royals 
took two out of three from the Cardinals in 2010 behind victories from 
starting pitchers Zack Greinke and Bruce Chen. In 2011, the Cardinals won 
four of the six match-ups, three of them in the eighth inning or later. 
The last four games in the series were one-run games. In 2012, the Cardinals 
again won four of the six games, on the strength of a three-game sweep 
in Kansas City over June 22–24. The Royals won the season series in 2014 
for the first time since 2010, taking 3 out of 4. They won the first two 
games in St. Louis 6-0 and 8-7 respectively, and after losing Game 3 5-2 
in 11 in Kansas City, won the final game 3-2 after being down 2-0 late.
