The American Negro League (ANL) was one of several Negro leagues established 
during the period in the United States in which organized baseball was 
segregated. The ANL operated on the East Coast of the United States in 
1929. The Eastern Colored League (ECL) had been the eastern of two major 
Negro leagues from 1923 through 1927 until its collapse during the 1928 
season. Next winter the American Negro League was established by five former 
ECL teams— the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, the Baltimore Black Sox, 
the traveling Cuban Stars, the Hilldale Club of Darby, Pennsylvania, and 
the Lincoln Giants of New York City—along with the Homestead Grays, an 
important independent club. The ANL operated a split season: first half 
and second-half schedules with a planned playoff for a pennant in a post-season 
series between the two winners. The Baltimore Black Sox, led by player-manager 
Dick Lundy and Hall of Fame first baseman Jud Wilson, won both halves and 
they were awarded the pennant without a playoff. The league did not organize 
for the 1930 season, and it would not be until 1933 that an eastern Negro 
league would last for a full season. Beside the downward economic spiral, 
bitter controversy in Baltimore and Philadelphia, about the local clubs 
continuing reliance on white umpires, may have been fatal to the league.[1] 
The ANL made a conscientious effort, unusual for the Negro leagues, to 
compile statistics for the league's players. These were published at season's
