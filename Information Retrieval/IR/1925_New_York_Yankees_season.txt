The 1925 New York Yankees season was the team's 23rd season in New York 
and its 25th overall. The team finished with a record of 69â€“85, in 7th 
place, 30 games behind the Washington Senators. New York was managed by 
Miller Huggins. The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. All members of this 
team are now deceased. This season was marred by Babe Ruth's infamous "stomach 
ache" that kept him out a good portion of the season. It was the club's 
lowest finish, in both percentage and place in the standings, since their 
7th-place finish in 1913. It was also the first time they had finished 
below .500 since 1918. The Yankees would regroup and it would be 40 years 
before they would finish below .500 again. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
