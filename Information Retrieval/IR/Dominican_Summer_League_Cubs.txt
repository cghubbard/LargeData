The Dominican Summer League Cubs or DSL Cubs are a rookie league affiliate 
of the Chicago Cubs based in the Dominican Republic.[1] They play in the 
Boca Chica North Division of the Dominican Summer League. The team began 
in 1991 with a joint affiliation with the Kansas City Royals.[2] An affiliation 
with the Colorado Rockies was added in 1992.[3] For the 1993 season, the 
team shared an affiliation with the Texas Rangers.[4] They then shared 
an affiliation with the San Diego Padres for the next three seasons (1994–1996).[5] 
The team became independently affiliated with the Cubs in 1997. From 2008 
to 2012, the team split into two squads as DSL Cubs 1 and DSL Cubs 2, but 
became a unified team again for the 2013 season.[6] Pitchers Catchers Infielders
