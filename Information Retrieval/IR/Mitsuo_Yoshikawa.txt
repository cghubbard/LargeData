Mitsuo Yoshikawa (吉川 光夫, born April 6, 1988) is a Japanese professional 
baseball player. A pitcher, he plays for the Yomiuri Giants in Nippon Pro 
Baseball. Yoshikawa was a first-round pick of the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters 
out of high school. He went 4-3 with a 3.66 ERA in 2007, with 46 walks 
in 93 1/3 innings. In the 2007 Japan Series, the 19-year-old relieved Ryan 
Glynn in game two but walked two batters following three free passes issued 
by Glynn to set a Japan Series record for one team in one inning. Two games 
later, manager Trey Hillman gave Yoshikawa the ball, only the 5th rookie 
out of high school to start a Japan Series game and the first since Kazuhisa 
Ishii. Yoshikawa again struggled with his control, taking the loss to the 
Chunichi Dragons (who would win the Series). Overall, he allowed seven 
walks, three hits and three runs (two earned) in six innings in the Series. 
The Fukuoka native fell to 2-4, 6.23 in his seven starts in 2008, walking 
22 in 34 2/3 innings. #34 was 0-2 with a 6.61 ERA and 10 walks in 16 1/3 
innings in 2009 and 0-4 with a 6.92 ERA and .330 opponent average in 2010. 
He was 0-5 with a 4.74 ERA in 2011 to bring his career record to 6-18. 
He then turned things around in a big way in 2012, going 14-5 with a 1.71 
ERA. He was among the Pacific League leaders in wins (2nd, 3 behind Tadashi 
Settsu), ERA (1st by .16 over Masahiro Tanaka), complete games (tied for 
3rd with 5, even with Yoshihisa Naruse and Hiroshi Kisanuki), shutouts 
(3, tied for first with Kenji Otonari and Tanaka), innings (173 2/3, 7th, 
between Otonari and Tanaka), walks (45, 6th between Otonari and Ishii), 
strikeouts (158, 2nd, 11 behind Tanaka) and WHIP (0.88, 1st, .08 ahead 
of runner-up Takayuki Kishi). In the 2012 Japan Series, he did not fare 
as well, giving up 9 runs on 13 hits in 6 2/3 IP and losing games 1 and 
5 as the Fighters fell to the Yomiuri Giants. He did win the Best Nine 
as the PL's top pitcher and also easily took home the 2012 Pacific League 
Most Valuable Player Award, with 181 first-place votes out of 210.[1] He 
lost out the Sawamura Award to Settsu, who was a distant second place in 
the MVP voting. On 2 November 2016, it was revealed that Yoshikawa had 
been included in a trade with the Yomiuri Giants with Shingo Ishikawa for 
Giants outfielder Taishi Ota and Katsuhiko Kumon.[2][3][4] With an overhand 
delivery Yoshikawa throws a fastball (tops out at 94 mph), slider, changeup,
