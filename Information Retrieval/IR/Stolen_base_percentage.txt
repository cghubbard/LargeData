Stolen base percentage is a statistic used in baseball. A player's stolen 
base percentage (aka SB%) measures his rate of success in stealing bases. 
Because stolen bases tend to help a team less than times caught stealing 
hurt, a player needs to have a high stolen base percentage in order to 
contribute much value to his team. A commonly used figure is that a player 
needs to succeed about 2/3 of the time to break even. With 300 minimum 
career attempts, Carlos Beltr√°n currently holds the record for highest 
Stolen base percentage in the Major Leagues, with .881, with Tim Raines 
in second, with .847. Total Baseball developed a statistic related to stolen 
base percentage called "Stolen Base Runs" or SBR. (.3 x Stolen Bases) - 
(.6 x Caught Stealing) This Total Baseball statistic is aimed at quantifying 
base-stealing. Numerous statistical studies done by Total Baseball have 
shown that the break even success rate for steals (the rate at which an 
attempt to steal is neither helping nor hurting the team in terms of total 
runs scored) is about 67%. Each successful steal adds approximately .3 
runs to a team's total runs scored which is much less than often believed. 
Therefore, the statistic is meant to estimate the impact of base-stealers, 
which, other than the elite base-stealers, rarely amounts to more than
