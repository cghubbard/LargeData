The St. Louis Cardinals, a Major League baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in St. Louis, Missouri, have competed in the National League (NL) since 
1892, and in the American Association (AA) from 1882 to 1891.[a] They have 
won 11 World Series titles, one additional interleague championship and 
were co-champions (tied) in another prior to the modern World Series. Known 
as the Cardinals from 1900 to the present, the St. Louis franchise were 
also known as the Brown Stockings (1882), Browns (1883–98), and Perfectos 
(1899).[2] A total of 37 players and other personnel associated with the 
Cardinals have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and 
Museum in Cooperstown, New York. The first former Cardinals players to 
be inducted into Baseball Hall of Fame were John McGraw and Cy Young in 
1937, the second year of the Museum's annual balloting. Rogers Hornsby 
was the first to be inducted as Cardinal, which occurred in 1942. Of the 
37 former Cardinals elected to the Hall of Fame, 17 have been inducted 
as Cardinals and nine with the Cardinals logo on their cap. The latest 
former Cardinals personnel to be inducted were Tony La Russa and Joe Torre, 
which occurred in 2014. In addition, two separate awards – the Ford Frick 
Award and J. G. Taylor Spink Award – while not conferring the status of 
enshrining their recipients as members of the Hall of Fame, honor the works 
of a total of six sportswriters and broadcasters in connection with their 
coverage of the Cardinals.[3][4] The Cardinals also have a franchise hall 
of fame known as the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum located within 
Ballpark Village adjacent to Busch Stadium, the Cardinals' home stadium.[5]
