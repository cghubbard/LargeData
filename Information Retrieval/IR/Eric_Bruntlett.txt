Eric Kevin Bruntlett (born March 29, 1978) is an American former Major 
League Baseball player most notable for his years as a reserve infielder 
and recording an unassisted triple play. He won a World Series title with 
the Phillies in 2008 and was on their 2009 NL-pennant Championship team. 
Bruntlett also played for the Houston Astros on their 2005 NL-pennant Championship 
team and the New York Yankees organizations. Bruntlett was born in Lafayette, 
Indiana and is a 1996 graduate of William Henry Harrison High School in 
West Lafayette, Indiana[1] where he was a two-time All-Indiana selection 
in both baseball and football. He attended Stanford University. During 
his tenure as a member of the Cardinal, Stanford made three appearances 
in the College World Series. Bruntlett was drafted by the Houston Astros 
in the 9th Round of the 2000 Amateur Entry Draft.[2] He was assigned to 
the Martinsville Astros. He quickly progressed through the minor league 
system and reached the major leagues in 2003 with Houston. During his first 
years with the Astros, Bruntlett primarily served as a backup to shortstop 
Adam Everett but also played second base, third base, and the outfield. 
His best season was in 2006, hitting .277 in 73 games and posting a .412 
batting average as a pinch hitter. On November 7, 2007, Bruntlett was traded 
to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Brad Lidge for Geoff Geary, Michael 
Bourn, and Mike Costanzo.[3] Bruntlett hit .217 with 46 hits, 2 home runs, 
and 15 RBIs. His biggest mark was left in the post-season. He hit a home 
run in Game 2 of the World Series followed by a game-winning run in Game 
3. Bruntlett would cap off his World Series performance by scoring the 
series-clinching run in Game 5, allowing the Phillies to win their first 
World Series since 1980 and second overall. Bruntlett performed the fifteenth 
unassisted triple play of the modern era in the bottom of the ninth inning 
on August 23, against the New York Mets at Citi Field, when he caught a 
line drive from Jeff Francoeur, tagged second base to double off Luis Castillo, 
and tagged Daniel Murphy as he was running to second base. Both Castillo 
and Murphy had reached base on misplays by Bruntlett.[4] It was the second 
game-ending unassisted triple play in Major League Baseball history and 
the first in the National League, preserving a 9â€“7 Phillies win.[5][6] 
Rather than accepting an assignment to Triple-A, Bruntlett was released 
by the Phillies on November 16. On December 28, 2009, Bruntlett signed 
a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. He also received 
an invitation to Spring Training.[7] He was reassigned at the end of Spring 
Training to minor league camp.[8] He was released on June 2, 2010. On June 
17, 2010, Bruntlett signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees; 
he was granted free agency on November 6, 2010. He decided to retire from 
baseball and be a stay-at-home dad rather than spend another year in AAA.[9]
