Ralph Allen Garr (born December 12, 1945) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. Garr was a free swinger[1] with remarkable talent for hitting 
to all fields, a very valuable skill because fielders could never predict 
how to set up their defense when Garr came to the plate. A career .306 
hitter with amazing speed, Garr batted .300 or better five times during 
his career. Garr was born in Monroe, Louisiana, and worked as a shoe shine 
boy at a local barber shop growing up.[2] After graduation from Lincoln 
High School in Ruston, Louisiana, he attended historically black Grambling 
State University in Grambling, Louisiana.[3] In 1967, as a second baseman 
for the Grambling Tigers baseball team, he led the National Association 
of Intercollegiate Athletics with a record .585 batting average to lead 
his team to a 35â€“1 regular-season mark. His accomplishment earned mention 
in Sports Illustrated's "Faces In The Crowd"[4] right around the same time 
he was being drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the third round of the 1967 
Major League Baseball draft. Though Garr was a fast runner and good contact 
hitter, he was a below average infielder.[5] He was converted to an outfielder 
with the Shreveport Braves in 1968, and remained in the outfield for the 
rest of his career. After two minor league seasons in which he batted .287 
with 53 runs batted in, Garr made the jump from double A to the majors 
in September 1968. The speedy Garr appeared in eleven games with the Braves, 
but never needed his glove once, as he was used as a pinch hitter or pinch 
runner in each of his appearances, and never once was kept in the game. 
Regardless, he earned an invite to Spring training 1969, and started the 
season as the Braves' everyday left fielder when Rico Carty dislocated 
his shoulder.[6] Upon Carty's return, he was optioned to the triple A Richmond 
Braves,[7] but returned in September when rosters expanded. Overall, he 
batted .222 in 22 games. Garr again made the Braves out of Spring training 
1970, and resumed the role he had at the end of the 1968 & 1969 seasons. 
He appeared in sixteen games with the Braves through May, but had already 
earned a reputation as something of a defensive liability at this point 
in his career, and never once took the field. He was optioned back to Richmond 
at the end of May, and went on to bat an International League record .386 
with seven home runs, 51 RBIs and a league best 39 stolen bases.[8] He 
returned to Atlanta in September as a fourth outfielder, and batted .301 
in 91 plate appearances. Rico Carty injured his left knee playing Winter 
ball in the Dominican Republic,[9] and was lost for the entire 1971 season. 
Garr seized the opportunity, batting over .400 through the middle of May, 
and earning the nick-name "Road Runner" due to his speed. On May 10, against 
Tom Seaver and the New York Mets, Garr hit a solo home run with two outs 
in the tenth inning to tie the game. He hit a second home run in the twelfth 
for the walk-off victory.[10] He became so popular with fans in Atlanta 
that the Braves negotiated exclusive big-league baseball rights with Warner 
Bros. Cartoons to use animated scenes of the Looney Tunes character Road 
Runner on the scoreboard, while the calliope erected behind right field 
went "beep-beep" like the cartoon character every time Garr reached first 
base.[11] By the end of the season, Garr's batting average cooled off to 
.343, good for second best in the National League to the St. Louis Cardinals' 
Joe Torre. He also scored a career high 101 runs batting second in the 
Braves' batting order. Unfortunately, Garr's defensive short-comings (he 
led N.L. outfielders with eleven errors) caused him to lose his starting 
job in left field when Carty returned to the Braves in 1972. He still appeared 
in 134 games and managed a .962 fielding percentage manning all three outfield 
spots. His .325 batting average was again second best in the league (this 
time to the Chicago Cubs' Billy Williams). At the end of the season, Carty 
was traded to the Texas Rangers, opening a permanent spot for Garr.[12] 
Garr again put up solid offensive numbers in 1973 (.299 batting average, 
11 home runs, 94 runs scored & career high 55 RBIs & 35 stolen bases), 
but his weak glove made him trade-bait at the 1973 Winter meetings. Needing 
to strengthen their infield defense as well, the Braves had a deal in place 
that would have sent Garr to the Philadelphia Phillies for shortstop Larry 
Bowa,[13] but it fell through. Instead, he remained in Atlanta, and put 
together the best season of his career. He flirted with a .400 batting 
average for much of the first half of the season. He had 149 hits heading 
into the All-Star break that year, a record that stands to this day, to 
earn selection to the National League All-Star team (he went 0-for-3 with 
a strikeout).[14] He ended the season with a league best .353 average, 
and also led the N.L. in hits (214) and triples (17). Garr spent much of 
his early career believing that he was under paid by the Braves. After 
a career year, Garr sought a raise to $114,500 for the 1975 season, more 
than double what he received in 1974. The Braves countered with $85,000.[15] 
The contract dispute went to arbitration, with Garr winning[16] to become 
the highest paid player on the team, and the first player in major league 
history to double his salary through arbitration.[17] Despite an excellent 
Spring, and going into the season with confidence,[18] Garr's average dipped 
to .278 in 1975. He did, however, lead the league in triples (11) for a 
second year in a row. After the season, he and infielder Larvell Blanks 
were traded to the Chicago White Sox for Ken Henderson, Dick Ruthven and 
Ozzie Osborn.[19] Disarray was something of a theme for the 1976 White 
Sox as Jorge Orta, the second baseman with the 1975 team Chuck Tanner managed 
was used at third and left field in 1976 by new manager Paul Richards.[20] 
Likewise, Garr's role with the Chisox in 1976 was similar to the one he 
had with the Braves in 1972; he had no regular outfield position, and his 
playing time was split evenly between all three outfield spots. The formula 
proved unsuccessful as the Sox narrowly avoided a hundred losses in 1976. 
For his part, Garr batted an even .300, and was second on the team to Orta 
with 63 runs scored. Bob Lemon replaced Richards at the helm in 1977,[21] 
returning Orta to second base, and returning Garr to left field. The Chisox 
did a complete 180 that year as they won ninety games to finish third in 
the American League West. Garr batted an even .300 for the second year 
in a row, while improving substantially in every other offensive category. 
His fielding also improved as he logged a career high .987 fielding percentage. 
Garr had an off year in 1978, putting up career lows in just about every 
offensive category. His notoriously bad fielding was also becoming an issue 
again. He and pitcher Francisco Barrios became embroiled in a fight on 
August 10, following a loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, over an incident 
in their August 7 match-up with the Kansas City Royals. With Barrios pitching, 
Garr threw a ball he fielded off the wall to the wrong base, allowing a 
runner to score.[22] It was the second run-in between the two.[23] Garr 
started the 1979 season in left field, but shortly after Tony La Russa 
replaced Don Kessinger as White Sox manager, Garr was replaced by a revolving 
door of left fielders, with Alan Bannister, Thad Bosley, Junior Moore and 
Wayne Nordhagen all manning the position at one point or another. Rumors 
circulated that it was by Garr's choice; he refused to take the field following 
an August 5 rock concert held at Comiskey Park that left the field in tattered 
condition[24] (American League President Lee MacPhail actually canceled 
games at Comiskey later in the month due to the poor conditions of the 
outfield). On September 20, with only nine games left on the schedule, 
Garr's contract was sold to the California Angels. Garr was used as a designated 
hitter in California, but managed to bat just .167 in that role, and was 
released on June 6, 1980. He became part-owner and a part-time worker at 
Kaloche doughnut shop in Houston, Texas following his retirement. When 
the 1984 Winter meetings were held in Houston, Garr attended, seeking a 
scouting or coaching job. Baseball legend and Garr's former teammate, Hank 
Aaron, the Braves' director of player development, offered Garr a position 
as roving scout and minor-league base-running coach.[25] He was inducted 
into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1985,[26] Grambling State University 
Alumni Hall of Fame in 1991,[27] the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame in 2006[28] 
and the International League Hall of Fame in 2008.[29] In his 2012 film, 
Trouble with the Curve, Clint Eastwood's character, fictional Braves scout 
Gus Lobel, is credited with signing Dusty Baker, Dale Murphy, Tom Glavine, 
Chipper Jones and Garr.[30] The scout who actually signed Garr was Mel
