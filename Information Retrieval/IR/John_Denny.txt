John Allen Denny (born November 8, 1952) is a former right-handed Major 
League Baseball pitcher from 1974 to 1986 for the St. Louis Cardinals, 
Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Phillies, and Cincinnati Reds.[1] He won 
the Cy Young Award in 1983. Denny was born in Prescott, Arizona and attended 
Prescott High School. He excelled at sports there, playing football and 
basketball as well as baseball.[2] In the 1970 amateur draft, he was selected 
by the Cardinals in the 29th round. He made his professional debut that 
year at the age of 17. Denny pitched for the Triple-A Tulsa Oilers in 1974 
and went 9-8 with a 3.75 earned run average.[3] He made his major league 
debut in September. The next season, Denny started back in Tulsa but he 
pitched well and soon entered the St. Louis starting rotation. In 1976, 
Denny had a breakout season. He led the National League in ERA at 2.52 
and was the best pitcher on the club. Due to poor run support, his record 
was just 11-9. Denny also pitched well in 1978, going 14-11 with a 2.96 
ERA, but he fell off badly in 1979 and was traded to Cleveland. He continued 
his inconsistent pitching with the Indians, going 24-23 for them in three 
seasons. He pitched three straight shutouts late in 1981[4] and was rewarded 
with a three-year, $2 million contract after the season. Nine months later, 
he was traded to the Phillies. In 1983, Denny enjoyed the best season of 
his career, going 19-6 with a 2.37 ERA. He topped the NL in wins and winning 
percentage and was second in ERA. He also led the Phillies to the NL championship. 
In that year's Cy Young Award voting, he received 20 of 24 first-place 
votes to win going away.[4] Denny suffered arm problems late in his career. 
After 1983, he spent two more years in Philadelphia before being traded 
once again, to Cincinnati. He went 11-10 in 1986 and then retired from 
baseball. Denny was rehabilitation coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks organization
