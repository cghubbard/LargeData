The International League Hall of Fame is an American baseball hall of fame 
which honors players, managers, and executives of the International League 
(IL). It was created by the International League Baseball Writers' Association 
in 1947 to honor those individuals who made significant contributions to 
the league. The Hall of Fame inducted its first class of nine former players, 
managers, and league officials in 1947. A plaque was unveiled at the IL's 
New York City offices located in the Ruppert Building at 535 Fifth Avenue. 
Today, the plaque has no permanent home, but exists as a traveling display 
which visits a number of the league's ballparks each season.[1] From 1949 
through 1960, the league inducted up to three new members each year. Only 
one member was inducted annually from 1961 to 1963. After the cessation 
of the league's Baseball Writers' Association, the Hall of Fame became 
dormant from 1964 to 2006. The Hall was reestablished in 2007 to commemorate 
the League's 125th season of play in 2008. Two new members were inducted 
in 2007, and plans were made to elect up to 28, 14, and 7 inductees, respectively, 
over the next three years. Since 2011, up to three inductees have been 
voted into the Hall annually. As of 2016, 118Â individuals have been inducted
