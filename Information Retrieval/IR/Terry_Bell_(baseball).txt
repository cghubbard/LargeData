Terence William Bell (born October 27, 1962 in Dayton, Ohio) is a former 
Major League Baseball catcher. He was the first round selection of the 
Seattle Mariners in the 1983 Major League Baseball Draft,[1] two selections 
ahead of Roger Clemens. Bell was originally drafted by the Oakland Athletics 
in the sixth round of the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft as a senior 
at Fairmont East High School in Kettering, Ohio, but opted to attend Old 
Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia instead. While attending Old Dominion, 
he participated in the 1982 Amateur World Series and the 1983 Pan American 
Games. When the Monarchs won the Sun Belt East Division Championship in 
1983, he was named a Sporting News All-American and the Sun Belt Conference 
MVP.[2] Bell was considered the top defensive catcher in the draft when 
the Mariners selected Bell with the seventeenth overall pick in 1983. However, 
he batted just .176 in his first professional season for the Midwest League's 
Wausau Timbers, and displayed very little power. In three seasons in the 
Mariners' organization, he batted .233 with two home runs and 64 runs batted 
in. On May 21, 1986, he was dealt to the Kansas City Royals for relief 
pitcher Mark Huismann.[3] With the Royals, Bell received a September call-up 
in 1986. He appeared in eight games, and went hitless in five plate appearances 
with two walks. On September 3, 1987, after spending the entire 1987 season 
in the minors with the Memphis Chicks, he was the player to be named later 
in a mid-season deal with the Atlanta Braves for reliever Gene Garber. 
He appeared in one game for the Braves, and struck out pinch hitting for 
Ed Olwine.[4] He continued to play minor league ball for the Braves through 
1989. In seven minor league seasons, he batted .231 with eight home runs
