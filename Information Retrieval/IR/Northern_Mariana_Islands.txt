The Northern Mariana Islands, officially the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands (CNMI; Chamorro: Sankattan Siha Na Islas Mariånas; Carolinian: 
Commonwealth Téél Falúw kka Efáng llól Marianas), is an insular area and 
commonwealth of the United States consisting of fifteen islands in the 
northwestern Pacific Ocean. The CNMI includes all islands in the Mariana 
Archipelago except Guam, which is the southernmost island of the chain 
and a separate U.S. territory. The United States Department of the Interior 
cites a landmass of 183.5 square miles (475.26 km2).[4] According to the 
2010 United States Census, 53,883 people were living in the CNMI at that 
time.[5] The vast majority of the population resides on Saipan, Tinian, 
and Rota. The other islands of the Northern Marianas are sparsely inhabited; 
the most notable among these is Pagan, which for various reasons over the 
centuries has experienced major population flux but has formerly had residents 
numbering in the thousands.[6][7] The administrative center is Capitol 
Hill, a village in northwestern Saipan. However, most publications consider 
Saipan to be the capital because the island is governed as a single municipality. 
The first people of the Mariana Islands immigrated at some point between 
4000 BC and 2000 BC from Southeast Asia. After first contact with Spaniards, 
they eventually became known as the Chamorros, a Spanish word similar to 
Chamori, the name of the indigenous caste system's higher division. The 
ancient people of the Marianas raised colonnades of megalithic capped pillars 
called latte stones upon which they built their homes. The Spanish reported 
that by the time of their arrival, the largest of these were already in 
ruins, and that the Chamorros believed the ancestors who had erected the 
pillars lived in an era when people possessed supernatural abilities. Archeologists 
in 2013 posited that the first people to settle in the Marianas may have 
made what was at that point the longest uninterrupted ocean-crossing voyage 
in human history, and that archeological evidence indicates Tinian may 
have been the first Pacific island outside of Asia to have been settled.[8] 
The first European explorer of the area, the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand 
Magellan, arrived in 1521. He landed on Guam, the southernmost island of 
the Marianas and claimed the archipelago for Spain. The Spanish ships were 
met offshore by the native Chamorros, who delivered refreshments and then 
helped themselves to a small boat belonging to Magellan's fleet. This led 
to a cultural clash: in Chamorro tradition there was little private property 
and taking something one needed, such as a boat for fishing, did not count 
as stealing. The Spanish did not understand this custom, and fought the 
Chamorros until the boat was recovered. Three days after he had been welcomed 
on his arrival, Magellan fled the archipelago. Spain regarded the islands 
as annexed and later made them part of the Spanish East Indies (1565). 
In 1734, the Spanish built a royal palace in Guam for the Governor of the 
islands. Its remains are visible even in the 21st-century; see the Plaza 
de España (Hagåtña) article. Guam operated as an important stopover between 
Manila and Mexico for galleons carrying gold between the Philippines and 
Spain. There are still some galleons sunk in Guam. In 1668 Father Diego 
Luis de San Vitores renamed the islands Las Marianas in honor of his patroness 
the Spanish regent Mariana of Austria (1634–1696), widow of Felipe IV (reigned 
1621–1655). Most of the islands' native population (90–95%)[9] died from 
Spanish diseases or married non-Chamorro settlers under Spanish rule. New 
settlers, primarily from the Philippines and the Caroline Islands, were 
brought[by whom?] to repopulate the islands. The Chamorro population gradually 
recovered, and Chamorro, Filipino and Carolinian languages and other ethnic 
differences remain in the Marianas. During the 17th-century Spanish colonists 
forcibly moved the Chamorros to Guam to encourage assimilation and conversion 
to Roman Catholicism. By the time they were allowed to return to the Northern 
Marianas, many Carolinians from present-day eastern Yap State and western 
Chuuk State had settled in the Marianas.[citation needed] Both languages, 
as well as English, are now official in the Commonwealth. The Northern 
Marianas experienced an influx of immigration from the Carolines in the 
19th-century. Both this Carolinian sub-ethnicity and Carolinians in the 
Carolines archipelago refer to themselves as the Refaluwasch. The indigenous 
Chamoru word for the same group of people is gu'palao. They are usually 
referred to simply as "Carolinians", though unlike the other two monikers, 
this can also mean those who actually live in the Carolines and who may 
have no affiliation with the Marianas. The conquering Spanish did not focus 
attempts at cultural suppression against Carolinian immigrants, whose immigration 
they allowed during a period when the indigenous Chamoru majority was being 
subjugated with land alienation, forced relocations and internment. Carolinians 
in the Marianas continue to be fluent in the language[which?], and have 
maintained many of the cultural distinctions and traditions of their ethnicity's 
land of ancestral origin.[10][need quotation to verify] Following its loss 
during the Spanish–American War of 1898, Spain ceded Guam to the United 
States and sold the remainder of the Marianas (i.e., the Northern Marianas), 
along with the Caroline Islands, to Germany under the German–Spanish Treaty 
of 1899. Germany administered the islands as part of its colony of German 
New Guinea and did little in terms of development. Early in World War I, 
Japan declared war on Germany and invaded the Northern Marianas. In 1919, 
the League of Nations awarded all of Germany's islands in the Pacific Ocean 
located north of the Equator, including the Northern Marianas, under mandate 
to Japan. Under this arrangement, the Japanese thus administered the Northern 
Marianas as part of the South Pacific Mandate. During the Japanese period, 
sugar cane became the main industry of the islands. Garapan on Saipan was 
developed as a regional capital, and numerous Japanese (including ethnic 
Koreans, Okinawan and Taiwanese) migrated to the islands. In the December 
1939 census, the total population of the South Pacific Mandate was 129,104, 
of whom 77,257 were Japanese (including ethnic Taiwanese and Koreans). 
On Saipan the pre-war population comprised 29,348 Japanese settlers and 
3,926 Chamorro and Caroline Islanders; Tinian had 15,700 Japanese settlers 
(including 2700 ethnic Koreans and 22 ethnic Chamorro). On December 8, 
1941, hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces from the 
Marianas launched an invasion of Guam. Chamorros from the Northern Marianas, 
which had been under Japanese rule for more than 20 years, were brought 
to Guam to assist the Japanese administration. This, combined with the 
harsh treatment of Guamanian Chamorros during the 31-month occupation, 
created a rift that would become the main reason Guamanians rejected the 
reunification referendum approved by the Northern Marianas in the 1960s. 
On June 15, 1944, near the end of World War II, the United States military 
invaded the Mariana Islands, starting the Battle of Saipan, which ended 
on July 9. Of the 30,000 Japanese troops defending Saipan, fewer than 1,000 
remained alive at the battle's end.[11] Over 20,000 Japanese civilians 
were also killed, or committed suicide rather than be captured[citation 
needed]. U.S. forces then recaptured Guam on July 21, and invaded Tinian 
on July 24; a year later Tinian was the takeoff point for the Enola Gay, 
the plane which dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Rota was left untouched 
(and isolated) until the Japanese surrender in August 1945, due to its 
military insignificance. The war did not end for everyone with the signing 
of the armistice. The last group of Japanese holdouts surrendered on Saipan 
on December 1, 1945. On Guam, Japanese soldier Shoichi Yokoi, unaware that 
the war had ended, hid in a jungle cave in the Talofofo area until 1972. 
Japanese nationals were eventually repatriated to the Japanese home islands. 
After Japan's defeat in World War II, the Northern Marianas were administered 
by the United States pursuant to Security Council Resolution 21 as part 
of the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which gave 
responsibility for defense and foreign affairs to the United States. Four 
referenda offering integration with Guam or changes to the islands' status 
were held in 1958, 1961, 1963 and 1969. On each occasion, a majority voted 
in favor of integration with Guam. But this did not happen: Guam rejected 
integration in a 1969 referendum. The people of the Northern Mariana Islands 
decided in the 1970s not to seek independence, but instead to forge closer 
links with the United States. Negotiations for territorial status began 
in 1972 and a covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with 
the United States[12] was approved in a 1975 referendum. A new government 
and constitution came into effect in 1978 after being approved in a 1977 
referendum. The United Nations approved this arrangement pursuant to Security 
Council Resolution 683. Like other U.S. territories, the islands do not 
have representation in the U.S. Senate, but, since 2009, are represented 
in the U.S. House of Representatives by a delegate who may vote in committee 
but not on the House floor.[13] The Northern Mariana Islands, together 
with Guam to the south, compose the Mariana Islands archipelago. The southern 
islands are limestone, with level terraces and fringing coral reefs. The 
northern islands are volcanic, with active volcanoes on several islands, 
including Anatahan, Pagan and Agrihan. The volcano on Agrihan has the highest 
elevation at 3,166 feet (965 m). Anatahan Volcano is a small volcanic island 
80 miles (130 km) north of Saipan. It is about 6 miles (10 km) long and 
2 miles (3 km) wide. Anatahan began erupting from its east crater on May 
10, 2003. It has since alternated between eruptive and calm periods. On 
April 6, 2005, about 1,800,000 cubic feet (51,000 m3) of ash and rock were 
ejected, causing a large, black cloud to drift south over Saipan and Tinian. 
The Northern Mariana Islands have a tropical marine climate moderated by 
seasonal northeast trade winds. There is little seasonal temperature variation. 
The dry season runs from December to June; the rainy season runs from July 
to November and can include typhoons. The Guinness Book of World Records 
has cited Saipan as having the most equable temperature in the world.[14] 
The Northern Mariana Islands have a multi-party presidential representative 
democratic system. The Northern Mariana Islands are a Commonwealth of the 
United States. Federal funds to the Commonwealth are administered by the 
Office of Insular Affairs of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Replicating 
the separation of powers in other U.S. territories and state governments, 
executive power is exercised by the Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands. 
Legislative power is vested in the bicameral Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth 
Legislature. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislative 
branches. Some critics, including the author of the political website Saipan 
Sucks, say that politics in the Northern Mariana Islands is often "more 
a function of family relationships and personal loyalties" where the size 
of one's extended family is more important than a candidate's personal 
qualifications. They charge that this is nepotism carried out within the 
trappings of democracy.[15][16] In April 2012, anticipating a loss of funding 
by 2014, the Commonwealth's public pension fund declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[17] 
The retirement fund is a defined benefit type pension plan and was only 
partially funded by the government, with only $268.4 million in assets 
and $911 million in liabilities. The plan experienced low investment returns 
and a benefit structure that had been increased without raises in funding.[18] 
In August 2012, cries for impeachment[19] arose, as the sitting governor 
Benigno Fitial was being held responsible for withholding payments from 
the pension fund,[20] not paying the local utility (Commonwealth Utilities 
or "CUC") for government offices,[21] cutting off funding to the only hospital 
in the Northern Marianas,[22][23] interfering with the delivery of a subpoena 
to his attorney general,[24] withholding required funds from the public 
schools,[25][26] and for signing a sole source $190 million contract for 
power generation.[27][28] The islands total 179.01 square miles (463.63 km2). 
The table gives an overview, with the individual islands from north to 
south: Administratively, the CNMI is divided into four municipalities: 
The Northern Islands (north of Saipan) form the Northern Islands Municipality. 
The three main islands of the Southern Islands form the municipalities 
of Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, with uninhabited Aguijan forming part of Tinian 
municipality. Because of volcanic threat, the northern islands have been 
evacuated. Human habitation was limited to Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan, 
but population varied due to various economic factors, including children's 
education. The 2010 census showed no residents in Northern Islands municipality 
and the Northern Islands' mayor office is located in "exile" on Saipan. 
Saipan, Tinian, and Rota have the only ports and harbors, and are the only 
permanently populated islands. In 1947, the Northern Mariana Islands became 
part of the post–World War II United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific 
Islands (TTPI). The United States became the TTPI's administering authority 
under the terms of a trusteeship agreement. In 1976, Congress approved 
the mutually negotiated Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America. The 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) government adopted 
its own constitution in 1977, and the constitutional government took office 
in January 1978. The Covenant was fully implemented November 3, 1986, pursuant 
to Presidential Proclamation no. 5564, which conferred United States citizenship 
on legally qualified CNMI residents. This led to CNMI being represented 
in the United States (and especially Washington, D.C.) by a Resident Representative 
who was elected at-large by CNMI voters and whose office was paid for by 
the CNMI government. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 ("CNRA"), 
approved by the U.S. Congress on May 8, 2008, established a CNMI delegate's 
seat; Democrat Gregorio Sablan was elected in November 2008 as the first 
CNMI delegate and took office in the 111th Congress. On December 22, 1990, 
the United Nations Trusteeship Council terminated the TTPI as it applied 
to the CNMI and five other of the TTPI's original seven districts (the 
Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, Kosrae, 
Pohnpei and Yap)), this was acknowledged in United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 683 passed on the same day. Under the Covenant, in general, 
United States federal law applies to CNMI. However, the CNMI is outside 
the customs territory of the United States and, although the internal revenue 
code does apply in the form of a local income tax, the income tax system 
is largely locally determined. According to the Covenant, the federal minimum 
wage and federal immigration laws "will not apply to the Northern Mariana 
Islands except in the manner and to the extent made applicable to them 
by the Congress by law after termination of the Trusteeship Agreement."[29] 
The local control of minimum wage was superseded by the United States Congress 
in 2007. Prior to November 28, 2009, U.S. immigration laws did not apply 
in the CNMI. Rather, a separate immigration system existed in the CNMI. 
This system was established under the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States 
of America ("Covenant"), which was signed in 1975 and codified as 48 U.S.C. 
§ 1801. The Covenant was unilaterally amended by the CNRA, thus altering 
the CNMI's immigration system. Specifically, CNRA § 702(a) amended the 
Covenant to state that "the provisions of the 'immigration laws' (as defined 
in section 101(a)(17) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(17))) shall apply to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands." 
Further, under CNRA § 702(a), the "immigration laws," as well as the amendments 
to the Covenant, "shall...supersede and replace all laws, provisions, or 
programs of the Commonwealth relating to the admission of aliens and the 
removal of aliens from the Commonwealth."[30] Transition to U.S. immigration 
laws began November 28, 2009.[31][32] The CNMI has a United States territorial 
court which exercises jurisdiction over the District of the Northern Mariana 
Islands (DNMI), which is coterminous with the CNMI. The District Court 
for the Northern Mariana Islands was established by act of Congress in 
1977 and began operations in January 1978. The court sits on the island 
of Saipan, but may sit other places within the Commonwealth. The district 
court has the same jurisdiction as all other United States district courts, 
including diversity jurisdiction and bankruptcy jurisdiction. Appeals are 
taken to the Ninth Circuit. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands 
benefits from its trading relationship with the federal government of the 
United States and cheap trained labor from Asia. Historically, the CNMI's 
economy has relied on garment manufacturing sector and tourism, mostly 
from Japan. The economy has declined since quotas were lifted in 2005, 
eventually leading all the garment factories on Saipan to close by February 
2009. Tourism also declined after 2005 when Japan Airlines stopped serving 
the Marianas.[33] The Northern Mariana Islands had successfully used its 
position as a free trade area with the U.S., while at the same time not 
being subject to the same labor laws. For example, the $3.05 per hour minimum 
wage in the Commonwealth, which lasted from 1997 to 2007, was lower than 
in the U.S. and some other worker protections are weaker, leading to lower 
production costs. That allowed garments to be labeled "Made in USA" without 
having to comply with all U.S. labor laws. However, the U.S. minimum wage 
law signed by President Bush on May 25, 2007, resulted in stepped increases 
in the Northern Marianas' minimum wage, which will allow it to reach the 
U.S. level by 2015.[34] The first step (to $3.55) became effective July 
25, 2007, and a yearly increase of $0.50 will take effect every May thereafter 
until the CNMI minimum wage equals the nationwide minimum wage. However, 
a law signed by President Obama in December 2009 delayed the yearly increase 
from May to September. As of September 30, 2014, the minimum wage is $6.05 
per hour.[35] The island's exemption from U.S. labor laws had led to many 
alleged exploitations including recent claims of sweatshops, child labor, 
child prostitution, and even forced abortions.[36][37] An immigration system 
mostly outside of federal U.S. control (which ended on November 28, 2009) 
resulted in a large number of Chinese migrant workers (about 15,000 during 
the peak years) employed in the islands' garment trade. However, the lifting 
of World Trade Organization restrictions on Chinese imports to the U.S. 
in 2005 had put the Commonwealth-based trade under severe pressure, leading 
to a number of recent factory closures. Adding to the U.S.-imposed scheduled 
wage increases, the garment industry became extinct by 2009.[38] Agricultural 
production, primarily of tapioca, cattle, coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, 
and melons exists but is relatively unimportant in the economy.[citation 
needed] Non-native islanders are not allowed to own land, but can lease 
it.[39] The islands have over 220 miles (350 km) of highways, three airports 
with paved runways (one about 9,800 feet [3,000 m] long; two around 6,600 
feet [2,000 m]), three airports with unpaved runways, and one heliport. 
The main commercial airport is Saipan International Airport. Mail service 
for the islands is provided by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Each major 
island has its own zip code in the 96950–96952 range, and the USPS two-letter 
abbreviation for the CNMI is "MP".[40][41] For phone service, the islands 
are included in the North American Numbering Plan, using area code 670.[40] 
Television service is provided by KPPI-LP, Channel 7, which simulcasts 
Guam's ABC affiliate KTGM, as well as WSZE, Channel 10, which simulcasts 
Guam's NBC affiliate KUAM-TV. About 10 radio stations broadcast within 
the CNMI. According to the 2010 census, the population of the CNMI as of 
April 1, 2010, was 53,883, down from 69,221 in 2000, a decrease of 22.2%.[42] 
The decrease was reportedly due to a combination of factors including the 
demise of the garment industry (the vast majority of whose employees were 
females from China), economic crises, and a decline in tourism, one of 
the CNMI's primary sources of revenue.[32] The Northern Mariana Islands 
are the least populous area in the United States (with fewer people than 
any of the other 55 states and territories). The Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands Public School System operates public schools in the commonwealth 
and there are numerous private schools. Northern Marianas College is accredited 
by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and offers a range of 
programs similar to other small U.S. community colleges. Much of the Chamorro 
culture in the Mariana Islands was heavily influenced by the Spanish during 
the Spanish era, as well as by the Germans and Japanese. In Chamorro culture, 
respect is the biggest thing taught, and one common display is the tradition 
of "manngingi'". This tradition has been around for centuries and involves 
an elder and a young Chamorro child. The child takes the hand of the elder, 
places it on their nose and says ñot to the men and ñora to the women with 
the elders responding diosti ayudi, meaning "God help you". The Carolinian 
culture is very similar to the Chamorro culture with respect being very 
important. The Carolinian culture can be traced back to Yap and Chuuk, 
where the Carolinians originated. Much of Chamorro cuisine is influenced 
by various cultures. Examples of popular foods of foreign origin include 
various types of sweet or savory empanada, originally introduced from Spain, 
and pancit, a noodle dish from the Philippines. Archeological evidence 
reveals that rice has been cultivated in the Marianas since prehistoric 
times. Red rice made with achoti is a distinct staple food that strongly 
distinguishes Chamorro cuisine from that of other Pacific islands. It is 
commonly served for special events, such as parties (gupot or "fiestas"), 
novenas, and high school or college graduations. Fruits such as lemmai, 
mangga, niyok, and bilimbines are included in various local recipes. Korean, 
Chinese, Japanese, and American cuisine are also commonly available. Local 
specialities include kelaguen, a dish in which meat is cooked in whole 
or in part by the action of citric acid rather than heat; Tinaktak, a meat 
dish made with coconut milk; and kå'du fanihi (flying fox/fruit bat soup). 
Fruit bats and local birds have become scarce in modern times, primarily 
due to the World War II-era introduction of the brown tree snake, which 
decimated the populations of local birds and threatens the fanihi population 
as well; hunting them is now illegal. The Marianas and the Hawaiian islands 
are the world's foremost consumers, per capita, of Spam, with Guam at the 
top of the list, and Hawaii second (details regarding the rest of the Marianas 
are often absent from statistics). Spam was introduced to the islands by 
the American military as war rations during the World War II era. Due to 
the Spanish missionaries in the Marianas, a large majority of Chamorros 
and Carolinians practice Roman Catholicism, including the use of rosaries 
and novenas. The Japanese occupation had the effect of creating a sizable 
Buddhist community which remained even after their departure. Team sports 
popular in the United States were introduced to the Northern Mariana Islands 
by American soldiers during World War II. Baseball is the islands' most 
popular sport. CNMI teams have made appearances in the Little League World 
Series (in the Little, Junior, Senior and Big league divisions) as well 
as winning gold medals in the Micronesian Games and South Pacific Games. 
Basketball and mixed martial arts are also popular in the islands. Trench 
Wars is the CNMI's Mixed Martial Arts brand.[citation needed] Fighters 
from the CNMI have competed in the Pacific Xtreme Combat. Other sports 
in the CNMI include volleyball, tennis, soccer, outrigger sailing, softball, 
beach volleyball, rugby, golf, boxing, kickboxing, tae kwon do, track and 
field, Swimming, Triathlon, and American football. Coordinates: 17°N 146°E﻿
