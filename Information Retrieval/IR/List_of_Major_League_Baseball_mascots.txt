This is a list of current and former Major League Baseball mascots, sorted 
alphabetically. The tradition in the Major League Baseball mascot began 
with Mr. Met, introduced for the New York Mets when Shea Stadium opened 
in 1964. Although some mascots came and went over time, the popularity 
of mascots increased when The San Diego Chicken started independently making 
appearances at San Diego Padres games in 1977. Philadelphia Phillies management 
felt they needed a mascot similar to the Chicken, so they debuted the Phillie 
Phanatic in 1978. Today, all but three major-league teams have "official" 
mascots (Dodgers, Yankees, and Angels). Three team mascots — the Phillie 
Phanatic, Mr. Met, and Slider (Cleveland Indians) — have been inducted 
into the Mascot Hall of Fame. Several others have been nominated since 
the Hall's creation in 2005. Ace is the official mascot of the Toronto 
Blue Jays. He, along with his female counterpart, "Diamond" replaced former 
mascot BJ Birdie before the 2002 season as a mascot duo. Like his predecessor, 
Ace resembles a large blue jay. The mascot's name is baseball slang for 
a team's top starting pitcher (the "ace" of the staff, such as former Blue 
Jays pitcher Roy Halladay). In 2004, Ace became the sole mascot of the 
team after Diamond was removed by the Blue Jays prior to the start of the 
season. In 2011, Blue Jays fans were introduced to his younger brother 
Junior (see below). Barrelman (aka "Owgust" and "Beer Barrel Man"), is 
an auxiliary mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers. He was resurrected an upgraded 
to be a costumed performing character in 2015, having previously only been 
an official logo image and since 1977 only appearing on special materials. 
Baxter the Bobcat is the mascot of the Arizona Diamondbacks.[1] His full 
name is D. Baxter the Bobcat, and he became the mascot in 2000. The mascot 
was created by Brantley Bell (who is currently an infielder for the Ole 
Miss Rebels baseball team), the son of Jay Bell, one of the players on 
the Diamondbacks 1998 inaugural season roster. Brantley came up with the 
name from two sources. "D. Baxter" comes from the team's nickname, "the 
D-Backs". The bobcat is from the original name of the stadium where the 
Diamondbacks play. Today called Chase Field, it was once called Bank One 
Ballpark, or "BOB" for short. The bobcat is a wild cat native to Arizona. 
Bernie Brewer is the official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers. The Bernie 
Brewer character became the team's mascot in 1973, appearing as a cheerful 
man with a big mustache. A beer-barreled chalet was built for him inside 
the stadium where he led the crowd cheering. Following each home run and 
every victory by the Brewers, he would slide down and plunge himself into 
a huge beer mug in celebration. He was joined by a companion Bonnie Brewer, 
who would playfully swat at the backside of the opposing team's third base 
coach with a broom as the field crew swept the base paths. Bernie Brewer 
was a fixture at Brewers home games until 1984, when the Brewers re-built 
the bleachers, replacing the chalet with a sound tower and sending Bernie 
into retirement. By popular demand, Bernie Brewer came out of his retirement 
in 1993, when the fans voted for his return. Bernie was brought back not 
as just a mustachioed man in lederhosen, but a full-body costume of a man, 
including large foam head. The chalet was then rebuilt (it had been in 
storage on the third base side under the box seats) above the left-center 
field bleachers. The original beer mug that Bernie used to slide into is 
still in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as part of the Lakefront Brewery, Inc. tour. 
Billy The Marlin is the official mascot of the Miami Marlins. Resembling 
a marlin with limbs, he can be seen at every Marlins home game. He competes 
in a waterboat race, which is a computer-animated video shown on the screen, 
during each game. The name, picked by original team owner Wayne Huizenga, 
is derived from the fact that a marlin is a billfish, and Huizenga wanted 
a name that was different from the baseball type names of other mascots 
(like Slider and Sluggerrr) and one that children could remember more easily. 
On Mothers Day and Father's Day, Billy is joined by his parents, Bill Sr. 
and Betty the Marlin. Billy is also seen at games dancing with kids on 
the field in between innings and making special appearances in the Fan 
Zone. On Opening Day of 1997, the year the Marlins won their first World 
Series Championship, a Navy SEAL who was parachuting into Sun Life Stadium 
(then known as Pro Player Stadium) as Billy, lost the head in mid-air. 
While the crowd was unaware of the problem, media outlets had been alerted 
to Billy's parachute entrance. When he didn't arrive, the media ran with 
the story, getting national attention and leading to ESPN's Dan Patrick's 
nightly quote, "Bring me the head of Billy the Marlin!" The original Billy 
The Marlin was John Routh, who spent 10 years (1993–2002) entertaining 
Marlins fans.[2] Routh previously portrayed the University of Miami mascots, 
Sebastian the Ibis and The Miami Maniac from 1983–1993, and prior to that, 
Cocky for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks On January 13, 2014, 
the Chicago Cubs announced that Clark, a "young, friendly Cub", would become 
the team's first official mascot in modern history. Clark was named after 
Clark Street, since the Cubs home field, Wrigley Field, is famously located 
at "Clark and Addison".[3] The D-backs Luchador is the second mascot of 
the Arizona Diamondbacks. After a giveaway of masks in June 2012 proved 
popular, the team introduced the Luchador as a permanent character in July 
2013. He wears a black cape, red pants, and a mask patterned after the 
team's logo. Meant to represent the team's Hispanic fans, the Luchador 
also wrestles with Club Deportivo Coloseo at the Glendale Park and Swap.[4] 
Dinger is the official mascot of the Colorado Rockies. He is an anthropomorphic 
purple triceratops. The choice of a dinosaur, specifically this type, was 
inspired by the discovery of a number of dinosaur fossils—most notably 
a 7-foot-long (2.1 m), 1,000-pound (450 kg) triceratops skull—at Coors 
Field during its construction. His name "Dinger" is one of many slang terms 
for a home run. Dinger is often seen on the field before and after the 
game and roaming around the stadium during the game. When Rockies hitters 
are at bat in the late innings of a game, he often dances in the seats 
immediately behind home plate in an effort to distract opposing pitchers, 
sitting down only immediately before the beginning motion of each pitch.[5][6][7] 
Dinger has been the Colorado Rockies biggest fan since he first hatched 
from his egg at Mile High Stadium on April 16, 1994 [1]. Dinger works year-round 
promoting physical fitness and literacy for thousands of elementary school 
students in the Rocky Mountain Region. He acts out his own Dinger Story 
for the kids. He also makes appearances at Children's Hospital Colorado 
and Denver Health. He makes appearances at Rockies events including the 
5K Home Run, and the Rockies Rookies Kids Fan Club.[2] He is a purple dinosaur 
with a Rockies jersey on with black sneakers. DJ Kitty is the new mascot 
for the Tampa Bay Rays. DJ Kitty comes from the Internet sensation of a 
kitty playing a DJ System and dancing to the music. The cat wears a Tampa 
Bay Rays ring, wears chains, and wears his Rays hat backwards. As of 2013, 
DJ Kitty is the new secondary mascot for the Rays along with Raymond. Fredbird 
is the official mascot for the St. Louis Cardinals.[8] He is an anthropomorphic 
cardinal wearing the team's uniform. A person dressed up as Fredbird can 
often be found entertaining young children during baseball games at Busch 
Stadium. His name is derived from "Redbird", a synonym for the cardinal 
bird and for the Cardinals themselves. Fredbird was introduced in 1979 
by the Cardinals, then owned by Anheuser-Busch, to entertain younger fans 
at the games. He quickly became popular with fans for his dancing, habit 
of "beaking" the heads of supporters, and for throwing T-shirts into the 
stands. In later years, he has been joined by "Team Fredbird", a group 
of young women employed by the club who help him with his T-shirt toss 
and occasionally in other duties. He is one of baseball's best-known mascots, 
and he makes hundreds of appearances year-round in the St. Louis area. 
Gapper is one of the current mascots for the Cincinnati Reds.[9] He was 
first introduced as the furry companion to Mr. Red, the long-time mascot 
in the winter of 2002 as the franchise was preparing to move to their new 
home, Great American Ball Park. The mascot was created by David Raymond's 
Raymond Entertainment Group, the founder being the man inside the Phillie 
Phanatic costume from 1973 to 1993. A young fan won two season tickets 
for submitting the winning name; he is named after the "gap" in the stands 
in the seats of Great American, which provides a view into and out of the 
stadium. The term "gapper" is also a slang phrase for a batted ball which 
falls into the "gap" between outfielders (generally a ball hit to either 
left-center or right-center field which rolls to the fence). According 
to a recent cincinnati.com poll of the Red's four mascots, he is the least 
popular amongst fans. He received 6% of the voting, Mr. Red received 23%, 
Rosie Red received 34%, and Mr. Redlegs received 47%. Homer is the mascot 
of the Atlanta Braves. He has a baseball shaped head, and looks a little 
like Mr. Met. Before having the baseball head however, Homer was the personification 
of the old "Screaming Warrior" logo the Braves used before dropping it 
in 1988. Homer's full name is Homer the Brave. This is meant to sound like 
"home of the brave", the last words of the national anthem. Incidentally, 
"homer" is also the longtime nickname for a home run. Junior is the younger 
brother of Ace. He made his mascot debut in 2011. He is half the size of 
Ace so he wears the number 1/2. He only appears on Jr.Jays Saturdays. In 
the game he and Ace stand in two different aisles and they run in slow 
motion and hug. Lefty and Righty are each a large, red sock with arms, 
and are the alternate mascot characters for the Boston Red Sox joining 
Wally the Green Monster. They are seen on large outings with Wally such 
as the 2007 World Series Parade as well as weekend afternoon games at Fenway 
Park. Lou Seal is the official mascot of the San Francisco Giants. "Born" 
on July 25, 1996, Luigi Francisco Seal[10] has been a regular part of all 
Giants home games, as well as numerous events in San Francisco and around 
the United States, ever since. Although his name (a play on the name "Lucille") 
is a bit ambiguous, he is indeed "officially" male and the person inside 
the costume is a man.[11] Species-wise, Lou Seal is a reference to the 
San Francisco Seals, the baseball club that was a mainstay of the Pacific 
Coast League from 1903 until 1957. In a contest held by the Giants where 
fans were asked for ideas, six people submitted the name "Lou Seal." These 
lucky fans were then invited to a game that season where they sat in a 
luxury box and got to meet the newly named mascot, and one of them was 
randomly chosen to throw out the first pitch. In 2008 Forbes Magazine named 
Lou Seal the best mascot in sports.[citation needed] He has had 1,150 consecutive 
home-game appearances,[12] and is one of the four subjects followed in 
the second season of the Hulu series Behind the Mask.[13] The Mariner Moose 
is the mascot of the Seattle Mariners. In 1990, a contest for children 
14 and under was held to select a mascot, after 2500 entries the club chose 
the "Mariner Moose" The Moose made his debut on April 13, 1990 dancing 
on the field at the Kingdome. During the 1995 American League Division 
Series between the M's and the New York Yankees, the Moose gained national 
attention when he broke his ankle crashing into the outfield wall at the 
Kingdome while being towed on inline skates behind an ATV in the outfield. 
Inline skating behind an ATV would continue to be a fan favorite until 
1999, when the team moved to Safeco Field and a natural grass playing surface. 
Since then, the Moose has become quite adept at driving his own ATV around 
Safeco Field's warning track while performing various tricks and having 
water coolers emptied on him by bullpen pitchers. The Moose makes several 
hundred appearances in the community each year in addition to Mariners 
home games, at everything from hospitals to wedding receptions. The Mariner 
Moose was featured on the ballot for the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006 and 
2007. He also nearly ran over Coco Crisp with his ATV in 2007, raising 
the ire of Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell. Mr. Met is the official 
mascot of the New York Mets, and MLB's first live action mascot (April 
14, 1964). He is a baseball-headed humanoid being who wears a Mets cap 
and uniform. He can be seen at Citi Field (and previously at Shea Stadium) 
during Mets home games. He also has appeared in several commercials as 
part of ESPN's This is SportsCenter campaign, and was selected in 2007 
into the Mascot Hall of Fame. Starting in 2014, Mr. Met appeared as a sleeve 
patch on the Mets' blue alternate home and road jerseys. Mrs. Jan Met (or 
Lady Met) is the female version of Mr. Met, the mascot of the New York 
Mets. She is a baseball-headed humanoid being, has brown hair in a ponytail 
and wears a Mets cap and uniform. Mrs. Met first appeared at games in 1975 
before disappearing into obscurity. She appeared with Mr. Met in a 2003 
"This is SportsCenter" commercial. The Mets reintroduced Mrs. Met in mascot 
form in 2013.[14] Mr. Red (or The Running Man) was the first mascot of 
the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He is a humanoid figure dressed in a 
Reds uniform, with an oversized baseball for a head. Mr. Red made his first 
appearance on a Reds uniform as a sleeve patch in 1955. The patch featured 
Mr. Red's head, clad in an old-fashioned white pillbox baseball cap with 
red stripes. The following season, 1956, saw the Reds adopt sleeveless 
jerseys, and Mr. Red was eliminated from the home uniform. He was moved 
to the left breast of the road uniform, and remained there for one season 
before being eliminated entirely. In 1999, the Reds re-designed their uniform 
and "Mr. Red" was reintroduced as a sleeve patch on the undershirt. A human 
version of the mascot didn't appear until the early 1980s. The costumed 
mascot disappeared in the late 1980s but was reintroduced in 1997. The 
humanoid Mr. Red retired in 2007 leaving Gapper, Rosie Red and Mr. Redlegs 
to take his place. A new version of Mr. Red was unveiled at Redsfest 2012; 
the new mascot will be on the field with Mr. Redlegs, Gapper and Rosie 
Red. Mr. Redlegs is a mascot of the Cincinnati Reds. He was reintroduced 
in 2007 to play a supporting role, along with Mr. Red. Mr. Redlegs appeared 
as a patch on the Reds' uniforms for two seasons in the 1950s (the team 
briefly assumed the nickname as a response to the second red scare). In 
2008, Mr. Redlegs gained national notoriety by falling off of an ATV during 
pre-game antics. This caused the large, baseball-shaped head to fall off 
of the Mr. Redlegs costume, exposing the head of the person inside the 
costume. He was seen a few days later wearing a neck brace as a joke. Orbit 
is the mascot of the Houston Astros. Orbit represents a green space alien 
with antennae, in keeping with the Space City theme of the city of Houston. 
Originally serving as team mascot from 1990 until 1999, he was replaced 
by a new mascot, Junction Jack. To coincide with the Astros' move to the 
American League West and unveiling of their new uniforms, caps, and logo, 
Orbit was reintroduced on November 2, 2012 to serve as the Astros' mascot 
once more for 2013 and beyond. The Oriole Bird is the official mascot of 
the Baltimore Orioles and is a cartoon version of the bird of the same 
name. He was "hatched" out of a giant egg prior to the team's 1979 season 
opener at Memorial Stadium on April 6. According to Orioles.com, The Oriole 
Bird's favorite foods are "mostly bird seed, with occasional crab cake." 
The Oriole Bird's head was featured on the team's caps from 1966 until 
1988, and again since 2012. Paws is the mascot of the Detroit Tigers. He 
is a tiger who made his debut on May 5, 1995, in Tiger Stadium. He wears 
a Tigers hat and jersey; in previous years, Paws' jersey would have the 
current season's 2 digit abbreviation (i.e. '10 for 2010). However, in 
2011 and 2016, Paws' number changed to 00, since the Tigers retired #11 
and #16 in honor of Sparky Anderson and Hal Newhouser, respectively. His 
dress changes during Comerica Park theme nights such as a Santa Claus outfit 
during "Christmas in July" night, or an Elvis Presley-inspired costume 
for Elvis Night. He "resides" in Comerica Park to this day. Phillie Phanatic 
is the official mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies. He is a large, furry, 
green bi-pedal creature with a cylindrical beak containing a tongue that 
sticks out. He was created by Harrison/Erickson, who thought that the team 
needed a mascot similar to The San Diego Chicken. The character is named 
for the fanatical fans of the team and, according to current owner and 
former team vice president, Bill Giles, was to bring more families to Veterans 
Stadium, the Phillies' ballpark at the time, which had become noted for 
rowdiness and even violence at times. He can be seen riding around on an 
ATV at home games. In 2008, Forbes named the Phanatic the 2nd best mascot 
in sports, behind San Francisco's Lou Seal. The Pierogis are a series of 
six people dressed in pierogi costumes that race in a promotion between 
innings during Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games. The contestants in this 
race include: Jalapeño Hannah (green hat), Cheese Chester (yellow), Sauerkraut 
Saul (red), Oliver Onion (purple), Bacon Burt (orange) and Potato Pete 
(blue). It was inspired by the Milwaukee Brewers' Sausage Race. The Pirate 
Parrot is the mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates, debuting in 1979. He is 
a large green parrot who wears a Pirates jersey and cap. The character 
of a parrot was derived from the classic story Treasure Island by Robert 
Louis Stevenson, most notably the one owned by Long John Silver named "Captain 
Flint". He is often seen dancing on the dugouts and shooting hot-dogs from 
a cannon. The Washington Nationals have presidential races during their 
games. Currently, the six presidents are: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, 
Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt (the presidents on Mount Rushmore), William 
Howard Taft, and Herbert Hoover. Each has a uniform number corresponding 
to their place in the order in which they held the office (George – 1; 
Tom – 3; Abe – 16; Teddy – 26; William – 27; Herbie – 31). They have become 
an instant success and make multiple public appearances, notably Abe Lincoln 
on The Illinois float for President Obama's inauguration parade. A running 
gag with the Presidents was that Teddy Roosevelt could never win a race 
– he came close in 2012, after apparently defeating the other 3 presidents: 
while Teddy was "Tebowing" near the finish line, George Washington drove 
up in a car and whacked him in the back of the head with a baseball bat. 
In 2012, shortly before the Nationals' postseason run, Teddy won his first 
race and then won 4 straight. In 2013, the fifth permanent contestant – 
Taft – was added. A sixth contestant was added in 2015 as part of a three-year 
marketing deal with the White House Historical Association, with that slot 
rotating annually based on the President featured by the association on 
its annual Christmas ornament. Coolidge was the first to fill the sixth 
slot, making his debut in midseason. Hoover replaced him for 2016, and 
in turn will be replaced in 2017 by the President to be featured on that 
year's ornament. Rally Squirrel is a secondary mascot for the St. Louis 
Cardinals. He is an anthropomorphic squirrel wearing the team's uniform 
with a number 11 (presumably for the 2011 postseason), and was introduced 
not long after an actual squirrel appeared on the field at Busch Stadium 
during the fifth inning of Game 4 of the 2011 National League Division 
Series. The squirrel ran across home plate as Philadelphia Phillies pitcher 
Roy Oswalt was delivering a pitch to Skip Schumaker, causing Oswalt to 
complain to the umpire that he was distracted by the squirrel. The video 
of the incident became very popular, and several local businesses in the 
St. Louis area began creating items to capitalize on the phenomenon. A 
performer dressed up as Rally Squirrel took part in Cardinals fan rallies 
beginning with Game 3 of the 2011 National League Championship Series,[15] 
and was a companion of the existing Cardinals mascot Fredbird during the 
remainder of the postseason, assisting Fredbird and Team Fredbird with 
their duties entertaining the Cardinals fans at Busch Stadium. Since the 
Cardinals won the 2011 World Series, it is unknown if Rally Squirrel would 
become an official secondary mascot alongside Fredbird. Rangers Captain 
is the mascot for the Texas Rangers. Introduced in 2002, he is a palomino-style 
horse, dressed in the team's uniform. He wears the uniform number "72" 
in honor of 1972, the year the Rangers relocated to the Dallas/Fort Worth 
Metroplex. The mascot also has multiple uniforms to match each of the variants 
the team has. Rangers Captain's chosen uniform for the game matches the 
uniform choice made by the team for that particular game. Captain's outfits 
sometimes match a theme the team is promoting; on Apr 24, 2010, he was 
dressed up like Elvis as part of an Elvis Presley themed night. Raymond 
is the mascot of the Tampa Bay Rays.[16] Raymond is a furry blue creature 
wearing a large pair of sneakers and a backwards baseball cap, completed 
with a Rays jersey. He is described officially as a "seadog", having been 
born somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. He is said to reside in a private 
condominium inside Tropicana Field. Raymond was awarded an honorable mention 
in the GameOps.com Best Mascot contest for 2006. Rosie Red is the female 
mascot of the Cincinnati Reds. She was introduced in August 2008 as the 
new companion of Gapper and Mr. Redlegs, and her name comes from a female 
fan, Rosie Janis, who became famous in 1940 for cheering for the team, 
and is also derived from a female fan group founded to prevent the team 
from moving from Cincinnati in 1963 and is a philanthropic group associated 
with the team. The official group name comes from the acronym of "Rooters 
Organized to Stimulate Interest and Enthuiasm in the Cincinnati Reds." 
The sausages are unofficial mascots of the Milwaukee Brewers. They are 
stylized in the appearance of sausages from around the world. When they 
were debuted in the mid-1990s there were only three: The German Bratwurst, 
The Polish Kielbasa, and The Italian Sausage. In the late 1990s the Hot 
Dog became a racer. In 2006 a fifth sausage was debuted, The Spanish Chorizo. 
They are a favorite of fans and make sports highlights reels occasionally. 
Screech is the mascot of the Washington Nationals. He is a bald eagle who 
wears the home cap and jersey of the team. He was "hatched" on April 17, 
2005 at the "Kids Opening Day" promotion at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial 
Stadium. A nine-year-old fourth grade student in Washington, Glenda Gutierrez, 
designed the mascot and won a contest sponsored by the team, explaining 
that it was "strong and eats almost everything." A new "matured" edition 
of the mascot was unveiled March 2, 2009. The Springfield Falcons, which 
played in the American Hockey League until they moved to Tucson in 2016, 
also had a mascot named Screech. Slider is the mascot for the Cleveland 
Indians. He is a large, furry fuchsia-colored creature. He has a large 
yellow nose and shaggy yellow eyebrows.[17] He was created in 1990, inspired 
by the Phillie Phanatic.[18] He was best known for an injury during the 
1995 American League Championship Series when he fell six feet off an outfield 
wall and tore knee ligaments.[citation needed] He was inducted into the 
Mascot Hall of Fame in 2008. Sluggerrr is the official mascot of the Kansas 
City Royals. The lion whose mane looks like a crown made his debut on April 
5, 1996. The word slugger also refers to a powerful batter with a high 
percentage of extra base hits. Sluggerrr is one of few mascots that has 
Facebook and Twitter accounts, both clearly marked on his homepage. In 
2010, Sluggerrr was sued by a man named John Coomer for allegedly firing 
a hotdog at his eye, while the mascot was shooting hotdogs into the stands. 
The Royals later fired the current man behind Sluggerrr and replaced him.[19] 
Southpaw is the mascot of the Chicago White Sox. His name is a reference 
to a left-hand pitcher and is also a reference to Chicago's South Side, 
where the team plays. He was on a float for Illinois at Barack Obama's 
inauguration, along with the Washington Nationals racing president representation 
of Abraham Lincoln. Stomper is the mascot of the Oakland Athletics. Created 
in 1997, he is an elephant who wears an A's uniform adorned with the number 
00. Stomper has performed at several All-Star Games and has appeared in 
a Public Service Announcement discouraging the use of chewing tobacco. 
The use of an elephant to symbolize the A's dates back to the early years 
of the franchise, when a group of Philadelphia businessmen, headed by industrialist 
Benjamin Shibe, became the team's first owners. When asked to comment, 
John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants of the rival National League, 
said something to the effect that "Shibe had bought himself a white elephant." 
In response, A's manager (and future owner) Connie Mack selected the elephant 
as the team symbol and mascot. From time to time an illustration of an 
elephant has been featured on the Athletics uniform, including from 1988 
to the present. The Swinging Friar is the mascot of the San Diego Padres. 
The Swinging Friar has been a mascot with the team as early as 1958, when 
the Padres were still a member of the Pacific Coast League, a minor league 
baseball organization. He was named after the Spanish Franciscan friars, 
who founded the Mission San Diego de Alcalá, around which the city of San 
Diego began to emerge in the 18th century. The Padres joined Major League 
Baseball in 1969 and kept the popular mascot. He was even on the team emblem 
until 1984. Wanting a more "professional" image, the owners introduced 
a more corporate logo. In 1996, he was brought back as a sleeve patch for 
the club's blue alternate jerseys, and though the team has changed its 
logo and colors since then, the Friar remains there to this day. The Swinging 
Friar is a cartoon-like character, pudgy, balding, and always smiling. 
He is dressed as a friar with a tonsure, sandals, a dark hooded cloak, 
and a rope around the waist. He swings a baseball bat; but reportedly, 
in some years he swings left-handed, in other years he swings right-handed, 
he may be ambidextrous, or even a switch hitter. On home game Sundays, 
the Friar wears a special camouflage cloak as the team honors the military 
background of San Diego with similar uniforms. Originally, The Swinging 
Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit. 
Since his return, the character has been a full mascot costume. Some in 
the past have confused The San Diego Chicken as the mascot of the Padres. 
Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego sporting events, 
he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team. T. 
C. is the mascot for the Minnesota Twins. He was first introduced to Minnesota 
on April 3, 2000. T. C. is loosely modeled[citation needed] after the Hamm's 
Beer Bear, a mascot used in advertisements for Hamm's Brewery, an early 
sponsor for the Twins. The "T. C." stands for the "Twin Cities", Minneapolis 
and St. Paul.[20] Prior to T.C., the mascot for the Minnesota Twins 1980-81 
was a loon named "Twinkie". Wally the Green Monster is the official mascot 
for the Boston Red Sox. His name is derived from the Green Monster nickname 
of the 37-foot (11 m) wall in left field at Fenway Park. Wally debuted 
in 1997 to the chagrin of many older Red Sox fans, despite his popularity 
with children. According to the Red Sox promotions department, Wally was 
a huge Red Sox fan who, in 1947, decided to move inside the left field 
wall of Fenway Park, since it "eats up" hits that would easily be home 
runs at other parks. Apparently, he was very shy and lived the life of 
a hermit for 50 years. In 1997, on the 50th anniversary of the Green Monster 
being painted green, he came out of the manual scoreboard and has been 
interacting with players and fans ever since.[21] When the team began to 
grow out their beards as a trademark during their 2013 World Series run, 
Wally was given a long beard as well. In January 2016, the Red Sox unveiled 
a new mascot named Tessie, Wally the Green Monster's little sister.[22] 
Tessie is named after the song "Tessie", which has long been associated 
with the Red Sox.[23] This is a list of former Major League Baseball mascots. 
Some of these mascots may still be used, but are not considered "official" 
mascots. Astrojack, an anthropomorphic rabbit, and Astrodillo, an anthropomorphic 
armadillo, were mascots for the Houston Astros in the 1980s. They wore 
the Astros' "rainbow" uniforms of that time, and were also the team's first 
mascots to circulate through the crowd. Before games and during breaks 
between innings, they would also race around the field on three-wheelers 
and perform skits with the Astrodome's house band, The Astronuts. The creator 
of Astrojack and Astrodillo, Logan Goodson, would go on to create a later 
Astros mascot, Junction Jack. BJ Birdy served as the official mascot for 
the Toronto Blue Jays from 1979 to 1999.[24] He was ejected from a game 
in 1993 for "showing up" the umpire, after making gestures the umpire found 
offensive.[25][26] He was replaced in 1999 with Ace and Diamond. BJ was 
created and played by the same person, Kevin Shanahan, for his entire 20-year 
career as the Jays' mascot. Shanahan lost 3 toes on his left foot in an 
automobile accident during the 1991 off season, but managed to return as 
the Jays mascot, missing only the first home game of the season. Bonnie 
Brewer is a former official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers, appearing 
at Milwaukee County Stadium from 1973 to 1979. Bonnie was portrayed as 
a young blonde woman in a gold blouse and short blue lederhosen, wearing 
a baseball cap and frequently carrying a blue-and-gold broom which she 
would use to sweep the bases. Bonnie was first introduced as the female 
companion to the Brewers' mascot Bernie Brewer. Bernie and Bonnie were 
created by then-team vice president Dick Hackett as part of an effort to 
create a lively atmosphere at County Stadium, which also included hiring 
organist Frank Charles to play a Wurlitzer during the games. As Hackett 
remembers it, Bernie and Bonnie were added over the objections of team 
owner Bud Selig. Bonnie was noted mainly for her colorful antics during 
the seventh-inning stretch. As the grounds crew swept the infield, Bonnie 
wielded her signature broom, sweeping off each base in turn. After sweeping 
third base, she would playfully swat the opposing team's third-base coach 
on the backside with her broom, following it up with a kiss on his cheek. 
Bonnie was discontinued after the 1979 season, although no clear reason 
has ever been given for her "firing". Bernie Brewer was discontinued as 
a mascot in 1984, although he was brought back as a costumed mascot in 
1993, complete with full-body costume and large foam head. Bonnie Brewer 
returned as part of the nostalgia-heavy final home stand at County Stadium, 
September 18–28, 2000. As of 2008[update], Bonnie is part of the Brewers' 
"Retro Fridays" promotions at Miller Park, incorporating the traditional 
base sweeping as well as dancing with Bernie on Bernie's Dugout during 
the fans' singing of the "Beer Barrel Polka" in the seventh inning stretch. 
The Braves Bleacher Creature was a mascot for the Atlanta Braves major 
league baseball team during the late 1970s. It featured a green shaggy 
skin with a Braves cap and logo on top. The word Braves was written across 
its chest in big red letters. It had a permanent toothless smile. The mascot 
usually roamed the stands from time to time during home games and was intended 
more for the entertainment of younger fans. The mascot was costumed by 
Alan Stensland, then a student at Georgia Tech. Stensland was working as 
an usher at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium when he was approached to wear 
the costume. The outfit required someone who was 5"8" to 5'10" tall, and 
Alen met the height and shoe size requirements. Alen recalls having one 
of his costume's eyes removed by a youngster on his first night out. They 
also attempted to bust his kneecaps on bat night. During the 1977 season, 
the mascot made some 250 appearances at games, parties, and parades. Stensland 
was only 18 at the time he first donned the costume. The most intense problem 
he had was the heat. With the added humidity, a really "funky smell" permeated 
the inside of the costume. Once Stensland graduated, he left the Braves 
organization, and the mascot was discontinued. The other Braves mascot, 
Chief Noc-A-Homa, continued on for several more years. Charlie-O the Mule 
was the mascot used by the Kansas City Athletics and Oakland A's from 1963 
to 1976. The mule was named after their colorful owner at that time, Charles 
O. Finley. When the A's moved to then heavily Democratic Missouri, where 
the official state animal is the mule, Warren Hearnes gave a mule to Finley 
for his barnyard menagerie at Municipal Stadium which also include sheep 
and goats that scampered up the hill behind right field.[27] The Municipal 
Stadium menagerie also included Warpaint, the horse mascot of the Kansas 
City Chiefs. As questions swirled about whether Finley would be loyal to 
Missouri, he embraced the mule and removed the elephant from the A's logo 
and changed the A's colors from blue, red and white to green, gold, and 
white. Finley took the sorrel 5-foot-tall (1.5 m) mule around the country, 
walking him into cocktail parties and hotel lobbies, and on one occasion 
even into the press room after a large feeding to annoy reporters. In April 
1977 the Houston Astros introduced their very first mascot, Chester Charge. 
Chester Charge was a 45-pound costume of a cartoon Texas cavalry soldier 
on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home 
game, during the seventh inning stretch and then ran around the bases at 
the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would 
light up and the audience would yell, "Charge!" The first Chester Charge 
was played by Steve Ross who was then an 18-year-old Senior High School 
student. The creation of Chester Charge and the (incredible for its day) 
scoreboard graphics were created by Ed Henderson. Chief Noc-A-Homa was 
the original mascot of the Atlanta Braves from 1950s until 1986. The name 
was used for the "laughing Indian" sleeve patch worn on Braves jerseys. 
From at least the early 1960s, while still in Milwaukee County Stadium, 
until the early 1980s at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, this mascot "lived" 
in a teepee in an unoccupied section of the bleacher seats. The teepee 
was involved in a bit of controversy in 1982 when the Braves, who were 
in first place in the National League West at the time, elected to remove 
the chief's home to provide more seating for the fans. The team dropped 
out of first when they lost 19 of 21 games after the removal. The teepee 
was returned to its spot and the team won the division. Opposition to Native 
American mascots caused the Braves to retire Chief Noc-A-Homa and eventually 
replace him with Homer The Brave. The Crazy Crab was a mascot of the San 
Francisco Giants for the 1984 season. As opposed to other mascots, Crazy 
Crab was meant as an "anti-mascot", satirizing on the mascot craze that 
was going on at the time. Fans were encouraged to boo the mascot (played 
by actor Wayne Doba) and manager Frank Robinson appeared in a commercial 
with the crustacean where Robinson was restrained from attacking him. This 
encouragement may have worked too well, as Giants fans regularly threw 
various dangerous objects at Crazy Crab, including beer bottles and batteries, 
and Crazy Crab's suit had to be reinforced with a fiberglass shell for 
protection.[28] The crab was so hated, players on both the Giants and even 
the opposition would throw rosin bags and other objects at the mascot. 
Doba sued the San Diego Padres after two of their players tackled him, 
causing injuries. The mascot lasted only one year and the Giants would 
not have another mascot until Lou Seal in 1996. Crazy Crab has regained 
popularity in recent years. The crab returned for the last game at Candlestick 
Park that the Giants played in 1999, and a bobblehead was given away with 
its likeness in 2008 as the franchise celebrated its fiftieth anniversary 
in the Bay Area. On July 18, 2008, the Giants held a crazy crab promotion. 
There is even a website devoted to bringing back the Crazy Crab called 
Rehab The Crab [29] and now a Crazy Crab sandwich at AT&T Park. In 2014, 
a 30 for 30 short [30] about the character directed by Colin Hanks, appeared 
on ESPN. Dandy was a short-lived mascot of the New York Yankees. He was 
a large pinstriped bird that sported a Yankees hat. He had a mustache that 
gave him an appearance similar to that of former Yankee pitcher Sparky 
Lyle. His name was a play on the classic American folk song "Yankee Doodle 
Dandy". He appeared at the start of the 1980 season and was so unpopular 
that he was quickly canceled. Dandy was beaten up by fans who didn't want 
a mascot, and quit, leading to the elimination of the character as the 
Yankees chose not to replace him. Along with this experiment, the Yankees 
briefly had mascots resembling ballpark food (plus Yankees hats on top) 
during the mid-1990s. Outside of these two occasions, the Yankees have 
not had an official mascot or cheerleading squad roam the stands or perform 
on the field, although the late Freddy Schuman has served as an unofficial 
promoter in the stands for decades, and a squirrel appearing on the field 
has brought inspiration as a mascot for the team. General Admission (a 
pun on the unreserved $4 seating section of the Astrodome) was a mascot 
for the Houston Astros in the mid-to-late 1990s. He was played by a middle 
aged white male and wore a traditional U.S. Cavalry uniform complete with 
gold stars he would affix to his uniform for every Astros home run hit 
in the Dome. Whenever an Astro hit a home run The General would fire off 
a cannon from his outfield platform that would often scare those seated 
near him. He was killed off at the end of the 1999 season when the Astros 
main mascot, Orbit, had him zapped by an alien ray gun on the penultimate 
game of the regular season. Junction Jack was the mascot character for 
the Houston Astros from 2000 until 2012. He was a 7-foot-tall (2.1 m) rabbit 
dressed as a railroad engineer. His "relatives" were Junction Julie and 
Junction Jesse, although they were not certified official mascots by the 
Astros. Junction Jack replaced Orbit when the team moved from the Astrodome 
to Minute Maid Park. The new stadium was originally called "The Ballpark 
at Union Station" because it was built on the site of the historic railway 
station in downtown Houston. In keeping with this new theme for the Astros, 
Orbit was replaced by the engineer. The character was designed by Logan 
Goodson and named by Duone Byars, both former Astros employees. After the 
2012 season, Junction Jack, Julie, and Jesse were retired, with Orbit returning 
to his former place as the Astros mascot on November 2, 2012. Orbit's return 
coincided with the Astros' move to the American League West as well as 
their new uniforms, caps, and logo. Larry, a Bull Terrier, was the mascot 
for the Cleveland Naps in the 1910s, cared for by player Jack Graney.[31] 
Mettle the Mule was a mascot of the New York Mets for a short time starting 
in 1976.[32] Originally named Arthur, Mettle was renamed as a result of 
a fan contest. Mettle was kept in a pen near the Mets' bullpen in the right 
field of Shea Stadium.[33] Philadelphia Phil and Philadelphia Phillis served 
as mascots for the Phillies during the 1970s (1971–79). Their costumes 
invoked the city's revolutionary spirit from 1776. The pair reappeared 
with their replacement—the Phanatic—as the Phillies celebrated their final 
year at Veterans Stadium in 2003, including the final opening day and final 
game. Rally was one of the Atlanta Braves mascots. He was a bear-like mascot 
and looked like Wally the Green Monster. He does not exist now. Ribbie 
and Roobarb were a pair of mascots used by the Chicago White Sox from 1981 
to 1988 at Comiskey Park. After the Sox were sold in 1981 by Bill Veeck 
to an ownership group headed by Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn, the 
new owners, who were eager to draw on the 1970s popularity of such mascots 
as The San Diego Chicken, hired the design firm responsible for creating 
the Phillie Phanatic to create a new mascot for the Sox. They debuted the 
pair of furry mascots in September 1981, but the fans never accepted the 
two, ridiculing them throughout their tenure with the team—both because 
of their ludicrous appearance, which had no apparent connection with the 
team, and also because they were seen as an attempt to eliminate Andy the 
Clown, who had performed unofficially at Sox games since 1960. "Rhubarb" 
is longtime baseball slang for a heated on-field argument; Ribbie comes 
from the acronym RBI, for runs batted in. Often reports will say ribbie 
instead of RBI to describe it. For most of the 1980s, the patrons at Comiskey 
Park ... were asked to endure the 'antics' of baseball's least appealing 
mascots, Ribbie and Roobarb. One looked like the dim-witted son of Oscar 
the Grouch, the other like a chartreuse anteater with a genetic flaw.[34] 
After another failed mascot in the early 1990s was Waldo the White Sox 
Wolf. The White Sox introduced a new mascot, Southpaw, in 2003. Scoop and 
Clutch were mascots for the Anaheim Angels in the 1990s. The pair were 
bears wearing Angels uniforms complete with halos and wings for some time. 
They disappeared and were effectively replaced by the Rally Monkey in the 
2002 season. Souki was the mascot of the Montreal Expos, for only one season 
(1978), a figure in an Expos uniform with a giant baseball for a head. 
It was a variation of the popular mascot of the New York Mets called Mr. 
Met, but with one difference. The Expos' Mr. Met, called Souki, had odd 
antennas sticking out the sides of his head. He looked like something from 
outer space and the kids were afraid of him. During a game in late fall, 
a father attacked Souki after his child was afraid of him (and after a 
loss). Twinkie was used by the Minnesota Twins for two seasons 1980 and 
1981. Youppi! was the mascot of the Montreal Expos, before the franchise 
moved to Washington as the Washington Nationals. He is an orange furry 
creature with a white face originally leased in 1979 and designed by Bonnie 
Erickson, formerly a designer for some of Jim Henson's Muppets characters. 
Youppi! was so named resembling the phrase Yippee! or Hooray! in French. 
Youppi! was the first mascot to be thrown out of a Major League Baseball 
game: on August 23, 1989, in the 11th inning, while atop the visitors' 
dugout, Youppi! took a running leap, landing hard and noisily on its roof, 
and then sneaked into a front row seat. Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy 
Lasorda complained to the umpires and Youppi! was ejected, though he later 
returned, confined to the home team's dugout roof. Youppi! was abandoned 
as a mascot after the Expos franchise moved to Washington in 2005, but 
was adopted by the NHL's Montreal Canadiens team on September 16, 2005, 
as potentially the first sports mascot to switch their allegiance from 
one sport to another, while remaining in the same city. The following MLB 
teams do not currently have an official mascot: The "Build-A-Bear Workshop" 
Make-Your-Own-Phanatic store, at Citizens Bank Park, were the first store 
of its kind in sports. Fans are invited to buy and stuff a Phillie Phanatic 
doll and dress it up. Following the 2010 season, the Build-A- Bear in Philadelphia 
was discontinued. Similar shops have since been set up in Cincinnati (Great 
American Ball Park), Cleveland (Progressive Field), St. Louis (Busch Stadium), 
San Francisco (AT&T Park), and Washington, D.C. (Nationals Park). The Milwaukee 
Brewers also have in their main team store at Miller Park a whole section 
of their store consisting entirely of merchandise featuring the Racing 
Sausages, called The Meat Locker. Gapper, one of the official mascots of 
the Cincinnati Reds. The mascot of the Seattle Mariners, the Mariner Moose. 
Sluggerrr, the team mascot of the Kansas City Royals. Ace is the mascot
