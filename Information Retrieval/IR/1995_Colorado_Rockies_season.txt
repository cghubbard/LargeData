The Colorado Rockies' 1995 season was the 3rd for the Rockies. The team 
competed in the National League West, finishing with a record of 77-67, 
2nd in the division. This earned the Rockies the 1995 National League Wild 
Card, and a first round matchup in the playoffs against eventual World 
Series champion, the Atlanta Braves. The Braves won this first round series 
in four games, with the Rockies taking game three. Larry Walker signed 
with the Colorado Rockies, where hitter-friendly Coors Field contributed 
to an instant boom in his statistics. Walker was a major factor in Colorado's 
winning 1995 season, hitting .301 with 36 home runs and 101 RBI. He remains 
in the top ten in many offensive categories for the Rockies.[6] The Rockies 
led the NL in hits (1,406), runs scored (785), triples (43, also the most 
in the Majors), home runs (200), runs batted in (749), batting average 
(.282) and slugging percentage (.471). Conversely, they also allowed the 
most hits (1,443), runs (783), earned runs (711) and produced the fewest 
shutouts (1).[7][8] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
