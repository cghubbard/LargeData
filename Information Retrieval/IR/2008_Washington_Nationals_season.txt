The Washington Nationals' 2008 season was the fourth season for the franchise 
in the District of Columbia, and the 40th since the original team was started 
in Montreal, Quebec, in 1969. It also marked the first season the Nationals 
played at Nationals Park. The team finished in last place in the National 
League East with a record of 59–102, the worst record in Major League Baseball. 
On November 30, 2007, the Nationals traded Ryan Church and Brian Schneider 
to the New York Mets for Lastings Milledge.[1] On December 3, 2007, they 
traded minor-leaguer Glenn Gibson to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for Elijah 
Dukes,[2] and on the following day they traded Jonathan Albaladejo to the 
New York Yankees for Tyler Clippard.[3] The Nationals held their 2008 spring 
training in Viera, Florida, with home games played at Space Coast Stadium. 
The Nationals opened the 2008 MLB season by hosting the Atlanta Braves 
in a nationally-televised night game on March 30, 2008. It was the first 
professional regular-season game to be played at the Nationals' new facility 
Nationals Park. President George W. Bush threw the ceremonial first pitch 
to Nationals' manager Manny Acta, and Ryan Zimmerman hit a two-out, walk-off 
home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to mark an exciting beginning 
to the 2008 season. The Nationals also blew out the Phillies 11-6. The 
Nationals clinched the series against the Phillies, winning 1-0. However, 
the Nationals struggled after a promising 3-0 start, losing 16 of their 
next 19 games to start off 6-16. They improved for the rest of the month, 
earning splits at Atlanta and at home against the Mets, and winning series 
against the Braves and the Pirates. Pope Benedict XVI celebrated Mass at 
Nationals Park in front of 47,000 people on April 17 while the Nationals 
were on a road trip. The Nats started May winning 3 of the first 4 games 
of the month, earning them a 14-18 record, but lost 2 of 3 at Houston and 
were swept by the Florida Marlins at home. Then they took 3 of 4 against 
the struggling Mets at Shea Stadium, but in the first Beltway Series of 
2008 they were nipped by the Orioles at Baltimore and lost two of three 
against the high-powered Phillies' offense. They split a series two games 
apiece against the Brewers and lost a series to the Padres. The Nats then 
beat up on the Diamondbacks in the first game of a series. The team finished 
59-102, the worst record in Major League Baseball. Six of the team's coaches 
were dismissed the day before the final game (a loss to the 2008 World 
Series champion Philadelphia Phillies); only manager Manny Acta and pitching 
coach Randy St. Clair were retained. The 2008 Major League Baseball First-Year 
Player Draft took place on June 5 and 6. With their first pick – the ninth 
pick overall – the Nationals selected pitcher Aaron Crow. Other notable 
players the Nationals selected were shortstop Danny Espinosa (third round, 
87th overall), catcher Adrián Nieto (fifth round, 151st overall), pitcher 
Tommy Milone (10th round, 301st overall), pitcher Louis Coleman (14th round, 
421st overall), first baseman Tyler Moore (16th round, 481st overall), 
shortstop Steve Lombardozzi, Jr. (19th round, 571st overall), pitcher Cory 
Mazzoni (26th round, 781st overall), pitcher Chris Heston (29th round, 
871st overall), catcher Rob Brantly (46th round, 1,378th overall), and 
outfielder Alex Dickerson (48th round, 1,432nd overall).[5] Crow, Coleman, 
Mazzoni, Heston, Brantly, and Dickerson all opted not to sign with the 
team. Moore finally did sign with the Nationals; it was the third time 
they had drafted him, but he had opted not to sign with them the first 
two times (in 2005 and 2006). Infielders Outfielders Coaches The Nationals 
drew 2,320,400 fans at Nationals Park in 2008, placing them 13th in attendance 
for the season among the 16 National League teams. Boosted by the opening 
of Nationals Park at the beginning of the season, it was their second-best 
attendance total in their short history in Washington, exceeded only by 
the 2,731,993 they drew in 2005, their first season in Washington.[6][7]
