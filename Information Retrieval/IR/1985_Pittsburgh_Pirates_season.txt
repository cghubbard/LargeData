The 1985 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the 104th season of the franchise; 
the 99th in the National League. The Pirates finished sixth and last in 
the National League East with a record of 57–104, 43½ games behind the 
NL Champion St. Louis Cardinals. The team was beset during the offseason 
with the triple threat of its longtime owner taking bids for the debt laden 
franchise, rumors of a possible relocation to cities such as Tampa, Denver 
and New Orleans and the expanding Pittsburgh drug trials.[2] Off season 
transactions included: Infielders Coaches 1985 Major League Baseball All-Star
