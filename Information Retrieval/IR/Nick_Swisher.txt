Nicholas Thomas "Nick" Swisher (born November 25, 1980) is an American 
professional baseball right fielder and first baseman who plays for the 
New York Yankees in Major League Baseball. He is a switch hitter who throws 
left-handed, and has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland 
Athletics, Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, and 
Atlanta Braves. He won the 2009 World Series with the Yankees against the 
Philadelphia Phillies and was an All-Star in 2010. Swisher is the son of 
former MLB catcher Steve Swisher, who played for various National League 
baseball clubs in the 1970s and 1980s. Swisher was born in Columbus, Ohio, 
but grew up in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Before his professional career, 
Swisher played college baseball for the Ohio State Buckeyes. Drafted by 
the A's in the 2002 MLB draft, Swisher made his MLB debut with the Athletics 
in 2004, and played for the team through 2007. After spending one year 
with the White Sox in 2008, the Yankees acquired him prior to the start 
of the 2009 campaign. He played in New York for four years before signing 
with the Cleveland Indians prior to the 2013 season. Swisher was born in 
Columbus, Ohio, the son of Lillian Marie (Vaught) Malizia and Steve Swisher, 
a former major leaguer.[1] His mother was of part Italian descent; her 
grandfather immigrated to the Buffalo area from the town of Oliveri, in 
Sicily.[2][3] Swisher's parents divorced when he was 11 years old. He then 
went to live with his grandparents in Parkersburg, West Virginia, who raised 
him during his teenage years.[4] Swisher was a two-sport star at Parkersburg 
High School in football and baseball as well as a letterman in basketball. 
As a strong safety he was recruited by several Division I-A football programs, 
including University of Notre Dame, but chose to pursue baseball.[5] Undrafted 
in the Major League Baseball Draft out of high school, Swisher enrolled 
at Ohio State University, as that school and Ohio University were the only 
colleges to recruit him for baseball.[5] Playing for the Ohio State Buckeyes 
baseball team in the Big Ten Conference, Swisher was named Big Ten Freshman 
of the Year in 2000, after hitting .299 with 10 home runs and 48 runs batted 
in (RBI). He was an All-Big Ten selection as a first baseman as a sophomore 
in 2001, after hitting .322 with 56 RBI and a league-leading 15 home runs. 
He earned All-Big Ten honors as an outfielder in 2002, after batting .348 
with 10 home runs and 52 RBI.[6] Swisher was selected by the Oakland Athletics 
with the Boston Red Sox first round pick in 2002 as compensation for the 
loss of free agent Johnny Damon. Swisher, and the Athletics' 2002 draft, 
are heavily featured in Michael Lewis' 2003 book Moneyball. In a book whose 
key theme is the gulf between orthodox baseball thinking and the new sabermetric 
influenced system being implemented by Billy Beane, Swisher was notable 
as one of the few examples of a player who traditional scouts and Beane 
could agree upon.[7] Swisher made his professional debut with the Vancouver 
Canadians of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League in 2002,[8] before 
he was promoted to the Visalia Oaks of the Class A-Advanced California 
League.[9] Swisher started the 2003 season with the Modesto A's, Oakland's 
new California League affiliate, where he batted .296 in 51 games before 
receiving a promotion to the Midland RockHounds of the Class AA Texas League 
in June.[10] He batted .230 in 76 games for Midland to finish the season, 
and then played in the Arizona Fall League for the Mesa Desert Dogs.[11] 
Swisher played for the Sacramento River Cats of the Class AAA Pacific Coast 
League for the 2004 season. That season, he led all minor league baseball 
players with 103 walks.[12] Swisher made his MLB debut in 2004 for the 
Athletics, playing in 20 games. Retaining his rookie status for 2005,[a] 
Swisher hit 21 home runs and recorded 74 RBI in 131 games for the 2005 
Athletics. He finished 6th in the American League Rookie of the Year voting. 
Teammate Huston Street won the award, while fellow 2002 Oakland draftee 
Joe Blanton finished seventh.[14] Following his rookie season, Swisher 
improved in most offensive categories. During the 2006 regular season, 
Swisher compiled a .254 batting average with 35 home runs. He also improved 
his on-base percentage by raising it to .372, as well as boosting his slugging 
percentage to .493. Swisher finished second for the team in on-base plus 
slugging behind the veteran slugger Frank Thomas. Swisher spent about half 
of his playing time in left field, and the other half at first base. The 
Oakland A's lacked both Dan Johnson and Erubiel Durazo for a large portion 
of the 2006 season, leaving room for Swisher to move back into his preferred 
position on a temporary basis.[15] During the season, Swisher wrote a column 
for ESPN.com about his various baseball experiences called Sophomore Year. 
This included multiple articles that pertained to his early MLB playing 
experiences, as well as the MLB Draft of 2002.[16] Swisher made his postseason 
debut as the Oakland A's took on the Minnesota Twins in the 2006 ALDS. 
Swisher got 3 hits and an RBI during the series as the Oakland A's performed 
a 3-game sweep against the Twins to advance to the ALCS. During the 2006 
ALCS vs the Detroit Tigers, Swisher had a .100 batting average with one 
hit. The Oakland A's would eventually lose the ALCS to the Tigers in just 
4 games. On September 16, 2007, Swisher initiated a brawl when he charged 
the mound after getting hit by a pitch from Texas Rangers pitcher Vicente 
Padilla. Earlier in the plate appearance, Padilla (who had hit Swisher 
the prior year) threw two inside pitches with the apparent intention of 
hitting Swisher. Both players were ejected following the brawl. Swisher 
was traded on January 3, 2008 to the Chicago White Sox for minor leaguers 
Ryan Sweeney, Gio Gonzalez, and Fautino de los Santos as part of what Athletics 
general manager Billy Beane termed a "rebuilding effort".[17] While Swisher 
quickly established himself as a fan favorite on his new team he struggled 
offensively, batting just .219 through the season (the lowest batting average 
in the majors), though he improved his home run total from 22 in 2007 to 
24 in 2008.[18][19] He also led the majors in pitches per plate appearance, 
with 4.51.[20] Because of his poor offensive play White Sox manager Ozzie 
Guillén benched Swisher for most of September, saying publicly that "I 
have to put the best lineup out there to win the game ... To me, the best 
lineup right now is without (Swisher)."[21] Swisher finished the 2008 regular 
season with a .219 batting average, 24 home runs, and 69 RBI. Despite his 
career low stats in the regular season, Swisher was included in the postseason 
roster for the White Sox. During the 2008 ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays, 
Swisher had a hit and 2 walks. The White Sox would eventually lose the 
division series against the Rays in 4 games. On November 13, 2008, Swisher 
and minor league pitcher Kanekoa Texeira were traded to the New York Yankees 
for utility man Wilson Betemit and minor league pitchers Jeffrey Marquez 
and Jhonny Núñez.[22] Swisher was acquired to be the Yankees starting first 
baseman. However, the Yankees signed Mark Teixeira later in the offseason, 
who took the starting role.[23] At the end of spring training, manager 
Joe Girardi announced that Xavier Nady would be starting in right field 
while Swisher would be a bench player.[24][25] Due to the perceived logjam, 
many teams reportedly pursued Swisher,[26][27] but the Yankees opted to 
keep him as a reserve outfielder and first baseman. On April 9, 2009, in 
a game against the Baltimore Orioles, Swisher started for the first time 
as a Yankee in right field, replacing Xavier Nady who was playing DH to 
give Hideki Matsui a rest. Swisher went 3-for-5 with a home run and tying 
his career high of five RBIs. Just five days later, Swisher became the 
starting right fielder after Nady went on the disabled list due to an elbow 
injury.[28] On April 13, 2009, in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Swisher 
pitched one inning in relief, allowing one hit and one walk before retiring 
the next three batters in a row, including a strikeout against Gabe Kapler 
in his first pitching appearance in the major leagues.[29] He was the first 
Yankee position player to pitch since Wade Boggs in 1997 and the first 
Yankee to homer and pitch in the same game since Lindy McDaniel did it 
in Detroit on September 28, 1972.[30] Swisher hit his first postseason 
home run in the 2009 World Series. He got his first championship title 
as the Yankees eventually won the World Series against the Philadelphia 
Phillies in 6 games. Due to a .128 batting average in the 2009 postseason, 
Swisher worked with hitting coach Kevin Long to reinvent his swing for 
the 2010 season.[31] Swisher was a contestant in the 2010 All-Star Final 
Vote from July 4 to 8. Swisher lobbied for the post with a promotion commercial 
of him with a surf board to indicate that he would be surfing in Southern 
California since the game was to be hosted by the Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim. In what was to that date the closest vote in Final Vote history, 
he won the final place on the AL roster ahead of Red Sox first baseman 
Kevin Youkilis.[32] Additionally, Swisher participated in the Home Run 
Derby.[33] Swisher finished the season with a career-high .288 batting 
average and 29 home runs.[34] Although Swisher was usually hitting in the 
bottom third of the lineup, he was moved into the #2 slot in the lineup 
after Nick Johnson went down with an injury and served as a buffer for 
the middle of the Yankees lineup. In 2011, Swisher was moved down in the 
lineup to allow Curtis Granderson to hit second behind Derek Jeter and 
spent the majority of the season hitting sixth behind Robinson Canó. His 
fielding percentage ranked 2nd among all American League Right Fielders 
with a .996 behind Baltimore's Nick Markakis. Although Swisher's totals 
dipped a bit from his 2010 career year, he still managed to hit .260 and 
was one of four Yankees with at least 20 home runs (after Granderson, Teixeira, 
and Cano) and finished fourth on the team with 85 RBIs. During the Bleacher 
Creatures' roll call at the top of the first inning, Swisher was known 
to come to attention and salute the bleachers.[citation needed] On November 
9, 2012, Swisher declined a $13.3 million one-year qualifying offer from 
the Yankees, making him a free agent. Under the new collective bargaining 
agreement, the Yankees received a compensatory pick because the Indians 
signed Swisher but it was not the Indians' pick. Cleveland, in turn, surrendered 
its highest pick outside of the top ten but that pick did not go to the 
Yankees, it was just skipped in the draft.[35] On December 23, 2012, Swisher 
agreed to a four-year, $56 million contract with the Cleveland Indians. 
The contract reportedly included a fifth year vesting option worth $14 
million, making the total contract worth $70 million. The deal became official 
on January 3, 2013.[36] He soon called a section of the stadium Brohio. 
The 2014 season marked a difficult one for Swisher, as injuries had caused 
him to post career lows in batting average (.208), games played (97) and 
home runs (8).[37] On June 19, 2014, after going 0–4 at the plate with 
three strike outs, and with two outs and two strikes, Swisher hit a walk-off 
grand slam against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim propelling the Indians 
to a 5–3 win in ten innings. On August 20, the Indians announced that Swisher 
would have arthroscopic surgery on both of his knees, ending his season. 
Swisher began the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list due to still 
recovering from surgery on both knees. On May 5, Swisher was activated 
from the disabled list and played almost exclusively at DH for Cleveland 
before he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with left knee inflammation 
on June 14.[38] On August 7, 2015, the Indians traded Swisher and Michael 
Bourn with cash considerations to the Atlanta Braves for Chris Johnson.[39] 
Swisher batted .195 in 46 games for the Braves.[40] On March 28, 2016, 
the Braves released Swisher, despite owing him $15 million for the 2016 
season.[41] On April 14, 2016, Swisher signed a minor league contract to 
return to the Yankees. They assigned him to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders 
of the Class AAA International League.[42] Playing first base, Swisher 
batted .255 with seven home runs and 25 RBIs in 55 games. The Yankees opted 
not to promote Swisher to the major leagues, in spite of injuries suffered 
by Mark Teixeira, Dustin Ackley, and Chris Parmelee. On July 2, Swisher 
opted out of his contract to be with his family following the birth of 
his second daughter.[43] Swisher's father, Steve Swisher, played 509 games 
in the major leagues with the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, and San 
Diego Padres from 1974 through 1982.[44] Swisher was very close to his 
paternal grandmother, Betty Lorraine Swisher, who raised him after his 
parents' divorce. She died from brain cancer in 2005, and he has a memorial 
tattoo in her honor on his chest (her initials, surrounded by angel's wings 
and a halo.)[4] Swisher routinely looks up to the sky to honor his parents 
and grandparents. He also touches his lips and points to the sky in his 
grandmother's honor after he gets a hit as well as inking her initials 
on the bottom of his bats' knobs and kissing the letters when he comes 
to home plate.[4] To honor her further, he let his hair grow for eleven 
months and donated it to Pantene Beautiful Lengths, a program that creates 
free wigs for cancer patients. On May 19, 2007, he cut his hair with assistance 
from his father.[45] His website, nickswisher.net, is also dedicated to 
his grandmother.[46] After his grandfather, Don, died in November 2008, 
Swisher began adding his initials to his bats as well. He later stated 
that he planned on getting another tattoo on his back in the same style 
as his existing one after the 2009 season to honor his grandfather.[4] 
In August 2009, People reported that Swisher was dating actress JoAnna 
Garcia.[47] Swisher and García became engaged in May 2010,[48] and married 
on December 11, 2010, at the Breakers Hotel & Resort in Palm Beach, Florida.[49] 
The couple have two daughters, Emerson Jay Swisher, born on May 21, 2013[50][51] 
and Sailor Stevie Swisher, born on June 28, 2016.[52] In 2011, Swisher 
guest starred as himself on two episodes of his wife's sitcom, Better with 
You. The first episode aired February 16 and the second aired February 
23.[53] He also appeared in the episode "Perfect Week" of How I Met Your 
Mother,[54] which aired in February 2010. Swisher released a children's 
music album titled "Believe" on August 9, 2011. A percentage of the proceeds 
will be donated to "Swish's Wishes", a charity started by Swisher for children 
who are facing health crises. The 12-song album features guest appearances 
from Bernie Williams and Barry Zito. All of the songs recorded on the album 
are cover songs that were selected by Swisher.[55] The album peaked at
