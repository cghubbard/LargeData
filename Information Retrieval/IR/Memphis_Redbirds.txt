The Memphis Redbirds are a minor league baseball team of the Pacific Coast 
League (PCL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. They 
are located in Memphis, Tennessee, and play their home games at AutoZone 
Park which opened in 2000 and seats 10,000.[2] The team previously played 
at Tim McCarver Stadium in 1998 and 1999. They were established as a PCL 
expansion team in 1998. A total of 6 managers have led the club and its 
more than 500 players.[3] As of the completion of the 2,719 regular season 
games and compiled a win–loss record of 1,340–1,379 (.493).[4] They won 
the Pacific Coast League Championship in 2000 and 2009.[5] The first professional 
baseball team in Memphis was the Memphis Reds of the League Alliance in 
1877. They were followed by the Grays, Browns, Giants, Fever Germs, Lambs, 
Egyptians, Turtles, Chickasaws, Blues, and Chicks.[6] In 1997, Memphis 
was home to the Double-A Chicks of the Southern League. The Memphis Redbirds 
were created as an expansion team of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League 
in 1998.[7] This resulted in the Chicks relocating to nearby Jackson, where 
they became known the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx.[8] Initially, the Redbirds 
were owned as a non-profit community entity called the Memphis Redbirds 
Baseball Foundation and operated by Global Spectrum, a Comcast-owned company.[9][10] 
While a new ballpark, AutoZone Park, was constructed for the team, they 
played their first two seasons (1998–99) at the city's Tim McCarver Stadium. 
The Redbirds became the top minor league affiliate of the major league 
St. Louis Cardinals. Memphis' team name, logo, color scheme, and uniforms 
were all based on those of the St. Louis team. In their inaugural season, 
the club was managed by Gaylen Pitts. The Redbirds played their first game 
on the road at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska. In game one 
of the doubleheader, the Omaha Royals defeated the Redbirds, 3–2.[11] The 
team finished their first season of play with a 74–70 record, three games 
out of first place, leaving them second out of four teams in their division.[12] 
They finished the 1999 season in third place with a 74–64 record.[13] In 
2000, Memphis moved into the newly constructed AutoZone Park. In the park's 
first regular season game, held on April 14, the Redbirds defeated the 
Iowa Cubs, 14–3.[14] Memphis went on to clinch the Pacific Coast League's 
American Conference East Division Championship by ending the season in 
first place, 13 1⁄2 games ahead of the second-place Oklahoma RedHawks.[15] 
In the American Conference Championship, the Redbirds defeated the Albuquerque 
Isotopes, 3–2 in the best-of-five series, and advanced to the league championship.[5] 
Memphis then defeated the Salt Lake Buzz, 3–1, to win the PCL Championship.[5] 
The Redbirds went on to face the Indianapolis Indians, league champions 
of the Triple-A International League, in the best-of-five Triple-A World 
Series. Memphis lost, three games to one.[16] The team finished each of 
the next three seasons in fourth place—2001 (62–81),[18] 2002 (71–71),[19] 
and 2003 (64–79).[20] The 2002 campaign was a particularly tight race within 
the American Conference East Division, as the fourth-place Redbirds were 
a mere three games behind first-place Oklahoma.[19] Tom Spencer became 
manager of the Redbirds in 2013. He was replaced midseason by Danny Sheaffer. 
Memphis hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game at AutoZone Park in 2003.[21] 
Players Jason Bowers, Matt Duff, and Jason Ryan represented Memphis, as 
they were elected to the PCL All-Star Team.[22] Pitcher Dan Haren was selected 
for the 2004 PCL All-Star Team and was chosen as the PCL Star of the Game—the 
most valuable player representing the league.[21] Memphis ended the 2004 
season in second place, eight games behind first-place Oklahoma, with a 
73–71 record.[23] The team finished third (71–72) in 2005, 3 1⁄2 games 
behind the eventual league champion Nashville Sounds.[24] From 2006 to 
2007, Memphis finished further out of first place with records of 58–86 
in 2006 and 56–88 in 2007.[25][26] The 2008 season began a reversal of 
the team's fortunes. Though winding up in second place in 2008, the team, 
under second-year manager Chris Maloney, managed a second-place finish 
with their 75–67 record.[28] In 2009, the Redbirds' first-place finish 
(77–67) earned them the American Conference North Division title and a 
return to the postseason for the first time in nine seasons.[29] In the 
American Conference Championship, Memphis faced the Albuquerque Isotopes, 
sweeping them in three-straight games.[29] They continued to also defeat 
the Sacramento River Cats, 3–0, in the championship series to win their 
second PCL Championship.[29] They then competed against the International 
League's Durham Bulls in the Bricktown Showdown for the Triple-A Baseball 
Championship, but were defeated in the single game, 5–4.[30] Having finished 
the 2010 season in a tie for first place with the Iowa Cubs (82–62), Memphis 
was awarded the American Conference North title by virtue of having won 
the regular season series against Iowa.[31] Memphis started the postseason 
by defeating the Oklahoma City RedHawks, 3–0, to win the American Conference 
Championship.[31] The Tacoma Rainiers then swept the Redbirds, defeating 
them for the PCL crown in three-straight games.[31] The 2011, the club 
narrowly missed the postseason, finishing second with a 77–66 record.[32] 
In 2012, manager Chris Maloney, the longest-tenured skipper in team history, 
was hired as St. Louis' first base coach.[33] He was replaced by Ron Warner.[34] 
He led the Redbirds to finish in third place (57–87) and 27 games out of 
first.[35] The team fared better in 2013, ending up in second place (69–75), 
just one game behind the eventual league champion Omaha Storm Chasers.[36] 
Also in 2013, Forbes ranked the Redbirds as the eighth-most valuable minor 
league franchise (tied with the Toledo Mud Hens and Louisville Bats). The 
team's net worth was estimated at $29 million, with $9.5 million in annual 
revenue and $1 million in operating loss.[37] In March 2014, the Redbirds 
were purchased by their major league parent club, the St. Louis Cardinals.[10] 
The transaction also included the City of Memphis acquiring AutoZone Park 
and then leasing it to the team.[10] Ron Warner led his club to a first-place 
finish (79–64), clinching the American Conference South.[38] They were 
defeated in the conference series, three games to one, by Omaha, who later 
won the PCL title.[38] The 2015 club, under manager Mike Shildt, finished 
in second place (73–71), two games behind the Round Rock Express.[39] The 
Cardinals sold their majority interest in the team to Peter B. Freund of 
Trinity Baseball Holdings in March 2016.[40][41] Memphis ended the 2016 
season in fourth place with a 65–77 record.[42] Memphis' chief rivals have 
been those based in Nashville, Tennessee. Located approximately 200 miles 
(320 km) to the north east and connected to Memphis by Interstate 40, Nashville 
has fielded several teams which have competed in the same leagues as Memphis' 
teams since the late 19th century.[44] The Redbirds entered the rivalry 
when they joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998.[45] The Redbirds and 
the Nashville Sounds were division rivals in the American Conference East 
Division from 1998 to 2004,[45] the American Conference North Division 
from 2005 to 2013,[46] and the American Conference Southern Division since 
2014.[47] In 2009, Memphis clinched the American Conference North Division 
title, finishing the season just two games ahead of Nashville which spent 
the majority of the season in first place.[48] Similarly, Memphis finished 
the 2014 season two-and-a-half games ahead of Nashville despite trailing 
the Sounds for most of the season.[49] From 2012 to 2015, the two teams 
competed in the I-40 Cup Series, a season-long, 16-game promotional series 
between the clubs.[50] Whichever of the two won the most games played between 
them was declared the winner and got to keep the trophy cup until the next 
season. The losing team donated game tickets to a charity selected by the 
winner. The Sounds won the inaugural 2012 contest (9–7), and Memphis won 
the 2013 series (7–9).[50] The teams tied the 2014 and 2015 series (both 
8–8), but the Redbirds retained the title in both instances.[51] After 
2015, the teams discontinued the trophy cup, friendly wager, and promotional 
references to the Series. As of the completion of the 2015 series, Memphis 
leads the all-time series against Nashville with a record of 897–872 (.507).[52] 
This record encompasses all 91 years of competition in the original Southern 
League, Southern Association, Southern League, and Pacific Coast League. 
Nashville, however, leads the all-time 18-year PCL series with a record 
of 154–132 (.538).[50] The Redbirds played their first two seasons at Tim 
McCarver Stadium while a new, permanent stadium was being constructed downtown. 
The stadium was built in 1963 for use as an American Legion field. When 
the Texas League's Memphis Blues came to town in 1968, it became their 
home ballpark. It was later used by the Memphis Chicks until 1997. The 
stadium, with a 8,800 person capacity, was demolished in 2005. The Redbirds' 
current home ballpark is AutoZone Park, which opened on April 1, 2000, 
and seats 10,000 people. It was constructed in downtown Memphis at a cost 
of $80.5 million.[53] It was built to Major League Baseball standards, 
but with the absence of outfield seats or food vendors far down the foul 
lines. The first game played at the park was an exhibition between Memphis 
and St. Louis. A standing-room-only crowd witnessed the big league club 
defeat their Triple-A affiliate, 10–6.[14] Memphis' current uniforms are 
quite similar to those of the St. Louis Cardinals. Home uniforms consist 
of white jerseys with the team's primary logo sewn across the chest: the 
word "Memphis" in red letters surrounded by navy blue set against a yellow 
baseball bat on which two red cardinals are perched. The player's number 
is displayed on the front left below the Memphis wordmark in red block 
characters bordered by navy blue. The upper left sleeve has a circular 
navy blue patch with the St. Louis Cardinals' overlapping "STL" logo on 
the center in red letters bordered by white. The player's last name is 
sewn on the back in red block characters surrounded by navy blue, and his 
number is displayed below his name in the same font and colors. White pants 
are worn with red belts and predominately red shoes. Some players wear 
higher pants paired with red socks with white and navy blue stripes. The 
home cap is solid red with a white "M" bordered by navy blue on the center.[54] 
Road uniforms are identical to those worn for home games with only a few 
exceptions: jerseys and pants are made from gray material, the St. Louis 
patch is absent from the sleeve, and the cap is navy blue with a red button 
and a red "M" with white border.[55] The Memphis Redbirds' mascot is an 
anthropomorphic cardinal named Rockey the Redbird. He is bright red with 
black eyebrows and feathers around the face and a yellow beak and legs. 
He wears the same style jerseys as the team bearing the number .05. He 
made his debut in the Redbirds' inaugural 1998 season.[56] Pitchers Catchers

players The Memphis Redbirds have not honored any of their players by retiring 
their uniform numbers. However, the St. Louis Cardinals' retired numbers 
are also retired throughout the Cardinals' minor league organization. When 
a number is retired, only the player with the retired number can wear that 
number if he returns to that team as a player or coach. This ensures that 
the number will be associated with one player of particular importance 
to the team. The following numbers are, therefore, also retired by Memphis:[57] 
Over the course of 19 seasons, the Memphis Redbirds have employed 6 managers. 
The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on 
and off the field.[58] Two managers have guided the team to win the Pacific 
Coast League Championship: Gaylen Pitts (2000) and Chris Maloney (2009).[59] 
Maloney is the longest-tenured manager in team history, having managed
