In baseball, the squeeze play (aka squeeze bunt) is a maneuver consisting 
of a sacrifice bunt with a runner on third base. The batter bunts the ball, 
expecting to be thrown out at first base, but providing the runner on third 
base an opportunity to score. Such a bunt is uncommon with two outs because 
there is a significant chance that the batter would be thrown out at first 
base, ending the inning. Likewise, such an attempt is unlikely with two 
strikes because a bunt that is fouled off with two strikes is an automatic 
strike out. The squeeze play is said to have been invented during a college 
game at Yale University by Dutch Carter and George B. Case.[1][2] In a 
safety squeeze, the runner at third does not take off until the batter 
makes contact bunting, waiting for more certainty that the ball will go 
to a location from which it will be difficult for the fielding team to 
make an out at home plate. In a suicide squeeze, the runner takes off as 
soon as the pitcher begins to throw the pitch, before releasing the ball. 
If properly executed, a play at home plate is extremely unlikely. However, 
if the batter fails to make contact with the pitch, the runner is likely 
to be put out at home plate (hence, "suicide"). Therefore, the suicide 
squeeze usually requires a skilled bunter who can make contact consistently, 
even on difficult pitches. These plays are often used in the late innings
