The Colombian Professional Baseball League, also known as the Colombian 
Winter League, is a professional baseball league based in Colombia. It 
is a winter league that plays during three months during the Major League 
Baseball offseason. Colombian Professional Baseball League is commonly 
divided into three eras: from 1948 to 1958, from 1979 to 1988, and from 
1993 to the present. In the middle of 2004 the Colombian Professional Baseball 
League was accepted in the Caribbean Confederation of Professional Baseball,

to continue pursuing participation in the Caribbean Series in 2012. The 
league added two teams for the 2010–11 season: the Potros de Medellín (Medellín
