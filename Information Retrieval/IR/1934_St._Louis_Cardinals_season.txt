The 1934 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 53rd season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and the 43rd season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
95–58 during the season and finished first in the National League. In the 
World Series, they defeated the Detroit Tigers in seven games, winning 
the last 11–0. Pitcher Dizzy Dean won the MVP Award this year, with 30 
wins, 195 strikeouts, and a 2.66 ERA. He was also named the Associated 
Press Athlete of the Year.[2] The Gashouse Gang was a nickname applied 
to the Cardinals team of 1934. The Cardinals, by most accounts, earned 
this nickname from the team's generally very shabby appearance and rough-and-tumble 
tactics. An opponent once stated that the Cardinals players usually went 
into the field in unwashed, dirty, and smelly uniforms, which alone spread 
horror among their rivals. According to one account, scrappy shortstop 
Leo Durocher coined the term. He and his teammates were speaking derisively 
of the American League, and the consensus was that the Redbirds – should 
they prevail in the National League race – would handle whoever won the 
AL pennant. "Why, they wouldn't even let us in that league over there", 
Durocher, who had played for the New York Yankees, observed. "They think 
we're just a bunch of gashousers." The phrase "gas house" referred to plants 
that manufactured town gas for lighting and cooking from coal, which were 
common fixtures in US cities prior to the widespread use of natural gas. 
The plants were noted for their foul smell and were typically located near 
railroad yards in the poorest neighborhood in the city. Led by playing 
manager Frankie Frisch and the hard-nosed Durocher, as well as stars like 
Joe Medwick, Ripper Collins, Pepper Martin, Bill DeLancey and brothers 
Dizzy and Paul Dean, the '34 Cardinals won 95 games, the NL pennant, and 
the World Series in seven games over the Detroit Tigers. The team featured 
five regulars who hit at least .300, a 30-game winner in Dizzy Dean (the 
last National League pitcher to win 30 games in a single season, and the 
last pitcher in Major League Baseball to do so until Denny McLain accomplished 
the feat for the 1968 Detroit Tigers), and four All-Stars, including player-manager 
Frisch. Not among the All-Stars was Collins, the first baseman who led 
the team in 16 offensive categories, with stats like a .333 batting average, 
a .615 slugging percentage, 35 home runs, and 128 runs batted in. [1] [2]

two games in Detroit, and the Tigers took two of the next three in St. 
Louis. St. Louis proceeded to win the next two, including an 11–0 embarrassment 
of the Tigers in Detroit to win the Series. The stars for the Cardinals 
were Medwick, who had a .379 batting average with one of St. Louis' two 
home runs and a series-high five RBI, and the Dean brothers, who combined 
for all four of the teams wins with 28 strikeouts and a minuscule 1.43 
earned run average. NL St. Louis Cardinals (4) vs. AL Detroit Tigers (3)
