Daniel Wayne "Danny" Darwin (born October 25, 1955), known as the "Bonham 
Bullet" and "Dr. Death", is a former pitcher of Major League Baseball. 
He amassed 171 wins and 182 losses over his career for 8 different Major 
League teams with a 3.84 earned run average. He is currently the pitching 
coach for the AA Chattanooga Lookouts. Danny attended Bonham High School 
and Grayson County College. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the 
Texas Rangers on May 10, 1976. He began his professional career with the 
Asheville Tourists in Single-A in 1976. He pitched for the Double-A Tulsa 
Drillers in 1977 and the Triple-A Tucson Toros in 1978. With Tulsa, he 
was 13-4, 2.41 ERA in 23 starts with six complete games and four shutouts. 
He made his major league debut on September 8, 1978. He pitched two innings 
of relief in an 11-4 loss against the Oakland Athletics, giving up one 
run and two hits. He had his first major league start, against the Seattle 
Mariners, in the second game of a double-header on September 24, 1978. 
He pitched six innings, giving up eight hits, striking out seven, and allowing 
only one walk to record his first victory. Darwin did not become a full-time 
starter until 1981, a strike-shortened season. He made 22 starts that year, 
carving out a 9-9 record with a 3.64 ERA. He remained in Texas starting 
rotation until he was traded on January 18, 1985 to the Milwaukee Brewers 
(along with Bill Nance for Don Slaught). In 1985 for the Brewers, he finished 
with a record of 8-18, coming very close to losing 20 games. He was traded 
during the 1986 season to the Houston Astros for Mark Knudson and Don August. 
He remained with Houston through 1990, gradually being switched from a 
starting pitcher to a reliever by his last years with the Astros. In his 
final season in Houston, he was 11-4, 2.21 era in 48 games (17 starts) 
to win the National League ERA title. He signed with the Boston Red Sox 
as a free agent after the season and pitched with them for four seasons, 
both as a starter and a reliever. After leaving the Red Sox, he had a shaky 
season in 1995, starting with the Toronto Blue Jays, but being cut midway 
through the season (with a 1-8 record and 7.62 era) and signing with the 
Texas Rangers again. His return to Texas was short lived as he spent the 
last three years of his career bouncing around between teams. He signed 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1996, who traded him back to the Astros 
at mid-season (for Rich Loiselle). Then he signed with the Chicago White 
Sox in 1997, only to be dealt at the trading deadline to the San Francisco 
Giants as part of a multi-player deal that sent Wilson Álvarez and Roberto 
Hernández to the Giants and Keith Foulke, Bob Howry, Lorenzo Barceló, Mike 
Caruso, Ken Vining, and Brian Manning to the White Sox in what became known 
as the White Flag Trade.[1] He finished his career in 1998, pitching 1/3 
of an inning for the Giants in his final appearance against the Pirates. 
Danny's younger brother, Jeff Darwin (born 1969), also had a professional 
baseball career that lasted eleven years. Jeff, who also graduated from 
Bonham High School, spent parts of three seasons in the majors, including 
1996–1997 with the Chicago White Sox. Both Danny & Jeff were in the White 
Sox organization in 1997 but Danny was traded on July 31 and Jeff was not 
called up from the Minors until August 17. In 1998 again they were both 
with the Giants but Jeff spent the year at AAA and was not called up. Darwin 
is the sponsor of the "Danny Darwin Celebrity Open Golf Tournament" at 
North Central Texas College.[2] He was the Pitching Coach for the Jacksonville 
Suns in the Double-A Southern League from 2006–2007 and the pitching coach 
of the Class-A Great Lakes Loons from 2008–2009 before joining Chattanooga 
for 2010. Darwin was nicknamed "Doctor Death" by Houston Astros teammate 
Nolan Ryan because of how tough Darwin was and all the fights he had purportedly 
won. During a brawl between the Phillies and the Giants, Orel Hershiser 
claims Darwin punched him in the face. At the time, the two were teammates.[3] 
During a game while playing with the Giants, Darwin and Barry Bonds got 
into a heated argument when Bonds lazily fielded a hit that became an RBI.[4]
