The 1992 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 110th season in Major 
League Baseball, their 35th season in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 33rd at Candlestick Park. 
The team finished in fifth place in the National League West with a record 
of 72 wins and 90 losses. This year, Giants owner Bob Lurie agreed in principle 
to sell his team to a Tampa Bay-based group of investors led by Vince Naimoli, 
who would then move the team to St. Petersburg. However, in November 1992, 
National League owners nixed the move under pressure from San Francisco 
officials, and the Giants were sold to a group that kept them in San Francisco.[1]
