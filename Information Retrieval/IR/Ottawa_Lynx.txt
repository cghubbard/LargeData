The Ottawa Lynx were a minor league baseball team that competed in the 
Triple-A International League (IL) from 1993 to 2007. The team's home field 
was Lynx Stadium in Ottawa, Ontario. Over the team's 15 seasons, it was 
the Triple-A Minor League affiliate of the Montreal Expos (1993–2002), 
Baltimore Orioles (2003–2006), and Philadelphia Phillies (2007). At the 
time, it was the only IL franchise in Canada. In late August 2006, the 
league approved the conditions to negotiate the sale of the team. The new 
owners moved the team to Allentown, Pennsylvania, beginning with the 2008 
season, where it is known as the Lehigh Valley IronPigs.[1] The team's 
move to Allentown, the third largest city in Pennsylvania, has brought 
it within the Phillies' fan base region. During the club's last years, 
it had difficulty attracting fans, which was one of several factors in 
the decision to relocate the team. In 1991, Ottawa businessman and then 
Ottawa 67's owner Howard Darwin was successful in applying to the IL for 
an expansion franchise to begin play in 1993, at a cost of $5 million. 
The Lynx became the second IL franchise to play in Ottawa, after the former 
Ottawa Giants and Ottawa Athletics of the 1950s. The application was contingent 
on the City of Ottawa building a baseball stadium for the team. The stadium 
was completed in time for the 1993 season. The Lynx began play in 1993, 
serving as the top farm team for the Montreal Expos. The team won the International 
League championship in 1995, the only time it would do so. During this 
period, the Lynx featured such future Major League Baseball players as 
Rondell White, Cliff Floyd, Matt Stairs, Kirk Rueter, and F.P. Santangelo. 
The Lynx eventually retired two numbers: Santangelo's 24, and Jamey Carroll's 
3. In 2000, Darwin sold his shares in the team to Ray Pecor for $7 million. 
According to news reports, Pecor would lose $1 million annually on the 
team due to low attendance.[2] In 2003, the Lynx were not given any assurances 
from either the Montreal Expos or Major League Baseball on the long-term 
future of the Expos. They became the Triple-A affiliate of the Baltimore 
Orioles on September 24, 2002.[3] As a result, Montreal shifted its affiliation 
to the Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast League. The Lynx's working 
agreement with the Orioles ended when the latter signed a Player Development 
Contract with the Norfolk Tides on September 25, 2006.[4] In 2006, the 
ball club was sold to Joe Finley and Craig Stein, while Pecor maintained 
a minority stake. Finley and Stein declared their intention to move the 
team to Allentown, Pennsylvania, for the 2008 season, where a new stadium 
was set to begin construction that September (now built as Coca-Cola Park).[5][6] 
The owners, facing a lawsuit from the City of Ottawa if they moved the 
Lynx, filed a lawsuit against the City of Ottawa on October 17, 2006, seeking 
$10.75 million in damages claiming that the city failed to provide enough 
parking spaces, which, the team alleged, was a violation of its lease. 
The location far from the city centre might have contributed to the attendance 
problem. [7] The team played its last game in Ottawa on September 3, 2007, 
losing to Syracuse 8-5. The Ottawa Lynx ultimately won exactly 1,000 games 
before leaving Ottawa.[8] The Lynx won the Governors' Cup, the championship 
of the International League, once by defeating the Norfolk Tides in 1995.
