The Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award 
is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) award which is presented to the 
most outstanding player in each year's MLB All-Star Game. Awarded each 
season since 1962 (two games were held and an award was presented to each 
game winner in 1962), it was originally called the "Arch Ward Memorial 
Award" in honor of Arch Ward, the man who conceived of the All-Star Game 
in 1933. The award's name was changed to the "Commissioner's Trophy" in 
1970 (two National League (NL) players were presented the award in 1975), 
but this name change was reversed in 1985 when the World Series Trophy 
was renamed the Commissioner's Trophy. Finally, the trophy was renamed 
the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award in 2002, in honor of former 
Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams, who had died earlier that year.[1] 
No award was presented for the 2002 All-Star Game, which ended in a tie.[2] 
Thus, the Anaheim Angels' Garret Anderson was the first recipient of the 
newly named Ted Williams Award in 2003. The All-Star Game Most Valuable 
Player also receives a Chevrolet vehicle, choosing between two cars.[3] 
As of 2015[update], NL players have won the award 27 times (including one 
award shared by two players), and American League (AL) players have won 
28 times. Baltimore Orioles players have won the most awards for a single 
franchise (with six); players from the Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Dodgers 
and San Francisco Giants are tied for the most in the NL with five each. 
Five players have won the award twice: Willie Mays (1963, 1968), Steve 
Garvey (1974, 1978), Gary Carter (1981, 1984), Cal Ripken, Jr. (1991, 2001), 
and Mike Trout (2014, 2015). The award has been shared by multiple players 
once; Bill Madlock and Jon Matlack shared the award in 1975.[4] Two players 
have won the award for a game in which their league lost: Brooks Robinson 
in 1966 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970.[5][6] One pair of awardees were father 
and son (Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr.),[7] and another were brothers 
(Roberto Alomar and Sandy Alomar, Jr.).[8] Mike Trout of the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim became the first player ever to win the MVP award in 
back-to-back years in the 86-year history of the MLB All-Star Game when 
he accomplished the feat in both 2014 and 2015. Eric Hosmer of the Kansas 
City Royals is the most recent MLB All-Star Game MVP, winning the award 
in 2016. Only five players have won the MVP award in the only All-Star 
Game in which they appeared; LaMarr Hoyt, Bo Jackson, J.D. Drew, Melky
