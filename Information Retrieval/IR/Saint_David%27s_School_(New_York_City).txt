Saint David's School is an independent primary and pre-primary school located 
on East 89th Street in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City, 
USA. It is an all-boys school, educating students from pre-kindergarten 
through to eighth grade. Saint David's was founded in 1951.[4] The current 
headmaster is P. David O'Halloran.[1][3] Officially opening on February 
5, 1951, Saint David's began with one teacher and four students. Its purpose, 
according to its nine[5] founding families, was "to provide a sound substantial 
education for the growing boy, equal to the best, derived from institutions 
of a similar level."[3] Its mission is "to educate boys to fulfill their 
potential through rigorous academic pursuit, deliberate introspection, 
and critical analysis of ideas and issues.[5] "That they be good men, Ut 
viri boni sint."[6] While a school in the Roman Catholic tradition, Saint 
David's has always been lay-run and independent. Chaplains[7] that serve 
and have served the school are: Academically, Saint David's School has 
embraced the classical ideal of balance, providing boys a rigorous education 
while encouraging them to grow into responsible and moral world citizens. 
In the decades since its founding, Saint David's has undertaken several 
expansions, adding state-of-the-art facilities for its academic and athletics 
programs.[9] Today, the school community includes 400 students and more 
than 130 faculty and staff.[3] Saint David's School is accredited by the 
New York State Association of Independent Schools,[2] the National Association 
of Independent Schools,[10] and the Educational Records Bureau.[11] The 
Lower School provides a structured, challenging, and dynamic academic environment 
in which each boy develops a strong sense of confidence in himself as a 
learner. In the pre-primary grades, the curriculum aims to foster a love 
of discovery while cultivating the skills necessary for continued academic 
achievement. Language arts and mathematics form the core of the academic 
curriculum. Taught in small instructional groups that progress at an appropriate 
pace, reading classes balance direct instruction with group and individualized 
work.[12] Saint Davidâ€™s Upper School refines the reading, writing, speaking, 
and critical-thinking skills developed in the Lower School and prepares 
boys for the greater independence and responsibility of adolescence. Teachers 
use direct instruction to impart essential knowledge skills, but through 
collaborative, project-based learning, they also cultivate teamwork, leadership, 
and public speaking skills.[13] The school offers an extensive sports program, 
including baseball,[14] basketball, cross-country, flag football, hockey, 
lacrosse, soccer, squash (sport), and track.[15] Also with an athletic 
center located at 215 East 94th Street, they also offer an array of professional 
fitness equipment and an athletic venue. Overall, they have four gym spaces 
located in the main building and this annex.[9] Saint David's athletic 
program seeks "to cultivate a sense of sportsmanship, respect for others 
and self, cooperation, dedication, and self-confidence. We challenge boys 
to grow by fostering a healthy competitive spirit through participation, 
skill development, teamwork and commitment to achieving full athletic potential." 
Their goal is to strike a balance between athletics and academics, and 
the discipline to both work to the benefit of the whole student athlete.[15] 
As an after school elective, Saint David's also offers an ice hockey program 
which begins in kindergarten and is available until 8th grade.[16][17] 
Along with other private schools, Saint David's use of an ice rink at a 
state park in Harlem has aroused some controversy.[18][19] Saint David's 
participates in many community service initiatives. Some of which include 
their annual Halloween candy drive, their bottle cap drive, and other fundraising 
projects. They work with New York Cares for their annual coat drive,[20] 
the Graham Windham Mitten and Hat Collection,[21] Project Cicero for book 
donations,[22] City Harvest for annual food drives, Ronald McDonald's Fun 
Run,[23] Florence Nightingale Nursing Home[24] and Terence Cardinal Cooke 
Nursing Home[25][26][27] for nursing home visits and carols, and It's My 
Park Day[28] to rejuvenate New York City Parks.[29] Saint David's has also 
been very philanthropic. In 2004, they raised more that $10,000 for the 
Red Cross and their South East Asia Tsunami Fund.[29] In 2010, they raised 
$36,000 for Haiti's Recovery Fund.[29] And in 2011, they began a new initiative 
to raise money to build a school in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia with 
the help of Mimi's Building Blocks[30] and Save the Children.[31] They 
raised more than $120,000 and Saint David's Kalina School opened in Ethiopia 
in the fall of 2013.[32][33][34] They also have a special committee on 
environmental awareness and action.[35] Here, they discuss and propose 
methods on being green and environmentally friendly. Televised by CBS New 
York, they were highlighted for their efforts in collecting and recycling 
bottle caps.[36][37] They have been successful in modernizing and changing
