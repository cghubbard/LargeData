The Golden Horseshoe is a region of Southern Ontario, Canada, which lies 
at the western end of Lake Ontario with outer boundaries stretching south 
to Lake Erie and north to Georgian Bay. The region is among the most densely 
populated and industrialized in Canada. Most of it is also part of the 
Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, Quebec City–Windsor Corridor and the 
Great Lakes Megalopolis. With a population of 8.76 million people in 2011, 
the Golden Horseshoe makes up over 26% of the population of Canada and 
contains more than 68% of Ontario's population,[1] making it one of the 
largest population concentrations in North America. The area has a greater 
population than the entire province of Quebec or the three prairie provinces 
combined. Although it is a geographically named secondary region of Southern 
Ontario, the Greater Golden Horseshoe is also used today to describe a 
broader region that stretches from the area of the Trent–Severn Waterway 
to at least the Grand River area, including centres outside of the core 
region. The core of the region starts from Niagara Falls at the eastern 
end of the Niagara Peninsula and extends west, wrapping around the western 
end of Lake Ontario at Hamilton and then turning northeast to its anchor 
city Toronto (on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario), before finally 
terminating at Oshawa, just east of Toronto. The wider region spreads inland 
in all directions away from the Lake Ontario shoreline, southwest to Brantford, 
west to the Waterloo Region area, north to Barrie, and northeast to Peterborough. 
The whole region's area covers approximately 33,500 km2 (13,000 sq mi), 
out of this, 7,300 km2 (2,800 sq mi) or approximately 22% of the area is 
covered by the environmentally protected Greenbelt. The Golden Horseshoe 
has been recognised as a geographic region since the 1950s, but it was 
only on July 13, 2004 that a report from the provincial Ministry of Public 
Infrastructure Renewal entitled Places to Grow coined the term Greater 
Golden Horseshoe, extending the boundaries west to Waterloo Region, north 
to Barrie/Simcoe County, and northeast to the county and city of Peterborough.[2] 
A subsequent edition released February 16, 2005, broadened the term further, 
adding Brant, Haldimand and Northumberland Counties to the now quasi-administrative 
region. The Greater Golden Horseshoe region is officially designated in 
Ontario Regulation 416/05[3] under the Places to Grow Act. Nearly all the 
cities and counties added to the extended region straddle the Grand River 
to the west and the Trent/Severn river and canal system to the north and 
east; both being waterways that appear to play a role in defining the region 
geographically. Statistics Canada defined the expanded region first in 
its 2001 census as the Extended Golden Horseshoe, combining many Census 
Metropolitan Areas, but excluding areas of the provincially defined region 
that are still mostly rural in nature. The population of the Greater Golden 
Horseshoe was 8.7 million residents at the 2011 census.[1] The region is 
projected to grow to 11.5 million people by 2031.[4] The definition of 
the Golden Horseshoe as an agglomerated urban area, that is combining Census 
Metropolitan Areas is similar to how population counts are tabulated for 
Combined statistical area, which are used in the USA to combine more than 
one metropolitan area, defined as an MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area), 
into a larger overall urbanized area. These metropolitan areas are intrinsically 
linked through inter-dependence of services, trade, transportation corridors, 
close proximity and other factors, in this context they can also be viewed 
as a single region. In 2011, the Greater Horseshoe was the fifth most populous 
greater urbanized area in North America, just behind the Baltimore-DC-Northern 
Virginia CSA. The economy of this region is very diverse. The Toronto Stock 
Exchange is the third largest in North America by market capitalization 
(after the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ), and seventh largest in 
the world.[5] Niagara Falls has one of the world's largest per-capita tourist 
economies, benefiting from millions of tourists coming to see its majestic 
waterfalls, shop in its numerous stores, and visit its many attractions. 
The wine making and fruit growing industries of the Niagara Peninsula produce 
award-winning wines which are beginning to attract attention around the 
world, in particular the ice wine for which the region is known. Cities 
such as Hamilton, Oshawa, Oakville, Whitby and Kitchener all contain major 
large-scale industrial production facilities, Hamilton being steel-dominated 
and Oshawa being much more car-oriented. Other significant automotive-production 
facilities also exist in Brampton, St. Catharines, Cambridge and Alliston. 
Hamilton and Toronto also have two of the largest seaports in Lake Ontario. 
The Welland Canal system handles tanker ship and recreational traffic through 
the Great Lakes. Large rail and truck distribution facilities are located 
in Toronto, Vaughan and Brampton. Food processing is also a key ingredient 
in the economy. While manufacturing remains important to the economy of 
the region, the manufacturing sector has experienced a significant decline 
since 2000 as a result of unfavourable currency exchange rates, increasing 
energy costs, and reduced demand from the USA, which is by far the largest 
market for Ontario's goods. As of 2014, sectors such as IT, health care, 
tourism, research and finance provide the bulk of growth. The suburban 
cities of Brampton, Markham and Mississauga are emerging as technology 
hubs. The "horseshoe" part of the region's name is derived from the characteristic 
horseshoe shape of the west end of Lake Ontario with Cootes Paradise between 
Burlington and Hamilton roughly positioned in the centre. The "golden" 
part is historically attributed to the region's wealth and prosperity, 
according to the Canadian Oxford Dictionary.[citation needed] The full 
phrase, "Golden Horseshoe," was first used by Westinghouse president Herbert 
H. Rogge in a speech to the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce, on January 12, 
1954: Hamilton in 50 years will be the forward cleat in a 'golden horseshoe' 
of industrial development from Oshawa to the Niagara River...150 miles 
long and 50 miles (80 km) wide...It will run from Niagara Falls on the 
south to about Oshawa on the north and take in numerous cities and towns 
already there, including Hamilton and Toronto. The speech writer who actually 
penned the phrase was Charles Hunter MacBain, executive assistant to five 
Westinghouse presidents including Rogge.[7] Toronto is an alpha global 
city, known for its performing arts and night life. Downtown Toronto is 
one of the largest downtowns in North America. The city is pedestrian friendly 
and has one of the lowest crime rates in Canada; the 45 murders committed 
in 2011 is the lowest for a major North American city.[8] Toronto's Yorkville 
is an example of a world-class shopping district in the city. The city 
also is home to several notable shopping malls such as Yorkdale Shopping 
Centre, Toronto Eaton Centre, Scarborough Town Centre, and Sherway Gardens. 
Located in the suburbs of Toronto are Vaughan Mills in Vaughan, Bramalea 
City Centre in Brampton and Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, 
the largest suburban shopping mall in Ontario. Pacific Mall, in Markham, 
is the largest ethnic shopping mall in eastern Canada. Large annual cultural 
festivals that draw tourists and local alike include Oktoberfest in Kitchener 
and the Scotiabank Caribbean Carnival (formerly known as Caribana) in Toronto. 
The Niagara Region has become one of the major wine-production areas in 
Canada. The Golden Horseshoe contains many small towns with tourist-jammed, 
historic main streets, most notably the community of Niagara-on-the-Lake, 
located at the mouth of the Niagara River. Niagara Falls is one of the 
world's largest waterfalls, and attracts millions to Clifton Hill, a neighbourhood 
featuring hundreds of amusements, souvenir stores, restaurants and skyline-changing 
hotels. Casinos here are also a huge draw. The Niagara Escarpment, a world 
biosphere as designated by the United Nations, runs north and then east 
through the region cutting the Niagara Gorge at Niagara Falls. The Bruce 
Trail runs along the escarpment through mostly protected woodlands. The 
Cheltenham Badlands in Caledon is an environmentally degraded area along 
the Niagara Escarpment. Similar protection of some wooded areas exists 
on the Oak Ridges Moraine running east-west in the north end of the Greater 
Toronto Area, although development pressures continue to threaten the natural 
habitat. Hamilton has the historical reputation of being a blue-collar 
city; however, waterfront redevelopments and large-scale gentrification 
have been rapidly changing the perception of the city, although it retains 
a dominant industrial base. Barrie and Peterborough are situated close 
to scenic lakes, rivers and hills in the northern reaches of the Golden 
Horseshoe, where all-year around recreation contributes to the local economies, 
in addition to being major service centres. There are a number of theme 
parks in the Golden Horseshoe, all of which are seasonal. Canada's Wonderland, 
run by Cedar Fair in Vaughan, 2 km (1.2 mi) north of Vaughan Mills, is 
the largest and most attended theme park in Canada. Other theme parks include 
Wild Water Kingdom in Brampton, African Lion Safari in Flamborough (part 
of Hamilton, though geographically closer to Cambridge), and Marineland 
in Niagara Falls. Though not a theme park per se, the Exhibition Place 
hosts the annual Canadian National Exhibition. The Golden Horseshoe is 
home to many professional sports teams, most of which are Toronto-based. 
These teams include: The Golden Horseshoe hosted the 2015 Pan American 
Games and the 2015 Parapan American Games. The Golden Horseshoe is home 
to several universities, many of which are well known and respected throughout 
the world, including the University of Toronto and McMaster University 
in Hamilton, which are ranked 1st and 4th in Canada, respectively, by the 
Academic Ranking of World Universities. Other universities in the region 
include Brock University, University of Guelph, University of Waterloo, 
Wilfrid Laurier University, Trent University, York University, OCAD University, 
Georgian College, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, and Ryerson 
University. There is also a strong integration between the universities 
and hospitals in the area, particularly in Toronto and Hamilton. Both cities 
have an extensive medical research core. The Golden Horseshoe is served 
by an extensive network of expressways, the backbone of which is Highway 
401, one of the widest and busiest expressways in the world. Regional transit 
is provided by GO Transit trains and buses, and by private bus operators 
Greyhound and Coach Canada. Local transit is provided by municipal agencies, 
the largest of which is the Toronto Transit Commission, which operates 
three subway lines and one light metro line and an extensive bus and streetcar 
network. Several cities in the region have approved rapid transit lines 
and would be beginning construction by 2014,[10][11] these include the 
Ion light-rail system in Kitchener-Waterloo and the Hurontario LRT in Mississauga 
and Brampton. Toronto is currently the only city in the area with a rail-based 
local rapid transit network and is planning on a major expansion within 
the decade. The primary airport of the region is Toronto Pearson International 
Airport (officially Lester B. Pearson International Airport), located in 
Mississauga, which is the busiest in Canada and the 33rd busiest in the 
world, handling over 41 million passengers in 2015, and offering non-stop 
flights worldwide. Other regional airports of significance include John 
C. Munro Hamilton International Airport located in southern Hamilton, which 
is a major regional freight and courier location; Buttonville Airport and 
Billy Bishop airport in the Greater Toronto Area, both of which mostly 
serve regional business travellers but the latter being the third largest 
in the region for passenger volume. Within driving distance are Region 
of Waterloo International Airport just east of Kitchener, serving the Region 
of Waterloo and Buffalo Niagara International Airport, near Niagara Falls, 
New York, in the U.S. Buffalo Niagara carries the second largest passenger 
volume in the region, serving 5.5 million passengers in 2008. It is frequently 
used by Canadian passengers flying to U.S. destinations. Population figures
