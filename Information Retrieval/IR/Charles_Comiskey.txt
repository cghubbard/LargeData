As player As manager As Owner Charles Albert "Charlie" Comiskey (August 
15, 1859 – October 26, 1931), also nicknamed "Commy" or "The Old Roman", 
was an American Major League Baseball player, manager and team owner. He 
was a key person in the formation of the American League, and was also 
founding owner of the Chicago White Sox.[1] Comiskey Park, the White Sox' 
storied baseball stadium, was built under his guidance and named for him.[1] 
Comiskey's reputation was permanently tarnished by his team's involvement 
in the Black Sox Scandal, a conspiracy to "throw" the 1919 World Series[1] 
which some have excused by allegations that his poor treatment of White 
Sox players fueled the conspiracy. Comiskey was inducted as an executive 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939.[1] Comiskey was born on August 
15, 1859, in Chicago, the son of Illinois politician John Comiskey. He 
attended public and parochial schools in Chicago, St. Ignatius College 
Prep, and St. Mary's College in Kansas. He played baseball at St. Mary's, 
and played for several professional teams in Chicago while apprenticed 
to a plumber and working at construction jobs including driving a brick 
delivery wagon for the construction crews building the fifth Chicago City 
Hall, which stood from 1873 to 1885. Comiskey started his playing career 
as a pitcher, and moved to first base after developing arm trouble. He 
is credited with being the first to play hitters off of first base, allowing 
him to cover balls hit to more of the infield. He entered the American 
Association in 1882 with the St. Louis Brown Stockings.[2] He managed the 
team during parts of its first seasons and took over full-time in 1885,[2] 
leading the Browns to four consecutive American Association championships 
and a close second in 1889.[citation needed] He also played and managed 
for the Chicago Pirates in the Players' League (1890), the Browns again 
(1891), and the Cincinnati Reds in the National League (1892–94).[3] Comiskey 
left Cincinnati and the majors in fall 1894 to purchase the Western League 
club in Sioux City, Iowa and move it to Saint Paul, Minnesota.[2] He had 
compiled a .264 batting average with 29 home runs, 883 RBI and 419 stolen 
bases. As a manager, he posted an 839-542 record. After five seasons of 
sharing the Twin Cities with another Western League club in Minneapolis, 
Comiskey and his colleagues arranged to share Chicago with the National 
League, whose club (the Chicago Cubs today) played on the West Side. The 
St. Paul Saints moved to the South Side as the White Stockings of the renamed 
American League for the 1900 season. The American League then declared 
itself a major league starting in 1901.[2] As owner of the White Sox from 
1900 until his death in 1931, Comiskey oversaw building Comiskey Park in 
1910 and winning five American League pennants (1900, 1901, 1906, 1917, 
1919) and two World Series (1906, 1917).[2] He lost popularity with his 
players, whose views of him became hateful, and that is seen as a factor 
in the Black Sox scandal, when eight players on the AL champions conspired 
to "throw" the 1919 World Series to the NL champion Cincinnati Reds.[2] 
Comiskey was notoriously stingy (his defenders called him "frugal"), even 
forcing his players to pay to launder their own uniforms.[2] Traci Peterson 
notes that, in an era when professional athletes lacked free agency, the 
White Sox's formidable players had little choice but to accept Comiskey's 
substandard wages. She writes: "Charles Risberg and Claude Williams made 
less than $3,000 a year ($41,015 today). Joe Jackson and George Weaver 
made only $6,000 a year ($82,031 today). Eddie Cicotte had been promised 
a $10,000 ($136,718 today) bonus if he could win 30 games in a season. 
When Cicotte closed in on the 30-game goal, Comiskey had him benched to 
keep him from reaching the mark." [2] Comiskey's stated reason for having 
manager Kid Gleason bench Cicotte was that with the Sox headed for the 
World Series he had to protect his star pitcher's arm (Cicotte ended up 
with a 29-7 record for the 1919 season). In one incident, he promised his 
players a bonus for winning the 1919 pennant — the "bonus" turned out to 
be a case of flat champagne. When the scandal broke late in the 1920 season, 
Comiskey suspended the suspected players, while admitting in the telegram 
he sent to them that he knew this action cost the White Sox a second straight 
pennant. However, he initially defended the accused players and, in an 
unusual display of largesse, provided them with expensive legal representation. 
He ultimately supported baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis' 
decision to ban the implicated White Sox players from further participation 
in professional baseball, knowing full well that Landis' action would permanently 
sideline the core of his team.[2] Indeed, the White Sox promptly tumbled 
into seventh place and would not be a factor in a pennant race again until 
1936, five years after Comiskey's death. Comiskey is sometimes credited 
with the innovation of playing the first base position behind first base 
or inside the foul line, a practice which has since become common.[2] Later 
he had played a large role in the dissolution of the National Commission, 
baseball's former body of authority, following a quarrel with Ban Johnson.[4] 
He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939.[1] Comiskey 
died in Eagle River, Wisconsin in 1931. Comiskey's son J. Louis inherited 
the team but died a few years later. The trustees of his estate were going 
to sell the team, but J. Louis' widow Grace was able to gain control of 
the team and avoid a sale. Her two children, Dorothy Comiskey Rigney and 
Charles Albert Comiskey II (who served in the White Sox front office in 
the 1940s and 1950s before he became owner),[5] became co-owners of the 
team following Grace's death in the 1950s.[4] Dorothy sold controlling 
interest in the team to Bill Veeck in 1958, but Chuck remained a minority
