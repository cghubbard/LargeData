Ricardo "Ricky" Romero, Jr. (born November 6, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is currently in the San Francisco Giants organization. 
He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue 
Jays. After spending three years at Garfield High School, Romero graduated 
from Theodore Roosevelt High School in East Los Angeles. In his senior 
year he was named L.A. City Section co-player of the year and Eastern League 
co-MVP for baseball, going (12–1) with a 0.53 ERA and 162 strikeouts for 
the Rough Riders.[1] Upon graduation, Romero attended Cal State Fullerton 
from 2001 to 2005. The lefty starter helped the Titans capture a National 
Title in the 2004 College World Series, pitching the team into the semifinals 
past Miami (FL) and winning game one of the World Series against Texas. 
He was also selected to the All-Tournament team for that season and played 
for the U.S. National Team pitching to a (3–1) record with a 1.57 ERA. 
In 2005 he led Fullerton in wins (13) and the Titans returned to the World 
Series.[2] Romero was drafted by the Blue Jays as the sixth overall pick 
(and first pitcher selected) in the 2005 amateur entry draft.[3] After 
signing with Toronto in June of that year, with a signing bonus of $2.1 
million, Romero made his professional debut for the Auburn Doubledays of 
the short-season A affiliated New York–Penn League. He was promoted to 
the Class A Dunedin Blue Jays after that appearance. Both 2006 and 2007 
were short, injury-riddled seasons for the southpaw, with Romero suffering 
from shoulder and elbow problems. Finally healthy in 2008, Romero struggled 
with control problems with a career high 55 walks for the Double-A New 
Hampshire Fisher Cats. He received a late year call up to Triple-A Syracuse 
and earned Player of the Week honors as a member of the Chiefs on September 
1.[4] On March 30, 2009, Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston announced that Romero 
had earned one of the two open rotation spots for the 2009 MLB season. 
This came after a strong 7-inning spring training outing against the Houston 
Astros.[5][6] On April 9, Romero made his Major League debut against Detroit, 
opposite Tigers rookie pitcher Rick Porcello. The game marked the first 
time in MLB history that two first-round picks faced each other in their 
respective debuts.[7] Romero earned the win while surrendering two runs 
on seven hits over six innings in the Blue Jays' 6–2 victory.[8] Romero 
pitched strongly in his next two starts, getting a no-decision against 
the Minnesota Twins, and defeating the Oakland Athletics. He had a 2–0 
record and a 1.71 ERA in his first three starts, but was placed on the 
15-day disabled list on April 20 with a strained right oblique muscle after 
a violent sneeze.[9] The Jays, surprising many observers by holding first 
place for the month of April despite many injuries to their key pitchers, 
hoped he would be ready to return to their lineup by mid-May.[10] Romero 
was called up from Triple A Las Vegas 51's along with Casey Janssen, after 
a successful rehab assignment in the minor leagues to evaluate his progress.[11] 
After struggling somewhat upon his return, Romero found an outstanding 
run of form in late June and early July, defeating the World Series champion 
Philadelphia Phillies (June 26),[12] the American League champion Tampa 
Bay Rays (July 1),[13] and the perennial powerhouse New York Yankees (July 
6)[14] in three successive starts. On July 6, Romero tied the Blue Jays 
rookie record for consecutive scoreless innings with 24 against the NY 
Yankees, before giving up a home run to Eric Hinske in the fifth inning.[15] 
Jays' manager Cito Gaston said Romero was by this time considered the team's 
#2 starter, behind Roy Halladay. Romero was rumoured to be one of the leading 
candidates for the 2009 MLB Rookie of the Year award during the first half 
of the season. Others included Chicago White Sox infielders Gordon Beckham 
and Jayson Nix, as well as Detroit Tigers starting pitcher Rick Porcello. 
On April 13, 2010, Romero set a new career high with 12 strikeouts while 
allowing only two runs on one hit over eight innings in a 4–2 victory over 
the Chicago White Sox. On May 15, 2010, Romero pitched his first complete 
game and shutout while tying a career-high 12 strikeouts in a 6–0 victory 
over the Texas Rangers. On June 26, 2011, Romero got his first major league 
hit, a two RBI single to right field, while pitching a complete game shutout 
against the St. Louis Cardinals to complete the sweep.[16] The five runs 
scored by the Jays were a welcome change for Romero, who had received two 
or fewer runs of support in each of his previous eight starts.[17] On July 
10, 2011, Romero was named as a late reserve to the American League All-Star 
Team, just two days before the game. He replaced injured Boston Red Sox 
pitcher Jon Lester, who was replacing Seattle Mariners pitcher Félix Hernández, 
who, because of starting the last game before the All-Star break, was ineligible 
to play in the game.[18] Romero was named the AL Player of the Week for 
the week of August 1–7, 2011.[citation needed] Romero set personal highs 
for a single season with his second shutout and fourth complete game on 
August 18 against the Oakland Athletics.[19] On September 6, Romero was 
named the pitcher of the month for August, after posting a record of 5–0 
in 6 starts. He led the American League in ERA (2.05) and opponents batted 
.160 against him, a major league low for the month.[20] Romero was named 
the opening day starter for the Blue Jays against the Cleveland Indians 
on April 5, 2012.[21] On April 11, 2012, in the fourth inning of a game 
against the Boston Red Sox, Romero recorded his 500th career strikeout 
against outfielder Darnell McDonald. He made his 100th career start on 
May 8, 2012 against the Oakland Athletics, receiving a no-decision. Romero's 
season started out well, and as of June 22, Romero was 8–1 – albeit with 
an ERA of 4.34, nearly a run and a half higher than his previous season's 
ERA of 2.90. The rest of the season, however, was little short of disastrous, 
as in Romero's last 17 appearances (all starts) he went 1–13 with an ERA 
of 7.35. No physical reason appeared to exist for Romero's sudden turn 
in performance, and the Jays kept him in the rotation for the entire season. 
Overall, Romero finished the 2012 season 9–14 with a 5.77 ERA and an MLB-leading 
105 walks issued. Romero had been the starter for the previous two opening 
days for the Blue Jays,[22] but in light of his second-half struggles in 
2012, on February 5, 2013, manager John Gibbons said Romero would be the 
Jays' number 5 starter for the 2013 season. Despite Gibbons' statements 
about Romero's position in the starting rotation, however, on March 26, 
2013, the Blue Jays optioned Romero to the Class-A Advanced Dunedin Blue 
Jays.[23] Romero spent time in an extended spring training camp, and was 
recalled from Dunedin on May 3, 2013, after having pitched only one official 
game in minor league play.[24][25] However, back at the major league level, 
Romero posted an 0–2 record with a 12.46 ERA in two starts. He was subsequently 
optioned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on May 9, 2013.[26][27] Romero 
was then outrighted from the 40-man roster on June 1, 2013 to make room 
for Ramon Ortiz.[28] Romero spent the next several months as a Bison, compiling 
a 5–8 record with a 5.78 ERA over the course of 22 starts.[29] His contract 
was selected by the Blue Jays on September 3 after the Bisons season ended, 
and the major league rosters expanded.[30] He appeared in two games in 
relief for Toronto in September, giving up 3 runs in three innings. Romero's 
overall major league record for the 2013 season was 0–2, with an 11.05 
ERA in 7 1⁄3 innings. Romero was invited to spring training, where he walked 
10 batters over 9 2⁄3 innings. He was sent to minor league camp on March 
19, 2014.[31] In June, he underwent season-ending knee surgery and could 
require a second surgery on his other knee. Up to the surgery, he had posted 
an 0–3 record with a 5.50 ERA and 42 walks through 37 2⁄3 innings pitching 
for the Buffalo Bisons.[32] Romero began the 2015 season on the disabled 
list of the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats. He was released by the 
Blue Jays organization on April 25.[33] On May 9, Romero signed a minor 
league contract with the San Francisco Giants.[34] In four starts in the 
Arizona Rookie league, Romero pitched a 0–2 record, 5.62 ERA, 7 walks, 
and 4 strikeouts in 8 innings.[35] Romero re-signed a minor league contract 
with the Giants on November 23, 2015.[36] After the 2016 season, the Giants 
re-signed Romero to a minor league deal.[37] Romero throws an 87–92 miles 
per hour two-seam fastball, a 92–95 miles per hour four-seam fastball, 
an 82–87 miles per hour changeup, a curveball that ranges from 74–78 miles 
per hour, and lastly an 84–86 miles per hour slider.[38] Romero is of Mexican 
descent,[39] and has a younger brother, Gabriel, who was drafted by the 
Blue Jays in the 47th round of the 2010 amateur draft, as a right-handed 
pitcher.[40] He also has two sisters.[41] He is married to retired Canadian 
soccer player Kara Lang,[42] and they have a son born in September 2015.
