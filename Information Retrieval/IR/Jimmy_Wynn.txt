James Sherman Wynn (born March 12, 1942), nicknamed the "Toy Cannon", is 
a retired American professional baseball player who had a 15-year career 
with the Houston Colt .45s / Astros and four other teams, primarily as 
a center fielder. Wynn's nickname was "the Toy Cannon" because his bat 
had a lot of "pop" for his small size (5 ft 8 in (1.73 m), 170 lb (77 kg)). 
His career started in 1962 when the Cincinnati Reds signed him as an amateur 
free agent. He played that season for the Tampa Tarpons in the Florida 
State League. He played mostly at third base, batting .290 with fourteen 
home runs. After the season, he was drafted by the then Houston Colt .45s 
in the 1962 first-year player draft. Wynn began the 1963 season with the 
Double-A San Antonio Bullets in the Texas League. There, he split his time 
between shortstop and third base while batting .288 with 16 home runs in 
78 games. He was promoted to the major leagues in July, and made his major 
league debut on July 10. Starting at shortstop, he went 1-for-4 with a 
stolen base. He split his time during the rest of the season between shortstop 
and the outfield, most often playing left field. Having struggled defensively 
at shortstop, Wynn was converted to a full-time outfielder in 1964. He 
opened the season as the Colt .45s starting center fielder, but was sent 
back to the minor leagues in June, with Mike White taking over. He was 
called up in September, and finished the season starting in center field. 
A low point for Wynn as an Astro's outfielder came on August 1, 1966 when 
he broke his left arm crashing into the outfield wall at Connie Mack Stadium 
chasing down a Dick Allen fly ball that resulted in a game-winning, inside-the-park 
home run for Allen and the Philadelphia Phillies in the bottom of the 10th 
inning.[1][2][3][4][5] The injury ended his season.[6] Wynn was a fixture 
in the Astros' outfield through 1973. A power hitter, it has been speculated 
that he may have lost a substantial number of home runs to the lengthy 
fences in the Astrodome. After his career-high 37 home runs in 1967 were 
edged out by Hank Aaron's 39 in the final days of the season, Aaron, whose 
Atlanta Braves played their home games in the more homer-friendly Atlanta–Fulton 
County Stadium, commented that he considered Wynn the season's home run 
champion.[7] Perhaps Wynn's most famous home run came on June 10 of that 
1967 season at Crosley Field. The shot, which came in the eighth inning 
of the Astros' 8–3 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, cleared the 58-foot scoreboard 
in left-center field and bounced onto Interstate 75 outside the stadium. 
Five days later, Wynn became the first Astro to hit three home runs in 
one game as the Astros defeated the San Francisco Giants 6–2 at the Astrodome. 
After being traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Claude Osteen before 
the 1974 season, he helped the Dodgers win the National League pennant 
by batting .271 with 32 home runs and 108 RBI and earning the Sporting 
News Comeback Player of the Year Award. In the 1974 National League Championship 
Series, Wynn had just 2 hits in 10 at-bats, but walked nine times and scored 
four runs in the four-game win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. In the 1974 
World Series, Wynn went 3-for-16 with his only postseason home run (coming 
off Rollie Fingers in the 9th inning of Game One) in a losing cause. Wynn 
started off 1975 well, but a bad shoulder injury limited his effectiveness 
at the plate and making throws from center field. He had to move to left 
field, and was traded by the Dodgers to the Atlanta Braves for Dusty Baker. 
He spent the final year of his career (1977) mainly as a designated hitter 
for the New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers. His number 24 was retired 
by the Astros on June 25, 2005, when the Astros played the Texas Rangers. 
Jason Lane, who wore Wynn's 24 before the ceremony, changed his number 
to 16 as a result. Wynn previously served as a post-game analyst on Houston 
Astros television broadcasts on FSN Houston. He also serves as a community 
outreach executive for the team. Wynn was a player who walked a lot, giving 
him a very high on-base percentage. Moreover, he played in the 1960s, a 
low run-scoring era, as well as in the Astrodome, a low run-scoring park. 
This has led to many statistical analysts (or proponents of sabermetrics) 
to argue that Wynn was a very underrated player who may even deserve induction
