Bradley Wayne Penny (born May 24, 1978) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. Penny played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida 
/ Miami Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, San Francisco Giants, 
St. Louis Cardinals, and Detroit Tigers, and in Nippon Professional Baseball 
for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. He was an All Star in 2006 and 2007. Penny 
was born in Blackwell, Oklahoma.[1] He graduated from Broken Arrow Senior 
High where he was an All-State selection and Frontier Conference Pitcher 
of the Year. He was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 5th round 
of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft, and signed with the Diamondbacks 
on June 4, 1996. He was immediately sent to the Arizona Summer League, 
where he ranked fourth in the league in ERA (2.36) and was named Arizona's 
Organizational Pitcher of the Month in August. With the South Bend Silver 
Hawks in 1997, he was 10–5 with an ERA of 2.73 in 25 starts. In 1998, with 
the High Desert Mavericks, he went 14–5 with a 2.96 ERA in 28 starts and 
was named to Baseball America's first team Minor League All-Stars, the 
California League Pitcher of the Year, California League Most Valuable 
Player, Arizona Diamondbacks Minor League Player of the Year and "A" Level 
Player of the Year. In 1999, he started the year with the El Paso Diablos 
at the Diamondbacks Double-A level, and had a 2–7 record with a 4.80 ERA 
when he was traded to the Florida Marlins along with Abraham Núñez and 
Vladimir Núñez in exchange for relief pitcher Matt Mantei. The Marlins 
assigned him to their Double-A team in Portland. Penny combined with Luis 
Arroyo for the first no-hitter in Portland history in his first game in 
the Marlins' organization on August 8. After a good spring, he made the 
Marlins starting rotation in 2000. He made his first major league appearance 
and first start on April 7, 2000, against the Colorado Rockies. Penny pitched 
seven innings, giving up only one run, to get his first win in the Marlins' 
4–3 victory. At the end of the season, he ranked second among NL rookies 
in winning percentage (.533), third in wins, tied for fourth with 22 games 
started and was sixth in both innings pitched ( 119 2⁄3) and strikeouts 
(80).[2] In 2001, Penny pitched 205 innings for the Marlins. He finished 
10-10 in 31 starts. In 2002, due to injuries and ineffectiveness, Penny 
saw his ERA rise from the previous season, from 3.69 in 2001, his ERA in 
2002 was at 4.66 in just 24 starts. In 2003, Penny bounced back, finishing 
the 2003 campaign with 14 wins for the Marlins and helping them reach the 
playoffs. Penny collected the win in Florida's NLCS clinching victory over 
the Chicago Cubs and in the World Series against the New York Yankees he 
went 2–0 with a 2.19 ERA in his two starts. Penny started the 2004 season 
with a 8-8 record with a 3.15 ERA in 21 starts before being traded to the 
Dodgers. On July 30, 2004, Penny was traded along with Hee-Seop Choi and 
pitching prospect Bill Murphy to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for 
Guillermo Mota, Juan Encarnación, and Paul Lo Duca.[3] However, in the 
first inning of his second start with the Dodgers he suffered a serious 
arm injury and went on the disabled list.[4] He returned in September, 
only to promptly reinjure himself after three innings in his first start 
off the DL. His recovery time from his injury caused him to begin the following 
season on the disabled list, but he rejoined the Dodgers on April 24, 2005, 
and proceeded to have a solid season. On June 12, 2005, Penny signed a 
three-year contract extension worth a guaranteed $25 million and a team 
option for the 2009 season.[5] Penny was named by Houston Astros manager 
Phil Garner as the National League's starting pitcher in the 2006 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game. He hurled two innings, allowing one home 
run to Vladimir Guerrero, striking out the side (Ichiro Suzuki, Derek Jeter, 
and David Ortiz) in the first inning, and receiving a no-decision.[6] On 
September 23, 2006, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Penny joined the 
small club of pitchers who have struck out four batters in one inning. 
Due to the uncaught third strike rule, Penny was credited with striking 
out Chad Tracy, but because catcher Russell Martin failed to catch the 
ball cleanly, Tracy was allowed to attempt to run to first base, and made 
it there before he could be thrown out. Despite giving up three runs in 
the inning, Penny recorded three more strikeouts to complete the four-strikeout 
inning. He also threw the fastest fastball of all NL starters in 2006, 
averaging 93.9 miles per hour.[7] Penny had a strong start to 2007 that 
continued throughout the season, with an ERA of 3.03 for the season and 
was the first Dodger pitcher to start out with a 12–1 record since Phil 
Regan went 14–1 in 1966. Penny was selected to the All-Star game for a 
second consecutive year. Penny had several memorable outings in 2007, including 
on May 7, 2007, against his former team, the Florida Marlins, Penny struck 
out a career-high 14 in a Dodger 6–1 win. Another memorable performance 
was against the San Diego Padres in a pitcher's duel against All-Star teammate 
Jake Peavy just before the All-Star break. The match ended in a draw with 
both pitchers going seven innings giving up one earned run on five hits. 
Penny struck out seven, while Peavy struck out six. The Padres would eventually 
win the game 3–1 in 12 innings. He also threw the fastest fastball of all 
NL starters in 2007, averaging 93.4 miles per hour.[7] Besides being a 
hard throwing pitcher, Penny has developed into a good hitting pitcher 
since being traded to the Dodgers. In 2006, his batting average was .185, 
but was above .200 for most of the season and was as high as .240 before 
Penny ended the year in an 0 for 12 slump. He batted .246 in 2007. Penny 
also had six doubles, seven RBI, and seven runs scored. For the 2008 season, 
Penny was selected as opening day starter against the San Francisco Giants, 
shutting them out over seven innings, but he struggled in 2008 overall, 
going 6–9 with a 6.27 ERA and a stint on the DL. After coming back from 
the DL in September, Penny made a few appearances out of the bullpen but 
struggled in that role and returned to the DL. After the season, the Dodgers 
declined his option year, making Penny a free agent. On January 9, 2009, 
Penny signed a one-year deal with the Boston Red Sox with a base salary 
of $5M. Incentives and performance bonuses were included to increase the 
total deal another $3M.[8][9][10] Penny recorded his 100th career win on 
June 17, 2009, against his former team the Florida Marlins, in a five inning 
effort only giving up one unearned run. The win came on the Red Sox's 500th 
consecutive sell out at Fenway Park. During his last five starts with the 
Red Sox, Penny was 0–4 with a 9.11 ERA. After a disastrous start against 
the rival Yankees, it was decided on August 22, 2009, that Penny would 
be replaced in the rotation by veteran knuckleballer Tim Wakefield who 
was coming off the disabled list soon. During Wakefield's August 26 start, 
Penny was placed in the bullpen as insurance, but was never needed with 
Wakefield pitching a strong seven inning effort giving up only one run. 
With Wakefield completing a healthy start, reliever Billy Wagner being 
added to the roster, and Penny not wanting to be a reliever, the Red Sox 
granted his wish to be released late that night. During his time in Boston, 
Penny's record was 7–8, with a 5.61 ERA.[11] On August 31, 2009, Penny 
signed with the San Francisco Giants after clearing waivers. The Giants 
paid Penny only the pro-rated remnant of a $400k MLB minimum salary (i.e. 
under $100k), with the Boston Red Sox picking up the remainder of his $5M 
salary for the year. [12][13] In his debut, Penny pitched eight shutout 
innings in a 4–0 win over Philadelphia. Penny demonstrated his past success 
in the National League, going 4-1 in 6 starts for the Giants. He became 
a free agent after the season. On December 10, 2009, Penny agreed to a 
one-year contract with the St. Louis Cardinals.[14] On May 21, 2010, Penny 
hit his first career grand slam, to give his team an 8–4 lead during interleague 
play against the Angels. He was pulled the next inning with an injury and 
therefore did not earn the win. The injury was an aggravation of a pre-existing 
oblique muscle strain that landed him on the disabled list for the remainder 
of the season. On January 18, 2011, Penny agreed to a one-year $3 million 
contract with the Detroit Tigers.[15] Being added to the Tigers roster 
reunited Penny with past teammates in Miguel Cabrera from the Marlins and 
Victor Martinez from the Red Sox. Penny started off the season with the 
Tigers as their number two starter, behind Justin Verlander and in front 
of Max Scherzer. In exception to May, in which Penny went 3–1 in five starts 
with an ERA of 3.24, Penny had a sub-par first half of the season, going 
6–6 with an 4.50 ERA, and with the Tigers' acquisition of Doug Fister in 
July, in addition to the success of Scherzer, Penny was moved to the number 
four spot in the rotation. Penny had a worse second half, going 5–5 with 
a 6.53 ERA after the All-Star break. When the Tigers went to the Postseason, 
he was added to the roster in the bullpen. He appeared in Game 6 of the 
American League Championship Series against the Texas Rangers, his only 
appearance in both the Division and Championship series, and pitched 1.2 
innings while giving up 5 runs. The Tigers went on to lose that game 15–5, 
which sent the Rangers to the World Series. The Rangers lost in 7 games 
to Penny's former club, the St. Louis Cardinals. On February 5, 2012, Penny 
agreed to a one-year $3 million contract with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks.[16] 
However, after allowing six runs and five stolen bases in only 3 1⁄3 innings 
in his debut game, Penny claimed that he injured his elbow and asked to 
be removed from the game. He was immediately sent to the disabled list 
and took two MRI exams (one in Fukuoka,[17] and one in the United States[18]), 
but both results were negative. Penny was released from his contract a 
month later, on May 8.[19] He was a "huge disappointment,[20]" and local 
newspaper reported that signing Penny was "the worst decision in franchise 
history.[21]" On May 18, 2012, Penny signed a minor league contract with 
the San Francisco Giants.[22] On June 30, Penny faced the Cincinnati Reds 
in his first game of the season.[23] He went 2.1 innings, giving up 0 hits 
and 0 earned runs while striking out 1 batter. He finished the season 0-1 
with a 6.11 ERA while appearing in 22 games. Penny signed a minor league 
deal with the Kansas City Royals on January 16, 2014.[24] He was released 
on March 7.[25] On June 18, 2014, Penny agreed to a minor-league contract 
with the Miami Marlins.[26] He made his first start with the club on August 
9, 2014, against the Cincinnati Reds. On December 16, 2014, Penny signed 
a minor league deal with the Chicago White Sox.[27] After a mixed spring 
training in 2015 (1-1 record with a 6.89 ERA in 15.2 innings),[28] he failed 
to win a spot in Chicago's rotation and played with their Triple-A affiliate, 
the Charlotte Knights, in the International League. He elected free agency 
on November 6, 2015.[29] On December 17, 2015, Penny signed a minor league 
contract with the Toronto Blue Jays that included an invitation to spring 
training.[30] On March 18, 2016, Penny announced his retirement.[31] In 
October 2009, Penny began dating professional dancer Karina Smirnoff. They 
became engaged in October 2010,[32] but ended the engagement in December 
2011.[33] Penny subsequently began dating former Oklahoma City Thunder 
dancer Kaci Cook. They became engaged in January 2013, and married on August
