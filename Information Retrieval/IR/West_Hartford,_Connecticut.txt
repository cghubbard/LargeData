West Hartford is a town located in Hartford County, Connecticut, United 
States. Located 5 miles (8.0 km) west of downtown Hartford, is an upmarket 
inner-ring suburb located in Greater Hartford. The population was 63,268 
at the 2010 census.[1] The town is known for its popular downtown area 
colloquially known as "West Hartford Center," or simply "The Center," which 
is centered on Farmington Avenue and South/North Main Street. West Hartford 
Center has been the community's main hub since the late 17th century. In 
2008, Blue Back Square opened as a new addition to the central area.[2] 
Blue Back includes a bookstore, a movie theater, two parking garages, various 
physician and medical offices, and several restaurants. Incorporated as 
a town in 1854, the town was previously a parish of Hartford. Among the 
southernmost of the communities encompassed within the Hartford-Springfield 
Knowledge Corridor metropolitan region, West Hartford is home to University 
of Hartford and the University of Saint Joseph. In 2010, Kiplinger's Personal 
Finance magazine listed West Hartford as one of the nation's "10 Great 
Cities for Raising Families."[3] In 2010, Kiplinger's ranked West Hartford 
#9 on its "10 Best Cities for the Next Decade" list.[4] In 2010, CNN Money 
ranked West Hartford as the 55th best small city in America.[5] In 2010, 
the national online magazine Travelandleisure.com cited West Hartford as 
one of 10 "coolest" suburbs in the nation. The magazine called the West 
Hartford Reservoir off Farmington Avenue "West Hartford's version of Central 
Park,"[6] and it also noted the town's "vacation-worthy hot spots, with 
cutting-edge restaurants, great shopping, and plenty of parking."[7] According 
to new archaeological evidence, the Wampanoag people used West Hartford 
as one of their winter camps. Fishing and hunting along the Connecticut 
River, the area of West Hartford offered the Wampanoag people a refuge 
from the cold winter wind and the river's severe spring flooding. In 1636 
Reverend Thomas Hooker led a group of followers from what is now Cambridge, 
Massachusetts to the "Great River" and eventually established the Hartford 
Colony. As the colony grew, additional land was needed. In 1672 the Proprietors 
of Hartford ordered that a Division be created to the West. A total of 
"72 Long Lots" were laid out between today's Quaker Lane in the East and 
Mountain Road in the West. The northern boundary was Bloomfield, and the 
Southern, present day New Britain Avenue. (The western boundary was extended 
in 1830 to include part of Farmington). In the 1670s the area was referred 
to as the "West Division" of Hartford. This remained the official name 
until 1806 when Connecticut General Assembly started referring to it as 
"the Society of West Hartford." It is believed that the first homesteader 
to West Hartford was Stephen Hosmer whose father was in Hooker's first 
group of Hartford settlers and who later owned 300 acres (1,200,000 m2) 
just north of the present day Center. In 1679, Stephen Hosmer's father 
sent him to establish a sawmill on the property. Young Hosmer would eventually 
go back to live in Hartford, but in his 1693 estate inventory, 310 acres 
(1,300,000 m2) in West Hartford along with a house and a sawmill are listed. 
For nearly a century the property would be handed down throughout the family. 
Evidence still remains of the Town's first industry, as Stephen Hosmer's 
mill pond and dam can still be found today on the westernmost side of North 
Main Street. By the time of the American Revolution, the once rugged wilderness 
had been largely clear and a new agricultural-based community had developed 
with a population of just over 1,000 residents and 3,000 sheep. At its 
core was the parish meeting house. The First Congregational Meeting House 
was built around 1712 and still stands proudly today at what is now the 
northwest corner of Main Street and Farmington Avenue. As the focus of 
early religious, political, and social life, the meeting house helped to 
provide this area with a name, a title that it still holds today – "The 
Center." Evidence in the Hartford Courant and in the 1790s census show 
that some of the more prosperous households relied on laborers and slaves 
for fieldwork and domestic help. The Sarah Whitman Hooker House was one 
such residence and still stands on New Britain Avenue. Evidence shows that 
the Hookers owned several slaves. One such slave, Bristow, bought his freedom 
in 1775 to fight in the Revolutionary War. slave for whom one of West Hartford's 
middle schools is named, Bristow bought his freedom from Thomas Hart Hooker 
in April 1775 as Hooker set off to fight in the Revolutionary War. Bristow 
continued to live with the family after Thomas Hart Hooker was killed in 
the war. Bristow became an agricultural expert and left his property to 
the Hookers' two children when he died. He is the only known African American 
to be buried in West Hartford's Old Center Burial Yard.[8] One of the first 
major industries to arise centered on the pottery and brick works. Extending 
from Hartford to Berlin is a sizable deposit of fine clay. In 1770, Ebenezer 
Faxon came from Massachusetts and settled in what would become the Elmwood 
section of West Hartford. There he established a pottery on South Road 
(what is today New Britain Avenue) which took advantage of the local geological 
landscape. It was Seth Goodwin, however, who helped to establish a pottery 
dynasty. Goodwin started his pottery works around 1798. For over a hundred 
years, the Goodwin name would be associated with West Hartford pottery. 
Producing utilitarian items such as jugs for the gin manufactured in local 
distilleries, to terra cotta designs and fine china, the Goodwin Company 
employed up to 75 people in its heyday. The Goodwin Brothers Pottery Company 
(as it came to be known) burned for the third time in 1908 and never recovered.[1 
1] In 1879 Edwin Arnold established the Trout Brook Ice & Feed Company. 
Ice from Trout Brook, a stream that runs through the middle of West Hartford, 
was harvested in the winter, sawn into blocks, and placed into a series 
of ice houses through an escalator system. Insulated in sawdust, the blocks 
of ice were used as refrigeration locally and shipped as far away as New 
York City. By the late 19th century, the New York, New Haven & Hartford 
Railroad ran through part of Elmwood in the southeast corner of town. A 
variety of companies cropped up in this area including Whitlock Coil Pipe 
Company in 1891, and later Royal Typewriter, Wiremold, Abbot Ball, Colt's 
Manufacturing and Uncle Bill's Silver Grippers (producer of tweezers). 
The largest of West Hartford manufacturers was Pratt & Whitney. In 1940 
it built a plant on 20 acres (81,000 m2) and at the height of World War 
II it employed over 7,000 people. It would stand until 1991, when Pratt 
& Whitney was acquired and operations were relocated to Plainville[9] In 
1792 a committee of residents was appointed to ask permission from Hartford 
to secede, and were denied. Five years later they petitioned again and 
again were denied. In the spring of 1854, the Connecticut General Assembly 
was meeting in New Haven (co-capitol with Hartford at the time). Most likely 
taking advantage of the distance from Hartford, a petition dated March 
21 was delivered to the General Assembly by delegates from West Hartford. 
Signed by 153 residents, the petition claimed that residences were "subjected 
to many inconveniences on account of their present connection with the 
town and city of Hartford and that their convenience and prosperity would 
be essentially promoted by being set off as a separate town." On April 
26, about 100 residents from West Hartford presented their own case against 
secession. After review and an opportunity for Hartford to make an argument 
for keeping West Hartford, the General Assembly voted on May 3 for West 
Hartford's independence. The 1854 vote was not however the end of the debate. 
In 1895 wealthy residents from the "East Side" of West Hartford petitioned 
Hartford for annexation. Their call was rebuffed by other West Hartford 
residents. Then in 1923 and 1924 Hartford wanted to annex West Hartford 
back so that it could achieve a "Greater Hartford Plan." Town residents 
rallied in opposition and the plan was defeated by a vote of 2,100 to 6137.[10] 
It is transportation that has had the biggest impact on West Hartford and 
its evolution from sleepy crossroads to modern suburb. In the late 18th 
and early 19th century three turnpikes ran through West Hartford. Around 
these roads, taverns, blacksmith and wheelwright shops, general stores 
and many other places of businesses sprang up. Early maps provide a sense 
of how important these byways were in the development of commerce and industry. 
Then came the trolleys – starting in 1845, Fred Brace began running a horse-drawn 
omnibus from his home on the corner of Farmington Avenue and Dale Street 
into downtown Hartford. Even more significant were the horse-drawn trolley 
lines and later electric trolleys that in 1889 began to weave their way 
from the inner city of Hartford to the countryside of West Hartford. Trolley 
lines opened up a land that had been inaccessible to many, and made it 
possible for professionals and their families to settle along Prospect 
Avenue, then north of Farmington Avenue. By the 1880s, Hartford began to 
experience an economic boom. As such Hartford’s business leaders began 
building their mansions along Prospect Avenue. Prospect Hill, situated 
on a mile-long ridge boasting impressive views of the burgeoning city, 
became the area's most prestigious address. Homes are characteristic of 
the architectural styles popular in that period are represented, particularly 
Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals. Many homes in the area on the National 
Register of Historic Places, including the Connecticut Governor's Residence, 
built in 1908. Prospect Avenue is adjacent to Hartford, designed by acclaimed 
landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted in 1896 and named for the wife 
of Governor Charles H. Pond, who bequeathed the land to the City of Hartford. 
In 1900, the Hartford Golf Club opened its links on the other side of Asylum 
Avenue just west of Prospect Avenue, adding to the area's ideal suburban 
sensibility.[11] In 1895, Wood, Harmon and Company created one of the town's 
first subdivisions on property known as Stanley Farm, a tract sloping upward 
from the trolley line that then ran along Farmington Avenue, across from 
Reservoir No. 1. Called Buena Vista, it was promoted it "Hartford's New 
and Handsome Suburb." Their literature highlighted "splendid suburban electric 
car service" and proximity to Reservoir No. 1.[12] Other developments followed 
including "Elmhurst" in Elmwood (1901), and Sunset Farm (1917). One of 
the most exclusive of these early developments was West Hill. Located on 
the former estate of Cornelius Vanderbilt, son of the famous financier 
and transportation magnet, it was the brainchild of Horace R. Grant. Designed 
by some of Hartford's best architects in the 1920s, West Hill is significant 
historically because it is an excellent example of a planned real estate 
development of the early 1920s that proceeded under specific design restrictions 
to achieve outstanding success as a well-crafted and prestigious neighborhood. 
The architecture is characteristic of the Colonial Revival and Tudor Revival 
styles popular in the period. It was declared a National Historic District 
in 1996.[13] By the 1920s and 30s the impact of the automobile was felt 
in West Hartford as the town became more accessible to Hartford's middle 
and working class citizens. Between 1910 and 1930 the population of West 
Hartford grew from 4,808 to 24,941 residents. Then with the end of the 
Great Depression, World War II, and the exodus from urban centers, West 
Hartford witnessed a tremendous influx of people as its population swelled 
from 33,776 in 1940 to 62,382 people by 1960. This era ushered in major 
housing developments and retail spaces throughout the community. In the 
50s, the primary avenues — Albany, Asylum and Farmington — became important 
arteries for commuters, and the access made West Hartford attractive to 
middle-class families. During the decade, the town built one new elementary 
school each year to accommodate the growing population. In the 1960s, construction 
began on Interstate 84, completed in 1969. The interstate had many ramifications 
on the community, the most visible was that it bisected the town, isolating 
the more industrial and ethnically diverse neighborhood of Elmwood with 
a physical barrier from the rest of West Hartford.[14] Furthermore, The 
interstate allowed for increased accessibility as the population increased 
with the Baby Boom and development, and recalibrated the traditional retail 
sites. Subsequent residential development continued on through the late 
'70s, particularly in the town's northern, western and far southwestern 
fringes, as evidenced by the many large ranch, colonial and split level-style 
homes in these areas. In 1971, the Bishops Corner development was inaugurated. 
Housing tenants such as Lord & Taylor, F.W. Woolworth, and Doubleday Book 
Shop drew shoppers from across the region; the Center with its largely 
independently owned stores, were negatively impacted by the new retail 
traffic patterns.[15] Towards the town's southwest fringe lies Westfarms 
Mall. Opened in 1974 with original anchors JC Penney, G. Fox & Co., and 
Sage-Allen, the mall further recalibrated retail in West Hartford. It became 
well known for its lavish ceilings and waterfall-style fountain. Sitting 
astride I-84, conveniently connected to the town’s main internal arteries, 
and comprising more than 1,300,000 square feet (120,000 m2) of stores and 
restaurants, it is the third largest indoor mall in Connecticut.[16] In 
recent years, large areas of the community have gone through significant 
transformations. Opening in 2007, Blue Back Square was a pioneer mixed-use 
development in the Center that blended retail and residential living space 
on a large scale. The five-building complex contains 220,000 square feet 
(20,000 m2) of ground floor retail space and 120 luxury space. Medical 
office space encompasses 137,000 square feet (12,700 m2), and other professional 
offices will total another 62,500 square feet (5,810 m2) square feet. A 
six-screen movie theatre as well as two 500-space parking garages were 
also built.[17] Named after Noah Webster's popular spelling book, Blue-Back 
Speller, the development has significantly altered the Center and furthered 
West Hartford's status as a regional dining and shopping destination.[18] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area 
of 22.3 square miles (57.7 km2), of which 21.9 square miles (56.6 km2) 
is land and 0.42 square miles (1.1 km2), or 1.91%, is water.[1] The west 
side of West Hartford is flanked by the Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous 
trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to nearly the 
Vermont border. Notable features of the Metacomet Ridge in West Hartford 
include Talcott Mountain and a number of highland water reservoirs belonging 
to the Metropolitan District, which maintains watershed and recreation 
resources on the property. The 51-mile-long (82 km) Metacomet Trail traverses 
the ridge. The town's web site indicates that the highest point in town 
is 778 feet (237 m) above sea level on Talcott (Avon) Mountain. The altitude 
at Town Hall is 120 feet (37 m). West Hartford is adjacent to and west 
of Hartford, the state capital, and borders Bloomfield, Newington, New 
Britain, Farmington, and Avon. West Hartford is approximately 100 miles 
(160 km) southwest of Boston and 120 miles (190 km) northeast of New York 
City. Interstate 84 runs through West Hartford. As of the 2010 Census,[23] 
there were 63,268 people, 25,258 households, and 16,139 families residing 
in the town. The population density was 2,888.9 people per square mile

line, including 5.3% of those under the age of 18 and 9.6% ages 65 or older. 
West Hartford has been governed via the council–manager government since 
1919. West Hartford was the first town in the state and one of the first 
in the country to adopt this form of government where the council acts 
as the elected policy board and the town manager serves as the chief executive 
officer responsible for carrying out the policies of the council. Town 
Council members are elected at large for two years and represent all of 
West Hartford and the town clerk is elected for four years. Elected by 
the Town Council in 2008, Ronald F. Van Winkle is the Town Manager.[25] 
Connecticut municipalities (like those of neighboring states Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island) provide nearly all local services (such as fire and rescue, 
education, snow removal, etc.), as county government has been abolished 
since 1960.[26] Bradley International Airport, in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, 
is twenty minutes north of downtown Hartford. It features over 150 daily 
departures to over 30 destinations on nine airlines. Other airports serving 
the Hartford area include:[27] Although Amtrak does not currently serve 
West Hartford directly, the town center is located approximately 5 miles 
(8.0 km) west of Hartford's Union Station. Additionally, West Hartford 
is a planned stop along the Hartford Line, a commuter rail service from 
New Haven to Springfield that will use the current Amtrak line, with a 
possible shuttle bus connection in Windsor Locks for Bradley International 
Airport. As of December 2015, funding has been secured to finance the construction 
of the new line, with service scheduled to begin in early 2018.[28] The 
State of Connecticut has secured funding for the construction of a new 
train station at Flatbush Ave, at the corner of Flatbush Avenue and New 
Park Avenue.[29] In March 2015, CTfastrak, Connecticut's first bus rapid 
transit corridor opened, providing a separated right-of-way between Hartford 
and New Britain.[30] West Hartford is served by two stations: West Hartford 
is served by several bus routes of Connecticut Transit. Major roads served 
are Albany Avenue (Route 58), New Britain Avenue (Routes 37, 39, and 128), 
Park Street (Routes 31 and 33), South/North Main Street (Route 153) Farmington 
Avenue (Routes 60, 62, 64, and 66), Asylum Avenue (Route 72), Hillside 
Avenue (Route 63), and Boulevard/South Quaker Lane (Route 69). I-84, which 
runs from Scranton, to its intersection with I-90 in Sturbridge, just over 
the Massachusetts border passing through West Hartford. In addition, Hartford 
is served by the following: According to the town's 2010 Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report,[31] the top employers in the city are: In 2006 
Money magazine ranked West Hartford as the 10th most educated town in the 
United States, as measured by the percentage of town residents holding 
graduate or professional degrees.[32] Connecticut Magazine 2006 rankings 
put West Hartford Public School education in the top three among all cities 
and towns in Connecticut for its population class of greater than 50,000 
people, behind only Greenwich and Fairfield.[33] The town is home to two 
public high schools, Conard High School (home of the Conard Chieftains) 
and Hall High School (home of the Hall Warriors), as well as 11 elementary 
schools and three middle schools in the West Hartford Public Schools. The 
elementary schools are Aiken, Braeburn, Bugbee, Charter Oak, Duffy, Morley, 
Norfeldt, Smith, Webster Hill, Whiting Lane and Wolcott. The three middle 
schools are King Philip, Sedgwick, and the newest, Bristow Middle School, 
located where Kingswood-Oxford Middle School was formerly located. The 
eleven elementary schools are evenly distributed to either King Philip 
or Sedgwick, and those that enroll at Bristow are chosen by lottery. After 
middle school, students continue onto high school with their same student 
body. Those at Sedgwick go on to Conard High School, while those at King 
Philip go to Hall High School, and students at Bristow return to the same 
school district they were in during elementary school. Institutions of 
higher learning located in town include the following colleges and universities:
