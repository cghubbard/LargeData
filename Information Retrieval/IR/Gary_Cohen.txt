Gary Cohen (born April 29, 1958, in Queens, New York) is an American sportscaster, 
best known as a radio and television play-by-play announcer for the New 
York Mets of Major League Baseball. Cohen currently calls Mets broadcasts 
for SportsNet New York and WPIX and Seton Hall basketball games on WABC. 
Cohen graduated with a political science degree in 1981 from Columbia University, 
where he began his broadcasting career with WKCR Sports. While at Columbia, 
he announced soccer games with future presidential adviser and Good Morning 
America host George Stephanopoulos.[1] Prior to joining the Mets' broadcast 
team in 1989, Cohen worked as the voice of the minor league Spartanburg 
Spinners (1983–1984), Durham Bulls (1986), and Pawtucket Red Sox (1987–1988).[2] 
He also called ice hockey and basketball games for Providence College from 
1988 to 1989, and football for Brown University in 1987.[2] Along with 
his work with the Mets, Cohen has also called postseason MLB games for 
ESPN Radio and CBS Radio.[2] In addition to his baseball duties, Cohen 
has called men's college basketball games for many years, starting with 
his duties with St. John's on WFAN, whom he broadcast from 1995 to 2002.[2] 
Following WFAN's loss of the radio rights to St. John's games, Cohen began 
broadcasting Seton Hall games, which he continues to do to this day. He 
also served as a backup announcer on New York Rangers radio broadcasts, 
called Olympic hockey at the 1992, 1994, and 1998 Winter Olympics, and 
NCAA tournament games for Westwood One on multiple occasions.[2] Cohen 
has called many great moments in Mets history, such as Todd Pratt's walk-off 
home run in Game 4 of the 1999 NLDS that won the Mets the series, Robin 
Ventura's "grand slam single" in Game 5 of the 1999 NLCS, Benny Agbayani's 
walk off home run in Game 3 of the 2000 NLDS, the Mets winning the 2000 
NLCS to advance to the World Series, Endy Chavez's home run robbing catch 
in Game 7 of the 2006 NLCS, Johan Santana's no-hitter on June 1, 2012, 
the first in Mets history, Wilmer Flores' walk-off homerun against the 
Washington Nationals on July 31, 2015, the Mets' win against the Cinncinati 
Reds on September 26, 2015 to clinch the National League East, and Bartolo 
Colón's first Major League Baseball home run on May 7, 2016, at which he 
became the oldest MLB player in history to hit his first home run. Cohen's 
signature radio phrases, which he has carried over to television, include: 
His trademark opening for 1st pitch thrown is *"[Player Name] takes first 
pitch (or swings at, or hits) and we're under way" - Starts every game 
this way. He is known for his vivid and succinct description of the game 
action, his smooth baritone voice, corny joking with former broadcast partner 
Howie Rose, and his sometimes biting, but always well-informed baseball 
commentary. In 2003, Cohen became the Mets' lead radio voice following 
the retirement of Bob Murphy. In October 2006, during the Mets' postseason 
run, Cohen returned to the WFAN booth with Rose and newcomer Tom McCarthy 
for a couple of innings each game; he was behind the microphone for Endy 
Chávez's miraculous catch in Game 7 of the NLCS which the Mets lost. It 
was announced on November 9, 2005, that Cohen would become the play-by-play 
announcer for the new Mets cable television network, SportsNet New York 
(SNY). As part of the agreement, Cohen also calls about 25 Mets games per 
year on WPIX along with analysts (and former Mets) Ron Darling and Keith 
Hernandez. On June 1, 2012, Cohen called the first no-hitter in Mets history, 
thrown by Johan Santana. On July 31, 2015, two days after shortstop Wilmer 
Flores was nearly traded to the Brewers for Carlos Gomez, Flores hit a 
dramatic walk-off home run in the 12th inning against the first place Nationals. 
That game, and home run, were widely considered to be the turning point 
of the 2015 season for the Mets as they went on to win their first National 
League East title since 2006. The Nationals, meanwhile, collapsed and finished 
in second place, 7 games behind New York. On September 26, 2015, Cohen 
called the Mets' 10-2 win against the Cinncinati Reds where the Mets clinched 
the National League East for the first time since 2006. On May 7, 2016, 
Cohen called Bartolo Colón's first Major League home run to become the 
oldest player in MLB history to hit his first Major League home run. Cólon's 
previous at-bats with the Mets were extremely entertaining for the fans 
and announcers alike. He would regularly receive standing ovations from 
the fans in attendance when his name was announced to bat over the loud 
speaker. Whenever he swung the bat, he would swing with such force that 
his batting helmet would often fly off in the process. Finally, 17 days 
before his 43rd birthday, he hit his 1st Major League home run. Cohen is
