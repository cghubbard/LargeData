Lawrence J. Corcoran (August 10, 1859 â€“ October 14, 1891) was an American 
pitcher in Major League Baseball. He was born in Brooklyn, New York.[1] 
Corcoran debuted in 1880, winning 43 games and leading the Chicago team 
to the National League championship. Cap Anson alternated him with pitcher 
Fred Goldsmith, giving Chicago the first true pitching "rotation" in professional 
baseball. In 1882, Corcoran became the first pitcher to throw two no-hitters 
in a career. Two seasons later, he became the first pitcher to throw three 
no-hitters, setting a record that would stand until 1965, when Sandy Koufax 
threw his fourth no-hitter. He is also famous for being one of baseball's 
very few switch-pitchers, and is the only player in MLB history whose batting-throwing 
combination was "bats left, throws both." A natural righty, Corcoran pitched 
four innings alternating throwing arms on June 16, 1884, due to the inflammation 
of his right index finger.[2] He is credited with creating the first method 
of signaling pitches to his catcher,[2] which consisted of moving a wad 
of chewing tobacco in his mouth to indicate what pitch would be thrown.[2] 
Corcoran's arm was dead by 1885, and by 1887 he was out of the league. 
Corcoran, afflicted with Bright's disease, died in Newark, New Jersey at 
the age of 32.[1] He was interred in the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in East 
Orange.[1] His brother, Mike, pitched in one major league game in 1884.[3]
