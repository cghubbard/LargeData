The history of the New York Yankees Major League Baseball (MLB) team spans 
more than a century. Frank J. Farrell and William Stephen Devery bought 
the rights to an American League (AL) club in New York City after the 1902 
season. The team, which became known as the Yankees in 1913, rarely contended 
for the AL championship before the acquisition of outfielder Babe Ruth 
after the 1919 season. With Ruth in the lineup, the Yankees won their first 
AL title in 1921, followed by their first World Series championship in 
1923. Ruth and first baseman Lou Gehrig were part of New York's Murderers' 
Row lineup, which led the Yankees to a then-AL record 110 wins and a Series 
championship in 1927 under Miller Huggins. They repeated as World Series 
winners in 1928, and their next title came under manager Joe McCarthy in 
1932. The Yankees won the World Series every year from 1936 to 1939 with 
a team that featured Gehrig and outfielder Joe DiMaggio, who recorded a 
record hitting streak during New York's 1941 championship season. New York 
set a major league record by winning five consecutive championships from 
1949 to 1953, and appeared in the World Series nine times during the next 
11 years. Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford were among the players 
fielded by the Yankees during the era. After the 1964 season, a lack of 
effective replacements for aging players caused the franchise to decline 
on the field, and the team became a money-loser for owners CBS while playing 
in an aging stadium. George Steinbrenner bought the club in 1973 and regularly 
invested in new talent, using free agency to acquire top players. Yankee 
Stadium was renovated and reopened in 1976 as the home of a more competitive 
Yankees team. Despite clubhouse disputes, the team reached the World Series 
four times between 1976 and 1981 and claimed the championship in 1977 and 
1978. New York continued to pursue their strategy of signing free agents 
into the 1980s, but with less success, and the team eventually sank into 
mediocrity after 1981. In the early 1990s, the team began to improve as 
their roster was rebuilt around young players from their minor league system, 
including Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. After earning a playoff berth 
in 1995, the Yankees won four of the next five World Series, and the 1998–2000 
teams were the last in MLB to win three straight Series titles. As the 
2000s progressed, the Yankees' rivalry with the Boston Red Sox increased 
in intensity as the sides met multiple times in the American League Championship 
Series (ALCS), trading victories in 2003 and 2004. New York regularly reached 
the postseason, but were often defeated in the first two rounds. In 2009, 
the Yankees opened a new Yankee Stadium and won the World Series for the 
27th time in team history. The furthest the Yankees have gone in the postseason 
since then is the ALCS, in 2010 and 2012. At the end of the 1900 baseball 
season, the Western League was positioned by its president, Ban Johnson, 
as a new major league that would compete with the established National 
League (NL). The league was reorganized and renamed the American League 
(AL), and eight cities fielded teams in the 1901 season. A Baltimore team 
had played in the NL through the 1899 season, after which the club was 
shut down by the league. Baltimore was one of three former NL cities where 
the AL placed teams in an effort to reach underserved fans.[1] The new 
Orioles' first manager was John McGraw, who had held the same position 
for the previous Baltimore team in 1899; McGraw also held an ownership 
stake.[2] In 1901, their first season, the Orioles had a 68–65 win–loss 
record and finished in fifth place in the AL.[3] During the season, there 
were numerous disputes between Johnson and McGraw over disciplinary issues, 
which continued into the following year.[4] Rumors began to spread that 
Johnson was interested in relocating the team to New York City, in an attempt 
to compete directly with the NL. McGraw left the Orioles and joined the 
New York Giants as their manager; he transferred his interest in the Baltimore 
team to the Giants as part of the deal.[5] Several Orioles—including Roger 
Bresnahan and Joe McGinnity—joined the Giants after McGraw's departure, 
and the Giants gained a majority of the Orioles' stock. The league managed 
to take back control of the team from the Giants; after the Orioles forfeited 
a game because they lacked enough active players,[6] Johnson ordered that 
the team be "restocked with players essentially given away by the other 
teams in order to play out the schedule", according to author Marty Appel.[7] 
The Orioles finished last in the league both in the standings and in attendance.[8] 
The AL and NL signed an agreement after the 1902 season that ended the 
leagues' battles for players, which had led to increasing salaries. Johnson 
sought the right to locate an AL team in New York City, which was granted 
as part of the leagues' peace agreement. His intention was for the team 
to play in Manhattan, but the idea was opposed by Giants owner John T. 
Brush and former owner Andrew Freedman, who were connected to the city's 
Tammany Hall political organization. They blocked several potential stadium 
locations, before a pair of Tammany Hall politicians, Frank J. Farrell 
and William Stephen Devery, purchased the New York franchise in the AL.[9] 
The pair paid US$18,000 for the team. It is not clear whether Farrell and 
Devery purchased the remains of the Orioles and moved them to New York, 
or if they received an expansion franchise.[10][note 1] It was the last 
change in the lineup of MLB teams for half a century.[13] The ballpark 
for the New York team was constructed between 165th and 168th Streets, 
on Broadway in Manhattan. Formally known as American League Park, it was 
nicknamed Hilltop Park because of its relatively high elevation.[14] The 
team did not have an official nickname; it was often called the New York 
Americans in reference to the AL. Another common nickname for the club 
was the Highlanders, a play on the last name of the team's president, Joe 
Gordon, and the British military unit, the Gordon Highlanders.[15] The 
team acquired players such as outfielder Willie Keeler and pitcher Jack 
Chesbro. The player-manager was Clark Griffith, obtained from the Chicago 
White Sox. On April 22, 1903, the Highlanders began their season with a 
3–1 loss to the Washington Senators; eight days later, they won their first 
game in Hilltop Park, defeating the Senators 6–2. New York fell out of 
contention for the AL pennant in May, falling to seventh place after playing 
games away from Hilltop Park for a 24-day period while construction on 
the stadium concluded. With a final record of 72–62 after wins in 19 of 
29 games played in September, New York finished in fourth.[16] Chesbro 
won 41 games in New York's 1904 season, still an AL record.[17] New York 
contended for the AL pennant with the Boston Americans (later nicknamed 
the Red Sox); Johnson aided New York by helping the team acquire multiple 
players in trades, including Boston's Patsy Dougherty. Boston and New York 
faced each other in a season-ending five-game series that decided the pennant 
winner, and was played from October 7–10. Boston won two of the first three 
games, which meant that New York needed to win the two contests scheduled 
on October 10 to win the AL title. With the score of the first game tied 
2–2 in the ninth inning, Chesbro threw a wild pitch that allowed a runner 
on third base to score, giving Boston a 3–2 victory that clinched the AL 
pennant; New York won the now-meaningless second game.[18] New York's performance 
declined in 1905, as numerous pitchers dealt with arm injuries and conditioning 
issues. After losing 18 of 25 games in May, the Highlanders ended the season 
in sixth.[19] In its 1906 season, New York again contended for the AL championship. 
With 13 games left, the team held a one-game lead over the White Sox, but 
finished in second place three games behind Chicago.[20] According to Appel, 
"What would follow would be a string of mediocre to bad seasons and not 
a very good attraction for baseball-crazed New York fans."[21] New York 
recorded a fifth-place finish in 1907, with 70 wins, 22 fewer than the 
league champion Detroit Tigers.[22] The 1908 and 1909 teams finished last 
and fifth, respectively, and there were multiple managerial changes in 
the period.[23] New York had a second-place finish in 1910, but did not 
seriously contend for the pennant. Manager George Stallings and first baseman 
Hal Chase, the team captain, clashed towards the end of the season; facing 
opposition from Ban Johnson, who wanted him to resign as manager, Stallings 
left the position. Chase managed New York's last 14 games.[24] The following 
season, New York had a sixth-place finish.[25] Early in the season, New 
York allowed the Giants to play in Hilltop Park after the Giants' stadium, 
the Polo Grounds, burned down; the arrangement lasted until June 28, when 
the rebuilt Polo Grounds opened.[26] Chase resigned as manager before New 
York's 1912 season; Harry Wolverton accepted the position.[27] That year, 
New York had a last-place finish with a record of 50–102, the winning percentage 
of .329 the lowest-ever for the club.[28] After their first couple of seasons 
in New York City, team ownership infrequently invested in new players. 
The ownership group of Farrell and Devery spent their money on personal 
pursuits such as gambling, leaving them with little to put into the team. 
New York's star player, Chase, consorted frequently with gamblers. Author 
Jim Reisler dubbed him "the most crooked player to ever play the game" 
because of reports that he took part in game fixing.[29] The club also 
had difficulty drawing fans to Hilltop Park.[30] Appel wrote that "maybe 
the best thing you could say about the ballpark was that it never burned 
down."[31] By the end of the 1912 season, Farrell was searching for a site 
to build a new stadium on.[32] New York started playing home games at the 
Polo Grounds in 1913 as tenants of the Giants.[33] Before the 1913 season, 
the team gained an official nickname for the first time. Either "Yankees" 
or "Yanks" had been used frequently since 1904 in newspapers such as the 
New York Evening Journal, since "Highlanders" was hard to fit in headlines.[34] 
Such unofficial nicknames were common during that era,[15] but thereafter 
the official name took hold—the New York Yankees.[35] A third major league, 
the Federal League (FL), began play in 1914 and lasted for two years. While 
the Yankees did not have to contend with direct competition for fans, as 
the FL chose to place its New York City franchise in Brooklyn instead of 
Manhattan,[36] the team nearly lost leading pitcher Ray Caldwell to the 
rival league after the 1914 season.[37] With the Yankees finishing seventh 
in 1913 and sixth in 1914,[38] Farrell and Devery sold the team to brewery 
magnate Jacob Ruppert and former United States Army engineer Tillinghast 
L'Hommedieu Huston.[39] The Yankees had rarely been profitable over the 
previous 10 years, and carried debts of $20,000.[40] The sale was completed 
on January 11, 1915, as the pair paid a combined $460,000. Ruppert called 
the team "an orphan ball club, without a home of its own, without players 
of outstanding ability, without prestige."[41] The new owners intended 
to spend freely to improve the club's talent level and made a major purchase 
in 1915, buying pitcher Bob Shawkey from the Philadelphia Athletics. In 
spite of this, the Yankees' 69 wins were only enough for fifth in the league.[42] 
After wearing different designs during the Highlanders years, in 1915 the 
Yankees introduced white uniforms with pinstripes and an interlocking "NY" 
logo during games at the Polo Grounds; this remains their home uniform 
design today. For road games, the team began to wear gray uniforms with 
"New York" across the chest from 1913; the Yankees still wear similar garb.[43][44] 
Following the acquisition of third baseman Frank "Home Run" Baker from 
the Athletics,[45] the 1916 Yankees had 80 wins and contended for the AL 
pennant for most of the season, before suffering a run of injuries to key 
players, including Baker.[46] In the Yankees' 1917 season, New York finished 
in sixth; Bill Donovan, the club's manager since 1915, was fired in the 
offseason.[47] Ruppert replaced him with Miller Huggins, completing the 
hire while Huston was overseas fighting in World War I.[48] The Yankees 
contended for first place in the war-shortened 1918 campaign along with 
the Red Sox and Cleveland Indians, but lost numerous players to military 
service and were fourth at 60–63.[49] After the season, the Yankees acquired 
three players—including outfielder Duffy Lewis and pitcher Ernie Shore—in 
a trade with the Red Sox, the winners of the 1918 World Series. In 1919, 
the club made another trade with Boston, acquiring pitcher Carl Mays for 
two players and $40,000. The midseason deal provoked a dispute between 
the teams and Ban Johnson, who unsuccessfully attempted to block it.[50] 
Mays had a 9–3 pitching record as a Yankee, and the team improved to 80–59 
for the season; the mark was good for third in the AL.[51] The 1919 season 
was the first in which the Yankees played games at the Polo Grounds on 
Sundays; until then, blue laws had banned Sunday baseball in New York state. 
The Yankees' attendance more than doubled in 1919, rising to about 619,000.[52] 
The Giants soon moved to force the Yankees out of the Polo Grounds, in 
an effort to secure more Sunday home games.[53] On December 26, 1919, the 
Yankees made an agreement with the Red Sox to purchase outfielder Babe 
Ruth for $25,000 cash and $75,000 in promissory notes. The deal, which 
was announced on January 5, 1920, was called "the most famous transaction 
in sports" by author Glenn Stout.[54] After tying for the MLB home run 
lead in 1918 with the Athletics' Tilly Walker (with 11), Ruth broke the 
single-season record with 29 in 1919.[55] At the same time, he sought a 
new contract that would double his $10,000 yearly salary.[56] After the 
trade, Boston did not win another World Series championship until 2004; 
an alleged jinx against the Red Sox, which was known as the Curse of the 
Bambino (after a nickname for Ruth), was first brought up when they lost 
the 1986 World Series and became widely discussed after Dan Shaughnessy 
authored a book with the title.[57] The deal became a symbol of "how things 
[would] always go wrong for the Red Sox and right for the Yankees", according 
to Stout.[58] With Ruth in the lineup, the Yankees' fortunes were transformed.[59] 
Playing on four World Series champion teams, Ruth hit 659 home runs and 
scored 1,959 runs; both marks are team records as of 2016. He is second 
in club history with 1,978 runs batted in and accumulated 2,518 hits as 
a Yankee, third on the team's all-time list.[60] As well as prowess on 
the field, Ruth had a larger-than-life personality, bringing him and his 
team a huge amount of press and public attention.[61] The addition of Ruth 
helped the Yankees increase their attendance to 1,289,422 for the 1920 
season; it was the first time that any MLB team drew more than one million 
fans in a year.[62] His skills and charm appealed to large segments of 
the New York City population; Stout wrote that "He belonged to everyone."[63] 
New York was the AL attendance leader for 13 of Ruth's 15 seasons with 
the team; the Yankees became solidly profitable as well, making over $370,000 
in 1920 and remaining in the black for the rest of the decade.[64] In 1920, 
Ruth hit 54 home runs for a new record; his total was higher than that 
of all other MLB teams but the Philadelphia Phillies. New York had 95 wins, 
the most in team history to that point, but fell three wins short of the 
AL championship and finished third.[65] In an August 16 game against the 
Indians, a pitch from Mays hit Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in the head, 
leading to his death; the Yankees slumped after the incident as Cleveland 
captured the pennant.[66] After the season, the Yankees hired general manager 
Ed Barrow from the Red Sox. Barrow made numerous trades with his former 
club, including one immediately after his departure that brought catcher 
Wally Schang and pitcher Waite Hoyt to New York.[67] The Yankees also became 
involved in another dispute with Ban Johnson, this time over the replacement 
of baseball's existing governing body, the National Commission, after reports 
came out that the 1919 World Series had been fixed. The Yankees and 10 
other franchises—including the entire NL—supported the idea of a three-man 
committee drawn from outside baseball running MLB, and for a time a move 
by the Yankees to the NL was rumored; ultimately, Judge Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis was named MLB's first commissioner.[68] The 1921 season began a 
44-year period in which the Yankees were, according to author Richard Worth, 
"The greatest sustained winning 'empire' in sports".[69] Ruth surpassed 
his own record by hitting 59 home runs. He also led MLB in on-base percentage 
with a .512 mark for the season.[70] The Yankees won the AL pennant for 
the first time, winning 98 games in the regular season; the total gave 
them the league championship by a margin of 4 1⁄2 games over Cleveland. 
In the best-of-nine 1921 World Series, they faced the Giants and won the 
first two games, but their opponents claimed the Series title when they 
won four of the next five games. Ruth suffered an arm infection, which 
limited his playing time in the later part of the Series.[71] He and Bob 
Meusel participated in exhibition games during the offseason, in violation 
of MLB rules forbidding players on pennant-winning teams from barnstorming 
after the World Series. Season-long suspensions were considered a possibility, 
but Landis decided to suspend the pair for six weeks.[72] Despite the setback, 
New York had 94 wins and repeated as AL champions. The St. Louis Browns 
were the closest pursuers, finishing one game behind New York. In the World 
Series, the Yankees again faced the Giants in an all-New York matchup; 
the Series changed to a best-of-seven format that year. The Giants defeated 
the Yankees in five games, including one that ended in a tie when it was 
suspended because of darkness.[73] By 1923, the teams no longer shared 
the Polo Grounds, as Giants owner Charles Stoneham had attempted to evict 
the Yankees in 1920. Although the attempt was unsuccessful,[74] and Stoneham 
and the Yankees' owners agreed to a two-year lease renewal,[75] the Giants 
indicated that the Yankees would not receive an extension after 1922.[76] 
The treatment pushed the Yankees into seeking their own stadium. In 1921, 
the team bought a plot of land in the Bronx, and the construction crew 
finished the new ballpark before the 1923 season.[77] Yankee Stadium, a 
triple-deck facility, was originally designed to hold more than 55,000 
spectators; it was later able to hold over 70,000.[78] Writer Peter Carino 
called the stadium "a larger and more impressive facility than anything 
yet built to house a baseball team."[79] At Yankee Stadium's inaugural 
game on April 18, 1923, Ruth hit the first home run in the stadium, which 
sportswriter Fred Lieb named "the House That Ruth Built" as the Yankees 
would not have needed such a large stadium without the Ruth-driven attendance. 
Ruth himself had a resurgence after receiving vocal criticism for his 1922 
World Series performance. He shared the MLB lead with Cy Williams by hitting 
41 home runs in the 1923 season, and had a career-best .393 batting average; 
his performance earned him the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award.[80][81] 
The Yankees finished first for the third consecutive year, and faced the 
Giants again in the 1923 World Series. Giants outfielder Casey Stengel 
hit game-winning home runs in two of the first three games of the World 
Series, but Ruth's three home runs helped the Yankees win in six games 
for their first MLB title.[82] Off the field, Ruppert purchased Huston's 
share of the Yankees for $1,250,000, assuming full ownership of the club.[83] 
The Yankees did not return to the World Series in either of the following 
two seasons. By 1925, New York had fallen to seventh place.[84] That year 
marked the team's last losing season until 1965; the 39-year streak of 
winning seasons is an MLB record.[85] First basemen Lou Gehrig debuted 
in 1925, earning a spot in the lineup he would not relinquish for almost 
15 years, a then-record consecutive games played streak.[86] The Yankees 
made more talent upgrades before their 1926 season, which included the 
signing of infielder Tony Lazzeri, who spent over a decade with the club. 
New York's performance on the field surpassed preseason expectations, and 
a 16-game winning streak in May gave the team a substantial lead. With 
a three-game final margin over the Indians, the Yankees won the pennant 
and a spot in the 1926 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals.[87] 
After the Yankees took a 3–2 series lead, the Cardinals won the final two 
games in Yankee Stadium to claim the Series title. Ruth hit three home 
runs in the fourth game, but made the final out of the Series on a failed 
stolen base attempt.[88] The Yankees' lineup in the 1927 season, which 
featured Ruth, Gehrig, Lazzeri, Meusel, Mark Koenig, and Earle Combs, was 
known as Murderers' Row for its power hitting. The team led in the standings 
throughout.[89] The Yankees took first place in early May, and by the end 
of June had posted a 49–20 record, giving them a large lead in the AL standings; 
by mid-September, they had clinched the pennant.[90] The 1927 Yankees had 
a 110–44 record in the regular season, and broke the AL record for wins 
in a year.[91] Ruth's total of 60 home runs set a single-season home run 
record that stood for 34 years.[55] Gehrig added 47 home runs and his 175 
RBI topped the AL; he won the first of his two AL MVP Awards.[92] The Yankees 
completed the season by sweeping the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1927 World 
Series.[93] The 1927 Yankees squad is included among the great teams in 
baseball history.[94] To begin the 1928 season, the Yankees went on a 34–8 
run and took a sizable lead. The Athletics chased them for the AL pennant 
towards the end of the season, but New York won the title again and faced 
the Cardinals in the 1928 World Series, sweeping them in four games. Coming 
off a 54-home run regular season, Ruth had three more and a .625 batting 
average in the Series, while Gehrig batted .545 with four home runs.[95] 
With the Yankees' run of three straight league pennants and two World Series 
titles came criticism from fans of other teams, who decried the team's 
dominance. Calls to "Break up the Yankees!" were made, and critics hoped 
that the team would sell Gehrig to separate him from Ruth; Ruppert declined 
to do so.[96] The Yankees' run of pennants was broken up by a rising Philadelphia 
Athletics team, which denied the Yankees a fourth straight AL championship 
in 1929.[97] The team's manager, Huggins, died on September 25. After Art 
Fletcher managed for the rest of the year, Shawkey took the position for 
the 1930 season, in which the Yankees had a third-place finish.[98] The 
Yankees fired Fletcher and hired Joe McCarthy; in his first season as manager, 
the team won 94 games but finished second behind the Athletics.[99] McCarthy's 
team was undergoing a transition from Murderers' Row; new contributors 
included Bill Dickey, who had first played for the Yankees in 1928, and 
pitchers Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez.[100] Ruffing, who had a 39–96 record 
with the Red Sox before being traded to New York, ended up 231–124 in his 
Yankees career.[101] In 1932, McCarthy's Yankees returned to the top of 
the AL with 107 wins, enough for a 13-game margin over the Athletics.[102] 
The Yankees met the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series and swept them 
four games to none. Gehrig had three home runs, eight RBI, and a .529 batting 
average for the Series, while Ruth contributed a pair of home runs in the 
third game at Chicago's Wrigley Field. The second of Ruth's home runs was 
his "called shot"; after pointing towards the center field stands, according 
to some post-game press reports, Ruth homered to break a 4–4 tie in the 
fifth inning. Although accounts of the incident vary greatly, author Eric 
Enders called the home run "the most talked-about hit in baseball history".[103] 
The Yankees began cutting their payroll in 1933, as their finances were 
strained by the Great Depression. Regardless, the makeup of the team was 
minimally impacted in comparison to the Athletics, who were forced to sell 
key players to lower their expenses.[104] From 1933 to 1935, the Yankees 
posted three consecutive second-place finishes.[105] Ruth's performance 
declined from previous seasons in 1933 and 1934, his final years with the 
team. The Yankees released Ruth from his contract before the 1935 season, 
and Gehrig took a leadership role for the club; he was named New York's 
captain.[106] New York was beginning to see results from an initiative 
to buy minor league teams in an effort to reduce the cost of obtaining 
players; after buying their first minor league club in 1929, the Yankees 
had a 15-team system by 1937. Players developed in the farm system entered 
the Yankee lineup beginning in the mid-1930s, and into the early 1960s 
this remained the team's primary player acquisition method.[107] McCarthy 
worked to regulate player behavior in areas such as mental focus and off-field 
attire; the Yankees acquired a "corporate image" that they retained for 
many years.[108] New York's 1936 season was Joe DiMaggio's first with the 
club. The young center fielder was signed in 1934 from the Pacific Coast 
League's San Francisco Seals, and made his debut with the Yankees in 1936, 
gaining an extra year's experience with the Seals. DiMaggio had a .323 
batting average, 29 home runs, and 125 RBI in his rookie season. Gehrig 
won the AL MVP Award for his season, in which he hit a career-high 49 home 
runs, with a .354 batting average and 152 RBI. Behind these performances, 
the Yankees had a 102-win season and won the AL pennant, before defeating 
the Giants in the 1936 World Series, four games to two.[109] After a second 
consecutive 102-win regular season and AL championship in the 1937 season, 
the Yankees again defeated the Giants in the Series—this time winning 4–1.[110] 
The 1938 Yankees had 48 victories in 61 games during one stretch, and won 
the team's third straight AL championship despite a drop in batting performance 
by Gehrig. In the 1938 World Series, the Yankees swept the Chicago Cubs 
in four games. Ruppert died early in 1939; before his death, he sold his 
ownership interest to Barrow, who took over as the Yankees' president.[111] 
Financially, the club's position had improved from earlier in the decade; 
after posting a net loss of around $170,000 from 1931 to 1935, the team 
made over $1 million during the next four years.[112] The 1939 Yankees 
lost the services of Gehrig early in the season. After starting the year 
poorly, he ended his streak of 2,130 consecutive games played; he was later 
diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which forced him to retire.[113] 
Despite the loss of Gehrig, New York fielded a team that posted 106 victories 
in 1939, 17 more than the second-place team. DiMaggio was named MVP of 
the league; he led the AL in batting average (.381) and was second in RBI 
(126). Ruffing led the Yankees' pitchers with 20 wins. In the 1939 World 
Series, the Yankees swept the Cincinnati Reds in four games for the club's 
fourth consecutive Series championship.[114] Writers have given the 1936–39 
Yankees acclaim for their success in regular season and World Series play; 
Stout wrote that the 1939 squad was "magnificent", and that their campaign 
was "wholly without drama" besides Gehrig's departure from the lineup.[115] 
In response to the Yankees' dominance, after the 1939 season the AL temporarily 
barred most transactions between the last pennant winner and other league 
teams in an attempt to prevent New York from improving its roster.[116] 
The Yankees' run of championships ended in 1940; the team had 18 more losses 
than in the previous season and finished second, two games behind the Tigers.[117] 
DiMaggio recorded base hits in 56 consecutive games for the Yankees during 
the 1941 season, breaking the MLB record of 44 games that had been set 
by Willie Keeler in 1897. His hitting streak lasted from May 15 to July 
17, when DiMaggio failed to record a hit during a game against the Indians 
at Cleveland Stadium.[118] After winning the AL pennant, the Yankees met 
the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1941 World Series, prevailing in five games. 
In Game 4, the Yankees trailed 4–3 in the ninth inning and were on the 
verge of defeat when Tommy Henrich struck out; Dodgers catcher Mickey Owen 
was unable to field the pitch, allowing Henrich to reach base. That began 
a four-run game-winning rally, and New York won the championship in Game 
5 the following day.[119] The attack on Pearl Harbor occurred during the 
offseason, and some baseball players immediately joined the Armed Forces. 
Most of the Yankees' roster remained with the team in 1942, and the club 
repeated as AL champions despite Gomez's departure. In the 1942 World Series, 
the Cardinals gave the Yankees their first Series loss since 1926, after 
winning in eight consecutive appearances.[120][121] DiMaggio and other 
Yankees entered the military before the 1943 season, but the club won the 
AL championship for the 14th time and 7th since 1936. The Cardinals met 
the Yankees in a World Series rematch, and New York won four games to one.[122] 
After 1943, more of the team's players were drafted into military, and 
the Yankees ended 1944 in third place, one position higher than they finished 
the following season.[123] A group consisting of Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping, 
and Del Webb bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the franchise's minor 
league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945.[124] Under the new ownership, Yankee 
Stadium underwent extensive renovations that included the installation 
of lights. With the war over and the return of players from overseas, the 
Yankees set an MLB single-season home attendance record by attracting 2,265,512 
fans in 1946. McCarthy resigned as manager early in the season. The Yankees 
used two other managers during the year (Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun), 
and ended 1946 in third place.[125] Catcher Yogi Berra made his Yankees 
debut that year; in his 18-season career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three 
times.[126] Bucky Harris was brought in to be the manager, and his 1947 
team won the AL pennant and defeated the Dodgers in a seven-game World 
Series.[127] After the end of the Series, MacPhail sold his share of Yankees 
ownership to Topping and Webb for $2 million.[128] Despite contending late 
into the season, the 1948 Yankees finished in third place. Harris was released 
and the Yankees brought in Casey Stengel to manage.[129] At the time, Stengel 
had "a reputation as a bit of a clown", according to Appel, and had been 
unsuccessful in two previous MLB managing stints.[130] As the Yankees' 
manager, he optimized matchups by using a platoon system, playing more 
left-handed batters against right-handed pitchers.[131] Numerous injuries 
affected the team[132] during the 1949 season but it battled with the Red 
Sox for the AL pennant; before a season-ending two-game series at Yankee 
Stadium, New York trailed Boston by one game and needed a pair of wins.[133] 
By scores of 5–4 and 5–3, the Yankees won the two games and the league 
championship.[134] New York won a World Series rematch with the Dodgers 
in five games.[135] Stengel was named AL Manager of the Year in his first 
season.[132] The Yankees faced another competitive pennant race in 1950, 
as the Tigers joined New York and Boston at the top of the AL. Late in 
the season, the Yankees broke a tie with the Tigers for first place and 
went on to win the pennant.[136] In the 1950 World Series, the Yankees 
swept the Phillies; the second game was decided by a DiMaggio home run 
in the tenth inning.[137] Following the season, Yankee Phil Rizzuto was 
named AL MVP after recording 200 base hits during the regular season.[138] 
Fan interest in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the 
late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, 
when they sold about 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was 
down by over 700,000.[139] New York baseball fans had the option of watching 
games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the 
other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure 
from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced.[140] Regular 
season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management 
believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios.[141] 
DiMaggio played his final MLB season in 1951, while highly touted outfielder 
Mickey Mantle made his debut for New York. Pitcher Allie Reynolds threw 
two no-hitters during 1951, as the Yankees claimed the AL pennant for the 
third straight year. They then won the 1951 World Series against the Giants, 
four games to two.[142] When their 1952 team took the AL pennant, the Yankees 
had an opportunity to match the four straight World Series championships 
won by the team from 1936 to 1939. In another Yankees–Dodgers matchup, 
New York fell behind three games to two, but victories in games six and 
seven gave the Yankees the title.[143] New York and Brooklyn were matched 
again in the 1953 World Series, and a Billy Martin base hit that decided 
the sixth and final game of the Series gave the Yankees another four games 
to two victory and a fifth title in a row.[144] As of 2016, the 1949–1953 
Yankees are the only MLB teams to win five straight World Series; no team 
since has won more than three in a row.[145] The Yankees won 103 games 
in 1954, the most yet for a Stengel-managed team, but the Indians took 
the pennant with a then-AL record 111 wins.[146] One year later, the 1955 
Yankees faced the Dodgers in the World Series.[147] After the teams split 
the first six games of the Series, the Yankees lost the seventh and final 
game 2–0, giving the Dodgers their first Series win.[148] Elston Howard, 
the first African American player in Yankees history, made his debut in 
1955. His arrival came eight years after MLB's color line had been broken, 
as the Yankees' management had sought to avoid integrating the club's roster.[149] 
As teams such as the Dodgers added black players, the Yankees turned down 
numerous opportunities to acquire Negro league talent.[150] Management 
feared alienating white fans and harbored stereotypes of African American 
players. Author Robert Cohen called these views "symbolic of the overall 
arrogance of Yankee ownership and management, as well as their prevailing 
racial attitudes."[151] In 1956, Mantle won the MVP award for a season 
in which he led the AL and MLB in batting average (.353), home runs (52), 
and RBIs (130), becoming the second Yankee (after Gehrig in 1934) to win 
a Triple Crown.[152] The 1956 Yankees won the franchise's seventh AL championship 
under Stengel and advanced to a World Series rematch with the Dodgers. 
In Game 5, with the Series even at 2–2, Yankees pitcher Don Larsen threw 
a perfect game. In seven games, the Yankees won the Series.[153] By 1957, 
the Yankees had won 15 of the last 21 AL pennants. The team's minor-league 
system had been reduced to 10 teams from a peak of 22, and its scouting 
system was acclaimed by Sports Illustrated's Roy Terrell as "the best in 
all baseball."[154] Instead of signing many players for their organization, 
the Yankees concentrated on acquiring a smaller number of highly skilled 
players, according to head scout Paul Krichell. The club recruited players 
by selling them on the "fame, fortune and fat shares of a World Series 
pot" that came with making New York's roster.[154] The 1957 Yankees reached 
that year's World Series, but lost in seven games to the Milwaukee Braves.[155] 
Following the Series, the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California, 
leaving the Yankees as New York's only MLB team. Despite their status as 
the sole New York City-based franchise, the Yankees' 1958 attendance decreased 
from previous seasons as the team could not attract bereft Giants and Dodgers 
fans.[156] In the 1958 World Series, the Yankees had an opportunity to 
avenge their defeat to the Braves. The Yankees fell behind by losing three 
of the first four games, but won the final three games of the Series to 
claim another championship.[157] The Yankees were unable to defend their 
AL and World Series championships in 1959, as they ended up with a 79–75 
record, their worst record since 1925, good for third place.[158] When 
Arnold Johnson (a friend of Topping and Yankees general manager George 
Weiss) became the owner of the Kansas City Athletics in 1955, his new team 
made many transactions with the Yankees. From 1956 to 1960, the Athletics 
traded many young players to the Yankees for cash and aging veterans. The 
trades strengthened the Yankees' roster, but brought criticism from rival 
clubs.[159] Before their 1960 season, the Yankees made one such trade with 
the Athletics in which they acquired outfielder Roger Maris.[160] In his 
first Yankees season, Maris led the league in slugging percentage, RBIs, 
and extra base hits, finished second with 39 home runs, and won the AL 
MVP Award.[161] The 1960 Yankees won the AL pennant for the 10th time in 
12 years under Stengel, and outscored the Pirates 55–27 in the seven World 
Series games. However, the team lost four of them, falling short of a Series 
championship after Bill Mazeroski hit a walk-off home run in the final 
game, ending a contest that Appel called "one of the most memorable in 
baseball history."[162] The season turned out to be Stengel's last as Yankees 
manager; he indicated that his age played a role in the team's decision, 
saying, "I'll never make the mistake of being seventy again."[163] Ralph 
Houk was chosen to replace Stengel.[164] During the 1961 season, both Mantle 
and Maris chased Ruth's single-season home run record of 60, and the pair 
attracted much press attention as the year progressed. Ultimately, an infection 
forced Mantle to leave the lineup and bow out of the race in mid-September 
with 54 home runs. Maris continued, though, and on October 1, the final 
day of the season, he homered against Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard into 
the right field stands of Yankee Stadium, breaking the record with 61. 
Commissioner Ford Frick decreed that two separate records be kept, as the 
Yankees played a 154-game schedule in 1927 (beginning in 1961, AL teams 
played 162 games to accommodate the league's expansion to 10 teams).[165][166] 
MLB did away with the dual records 30 years later, giving Maris sole possession 
of the single-season home run record before it was broken in 1998 by Mark 
McGwire.[167] The Yankees won the pennant with 109 regular season wins, 
at the time the club's second-highest single-season total, and defeated 
the Cincinnati Reds in five games to win the franchise's 19th World Series. 
The team hit 240 home runs to break the MLB single-season record. Maris 
won another AL MVP Award, while Whitey Ford captured the Cy Young Award, 
having posted a 25–4 record. The team gained a reputation as one of the 
strongest the Yankees had fielded, along with the 1927 and 1939 Yankees.[168] 
New York returned to the World Series in 1962, facing the San Francisco 
Giants. After exchanging victories in the first six games of the Series, 
the Yankees won the decisive seventh game 1–0 to clinch the title.[169] 
The Yankees again reached the World Series in their 1963 campaign, but 
were swept in four games by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Houk left the manager's 
position to become the team's general manager and the newly retired Berra 
was named manager.[170] After dealing with player injuries and internal 
dissension, the Yankees rallied from third place late in the 1964 season 
and won the AL pennant by one game over the White Sox.[171] It was their 
fifth straight World Series appearance and fourteenth in the past sixteen 
years.[145] The team faced the St. Louis Cardinals in a series that included 
a walk-off home run by Mantle to end the third game. Despite Mantle's game-winning 
hit, the Yankees were defeated by the Cardinals in seven games, and Berra 
was fired.[172] In 1964, CBS announced that it was purchasing 80 percent 
of the Yankees for $11.2 million. The television network bought the remaining 
20 percent, originally retained by Topping and Webb, during the next two 
years. Topping left as team president after the sale; CBS executive Mike 
Burke replaced him.[173] From 1962 to the sale, Topping and Webb had sharply 
curtailed the Yankees' investment in their minor league system, to show 
greater profits. As a result, the team lacked capable replacements for 
its aging players.[174] Other factors affected the club's fortunes as well. 
The team had been slow in signing African American players even after Howard,[175] 
and lost the opportunity to sign future stars.[176] As most American League 
clubs dragged their feet in integrating their rosters, the rapid decline 
of the Yankees' white stars left them on the same footing as the rest of 
the league.[177] Also, the 1965 introduction of the MLB draft, which allowed 
the clubs with the worst records to have the first selections, meant that 
the Yankees could not outbid other teams for young talent.[178] Their trade 
pipeline with the A's had dried up by 1960, as new A's owner Charlie Finley 
announced his intention to avoid trading with New York.[179] Competition 
for the attention of local fans had been provided by the expansion New 
York Mets, founded in 1962. By 1964, the new club started a 12-year streak 
of outdrawing the Yankees; the Mets also won the 1969 World Series.[180] 
The Yankees had a record of 77–85 in 1965, and their sixth-place finish 
was their lowest since 1925. It was only their second finish in the second 
division since 1918. Johnny Keane, who was hired to succeed Berra as manager, 
was fired after the Yankees lost 16 of 20 games to start their 1966 season; 
Houk named himself as Keane's replacement. A last-place finish—their first 
since 1912—followed at season's end, and the Yankees ended up one position 
higher, ninth, the following season. Ford, Howard, Mantle, and Maris all 
retired or were traded to other clubs between 1966 and 1969.[181] Attendance 
at Yankee Stadium fell to between 1 and 1.3 million fans per season from 
1965 to 1971, and dropped below 1 million in 1972.[182] One 1966 game had 
a crowd of 413 fans; television announcer Red Barber was fired by the Yankees 
after discussing the low attendance during his telecast.[183] After fifth-place 
finishes in 1968 and 1969 (the latter in the newly created six-team American 
League East division), the 1970 Yankees improved to second in the AL East 
with a 93–69 record,[184][185] finishing behind the Baltimore Orioles.[186] 
Catcher Thurman Munson played his first full season for the Yankees and 
won AL Rookie of the Year honors for 1970.[187] New York had 11 more losses 
during their 1971 season than they had in 1970,[188] but in 1972 they contended 
for the AL East title and a playoff berth. Late in the season, the Yankees 
were in a four-way tie for the most wins in the division, but a slump caused 
them to fall to fourth by the end of their campaign with a record of 79–76.[189] 
Less than a decade into its ownership of the Yankees, CBS moved to sell 
the team in 1972. In eight years, the team posted an $11 million loss under 
CBS;[190] losing money in all but two years.[191] Along with the decrease 
in attendance, the Yankees' television revenues fell by more than 80 percent 
from their peak, and in 1973 were more than $1 million below what the Mets 
earned from their broadcasting agreement.[192] A group of investors, led 
by Cleveland-based shipbuilder George Steinbrenner, purchased the club 
from CBS on January 3, 1973 for $10 million.[193] Despite an initial promise 
that he would "stick to building ships" and remain in the background, Steinbrenner 
proved to be a hands-on owner, clashing with Burke and forcing him out 
of his leadership position.[194] Describing the level of control displayed 
by the lead owner, investor John McMullen stated, "There is nothing in 
life quite so limited as being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner."[195] 
The 1973 Yankees held the AL East lead entering August, but faded and ended 
the year fourth.[196] The 1973 season was the team's last in Yankee Stadium 
before the building was renovated.[197] The Yankees had become concerned 
about the drop in attendance and the poor conditions of the stadium's surroundings. 
For a time, New Jersey sought to attract sports teams to the Meadowlands 
Sports Complex, and New York City acted to prevent the Yankees from moving. 
The city paid $24 million to buy Yankee Stadium and the adjacent land, 
and in 1972 agreed to renovations.[198] Work on the stadium finished in 
1976, and the Yankees were required to play at the Mets' home field, Shea 
Stadium, in 1974 and 1975.[199] During the first of those seasons, the 
team nearly won the AL East, finishing behind the Orioles in a race that 
was decided in the final games. The Yankees were helped by an early-season 
trade that brought first baseman Chris Chambliss to the team, and improved 
to 89 wins from 1973's 80 victories.[199] After the 1974 season, star pitcher 
Catfish Hunter was declared a free agent because of a skipped insurance 
payment.[200] The Yankees signed him to a $3.75 million, four-year contract. 
It was the beginning of a long-term franchise philosophy of using free 
agency to acquire talent; Stout writes that they "were the first team to 
comprehend what free agency meant", as it provided an advantage over lower-spending 
rivals and generated fan and media interest.[201] Hunter had 23 wins during 
the Yankees' 1975 season, but the team did not contend for the playoffs 
after July.[201] New York fired manager Bill Virdon in August and hired 
Billy Martin as his replacement.[202] With Martin as the helm, the Yankees 
returned to the postseason in their first season in the renovated Yankee 
Stadium, winning the 1976 AL East title by a 10 1/2-game margin over the 
Orioles. Munson was named AL MVP, with a .302 batting average and a total 
of 105 RBIs that was second-best in the AL. The 1976 American League Championship 
Series (ALCS) between the Yankees and Kansas City Royals went to a deciding 
fifth game, which was won by New York on a walk-off home run by Chambliss. 
The Yankees did not win a game against the Cincinnati Reds in the 1976 
World Series.[203] Free agency was introduced more fully from the 1976 
offseason; outfielder Reggie Jackson, who had spent one season with the 
Orioles after being traded by the Athletics, was the most significant player 
available in that first offseason.[204] Steinbrenner signed Jackson to 
a five-year, $2.96 million contract, giving the Yankees a key player, but 
one who had difficulty fitting in with the rest of the team. Martin had 
opposed Jackson's signing, and many players were angered by comments Jackson 
made that were critical of Munson. Jackson and Martin nearly came to blows 
in the Yankees' dugout during one game against the Red Sox, in which Martin 
removed Jackson for being slow to field a ball. The incident sparked media 
reports of disputes between Martin and Steinbrenner, and further conflict 
between Martin and Jackson. The Yankees of the late-1970s, noted for clubhouse 
conflict and on-field success, were later nicknamed "The Bronx Zoo", after 
a book of the same name by pitcher Sparky Lyle, and at the time, New York 
and the baseball world were agog at their antics.[205] The 1977 Yankees 
won the AL East and defeated the Royals in the 1977 ALCS. Trailing 3–2 
in the top of the ninth inning of the decisive fifth game, the Yankees 
scored three times to gain a berth in the World Series.[206] Against the 
Dodgers, the Yankees prevailed in six games for their first Series championship 
since 1962. Jackson hit a record five home runs in the Series, including 
three in Game 6 on consecutive pitches, against three different Dodgers 
pitchers.[207] Jackson gained his own candy bar and the nickname "Mr. October".[208] 
Before their 1978 season, the Yankees added relief pitcher Goose Gossage, 
even though their closer was reigning Cy Young Award winner Lyle.[209] 
By the middle of July, the team was 14 games behind the Red Sox and infighting 
had begun again. After making comments to reporters criticizing both Jackson 
and Steinbrenner, Martin resigned and Bob Lemon was hired as manager. The 
Yankees closed the gap that Boston had opened on them, and by the start 
of a four-game series at Fenway Park on September 7, the Red Sox' lead 
was down to four games.[210] Over the course of the series, nicknamed "The 
Boston Massacre", the Yankees outscored the Red Sox 42–9, winning each 
game.[211] The teams finished the regular season with identical records, 
and an AL East tie-breaker game was held on October 2.[212] Losing 2–0 
in the seventh inning, the Yankees took the lead on a three-run home run 
by shortstop Bucky Dent, and eventually won 5–4.[213] After beating the 
Kansas City Royals for the third consecutive year in the ALCS, the Yankees 
faced the Dodgers again in the 1978 World Series. They lost the first two 
games on the road, but then returned to Yankee Stadium and won three consecutive 
games before clinching a Series championship in Game 6 in Los Angeles.[214] 
Pitcher Ron Guidry was the Cy Young Award winner in 1978, having posted 
25 wins against 3 losses with a 1.74 ERA, and 248 strikeouts. Eighteen 
of his strikeouts came in his June 17 appearance against the California 
Angels, which broke the franchise record.[215] On August 2, 1979, Munson 
was killed in a plane crash. Martin, who had returned as manager after 
Steinbrenner fired Lemon in June, said that with his death, "The whole 
bottom fell out of the team."[216] The 1979 Yankees finished fourth with 
an 89–71 record.[217] Steinbrenner fired Martin after the season and replaced 
him with Dick Howser, who led the Yankees to 103 wins and the AL East title 
in 1980. Jackson led the AL with 41 home runs and posted a .300 batting 
average for the Yankees, who finished three games ahead of the Orioles. 
Their stay in the postseason was brief, as the Royals beat them in three 
straight games to win the ALCS.[218] Before their 1981 campaign, the Yankees 
signed Dave Winfield to a 10-year contract worth $23 million, a record 
at the time. The season was shortened by a strike, and the Yankees qualified 
for the playoffs by virtue of leading the AL East when the work stoppage 
began. They defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in a divisional playoff round 
in five games. and won the AL pennant with three straight wins over the 
Athletics in the ALCS. The Yankees won the first two games of the 1981 
World Series against Los Angeles, but the Dodgers won the next four games 
and the championship.[219] Following the team's loss to the Dodgers in 
the 1981 World Series, the Yankees had a 15-year absence from the World 
Series, the longest since the time before their initial appearance in 1921.[220] 
As the 1980s progressed, the Yankees regularly spent heavily on free agents 
who were often aging and proved to be declining in performance.[221] The 
atmosphere of turmoil around the club discouraged some players from signing 
contracts with New York; they either ignored the Yankees' offers or used 
them to get more money from other teams.[222] Steinbrenner traded prospects 
for veterans; sportswriter Buster Olney called this "a practice that ultimately 
inflicted serious damage on the organization, leaving the team without 
the needed influx of young and cheap talent."[223] With Steinbrenner at 
the helm, the team continued to change managers frequently; there were 
21 managerial changes in his first two decades of ownership; Martin served 
five separate stints as New York's manager.[224] The 1982 and 1983 Yankees 
were fifth and third, respectively.[225] Henry Fetter wrote of the following 
year's team, which had several aging players, "The 1984 Yanks had assembled 
an all-star lineup—but it was that of 1979."[221] In what became a trend 
in future seasons, the Yankees lacked effective pitching, undoing the efforts 
of a top-tier offense that included players such as Winfield and first 
baseman Don Mattingly, one of the few star hitters produced by the farm 
system during the era. Mattingly led the AL in batting average in 1984—beating 
out Winfield for the league lead.[226] The Yankees' 1985 season began with 
a batting lineup improved by an offseason trade for Rickey Henderson, the 
future MLB career stolen base and runs scored record holder.[227] Mattingly 
was AL MVP in 1985, with 145 RBI and a personal-best 35 home runs, while 
Guidry won 22 games. The Yankees had 97 wins, two off the division leader 
Toronto Blue Jays.[228] The 1986 side's win total fell to 92, but it was 
only enough for second place again behind Boston. Mattingly hit an MLB 
record six grand slam home runs in 1987, but dealt with back pain that 
limited his effectiveness in his remaining years. The Yankees fell to fourth,[229] 
beginning a six-year streak of fourth or worse.[230] The Yankees had the 
most wins of any MLB team during the 1980s,[230] but missed the playoffs 
eight times during the decade and did not win a World Series.[231] Many 
New York baseball fans chose to support an exciting Mets team. From 1984 
to 1992, a period that featured their 1986 World Series victory, the Mets' 
attendance topped that of the Yankees every year.[221] Despite falling 
attendance, the Yankees' finances were not significantly harmed, as they 
had a 12-year television rights contract with the Madison Square Garden 
network that gave them a record $500 million and flexibility to increase 
their payroll if desired.[232] Winfield's tenure with the team ended when 
he was traded in May 1990. The 1990 team lost 95 games to finish at the 
bottom of the AL East, and its .414 winning percentage was the franchise's 
worst since 1913.[233] The Yankees underwent a dramatic change in their 
front office that year, which Glenn Stout cites as a turning point for 
the club.[234] Winfield had become a target of Steinbrenner in previous 
years. At one 1985 game, he criticized Winfield by calling him "Mr. May", 
that is, a player who only performed well early in the season.[234][235] 
Steinbrenner also resented Winfield's salary as too high, and was critical 
of a charitable foundation run by him.[234] A gambler was paid by Steinbrenner 
"for damaging information" about Winfield, an incident that resulted in 
an indefinite suspension from then-commissioner Fay Vincent in 1990. Under 
new general manager Gene Michael, the Yankees allowed their minor league 
talent more time to improve their skills and more of a chance to play for 
the Yankees if they were good enough.[236] Michael focused on on-base percentage 
in deciding which hitters to pursue, and emphasized left-handed batters 
who might take advantage of Yankee Stadium's short right-field porch.[237] 
The players developed by the team during its rebuilding years included 
outfielder Bernie Williams, a future AL batting average leader,[238] and 
a group—Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada, and Mariano Rivera—that 
became the centerpiece of the championship teams of the 1990s, and was 
later nicknamed the "Core Four".[239] After a 71-win 1991 season, the Yankees 
replaced their incumbent manager, Stump Merrill, with Buck Showalter, who 
increased the playing time given to young players. While the 1992 Yankees 
were 20 games behind the AL East winner, offseason acquisitions—third baseman 
Wade Boggs, pitcher Jimmy Key, and outfielder Paul O'Neill—helped the 1993 
team to an 88–74 record and New York's highest finish (second) in seven 
seasons. By 1994, the Yankees had progressed to the point where they led 
the AL with a 70–43 record going into the homestretch of the regular season.[240] 
Their campaign was cut short by a players' strike, which resulted in the 
cancellation of the playoffs and 1994 World Series.[241] Many media members 
believed that the Yankees might have reached the World Series if not for 
the strike.[242] A year later, the team reached the playoffs and gave Mattingly 
his first career postseason appearance by winning the first AL wild card 
berth, but it was eliminated in a five-game Division Series (ALDS) against 
the Seattle Mariners.[243] Mattingly did not return to the Yankees for 
their 1996 season, and the club replaced Showalter with Joe Torre.[244] 
Although the managerial change met with a mixed reception by the press,[245] 
Torre received praise for his handling of players as his managerial career 
progressed; Olney remarked that he was able to "defuse powder-keg issues 
and serve as a buffer between Steinbrenner and the players."[246] Jeter 
won the AL Rookie of the Year Award in his first full season with the Yankees, 
and Pettitte with 21 wins was second in AL Cy Young Award voting and Rivera 
posted an 8–3 record and 2.09 ERA as the club won a division title.[247] 
New York reached the 1996 World Series, where they lost the first two games 
at home to the Atlanta Braves by a combined score of 16–1. But New York 
won three straight contests in Atlanta, including a Game 4 in which they 
scored eight straight runs to rally from a 6–0 deficit.[248] With a 3–2 
win in Game 6, the Yankees won the World Series for the first time in 18 
years.[249] For 1997, the Yankees signed starting pitcher David Wells and 
allowed closer John Wetteland to leave in free agency, enabling Rivera 
to inherit the role. The 1997 Yankees earned a wild card playoff berth, 
but lost three games to two against the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS.[250] 
In preparation for their 1998 season, the Yankees replaced general manager 
Bob Watson with Brian Cashman. The club made many player acquisitions, 
gaining the services of third baseman Scott Brosius, second baseman Chuck 
Knoblauch, and starting pitcher Orlando Hernández. The Yankees won 28 of 
their first 37 games—a stretch that concluded with a perfect game pitched 
by Wells—and by August were 76–27.[251] The 1998 Yankees are considered 
by some writers to be among the greatest teams in baseball history,[252][253][254] 
having compiled a then-AL record of 114 regular-season wins against 48 
losses. After playoff series wins over the Texas Rangers and Indians, New 
York defeated the San Diego Padres in four consecutive World Series games 
for their 24th Series title.[255] After the 1998 season, Wells was traded 
to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger Clemens, who had just completed two 
consecutive Cy Young Award-winning seasons. In a regular season that included 
another perfect game by a Yankees pitcher, this one by David Cone, New 
York led the AL East with 98 wins and beat the Rangers in the ALDS. This 
led to an ALCS against the rival Red Sox. New York won the first two games 
en route to a 4–1 series win, and went on to sweep the Braves in the 1999 
World Series. The postseason results gave the 1998–99 Yankees a 22–3 playoff 
record, and the team held a 12-game winning streak in World Series competition 
dating back to 1996.[256] Although the 2000 Yankees had an 87–74 regular 
season record that was the worst among playoff qualifiers,[257] the team 
won consecutive playoff series to claim the AL championship. New York's 
pennant placed them in the 2000 World Series against the cross-town Mets, 
the first Subway Series in 44 years.[258] With a four games to one victory, 
the Yankees gained their third successive title.[259] As of 2016, the 2000 
Yankees are the most recent MLB team to repeat as World Series champions 
and the Yankees of 1998–2000 are the last team to win three consecutive 
World Series.[145] Free agent pitcher Mike Mussina signed with the Yankees 
before their 2001 season began, and the club pulled away from the Red Sox 
as the year progressed to claim another divisional championship, as Clemens 
won 20 games. The September 11 attacks interrupted the season, and the 
resumption of baseball in New York became a symbol of how the city recovered 
from the destruction of the Twin Towers. After falling behind 2–0 in the 
ALDS against the Athletics, the Yankees won three straight contests to 
advance to the ALCS. They prevailed in five games against the Seattle Mariners, 
who had tied a single-season MLB record with 116 regular season wins, for 
the team's fourth straight AL pennant.[260] The Arizona Diamondbacks gained 
a two-game lead in the 2001 World Series before the Yankees won three consecutive 
ballgames; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth inning of Games 
4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games, with Game 4 ended by a 
Jeter home run.[261] The Yankees' championship streak ended, though, as 
the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in the 
final inning of Game 7.[262] After the 2001 season, several players from 
the late 1990s and early 2000s Yankees teams departed. New York won their 
fifth AL East title in a row in its 2002 campaign, but the Anaheim Angels 
defeated the Yankees in the ALDS.[263] The Yankees' major acquisition in 
the offseason was leading Japanese hitter Hideki Matsui of the Yomiuri 
Giants.[264] Another signing, that of Cuban pitcher José Contreras, led 
to complaints from Red Sox CEO Larry Lucchino, who dubbed his team's rivals 
"the Evil Empire".[265] Tensions between the rivals increased in the coming 
seasons, and writers called the rivalry one of the most intense and well 
known in North American professional sports.[266][267][268] By 2003, New 
York's overall payroll had reached almost $153 million, more than the Padres, 
Brewers, Royals, and Tampa Bay Devil Rays combined.[269] Criticism of the 
Yankees' spending such as Lucchino's was frequently raised; during a 15-year 
stretch from 1999 to 2013, they had the biggest MLB player payroll every 
year.[270] Jeter became the Yankees' captain in their 2003 season. The 
team faced the Red Sox in the ALCS. The series came down to a seventh game, 
and the Yankees fell behind before three eighth-inning runs forced a 5–5 
tie and extra innings. Aaron Boone, a third baseman acquired by New York 
in a mid-season trade, hit a walk-off home run in the eleventh inning to 
give New York the pennant. The Yankees were then defeated by the Florida 
Marlins in the World Series, four games to two.[271] The Yankees added 
power hitting to their lineup in the offseason, signing free agent Gary 
Sheffield and trading for shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who became a third 
baseman with New York. Three of the starting pitchers from the previous 
season—Clemens, Pettitte, and Wells—left the team before the season. Despite 
the losses, the 2004 Yankees managed to top the AL East with 101 wins and 
defeat the Twins three games to one in the ALDS.[272] The victory set up 
an ALCS rematch with the Red Sox. The Yankees took a 3–0 series lead before 
losing four consecutive games, becoming the first team in MLB history to 
lose a best-of-seven series after winning the first three games.[273] The 
2005 season featured an AL MVP performance by Rodriguez, who hit a league-leading 
48 home runs with 130 RBIs and a .321 batting average. The Yankees beat 
the Red Sox for the division title because they won 10 of their 19 contests 
against Boston; both teams had 95–67 records.[274] The Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim defeated the Yankees in five games in the first round of the 
postseason.[275] The 2006 Yankees kept at the same level, as they won the 
AL East for the ninth straight year but were eliminated in the ALDS by 
the Detroit Tigers three games to one.[275] Rodriguez again won the AL 
MVP award in 2007, as his 54 home runs and 156 RBIs topped the AL; he scored 
143 runs, the highest single-season number by a player since 1985. After 
starting the year 21–29, the Yankees rallied to win the AL's wild card 
berth; it was the first time in 10 seasons that they did not win the AL 
East. New York's season ended in the first round of the playoffs; the Indians 
won the opening two games of the ALDS and finished the series in four games. 
Manager Torre did not re-sign after the season, and Joe Girardi took his 
place.[276] Rodriguez, who used an opt-out clause in his contract to become 
a free agent, stayed with the Yankees by signing for $275 million over 
10 seasons, an MLB record.[277] The 2008 season was the Yankees' last in 
which they played at the original Yankee Stadium. The club had sought a 
new stadium to increase revenues, following the example set by other MLB 
teams.[278] It was also the first in which Hal and Hank Steinbrenner ran 
the team as general partners; though George Steinbrenner was still the 
principal owner on paper, he yielded operational responsibilities during 
the 2007 offseason. Yankee Stadium was the site of the 2008 All-Star Game, 
but for the first time in 14 years did not host playoff action. New York 
ended the year third in the AL East and failed to qualify for the postseason.[279] 
The new Yankee Stadium, which cost a record $1.5 billion, was constructed 
near the old facility. As built, it had a capacity of approximately 52,000, 
with 52 luxury suites.[278] Monument Park, which holds plaques and monuments 
honoring former Yankees personnel, was built beyond the center field fence; 
its collection was transplanted from the old stadium.[280] For the 2009 
season, the team committed over $400 million in future salaries to three 
free agents: pitchers CC Sabathia and A. J. Burnett, and first baseman 
Mark Teixeira.[281] New York won 90 of its last 134 games, and broke the 
franchise single-season record by hitting 244 home runs.[282] Another club 
record was broken by Jeter, who passed Gehrig as the Yankees' all-time 
hits leader on September 11.[283] New York posted 103 wins in 2009 and 
beat out the Red Sox for the division title by eight games. In the AL playoffs, 
the Yankees defeated the Twins in the ALDS and the Angels in the ALCS, 
advancing to the World Series. There, they faced the defending Series champions, 
the Philadelphia Phillies.[284] Behind a six-RBI effort by Matsui in the 
sixth and final game, the Yankees defeated the Phillies to win their record 
27th Series championship.[285] George Steinbrenner died in July 2010. The 
Yankees won the league's wild card berth, but their title defense was ended 
by the Texas Rangers in the ALCS.[286] Multiple Yankees players set individual 
marks in 2011. Jeter joined the 3,000 hit club on July 9; he was the first 
player to do so while playing for the club. Later in the season, Rivera 
posted the 602nd save of his career, breaking the all-time record that 
had been held by Trevor Hoffman. The Yankees won the AL East, but lost 
in the ALDS to the Tigers.[287] Rivera suffered a season-ending injury 
to his right knee in May 2012 while catching fly balls before a game against 
the Royals.[288] Even without their longtime closer, the 2012 Yankees gained 
a 10-game lead by mid-July, and held off the Orioles to win the division 
title by a final margin of two games.[289] After defeating the Orioles 
in a five-game ALDS, the Yankees were swept by the Tigers in the ALCS.[290] 
During Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Jeter broke his right ankle while attempting 
to field a ball.[291] He was one of many Yankees to miss playing time during 
the club's 2013 campaign; 20 players were placed on the disabled list at 
least once. The team had an opportunity to win a wild-card playoff spot, 
but faded late in the season.[292] It was only the second time since 1995 
that New York did not qualify for postseason play.[293] In the offseason, 
second baseman Robinson Canó departed New York for the Mariners in free 
agency, but the Yankees signed starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, who was 
coming off a 24–0 year with Japan's Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, to a 
seven-year contract.[294] Rodriguez was suspended for the 2014 season by 
MLB for using performance-enhancing drugs.[295] The 2014 Yankees, the last 
with Jeter in their lineup, fell four games short of a postseason berth 
with an 84–78 record. Despite signing several new hitters prior to the 
season, the team finished third from last in the AL in runs scored.[296] 
The offense improved in 2015, ending the regular season with the second-most 
runs in MLB. New York gained a wild card berth with a second-place finish, 
but was defeated by the Houston Astros in a one-game playoff.[297] The 
Yankees traded several veteran players during their 2016 season, and Rodriguez 
was released from his contract. The club had 84 wins, but missed the playoffs 
for the third time in four years.[298] As of 2016, the Yankees' 27 World 
Series championships are 16 more than the number won by the St. Louis Cardinals, 
who have the second-most titles among MLB teams.[299] New York's championship 
total is the highest of any franchise in a major North American league; 
the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens are second behind the Yankees 
with 24 Stanley Cup wins.[300] The 40 AL titles won by the Yankees places 
them 17 in front of the Cardinals for the most pennants won by an MLB team. 
The Giants and Dodgers are the only other clubs with 20 or more pennants.[299] 
The Baseball Hall of Fame has inducted over 40 players and managers who 
have worn Yankees pinstripes.[301] Forbes magazine has labeled the Yankees 
the most valuable team in baseball every year since 1998; the franchise 
was worth an estimated $3.4 billion in 2016.[302] In Glenn Stout's Yankees 
history book, the author wrote: More often than not, they have shown just 
how the game of baseball is supposed to be played. Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, 
Mantle, Mattingly, Jeter, and dozens of other players impossible to forget 
have worn their uniform. Yankee Stadium has been their stage. The very 
definition of a dynasty, they have created the collective memories that 
make friends of strangers, given their city a face, and displayed its heart
