As Player As Manager John Lester Moss (May 14, 1925 – August 29, 2012) 
was an American professional baseball player, coach, scout and manager.[1] 
He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the St. Louis Browns 
for the most significant portion of his career, and was a backup catcher 
almost all his career.[1] Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Moss began his professional 
baseball career in 1942 at the age of 17, playing for the American Pioneers 
of the Georgia–Florida League.[2] In 1943 he moved up to the Class A Elmira 
Pioneers of the Eastern League where he posted a .308 batting average in 
96 games.[2] He missed the 1944 and 1945 seasons while serving in the Merchant 
Marines during the Second World War.[3] He would play for the Toledo Mud 
Hens in 1946, hitting .297 in 121 games before, being called up late in 
the season to make his major league debut at the age of 21 with the St. 
Louis Browns on September 10.[1][2] Moss platooned alongside left-handed-hitting 
catcher Jake Early, producing a .157 batting average in 96 games during 
the 1947 season.[4] He caught the majority of the games for the Browns 
in 1948 while his hitting improved substantially, with a .257 average along 
with 14 home runs and 46 runs batted in.[5] In 1949, the Browns acquired 
24-year-old Sherm Lollar from the New York Yankees and, Moss became the 
second string catcher.[6] Moss' hitting continued to improve with a .291 average 
and an impressive .399 on-base percentage.[1] On May 17, 1951, Moss was 
traded to the Boston Red Sox.[7] After producing a .198 batting average 
in 71 games for the Red Sox, he would be traded back to the Browns on November 
28, 1951.[1][7] He continued as the Browns' second string catcher backing 
up Clint Courtney. Moss was the Browns' catcher on May 6, 1953 when Bobo 
Holloman pitched a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Athletics.[8] In 
1954, the Browns relocated to Baltimore and were renamed the Orioles. Moss 
played one full season in Baltimore before being traded to the Chicago 
White Sox on June 6, 1955, where he once again served as a back up to Sherm 
Lollar.[7] He played three more seasons with the White Sox before ending 
his major league career after the 1958 season.[1] Moss returned to the 
minor leagues, appearing in two games for the Indianapolis Indians in 1959 
and then, appeared in three games for the San Diego Padres in 1960, before 
retiring as a player at the age of 35.[2] In a 13-year major league career, 
Moss played in 824 games, accumulating 552 hits in 2,234 at bats for a 
.247 career batting average along with 63 home runs, 276 runs batted in 
and a .333 on-base percentage.[1] He ended his career with a .978 fielding 
percentage.[1] After his playing career, Moss served as the White Sox' 
batting practice catcher, then moved into their player development organization 
as a manager in their farm system and an occasional scout through 1966.[3] 
In 1963, he managed the Lynchburg White Sox to a second-place finish, and 
was named the Sally League manager of the year. In 1964 he returned to 
Indianapolis and managed the Indians to a second-place finish. He served 
as a coach on the White Sox staff from 1967 to 1970. Moss served as interim 
manager in 1968 for 36 games when White Sox manager Al Lopez had to undergo 
an emergency appendectomy.[3][9] He was the White Sox pitching coach in 
1970.[3] In 1975, Moss was hired by the Detroit Tigers to manage in their 
minor league organisation.[3] He managed the Montgomery Rebels to two Southern 
League championships in 1975 and 1976.[3] In 1977 and 1978, Moss managed 
the Evansville Triplets. While managing the Triplets, he was credited with 
developing Lance Parrish's catching skills, after the Tigers converted 
him from a third baseman to a catcher.[10] After the 1978 season, Moss 
was voted Manager of the Year in the American Association, and The Sporting 
News named him Minor League Manager of the Year.[3] Moss succeeded Ralph 
Houk as manager for the 1979 Detroit Tigers. In his time with the Tigers 
he went 27–26.[9] He actually was not fired for cause or because he was 
ineffective, but rather because Sparky Anderson had unexpectedly become 
available. Moss was named manager soon after the 1978 season concluded. 
However, the Tigers had not counted on Anderson being fired on November 
27, 1978 by the Cincinnati Reds. Moss was a victim of bad timing, as the 
Tigers came to a deal to bring Anderson to the Tigers after the first third 
of the 1979 season. Dick Tracewski coached four games as interim manager 
until Anderson's arrival. Moss finished with a managing record of 39–50 
(.438) in 89 games.[9] Moss also managed in the farm systems of the California 
Angels and Chicago Cubs.[3] Late in his on-field career, Moss served as 
pitching coach of the Cubs in 1981 and, then for the Houston Astros from 
1982 to 1989, helping the Astros win the 1986 National League Western Division 
title.[3] In 1990, he worked as minor-league pitching instructor for the 
Astros, before working as a pitching coordinator for the San Francisco 
Giants starting in 1991. He retired from baseball in 1995.[3] Moss died
