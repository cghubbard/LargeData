Timothy Leroy Lincecum (/ˈlɪnsᵻkʌm/ LIN-sə-kʌm;[1] born June 15, 1984), 
nicknamed "The Freak", is an American professional baseball starting pitcher 
who is a free agent. He pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 
San Francisco Giants from 2007 to 2015 and for the Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim in 2016. Lincecum helped the Giants win three World Series championships 
in a five-year span. Lincecum was the team's ace starter in 2010 and as 
a relief pitcher in 2012 and 2014, winning the Babe Ruth Award in 2010 
as the most valuable player of the MLB postseason. After attending Liberty 
Senior High School in Renton, Washington, Lincecum played college baseball 
at the University of Washington. Pitching for the Washington Huskies, he 
won the 2006 Golden Spikes Award. That year, Lincecum became the first 
Washington Husky to be selected in the first round of an MLB Draft, when 
the San Francisco Giants selected him tenth overall. Nicknamed "The Freak" 
for his ability to generate powerful pitches from his athletic but slight 
physique and "Big-Time Timmy Jim" for his clutch pitching, the 5'11" 170 
pound power pitcher led the National League in strikeouts and strikeouts 
per nine innings pitched for three consecutive years in a span from 2008 
to 2010 as well as shutouts in 2009, helping Lincecum win consecutive Cy 
Young Awards in 2008 and 2009 to become the first MLB pitcher to win the 
award in his first two full seasons. He has also appeared in four consecutive 
All-Star Games, from 2008 through 2011. In 2013, Lincecum pitched the first 
Petco Park no-hitter against the San Diego Padres. He repeated the feat 
again the following year, also against the Padres, becoming the first pitcher 
in MLB history to secure the first no-hit repeat against the same team 
in consecutive seasons. Lincecum is one of only two pitchers in MLB history 
to win multiple World Series championships, multiple Cy Young Awards, throw 
multiple no-hitters, and be elected to multiple All-Star Games, the other 
being Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax. Lincecum attended Liberty Senior High 
School in Renton, Washington, where he played two seasons of varsity baseball. 
As a senior he won state player of the year and led his school to the 2003 
3A state championship title.[2] After high school Lincecum went on to pitch 
for the University of Washington. In 2006 he finished with a 12–4 win-loss 
record and a 1.94 earned run average (ERA), 199 strikeouts, and three saves 
in 125⅓ innings [3] as a Washington Husky. He won the 2006 Golden Spikes 
Award, which is awarded annually to the best amateur baseball player.[4] 
In the summer of 2004 Lincecum played for the amateur National Baseball 
Congress (NBC) Seattle Studs and won two games in the NBC World Series. 
In 2009 he was named NBC Graduate of the Year.[5] In the summer of 2005, 
he played for the Harwich Mariners in the Cape Cod Baseball League.[6] 
Lincecum was selected by the Chicago Cubs of the NL in the 48th round (1,408th 
overall) of the 2003 MLB draft, but did not sign.[7] He decided to attend 
college instead, and was selected by the Cleveland Indians in the 42nd 
round (1,261st overall) upon re-entering the draft in 2005, but rejected 
an offer including a $700,000 signing bonus.[6] The next year, he was drafted 
tenth overall by the San Francisco Giants, becoming the first player from 
the University of Washington to be taken in the first round.[2] He signed 
for a $2.025 million signing bonus on June 30, which at the time was the 
most the organization had ever paid to any amateur player.[8][a] During 
his brief minor league career he was frequently named as the top pitching 
prospect in the Giants organization.[9] Lincecum made his professional 
debut on July 26, 2006, with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes (the Giants' Class 
A Short Season affiliate) against the Vancouver Canadians, pitching one 
inning and striking out all three batters he faced. After his second outing 
on July 31 against the Boise Hawks, in which he pitched three innings, 
striking out seven and allowing just one baserunner, he was promoted to 
the High Class-A San Jose Giants. On August 5, in his first start in San 
Jose against the Bakersfield Blaze, he pitched 2⅔ innings, allowing three 
runs (two earned), and striking out five. Lincecum finished the year 2–0 
with a 1.95 ERA, 48 strikeouts, and 12 walks in 27⅔ innings pitched. He 
also got the victory in the opening game of the California League playoffs, 
giving up one run on five hits in seven innings, striking out ten and walking 
one against the Visalia Oaks. Visalia would win the series 3–2. Going into 
2007 Lincecum was ranked as the #1 prospect in baseball and the #1 prospect 
in the San Francisco Giants by Baseball America.[10] He spent the first 
month of the season pitching for the Fresno Grizzlies, the Giants' Triple-A 
affiliate. In five starts (31 innings), he allowed just one run, twelve 
hits, eleven walks, while striking out forty-six and going 4–0.[11] During 
his 2006 and 2007 minor league campaigns, Lincecum struck out the highest 
percentage of batters (minimum 100) of any minor league pitcher in the 
last ten years: 30.9 percent.[12] In the spring of 2007 Colorado Rockies 
prospect Ian Stewart called Lincecum "the toughest pitcher [he] ever faced", 
adding "Guys on our club who have been in the big leagues said he's the 
toughest guy they ever faced too … I’m not really sure why he's down here, 
but for a guy who was drafted last year … that guy is filthy."[13] With 
an injury to the Giants' fifth starter, Russ Ortiz, Lincecum was called 
up from Fresno to make his first major league start on May 6, 2007, against 
the Philadelphia Phillies. In his first career inning, Lincecum struck 
out three, the first being Chase Utley.[14] He earned his first major league 
win in his next start, on the road against the Rockies.[15] Lincecum, who 
is often compared to retired pitcher Roy Oswalt,[16][17] faced him in each 
of his next two starts against the Astros. After the first match-up, Astros 
third baseman Mike Lamb said, "The stuff he was throwing out there tonight 
was everything he's hyped up to be. He was 97 mph (156 km/h) with movement. 
You just don't see that every day. He pitched very much like the pitcher 
he is compared to and out-dueled him throughout the night."[18] The pair 
dueled to a no-decision the first time, and Lincecum pitched eight innings 
and got the win the second time.[19] In July, he went 4–0 with a 1.62 ERA.[20] 
On July 1, in a seven inning performance against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
he struck out twelve, the fourth highest total ever by a Giants rookie.[21] 
Lincecum pitched into the ninth inning for the first time on August 21 
against the Chicago Cubs, holding a 1–0 lead. He had allowed just two hits 
and one walk through the first eight, while throwing only eighty-eight 
pitches. Cubs shortstop Ryan Theriot said after the game, "He's got electric 
stuff. The best stuff I've seen all year."[22] Lincecum was shut down in 
September as a precaution, due to his high inning count in his first full 
year of professional ball.[23] Between the minors and the majors, he pitched 
a total of 177⅓ innings.[24][25] The Giants asked Lincecum not to throw 
the bullpen sessions typical of other pitchers during the off-season. Manager 
Bruce Bochy told the San Francisco Chronicle that they were being careful 
with Lincecum because studies have shown that pitchers who throw 200 innings 
early in their career are more susceptible to injuries.[26] On May 15, 
after Lincecum struck out ten Houston Astros in six innings, Houston first 
baseman Lance Berkman offered his view of Lincecum: "He's got as good of 
stuff as I've ever seen. ... He's got three almost unhittable pitches."[27] 
After falling to Lincecum and the Giants 6–3 on May 27, Arizona Diamondbacks 
first baseman Conor Jackson gave his impression of facing Lincecum: "He's 
got good stuff", Jackson said. "From what I saw tonight, that's the best 
arm I've seen all year, no doubt. You've got to almost hit a ball right 
down the middle. You're going to pop up the ball at your bellybutton, which 
we all did tonight, and the one down, it's coming in at 98 mph (158 km/h), 
you're not going to put too much good wood on it. Even the ones down the 
middle are coming at 98. He's good, man."[28] Lincecum was on the cover 
of the July 7, 2008, issue of Sports Illustrated,[29] and on July 6, he 
was selected to play in his first Major League Baseball All-Star Game. 
However, he was hospitalized the day of the game due to flu-like symptoms 
and was unavailable to pitch. In a July 26 game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
he struck out thirteen batters in seven innings while allowing seven hits, 
two earned runs, and no walks. Lincecum pitched his first shutout, against 
the San Diego Padres on September 13.[30] In nine innings he threw 138 
pitches, gave up four hits and struck out twelve batters.[31] On September 
23, he broke Jason Schmidt's San Francisco single-season strikeout record 
with his 252nd strikeout of the season against the Colorado Rockies. He 
finished the season with 265 strikeouts (54 of them three-pitch strikeouts, 
the most in the majors), making him the first San Francisco pitcher to 
win the National League strikeout title, and the first Giant since Bill 
Voiselle in 1944.[32] His 10.5 strikeouts per nine innings pitched were 
the best in the majors, and his .316 slugging-percentage-against was the 
lowest in the major leagues, as was his .612 OPS-against.[33][34] His 138 
pitches on September 13 were the most by any pitcher in a game in 2008.[35] 
He finished the season with an 18–5 record.[36] On November 11, 2008, Lincecum 
was awarded the NL Cy Young Award, making him the second Giant to win the 
award, after Mike McCormick.[37] He finished 23rd in the National League 
Most Valuable Player Award voting by the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America. After winning the NL Cy Young Award in 2008 Lincecum continued 
his dominance in the National League. On June 2 at Nationals Park, Lincecum 
struck out the Washington Nationals' Christian Guzman for his 500th career 
strikeout, becoming the fastest Giants pitcher in franchise history to 
reach the milestone.[38] In his six June starts he went 4–1 with a 1.38 
ERA, and pitched three complete games. On July 3, Lincecum was announced 
as the NL Pitcher of the Month for June.[39] Lincecum was announced as 
an NL All-Star along with his teammate Matt Cain. He was also the starting 
pitcher for the NL. Lincecum went two innings in the All-Star Game, giving 
up two runs, one earned, and striking out one.[40] Through twenty starts 
in 2009 Lincecum had amassed an 11–3 record with a 2.30 ERA, 183 strikeouts, 
four complete games, and two shutouts. Lincecum also had a twenty-nine 
scoreless inning streak, third-best since the Giants moved west in 1958.[41] 
On July 27, in a 4–2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at AT&T Park, Lincecum 
pitched a complete game and struck out a career-high fifteen batters, the 
second most in San Francisco Giants franchise history. His fifteen strikeouts 
is the most recent occurrence since Jason Schmidt fanned sixteen on June 
6, 2006, who reset the San Francisco record surpassing Gaylord Perry and 
also tied Christy Mathewson's all-time franchise record.[42] On August 
3, Lincecum was named National League Player of the Week.[43] Lincecum 
missed his first game since coming up to the big leagues on September 8 
against the San Diego Padres.[44] Madison Bumgarner took his place that 
day, making his major league debut. Lincecum was healthy enough to make 
his next start on September 14, pitching seven innings with eleven strikeouts 
lowering his ERA to 2.30, and picking up his fourteenth win of the year.[45] 
Lincecum finished the 2009 season with a 15–7 record, 2.48 ERA and 261 
strikeouts. Following the season, Lincecum was named Sporting News NL Pitcher 
of the Year for the second consecutive year.[46] He was later cited during 
a traffic stop on October 30 for misdemeanor possession of marijuana.[47] 
On November 19, Lincecum was awarded his second consecutive Cy Young Award, 
narrowly edging out St. Louis Cardinals pitchers Chris Carpenter and Adam 
Wainwright, who actually had the most first place votes.[48] In doing so, 
he became the first pitcher in Major League Baseball history to be awarded 
the Cy Young in each of his first two full seasons. He finished 18th in 
the National League Most Valuable Player Award voting by the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America. Lincecum continued his dominance in the Majors 
by starting 5–0. His strikeouts piled up quickly and was atop the Major 
Leagues in the category through the early season. However, issues concerning 
Lincecum's control over the movement of his pitches arose when he walked 
five batters for the fourth consecutive start on May 31.[49] Although the 
early struggles have been mostly dismissed as a "lack of confidence" or 
"mental" issues,[50] Lincecum himself admits that the slump lasted "longer 
than I was hoping it would."[51] Lincecum eventually recovered somewhat 
from his slump and made the 2010 National League All-Star Team. As of the 
All-Star break, Lincecum was 9–4 with a 3.16 ERA over 116.2 innings pitched. 
One of his great first half accomplishments was that Lincecum defeated 
Houston's Roy Oswalt three times in three months. All three games were 
pitchers' duels.[52] On July 15, 2010, in his first start after the All-Star 
game, Lincecum pitched a six-hit, complete game shutout against the New 
York Mets. After a disappointing August, Lincecum came out of his slump 
on September 1; pitching against one of the league's top pitchers, Ubaldo 
Jiménez, Lincecum pitched 8 strong innings of 1 run ball. This was Lincecum's 
first win since July 30. Lincecum continued to improve throughout September, 
finishing 5–1 with 52 strikeouts and 6 walks as compared to the 20/13 ratio 
in August. Lincecum managed to win his third consecutive National League 
strikeout title, he also set a record for most strikeouts by a MLB pitcher 
in his first four seasons.[53] Lincecum finished the 2010 regular season 
with a 16–10 record, 3.43 ERA and 231 strikeouts. On October 7, in his 
first postseason game, Lincecum pitched a complete game two-hit shutout, 
striking out a playoff career-high 14 batters, against the Atlanta Braves 
in game 1 of the NLDS, breaking the all-time record for strikeouts in Giants 
postseason history.[54] In his next postseason start, he outdueled Roy 
Halladay by pitching 7 innings and giving up 3 earned runs, while striking 
out 8 in the Giants' 4–3 victory over the Phillies in Game 1 of the National 
League Championship Series.[55] In Game 6 on October 23, with the Giants 
clinging to a one run lead, Lincecum was summoned from the bullpen on one 
day's rest to pitch the bottom of the 8th. He struck out the dangerous 
Jayson Werth before surrendering singles to the next two batters. The Giants 
won the game 3–2, advancing to the 2010 World Series. Lincecum pitched 
in both Games 1 and 5 of the World Series, earning a win in both. Game 
1 of the 2010 World Series saw Lincecum contribute to an 11–7 win over 
the Texas Rangers. After presenting a strong start, he sat out the final 
3 1/3 innings as the San Francisco bullpen preserved a comfortable win. 
On November 1, 2010, Lincecum started Game 5 of the World Series with an 
opportunity to clinch a world championship for San Francisco. Lincecum 
utilized all his pitches in throwing 8 solid innings, collecting 10 strikeouts 
while giving up only 3 hits, including a home-run, en route to a 3–1 victory. 
His victory in Game 5 ended the Giants' 56-year drought between championships 
and also gave San Francisco its first baseball world championship in history. 
Lincecum also set franchise single postseason records with four wins and 
forty-three strikeouts by a right-handed pitcher. On May 4, he struck out 
twelve Mets becoming the Giants franchise record holder for the number 
of games pitched with 10 or more strikeouts with 29, surpassing Hall of 
Fame "first five" inaugural member Christy Mathewson. Mathewson accumulated 
his 28 ten-plus-strikeout games in 551 starts over seventeen seasons of 
pitching for the Giants; Lincecum collected his 29 in 129 starts over five 
seasons.[56] On May 21, he threw his 8th career complete game and his 5th 
career shutout against the Oakland Athletics. Lincecum almost threw his 
first no-hitter on April 18, giving up his first hit after 6 1/3 innings. 
On June 6, he recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against the Washington 
Nationals, striking out Jerry Hairston, Jr.. He accomplished this during 
his fifth year in the Major Leagues, becoming only the eighth pitcher in 
history to do so.[57] He is the second player ever to have 1,127 strikeouts 
by his 5th season in the Major Leagues.[citation needed] He was only 29 
strikeouts short of passing Tom Seaver for having the most strikeouts in 
the first five seasons as a Major League Baseball Player, which was 1,155. 
In 2011, Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw and Lincecum matched up 
four times, evoking memories of the rivalry between Sandy Koufax and Juan 
Marichal in the 1960s.[original research?] In those four games the scores 
were 2–1, 1–0, 2–1, 2–1, all in the Dodgers' favor. On September 10, 2011, 
they struck out a combined 20 batters. Lincecum finished the 2011 season 
13–14, despite a top-tier ERA of 2.74 (4th in the NL) and a stellar second-half 
ERA of 2.31. Lincecum's win-loss record was largely due to his receiving 
the worst run support in all of Major League Baseball; the Giants scored 
no runs in ten of his outings and scored two runs or fewer in 21 of them, 
leading to Lincecum becoming one of only six pitchers in modern major league 
history to have at least 200 strikeouts, an ERA of below 2.75, and a losing 
record.[citation needed] Lincecum's knees started to get sore in 2011, 
and he felt he needed to lose weight. He spent the offseason swimming and 
gave up eating at In-N-Out Burger, losing 30 pounds (14 kg). Lincecum signed 
a two-year, $40.5 million deal with the Giants, making him eligible for 
free agency after the 2013 season. He rejected their offer of a five-year, 
$100 million extension. Lincecum was converted to a relief pitcher in the 
2012 MLB playoffs. On October 7, Lincecum made a relief appearance during 
Game 2 of the 2012 National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Cincinnati 
Reds and threw two shutout innings. On October 10, in Game 4 of the NLDS, 
Lincecum made an important long relief appearance when his 4 1/3 innings 
helped the Giants beat the Cincinnati Reds to force a decisive Game 5 in 
their NLDS and Lincecum was named the winning pitcher. Counting his start 
against Atlanta in the 2010 playoffs and his two relief appearances in 
this series, Lincecum is 2–0 with an 0.59 ERA in NL Division Series play. 
He allowed just five hits and one walk while striking out 22 in 15 1/3 
innings. Lincecum was second on The Giants in innings pitched during the 
NLDS, allowing just one earned run over 6.1 innings in two relief appearances 
and striking out eight batters without issuing a single walk.[58] Lincecum 
won his second championship title in three years, pitching effective relief 
in the 2012 World Series 4-game sweep over the Detroit Tigers, in which 
he struck out eight of the 16 batters he faced, including the heart of 
the Tigers' order (Prince Fielder, Miguel Cabrera and Delmon Young). During 
the 2012 offseason, Lincecum "maintained an offseason conditioning program 
that he knew would help him coordinate the many moving parts in his delivery." 
[59] After a series of lackluster performances in Spring training, many 
seemed to worry.[60] He said, "Mechanically, I felt really good."[59] He 
started the season 3rd in the rotation behind Cain and Bumgarner.[61] On 
April 3, he made his first start of the season; he threw 5 innings, struck 
out 4, tied a career-high in walks with 7 batters, and allowed 2 runs (0 
earned) on three hits while en route to the win.[62] In his second start, 
there were signs of better control; despite walking 4 batters, he struck 
out 7 while allowing just 4 hits over 6 innings, eventually getting no 
decision.[63] On July 13, 2013, Lincecum no-hit the San Diego Padres 9–0 
at Petco Park, the first no-hitter ever pitched in that stadium and the 
first of his career. He struck out 13 batters, walked 4, and hit 1 while 
throwing a career-high 148 pitches, which were the second most number of 
pitches ever thrown in a no-hitter, after the 149 Edwin Jackson threw in 
his June 25, 2010 no-hitter.[64] The 13 strikeouts were the second-most 
by a Giant in pitching a no-hitter, after the 14 in Matt Cain's perfect 
game a year earlier. Lincecum, the losing pitcher in Homer Bailey's second 
career no-hitter only eleven days earlier, became the first no-hit pitcher 
to also be the losing pitcher in another no-hitter during the same season 
since the Giants' Juan Marichal in 1963, as well as the first pitcher since 
Bill McCahan in 1947 to hurl a no-hitter after being on the losing end 
of the last no-hitter before it.[65] The #FreakNoHitter hashtag became 
popular amongst social media. Lincecum finished the first half of his season 
with a record of 5–9 with a 4.26 ERA and 125 strikeouts, a significant 
improvement from his first half in 2012. On September 20 at Yankee Stadium, 
Lincecum struck out the New York Yankees' Curtis Granderson for his 1,500th 
career strikeout. He became one of just three pitchers to reach that milestone 
in their first seven seasons, joining Tom Seaver and Bert Blyleven.[66] 
Manager Bruce Bochy pulled Lincecum when he loaded the bases with two outs 
in the bottom of the seventh inning, replacing him with George Kontos, 
former Yankee teammate of Alex Rodriguez. Lincecum had already retired 
Rodriguez three times, as Rodriguez was allowed to play for appealing his 
suspension for his involvement in the Biogenesis scandal. The runs were 
charged to Lincecum when Rodriguez hit his record-breaking 24th career 
grand slam. Despite an ERA of 4.54 in the second half of the season, it 
was considered inflated, as the bullpen accounted for an unusually high 
12 earned runs charged to Lincecum.[67] In 32 starts in 2013, Lincecum 
went 10–14 with 15 quality starts and a 4.37 ERA, striking out 193 in 197.2 
innings. On October 22, Lincecum signed a two-year, $35 million contract 
through 2015, avoiding free agency.[68] Lincecum would go on to earn $17 
million in 2014 and $18 million in 2015. On June 25, 2014, Lincecum pitched 
his tenth career complete game and second career no-hitter, also against 
the San Diego Padres, this time at AT&T Park and on 35 fewer pitches. On 
the offensive side, he registered two hits, both leadoff singles, walked 
once, and scored two runs. This no-hitter was very nearly a perfect game, 
as the Padres had just one baserunner, Chase Headley on a second inning 
walk. It was his first no-hitter at AT&T, the second at AT&T against the 
Padres, and the third no-hitter in the short history of the ballpark.[69] 
With his second no-hit performance against the Padres, Lincecum became 
the second player in Major League Baseball history to throw two no-hitters 
against the same team, joining Hall of Famer Addie Joss and the first in 
Major League history to do it in back-to-back seasons.[69] He is also the 
second Giant with two no-hitters, along with Christy Mathewson. He has 
the most career no-hitters in San Francisco Giants history and is tied 
with Mathewson for most Giants no-hitters in franchise history. With his 
second no-hit performance, Lincecum joins elite company. He joins Sandy 
Koufax, Randy Johnson, and Roy Halladay as the only pitchers in MLB history 
to throw multiple no-hitters and win multiple Cy Young Awards as well as 
multiple All-Star selections. Lincecum and Sandy Koufax are the only pitchers 
in MLB history to throw multiple no-hitters and to win multiple Cy Young 
Awards and multiple World Series championship titles as well as multiple 
All-Star selections. For his play, on June 30, he was again awarded National 
League Player of the Week honors. On July 22, 2014, Lincecum earned his 
first career save, pitching 0.2 innings against the Philadelphia Phillies 
in a 9–6, 14-inning victory. In the 14th inning, he inherited runners at 
second base and third base with only one out. Only the runner at third 
scored. Lincecum became the fifth pitcher since 1976 to pitch a no-hitter 
and record a save in the same season, joining Matt Garza, Chris Bosio, 
Jerry Reuss, and John Candelaria.[70] Saves became an official MLB statistic 
in 1969, but according to Baseball-Reference.com, it would make Lincecum 
the ninth Giants' pitcher to toss a no-hitter and record a save in the 
same season, joining Gaylord Perry, Carl Hubbell, Jesse Barnes, Rube Marquard, 
Jeff Tesreau, Hooks Wiltse, Christy Mathewson, and Amos Rusie. The last 
time Lincecum pitched out of the bullpen against the Phillies was in the 
8th inning of the series-clinching Game 6 of the 2010 NLCS. On September 
25, Lincecum won his 100th career game in a 9–8 victory over the San Diego 
Padres at AT&T Park, clinching a wild-card playoff berth. He became the 
first pitcher in Major League history to throw the least number of pitches 
and record the least number of outs to win his 100th career game at two 
and one.[71] Lincecum entered Game Two of the 2014 World Series, opening 
the bottom of the seventh inning. He retired all five batters he faced, 
throwing 23 pitches, including 13 strikes and two strikeouts. Lincecum 
left the game in the eighth inning with lower back tightness.[72] Despite 
the injury, the Giants defeated the Royals in seven games, to give Lincecum 
the third World Series championship of his career. Lincecum performed well 
during spring training in March 2015 and showed signs of his old form.[73] 
Showcasing a newfound command in his repertoire, Lincecum improved to 2-2 
with a 2.40 ERA with 20 strikeouts and 11 walks in 30 innings pitched by 
May 3.[74] On the same date, he pitched eight scoreless innings against 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, striking out four and allowing only 
three hits and a walk.[75] On May 8, Lincecum pitched six scoreless innings 
against the Miami Marlins, allowing only three hits and striking out eight.[76] 
On May 20, in a 4-0 Win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, Lincecum pitched 
seven shutout innings and passed Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell for second 
place during the San Francisco era and fourth place in franchise history 
on the Giants all-time career strikeouts list.[77] On May 20, 2016, Lincecum 
signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim.[78] He was optioned to the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees on May 22. 
On June 18, after being called up to start in Oakland, Lincecum pitched 
six innings of one-run ball to earn a victory in his Angels debut. Lincecum 
can throw a four-seam fastball, but mostly uses a two-seam fastball grip 
which he throws generally around 87-89 mph[81] for more sinking movement 
to get more ground balls. This pitch has little lateral movement, due to 
his overhand delivery and the speed at which the pitch is thrown. He has 
a breaking curveball that is thrown at a range of 72-75 mph and breaks 
away from a right-handed hitter. Lincecum uses a changeup that he grips 
similar to a splitter with sinking two-seam action. His changeup appears 
similar to his fastball for the first 30 feet (9.1 m), but then dives down 
sharply tailing away from a left-handed batter (80-83 mph).[81][82] The 
majority of his strikeouts are recorded with this pitch. Lincecum also 
has a slider that breaks down and away from a right-handed hitter at 80-83 mph. 
Lincecum is known for his long stride, unorthodox mechanics, and ability 
to generate high velocity despite his slight build: originally listed as 
5 ft 11 in (1.80 m)[83] and 170 pounds. Lincecum was nicknamed "The Freak" 
by his Washington teammates because of his athletic abilities.[84] His 
fastball velocity is down from his early years – it topped out at 99 mph 
in his first two MLB seasons but maxes out at low-90s mph now.[81] After 
having hip surgery in September 2015 and 6 months of rigorous rehab, Lincecum's 
velocity was clocked at 92 mph (he topped 90 mph on his fastball due to 
hip injury in 2015[81]). Lincecum's mother, Rebecca Asis, is the daughter 
of Filipino immigrants.[96] Lincecum's father, Chris Lincecum, worked at 
Boeing and Tim held out for a large signing bonus so his father could retire.[6] 
Chris was largely responsible for his son's interest in baseball at a young 
age, and taught Tim his unique and extravagant windup. He has lived in 
Sausalito, California and the Mission District/Potrero Hill area of San 
Francisco, steps away from the old Seals Stadium site, during baseball 
season.[97][98] During the off season, he lives in Seattle, Washington.[99] 
He has owned property in Paradise Valley, Arizona.[100] He has a French 
bulldog named Cy.[101] Lincecum has been described as the most beloved 
San Francisco sports figure "since Joe Montana", by the Sacramento Bee. 
Because of his "small size and unorthodox pitching delivery, he is an unlikely 
figure to have reached the pinnacle of his sport", which the Bee believes 
reflects the success of the Giants.[102] Fox Sports calls him a "local 
legend and crowd favorite, now and forever."[103] A 2010 This is SportsCenter 
commercial features Lincecum attempting to record a voicemail greeting 
on his phone, telling callers that they have reached "The Freak, The Franchise, 
The Freaky Franchise," and "Big Time Timmy Jim," but being dissatisfied 
with all. Finally, he decides to record one beginning simply "This is Tim 
Lincecum" – only to be interrupted by Karl Ravech walking by and saying 
"Hey, Big Time Timmy Jim!" [104] A follow-up ad features Lincecum dunking
