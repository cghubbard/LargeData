As manager As coach Terry Lee Collins (born May 27, 1949) is an American 
professional baseball manager for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). A former Minor League Baseball shortstop, Collins has managed the 
Albuquerque Dukes of the Pacific Coast League and the Buffalo Bisons of 
the International League at the minor league level, and the Duluth Huskies 
of the Northwoods League at the summer collegiate league level. In 1994, 
he made his MLB managerial debut with the Houston Astros. He also managed 
the Anaheim Angels. Collins is known as a "feisty and intense manager."[1] 
Collins attended college at Eastern Michigan University from 1968–1971, 
where he played shortstop. In each of the four years he attended Eastern 
Michigan, Collins led the team in steals. He was on the Eastern Michigan 
team that won the NAIA national championship in 1971, at which he won the 
honor of Outstanding Defensive Player of the Tournament. Collins was inducted 
into the Eastern Michigan University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994. In 
1971, Collins was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates.[2] During a 10-year 
playing career, he played from 1970-1978 and in 1980 and 1984 in the Pittsburgh 
Pirates and Los Angeles Dodgers organizations. However, he never broke 
into the big leagues.[3] Collins batted left-handed and threw right-handed 
and stood 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) tall. He compiled a batting average of .255 
in 671 games played.[4] In 1981, Collins began his managing career as pilot 
of the Dodgers' Class-A Lodi affiliate in the California League. In 1983, 
he managed the Albuquerque Dukes, the Dodgers' AAA affiliate also in winter 
to Mayos de Navojoa in the Mexican Pacific League, where in 1987, he won 
the PCL championship. He also led the Tigres de Licey to a victory in the 
1984 Caribbean Series. He managed three years in Buffalo, the Pirates' 
AAA affiliate, winning 246 games in the process.[5] He was promoted to 
bullpen coach for the Pirates in 1992, where he coached until the end of 
the 1993 season.[6][7] In honor of his achievements in Buffalo, he was 
inducted into the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992.[8] Terry is also 
a member of the Albuquerque Baseball Hall of Fame.[citation needed] After 
the 1993 season, the Houston Astros fired manager Art Howe because the 
owner did not favor Howe's "deliberate style."[7] Astros General Manager 
Bob Watson replaced him with Collins,[7] who never had a losing season 
in his three years there. The Astros finished second all three years.[9] 
He was dismissed at the end of the 1996 season, after the Astros suffered 
a late-season collapse.[9] In 1995, Collins was a coach at the All-Star 
Game.[10] He finished his Astros career with a 224–197 record.[11] Baseball 
analyst Joe Morgan suggests that Collins was partly to blame for the Astros 
failure to make the playoffs.[12] Morgan wrote in 1999: Adversity is part 
of baseball; if a manager can't cope with it his team will suffer. Terry 
Collins, the skipper of the Anaheim Angels learned this lesson when he 
was with Houston. The Astros were a talented team when Collins was there 
(1994–96). They finished second three times, but failed to make the playoffs 
because their manager exerted too much pressure on them. He was so uptight, 
his players thought each pitch was life-or-death. It wasn't anything Terry 
said; it was his demeanor. Collins was edgy in the dugout during games, 
always looking like someone who was just waiting for disaster to strike. 
At the moment anything actually went wrong you could smell the panic in 
him. Players picked up on that. To alleviate the tension the manager was 
bringing to the clubhouse, they put added pressure on themselves to perform 
well, which invariably choked off their natural abilities so that they 
can't play their best. It's no coincidence that the Astros became a post-season 
participant once Houston replaced Collins with Larry Dierker. I don't know 
if Larry knows more about baseball than Collins, but he does have a laid-back 
attitude that immediately puts his players at ease. Dierker kept the pressure 
off the team by reminding them that while the goal of winning is serious, 
the game is still essentially supposed to be fun. (By the way, I have been 
watching Collins since he joined the Angels and he's a much more laid-back 
skipper. When I complimented him on this change, he said former Angel infielder-outfielder 
Tony Phillips had spoken to him about relaxing more and that it has really 
made an impression.)[12] Less than a month after being dismissed by the 
Astros, Collins was hired as manager of the Anaheim Angels for the 1997 
season.[9] His first two years with the Angels also produced winning records 
and second-place finishes. In 1999, the Angels were hampered by injuries[citation 
needed] and Collins resigned with 29 games left in the season. He apparently 
received a vote of confidence from the front office, but the players had 
petitioned GM Bill Bavasi to fire him.[2] He finished his Angels career 
with a 220–237 record.[11] At the end of the 2006 season, Collins signed 
a two-year deal to manage the Orix Buffaloes of the Pacific League in Japan.[2] 
Terry resigned as manager of the Buffaloes on May 21, 2008 after a 7–3 
inter-league loss to the Hanshin Tigers.[2] Orix were in 5th place in the 
Pacific League with a 21–28 record, despite investments in players such 
as Alex Cabrera in the prior off-season. Injuries to the Buffaloes pitching 
staff certainly didn't help Collins' situation.[citation needed] However, 
the Buffaloes bounced back and finished second by the end of the season. 
Collins became the manager of the China national baseball team at the end 
of the year, in time for the 2009 World Baseball Classic. On July 20, 2009, 
the Duluth Huskies of the Northwoods League announced that Collins would 
manage the team for the rest of the season after firing their field manager 
a few days prior.[13] Collins spent the 2010 season as the minor-league 
field coordinator for the New York Mets organization.[14] Collins was introduced 
as Mets manager on November 23, 2010, signing a two-year deal.[15] Collins 
wears number 10 to honor his managing mentor and friend Jim Leyland of 
the Detroit Tigers.[6][15] Collins served on Leyland's coaching staff when 
he was manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1992 and 1993.[6] On September 
27, 2011, the Mets announced that they would pick up Collins' option for 
the 2013 season.[16] In 2012, after the Mets 46–40 record at the All-Star 
Break, Tony La Russa selected Collins as one of his coaches to the 2012 
All-Star Game. In 2013, Bruce Bochy selected Collins as one of his coaches 
to the 2013 All-Star Game at Citi Field.[17] At the end of September 2013, 
Collins agreed to a two-year extension with the Mets with a club option 
for 2016.[18] When Jim Leyland retired in October 2013, Collins became 
the oldest active manager in Major League Baseball.[19] On June 16, 2015, 
Collins won his 340th game as Mets manager, passing Gil Hodges for the 
third most in franchise history.[20] On September 26, 2015, the Mets defeated 
the Cincinnati Reds 10–2 to clinch the National League East. It was the 
first time Collins ever clinched a playoff berth as a manager. On October 
15, 2015, the Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to advance to Collins's 
first ever NLCS appearance.[21] On October 21, 2015, the Mets defeated 
the Chicago Cubs to advance to the 2015 World Series versus the Kansas 
City Royals. On November 2, the Royals won game 5 in Citi Field to defeat 
the Mets and win the World Series, 4 games to 1. Collins made the decision 
to leave starter Matt Harvey in the game for the ninth inning with the 
Mets holding a 2-0 lead. Harvey gave up 2 earned runs in the inning to 
allow the Royals to tie the game, leading to questions about Collins's 
strategy.[22] In 2015, Collins won the National League Sporting News Manager 
of the Year Award.[23] Collins recorded his 468th loss as Mets manager 
on August 3, 2016 at New Yankee Stadium, making him the losingest manager
