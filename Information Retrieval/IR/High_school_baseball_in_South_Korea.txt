In Korea, high school baseball (고등학교 야구) is played at a very high level 
by students who train year round. Unlike in Japan or the U.S. where nearly 
every high school fields a team, there are only about 60-70[1] Korean high 
school baseball teams which makes the competition tantamount to an all-star 
league of Korea's young talent. KBO, MLB and NPB scouts are frequently 
in attendance at all of the five national high school baseball tournaments. 
The five Big 5 tournaments are the most important high school baseball 
events of the year in terms of tradition, prize-money awarded, and public 
attention. There used to be four lower-level high school baseball events 
of the year sponsored by local cities. However, these local tournaments 
have been replaced with the High School Weekend League after the 2010 season.
