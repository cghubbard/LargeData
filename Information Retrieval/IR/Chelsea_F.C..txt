Chelsea Football Club (/ˈtʃɛlsiː/) is an English professional football 
club based in Fulham, London, that competes in the Premier League. Founded 
in 1905, the club's home ground since then has been Stamford Bridge.[4] 
Chelsea had their first major success in 1955, when they won the league 
championship. They then won various cup competitions between 1965 and 1996. 
The club's greatest period of success has come during the last two decades; 
winning 21 trophies since 1997.[5] Chelsea have won five national league 
titles, seven FA Cups, five League Cups and four FA Community Shields, 
one UEFA Champions League, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, one UEFA Europa 
League and one UEFA Super Cup. Chelsea are the only London club to win 
the UEFA Champions League,[6] and one of four clubs, and the only British 
club, to have won all three main UEFA club competitions.[7][8] Chelsea's 
regular kit colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks. 
The club's crest has been changed several times in attempts to re-brand 
the club and modernise its image. The current crest, featuring a ceremonial 
lion rampant regardant holding a staff, is a modification of the one introduced 
in the early 1950s.[9] The club have the sixth-highest average all-time 
attendance in English football.[10] Their average home gate for the 2015–16 
season was 41,500, the seventh highest in the Premier League.[11] Since 
2003, Chelsea have been owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.[12] 
In 2016, they were ranked by Forbes magazine as the seventh most valuable 
football club in the world, at £1.15 billion ($1.66 billion).[13] In 1904, 
Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the aim of 
turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham 
was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. 
As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the 
adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington 
FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered.[14] Chelsea 
were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's 
Hook),[2][15] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham 
Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards. The club 
won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed 
between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached 
the 1915 FA Cup Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, 
and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league 
campaign to that point.[16] Chelsea attracted large crowds[17] and had 
a reputation for signing big-name players,[18] but success continued to 
elude the club in the inter-war years. Former Arsenal and England centre-forward 
Ted Drake became manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He 
removed the club's Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and 
training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions 
and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success 
– the League championship – in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create 
the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League 
and the FA Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before 
it started.[19] Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the 
remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced 
by player-coach Tommy Docherty. Docherty built a new team around the group 
of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up and Chelsea 
challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. 
They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going 
into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but 
faltering late on in the other two.[20] In three seasons the side were 
beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's 
successor, Dave Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in 1970, beating Leeds United 
2–1 in a final replay. Chelsea took their first European honour, a UEFA 
Cup Winners' Cup triumph, the following year, with another replayed win, 
this time over Real Madrid in Athens. The late 1970s through to the '80s 
was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford 
Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,[21] star players 
were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by 
a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to plague the 
club throughout the decade.[22] In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of 
their fortunes, acquired by Ken Bates for the nominal sum of £1, although 
by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, 
meaning the club faced losing their home.[23] On the pitch, the team had 
fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for 
the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive 
new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 
and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated 
again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second 
Division championship in 1988–89. After a long-running legal battle, Bates 
reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with 
the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market 
crash.[24] Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although 
they did reach the 1994 FA Cup Final with Glenn Hoddle. It was not until 
the appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager in 1996 that their fortunes 
changed. He added several top international players to the side, as the 
club won the FA Cup in 1997 and established themselves as one of England's 
top sides again. Gullit was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, who led the team 
to victory in the League Cup Final, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final and 
the UEFA Super Cup in 1998, the FA Cup in 2000 and their first appearance 
in the UEFA Champions League. Vialli was sacked in favour of Claudio Ranieri, 
who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup Final and Champions League qualification 
in 2002–03. In June 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to Russian billionaire Roman 
Abramovich for £140 million.[12] Over £100 million was spent on new players, 
but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies,[25] and was replaced by 
José Mourinho.[26] Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team 
to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War (2004–05 
and 2005–06),[27] in addition to winning an FA Cup (2007) and two League 
Cups (2005 and 2007). Mourinho was replaced by Avram Grant,[28] who led 
the club to their first UEFA Champions League final, which they lost on 
penalties to Manchester United. In 2009, Guus Hiddink guided Chelsea to 
another FA Cup success.[29] In 2009–10, his successor Carlo Ancelotti led 
them to their first Premier League and FA Cup "Double", and becoming the 
first English top-flight club to score 100 league goals in a season since 
1963.[30] In 2012, caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo led Chelsea to their 
seventh FA Cup,[31] and their first UEFA Champions League title, beating 
Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties,[32] the first London club to win the trophy.[32] 
In 2013, interim manager Rafael Benítez guided Chelsea to win the UEFA 
Europa League against Benfica,[33] becoming the first club to hold two 
major European titles simultaneously and one of four clubs, and the only 
British club, to have won all three of UEFA's major club competitions.[34] 
In the summer of 2013, Mourinho returned as manager, leading Chelsea to 
League Cup success in March 2015,[35] and their fifth league title two 
months later.[36] Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, 
where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened 
on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence it was used 
almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics 
meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by 
businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby 
land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football 
matches on the now 12.5 acre (51,000 m²) site.[37] Stamford Bridge was 
designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald 
Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park.[38] 
Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which 
to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge. Starting with an 
open bowl-like design and one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an original 
capacity of around 100,000.[37] The early 1930s saw the construction of 
a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around 
one fifth of the stand. It eventually became known as the "Shed End", the 
home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during 
the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, but 
the fact that the roof looked like a corrugated iron shed roof played a 
part.[37] In the early 1970s, the club's owners announced a modernisation 
of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater 
stadium.[37] Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset 
with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close 
to bankruptcy, culminating in the freehold being sold to property developers. 
Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's 
future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.[37] The 
north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater 
stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001. When 
Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the Bates era many additional features 
were added to the complex including two hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, 
the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea 
World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra 
revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less 
successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt 
taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the 
takeover a decision was taken to drop the "Chelsea Village" brand and refocus 
on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still 
referred to as part of "Chelsea Village" or "The Village". The Stamford 
Bridge freehold, the pitch, the turnstiles and Chelsea's naming rights 
are now owned by Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which 
fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could 
never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea 
FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, 
which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change 
their name.[39] Chelsea's training ground is located in Cobham, Surrey. 
Chelsea moved to Cobham in 2004. Their previous training ground in Harlington 
was taken over by QPR in 2005.[40] The new training facilities in Cobham 
were completed in 2007.[41] Stamford Bridge has been used for a variety 
of other sporting events since 1905. It hosted the FA Cup Final from 1920 
to 1922,[42] has held ten FA Cup semi-finals (most recently in 1978), ten 
FA Charity Shield matches (the last in 1970), and three England international 
matches, the last in 1932; it was also the venue for an unofficial Victory 
International in 1946.[43] The 2013 UEFA Women's Champions League Final 
was played at Stamford Bridge.[44] In October 1905 it hosted a rugby union 
match between the All Blacks and Middlesex,[45] and in 1914 hosted a baseball 
match between the touring New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox.[46] 
It was the venue for a boxing match between world flyweight champion Jimmy 
Wilde and Joe Conn in 1918.[47] The running track was used for dirt track 
racing between 1928 and 1932,[48] greyhound racing from 1933 to 1968, and 
Midget car racing in 1948.[49] In 1980, Stamford Bridge hosted the first 
international floodlit cricket match in the UK, between Essex and the West 
Indies.[50] It was also the home stadium of the London Monarchs American 
Football team for the 1997 season.[51] The current club ownership have 
stated that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea to stay 
competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such 
as Arsenal and Manchester United.[52] Owing to its location next to a main 
road and two railway lines, fans can only enter the ground via the Fulham 
Road exits, which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety 
regulations.[53] The club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep 
Chelsea at their current home,[54][55][56] but have nonetheless been linked 
with a move to various nearby sites, including the Earls Court Exhibition 
Centre, Battersea Power Station and the Chelsea Barracks.[57] In October 
2011, a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on 
which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders.[58] 
In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase Battersea Power Station, 
with a view to developing the site into a new stadium,[59] but lost out 
to a Malaysian consortium.[60] The club subsequently announced plans to 
redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000-seater stadium.[61] Chelsea have 
had four main crests, which all underwent minor variations. The first, 
adopted when the club was founded, was the image of a Chelsea pensioner, 
the army veterans who reside at the nearby Royal Hospital Chelsea. This 
contributed to the club's original "pensioner" nickname, and remained for 
the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. When Ted 
Drake became Chelsea manager in 1952, he began to modernise the club. Believing 
the Chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned, he insisted that it be 
replaced.[62] A stop-gap badge which comprised the initials C.F.C. was 
adopted for a year. In 1953, the club crest was changed to an upright blue 
lion looking backwards and holding a staff. It was based on elements in 
the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea[63] with the "lion 
rampant regardant" taken from the arms of then club president Viscount 
Chelsea and the staff from the Abbots of Westminster, former Lords of the 
Manor of Chelsea. It also featured three red roses, to represent England, 
and two footballs.[62] This was the first Chelsea crest to appear on the 
shirts, in the early 1960s. In 1986, with Ken Bates now owner of the club, 
Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise 
and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked.[64] The 
new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and 
not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 
years, with some modifications such as the use of different colours, including 
red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white 
returned.[65] With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the club's 
centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 
1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed 
again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 
2005–06 season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 
to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary 
season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' 
on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.[9] Chelsea have always 
worn blue shirts, although they originally used the paler eton blue, which 
was taken from the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, 
and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks.[66] The light 
blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912.[67] In 
the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching 
to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing 
it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other 
major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 
season.[68] Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their 
home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were 
reintroduced. Chelsea's away colours are usually all yellow or all white 
with blue trim. More recently, the club have had a number of black or dark 
blue away kits.[69] As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual 
ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue 
and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit.[70] In the mid-1970s, the 
away strip was a red, white and green kit inspired by the Hungarian national 
side of the 1950s.[71] Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip 
worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and tangerine 
from 1994–96, and luminous yellow from 2007–08.[69] The graphite and tangerine 
strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.[72][73] Chelsea 
are one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world.[74][75] 
They have the sixth highest average all-time attendance in English football[10] 
and regularly attract over 40,000 fans to Stamford Bridge; they were the 
seventh best-supported Premier League team in the 2013–14 season, with 
an average gate of 41,572.[11] Chelsea's traditional fanbase comes from 
all over the Greater London area including working-class parts such as 
Hammersmith and Battersea, wealthier areas like Chelsea and Kensington, 
and from the home counties. There are also numerous official supporters 
clubs in the United Kingdom and all over the world.[76] Between 2007 and 
2012, Chelsea were ranked fourth worldwide in annual replica kit sales, 
with an average of 910,000.[77] Chelsea's official Twitter account has 
6.29 million followers, the fifth highest among football clubs.[78] At 
matches, Chelsea fans sing chants such as "Carefree" (to the tune of "Lord 
of the Dance", whose lyrics were probably written by supporter Mick Greenaway[79][80]), 
"Ten Men Went to Mow", "We All Follow the Chelsea" (to the tune of "Land 
of Hope and Glory"), "Zigga Zagga", and the celebratory "Celery", with 
the latter often resulting in fans ritually throwing celery. The vegetable 
was banned inside Stamford Bridge after an incident involving Arsenal midfielder 
Cesc Fàbregas at the 2007 League Cup Final.[81] During the 1970s and 1980s 
in particular, Chelsea supporters were associated with football hooliganism. 
The club's "football firm", originally known as the Chelsea Shed Boys, 
and subsequently as the Chelsea Headhunters, were nationally notorious 
for football violence, alongside hooligan firms from other clubs such as 
West Ham United's Inter City Firm and Millwall's Bushwackers, before, during 
and after matches.[82] The increase of hooligan incidents in the 1980s 
led chairman Ken Bates to propose erecting an electric fence to deter them 
from invading the pitch, a proposal that the Greater London Council rejected.[83] 
Since the 1990s, there has been a marked decline in crowd trouble at matches, 
as a result of stricter policing, CCTV in grounds and the advent of all-seater 
stadia.[84] In 2007, the club launched the 'Back to the Shed' campaign 
to improve the atmosphere at home matches, with notable success. According 
to Home Office statistics, 126 Chelsea fans were arrested for football-related 
offences during the 2009–10 season, the third highest in the division, 
and 27 banning orders were issued, the fifth-highest in the division.[85] 
Chelsea have long-standing rivalries with North London clubs Arsenal and 
Tottenham Hotspur.[86][87] A strong rivalry with Leeds United dates back 
to several heated and controversial matches in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly 
the 1970 FA Cup Final.[88] More recently a rivalry with Liverpool has grown 
following repeated clashes in cup competitions.[89][90] Chelsea's fellow 
West London sides Brentford, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers are generally 
not considered major rivals, as matches have only taken place intermittently 
due to the clubs often being in separate divisions.[91] A 2004 survey by 
Planetfootball.com found that Chelsea fans consider their main rivalries 
to be with (in order): Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. 
In the same survey, fans of six clubs (Arsenal, Fulham, Leeds United, QPR, 
Tottenham and West Ham United) named Chelsea as one of their three main 
rivals.[92] In a 2008 poll conducted by the Football Fans Census, Chelsea 
fans named Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United as their most disliked 
clubs.[93] Chelsea's highest appearance-maker is ex-captain Ron Harris, 
who played in 795 competitive games for the club between 1961 and 1980.[94] 
The record for a Chelsea goalkeeper is held by Harris's contemporary, Peter 
Bonetti, who made 729 appearances (1959–79). With 103 caps (101 while at 
the club), Frank Lampard of England is Chelsea's most capped international 
player. Frank Lampard is Chelsea's all-time top goalscorer, with 211 goals 
in 648 games (2001–2014);[94] he passed Bobby Tambling's longstanding record 
of 202 in May 2013.[95] Seven other players have also scored over 100 goals 
for Chelsea: George Hilsdon (1906–12), George Mills (1929–39), Roy Bentley 
(1948–56), Jimmy Greaves (1957–61), Peter Osgood (1964–74 and 1978–79), 
Kerry Dixon (1983–92) and Didier Drogba (2004–12 and 2014–2015). Greaves 
holds the record for the most goals scored in one season (43 in 1960–61).[96] 
Chelsea's biggest winning scoreline in a competitive match is 13–0, achieved 
against Jeunesse Hautcharage in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971.[97] The club's 
biggest top-flight win was an 8–0 victory against Wigan Athletic in 2010, 
which was matched in 2012 against Aston Villa.[98] Chelsea's biggest loss 
was an 8–1 reverse against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1953.[99][100] Officially, 
Chelsea's highest home attendance is 82,905 for a First Division match 
against Arsenal on 12 October 1935. However, an estimated crowd of over 
100,000 attended a friendly match against Soviet team Dynamo Moscow on 
13 November 1945.[101][102] The modernisation of Stamford Bridge during 
the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands mean that neither record 
will be broken for the foreseeable future. The current legal capacity of 
Stamford Bridge is 41,837.[4] Every starting player in Chelsea's 57 games 
of the 2013–14 season was a full international – a new club record.[103] 
Chelsea hold the English record for the highest ever points total for a 
league season (95), the fewest goals conceded during a league season (15), 
the highest number of Premier League victories in a season (29), the highest 
number of clean sheets overall in a Premier League season (25) (all set 
during the 2004–05 season),[104] and the most consecutive clean sheets 
from the start of a league season (6, set during the 2005–06 season).[105] 
The club's 21–0 aggregate victory over Jeunesse Hautcharage in the UEFA 
Cup Winners' Cup in 1971 remains a record in European competition.[106] 
Chelsea hold the record for the longest streak of unbeaten matches at home 
in the English top flight, which lasted 86 matches from 20 March 2004 to 
26 October 2008. They secured the record on 12 August 2007, beating the 
previous record of 63 matches unbeaten set by Liverpool between 1978 and 
1980.[107][108] Chelsea's streak of eleven consecutive away league wins, 
set between 5 April 2008 and 6 December 2008, is also a record for the 
English top flight.[109] Their £50 million purchase of Fernando Torres 
from Liverpool in January 2011 was the record transfer fee paid by a British 
club[110] until Ángel Di María signed for Manchester United in August 2014 
for £59.7 million.[111] Chelsea, along with Arsenal, were the first club 
to play with shirt numbers, on 25 August 1928 in their match against Swansea 
Town.[112] They were the first English side to travel by aeroplane to a 
domestic away match, when they visited Newcastle United on 19 April 1957,[113] 
and the first First Division side to play a match on a Sunday, when they 
faced Stoke City on 27 January 1974. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became 
the first British side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up (no 
British or Irish players) in a Premier League match against Southampton.[114] 
In May 2007, Chelsea were the first team to win the FA Cup at the new Wembley 
Stadium, having also been the last to win it at the old Wembley.[115] They 
were the first English club to be ranked #1 under UEFA's five-year coefficient 
system in the 21st century.[116] They were the first team in Premier League 
history to score at least 100 goals in a single season, reaching the milestone 
on the final day of the 2009–10 season.[30] Chelsea are the only London 
club to win the UEFA Champions League, after beating Bayern Munich in the 
2012 final.[6][117] Upon winning the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, Chelsea 
became the first English club to win all four European trophies and the 
only club to hold the Champions League and the Europa League at the same 
time.[118] Chelsea Football Club were founded by Gus Mears in 1905. After 
his death in 1912, his descendents continued to own the club until 1982, 
when Ken Bates bought the club from Mears' great-nephew Brian Mears for 
£1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on 
the AIM stock exchange in March 1996.[119] In July 2003, Roman Abramovich 
purchased just over 50% of Chelsea Village plc's share capital, including 
Bates' 29.5% stake, for £30 million and over the following weeks bought 
out most of the remaining 12,000 shareholders at 35 pence per share, completing 
a £140 million takeover. Other shareholders at the time of the takeover 
included the Matthew Harding estate (21%), BSkyB (9.9%) and various anonymous 
offshore trusts.[120] After passing the 90% share threshold, Abramovich 
took the club back into private hands, delisting it from the AIM on 22 
August 2003. He also took on responsibility for the club's debt of £80 
million, quickly paying most of it.[121] Thereafter, Abramovich changed 
the ownership name to Chelsea FC plc, whose ultimate parent company is 
Fordstam Limited, which is controlled by him.[122] Chelsea are additionally 
funded by Abramovich via interest free soft loans channelled through his 
holding company Fordstam Limited. The loans stood at £709 million in December 
2009, when they were all converted to equity by Abramovich, leaving the 
club themselves debt free,[123][124] although the debt remains with Fordstam.[125] 
Since 2008 the club have had no external debt.[126] Chelsea did not turn 
a profit in the first nine years of Abramovich's ownership, and made record 
losses of £140m in June 2005.[127] In November 2012, Chelsea announced 
a profit of £1.4 million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first time 
the club had made a profit under Abramovich's ownership.[127][128] This 
was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever profit of £18.4 
million for the year to June 2014.[129] Chelsea have been described as 
a global brand; a 2012 report by Brand Finance ranked Chelsea fifth among 
football brands and valued the club's brand value at US $398 million – 
an increase of 27% from the previous year, also valuing them at US $10 million 
more than the sixth best brand, London rivals Arsenal – and gave the brand 
a strength rating of AA (very strong).[130][131] In 2016, Forbes magazine 
ranked Chelsea the seventh most valuable football club in the world, at 
£1.15 billion ($1.66 billion).[13] As of 2016, Chelsea are ranked eighth 
in the Deloitte Football Money League with an annual commercial revenue 
of £322.59 million.[132] Chelsea's kit has been manufactured by Adidas 
since 2006, which is contracted to supply the club's kit from 2006 to 2018. 
The partnership was extended in October 2010 in a deal worth £160 million 
over eight years.[133] This deal was again extended in June 2013 in a deal 
worth £300 million over another ten years.[134][135] Previously, the kit 
was manufactured by Umbro (1975–81), Le Coq Sportif (1981–86), The Chelsea 
Collection (1986–87) and Umbro again (1987–2006). Chelsea's first shirt 
sponsor was Gulf Air, agreed during the 1983–84 season. The club were then 
sponsored by Grange Farms, Bai Lin Tea and Simod before a long-term deal 
was signed with Commodore International in 1989; Amiga, an offshoot of 
Commodore, also appeared on the shirts. Chelsea were subsequently sponsored 
by Coors beer (1994–97), Autoglass (1997–2001), Emirates (2001–05), Samsung 
Mobile (2005–08) and Samsung (2008–15).[136][137] Chelsea's current shirt 
sponsor is the Yokohama Rubber Company. Worth £40 million-per-year, the 
deal is second in English football to Chevrolet's £50 million-per-year 
sponsorship of Manchester United.[136] The club has a variety of other 
sponsors and official partners, which include Gazprom,[138] Delta Air Lines,[139] 
Sauber, Audi, Singha, EA Sports, Dolce & Gabbana,[140] Barbados Tourism 
Authority, Atlas, AZIMUT Hotels, BNI, Indosat, Vietinbank, Nitto Tire, 
Orico, Guangzhou R&F, Coca-Cola, Grand Royal, Digicel, Lucozade Sport, 
and Viagogo.[141] In 1930, Chelsea featured in one of the earliest football 
films, The Great Game.[142] One-time Chelsea centre forward, Jack Cock, 
who by then was playing for Millwall, was the star of the film and several 
scenes were shot at Stamford Bridge, including the pitch, the boardroom, 
and the dressing rooms. It included guest appearances by then-Chelsea players 
Andrew Wilson, George Mills, and Sam Millington.[143] Owing to the notoriety 
of the Chelsea Headhunters, a football firm associated with the club, Chelsea 
have also featured in films about football hooliganism, including 2004's 
The Football Factory.[144] Chelsea also appear in the Hindi film Jhoom 
Barabar Jhoom.[145] In April 2011, Montenegrin comedy series Nijesmo mi 
od juče made an episode in which Chelsea play against FK Sutjeska Nikšić 
for qualification of the UEFA Champions League.[146] Up until the 1950s, 
the club had a long-running association with the music halls; their underachievement 
often provided material for comedians such as George Robey.[147] It culminated 
in comedian Norman Long's release of a comic song in 1933, ironically titled 
"On the Day That Chelsea Went and Won the Cup", the lyrics of which describe 
a series of bizarre and improbable occurrences on the hypothetical day 
when Chelsea finally won a trophy.[18] In Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film 
The 39 Steps, Mr Memory claims that Chelsea last won the Cup in 63 BC, 
"in the presence of the Emperor Nero."[148] Scenes in a 1980 episode of 
Minder were filmed during a real match at Stamford Bridge between Chelsea 
and Preston North End with Terry McCann (played by Dennis Waterman) standing 
on the terraces.[149] The song "Blue is the Colour" was released as a single 
in the build-up to the 1972 League Cup Final, with all members of Chelsea's 
first team squad singing; it reached number five in the UK Singles Chart.[150] 
The song has since been adopted as an anthem by a number of other sports 
teams around the world, including the Vancouver Whitecaps (as "White is 
the Colour")[151] and the Saskatchewan Roughriders (as "Green is the Colour").[152] 
In the build-up to the 1997 FA Cup Final, the song "Blue Day", performed 
by Suggs and members of the Chelsea squad, reached number 22 in the UK 
charts.[153] Bryan Adams, a fan of Chelsea,[154] dedicated the song "We're 
Gonna Win" from the album 18 Til I Die to the club.[155] Chelsea also operate 
a women's football team, Chelsea Ladies. They have been affiliated to the 
men's team since 2004[156] and are part of the club's Community Development 
programme. They play their home games at Wheatsheaf Park, the home ground 
of Conference South club Staines Town.[157] The club were promoted to the 
Premier Division for the first time in 2005 as Southern Division champions 
and won the Surrey County Cup in 2003–04, 2006–10, 2012, and 2013.[158] 
In 2010 Chelsea Ladies were one of the eight founder members of the FA 
Women's Super League.[159] In 2015, Chelsea Ladies won the FA Women's Cup 
for the first time, beating Notts County Ladies at Wembley Stadium,[160] 
and a month later clinched their first FA WSL title to complete a league 
and cup double.[161] John Terry, the current captain of the Chelsea men's 
team, is the President of Chelsea Ladies.[162] Note: Flags indicate national
