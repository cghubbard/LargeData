Ohio i/oʊˈhaɪ.oʊ/ is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the 
United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, 
and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's 
capital and largest city is Columbus. The state takes its name from the 
Ohio River. The name originated from the Iroquois word ohi-yo’, meaning 
"great river" or "large creek".[20][21][22] Partitioned from the Northwest 
Territory, the state was admitted to the Union as the 17th state (and the 
first under the Northwest Ordinance) on March 1, 1803.[9][23] Ohio is historically 
known as the "Buckeye State" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans 
are also known as "Buckeyes".[2] The government of Ohio is composed of 
the executive branch, led by the Governor; the legislative branch, which 
comprises the Ohio General Assembly; and the judicial branch, which is 
led by the state Supreme Court. Ohio occupies 16 seats in the United States 
House of Representatives.[24] Ohio is known for its status as both a swing 
state[25] and a bellwether[25] in national elections. Six Presidents of 
the United States have been elected who had Ohio as their home state. Ohio's 
geographic location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion. 
Because Ohio links the Northeast to the Midwest, much cargo and business 
traffic passes through its borders along its well-developed highways. Ohio 
has the nation's 10th largest highway network, and is within a one-day 
drive of 50% of North America's population and 70% of North America's manufacturing 
capacity.[26] To the north, Lake Erie gives Ohio 312 miles (502 km) of 
coastline,[27] which allows for numerous cargo ports. Ohio's southern border 
is defined by the Ohio River (with the border being at the 1792 low-water 
mark on the north side of the river),[28] and much of the northern border 
is defined by Lake Erie. Ohio's neighbors are Pennsylvania to the east, 
Michigan to the northwest, Ontario Canada, to the north, Indiana to the 
west, Kentucky on the south, and West Virginia on the southeast. Ohio's 
borders were defined by metes and bounds in the Enabling Act of 1802 as 
follows: Bounded on the east by the Pennsylvania line, on the south by 
the Ohio River, to the mouth of the Great Miami River, on the west by the 
line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami aforesaid, and on 
the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme 
of Lake Michigan, running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid, 
from the mouth of the Great Miami until it shall intersect Lake Erie or 
the territorial line, and thence with the same through Lake Erie to the 
Pennsylvania line aforesaid. Ohio is bounded by the Ohio River, but nearly 
all of the river itself belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia. In 1980, 
the U.S. Supreme Court held that, based on the wording of the cessation 
of territory by Virginia (which at that time included what is now Kentucky 
and West Virginia), the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky (and, by implication, 
West Virginia) is the northern low-water mark of the river as it existed 
in 1792.[28] Ohio has only that portion of the river between the river's 
1792 low-water mark and the present high-water mark. The border with Michigan 
has also changed, as a result of the Toledo War, to angle slightly northeast 
to the north shore of the mouth of the Maumee River. Much of Ohio features 
glaciated plains, with an exceptionally flat area in the northwest being 
known as the Great Black Swamp. This glaciated region in the northwest 
and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first by a belt 
known as the glaciated Allegheny Plateau, and then by another belt known 
as the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau. Most of Ohio is of low relief, but 
the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau features rugged hills and forests. The 
rugged southeastern quadrant of Ohio, stretching in an outward bow-like 
arc along the Ohio River from the West Virginia Panhandle to the outskirts 
of Cincinnati, forms a distinct socio-economic unit. Geologically similar 
to parts of West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, this area's coal 
mining legacy, dependence on small pockets of old manufacturing establishments, 
and distinctive regional dialect set this section off from the rest of 
the state. In 1965 the United States Congress passed the Appalachian Regional 
Development Act, at attempt to "address the persistent poverty and growing 
economic despair of the Appalachian Region."[29] This act defines 29 Ohio 
counties as part of Appalachia.[30] While 1/3 of Ohio's land mass is part 
of the federally defined Appalachian region, only 12.8% of Ohioans live 
there (1.476 million people.)[31] Significant rivers within the state include 
the Cuyahoga River, Great Miami River, Maumee River, Muskingum River, and 
Scioto River. The rivers in the northern part of the state drain into the 
northern Atlantic Ocean via Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence River, and the 
rivers in the southern part of the state drain into the Gulf of Mexico 
via the Ohio River and then the Mississippi. The worst weather disaster 
in Ohio history occurred along the Great Miami River in 1913. Known as 
the Great Dayton Flood, the entire Miami River watershed flooded, including 
the downtown business district of Dayton. As a result, the Miami Conservancy 
District was created as the first major flood plain engineering project 
in Ohio and the United States.[32] Grand Lake St. Marys in the west central 
part of the state was constructed as a supply of water for canals in the 
canal-building era of 1820–1850. For many years this body of water, over 
20 square miles (52 km2), was the largest artificial lake in the world. 
It should be noted that Ohio's canal-building projects were not the economic 
fiasco that similar efforts were in other states. Some cities, such as 
Dayton, owe their industrial emergence to location on canals, and as late 
as 1910 interior canals carried much of the bulk freight of the state. 
The climate of Ohio is a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification 
Dfa/Dfb) throughout most of the state except in the extreme southern counties 
of Ohio's Bluegrass region section which are located on the northern periphery 
of the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and Upland South region of the United 
States. Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state, while 
winters generally range from cool to cold. Precipitation in Ohio is moderate 
year-round. Severe weather is not uncommon in the state, although there 
are typically fewer tornado reports in Ohio than in states located in what 
is known as the Tornado Alley. Severe lake effect snowstorms are also not 
uncommon on the southeast shore of Lake Erie, which is located in an area 
designated as the Snowbelt. Although predominantly not in a subtropical 
climate, some warmer-climate flora and fauna does reach well into Ohio. 
For instance, a number of trees with more southern ranges, such as the 
blackjack oak, Quercus marilandica, are found at their northernmost in 
Ohio just north of the Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition 
from a subtropical to continental climate, several plants such as the Southern 
magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Albizia julibrissin (mimosa), Crape Myrtle, 
and even the occasional Needle Palm are hardy landscape materials regularly 
used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the Bluegrass region of Ohio; 
but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the 
State. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through 
Ohio on Interstate 75 from Cincinnati to Toledo; the observant traveler 
of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's common wall 
lizard, one of the few examples of permanent "subtropical" fauna in Ohio. 
The highest recorded temperature was 113 °F (45 °C), near Gallipolis on 
July 21, 1934.[34] The lowest recorded temperature was −39 °F (−39 °C), 
at Milligan on February 10, 1899,[35] during the Great Blizzard of 1899.[36] 
Although few have registered as noticeable to the average resident, more 
than 30 earthquakes occurred in Ohio between 2002 and 2007, and more than 
200 quakes with a magnitude of 2.0 or higher have occurred since 1776.[37] 
The most substantial known earthquake in Ohio history was the Anna (Shelby 
County) earthquake,[38] which occurred on March 9, 1937. It was centered 
in western Ohio, and had a magnitude of 5.4, and was of intensity VIII.[39] 
Other significant earthquakes in Ohio include:[40] one of magnitude 4.8 
near Lima on September 19, 1884;[41] one of magnitude 4.2 near Portsmouth 
on May 17, 1901;[42] and one of 5.0 in LeRoy Township in Lake County on 
January 31, 1986, which continued to trigger 13 aftershocks of magnitude 
0.5 to 2.4 for two months.[43][44] The most recent earthquake in Ohio of 
any appreciable magnitude occurred on December 31, 2011, at 3:05pm EST. 
It had a magnitude of 4.0, and its epicenter was located approximately 
4 kilometres northwest of Youngstown (41°7′19.1994″N 80°41′2.3994″W﻿ / 
﻿41.121999833°N 80.683999833°W﻿ / 41.121999833; -80.683999833), near the 
Trumbull/Mahoning county border.[45] The Ohio Seismic Network (OhioSeis), 
a group of seismograph stations at several colleges, universities, and 
other institutions, and coordinated by the Division of Geological Survey 
of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,[46] maintains an extensive 
catalog of Ohio earthquakes from 1776 to the present day, as well as earthquakes 
located in other states whose effects were felt in Ohio.[47] Columbus (home 
of The Ohio State University, Franklin University, Capital University, 
and Ohio Dominican University) is the capital of Ohio, near the geographic 
center of the state. Other Ohio cities functioning as centers of United 
States metropolitan areas include: Note: The Cincinnati metropolitan area 
extends into Kentucky and Indiana, the Steubenville metropolitan area extends 
into West Virginia, and the Youngstown metropolitan area extends into Pennsylvania. 
Ohio cities that function as centers of United States micropolitan areas 
include: Archeological evidence suggests that the Ohio Valley was inhabited 
by nomadic people as early as 13,000 BC.[49] These early nomads disappeared 
from Ohio by 1,000 BC, "but their material culture provided a base for 
those who followed them".[attribution needed][49] Between 1,000 and 800 BC, 
the sedentary Adena culture emerged. As Ohio historian George W. Knepper 
notes, this sophisticated culture was "so named because evidences of their 
culture were excavated in 1902 on the grounds of Adena, Thomas Worthington's 
estate located near Chillicothe".[50] The Adena were able to establish 
"semi-permanent" villages because they domesticated plants, which included 
squash, sunflowers, and perhaps corn. Cultivation of these in addition 
to hunting and gathering supported more settled, complex villages.[50] 
The most spectacular remnant of the Adena culture is the Great Serpent 
Mound, located in Adams County, Ohio.[50] Around 100 BC, the Adena were 
joined in Ohio Country by the Hopewell people, who were named for the farm 
owned by Captain M. C. Hopewell, where evidence of their unique culture 
was discovered.[52] Like the Adena, the Hopewell people participated in 
a mound-building culture. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated 
earthworks can be found in modern-day Marietta, Newark, and Circleville.[52] 
The Hopewell, however, disappeared from the Ohio Valley in about 600 AD. 
Little is known about the people who replaced them.[53] Researchers have 
identified two additional, distinct prehistoric cultures: the Fort Ancient 
people and the Whittlesey Focus people.[53] Both cultures apparently disappeared 
in the 17th century, perhaps decimated by infectious diseases spread in 
epidemics from early European contact. The Native Americans had no immunity 
to common European diseases. Some scholars believe that the Fort Ancient 
people "were ancestors of the historic Shawnee people, or that, at the 
very least, the historic Shawnees absorbed remnants of these older peoples."[53] 
There is also fairly good evidence that eastern Siouan nations such as 
the Tutelo and Saponi descend from Indian Knoll, Adena, and Hopewell peoples.[54][55] 
American Indians in the Ohio Valley were greatly affected by the aggressive 
tactics of the Iroquois Confederation, based in central and western New 
York.[56] After the Beaver Wars in the mid-17th century, the Iroquois claimed 
much of the Ohio country as hunting and, more importantly, beaver-trapping 
ground. After the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century, 
which largely emptied the Ohio country of indigenous people by the mid-to-late 
17th century, the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly Algonquian-speaking 
descendants of its ancient inhabitants, that is, descendants of the Adena, 
Hopewell, and Mississippian cultures. Many of these Ohio-country nations 
were multi-ethnic (sometimes multi-linguistic) societies born out of the 
earlier devastation brought about by disease, war, and subsequent social 
instability. They subsisted on agriculture (corn, sunflowers, beans, etc.) 
supplemented by seasonal hunts. By the 18th century, they were part of 
a larger global economy brought about by European entry into the fur trade.[57] 
The indigenous nations to inhabit Ohio in the historical period included 
the Miamis (a large confederation); Wyandots (made up of refugees, especially 
from the fractured Huron confederacy); Delawares (pushed west from their 
historic homeland in New Jersey); Shawnees (also pushed west, although 
they may have been descended from the Fort Ancient people of Ohio); Ottawas 
(more commonly associated with the upper Great Lakes region); Mingos (like 
the Wyandot, a group recently formed of refugees from Iroquois); Eries 
(gradually absorbed into the new, multi-ethnic "republics," namely the 
Wyandot); and eastern Siouan nations such as the Tutelo, Saponi, and the 
Catawba (territory expanded from the Carolina's, into Virginia, and the 
Ohio valley).[58][59][60] Ohio country was also the site of Indian massacres, 
such as the Yellow Creek Massacre, Gnadenhutten and Pontiac's Rebellion 
school massacre.[61] During the 18th century, the French set up a system 
of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region. Beginning in 1754, 
France and Great Britain fought a war that was known in North America as 
the French and Indian War and in Europe as the Seven Years' War. As a result 
of the Treaty of Paris, the French ceded control of Ohio and the remainder 
of the Old Northwest to Great Britain. Pontiac's Rebellion in the 1760s, 
however, posed a challenge to British military control.[62] This came to 
an end with the colonists' victory in the American Revolution. In the Treaty 
of Paris in 1783, Britain ceded all claims to Ohio country to the United 
States. The United States created the Northwest Territory under the Northwest 
Ordinance of 1787.[63] Slavery was not permitted in the new territory. 
Settlement began with the founding of Marietta by the Ohio Company of Associates, 
which had been formed by a group of American Revolutionary War veterans. 
Following the Ohio Company, the Miami Company (also referred to as the 
"Symmes Purchase") claimed the southwestern section, and the Connecticut 
Land Company surveyed and settled the Connecticut Western Reserve in present-day 
Northeast Ohio. The old Northwest Territory originally included areas previously 
known as Ohio Country and Illinois Country. As Ohio prepared for statehood, 
the Indiana Territory was created, reducing the Northwest Territory to 
approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of the 
Lower Peninsula of Michigan and the eastern tip of the Upper Peninsula. 
Under the Northwest Ordinance, areas of the territory could be defined 
and admitted as states once their population reached 60,000. Although Ohio's 
population numbered only 45,000 in December 1801, Congress determined that 
the population was growing rapidly and Ohio could begin the path to statehood. 
The assumption was that it would exceed 60,000 residents by the time it 
was admitted as a state. Furthermore, in regards to the Leni Lenape Native 
Americans living in the region, Congress decided that 10,000 acres on the 
Muskingum River in the present state of Ohio would "be set apart and the 
property thereof be vested in the Moravian Brethren ... or a society of 
the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity".[64] 
On February 19, 1803, US President Thomas Jefferson signed an act of Congress 
that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution.[65] However, Congress 
had never passed a resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. 
The current custom of Congress declaring an official date of statehood 
did not begin until 1812, with Louisiana's admission as the 18th state. 
Although no formal resolution of admission was required, when the oversight 
was discovered in 1953, Ohio congressman George H. Bender introduced a 
bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, 
the date on which the Ohio General Assembly first convened.[66] At a special 
session at the old state capital in Chillicothe, the Ohio state legislature 
approved a new petition for statehood that was delivered to Washington, 
D.C. on horseback. On August 7, 1953 (the year of Ohio's 150th anniversary), 
President Eisenhower signed a congressional joint resolution that officially 
declared March 1, 1803, the date of Ohio's admittance into the Union.[66][67][68] 
Ohio has had three capital cities: Chillicothe, Zanesville, and Columbus. 
Chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810. The capital was then moved 
to Zanesville for two years, as part of a state legislative compromise, 
in order to get a bill passed. The capital was then moved back to Chillicothe, 
which was the capital from 1812 to 1816. Finally, the capital was moved 
to Columbus, in order to have it near the geographic center of the state, 
where it would be more accessible to most citizens. Although many Native 
Americans had migrated west to evade American encroachment, others remained 
settled in the state, sometimes assimilating in part. In 1830 under President 
Andrew Jackson, the US government forced Indian Removal of most tribes 
to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. In 1835, Ohio fought 
with Michigan in the Toledo War, a mostly bloodless boundary war over the 
Toledo Strip. Congress intervened, making Michigan's admittance as a state 
conditional on ending the conflict. In exchange for giving up its claim 
to the Toledo Strip, Michigan was given the western two-thirds of the Upper 
Peninsula, in addition to the eastern third that was already considered 
part of the state. Ohio's central position and its population gave it an 
important place during the Civil War. The Ohio River was a vital artery 
for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio's railroads. Ohio contributed 
more soldiers per-capita than any other state in the Union. In 1862, the 
state's morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the battle of Shiloh, 
a costly victory in which Ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties.[69] Later 
that year, when Confederate troops under the leadership of Stonewall Jackson 
threatened Washington, D.C., Ohio governor David Tod still could recruit 
5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service.[70] Almost 35,000 
Ohioans died in the conflict, and thirty thousand were physically wounded.[71] 
By the end of the Civil War, the Union's top three generals–Ulysses S. 
Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan–were all from Ohio.[72][73] 
In 1912 a Constitutional Convention was held with Charles B. Galbreath 
as secretary. The result reflected the concerns of the Progressive Era. 
It introduced the initiative and the referendum. In addition, it allowed 
the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify 
laws and constitutional amendments originating in the Legislature. Under 
the Jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, 
the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear on Ohio's 
general election ballots every 20 years. The question asks whether a new 
convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 
1972, and 1992, it has never been approved. Instead constitutional amendments 
have been proposed by petition to the legislature hundreds of times and 
adopted in a majority of cases. Eight US Presidents hailed from Ohio at 
the time of their elections, giving rise to its nickname "Mother of Presidents", 
a sobriquet it shares with Virginia. It is also termed "Modern Mother of 
Presidents",[74] in contrast to Virginia's status as the origin of presidents 
earlier in American history. Seven Presidents were born in Ohio, making 
it second to Virginia's eight. Virginia-born William Henry Harrison lived 
most of his life in Ohio and is also buried there. Harrison conducted his 
political career while living on the family compound, founded by his father-in-law, 
John Cleves Symmes, in North Bend, Ohio. The seven presidents born in Ohio 
were Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Benjamin 
Harrison (grandson of William Henry Harrison), William McKinley, William 
Howard Taft and Warren G. Harding. From just over 45,000 residents in 1800, 
Ohio's population grew at rates of over 10% per decade (except for the 
1940 census) until the 1970 census, which recorded just over 10.65 million 
Ohioans.[76] Growth then slowed for the next four decades.[77] The United 
States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Ohio was 11,613,423 
on July 1, 2015, a 0.67% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[6] 
Ohio's population growth lags that of the entire United States, and Caucasians 
are found in a greater density than the United States average. As of 2000[update], 
Ohio's center of population is located in Morrow County,[78] in the county 
seat of Mount Gilead.[79] This is approximately 6,346 feet (1,934 m) south 
and west of Ohio's population center in 1990.[78] As of 2011, 27.6% of 
Ohio's children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups.[80] 6.2% 
of Ohio's population is under 5 years of age, 23.7 percent under 18 years 
of age, and 14.1 percent were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 
51.2 percent of the population. According to the 2010 United States census, 
the racial composition of Ohio was the following:[81][82] In 2010, there 
were 469,700 foreign-born residents in Ohio, corresponding to 4.1% of the 
total population. Of these, 229,049 (2.0%) were naturalized US citizens 
and 240,699 (2.1%) were not.[1] The largest groups were:[86] Mexico (54,166), 
India (50,256), China (34,901), Germany (19,219), Philippines (16,410), 
United Kingdom (15,917), Canada (14,223), Russia (11,763), South Korea 
(11,307), and Ukraine (10,681). Though, predominantly white, Ohio has large 
black populations in all major metropolitan areas throughout the state, 
Ohio has a significant Hispanic population made up of Mexicans in Toledo 
and Columbus, and Puerto Ricans in Cleveland and Columbus, and also has 
a significant and diverse Asian population in Columbus. The largest ancestry 
groups (which the Census defines as not including racial terms) in the 
state are:[1][87] Ancestries claimed by less than 1% of the population 
include Sub-Saharan African, Puerto Rican, Swiss, Swedish, Arab, Greek, 
Norwegian, Romanian, Austrian, Lithuanian, Finnish, West Indian, Portuguese 
and Slovene. About 6.7% of the population age 5 years and over reported 
speaking a language other than English, with 2.2% of the population speaking 
Spanish, 2.6% speaking other Indo-European languages, 1.1% speaking Asian 
and Austronesian languages, and 0.8% speaking other languages.[1] Numerically: 
10,100,586 spoke English, 239,229 Spanish, 55,970 German, 38,990 Chinese, 
33,125 Arabic, and 32,019 French. In addition 59,881 spoke a Slavic language 
and 42,673 spoke another West Germanic language according to the 2010 Census.[88] 
Ohio also had the nation's largest population of Slovene speakers, second 
largest of Slovak speakers, second largest of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) 
speakers, and the third largest of Serbian speakers.[89] According to a 
Pew Forum poll, as of 2008, 76% of Ohioans identified as Christian.[90] 
Specifically, 26% of Ohio's population identified as Evangelical Protestant, 
22% as Mainline Protestant, and 21% as Roman Catholic.[90] 17% of the population 
is unaffiliated with any religious body.[90] 1.3% (148,380) were Jewish.[91] 
There are also small minorities of Jehovah's Witnesses (1%), Muslims (1%), 
Hindus (<0.5%), Buddhists (<0.5%), Mormons (<0.5%), and other faiths (1-1.5%).[90] 
According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA), in 2010 
the largest denominations by adherents were the Roman Catholic Church with 
1,992,567; the United Methodist Church with 496,232; the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church in America with 223,253, the Southern Baptist Convention with 171,000, 
the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ with 141,311, the United 
Church of Christ with 118,000, and the Presbyterian Church (USA) with 110,000.[92] 
With about 70,000 people in 2015 Ohio had the largest Amish population 
of all states of the US.[93] According to the same data, a majority of 
Ohioans, 55%, feel that religion is "very important," 30% say that it is 
"somewhat important," and 15% responded that religion is "not too important/not 
important at all."[90] 36% of Ohioans indicate that they attend religious 
services at least once weekly, 35% attend occasionally, and 27% seldom 
or never participate in religious services.[90] In 2010, Ohio was ranked 
No. 2 in the country for best business climate by Site Selection magazine, 
based on a business-activity database.[94] The state has also won three 
consecutive Governor's Cup awards from the magazine, based on business 
growth and developments.[95] As of 2010[update], Ohio's gross domestic 
product (GDP) was $478 billion.[96][97] This ranks Ohio's economy as the 
seventh-largest of all fifty states and the District of Columbia.[97] The 
Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked the state No. 10 for best 
business-friendly tax systems in their Business Tax Index 2009, including 
a top corporate tax and capital gains rate that were both ranked No. 6 
at 1.9%.[98] Ohio was ranked No. 11 by the council for best friendly-policy 
states according to their Small Business Survival Index 2009.[99] The Directorship's 
Boardroom Guide ranked the state No. 13 overall for best business climate, 
including No. 7 for best litigation climate.[100] Forbes ranked the state 
No. 8 for best regulatory environment in 2009.[101] Ohio has 5 of the top 
115 colleges in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report's 2010 
rankings,[102] and was ranked No. 8 by the same magazine in 2008 for best 
high schools.[103] Ohio's unemployment rate stands at 5.2% as of April 
2015,[104] down from 10.7% in May 2010.[105][106] The state still lacks 
45,000 jobs compared to the prerecession numbers of 2007.[104] The labor 
force participation as of April 2015 is 63%, slightly above the national 
average.[104] Ohio's per capita income stands at $34,874.[97][107] As of 
2007[update], Ohio's median household income is $46,645,[108] and 13.1% 
of the population is below the poverty line,[109] slightly above the national 
rate of 13%.[109] The manufacturing and financial activities sectors each 
compose 18.3% of Ohio's GDP, making them Ohio's largest industries by percentage 
of GDP.[97] Ohio has the largest bioscience sector in the Midwest, and 
is a national leader in the "green" economy. Ohio is the largest producer 
in the country of plastics, rubber, fabricated metals, electrical equipment, 
and appliances.[110] 5,212,000 Ohioans are currently employed by wage or 
salary.[97] By employment, Ohio's largest sector is trade/transportation/utilities, 
which employs 1,010,000 Ohioans, or 19.4% of Ohio's workforce, while the 
health care and education sector employs 825,000 Ohioans (15.8%).[97] Government 
employs 787,000 Ohioans (15.1%), manufacturing employs 669,000 Ohioans 
(12.9%), and professional and technical services employs 638,000 Ohioans 
(12.2%).[97] Ohio's manufacturing sector is the third-largest of all fifty 
United States states in terms of gross domestic product.[97] Fifty-nine 
of the United States' top 1,000 publicly traded companies (by revenue in 
2008) are headquartered in Ohio, including Procter & Gamble, Goodyear Tire 
& Rubber, AK Steel, Timken, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Wendy's.[111] Ohio 
is also one of 41 states with its own lottery,[112] the Ohio Lottery.[113] 
The Ohio Lottery has contributed over $15.5 billion to public education 
in its 34-year history.[114] Many major east-west transportation corridors 
go through Ohio. One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century 
as "Main Market Route 3", was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic 
Lincoln Highway which was the first road across America, connecting New 
York City to San Francisco. In Ohio, the Lincoln Highway linked many towns 
and cities together, including Canton, Mansfield, Wooster, Lima, and Van 
Wert. The arrival of the Lincoln Highway to Ohio was a major influence 
on the development of the state. Upon the advent of the federal numbered 
highway system in 1926, the Lincoln Highway through Ohio became U.S. Route 
30. Ohio also is home to 228 miles (367 km) of the Historic National Road, 
now U.S. Route 40. Ohio has a highly developed network of roads and interstate 
highways. Major east-west through routes include the Ohio Turnpike (I-80/I-90) 
in the north, I-76 through Akron to Pennsylvania, I-70 through Columbus 
and Dayton, and the Appalachian Highway (State Route 32) running from West 
Virginia to Cincinnati. Major north-south routes include I-75 in the west 
through Toledo, Dayton, and Cincinnati, I-71 through the middle of the 
state from Cleveland through Columbus and Cincinnati into Kentucky, and 
I-77 in the eastern part of the state from Cleveland through Akron, Canton, 
New Philadelphia and Marietta down into West Virginia. Interstate 75 between 
Cincinnati and Dayton is one of the heaviest traveled sections of interstate 
in Ohio. Ohio also has a highly developed network of signed state bicycle 
routes. Many of them follow rail trails, with conversion ongoing. The Ohio 
to Erie Trail (route 1) connects Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. U.S. 
Bicycle Route 50 traverses Ohio from Steubenville to the Indiana state 
line outside Richmond.[115] Ohio has 5 international airports, 4 commercial 
and 2 military. The 5 international includes Cleveland Hopkins International 
Airport, Port Columbus International Airport, and Dayton International 
Airport, Ohio's third largest airport. Akron Fulton International Airport 
handles cargo and for private use. Rickenbacker International Airport is 
one of two military airfields which is also home to the 7th largest FedEx 
building in America.[citation needed] The other military airfield is Wright 
Patterson Air Force Base which is one of the largest Air Force bases in 
the United States. Other major airports are located in Toledo and Akron. 
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport is in Hebron, Kentucky 
and therefore is not listed above. The state government of Ohio consists 
of the executive,[116] judicial,[117] and legislative[118] branches. The 
executive branch is headed by the Governor of Ohio.[116] The current governor 
is John Kasich,[11] a Republican elected in 2010. A lieutenant governor 
succeeds the governor in the event of any removal from office,[119] and 
performs any duties assigned by the governor.[120] The current lieutenant 
governor is Mary Taylor. The other elected constitutional offices in the 
executive branch are the secretary of state (Jon A. Husted), auditor (Dave 
Yost), treasurer (Josh Mandel), and attorney general (Mike DeWine).[116] 
There are three levels of the Ohio state judiciary. The lowest level is 
the court of common pleas: each county maintains its own constitutionally 
mandated court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over "all justiciable 
matters".[121] The intermediate-level court system is the district court 
system.[122] Twelve courts of appeals exist, each retaining jurisdiction 
over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and county courts in a set geographical 
area.[121] A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, 
and each judge is elected.[121] The highest-ranking court, the Ohio Supreme 
Court, is Ohio's "court of last resort".[123] A seven-justice panel composes 
the court, which, by its own discretion, hears appeals from the courts 
of appeals, and retains original jurisdiction over limited matters.[124] 
The Ohio General Assembly is a bicameral legislature consisting of the 
Senate and House of Representatives.[125] The Senate is composed of 33 
districts, each of which is represented by one senator. Each senator represents 
approximately 330,000 constituents.[citation needed] The House of Representatives 
is composed of 99 members.[126] Ohio, nicknamed the "Mother of Presidents," 
has sent seven of its native sons (Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, 
James A. Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard 
Taft, and Warren G. Harding) to the White House.[128] All seven were Republicans. 
Virginia native William Henry Harrison, a Whig, resided in Ohio.[128] Historian 
R. Douglas Hurt asserts that not since Virginia "had a state made such 
a mark on national political affairs".[129] The Economist notes that "This 
slice of the mid-west contains a bit of everything American — part north-eastern 
and part southern, part urban and part rural, part hardscrabble poverty 
and part booming suburb",[130] Ohio is the only state that has voted for 
the winning Presidential candidate in each election since 1964, and in 
33 of the 37 held since the Civil War. No Republican has ever won the presidency 
without winning Ohio. As of 2008[update], Ohio's voter demographic leans 
towards the Democratic Party.[131] An estimated 2,408,178 Ohioans are registered 
to vote as Democrats, while 1,471,465 Ohioans are registered to vote as 
Republicans.[131][dead link] These are changes from 2004 of 72% and 32%, 
respectively, and Democrats have registered over 1,000,000 new Ohioans 
since 2004.[131][dead link] Unaffiliated voters have an attrition of 15% 
since 2004, losing an estimated 718,000 of their kind.[131][dead link] 
The total now rests at 4,057,518 Ohioans.[131][dead link] In total, there 
are 7,937,161 Ohioans registered to vote.[131][dead link] In United States 
presidential election of 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama of Illinois won 
51.50% of Ohio's popular vote, 4.59 percentage points more than his nearest 
rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona (with 46.91% of the popular vote).[132] 
However, Obama won only 22 of Ohio's 88 counties.[133] Since 2010, the 
Republicans have largely controlled Ohio state politics, including a super-majority 
in the state's House, a majority in the state Senate, the Governorship, 
etc.[134] As of 2014, the state Senate is 1 Republican away from a super-majority.[134] 
Following the 2000 census, Ohio lost one congressional district in the 
United States House of Representatives, which leaves Ohio with 18 districts, 
and consequently, 18 representatives. The state lost two more seats following 
the 2010 Census, leaving it with 16 votes for the next 3 presidential elections 
in 2012, 2016 and 2020.[135] The 2008 elections, Democrats gained three 
seats in Ohio's delegation to the House of Representatives.[136] This leaves 
eight Republican-controlled seats in the Ohio delegation.[137] Ohio's U.S. 
Senators in the 112th Congress are Republican Rob Portman and Democrat 
Sherrod Brown.[138] Marcy Kaptur (D-9) is the dean, or most senior member, 
of the Ohio delegation to the United States House of Representatives.[139] 
Ohio's system of public education is outlined in Article VI of the state 
constitution, and in Title XXXIII of the Ohio Revised Code. Ohio University, 
the first university in the Northwest Territory, was also the first public 
institution in Ohio. Substantively, Ohio's system is similar to those found 
in other states. At the State level, the Ohio Department of Education, 
which is overseen by the Ohio State Board of Education, governs primary 
and secondary educational institutions. At the municipal level, there are 
approximately 700 school districts statewide. The Ohio Board of Regents 
coordinates and assists with Ohio's institutions of higher education which 
have recently been reorganized into the University System of Ohio under 
Governor Strickland. The system averages an annual enrollment of over 400,000 
students, making it one of the five largest state university systems in 
the U.S. Ohio is home to some of the nation's highest-ranked public libraries.[140] 
The 2008 study by Thomas J. Hennen Jr. ranked Ohio as number one in a state-by-state 
comparison.[141] For 2008, 31 of Ohio's library systems were all ranked 
in the top ten for American cities of their population category.[140] The 
Ohio Public Library Information Network (OPLIN) is an organization that 
provides Ohio residents with internet access to their 251 public libraries. 
OPLIN also provides Ohioans with free home access to high-quality, subscription 
research databases. Ohio also offers the OhioLINK program, allowing Ohio's 
libraries (particularly those from colleges and universities) access to 
materials for the other libraries. The program is largely successful in 
allowing researchers for access to books and other media that might not 
be otherwise available. Ohio is home to major professional sports teams 
in baseball, basketball, football, hockey, lacrosse and soccer. The state's 
major professional sporting teams include: Cincinnati Reds (Major League 
Baseball),[142] Ohio Machine (Major League Lacrosse), Cleveland Indians 
(Major League Baseball),[143] Cincinnati Bengals (National Football League),[144] 
Cleveland Browns (National Football League),[144] Cleveland Cavaliers (National 
Basketball Association),[145] Columbus Blue Jackets (National Hockey League),[146] 
and the Columbus Crew (Major League Soccer).[147] Ohio played a central 
role in the development of both Major League Baseball and the National 
Football League. Baseball's first fully professional team, the Cincinnati 
Red Stockings of 1869, were organized in Ohio.[148] An informal early 20th 
century American football association, the Ohio League, was the direct 
predecessor of the NFL, although neither of Ohio's modern NFL franchises 
trace their roots to an Ohio League club. The Pro Football Hall of Fame 
is located in Canton. On a smaller scale, Ohio hosts minor league baseball, 
arena football, indoor football, mid-level hockey, and lower division soccer. 
The Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course has hosted several auto racing championships, 
including CART World Series, IndyCar Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, 
Can-Am, Formula 5000, IMSA GT Championship, American Le Mans Series and 
Rolex Sports Car Series. The Grand Prix of Cleveland also hosted CART races 
from 1982 to 2007. The Eldora Speedway is a major dirt oval that hosts 
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, World of Outlaws Sprint Cars and USAC 
Silver Crown Series races. Ohio hosts two PGA Tour events, the WGC-Bridgestone 
Invitational and Memorial Tournament. The Cincinnati Masters is an ATP 
World Tour Masters 1000 and WTA Premier 5 tennis tournament. Ohio has eight 
NCAA Division I-A college football teams, divided among three different 
conferences. It has also experienced considerable success in the secondary 
and tertiary tiers of college football divisions. In Division I-A, representing 
the Big Ten, the Ohio State Buckeyes football team ranks 5th among all-time 
winningest programs,[citation needed] with seven national championships 
and seven Heisman Trophy winners. Their biggest rivals are the Michigan 
Wolverines, whom they traditionally play each year as the last game of 
their regular season schedule. Ohio has six teams represented in the Mid-American 
Conference: the University of Akron, Bowling Green, Kent State, Miami University, 
Ohio University and the University of Toledo. The MAC headquarters are 
based in Cleveland. The University of Cincinnati Bearcats represent Ohio 
in the American Athletic Conference. Ohio's state symbols: Coordinates:
