Rugby union in the United States is a growing national sport. Rugby union 
is played at the youth, high school, club, and international levels. All 
rugby union played in the United States is governed by USA Rugby. There 
are over 115,000 players registered with USA Rugby.[1] The 2,588 clubs 
in the United States are governed by USA Rugby through Geographical Unions 
and Local Unions. PRO Rugby was founded in 2015 as the first professional 
rugby competition in the United States. College rugby is popular, with 
rugby being the largest club sport on college campuses. Rugby union was 
first introduced to the United States in the mid nineteenth century and 
gained popularity throughout the late nineteenth century. However, it started 
to decline from the early 1900s.[2] The U.S. won the gold medal in rugby 
at the 1920 Olympics and again at the 1924 Olympics, but rugby collapsed 
in the country after the 1924 Olympics. Rugby did not re-emerge in the 
US until its renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s.[citation needed] The United 
States of America Rugby Football Union (now known as USA Rugby) was formed 
in 1975. There are several high-profile rugby competitions in the U.S. 
The USA Sevens is held every February at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas, 
and draws over 60,000 fans and is broadcast on NBC. The U.S national team 
hosts international matches every June, with attendances around 20,000. 
The Collegiate Rugby Championship is held every June at Talen Energy Stadium 
in the Philadelphia suburb of Chester, Pennsylvania, and draws around 20,000 
fans and is broadcast on NBC. The United States men's national rugby team, 
the Eagles, has competed in all but one of the Rugby World Cup tournaments 
held every four years since 1987. The U.S. national team plays home matches 
every June, both in the Pacific Nations Cup and international test matches. 
The United States is a Tier 2 rugby nation, which means that it is not 
currently competitive at the elite level of the sport, but is one of World 
Rugby's key development markets.[3] The U.S. also fields a team in the 
Americas Rugby Championship; a USA "A" national team participated in the 
original version of the competition, and the full national team is competing 
in a revamped version that is launching in 2016. USA Rugby fields other 
national teams. The men's national rugby sevens team has been a "core team" 
that has participated in every tournament since 2008 of the annual World 
Rugby Sevens Series. The women's national team has reached the quarterfinals 
of every Women's Rugby World Cup, and won the inaugural Women's Rugby World 
Cup in 1991. The women's national sevens team is one of the core teams 
in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series, which has included a tournament 
in the U.S. since its first season in 2012–13.[4] The U.S. tournament was 
held in Houston in the 2012–13 season, and since then has been held in 
the Atlanta suburb of Kennesaw, Georgia. Princeton students played a game 
called "ballown" as early as 1820. A Harvard tradition known as "Bloody 
Monday" began in 1827, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman 
and sophomore classes. Dartmouth played its own version called "Old division 
football", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the 
game dates to at least the 1830s. All of these games, and others, shared 
certain commonalities. They remained largely "mob" style games, with huge 
numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often 
by any means necessary. Rules were simple and violence and injury were 
common.[6][7] The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests 
and a decision to abandon them. Yale, under pressure from the city of New 
Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard 
followed suit in 1861.[6] The sport of rugby union in the United States 
has always had a close relationship with the sport of American football. 
Initially, games of rugby, soccer, and hybrid games had been played between 
American universities. Primitive forms of rugby, then all covered by the 
name "football", were being played in the USA as far back as the 1840s, 
at Harvard, Yale and Princeton, stemming partly from Americans who had 
been educated in English schools.[2] However, in 1862, Yale dealt it a 
major blow by banning it for being too violent and dangerous, about seven 
years later, in 1869, the first game of College football was played between 
Princeton and Rutgers.[2] However, rugby was taking a firm grip of the 
Ivy League and other East Coast Universities, where it would have an influence 
on the nascent gridiron, which later became its major competitor.[2] Unfortunately 
American football's growth came at exactly the point at which rugby was 
beginning to establish itself in the States.[2] Rugby spread through America's 
colleges, away from the Ivy League and the East Coast, into Texas, California 
and other west coast states.[2] However, because of America's huge size, 
this resulted in a bipolar game, played mainly in east and west, but not 
really in the middle – other than Illinois and the Great Lakes, and Texas 
in the south.[2] There would also come to be a small rugby playing centre 
in Salt Lake City, as Polynesian Mormons came to study and live there, 
and to a lesser extent by returning missionaries.[2] In 1872, rugby clubs 
were established in the San Francisco Bay Area, composed mainly of British 
expatriates. The first recorded rugby match in the United States occurred 
on May 14, 1874 between Harvard University and McGill University. In 1876, 
Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia formed the Intercollegiate Football 
Association, a competition based on the traditional rules of rugby union. 
Around the same time, the aforementioned British rugby players of San Francisco 
introduced rugby to the University of California, Berkeley. One factor 
aiding in rugby's growth in the early 1900s was American football's crisis 
of 1905-06, with President Teddy Roosevelt engaging in a debate about the 
future of American football in response to the perception that American 
football was a violent sport.[8] The growth of rugby in the United States 
and particularly in California was aided by the 1905 New Zealand national 
team, known as the "Originals", playing three matches in the U.S. in early 
1906—one exhibition match in New York, and two exhibition matches in California 
against teams from British Columbia.[2][9] Apart from the high standard 
of rugby in various parts of Canada, it was not uncommon for Australian 
and New Zealand sides to play games in the USA – especially California 
and New York – when returning from Europe, or when European teams made 
the trip the other way.[2] Some west coast colleges—including the flagship 
University of California, Stanford University, and Santa Clara—abandoned 
their American football programs in favor of rugby.[8] The "Big Game" American 
football rivalry between Cal and Stanford was played as a rugby match instead 
of American football from 1906 to 1914 (1906 was notable for being the 
first year that American football had legalized the forward pass, a system 
that would become a distinguishing characteristic in the American game 
that is not present in rugby).[10][11] Rugby union grew on the West Coast, 
and as many as 26,000 spectators regularly attended matches between the 
University of California and Stanford University.[citation needed] During 
this era, rugby was perceived as having the potential to challenge American 
football as the dominant football code on the west coast.[8] The unfamiliar 
and complex game play hampered rugby's initial growth on the East Coast. 
Controversy arose in 1905 when published photographs of a rugby match between 
Swarthmore College and the University of Pennsylvania were used to depict 
rugby as a "harsh game". In 1908 and 1909, the Australian national team 
visited the U.S. as part of an international tour, playing university teams 
and an all-California side. In 1910, a combined Universities rugby team 
comprising mostly players from Cal, Stanford, and the University of Nevada 
went on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. The underdog American side 
upset both Rotorua RFC and Auckland RU,[citation needed] which came as 
a great surprise to the international rugby community. In 1910, D.W. Wheeler 
of the University of California wrote that "rugby throughout the state 
is on the boom," with five out of six San Francisco high schools having 
taken up rugby.[12] In 1912, the Australian national team returned to America; 
this tour was the first and only America-specific tour by Australia to 
date. Stanford University defeated the Australian national team 13-12 on 
16 October 1912, with the San Francisco Examiner declaring that the win 
had "raised America to a position among the first-class rugby nations."[9] 
Australia's 1912 tour of the United States saw the United States national 
team play their first international test against Australia.[citation needed] 
The United States performed well, holding a lead in the second half, before 
losing 12–8.[8] The San Francisco Chronicle declared that "America has 
arrived on the international map" and predicted that the U.S. "will be 
looking down upon all the other nations in a few more years."[8] After 
a promising start on the international stage, the Americans were thrashed 
51–3 a year later by a strong All Blacks side. This test was organized 
by former Cal president Benjamin Ide Wheeler in an attempt to popularize 
rugby among his students. By 1915, rugby in California was already beginning 
to decline.[9] The University of California returned to American football 
in 1915-1916.[8] Once the University of California returned to American 
football, a number of local schools quickly followed.[9] The vastness of 
the USA has resulted in the rise of regional "Conferences", where the East 
and West played as different blocs.[when?][2] Hawaii and Alaska led completely 
separate rugby existences, focusing their energy on their South Seas, and 
British Columbian neighbors instead.[2] Until recently this vastness also 
caused problems in the preparation of a national team, as the players would 
rarely get to meet one another.[2] The U.S. national team won their first 
test in 1919, defeating Romania. Rugby union was a fixture at the 1920 
Summer Olympics in Antwerp, and a United States team composed largely of 
players from Stanford University and coached by Dan Carroll defeated France 
to win the gold medal, after money was raised in San Francisco to send 
them to Europe.[9] In 1924, rugby union was again included in the 1924 
Summer Olympics in Paris. An American side was invited to participate, 
and the team surprised spectators by landing a place in the final with 
the hosts – the French. An estimated 50,000 turned up to Colombes Stadium 
to watch. The United States defeated France for the gold in 1924. This 
was, however, the last time until 2016 when rugby featured at the Olympics, 
and the last ever for the full 15-man version of the game (the return of 
rugby in 2016 was in the sevens version). As a result, the 1924 United 
States team is the last to win gold in the full version of rugby union. 
Rare vintage footage of the 1924 Gold Medal match was included in the rugby 
documentary, A Giant Awakens: the Rise of American Rugby. Rugby began its 
revival in the United States in the late 1950s and into the 1960s and 1970s, 
as many colleges started club rugby teams. Rugby began getting some coverage 
in the media, including in the New York Times, when 1958 Heisman Trophy 
winner Pete Dawkins played for Oxford against Cambridge in 1959.[13] The 
first rugby sevens tournament in the U.S. was played during Thanksgiving 
weekend in 1959 in New York with eight teams from various northeast colleges.[13] 
USA Rugby, the body that governs rugby in the U.S., was founded in 1975. 
On 31 January 1976, the U.S. national team played Australia—in its first 
official match since the 1924 Olympics—before 7,000 fans at Glover Field 
in Los Angeles.[citation needed] In 1980, USA Rugby formed a college national 
championship tournament. In 1987, the U.S. national team participated in 
the inaugural Rugby World Cup. The U.S. women's national team was officially 
formed in 1987. The Rugby Super League, a nationwide club competition, 
was played from 1996 to 2012. From 2003 to 2011, the U.S. national team 
played in the Churchill Cup, with the U.S. hosting matches from 2006 to 
2010. The U.S. men's national rugby sevens team has participated in the 
World Rugby Sevens Series each year since the tournament's founding in 
1999, and the women's national sevens team has participated in the World 
Rugby Women's Sevens Series since the competition's launch in 2012. Rugby 
in the U.S. received a significant boost in 2009 when the International 
Olympic Committee voted to reinstate rugby into the Summer Olympics beginning 
in 2016. In 2014, the United States hosted the New Zealand national team 
before a record sellout crowd of 60,000+ at Soldier Field in Chicago, a 
match later billed as potentially marking the rise of American rugby.[14] 
In 2016, PRO Rugby is planning to establish the first fully professional 
Rugby competition in the U.S. Also in that year, the English top-flight 
club London Irish took a home match against Saracens to the Red Bull Arena 
in the New York area, marking the first top-flight English match ever held 
outside that country. Rugby has had a long and complicated relationship 
with American football. William Gunmere of Rutgers devised the game, and 
based it upon American forms of rugby and association football.[2] Another 
important point is that during the 19th century, the United States was 
trying to develop a new national culture, independent of its English colonial 
roots, as it had become politically independent the previous century. This 
extended into the sporting arena, with the adoption and invention of American 
football and basketball, and also the myth of Abner Doubleday founding 
baseball, which attempted to divorce it from its English origins. Unlike 
football, rugby has established itself through the United States via its 
colleges and universities.[2] By the end of the 19th century, rugby's American 
offspring had outgrown its parent within America, and many young Americans 
who would have made good rugby players were steered into American football 
instead. Nonetheless, some of rugby's legacy can be seen in American football 
to this day, including its prolate spheroid football, rucking, and elevated 
goalposts of similar width. Major differences include higher tackles than 
rugby, protective equipment, and forward passing. The fair catch kick is 
a relic of the now obsolete goal from mark. The scoring systems have evolved 
parallel, with both rugby union and American football offering three points 
for a kicked goal and seven points for a ball run into the end zone and 
a successfully kicked conversion. Rugby union played anywhere is governed 
by World Rugby (WR), originally the International Rugby Football Board 
and later the International Rugby Board, which is based in Dublin, Ireland. 
It is the governing and law-making body for rugby globally. WR has over 
100 member unions. USA Rugby is the member union of the United States within 
WR. USA Rugby is responsible for overseeing rugby union domestically and 
training the various national teams that they put on the pitch. The game 
of rugby started to see some form of growth in the United States in the 
1960s. In 1975, the United States of America Rugby Football Union was formed. 
The US Union dates from 1975, and joined WR (then known as IRFB) in 1987.[2] 
Within USA Rugby, there are several Geographical Unions (GU's) that are 
charged with governing a specific region of the country. Within these GU's, 
there are also Local Area Unions (LAU's), which are responsible for governing 
a specific region within their respective GU's. More than 98,000 people 
are registered members of USA Rugby.[15] The numbers of registered rugby 
members are highest in California, New York and Pennsylvania. On a per-person 
basis, rugby membership is highest in New England and in the Rocky Mountain 
states of Colorado and Utah.[15] There are 32,754 men and 11,790 women 
playing senior-level rugby.[16] Over 34,000 high school athletes (26,212 
boys and 8,706 girls) play rugby for their schools or U19 clubs.[16] Over 
2,200 pre-teens (1,988 boys and 228 girls) play organized rugby.[16] With 
over 20,000 registered females in USA Rugby, the U.S. has more female rugby 
players than any other country in the world.[17] There are 1,582 referees 
within USA Rugby.[16] A 2010 survey by the National Sporting Goods Manufacturers 
Association ranked rugby as the fastest growing sport in the U.S.[18] In 
2014 the Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported rugby as the 
fastest growing team sport in the U.S. during the previous five years.[19] 
Rugby participation in the U.S. has grown significantly since 2000, growing 
by 350% between 2004 and 2011.[17] Between 2006 and 2011, the number of 
high-school rugby players in the U.S. increased by 84%, with 28,000 players 
in 650 high school programs.[20] By 2010, the number of registered players 
in the U.S. had grown to over 81,000, moving the U.S. ahead of traditional 
rugby powers Wales and Scotland in terms of playing numbers.[17] Rugby's 
profile in the U.S. has received a tremendous boost from the International 
Olympic Committee's announcement in 2009 that rugby would return to the 
Olympics in 2016. USA Rugby has formally become a member of the US Olympic 
Committee, allowing rugby players and programs access to Olympic resources. 
Attendance at rugby matches and tournaments has grown significantly in 
recent years. Attendance for the USA Sevens tournament has grown steadily 
from 15,800 in 2004, to 52,000 fans at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas in 
2011.[21] The 2011 College Premier Division national championship match 
between Cal and BYU drew a crowd of 11,000 at Rio Tinto Stadium.[22] A 
friendly match between the US and Ireland in 2009 drew 10,000 fans to Buck 
Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara,[23] and a friendly match between the US and 
Italy in 2012 drew over 17,000 fans to BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston.[24] 
This was followed by 20,000-strong crowds at BBVA Compass Stadium vs. Ireland 
in June 2013 and Scotland in June 2014; these records were smashed in November 
2014 however when an historic sell-out crowd of 61,500 watched the match 
against New Zealand at Soldier Field; the match also drew an average TV 
audience of 927,000 on NBC.[25][26] Another significant development in 
the history of U.S. rugby came at the 2015 London Sevens, the final tournament 
of the 2014–15 Sevens Series, when the US won its first-ever championship 
of a Sevens Series event.[27] The announcement in 2009 that rugby in its 
rugby sevens format would by admitted into the 2016 Summer Olympics has 
meant increased TV exposure. Rugby came onto NBC's radar following the 
2009 announcement.[29] NBC has begun broadcasting several rugby tournaments 
on network TV, particularly rugby sevens tournaments, considered a television 
friendly format.[30] NBC has shown the Collegiate Rugby Championship each 
year since 2010. NBC has also broadcast the USA Sevens tournament each 
year since 2011. Roughly 5.4 million viewers tuned in to watch the 2011 
USA Sevens, helping increase awareness of the sport of rugby.[17][31] Viewership 
for the 2012 USA Sevens on NBC earned successful ratings (0.7), beating 
the ratings for an NHL match (0.4) and five college basketball games (0.1–0.3) 
played that same weekend.[32] The TV ratings on NBC for the USA Sevens 
and Collegiate Rugby Championships grew 14% from 2013 to 2014,[19] with 
the 2014 USA Sevens drawing ratings of 0.7 on Saturday and 1.0 on Sunday.[33] 
NBC, along with its Universal Sports affiliate network, broadcast ten matches 
of the 2011 Rugby World Cup — three on NBC and seven on Universal — marking 
the first time the Rugby World Cup was broadcast live on TV in the U.S.[34] 
NBC broadcast a November 1, 2014 match between the United States and New 
Zealand, earning a 0.7 rating.[35] NBC and Universal Sports Network broadcast 
nine matches (two on NBC, seven on Universal) from the 2015 Rugby World 
Cup in England.[36] NBCSN will show matches from the English Premiership 
beginning spring 2016.[28] In addition, specialty cable channels have begun 
broadcasting an increasing amount of rugby. BeIN Sports shows the Pro12, 
European Rugby Champions Cup, and select international matches. Select 
international matches and European club matches are shown on WatchESPN. 
The United States is considered a likely candidate to host a Rugby World 
Cup, due to the recent growth and future growth potential of rugby in the 
U.S., which has been recognized by World Rugby. In 2010, Mike Miller, at 
the time the CEO of what was then known as the IRB, stated that the US 
would host a Rugby World Cup, stating that "it's a question of when, not 
if."[37] USA Rugby CEO Nigel Melville revealed in November 2011 that the 
U.S. had been asked by the IRB to consider preparing a bid to host the 
Rugby World Cup, and that USA Rugby was considering bidding for the rights 
to host the 2023 or the 2027 Rugby World Cup.[38] When the U.S. was then 
awarded the right to host the 2012 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy (a tournament 
now known as the World Rugby Under 20 Trophy), it was seen as the U.S. 
moving a step closer to hosting a Rugby World Cup.[39] Nigel Melville stated 
that hosting the 2012 IRB JWRT was "the first step to . . . hosting a Rugby 
World Cup."[39] IRB Chairman Bernard Lapasset has acknowledged that "the 
USA is a very important and exciting market for Rugby."[39] The United 
States has several features that would make it a successful host of the 
Rugby World Cup: The popularity of rugby was given a minor boost when it 
was featured in the fourth season of Friends in the episode The One with 
all the rugby, broadcast February 26, 1998. Rugby was also featured prominently 
in the 2008 movie Forever Strong. Rugby was also prominent in the film 
The Departed, by virtue of being set in Boston's Irish community. Two recent 
American presidents have played the sport: The United States national rugby 
union team is nicknamed the Eagles. They played their first international 
in 1912, but did not begin playing regularly until 1976. The Eagles have 
qualified for six of the seven Rugby World Cups, including the most recent 
2015 Rugby World Cup. The U.S. national team also hosts World Rugby Pacific 
Nations Cup matches every June, and generally tours against European teams 
each November. The United States are currently a Tier-2 rugby nation. The 
U.S. has been consistently ranked as one of the top 20 teams in the world 
since the World Rugby Rankings were developed in 2003.[45] The US national 
team has played in six of the seven Rugby World Cup tournaments held every 
four years since the inaugural 1987 tournament. In the inaugural 1987 Rugby 
World Cup, the United States beat Japan in the pool stage. The 1991 Rugby 
World Cup saw invitations abolished in favor of a 32-team qualifying tournament 
that saw the United States successfully gain entry. They were in a pool 
with New Zealand, England and Italy – all strong rugby powers. After missing 
out on the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, the national side qualified 
for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. They subsequently qualified for 
the 2003 Rugby World Cup, finishing fourth in their pool, winning one game 
against Japan. The US came away from the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France 
without a win, but they had a 28–10 performance against England (defending 
2003 champion). One of the high points for the team was the winger Takudzwa 
Ngwenya, who scored against South Africa by out-pacing Bryan Habana for 
a try,[46] earning "Try of the Year" honors at the IRB Awards. Other notable 
performances came from captain Mike Hercus (who led the team with 26 points 
in the tournament) and Todd Clever. The USA played in the 2011 Rugby World 
Cup held in New Zealand, in a pool with Australia, Ireland, Italy, and 
first-time finalist Russia. The highlights included a 13–6 win against 
Russia, and a 22–10 loss against Ireland. Chris Wyles was the USA's leading 
scorer with 18 points. In 2006, WR (then the IRB) created the Pacific Nations 
Cup. The tournament is intended to strengthen the Tier 2 rugby nations 
by providing competitive test matches in a tournament format. For the first 
several years, it included only Oceanic nations, such as Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, 
and Japan. However, it was expanded in 2013 to include the United States 
and Canada.[47] In 2009, WR (then the IRB) launched a new competition, 
the Americas Rugby Championship, with four teams. The teams included a 
"USA Selects", effectively the United States "A" (second-level) side; a 
Canadian team; the Argentina Jaguars, an Argentine developmental side that 
has taken over the role of the country's "A" side; and an Uruguayan team. 
Since the competition was played between A-sides, the tournament matches 
were not official international test matches. The competition was held 
annually from 2009 through 2014, except in the World Cup year of 2011. 
The competition was relaunched in 2016 as a Western Hemisphere equivalent 
to Europe's Six Nations Championship. The new format will involve the Argentina 
Jaguars and the full national teams of the USA, Brazil, Canada, Chile, 
and Uruguay. All matches in the tournament, including those against Argentina 
Jaguars, will be full international tests, and all will count in the World 
Rugby Rankings except those involving Argentina Jaguars. The North America 
4 was an elite-level IRB-financed tournament that ran from 2006 until 2008. 
The tournament was contested between four teams, two from the United States 
and two from Canada. The Rugby Super League was the national premier Division 
1 rugby amateur club competition that ran from 1997 to 2012. The Super 
League was created in 1996 by the major territorial unions within USA Rugby 
with the intention of creating a competitive national competition. The 
inaugural season of the competition saw 14 teams divided into two seven-team 
divisions: the Western-Pacific Conference and the Midwestern-East Conference. 
Aspen won the first championship. Belmont Shore was the most successful 
club, appearing in the finals every year from 2002 to 2008, until the club 
left the competition. San Francisco Golden Gate then led the league, appearing 
in the finals every year from 2009 to 2011. The size of the league fluctuated 
over the years. The inclusion of some sub-par clubs and the exclusion of 
top-performing clubs was controversial issue since the inception of the 
Super League, called into question whether it was really USA's "premier" 
competition. Following the demise of the Super League, USA Rugby formed 
the Elite Cup in 2013 among the top eight clubs from the previous season’s 
National Division I Club Championship.[48] The competition was divided 
into two pools of four teams: East, consisting of Boston, Life Running 
Eagles, New York Athletic Club, and Old Blue of New York; and West, consisting 
of Denver Barbarians, Glendale Raptors, San Francisco Golden Gate, and 
Seattle OPSB.[49] However, the competition lasted only one year, as three 
of the four western members affiliated with the Pacific Rugby Premiership. 
In 2013, seven western clubs announced the formation of the Pacific Rugby 
Premiership, consisting of three teams from southern California, two from 
northern California, and two from Colorado.[50] The PRP is a Division 1 
competition that began play in spring 2014. The season runs from February 
to May, with a 12-game regular-season schedule in which teams play each 
other team twice, culminating in a one-game championship match in May.[50] 
The teams competing are: In July 2014, five eastern clubs announced the 
formation of the American Rugby Premiership, consisting of two teams from 
New York, two from Boston, and one from Atlanta.[51] The competition schedule 
involves eight matches played in a split season, with the first half of 
the season during September–October, a winter break, and the remaining 
half of the season in April–May, culminating in a challenge match between 
the champions of the Pacific and the Atlantic competitions.[51] In 2015 
eight Midwestern clubs announced the formation of the Midwest Rugby Premiership, 
consisting of two teams from Chicago, two from Ohio (Cincinnati and Columbus), 
and one each from Kansas City, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Davenport, IA. 
The MRP is a Division 1 competition that began play in fall of 2015. The 
season runs from September to May, with a 14-game regular-season schedule 
in which teams play each other twice, a playoff semi final, culminating 
in a one-game championship match in May. In November 2015, in conjunction 
with the Red River Premiership the Metropolis RFC, Kansas City RFC, Austin 
Blacks RFC and Dallas Reds RFC took part in the inaugural USA Rugby sanctioned 
first round of the Gold Cup. The teams competing are: The development of 
a domestic professional rugby competition is seen as a key step in the 
growth of rugby in the United States.[52] USA Rugby CEO Nigel Melville 
predicted in 2012 that professional rugby would come to the United States 
by 2015.[53] Melville was quoted in 2014 as saying "We can do it in two 
years, it will be city-driven and we will start with six [teams] and we 
will go from there."[52] U.S. national team assistant coach Justin Fitzpatrick 
said in 2015 that by 2016 the U.S. will have resolved to create a professional 
domestic rugby competition.[54] Griffins Rugby, based in Dallas, announced 
its goal of becoming a professional rugby club. Jake Abbott became the 
first professional player to join Griffins from English club Worcester 
Warriors,[55] and by 2015 the club had signed four professional players.[56] 
In November 2015, the Professional Rugby Organization (PRO Rugby) announced 
that it was launching a USA Rugby-sanctioned professional rugby competition 
in 2016. Teams play at medium-size venues, with a 12-match schedule from 
April to July.[57][58] The five teams in 2016 are Denver, Ohio, Sacramento, 
San Diego and San Francisco. The USA Rugby Club 7s National Championship 
is the top annual American rugby sevens competition organized by USA Rugby. 
The best sixteen clubs in the country participate each year. Rugby union 
is played in universities throughout the United States. More than 1,000 
colleges have rugby teams.[59] College rugby is the largest section of 
USA Rugby's membership. For the 2010-11 season, there were over 32,000 
college members and 854 college clubs registered with USA Rugby,[60] roughly 
a 14% increase from 28,000 college members in August 2008.[61] College 
rugby continues to grow in popularity, and rugby is one of the fastest 
growing sports across college campuses.[59] College rugby includes the 
National Collegiate Championship competition in fifteens rugby (since 1980). 
USA Rugby created a smaller Division 1-A competition in 2011 of roughly 
30 schools with the intention of refining topflight collegiate rugby.[62] 
In 2013 a number of top rugby schools formed the Varsity Cup postseason 
tournament, leading to the perceived existence of two national championships. 
The Varsity Cup final has been broadcast live on NBC Sports every spring 
since 2014. The 2009 announcement that rugby sevens would return to the 
Olympics in 2016 has led to an increased emphasis in the collegiate ranks 
on the sevens game, and increasing interest from TV and other media. The 
highest profile collegiate 7s competition is the Collegiate Rugby Championship 
(CRC), which is held in June of every year at Talen Energy Stadium in suburban 
Philadelphia and is televised live by NBC. USA Rugby also operates a college 
sevens national championship, the USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National 
Championships. Outstanding college rugby players are recognized as All-Americans 
by USA Rugby.[63] Qualified All-Americans can represent the United States 
in international tournaments by playing on the United States national under-20 
rugby union team. Rugby union has been growing in the United States at 
the high school level: Rugby will become the 35th sport of the Massachusetts 
Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) in 2016, following a 2015 MIAA 
vote that passed by a wide majority.[66] As of 2015, there are 19 boys’ 
teams and 5 girls’ teams in Massachusetts, with the majority of the Catholic 
Conference schools fielding rugby teams.[66] A list of the Geographical
