Yusmeiro Alberto Petit (Spanish pronunciation: [ʝusˈmeiɾo peˈtit]; born 
November 22, 1984) is a Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher who is 
currently a free agent. He previously played for the Florida Marlins, Arizona 
Diamondbacks, San Francisco Giants, and Washington Nationals. In 2014, 
Petit retired 46 consecutive batters to set a new Major League record. 
He throws right-handed. As of 2016, he is the only person ever to play 
on winning teams in both the Little League World Series and the Major League 
World Series.[1] As a ten-year-old, Petit competed in the 1994 Little League 
World Series, representing the championship-winning Coquivacoa Little League 
team. This was the first time a Venezuelan team had won the LLWS title 
in eight appearances.[1] Petit signed with the New York Mets as an international 
free agent on November 15, 2001. He made his professional debut in 2002 
with the Venezuelan Summer League where he went 3–5 with 2.43 earned run 
average (ERA) in 12 games, 11 starts. In 2003 Petit split the season between 
the Rookie-Level Kingsport Mets and the Short-Season Brooklyn Cyclones. 
He finished third in the Appalachian League in strikeouts, fourth in strikeouts 
per nine innings and fifth in ERA. Petit also placed second in Appalachian 
League in fewest bases on balls per nine innings and allowed the second 
fewest runners per nine innings. He was named Pitcher of the Week for the 
week of July 14 to July 20. He was promoted to Brooklyn of the New York–Penn 
League on August 23. He recorded 20 strikeouts in 12 1⁄3 innings with the 
Cyclones. He spent time with the Class-A Capital City Bombers, the Class-A 
Advanced St. Lucie Mets and the Double-A Binghamton Mets during the 2004 
season. He finished second among all Minor League pitchers with 200 strikeouts 
and first in strikeouts per nine innings with a 12.92 clip. Petit received 
the Sterling Organizational Pitcher of the Year Award as top pitcher in 
the Mets organization. He began the season at Capital City of the South 
Atlantic League where he was selected to the Mid-Season All-Star team. 
He notched 122 strikeouts and walked only 22 walks in 83 innings with the 
Bombers. He was first in the league in wins and strikeouts before he was 
promoted to St. Lucie of the Florida State League on July 26. He had 62 
strikeouts in 44 1⁄3 innings with St. Lucie. He was soon promoted to Binghamton 
of the Eastern League on August 28. Petit made two starts for Binghamton 
and fanned 10 batters in seven innings on August 28. He pitched 2⁄3 scoreless 
innings for the World Team at the 2004 All-Star Futures Game on July 11 
in Houston, Texas. He was 4–3 with a 2.15 ERA in 11 starts in the Venezuelan 
Winter League. Petit spent time with Binghamton and the Triple-A Norfolk 
Tides in 2005. He went 9–3 with 2.91 ERA in 21 starts at Double-A, then 
went 0–3 with 9.20 ERA in three starts with Norfolk after being promoted 
on August 22. He made four starts for the Norfolk Tides, including one 
in the playoffs against the Toledo Mud Hens. He lost all three regular-season 
starts, allowing 16 runs on 24 hits in 14 2⁄3 innings. He did however earn 
a win in the playoff start against Toledo, allowing three earned runs on 
six hits in eight innings, recording 14 strikeouts. He was named to the 
Eastern League's mid-season All-Star team and finished second in the league 
in ERA. He again pitched in the Venezuelan Winter League, going 5–1 with 
one save and 2.01 ERA in nine games. In November 2005, the Mets traded 
Petit along with Mike Jacobs and Grant Psomas for Carlos Delgado.[2] He 
appeared in 15 games, one start, with the Marlins, going 1–1 with 9.57 
ERA during his three major league stints. He pitched primarily out of bullpen, 
going 0–1 with 10.18 ERA in 14 outings as a reliever. He made his major 
league debut on May 14 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, allowing one hit 
with two strikeouts in one inning. He held the Atlanta Braves scoreless 
in three innings during second appearance on May 17 at Turner Field, recording 
a career-high three strikeouts. Petit suffered first major league loss 
on May 19 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, allowing a 10th-inning walk-off 
home run to Aubrey Huff. He was optioned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes 
on June 18 after going 0–1 with 7.36 ERA in seven outings. He was recalled 
on July 4, and went 1–0 with a 10.57 ERA in two games before he was optioned 
back to Albuquerque on July 17. He was again recalled on September 1 going 
0–0 with 11.74 ERA in final six appearances of season. He made his first 
major league start and earned first major league win on July 5 against 
the Washington Nationals. He was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks on 
March 26, 2007, for Jorge Julio.[3] He picked up his first win for the 
Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders on April 15 against the Colorado Springs Sky 
Sox, tossing six innings, allowing two earned runs off six hits with five 
strikeouts. He was recalled on April 22 and made his D-backs debut that 
night against the San Francisco Giants, allowing two runs over seven innings 
in the loss. He earned wins in five of his next six starts, going 5–0 with 
a 2.21 ERA. He earned his first win for the D-backs on July 3 against the 
St. Louis Cardinals, allowing one run over 5 1⁄3 innings. Going into the 
2009 season, Petit was the likely candidate for the fifth starter role 
in the pitching rotation or a long-relief role, out of the bullpen.[4][5] 
He started the season in the major leagues for the first time in his career 
and posted a 0–1 mark with a 4.70 ERA in six relief appearances before 
being optioned to Tucson on April 27. He made 11 starts for the Sidewinders, 
going 3–3 with a 4.80 ERA. Petit was recalled on June 27 and remained in 
the Majors for the remainder of the season. He made his first start of 
the season for the D-backs on July 2 and earned a no-decision in a 4–3 
loss against the Milwaukee Brewers after allowing only one run on two hits 
with four strikeouts in six innings. He held opposing batters to a .216 
batting average for the season, including a .213 average as a starter. 
In 2009, Petit was mainly a spot starter for the Diamondbacks rotation 
and went 3–5 with a 4.31 ERA in 19 games, eight starts. On August 4, 2009, 
Petit took a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates 
before it was broken up in the eighth with a single by Ronny Cedeño. It 
was the only hit he allowed in eight innings. He finished the season 3–10 
with a 5.82 ERA in 23 games, 17 starts. Petit was claimed off waivers by 
the Seattle Mariners on November 5, 2009.[6][7] He was designated for assignment 
on February 6, 2010. On February 9, Petit cleared waivers and was sent 
to Triple-A. On March 17, he was released. However, he re–signed to a minor 
league deal 10 days later. In 2011, Petit played for the Oaxaca Warriors 
of the Mexican League.[8] Petit signed a minor league contract with the 
San Francisco Giants for the 2012 season.[8] He made his Giants debut as 
the starting pitcher on September 23, in place of Tim Lincecum, in a move 
to rest the regular rotation, since the Giants had clinched the NL West 
division title the day before. Petit allowed 2 runs and 7 hits in 4 2/3 
innings in that effort; he was not the pitcher of record in a Giants loss. 
Petit began 2013 with Triple-A Fresno, but on July 23, he was called up 
to help the pitching staff during a double-header. He pitched in the first 
game of the double-header after Eric Surkamp had a poor start. In 5.1 innings, 
he struck out 7 and gave up 2 runs. On July 28, he was designated for assignment.[9] 
Petit subsequently cleared waivers and was sent back to Fresno. He was 
recalled by the Giants on August 23, as a starter. On September 6, 2013, 
making just his third major-league start of the year since joining the 
rotation as an injury replacement, Petit came within one strike of pitching 
a perfect game against his former team, the Arizona Diamondbacks. It was 
broken up on a single by pinch hitter Eric Chavez on a 3-2 count with two 
outs in the ninth inning. Petit would get the following out, finishing 
the game with 7 strikeouts and no walks on 95 pitches. The Giants won that 
game 3-0. The game was Petit's first career complete game and shutout.[10] 
He was the 12th pitcher in MLB history to lose a perfect game with two 
outs in the 9th inning.[11] During the 2014 season, Petit worked mostly 
in relief, with occasional starts.[12] Making a spot start in place of 
the injured Matt Cain on July 22 and giving up five runs (increasing his 
season ERA to 4.11[12]), Petit recorded the last out of the fifth inning 
and subsequently proceeded to post six consecutive perfect relief appearances, 
of lengths varying from 1 to 4 1⁄3 innings, totalling 38 consecutive retired 
batters.[13] On August 28, Petit returned to the Giants starting rotation 
in place of Tim Lincecum and set down the first eight Colorado Rockies 
to set a new MLB record for consecutive batters retired at 46 (over a period 
of eight games), breaking the record of 45 formerly held by Mark Buehrle. 
Buehrle's streak included his perfect game and the starts before and after. 
Buehrle had broken a 1971 record of 41 consecutive retired batters that 
had been set by Jim Barr over the course of two complete-game wins, from 
the third inning of one to the seventh inning of the next; Barr's mark 
had been tied in 2007 by Bobby Jenks over the course of 14 relief appearances. 
He also broke Buehrle's record for consecutive perfect innings pitched 
by 0.1 with 15.1. After giving up a third-inning double to opposing pitcher 
Jordan Lyles to snap the streak, Petit proceeded to complete six innings, 
allowing four hits and a run, to record the win and reduce his season ERA 
to 3.44.[12][13][14] In the Giants 18-inning victory over the Washington 
Nationals in the second game of the 2014 National League Division Series, 
Petit pitched 6 shut-out innings to get the win, as Brandon Belt hit the 
game-winning home run in the 18th.[15] In Game 4 of the 2014 National League 
Championship Series, Petit pitched three scoreless innings in relief of 
Ryan Vogelsong that gave the Giants time to erase a 4-1 deficit. With the 
Giants' victory over the Kansas City Royals to secure the 2014 World Series 
title, Petit became the only professional baseball player to win both the 
Little League World Series and the MLB World Series.[1] Petit reached free 
agency after the 2015 season. The Washington Nationals announced on December 
14, 2015, that he accepted a one-year deal with an option for a second
