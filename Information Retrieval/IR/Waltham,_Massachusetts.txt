Waltham (/ˈwɔːlˌθæm/) is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United 
States, and was an early center for the labor movement as well as a major 
contributor to the American Industrial Revolution. The original home of 
the Boston Manufacturing Company, the city was a prototype for 19th century 
industrial city planning, spawning what became known as the Waltham-Lowell 
system of labor and production. The city is now a center for research and 
higher education, home to Brandeis University and Bentley University. The 
population was 60,636 at the census in 2010.[1] Waltham is commonly referred 
to as Watch City because of its association with the watch industry. Waltham 
Watch Company opened its factory in Waltham in 1854 and was the first company 
to make watches on an assembly line. It won the gold medal in 1876 at the 
Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The company produced over 35 million 
watches, clocks and instruments before it closed in 1957.[2] The name of 
the city is pronounced with the primary stress on the first syllable and 
a full vowel in the second syllable, /ˈwɔːlθæm/ "wall-tham", though the 
name of the Waltham watch was pronounced with a reduced schwa in the second 
syllable: /ˈwɔːlθəm/.[3] As most would pronounce in the British way, Walthum, 
when people came to work in the mills from Nova Scotia, the pronunciation 
evolved. The "local" version became a phonetic sounding to accommodate 
French speakers who could not pronounce in the British way. Waltham was 
first settled in 1634 as part of Watertown and was officially incorporated 
as a separate town in 1738.[4] In the early 19th century, Francis Cabot 
Lowell and his friends and colleagues established in Waltham the Boston 
Manufacturing Company – the first integrated textile mill in the United 
States, with the goal of eliminating the problems of co-ordination, quality 
control, and shipping inherent in the subcontracting based textile industry. 
The Waltham–Lowell system of production derives its name from the city 
and the founder of the mill.[5] The city is home to a number of large estates, 
including Gore Place, a mansion built in 1806 for former Massachusetts 
governor Christopher Gore, the Robert Treat Paine Estate, a residence designed 
by architect Henry Hobson Richardson and landscape architect Frederick 
Law Olmsted for philanthropist Robert Treat Paine, Jr. (1810–1905), and 
the Lyman Estate, a 400-acre (1.6 km2) estate built in 1793 by Boston merchant 
Theodore Lyman. In 1857, The Waltham Model 1857, was a watch made by the 
American Watch Company in the city of Waltham, Massachusetts, in the United 
States of America. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Waltham was 
home to the brass era automobile manufacturer Metz, where the first production 
motorcycle in the U.S. was built. Another first in Waltham industrial history 
involves the method to mass-produce the magnetron tube, invented by Percy 
Spencer at Raytheon. During World War II, the magnetron tube technology 
was applied to radar. Later, magnetron tubes were used as components in 
microwave ovens. Waltham was also the home of the Walter E. Fernald State 
School, the western hemisphere's oldest publicly funded institution serving 
people with developmental disabilities. The storied and controversial history 
of the institution has long been covered by local and at times, national 
media.[citation needed] Waltham is located at 42°22′50″N 71°14′6″W﻿ / ﻿42.38056°N
