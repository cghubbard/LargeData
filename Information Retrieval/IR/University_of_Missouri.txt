The University of Missouri (also, Mizzou, MU, or University of Missouri–Columbia) 
is a public land-grant research university located in Columbia, Missouri, 
U.S. It was founded in 1839 as the first public institution of higher education 
west of the Mississippi River. As the largest university in the state, 
it enrolled 32,777 students[6] in 2016, offering over 300 degree programs 
in 19 academic colleges in the 2014–2015 school year.[8] It is the flagship 
campus of the University of Missouri System, which also maintains campuses 
in Rolla, Kansas City, and St. Louis. MU is one of the nation's top-tier 
R1 institutions and one of the 34 public universities to be members of 
the Association of American Universities. There are more than 300,000 MU 
alumni living worldwide with over one half continuing to reside in Missouri.[9] 
The university was ranked 103rd among national universities in the 2016 
U.S. News & World Report rankings . Starting in December 1953, it boasts 
the country's only university-owned TV network (NBC) affiliate (KOMU), 
operated by the Missouri School of Journalism.[8] In 1908, the world's 
first school of journalism was founded by Walter Williams as the Missouri 
School of Journalism.[10] The University of Missouri Research Reactor Center 
is the world's most powerful university research reactor.[11][12] MU is 
one of only six public universities in the United States with a school 
of medicine, veterinary medicine, engineering, agriculture, and law all 
on one campus. The university also owns the University of Missouri Health 
Care system, which operates four hospitals in Mid-Missouri. The only athletic 
program that operates a NCAA Division I FBS football team in Missouri is 
known as the Missouri Tigers and competes as a member of the Southeastern 
Conference. The school's mascot, Truman the Tiger, is named after Missourian 
and former U.S. president Harry S. Truman. According to the NCAA, the American 
tradition of homecoming was established at the university in 1911; the 
tradition has since been adopted nationwide. In 1839, the Missouri Legislature 
passed the Geyer Act to establish funds for a state university.[13] It 
would be the first public university west of the Mississippi River.[14] 
To secure the university, the citizens of Columbia and Boone County pledged 
$117,921 in cash and land to beat out five other central Missouri counties 
for the location of the state university.[14] The land on which the university 
was eventually constructed was just south of Columbia's downtown and owned 
by James S. Rollins. He was later called the "Father of the University."[15] 
As the first public university in the Louisiana Purchase, the school was 
shaped by Thomas Jefferson's ideas about public education.[16] In 1862 
the American Civil War forced the university to close for much of the year.[17] 
Residents of Columbia formed a "home guard" militia that became known as 
the "Fighting Tigers of Columbia". They were given the name for their readiness 
to protect the city and university. In 1890, the university's newly formed 
football team took the name the "Tigers" after the Civil War militia.[18] 
In 1870 the institution was granted land-grant college status under the 
Morrill Act of 1862.[16] The act led to the founding of the Missouri School 
of Mines and Metallurgy as an offshoot of the main campus in Columbia. 
It developed as the present-day Missouri University of Science and Technology.[16] 
In 1888 the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station opened. This grew 
to encompass ten centers and research farms around Missouri.[14] By 1890 
the university encompassed a normal college (for training of teachers of 
students through high school), engineering college, arts and science college, 
school of agriculture and mechanical arts. school of medicine, and school 
of law.[17] On January 9, 1892, Academic Hall, the institution's main building, 
burned in a fire that completely gutted the building, leaving little more 
standing than six stone Ionic columns.[19] Under the administration of 
Missouri Governor David R. Francis, the university was rebuilt, with additions 
that shaped the modern institution. After the fire, some state residents 
tried to have the university moved further west to Sedalia; but Columbia 
rallied support to keep it. The columns were retained as a symbol of the 
historic campus. Today they are surrounded by the Francis Quadrangle, the 
oldest part of campus. At the southern end of the quad is Academic Hall's 
replacement, Jesse Hall, named for Richard Jesse (the president of the 
university at the time of the fire). Built in 1895, Jesse Hall holds many 
administrative offices and Jesse Auditorium. The buildings surrounding 
the quad were constructed of red brick, leading to this area becoming known 
as Red Campus. The area was tied together in planned landscaping and walks 
in 1910 by George Kessler in a City Beautiful design of the grounds.[20] 
Jesse Hall is scheduled for a $9.8 mil. makeover to include a fire sprinkler 
system, work on its elevators, and a new heating and cooling system as 
part of a $92 mil. total renovation package approved by the Board of Curators 
in June 2013. This upgrade is expected to be completed in March 2015.[21] 
To the east of the quadrangle, later buildings constructed of white limestone 
in 1913 and 1914 to accommodate the new academic programs became known 
as the White Campus. In 1908 the world's first journalism school opened 
at MU. It became notable for its "Missouri Method" of hands-on, experience-based 
instruction. It later established an award for "Distinguished Journalism". 
In April 1923, a black janitor was accused of the rape of the daughter 
of a University of Missouri professor. James T. Scott was abducted from 
the Boone County jail by a mob of townsfolk and students, and was lynched 
to death from a bridge near the campus before his trial took place.[22] 
In the winter of 1935, four graduates of Lincoln University—a traditionally 
black school about 30 miles (48 km) away in Jefferson City—were denied 
admission to MU's graduate school. One of the students, Lloyd L. Gaines, 
brought his case to the United States Supreme Court. On December 12, 1938, 
in a landmark 6–2 decision, the court ordered the State of Missouri to 
admit Gaines to MU's law school or provide a facility of equal stature. 
Gaines disappeared in Chicago on March 19, 1939, under suspicious circumstances. 
The university granted Gaines a posthumous honorary law degree in May 2006.[23] 
Undergraduate divisions were integrated by court order in 1950, when the 
university was compelled to admit African Americans to courses that were 
not offered at Lincoln University. On June 5, 1935, the university erected 
a memorial to the Confederate soldiers of Missouri popularly known as the 
Confederate Rock. The monument was removed in 1974.[24] After World War 
II, the enrollment at universities around the country grew at an extraordinary 
pace, and MU was no exception. This was due in part to the G.I. Bill, which 
allowed veterans to attend college with the assistance of the federal government. 
Following the 2015–16 University of Missouri protests, the chancellor and 
System president resigned, amid racial complaints by students.[25] The 
campus of the University of Missouri is 1,262-acre (2.0 sq mi; 510.7 ha)[2] 
just south of Downtown Columbia and is maintained as a botanical garden. 
The historical campus is centered on Francis Quadrangle, a historic district 
that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and contains 
a number of buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. The 
academic buildings are classified as two main groups: Red Campus and White 
Campus. Red Campus is the historical core of mostly brick academic buildings 
around the landmark columns of the Francis Quadrangle; it includes Jesse 
Hall and Switzler Hall. In the early 20th century, the College of Agriculture 
began a period of rapid expansion in which several buildings were constructed 
to accommodate the growing program and student body. The new buildings, 
constructed in Neo-Gothic style from native Missouri limestone, form the 
White Campus. Its most notable building is Memorial Union. During the 1990s, 
Red Campus was extended to the south with the creation of the Carnahan 
Quadrangle. Hulston Hall of the University of Missouri School of Law, completed 
in 1988, formed the eastern border of the future quad. The Reynolds Alumni 
Center was completed in 1992 on the west side of the new quad. It was completed 
in 2002 with Cornell Hall of the Trulaske College of Business and Tiger 
Plaza. Plans for a new plaza on the north end of the Carnahan Quadrangle 
were unveiled in 2014. Called Traditions Plaza, it was opened on October 
25, 2014 during homecoming festivities.[26] While the original MU intercollegiate 
athletic facilities, such as Rollins Field and Rothwell Gymnasium, were 
located just south of the academic buildings, later expanded facilities 
were constructed across Stadium Boulevard, where Memorial Stadium opened 
in 1926. The Hearnes Center was built to the east of the stadium in 1972. 
In 1994, the university developed the first draft of a master plan for 
the campus to tie together all of Tiger athletic facilities to the south 
of Stadium Boulevard and add to its design. Today, the MU Sports Park includes 
the Mizzou Arena, Taylor Stadium, Walton Stadium, Mizzou Athletics Training 
Complex, University Field and Devine Pavilion. Student athletic facilities 
remain in the core area of campus. Rothwell Gymnasium and Brewer Fieldhouse 
are part of the 283,579-square-foot (26,345.4 m2) Student Recreation Center, 
which was ranked number one in the nation in 2005 by Sports Illustrated.[27] 
The main campus of the University of Missouri Hospitals and Clinics is 
north of the sports complex. It includes the University of Missouri Hospital 
and Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital. Two of the hospitals, Columbia Regional 
Hospital and Ellis Fischel Cancer Center, are located northeast of the 
main campus near I-70. To the south of the MU Sports Park is the MU Research 
Park. It includes the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center, International 
Institute for Nano and Molecular Medicine, MU Life Science Business Incubator 
at Monsanto Place, and Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center. In 2005, 
the University of Missouri Board of Curators approved legislation to designate 
the South Farm of the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources 
(CAFNR) as a research park. The 114-acre (46.1 ha) park, located three 
miles (4.8 km) southeast of the main campus on US63, is now known as Discovery 
Ridge Research Park. Tenants at Discovery Ridge include ABC Laboratories 
and the MU Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory. The main campus is flanked 
to the east and west by Greek Life housing. The University of Missouri 
has nearly 50 national social fraternities and sororities, many of which 
occupy historical residences now valued in the millions of dollars. Beta 
Sigma Psi, Kappa Alpha Order, Sigma Chi, Beta Theta Pi, Alpha Gamma Rho, 
Tau Kappa Epsilon and Sigma Nu form a Greek Row (also called Frat Row) 
along College Avenue in the East Campus area. Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma, 
Lambda Chi Alpha, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon are located in the West Campus 
area along Stewart Street, which leads directly into the Francis Quadrangle. 
Most of the Greek-letter organizations are located in a Greek Town, with 
approximately 30 Greek residences, to the north of Memorial Stadium. The 
main campus, along with all other MU-owned or operated facilities, is protected 
by the University of Missouri Police Department, which is located in the 
Virginia Avenue parking garage on the main campus. MU is one of six public 
universities that houses a law school, medical school, and a veterinary 
medicine school on the same campus.[citation needed] In Missouri, MU is 
the designated land-grant university (along with Lincoln University), the 
largest public research institution. It is the only Missouri university 
that is both a member of the Association of American Universities and designated 
as a "Doctoral/Research Extensive" university by the Carnegie Foundation 
for the Advancement of Teaching. Only 35 universities in the nation have 
both such designations. As of March 2012, the University of Missouri Research 
Reactor Center is the highest power university reactor in the U.S. at 10 
megawatt (10 million watts) thermal output. In 1908, the Missouri School 
of Journalism (known colloquially as the "J-school"), was founded in Columbia, 
claiming to be the first of its kind internationally. The French established 
their Ecole Supérieure de Journalisme de Paris in 1899.[37] The UM System 
owns and operates KOMU-TV, the NBC/CW affiliate for Columbia and nearby 
Jefferson City. It is a full-fledged commercial station and a working lab 
for journalism students. The MU School of Journalism publishes the Columbia 
Missourian and Vox Magazine,[38] where students learn reporting, editing 
and design in a newsroom managed by professional editors. It operates the 
local National Public Radio Station KBIA and produces Radio Adelante, a 
Spanish-language radio program. Founded in 1978 after 23 years as a unit 
of the School of Medicine, the School of Health Professions became an autonomous 
division in December 2000. The school's five departments and eight accredited 
academic programs have a long history, some dating to the early 20th century. 
It is Missouri's only state-supported school of health professions on a 
campus with an academic health center, and the only allied health school 
in the UM system.[39] The university maintains the largest library collection 
in the State of Missouri. As of the 2011–12 academic year, the collection 
held 3.1 million volumes, 8.1 million microforms, 678,596 e-books, almost 
1.7 million government documents, more than 284,000 print maps, and more 
than 53,000 journal subscriptions.[2][40] The collection is housed in Ellis 
Library, the University Archives, and seven other specialized academic 
libraries across campus.[2][41] Most of the original collection, housed 
in Academic Hall, was lost in the 1892 fire. During the American Civil 
War, Union troops used the Library in Academic Hall as a guard room. The 
Union troops caused significant damage, including taking 467 volumes to 
build fires. The Board of Curators later sued the US Army for the destruction 
on campus. Settled in 1915, the suit's award was used to build the Memorial 
Gateway on the northern edge of Red Campus.[42] In 1913, construction began 
on a new main library, completed in 1915. It was expanded in 1935, 1958, 
and 1985. It was dedicated as Elmer Ellis Library on October 10, 1972, 
in honor of the thirteenth president of the University of Missouri. Today, 
the MU libraries are home to the 47th largest research collection in North 
America.[43] The Jeffrey E. Smith Institute of Real Estate was founded 
in 2005 by a donation from alumnus Jeffrey Smith to meet the growing interest 
of students in the College of Business, seeking to learn more about the 
real estate industry. MU merged two of its departments, the Center for 
Distance and Independent Study and MU Direct: Continuing and Distance Education, 
forming Mizzou Online in 2011.[44][45] Mizzou Online offers online courses 
for 18 of the university's colleges[44] and operates the University of 
Missouri High School, a distance learning K-12 high school.[46] The University 
of Missouri is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium. Now renamed the 
SECU, the initiative was a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, 
scholarship and achievement amongst the member universities in the Southeastern 
conference. The SECU formed its mission to serve as a means to bolster 
collaborative academic endeavors of Southeastern Conference universities. 
Its goals include highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC faculty, 
students and its universities and advancing the academic reputation of 
SEC universities.[47][48] In 2013, the University of Missouri participated 
in the SEC Symposium in Atlanta, Georgia which was organized and led by 
the University of Georgia and the UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute. 
The topic of the Symposium was titled, the "Impact of the Southeast in 
the World's Renewable Energy Future."[49] Each campus of the University 
of Missouri System is led by a chancellor, who reports to the president 
of the UM System. Prior to the formation of the system in 1963, the Columbia 
campus and its offshoot in Rolla were led directly by the president and 
the position of chancellor did not exist. See University of Missouri System#Presidents 
for a list of presidents from 1963–present. This list does not include 
interim presidents or chancellors.[56][57] John Lathrop is the only president 
or chancellor to have served nonconsecutive terms. Presidents, 1841–63 
and Chancellors, 1963–present † Ellis became president of the University 
of Missouri System upon its creation, serving until 1966. From its inception 
in 1839 until the creation of the University of Missouri System in 1963, 
the university in Columbia was known simply as the University of Missouri. 
Upon creation of the system, each university was renamed with its host 
city; thus, the university in Columbia became the University of Missouri–Columbia. 
In the proceeding decades, colloquial and verbal usage of the generic name 
in reference to MU continued. There were various attempts to drop Columbia 
from its name by students, faculty, alumni, and administrators who felt 
it might cause the university to be perceived as a regional institution. 
This change was long resisted by the UM System and the other universities 
on the basis of uniformity and fairness. However, after a renewed effort 
for "name restoration", the Board of Curators voted unanimously on November 
29, 2007 to allow MU to drop Columbia from its name for effectively all 
public purposes.[60] Continued use of the name University of Missouri–Columbia 
is not incorrect but is being phased out by MU, except as required on official 
internal documents within the UM System. Its use also continues to be advocated 
by some faculty, administration, and alumni of UMKC, UMSL, and Missouri 
S&T.[61][62] The University of Missouri operates 23 on-campus residence 
halls and least two other off-campus sites. The two off-campus locations 
include: Tiger Diggs at Campus View Apartments and True Scholars House. 
Many residence halls on campus offer learning communities and freshman 
interest groups. Both programs seek to ensure that students succeed academically 
while living in the residence halls. Three of the older halls: Jones, Lathrop, 
and Laws are scheduled to be torn down and replaced as the largest and 
first part ($71 mil.) of a $92 mil. campus improvement project approved 
by the Board of Curators on June 13, 2013. The plan also includes replacing 
the dining hall north of Faurot Field. The three halls presently can house 
up to 1,010 students. The new halls will expand the capacity to 1,242 by 
the time the first part is completed in May 2017. The renovation of Swallow 
Hall (1893) is also part of the plan, costing $11.5 mil. of the total.[21] 
Two residence halls, Excellence and Respect will be on standby starting 
in the Fall 2016 semester, and only used if necessary because Fall enrollment 
is expected to drop by 1,500 students, which it did by 2,273 including 
1,412 fewer freshmen.[6] The 319 beds will be used over the summer until 
August 4, 2016. Both halls will undergo repairs if not needed. The new 
George C. Brooks Hall will open as planned for the Fall 2016 semester and 
house 293 students.[63] Residence Halls: Dining Halls: Convenience Store:

Day is an annual spring ceremony in which the identities of the members 
of the six secret honor societies are revealed. The participating societies 
are QEBH, Mystical Seven, LSV, Omicron Delta Kappa, Mortar Board, and the 
Rollins Society. The ceremony, first held in 1927, takes place at the columns 
on Francis Quadrangle. The Associated Students of the University of Missouri 
(ASUM) is a student-run lobbying organization that represents the students' 
interests in the state and national capitals. ASUM's platform has included 
issues such as equalizing the "Access Missouri" grant, expanding "Bright 
Flight" funding, and giving students a vote on the Board of Curators. The 
Trulaske Consulting Association was started in 2009.[66] It is a relatively 
new student organization and is open to students of all departments. However 
most members are MBA and undergrad business students. The association aims 
to increase awareness, provide exposure, and facilitate networking between 
students and professionals in the consulting industry.[67] The growing 
popularity of the association has been attributed to the resources available 
to student members. Workshops by management consultants and case studies 
on strategy form an integral part of the activities organised by TCA.[68] 
The Muslim Student Organisation (MSO) provides an inclusive, inviting educational 
and social environment for the Muslims at the University of Missouri-Columbia; 
and works to create bridges between Muslims and other groups in the Columbia 
community.[69] The Muslim Student Organisation engages in religious, educational, 
and social activities that aim to increase unity on campus and awareness 
of Islam among Muslims and people of other faiths.[70] The Organization 
aspires to promote a healthy understanding of Islam in the context of social 
and cultural settings.[71] MSO membership is open to all students at MU. 
Rabbi Avraham Lapine of Chabad provides a wide range of services to students, 
including teaching courses at The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute's Sinai 
Scholars, which allows students to explore the modern significance of the 
Ten Commandments.[72][73][74][75] MU is home to one of the oldest and largest 
Greek systems in the nation. Founded in 1869, the Greek Community represents 
22% of the student population. The university is home to the first chapter 
of an existing national fraternity founded at a public institution west 
of the Mississippi. Currently, more than 70 Greek-letter organizations 
remain active at MU. The Missouri Tigers are a member of the Southeastern 
Conference with the exception of wrestling, which competes in the Mid-American 
Conference. Mizzou is the only school in the state with all of its sports 
in the NCAA Division I and a football team that competes in the NCAA Division 
I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). These are the highest levels of college 
sports in the United States. The official colors are black and gold. Athletic 
sports for the Tigers include men's and women's basketball, baseball, cross 
country, football, golf, gymnastics, swimming & diving, softball, track, 
tennis, volleyball, women's soccer, and wrestling. Historic sports included 
a shooting club, in which the ladies' team in 1934 won a national championship. 
Former football coach Gary Pinkel holds the record at the university for 
the most wins on the gridiron. Additionally, former basketball coach and 
alum Norm Stewart maintains the record for the most wins on the hardcourt. 
MU football games are played on Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium ("The 
Zou"). Built in 1926, this stadium has an official capacity of 71,168,[76] 
and features a nearly 100 ft (30 m) wide "M" behind the north-end zone. 
Men's and women's basketball games are played at the Mizzou Arena, located 
just south of the football stadium. The Hearnes Center had hosted men's 
and women's basketball from 1972 to 2004 and it is still used for other 
athletic (wrestling) and school events. The Missouri Tiger men's basketball 
team has had 22 NCAA Tournament appearances, the second-most Tournament 
appearances without a Final Four. The Tigers have appeared in the regional 
finals (Elite Eight) of the NCAA Tournament six times (twice under coach 
Norm Stewart, Missouri head coach from 1967 to 1999). The Tigers have won 
15 conference championships in total beginning with the Missouri Valley 
Conference, followed by the Big Six, the Big Eight, and the Big 12 Conference. 
In 1994, the Tigers went undefeated in the Big Eight to take the regular 
season title. In 2009, Missouri won its first Big 12 Championship[78] over 
Baylor. Missouri went on to win its second Big 12 Championship in its final 
season in the Big 12 in 2012, once again defeating Baylor. Standout players 
from the Mizzou's basketball team include, Anthony Peeler, John Brown, 
Jon Sundvold, Steve Stipanovich, Kareem Rush, Keyon Dooling Doug Smith, 
Willie Smith, Norm Stewart, Linas Kleiza, Derrick Chievous, DeMarre Carroll, 
Kim English. Jordan Clarkson and Marcus Denmon. The official mascot for 
Missouri Tigers athletics is Truman the Tiger, created on September 16, 
1986. Following a campus-wide contest, Truman was named in honor of Harry 
S. Truman, the only U.S. president from Missouri. Today, Truman appears 
to cheer on the team, mingle with supporters at Mizzou athletic events 
as well as at pep-rallies, alumni association functions, and frequent visits 
to Columbia-area schools. On November 24, 2007, the Mizzou football team 
played against its biggest rival, Kansas, at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas 
City, Missouri. At that time, KU was ranked No. 2 and MU was ranked No. 
3 nationally. At the end of the game, Mizzou defeated KU, 36–28. The following 
day MU was ranked No. 1 in the country for the second time in its history. 
On December 1, 2007, the Mizzou football team lost the Big 12 Championship 
game in San Antonio, Texas, to Oklahoma 38–17, falling out of national 
title and Bowl Championship Series contention. The team regrouped and played 
in the Cotton Bowl January 1, 2008, at Dallas, Texas, defeating Arkansas, 
38–7. In the final Associated Press "Top 25 football poll" of the 2007 
season, Mizzou was ranked No. 4 in the country, its highest finishing position 
in the team's history. On November 6, 2011, the University of Missouri 
announced that it would be leaving the Big 12 Conference to join the Southeastern 
Conference effective July 1, 2012.[79] In September 2012, the school's 
wrestling team became an associate member of the Mid-American Conference, 
as the SEC does not sponsor wrestling. On December 7, 2013, Mizzou played 
in the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta in the Georgia Dome against Auburn. 
The teams were ranked 5th and 3rd, respectively in the nation. Mizzou fell 
to the eventual national runners-up 59-42, and ended up playing in the 
2014 Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas. Missouri (#9) defeated Oklahoma State 
(#13) 41-31, winning their second Cotton Bowl Classic.[80] On December 
6, 2014, #17 Mizzou played #1 Alabama in its second consecutive SEC Championship 
Game falling to the Crimson Tide, 42-13. Mizzou went on to play Minnesota 
in the Citrus Bowl, winning 33-17 and finishing #16 in the nation. The 
Tiger Walk is held annually before the fall semester in the Quad, as welcome 
and orientation for new students to the university. Students can meet and 
also learn about school organizations, which have stations around the Quad. 
After hearing of the four pillars of success, students walk in procession 
through the quad and the The Columns toward Jesse Hall, symbolizing their 
entrance into the university. Tiger Prowl is held for graduation seniors 
on the quad. They walk through the columns, away from Jesse Hall, to symbolize 
becoming alumni. The university song is "Old Missouri". With lyrics written 
in 1895, it is sung to the tune of "Annie Lisle." First verse: Old Missouri, 
fair Missouri Dear old Varsity. Ours are hearts that fondly love thee Here's 
a health to thee. Chorus: Proud art thou in classic beauty Of thy noble 
past With thy watch words: honour, duty, Thy high fame shall last! Second 
verse: Every student, man and maiden Swells the glad refrain. 'Till the 
breezes, music laden Waft it back again. (repeat chorus) University of 
Missouri is the originator of "Homecoming" in the US, a tradition rapidly 
adopted by many other colleges and high schools across the country. In 
1911, athletic director Chester Brewer invited alumni to "come home" for 
the big football game against the University of Kansas. A spirit rally 
and parade were planned as part of the celebration. The Council for Advancement 
and Support of Education has called MU's homecoming celebration the best 
in the nation and a model program. Missouri Homecoming also includes several 
service elements, and the homecoming blood drive has earned the Guinness 
Record as the nation's largest.[81] The annual tuition for in-state residents 
for 2016-17 is $9,518 and $25,892 for out-of-state residents, plus $10,298 
for room and board on campus with that total not counting books and supplies 
($1,344) or transportation ($4,756) expenses.[2] A 1.7% undergraduate increase 
in tuition and fees was previously approved in the 2014 operating budget 
by the Board of Curators in June 2013, which also approved salary increases 
of 1.5% to 3% for the faculty.[21] In the Spring of 2016, there are 300,315 
living alumni worldwide. 274,447 reside in the United States, 156,585 in 
Missouri, 61,346 in the St. Louis area, 30,018 in the Kansas City area, 
and 2,718 outside the U.S.[9] William F. Baker Engineer of Burj Khalifa
