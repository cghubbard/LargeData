The Cincinnati Reds' 1999 season was a season in American baseball. During 
the season the Reds became a surprising contender in the National League 
Central, winning 96 games and narrowly losing the division to the Houston 
Astros, ultimately missing the playoffs after losing a one game playoff 
with the New York Mets.[1] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G =

the most since the 1976 Big Red Machine who compiled 102 victories en route 
to their second consecutive World Series title. The Reds would not reach 
the 90-win plateau again until the 2010 season, when the team won the National 
League Central title with 91 victories.[10] The 1999 team is regarded as 
one of the best teams not to make the playoffs. Since the switch to 162 
game season in 1963, the Reds have the sixth-best record, only to not make 
the playoffs at 96-67.[11] The team scored 865 runs, which still stands 
as the franchise record for runs scored in a season. The team also set 
franchise highs in most runs batted in (820), most total bases (2,549), 
and highest slugging percentage (.451)[10] On May 19, 1999 the Reds set 
three franchise records when they collected 28 hits, 15 extra base hits, 
and 55 total bases in a 24-12 victory over the Colorado Rockies. Sean Casey 
and Jeffrey Hammonds also set individual franchise records with each scoring 
five runs.[12] On September 4, 1999 the Reds set a franchise record when 
they clubbed nine home runs in a 22-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.[12]
