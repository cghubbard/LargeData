Horace Owen Eller (July 5, 1894 – July 18, 1961) was a pitcher in Major 
League Baseball. Eller started his minor league career in 1913. In 1915, 
he won 19 games for the Moline Plowboys of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. 
His performance gained the attention of the Cincinnati Reds, and he was 
drafted by the team after the 1916 season. He pitched five years for the 
Reds, going 60–40 with a 2.62 earned run average (108 Adjusted ERA+). Eller 
peaked in the Reds' pennant-winning 1919 season. He led the team in innings, 
and went 19–9 with a 2.39 ERA. On May 11 of that season, Eller no-hit the 
St. Louis Cardinals 6-0 at Redland Field.[1] He then pitched two complete 
game victories in the World Series, but it was later revealed that members 
of the Chicago White Sox had intentionally thrown the series for money.[2] 
In Game Five of that Series, Eller shut out the White Sox 5–0 with nine 
strikeouts, including six consecutively—a record that would be tied by 
Moe Drabowsky in the 1966 World Series opener. After his major league career 
ended, Eller played in the minors for a few years, last playing for the 
Indianapolis Indians in 1924. The Baseball Record Book records that on 
August 21, 1917, Eller struck out three batters on nine pitches in the 
ninth inning of a 7–5 win over the New York Giants; however, the New York 
Times from the day after the game noted that Eller allowed a single to 
start that inning, and so did not officially achieve an immaculate inning.[3]
