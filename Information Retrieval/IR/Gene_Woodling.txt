Eugene Richard Woodling (August 16, 1922 – June 2, 2001) was a professional 
baseball player. He played all or part of seventeen seasons in Major League 
Baseball for the Cleveland Indians (1943, 1946, 1955–57), Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1947), New York Yankees (1949–54), Baltimore Orioles (1955, 1958–60), 
Washington Senators (1961–62), and the New York Mets in their expansion 
year of 1962. Primarily an outfielder, he played most often in left field. 
He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was born in Akron, Ohio. 
Before coming to the majors, Woodling was a four-time minor league batting 
champion. He mostly played left field when he entered the majors after 
his time in the U.S. Navy, but spent much time in right field and also 
played ninety-three games in center. Woodling played with many teams during 
his career, the longest term of service being with the Yankees for six 
years. With them, Woodling had what was probably his best year, 1953. Although 
he only had 395 at bats, he led the American League with a .429 on-base 
percentage. While Woodling was with the Yankees, the team won five consecutive 
World Series (1949–53). During that time, Yankee manager Casey Stengel 
praised the outfielder's ability to run and throw. Stengel generally platooned 
him with right-hander Hank Bauer, but each averaged 400 at bats per season. 
Woodling hit a solo home run in each World Series from 1951 through 1953, 
and, in 1951, helped Allie Reynolds secure his first of two no-hitters 
on the season, when he homered in a 1–0 win over Bob Feller and the Indians. 
In 1952, Woodling became the first player to pinch-hit a triple in the 
World Series. On November 17, 1954, a record seventeen-player deal took 
place between the Orioles and Yankees, involving Woodling, future twenty-game 
winner Bob Turley and Don Larsen, who would go on to pitch a perfect game 
in the 1956 World Series for New York. Woodling had been sidelined for 
the last part of the 1954 season with a broken arm. Soon, Woodling moved 
to the Indians where he set career-highs in home runs (19), runs batted 
in (78), and batting (.321) in 1957. A few months before he turned forty, 
he was sent to the New York Mets, where old Yankees manager Casey Stengel 
was working on his latest project, the newborn Mets. Woodling would be 
managed by Stengel for the remainder of the 1962 season. He was released 
before the 1963 season, after publicly criticizing the front office's contract 
negotiations with Marv Throneberry. In a seventeen-season career, Woodling 
batted .284 with 147 home runs and 830 RBI in 1796 games. Woodling ended 
with a .386 on-base percentage and 1585 career hits in 5587 at bats. Woodling 
was appointed on November 20, 1963 as the Orioles' first-base coach by 
former Yankees teammate Hank Bauer who had become the team's manager one 
day earlier.[1] He remained in that capacity through the 1966 World Series 
Championship season and up until the announcement on September 28, 1967 
that he would not be retained for the 1968 season.[2] Woodling died in 
a nursing home in Wadsworth, Ohio. His biggest contribution to baseball 
may have come off the field. He worked to help bring a pension fund for 
major league players. "He was just such a great guy", said former Yankees
