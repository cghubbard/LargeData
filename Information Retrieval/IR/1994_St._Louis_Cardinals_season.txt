The St. Louis Cardinals 1994 season was the team's 113th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 103rd season in the National League. The Cardinals 
went 53-61 during the season and finished tied for 3rd place with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the National League Central division, 13 games behind the Cincinnati 
Reds. The season was cut short due to the infamous 1994 player's strike. 
Catcher Tom Pagnozzi won a Gold Glove this year. By Friday, August 12, 
the Cardinals had compiled a 53-61 record through 114 games (although they 
had actually played 115 games, since their April 6 match versus the Cincinnati 
Reds at Riverfront Stadium ended after the top of the 6th inning due to 
poor weather[4]). They had scored 535 runs (4.65 per game) and allowed 
621 runs (5.40 per game).[5] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G
