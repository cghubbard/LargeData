Class A (1962-1989) San Francisco Giants (1962) Lakeland Tigers (1963–2006) 
Lakeland Giants (1962) The Lakeland Flying Tigers are a minor league baseball 
team based in Lakeland, Florida. Home games are played at Publix Field 
at Joker Marchant Stadium; opened in 1966 and renovated in 2002-03. The 
park, which also doubles as the Detroit Tigers spring training home, seats 
8,500 fans. Renovations are set to be completed in the spring of 2017. 
It plays in the Florida State League and has been the High-A affiliate 
of the Tigers since 1963, one of the two longest unbroken affiliate relationships 
currently existing.[1] Until November 2006, the team was known as the Lakeland 
Tigers, with branding similar to the parent club. However the team originated 
in 1960 as the Lakeland Indians, an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. 
After a one-year hiatus, the team was restarted in 1962 as the Lakeland 
Giants, and an affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. In 2012, the Flying 
Tigers won their first FSL title in twenty years by defeating the Jupiter 
Hammerheads, three games to two. It was the fourth league title in club 
history.[2] In 2006, the team introduced a new name and colors to pay homage 
to the Lakeland School of Aeronautics, later the Lodwick School of Aeronautics. 
The school trained over 8,000 pilots between 1940 and 1945, some of whom 
later flew with the Flying Tigers in China during World War II,[3] and 
was actually located at the current site of Publix Field at Joker Marchant 
Stadium.[4] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches 7-day
