The Curse of the Bambino was a superstition evolving from the failure of 
the Boston Red Sox baseball team to win the World Series in the 86-year 
period from 1918 to 2004. While some fans took the curse seriously, most 
used the expression in a tongue-in-cheek manner.[1] This misfortune began 
after the Red Sox sold star player Babe Ruth, sometimes called The Bambino, 
to the New York Yankees in the off-season of 1919–1920.[2] Before that 
point, the Red Sox had been one of the most successful professional baseball 
franchises, winning the first World Series and amassing five World Series 
titles.[3] After the sale they went without a title for decades, even while 
the Red Sox won four American League championships from 1914 to 1918, as 
the previously lackluster Yankees became one of the most successful franchises 
in North American professional sports.[4] The curse became a focal point 
of the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry over the years. Talk of the curse as an 
ongoing phenomenon ended in 2004, when the Red Sox came back from a 0–3 
best-of-seven deficit to beat the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship 
Series (ALCS) and then went on to sweep the St. Louis Cardinals to win 
the 2004 World Series.[5] The curse had been such a part of Boston culture 
that when a "reverse curve" road sign on Longfellow Bridge over the city's 
busy Storrow Drive was graffitied to read "Reverse The Curse",[6] officials 
left it in place until after the Red Sox won the 2004 Series. After the 
Red Sox won the last game of the World Series that year, the road sign 
was edited to read "Curse Reversed" in celebration.[6] Although it had 
long been noted that the selling of Ruth had been the beginning of a decline 
in the Red Sox' fortunes, the term "curse of the Bambino" was not in common 
use until the publication of the book The Curse of the Bambino by Dan Shaughnessy 
in 1990. It became a key part of the Red Sox lore in the media thereafter, 
and Shaughnessy's book became required reading in some high school English 
classes in New England.[7][8] Although the title drought dated back to 
1918, the sale of Ruth to the Yankees was completed January 3, 1920.[9] 
In standard curse lore, Red Sox owner and theatrical producer Harry Frazee 
used the proceeds from the sale to finance the production of a Broadway 
musical, usually said to be No, No, Nanette.[10] In fact, Frazee backed 
many productions before and after Ruth's sale, and No, No, Nanette did 
not see its first performance until five years after the Ruth sale and 
two years after Frazee sold the Red Sox. In 1921, Red Sox manager Ed Barrow 
left to take over as general manager of the Yankees. Other Red Sox players 
were later sold or traded to the Yankees as well.[11] Neither the lore, 
nor the debunking of it, entirely tells the story. As Leigh Montville wrote 
in The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth, the production No, No, 
Nanette had originated as a non-musical stage play called My Lady Friends, 
which opened on Broadway in December 1919.[12] That play had, indeed, been 
financed as a direct result of the Ruth deal.[13] Various researchers, 
including Montville and Shaughnessy, have pointed out that Frazee had close 
ties to the Yankees owners, and that many of the player deals, as well 
as the mortgage deal for Fenway Park itself, had to do with financing his 
plays.[12] Yankee fans taunted the Red Sox with chants of "1918!" one weekend 
in September 1990.[14] The demeaning chant echoed at Yankee Stadium each 
time the Red Sox were there. Yankee fans also taunted the Red Sox with 
signs saying "1918!", "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO," pictures of Babe Ruth, and 
wearing "1918!" T-shirts each time they were at the Stadium.[15][16] Before 
Ruth left Boston, the Red Sox had won five of the first fifteen World Series, 
with Ruth pitching for the 1916 and 1918 championship teams (he was with 
the Sox for the 1915 World Series but the manager used him only once, as 
a pinch-hitter, and he did not pitch). The Yankees had not played in any 
World Series up to that time. In the 84 years after the sale, the Yankees 
played in 39 World Series, winning 26 of them, twice as many as any other 
team in Major League Baseball. Meanwhile, over the same time span, the 
Red Sox played in only four World Series and lost each in seven games.[7] 
Even losses that occurred many years before the first mention of the supposed 
curse, in 1986,[7] have been attributed to it. Some of these instances 
are listed below: Red Sox fans attempted various methods over the years 
to exorcise their famous curse. These included placing a Boston cap atop 
Mt. Everest and burning a Yankees cap at its base camp; hiring professional 
exorcists and Father Guido Sarducci to "purify" Fenway Park; spray painting 
a "Reverse Curve" street sign on Storrow Drive to change it to say "Reverse 
the Curse" (the sign wasn't replaced until just after the 2004 World Series 
win); and finding a piano owned by Ruth that he had supposedly pushed into 
a pond near his Sudbury, Massachusetts farm, Home Plate Farm.[citation 
needed] In Ken Burns' 1994 documentary Baseball, former Red Sox pitcher 
Bill Lee suggested that the Red Sox should exhume the body of Babe Ruth, 
transport it back to Fenway and publicly apologize for trading Ruth to 
the Yankees.[citation needed] Some declared the curse broken during a game 
on August 31, 2004, when a foul ball hit by Manny Ramírez flew into Section 
9, Box 95, Row AA and struck a boy's face, knocking two of his teeth out.[37] 
16-year-old Lee Gavin, a Boston fan whose favorite player was Ramirez, 
lived on the Sudbury farm owned by Ruth. That same day, the Yankees suffered 
their worst loss in team history, a 22–0 clobbering at home against the 
Cleveland Indians.[38][39][40] Some fans also cite a comedy curse-breaking 
ceremony performed by musician Jimmy Buffett and his warm-up team (one 
dressed as Ruth and one dressed as a witch doctor) at a Fenway concert 
in September 2004. Just after being traded to the Red Sox, Curt Schilling 
appeared in an advertisement for the Ford F-150 pickup truck hitchhiking 
with a sign indicating he was going to Boston. When picked up, he said 
that he had "an 86-year-old curse" to break.[citation needed] In 2004, 
the Red Sox once again met the Yankees in the American League Championship 
Series. The Red Sox lost the first three games, including losing Game 3 
at Fenway by the lopsided score of 19–8.[41][42] The Red Sox trailed, 4–3, 
in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 4.[43] But the team tied the game 
with a walk by Kevin Millar and a stolen base by pinch-runner Dave Roberts, 
followed by an RBI single against Yankee closer Mariano Rivera by third 
baseman Bill Mueller, and won on a two-run home run in the 12th inning 
by David Ortiz.[43] The Red Sox won the next three games to become the 
first Major League baseball team to win a seven-game postseason series 
after being down three games to none.[44] The Red Sox then faced the St. 
Louis Cardinals, the team to whom they had lost in 1946 and 1967, and led 
throughout the series, winning in a four-game sweep.[5] Cardinals shortstop 
Edgar Rentería, who wore the same number as Ruth (3), hit the final out 
of the game.[5][45] Glenn Stout argues that the idea of a "curse" was rooted 
originally in antisemitism.[46] Because Frazee was from New York and involved 
in theatre, it was assumed he was Jewish (he was actually a Presbyterian). 
Then-American League president Ban Johnson disliked Frazee for this reason, 
saying he was "too New York" and making reference to the "mystery" of his 
religion—polite code that would have been well understood in the 1920s.[46] 
Though Frazee was well respected in Boston, Henry Ford's Dearborn Independent 
ran a series of articles purporting to expose how Jews were "destroying 
America", and among these were articles lambasting Frazee, saying that 
with his purchase of the Red Sox "another club was placed under the smothering 
influences of the 'chosen race.'"[46] These articles turned the tide of 
both baseball owners and public opinion against Frazee, and Fred Lieb's 
vilification of Frazee in his biography of the Red Sox portrayed him implicitly
