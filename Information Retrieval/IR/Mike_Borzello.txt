Michael Ross "Mike" Borzello (born August 14, 1970) is a Major League catching 
coach for the Chicago Cubs. Borzello is the godson of former Major League 
manager Joe Torre, who was friends with Borzello's father.[1][2] His sister, 
Keri Borzello, was an NCAA Women's College World Series participant in 
1994, as a catcher and first baseman for the Missouri Tigers. She later 
transferred to UCLA after a career ending rotator cuff injury. Early in 
his life, a then-12-year-old Borzello had been serving as a batboy for 
the Atlanta Braves - at that time, managed by Torre - and found himself 
in the middle of a series of brawls between the Braves and the visiting 
San Diego Padres on August 12, 1984 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. "When 
the fans started throwing stuff and jumped onto the field, I was like, 
'OK, I gotta get out of here,' Borzello later said.[3] Borzello is a graduate 
of Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California and California Lutheran 
University.[2] He played catcher in minor league baseball for the St. Louis 
Cardinals farm system from 1991â€“94, never getting above class A.[4] In 
1996, after his playing career ended, Torre offered him a job with the 
New York Yankees as bullpen catcher and batting practice pitcher,[2] Mike 
earned 4 World Series rings with the New York Yankees during the 1996, 
1998, 1999 and 2000 seasons and earned 1 ring with the Cubs during the 
2016 season. When Torre left the Yankees for the Dodgers in 2007, he brought 
Borzello with him as catching instructor.[5] In 2011 he left the Dodgers 
to join the Cubs as a coach, working with the catchers and scouting.[6]
