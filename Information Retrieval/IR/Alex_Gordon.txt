Alexander Jonathan Gordon (born February 10, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball left fielder for the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Prior to playing professionally, Gordon attended the University 
of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he played college baseball for the Nebraska 
Cornhuskers. At Nebraska, Gordon won the Brooks Wallace Award, Dick Howser 
Trophy, and Golden Spikes Award in 2005. That year, the Royals made Gordon 
the second overall pick in the 2005 MLB Draft. Gordon has won four Gold 
Glove Awards, three Fielding Bible Awards, a Platinum Glove Award and one 
Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award in MLB. Prior to 2010, Gordon 
was primarily a third baseman. Alex was born into a baseball-loving family 
in Lincoln, Nebraska. He was a two-time Gatorade Nebraska Player of the 
Year after hitting .483 with 25 home runs and 112 runs batted in (RBIs) 
at Lincoln Southeast High School,[1] from which he graduated in 2002. Gordon 
played American Legion Baseball and earned the organization's Graduate 
of the Year award in 2015.[2] Alex attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln 
and played third base. In his junior year in 2005, he swept the collegiate 
baseball awards for college player of the year, winning the Dick Howser 
Trophy, Golden Spikes Award, the Brooks Wallace Award,[3] and the ABCA 
Rawlings Player of the Year, he was also an ESPY Award Finalist for the 
Best Male College Athlete. He earned 1st-team All-America honors for the 
2nd straight season hitting .372 (94–253) in 72 games with 22 doubles, 
4 triples, 19 home runs and 66 RBI. Gordon was also 23 for 26 in stolen 
base attempts, and drew 63 walks, compared to 38 strikeouts, helping lead 
the Huskers to the 2005 Big 12 regular season and tournament titles and 
the school's 3rd College World Series appearance. He posted a .353 career 
average, he hit 44 homers and drove in 189 runs, drew 139 walks and struck 
out just 106 times and was only the 2nd 2-time 1st-team All-American in 
Nebraska history. He finished the season as the Big 12 leader (conference 
games) in walks and on-base percentage, while ranking 3rd in home runs, 
total bases and slugging percentage. Gordon was the highest draft pick 
out of Nebraska since Darin Erstad was taken 1st overall in the 1995 draft. 
He was named the No. 1 college draft prospect by Baseball America as well 
as the 2nd-best overall prospect, best pure collegiate hitter, the 2nd-best 
collegiate 5-tool talent, 2nd-best collegiate power hitter, best collegiate 
strike-zone judgment and 2nd-closest to the Majors among collegiate players.[citation

of the 2004 U.S. National Team, which had players from 15 different colleges.[4] 
He helped lead Team USA to an 18–7 overall record, seeing the majority 
of his playing time at first base. He hit .388 with 4 home runs, 12 RBI 
and 18 runs scored in 24 contests and was named the top offensive player 
at the World University Baseball Championship in Tainan, Taiwan after leading 
all players with a .524 average (11-for-21) with 2 homers, 5 RBI and 8 
runs scored in 8 games.[5] Alex was drafted in 2005 by the Kansas City 
Royals with the second pick overall. He hit 29 home runs and stole 22 bases 
with an OPS over 1.000 in his first full season in minor league baseball 
with the Double-A Wichita Wranglers. He was generally regarded as one of 
the best hitting prospects in baseball playing in the Texas League All-Star 
game and was selected for the 2006 All-Star Futures Game.[6] Alex declined 
to play for Team USA in 2006, while leading the Wichita Wranglers to the 
Texas League playoffs. He performed exceptionally well in his first full 
minor league season, winning the Texas League Player of the Year awarded 
to the best player and Baseball America's Minor League Player of the Year 
award. In his first major league at-bat, Alex struck out with the bases 
loaded against Curt Schilling but eventually got his first major league 
hit on April 5, 2007, against another celebrated rookie, Boston's Daisuke 
Matsuzaka. On April 10, 2007, he hit his first major league home run off 
pitcher Josh Towers of the Toronto Blue Jays. Alex struggled to begin with, 
but the Royals stayed patient with him.[7] He was hitting .185 with 3 home 
runs and 8 RBI through the first two months as an everyday starter of the 
regular season. However he was hot in June, batting .327 with 3 home runs 
and 14 RBI. He stayed consistent through the summer, hitting .253 in July, 
and .271 in August. However, he slumped to a .244 average for the final 
month of the season. On August 17, Alex got his 100th major league hit 
off pitcher Dan Meyer of the Oakland Athletics. On September 2, Gordon 
had the first multi-home run game of his career, connecting off Boof Bonser 
of the Minnesota Twins in the 2nd inning, and in the 3rd inning off Julio 
DePaula. On September 7, Gordon hit a single off former college teammate 
Joba Chamberlain of the New York Yankees. On September 12, Alex hit his 
34th double of the year in the seventh inning off Glen Perkins of the Twins, 
establishing a Royals rookie record. Alex switched his uniform number from 
7, the number he had as a rookie, to 4, his college number.[8] On Major 
League Baseball's opening day of 2008, March 31, Gordon hit a two-run home 
run off Detroit Tigers ace Justin Verlander, with Mark Grudzielanek on 
first base. The Royals placed Alex on the 15-day disabled list on August 
23 because of a torn muscle in his right quadriceps. He was hitting .254 
and was second on the team with 14 home runs, but also had club-high 109 
strikeouts. Alex made the most errors (16) and had the lowest fielding 
percentage (.955) of all AL third basemen in 2008.[9] Alex struggled in 
the beginning of the 2009 season, hitting just 2-for-21 (.095) with one 
homer and three RBIs in seven games. Gordon was injured on April 11 in 
a game against the New York Yankees when he slid into second base on a 
force play. He underwent surgery on April 17 to repair a tear in the labral 
cartilage of the right hip, and was on the disabled list for twelve weeks.[10] 
After playing a few games in the minors, Alex came off the disabled list 
and rejoined the Royals on July 17 going 1 for 4 against Tampa Bay.[11][12] 
Alex stole home for the first time in his career on August 2 against the 
Rays becoming the first Royal to do that since Mendy Lopez in 2003.[13] 
The Royals optioned Gordon to Triple-A Omaha on August 18 and reinstated 
reliever Kyle Farnsworth from the 15-day DL to take his spot on the active 
roster.[14] After Omaha finished up its season, Gordon returned to the 
Royals in September.[15] Alex began the 2010 season on a minor league rehab 
assignment with Class-A Advanced Wilmington, following a broken thumb suffered 
in Spring Training.[16] Gordon was activated from the disabled list on 
April 17.[17] He was demoted to the minor leagues in May, where he played 
left field.[18] Alex was recalled from Triple-A on July 23, 2010, to take 
the place of David DeJesus in the Royals' outfield, who was placed on the 
disabled list with a right thumb sprain.[19] In spring training in 2011, 
he led the major leagues in RBIs, with 23.[20] Gordon finished 3rd place 
behind Paul Konerko and Victor Martinez in the American League Final Vote 
for the All-Star game with a .299 average to start the year. He broke the 
Royals single season record and led the majors in outfield assists. He 
was also second in the majors in doubles, along with teammate Jeff Francoeur. 
In 2011, he led all major league outfielders in assists, with 20.[21] On 
November 1, 2011 it was announced that he had won his first American League 
Gold Glove for left fielder. On February 9, 2012, Gordon signed a one-year, 
$4.775 million deal with the Royals to avoid arbitration. In the process, 
Gordon filed for $5.45, while the Royals countered with $4.15. Under that 
agreement, he could have earned an additional $25K if he had reached 700 
plate appearances, putting him at the original midpoint.,[22] however, 
on March 30, he signed a four-year, $37.5 million extension with the Royals 
with a player option for 2016, becoming the third Royal player to sign 
an extension in the off season. Gordon earned $6 million in 2012, $9 million 
in 2013, $10 million in 2014 and $12.5 million in 2015, but declined to 
exercise his player option of $12.5 million for 2016. Gordon would otherwise 
have become a free agent after 2013.[23] In 2012, Gordon won a Fielding 
Bible Award as the best fielding left fielder in MLB. He also won the Rawlings 
Gold Glove.[24] Gordon finished the 2012 season with a .294 batting average 
and led the majors with doubles, totaling 51 doubles. 2013 was another 
exceptional year for Gordon. He finished with the season with 90 runs scored, 
168 hits, 27 doubles, 6 triples, 20 home runs, 81 RBIs, and a .265 batting 
average. He earned his third consecutive Gold Glove Award for his spectacular 
defense in left field and earned his first career All Star selection. In 
the 2014 season, Gordon scored 87 runs, had 150 hits, 34 doubles, 1 triple, 
19 home runs, 74 RBI, 12 SB and a .266 BA. On July 6, 2014 he was named 
to the 2014 All Star Team for the second consecutive year. On August 6, 
he recorded his 1000th career hit when he singled off Arizona Diamondbacks 
pitcher Wade Miley. On August 26, he passed Wade Boggs for the most home 
runs hit by a Nebraskan in the Major Leagues. 13 of his 19 home runs either 
tied the game (3) or given the Royals the lead (10). Gordon mostly struggled 
during the Royals' run to the World Series. On October 10, in Game 1 of 
the ALCS, against the Baltimore Orioles, he had three hits, including a 
go-ahead solo homer in the 10th inning. However, in Game 2, he went 0-4 
with four strikeouts. He represented the tying run in the 9th inning of 
Game 7 of the 2014 World Series, when with 2 outs, he lined a long single 
to left center and reached 3rd base when Giants' center fielder Gregor 
Blanco misplayed the ball. However he was stranded when catcher Salvador 
Perez fouled out to Pablo Sandoval to end the game.[25] In the 2014 Playoffs, 
Gordon batted just .204, including 6 doubles, and one homer. Following 
offseason wrist surgery, Gordon struggled out of the gate in 2015. In his 
first 20 at-bats, he had just 3 hits. On April 26, in a game against the 
White Sox, Gordon leaped into the Chicago crowd to catch a foul ball for 
an out. A spectacular defensive play, and was retired after being the reigning 
Web Gem on Baseball Tonight for 50 straight days.[26] He finished the regular 
season hitting .271 with 18 doubles, 13 home runs, and 48 RBIs. On July 
8, against the Tampa Bay Rays, Gordon was injured attempting to chase down 
a fly ball by Logan Forsythe, which resulted in an inside-the-park homerun 
as Gordon could not get back up. After being carted off the field, he was 
diagnosed with a left groin strain and placed on the 15-Day DL, and was 
projected to be out six to eight weeks. Gordon had just come off a 7-hit 
double header the night before against the Rays (tying the Royals record 
for most hits in a double header), hitting a double and a homerun. On September 
2, Gordon was activated from the DL and went 2-for-3, with an RBI and run 
scored against the Detroit Tigers .[27] In game 1 of the 2015 World Series, 
Gordon hit a ninth-inning home run off of New York Mets closer Jeurys Familia 
to tie the game at 4. The Royals would go on to win, 5-4, in 14 innings.[28] 
Combined in the postseason, Gordon hit .241 with 2 homers, 6 RBI and a 
.771 OPS. Gordon became a World Champion when the Royals won the World 
Series in 5 games over the Mets. Gordon, along with all of the Royals, 
attended the World Series parade and pep rally in downtown Kansas City, 
Missouri at Union Station on November 3.[29] On January 6, 2016, Gordon 
signed a 4-year deal worth $72 million to remain with the Royals with a 
mutual option for the 2020 season.[30] Gordon gained distinction through 
his baseball card shortly after being drafted in 2006. Topps issued Gordon's 
rookie card prematurely, as only players on 25-man rosters or who have 
played in at least one Major League game are eligible. As a result, Topps 
stopped producing the card and cut holes in some of the existing cards.
