Slap bunting is an offensive baseball and softball technique described 
as "the idea behind the skill is to hit the ball to a place on the infield 
that's farthest from the place where the out needs to be made".[1] To execute 
slap bunting, the player is almost always in the back of the left-hand 
side of home plate, feet slightly open to right field, and choked up slightly 
on the bat. The moment the pitch is released from the pitchers hand, the 
player must rotate his hips toward the pitcher and then cross his back 
(left) foot over his front foot, moving up to the very front edge of the 
batters box.[2] His shoulders should face the pitcher at this point. If 
the pitch is in the strike zone, the player should then extend his arms 
so that the bat is at the correct angle for where he wants to place the 
ball — the barrel trailing the hands if he wants the ball to go to the 
left side of the field, and the opposite if he wants it to go to the right. 
The technique is quite common in softball because of the difficulty of 
getting a hit with a pitcher only 40 feet (12 m) away. By already being 
in the front of the batters box with the batter's body turned halfway toward 
first base, the batter already has some momentum toward first base and 
might be in better position to get a base hit.[1] The technique is often 
successful in sacrifice circumstances, where the placement of the ball 
could help advance a runner already on base. It is also often used when 
batters are having difficulty getting a hit off of a difficult pitcher, 
or when they have a better opportunity of getting on base because of the 
slap bunt than a hit, perhaps because of the player's running speed. Some 
advanced players might perform a slap hit, which is the same technique 
except that the player swings to place the ball in an infield hole or over
