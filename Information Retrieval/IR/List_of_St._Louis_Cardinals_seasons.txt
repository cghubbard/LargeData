History People Overview Grounds Teams The St. Louis Cardinals, a professional 
baseball franchise based in St. Louis, Missouri, compete in the National 
League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). Founded in 1882 as a charter 
member of the American Association (AA), the team was originally named 
the Brown Stockings before it was shortened to Browns the next season. 
The team moved to the National League in 1892 when the AA folded. The club 
changed its name to the Perfectos for one season in 1899 and adopted the 
Cardinals name in 1900. The St. Louis Cardinals are tied with the Cincinnati 
Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates as the third-oldest continuously-operated baseball 
team.[a] In that time, the team has won 19 National League pennants and 
11 World Series championships (most in the National League and second only 
to the New York Yankees, who have won 27). They also won four American 
Association pennants and one pre-World Series championship that Major League 
Baseball does not consider official. The Cardinals had six periods of continued 
success during their history. The first period occurred during the 1880s 
when the team won four consecutive American Association pennants from 1885–1888 
while known as the Browns. The Cardinals next found success from 1926–1934 
when they played in five World Series, winning three. During World War 
II the Cardinals won four NL pennants in five years from 1942–1946, including 
three World Series championships. During the 1960s the Cardinals won two 
World Series and played in another. In the 1980s the Cardinals played in 
three World Series, winning in 1982. Most recently, the Cardinals have 
made the playoffs nine times, winning seven NL Central titles and qualifying 
as a wild-card entrant in 2001, 2011 and 2012, winning the World Series 
in 2006 and 2011. The only extended period of failure the Cardinals have 
experienced began when they joined the National League in 1892. The Cardinals 
played only five winning seasons in 30 years while finishing last seven 
times from their entrance to the NL until 1921. However, the Cardinals 
have remarkably avoided such failure since then as they have not finished 
in last place in the National League since 1918, by far the longest streak 
in the NL.[b] The Cardinals failed to reach the World Series in the 1950s, 
1970s, and 1990s, but were regularly a competitive team in each of these 
decades. The following table describes the Cardinals' MLB win–loss record 
by decade. These statistics are from Baseball-Reference.com's St. Louis 
Cardinals History & Encyclopedia,[7] and are current as of October 18,
