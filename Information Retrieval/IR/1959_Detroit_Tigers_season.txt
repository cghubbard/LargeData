The 1959 Detroit Tigers season was the 59th season for the American League 
franchise in Detroit. Although the Tigers lost 15 of their first 17 games 
in 1959—resulting in the May 2 firing of manager Bill Norman—they recovered 
under his successor, Jimmy Dykes, to finish in fourth place with a record 
of 76–78, eighteen games behind the AL Champion Chicago White Sox. [1]
