Kyle Daniel Crick (born November 30, 1992) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Richmond Flying Squirrels, the AA affiliate of 
the San Francisco Giants organization of Major League Baseball. Crick was 
drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the first round of the 2011 Major 
League Baseball Draft out of Sherman High School in Sherman, Texas.[1] 
Prior to the 2013 season, Baseball America ranked Crick as the Giants best 
prospect.[2] He was also ranked as the 86th best prospect in baseball by 
MLB.com.[3] After a breakout 2013 campaign, that saw Crick pitch to a 1.57 
ERA for the San Jose Giants, MLB.com ranked him as the 32nd best prospect 
in all of baseball, jumping 54 spots from his previous ranking of 89th 
overall in 2013. He was also ranked by Baseball America as the 33rd best 
prospect.[4] After the 2015 season, the Giants added Crick to their 40-man 
roster to protect him from being eligible for selection in the Rule 5 draft.
