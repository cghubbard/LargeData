Rinold George "Ryne" Duren (February 22, 1929 – January 6, 2011) was an 
American relief pitcher in Major League Baseball.[1] He was known for the 
combination of his blazing fastball and his very poor vision. With his 
thick Coke bottle glasses, few batters dared to dig in against Duren. Casey 
Stengel said, "I would not admire hitting against Ryne Duren, because if 
he ever hit you in the head you might be in the past tense." He was originally 
signed by the St. Louis Browns (now the Baltimore Orioles) as a free agent 
before the 1949 season. His first major league game was on September 25, 
1954 (by which time the Browns had moved to Baltimore), but that was the 
only game he ever played for the Orioles. On September 21, 1956 he was 
traded to the Kansas City Athletics with Jim Pisoni in exchange for Al 
Pilarcik and Art Ceccarelli. The Athletics and Yankees were frequent trading 
partners in that era, and on June 15, 1957 Duren, Pisoni, and Harry Simpson 
were sent to the Yankees for Billy Martin, Ralph Terry, Woodie Held, and 
Bob Martyn. Duren kept his A's uniform number of 26 with the Yankees. Duren 
received the first of his three All-Star selections in 1957. He has been 
retroactively credited with saving 20 games in 1958, the high mark in the 
American League that year. In 1959, his win–loss record was much poorer, 
but his earned run average of 1.88 was the best of his career. "Big guy. 
Throws like hell. Hitter can't see it. But he can't see you either. He's 
practically blind. Can't hit, field or run. Curve not much. Neither is 
sinker. Just throws fast one. Unpredictable where it'll go. — minor league 
scouting report[2] Duren was a showman. In those days the Yankee bullpen 
was a part of the short-porch right field and only a low chain link fence 
served as the boundary. When called upon by Casey Stengel to relieve, he 
wouldn't use the gate, but preferred to hop the fence with one hand and 
begin a slow walk to the mound with his blue Yankee warm-up jacket covering 
his pitching arm; he followed this routine even on the hottest days. When 
he finally took the ball and began his warmups, the first pitch was sometimes 
a hard fastball 20 feet over the catcher's head. The succeeding warmup 
pitches would be thrown lower and lower (but not slower) until Duren would 
finally "find" the plate. Duren stayed with the Yankees until May 8, 1961, 
when he was traded to the Los Angeles Angels; Duren, Johnny James, and 
Lee Thomas went to the Angels in exchange for Tex Clevenger and Bob Cerv.[3] 
Shortly after being traded to the Angels, he struck out seven successive 
Red Sox batters, then an American League record. He was sold to the Philadelphia 
Phillies before the 1963 season. Early in the 1964 season, he was shipped 
to the Cincinnati Reds. Released by Cincinnati in April 1965, he was signed 
by the Phillies; after being released two months later, he joined the Washington 
Senators, but was released again on August 24 to bring a close to his 10-year 
Major League career. In 1983, Duren was presented with the Yankee Family 
Award for his conquering alcoholism, and for service as an alcohol abuse 
educator.[4] In 2003, Duren and author Tom Sabellico wrote the book, I 
Can See Clearly Now. Duren talks from the heart about life, baseball and 
alcohol. The foreword was written by Jim "Mudcat" Grant.[5] Duren's nephew 
is singer Blackie Lawless of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P. Baseball Hall 
of Famer Ryne Sandberg was named in honor of Duren.[6] Duren was the inspiration 
for the character Ricky "Wild Thing" Vaughn in the movie Major League,
