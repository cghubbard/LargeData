The Indianapolis Indians are a minor league baseball team in Indianapolis, 
Indiana, which plays in the International League. The Triple-A affiliate 
of the Major League Baseball Pittsburgh Pirates, the Indians play at Victory 
Field in downtown Indianapolis. The team's mascot is Rowdie the Bear. Founded 
in 1902, the Indianapolis Indians are the second-oldest minor league franchise 
in American professional baseball. Professional baseball was first played 
in Indianapolis in 1887.[1] After 15 years of various franchises competing 
in various leagues (including four years in the National League and one 
year in the American Association), the current Indianapolis Indians franchise 
was founded as an original member of the American Association in 1902. 
That year's team won 95 games and the first of 21 pennants. The ballclub 
played its early seasons at several ballparks, including two on Washington 
Street, before Norm Perry, who took ownership of the team in 1929, built 
a new stadium on 16th Street in 1931, the Indians playing their first game 
there on September 5, 1931. He named the park Perry Stadium in honor of 
his brother James who had been killed in a plane crash. That ballpark, 
which was renamed Victory Field in 1942 and Bush Stadium in 1967, remained 
the Tribe's home until July 1996.[2] Norm Perry sold the team to Frank 
E. McKinney and Donie Bush in December 1941. Those two men ran the club 
for 10 seasons. The Cleveland Indians purchased the team in 1952, but after 
losing $500,000 on the operation over four seasons, looked to move the 
team. The Indianapolis community rallied to save the Indians. Funeral director 
Robert E. Kirby, Chairman of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce Athletic 
Committee, obtained an option to purchase the franchise from Cleveland. 
A broad-based sale of stock in the team was organized. Stock was priced 
at $10 per share with a 100-share limit on individual purchases. Kirby, 
William R. Kraft, David M. Lewis, Thomas A. Moynahan, and Thomas J. O'Brien 
got the ball rolling with investments of $200 each, and the certificate 
of incorporation for Indians, Inc. was received from the state of Indiana 
on November 9, 1955. Media promotion of the stock sale was intense. The 
Indianapolis Star, The Indianapolis News, and the Indianapolis Times ran 
complete lists of stock purchasers and their addresses. So successful was 
the drive that the original 16,000-share purchase authorization of capital 
stock was increased to 25,000 shares by the Secretary of State on December 
5 following stockholder approval on November 30. Eventually the new corporation 
stopped accepting investments in February after a total of 20,488 shares 
had been purchased by 6,672 investors. Former Indians player, manager, 
and owner Donie Bush was named the first President of Indians, Inc. He 
held that position until January 1969. In 1956, the Indianapolis Indians 
were 92–62. On May 18, they defeated the Louisville Colonels 24–0. The 
Indians went on to win the 1956 Junior World Series by defeating the Rochester 
Red Wings. In Game 2 of the Junior World Series, Roger Maris set a record 
by getting seven RBIs.[3] Max Schumacher joined the Indians front office 
as ticket manager in 1957. He added the duties of publicity director in 
1959, and became the club's general manager in 1961—a post he held through 
1997. Max was also named the team's President in 1969 following Bush's 
retirement. To this day, he continues as President and Chairman of the 
Board of Indians, Inc. Under his direction, the corporation has turned 
a profit for 35 straight years. The team captured three straight pennants 
from 1961–63, including the International League championship in 1963. 
(The Indians competed in the American Association until it briefly disbanded 
after 1962. The Tribe joined the IL for one season before belonging to 
the Pacific Coast League from 1964 through 1968. At that point the Indians 
rejoined the American Association.) In 1969, Vern Rapp joined as manager 
of the Indians for 7 years. During that time, the Indians won two American 
Association pennants. The Indians had been affiliated with several Major 
League clubs over the years including Cincinnati (1939–41, 1961), Boston 
Braves (1946–47), Pittsburgh (1948–1951), Cleveland (1952–1956), Philadelphia 
(1960) and the Chicago White Sox (1962–67). Beginning in 1968 they had 
a working agreement with the Cincinnati Reds that lasted through 1983. 
In addition to four first-place finishes and one playoff championship in 
that time period, Indianapolis fans saw numerous members of "The Big Red 
Machine" come through town. Players like Pedro Borbón, Bernie Carbo, Dave 
Concepción, Dan Driessen, George Foster, Ken Griffey, Ray Knight, and Hal 
McRae all donned Tribe uniforms. The most glorious run in team history 
came in the 1980s after the team affiliated with the Montreal Expos. In 
a six-year period (1984–1989), the Indians won four division titles, four 
straight league championships (1986–1989) and two consecutive Triple-A 
Classic playoffs (1988–1989) over the champions of the International League. 
Players such as Delino DeShields, Andrés Galarraga, Marquis Grissom, Randy 
Johnson, and Larry Walker wore Indianapolis uniforms during those memorable 
years. The Indians affiliated again with Cincinnati from 1993–1999. That 
relationship led to two more pennants and a league championship (1994). 
In 1998, Triple-A baseball expanded to 30 teams and consolidated into two 
leagues, with the Indians returning to the International League. After 
becoming the top affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers in 2000, the Tribe 
won the league championship and went on to capture the Triple-A World Series 
in Las Vegas. But sub-.500 finishes during the next four seasons prompted 
the Indians to break from the Brewers and join the Pittsburgh Pirates farm 
system for the first time since 1951. Perhaps the most significant change 
in Indians history came in 1996 when the team moved downtown to a new ballpark. 
Taking a name from the past, Victory Field, an $18 million project on the 
west side of downtown and part of White River State Park, opened on July 
11, 1996 as the Tribe hosted the Oklahoma City 89ers. The open-air facility 
features 13,500 permanent seats and a lawn berm around the outfield that 
can seat up to 2,000 additional fans. The park also features 29 luxury 
suites. The ballpark was designed by the same architectural firm that designed 
Baltimore's Camden Yards and Cleveland's Jacobs Field. The opening of Victory 
Field took the Indianapolis Indians to a new level. Attendance nearly doubled 
with more than 600,000 fans coming to the ballpark in each of the first 
five full seasons. In January 1999, Baseball America dubbed Victory Field 
"the best minor league ballpark in America." Those accolades were reinforced 
in 2001 by Sports Illustrated and minorleaguenews.com.[4][5] The national 
commendations and record attendance marks earned the Indians a share of 
the national spotlight. On July 11, 2001 representatives from all 30 Triple-A 
teams came to Indianapolis, and a national TV audience watched on ESPN2 
as the Triple-A All-Star Game took place in front of a sellout crowd of 
15,868. Twelve Indians players and or managers have enjoyed enough success 
at the Major League level to warrant induction into baseball's Hall of 
Fame. Those players are: Samuel "Big Sam" Thompson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, 
Luke Appling, Gabby Hartnett, Randy Johnson, Harmon Killebrew, Nap Lajoie, 
Al López, Rube Marquard, Joe McCarthy, Bill McKechnie, and Ray Schalk. 
Bob Uecker was recognized as a Ford C. Frick Award-winning broadcaster.
