Lawrence William Gilbert (December 3, 1891 – February 17, 1965) was an 
American outfielder in Major League Baseball and a longtime manager in 
minor league baseball. A native of New Orleans, Louisiana, who broke into 
baseball as a left-handed pitcher, Gilbert first became famous as a member 
of the 1914 "Miracle" Boston Braves. But his Major League career lasted 
only two seasons (the Braves' breakthrough 1914 campaign and 1915). A left-handed 
batter, he batted .230 with five homers, 29 runs batted in, ten doubles 
and seven stolen bases. In 1914, Gilbert was a member of the Braves team 
that went from last place to first in two months, becoming the first team 
to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.[1] The 
team then went on to defeat Connie Mack's heavily favored Philadelphia 
Athletics in the 1914 World Series. In the series, he drew an intentional 
walk in his only appearance. Gilbert became more famous as a minor league 
manager in the Southern Association, where he led teams for 25 seasons, 
including the New Orleans Pelicans from 1923–31 and 1933–38 and the Nashville 
Vols from 1939–48. He took 1932 off from his dugout duties to serve as 
president of the Pelicans, then was a part-owner of the Vols from 1939 
through 1955. His managing career was bracketed by pennants. His New Orleans 
club posted 89 wins and a .610 winning percentage in 1923, and his final 
club, in Nashville, won 95 games but lost the 1948 playoff championship. 
Gilbert won eight Southern Association championships during his quarter-century 
in the league, including six consecutive titles (1939–44) with the Vols. 
His clubs twice won 101 games (1926 with New Orleans and 1940 with Nashville). 
Gilbert's career record as a minor league skipper was 2,128 wins and 1,627 
defeats (.567). He died in New Orleans of undisclosed causes at age 73. 
He was the father of Charlie Gilbert, a National League outfielder from 
1940–43 and in 1946-47, and Tookie Gilbert, a minor league slugger with 
the Vols who had two trials with the New York Giants in the early 1950s.
