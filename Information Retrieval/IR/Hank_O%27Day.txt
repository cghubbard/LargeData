As player As manager Henry M. "Hank" O'Day (July 8, 1859[2] – July 2, 1935), 
nicknamed "The Reverend", was an American right-handed pitcher and later 
an umpire and manager in Major League Baseball. After a seven-year major 
league playing career, he worked as a National League (NL) umpire for 30 
seasons between 1895 and 1927. O'Day umpired in ten World Series – second 
only to Bill Klem's total of 18 – including five of the first seven played, 
and was behind the plate for the first modern World Series game in 1903. 
Retiring at age 68 years, 2 months, he remains the oldest umpire in major 
league history – a fact which was not known until recently, as he routinely 
shaved five to seven years from his true age throughout his career. His 
3,986 total games as an umpire ranked third in major league history when 
he retired, and his 2,710 games as the plate umpire still rank second in 
major league history to Klem's total of 3,544. He is largely known for 
his controversial decision in a pivotal 1908 game, a ruling that still 
causes debate today. O'Day interrupted his umpiring career twice for single 
seasons as a manager, leading the Cincinnati Reds in 1912 and the Chicago 
Cubs in 1914. He remains the only person ever to serve full seasons in 
the NL as a player, manager and umpire. O'Day was inducted into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in July 2013. O'Day was born in Chicago, the son 
of railroad engineer James O'Day[3] (c. 1824 – 1885[4]) and his wife Margaret[5] 
(c. 1822 – 1895[6]), who were immigrants from Ireland[3] and were both 
deaf.[7] The couple had at least seven children:[5] Daniel (c. 1846 – 1898[8][9]), 
James Jr. (c. 1854 – before 1895[10][11]), Catherine (c. 1856 – 1901[10][12]), 
Henry, Margaret (c. 1864 – before 1895[3][11]), Mary McNamara (c. 1866 
– 1924[3][13]), and Joseph (1870–1885[14]). The O'Days originally settled 
in Buffalo, New York;[15] by the mid-1850s, they had moved to Cincinnati,[16] 
and they relocated to Chicago around 1858. Henry was born in the vicinity 
of Ewing Street (later renamed Cabrini Street[17]) and Jefferson Street,[18] 
which was just one block north of the starting point of the Chicago Fire 
in 1871; however, by 1870, the family had moved about two miles west to 
1022 W. Jackson Street[19] (renumbered in 1909 as 2433 W. Jackson Boulevard[20]), 
which remained the family residence until the early 20th century. O'Day 
worked as a steam fitter[21] in Chicago before entering organized baseball. 
O'Day played minor league baseball with the Bay City club and the Toledo 
Blue Stockings of the Northwestern League in 1883, and he reached the major 
leagues when Toledo joined the American Association (AA) the following 
year.[22] With Toledo, he played alongside Fleet Walker, the first African 
American to play in the major leagues. O'Day made his major league debut 
on May 2, 1884, and served as the team's second pitcher behind Tony Mullane. 
In 41 games pitched for the Blue Stockings, he had 9 wins, 28 losses, a 
3.75 earned run average (ERA), and 163 strikeouts; he is also one of three 
pitchers who have been retroactively credited with a save in the AA that 
season. In addition to pitching, O'Day appeared in 23 games as a position 
player that season, primarily in left field; he also made appearances at 
the other outfield positions, as well as at first base and third base.[23] 
However, he made only 13 other non-pitching appearances in the field in 
later years, including eight games at shortstop in 1887-88. In 1885, he 
split playing time with the Pittsburgh Alleghenys of the AA and the Washington 
Nationals of the Eastern League. O'Day had a record of 5–7 for the Alleghenys; 
his playing time was limited because he was caring for his sick father.[23][24] 
He made only five starts after May 11, and left the team for the last time 
after his July 6 start;[25] his father died on July 9 at age 61.[4] In 
the meantime, the Chicago White Stockings had opened West Side Park on 
June 6, less than a mile and a half from the O'Day residence. In 15 games 
with Washington in the Eastern League, he had a record of 13–2 and a 0.74 
ERA.[26] On September 5 of that year, his younger brother Joseph died at 
age 15 from injuries he had suffered two days earlier after falling from 
the front car of a roller coaster.[14][27] At the end of the season, the 
Nationals folded, and O'Day joined a Louisville ball club; no record exists 
of him having played any games for them.[28] O'Day spent most of 1886 with 
the Savannah team in the Southern Association, and during his time there 
he was considered a favorite among other players.[29] In 39 games with 
Savannah, O'Day won 26 games, lost 11, and had an ERA of 1.03.[26] Late 
in the year, he joined the Washington Nationals, where he posted a 2-2 
record in six games.[23] O'Day became a full-time starter for the Nationals 
in 1887, and pitched the second-most games behind Jim Whitney. In 30 games, 
he won 8 games, lost 20, and had a 4.17 ERA and 109 walks; his walks were 
fifth-highest in the league.[23] In 1888, O'Day became the workhorse of 
the team, starting 46 games for the Nationals that year. His ERA and win 
totals improved to 3.10 and 16, but he led the NL in losses with 29 and 
was second in walks with 117 in 403 innings pitched. He also played eight 
games at shortstop in 1887 and 1888.[23] O'Day's high loss total was noted 
by Sporting Life as due to ineffective hitting by the Nationals rather 
than as a result of his pitching.[30] In 13 games for Washington in 1889, 
O'Day had a 2-10 record and a 4.33 ERA.[23] On July 26, he was purchased 
by the New York Giants; his first game with the Giants was against his 
former team, a game which he lost.[31] O'Day then went on to win his next 
nine starts to finish the year with a 9-1 record for the Giants.[23] He 
earned two strong wins in the 1889 World Series, including a 2-1 11-inning 
victory on October 25, to give the Giants the National League title; the 
Giants' midseason purchase of O'Day was considered to be the reason they 
won.[32] In 1890, O'Day jumped ship to the New York Giants of the newly 
established Players' League. With them, he enjoyed his best season by going 
22–13 with a 4.21 ERA for the Giants, pitching 329 innings in 43 games, 
and he has since been credited with tying for the league lead with 3 saves.[23] 
However, he developed arm trouble as a result of so many innings pitched, 
and he spent three more years in the minor leagues with the Lincoln Rustlers 
of the Western Association (1891), the Columbus Reds of the Western League 
(1892) and the Erie Blackbirds of the Eastern League (1893) before retiring 
as a player.[26] In 201 career games and 1,651 1/3 innings pitched, O'Day 
posted a record of 73–110 with an ERA of 3.74 and 663 strikeouts. At various 
points throughout his career, O'Day played all nine positions.[33] After 
O'Day finished his playing career, he worked as a clerk for the Chicago 
city recorder's office. While attending a Chicago baseball game as a spectator 
one Sunday in 1894, O'Day was recruited from the stands to substitute for 
umpire Thomas Lynch, who was unable to make it to the game due to a train 
service cancellation. O'Day performed so well that he was recruited into 
full-time service as a National League umpire the following year.[34] On 
July 8, 1901, O'Day made a ruling in a game at St. Louis which proved pivotal 
in a 7–5 Brooklyn victory; the fans were so infuriated that they rushed 
the field after the game, and O'Day suffered a split lip before being rescued 
by players and police.[35] In July 1906, O'Day was fined $50 (USD) by NL 
president Harry Pulliam in connection with a fight that broke out between 
Giants pitcher Joe McGinnity and Pirates catcher Heinie Peitz during a 
game. O'Day was cited as being negligent for failing to prevent the fight; 
he appealed the fine, but Pulliam would not relent. When Pulliam did not 
withdraw the fine, O'Day submitted his resignation on July 31. Pulliam 
refused to accept the resignation, but O'Day pledged not to work until 
the fine was withdrawn. O'Day did not report for his scheduled game at 
the Polo Grounds that day.[36] He was rumored to be seeking an umpiring 
position in the Tri-State League, but he returned to the field for National 
League games by August 10.[36][37] On September 23, 1908, O'Day was involved 
in one of the most controversial field decisions in major league history. 
He was working as the plate umpire in the game between the Cubs and the 
Giants, which ended when Al Bridwell's apparent single drove in the apparent 
winning run. However, baserunner Fred Merkle never advanced from first 
base to second, in keeping with the common practice of the era. When the 
Cubs produced a ball – not necessarily the game ball, which had been thrown 
into the stands – and claimed a force play at second base, which would 
negate the run, the debate erupted. Bob Emslie, who as base umpire had 
been watching the play at first base to verify that the batter had reached 
base, had not seen the play at second. O'Day ruled that the force play 
had been valid and that the run did not count, causing the game to end 
in a tie. It is noteworthy that at that time, Emslie and O'Day ranked as 
the two longest-serving umpires in major league history. O'Day's letter 
to Pulliam follows (spelling and punctuation as in the original): New York, 
Sept 23/08 Harry C. Pulliam, Esq. Pres. Nat. League Dear sir, In the game 
to-day at New York between New York and the Chicago Club. In the last half 
of the 9th inning, the score was a tie 1–1. New York was at the Bat, with 
two Men out, McCormick of N. York on 3rd Base and Merkle of N. York on 
1st Base; Bridwell was at the Bat and hit a clean single Base-Hit to Center 
Field. Merkle did not run the Ball out; he started toward 2nd Base, but 
on getting half way there he turned and ran down the field toward the Club 
House. The Ball was fielded in to 2nd Base for a Chgo. Man to make the 
play, when McGinnity ran from the Coacher's Box out in the Field to 2nd 
Base and interfered with the Play being made. Emslie, who said he did not 
watch Merkle, asked me if Merkle touched 2nd Base. I said he did not. Then 
Emslie called Merkle out, and I would not allow McCormick's Run to score. 
The Game at the end of the 9th inning was 1–1. The People ran out on the 
Field. I did not ask to have the Field cleared, as it was too dark to continue 
play. Yours respt. (signed) [38] President Pulliam upheld O'Day's decision, 
the game was ruled a tie, and a makeup game was scheduled. The Cubs defeated 
New York in that makeup game to win the pennant by a single game. The Milwaukee 
Journal later reported that O'Day and the Chicago team had been attuned 
to the play because of their involvement in a similar situation a few weeks 
earlier on September 4. During a mid-season game between Chicago and Pittsburgh, 
Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers tried to call O'Day's attention to the 
fact that a Pittsburgh player had not made it to second base on the game-winning 
play. Not seeing the runner miss the base, O'Day told Evers, "Go home and 
take a bath, Johnny. The game's over." The newspaper noted that "Chicago 
got the pennant by being given the derisive hoot a few weeks before."[39] 
O'Day's name was mentioned in connection with a major league managing vacancy 
as early as 1905. At that time, he said that he liked umpiring and that 
he was unsure whether he would accept a managing position even if an offer 
came to him. "I am not the least bit sure that I could better myself by 
giving up umpiring for a managerial job", O'Day said.[40] Several years 
later, O'Day interrupted his umpiring career to manage major league clubs 
during two separate seasons. In 1912, he agreed to become the manager of 
the Cincinnati Reds. This move surprised the baseball world, as O'Day had 
not been mentioned as a possibility to take the job.[41] The team started 
off the year winning 20 of its first 25 games,[42] creating the possibility 
that the Reds would win the World Series under their new manager.[43] The 
Reds did not hold on to their early hot streak, however, and finished the 
season with a 75–78 record under O'Day. He resigned after the 1912 season, 
as the team was negotiating a trade for Joe Tinker and rumors surfaced 
that Tinker might become manager.[44] In late 1912, O'Day was reported 
as saying that he would not return to umpiring, but he changed his mind 
by April and signed with the National League again.[45][46] After umpiring 
in 1913, he managed for another year, taking over the Chicago Cubs ballclub 
after player-manager Johnny Evers was traded despite a third-place finish 
by the Cubs the previous year.[47] He led the Cubs to a 78–76 record and 
a fourth-place finish; O'Day earned fourth-place finishes in both of his 
seasons as a manager. In December, the Cubs signed Roger Bresnahan to be 
their manager, effectively firing O'Day, who returned to being an umpire.[48] 
O'Day umpired in 10 World Series: 1903, 1905, 1907, 1908, 1910, 1916, 1918, 
1920, 1923 and 1926. Only Bill Klem, whose hiring was recommended by O'Day, 
worked more. O'Day's World Series appearances include four of the first 
five played. In his first three World Series, a two-umpire system was used, 
with the two alternating between working home plate and the bases. In his 
next three Series, four umpires were assigned, but they worked in two-man 
crews that officiated alternating games; not until the 1918 Series did 
all four work every game. During the 1920 World Series, O'Day was the base 
umpire when Bill Wambsganss executed the only unassisted triple play in 
Series history. Although it was not known at the time, O'Day became the 
oldest umpire in history at age 65 years, 9 months when he began the 1925 
season; it was long believed that Emslie still held the mark, having retired 
at the end of the 1924 season at age 65 years, 8 months. At the end of 
his career, O'Day's total of 3,986 games as an umpire placed him behind 
only Tommy Connolly (4,337) and Emslie (4,228) in major league history. 
O'Day called balls and strikes for no-hitters in four decades, a distinction 
that has been matched only by Harry Wendelstedt; he was behind the plate 
when Ted Breitenstein (April 22, 1898), Johnny Lush (May 1, 1906), Hod 
Eller (May 11, 1919) and Jesse Haines (July 17, 1924) each accomplished 
the feat. O'Day served for many years on the major league rules committee, 
and became known for its many heated debates over rule changes and applications. 
In 1920, the committee was considering the issue of game-winning hits in 
the bottom of the last inning; O'Day argued that batters should only be 
credited with as many bases as were necessary to score the winning run, 
even if the ball was hit over the fence for an apparent home run, saying, 
"you can't score runs after a game is over", while sportswriter Fred Lieb 
counter-argued that a fair ball hit over the fence must be counted as a 
home run regardless of the situation. Lieb's position was adopted by the 
committee, with O'Day complaining that Lieb was simply trying to accumulate 
more home runs for his friend Babe Ruth; O'Day did, however, succeed in 
preventing the rule from being applied retroactively.[49] O'Day began his 
career in an era during which only one umpire worked in most games, and 
he spent the remainder in a time when only two were used. In 1908, O'Day 
was quoted as saying that he preferred the single-man system and that he 
had run into more trouble in games with two umpires.[50] In The National 
League Story (1961), Lee Allen described O'Day as "a crusty old pitcher 
who had umpired in the league as early as 1888 and had the scars to prove 
it." O'Day maintained an intensely private life. He did, however, develop 
a lasting friendship with fellow umpire Emslie, one of his pitching opponents 
in the 1880s, after both had been in the league for a number of years. 
He also enjoyed long friendships with John Heydler, who had been a fellow 
umpire in the 1890s and later became O'Day's supervisor as NL president, 
and with Connie Mack, who was O'Day's catcher for three years in Washington. 
O'Day became an umpiring scout after he retired from active umpiring in 
1927. In March 1935, he was said to be seriously ill with a stomach condition 
and it had become "doubtful if he will ever get up again".[51] He died 
of bronchial pneumonia and cancer at the Presbyterian hospital in Chicago 
on July 2, 1935.[18] He had outlived all his siblings, only two of whom 
had lived to the age of 45, and was survived by his nephew Henry McNamara 
(1899–1971),[52] who had been born on O'Day's 40th birthday and was named 
for him; McNamara's family had lived with O'Day for some time after he 
was born.[53] His funeral high mass at St. Jariath's Church was attended 
by baseball notables including Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, former 
NL president John Heydler, and former umpires Bob Emslie, Tom Connolly, 
Bill Klem and Lord Byron.[54] O'Day was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, 
Illinois.[55] O'Day was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame on 
December 3, 2012 by the Hall's new Pre-Integration Era Committee, which 
considers candidates from the era prior to 1947 once every three years, 
and was inducted the following July.[33] His induction speech was given 
by his grandnephew Dennis McNamara, a former Chicago police officer with 
his own connection to baseball history, having introduced Hall of Famer
