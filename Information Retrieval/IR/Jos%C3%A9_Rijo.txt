José Antonio Rijo Abreu (born May 13, 1965) is a Dominican former right-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who spent the majority of his career with 
the Cincinnati Reds (1988–1995 and 2001–2002).[1] Plagued by injuries during 
his career, he left the major leagues at age 30 before returning six years 
later for one and a half seasons.[1] Rijo is perhaps best known for his 
performance in the 1990 World Series, when he recorded two victories in 
a four-game sweep over the defending champion Oakland A's, including a 
two-hitter in the final Game Four.[2] Rijo's performance earned him the 
World Series MVP Award[3] as the Reds won their first championship in fourteen 
years. When Rijo broke into the majors with the New York Yankees in 1984, 
he was 18 years old and the youngest player in either league.[1] The previous 
year, he'd had a 15–5 record in the Florida League with a 1.68 ERA.[4] 
But he did not have a good rookie season, and some observers (notably ESPN) 
commented that Yankee owner George Steinbrenner had orchestrated the call-up, 
hoping to create a phenom along the lines of the crosstown Mets' 1984 rookie 
sensation Dwight Gooden.[5] When this did not happen, Rijo was sent to 
the Oakland A's as part of a trade package for Rickey Henderson.[1] While 
with the Oakland Athletics, he struck out 16 Seattle Mariners on April 
16, 1986,[6] setting a club record.[7] In his next start, he struck out 
14 in a 2-hitter against the same Mariners organization, despite losing 
the game.[6] But his time in Oakland was otherwise largely nondescript, 
with just 17 wins in three seasons.[1] Even so, Rijo was still considered 
enough of a prospect for the Reds to acquire him in exchange for aging 
slugger Dave Parker,[1] who'd had 338 runs batted in over the previous 
three seasons.[8] Rijo's age eventually caught up to his talent. He was 
a member of the National League All-Star Team in 1994.[1] Rijo also led 
the league in 1993 and 1994 in games started.[1] He led the NL in 1993 
in strikeouts and strikeouts per nine innings, and in 1991 he led the NL 
in winning percentage.[1] Rijo was 3–0 in the 1990 postseason,[1] including 
two World Series wins against Oakland, the team that had traded him away 
three years before.[2] After winning Game One by a 7–0 score, he shut down 
the A's on two hits in Game Four (both in the first inning), ending the 
Series with a 0.59 earned run average and 15 strikeouts in 15 1⁄3 innings.[2] 
It was the only postseason experience of his entire career.[1] Rijo pitched 
a one-hitter against the Colorado Rockies in 1993.[9] The year after his 
All-Star season (1995), Rijo was sidelined with a serious elbow injury.[10] 
Despite several comeback attempts, his elbow troubles kept him out of baseball 
for five full years.[1] Rijo made an unexpected comeback to the game in 
2001, returning to Cincinnati as a reliever.[1] In doing so, Rijo became 
the first major league player to appear in a game after having received 
a Baseball Hall of Fame vote since Minnie Miñoso (who received six Hall 
of Fame votes in 1969) appeared for the Chicago White Sox in 1976 and 1980.[11] 
In 2008, Rijo was again on the Hall of Fame ballot; he received no votes.[12] 
In 2002, his final season, Rijo received the Tony Conigliaro Award.[13] 
He made a handful of starts that year, including a win in his first start 
since 1995, and the last game at Riverfront Stadium.[14] Rijo was on the 
2003 Reds roster, but he suffered an elbow injury causing him to miss the 
entire season, and retired soon thereafter. Rijo used to work as a special 
assistant to general manager Jim Bowden of the Washington Nationals baseball 
team.[15] Starting in February 2009, he took a leave of absence from his 
position after it was discovered that one of Rijo's scouting finds, Dominican 
shortstop Esmailyn Gonzalez was actually named Carlos David Alvarez Lugo 
and was four years older than the Nationals believed when they signed him.[15] 
On February 25, Rijo was dismissed from the Nationals' organization and 
his Dominican baseball academy closed down.[16] In December 2011, German 
Miranda, who heads the Dominican Republic's Anti-Money Laundering unit, 
said Rijo had been subpeonaed in relation to his business dealings with 
Matías "Daniel" Avelino Castro and any information he might have about 
the abduction and murder of journalist José Silvestre, a.k.a. "Gajo", of 
Caña TV. Rijo was questioned by police after twice avoiding them. According 
to Miranda, an arrest warrant for Rijo had already been issued.[17] Rijo 
was once married to Juan Marichal's daughter.[18] Rijo had a supporting 
role in the 2008 baseball film Sugar.[19] Rijo became eligible for the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001. 75% of the vote was necessary for 
induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received 0.2% 
of the vote, and dropped off of the BBWAA ballot.[20] He again became eligible 
for the Hall of Fame in 2008 since he played in 2001 after a six-year hiatus. 
He received zero votes and fell off the ballot.[21] In 2012, reporters 
in the Dominican Republic stated that Rijo was under investigation for 
suspicion of money laundering for drug traffickers. No concrete evidence
