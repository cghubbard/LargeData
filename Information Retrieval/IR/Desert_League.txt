The Desert League is an independent baseball league scheduled to start 
in 2016.[1] The league will play an eight-week season. Unlike other independent 
leagues, it will feature a fall schedule playing games from September through 
November. The Desert League aims to give a chance at exposure to undrafted 
and first-year players. The league features a 12-rookie roster requirement. 
The league has four teams based in California and Arizona. Somerton Caneros 
are an affiliate of the Mexican Pacific League club Ca√±eros de Los Mochis.[2]
