Jeffrey Allan Nelson (born November 17, 1966) is an American former baseball 
relief pitcher who played 15 years in Major League Baseball. Jeff Nelson 
is married to Sheri Quinn. He batted and threw right-handed. Nelson retired 
on January 12, 2007, the same day he signed a minor league contract with 
the New York Yankees.[1] Drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 22nd 
round of the 1984 amateur draft; he signed June 21, 1984. In his Major 
League career Nelson pitched in 798 games with a 48-45 record, and with 
runners in scoring position and two out he held batters to a .191 batting 
average. In 55 post-season games (second all-time behind former teammate 
Mariano Rivera), he compiled a 2-3 mark with 62 strikeouts and a 2.65 ERA 
in 54.1 innings. Among hitters whom he dominated most were Troy Glaus, 
who in 14 at-bats was hitless with 11 strikeouts.[2] Nelson had three stints 
with the Seattle Mariners (1992–1995, 2001–2003 and again in 2005). He 
is Seattle's all-time record holder for most games pitched (383), and has 
a 23-20 record with the Mariners. Before the 1996 season, Nelson was sent 
to the New York Yankees, and returned to Seattle as a free agent in 2001. 
In that season he made the American League All-Star team. Nelson's All-Star 
selection was considered an innovative move by AL manager Joe Torre, as 
Nelson's role of middle relief was traditionally overlooked during All-Star 
selection. From 2001-2003, he formed the right side of Seattle's potent 
lefty/righty setup squad along with left-handed pitcher Arthur Rhodes. 
In 2001 he held opposing batters to a .136 batting average and a .199 slugging 
percentage, and .074/.110 once he had two strikes on them.[3] Nelson was 
traded to the Yankees during the 2003 midseason. The Yankees lost to the 
Florida Marlins in the World Series and once again Nelson left the Yankees. 
In 2004, Nelson appeared in 29 games for the Texas Rangers, going 1-2 with 
a 5.32 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice with an assortment of injuries 
to his right knee and right elbow. Before the 2005 season, the Seattle 
Mariners signed Nelson to a minor league contract, his third stint with 
the club. In the 2006 offseason, Nelson signed a minor-league contract 
with the St. Louis Cardinals, but was released before the season began. 
He was then picked up by the White Sox. Nelson was a respected slider specialist, 
much more effective against right-handed batters than against lefties (who 
batted 55 points higher, and slugged 106 points higher, against him than 
did righties). He was also known for his three-quarters sidearm delivery, 
and threw a cut 90-MPH fastball as well. During his Yankees tenure, he 
was known for faking a throw to third and then faking a throw to first 
in the same motion, so as to avoid balking. This was and still is referred 
to as "the old Jeff Nelson" by Yankees play-by-play broadcaster Michael 
Kay.[4] On June 8, 2006, Nelson announced that he would undergo surgery, 
to relieve a nerve in his right elbow, that was likely to mark the end 
of Nelson's active baseball career. Following the operation on his pitching 
elbow, on May 10, 2007, there was controversy when he tried to sell bone 
chips from his elbow, removed in the operation, on eBay who cancelled the 
auction. Nelson, whose daughters attended Bear Creek School, were going 
to give half the proceeds to the School and half to the Curtis Williams 
Foundation.[5] Nelson currently frequently fills in on sports radio KJR-AM 
in Seattle. Nelson works as an analyst for MLB.com for the 2010 post-season.
