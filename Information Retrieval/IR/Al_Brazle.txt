Alpha Eugene Brazle (October 19, 1913 – October 24, 1973) was a Major League 
Baseball pitcher. The left-hander was signed by the Boston Red Sox as an 
amateur free agent in 1936, and later traded to the St. Louis Cardinals 
for pitcher Mike Ryba in September, 1940. He played his entire MLB career 
for the Cards (1943, 1946–1954). In 1954, at the age of 40, he was the 
oldest player to appear in a National League game that season. After the 
1954 season was over, Brazle was signed by the Chicago White Sox.[1] He 
was subsequently released[2] by Chicago without playing a regular season 
game for the team. Brazle played 7½ years in the minor leagues before he 
became a 29-year-old Cardinal rookie. He completed 47 of 117 starts, with 
7 shutouts, and twice led the National League in saves (1952 and 1953). 
Brazle finished in the league's top ten in a dozen pitching categories, 
including games pitched (7 times), saves (6 times), games finished (5 times), 
winning percentage (4 times), and earned run average (3 times). His career 
totals include a record of 97–64 (.602), 441 games, 60 saves, 178 games 
finished, 1376.2 innings pitched, 554 strikeouts, and a 3.31 ERA. He was 
a member of two pennant-winning clubs, losing in the 1943 World Series 
to the New York Yankees, and winning the 1946 World Series against the 
Boston Red Sox. Brazle died at the age of 60 in Grand Junction, Colorado.[3]
