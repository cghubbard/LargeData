Arthur John Ditmar (born April 3, 1929) is a former starting pitcher in 
Major League Baseball who played for the Athletics (Philadelphia, 1954 
- Kansas City, 1955–56, 1961–62) and the New York Yankees (1957–1961). 
He batted and threw right-handed and was listed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) 
tall and 185 pounds (84 kg). A finesse control pitcher, Ditmar divided 
his career between the Athletics and Yankees. He didn't consider himself 
a power pitcher, yet the variable-speed fastball was his most common offering. 
He also had a slider and a good curveball. Ditmar won 47 games for the 
Yankees in a span of five years, with a career-high 15 in 1960, despite 
not getting to pitch on a regular basis in a rotation that included Whitey 
Ford, Bobby Shantz, Don Larsen and Bob Turley. In a nine-season career, 
Ditmar compiled a 72-77 record with 552 strikeouts and a 3.98 ERA in 1268.0
