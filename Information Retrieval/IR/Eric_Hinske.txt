As player As coach Eric Scott Hinske (born August 5, 1977) is a former 
professional baseball outfielder and first baseman and current assistant 
hitting coach for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball. Hinske played 
in the major leagues with the Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Tampa 
Bay Rays, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves and Arizona 
Diamondbacks at third base, first base, left field, and right field. He 
won the 2002 AL Rookie of the Year Award with the Blue Jays. Hinske played 
for Menasha High School where he broke many hitting records, in addition 
to playing football as a running back.[1] After playing for the University 
of Arkansas, he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 17th round of the 
1998 amateur draft. In March 2001, Hinske was traded to the Oakland Athletics 
for Miguel Cairo. On December 7, 2001, Toronto Blue Jays general manager 
J.P. Ricciardi acquired Hinske and reliever Justin Miller from the Athletics 
for Billy Koch, a move designed to bring youth and vitality to the team. 
Hinske was inserted in the everyday line-up in 2002, playing third base, 
and was a key contributor for the team, hitting predominantly in the second 
spot in the line-up. While criticized early for his sometimes shoddy defense, 
Hinske made up for his lapses with his bat, hitting 24 home runs, knocking 
in 84 runs, and scoring 99 runs. He also led all AL third basemen in errors, 
with 22. He received wide recognition, winning both the MLB Rookie of the 
Year and The Sporting News Rookie of the Year awards. While playing with 
the Jays, Bushnell had an advertisement in The Globe and Mail stating Eric 
Hinske eats fish tonight as the Jays were playing the Florida Marlins. 
This advertisement gave Hinske the nickname "The Big Fish".[citation needed] 
Following Hinske's successful 2002 campaign, Ricciardi signed him to a 
five-year, $14,750,000 contract in March 2003. Hinske slumped through the 
early part of the 2003 season before he was finally diagnosed with a broken 
hamate bone in his right hand, after he had played the beginning of the 
season with the fracture. As a result, he was unable to match his numbers 
of the previous year, finishing with an average of .243, 12 home runs and 
63 RBIs, Hinske finished fifth in the American League with 45 doubles. 
Hinske was still unable to return to his rookie form in 2004, finishing 
the year with a batting average of .248, with 15 home runs and 69 RBIs. 
A positive note for Hinske was that he had committed a career-low 7 errors 
at third base, and he led all third baseman in fielding percentage, with 
a .978 mark. After the 2004 season, the Blue Jays acquired Corey Koskie 
and Shea Hillenbrand, both third basemen, and Hinske was moved to first 
base for the 2005 season. He started strongly in 2005 with two home runs 
and 13 RBIs in his first eight games. Hinske finished April with four home 
runs and 17 RBIs, with a .289 average and a .482 slugging percentage. He 
finished the 2005 season with a .262 average, 15 home runs and 68 RBI, 
and a .430 slugging percentage. With the acquisitions of Lyle Overbay and 
Troy Glaus by Toronto in the 2005 offseason, there was little room for 
Hinske as a corner infielder, and he was shifted once more to right field 
in a platoon with Alex Ríos for the 2006 season. Rios won the job after 
having a solid April. Though Hinske's primary position in 2006 was right 
field, he had also seen some spot duty at first and third base, due to 
either injuries suffered by his teammates during the game or for pinch-hitting 
purposes. On June 27, 2006, Rios was placed on the 15-day disabled list 
with a staph infection suffered after fouling a ball off his leg, thereby 
clearing the way for Hinske to see regular game action. In addition to 
Rios' injury, Hillenbrand's stormy departure from the team in July provided 
even more opportunity for increased playing time. Hinske is also quoted 
in a July 25, 2006, column on the Blue Jays' official website, criticizing 
the departed Hillenbrand, who was designated for assignment for, among 
other things, complaining about his lack of playing time: On August 17, 
2006, Hinske was traded to the Boston Red Sox for a minor league player 
to be named later and cash considerations.[2] His versatility helped the 
Red Sox, since they were greatly plagued by injuries in the second half 
of the season. He ended the season with a 10-game hitting streak. On May 
17, 2007, Hinske had what could be his career highlight. In the 5th inning 
of a game against the Tigers, a ball was hit to right field (where Hinske 
was playing) and it appeared that the ball was out of reach. But he made 
a full-body diving catch, while also driving his face into the ground from 
the impact after making the catch. According to Red Sox color analyst, 
Jerry Remy, "Gosh, that's one of the best catches you'll see all season 
long (2007 season.) I didn't think he was gonna get to this."[3] Later, 
in the bottom of the 7th inning, he would hit a home run into the Red Sox 
bullpen.[4] Hinske hit below his career norms with a .226 batting average 
and a .733 OPS in the 115 games he appeared in with the Red Sox but received 
his first World Series ring with them in 2007. On February 6, 2008, Hinske 
signed a minor-league contract with an invitation to spring training with 
the Tampa Bay Rays. He was added to the 40-man major league roster on March 
29, and was the Rays opening-day right-fielder. In his Rays debut, Hinske 
homered to right field off Baltimore starter Jeremy Guthrie. On July 29, 
Hinske hit his 100th career home run off former Toronto Blue Jays teammate 
Roy Halladay. There was controversy as to whether or not it was an inside 
the park home run. It was later officially ruled a traditional home run, 
after it was thought to have hit an awning in center field. On the final 
day of the regular season, Hinske hit his 20th home run, drove in his 60th 
run, and stole his 10th base of the year. It was the first time he had 
hit twenty home runs since his rookie year of 2002, and the first time 
he had stolen ten bases or more since the 2004 season. Prior to game 4 
of the World Series, Hinske was added to the Rays' roster, replacing the 
injured Cliff Floyd. In the fifth inning of Game 4, Hinske hit an estimated 
410-foot pinch-hit home run to center field off Philadelphia starter Joe 
Blanton. In Game 5 of the 2008 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, 
Hinske was the last batter struck out by Brad Lidge before the Rays lost 
the series. On January 30, 2009, Hinske signed a one-year deal with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates worth $1.5 million.[5] He played 54 games for the team 
batting .255 while driving in 11 runs.[6] In July, Hinske was traded from 
the Pirates to the New York Yankees in exchange for Eric Fryer and Casey 
Erickson. With New York he hit .226 with 7 home runs in 84 at-bats over 
39 games. Hinske was included in the Yankees' postseason roster for the 
first round of the 2009 American League Division Series, and for the World 
Series. This marked his third straight World Series appearance with his 
third different team, all from the AL East. Additionally, the Yankees win 
gave him his second World Series ring. On January 5, 2010, it was reported 
that Hinske signed a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with the Atlanta 
Braves. In his first Braves at-bat he hit a triple. He hit his first Home 
Run as a Brave on May 16, 2010. Over the season, he appeared in 131 games, 
hitting .256 with 11 home runs. He again made it to the postseason for 
the fourth straight year and hit a dramatic go-ahead two-run home run in 
the eighth inning of game three of the NLDS against the San Francisco Giants, 
but the Braves ultimately lost that game and were eliminated in game four. 
On December 2, 2010 the Atlanta Braves signed Hinske to a 1-year deal with 
an option for 2012. Hinske earned himself the nickname "Big Damage" during 
the early part of the 2011 season for his dramatic home runs and reckless 
abandon in his fielding. He is also occasionally called "Big Diesel" by 
Braves announcers. On June 3, 2011, Hinske hit a go-ahead solo homer off 
Mets closer Francisco Rodriguez to help the Braves win 6-3. On May 11, 
2012, Hinske was ejected by umpire Mike Muchlinski after Muchlinski ruled 
that Hinske had not checked his swing and was out on strikes.[7] According 
to a report on December 4, 2012, Hinske signed a 1-year deal with the Arizona 
Diamondbacks.[8] After passing a physical, the contract became official 
on December 6, 2012.[9] On June 14, 2013, Hinske was suspended for 5 games 
for an aggressive action during a Diamondbacks/Dodgers brawl on June 11, 
his suspension was later reduced to only one game. He was designated for 
assignment on June 28, 2013. Following the 2013 season, Hinske rejoined 
the Yankees, this time as a scout. He helped convince Brian McCann to sign 
with the Yankees. After a month as a Yankees' scout, Hinske was hired by 
the Chicago Cubs to be their first base coach on December 3, 2013.[10][11] 
On October 9, 2014, he took up the position of assistant hitting coach 
within the same organization. Hinske was raised in Menasha, Wisconsin. 
He attended Menasha High School and played baseball, basketball and football 
for the Menasha Blue Jays, and lettered in all three sports. Hinske and 
wife Kathryn, have two daughters, Ava, who was born August 8, 2007, Dylan 
who was born February 9, 2010 and a son, Aiden Jase (A.J.) born October 
31, 2013. Hinske enjoys listening to metal music, and his walk-up song 
is Walk by Pantera. Hinske has a large set of tattoos incorporating Japanese
