Benjamin P. Cherington (born July 14, 1974) is an American professional 
baseball executive. As of September 2016, he is the vice-president of baseball 
operations for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). From 
October 25, 2011, through August 18, 2015, he was the executive vice president 
and general manager of the Boston Red Sox. He succeeded Theo Epstein in 
that position, having worked in the team's baseball operations office since 
1999, before Epstein's arrival.[2] Born in Meriden, New Hampshire, he is 
the grandson of former Dartmouth College professor Richard Eberhart, a 
poet who won the Pulitzer Prize.[3] Cherington graduated from Lebanon High 
School, where he was a pitcher on the varsity baseball team. He matriculated 
at Amherst College, where he was a member of the Gamma chapter of Psi Upsilon 
fraternity, and has a master's degree in Sport Management from the University 
of Massachusetts Amherst. He was originally hired by the Red Sox in 1999 
by Dan Duquette, an Amherst College alumnus who was then the club's general 
manager, after Cherington spent the previous season as an advance scout 
for the Cleveland Indians.[4] Cherington served Boston as an area scout, 
baseball operations assistant, coordinator of international scouting, and 
assistant director (and then director) of player development from 1999–2005.[4] 
From December 12, 2005, through January 19, 2006, he served as co-general 
manager of the team with Jed Hoyer during Epstein's absence from the team,[5] 
with club president/CEO Larry Lucchino and veteran former Major League 
GM Bill Lajoie also playing key roles during that period. After Epstein's 
return, Cherington became vice president, player personnel, through January 
2009, then senior vice president and assistant GM from 2009 through his 
promotion to general manager after the 2011 season.[4] Cherington inherited 
a team that had tumbled out of contention for a division championship or 
wild card postseason appearance with a disastrous, 7–20 record during September 
2011. The slide cost eight-year manager Terry Francona his job and occurred 
as Epstein was negotiating to join the Chicago Cubs as their president 
of baseball operations.[6] Cherington's first major assignment after succeeding 
Epstein was to find a successor to Francona, but his final candidates were 
rejected by Boston's ownership and CEO Lucchino in favor of former Texas 
Rangers and New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine[7] — out of the Majors 
since 2002, although he had managed the Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional 
Baseball and served as a television analyst on ESPN since. Valentine's 
2012 roster included many veterans of the 2011 Red Sox, and he clashed 
with his players, his holdover coaches, and the media. The team suffered 
from injuries to key players, struggled out of the gate, improved to a 
high-water mark of 41–36 (.532) on June 29, but then began to fall back 
in the standings.[8] When it became clear that the Red Sox would not contend 
as constituted, Cherington and the team's ownership initiated a trade with 
the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 25, sending pitcher Josh Beckett, outfielder 
Carl Crawford and first baseman Adrian Gonzalez — all on expensive, multiyear 
contracts — to the Dodgers and clearing $262.5 million in salary obligations. 
Stripped of veteran talent, the 2012 Red Sox went only 9–26 over the final 
35 games of the season and finished with their worst record since 1965. 
Valentine was fired one day after the season ended October 3.[9] Cherington 
then set out to rebuild the team for 2013. He hired John Farrell as his 
manager, acquiring Farrell's rights in an October 21 trade with the Toronto 
Blue Jays. He signed seven key free agents — David Ross, Jonny Gomes, Stephen 
Drew, Mike Napoli, Shane Victorino, Koji Uehara and Ryan Dempster — none 
of whom required sacrificing a draft pick. Although a midwinter trade for 
relief pitcher Joel Hanrahan was ruined by Hanrahan's season-ending elbow 
injury in May, Cherington obtained a useful bench player, Mike Carp, in 
a preseason trade. Then, on July 30, he engineered a three-team transaction 
that brought starting pitcher Jake Peavy to Boston. Farrell, the free agents, 
Carp and Peavy, as well as a return to health of core players such as David 
Ortiz, Jacoby Ellsbury and John Lackey, all contributed to Boston's surprisingly 
successful 2013 season.[10] The club improved by 28 games, rising from 
last place in the American League East Division in 2012 to the division 
championship, 97 regular-season victories (tied for the most in Major League 
Baseball), the 2013 American League pennant, and the 2013 World Series 
championship.[11] During that offseason, Boston failed to re-sign free 
agents Ellsbury and Jarrod Saltalamacchia. The 2014 Red Sox, struggling 
to score runs, fell back to last place in the AL East, losing 26 games 
from their previous year's standard with a 71–91 record, 25 games behind 
the division champion Baltimore Orioles. On July 31, with Boston out of 
the race, Cherington traded starting pitchers Lackey and Jon Lester to 
contending teams (Peavy had been traded July 26), then retooled the roster 
during the 2014–15 offseason, adding high-ticket free agents Pablo Sandoval 
and Hanley Ramírez and trading for starting pitchers Wade Miley and Rick 
Porcello. After a promising 12–10 April start to their 2015 season, the 
Red Sox slumped to a 9–19 May record (scoring the fewest runs in the Major 
Leagues), and had a horrendous eight-game losing streak after the All-Star 
break. Porcello, Ramírez and Sandoval performed poorly, the latter two 
struggling with injuries and illness. On August 1, with the Red Sox again 
mired in last place at 47–58, Lucchino announced his intention to retire 
as president/CEO at the end of the season. Seventeen days later, the Red 
Sox named veteran MLB executive Dave Dombrowski to the new position of 
president, baseball operations, to oversee Cherington and the on-field 
side of the Boston organization. Cherington then turned in his resignation, 
declining the club's request that he remain as the team's general manager.[12] 
By that time, only one of the 2013 free agents, injured closer Uehara, 
remained on the Red Sox' roster. However, Cherington left behind a group 
of young players (Xander Bogaerts, Mookie Betts, Brock Holt, Eduardo Rodríguez, 
Blake Swihart, Travis Shaw, Henry Owens, Christian Vázquez, and others) 
as a potential core of their 2016 team.[13] Five weeks later, Mike Hazen, 
one of Cherington's assistants, was named his successor. Although Cherington's 
name was mentioned as a possible candidate for open general manager posts 
in MLB, he decided to join Columbia University's Sports Management faculty 
for the 2015–16 academic year to teach a course in "leadership in sports" 
during the spring 2016 semester.[14] On September 14, 2016, Cherington 
was hired by the Toronto Blue Jays to be their vice-president of baseball 
operations.[15] Cherington was named Major League Baseball Executive of 
the Year for 2013 by The Sporting News for his efforts. He was only the 
third Red Sox executive to win the award since its origination in 1936, 
following longtime owner Tom Yawkey (1946) and late general manager Dick 
O'Connell (1967; 1975). On April 6, 2012, Cherington married marketing 
executive Tyler Tumminia in a ceremony at Brooklyn Borough Hall.[16] Tumminia 
currently works for the New York Yankees [17] The couple has two daughters: 
Adwen Hudson (born 2012)[18] and Harper Charles.[19][20] Cherington was
