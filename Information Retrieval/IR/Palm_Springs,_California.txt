Palm Springs is a desert resort city in Riverside County, California, United 
States, within the Coachella Valley. It is located approximately 55 mi 
(89 km) east of San Bernardino, 107 mi (172 km) east of Los Angeles, 123 mi 
(198 km) northeast of San Diego, and 268 mi (431 km) west of Phoenix, Arizona. 
The population was 44,552 as of the 2010 census. Palm Springs covers approximately 
94 square miles (240 km2), making it the largest city in the county by 
land area. Biking, golf, hiking, horseback riding, swimming, and tennis 
in the nearby desert and mountain areas are major forms of recreation in 
Palm Springs. The city is also famous for its mid-century modern architecture 
and design elements.[6] Archaeological research has shown that the Cahuilla 
people have lived in the area for the past 350–500 years. The Cahuilla 
name for the area was "Se-Khi" (boiling water). When the Agua Caliente 
Reservation was established by the United States government in 1896, the 
reservation land was composed of alternating sections (640 acres) of land 
laid out across the desert in a checkerboard pattern. The alternating non-reservation 
sections were granted to the Southern Pacific Railroad as an incentive 
to bring rail lines through the open desert. Presently the Agua Caliente 
Band of Cahuilla Indians is composed of several smaller bands who live 
in the modern day Coachella Valley and San Gorgonio Pass areas. The Agua 
Caliente Reservation occupies 32,000 acres (13,000 ha), of which 6,700 
acres (2,700 ha) lie within the city limits, making the Agua Caliente band 
the city's largest landowner. (Tribal enrollment is currently estimated 
at between 296 and 365 people.)[citation needed] As of 1821 Mexico was 
independent of Spain and in March 1823 the Mexican Monarchy ended. That 
same year (in December) Mexican diarist José María Estudillo and Brevet 
Captain José Romero were sent to find a route from Sonora to Alta California; 
on their expedition they first recorded the existence of "Agua Caliente" 
at Palm Springs, California.[7][8]:30 With the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 
the region was ceded to the United States in 1848. One possible origin 
of palm in the place name comes from early Spanish explorers who referred 
to the area as La Palma de la Mano de Dios or "The Palm of God's hand".[9] 
The earliest use of the name "Palm Springs" is from United States Topographical 
Engineers who used the term in 1853 maps.[10] According to William Bright, 
when the word "palm" appears in Californian place names, it usually refers 
to the native California fan palm, Washingtonia filifera, which is abundant 
in the Palm Springs area.[11] Other early names were "Palmetto Spring" 
and "Big Palm Springs".[12] The first European resident in Palm Springs 
itself was Jack Summers, who ran the stagecoach station on the Bradshaw 
Trail in 1862.[13]:44, 149 Fourteen years later (1876), the Southern Pacific 
railroad was laid 6 miles to the north, isolating the station.[13]:17 In 
1880, local Indian Pedro Chino was selling parcels near the springs to 
William Van Slyke and Mathew Bryne in a series of questionable transactions; 
they in turn brought in W. R. Porter to help market their property through 
the "Palm City Land and Water Company".[8]:275 By 1885, when San Francisco 
attorney (later known as "Judge") John Guthrie McCallum began buying property 
in Palm Springs, the name was already in wide acceptance. The area was 
named "Palm Valley" when McCallum incorporated the "Palm Valley Land and 
Water Company" with partners O.C. Miller, H.C. Campbell, and James Adams, 
M.D.[8]:280[14][15] McCallum, who had brought his ill son to the dry climate 
for health, brought in irrigation advocate Dr. Oliver Wozencroft and engineer 
J. P. Lippincott to help construct a canal from the Whitewater River to 
fruit orchards on his property.[8]:276–9 He also asked Dr. Welwood Murray 
to establish a hotel across the street from his residence. Murray did so 
in 1886 (he later became a famous horticulturalist).[8]:280 The crops and 
irrigation systems suffered flooding in 1893 from record rainfall, and 
then an 11-year drought (1894–1905) caused further damage.[7]:40 The city 
became a fashionable resort in the 1900s[16] when health tourists arrived 
with conditions that required dry heat. Because of the heat, however, the 
population dropped markedly in the summer months.[17] In 1906 naturalist 
and travel writer George Wharton James' two volume The Wonders of the Colorado 
Desert described Palm Springs as having "great charms and attractiveness"[18]:278–81 
and included an account of his stay at Murray's hotel.[19] As James also 
described, Palm Springs was more comfortable in its microclimate because 
the area was covered in the shadow of Mount San Jacinto to the west[14] 
and in the winter the mountains block cold winds from the San Gorgonio 
pass.[20] Early illustrious visitors included John Muir and his daughters, 
U.S. Vice President Charles Fairbanks, and Fanny Stevenson, widow of Robert 
Louis Stevenson; still, Murray's hotel was closed in 1909 and torn down 
in 1954.[7]:45 Nellie N. Coffman and her physician husband Harry established 
The Desert Inn as a hotel and sanitarium in 1909.[21][22] It was expanded 
as a modern hotel in 1927 and continued on until 1967.[7]:Ch. 13[23][24] 
Coffman herself was a "driving force" in the city's tourism industry until 
her death in 1950.[25] James' Wonders of the Colorado Desert was followed 
in 1920 by J. Smeaton Chase's Our Araby: Palm Springs and the Garden of 
the Sun, which also served to promote the area.[26] In 1924 Pearl McCallum 
(daughter of Judge McCallum) returned to Palm Springs and built the Oasis 
Hotel with her husband Austin G. McManus; the Modern/Art Deco resort was 
designed by Lloyd Wright and featured a 40-foot tower.[7]:68–9[27] The 
next major hotel was the El Mirador, a large and luxurious resort that 
attracted the biggest movie stars; opening in 1927, its prominent feature 
was a 68-foot tall Renaissance style tower.[7]:Ch. 23[28] Silent film star 
Fritzi Ridgeway's 100-room Hotel del Tahquitz was built in 1929, next to 
the "Fool's Folly" mansion built by Chicago heiress Lois Kellogg.[29] Golfing 
was available at the O'Donnell 9 hole course (1926) and the El Mirador 
(1929) course (see Golf below). Hollywood movie stars were attracted by 
the hot dry, sunny weather and seclusion – they built homes and estates 
in the Warm Sands, The Mesa, and Historic Tennis Club neighborhoods (see 
Neighborhoods below). About 20,000 visitors came to the area in 1922.[30] 
Palm Springs became popular with movie stars in the 1930s[31] and estate 
building expanded into the Movie Colony neighborhoods, Tahquitz River Estates, 
and Las Palmas neighborhoods. Actors Charles Farrell and Ralph Bellamy 
opened the Racquet Club in 1934[7]:Ch. 25[32][33] and Pearl McCallum opened 
the Tennis Club in 1937.[27] Nightclubs were set up as well, with Al Wertheimer 
opening The Dunes outside of Palm Springs in 1934[7]:254 and the Chi Chi 
nightclub opening in 1936.[34][35] Besides the gambling available at the 
Dunes Club, other casinos included The 139 Club and The Cove Club outside 
of the city.[36][37] Southern California's first self-contained shopping 
center was established in Palm Springs as the Plaza Shopping Center in 
1936.[38] When the United States entered World War II, Palm Springs and 
the Coachella Valley were important in the war effort. The original airfield 
near Palm Springs became a staging area for the Air Corps Ferrying Command's 
21st Ferrying Group in November 1941 and a new airfield was built ½ mile 
from the old site. The new airfield,[43]:43 designated Palm Springs Army 
Airfield,[54] was completed in early 1942. Personnel from the Air Transport 
Command 560th Army Air Forces Base Unit stayed at the La Paz Guest Ranch 
and training was conducted at the airfield by the 72nd and 73rd Ferrying 
Squadrons. Later training was provided by the IV Fighter Command 459th 
Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron. Eight months before Pearl Harbor 
Day, the El Mirador Hotel was fully booked and adding new facilities.[55] 
After the war started, the U.S. government bought the hotel from owner 
Warren Phinney for $750,000[56] and converted it into the Torney General 
Hospital,[57] with Italian prisoners of war serving as kitchen help and 
orderlies in 1944 and 1945.[44] Through the war it was staffed with 1,500 
personnel and treated some 19,000 patients.[33]:55 General Patton's Desert 
Training Center encompassed the entire region, with its headquarters in 
Camp Young at the Chiriaco Summit and an equipment depot maintained by 
the 66th Ordnance in present-day Palm Desert.[43]:40 Architectural modernists 
flourished with commissions from the stars, using the city to explore architectural 
innovations, new artistic venues, and an exotic back-to-the-land experiences. 
Inventive architects designed unique vacation houses, such as steel houses 
with prefabricated panels and folding roofs, a glass-and-steel house in 
a boulder-strewn landscape, and a carousel house that turned to avoid the 
sun's glare.[58] In 1946 Richard Neutra designed the Edgar and Liliane 
Kaufmann House. A modernist classic, this mostly glass residence incorporated 
the latest technological advances in building materials, using natural 
lighting and floating planes and flowing space for proportion and detail.[59] 
In recent years an energetic preservation program has protected and enhanced 
many classic buildings. Culver (2010) argues that Palm Springs architecture 
became the model for mass-produced suburban housing, especially in the 
Southwest. This "Desert Modern" style was a high-end architectural style 
featuring open-design plans, wall-to-wall carpeting, air-conditioning, 
swimming pools, and very large windows. As Culver concludes, "While environmentalists 
might condemn desert modern, the masses would not. Here, it seemed, were 
houses that fully merged inside and outside, providing spaces for that 
essential component of Californian—and indeed middle-class American—life: 
leisure. While not everyone could have a Neutra masterpiece, many families 
could adopt aspects of Palm Springs modern."[60] Hollywood values permeated 
the resort as it combined celebrity, health, new wealth, and sex. As Culver 
(2010) explains: "The bohemian sexual and marital mores already apparent 
in Hollywood intersected with the resort atmosphere of Palm Springs, and 
this new, more open sexuality would gradually appear elsewhere in national 
tourist culture."[60] During this period, the city government, stimulated 
by real estate developers systematically removed and excluded poor people 
and Indians.[61][62] Palm Springs was pictured by the French photographer 
Robert Doisneau in November 1960 as part of an assignment for Fortune[63] 
on the construction of golf courses in this particularly dry and hot area 
of the Colorado desert. Doisneau submitted around 300 slides following 
his ten-day stay depicting the lifestyle of wealthy retirees and Hollywood 
stars in the 1960s. At the time, Palm Springs counted just 19 courses, 
which had grown to 125 by 2010.[64] Similar to the pre-war era, Palm Springs 
remained popular with the rich and famous of Hollywood, as well as retirees 
and Canadian tourists.[65] Between 1947 and 1965, the Alexander Construction 
Company built some 2,200 houses in Palm Springs effectively doubling its 
housing capacity. As the 1970s drew to a close, increasing numbers of retirees 
moved to the Coachella Valley. As a result, Palm Springs began to evolve 
from a virtual ghost town in the summer to a year-round community. Businesses 
and hotels that used to close for the months of July and August instead 
remained open all summer. As commerce grew, so too did the number of families 
with children. The recession of 1973–1975 affected Palm Springs as many 
of the wealthy residents had to cut back on their spending.[66] Later in 
the 1970s numerous Chicago mobsters invested $50 million in the Palm Springs 
area, buying houses, land, and businesses.[67] While Palm Springs faced 
competition from the desert cities to the east in the later 1980s,[68] 
it has continued to prosper into the 21st century.[69] Since the early 
1950s[70] the city had been a popular spring break resort. Glamorized as 
a destination in the 1963 movie Palm Springs Weekend,[71] the number of 
visitors grew and at times the gatherings had problems. In 1969 an estimated 
15,000 people had gathered for a concert at the Palm Springs Angel Stadium 
and 300 were arrested for drunkenness or disturbing the peace.[72] In the 
1980s 10,000+ college students would visit the city and form crowds and 
parties – and another rampage occurred in 1986[73] when Palm Springs Police 
in riot gear had to put down the rowdy crowd.[74] In 1990, due to complaints 
by residents, mayor Sonny Bono and the city council closed the city's Palm 
Canyon Drive to Spring Breakers and the downtown businesses lost money 
normally filled by the tourists.[75] Tourism is a major factor in the city's 
economy with 1.6 million visitors in 2011.[30] The city has over 130 hotels 
and resorts, numerous bed and breakfasts and over 100 restaurants and dining 
spots.[76] Following the recession of the late 2000s/early 2010s, Palm 
Springs is revitalizing its Downtown or "the Village". Rebuilding started 
with the demolition of the Bank of America building in January 2012, with 
the Desert Fashion Plaza scheduled for demolition later in 2012.[77] The 
movement behind Mid-Century modern architecture (1950s/60s era) in Palm 
Springs is backed by architecture enthusiasts, artistic designers and local 
historians to preserve many of Central Palm Springs' buildings and houses 
of famous celebrities, businessmen and politicians. Palm Springs is located 
at 33°49′26″N 116°31′49″W﻿ / ﻿33.82389°N 116.53028°W﻿ / 33.82389; -116.53028 
(33.823990, −116.530339) in the Sonoran Desert. According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 95.0 square miles (246 km2), 
of which 94.1 square miles (244 km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.3 km2) 
(1%) is water. Located in the Coachella Valley desert region, Palm Springs 
is sheltered by the San Bernardino Mountains to the north, the Santa Rosa 
Mountains to the south, by the San Jacinto Mountains to the west and by 
the Little San Bernardino Mountains to the east. Palm Springs has a hot 
desert climate, with over 300 days of sunshine and around 4.83 inches (122.7 mm) 
of rain annually.[78] The winter months are warm, with a majority of days 
reaching 70 °F (21 °C) and in January and February days often see temperatures 
of 80 °F (27 °C) and on occasion reach over 90 °F (32 °C), while, on average, 
there are 17 nights annually dipping to or below 40 °F (4 °C);[78] freezing 
temperatures occur in less than half of years. The lowest temperature recorded 
is 19 °F (−7 °C), on January 22, 1937.[79] Summer often sees daytime temperatures 
above 110 °F (43 °C) coupled with warm overnight lows remaining above 80 °F 
(27 °C). The mean annual temperature is 74.6 °F (23.7 °C). There are 180 
days with a high reaching 90 °F (32 °C), and 100 °F (38 °C) can be seen 
on 116 days.[78] The highest temperature on record in Palm Springs is 123 °F 
(51 °C), most recently achieved on July 28 and 29, 1995.[80] The locale 
features a variety of native Low Desert flora and fauna. A notable tree 
occurring in the wild and under cultivation is the California Fan Palm, 
Washingtonia filifera.[81] The City of Palm Springs has developed a program 
to identify distinctive neighborhoods in the community.[82] Of the 33 neighborhoods,[83] 
7 have historical and cultural significance.[84] The Movie Colony is just 
east of Palm Canyon Drive.[85] The Movie Colony East neighborhood extends 
further east from the Ruth Hardy Park.[86] These areas started growing 
in the 1930s as Hollywood movie stars built their smaller getaways from 
their Los Angeles area estates. Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Estée Lauder, 
and Bing Crosby built homes in these neighborhoods. In the 1960s, Robert 
Fey built 70 homes designed by Donald Wexler and Ric Harrison in the El 
Rancho Vista Estates.[87] Noted residents included Jack LaLanne and comic 
Andy Dick. Historic homes in the Warm Sands area date from the 1920s and 
many were built from adobe.[88] It also includes small resorts and the 
Ramon Mobile Home Park. Noted residents have included screenwriter Walter 
Koch, artist Paul Grimm, activist Cleve Jones and actor Wesley Eure. The 
Mesa started off as a gated community developed in the 1920s near the Indian 
Canyons.[89] Noted residents have included King Gillette, Zane Grey, Clark 
Gable, Carole Lombard, Suzanne Somers, Herman Wouk, Henry Fernandez, Barry 
Manilow and Trina Turk. Distinctive homes include Wexler's "butterfly houses" 
and the "Streamline Moderne Ship of the Desert".[90] Some of the homes 
in this neighborhood date from the 1930s. The area was owned by Pearl McCallum 
McManus and she started building homes in the neighborhood after World 
War II ended. Dr. William Scholl (Dr. Scholl's foot products) owned a 10-acre 
estate here. Today the neighborhood is the largest neighborhood organization 
with 600 homes and businesses within its boundaries.[91] During World War 
II, the original Sunmor Estates area was the western portion the Palm Springs 
Army Airfield.[92] Homes here were developed by Robert Higgins and the 
Alexander Construction Company. Actor and former mayor Frank Bogert bought 
his home for $16,000 and lived there for more than 50 years. Impoverished 
artist Carl Eytel first set up his cabin on what would become the Tennis 
Club in 1937. Another artist in the neighborhood, who built his Moroccan-style 
"Dar Marrac" estate in 1924, was Gordon Coutts.[93] Other estates include 
Samuel Untermyer's Mediterranean style villa (now The Willows Historic 
Palm Springs Inn),[94] the Casa Cody Inn, built by Harriet and Harold William 
Cody (cousin of Buffalo Bill Cody) and the Ingleside Inn,[95] built in 
the 1920s by the Humphrey Birge family. The neighborhood now has about 
400 homes, condos, apartments, inns and restaurants.[96] To the west of 
Palm Canyon Drive are the Vista Las Palmas,[97] Old Las Palmas, and Little 
Tuscany neighborhoods.[98] These areas also feature distinctive homes and 
celebrity estates. Historic Racquet Club Estates, located north of Vista 
Chino, is home to over five hundred mid-century modern homes from the Alexander 
Construction Company. "Meiselman" homes, and the famed Wexler steel homes 
(having Class One historic designation) are also prominent in the area.[99] 
Racquet Club Estates was Palm Springs' first middle income neighborhood. 
Deepwell Estates, the eastern portion of the square mile defined by South/East 
Palm Canyon, Mesquite, and Sunrise, contains around 370 homes, including 
notable homes architecturally and of celebrity figures. Among the celebrities 
who lived in the neighborhood are Jerry Lewis, Loretta Young, Liberace, 
and William Holden.[100][101] The 2010 United States Census[104] reported

has the fifth-highest percentage of same-sex households in the nation.[106]:27 
Former mayor Ron Oden estimated that about a third of Palm Springs is gay.[108] 
Over various times, the city has catered to LGBT tourists.[109] Palm Springs 
is host to the Greater Palm Springs Pride Celebration. This celebration, 
held every year in November, includes events such as the Palm Springs Pride 
Golf Classic, the Stonewall Equality Concert, and a Broadway in Drag Pageant. 
The city also held same sex wedding ceremonies at the iconic 'Forever Marilyn' 
statue located downtown, before its relocation in 2014. Though celebrities 
still retreat to Palm Springs, many today establish residences in other 
areas of the Coachella Valley. The city's economy now relies on tourism, 
and local government is largely supported by related retail sales taxes 
and the TOT (transient occupancy tax). It is a city of numerous festivals, 
conventions, and international events including the Palm Springs International 
Film Festival. The world's largest rotating aerial tramcars[110] (cable 
cars) can be found at the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway. These cars, built 
by Von Roll Tramways,[110] ascend from Chino Canyon two-and-a-half miles 
up a steep incline to the station at 8,516 feet (2,596 m). The San Jacinto 
Wilderness is accessible from the top of the tram and there is a restaurant 
with notable views. The Palm Springs Convention Center underwent a multimillion-dollar 
expansion and renovation under Mayor Will Kleindienst. The City Council 
Sub-Committee of Mayor Kleindienst and City Council Member Chris Mills 
selected Fentress Bradburn Architects[111] from Denver, Colorado for the 
redesign. Numerous hotels, restaurants and attractions cater to tourists, 
while shoppers can find a variety of high-end boutiques in downtown and 
uptown Palm Springs. The city is home to 20 clothing-optional resorts catering 
to gay men.[112] The following three parades, held on Palm Canyon Drive, 
were created by former Mayor Will Kleindienst: For many years, The Fabulous 
Palm Springs Follies was a stage-show at the historic Plaza Theatre featuring 
performers over the age of 55. Still Kicking: The Fabulous Palm Springs 
Follies is a 1997 Mel Damski short documentary film about the Follies. 
The Palm Springs Follies closed for good after the 2013-14 season.[128] 
Starting in 2004, the city worked with downtown businesses to develop the 
weekly Palm Springs VillageFest. The downtown street fair has been a regular 
Thursday evening event, drawing tourists and locals alike to Palm Canyon 
Drive to stroll amid the food and craft vendors.[129] Events related to 
films and film-craft are sponsored by the Desert Film Society.[130] The 
city council has established a 7-member commission to promote art in the 
city.[131] The commission has sponsored several notable public art projects 
in the city, including:[132] Numerous galleries and studios are located 
in the city and region.[145] The California Art Club has a chapter in Palm 
Springs.[146] The Desert Art Center of Coachella Valley was established 
in Palm Springs in 1950.[147] Palm Springs is home to the Palm Springs 
POWER, a semi-pro collegiate league baseball team composed of college all-stars 
of the Southern California Collegiate Baseball Association. It has a winter 
league baseball team, the POWER winter team and Palm Springs Chill of the 
California Winter League (2010) consists of 12 other teams as of 2016. 
The League plays its games in Palm Springs Stadium and also in the baseball 
field in nearby Palm Springs High School. The Palm Springs stadium was 
once the spring training site of the Major League Baseball California Angels 
(now the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim) of the American League from 1961

With more golf courses than any other region in California, Coachella Valley 
is the most popular golf vacation destination in California. Early golf 
courses in Palm Springs were the O'Donnell Golf Club (built by oil magnate 
Thomas A. O'Donnell)[152] and the El Mirador Hotel course, both of which 
opened in the 1920s.[7]:120 After the Cochran-Odlum (Indio) and Shadow 
Mountain pitch and putt courses were built after World II, the first 18-hole 
golf course in the area was the Thunderbird Country Club, established 1951 
in Rancho Mirage.[153][154] Thunderbird was designed by golf course architects 
Lawrence Hughes and Johnny Dawson[155] and in 1955 it hosted the 11th Ryder 
Cup championship. In the 1970s the area had over 40 courses and in 2001 
the 100th course was opened.[7]:121 The area is also home to the PGA Tour's

adopted by the voters in 1994.[170] Presently the city has a council-manager 
type government, with a five-person city council that hires a city manager 
and city attorney. The mayor is directly elected and serves a four-year 
term. The other four council members also serve four-year terms, with staggered 
elections. The city is considered a full-service city, in that it staffs 
and manages its own police and fire departments including parks and recreation 
programs, public library,[171] sewer system and wastewater treatment plant, 
international airport, and planning and building services. The city government 
is a member of the Southern California Association of Governments.[172]
