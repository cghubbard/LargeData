Mark Eugene Grace (born June 28, 1964) is a former Major League Baseball 
first baseman for 16 seasons with the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks. 
He won the 2001 World Series with the Diamondbacks, beating the New York 
Yankees. He batted left-handed. He wore jersey number 28 and 17 during 
his rookie season in 1988, and he kept number 17 for the remainder of his 
career. Grace retired with a .303 batting average and a .383 career on-base 
percentage, the 148th best in major league history. Grace played high school 
baseball and basketball at Tustin High School in Tustin, California. After 
playing baseball for San Diego State University, Grace was drafted by the 
Chicago Cubs in 1985. He spent three years playing in the Cubs farm system 
before making his major league debut May 2, 1988. Grace starred on Cubs 
teams that included Ryne Sandberg, Andre Dawson and Sammy Sosa and was 
a consistent, steady hitter, compiling almost 2,500 hits and more than 
500 doubles during his 16-year career and for a few years batted clean-up 
for the Cubs. He had a career on-base percentage of .383 and collected 
four Gold Glove Awards and was a three-time All-Star (1993, 1995, 1997). 
He holds the distinction of hitting more hits in the 1990s than anyone 
else. Grace helped lead the Cubs to the NL Eastern Division title in 1989 
and the NL Wild Card in 1998. In the 1989 N.L.C.S., Grace batted .647 in 
the five game contest with a home run and three doubles, while driving 
in 8 of the total 16 runs scored by the Cubs in the series. Grace led the 
team in average (.325), OBP (.393), hits (193), walks (71), doubles (39), 
and RBI (98 – a career high) in 1993 and was selected as an alternate to 
the National League All Star Team for the first time in his career. He 
also hit for the cycle on May 9 that year, and as of 2013 was the last 
Cub to have done so.[1] In 1995, Grace hit .326 with a .395 OBP and a .516 
SLG, and hit 51 doubles (which led the National League). He was once again 
named to the National League All-Star team. Grace collected the most hits 
(1,754) of any player in the 1990s. Grace and Pete Rose are the only Major 
League Baseball players to lead a decade in hits and not be in the Baseball 
Hall of Fame. Grace also had the most doubles in the 1990s with 364 and 
the most sacrifice flies with 73. The song that played most frequently 
on the Wrigley Field organ prior to a Grace at bat was "Taking Care of 
Business", which Grace explained was due to his bit part in a Jim Belushi 
film of the same name. Grace signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 
8, 2000 with a $6 million, two-year contract after the Cubs declined to 
offer salary arbitration. The deal included a mutual $3 million option 
year in 2003. He received $5.3 million in his last season with the Cubs 
but accepted less money for the opportunity to live year-round at his home 
in suburban Scottsdale, Arizona with his family. "For me to remain a Cub, 
the Cubs would have wanted to want me back and the Cubs would have had 
to win", Grace said at the time. "Neither of those happened and I'm one 
proud Diamondback now."[2] Grace wore his familiar No. 17 in Arizona where 
he played for three more seasons, including helping the Diamondbacks win 
the 2001 World Series. He never before even visited Yankee Stadium, and 
belted a home run in Game 4 of the series.[3] Grace led off the bottom 
of the 9th inning with a single off Yankee pitcher Mariano Rivera which 
rallied the Arizona Diamondbacks to a come-from-behind victory in Game 
7. His .515 batting average in League Championship Series play is a record 
for players in at least 10 games. During a 19–1 defeat to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in 2002, Grace pitched one inning of relief. He surrendered one 
run on catcher David Ross's first career home run. Grace also impersonated 
teammate Mike Fetters, who from the stretch took a deep breath, then quickly 
turned his head towards the catcher. For the 2014 baseball season he started 
a coaching career as the hitting instructor for the Diamondbacks Class 
A affiliate Hillsboro Hops in Hillsboro, Oregon, who went on to win the 
2014 Northwest League championship.[4] On September 26, 2003, Grace announced 
his retirement from baseball. He continued his involvement in the game 
as a television color commentator for the Diamondbacks and for Fox Saturday 
Baseball. Grace's trademark unusual style and off-the-wall terms (such 
as "slumpbuster", "never-say-die-mondbacks", and "Gas!") bring a unique 
quality[weasel words] to the Diamondbacks' broadcast team. Grace has stated 
a desire to coach a major league team in the future. He was considered 
for the Diamondbacks' managerial position following the 2004 season, but 
the Diamondbacks hired Bob Melvin instead. On August 3, 2006, Grace returned 
to Wrigley Field and sang "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" during the 7th-inning 
stretch for the first time. He was paired with Thom Brennaman on television 
from 2004 to 2006 and was paired with Daron Sutton from 2007 to 2012. Grace 
also agreed to a deal with Fox Sports in 2007. He originally rotated between 
the studio and the no.3 booth. He was then promoted to the no.2 booth with 
Thom Brennaman for the 2008 and 2009 season, and Dick Stockton for the 
2010 season. He reunited with Brennaman in 2011 before leaving the network 
at the end of the regular season. He was replaced by Eric Karros who had 
worked on the no.3 team with Kenny Albert. On August 24, 2012 Grace requested 
an indefinite leave of absence from the booth, and at the end of the 2012 
season, the team announced that he would not be returning for the 2013 
season.[5] Grace spent 2014 as hitting coach for the Hillsboro Hops of 
the Northwest League.[6] In 2015 he was promoted to the Diamondbacks to 
be their hitting coach.[7] He was fired after the 2016 season.[8] His ex-wife, 
Michelle, was also married to Ray Liotta, who played baseball player "Shoeless" 
Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams. As of 2006, he is divorced from his second 
wife Tanya, who stars on the VH1 show Baseball Wives. Grace lived in Antioch, 
Tennessee during a period of his childhood years. He currently resides 
in Paradise Valley, Arizona with his sons Jackson Gene and Preston Torre. 
Grace was known to smoke cigarettes before and after Cub games, and reportedly 
at times, during games in the clubhouse.[9] Grace has been arrested for 
drunk driving twice.[10] On October 3, 2012 a grand jury in Arizona indicted 
Grace on four felony counts stemming from his August 23, 2012 arrest in 
Scottsdale on suspicion of driving under the influence, driving with a 
suspended license and without an interlock device.[11] The Diamondbacks 
announced the following day that Grace would not return to his television 
broadcasting duties with the club. He subsequently pleaded guilty and was 
sentenced to four months in jail on January 31, 2013. The sentence included 
work-release jail time as well as two years of supervised probation. An 
interlock device was required to be installed in his vehicle for six months.[12] 
Grace became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009; 75% 
of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on 
the ballot. Grace received 4.1% of the vote and was dropped off the ballot.
