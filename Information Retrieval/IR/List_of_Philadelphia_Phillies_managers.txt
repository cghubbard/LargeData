In its 133-year history, the Philadelphia Phillies baseball franchise of 
Major League Baseball's National League has employed 53 managers.[1] The 
duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and 
off the field.[2] Of those 51 managers, 15 have been "player-managers";[1] 
specifically, they managed the team while still being signed as a player.[3] 
The Phillies posted their franchise record for losses in a season during 
their record-setting streak of 16 consecutive losing seasons (a season 
where the winning percentage is below .500), with 111 losses out of 154 games 
in 1941.[4] During this stretch from 1933 to 1948, the Phillies employed 
seven different managers, all of whom posted a winning percentage below 
.430 for their Phillies careers.[1] Seven managers have taken the Phillies 
to the postseason, with Danny Ozark and Charlie Manuel leading the team 
to three playoff appearances. Dallas Green and Charlie Manuel are the only 
Phillies managers to win a World Series: Green in the 1980 World Series 
against the Kansas City Royals; and Manuel in the 2008 World Series against 
the Tampa Bay Rays.[5] Gene Mauch is the longest-tenured manager in franchise 
history, with 1,332 games of service in parts of nine seasons (1960–1968).[6] 
Manuel surpassed Mauch for the most victories as a manager in franchise 
history on September 28, 2011, with a 13-inning defeat of the Atlanta Braves; 
it was the team's final victory in their franchise-record 102-win season. 
The manager with the highest winning percentage over a full season or more 
was Arthur Irwin, whose .575 winning percentage is fourth on the all-time 
wins list for Phillies managers.[1] Conversely, the worst winning percentage 
over a season in franchise history is .160 by the inaugural season's second 
manager Blondie Purcell, who posted a 13–68 record during the 1883 season.[7]
