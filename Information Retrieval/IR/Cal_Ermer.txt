As player As manager Calvin Coolidge Ermer (November 10, 1923 – August 
8, 2009) was an American second baseman, manager, coach and scout in Major 
League Baseball. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and served in the 
United States Marine Corps during World War II. He was the youngest of 
seven children (six boys and one girl). Some of his brothers names were 
John, Charles, Henry and William. As a player, Ermer threw and batted right-handed, 
stood 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). Infielder Ermer 
played in the minor leagues from 1942 to 1951 with two years—1943–1945 
gone to military service in World War II. As a minor league player he never 
played above A level, except for 1947 when he went to the Washington Senators 
and was in one major league game. Most of Ermer's 60-plus-year career in 
baseball was spent as an employee of the Minnesota Twins and its predecessor 
franchise (before 1961), the Washington Senators. His only Major League 
game as a player, on September 26, 1947, came with Washington; he was hitless 
in three at bats and handled seven fielding chances flawlessly as a second 
baseman. Ermer also played and managed in the club's farm system, handling 
Senators/Twins farm clubs over five different decades: Charlotte, North 
Carolina 1947; Orlando, Florida, 1950; Charlotte, 51; Chattanooga, Tennessee, 
52–57; Denver Bears, 1965–67; Tacoma, WA, 1974–76; Toledo, Ohio, 1978–85. 
During his managing career, he also served as a skipper in the minor league 
systems of the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Yankees, and in 1958 won 
The Sporting News Minor League Manager of the Year award while with the 
Birmingham Barons, then a farm team of the Detroit Tigers. His minor league 
teams won championships in 1947 and 1958. On June 9, 1967, Ermer was promoted 
from the Twins' Triple-A affiliate, the Denver Bears of the Pacific Coast 
League, to replace Minnesota manager Sam Mele.[1] Under Ermer, the Twins 
won 66 of 112 games and jumping into a four-team American League pennant 
race (with the Tigers, Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox) that went 
down to the season's final weekend. Needing only one win in two games at 
Boston's Fenway Park to clinch a tie for the championship, the Twins lost 
both contests to the Red Sox, who became improbable league champions. Ermer 
was brought back for 1968, but a big off-season trade with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers backfired, Baseball Hall of Fame slugger Harmon Killebrew suffered 
a serious hamstring injury during the 1968 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game, nearly ending his career, and the Twins tumbled to 79–83 and a seventh-place 
finish. At season's end, Ermer was fired[2] and replaced by his former 
coach Billy Martin. It was Martin's first big-league managing job. The 
Twins' job (his final record: 145–129, .529) was his only Major League 
managerial opportunity, but Ermer also served as an MLB coach for the Baltimore 
Orioles (1962), Milwaukee Brewers (1970–72) and Oakland Athletics (1977). 
He ultimately returned to the Twins to manage their Triple-A farm club, 
then the Toledo Mud Hens, in 1978–85 before spending many years as a Minnesota 
scout. As a minor league pilot, Ermer won 1,906 games, losing 1,728 (.524) 
over 26 seasons. Cal Ermer died at age 85 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on 
August 8, 2009.[3] Almost a year before, on August 30, 2008, the Chattanooga 
Lookouts (where he managed in 1952–57 and won the 1952 pennant) dedicated 
their press box to Ermer. He had met and married Gloria Williams (Miss 
Chattanooga and Miss Tennessee of 1952) and lived in Chattanooga for 57 years. 
Ermer was also soccer coach for the University of Baltimore and managed 
baseball teams in the winter leagues. He was buried in Chattanooga's National
