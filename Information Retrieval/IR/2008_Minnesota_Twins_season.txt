The 2008 Minnesota Twins season was the 48th season for the franchise in 
Minnesota, and the 108th overall in the American League. After tying the 
Chicago White Sox for first in the AL Central Division with an 88–74 record, 
the team lost a one game playoff to finish second and miss the league playoffs. 
General Manager for the previous 13 years, Terry Ryan stepped down into 
the role of Senior Advisor in September 2007 and was replaced by Bill Smith, 
formerly the assistant general manager. Scouting director Mike Radcliff 
was named vice president of player personnel and director of baseball operations 
Rob Antony was named assistant GM.[1] The offseason between the 2007 and 
2008 seasons saw many rumors surrounding pitcher Johan Santana, but little 
action until shortly before the start of spring training. Typically standing 
still in the off-season, the Twins made some waves late November when they 
traded Matt Garza, Jason Bartlett and Eduardo Morlan to the Tampa Bay Rays 
for power-hitting outfielder Delmon Young, scrappy infielder Brendan Harris 
and former Twin Jason Pridie. Prior to the Rays trade, the Twins traded 
for outfielder Craig Monroe of the Chicago Cubs. Monroe would later sign 
with the Twins and would be placed on the major league roster soon after. 
Monroe joined several others including Adam Everett and Mike Lamb as those 
new to the team who made the 2008 Opening Day roster. On January 18, 2008, 
the Twins avoided arbitration with three current players: Jason Kubel, 
Justin Morneau and Juan Rincón. Rincón and Kubel were signed through 2008, 
while Morneau and Michael Cuddyer were signed to extended contracts.[2] 
The Twins also saw several players depart via free agency, roster management 
and trade. The Twins also released players Jason Tyner, Chris Heintz, Lew 
Ford, Josh Rabe and Matthew LeCroy. Minnesota lost Carlos Silva via free 
agency, Silva signing with the Seattle Mariners for a four-year contract. 
Silva was a starting pitcher for the Twins in recent years after coming 
over in the Eric Milton trade. The Twins also lost perennial Gold Glove 
center fielder and fan favorite Torii Hunter in free agency, who signed 
with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for five years and $90 million. 
The Twins traded ace Johan Santana to the New York Mets for four prospects: 
outfielder Carlos Gómez and pitchers Kevin Mulvey, Philip Humber and Deolis 
Guerra. The Twins, as per long-standing tradition,[3] were the last team 
to begin spring training on February 17, 2008. On March 27, the Twins announced 
they had finished signing their entire 40-man roster.[4] Pitcher Francisco 
Liriano was unable to report to camp on time due to visa problems.[5] Shortly 
before the start of the season, Liriano was sent down to the minor leagues 
to continue his development.[6] Gómez beat out center field prospects Denard 
Span and Jason Pridie for the starting job.[7] The team re-signed closer 
Joe Nathan to a four-year contract on March 24.[8] On May 7, 2008, Carlos 
Gómez hit for the cycle against the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular 
Field in Chicago. He became the fourth major leaguer in history to hit 
for the reverse natural cycle. He also became the third-youngest player 
to hit for the cycle in MLB history.[9] It had been a spell of 22 years 
since the last Twin hit for the cycle, Kirby Puckett in 1986. On May 19, 
Bobby Korecky—with a single in the tenth inning—became the only Twins pitcher 
to get a hit in the Metrodome (1982–2009). In the third inning of the June 
15 game against the Milwaukee Brewers, Scott Baker became the first Minnesota 
Twin to strike out four men in a single inning. After Ryan Braun struck 
out, Prince Fielder struck out swinging at a wild pitch and made it to 
first base. Baker then struck out Russell Branyan and Mike Cameron to end 
the inning. Baker is the eighth American League pitcher to strike out the 
four consecutively. In 2012, Francisco Liriano will become the second Twin 
to accomplish the feat.[10] During the 2008 campaign, the Twins sent three 
representatives to the 2008 MLB All Star game: Joe Mauer, Justin Morneau 
and Joe Nathan. Morneau went on to win the home run derby[11] and score 
the winning run in the 15th inning of the All-Star game.[12] Joe Mauer 
won his second American League Batting Title with a .328 average. Justin 
Morneau set a new club record with 47 doubles, and led the major leagues 
playing in 163 games. Carlos Gómez topped Rod Carew's 1974 team record 
with 30 bunt singles (Carew had 29), a total which led the majors. Joe 
Mauer and Justin Morneau both won Silver Slugger Awards; Mauer added a 
Gold Glove Award as well. Infielders Other batters Coaches April 5, 2008:
