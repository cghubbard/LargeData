Portland (/ˈpɔːrtlənd/) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon 
and the seat of Multnomah County. It is located in the Willamette Valley 
region of the Pacific Northwest, at the confluence of the Willamette and 
Columbia Rivers. The city covers 145 square miles (380 square kilometers) 
and had an estimated population of 632,309 in 2015,[7][9] making it the 
26th most populous city in the United States. Approximately 2,389,228 people 
live in the Portland metropolitan statistical area (MSA), the 23rd most 
populous MSA in the United States. Its Combined Statistical Area (CSA) 
ranks 17th with a population of 3,022,178. Roughly 60% of Oregon's population 
resides within the Portland metropolitan area.[10] Named after the city 
on the coast of Maine, the Oregon settlement began to be populated in the 
1830s near the end of the Oregon Trail. Its water access provided convenient 
transportation of goods, and the timber industry was a major force in the 
city's early economy. At the turn of the 20th century, the city had developed 
a reputation as one of the most dangerous port cities in the world, a hub 
for organized crime and racketeering. After the city's economy experienced 
an industrial boom during World War II, its hard-edged reputation began 
to dissipate. Beginning in the 1960s,[11] Portland became noted for its 
growing liberal political values, and the city has earned a reputation 
as a bastion of counterculture, which proceeded into the 21st century.[12] 
According to a 2009 Pew Research Center study, Portland ranks as the eighth 
most popular American city, based on where people want to live.[13] The 
city operates with a commission-based government guided by a mayor and 
four commissioners as well as Metro, the only directly elected metropolitan 
planning organization in the United States.[14] The city government is 
notable for its land-use planning and investment in public transportation.[15] 
Portland is frequently recognized as one of the most environmentally conscious 
cities in the world because of its high walkability, large community of 
bicyclists, farm-to-table dining, expansive network of public transportation 
options, and over 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of public parks.[16] Its 
climate is marked by warm, dry summers and cold, rainy winters. This climate 
is ideal for growing roses, and Portland has been called the "City of Roses" 
for over a century.[17][18] "Keep Portland Weird" is an unofficial slogan 
for the city.[19] During the prehistoric period, the land that would become 
Portland was flooded after the collapse of glacial dams from Lake Missoula, 
located in what would later become Montana. These massive floods occurred 
during the last ice age and filled the Willamette Valley with 300 to 400 
feet (91 to 122 m) of water.[20] Before American pioneers began arriving 
in the 1800s, the land that eventually became Portland and surrounding 
Multnomah County was inhabited for many centuries by two bands of indigenous 
Chinook people— the Multnomah and the Clackamas peoples.[21] The Chinook 
people occupying the land which would become Portland were first documented 
by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1805.[22] Before its European 
settlement, the Portland Basin of the lower Columbia River and Willamette 
River valleys had been one of the most densely populated regions on the 
Pacific Coast.[22] Significant numbers of pioneer settlers began arriving 
in the Willamette Valley in the 1830s via the Oregon Trail, though life 
was originally centered in nearby Oregon City. In the early 1840s a new 
settlement began emerging ten miles from the mouth of the Willamette River,[23] 
roughly halfway between Oregon City and Fort Vancouver. This community 
was initially referred to as "Stumptown" and "The Clearing" because of 
the many trees being cut down to allow for its growth.[24] In 1843 William 
Overton saw potential in the new settlement but lacked the funds necessary 
to file an official land claim. For 25 cents Overton agreed to share half 
of the 640-acre (2.6 km2) site with Asa Lovejoy of Boston, Massachusetts.[25] 
In 1845 Overton sold his remaining half of the claim to Francis W. Pettygrove 
of Portland, Maine. Both Pettygrove and Lovejoy wished to rename "The Clearing" 
after their respective hometowns (Lovejoy's being Boston, and Pettygrove's, 
Portland). This controversy was settled with a coin toss which Pettygrove 
won in a series of two out of three tosses, thereby providing Portland 
with its namesake.[1] The coin used for this decision, now known as the 
Portland Penny, is on display in the headquarters of the Oregon Historical 
Society. At the time of its incorporation on February 8, 1851, Portland 
had over 800 inhabitants,[26] a steam sawmill, a log cabin hotel, and a 
newspaper, the Weekly Oregonian. A major fire swept through downtown in 
August 1873, destroying twenty blocks on the west side of the Willamette 
along Yamhill and Morrison Streets, and causing $1.3 million in damage.[27] 
By 1879, the population had grown to 17,500 and by 1890 it had grown to 
46,385.[28] In 1888, the city constructed the first steel bridge built 
on the West Coast.[29] Portland's access to the Pacific Ocean via the Willamette 
and the Columbia rivers, as well as its easy access to the agricultural 
Tualatin Valley via the "Great Plank Road" (the route of current-day U.S. 
Route 26), provided the pioneer city with an advantage over other nearby 
ports, and it grew very quickly.[30] Portland remained the major port in 
the Pacific Northwest for much of the 19th century, until the 1890s, when 
Seattle's deepwater harbor was connected to the rest of the mainland by 
rail, affording an inland route without the treacherous navigation of the 
Columbia River. The lumber industry also became a prominent economical 
presence, due to the area's large population of Douglas Firs, Western Hemlocks, 
Red Cedars, and Big Leaf Maple trees.[22] Portland developed a reputation 
early on in its history as a hard-edged and gritty port town.[32] Some 
historians have described the city's early establishment as being a "scion 
of New England; an ends-of-the-earth home for the exiled spawn of the eastern 
established elite."[33] In 1889, The Oregonian called Portland "the most 
filthy city in the Northern States," due to the unsanitary sewers and gutters,[34] 
and, at the turn of the 20th century, it was considered one of the most 
dangerous port cities in the world.[35] The city housed a large number 
of saloons, bordellos, gambling dens, and boardinghouses which were populated 
with miners after the California Gold Rush, as well as the multitude of 
sailors passing through the port.[32] By the early 20th century, the city 
had lost its reputation as a "sober frontier city" and garnered a reputation 
for being violent and dangerous.[32][36] Between 1900 and 1930, the population 
of the city tripled from nearly 100,000 to 301,815.[37] Following this 
population boom, Portland became a notorious hub for underground criminal 
activity and organized crime between the 1940s and 1950s.[38] In 1957, 
LIFE Magazine published an article detailing the city's history of government 
corruption and crime, specifically its gambling rackets and illegal nightclubs.[38] 
The article, which focused on crime boss Jim Elkins, became the basis of 
a fictionalized film titled Portland Exposé (1957). In spite of the city's 
seedier undercurrent of criminal activity, Portland was experiencing an 
economic and industrial surge during World War II. Ship builder Henry J. 
Kaiser had been awarded contracts to construct Liberty ships and aircraft 
carrier escorts, and chose sites in Portland and Vancouver, Washington 
for work yards.[39] During this time, Portland's population rose by over 
150,000, largely attributed to recruited laborers.[39] During the 1960s, 
an influx of hippie subculture began to take root in the city in the wake 
of San Francisco's burgeoning countercultural scene.[11] The city's Crystal 
Ballroom became a hub for the city's psychedelic culture, while food cooperatives 
and listener-funded media and radio stations were established.[40] A large 
social activist presence evolved during this time as well, specifically 
concerning Native American rights, environmentalist causes, and gay rights.[40] 
By the 1970s, Portland had well established itself as a progressive city, 
and experienced an economic boom for the majority of the decade; however, 
the slowing of the housing market in 1979 caused demand for the city and 
state timber industries to drop significantly.[41] In the 1990s, the technology 
industry began to emerge in Portland, specifically with the establishment 
of companies like Intel, which brought more than $10 billion in investments 
in 1995 alone.[42] After the year 2000, Portland experienced significant 
growth, with a population rise of over 90,000 between the years 2000 and 
2014.[43] The city's increased presence within the cultural lexicon has 
established it a popular city for young people, and it was second only 
to Louisville, Kentucky as one of the cities to attract and retain the 
highest number of college-educated people in the United States.[44] Between 
2001 and 2012, Portland's gross domestic product per person grew fifty 
percent, more than any other city in the country.[44] The city has acquired 
a diverse range of nicknames throughout its history, though it is most 
frequently called "Rose City" or "The City of Roses",[45] the latter of 
which being its unofficial nickname since 1888 and its official nickname 
since 2003.[46] Another widely utilized nickname by local residents in 
everyday speech is "PDX", which is also the airport code for Portland International 
Airport. Other nicknames include Bridgetown,[47] Stumptown,[48] Rip City,[49] 
Soccer City,[50][51][52] P-Town,[46][53] Portlandia, and the more antiquated 
Little Beirut.[54] Portland is located 60 miles east of the Pacific Ocean 
at the northern end of Oregon's most populated region, the Willamette Valley. 
Downtown Portland straddles the banks of the Willamette River, which flows 
north through the city center and consequently separates the east and west 
neighborhoods of the city. Less than 10 miles from downtown, the Willamette 
River flows into the Columbia River, the fourth-largest river in the United 
States, which divides Oregon from Washington state. Portland is about 100 
miles upriver from the Pacific Ocean on the Columbia. Though much of downtown 
Portland is relatively flat, the foothills of the Tualatin Mountains, more 
commonly referred to locally as the "West Hills", pierce through the northwest 
and southwest reaches of the city. Council Crest Park, the tallest point 
within city limits, is located in the West Hills and rises to an elevation 
of 1,073 feet. The highest point east of the river is Mt. Tabor, an extinct 
volcanic cinder cone, which rises to 636 feet. Nearby Powell Butte and 
Rocky Butte rise to 614 feet and 612 feet, respectively. To the west of 
the Tualatin Mountains lies the Oregon Coast Range, and to the east lies 
the actively volcanic Cascade Range. On clear days, Mt. Hood and Mt St. 
Helens dominate the horizon, while Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier can also be 
visible in the distance. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 145.09 square miles (375.78 km2), of which 
133.43 square miles (345.58 km2) is land and 11.66 square miles (30.20 km2) 
is water.[3] Although almost all of Portland lies within Multnomah County, 
small portions of the city lie within Clackamas and Washington Counties, 
with populations estimated at 785 and 1,455, respectively.[citation needed] 
Portland lies on top of an extinct volcanic field known as the Boring Lava 
Field.[55] The Boring Lava Field contains at least 32 cinder cones such 
as Mount Tabor,[56] and its center lies in southeast Portland. Mount St. 
Helens, a highly active volcano 50 miles northeast of the city in Washington 
State, is easily visible on clear days and is close enough to have dusted 
the city with volcanic ash after its eruption on May 18, 1980.[57] Portland's 
cityscape derives much of its character from the numerous bridges that 
span the Willamette River downtown, several of which are historic landmarks, 
and Portland has been nicknamed "Bridgetown" for many decades as a result.[47] 
Three of downtown's most heavily utilized bridges are more than 100 years 
old and are designated historic landmarks: Hawthorne Bridge (1910), Steel 
Bridge (1912), and Broadway Bridge (1913). Portland's newest bridge in 
the downtown area, Tilikum Crossing, opened in 2015 and is the first new 
bridge to span the Willamette in Portland since the 1973 opening of the 
double-decker Fremont Bridge. Other bridges that span the Willamette river 
in the downtown area include the Burnside Bridge, the Ross Island Bridge 
(both built 1926), and the double-decker Marquam Bridge (built 1966). Other 
bridges outside the downtown area include the Sellwood Bridge (built 1925) 
to the south; and the St. Johns Bridge, a Gothic revival suspension bridge 
built in 1933, to the north. The Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge and the 
Interstate Bridge provide access from Portland across the Columbia River 
into Washington state. The Willamette River, which flows north through 
downtown, serves as the natural boundary between east and west Portland. 
The denser and earlier-developed west side extends into the lap of the 
West Hills, while the flatter east side fans out for roughly 180 blocks 
until it meets the suburb of Gresham. In 1891 the cities of Portland, Albina, 
and East Portland were consolidated, creating inconsistent patterns of 
street names and addresses. The "great renumbering" on September 2, 1931 
standardized street naming patterns, divided Portland into five official 
quadrants, and changed house numbers from 20 per block to 100 per block. 
The five quadrants of Portland have come to develop distinctive identities 
over time, with mild cultural differences and friendly rivalries between 
their residents, especially between those who live east of the Willamette 
River versus west of the river.[58] The official quadrants of Portland 
are: North, Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast, with downtown 
Portland being located in the SW quadrant. The Willamette River divides 
the east and west quadrants while Burnside Street, which traverses the 
entire city lengthwise, divides the north and south quadrants. All addresses 
within the city are denoted as belonging to one of these specific quadrants 
with the prefixes: N, NW, NE, SW or SE. Though officially located in SW 
Portland, the RiverPlace, John's Landing and South Waterfront neighborhoods 
lie in a so-called (but unofficial) "sixth quadrant" called South Portland, 
where addresses rise higher from west to east toward the river. This "sixth 
quadrant" is roughly bounded by Naito Parkway and Barbur Boulevard to the 
west, Montgomery Street to the north and Nevada Street to the south. East-West 
addresses in this area are denoted with a leading zero (instead of a minus 
sign). This means 0246 SW California St. is not the same as 246 SW California 
St. Many mapping programs are unable to distinguish between the two. The 
Pearl District in Northwest Portland, which was largely occupied by warehouses, 
light industry and railroad classification yards in the early to mid-20th 
century, now houses upscale art galleries, restaurants, and retail stores, 
and is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city.[59] Areas further 
west of the Pearl District include neighborhoods known as Uptown and Nob 
Hill, as well as the Alphabet District and NW 23rd Ave., a major shopping 
street lined with clothing boutiques and other upscale retail, mixed with 
cafes and restaurants.[60][61] Northeast Portland is home to the Lloyd 
District, Alberta Arts District, and the Hollywood District. The northernmost 
point of the city, known simply as North Portland, is also largely residential; 
it contains the St. Johns neighborhood, which is historically one of the 
most ethnically diverse and poorest neighborhoods in the city.[62] Old 
Town Chinatown is located adjacent to the Pearl District in Northwest Portland, 
while Southwest Portland consists largely of the downtown district, made 
up of commercial businesses, museums, skyscrapers, and public landmarks. 
Southeast Portland is largely residential, and consists of the Hawthorne 
District, Belmont, Brooklyn, and Mount Tabor. Portland experiences a temperate 
climate with both oceanic and Mediterranean features.[63] This climate 
is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, rainy winters.[64] The 
precipitation pattern is distinctly Mediterranean, with little to no rainfall 
occurring during the summer months and more than half of annual precipitation 
falling between November and February. Portland experiences a much cooler 
climate than areas of similar latitude on the west coast of Europe. Of 
the three most populated cities within the Pacific Northwest (Seattle, 
Vancouver and Portland, respectively) Portland has the warmest average 
temperature, the highest number of sunshine hours, and the fewest inches 
of rainfall and snowfall.[65] According to the Köppen climate classification, 
Portland falls within the dry-summer mild temperate zone (Csb), also referred 
to as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate[64][66] with a USDA Plant Hardiness 
Zones between 8b and 9a.[67] Other climate systems, such as the Trewartha 
climate classification, places it within the oceanic zone (Do), like much 
of the Pacific Northwest and Western Europe.[68] Summers in Portland are 
warm to hot, dry, and sunny.[69] The months of June, July, August and September 
account for a combined 4.49 inches (114 mm) of total rainfall – only 12% 
of the 36.03 in (915 mm) of the precipitation that falls throughout the 
year. The warmest month is August, with an average high temperature of 
81.1 °F (27.3 °C). Because of its inland location 70 miles (110 km) from 
the coast, as well as the protective nature of the Oregon Coast Range to 
its west, Portland summers are less susceptible to the moderating influence 
of the nearby Pacific Ocean. Consequently, Portland experiences heat waves 
with temperatures rising well above 90 °F (32 °C) for days at a time, and 
sometimes above 100 °F (38 °C). On average, temperatures reach or exceed 
80 °F (27 °C) 56 days per year, of which 12 days will reach 90 °F (32 °C) 
and 1.4 days will reach 100 °F (38 °C). The most 90 degree days ever recorded 
in one year is 29, which happened in 2015.[70] The highest temperature 
ever recorded was 107 °F (42 °C),[71] on July 30, 1965, as well as August 
8 and 10, 1981.[72] The warmest recorded overnight low was 74 °F (23 °C) 
on July 28, 2009.[72] A temperature of 100 °F (38 °C) has been recorded 
in all five months from May through September. Spring and fall can bring 
variable weather including warm fronts that send temperatures surging above 
80 °F (27 °C) and cold snaps that plunge daytime temperatures into the 
40s °F (4–9 °C). However, consistently mild temperatures in the 50s and 
60s °F (12−19 °C) are the norm  – with lengthy stretches of cloudy or partly 
cloudy days beginning in mid fall and continuing into mid spring. Rain 
often falls as a light drizzle for several consecutive days at a time, 
contributing to 155 days on average with measurable (≥0.01 in or 0.25 mm) 
precipitation annually. Temperatures have reached 90 °F (32 °C) as early 
as May 3 and as late as October 5, while 80 °F (27 °C) has been reached 
as early as April 1 and as late as October 21. Severe weather, such as 
thunder and lightning, is uncommon and tornadoes are exceptionally rare.[73][74] 
Winters are cool, cloudy, and rainy. The coldest month is December with 
an average daily high of 45.6 °F (7.6 °C), although overnight lows usually 
remain above freezing. Evening temperatures fall to or below freezing 33 
nights per year on average, but very rarely to or below 20 °F (−7 °C). 
There are only 2.1 days per year where the daytime high temperature fails 
to rise above freezing. The lowest overnight temperature ever recorded 
was −3 °F (−19 °C),[71] on February 2, 1950[72] while the coldest daytime 
high temperature ever recorded was 14 °F (−10 °C) on December 30, 1968.[72] 
The average window for freezing temperatures to potentially occur is between 
November 15 and March 19, allowing a growing season of 240 days.[72] Snowfall 
is uncommon with a normal yearly accumulation of 4.3 inches (10.9 cm), 
which usually falls during only two or three days per year. Portland has 
one of the warmest and least snowy winters of any non-Sun Belt city in 
the United States, with more than 25 percent of its winters receiving no 
snow whatsoever.[75] The city of Portland avoids snow more frequently than 
its suburbs, due in part to its low elevation and urban heat island effect. 
Neighborhoods outside of the downtown core, especially in slightly higher 
elevations near the West Hills and Mount Tabor, can experience a dusting 
of snow while downtown receives no accumulation at all. The city has experienced 
a few major snow and ice storms in its past with extreme totals having 
reached 44.5 in (113 cm) at the airport in 1949–50 and 60.9 in (155 cm) 
at downtown in 1892–93.[76][77] The census reported the city as 76.1% White 
(444,254 people), 7.1% Asian (41,448), 6.3% Black or African American (36,778), 
1.0% Native American (5,838), 0.5% Pacific Islander (2,919), 4.7% belonging 
to two or more racial groups (24,437) and 5.0% from other races (28,987).[82] 
9.4% were Hispanic or Latino, of any race (54,840). Whites not of Hispanic 
origin made up 72.2% of the total population.[82] In 1940, Portland's African-American 
population was approximately 2,000 and largely consisted of railroad employees 
and their families.[83] During the war-time liberty ship construction boom, 
the need for workers drew many blacks to the city. The new influx of blacks 
settled in specific neighborhoods, such as the Albina district and Vanport. 
The May 1948 flood which destroyed Vanport eliminated the only integrated 
neighborhood, and an influx of blacks into the northeast quadrant of the 
city continued.[83] Portland's longshoremen racial mix was described as 
being "lily-white" in the 1960s, when the local International Longshore 
and Warehouse Union declined to represent grain handlers since some were 
black.[84] At 6.3%, Portland's African American population is three times 
the state average. Over two thirds of Oregon's African-American residents 
live in Portland.[83] As of the 2000 census, three of its high schools 
(Cleveland, Lincoln and Wilson) were over 70% white, reflecting the overall 
population, while Jefferson High School was 87% non-white. The remaining 
six schools have a higher number of non-whites, including blacks and Asians. 
Hispanic students average from 3.3% at Wilson to 31% at Roosevelt.[85] 
Portland residents identifying solely as Asian Americans account for 7.1% 
of the population; an additional 1.8% is partially of Asian heritage. Vietnamese 
Americans make up 2.2% of Portland's population, and make up the largest 
Asian ethnic group in the city, followed by Chinese (1.7%), Filipinos (0.6%), 
Japanese (0.5%), Koreans (0.4%), Laotians (0.4%), Hmong (0.2%), and Cambodians 
(0.1%).[87] There is a small population of Yao people that live in Portland. 
Portland has two Chinatowns, with New Chinatown located along SE 82nd Avenue 
with Chinese supermarkets, Hong Kong style noodle houses, dim sum, and 
Vietnamese phở restaurants.[88] With about 12,000 Vietnamese residing in 
the city proper, Portland has one of the largest Vietnamese populations 
in America per capita.[89] According to statistics there are 21,000 Pacific 
Islanders in Portland, making up 4% of the population.[90] Portland's population 
has been and remains predominantly white. In 1940, whites were over 98% 
of the city's population.[91] In 2009, Portland had the fifth-highest percentage 
of white residents among the 40 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. A 2007 
survey of the 40 largest cities in the U.S. concluded that Portland's urban 
core has the highest percentage of white residents.[92] Some scholars have 
noted the Pacific Northwest as a whole is "one of the last Caucasian bastions 
of the United States".[93] While Portland's diversity was historically 
comparable to metro Seattle and Salt Lake City, those areas grew more diverse 
in the late 1990s and 2000s. Portland not only remains white, but migration 
to Portland is disproportionately white.[92][94] The Oregon Territory banned 
African American settlement in 1849. In the 19th century, certain laws 
allowed the immigration of Chinese laborers but prohibited them from owning 
property or bringing their families.[92][95][96] The early 1920s saw the 
rapid growth of the Ku Klux Klan, which became very influential in Oregon 
politics, culminating in the election of Walter M. Pierce as governor.[95][96][97] 
The largest influxes of minority populations occurred during World War 
II, as the African American population grew by a factor of 10 for wartime 
work.[92] After World War II, the Vanport flood in 1948 displaced many 
African Americans. As they resettled, redlining directed the displaced 
workers from the wartime settlement to neighboring Albina.[93][96][98] 
There and elsewhere in Portland, they experienced police hostility, lack 
of employment, and mortgage discrimination, leading to half the black population 
leaving after the war.[92] In the 1980s and 1990s, radical skinhead groups 
flourished in Portland.[96] In 1988, Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian immigrant, 
was killed by three skinheads. The response to his murder involved a community-driven 
series of rallies, campaigns, nonprofits and events designed to address 
Portland's racial history, leading to a city considered significantly more 
tolerant than in 1988 at Seraw's death.[99] During redevelopment of north 
Portland along the MAX Yellow Line, displacement of minorities occurred 
at a drastic rate. Out of 29 census tracts in north and northeast Portland, 
ten were majority nonwhite in 2000. By 2010, none of these tracts were 
majority nonwhite as gentrification drove the cost of living up.[100] Today, 
Portland's African-American community is concentrated in the north and 
northeast section of the city, mainly in the King neighborhood. As of the 
2010 census, there are 583,776 people residing in the city, organized into 
235,508 households. The population density is 4,375.2 people per square 
mile. There are 265,439 housing units at an average density of 1989.4 per 
square mile (1,236.3/km²). Population growth in Portland increased 10.3% 
between 2000 and 2010.[101] Population growth in the Portland metropolitan 
area has outpaced the national average during the last decade, and this 
is expected to continue over the next 50 years.[102] Out of 223,737 households, 
24.5% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.1% are married 
couples living together, 10.8% have a female householder with no husband 
present, and 47.1% are non-families. 34.6% of all households are made up 
of individuals and 9% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age 
or older. The average household size is 2.3 and the average family size 
is 3. The age distribution was 21.1% under the age of 18, 10.3% from 18 
to 24, 34.7% from 25 to 44, 22.4% from 45 to 64, and 11.6% who are 65 years 
of age or older. The median age is 35 years. For every 100 females there 
are 97.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 95.9 males. 
The median income for a household in the city is $40,146, and the median 
income for a family is $50,271. Males have a reported median income of 
$35,279 versus $29,344 reported for females. The per capita income for 
the city is $22,643. 13.1% of the population and 8.5% of families are below 
the poverty line. Out of the total population, 15.7% of those under the 
age of 18 and 10.4% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty 
line. Figures delineating the income levels based on race are not available 
at this time. According to the Modern Language Association, in 2010 80.92% 
(539,885) percent of Multnomah County residents ages 5 and over spoke English 
as their primary language at home.[103] 8.10% of the population spoke Spanish 
(54,036), with Vietnamese speakers making up 1.94%, and Russian 1.46%.[103] 
The Portland metropolitan area has historically had a significant LGBT 
population throughout the late 20th and 21st century.[105][106] In 2015, 
the city metro had the second highest percentage of LGBT residents in the 
United States with 5.4% of residents identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual, 
or transgender, second only to San Francisco.[107] In 2006, it was reported 
to have the seventh highest LGBT population in the country, with 8.8% of 
residents identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the metro ranking 
fourth in the nation at 6.1%.[108] The city held its first pride festival 
in 1975 on the Portland State University campus.[109] Portland is known 
for its population of hipsters.[110] Portland has been cited as the least 
religious city in the United States,[111] with over 42% of residents identifying 
as religiously "unaffiliated,"[112] according to the nonpartisan and nonprofit 
Public Religion Research Institute's American Values Atlas.[113] Of the 
35.89% of the city's residents who do identify as religious, Roman Catholics 
make up the largest group, at 15.8%.[104] The second highest religious 
group in the city are Evangelical Christians at 6.04%, with Baptists following 
behind at 2.5%. Latter Day Saints make up 2.3% of the city's religiously 
affiliated population, with Lutheran and Pentecostal following behind.[104] 
1.48% of religiously affiliated persons identified themselves as following 
Eastern religions, while 0.86% of the religiously affiliated population 
identified as Jewish, and 0.29% as Muslim.[104] Portland's location is 
beneficial for several industries. Relatively low energy cost, accessible 
resources, north–south and east–west Interstates, international air terminals, 
large marine shipping facilities, and both west coast intercontinental 
railroads are all economic advantages.[114] The U.S. consulting firm Mercer, 
in a 2009 assessment "conducted to help governments and major companies 
place employees on international assignments", ranked Portland 42nd worldwide 
in quality of living; the survey factored in political stability, personal 
freedom, sanitation, crime, housing, the natural environment, recreation, 
banking facilities, availability of consumer goods, education, and public 
services including transportation.[115] In 2012, the city was listed among 
the 10 best places to retire in the U.S. by CBS MoneyWatch.[116][117] The 
city's marine terminals alone handle over 13 million tons of cargo per 
year, and the port is home to one of the largest commercial dry docks in 
the country.[118][119] The Port of Portland is the third-largest export 
tonnage port on the west coast of the U.S., and being located about 80 
miles (130 km) upriver, it is the largest fresh-water port.[114] The city 
of Portland is largest shipper of wheat in the United States,[120][121] 
and is the second-largest port for wheat in the world.[122] The steel industry's 
history in Portland predates World War II. By the 1950s, the steel industry 
became the city's number one industry for employment. The steel industry 
thrives in the region, with Schnitzer Steel Industries, a prominent steel 
company, shipping a record 1.15 billion tons of scrap metal to Asia during 
2003. Other heavy industry companies include ESCO Corporation and Oregon 
Steel Mills.[123][124] Technology is a major component of the city's economy, 
with more than 1,200 technology companies existing within the metro.[114] 
This high density of technology companies has led to the nickname Silicon 
Forest being used to describe the Portland area, a reference to the abundance 
of trees in the region and to the Silicon Valley region in Northern California.[125] 
The area also hosts facilities for software companies and online startup 
companies, some supported by local seed funding organizations and business 
incubators.[126] Computer components manufacturer Intel is the Portland 
area's largest employer, providing jobs for more than 15,000 people, with 
several campuses to the west of central Portland in the city of Hillsboro.[114] 
The Portland metro area has become a business cluster for athletic and 
footwear manufacturers.[127] The area is home to the global, North American 
or U.S. headquarters of Nike, Adidas, Columbia Sportswear, LaCrosse Footwear, 
Dr. Martens, Li-Ning,[128] Keen,[129] and Hi-Tec Sports.[130] While headquartered 
elsewhere, Merrell, Amer Sports and Under Armour have design studios and 
local offices in the Portland area. Portland-based Precision Castparts 
is one of two Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Oregon, the other 
being Nike. Other notable Portland-based companies include film animation 
studio Laika; commercial vehicle manufacturer Daimler Trucks North America; 
advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy; bankers Umpqua Holdings; and retailers 
Fred Meyer, New Seasons and Storables. Portland is home to famous bands 
such as the Kingsmen and Paul Revere & the Raiders, both famous for their 
association with the song "Louie Louie" (1963).[132] Other widely known 
musical groups include the Dandy Warhols, Quarterflash, Everclear, Pink 
Martini, The Hugs, Sleater-Kinney, the Shins, Blitzen Trapper, the Decemberists, 
and the late Elliott Smith. In the 1980s, the city was home to a burgeoning 
punk scene, which included bands such as the Wipers and Dead Moon.[133] 
The city's now-demolished Satyricon nightclub was a punk venue that is 
notorious for being the place where Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain first 
encountered future wife and Hole frontwoman Courtney Love in 1990.[134] 
Love was then a resident of Portland and started several bands there with 
Kat Bjelland, later of Babes in Toyland.[131][135] Multi-Grammy award-winning 
jazz artist Esperanza Spalding is from Portland and performed with the 
Chamber Music Society of Oregon at a young age.[136] In 2013, the Guardian 
named the city's music scene as one of the "most vibrant" in the United 
States.[137] According to the New York Times, the dozens of karaoke bars 
in Portland make it not just "the capital of karaoke" in the United States 
but also "one of the most exciting music scenes in America.[138] Portland 
also has a range of classical performing arts institutions, which include 
the Oregon Symphony, Portland Opera, and the Portland Youth Philharmonic. 
The city is also home to several theaters and performing arts institutions, 
including the Oregon Ballet Theatre, Northwest Children's Theatre, Portland 
Center Stage, Artists Repertory Theatre, Miracle Theatre, and Tears of 
Joy Theatre. A wide range of films have been shot in Portland, from various 
independent features to major big-budget productions (see List of films 
shot in Oregon for a complete list). Director Gus Van Sant has notably 
set and shot many of his films in the city.[139] The IFC sketch comedy 
series Portlandia, starring Fred Armisen and Sleater-Kinney member Carrie 
Brownstein, shoots on location in Portland, satirizing the city as a hub 
of liberal politics, organic food, alternative lifestyles, and anti-establishment 
attitudes.[140] MTV's long-time running reality show The Real World was 
shot in Portland for the show's 29th season. The Real World: Portland premiered 
on MTV on March 27, 2013, and was filmed in a loft in the Pearl District. 
The show featured the cast members taking part in several Portland activities, 
such as hiking in the Columbia River Gorge. The cast members worked at 
a local frozen yogurt shop and the local Pizza Schmizza. Other TV shows 
shot in the city include Leverage, The Librarians, Under Suspicion, Grimm, 
Nowhere Man, and Life Unexpected. An unusual feature of Portland entertainment 
is the large number of movie theaters serving beer, often with second-run 
or revival films.[141] Notable examples of these "brew and view" theaters 
include the Bagdad Theater and Pub, a former vaudeville theater built in 
1927 by Universal Studios;[142] Cinema 21; and the Laurelhurst Theater, 
in operation since 1923. Portland hosts the world's longest-running H. 
P. Lovecraft Film Festival[143] at the Hollywood Theatre.[144] Portland 
museums offer a variety of educational programs. The Oregon Museum of Science 
and Industry (OMSI) includes many hands-on activities for adults and children. 
It consists of five main halls, most of which consist of smaller laboratories: 
Earth Science Hall, Life Science Hall, Turbine Hall, Science Playground, 
and Featured Exhibit Hall. The Featured Exhibit Hall has a new exhibit 
every few months. The laboratories are Chemistry, Physics, Technology, 
Life, Paleontology, and Watershed. OMSI has many other unique attractions, 
such as the USS Blueback submarine used in the film The Hunt for Red October,[145] 
the OMNIMAX Dome Theater, and OMSI's Kendall Planetarium. The OMNIMAX Dome 
Theater is a variant of the IMAX motion picture format, where the movie 
is projected onto a domed projection surface. The projection surface at 
OMSI's OMNIMAX Dome Theater is 6,532 sq ft (606.8 m2). The OMNIMAX Theater 
uses the largest frame in the motion picture industry, and the frames are 
ten times the size of the standard 35mm film.[146] OMSI's Kendall Planetarium 
is the largest and most technologically advanced planetarium in the Pacific 
Northwest.[147] OMSI is built right up next to the river and is also conveniently 
located near the entrance to the Springwater Corridor and Eastbank Esplanade 
pedestrian and bike trails. The Portland Art Museum owns the city's largest 
art collection and presents a variety of touring exhibitions each year, 
and with the recent addition of the Modern and Contemporary Art wing, it 
became one of the United States' 25 largest museums. The Oregon History 
Museum was founded in 1898. The Oregon History Museum has a variety of 
books, film, pictures, artifacts, and maps dating back throughout Oregon's 
history. The Oregon History Museum has one of the most extensive collections 
of state history materials in the United States. The Portland Children's 
Museum is a museum specifically geared for early childhood development. 
This museum has many topics, and many of their exhibits rotate, to keep 
the information fresh. The Portland Children's Museum also supports a small 
charter school for elementary children. Portland has been named the best 
city in the world for street food by several publications, including the 
U.S. News & World Report and CNN.[148][149] Food carts are extremely popular 
within the city, with over 600 licensed carts, making Portland one of the 
most robust street food scenes in North America.[150][151] Portland has 
the most total breweries and independent microbreweries of any city in 
the world,[152][153][154][155][156] with 58 active breweries within city 
limits[157] and 70+ within the surrounding metro area.[157] The city receives 
frequent acclaim as the best beer city in the United States and is consistently 
ranked as one of the top-five beer destinations in the world.[158] Portland 
has played a prominent role in the microbrewery revolution in the U.S. 
and is nicknamed "Beertown" and "Beervana" as a result.[159][160][161] 
Portland's modern microbrewery boom dates to the 1980s, when Oregon state 
law was changed to allow the consumption of beer on brewery premises. Brewery 
innovation is further supported by the abundance of beer ingredients produced 
locally, including two-row barley, over a dozen varieties of local Cascade 
hops, and pure mountain water from the Bull Run Watershed. The beer culture 
is partially responsible for CNBC naming Portland the best city for happy 
hour in the U.S.[162] The McMenamin brothers alone have over thirty brewpubs, 
distilleries, and wineries scattered throughout the metropolitan area, 
several in renovated cinemas and other historically significant buildings 
otherwise destined for demolition. Other notable Portland brewers include 
Widmer Brothers, BridgePort, Portland Brewing, Hair of the Dog, and Hopworks 
Urban Brewery. In 1999, author Michael "Beerhunter" Jackson called Portland 
a candidate for the beer capital of the world because the city boasted 
more breweries than Cologne, Germany. Portland is also known as a leader 
in specialty coffee.[163][164][165] The city is home to Stumptown Coffee 
Roasters as well as dozens of other micro-roasteries and cafes.[166] Portland 
has an emerging restaurant scene nationally and among three nominees, was 
recognized by the Food Network Awards as their "Delicious Destination of 
the Year: A rising city with a fast-growing food scene" for 2007. In 2014, 
the Washington Post called Portland the fourth best city for food in the 
United States.[167] Travel + Leisure ranked Portland's food and bar scene 
#5 in the nation in 2012.[168][169] The city is also known for being among 
the most vegetarian-friendly cities in America.[170] Portland is home to 
a diverse array of artists and arts organizations and was named in 2006 
by American Style magazine as the tenth best Big City Arts Destination 
in the country. Portland's public art is managed by the Regional Arts & 
Culture Council. Art galleries abound downtown and in the Pearl District, 
as well as in the Alberta Arts District and other neighborhoods throughout 
the city. Portlandia, a statue on the west side of the Portland Building, 
is the second-largest hammered-copper statue in the U.S. (after the Statue 
of Liberty). Portland's public art is managed by the Regional Arts & Culture 
Council. Powell's City of Books claims to be the largest independent new 
and used bookstore in the world, occupying a multistory building on an 
entire city block in the Pearl District. In 2010, Powell's Technical Books 
was relocated to Powell's Books Bldg. 2 across the street from the flagship 
store.[171] In 2012, the city was named by Travel & Leisure magazine as 
the No. 1 city in the country for book stores.[169] The Portland Rose Festival 
takes place annually in June and includes two parades, dragon boat races, 
carnival rides at Tom McCall Waterfront Park, and dozens of other events. 
The city is home to the Rosebud and Thorn Pageant, started in 1975 and 
modeled after the Imperial Sovereign Rose Court of Oregon.[172] Washington 
Park, in the West Hills, is home to some of Portland's most popular recreational 
sites, including the Oregon Zoo, the World Forestry Center, and the Hoyt 
Arboretum. Oaks Amusement Park, located in the Sellwood district of Southeast 
Portland, is the city's only amusement park and is also one of the longest-running 
amusement parks in the country. It has been in operation since 1905 and 
was known as the "Coney Island of the Northwest" upon its opening.[173] 
Portland hosts a number of festivals throughout the year in celebration 
of beer and brewing, including the Oregon Brewers Festival, held in Tom 
McCall Waterfront Park. Held each summer during the last full weekend of 
July, it is the largest outdoor craft beer festival in North America, with 
over 70,000 attendees in 2008.[174] Other major beer festivals throughout 
the calendar year include the Spring Beer and Wine Festival in April, the 
North American Organic Brewers Festival in June, the Portland International 
Beerfest in July,[175] and the Holiday Ale Festival in December. Pioneer 
Courthouse Square also holds an annual Christmas tree lighting on the Friday 
after Thanksgiving, and the tree remains in the square for five to six 
weeks through the holiday season. The residents of Peacock Lane, a street 
in the Sunnyside neighborhood, annually decorate their houses for the Christmas 
season and provide rides through the neighborhood in horse drawn carriage, 
a tradition established in the 1920s.[176] Portland is often awarded "Greenest 
City in America" and "most green cities" designations. Popular Science 
awarded Portland the title of the Greenest City in America in 2008,[177] 
and Grist magazine listed it in 2007 as the second greenest city in the 
world.[178] The city became a pioneer of state-directed metropolitan planning, 
a program which was instated statewide in 1969 to compact the urban growth 
boundaries of the city.[179] Portland is home to two major league sports 
franchises: the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA and the Portland Timbers 
of Major League Soccer. The Portland Thorns of the National Women's Soccer 
League also play in Portland. In 2015, the Timbers won the MLS Cup, which 
was the first male professional sports championship for a team from Portland 
since the Trail Blazers won the NBA championship in 1977.[180] Despite 
being the 19th most populated metro area in the United States, Portland 
contains only one franchise from the NFL, NBA, NHL, or MLB, making it America's 
most populated metro area with that distinction. The city has been frequently 
rumored to receive an additional franchise although efforts to acquire 
a team have failed due to stadium funding issues.[181] Portland sports 
fans are characterized by their passionate support. The Trail Blazers sold 
out every home game between 1977 and 1995, a span of 814 consecutive games, 
the second-longest streak in American sports history.[182] The Timbers 
joined MLS in 2011 and have sold out every home match since joining the 
league, a streak that has now reached 70+ matches.[183] The Timbers season 
ticket waiting list has reached 10,000+, the longest waiting list in MLS.[184] 
In 2015, they became the first team in the Northwest to win the MLS Cup. 
Player Diego Valeri marked a new record for fastest goal in MLS Cup history 
at 27-seconds into the game.[185] Two rival universities exist within Portland 
city limits: the University of Portland Pilots and the Portland State University 
Vikings, both of whom field teams in popular spectator sports including 
soccer, baseball, basketball, and football. Additionally, the University 
of Oregon Ducks and the Oregon State University Beavers both receive substantial 
attention and support from many Portland residents, despite their campuses 
being located 110 and 84 miles from the city, respectively.[186] Running 
is a popular activity in Portland and every year the city hosts the Portland 
Marathon as well as parts of the Hood to Coast Relay, the world's largest 
long-distance relay race (by number of participants). Portland serves as 
the center to an elite running group, the Nike Oregon Project, and is the 
current residence of several elite runners including British 2012 Olympic 
10,000m and 5,000m champion Mo Farah, American record holder at 10,000m 
Galen Rupp, and 2008 American Olympic bronze medalist at 10,000m Shalane 
Flanagan. Portland also has one of the most active bicycle scenes in the 
United States and has become an elite bicycle racing destination. The Oregon 
Bicycle Racing Association supports hundreds of official bicycling events 
every year. Weekly events at Alpenrose Velodrome and Portland International 
Raceway allow for racing nearly every night of the week from March through 
September. Cyclocross races, such as the Cross Crusade, can attract over 
1,000 riders and spectators. Skiing and snowboarding are also highly popular, 
with a number of nearby resorts on Mount Hood, including year-round Timberline 
Lodge. Parks and greenspace planning date back to John Charles Olmsted's 
1903 Report to the Portland Park Board. In 1995, voters in the Portland 
metropolitan region passed a regional bond measure to acquire valuable 
natural areas for fish, wildlife, and people.[187] Ten years later, more 
than 8,100 acres (33 km2) of ecologically valuable natural areas had been 
purchased and permanently protected from development.[188] Portland is 
one of only four cities in the U.S. with extinct volcanoes within its boundaries 
(along with Pilot Butte in Bend, Oregon, Jackson Volcano in Jackson, Mississippi, 
and Diamond Head in Honolulu, Hawaii). Mount Tabor Park is known for its 
scenic views and historic reservoirs.[189] Forest Park is the largest wilderness 
park within city limits in the United States, covering more than 5,000 
acres (2,023 ha).[190] Portland is also home to Mill Ends Park, the world's 
smallest park (a two-foot-diameter circle, the park's area is only about 
0.3 m2). Washington Park is just west of downtown and is home to the Oregon 
Zoo, the Portland Japanese Garden, and the International Rose Test Garden. 
Portland is also home to Lan Su Chinese Garden (formerly the Portland Classical 
Chinese Garden), an authentic representation of a Suzhou-style walled garden. 
Portland's downtown features two groups of contiguous city blocks dedicated 
for park space: the North and South Park Blocks.[191][192] The 37-acre 
(15 ha) Tom McCall Waterfront Park was built in 1974 along the length of 
the downtown waterfront after Harbor Drive was removed; it now hosts large 
events throughout the year.[193] The nearby historically significant Burnside 
Skatepark and five indoor skateparks give Portland a reputation as possibly 
"the most skateboard-friendly town in America."[194] Tryon Creek State 
Natural Area is one of three Oregon State Parks in Portland and the most 
popular; its creek has a run of steelhead. The other two State Parks are 
Willamette Stone State Heritage Site, located in the West Hills, and the 
Government Island State Recreation Area located in the Columbia River near 
Portland International Airport. Portland's city park system has been proclaimed 
one of the best in America. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, the Trust for 
Public Land reported that Portland had the seventh best park system among 
the 50 most populous U.S. cities.[195] ParkScore ranks city park systems 
by a formula that analyzes the city's median park size, park acres as percent 
of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park, 
spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 
10,000 residents. The survey revealed that 80% of Portlanders live within 
a half-mile to a park, and over 16% of Portland's city area is parkland. 
The city of Portland is governed by the Portland City Council, which includes 
the Mayor, four Commissioners, and an auditor. Each is elected citywide 
to serve a four-year term. The auditor provides checks and balances in 
the commission form of government and accountability for the use of public 
resources. In addition, the auditor provides access to information and 
reports on various matters of city government. The city's Office of Neighborhood 
Involvement serves as a conduit between city government and Portland's 
95 officially recognized neighborhoods. Each neighborhood is represented 
by a volunteer-based neighborhood association which serves as a liaison 
between residents of the neighborhood and the city government. The city 
provides funding to neighborhood associations through seven district coalitions, 
each of which is a geographical grouping of several neighborhood associations. 
Most (but not all) neighborhood associations belong to one of these district 
coalitions. Portland and its surrounding metropolitan area are served by 
Metro, the United States' only directly elected metropolitan planning organization. 
Metro's charter gives it responsibility for land use and transportation 
planning, solid waste management, and map development. Metro also owns 
and operates the Oregon Convention Center, Oregon Zoo, Portland Center 
for the Performing Arts, and Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center. The 
Multnomah County government provides many services to the Portland area, 
as do Washington and Clackamas counties to the west and south. Law enforcement 
is provided by the Portland Police Bureau. Fire and emergency services 
are provided by Portland Fire & Rescue. Portland is a territorial charter 
city, and strongly favors the Democratic Party. All city offices are technically 
non-partisan.[196] Portland's delegation to the Oregon Legislative Assembly 
is entirely Democratic. In the current 76th Oregon Legislative Assembly, 
which first convened in 2011, four state Senators represent Portland in 
the state Senate: Diane Rosenbaum (District 21), Chip Shields (District 
22), Jackie Dingfelder (District 23), and Rod Monroe (District 24). Portland 
sends six Representatives to the state House of Representatives: Jules 
Bailey (District 42), Lew Frederick (District 43), Tina Kotek (District 
44), Michael Dembrow (District 45), Alissa Keny-Guyer (District 46), and 
Jefferson Smith (District 47). Federally, Portland is split among three 
congressional districts. Most of the city is in the 3rd District, represented 
by Earl Blumenauer, who served on the city council from 1986 until his 
election to Congress in 1996. Most of the city west of the Willamette River 
is part of the 1st District, represented by Suzanne Bonamici. A small portion 
of southwestern Portland is in the 5th District, represented by Kurt Schrader. 
All three are Democrats; a Republican has not represented a significant 
portion of Portland in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1975. Both 
of Oregon's senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, are from Portland and 
are also both Democrats. In the 2008 presidential election, Democratic 
candidate Barack Obama easily carried Portland, winning 245,464 votes from 
city residents to 50,614 for his Republican rival, John McCain. In the 
2012 presidential election, Democratic candidate Barack Obama again easily 
carried Portland, winning 256,925 votes from Multnomah county residents 
to 70,958 for his Republican rival, Mitt Romney.[197] Sam Adams, the former 
mayor of Portland, became the city's first openly gay mayor in 2009.[198] 
In 2004, 59.7 percent of Multnomah County voters cast ballots against Oregon 
Ballot Measure 36, which amended the Oregon Constitution to prohibit recognition 
of same-sex marriages. The measure passed with 56.6% of the statewide vote. 
Multnomah County is one of two counties where a majority voted against 
the initiative; the other is Benton County, which includes Corvallis, home 
of Oregon State University.[199] On April 28, 2005, Portland became the 
only city in the nation to withdraw from a Joint Terrorism Task Force.[200][201] 
As of February 19, 2015, the Portland city council approved permanently 
staffing the JTTF with two of its city's police officers.[202] The city 
consulted with urban planners as far back as 1903. Development of Washington 
Park and one of the country's finest greenways, the 40 Mile Loop, which 
interconnects many of the city's parks, began. Portland is often cited 
as an example of a city with strong land use planning controls.[15] This 
is largely the result of statewide land conservation policies adopted in 
1973 under Governor Tom McCall, in particular the requirement for an urban 
growth boundary (UGB) for every city and metropolitan area. The opposite 
extreme, a city with few or no controls, is typically illustrated by Houston, 
Texas.[204][205][206][207][208] Portland's urban growth boundary, adopted 
in 1979, separates urban areas (where high-density development is encouraged 
and focused) from traditional farm land (where restrictions on non-agricultural 
development are very strict).[209] This was atypical in an era when automobile 
use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development 
along interstate highways, in suburbs, and satellite cities. The original 
state rules included a provision for expanding urban growth boundaries, 
but critics felt this wasn't being accomplished. In 1995, the State passed 
a law requiring cities to expand UGBs to provide enough undeveloped land 
for a 20-year supply of future housing at projected growth levels.[210] 
Oregon's 1973 "urban growth boundary" law limits the boundaries for large-scale 
development in each metropolitan area in Oregon.[211] This limits access 
to utilities such as sewage, water and telecommunications, as well as coverage 
by fire, police and schools.[211] Originally this law mandated that the 
city must maintain enough land within the boundary to provide an estimated 
20 years of growth; however, in 2007 the legislature altered the law to 
require the maintenance of an estimated 50 years of growth within the boundary, 
as well as the protection of accompanying farm and rural lands.[102] The 
growth boundary, along with efforts of the PDC to create economic development 
zones, has led to the development of a large portion of downtown, a large 
number of mid- and high-rise developments, and an overall increase in housing 
and business density.[212][213] The Portland Development Commission is 
a semi-public agency that plays a major role in downtown development; it 
was created by city voters in 1958 to serve as the city's urban renewal 
agency. It provides housing and economic development programs within the 
city, and works behind the scenes with major local developers to create 
large projects. In the early 1960s, the PDC led the razing of a large Italian-Jewish 
neighborhood downtown, bounded roughly by I-405, the Willamette River, 
4th Avenue and Market street. Mayor Neil Goldschmidt took office in 1972 
as a proponent of bringing housing and the associated vitality back to 
the downtown area, which was seen as emptying out after 5 pm. The effort 
has had dramatic effects in the 30 years since, with many thousands of 
new housing units clustered in three areas: north of Portland State University 
(between I-405, SW Broadway, and SW Taylor St.); the RiverPlace development 
along the waterfront under the Marquam (I-5) bridge; and most notably in 
the Pearl District (between I-405, Burnside St., NW Northrup St., and NW 
9th Ave.). The Urban Greenspaces Institute, housed in Portland State University 
Geography Department's Center for Mapping Research, promotes better integration 
of the built and natural environments. The institute works on urban park, 
trail, and natural areas planning issues, both at the local and regional 
levels.[214] In October 2009, the Portland City Council unanimously adopted 
a climate action plan that will cut the city's greenhouse gas emissions 
to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.[215] According to Grist magazine, Portland 
is the second most eco-friendly or "green" city in the world trailing only 
Reykjavík, Iceland.[218] In 2010, Move, Inc. placed Portland in its "top 
10 greenest cities" list.[219][220] As of 2012 Portland was the largest 
city in the United States that did not add fluoride to its public water 
supply,[221] and fluoridation has historically been a subject of controversy 
in the city.[222] Portland voters have four times voted against fluoridation, 
in 1956, 1962, 1980 (repealing a 1978 vote in favor), and 2013.[223] Most 
recently, in 2012 the city council, responding to advocacy from public 
health organizations and others, voted unanimously to begin fluoridation 
by 2014. Fluoridation opponents forced a public vote on the issue,[224] 
and on May 21, 2013, city voters again rejected fluoridation.[225] Strong 
free speech protections of the Oregon Constitution upheld by the Oregon 
Supreme Court in State v. Henry, 732 P.2d 9 (Or. 1987) specifically found 
that full nudity and lap dances in strip clubs are protected speech.[226] 
Portland has the highest number of strip clubs per-capita in a city in 
the United States, and Oregon ranks as the highest state for per-capita 
strip clubs.[227] Portland has been titled as "Pornland" for its strip 
clubs, erotic massage parlors, and high rate of child sex trafficking.[228][229] 
The term was heavily used in 2010, but the term was referenced by Chuck 
Palahniuk in 2003.[230] In November 2008, a Multnomah County judge dismissed 
charges against a nude bicyclist arrested on June 26, 2008. The judge stated 
that the city's annual World Naked Bike Ride—held each year in June since 
2004—has created a "well-established tradition" in Portland where cyclists 
may ride naked as a form of protest against cars and fossil fuel dependence.[231] 
The defendant was not riding in the official World Naked Bike Ride at the 
time of his arrest as it had occurred 12 days earlier that year, on June 
14.[232] The 2009 Naked Bike Ride occurred without significant incident 
as city police managed traffic intersections.[233] There were an estimated 
3,000 to 5,000 participants at the 2009 event.[234] In June 2010, Portland's 
World Naked Bike Ride had an early estimate of 13,000 riders, though the 
high estimate was disputed by event organizers.[235] The official event 
site provides an estimate of 7000 for 2010, and a high of 10,100 riders 
in 2015.[236] A state law prohibiting publicly insulting a person in a 
way likely to provoke a violent response was tested in Portland and struck 
down unanimously by the State Supreme Court as violating protected free 
speech and being overly broad.[237] According to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation's Uniform Crime Report in 2009, Portland ranked 53rd in violent 
crime out of the top 75 U.S. cities with a population greater than 250,000.[238] 
The murder rate in Portland in 2013 averaged 2.3 murders per 100,000 people 
per year, which was lower than the national average. In October 2009, Forbes 
magazine rated Portland as the third safest city in America.[239][240] 
Below is a sortable table containing violent crime data from each Portland 
neighborhood during the calendar year of 2014. Portland is served by six 
public school districts and many private schools. Portland Public Schools 
is the largest school district, operating 85 public schools.[243] Grant 
High School located in the Grant Park neighborhood has the largest enrollment 
of any public high school in the city.[244] Other high schools include 
Benson Polytechnic High School, Cleveland High School, and Roosevelt High 
School. Established in 1869, Lincoln High School is the city's oldest public 
education institution, and is one of two of the oldest high schools west 
of the Mississippi River.[245] Former public schools in the city included 
Washington High School, which operated from 1906 until 1981, as well as 
Jackson High School, which also closed the same year. Private schools in 
the area include The Northwest Academy, Rosemary Anderson High School, 
Portland Adventist Academy, Portland Lutheran School, the Portland Waldorf 
School, and Trinity Academy. The city and surrounding metropolitan area 
is also home to a large number of Roman Catholic-affiliated private schools, 
including St. Mary's Academy, an all-girls school; De La Salle North Catholic 
High School; the co-educational Jesuit High School; La Salle High School; 
and Central Catholic High School, the only archdiocesan high school in 
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland. Portland State University, 
located in downtown Portland, has the second-largest enrollment rate of 
any university in the state (after Oregon State University), with a student 
body of nearly 30,000.[246] It has been named among the top fifteen percentile 
of American universities by The Princeton Review for undergraduate education,[247] 
and has been internationally recognized for its degrees in Masters of Business 
Administration and urban planning.[248] The city is also home to the Oregon 
Health & Science University, as well as Portland Community College. Notable 
private universities include the University of Portland, a Roman Catholic 
university affiliated with the Congregation of Holy Cross; Reed College, 
a rigorous liberal arts college, ranked by Forbes as the 52nd best college 
in the country;[249] and Lewis & Clark College. Other institutions of higher 
learning within the city's borders are: The Oregonian is the only daily 
general-interest newspaper serving Portland. It also circulates throughout 
the state and in Clark County, Washington. Smaller local newspapers, distributed 
free of charge in newspaper boxes and at venues around the city, include 
the Portland Tribune (general-interest paper published on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays), Willamette Week (general-interest alternative weekly published 
on Wednesdays), The Portland Mercury (another alt-weekly, targeted at younger 
urban readers published on Thursdays), The Asian Reporter (a weekly covering 
Asian news, both international and local) and The Skanner (a weekly African-American 
newspaper covering both local and national news). Portland Indymedia is 
one of the oldest and largest Independent Media Centers. The Portland Alliance, 
a largely anti-authoritarian progressive monthly, is the largest radical 
print paper in the city. Just Out, published in Portland twice monthly 
until the end of 2011, was the region's foremost LGBT publication. A biweekly 
paper, Street Roots, is also sold within the city by members of the homeless 
community. The Portland Business Journal, a weekly, covers business-related 
news, as does The Daily Journal of Commerce. Portland Monthly is a monthly 
news and culture magazine. The Bee, over 105 years old, is another neighborhood 
newspaper serving the inner southeast neighborhoods. Legacy Health, a non-profit 
healthcare system in Portland, operates multiple facilities in the city 
and surrounding suburbs.[250] These include Legacy Emanuel, founded in 
1912, located in Northeast Portland; and Legacy Good Samaritan, founded 
in 1875, and located in Northwest Portland.[250] Randall's Children's Hospital 
operates at the Legacy Emanuel Campus. Good Samaritan has centers for breast 
health, cancer, and stroke, and is home to the Legacy Devers Eye Institute, 
the Legacy Obesity and Diabetes Institute, the Legacy Diabetes and Endocrinology 
Center, the Legacy Rehabilitation Clinic of Oregon, and the Linfield-Good 
Samaritan School of Nursing.[251] The Catholic-affiliated Providence Health 
& Services operates Providence Portland Medical Center in the North Tabor 
neighborhood of the city. Oregon Health & Science University is a university 
hospital formed in 1974. The Veterans Affairs Medical Center operates adjacent 
to the Oregon Health & Science University main campus. Adventist Medical 
Center also serves the city. Shriners Hospital for Children is a small 
children's hospital established in 1923. The Portland metropolitan area 
has transportation services common to major U.S. cities, though Oregon's 
emphasis on proactive land-use planning and transit-oriented development 
within the urban growth boundary means that commuters have multiple well-developed 
options. In 2014, Travel + Leisure magazine rated Portland as the #1 most 
pedestrian and transit-friendly city in the United States.[252] A 2011 
study by Walk Score ranked Portland 12th most walkable of fifty largest 
U.S. cities.[253] In 2008, 12.6% of all commutes in Portland were on public 
transit.[254] TriMet operates most of the region's buses and the MAX (short 
for Metropolitan Area Express) light rail system, which connects the city 
and suburbs. The 1986-opened MAX system has expanded to five lines, with 
the latest being the Orange Line to Milwaukie, in service as of September 
2015.[255] WES Commuter Rail opened in February 2009 in Portland's western 
suburbs, linking Beaverton and Wilsonville. The city-owned Portland Streetcar 
serves two routes in the Central City – downtown and adjacent districts. 
The first line, which opened in 2001 and was extended in 2005–2007, operates 
from the South Waterfront District through Portland State University and 
north through the West End of downtown, to shopping areas and dense residential 
districts north and northwest of downtown. The second line opened in 2012 
and added 3.3 miles (5.3 km) of tracks on the east side of the Willamette 
River and across the Broadway Bridge to a connection with the original 
line.[256] The east-side line completed a loop to the tracks on the west 
side of the river upon completion of the new Tilikum Crossing in 2015,[257] 
and, in anticipation of that, had already been named the Central Loop line 
in 2012. However, it was renamed the Loop Service, with an A Loop (clockwise) 
and B Loop (counterclockwise), when it became a complete loop with the 
opening of the Tilikum Crossing bridge. Fifth and Sixth avenues within 
downtown comprise the Portland Transit Mall, two streets devoted primarily 
to bus and light rail traffic with limited automobile access. Opened in 
1977 for buses, the transit mall was renovated and rebuilt in 2007–09, 
with light rail added. Starting in 1975 and lasting nearly four decades, 
all transit service within downtown Portland was free, the area being known 
by TriMet as Fareless Square, but a need for minor budget cuts and funding 
needed for expansion prompted the agency to limit free rides to rail service 
only in 2010,[258] and subsequently to discontinue the fare-free zone entirely 
in 2012.[259] TriMet provides real-time tracking of buses and trains with 
its TransitTracker, and makes the data available to software developers 
so they can create customized tools of their own.[260][261] I-5 connects 
Portland with the Willamette Valley, Southern Oregon, and California to 
the south and with Washington to the north. I-405 forms a loop with I-5 
around the central downtown area of the city and I-205 is a loop freeway 
route on the east side which connects to the Portland International Airport. 
U.S. 26 supports commuting within the metro area and continues to the Pacific 
Ocean westward and Mount Hood and Central Oregon eastward. U.S. 30 has 
a main, bypass, and business route through the city extending to Astoria 
to the west; through Gresham, Oregon, and the eastern exurbs, and connects 
to I-84, traveling towards Boise, Idaho. Portland ranks 13th in traffic 
congestion of all American cities, and is 16th among all North American 
cities.[262] Portland's main airport is Portland International Airport, 
located about 20 minutes by car (40 minutes by MAX) northeast of downtown. 
In addition Portland is home to Oregon's only public use heliport, the 
Portland Downtown Heliport. Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, 
provides service to Portland at Union Station on three routes. Long-haul 
train routes include the Coast Starlight (with service from Los Angeles 
to Seattle) and the Empire Builder (with service from Seattle/Portland 
to Chicago.) The Amtrak Cascades state-supported trains operate between 
Vancouver, British Columbia and Eugene, Oregon, and serve Portland several 
times daily. The city is also served by Greyhound Lines intercity bus service 
which operates BoltBus an express bus service. The bus depot is about one 
block from the Portland Union Station. The city's first airport was the 
Swan Island Municipal Airport which was closed in the 1940s. Portland is 
the only city in the United States that owns operating mainline steam locomotives, 
donated to the city in 1958 by the railroads that ran them.[263] Spokane, 
Portland & Seattle 700 and the world-famous Southern Pacific 4449 can be 
seen several times a year pulling a special excursion train, either locally 
or on an extended trip. The "Holiday Express", pulled over the tracks of 
the Oregon Pacific Railroad on weekends in December, has become a Portland 
tradition over its several years running.[264] These trains and others 
are operated by volunteers of the Oregon Rail Heritage Foundation, an amalgamation 
of rail preservation groups which collaborated on the finance and construction 
of the Oregon Rail Heritage Center, a permanent and publicly accessible 
home for the locomotives, which opened in 2012 adjacent to OMSI.[265] In 
Portland, cycling is a significant mode of transportation. As the city 
has been particularly supportive of urban bicycling it now ranks highly 
among the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.[266] Approximately 
8% of commuters bike to work, the highest proportion of any major U.S. 
city and about 10 times the national average.[267] For its achievements 
in promoting cycling as an everyday means of transportation, Portland has 
been recognized by the League of American Bicyclists and other cycling 
organizations for its network of on-street bicycling facilities and other 
bicycle-friendly services, being one of only three U.S. cities to have 
earned a Platinum-level rating.[268] A new bicycle-sharing system, Biketown, 
launched on July 19, 2016,[269] with 100 stations in the city's central 
and eastside neighborhoods.[270] The bikes were provided by Social Bicycles, 
and the system is operated by Motivate. Car sharing through Zipcar, Car2Go, 
Getaround, and Uhaul Car Share is available to residents of the city and 
some inner suburbs. Portland has a commuter aerial cableway, the Portland 
Aerial Tram, which connects the South Waterfront district on the Willamette 
River to the Oregon Health & Science University campus on Marquam Hill 
above. Portland has ten sister cities and one "friendship city" (Utrecht); 
each city is required to maintain long term involvement and participation:[271][272]
