Robert Joseph Hoover (April 15, 1915 – September 2, 1965), was a professional 
baseball player from 1937 to 1946. He played three years in Major League 
Baseball as a shortstop for the Detroit Tigers from 1943 to 1945. He also 
played six years in the Pacific Coast League for the Hollywood Stars from 
1938 to 1942 and the San Francisco Seals in 1946. Hoover was born in Brawley, 
in Imperial County, California, in 1915.[1] He spent most of his childhood 
in Pomona, California, and played high school and junior college baseball 
there.[2][3] Hoover began his professional baseball career in 1937 playing 
for the Rock Island Islanders of the Western League and the Indianapolis 
Indians of the American Association. He next played for five years with 
the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League from 1938 to 1942. In 1942, 
he compiled a .327 batting average with 34 doubles, 10 triples, 11 home 
runs, 62 RBIs and 14 stolen bases.[4] On October 1, 1942, the Detroit Tigers 
purchased Hoover from the Stars after all three Detroit shortstops — Billy 
Hitchcock, Johnny Lipon, and Murray Franklin — were inducted in the military 
during World War II.[5][6] Hoover had a draft deferred status as a married 
man with a family. At the time of Detroit's purchase of Hoover, The Sporting 
News described him as "hustle personified" and "not a chatterbox type." 
Physically, it described him as "a regular Adonis" with a "wasp-like waist" 
and "a fine pair of shoulders and a strong pair of legs to keep him in 
the lineup day after day."[2][3] Hoover became the Tigers' starting shortstop 
in 1943 and hit .243 with a .300 on-base percentage in his three seasons 
with the Tigers.[1] In 1943, he compiled a .243 batting average and led 
the American League in outs with 478 and in sacrifice hits with 28. He 
was also second in the league with 101 strikeouts in 1943.[1] Before the 
start of the 1944 season, Hoover was reclassified as 1A by the draft board, 
raising fears that the Tigers would lose yet another shortstop to the war.[7] 
Nevertheless, Hoover remained the Tigers starting shortstop in 1944. His 
batting average dipped to .236, but he was steady defensively, ranking 
second in the American League in range factor (5.55) and double plays turned 
(102) by a shortstop. He also ranked third in the league in putouts by 
a shortstop with 256.[1] In his final major league season, Hoover was a 
member of the 1945 Detroit Tigers team that won the American League pennant 
and defeated the Chicago Cubs in the 1945 World Series. However, after 
two seasons as the team's everyday shortstop, Hoover in 1945 divided shortstop 
duties with Skeeter Webb; Hoover started 55 games at shortstop, while Webb 
started 99.[1][8] Hoover's last major league appearance came in Game 6 
of the 1945 World Series. He had a single in three World Series at bats. 
He also had an RBI and scored a run in an 8–7 loss to the Cubs.[9] On January 
24, 1946, the Tigers sold Hoover to the San Francisco Seals in the Pacific 
Coast League.[10] Hoover compiled a career low .200 batting average in 
87 games for the Seals.[4] Hoover was married to Alice Smith Andres in 
November 1935. They had one child, Joethel Ann, born in approximately 1941.[3]
